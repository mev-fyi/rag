00:00:01.480 - 00:00:21.194, Speaker A: Thank you very much for coming to my talk. I'm really honored by your presence. Today. I'm going to be talking about immunology. And to motivate an interest in immunology, let's think about vaccines. So vaccines came in 1976 with Edward Jenner, 1796. Thank you.
00:00:21.194 - 00:01:14.464, Speaker A: So this is quite a while ago. I mean, when you think about science in 1796, it was not quite at the level that we have today. So it's natural to ask, where are we 200 years later? So one thing is we certainly know a lot more about immunology. A lot, lot more. But this hasn't really changed our fundamental approach to developing vaccines. So we might see that by a recent HIV trial that first recruited 26,000 volunteers, and then there were 16,000 that made it through the initial screening criteria. And then these 16,000 were randomized into, on one hand, a placebo arm and on the other, a vaccine arm.
00:01:14.464 - 00:02:15.406, Speaker A: And the study was run for six years, and out of that, 125 infections were observed. So let's leave aside the moral issues of such a trial for a second and just think about the fact that a trial that costs 105 million divided by 125 is a very expensive statistical experiment. And this is not really a good way to go ahead and develop better vaccines. We would like to leverage what we know about immunology in order to inform our vaccine design. So one of the questions that I'm really interested in is, how might we guide vaccine development without disease exposure? Because disease exposure is complicated and time consuming and morally ambiguous. Questionable. So, in zooming in a little bit, we're going to be talking about the B cell response, sometimes called the humoral response.
00:02:15.406 - 00:03:04.104, Speaker A: It's the response that is mediated by antibodies. So let's subset our thoughts a little bit to what can we learn from B cells without battle testing them, without actually exposing them to the pathogen? That they should be able to block some quick biological background. So this is a cartoon of an antibody. It's formed of two identical parts, this side and this side. And each part is formed of a heavy chain and a light chain, and it has. Each one of these chains has basically a hand that reaches out and binds the antigen. So the antigen is just whatever molecule that's associated with a pathogen that an antibody wants to recognize.
00:03:04.104 - 00:03:47.474, Speaker A: We have one hand here and one hand here. Is that clear? Okay, so this is the slide my wife calls the too many underpants slide. But seriously, there's so many antigens, they take all sorts of shapes and sizes. And there's no way that, given this diversity, of antibodies that your genome could code for each antigen individually. So the body has developed this incredibly elaborate and interesting process which actually came about the time that we got jaws. So lampreys don't have this, but most of the things you usually think of as animals have this. And it's separated into two parts.
00:03:47.474 - 00:04:23.738, Speaker A: There's this rearrangement phase and affinity maturation phase. So first the rearrangement phase. So there's lots of different v genes, lots of different d genes and lots of different j genes. And in order to make a b cell receptor, which is the locus that determines the shape of an antibody, there's a random choice of a v gene, a random choice of a d gene and a random choice of a j gene. These are deleted to some extent. So that's what this is supposed to show. And then they're joined together using these non templated insertions.
00:04:23.738 - 00:05:10.526, Speaker A: So they're called non templated insertions because this part, on the other hand, is more of a germline. It is coded for in your genome, whereas this, to first approximation, is sort of just random incorporation of nucleotides. So I'll be calling this the germline, these the germline regions and this the nontemplated insertion regions. And so I'll have a little cartoon here. This is a cell. This is showing the genome of the cell, the genotype which comes from that, and then the phenotype, which is, what is the antibody that expresses Peter, does this get translated? Does this get translated? Yeah. Yeah.
00:05:10.526 - 00:05:31.896, Speaker A: So we translate this along with some other things and it makes this. So you're thinking about frame, maybe. Well, we'll talk about frame. Okay. So the end of that process gives us the, this. This is called a naive b cell. And then there's this process of somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation.
00:05:31.896 - 00:06:04.764, Speaker A: So if we have an antigen like this, we want, the body is trying to increase its affinity for this antigen and it does so by a process of mutation. And sometimes these mutations make it bind worse, such as this one. Or maybe they make it find they make it bind better. Like this cup fits this antigen pretty well, and eventually it fits really well and then it reproduces like crazy. So again, this process is called affinity maturation. So this is when I get excited because this is a process of mutation and selection. And we know something about these.
00:06:04.764 - 00:06:43.252, Speaker A: So now I can actually outline what it is that I'm going to talk about. I'm going to talk about two subjects within two large goals that we have within the group. So one is to recapitulate the actual immune repertoire by doing sequencing. So what this is a diagram of is each one of these comes from an independent rearrangement event. I've only shown three here, but in reality there's millions. And then each one of these can undergo some affinity maturation process. So we can take a blood sample and sequence basically exactly what we see here.
00:06:43.252 - 00:07:41.424, Speaker A: And we'd like to be able to reconstruct this immune history. Is that clear? All right, so what we're going to be talking about today is just, if we want to do likelihood based inference in this framework, we're going to need to have mutation models for how somatic hypermutation happens. I should say substitution models. So we're going to be looking at those. And then another big goal, which is sort of crazily ambitious, is understand how we might manipulate the immune repertoire with interventions. And part of that is if we take this, this is what an antibody really looks like, at least in a cartoon, and we want to improve its affinity for something that we care about. What sites should we change? So that's obviously a difficult problem.
00:07:41.424 - 00:08:20.794, Speaker A: An aspect of that is, what sites can we change? So we're going to be looking at natural selection inference on these antibodies as a way of understanding, if we did want to change things about these antibodies, what might we be allowed to change? Our data is going to be sequences from the CDR three locus. So remember I was talking about the two hands. Each hand is composed of three fingers, these complementarity determining regions, and we're going to be sequencing this finger, the CDR three, which is highly variable. And we're going to start our sequencing region about here, go through the CDR three, and then back into what's called the framework region. The framework region is what gives it a little bit more structure.
00:08:22.494 - 00:08:26.794, Speaker B: Is it very different from the CDR one, the CDR two, or did you pick one of them?
00:08:28.654 - 00:08:47.250, Speaker A: It's a natural one to pick because it's highly diverse and it's heavily involved in. It's a very big finger that reaches out. Yeah, well, I mean, they're also important, and it can, like everything in biology, it varies greatly. But CDR three, on average, is quite an important one. Yeah.
00:08:47.322 - 00:08:53.602, Speaker C: So how do these three fingers in that feature correspond to that linear representation?
00:08:53.778 - 00:09:33.482, Speaker A: Yeah. So this, this section here is this section here. So we're just sequencing this little loop, but that little loop is not so little. It involves this v, d and j recombination with non template insertion with it. So you're absolutely right. This is a small part of a big antibody, and ideally, we would love to sequence the whole antibody people do with 454, but we wanted to use illumina to get a very deep survey. So this is 5 million sequences per individual, that we have three individuals, 130 nucleotides for each.
00:09:33.482 - 00:10:08.608, Speaker A: And there's a reason why we want to do it so deeply. It's not just because we want to rev our engines. It's like this is an incredibly diverse repertoire. Even with this level of sequencing, we're just sort of scratching the surface of the diversity of the b cell repertoire. Let's see. Okay, so this first part, this is an awesome question. So sequencing is sort of.
00:10:08.736 - 00:10:09.320, Speaker C: Repeat the question.
00:10:09.352 - 00:10:59.254, Speaker A: Oh, sorry. The question is, are we enriching for are we amplifying and then sequencing? And the answer is absolutely yes. And sequencing has really only come to this game a little bit late. And there's a reason for that, because if you want to do this sort of sequencing, you have to deal with the fact that there's lots of different variability. There's not only variable in terms of VD and j, but there's also somatic hypermutability stuff which makes it difficult to uniformly amplify the repertoire. So our collaborator on this, Harlan Robbins, has worked very, very hard to ensure that the primers that they use amplify everything that you have. I mean, amplify everything where everything has a star on it, meaning not everything, but I mean, but, you know, they have worked very hard in this problem, but it's not trivial.
00:10:59.254 - 00:12:00.344, Speaker A: And so that's why sequencing, like high throughput sequencing of the immune repertoire really started in 2009 and has sort of gone on since then. Okay, so substitution models for affinity maturation. So I'll be showing some matrices that are like this, where a light color means a fast rate and a darker color means a slow rate. So this is the rate of substitution from an a, say, to a t and so on. Just to motivate the next part, I should say that although there are big expansions of an individual rearrangement, on average these are small compared to the overall size of the repertoire. There are so many rearrangements out there that if we uniformly select two somatically hypermutated sequences, on average they won't have a common ancestor. The probability that they have a common ancestor will be small.
00:12:00.344 - 00:12:51.744, Speaker A: There's exceptions. For instance, when someone has cancer, an individual b cell will expand to absolutely dominate the population. That's not common in normal people. So for that reason, we are going to be ignoring the actual phylogenetic structure of these sequences as they're mutating, and just treat them as two taxon trees. So the way it works is we're going to take our sequence, divide it up into parts that we think are coming from the v, d and j segment. Take that, say the v section, find the best matching v in the genome corresponds to that, and then we're going to make a little two taxon tree. So where we know the ancestral state and then we're finding the derived, and then we observe the derived state and we're going to be looking at this mutation process.
00:12:51.744 - 00:13:34.654, Speaker A: We're going to be doing that for v's, D's and j's. Is that clear? Okay, so again, we have 15,000,003 taxon, well, triplets of two taxon trees. So we're going to be testing models. So the first question is, do we need to have a different model for the different segments? So here I've sort of cartoon wise shown the Vd and J models. This is the simplest possible model where they have the same mutation rate matrix between the segments and they also have the same branch lengths. So we're allowing the same number of substitutions for all three segments. But of course we have different branch lengths for the different sequences.
00:13:34.654 - 00:14:14.724, Speaker A: A slightly more complex model is one where we enforce the same mutation model, but we have just a global multiplier of the d rate as compared to the v rate. So this d rate is this multiplier times the v. I shouldn't say rate, I should say branch length. So the branch length here is this d rate times the branch length of v. And this one we have a similar situation with j. So j, the branch length for j is a multiplier of the v. A more complex model is where we allow different mutation matrices for the different segments.
00:14:14.724 - 00:14:16.624, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:14:16.664 - 00:14:24.146, Speaker B: Is this the way you think you want to make it? Most complicated? First, because there's also probably local context dependence mutation.
00:14:24.250 - 00:14:37.506, Speaker A: There is local context dependence. So for this talk, I'm really just looking at the single nucleotide mutation process, blinding myself to the fact that there are context specific mutations, but they come in a little bit later and then.
00:14:37.530 - 00:14:43.334, Speaker B: Maybe there's also variation, like with the inner region as you go towards the edges, or, I don't know, maybe there isn't.
00:14:43.994 - 00:14:56.692, Speaker A: Well, I mean, the data somehow is a little bit short to really differentiate these things. But we will be looking at sort of random rather than these segment specific things. We'll be looking at per residue a little bit later.
00:14:56.868 - 00:14:59.812, Speaker B: But this, you're saying like, if you look at the data, these differences kind of jump out.
00:14:59.828 - 00:15:18.074, Speaker A: They jump out and you'll see that they are actually different. Yeah. And is this before or after selection on these? You're sort of switching between mutation and substitution. I'm sorry, every time when I say mutation, I should say substitution. So this is a substitution model or after selections act. Exactly.
00:15:19.054 - 00:15:24.142, Speaker B: These are people. You can't put them in a germ free room for their entire lives.
00:15:24.318 - 00:16:04.578, Speaker A: Yeah. There's many things we would like to do. Right. But we can do some of those things in life, so. Yeah. And then a most complex model would be one where there's a separate branch length for each one of these segments. And just if we run AIC and BIC, we get this model that has a multiplier and has a different mutation substitution rate matrix for each segment, and we reject the more simple and the more complex models.
00:16:04.578 - 00:16:43.186, Speaker A: So this, this is going to be a theme. We saw the identical results between individuals, and we also saw AIC and DIC ranking them identically. So it seems really clear that we want a model that looks like this. Yeah, I can't tell which of your models that is, that has. This is the one that has different matrices and then one multiplier for each segment. I was looking at the line segments when I should have been looking at the equation. So let's look at what we infer to be.
00:16:43.186 - 00:17:23.360, Speaker A: Wow. The branch lengths. So what we have here is just the histogram of the branch length and also the inferred values for these multipliers. So this, for this individual, we infer that the d is substituting at about three times the b, the j at six. And for this individual, we see a non zero mode. So this individual, on average had some substitution. And just to remind you, these are branch lengths in terms of number of substitutions per site.
00:17:23.360 - 00:17:55.856, Speaker A: It's not exactly this, but you can think of this point is being about 10% mutated. So there's definitely some mutation, not a wild amount of mutation, except for if you're looking at broadly neutralizing antibodies, as Shishi talked about. And, I mean, those are way out here. I don't even know. I mean, maybe they're way over here. They're very far out in the distribution. So we can similarly look at different, the different individuals here.
00:17:55.856 - 00:18:06.604, Speaker A: This one had about a multiplier of about four, but still 0.6, about the j rate, and similarly about four. About 0.6. Yeah.
00:18:09.384 - 00:18:14.248, Speaker C: Are these individuals? It's HIV and over.
00:18:14.336 - 00:18:37.424, Speaker A: I'm sorry. These are healthy individuals. This is like you went in and we drew your blood at a single time point. At a single time point. Single time point. So this is across the different readings? Yeah, we. Yeah, we would like to know that information.
00:18:37.424 - 00:19:02.762, Speaker A: This is 0.4 substitutions per site, like since the ancestors. Exactly. Do you have an idea of how many b cell generations that is? That's a complicated question. I mean, that is an active research question in immunology, whether these things. Yeah, exactly how that works. I'd like to know that.
00:19:02.818 - 00:19:14.614, Speaker B: I mean, you expect it to be very spiky substitution. I mean, something gets triggered and then it goes through this hyper mutation and then maybe doesn't mutate for a long time afterwards.
00:19:14.734 - 00:19:56.916, Speaker A: Well, we're looking at the substitution process as it happens in an individual. And how exactly the cellular dynamics of that worker I don't think we can quite reason about without knowing more about it. Maybe I should just say, I hope these are clarifying questions. So I'm just curious. You said the alignments were sort of, you determined where the borders for BD and j were not priori somehow. But in terms of the alignments, like sometimes if you have poor alignment, that can give a false signature for positive selection. And I was wondering if the elevated rate for d is because we don't do a very good job.
00:19:56.916 - 00:20:13.184, Speaker A: I mean, certainly you're going to have some proportion like this, but I'm just wondering, like maybe it's so high, if is d the smallest region, for instance, or is the longest d. Yeah, d is the shortest and it gets eroded the most because it gets eroded on both sides. So you're right. But I don't think that this is just an all icon effect. Yeah.
00:20:13.564 - 00:20:15.116, Speaker B: So why don't we give Eric the.
00:20:15.140 - 00:21:13.204, Speaker A: Next 20 minutes to talk? Yeah, this is great. Well, I mean, this is up to you. Well, I mean. Okay, so if we look at the v, d and j rate matrices between individuals, we see what I think is quite surprising and interesting, that there's a real consistency between individuals. So these columns look similar to one another, but the rows look rather different to one another. In particular, J seems to have a different evolutionary substitution process than the others. We can just plot this by setting up the matrices such that this point represents what the entry was in the individual a and what this, and then this one, the same entry, but in the individual b.
00:21:13.204 - 00:22:15.244, Speaker A: And just do that for all pairs. And we can see that these line up nicely along y is equal to the x line. So this is an important aside that we actually have two subpopulations of these sequences, one we can see is in frame. So by in frame I mean that the v is in the same frame as the j and that will make a happy antibody. On the other hand, if this frame is different than this frame, it won't, because if this one's in frame, then maybe we'll get a bunch of stop codons here and that won't make a proper antibody. So for a biological reason that I won't describe, but it's very interesting, we get to sequence both these and these. These are a little bit more rare than we get to see these, but we get to see them both.
00:22:15.244 - 00:22:56.104, Speaker A: And what we're going to use later about these sequences is that they undergo a neutral mutation process. So no selection happening on these guys because they don't make any real antibody and these ones do make a real antibody and there's very strong selection. I'll entertain one question if people want to clarify this point, because it's important. Great. Okay, so we're going to stratify a bunch of sequences first. So we're just going to substitute to the v region and we're going to look at the individuals a, b and c separately. We're going to look at the genes separately and we're going to separate by productive and unproductive status.
00:22:56.104 - 00:23:55.294, Speaker A: So this is basically, watch out. This is basically what we get when we take each of these matrices and project it down by principal components. So this is, I won't describe exactly how we do this, but I will acknowledge that it's not completely trivial to do principal components on these sorts of rate matrices. But I think we've done the right thing. So each point here represents a rate matrix. So this is a picture of how the different segments are evolving, how the different genes and so on are evolving, and how that influences the evolutionary patterns that we see. So we can see that the most important difference along this first principle component is the out of frame sequences appear to be different than the in frame sequences, these productive sequences.
00:23:55.294 - 00:24:17.864, Speaker A: So that's not too surprising, really. So you get one rate matrix for each sequence. It's for each gene. So I shouldn't say sequence, I should say for each. So we're taking the sequences, we partition them first by individual and then by gene, and then by productive and unproductive. And we fit rate matrices to each one of these bends. Thank you.
00:24:17.864 - 00:24:47.684, Speaker A: Okay, so there's a clear signal in terms of in and out of frame. There doesn't appear to be an individual level signal, which doesn't surprise me. Too much, given the similarity between individuals on the previous. And there is a signal in terms of gene subgroups. So the v genes get classified into seven groups. And it does appear that there's some clustering here. These magenta ones are different than these brown ones and so on.
00:24:47.684 - 00:25:30.172, Speaker A: Okay, so we can also look at the branch length distributions very briefly. We can just see that this green one, which is the unproductive sequences, have sort of a fatter tail, meaning there are some sequences that are very highly mutated. And then it also has a higher peak at zero, meaning that there are sequences that don't get mutated very much. So we can. This sort of makes sense. There's no evolutionary constraint on these sequences over here, so we can see them accumulating more mutations. This I don't know if I can really explain.
00:25:30.172 - 00:26:11.804, Speaker A: So there's sort of more sequences that are unproductive, that don't get mutated at all. So I'll skip the wrap up. So our second goal again is trying to understand if we can mutate specific residues. And we're going to be doing a selection analysis for that. So, as many of you probably know, we can divide mutations into synonymous mutations that preserve the amino acid that is coded for. And they can, and we can say, look at non synonymous mutations that change the underlying amino acid. And this is going to form the underlying structure that we use to infer selection.
00:26:11.804 - 00:26:46.984, Speaker A: So we're going to be looking at omega or dnds. So, which is the rate of non synonymous substitution divided by the rate of synonymous substitution. So I want to emphasize that this is not the number of non synonymous divided by the number of synonymous. It's a rate in terms of some background process. And that background process is going to be very important for us to understand in this setting. So higher dnds means diversifying selection, such as these guys out here, and lower means like this. So this is sort of a foreshadow of what we're hoping to get.
00:26:46.984 - 00:27:22.792, Speaker A: Maybe I've taken away the suspense by showing you that we actually got it, but there's challenges with this. So one is, there's a strange mutational process that. Daniel, already there's this context dependence, perhaps, and there's a lot of sequences. So there's been some really great work by Ben Morrell and company that has extended dnds type analysis to thousands of sequences. But we have a few more than that. So this is a picture of the strange mutational process that I'm talking about. So what we have, these are only out of frame sequences.
00:27:22.792 - 00:27:43.222, Speaker A: And we're looking just at the synonymous rate and the colors are these individuals. So we can see this consistently varying synonymous substitution rate. So this site in all three individuals was very mutated and this site was not. So these are very close sites together. Yeah.
00:27:43.318 - 00:27:45.214, Speaker C: Is it a logarithmic scale or normal?
00:27:45.294 - 00:28:30.194, Speaker A: Yes, this is a logarithmic scale going to use. So the fact that this is not just completely stochastic is wonderful for us. We have this sort of reliable estimate of the neutral mutation process that we can use for our dnds analysis. So in particular, we're going to be just defining omega like this. We're going to be taking the rate in the non synonymous, the non synonymous rate in the in frame sequences and normalizing it by the non synonymous rate in the outer frame sequences. So this should take care of that bouncing back and forth. And we'll do the similar thing for the synonymous rate.
00:28:30.194 - 00:29:14.256, Speaker A: So this is still a lot of sequences to do this sort of thing with. And we are employing this thing called Renaissance counting, which is quite a clever strategy, which works as follows. So typically the way that these inference procedures work is you fit an entire codon model, and that's great, but it's sort of too hard for us. We have too much data. So instead what we can do is we sample mutation histories as they go back in time using just a single nucleotide mutation model. And then we treat these as observed. And then because they're observed, we can just count the number of mutations of different types.
00:29:14.256 - 00:29:52.186, Speaker A: We can say this is a synonymous mutation. This one is a non synonymous mutation, because we've basically imputed, in a probabilistic sense, what these different internal sequences are. I'll take a question. Okay. But of course, we don't pretend that we actually know them, but we just sample them according to their posterior probability and then it all sort of comes out in the wash. So these estimates can be unstable. So we need to do an empirical Bayes regularization, which I'll explain using a metaphor of a smoking survey.
00:29:52.186 - 00:30:30.014, Speaker A: So say we're interested in doing a smoking survey in a state. And the survey works by sending people into the state and seeing how many people on the speed of smoking say they go into a certain state and they don't observe any people smoking. That doesn't mean that there's actually no people smoking in that county. It just means that we happened not to see any when we did this survey. So what we're going to do is use all the data to fit a prior distribution of the frequency of smoking overall in the state. And then we're going to take a posterior distribution using these observations. So this is what it looks like for us.
00:30:30.014 - 00:31:05.864, Speaker A: The model is that we assume that these mutation rates come from a gamma with two parameters, a and b, or alpha and beta. And then we draw substitution counts as being poisson from these. And if you know your conjugate priors and such, you'll recognize that then this posterior is going to look something like this. But the key is that alpha and beta are fit to all the data. Thank you. Alpha and beta are fit to all the data. So this is sort of like the equivalent of the overall prevalence of smoking.
00:31:05.864 - 00:31:36.494, Speaker A: And then we see a thing that's an individual county, and then we sort of turn all of that information into a posterior distribution that we can draw from. So, and then we plug it into this formula, and this is going to give us a posterior on omega. So that's what I'm about to show. Oh, it's. It still takes a lot of computation. So each individual took three days on quite a big ec two instance using spark. Okay, so this is.
00:31:36.494 - 00:32:27.578, Speaker A: So we get this for each vgene individually, but we can collect these together and look at an overall v selection map. So what we're looking at is position by position. What is the distribution of the omegas that we have observed? So, again, down here is going to be purifying selection, and up here is diversifying selection. So these are violin density plots, which are sort of just density plots that are on the side. So this means that the median of all of the inferences for the v genes is somewhere up there, like 0.2. We can also classify the sites as being purifying or diversifying based on whether the 95% confidence interval excludes one. So that's what we get down here.
00:32:27.578 - 00:33:13.178, Speaker A: So this means that 90 or some percentage of the genes were classified as being purifying under purifying selection. And then this is the amount under diversifying selection. This is the positions along the v. So, remember, we were doing the sequencing and we had this loop, and it was going from sort of red to yellow. So the yellow was the framework region, and then the red was this variable loop. So that's exactly what we have here. So we're going, this is framework, at least it's called framework, and this is the variable region.
00:33:13.178 - 00:33:47.618, Speaker A: We can see that there's an enrichment for the. For purifying selection, sorry, for less purifying selection as we go into the variable loop, which is not terribly surprising. I just want to point out this, which I found quite interesting. So this is a fixed cystine. This is crucial for the functioning of the antibody. However, there's this site that's too back that has really strong purifying selection. And I didn't know anything about this.
00:33:47.618 - 00:34:23.164, Speaker A: And none of the immunologists, people that I talked to knew about it either. So I'll be interested in that. Like the others, we can see that this is quite consistent between individuals, which I also find quite interesting. I mean, these people have uncorrelated immune history at least. Presumably we see sort of this bump and then some sub bumps. And we see the same pattern of a bump and some sub bumps in similar locations. So this is just saying that if we make a plot, they appear to line up along the line.
00:34:23.164 - 00:34:58.768, Speaker A: So my question was, what is going on with that site? 102. So what this plot is showing is the distribution of amino acids in terms of just fraction. So to the left of the line is in the outer frame sequences and the right is the in frame sequences. So these are the ones that should not be experiencing selection. And these are the ones that are experiencing selection. So we can see that there's sort of. If we look at 102, there's sort of a gimmick of different amino acids in the unselected population.
00:34:58.768 - 00:35:33.974, Speaker A: But once selection acts, we have a phenylalanine and a tyrosine. And these are both aromatic amino acids. And so I don't have a slide for this, but we went back and mapped these onto the structure. And this is clearly an amino acid that is stabilizing the structure of the immunoglobulin or antibody. And so it can only tolerate a change to another aromatic inhibitor. And in fact, we see a number of aromatic amino acids coming along here. That's the frequency.
00:35:33.974 - 00:36:23.432, Speaker A: I'm sorry, I love zooming in on slides, but sometimes it's not good. So what this plot is showing is how frequent was a v in the outer frame versus in the in frame. Okay, you guys will have a chance to ask questions because I'm just wrapping up. So we developed a selection inference procedure. And one can use this selection inference procedure anytime you have data. I mean, it would be, I guess, interesting for people who have lots of data. And I should say, I guess I didn't say this before, but this regularization existed before.
00:36:23.432 - 00:37:07.734, Speaker A: But we extended it to the case where you have non constant coverage of the site. So originally. So we could have used the previous technology by basically just trimming everything to the shortest read and then treating that doing empirical based regularization on that. But we extended to the case where you have a varying amount of coverage across your gene. We use this to derive a per residue selection map, something I didn't, I guess, really emphasize before, but I think it's quite impressive that of all the genes that we should care about, these should have a lot of diversifying selection. But we see quite a lot of purifying selection happening here. But it's not constant, and it's consistent between individuals, which I find quite interesting.
00:37:07.734 - 00:37:48.178, Speaker A: Yeah, there's this amino acid story, so the paper's up on archive, and with that, I would like to thank my team collaborators, which were really fantastic. This is a true group effort between Connor, Trevor and Vladimir and myself, and Harlan brought the data and some great biological expertise, St. Paul Lindau, for actually doing the work. These funding agencies. And if I may take a second just to say that we have one or two postdocs opening up. And if you know anyone who's interested in molecular evolution applied to the real world health contacts, please have them contact me.
00:37:48.266 - 00:37:56.374, Speaker C: Thank you. We have time for questions.
00:38:00.414 - 00:38:29.694, Speaker A: So, my understanding is that to do the selection analysis, you need to first classify BD and J into the sub lineages. So you for us. Yeah, yeah. And so my concern about that is that. So I don't know what tool you guys use for that. Well, I'd say it depends less on the tool and more on the parameter routine. So, here.
00:38:29.694 - 00:38:59.154, Speaker A: So, first of all, the selection analysis was just done from v, but we need to match it to its ancestral state. You're right. And that is not a perfect. Well, it's not just not perfect. It's like 75% accuracy. It's not high. So we did some simulations that indicated that it wasn't as that bad, but we also did something where we just took the sequences that were very confidently classified, and we saw qualitatively similar results.
00:38:59.154 - 00:39:01.874, Speaker A: So, that's a good question.
00:39:04.974 - 00:39:13.274, Speaker C: In the first part of your talk, when you said you looked at BD and J separately, isn't D really short region? So how do you identify the gem line with a d?
00:39:14.534 - 00:39:16.034, Speaker A: Well, sometimes we can.
00:39:16.764 - 00:39:19.212, Speaker C: So, generally, you can identify it well.
00:39:19.308 - 00:39:50.284, Speaker A: I mean, that is the most uncertain. So maybe the previous question applies. I mean, we looked at situations where we could identify quite confidently and saw that we saw similar results. Wait, before you go again. So, I was wondering about your sort of in frame and out of frame models. And it seems like the ones which are out of frame must have been in frame for some number of the substitutions that's occurred. And so can you actually try and date how long they stayed in frame for or.
00:39:50.284 - 00:40:27.414, Speaker A: Okay, so I didn't take the time to explain this, but I think this is quite an interesting process that I actually want tt to work on that. So we are a deployed organism, therefore we have two copies of least lost sign. And the way it works, apparently, is you are a v cell and you haven't rearranged yet. You try first with one copy to rearrange. If that's successful, you stop and you go party. If you're unsuccessful, then you get the second chance. If you fail the second chance, you get thrown away.
00:40:27.414 - 00:41:04.674, Speaker A: So the sequences that we're sequencing that are out of frame are presumably just carried along by a successful rearrangement in the other locus. And the reason why we think we can classify them confidently according to in frame versus out of frame is because somatic hypermutation is primarily a point mutation process. And we saw that too in our data. We saw a very high proportion of point mutations. I mean, it's sort of like a fraction of a percent of, of indels when we looked at things that we knew the ancestors were. Does that answer your question?
00:41:09.854 - 00:41:13.354, Speaker C: So I understand that you're using the omega from your out of frame.
00:41:15.294 - 00:41:19.634, Speaker A: Well, the substitution rate, not the omega, but yes, the lambda.
00:41:20.054 - 00:41:47.054, Speaker C: Right. Yeah. So, but what you showed is interesting that you actually get, you get variation in omega, right. For those same three individuals, you have certain sites where you have actually dnbs much greater than one. Right. So I'm wondering, rather than just kind of using those results, I'm wondering whether you have any kind of insight into why you actually see that in these out of frame.
00:41:47.914 - 00:42:41.380, Speaker A: So why do we see the out of, like this non constant syntax rate in the outer brain sequences? This is something we are working on quite actively. So the stock immunology answer is that these are context specific mutations. And because these v genes have similar contexts. So what I mean by context specific, I mean that they depend on more than just the mutation, the nucleotide that's observed, but also the, once it's around it, then that would give us this pattern. It's possible there's more to that story. We're sort of trying to start fresh and understand if we just take a sort of statistical approach and try to think about what are the best models to use to fit this. Does it fall out of that? But I should say it's quite amazing.
00:42:41.380 - 00:43:09.744, Speaker A: So another interest of ours are these apogee of proteins that mutate retroviruses and it turns out we were working on that, and then we started working on this. And it turns out that the apobact proteins are close relative of the proteins that do this. So it's sort of one part of the family defends us against retroviruses, and the other mutates our genome so that we can fight off viruses and other things better. Yes.
00:43:14.044 - 00:43:20.384, Speaker C: Any other question? Okay, well, let's say speakers.
