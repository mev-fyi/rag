00:00:03.640 - 00:00:04.462, Speaker A: All right, great.
00:00:04.598 - 00:00:21.158, Speaker B: Thank you so much for having me here. My throat was itchy when during the previous talk, I got COVID, and I was feeling it anyway, so in case I start to clear my throat and you know why, I clearly recovered.
00:00:21.206 - 00:00:21.414, Speaker A: Right.
00:00:21.454 - 00:01:07.194, Speaker B: So I looked okay now. So, anyway, so today I'm going to tell you about our work as part of the encode consortium and to continue from our effort during the encode control. And today, it's going to be more like the evolutionary aspect of these regulatory elements that controls gene regulation. Just a little bit of motivation. As you all know, 1.5% of the human genome encode for proteins. We are really very interested in regulatory elements, which is, we think, the interesting bits of the non coding genome.
00:01:07.194 - 00:02:06.034, Speaker B: And so the reason we're interested in regulatory elements is ultimately, we're interested in understanding the variants that differ among our genomes. How are they related to our phenotypes? The interesting thing is these genetic variants are highly enriched in regulatory elements. So I have a pointer. So, actually, is this one brighter? Okay, so we are interested in regulatory elements. So, just very briefly, regulatory elements in encode, we call them candidate cis regulatory elements because these are defined using epigenetic data or transcription factor binding chip seq data. So they're not, like, solely tested. That's why they are called a candidate.
00:02:06.034 - 00:03:17.604, Speaker B: And very often they include promoters, which promotes the transcription of a gene by interacting with the proteins that will bind to the promoter, will interact with the polymerase and enhancers. They act at a distance by working through promoters, and they are silencers, and they are insulators. So we commonly see these different categories of regulatory elements. And what I'm going to talk about today includes all of them. So today's talk is not going to go into different types, but just as a whole, they're all in part of consideration. So they are so interesting that there is a two decade encode project that just ended earlier this year to chart all these functional elements in the genome. And I have an old picture before COVID when people are still attending in person conferences, we had one that was more virtual later on, but you get the picture.
00:03:17.604 - 00:03:57.206, Speaker B: So encode wanted to catalog functional elements in the human and mouse genomes. We were playing quite a bit of role in the data analysis center of this project. The project generated a ton of data and all freely available@encodeproject.org. Dot. And we actually had quite a lot of fun analyzing the data. For the talk of today, I'm going to mention a few data types. One is DNA's seq, which detects open chromatin regions in the genome.
00:03:57.206 - 00:04:47.208, Speaker B: They are chip seq, chromatin immunoprecipitation, followed by sequencing. They can be for grabbing out the regions bound by transcription factors, abbreviated as tfs or histone modifications. And there are a bunch of transcription data, rna seq, various types, and we worked hard on defining the registry of these cis regulatory elements. How do we define these regulatory elements? Candidates. Regulatory elements. I started out by saying they are candidate because we use epigenetic data. Exactly what do we mean by using epigenetic data? These are elements that are nucleosome sized.
00:04:47.208 - 00:05:37.404, Speaker B: They're around 300 base pairs long and very commonly devoid of a nucleosome. And instead of the nucleosome, they are bound by transcription factors. Very often, they will be bound by multiple transcription factors, up to ten. Sometimes we actually have data to show that a distribution. So if you have antibody that specifically recognizes one specific kind of transcription factor, you can chip it and then find out where it binds. That's one way of detecting these cis regulatory elements. And encode has a bunch of these kind of data, or they are very often flanked by nucleosomes that have a specific histomodification pattern.
00:05:37.404 - 00:06:47.484, Speaker B: Itself is nucleosome free, but the neighboring nucleosomes have patterns. You can also use antibody to grab down those histomodifications and then map and find out the region between them to get these ccres. Or you can use assays like dnas, which detects open chromatin. It basically cuts open chromatin regions and then try to figure them out where they are and then map to the genome. So we integrated a bunch of these kind of data that's generated by encode, as you can see here, in a specific locus of the sp one gene. And we detect these regions, like 300 base pair long regions in the genome that correspond to promoters that are open chromatin and has histone mark enhancers and insulators. They have a characteristic historic and binding by transcription factors such as CTCF, which is the insulator binding protein in mammals.
00:06:47.484 - 00:07:33.404, Speaker B: So we detect these ccres. So as part of encode three effort. So, actually, a lot of work was done by Jill Moore and Michael Picaro and Henry Pratt here. And Henry is sitting right there. So if you have any questions that I cannot answer, go ask him. So, as part of the encode, we put together a registry of nearly a million ccres in humans and less for mouse, because we have less data for mouse. But having mouse and human enable us to start to think about conservation, which kind of led to what I'm going to tell you about, because this is kind of old news.
00:07:33.404 - 00:08:17.226, Speaker B: You might have read about it, but for us, it's very old news, but it serves as a motivation. So if you take a look at these ccres and you look at the phylo p score, so we had in our hands at that time was a phylope score across 100 vertebrate genomes. And you can see these different types of ccres. These are like promoter enhancer, different. I'm not going to go into the details here, they are clearly more conserved than random, but they're actually not impressive. The reason I'm saying that is because I'm not showing you the error bar here. If I were to show you the error bar, there would be huge.
00:08:17.226 - 00:09:06.914, Speaker B: Right, this is mean, on average conserved, but a lot of them actually are not conserved. And if you compare the set we have between human and mouse, the human one is. It's a bit misleading here, because the mouse set is smaller due to the smaller amount of data. But in any case, quite a bit of it is no homology between human and mouse, and homology only. And then homology and also ccre in the other species, there is definitely conservation, but not so impressive. For a while, we kept on pondering over this. Are these low phallopies cCIe truly unconserved, or.
00:09:06.914 - 00:09:57.074, Speaker B: The data we had for conservation was across 100 vertebrates, and it's a long evolutionary distance. Perhaps some of these ccres will show conservation in more recent evolutionary time. We got involved in this zoonomia consortium, which is the project that's led by Shishan Limbalato and Eleanor Carlson. It just happens. Eleanor is one of my faculty, so we're talking about this during our faculty research. And she was like, oh, you're looking at these conservation. Why don't you try out our mammalian genomes? So they have sequenced 240 placental mammals.
00:09:57.074 - 00:10:15.754, Speaker B: That possibly is a more recent evolutionary time. We will hit it off right away. Greg was the one. Greg Andrews is a graduate student in my lab, was making a presentation. He must have done the presentation. Good job. So we got all roped into.
00:10:15.754 - 00:10:50.484, Speaker B: This is what I'm going to talk to you about today, this project, as part of the Zoonomia consortium. So also Kylie Fen and again, Henry, they are co leading this manuscript. So we took the 200 mm 500 p. So indeed, you see these solid lines, they are a lot higher then the dashed lines. The dashed lines are from 100 vertebrate in the previous plot I show you. So it's quite a bit, like three times higher, and we have hoops up. So this is great.
00:10:50.484 - 00:11:48.236, Speaker B: So another advantage of the tsunami data was it has these reference free alignment made up an algorithm called the cactus. I mean, why would you use a plant to make. The alignment of mammals is beyond me. But anyway, so they have across the 240 percental mammal alignment, it's not human specific, which is better than the vertebrate one we had before we took the alignment. Kailey was the one who came up with these triangle representation. If you take one ccre and you look across all 240 species, anyway, it's a bit confusing. I don't know if I should get into it.
00:11:48.236 - 00:12:26.360, Speaker B: But anyway, just remember it's 240 genomes and they don't include the human in this, because these ccres are defined in humans. So by definition, they're already in humans. So we're interested in whether or not they are also aligned in the other genomes. And the reason that it's still 240 is because Eleanor is a dog person and it has two dog genomes in there, which is a bit jarring and like a purebred and some kind of crust. Anyway, so it's still 240. Just a tidbit. So if you take a ccre, remember it's like 300 base pairs long, and you can.
00:12:26.360 - 00:13:06.928, Speaker B: You can have some kind of threshold as to what percentage of the 300 base pairs need to be aligned in another genome. It depends on the threshold. You can say 90% of it has to be aligned. Then you count across the 240 genomes exactly. Out of 240, how many would be able to align more than 90% or more of the position? You can also flip it and say how many of the genomes really definitely don't align. So less than 10%? Less than 10%, again, of the 300 base tests. So, by definition, every ccre, this is 0.92
00:13:06.928 - 00:13:39.816, Speaker B: million dots on this heat map. Every CCIe needs to lie in this triangle, because they can't go out of it just by design. But the interesting thing is three populations pop out. Group one, we call them group one, group two and group three. And this is random. If you randomly picked regions in the genome, you can see there is an in, in these two regions, especially group one and group three. So, as it turns out, group one is highly conserved across mammals, across almost 240 mammals.
00:13:39.816 - 00:14:02.816, Speaker B: And group three is primate specific, very primate specific, as you will see in a minute. It's very interesting. And group two is a mix. I don't know if you have questions about it, I can show you more plots, but I don't want to get into all these details without confusing you. Yeah. Oh. N one is the number of species, number of genomes.
00:14:02.816 - 00:14:43.504, Speaker B: Sorry. And one is number of genomes out of the 240 that can align at least 90% of the positions of a particular ccre, and two is almost 10%. So n one and n two sum up to, at most, 240. That's why it's on the triangle, so you can see that group one is enriched. We're very enriched. So it's. Half of the cCIe is actually enriched across all the mammals.
00:14:43.504 - 00:14:49.114, Speaker B: This is much more so than the vertebrae, which you will see in the next slide in comparison.
00:14:50.494 - 00:14:51.718, Speaker C: So did I answer your question?
00:14:51.766 - 00:15:27.202, Speaker B: I know it's a bit of mind twisting here. Okay, ask me again. Okay, so, okay, we submit a paper and whatnot. And one of the reviewers was being very annoying at first, but turned out to be actually very patient. He was like, why do you think mammal's genome? Are you sure it's helping you? And what do you get if you just use your vertebrate genomes? So we actually went back and made this map with 100 vertebrate genomes. Now it goes to. From 10 to 99.
00:15:27.202 - 00:16:00.834, Speaker B: You don't really show it because human is part of the 100. And out of the 100 vertebrae genomes, there are 68 mammal genomes. Just keep it in mind. So you see the blob moved from here to here. Okay? And this region is the part that's conserved beyond the mammals. And if you really want to be very stickler about the ones that are conserved beyond mammals, it's this triangle at the top left corner, and that is only 4.4% of our ccie's.
00:16:00.834 - 00:16:39.042, Speaker B: Okay? So basically, you have to use a shorter evolutionary distance if you really want to detect the conservation of these elements. They evolve very fast. And if you go beyond mammals, you just don't detect them. You detect some really, really deeply conserved ones, but very low percentage. And you can take this map and take each one, the ccie in each region and map to the mammals triangle. This is the same one as what I showed previously, and you can see the ones VG, zero vertebrate group, Geo. It's like at the.
00:16:39.042 - 00:16:49.834, Speaker B: The pinnacle of this triangle is hugely conserved. So anyway, by using the mammal's data, we really are at a very sweet spot for detecting conservation.
00:16:51.174 - 00:16:51.894, Speaker A: So.
00:16:52.054 - 00:17:24.018, Speaker B: Okay, here comes another reviewer, which is really, really annoying. For a week, I was very annoyed by him, and I was losing my appetite because he says, there's really nothing wrong with the paper, but I just don't like it. How about you do this opposite thing? You start with your alignment. You're not using the alignment. You're doing all these averaging. We did something following the reviewers. Usually reviewers, they don't help in a lot of the papers.
00:17:24.018 - 00:17:58.794, Speaker B: It turned out to be. This one was really helpful. We took the alignment. Each ccre can be represented as an alignment, a percent alignment across all 240 genomes. And then we throw this thing into umap. And if you still remember group one, group two, group three in that triangle, heat map, and they show up. I was like, whoa, what is this? So, group one, remember, is the across all mammals conserved, and then group two is the one at the lower left.
00:17:58.794 - 00:18:23.502, Speaker B: It's a mixed bag. We call them actively evolving. And group three is primate specific. The reason it's primate specific, we have all the alignments. They effectively only show up in primates. Out of the 240 genomes, we have 42 primates plus three nearest non primate genomes. They're very weird things.
00:18:23.502 - 00:19:15.744, Speaker B: I actually learned a lot of biology about these things. The closest one is sundar flying lemur, which is neither flying nor a lemur, right? And it's this naked, red looking thing with a canopy on top that can glide for, like, 250 meters from some tree. I don't know why it needs to do that. But in any case, for, like, 50 years, people thought it was a mammal and just got recently disqualified. So, anyway, all these tidbits aside and these group three elements, they basically explode into little clusters, right? You can color this umap by, like, number of genomes. They align, and it's fascinating. Depends on what fraction of the lens you require.
00:19:15.744 - 00:19:48.298, Speaker B: You have heard the number of 90% and 10%. So if you color by 90%, like they align, the number of species that align is, like, at the tip here. If you change the threshold to be a little more lenient, you see the red kind of crept up. So again, like, one of the reviewers was asking, like, how, like, you know, you're making all these arbitrary decisions in tiny percent, 10%. Like, what happens if you change the threshold? There you go at group two is actually this thing. It changes. This is green ones.
00:19:48.298 - 00:20:29.018, Speaker B: When you change the threshold, it aligns more. If you require 50% to be aligned, group two elements actually get aligned across 170 genomes. They really are very interesting mix. Then, of course, we can start to color this thing by other possible genomic function, like Phylo p score. Phylo p score alignment is doesn't have, like, a mutation rate in it. So by design, Phylo P score has a mutation rate of the different branches of the tree already in the model. And so we think it's a more accurate model.
00:20:29.018 - 00:21:30.574, Speaker B: You'll see in a minute when we switch to transcription factor binding sites. But you see the group one, the most conserved one at the tip, have the highest fallopy score, and you can color it by the distance to the nearest transcription star side. You see these things start to show up. Even the most conserved ones, they don't have to be promoters, but promoters tend to be more conserved. And when you overlap with transposable elements, the group three really are pretty much the majority of the ones that group three here are derived from transposable elements. So I'm going to switch to transcription factor binding sites just to show your related results. So, as part of encode, we have henry here again, built this resource called the factbook you might have used before.
00:21:30.574 - 00:22:21.884, Speaker B: Take the chip, seq data generated by encode and then annotate as much as possible, motif all kinds of things out of it. So we already, in our wheelhouse, we already have collections of transcription factor binding sites, all curated. So we took 367 tfs, really the curated sites of these transcription factors, and now they are smaller. They are like between seven to 20 base pairs big. So one ccre can have a lot of transcription factor binding sites in it. Just keep that in mind so it's a higher resolution picture of gene regulation. So this is one out of the 367 tfs we looked at.
00:22:21.884 - 00:23:01.054, Speaker B: It's a liver specific HNF transcription factor, and this is the corresponding umap. Okay, remember the one with ccre is still, again, red, green and blue for the three groups. Red is highly conserved across all mammals. Green is the mixed cluster, mixed group. And then blue is primate specific. We have these 42 primates plus three other species I mentioned, fine Lima. The other two are treeshues, in case you're interested.
00:23:01.054 - 00:23:31.370, Speaker B: Here is the primate part of the tree. So the tree is longer. We just truncated it to show only the primate part. You can see that all these clusters indicate different evolutionary combinations, like a. Here, it's only in grade eight. You don't have to be able to read it, but if you zoom in, you can see all the data with percentages and all that. But just look at the color.
00:23:31.370 - 00:23:49.814, Speaker B: Red means it's there and then blue means excellent. If you look really carefully, it's not like 50%, 50%, it's more like 90% than 5%. So it's really clean cut. So this cluster is only in great apes and b. Where did b go?
00:23:49.974 - 00:23:50.542, Speaker A: Okay.
00:23:50.638 - 00:24:04.038, Speaker B: B is only in great apes and old world monkeys, and c is in great apes and new world monkeys, but not in old world monkeys, and d is in great apes and monkeys.
00:24:04.166 - 00:24:04.622, Speaker A: Okay.
00:24:04.678 - 00:24:21.664, Speaker B: E now extend to lima like monkeys, and f now includes those three interesting non memos. Okay, so you can look at the. Each cluster. They are there, like every. Each way you can imagine.
00:24:23.124 - 00:24:23.904, Speaker A: Yes.
00:24:25.364 - 00:24:28.784, Speaker D: Binding says it's just a sequence level constellation.
00:24:33.404 - 00:24:42.592, Speaker B: Oh, they're from. Yes, yes, yes. The data from humans is from chip seq, but in other species, it's only sequence level conservation.
00:24:42.668 - 00:24:44.248, Speaker D: How do you know they're bound in other.
00:24:44.376 - 00:25:05.312, Speaker B: That's a really good question. I'll show some data for some of these. Okay, but they are. Yeah, I mean, it's complicated. They may not be bound about the ones that have sequence conservation. We believe it's still bound in other species. Okay, just hold on.
00:25:05.312 - 00:25:43.396, Speaker B: Your question, if I don't answer, ask me again later. So, if you look at these clusters, again, if you look at the transposon element, you see these waves of transposable elements. So these are the same classes I'm talking about before. And like line one element here, line one is among the youngest transposable elements in our genome. Line two is old, very old. Alu is sign is also very recent. Mir is sign, but ancient.
00:25:43.396 - 00:26:13.278, Speaker B: And LTR is long. Terminal repeat containing element is young, and DNA element is old. So you can see like, waves of them just bringing in the sites into the human, the primate lineage, differently for. For the sites of one factor. And this is not like HNF four, a specific. If you look across, like the 367 tfs, we have data for each one of them. We have a he map.
00:26:13.278 - 00:26:36.294, Speaker B: We have all these things you can see. They basically tell the same story. And this is an aggregate plot across all the TF binding sites. There are 15.6 million of them defined in humans. And you can see that if it's group, 386.1% of them are derived from transposable elements.
00:26:36.294 - 00:27:50.760, Speaker B: And they are basically innovations of transposal elements during the primate lineage and mostly contributed by these young tes, line one, lu, and the LTR elements. So, because the resolution for transcription factor binding sites is much higher than for ccres, which I showed you, if you still remember the plot before, the continuous portion, the portion that's not group three is quite continuous, but for transcription factors, this is more likely the case with lobes coming off for other elements. And you can see this is fox a one, binding sites, and these lobes of them, and you can see they are lost. One here is lost in bats and two lost in new world monkeys. Again, red means present, blue means absent. Three is the slope was lost in cetaceans. These are whales and platypuses.
00:27:50.760 - 00:27:51.884, Speaker B: Oh, okay.
00:27:53.624 - 00:27:55.064, Speaker A: Sorry, time is out.
00:27:55.104 - 00:28:13.040, Speaker B: Oh, time's out. Okay, you can see. You can see the picture. And I'm going to skip this, and I can answer Jian's question. So, at the. At the end. Okay, so here is chip seq data from other species, and the ones that are.
00:28:13.040 - 00:29:00.214, Speaker B: This is the percentage of constraint sites. We actually came up with a way of defining subsets of them that are conserved across the species. And a subset of them, we think we know which ones are conserved and they are likely to be bound and likely to be functional. And this is chip seq data across species. And the constrained ones are likely to be bound, likely to leave footprints of DNA's cleavage. And at the end, I have to say this, but in order to get to my punchline, I do have a punchline besides color pictures. So we did LD score regression for all these sites.
00:29:00.214 - 00:30:01.406, Speaker B: Here are the Zunomia conserved elements, and we derived a set of conserved elements using two component gaussian model in one of the slides that I skipped over. Anyway, we define the ones that we think are conserved with a better definition, using trees and mutation rate, and they are highly enriched in human traits. The enrichment in the human trait is the most prominent when you have the highest conservation, and it's cell type specific for the traits. So we have thyroid traits, red blood cell traits, and then other immune traits. They correspond to different cell types. So I'm just going to conclude before I get thrown off the platform. So, the conclusions, I have a very long conclusion, but anyway, I just want to tell you that what I really want to tell you is.
00:30:01.406 - 00:30:15.374, Speaker B: So, if you look at the human regulatory elements, about one fifth, like 20% of them, are recent in the innovations in the primate lineage by transposons.
00:30:15.834 - 00:30:16.274, Speaker A: Okay?
00:30:16.314 - 00:30:35.094, Speaker B: However, that's not what's causing all our problems with our traits. So, however, it's the opposite. The most deeply conserved elements across all mammals, which constitute about one 8th of all of our elements, those are the ones that explain human traits.
00:30:36.954 - 00:30:44.734, Speaker A: That's it, yes.
00:30:45.794 - 00:31:34.654, Speaker D: Fascinating. See this? In the late two thousands, there was a lot of work from Eddie Rubin's lab on what kind of constraint sequence constraint they use. So we published a lot of papers then, showing that mammalian constraint, placental constraint, is what you should use for mammalian regulatory elements. You're looking at conservation. That doesn't tell you about constraint. It's a pile of t that you can essentially run pile of t on different planes. You don't have to run pilot.
00:31:35.434 - 00:31:35.810, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:31:35.842 - 00:31:37.386, Speaker C: This is basically what we did.
00:31:37.530 - 00:31:45.122, Speaker D: Exactly. So if you look at constraint, rather than if you just look at conservation, then of course, the primary specific elements will be transposons.
00:31:45.258 - 00:31:46.666, Speaker A: Correct. Yeah.
00:31:46.770 - 00:31:56.774, Speaker D: But if you look at constraints, are not all equal. So the vast majority of transposons, they are not constrained.
00:31:57.194 - 00:31:57.974, Speaker A: Correct.
00:31:58.394 - 00:32:02.922, Speaker C: 99% of them are not constrained. 99.9%.
00:32:02.978 - 00:32:05.174, Speaker A: Also groups. We are not constrained.
00:32:05.634 - 00:32:07.618, Speaker C: It's exactly the same as we said.
00:32:07.746 - 00:32:13.690, Speaker D: Actually, much more. If you use primate alignment.
00:32:13.762 - 00:32:14.258, Speaker A: Low.
00:32:14.386 - 00:32:15.810, Speaker C: Oh, primate alignment is low.
00:32:15.882 - 00:32:17.418, Speaker D: Primate constraint is higher.
00:32:17.506 - 00:32:21.344, Speaker C: Yes, yes. If you use primate alone, a lot of them align.
00:32:21.474 - 00:32:22.628, Speaker A: Exactly. Yeah.
00:32:22.716 - 00:32:48.544, Speaker D: What I suggest is using primate alignments, that gives you a better idea of the conserved function. And if you look at constraint, what it turns out is that transposons and non transposons are the same. They equally likely to give you functionality, but you have to look at constraints.
00:32:49.444 - 00:32:50.276, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:32:50.460 - 00:33:04.972, Speaker C: Okay, we can look. So, this is the slide I skipped over, and you can see the contribution. It's like a bimodal distribution. We did this for each of the TF, and we defined the other mode as constraint.
00:33:05.148 - 00:33:06.452, Speaker D: This is primary constraint.
00:33:06.548 - 00:33:08.584, Speaker C: No, this is ML constraint.
00:33:09.084 - 00:33:10.504, Speaker D: Very different picture.
00:33:12.684 - 00:33:14.424, Speaker A: Yeah, we can do that.
00:33:14.604 - 00:33:18.964, Speaker C: Yeah, we can do that for primate. They are like 43, 42.
00:33:20.584 - 00:33:20.936, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:33:20.960 - 00:33:22.896, Speaker B: We can repeat this for primates.
00:33:23.040 - 00:33:23.944, Speaker A: Good suggestion.
00:33:24.024 - 00:33:24.804, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:33:28.344 - 00:33:33.884, Speaker E: So, in money again. So the encode data has about 680 transcription factors.
00:33:34.504 - 00:33:35.112, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:33:35.208 - 00:33:53.250, Speaker C: So, um. Has more than what I talk about. So basically here, we showed we six to seven of them, because we are quite. We have curated a set with motifs so we understand what they are. And encode has more data for transcription.
00:33:53.282 - 00:33:54.610, Speaker B: Factors, as I call them.
00:33:54.682 - 00:34:04.894, Speaker E: Pretty depleted for existing finger class, which is less well studied. People are doing in vitro experiments to try to find binding class.
00:34:05.954 - 00:34:06.354, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:34:06.394 - 00:34:07.468, Speaker B: Tim Hughes. Right.
00:34:07.556 - 00:34:20.380, Speaker E: So can you take that information and kind of feed that back into a nucleosome occupancy data and other things from the encore project to try to infer whether those sites are actually occupied? They are occupied.
00:34:20.572 - 00:34:22.132, Speaker B: They are but trying to tie them.
00:34:22.148 - 00:34:25.692, Speaker E: To whatever transcription factor, you know, like usually we have.
00:34:25.828 - 00:34:28.316, Speaker B: Yeah. These are the crabs and fingers.
00:34:28.380 - 00:34:29.744, Speaker C: I skipped the slide.
00:34:30.084 - 00:34:30.652, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:34:30.748 - 00:34:49.894, Speaker C: So we have 69 of them in our collection, and we actually learned quite a bit about them. But they bound, so they are definitely bound in humans. It's just they are recent inventions, so they are less likely to be bound beyond primates.
00:34:50.834 - 00:34:53.442, Speaker E: And they have marvel linked transposons, as.
00:34:53.458 - 00:34:54.522, Speaker C: I recall, because they're.
00:34:54.578 - 00:34:55.610, Speaker B: Yes, exactly.
00:34:55.722 - 00:35:03.984, Speaker C: Percent transposable element overlap, which is most of elements. They're all way higher.
00:35:04.804 - 00:35:05.584, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:35:08.124 - 00:35:17.144, Speaker C: Have very different features, too. They're more there to repress transposals, while others are being spread around by transposals.
00:35:28.854 - 00:35:35.754, Speaker D: If you look whether these different types of conservative elements are also conserved, the association between.
00:35:37.814 - 00:35:50.190, Speaker C: That's our next step. I was going to go to talk to Eris and use this DNA data has the high c data on a lot of mammals. We have not looked at them yet.
00:35:50.382 - 00:35:52.954, Speaker A: Yeah, it's the next step.
00:35:57.514 - 00:36:19.014, Speaker E: So I thought that was really impressive, the explanatory power you got using explicit evolutionary trees and looking at the clade with the HNF four, a binding site. So I was wondering what you thought about looking at the first half. We were expecting to lump all the 240 different mammals, whether looking at those in the context of the details of the trees for that ocean mouth, sort of there.
00:36:19.574 - 00:36:52.634, Speaker C: We have two sets of parallel analysis. One is for ccres, which are bigger and less lower resolution, and you can actually see they are more continuous. And then each one is like a combination. I haven't shown them to one. It's a combination of different groups of transcription factor binding sites, which limited analysis. That's why more analysis with done tfps, and that's why I show you more of it. But we have done both analyses.
00:36:52.634 - 00:36:56.194, Speaker C: In the big picture, they are similar to each other.
00:36:56.734 - 00:36:58.674, Speaker B: Functions are pretty much the same.
00:37:00.454 - 00:37:02.054, Speaker A: Jian, still have a question?
00:37:02.174 - 00:37:04.350, Speaker D: Yeah. Is it okay if I ask?
00:37:04.382 - 00:37:05.114, Speaker C: Go ahead.
00:37:07.734 - 00:37:16.554, Speaker D: So the question is about. So you completely rely on the sequence alignment to call whether that position is conserved.
00:37:18.654 - 00:37:19.794, Speaker A: It's aligned.
00:37:20.374 - 00:37:24.510, Speaker D: For example, these rabbit problems, like the binding site, we show, we know there.
00:37:24.542 - 00:37:29.006, Speaker C: Is some kind of turnover, they might jump to neighboring sites.
00:37:29.070 - 00:37:29.222, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:37:29.238 - 00:37:50.464, Speaker D: The sequence level, the binding side may be conserved, but the exact columns and alignment may not be that conservative. Back to some of the elements that don't show the high of, say, pilot peak constipation, maybe pick up some sequence level conservation.
00:37:50.804 - 00:37:52.184, Speaker C: They have moved around.
00:37:52.804 - 00:37:53.396, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:37:53.500 - 00:37:54.628, Speaker D: Turnover events.
00:37:54.716 - 00:37:55.076, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:37:55.140 - 00:37:55.428, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:37:55.476 - 00:38:00.268, Speaker D: It's possible in a way that is at a sequence level is not that conserved, but functionally it is conservative.
00:38:00.436 - 00:38:15.194, Speaker C: It's possible, yes. We didn't have the power to pin those down. I mean, we have some kind of way of allowing some movement in the alignment, but we didn't explicitly look for them in the neighborhood to see if they're still there.
00:38:15.934 - 00:38:16.310, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:38:16.342 - 00:38:18.594, Speaker C: That's a legitimate criticism.
00:38:20.654 - 00:38:23.166, Speaker D: Maybe it's time to thank for.
00:38:23.270 - 00:38:23.774, Speaker B: Thank you so much.
