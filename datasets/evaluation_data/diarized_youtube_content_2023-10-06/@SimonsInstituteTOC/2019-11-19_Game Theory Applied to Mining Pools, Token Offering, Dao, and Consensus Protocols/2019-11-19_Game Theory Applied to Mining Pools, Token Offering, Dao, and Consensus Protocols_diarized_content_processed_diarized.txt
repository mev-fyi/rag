00:00:00.200 - 00:00:01.064, Speaker A: Economics talks.
00:00:01.086 - 00:00:04.550, Speaker B: The first one will be by Jasoo Lee, who's from George Mason University.
00:00:04.622 - 00:00:06.274, Speaker A: He's going to talk about game theory.
00:00:08.014 - 00:00:49.150, Speaker C: All right, so thank you, Abhi, for inviting me over. So Abhi told me that he wants me to talk, give some overview about economics and blockchain and with some focus on my own work. So I look into my own papers and I've realized that there's a common theme that is game theory. So I think what I'm going to do today is I'm trying to do the kind of impossible try to put three papers together and try to frame them in an arrangement in a nice way so that I can finish all of them in 15 minutes. So just kind of give you an overview about all the three papers I'm going to be talking about. So, by the way, the first paper, actually, some of you may have already seen that last month, one of my co author also presented this paper at this conference. So you may be able to access the video.
00:00:49.150 - 00:01:29.954, Speaker C: So I'm going to be very short on the first paper, but that's actually going to be some game theory analysis into the mining pools and the mining industry. And then I'm going to focus on. The other paper is looking at some game theory analysis into initial coin offerings. We're trying to provide an economic theory for us to understand what is the value created by crypto tokens, especially what they call so called utility tokens. And the last paper that I'm going to be talking about is also kind of a game theory. And the paper, when I originally write the paper, I didn't really wrote it for, for blockchain. I was thinking at the time, I was thinking about investment crowdfunding, but as time goes by, I realized, okay, think about what initial coin offering is.
00:01:29.954 - 00:02:03.098, Speaker C: It's basically kind of doing crowdfunding on the blockchain. So it kind of has the app implications toward blockchain, too. And also it's going to be about an investment problem. So it may also have some kind of implications and guidance for us to design that decentralized autonomous organizations. So hopefully I'm going to get through all of them within the next 15 minutes if we have extra time. I'm going to just talk a little bit about some of our recent thoughts on using, applying game theory to consensus protocols, but maybe we're not going to be able to get there. So just very quickly.
00:02:03.098 - 00:02:19.994, Speaker C: Mining pools. Mining pools in the mining industry. So what are the. I assume everybody here in the room, right, knows what mining pools are. So just show some facts here. What we plot is, just, over time, the evolution of this mining industry. So this is horizontal line is time.
00:02:19.994 - 00:02:56.016, Speaker C: Our sample starts from 2011 and ends until the end of 2018. So you can see all these mountain like blocks. These are basic mining pools. It shows the evolution of the market share of each different mining pools. And the big red, the big white chunk here are independent miners. So back in the early days, most of mining are done by competitive individual miners that are not part of a pool, as Satoshi Nakamoto envisioned in his white paper. Over time, we see that the market has become completely dominated by mining pools.
00:02:56.016 - 00:03:32.440, Speaker C: This is one thing. Second is that mining pools do get large sometimes, but also gets small over time. It doesn't seem to be that over time, there's a strong tendency for one particular mining pool to dominate the entire market. And the third is this line here. This actually is the log version of the total computing power, the total hash rates devoted into bitcoin mining. And overall, it's on an upward trend. So what our paper is trying to do, we try to build a theory, using economic insights, to explain all the facts that we can observe from this chart.
00:03:32.440 - 00:04:03.794, Speaker C: Namely, first, why do mining pools arise in the first place? Second, if mining pools have reason to arise, why there is no such a force that pushes one particular mining pool to become dominant. Third, the rise of those mining pools and the evolution of the market share of those mining pools, whether it has anything to do with the increasing hash rate devoted into bitcoin mining. So this is our plan. I'm going to be very quick on this paper. I'm going to get rid of all the math because my co author has done that. But I just give you some intuitions.
00:04:04.294 - 00:04:13.078, Speaker B: So this green line, for example, shows, like, the green bubble at the beginning, that's a mining pool that survived and then basically evaporated. All the people left.
00:04:13.206 - 00:04:15.702, Speaker C: Yeah. So basically, this pool basically died over here.
00:04:15.838 - 00:04:18.838, Speaker B: All the people who were part of that pool presumably joined another pool.
00:04:18.886 - 00:04:19.474, Speaker C: Yes.
00:04:20.494 - 00:04:22.154, Speaker A: What's the source of this data?
00:04:22.294 - 00:04:38.122, Speaker C: Oh, this is just like, we collect all the data from bitcoin.com. so you can have the block, really, information, and then just every month, right, you just look at how many blocks are produced over what, how many blocks should be produced globally, and you can get the kind of get an estimate of the market share.
00:04:38.258 - 00:04:43.698, Speaker A: Wait, but then, so could the white part include mining pools that don't advertise themselves?
00:04:43.866 - 00:05:07.326, Speaker C: Potentially could, yes, that's definitely possible. So, first of all, why do mining pools arise in the first place? I don't think, I think this is just common knowledge. Everybody probably knows about this because mining is risky. So joining a pool can reduce your risk. That's just income smoothing. Everybody knows that. You don't need me to tell you.
00:05:07.326 - 00:05:46.814, Speaker C: So if you're a small miner, you want to join a mining pool. Second question, why people may think that a large pool will ever get larger. So leads to concentration implications. This is because if mining pools is for risk sharing, you are the miner here. When you're faced with a small pool versus a large pool, you can think about which pool provides you with better risk sharing. And I think it should be pretty obvious that the large pool provides you better risk sharing. If based on that insight, we may just draw the conclusion that if a pool that starts being large will attract more miners and then the pool will just become even larger, then eventually become monopoly and dominate the entire mining space.
00:05:46.814 - 00:06:24.824, Speaker C: And that creates, that kind of destroys all the purpose of all these decentralization things. Gets a little bit complicated, right? Because pools may also charge fees. So when you join a pool, you don't get the whole, you don't get the fair share. Actually, there's a percentage of them actually goes to pool operator. So the question is now becomes like, say okay, if you have a large pool versus a small pool, but the large pool supposedly, supposedly charges a higher fee. Now what should be your decision whether you join a large pool with a higher fee or a small pool with a smaller fee? That's kind of a tough question for financial economists. Yes.
00:06:24.984 - 00:06:29.952, Speaker A: So do all pools have open membership or might there be a reason to have a private pool?
00:06:30.088 - 00:06:41.244, Speaker C: There potentially could be private pools, but you can think about private pools just more like a miner that participates in the mining space rather than just when we talk about the pools here, you can think about all of them are open pools.
00:06:42.924 - 00:06:51.664, Speaker D: Can you distinguish any measurements between, say, a giant miner that has just a large fraction of the mining power?
00:06:52.444 - 00:07:09.874, Speaker C: Well, so not in the data node, but in theory, our analysis shouldn't, should apply to pools, to miners of any size. Suppose like if this is like for example, there's a private pool, then you can think about, this is like a large private pool over here. You just think about it as a single individual minor.
00:07:12.214 - 00:07:12.990, Speaker A: So there's a fee.
00:07:13.022 - 00:07:18.638, Speaker B: There's also like an algorithm for the share, for the block reward sharing, right? Are all of them proportional or are.
00:07:18.646 - 00:07:42.764, Speaker C: They, they are not all proportional to the, like the partial, non partial solution that you provide. But the goal, right. All the goal is trying to approximate your share of the hash rates among all the participants. So for our analysis, we just assume that this part. Right, this algorithm is perfect. So, like, we can measure your share of the hash rates among all the pool members perfectly. Yeah.
00:07:43.504 - 00:08:08.772, Speaker A: So you're saying empirically, this is how pools charge. But like a priori, you can imagine a pool that says, look, you pay us like $10,000 upfront and then you can mine with us for the year. So the pricing would be like, not really comparable. There'd be like, you know, you, you wouldn't know what the price of bitcoin is going to be in six months. But you know how much you paid to participate in this mining pool. But you're just saying. We're ruling that out because empirically it doesn't happen.
00:08:08.772 - 00:08:12.132, Speaker A: Everybody just, the pool just takes some fraction of the mining bitcoin.
00:08:12.188 - 00:08:55.732, Speaker C: So there are two answers to this. First is that we actually have some empirical data, actually have, do collect pool fee information. That's one part of it. And also in our modeling framework later on, we'll have also we call so called passive miners, who do not actually optimally allocate their hash rates. So you can think about if, for example, if I have a long term contract with a particular mining pool, that I'm going to be sticking to a pool for a year, that will be, in our model, be captured as like sticky passive miner that stick with them. All right, so this exercise, right, it doesn't really have a clear cut answer, but it's actually very easy for financial economists. But when we think as financial economists, when we think about the stock market, all we talk about is, okay, when I invest in a stock, is about the return versus risk trade off.
00:08:55.732 - 00:09:41.534, Speaker C: So here, when you think about you are joining a pool, the fee that they charge and the risk sharing benefit that the pool can provide you is exactly that framework. So, and also, if any of you have been thinking about this problem, if you think that I should join this pool, or if you think about that I should actually join this pool, then unfortunately, you got it wrong. Because also, just according to financial economics, what we learned is that when you face these two poles, what you should do is diversify. Don't put all your eggs in one basket. So if you are a miner and you face multiple pools that charge different fees and of different sizes, then you should allocate your hash, hash rates just according to an optimal ratio across all different pools. Yes.
00:09:42.794 - 00:09:46.014, Speaker A: Why would the mining pool operators want this?
00:09:46.844 - 00:09:50.036, Speaker C: But mining pool operator cannot prevent you from doing this.
00:09:50.100 - 00:10:11.504, Speaker A: No, but they can do. They can do the frequent flyer thing where we apply these highly nonlinear rewards to try to basically monopolize the customer, or I guess in this case the miner. And so I'm just surprised that people aren't playing these more sophisticated policies to try to basically gobble up as many miners as possible to get more power in the marketplace to be able to get.
00:10:13.284 - 00:10:31.744, Speaker C: So for most of parts, the identity of these miners are kind of anonymous to the mining pools. And you can simply think about, I mean, there's no way to prevent a miner from doing some civil attack type of response to whatever schedules that is posted by a mining pool.
00:10:33.404 - 00:10:38.292, Speaker B: If you actually have a longer term relationship, you get like a higher reward free.
00:10:38.468 - 00:10:48.882, Speaker C: That's right. The second part then is going to be, again, just like we assume that there's going to be some passive miners who do just stick to a pool. I'm surprised it's not later on in.
00:10:48.938 - 00:11:04.866, Speaker E: The model, say mining more than x in a year, there's going to be miners who don't have the capacity to mine x in a year. So they'll say, if I join this pool, I'm subsidizing bigger players than me, and then they're just going to go to the pool that doesn't have the frequent flyer program and the bottom will.
00:11:04.890 - 00:11:09.326, Speaker A: Sort of, unless it's cheaper. Even with the frequency, you still might.
00:11:09.350 - 00:11:44.814, Speaker C: Be getting a bit. Yeah, that's all valid points. And the way we accommodate that is going to be some miners would not be optimal allocating their hash rates according to what we're going to prescribe for these other reasons. Maybe actually what they are doing is actually optimal. They are not optimal in our model, but we can accommodate them. Ok, so the idea is that you should actually allocate to both pools and you diversify because both pools, the pools are going to be solving independent questions. If you allocate hash rates across pools, you're going to be having further diversification benefit.
00:11:44.814 - 00:12:13.634, Speaker C: So just as a kind of a side note, so some of my colleagues in the computer science department, we actually implemented a, we actually implemented a website. So you can go onto this website and like, you just choose, okay, I want to mine bitcoin and these are the number of pools that I want to participate. And this is my number of my hashrates. And also specify how risk averse you are. Then basically that algorithm will just pop out. Okay, how much hash rate should be allocated to endpull? How much should be f fool how much should be to whatever ambit pool.
00:12:14.814 - 00:12:15.686, Speaker D: Can I ask a question?
00:12:15.750 - 00:12:17.446, Speaker C: Yes, risk.
00:12:17.550 - 00:12:42.350, Speaker D: How much risk? Like somehow the way the risk is, it takes a long time until you get a reward. It's a sign process. But in practice, if you have the pool that sort of builds big enough, then it goes down exponentially. So it's not like in terms of risk, right? So you're guaranteed basically, and there's some negligible differences. But then I shouldn't care if the pool is much, much bigger than that.
00:12:42.462 - 00:13:14.996, Speaker C: Well, not exactly like that, because when you are a very large pool, then also there is a lot of money at stake. So eventually, like from the tip of the standard way of thinking about your preference or utility is going to be defined over your eventual wealth, right? So you can think about, okay, so if I have a, if I can pull a lot of random sources. So maybe by law of large numbers in terms of the just the randomness is become smaller. But still I have a lot of money at stake. So the small randomness multiplied by the large money that I stake is still going to be large.
00:13:15.180 - 00:13:17.956, Speaker D: If it's two to the -100 then it doesn't matter how much, it only.
00:13:17.980 - 00:13:26.004, Speaker C: Becomes negligible if this wealth becomes so large, right? So then the multiplication of them is still going to not going to be infinite testing.
00:13:29.904 - 00:13:33.408, Speaker B: So does risk aversion just mean like shape of utility curve, whether.
00:13:33.536 - 00:14:11.824, Speaker C: Yes, yes, yes. All right, so, so far what we have introduced is, okay, think about what, how miners would, should allocate their hash rates, how they should do decisions when they face pools. But now here's the game theory part that comes in pools. They can expect that miners will be optimally allocating their hash rates across different pools. And also some of them maybe not, for whatever reason that we have just discussed. So let's think about, ok, what if those pools, they engage in a competition by just deciding what's the fee that they charge. So basically what we want to analyze is a natural equilibrium.
00:14:11.824 - 00:15:06.844, Speaker C: Each pool takes into account what other pools are charging and what current size they are running and decide on what is the optimal fee that I want to charge. And because of some miners, may not be optimally allocating hash rates at all times. So that basically will make the game become a Bertrand competition among the pools. But the goods that the pools provide become imperfect substitutes. When the pools are deciding what the fees that they charge, they need to think about three things. The first is that the revenue from those so called passive miners, right? Because if I increase my fee, those, these guys already have a long term contract with me, they stick with me, if I increase the fees, I'm going to get more from these guys. But also I need to think about the participation from active miners, because if I charge a high fee, then the active miners are not some of the active miners just going to be go away from my pool and they just go to some other pools.
00:15:06.844 - 00:15:50.084, Speaker C: So I also need to think about that. And there's a third. Is that my externality on the mining difficulty? Because if I'm a large pool and I charge a very high fee, that is going to deter miners from joining the mining game in general and probably is going to have some impact on the mining difficulty. So that's my externality on the mining difficulty. And you expect that if a pool that with more kind of passive miners will have larger externality. So when they decide on their fees, they also need to internalize that externality. So just give you the, without going through the analysis, if you solve the game, what we can find that maybe seems quite intuitive.
00:15:50.084 - 00:16:47.800, Speaker C: If the pool that starts being large, the pool that has a lot of miners and a lot of hash rates that stick with them, when we solve the game, we will find that it's optimal for them to charge higher fees. So, and previously, there is one thing that I didn't mention, is that when the miners are deciding how to allocate their hash rates, if two pools charge the same fee, then the optimal allocation for you would be, suppose that this pool is twice the size of this pool and they charge the same amount of fee. Then the optimal allocation for you as a miner is going to divide your hash rates into three pieces, and you have two pieces going here and one piece is going here. So in other words, for pools that charge the same fee, the optimal allocation for you is always going to be proportional. And if one of the pools charge a little bit higher fees than the other, then you can use this proportional allocation as a benchmark until toward the pool that charge a little bit lower.
00:16:47.832 - 00:16:51.400, Speaker B: Fees, you just balance the expected value.
00:16:51.472 - 00:17:03.094, Speaker C: From each pool like the expected utility. So you take the risk return and risk into account. That's also why in this demo, right, so your risk version plays a role.
00:17:04.754 - 00:17:13.786, Speaker B: So essentially, the sticky passive miners are what lead to different fees in different pool structures. Because some people don't bother to implement.
00:17:13.850 - 00:17:43.991, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly, exactly. Actually, like we did, I put it here, maybe I didn't. So, like, if we think about a benchmark case, if there's no passive miners at all, then the game outcome would be all the pools would charge zero fees because it's a background competition, race to the bottom. Everybody charges zero fees. And pool size doesn't matter because no matter what the size distributions are, as an active miner, you're just going to allocate proportionally. So this is kind of what you mentioned. This kind of friction is actually important for driving some of the results.
00:17:43.991 - 00:18:31.974, Speaker C: So, large pools will charge higher fees, and because they charge higher fees, miners allocate proportionally less hash rates to them. That, so that that's why those poles will actually grow slower. And this is why we found that in the data that there seems to be a mean reverting force that prevents one poles from being getting too large. So this is a decentralization force. So, last point we want to talk about, ok, how does the rise of mining poles get associated with the increase of hash rates? You can think about, well, the first order effect must be escalating, like asics or just the improvement in the hardware. But we think there is also another very important reason, and it's also very intuitive. So, suppose that you are a miner.
00:18:31.974 - 00:19:16.330, Speaker C: If you mine alone, suppose this is the optimal amount of hash rate that you want to devote to mining. When you're deciding how much hash rate you devote into mining, you need to think about the cost of mining, and also think about, need to think about the return and the risk associated with doing the mining. But now suppose that you join a mining. Oops. Now suppose you join a mining pool, and mining pool provides you risk sharing. So now you perceive the risk that you face to be lower if you don't adjust the amount of hash rates that you devote to mining. But because if you have a given risk bearing capacity, once you join a mining pool, you'll find it's actually optimal for you to allocate more hash rates into mining, because mining now becomes less risky.
00:19:16.330 - 00:20:16.292, Speaker C: From your perspective, if we think about all the miners doing the same thing, if all the miners, now they join mining pools, they all will find it's optimal for them just to allocate more hash rates into mining. But we know that mining basically is a zero sum game because of this difficulty adjustment process. So that's why we see mining pools arise. And associated with that, we can see an increase in the hash rates that the total hash rates devoted into mining. And actually, we did some calculation. We find that given reasonable parameters, having mining poles versus not having mining poles can actually multiply the total global hash rates devoted to mining by almost ten times. So hopefully I didn't go through the details of the paper, but hopefully I could give you the gist of all, the insights that we explained why we see mining pools arise, why we don't see mining pools monopolize, and why we see an increase in hash rates all within our framework.
00:20:16.292 - 00:20:16.900, Speaker C: Yes.
00:20:17.052 - 00:20:28.388, Speaker F: So in the model, the static miners, they are going to stick with that pool no matter what the charge is and no matter how high it is. And they're going to instantly pay that charge.
00:20:28.516 - 00:20:29.224, Speaker C: Yes.
00:20:29.924 - 00:20:33.396, Speaker F: Because, I mean, in real life, they're under like, 24 month contracts and blah, blah, blah.
00:20:33.420 - 00:20:39.004, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. You can think about the model is always simplification kind of captures that idea. Yes.
00:20:40.224 - 00:21:00.436, Speaker A: But then given this model, it could be that many of these pools are actually the same, because my incentive as a mining pool operator would be to jack up the prices to basically gouge my static miners as much as possible. So then I should just create a new brand that I can use to get miners who want a lower fee and then hope that some of those become static.
00:21:00.500 - 00:21:07.980, Speaker C: So in the paper, we have a section talking about the entry of new pools, and I think we don't have time to talk about this, but I'm happy to talk about.
00:21:08.012 - 00:21:13.668, Speaker B: But do you see some evidence that essentially it's the same pool that's just rebranding with a different fee structure?
00:21:13.796 - 00:21:25.344, Speaker C: And then it happens. Yes, it does happen. I think one of. I forgot the name. I think how BTC used to be. What name? And it changed to. I don't remember the details, but they do happen.
00:21:26.104 - 00:21:30.984, Speaker B: And those lines compressing right there, like, see in the middle section from October 15 to.
00:21:31.064 - 00:21:32.088, Speaker C: Which one? This one?
00:21:32.256 - 00:21:47.128, Speaker B: Yeah, that chunk, you see how they're thick in 2015, and then they just get thinner and thinner as you move to the right. Are those basically, like, static in the sense that they have the same hash power, but the market just.
00:21:47.176 - 00:21:52.636, Speaker C: Oh, this is all about market share. So if we talk about absolute hash rates, probably it's going to be.
00:21:52.800 - 00:22:06.244, Speaker B: So if I have, like, let's say, ten percentage points of the. Of the market share in 2016, but no new people joined my pool, and. But the whole market is increasing, presumably, my share gets smaller and smaller.
00:22:06.324 - 00:22:24.544, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, actually, I didn't put it here. So, actually, we have empirical data that just basically run the regressions about the pool growth and pool fees on their initial size, and we basically find that result that is consistent with our predictions. So, like, larger pool charge higher fees and they grow slow.
00:22:26.644 - 00:22:47.024, Speaker B: I guess from this graph, it looks to me like there's just so much activity, like new. New pools coming into the situated situation all the time. How are they marketing themselves? How are they differentiating themselves? Like this is a commodity, right? So why wouldn't there be a first advantage that like ten people started in 2012 and those are the ten that stick around?
00:22:47.144 - 00:23:32.644, Speaker C: Some of the advantage you do have is like if there are already a lot of hash rates that are sticking to you, like passive hash rates stick to you, then you can think about your kind of magnets that attract a lot of other people because, you know, like from miners perspective, you join this pool and there are some people who just are not going to move around. You have some people to shoulder the risk along with you. So you can think about that as one advantage. But there's no kind of mechanical first mover advantage other than this. Suppose that you are very big pool today, but for whatever reason, like all these passive hashrates, all the active hash rates just migrate overnight to another pool. Then your pool just dies. There's nothing that prevents that kind of like mechanical in the technology that makes a particular pool have market power.
00:23:33.144 - 00:23:33.528, Speaker A: Ok?
00:23:33.576 - 00:23:38.404, Speaker B: But there's nothing that suggests that people, your model suggests people are really sticky.
00:23:39.604 - 00:23:45.628, Speaker C: I'm not suggesting that, I'm just making that as a thump string for this green chunk.
00:23:45.676 - 00:23:55.384, Speaker B: Starting in October 16, what's the explanation of how that went from one percentage point to 15 percentage points of the market?
00:23:56.284 - 00:23:59.224, Speaker C: I need to look into the data to tell exactly particular.
00:24:00.684 - 00:24:07.200, Speaker B: Is there some story like how these things start and stay successful? Five years of other pools.
00:24:07.312 - 00:24:28.844, Speaker C: So in the paper we have some anecdotal evidences like showing, okay, how a pool is initiated and some of the, you can basically, like from the old early pools, you can just go back to bitcoin talk, right? So like they will tell. They basically market there, okay, I designed a pool, actually, I think the slush pool, the creator actually there was goes on months of discussions with the community, how should I actually design the pool?
00:24:30.264 - 00:24:49.364, Speaker A: Yeah, well, yeah, but the thing is, if these things are happening, then the assumption would be that when a new pool comes, they've got some novel marketing strategy or pricing strategy. If your model doesn't leave room for innovation in the pricing strategy, then how can you?
00:24:49.484 - 00:25:03.386, Speaker C: Well, the model is not trying to explain everything, right? This is the reality. The model is just trying to capture some of the most first order effect, right? So I mean, I try to explain to you in a model in a very simple way. I mean, look at the map, you're.
00:25:03.410 - 00:25:09.890, Speaker A: Just like, so according to the model, why would a new mining pool come into existence just because someone gets lucky? It's a small one.
00:25:09.922 - 00:25:25.886, Speaker C: So one reason could be like, which we didn't talk about. Like, for example, maybe just bitcoin price goes up, right? So maybe it means just like, the mining industry now just becomes larger, it becomes a larger market, so people want to join. So there's a lot of reasons which we had we don't consider in the paper. And intentionally, why wouldn't those people just.
00:25:25.910 - 00:25:27.634, Speaker A: Join an existing mining pool?
00:25:29.134 - 00:25:32.022, Speaker C: They can do that, too. I'm not saying that's not happening.
00:25:32.118 - 00:25:41.514, Speaker A: What's a possible reason within your model why a new mining pool, like that green one on the left hand side, might come into existence and suddenly get large?
00:25:41.894 - 00:25:45.814, Speaker C: This is a very good explanation. Very often you just have a large.
00:25:45.854 - 00:25:47.622, Speaker E: Miner that wants to buy his own.
00:25:47.678 - 00:25:51.670, Speaker C: Machines, so he sets up his own operation. He doesn't want to pay fees of.
00:25:51.702 - 00:25:53.400, Speaker E: 1% or whatever to somebody else.
00:25:53.542 - 00:25:58.024, Speaker C: And then he opens the, once he has the infrastructure, he opens it up to others to join.
00:25:58.444 - 00:26:12.660, Speaker E: So that could happen. Does your model take into account, like, not just different fees, but different reward systems? Because there's, like, at least five different ways of who gets which rewards.
00:26:12.772 - 00:26:44.864, Speaker C: So, yes, so, actually. So the main difference that we look at is, like, between those so called PPS pools versus other type of rewarding schemes. Because other type of rewarding schemes eventually would like to take. Just try to approximate your share of your hash rates as close as possible. Pay per share. So that's kind of fixed wage, right? Just like, as long as you are generating partial solutions, I'm just giving you constant money, regardless whether the pool fines or not. So our theory applies the best to the proportional pools.
00:26:45.624 - 00:27:17.254, Speaker E: One explanation besides what Aviv offered is it's very hard, like, once you have a big pool, to change the reward structure out from under the people, because they all sort of say, we signed up under this one formula, and now you want to change it. So every time someone comes up with any new wrinkle on, you know, like, randomized ppl and s or whatever, it has to, like, come into existence via a new pool rather than, like, changing an existing. So there's, like, a lot of room for people to say, like, oh, we've tweaked it and we have a slightly more fair rewards.
00:27:17.714 - 00:27:40.214, Speaker C: Well, I'm. I mean, in terms of technology, just technical wise, it's not difficult, but just like, whether it's an optimal solution from the pool's perspective, it may be another story, because you don't. Just you. You want to have some stability in your pool's operation. Right? Okay, are we good? To move on to the next paper. Okay, good. Thanks for all the comments.
00:27:40.214 - 00:28:31.178, Speaker C: So, yeah, so the next paper is we're going to be talking about initial coin offerings. So also, just assuming when I present this to finance audience, I need to go through a length about talking about the background of initial coin offerings and tokens. But I think for this audience it's really not necessary. So we understand what tokens are. So when I began to look into the tokens and icos, when I thought, okay, well, some of the kind of most famous examples, right, Ethereum, Filecoin and what they're trying to do, they're basically trying to facilitate decentralized platforms. And what are, I think, a defining feature of this decentralized platform is that their so called network effect, basically because they're facilitating trades between buyers and sellers, the buyer cares about the seller's presence and the seller cares about the buyer's presence. So in the community, we sometimes call it chicken and egg problem.
00:28:31.178 - 00:29:08.000, Speaker C: If you don't have the buyer, how could you attract the seller? If you already have the buyer, then you automatically have the seller. And using economic terms, right, it's basically just so called a coordination game. In any type of coordination games, there are usually to be multiple Nash equilibria. There could be a good equilibrium. Everybody joins and enjoy the benefits of the platform, or a bad equilibrium, or you can call it a coordination failure, just because people believing that other side is not going to be joining, I choose not to join too. And if you think about, if you are any startup trying to launch such a platform, you always start from this coordination failure. There is no existing customers to your platform in the first place.
00:29:08.000 - 00:29:56.198, Speaker C: So our idea is that whether tokens could be a way to jumpstart a platform to avoid us getting stuck in this coordination failure stage. And so we can move on to like a good outcome, good coordination outcome. So this is what we try to do in this paper. So in order to do that, we designed a very simple model to describe the operation of a platform. So of course, again, just for the sake of a model, right, you can think about, you can talk about a lot of realistic details that need to enter into the model, but it's made to be simple intentionally. So there's a demand side and a supply side of a platform operation. And every day there are going to be two, two users, sorry, there is going to be one user on each side that is showing up.
00:29:56.198 - 00:30:48.066, Speaker C: We just call them Alice and Bob. So the way we model this is that today Alice is going to be demanding the service. And tomorrow Alice is going to be supplying the service. And then just, we alternate between dates, and the date just runs, and the timeline just runs forever. And for anyone who is on the demand side, if you get a service that is fulfilled, then today you will get a surplus, which we called s. And if you provide the service to the other side today, then you incur a cost, which we call the c. And also we assume that there's some utility cost to you for you just to participate in this platform, just regardless of whether you get your service fulfilled or whether you actually provide the service or not, as long as you participate for one day, you just need to pay that utility cost and we have a discount rate.
00:30:48.066 - 00:31:44.040, Speaker C: The usual assumption is that if coordination is successful, this platform generates value to the users. So this condition holds. If this condition doesn't hold, then this platform essentially is a shitcoin that we should not be talking about anyway. But even if this project is valuable, even if this condition holds because of this participation cost, if Alice does not expect Bob to show up today, Alice will also choose not to show up. So even if a potentially useful platform may still be, have coordination failure because of this coordination effect. Okay, so how do we solve this model? I'm not intending to have here to read this, but just like, just give you an idea, this is actually going to be the solution concept. And what we're going to be using is going to be some idea called weakly sequential equilibrium and refined by foreign induction.
00:31:44.040 - 00:31:47.204, Speaker C: I'm going to give them, explain them in detail later.
00:31:47.784 - 00:31:53.376, Speaker B: So this is usually used sequential equilibrium for games with imperfect information?
00:31:53.520 - 00:31:53.960, Speaker C: Yes.
00:31:54.032 - 00:31:57.616, Speaker B: What's imperfect about this model? Like, what secret does Alice and Bob.
00:31:57.760 - 00:32:01.284, Speaker C: Have about the, whether they are going to join or not?
00:32:01.584 - 00:32:05.976, Speaker B: So the types of Alice are like the days on which they're going to be a supplier, the days on which.
00:32:06.000 - 00:32:31.104, Speaker C: They'Re going to be. This is known to that. Everybody knows that. Okay, today is Alice's buyer, tomorrow Bob is the buyer, then Alice is the buyer, Bob is buyer. This is commonly known. What is unknown as the game evolves is that from Bob's perspective, I don't know whether Alice actually, Alice is on the demand side today, but whether she is really going to hop on the platform, actually demand the service, this is unknown to Bob. Same for Alice.
00:32:31.104 - 00:32:40.108, Speaker C: Alice doesn't addis note that Bob is a potential service provider, but whether he truly provides a service or not, that's unknown.
00:32:40.196 - 00:32:47.676, Speaker B: So the roles are fixed, but they're prices at which the supply demand price is essentially what the uncertainty's about.
00:32:47.820 - 00:33:01.404, Speaker C: No, it's about whether the existence, the quantity, right. The existence of the supply and the demand is uncertain, right? Is that clear?
00:33:02.504 - 00:33:05.048, Speaker F: This is nothing blockchain specific so far, right?
00:33:05.096 - 00:33:32.628, Speaker C: So far I'm just talking about the platform operation. I'm just modeling the platform operation. Now later on I'm going to say, okay, how this token plays a role here. So now just to set a benchmark, right? So I'm going to first look at, okay, what if this platform just use dollars? Maybe just like eBay, right? Alice use dollars. If Alice wants to buy the service, Alice pays dollars and see what's going to happen. And then later on we'd see, ok, what if we change these dollars into tokens and see what's going to happen. And the result of course is going to be as expected, right.
00:33:32.628 - 00:34:11.350, Speaker C: It should be different. Otherwise there's no way for us to write the paper. So, ok, so, ok, so now let's look at, ok, Alice can use dollars to buy the service from Bob. Let's see whether this coordination problem is still going to persist. So in the ideal case, Alice pays Bob the money and the service is conducted, then at least Alice is happy. The question is from Bob's perspective, this comes to your question about the uncertainty, right? What's the imperfect information? Bob doesn't really know what actions Alice is truly going to take. Whether Alice, first of all, whether Alice has the money or not.
00:34:11.350 - 00:34:42.184, Speaker C: Maybe Alex just doesn't really have the money. If Alice doesn't have the money then I would not be able to. When I provide the service, there is nobody actually going to be buying the service. So Bob should be worried about this. Second is even Bob is sure that Alice does have the money. Your still concern is because the us dollars can be used outside of the platform. Alice having a pile of banknotes in her pocket doesn't necessarily mean that she's actually going to spend that amount of money within this platform.
00:34:42.184 - 00:35:07.844, Speaker C: So Bob still left worried about, okay, whether Alice is actually going to participate or not. Again, it becomes a coordination problem. So the coordination problem cannot really be solved by using dollars as a payment method within a platform economy. So now let's take as you can expect right now, let's look at what if we replace dollars with tokens?
00:35:08.444 - 00:35:14.668, Speaker B: So your argument is because dollars have like some substitute, you can buy substitute goods with those dollars.
00:35:14.716 - 00:35:45.258, Speaker C: You have outside use of money. You have outside use of money and also there's no transparency about your ownership of dollar. So two concerns from Bob's perspective, whether you have money or not. Even if you have money, oops, even you have money, you may be spending somewhere else. Bob is not certain whether Alice is going to be demanding the service, so it makes hard for him to decide whether I actually want to provide the service or not. Now, let's look at token. Token has two features.
00:35:45.258 - 00:36:28.554, Speaker C: I'm not saying that's universal across all tokens, but at least for a lot of tokens, it does have this feature. First is that the ownership of token is very transparent. You can look up the blockchain and figure out, okay, whether Alice has token or not. Second, a lot of tokens, they are designed specifically for a platform. So if Bob can know that Alice has the token, Bob knows that the token cannot really be used anywhere else. So the transparency of the blockchain makes the ownership of token certain to Bob. And also the token doesn't really have any outside use with outside of the platform.
00:36:28.554 - 00:37:06.734, Speaker C: That makes sure that Bob sees, okay, if Alice has a token, if she wants to use it, she has to use it to me. So it increases the confidence for Bob that, ok, actually I'm going to expect a coordination success. So you're assuming that you can identify all the token buyers in this model? Yeah. So actually it should be within this model. It would be that within this stage on the equilibrium path, whoever owns the token should be the buyer. If you are not a buyer, actually there shouldn't be any reason for you to own the token yet. This will become clear once I introduce icos, because I haven't talked about icos.
00:37:06.734 - 00:37:09.594, Speaker C: Now I just assume that this token just magically exists.
00:37:11.174 - 00:37:18.786, Speaker D: Yes, transfer tokens, because otherwise we have, instead of giving it to Bob, I can sell my token for dollars.
00:37:18.950 - 00:37:51.684, Speaker C: Yeah, but then the question is, like for those who buy the, like, if you're selling the token to me and you think about why I want to buy the token, and I probably presume that I want to use the service later, right? Because otherwise, why would I buy it from you? The last buy just there could be a chain of transactions, but the last buyer should be able, should be willing to spend the token on the platform. Because otherwise, otherwise, I mean there's one possibility that otherwise they're just a perpetual bubble, which we think about is bubble can exist in the short run, but I wouldn't think there should be a perpetual bubble.
00:37:52.944 - 00:37:54.888, Speaker F: That's what's happened so far, right?
00:37:55.056 - 00:38:38.872, Speaker C: Well, we are not in perpetual yet. How many years with tokens? There's also the question of, okay, I've got dollars. Suppose that there's somebody offering the same service for dollars. Why would I do this platform? So could you say that, that I can buy the same service elsewhere? Yeah, yeah, yeah. So that you're talking about the previous slides, right? Just like dollars have outside users, but a token user, there's other sources of the same service. Yeah, it could be. But like, but like if you have, suppose that there are two, suppose there are two platforms that provides the same service, but this token, like we are talking about platform one, and the token that Alice has is the token that can be used in platform one.
00:38:38.872 - 00:39:11.624, Speaker C: Even though alice want to use the same, Alice can potentially get the same service from platform two. She doesn't really have the token from platform two. So we haven't talked about icos yet. You think about what is ICO? We just mentioned the token and the token just coming out of thin air. But we know that when a token is created, it has to be distributed to the users in the first place. And this typically happens before the platform starts operation. And we can think about that as an ICO.
00:39:11.624 - 00:39:58.164, Speaker C: So we just move the timeline one slot ahead and add a previous stage before the entire platform operation starts. And this is a time when IcO happens. And what does IcO do? Ico, Alice comes up with some money, or not necessarily Us dollar here. It could be bitcoin, ethereum, or us dollars, just sum of money that is not intrinsic to this platform. Yet Alice spends some real resources and exchange that into token, and then she can carry the token to the next period. And then the game just operates as what we have just described earlier. So okay, now you think about what does Alice, what does adding this IcO stage actually does for all the players here.
00:39:58.164 - 00:41:22.344, Speaker C: So from Bob, Bob's perspective, he can transparently observe Alice's ownership of the token, and he also knows that the token doesn't really have any use outside of this platform. So by observing Alice having token today, on the first day of the platform operation, what Bob can infer is that Alice has taken some very costly action, that is spending real resources and buying into something that doesn't have any use outside of this platform. What does this tell Bob? If Bob believed that Alice is a rational person, then Bob should infer that Alice will be intending to use this token. If Alice do not ever intend to use this token, it will be silly for Alice to spend real resources into buying, into buying into this token. So this is kind of a way, at least we can kind of resolve the coordination problem when the first stage, and this is what I previous mentioned, is like when we use this weekly sequential equilibrium as a solution concept. And the line of argument that I have just talked about is actually what we call a forward induction refinement of game outcomes. So forward induction basically means that in a dynamic game, when you can observe some other players past behaviors, especially if they take some behaviors that kind of look stupid, you should infer that it tells, reveals some information about your future actions.
00:41:22.344 - 00:41:47.016, Speaker C: Some of the seemingly stupid actions that have taken in the past probably should tell you that it's part of a grand strategy of this entire game, which is supposed to be good for that player. This basically is based on the assumption that you believe that the other side is rational. Yes. Many people also buy tokens with the assumption that it will just go up, not because they will use it.
00:41:47.060 - 00:41:47.644, Speaker A: Right.
00:41:48.264 - 00:42:17.744, Speaker C: So therefore, how does it play a role in this model? So some of these people are, may not necessarily be rational, right? So, and like, if you believe buying token is going to give me, give you a lot of money, we can look at the performance of 90% of the tokens, right? So this does build on a strong assumption that everybody believe in each other. Just in typical game theory, you believe that everybody is going to be rational. If some people are irrational, then we just need to wait for the market to mature so then the model will apply better.
00:42:19.604 - 00:42:35.876, Speaker F: So when people design these tokens, a lot of times aren't they kind of balancing between the appeal of them as a speculative asset? Because that's what kind of gets you over that initial hump. That's what gets these coins out there.
00:42:35.900 - 00:42:36.904, Speaker C: In the first place.
00:42:37.764 - 00:42:41.834, Speaker F: They buy one of these tokens, they're not, there's nothing to use it on yet.
00:42:41.874 - 00:42:42.534, Speaker C: Usually.
00:42:45.034 - 00:42:53.434, Speaker F: I think what you're pointing out is that if you go too far in that direction, then nobody's ever going to use them and then your advantage of the platform evaporates.
00:42:53.554 - 00:43:29.348, Speaker C: Yeah. So I think currently, I think you give a very kind of precise kind of description about the current status quo. What my hope is that as people understand this theory better, I hope that eventually people will see that actually what the value comes or what the value of a token that really have is actually coming from its usage within the platform rather than this speculation part. Well, actually that speculation part may actually hurt you. So we have to assume, we have to admit that currently in the market, not all players are rational. Not because they are stupid, because this is a new concept. We are still learning about it.
00:43:29.436 - 00:43:34.986, Speaker F: Also, some tokens can be designed such that the speculative part is not irrational, it's actually built in.
00:43:35.140 - 00:43:41.486, Speaker C: That's like security tokens. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like security tokens, it still is designed.
00:43:41.510 - 00:43:47.126, Speaker F: To go up in value the more it's used within the infrastructure. So you basically have both reasons that are both rational.
00:43:47.230 - 00:44:41.082, Speaker C: So if we think about more complicated problem, there's a more comprehensive problem, right. We need to think about, okay, the tokens can play this role here and maybe also have the security role. And whether it's a good idea to combine them together, or maybe like some, some projects they do, they kind of have separate tokens, some tokens to be really just security tokens, and some tokens which is meant to be a utility. That's kind of another discussion that we can build on what we have learned here. So this is the idea of so called forward induction. Sometimes when I talk to laypeople, I say, okay, how can you understand this? Why does taking some bad actions in the past may actually signal some good actions in the future? Some examples I give people is like, look at why when a man proposed to a woman, he gives him a ring, a diamond ring. From my perspective, a diamond ring is expensive and it's completely useless, and it's very costly for the man to take that action.
00:44:41.082 - 00:44:59.124, Speaker C: So from the woman's perspective, okay, you take a kind of stupid action, but we know that's not stupid, right? Because you are taking this costly action and you signal to the other person, yeah, I truly love you. That's why I give you that I'm willing to spend those money and on something that's completely useful, so it actually serves a role. I don't know how well that plays.
00:45:01.464 - 00:45:07.864, Speaker B: Have you described the equilibrium strategy on this slide, or are you, is there a future slide to explain the equilibrium?
00:45:07.944 - 00:45:35.468, Speaker C: The equilibrium would be under this forward induction refinement that the solution would be Alice buys the token, participates, and the unique equilibrium would be so that satisfied foreign induction. ICO has the token, and both parties will always just join the platform as the platform operates. And the reason is because Bob knows now, okay, Alice has taken some costly action and it would be unwise for her to not spend the token.
00:45:35.516 - 00:45:39.796, Speaker B: So is this forward induction like in a sequential equilibrium, you also have to have beliefs about everybody else?
00:45:39.820 - 00:45:40.424, Speaker C: Yes.
00:45:40.724 - 00:45:46.504, Speaker B: Is that forward induction part only to justify the beliefs that. So the belief is that every day there will be participants.
00:45:46.644 - 00:46:20.196, Speaker C: Forward induction basically is a restriction, a refinement on the belief. So my belief is that if I saw your past actions, I would infer that it signals what you're going to do in the future. Because I'm going to rule out any future actions that, when combined with your past action, looks kind of silly from your side for the entire game. So I can see your seemingly silly actions until today, but that tells me, okay, this must be part of some smart strategies then.
00:46:20.260 - 00:46:24.516, Speaker B: I mean, given that I spent dollars on the first day, are you saying you cannot commit?
00:46:24.620 - 00:46:35.620, Speaker C: You cannot commit because the dollars can be used in other places. And also dollars doesn't really have this transparency. I don't know how much money you have, but I can observe how many tokens you have.
00:46:35.732 - 00:46:44.672, Speaker B: So you're saying this doesn't work in a, in a currency like anonymous, sort of a privacy friendly currency like zcash?
00:46:44.768 - 00:47:01.684, Speaker C: In the current framework, no. And whether it can be accommodated, that needs to be future research. But based on what I have now, then the answer is no. Both the transparency and the fact that it doesn't really have any use outside, other platform, outside of this platform are important for the results.
00:47:04.054 - 00:47:27.910, Speaker D: I still don't get something basic. So you have a token, utility token. You can use it in the platform, you can't use for anything else. Look at a cryptocurrency that's not a utility token, then it looks like exactly the same, except there's no platform that you like, you can't use it for anything, but it still has value. So why doesn't this, like, somehow if this analysis should hold, then bitcoin should be worth zero, right?
00:47:27.982 - 00:47:41.210, Speaker C: This is like my, well, I mean, I'm here providing a theory of explaining why some tokens can have value. It doesn't preclude other theories of explaining. Like, so there could be other theories explaining the value of bitcoin.
00:47:41.362 - 00:47:45.602, Speaker D: That's just this token would have value outside of the system as well.
00:47:45.658 - 00:48:07.680, Speaker C: So it also depends on how you actually define what's the scope of the system. Because you can think about, I mean, compared to dollar, right? Bitcoin still have very limited use. Compared to the platform, bitcoin has very general use. So I mean, the model is kind of generic enough. I didn't really specify what's the scope of this. Right. You can think about what type of service that Alice and Bob can provide to each other.
00:48:07.680 - 00:48:13.644, Speaker C: If it's very restricted, then it could be a specific platform. If it's less, a little bit more general, it would be dollars.
00:48:15.384 - 00:48:41.538, Speaker D: Commitment only works if they really cannot use a token anywhere else. Cannot use the token anywhere else. They have to make the argument that it cannot turn into a form of money because, because then I could just sell it and people would want to buy it because they could do anything with it, just medium of exchange. If this cannot turn into form of money, then it seems to argue in the same way that other cryptocurrencies should also not turn into money, because they're just worse than this one. They don't even have this basic.
00:48:41.706 - 00:49:17.638, Speaker C: And also there's. Yeah, that's a good point. Also, there's another point is like what we want to prevent is that you're currently here before the ICO and there's nobody on your platform, and you want to really just shift from one equilibrium to another equilibrium in which everybody joins. So a lot of times the token, when it's first launched, it really has very limited use. Over time. It may gain a lot of use outside of platform if it's possible, but at that time, you guys are already now on the good equilibrium. So you can think about really the role of having the theory it applies to the entire game.
00:49:17.638 - 00:49:22.006, Speaker C: But what's most important is actually at the beginning of the game. Yes.
00:49:22.150 - 00:49:42.514, Speaker A: So usually if you have a coin that's a medium of exchange, you might send it to somebody for a service, maybe coin is truly a utility token. You're not actually sending it to someone, you're potentially burning it as a fee. And some blockchains send the fees to, some just burn the fee.
00:49:44.804 - 00:49:59.144, Speaker C: You can think about that as kind of the participation cost of youth somewhere here. Whether your transaction goes through or not, whether you actually get the service or not, there's some cost for you to participate.
00:50:00.484 - 00:50:11.916, Speaker A: No, I understand, but I'm saying, what if that money doesn't, what if the token gets consumed instead of going to Bob? Like, what if the blockchain itself is providing utility instead of some counterpart?
00:50:12.020 - 00:50:27.344, Speaker C: Oh, so then it would be kind of a different model. Because I'm saying that some of the platforms, we can understand why tokens have used for those platforms, but I'm not saying that all icos are supporting platforms that look like this.
00:50:28.004 - 00:50:30.044, Speaker A: So what's an example that does look like this?
00:50:30.124 - 00:51:26.844, Speaker C: I think decentralized storage would be an example. So, and actually this kind of forward induction argument, right? You can just actually go one step ahead and you can see that just that we can sustain a efficient coordination in every period. The difficulty comes from, like, what if, like, there's now so far, like, there's, there's one player on each side? What if there are multiple players on, on both sides? So there's, I'm gonna skip that. Like, there's some, some discussions about how we could extend the model in our paper. So if there's any. No questions, I'm going to jump to the final thing I'm going to talk about. Okay, so the final project is, as I said when I originally did this, it's not actually intended for bitcoin or blockchain, but as later on I figure out, okay, actually it may have some implications there.
00:51:26.844 - 00:52:14.416, Speaker C: The idea is that, ok, we believe that in the startup space or just the consumer space, there is this concept, so called wisdom of the crowd. The collective opinion of a large group of individuals is often found to dominate the judgment of a single expert. If you can source opinions from a lot of people, you would like to do that. Why does it exist? Simple law of large number argument, because everybody has some idiosyncratic noise in their assessment. If you combine them, you can cancel them out. Now the question is, okay, if we are talking about investing in a project, how can we best harness this collective wisdom? And this is what we want to do, and the solution that we provide, quote unquote, is going to be some contracting solutions. I call it smart contract.
00:52:14.416 - 00:52:58.630, Speaker C: It's not really smart contract in our familiar sense. So as long as we understand this example, we can understand this entire paper. It's a very simple example. Two investors, Alice and Bob, they're participating in funding a risky and a scalable project. So the independent decide on how much money to commit to the project, and when they commit to, when they decide on how much money to put into this project, right? So they basically do their optimal return and risk trade off. And it was zoomed that the players are deep pocketed, so there's no financing constraints. So basically how much money you put in is really just a trade off between your return and your risk.
00:52:58.630 - 00:54:01.122, Speaker C: And both investors, they have some private information about what the return of the project is, and because they're so called wisdom of the crowd. So if the players, they can of the two investors, Alex and Bob, they can talk to each other before making their investment decisions and gather two sources of information, then both of them will be able to make more informed decisions. Suppose that for whatever reason, maybe just in a very decentralized world, there's some problem that they cannot really truthfully communicate their private information. Is there a way for us to divide the payoff from their joint investment so that we can also replicate the effect of direct communication? So this is the kind of the solution that we're trying to provoke. The question that we try to answer, and the solution will be a specific type of contract that we can write and we can now talk about, okay, whether this type of contract will have any implications for designing icos or for designing daos. Any questions on the question that we're trying to. What I'm trying to look at? All right.
00:54:01.122 - 00:54:47.870, Speaker C: The typical solution, which I will call a common stock, is that if we make a joint investment, then let's divide our payoff in proportion to the amount of money that we originally commit. If Alice has invested more, then Alice should get a larger share. That's what we call common stock. Question, is this really optimal? And I have an alternative proposal that if the only difference between Alice and Bob is their private information, I propose that maybe the optimal contracting solution for Alice to divide the project payoff is for them to equally divide the project payoff. I'm going to show you why this is the case, and I call this profit sharing. If there are better terms, I would welcome suggestions. So far.
00:54:47.870 - 00:55:26.710, Speaker C: I call this equal sharing as profit sharing contract. Just to make it very concrete, what do I exactly mean? Suppose that there is a project, and it turns out the return of the project is 10%. If Alice invests in $200 and Bob invests in $100, then according to this traditional common stock assumption, everybody's payoff is going to be proportional to their original investment. So then Alice will be entitled to two thirds of the proceeds, and Bob entitled to one third of the proceeds. Total investment, 200 plus 100, that's 300. Return is 10%. So the total, eventually we get the project returns 332 thirds of it.
00:55:26.710 - 00:56:08.242, Speaker C: Alice gets 220, and Bob gets 110. So now let's say what if Alice and Bob equally divide their payoff? Suppose that Alice and Bob still invest in 201 hundred and the project, the net payoff from the project is going to be. Right, 200 plus 100, multiplied by 10%, that is $30. So when I say equal divide, that means that they equally divide this net payoff. So what Alice gets back is her original investment, which is 200 plus one half of that, $30. So Alice gets back 115. I'm sorry, 215.
00:56:08.242 - 00:56:54.996, Speaker C: And Bob gets back 115. And this is what I mean by an equal sharing contract. If you stare at this, you're going to ask, if I'm Alice, why would I prefer this than this, right? In traditional equity contract, I can get back 220. Now I can only get back 215. It looks like a very silly deal for Alice. But here is that we are making a restriction, is that when the contract changes among Alice and Bob, we assume the optimal investment amount for them also doesn't change. But in reality, this is not the case, actually, this refers to when my previous talk about the mining pools, we said, okay, if we join a pool, you are better protected for your risk, then you should be willing to put in more money into mining.
00:56:54.996 - 00:57:22.576, Speaker C: Here is also the case. If we have a 50 50 sharing contract among our payoffs, both from Alice and Bob's perspective, both investors are better protected for their risk, so they should be willing to put in more money into this project. So if we look at the optimal investment amount for Alice, then by a 50 50 rule, Alice should actually be entitled to a small, smaller piece of a larger pie, which turns out to be actually still better than Alice.
00:57:22.760 - 00:57:26.088, Speaker A: Yes, because you're saying on the downside, they would both lose the same amount as well.
00:57:26.136 - 00:57:26.608, Speaker C: That's right.
00:57:26.696 - 00:57:29.284, Speaker A: What if Bob is totally wiped out?
00:57:30.264 - 00:57:32.632, Speaker C: Then he's totally wiped out, but then.
00:57:32.688 - 00:57:38.302, Speaker A: Alice is going to lose, is going to lose more. Bob can only lose dollar 100. Alice could lose more than $100.
00:57:38.398 - 00:57:57.274, Speaker C: You are assuming the limited liability here. Yeah, I'm getting away from limited liability. Yeah, I see. So just illustration. Under common stock, if you invest, your investment is 201 hundred. And this here is 50 50 sharing. The project goes by 10%.
00:57:57.274 - 00:58:30.412, Speaker C: This is how the traditional equity contract is going to give you. And this is what the profit sharing contract is going to give you, assuming that the optimal investment amount doesn't change, just giving it one slide. But if we take the optimal investment amount under the profit sharing, then on average, both Alice and Bob will invest more. So in this case, Alice will be entitled to a smaller piece of a larger pie, which turns out to be, on average, risk adjusted, will be larger than the payoff that she gets from here. Yes.
00:58:30.508 - 00:58:46.452, Speaker A: So what does your investment size even mean if you get rid of limited liability? I mean, if Alice and Bob, if Alice put in 200, Bob put in 100, and each can lose a million dollars, or each can make a million dollars. Like, why does it matter what your initial investment is?
00:58:46.588 - 00:58:50.104, Speaker C: The initial investment, just how much money that we put into this project.
00:58:52.284 - 00:59:00.324, Speaker A: But since you can lose more than that anyway, you're effectively exposing yourself to unlimited liability. So it's not really how much money you put into the project.
00:59:01.384 - 00:59:08.328, Speaker C: You can say that. You can say that. That's like if you join a partnership firm, that's basically like that in terms of outcomes.
00:59:08.376 - 00:59:19.328, Speaker A: Like what's a scenario in which it matters how much I put into the firm, into the investment under your proposed.
00:59:19.416 - 00:59:39.540, Speaker C: So if, suppose that like the project return is 10%. If you originally put in a lot of money into this, that means that 10% is going to apply to a large chunk of money. Also, if it's lost, then also applies to a large chunk of money. If you only commit a very small amount of money, that whatever return just only operates on that very small amount of money.
00:59:39.612 - 01:00:21.354, Speaker A: There's two things that matter. It's like how big the overall bet is and then what the return is in a percentage. So you're saying whether I invest 100% or $1,000 or whether the total pot is 100 or 1000, were sort of equally likely to get a 10% win or a 10% loss or something. And so it's almost like, it's not really like you're putting in money. It's like you're just choosing how big the bet could be. So in a weird way, like if you put in a dollar, I could put in a million dollars, and then if the thing goes down by 10%, you, you've just lost $100,000. So you're actually like increasing other people's liability by.
01:00:21.434 - 01:00:58.104, Speaker C: It's very weird, but from my perspective, in expectation, I should be better off partnering with you because I believe, again, it's game theory, so I believe you are rational. The reason why you're willing to put in $100 or $1 million is you have either very good signal or just you are very confident about your signal. And so basically, most likely you're going to win the bet, because otherwise it would be silly for you to put in a million, commit a million dollars to it. So there's some slight chance that I'm going to be completely screwed up. But on average, I'm happy that you actually kind of joined force with you.
01:00:58.184 - 01:01:06.164, Speaker A: If I want, I could do, let's say I think it's a really good bet, then I should mount the Sybil attack and join a million times as $1.
01:01:06.754 - 01:01:35.794, Speaker C: Not really, actually. So this actually is a very easy, very common thing to think about, but actually. So what goes on is if you amount your civil attack, you basically divide your wealth in half. So basically the risk aversion of each of your clone now is going to be different. So the optimal share that you want to have in the pie will be different. Actually, we can show that it's kind of simple resistance. You can do simple attack, but it doesn't make any difference to you.
01:01:36.534 - 01:01:51.574, Speaker A: It could be that my optimal share of the profits isn't one out of n for an investor, therefore, just not even nefariously. I'm saying what I really want is like one third of this company to belt enough times to get a third of the profits or something.
01:01:51.654 - 01:02:27.494, Speaker C: So the general result is that if I have n investors and each of them has risk aversion, row I, then your share should be basically the inverse risk aversion we call risk tolerance, should be your share of the total risk tolerance. So in the example I gave you earlier is that assume that both of them are equally risk averse. The only difference is their information, then equal sharing is good for them. But here is that the sharing rule should be dependent on their risk aversion. What does this risk aversion parameter mean? The risk aversion parameter just is like the curvature of your, roughly speaking, is your curvature of your utility curve.
01:02:29.874 - 01:02:52.694, Speaker A: But it seems like there's almost like two separate questions. How many tickets do you want and how much money do you want to park in this organization's bank account? And you could almost, like, just separate those questions. You're saying right now, like, you buy shares, and that's how you fund the thing, but decouple that, just fund it. If you have shares and you think it'll do well with your money.
01:02:53.164 - 01:03:37.844, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Does mechanism survive as part of a portfolio where everything else is common stock? Yes. It survives this because you can think about. So one way to think about, okay, if I have a portfolio, I kind of diversify against whatever risk, the individual risk of each investment. However, the source of the risk here comes from the fact that we actually don't know what the, what the actual return, the distribution of the return is. Each of us has a private information somehow useful. And the risk sharing benefit comes from kind of canceling out the noises in everybody's information about the return of that one stock, rather than, like, diversifying about the risk of all the stocks.
01:03:37.844 - 01:04:04.724, Speaker C: So another way to think about is like, if you think about this, instead of thinking about this as an individual investment project, think about this as a portfolio, and all the idiosyncratic risk will be canceled out, and only systematic risk will be remain. And you can think about that like, the information that we have or the noise that we face is noise in our assessment about what the systematic risk would be. How good your time?
01:04:08.424 - 01:04:10.240, Speaker B: You have like ten minutes.
01:04:10.312 - 01:04:33.670, Speaker C: I have ten minutes. Oh, that's more than I, that's more than I thought. Okay, but then I can, then let's entertain some math. There's nothing new. Just formalizing what I have just said. Two investors, they have a utility function that captures their risk aversion, and they are investing in the project. Each of them have a private signal investor.
01:04:33.670 - 01:05:09.754, Speaker C: I has a private signal, Si, which is the return, true return, plus some idiosyncratic noise and idiosyncratic noise. We assume that it follows a normal distribution. It doesn't have to be. But just for the simplicity, let's assume that it forms a normal distribution. One thing is that, okay, what if Alice. Alice and Bob, they invest in so called common stock? Then common stock basically says, okay, your payoff is basically solely dependent on how much you have invested in. So you look at your investment outcome coming out of this, and you take the expected utility.
01:05:09.754 - 01:05:54.734, Speaker C: When you take the expectation, the only source that you can information that you can conditional on is what private information you have. And you can easily solve this. You can solve this expression and can find that, okay, the optimal investment amount should be a weighted sum of what the unconditional mean of the return, of the return of the project and my private signal. And they are going to be weighted by what is the preciseness of the true return and the preciseness of my information. If my information is very precise, this term will be large. I will be more reliant on my private information. And, of course, everything is going to be normalized by how risk averse I am.
01:05:56.434 - 01:05:57.964, Speaker B: What is Tau R here?
01:05:58.074 - 01:06:39.458, Speaker C: Tau is the precision of. Tau R is the precision of the unconditional precision of the precision is basically just inverse of the variance of the return itself. The return follows a distribution, and this is the inverse of the variance of your private information. If this goes up, that means the variance of your risk aversion is very small. You're going to be more reliant on your private information. Information. What if, just as a benchmark, right? What if Alice and Bob can talk to each other? If Alice and Bob can talk to each other, for each investor, they're still solving the same problem.
01:06:39.458 - 01:06:58.784, Speaker C: But when take the expected utility, they're now going to be conditional on two signals, and you can also very easily solve that. And you find that the optimal investment under that scheme would be the weighted sum of also the unexpected unconditional mean and both signals. And they're going to be weighted by the precision of both signals.
01:06:59.164 - 01:07:10.228, Speaker B: If they can talk to each other, then this, like, you know, almond thing about you can't, you cannot agree to disagree. So eventually, if they communicate, they'll eventually have the same prior, right?
01:07:10.276 - 01:08:13.394, Speaker C: Like, well, that doesn't really apply here, because you can think about the Alice and Bob here, there's, like we say there are two players, but actually, you can think about it. There are three players, right? Another player is whoever actually is providing this investment opportunity. Nature, the nature, you can think about nature or just like an entrepreneur who's selling this product. Yes, yes, yes. So now this interesting case, and also where, that's where the game theory became begin to kick in. So if I cannot talk to each other, but I have this so called sharing contract with others, then when I decide on how much I want to invest, not only my payoff, not only depends on how much I invest, but also depends on like what the other person invests, which is in turn is going to be a function about what their private information is. And when I take the expect, when I calculate the expected utility, I also need to conditional on my only, conditional on my own information.
01:08:13.394 - 01:08:59.994, Speaker C: So what I'm going to do. So here, my information enters my expectation in two ways. First, is going to help me decide on what the return of the project is. And also it's going to give me some guidance about how the other person is going to invest. So the solution will be, again, in Nash equilibrium, we are talking about game theory, the national equilibrium endure this contract would be, I have a correct belief about what the other person is going to invest based on their signal. Once I have, based on that belief, I'm going to choose what's my optimal investment amount. And in equilibrium, my counterparty's optimum investment amount will coincide with my belief about what you're going to do.
01:08:59.994 - 01:10:11.310, Speaker C: So basically, this Nash equilibrium, we can solve this Nash equilibrium. There are more sophisticated ways to do this, but just for simplicity, because previously we said okay, without this contract, my optimal investment amount should just be a weighted sum of the prior and just the unconditional mean of the return and my private signal. So I just like, let's say, let's assume that, okay, in this game, the solution also follows that form, and I just take undetermined coefficients and then plug into the optimization problem and try to solve what the optimal solution would be. And once we get the solution, then we can compare the solutions here. So, under a so called profit sharing contract that I just prescribed, the optimum investment amount for, this guy, again, is going to be a weighted sum of the unconditional mean and my private signal. And also it's going to be weighted by my risk aversion. However, you can see here is a double two.
01:10:11.310 - 01:10:43.602, Speaker C: And this is the concept that we talked about before. Once I have a profit sharing contract with the other person, I'm effectively better insured against the mistakes in my private information, because my private information is noisy. So I know that sometimes I make a mistake because I'm risk aversion. I may not fully listen to my information, but now I know there's someone who can shoulder the risk for me. I can be more sensitive to my information. So that's why my investment becomes more sensitive to my information. So both players is going to do that.
01:10:43.602 - 01:11:47.828, Speaker C: And because we know that because of wisdom of the crowd, although our information are noisy, but in average, all these information do carry some value. If in aggregate, all investors become more informed and more responsive to their private information, then the aggregate investment amount would just be more informed. So that is going to improve the capital allocation. Another thing that comes out of this is that if you look at the payoff from each individual investors coming from this, you can see that the payoff that he gets, it looks like this form. And if we compare the benchmark we had before it, just like if Alice and Bob can directly communicate with each other, the payoff they get is exactly the same. So another way we can think about this is like just having this contract, even though whenever it's difficult for the investors to talk to each other and aggregate their information, we can have a contract solution to, uh, uh, to, to do that. Right.
01:11:47.828 - 01:12:18.134, Speaker C: I think this contract is pretty smart, and. But, you know, I don't have the trademark, so I don't claim it's a smart contract. Right? Is it? Are there any questions on this? So, general case. Okay, so now let's talk about implications. When I first, uh, get this result right, which is. But the question would be, okay, I was actually thinking about crowdfunding. What would be the optimal contract? And there's no consensus in academia studying about what's the optimal contract.
01:12:18.134 - 01:13:25.454, Speaker C: Commonly, debt equity, or a hybrid of debt and equity are also used. So I think we at least provide a solution based on an information aggregation perspective. I'm not saying that there are other channels that we do not need to think about, but it's purely from an information aggregation perspective. This sharing contract, quote, unquote smart contract, seems like a pretty good solution, and it's very easy to implement. And also, it really captures this wisdom of crowd, because typically when you say, okay, when you think about, you do an ICO or you do crowdfunding, from the entrepreneurs perspective, what does wisdom and crowd mean here is that you are basically aggregating information from all the users, so you kind of have a better idea about what the demand for your product or what the demand for this particular project is. So it's the private information from the investor side that is benefiting the entrepreneurs, which is important. However, what we have here is that the investors who themselves have information now just through this contracting form, they can actually benefit from each other's private information.
01:13:25.454 - 01:14:02.162, Speaker C: So they bring the wisdom. They also, now they're also enjoy the wisdom among themselves. And because they can also improve capital allocation. If you are an entrepreneur who has a good project, this means that on average more money is going to be invested to you. It just improves the capital allocation across the entire entire market space. I'm going to skip some of those robust results. Just say, okay, what if a return is not random? What if the uh, information, you have to acquire the information with some cost.
01:14:02.162 - 01:14:39.634, Speaker C: What if the, the project is not constant return to scale, the result will hold. So I think I would just leave it here. We think about, I think about ICO is really kind of like uh, uh, doing, doing crowdfunding on the blockchain. So I think nothing here, I said, cannot be applied to uh, to, to icos. And actually, as a matter of fact, right. Because in a blockchain space, we can more easily write more flexible contracts and we can have better enforcement of some of the more innovative contract forms. So I think there should be a lot of use about potential, about this kind of, this new solution.
01:14:39.634 - 01:14:48.402, Speaker C: To say decentralized autonomous organization or initial coin offerings. Of course, the implications is something that we need to further think about.
01:14:48.418 - 01:14:53.494, Speaker A: Yes, but blockchains don't do unlimited liability well though.
01:14:53.874 - 01:15:37.254, Speaker C: That's correct. So there one solution, one way to get out of this because, oops. One way to get out of this is that there's one robustness result that I said, okay, I don't have to assume everything is normal. So if you think about it, the normal distribution, yeah, you can always have unlimited realizations. But this result actually is more general than just normal. So if you restrict your attention to some bounded distributions, then you can potentially avoid this care, limited liability problem. But it is true that if you invest a small amount of money into the project, it doesn't necessarily mean that, okay, your loss will always be small.
01:15:37.254 - 01:16:13.610, Speaker C: That's true, but it could be avoided that just like your loss is limited. That can be, that can be, that exists in the model, that doesn't exist in reality if we implement it. So I think, so all these stuff, you can just find it all the papers online. So by the end, just like we have constantly. Now, what I'm trying to do today is trying to look at those consensus protocols. And typically as an economist, as we do a game theory, we assume everybody to be rational. Whether that's a good assumption or not, that's another question.
01:16:13.610 - 01:16:38.434, Speaker C: But we tend to get used to that framework. When we look at those consensus protocols, we all assume, exogenously assume that some people are malicious, some people are byzantine, and some people are honest, and we find that very not particularly satisfied with that. So actually we're trying to do something that puts these consensus protocols into the rational framework. Turns out to be very difficult to do. So I'm still working on that. I wish I could talk about them more about this. That's all I can have today.
01:16:38.434 - 01:16:45.822, Speaker C: Thanks.
01:16:45.998 - 01:16:47.638, Speaker A: This is really thought provoking.
01:16:47.726 - 01:16:48.514, Speaker C: Thank you.
01:16:48.814 - 01:17:34.394, Speaker A: So I'm trying to imagine just to kind of like make it more intuitive because it seems so weird. If I were to try to like actually implement this using like instructions that people were familiar with, would it be, would one way to do this, would this be an implementation of this idea that we're doing a startup company and so the stock is free. Like anyone can have as much common stock as they want, but you're subject to, you have to be like, show that you have collateral and that you can support the liability. And then we only fund with debt, but there's bonds that don't pay any interest. But the reason you would want to, the reason you would want to buy these bonds is because you own, because you signed up for some stock and therefore you want the company to do something.
01:17:35.694 - 01:17:41.998, Speaker C: Let me try to piece everything together. So you said I only found them through bonds.
01:17:42.126 - 01:17:49.634, Speaker A: Well, essentially the question of how much money to dump in this company is now completely independent from what fraction of the profit or loss do I want. Right?
01:17:50.174 - 01:17:54.274, Speaker C: Yes. It's not completely independent, but it's attached to a certain extent. Yes.
01:17:55.004 - 01:18:02.204, Speaker A: I can sign up for stock and the stock is free. It's just exposing the liability or gifts. And then I can dump money into the company by buying bonds.
01:18:02.284 - 01:18:36.706, Speaker C: Yes. So, yes, actually you can think about this. That's a good point. It's kind of have some, you can implement it with some combination of bond and securities because you can think about, this is like pure equity and this has some bond features in it. You combine them and. Yes, and I think your point about the kind of what I'm actually eventually, potentially we committed to the project and versus like how much exposure of the, of the, just the surplus or loss from the project could be detached. It's kind of like the same response.
01:18:36.730 - 01:18:38.570, Speaker A: Because like you always made whole by.
01:18:38.642 - 01:18:40.138, Speaker C: Yes, yes, exactly. Exactly.
01:18:40.186 - 01:19:42.448, Speaker A: So then, so the thing that this, so this actually makes sense, but then the thing that it seems to be missing compared to the traditional model, which obviously is the scarcity that there's often this feeding frenzy of venture capitalists who, and because you have a five person startup that's going to grow to be 100 people, whatever, you can't necessarily spend a billion dollars, so there's only so much investment you can take. And often people actually take the most expensive money they can get, because then you get access to some better Rolodex or whatever. Okay, let's leave that aside. But still, this idea that it may be that there's more money than you can actually put to productive use, and therefore you'll use that to extract the premium from the scarcity of your stock. So that's now missing from this model. Is that some weird artificial thing or is there something, is that fundamentally something that makes sense to like that a company should be able to leverage the scale scarcity of the investment to carry a premium, to charge a premium?
01:19:42.616 - 01:19:57.204, Speaker C: That's a good point. I can think about a solution offline. An answer offline, I think it seems to be. Makes sense, but I need to double check. I don't want to say anything that I'm not sure of.
01:19:58.784 - 01:20:01.164, Speaker B: Let's thank the speaker and take a break.
01:20:06.404 - 01:20:08.724, Speaker C: I'm trying to understand the last comment that you said.
