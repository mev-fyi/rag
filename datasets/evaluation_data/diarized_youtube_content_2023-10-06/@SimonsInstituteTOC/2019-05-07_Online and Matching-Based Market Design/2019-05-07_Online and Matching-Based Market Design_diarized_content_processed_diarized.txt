00:00:01.080 - 00:00:31.544, Speaker A: At the same time as the blockchains program. So this is online and matching based market design. It's a program that's going to involve theoretical computer scientists, economists and operations research folks. And it's another experimental one in the sense that we're running a shorter format program. It's running for only six weeks with the hope of being able to involve, in an intensive and ongoing way, these, particularly the economists.
00:00:34.724 - 00:00:57.434, Speaker B: Is it visible or no? Yes, it is. Oh, there we go. And do I get a clicker? No. Okay. I'll have to speak out here. Okay, so that's the program, online and matching based market design. And there are five organizers.
00:00:57.434 - 00:01:24.554, Speaker B: Itai is an operations research person. Federico is a fabulous economist. Nicole, actually, there are six organizers because Nicole is a computer science person. But she always amazes me with how much economics she knows. So I count her as both. Honestly, she knows as much as Federico and liath combined. Okay.
00:01:24.554 - 00:02:15.980, Speaker B: Honestly, I know a thing or two about algorithmic part of economics, but I'm mainly an algorithms person. And Liat is a fabulous economist who just left, defected from Caltech to Princeton with a fabulously big chair. Anyway, so that's the team. And yeah, behind the scenes, Alroth will be a big supporter of this program. We'll talk about Alroth in a minute. But these are the kinds of markets that came about as all our lives moved onto online platforms, the Internet and mobile computing based platforms. And they are, they are not just ordinary markets that just got ported to the Internet.
00:02:15.980 - 00:03:00.012, Speaker B: These are new markets with amazingly new ideas. And because there are new markets, there are new ways of running them, and there are new questions altogether of an economic and algorithmic type that arise. And in fact, if you look at the sum total of all the, I don't know, the revenue or whatever, the involvement of these markets in the economy, it's a substantial fraction which keeps growing every year. And that's the amazing part. And there's no end to it, obviously. So one thing I should note here is that many of these markets are matching based. Like here you want to match queries to advertisers.
00:03:00.012 - 00:03:50.754, Speaker B: Here you want to match customers to cars. Here you want to match customers to rooms. These are where you want to match workforce to people who are hiring. Here you want to really match a man and a woman and so on. So what has this to do with online platforms matching? It should be ancient, right? It is. So the first matching based markets were designed in 1920s, pre Internet and pre computer allocating hospital residents in some hanky panky way, which actually turned out to be some aspect of stable matching. And then in the sixties, Gale and Shipley gave their fabulous algorithm, which made huge progress on this front.
00:03:50.754 - 00:04:38.554, Speaker B: And then there were many more matching based markets that came about, like kidney exchange, school choice, which is being run all over in big cities like New York and Boston. And eventually, in 2012, Al Roth and Lloyd Shapley got the Nobel in economics. Gail had already passed away, and that was the topic of their, I mean, that was the reason for their Nobel prize. And as I said, al Roth will be playing a substantial role in this program. He is at Stanford, and he'll come across often. He told me, okay, so what this program is about is not only the online ones, but also the matching ones. So I just combined the two lists.
00:04:38.554 - 00:05:23.774, Speaker B: And these markets use methodology from two disciplines. One, of course, is economics, which has been studying markets for the last 250 odd years, ever since Adam Smith 1976. Wealth of nations. And us who developed this very powerful algorithmic way of thinking, which we believe will revolutionize, will be sort of the, like the mathematics, the role that mathematics played as a key enabler of sciences in the last century. We believe algorithms will play in this century. And it's already becoming evident that this is a true statement. Let's hope it becomes even more true.
00:05:23.774 - 00:06:38.462, Speaker B: And of course, we have given very powerful algorithms, like the stable matching algorithm, maximum matching algorithms that go to design kidney exchange markets, budgeted allocation algorithms that go to do adverts problems and so on. So the amazing thing, the new thing about this program is that it's only six weeks long, because economists know the value of their time, okay? And they cannot just hang around. And so this is for the first time, we're going to bring together these two peoples under the same roof, namely this one, for an extended period of time, namely six weeks. So far, they only met over coffee at easy, if at all, okay? And then one outcome of this is a book on market design that's being put together by three people, three of the organizers of that year or program. There'll be 30 plus contributed chapters with the forward by Al Roth. And it's going to be in Cambridge University space. Okay? So the last two minutes, I want to give you a small case study.
00:06:38.462 - 00:07:27.970, Speaker B: Why do you to tell you about one market about which I know a few things, just to tell you how influential these markets are, these online markets. And I'll assume that this company is common knowledge among industry and university people. And in fact, this company has absolutely transformed our lives. Think about it. Half the people here are probably on Google right now. And it went public in 2004 with a market valuation of 23 billion, which was considered too high at this point, Google brings us search for free. It's happy to transform our lives for free.
00:07:27.970 - 00:08:14.334, Speaker B: Okay, yeah, I see that. Yeah, we know it's not free now, but nobody charges us 999 per month or so to use Google. Right? And there is what is paying for this free service that they are bringing us? Well, it's Google's Adwords market, which almost single handedly supports the entire multibillion dollar operation, as well as for whoever has stock in Google today. Here, the $780 billion valuation that this market has. So you can imagine how big the Adwords market is. It is gigantic. Okay? It's a gigantic, huge market.
00:08:14.334 - 00:08:54.690, Speaker B: And the amazing thing is that our field has played a key role here. In particular, algorithms have played a key role here. Algorithms, of course, have played a key role in search. Think of page rank. But here, there was a problem that came up in 2004, namely, these keywords were just being auctioned off to the highest bidder. And that was not the correct way to do things, because the bidders also declare a daily budget. And if you don't take that into consideration, the whole thing is hanky panky goes haywire.
00:08:54.690 - 00:09:54.844, Speaker B: And you have to take it into consideration because. Because there's a very heavy tail in the way people participate. The small budget people make up a huge fraction of the revenue of Google. And so we came across this problem in 2004 through Monica Hensinger, who was working in Google, and Arunach Mehta, who's here, the Google representative, and our representative here, we gave a very simple algorithm, optimal online algorithm, for budgeted auctions. And it's widely used by just about every search engine company, including Google. The amazing thing, probably I keep saying amazing, because it gets more and more amazing, but this time it's really amazing. The solution has its roots in pure theory, in matching theory, okay? In 1990, Dick Karp, who's here in the audience, and Umesh Mazarani, who came and left, probably, he told me on the phone.
00:09:54.844 - 00:10:25.166, Speaker B: Anyway, we gave this online bipartite matching algorithm also optimal. And the Google problem is a generalization of this in some ways, and restriction in some ways. And this was another very fine piece of work, of which also the Google problem is a generalization. This is online be matching. Okay, I'm done with all my amazing things. Any questions? Oh, so there'll be industry participation. Arunachal will be there.
00:10:25.166 - 00:10:42.554, Speaker B: Nikhil Devanur will be there. Many people from Uber will be there. And, yeah, I wanted to reach to the industry people here if they want to come and attend it any. Yeah. Yes, sir.
00:10:42.914 - 00:11:05.514, Speaker C: Data marketplaces is something that is becoming a bit more common from concept to reality. Now, while they have been in use in some of the online world that we see, there seems to be a possibility of this mushrooming all over the place. And do you see that kind of context coming into your value?
00:11:05.594 - 00:11:26.564, Speaker B: I'm not sure I have floated that idea to people because everybody talks about data science, and if you don't link yourself to data science, you're missing out. Right. So I think we'll eventually put that angle in. So, yes, just to mention, I'm a philosopher by, oh, great.
00:11:28.264 - 00:11:45.036, Speaker D: Any kind of matching activity, I think, has an optimization. There's an optimization thing or efficiency goal behind it. Do people in this sphere think about what's being optimized?
00:11:45.140 - 00:11:46.204, Speaker B: Of course, all the time.
00:11:46.284 - 00:11:47.148, Speaker D: And why?
00:11:47.316 - 00:12:10.178, Speaker B: Of course, yeah. So in this, you're optimizing the number of people who got married. This is sort of more, this is just, how should I say it? This is monogamous marriage. This is polygamous marriage. And here also you are optimizing the number of marriages that happened. Yeah.
00:12:10.306 - 00:12:24.626, Speaker E: Try to rephrase Helen's question, which might have been a bit different. For example, is there a lot of thought given to whether or not things like optimizing social welfare, which is like the sum of utilities all the time, is that actually benefiting society?
00:12:24.730 - 00:12:55.408, Speaker B: Why do you think the economists will be here? I don't think that's, that's not the question. Sorry, you took us. Yeah. So when we talk about maximum matching, when you, when you are doing kidney exchange and you are using maximum matching, where did it go? Yeah. So here. So that's an optimization. You're finding the maximum matching.
00:12:55.408 - 00:13:13.436, Speaker B: In stable matching, you're finding a stable matching. There's no optimization. But because there's always a stable matching in budgeted allocation, again, you're maximizing Google's revenue. So in all these matching problems, you are maximizing, it's an optimization issue. Yes. Yes, sir.
00:13:13.500 - 00:13:20.676, Speaker C: I guess maybe the question was more about is the global maximization the best thing to do, or should we worry about participants?
00:13:20.780 - 00:13:21.660, Speaker D: What's being matched?
00:13:21.692 - 00:13:59.256, Speaker B: Fairness in matching, Google's revenue is being optimized for his sake and here, for the sake of the sick people, the number of kidneys that are exchanged is being maximized. And here, sometimes there's an optimization. It's the number of people who get to their first ranked schools. When you're doing school choice or the number of people who got hospital interns who go to their first ranked hospitals. That's being maximized. So there are, you know, definitely. That's a big part of the whole issue.
00:13:59.256 - 00:14:02.664, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay. Thank you so much.
