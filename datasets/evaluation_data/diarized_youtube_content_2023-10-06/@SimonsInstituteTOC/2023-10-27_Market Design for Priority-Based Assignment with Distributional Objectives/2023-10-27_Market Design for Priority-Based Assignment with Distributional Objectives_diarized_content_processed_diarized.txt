00:00:00.200 - 00:00:24.038, Speaker A: To be here, but last minute change of plans. He's not going to be here. Let me quickly tell you what we are doing. 30 minutes. I hope I can finish everything. We are going to talk about a mini to one matching problem with distributional constraints. And there are many applications of that and many important applications.
00:00:24.038 - 00:01:15.694, Speaker A: For many important applications, stability is not a policy requirement at all. But when you look at those papers, researchers usually impose stability and they usually start like this. They take a problem, an application with distribution objectives. They assume a choice function, and presumably a substitute will one impose stability, and they come up with the standard solutions. And we are going to claim that this approach actually has its own shortcomings and it may lead to misleading conclusions. In particular, distribution objectives are not necessarily compatible with the main policy objectives. And when you just assume stability, you bury the problem one more layer deeper.
00:01:15.694 - 00:02:01.214, Speaker A: And that's what we are going to do instead. We are going to begin with the policy requirements. We are going to formulate them as axioms, and of course, we are not the first one to do that. There's a long tradition of axiomatic characterization in the literature without even imposing stability. And we are going to characterize a deferred acceptance algorithm with a particular choice function. Of course, our outcome solution is going to be stable with respect to that particular choice function, but eventually we are not going to be able to meet all of our policy requirements. We are going to try to optimize on that one.
00:02:01.214 - 00:02:32.968, Speaker A: That's where we are going to differ from the rest of the literature. In the rest of the literature, even the recent ones, they state blocking conditions as axioms. And when they eliminate those blocking conditions, they end up with the stability condition. Again, it is not really in that regard. Our work is going to be quite different than what has been done in the literature. Let me give you a simple example. Think of this as a school choice example.
00:02:32.968 - 00:02:58.414, Speaker A: There are three applicants, a low income student, another low income student, and a high income student. And there's one school. There's a baseline priority. L1 has the highest priority, then h, then l two, and school one. The school wants to reserve one seat for low income. For a low income student. What does this mean? Reserving a seat? Right.
00:02:58.414 - 00:03:40.042, Speaker A: That is how it is usually done. We divide the school into two sub schools, one for low income students. They are going to be favored, and this school is going to have only one seat resort for low income students, and an open seat. This is also open. Every, every seat in the resource seat is also open. As long as there's no low income student who claims that a high income student can get it right. And after that, the low income substool is going to elevate the priority of low income students without changing the baseline priority among them.
00:03:40.042 - 00:04:14.566, Speaker A: So all low income students are going to be ranked higher than high income. The relative ranking is not going to change, and the open seat is going to keep the baseline priority. Then there are the literature, usually studies various types of choice rules. One of them is applicants first apply to the open seat. In this case, everybody is going to apply to SL and one is going to get the seat right. Then everybody else, I'm sorry, everybody's gonna apply to the open seat first. L1 is gonna get it.
00:04:14.566 - 00:04:56.726, Speaker A: L1 is gone. Now the remaining students, two and each, are gonna apply to resort, apply for reserve seat. Two is l two is gonna get it. In this way, both low income students are gonna be assigned the school. Alternatively, applicants could first apply for the reserved seats, right? In this case, l one is gonna get the resource seat and open seat is going to go to h. So the choice of the choice rule has distributional implications. Now, both actually, you know, both assignments are stable with respect to the corresponding choice rule, right? They have no problem with stability here.
00:04:56.726 - 00:05:38.792, Speaker A: But the problem is, stability is not a policy objective in such applications. It is actually, if you look at the, it is, the objective is actually minimizing priority violations. And that is usually not compatible with distributional objectives. If you put distribution objectives on your many to one matching problem, and if you have a baseline prior to ranking, you are always going to end up with some priority violations. So stability is not a policy objective, but priority violations are. The literature does not. The literature ignores that.
00:05:38.792 - 00:06:20.076, Speaker A: They mostly focus on this so called precedence order or seed processing order. And they study the effect of different choice rules on how many low income students are assigned the school, for example. That's the main concern. What we are going to do is actually we are going to go back to the basics. We are going to take an axiomatic approach, following a long traditional and we are going to characterize the deferred acceptance mechanism with a specific choice rule without even imposing stability. That's what we are going to do. Priority based assignment.
00:06:20.076 - 00:07:09.948, Speaker A: There are many applications, and there are also many applications with diversity and distribution objectives. Some of them are the segregation policies in public schools, affirmative action in college admissions, and so on. For example, in Chicago, Chicago public schools, the selective schools Chicago divides neighborhoods into four tiers depending on socioeconomic status. And for each tier, each school reserves 17.5% of the seats in New York, a big chunk of schools actually reserve a big chunk of seats for low income students. These applications are everywhere. There's of course, a baseline prior to ranking at each school.
00:07:09.948 - 00:08:08.504, Speaker A: For example, for the selective schools in Chicago, students take an exam and their exam scores determine their priority ranking. That is the baseline priority that I am talking about. And the common solution is really a reserves rule. Modify they reserve some seats for the beneficiary groups and modify the priorities at those seats for the beneficiary groups and choose a choice function and apply find a stable matching with respect to the choice function. Now, our goal is we are going to take an axiomatic approach and we are going to ask the following question. Why reserves rules? We are not even going to start with reserves rules, right? We are going to start with policy requirements. We are going to model them as axioms and they are going to give us the reserves rules.
00:08:08.504 - 00:08:41.562, Speaker A: That's the first thing we are going to do. And this is going to be a big class. A big class. Actually, let me get back to this point. Then the next question is which reserve rule? Again, we are going to impose further policy requirements and we are going to show that the further acceptance mechanism where all schools use a particular reserve rule, which I'm going to call a regular reserve, is the unique mechanism satisfying our axioms and objectives. That is the goal. We are not the first introducing objectives.
00:08:41.562 - 00:09:18.564, Speaker A: There are in particular hafalo. I believe Hafal is the first one who studied the reserves. We are not the first one who does an axiomatic analysis of a single school choice problem. Actually, Federico and Bohemian pioneered this work studying choice rules from an axiomatic point of view. But we can claim that we are going to be one of the first to study this problem in a general matching framework. And I am going to. Again, I am going to give you a characterization of the default acceptance algorithm without imposing stability.
00:09:18.564 - 00:10:16.694, Speaker A: Now a bunch of applications with reserves in reserve rules in real life. And let me go back to the literature and let me start where we see the problem. This is probably cones and sun mass is probably the most general treatment of the problem. Communism assumes seat specific priorities. A school might have seats for low income students, high income students, middle income students, and each seat might actually each seat not only type specific seats, but each seat might have specific priorities. Their objective is finding strategic proof and stable mechanisms, and precedence order is a major contribution of their work. But actually their precedence order excludes choice rules that I'm going to talk about that minimize priority violations.
00:10:16.694 - 00:11:04.522, Speaker A: And we see this as a manifestation of lack of axiomatic approach follow up work by again Durer et al. And Mapada et al. They also study the impact of president's order on the distribution. But none of them pay attention to the possibility of baseline priority violations, which is going to be in avoidable when you impose distributional objectives in an otherwise standard many to one matching problem. Now, so let me skip this one. What I'm going to do is I'm going to do, hopefully I'm going to do two things. I'm going to start with a decentralized school choice problem that is super common.
00:11:04.522 - 00:12:05.320, Speaker A: Chartered schools, for example, are entitled to run their own admissions and in many states charter schools run their own admissions. In New York City prior to 2003, application process was centralized, but admissions were decentralized. Each school were admitting its own set of students. So we are going to study that decentralized matching problem. This is going to boil down to a single schools problem, and in this single school problem, minimizing priority violations is going to characterize a choice rule, which I'm going to call a regular role, and then I'm going to switch to the centralized school choice where we are going to have many schools, many students, many to ones, matching with distributional constraints, and then minimizing priority violations. Again, I'm not talking about stability. I'm trying to minimize blocking pairs.
00:12:05.320 - 00:13:21.124, Speaker A: And eventually I'm not going to be able to eliminate all of the blocking pairs, but I am going to try to minimize the number of blocking pairs that's going to yield a different acceptance with regular choice rules. Why is this different? This different because there are other characterizations in the literature, but if you read them carefully, their axioms state the blocking conditions as axioms, and when you eliminate those blocking conditions, you end up with stability, and no surprise if the resulting choice is substitutable. And if you, if you want optimal and everything, you end up with a different acceptance with that substitutable choice function. This one, let me introduce some notation. We are going to have a set of applicants. Each set of applicant is going to have a type, low income students, high income students, so on. I'm gonna, this is the set of type t students in a low income students is gonna be a subscript law, and there's gonna be a baseline priority over all applicants.
00:13:21.124 - 00:13:53.648, Speaker A: And we are also gonna have some type specific reserves. This is the number of seats that a school wants to reserve for low income students, number of seats that it wants to reserve for high income students, and so on. This cannot sum up to a number more than the capacity. We can also have quotas. Quotas turns out to be very easy to handle. Quotas actually bound the number of certain types admitted. I'm going to skip that one in this talk.
00:13:53.648 - 00:14:25.096, Speaker A: I'm going to focus on the difficult part, the resource part, and we are in for the decentralized school choice. We are interested in the choice function. A set of students are applying to a school and the school is going to choose from that set without exceeding its capacity. Q number of seats and here are the reserves rules. I'm not going to start with this one. I'm going to arrive to that rule. But let me first clarify what it means.
00:14:25.096 - 00:15:27.606, Speaker A: I am going to divide the school into t plus one sub schools, one for open seats and one for each type. Each type of school is going to have exactly the reserves as number of seats and the remaining seats are going to go to the open seats. And each reserve school is going to modify the priority ranking by elevating the priority of type t students in the baseline priority and the open. Otherwise its ranking is going to be consistent with the baseline priority and the open seats are going to use the baseline priority. Now here is a piece, one more piece of notation. We are going to consider some application orders. This is an application order for applicant a when the set of applicants is given by capital a.
00:15:27.606 - 00:16:38.414, Speaker A: So this application order may depend on the applicant and it may also depend on who else is applying. What does this mean? This means this is going to tell us in which order of type specific seats we are going to consider that application applicant. Right. In other words, is the applicant going to apply for a low income seat or for a high income seat or for open seat first? And what is next? That is the application order. And by actually, by dividing this school into t plus one subschools and by endowing each, each applicant with an application order, we are turning a single school problem into a, into one matching problem, right? This, this is playing the role of preferences. Now I can find a choice outcome. I can apply the deferred acceptance to this problem where each school has a capacity, each school has a priority ranking and each has a preference over those sub schools.
00:16:38.414 - 00:17:08.694, Speaker A: And that's what I'm going to do. I am going to create a choice function associated with an application order by using the standard student proposing default acceptance algorithm. Now examples of this is again in the literature. It's examples about. Now let me stop a bit here. Let's forget about the reserve rules. Let us go back to the policies.
00:17:08.694 - 00:17:56.476, Speaker A: What are the policies? The first one is, what do we mean by reserves? The first axiom goes all the way back to earlier work, which we are going to call reserve respecting. It says the following. This is the number of seats reserved for type t students. If there are not that many type t applicants, select all of them. If there are more than that many type t students, select at least that many type students. This indicates that this actually already says that. Let's first try to assign as many type tissues as possible to those resources.
00:17:56.476 - 00:18:25.234, Speaker A: That is our first axiom. That's what we mean by reserving a seat. The second axiom is kind of an efficiency axiom. It's going to be what's called non wasteful. As long as there are seats, we are going to assign all of the applicants. If number of applicants is less than the capacity, we are going to assign all of them. Again, I am ignoring the quotas.
00:18:25.234 - 00:19:07.384, Speaker A: It's so easy to modify this with quotas. Now, here is my main objective. This is the typical blocking condition in a typical stability notion. I'm going to say that an applicant a is going to violate the priority of applicant a prime. If a is chosen, a prime is not chosen, but a prime actually has a higher baseline priority. He's ranked higher, he's not chosen, but another lower ranked one is chosen. We want to eliminate priority violations to the extent possible.
00:19:07.384 - 00:19:38.284, Speaker A: When we eliminate all of them, we end up with the standard, typical notion of stability. But sometimes we are not going to be able to eliminate all of them. We are going to allow some priority violations, but the certain priority violations are not allowed. One of them is, for example, within type priority compatibility. If two students are of the same type, they cannot violate each other's priority. That is the first one. Two low income students.
00:19:38.284 - 00:20:40.134, Speaker A: There's no reason for one of them to eliminate the priority of the other one. That is the condition we are going to impose on our allocation. The second one is we are going to allow some for some priority violations, but we should be able to explain that via our resource policy. This is the number of type T students who are chosen by this choice rule, but they actually cause a priority violation. That number cannot exceed the number of seats reserved for that type. What does this mean? This means if there are five seats available for low income, five seats reserved for low income students, there might be five priority violations by low income students, probably because they got into those resort seats, not because they have high priority, but because these seats are reserved for them.
00:20:40.494 - 00:20:41.794, Speaker B: Okay, thank you.
00:20:42.094 - 00:21:16.524, Speaker A: So the first theorem is actually these four axioms characterize the resources that I gave you. And these resources are this is a pretty big class of resources. Application order can be student specific. It can actually depend, also depend on the set of applicants. Right. If you go back to communist and sun mass, communist and sun mass in their work, application order or precedence order is the same for all students. In this case, it may actually be different for each student, and that's going to be important.
00:21:16.524 - 00:21:19.044, Speaker A: Now.
00:21:20.784 - 00:21:22.364, Speaker B: Let me skip this one.
00:21:23.304 - 00:21:58.394, Speaker A: I'm going to call a specific application of the regular, and it's this one. Each applicant is going to be considered at seats for his or her type first. If I am a low income student, I'm going to apply for a low income for a seat that is reserved for low income seats first. Then I can apply to any other, for any other seat. Doesn't matter if it is a high income or open seat. If you are a high income student, you are going to apply for a high income for a seat resort for high income first. Then you can apply to any one of them.
00:21:58.394 - 00:22:26.304, Speaker A: And actually it doesn't matter. The rest doesn't matter. As long as each student applies first to the seat reserved for his or her own type, the rest of the application order does not matter. It always produces the same outcome. Now back to the example again. Remember this two low income, one high income one. In this one, the first one applicants were applying to the open seat first.
00:22:26.304 - 00:22:55.952, Speaker A: Two low income students are selected. In the second one, each type is applying to the seat. Results for this type first. Here, one low, one high. Right? But look at that. In regular, the top ranked two students are getting the seats. In the other one, two low income students are getting the seats at the expense of violating aids.
00:22:55.952 - 00:23:44.554, Speaker A: Priority. So the regular rule does not create any priority violations in this particular example, but the other one does. This actually is turns out to be a general result among all choice rules that are satisfying our four axioms. The one that minimizes the number of applicants whose priorities are violated is the regular rules. And that one, for example, is not included in in comnas and typhoons work and all the follow up work. Right now, the application order ranks.
00:23:45.214 - 00:23:46.434, Speaker B: You play first.
00:23:49.714 - 00:24:18.546, Speaker A: It says as long as as long as you apply for your own, each applicant. As long as each applicant applies for their own type specific seat first, the rest doesn't matter. So consider to consider two application orders. All types apply for these types first. Then for the open seat, let's consider low, high and open seat, right? Right. Everybody. I am a low income.
00:24:18.546 - 00:25:07.890, Speaker A: I apply for low income seats first, then open seats, then high. Another alternative is I apply for low first, then high, then open. The remaining does not matter. Yeah, I have to quick. So we actually, there are other alternative ways of modeling priority violations. The regular rules satisfy those two, but the question is, do we really need alternative rules? Right? For example, if you go back to Dur et al. Where they talk about the walks on, the walks on policies of Boston, they consider alternative choice rules.
00:25:07.890 - 00:26:06.884, Speaker A: Well, here's one theorem, actually, there's a point there. Given a type t, consider an application order in which type t applicants apply for the open seat first and all other applicants apply for their own resort seats first. That is actually the best one for type t students. That selects the biggest number of type t students among all the, among all the choice reserve rules we characterized. But do we need that? The next theorem says we don't. Why? Because we can always replicate whatever we obtain here or whatever we obtain with an alternative function by properly setting the reserves and applying the regular rule. What does this mean? This means once we do that, we can actually explain any remaining priority violation via our reserve policies.
00:26:06.884 - 00:26:55.830, Speaker A: That is not true with the alternative solutions. And so, to summarize, reserve regular results can replicate any other reserve rule. And unlike ad hoc rules, any priority violation with regular reserves is fully explained by the policy. Therefore, it actually provides a full transparency in policy design. Now, what I'm going to do next, actually, I am not sure if I have time, but let me first, let me first summarize. I'm going to generalize the axioms for assignments. That was for assigned to a single school, I'm going to consider assigning students to multiple schools.
00:26:55.830 - 00:27:39.424, Speaker A: Once I do that, I'm going to talk about minimizing priority violations. When I do priority violations in terms of set inclusion, which means a choice rule is going to have less priority violations in terms of set inclusions than another one. Whenever we compare those two choice rules over different problems, one is if there's a priority violation in one of them, that priority violation is going to exist in the other one too. In that sense, it is set inclusion. When we do that, deferred acceptance with regular choice rules is going to minimize priority violations. Again, I'm not talking about stability here. Right? There's no stability notion here.
00:27:39.424 - 00:28:49.584, Speaker A: But turns out if you want to minimize priority violations, it is the deferred acceptance with regular choice loans. This is actually the first of its kind, actually, to characterize a default acceptance algorithm. This way, if we try to minimize priority violations in other ways, for example, let us try to minimize the number of priority violations. That turns out to be a difficult problem to solve, in particular, mp hard and in simulations, we also compare deferred acceptance with the regular choice rules with alternatives, and we obtain significant reduction in priority violations with regular choice rules. What do I do? Typical matching problem. I'm gonna say that an assignment is, let me give at least one of them. An assignment is reserves respecting if for any applicant and any school, as long as there is demand for that school, as long as applicant a prefers s to new a, that means he or she's not getting it.
00:28:49.584 - 00:29:47.424, Speaker A: Then it must be the case that there are not enough resort seats for that person. That's how we generalize reserve seats policies, non macefulness. Again, as long as there is enough seats, if there's somebody demanding it, we are going to give that seat to that person and a priority violation. Again, a typical blocking payer, a prime s a prime is assigned s with a lower priority, while a prefers s to a s to his assignment. Now again, the, we didn't type the other axioms. Let me actually talk about this. I'm gonna say assignment mu prime priority violations dominates another assignment.
00:29:47.424 - 00:30:33.264, Speaker A: Here's how I'm going to define now how I'm going to think about minimizing priority violations. If the set of priority violation instances the blocking pills, let us call the blocking pairs under mu. Prime is a subset of the blocking pairs under Mu. Let this, this one, Jimmy, it's a smallest set of blocking pairs. If this halts, I'm going to say new prime priority domain is mu and I'm going to try to minimize that set. Not the number of priority violations, but I'm going to try to minimize that set. And when I do that, the outcome of default acceptance with regular reserve rules is the priority violations minimal in the class of assignments that satisfy our other axioms.
00:30:33.264 - 00:30:37.124, Speaker A: Am I running out of time?
00:30:37.744 - 00:30:38.920, Speaker B: One and a half minutes.
00:30:38.992 - 00:31:27.514, Speaker A: Okay, so let me just give you the major school district. We have the test scores and everything. We divide the population into low achieving and high achieving according to the gpas, and we reserve seats 20% of seats for low income students and 20% of seats for high achieving seats and low achieving seats each. We run the regular rule, regular default acceptance, and the default acceptance with the alternative rule. The regular one with 20% result for each type creates on average 25 blocking pairs. The other. The alternative one actually creates 101, five times more blocking pairs, and this is consistent across years.
00:31:27.514 - 00:31:31.964, Speaker A: Let me just quickly, tank, I'm finished.
00:31:49.064 - 00:31:53.752, Speaker B: Can you explain these type results if you have overlapping types?
00:31:53.928 - 00:32:11.224, Speaker A: Not really. That would be very challenging because of the complementary issue. There are things you can do. You can define the overlapping types as a separate type and impose resource for them. But that would be a not so fancy trick, right?
00:32:17.564 - 00:32:49.874, Speaker B: So not all priority violations. If you're in New York City, it's probably less serious from a policymaker, Lukoin, than, for instance, violating priority for underrepresented minorities. So with that change, do you have any idea if you took preferences for policymakers like this? Kind of.
00:32:50.194 - 00:33:18.972, Speaker A: My bias answer would be no. We can solve this problem too, and hopefully we can. If we can define geographical, we can define a distribution, constraints on a geographical distribution. For example, we can define catchment areas for each schools, that might be very important for elementary schools, and we can actually reserve seats in the catchment area and everything would follow right away.
00:33:19.148 - 00:33:20.612, Speaker B: Yeah, but I meant there's a trade.
00:33:20.668 - 00:33:56.524, Speaker A: Off between violations, I think. Let me borrow one more minute. I think the benefit of this approach is there's of course a trade off, but whenever you violate some priorities, you can explain under these rules. And then it comes to the question of how should we set the reserves? I think that's a more transparent question, a policy. A more transparent policy question to have than playing with the president's orders to favor some of the beneficiaries.
00:34:00.064 - 00:34:01.124, Speaker B: Thank you again.
00:34:07.024 - 00:34:07.664, Speaker A: So I think.
