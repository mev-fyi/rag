00:00:02.480 - 00:02:18.122, Speaker A: 99%. Yeah. Well, yeah, but mostly kind of good. That's what the right hand is. It's nothing. Yeah. Well tended sensory sensor descriptions, does it impact how they improve system architecture? So, second talk is by David Morris about bike sharing.
00:02:18.218 - 00:03:03.774, Speaker B: Great, thanks, Steve. So I'm going to talk about primarily about one aspect of bike sharing, but I'll set the frame more generally as well. This is more recent work that's joined with an undergrad at Cornell, Han Gil Cheung and Daniel Freund. But as I say, it's really based on sort of ongoing series of papers that are also with Shane and Owen. And indeed, the focus is going to be on incentives. And the picture in the upper right hand corner is from a recent article in an online publication talking about city bike angels in an area of Brooklyn. And I'll tell you gradually what bike angels are.
00:03:03.774 - 00:04:02.214, Speaker B: So, bike sharing 101 bike sharing systems as they are at this point, predominant in the US, are the station based systems. Here you see a map of the system in New York and a station behind it. At a station is a set of docks, which can be filled with bikes. And the key element of the system is the ability for a rider to rent a bike at any station and return it at any other. And as I said, this is ongoing work that we did initially primarily with Citibike, but more generally now with motivate, their umbrella company, impacting their systems across North America. And Citibike started in New York in May of 2013 to give you a sense of the volume. Nearly 2 million rides per good weather month.
00:04:02.214 - 00:04:59.214, Speaker B: Now, Velib, at its peak in Paris, was 3 million, as the other sort of most recognized station based ride sharing system. Bike sharing system. And give you a sense of overall volume, between 16 and 17 million rides in 2017. Currently, there are about 12,000 bikes, more than 700, really, actually more than 800 stations, and there's ongoing expansion. And as I said, this has been part of work that we've done with Citibike since their inception. The main challenge in running one of these systems is imbalanced that on the left you see a station where a cyclist is arriving with no docks available, and on the right you see a user unable to rent a bike because the docks are all empty. And in some sense, that's the key challenge, is preventing cyclists from becoming angry at their inventory stock outs.
00:04:59.214 - 00:05:38.044, Speaker B: This is a system that one gets a good sense of, the data of usage throughout the day. And I know many of you have seen this movie, but I'm going to play it again anyway. So I'm going to show you a day in the life of New York. And it's going to start at midnight. Each of those circles corresponds to a station. The diameter of the station is proportional to the net flow of bikes at that station. Red is going to be outgoing traffic, blue is going to be ingoing traffic.
00:05:38.044 - 00:06:03.044, Speaker B: And let's start it assuming it wants to come up od. No. There we go. Okay, so it's midnight. There's small amounts of percolating effects as we head into the beginning of the rush hour. The transit hubs at Penn Station, the port authority, are going to turn red. The financial district is going to turn blue.
00:06:03.044 - 00:06:35.244, Speaker B: And here we see it there. The red, the blue for the financial district. The east Village, a residential area, turns red, and midtown turns blue for commercial incoming traffic. And this explodes through the morning rush hour. Now, by 10:00 it starts fading off. There'll be a little bit of a pickup at around lunchtime, of increase of rides. And then the other key element of bike share traffic is that we'll see the same thing in reverse for the late afternoon rush.
00:06:35.244 - 00:07:36.344, Speaker B: Midtown turns red, the financial district turns red, the east village turns blue, and the transit hubs turn blue of incoming traffic. And the afternoon rush ends, takes a bit longer to die down, and then we percolate back to just this noise throughout the system. Okay, so there you sort of see the texture of neighborhoods. New York, as cities goes, is relatively heterogeneous in that there's a mosaic of characteristics of stations that are actually relatively physically close to each other. Other cities are more partitioned between different larger areas of different kinds of behavior. The system, of course, keeps track of itself. That this shows a plot of one very boring station in Brooklyn, the time of day on the x axis, and the number of bikes currently docked at that station.
00:07:36.344 - 00:08:10.318, Speaker B: To give you a sense why, I say that the Green line across the top is the capacity. So this is a relatively large station. This is a station in midtown. In contrast, three days of the same week, and you sort of see tremendous volatility. This spike, for example, or maybe even clearer, this spike is a rebalancing truck, that a truck arrived with a large number of bikes. They got unloaded. And then this is midtown.
00:08:10.318 - 00:08:21.238, Speaker B: 52nd and fifth. So this is a time in the evening rush where there's just tremendous outflow. And that station gets depleted almost immediately. Yes.
00:08:21.406 - 00:08:26.514, Speaker A: Check down at the bottom. What's the incentive? What's the disincentive for just abandoning bicycles?
00:08:27.014 - 00:09:47.938, Speaker B: $1,000 deposit on your credit card. Good that's a pretty strong disincentive. I mean, first there are overage fees, and then it's good. And please interrupt with questions throughout. Although the system does track its own data, of course, we only know the transactions that did occur, not the ones that didn't occur due to the fact that there wasn't availability. But there's a way that we can do a sort of back of the simple back of the envelope and take advantage of stochasticity to infer a bit more signal than the data itself, and to illustrate that this is a plot that shows the days of one month, the 24 hours in a day broken into ten minute segments, indicating are we in extreme situation where we're almost out of bikes, other hot red is out of docs, and green is just generally good. And if I look at a given ten minute slice, as I go across the behavior across the month, we see that there's variability there.
00:09:47.938 - 00:10:55.942, Speaker B: And so we can in some sense infer what a data driven rental rate is at a given station just by conditioning on those particular days in which there is availability rather than just an average over the full thing. And for a time like this, you can see that quite often, we're almost out of bikes. This is Penn Station, so it's one of the hardest stations to actually manage nationwide. And this allows us to back in, to go from the dotted plot to midtown plots of morning and afternoon rush and the east village. Similarly, in terms of what we can back end, in terms of the data driven demand, weekdays and weekends are very different. Not terribly surprising. This is a graphic that shows weekdays and weekends, the 25 pair to pair, end to end pair of most used, most rented routes.
00:10:55.942 - 00:11:40.160, Speaker B: And what you can see, of course, is during the week that there's a lot of this sort of cross town midtown traffic where there is not great public infrastructure, whereas on the weekends, it's overwhelmingly dominated by rides down the scenic west side and through Central park. No surprises. But the data all just. This is all just living in the data. Okay. At the core of all the work that we've done is a model of performance of the system, which is really geared towards the idea of planning guided by the data. And of course, the main message is everything I just said.
00:11:40.160 - 00:12:44.004, Speaker B: Most trips are by computers, by commuters. The heaviest usage is in rush hour. The planning period really can be thought of as from 06:00 a.m. To midnight, where most of the activity occurs, and then there's a quiescent period between midnight and 06:00 a.m. And the first issue as a modeler is that we want a way of evaluating the state of the system as a function of where we are in the planning period. And the metric that we're going to think about is we're going to posit some underlying stochastic model of traffic, of renting and returns throughout the system, throughout the day. And then if I look at from a given point of time till the end of the planning period, let's, you know, relative to that stochastic model of traffic and the current state of the system view what the expected total number of stock outs, either out of bikes or out of docks, are going to be as we play out the rest of the rest of the planning period.
00:12:44.004 - 00:13:49.516, Speaker B: Really the number of upset customers. In a little bit more detail, how we actually modeled the stochastic traffic is a poisson flow of bikes that we have time varying, piecewise constant Poisson processes that give both the rental rate and return rate for each station in half hour intervals throughout the day. And then as I look at each individual station, that can be modeled by a continuous time Markov chain, and then that allows us to turn the crank and have these kinds of functions. So for every initial point, we'll have a cost function, which is just the expected total number of outages over the remainder of the planning period. As I think about what happens at each station, and then I add that up over all stations in thinking about system state. But different stations are very different. And it's sort of just as a check, I'll show you a few plots of what those stations look like.
00:13:49.516 - 00:14:22.764, Speaker B: This is the port Authority, one of those transit hubs. So on the x axis, we have the number of bikes at 06:00 a.m. And the y axis, we have the cost, the number of outages that are expected over the rest of the day. And because that's a source of tremendous outflow at 06:00 a.m. Every additional bike that I have in the station at 06:00 a.m. Saves me one in terms of the overall objective function. And we see this nice slope of minus one on that, that boring station in Brooklyn.
00:14:22.764 - 00:14:55.102, Speaker B: Basically, as long as we had a reasonable number of bikes there, we can, I'll get it down to expect no stock outs. But even so, it's very insensitive to the original number of 06:00 a.m. Because there just wasn't a lot of activity there. And it was kind of balanced in and out station. In midtown, again, we have this great inflow of traffic. Every dock filled at 06:00 a.m. Will lead to an additional outage as that flow comes in as the course of the morning rush hour.
00:14:55.102 - 00:16:00.514, Speaker B: But then there's every range of possible behaviors in between with more interesting behavior. And for then, for each station, there is an associated target of how many bikes that we would want at 06:00 a.m. And then this, of course, gives rise to an associated optimization problem. If I've got a fleet of bikes, how do I ideally want to position them throughout the system so as to minimize the overall cost of the state? But it also gives us a way of sort of thinking about the idealized allocation is over the course of the day, and that may vary as well. Okay, questions? So indeed, if we look at the fraction. So here we look at two neighborhoods, the east Village and the financial district. And as we think about what that optimization model gives in terms of what is the idealized fraction of the docks that should be full as a function of the time of day, then what we see here is in the overnight hours, we already want things basically full.
00:16:00.514 - 00:16:41.936, Speaker B: But then as we exit the morning rush and go to the afternoon rush, we want the idealized version is this quick transition between wanting it completely full to being completely empty. And this will come up as we sort of think about the incentive system that I'll be talking about later. And in the opposite way, in the financial district, we want some amount of bikes, but not completely empty because there's some overnight traffic. They work hard, and it should be basically empty through the morning. But then all of a sudden, we should. Again, the polarity of the magnet should switch. And then come the afternoon traffic, we want those stations full.
00:16:41.936 - 00:16:42.392, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:16:42.488 - 00:16:47.728, Speaker A: So in the previous slide, why is the dissatisfaction increasing with the number of bikes? Because they're exceeding the capacity.
00:16:47.776 - 00:17:06.394, Speaker B: Because then I'm going to be having users come in and not show up. And there will be a dock available. Right. So it's this two sided inventory that there's a fixed capacity of docks. If I have too many bikes there, people are going to try to return bikes and there won't be docks. And I'm just treating them for the purposes of this in a symmetric way. Yeah.
00:17:06.474 - 00:17:19.610, Speaker A: In terms of indications of dissatisfaction for empty docs, does a customer register and do they register a complaint? And are they identifiable at that point?
00:17:19.682 - 00:17:28.626, Speaker B: So this is, I mean, these are objective functions measured by rates of traffic. And that would not going back to.
00:17:28.650 - 00:17:32.266, Speaker A: Actual specific users, but just thinking about the actual mechanism.
00:17:32.330 - 00:18:22.384, Speaker B: So again, we don't know in some systems there actually is a button on the kiosk that tells you you want an extra 15 minutes worth of time and you're going to move it, then be told where your nearest available dock is. I know that the system in Tel Aviv that I use has this functionality. I'm not sure that's for inbound, but it's not in an ideal world, just as your rideshare company keeps track of your app openings. Ideally, if people really went to their app, as I do in using Gobike here, and wants to want to know whether the dock that I, the station I use, there would be a way of gaining an extra signal of knowing that source, but that's not entering into the system in any concrete way. Other questions?
00:18:22.924 - 00:18:32.884, Speaker A: Yeah. Is the goal here to not have unsatisfied customers, or is the goal to make the best profit margin?
00:18:34.704 - 00:19:35.734, Speaker B: So one of the nice things about the partnership with motivate is that we convince them that they should just think about social good and think about it clearly aligns to some extent with profit. But since and we'll get to pricing a minute, their overwhelming income stream is through annual subscriptions. Understanding exactly what performance does or doesn't correspond is itself a tricky modeling issue. But this is what they're using, more or less. This is a scatter plot that shows that if I look at how I'm thinking about the idealized state of the system, apportioning bikes throughout the system for the afternoon rush hour or the start of the afternoon rush hour, let's say at 04:00 p.m. And the start of the morning rush hour. And I look each of these points in this scatter plot corresponds to one station.
00:19:35.734 - 00:20:53.698, Speaker B: So if all traffic were this antipodal, like the financial district or like midtown, all of the points would either be in the upper left hand corner or the lower right hand corner. But you see that the system, in looking at over the hundreds of stations exhibits far more diverse behavior in terms of what the idealized fraction of docks filled for an idealized state of the system. Okay, good. So the goal is to take this data and help it to improve operations and to use this user dissatisfaction function as a guide. One of the first things is this sort of planning question of at 06:00 a.m. Where should the bikes be? It's used as this get bikes map as part of an ongoing daily rebalancing. But when we started this project years ago, we had this idealized view that the city was quiet between midnight and 06:00 a.m.
00:20:53.698 - 00:21:22.642, Speaker B: And that basically we could move the system from the state that it was in at midnight to the state that we want at 06:00 a.m. In contrast, this is a map that shows how the system is one particular midnight. Again, each of the circles corresponds to one station. And the circles go from white to red. White meaning that it's close to the 06:00 a.m.. Optimum. That it doesn't need much rebalancing.
00:21:22.642 - 00:21:59.612, Speaker B: And red meaning that it's far from the 06:00 a.m.. Optimum. And this is the way that things evolved in that six hour period. And I know you're all staring and saying that that could very well have been the same map. No, it's not quite. I can point out a few places where life did get better. But certainly a takeaway is that motorized rebalancing in using the system as it currently stands.
00:21:59.612 - 00:22:44.370, Speaker B: Is really just a drop in the bucket. In terms of trying to make good on the promise of what we think that should be happening with the system. So one question, and this was implicit in those first plots that I have, that the midtown station had under 40 docks, whereas that Brooklyn station had over 61. Question is, are the docks in the right place? The system was set up in the absence of data, knowing how the system would be used. And now we have the data. The docks themselves are just heavy pieces of metal and machinery sitting on top of the sidewalk. A crane can come along, put it onto a flatbed and move it over to another location.
00:22:44.370 - 00:23:14.564, Speaker B: Or a set of three of them over to another station. With relatively little cost. If we can reconfigure the system itself to get better performance. Then that would be something that's worth doing. And indeed, that is something that's worth doing. This is a plot that shows how the daily objective could improve. As a function of the number of docs moved.
00:23:14.564 - 00:23:46.380, Speaker B: And the punchline, I won't go through the numbers. Is that an investment of moving something like 500 docks. Two and a half percent of the system at that time. Decreases the effect the overall cost incurred. By as much as what is being invested into daily motorized rebalancing. So, and indeed, this, not at this scale, but at a somewhat smaller scale. Is already happening, has already happened in New York.
00:23:46.380 - 00:23:52.514, Speaker B: And is the same philosophy is being applied to other cities throughout the network.
00:23:53.334 - 00:23:54.838, Speaker A: Is this one time movement?
00:23:54.926 - 00:24:03.670, Speaker B: This is one time move. This is one time move. And indeed, there's also analysis that says it's not sensitive to seasonality issues and the like.
00:24:03.822 - 00:24:08.638, Speaker A: But perhaps changing the configuration also changes the pattern of traffic.
00:24:08.806 - 00:24:36.864, Speaker B: Yes, but so Daniel is smiling because he can show you plots which I didn't include here because I'm not talking, I wasn't supposed to be talking about this is all framing to get to incentives. But we can see a before and after and that where docks have been moved, we're seeing that there aren't newfound dock outages and yet where that's being moved to where we're getting increased usage as well.
00:24:38.204 - 00:24:47.694, Speaker A: Just as a check, there aren't any easements or rentals, long term term leases or something on total size of dock areas.
00:24:48.114 - 00:25:14.116, Speaker B: So this is a constraint that different for different stations. There may be some bound on how much bigger we can do it. This is all carefully negotiated with local neighborhood associations and the like. The number of people who have, when they've heard that I had anything to do with this, said, you took away my parking spaces. There are trade offs here and there, you know, real limitations.
00:25:14.300 - 00:25:32.704, Speaker A: But there were some very, very limited instances where real estate agents said to Citibank, we're going to give you this much money for setting up a private station in our backyard. So this is super limited. I think there were one or two such instances, but it existed.
00:25:33.724 - 00:26:30.208, Speaker B: Okay, so this was in some sense the system set up. And there are various ways that we can mitigate the effects of the imbalance that occurs in a given time. There's rebalancing occurs during the rush hour. There's rebalancing that occurs overnight. There's a notion of surge capacity that can be installed by valets and corrals that can be positioned throughout the system. But what I really thought fit in, especially with the morning's talks, was this notion of incentive incentives. So in some sense, the only reason I'm talking about incentives rather than differential pricing, is that New York City bike share has agreement with the Department of Transportation of the city of New York as to how pricing is going to work.
00:26:30.208 - 00:27:18.870, Speaker B: And it's as dumb as it comes. It is really. You can get a day pass, you can get a three day pass. Or really an overwhelming fraction of the usage is based on $155 for the year, annual subscription, all you can eat and what we see today, there are many users that ride upwards of 100 times a year. I'm already up to 92 rides on go bike this year. So their subscription isn't paying for the rebalancing. The costs that are incurred and this is worked in, this is non negotiable.
00:27:18.870 - 00:28:12.928, Speaker B: So what we would like to do is encourage rides that help the system. So we can charge more for the overused downstream rides, but we can incentivize users to make use of the system upstream that actually help. And they give us a cheaper form of crowdsourcing, rebalancing. And we've worked with them over a couple of years by now in leading towards this program, which they call bike angels. So how does this work? You open your app and you can see a map, and these are all just screenshots off of the web. So this is real stations where you want to drop. You get incentivized to drop off stations where you will get incentivized to pick up.
00:28:12.928 - 00:28:38.002, Speaker B: You can earn a point at either end. And this is just a point scale. Riders earn points by helping the system. Um, there are various levels for, you know, rewards that, that, that you get. Originally, it was set up more in the context of a raffle for giving out prizes. Now there are just more sort of, you know, ten points. You get that 25 points.
00:28:38.002 - 00:30:04.456, Speaker B: There is a leader leaderboard that's gamified, and then there are sort of your lifetime angel status as opposed to two week intervals. And then there are user quotes that are on there, which I just, I like to do a bike angels workout where I'll bike north in Central park to an empty station, then run back down the park and repeat a few times. Anyway, so in the evolution of this setup in general, this was an education for me in terms of understanding the innate caution of the corporate entity, because it was clear that this made sense. And it was also something that from the moment we first proposed it, there was a good deal of pushback of. Well, this would confuse users, that this would be too complicated to manage. One of the trade offs was that in the first year when they ran a system wide pilot, they invited 10% of the users, 1% signed up to be bike angels. That map was static, that there were a certain set of stations in the morning that you got a point for renting.
00:30:04.456 - 00:30:23.784, Speaker B: There was a certain set of stations. You got a point for whichever. I didn't say renting. Maybe I said the same thing twice, but you know what I meant. And there was a fixed period of time that those incentives were in place for the morning rush hour, and then a similar setup for the afternoon.
00:30:23.864 - 00:30:29.248, Speaker A: Okay, so, yes, and they pay regular rates. They're just rebated in paint in points.
00:30:29.336 - 00:32:06.868, Speaker B: Just rebate in point. So initially, there was some amount of raffles, that there were some mastercards, that Mastercard was a sponsor, and so that there were some cash equivalent prizes. The standard thing that they converge to is this sort of one week extension of your annual subscription for free, which of course is a great win win situation because you're encouraging use by the people who are making it easier to run the system overall. I mean, that initial membership. So in principle you could just keep extending it by, you know, you could go for free indefinitely, having played the initial membership, but still having to incur that fixed cost upfront. So I won't go through the details about how the target set of rides were generated, but we looked at data from that first year in a limited time interval of weeks that the incentive system was active and all of the rides that were from these incentivized stations. And so each of the points that you see here corresponding to one ride which is incentivized either at the start or at the end, and this is just across the morning rush hour.
00:32:06.868 - 00:32:52.762, Speaker B: So this is a question over from six to noon. And what I'm indicating for each point is then what was the change in those cost curves in those user dissatisfaction functions as a result of that ride? So a ride like this is one where we really did want to do that incentivizing because that really improved the overall state of the system as measured by the user dissatisfaction functions. This ride we certainly didn't want to. Or that pick up return, we didn't want to incentivize because it actually made the cost function worse.
00:32:52.818 - 00:32:56.014, Speaker A: Yeah. Would you get two points if you did a.
00:32:56.474 - 00:33:34.672, Speaker B: Yes, indeed. And that is. That's the way the system is structured. So in some sense we just completely decouple pickup and drop off in terms of evaluation. So in an idealized world, if I painted all of the points that were incentivized red and all those that were not incentivized blue, this is the scatter plot I would want. Well, or maybe not. Maybe that's not fair, because after all, there is some cost to each incentivized point, that it is a currency that has some implicit value.
00:33:34.672 - 00:34:31.858, Speaker B: And so one might want to instead think about a different bar and saying that these are the ones you really wanted to incentivize versus the points below. But that's the kind of threshold and calibration that one should think about. So there are a number of ways in which one might think about determining which stations get incentivized for pickup or return. What I already started talking about was this purely static way. We just determine a set of stations and it stays that way throughout the trial. And this is what that first year's data looked like for that time period in terms of which ones we incentivized and which ones we didn't. And, you know, it's like art.
00:34:31.858 - 00:35:22.928, Speaker B: You might think it's good, you might think it's bad. There's sort of room for interpretation there. I mean, there's certainly, you know, there's a lot of red that's up there that we incentivize good rides. And, you know, there's, you know, the things we didn't want to incentivize, we mostly didn't incentivize. But, you know, there's still a fair amount of red that's below zero, and there's still even some blue that's, that's sort of left on the table. Put another way, this is a histogram of the rides. So as we think about the change of the objective, how we actually did in terms of incentivize, we're incentivizing a fair amount of negative or not improving rides.
00:35:22.928 - 00:36:06.204, Speaker B: And it shouldn't be surprising if you go back to those plots I showed earlier, because as I think about the end of the morning rush hour, then at some point I'm incentivizing exactly the wrong thing that I. That I want, that if I'm incentivizing people to take bikes out of the financial district at 10:00 a.m. Maybe that's already too late because that bike really should stay there for when the polarity flips, and it should be then available for the afternoon. And so maybe that's not. Certainly taking advantage of data that's available certainly makes a lot of sense.
00:36:06.584 - 00:36:11.440, Speaker A: Did you actually consider weather conditions if it's raining, if it's snowing?
00:36:11.632 - 00:37:50.774, Speaker B: So, so one can ask the question of can we actually just consider what the state of that station is? And that's perhaps a better way? In general, when there's rain, the system isn't stressed in the same sort of way, and those are easy days to manage overall. But this is exactly the question of am I going to think about this in an online way versus an offline way? Am I going to make decisions throughout the given rush hour period based on the state of that state, or am I going to make a decision upfront instead? So, for example, a policy we call static hindsight is that at the start of any rush hour, we're going to make a decision based on the last w days, and we're just going to live with that decision for this is the period that we're going to incentivize it, or we might do it in an aggregated basis based on neighborhoods and they will cluster the. But again in a static way. Now, in contrast, one can, and again, one of the issues that came up with motivate is that they wanted the way in which the policy appeared to the user to be relatively simple. So they didn't want to station being incentivized and then not incentivized, and then incentivized throughout, within one given period, in some sense that they wanted a contiguous period of time. And indeed, under the right conditions, one can prove that there are policies that are optimal and conserve that. And then one can compute, if you knew all the data in advance, what was the idealized interval for that station.
00:37:50.774 - 00:38:49.184, Speaker B: Those are static policies. And then one set of policies that exactly would enable us to cope with changing conditions, what I'll call dynamic policies. The most user unfriendly one is just you take the ride and you get the incentive, you get the point. If it was a good ride after the fact or it isn't, we know whether or not it changed the objective function. That's what I'll call the dynamic. But of course, motivate doesn't want that at all. But one thing we can do is we can say, we can look at the last 30 minutes and say if the system were structured to last 30 minutes, does that make sense to do that? And we can do that either on a station by station basis or clustered, and we can know 30 is an arbitrary number, but that's actually what the system is using today.
00:38:49.184 - 00:40:05.802, Speaker B: And just to give you a sense, this is the analogous scatter plot. Again, looking back at last year's, I mean, the previous year's data of when I'm using that 30 minutes clustering model in order to do that. And you can see that the transition from red to blue is much more consistent with what we want for our objective. And there's some numbers, but we won't worry about that. So just a few thoughts in conclusion, that as a data driven exercise in helping to crowdsource rebalancing, this worked. The figure that they talked about last week was that on balance, there are a comparable number of crowdsourced rebalancing trips to what motorized rebalancing does, which of course, from a sustainability point of view is great. Station based bike share is only the tip of the iceberg.
00:40:05.802 - 00:41:22.524, Speaker B: What's coming and is around, particularly in China, but in Europe and with scooters and the like, non station based approaches are going to be the way of the future, and I would maintain that pricing and now we don't have to call it incentives because there isn't a fixed thing, is really going to be critical in making those systems work in a way that balances operational needs and maintenance needs with customer availability. I think there are many interesting challenges. If you look at a city like Seattle, where there are multiple dockless bike sharing systems, there's room for interesting work in a sort of game theoretic way of having one pricing model against another that gets both the asymmetry of flow and the tradeoffs between clustering for operations and dispersion for availability. So with that, I'll happy to take some questions.
00:41:27.344 - 00:41:42.824, Speaker A: In some other context. People have kind of compared this sort of a direct monetary based incentive versus sort of what you raffle based. Have you found any kind of a behavioral difference where you were influencing one versus the other?
00:41:43.124 - 00:42:33.192, Speaker B: So I just don't know. I mean, it's the simple and truthful answer. I bet that this was a program we proposed in sort of their broad outlines to New York City bikeshare, and we proposed initially to be raffle based, and they backed away from it being more raffle based. But I think there's an interesting. There's certainly a lot of room for work in the sort of mechanism design, kinds of questions of how do you maintain user interest in being willing to, should you ramp up incentives, should you start and back? This is all, you know, purely speculative and people going by the seat of their pants rather than with sort of well substantiated science.
00:42:33.328 - 00:42:50.000, Speaker A: Maybe one more comment on this question. One issue that doesn't usually arise in theoretical computer science when the raffle was implemented was that there was a lack of expertise on New York state raffle law, which is actually quite complicated and like, in order to not legal implication at all.
00:42:50.032 - 00:43:01.644, Speaker B: Yes. I mean, you have to advertise the total prize that's being raffled away, you know, and what the odds of winning are. Bounds on the odds of winning are. Yes.
00:43:02.384 - 00:43:12.044, Speaker A: I'm curious if it's possible to make a direct comparison between the incentive solution and just higher Montrose solution. Is it possible to estimate improvement in objective functions per dollar spent?
00:43:14.784 - 00:43:24.544, Speaker B: I would guess that it is possible. However, given that they're spending very little on this, I think I know which way the outcome will go.
