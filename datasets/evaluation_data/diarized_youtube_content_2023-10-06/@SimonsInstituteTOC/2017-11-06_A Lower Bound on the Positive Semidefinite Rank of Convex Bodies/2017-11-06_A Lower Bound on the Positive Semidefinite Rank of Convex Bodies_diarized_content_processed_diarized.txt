00:00:00.200 - 00:00:13.754, Speaker A: All right, so welcome, welcome, everyone back. We have a series of four shorter talks this afternoon. The first will be Hansa Fousey from University of Cambridge, who will tell us about a lower bound on the positive semi definite rank of conduct.
00:00:14.174 - 00:00:16.074, Speaker B: Thanks a lot, Cynthia. Oops.
00:00:16.894 - 00:00:56.606, Speaker C: So, thanks a lot, Cynthia, and thanks a lot for the organizers for inviting me. So I'll talk about the lower bound on the PSD rank of convex bodies. But really, this work is actually a connection between the PSD rank and something called the algebraic degree of semi definition programming, which is a quantity introduced by Jean Wangier, Christian Renestad, and Bern Schumpfels, which I will explain in the talk. So, just to make sure we're all on the same page, so I want to give the definition. So, I'm working. Essentially, the main concept of this talk is the notion of a semi definite lift. So if I have C is a convex body, I say C has a semi definite lift.
00:00:56.606 - 00:01:30.742, Speaker C: If it can be written in the following form, it's a projection, or the image under a linear map of a spectrahedron. So, a spectrahedron is a set defined using a linear matrix inequality. So you have matrices, symmetric matrices of size m, say a zero up to a n, and you look at the set of x such that this linear matrix is positive, semi definite. That's a spectrohedron. And if you can project this and you get c, this is a semi definite lift. And the size of the lift is going to be the size of the matrices m. And the PSD rank of a convex body is the size of.
00:01:30.758 - 00:01:33.792, Speaker B: The smallest SDP lift of this convex body. Okay?
00:01:33.888 - 00:01:50.360, Speaker C: So this is an example of Sdplift. So this is a linear matrix inequality here. This describes a certain convex set in three dimensions, x one, x two, and u. This is the set that you see here. And if you project it on x one and x two, you get the square. So this is an SDP lift of.
00:01:50.392 - 00:01:53.920, Speaker B: Size three of the square of minus one squared.
00:01:54.112 - 00:01:55.764, Speaker D: That would not be the smallest.
00:01:56.224 - 00:01:57.492, Speaker C: That is the smallest.
00:01:57.648 - 00:01:59.024, Speaker B: So, okay.
00:02:03.444 - 00:02:52.004, Speaker C: Yes. So how do we actually construct SDPlift? So, we have a general method of constructing SDplift based on the sum of squares method. So essentially, you try to certify all the valid linear inequalities of your convex sets using sums of squares from a certain low dimensional subspace, and this gives you a certain SDP lift. So there's a nice theory behind this, but what I'll be interested in here is on trying to prove optimality of certain lifts. So, essentially, trying to prove lower bounds on the PSD rank, because actually the PSD rank of some very basic convex sets is still unknown. So if you look at the regular polygons in the plane. So these shapes, these convex bodies here, we don't know what their PSD rank is, or for example the PSD rank of the permutahedron, this object here, which is the convex hull of all possible permutations of the vector one, two, three up to n.
00:02:52.004 - 00:02:53.342, Speaker C: This convex set, we.
00:02:53.358 - 00:02:55.834, Speaker B: Also don't know what its PSD rank is.
00:02:57.094 - 00:03:29.890, Speaker C: And in fact the main motivation for this work is actually a very simple fact about LP lifts and which is an observation due to Michel Goemond. So first one is an LP lift of a polytope. So an Lp lift of a polytope is a representation of a polytope as the projection of another polyhedron. And the size of this representation is the number of facets of the polyhedron upstairs. So we heard about this in the first couple of talks. And so I'm going to call the Lp rank, or the non negative rank of a polytope is the smallest size.
00:03:29.922 - 00:03:31.014, Speaker B: Of an Lp list.
00:03:31.594 - 00:04:14.834, Speaker C: So the observation of Goemont tells us that if p is a polytope, then the non negative rank of p, or the smallest Lp formulation of p, is at least the logarithm of the number of vertices of the polytope. And the proof is very simple. So what is the proof? So assume that I can write p as the projection of a certain polyhedron q, which has m facets. So I want to lower bound m. So the main observation is that if I take a vertex of my polytope p and I look at its preimage in q, this is going to be a face of q. This is not difficult to show. And now we use kind of a crucial property of polyhedra is that any face of q is an intersection of facets.
00:04:14.834 - 00:04:18.522, Speaker C: And because I have m facets, okay, I can have at most two to.
00:04:18.538 - 00:04:20.106, Speaker B: The m, such faces, okay?
00:04:20.130 - 00:04:27.298, Speaker C: So essentially the number of, so what we've shown is that the number of vertices is at most two to the m, where m is the number of facets of my, of q.
00:04:27.426 - 00:04:29.202, Speaker B: And so I have, I have this lower bound, okay?
00:04:29.218 - 00:05:35.994, Speaker C: So it's a very simple result, okay, and my, so the motivation for this work was to try to find a similar kind of lower bound for this, because in fact this bound turns, actually turns out to be tight for these examples that I mentioned before. So for the regular n gon, the lp extension complexity of the regular n gon is log n, and for the permutahedron also this bound turns out to be tight. So how can we kind of generalize this to get a lower bound on the PSD rank? So there is one first kind of idea that one can try and that one can implement, which is the idea based on quantifier elimination. So the idea is as follows. So first, actually we have to observe that since if we're working with SDP lifts and if I work with a convex body, so I need to find kind of another notion other than the number of vertices. And it's not very difficult to see that the kind of, the relevant notion that you would want to work with is the degree of the boundary of the convex set. So if you look at the convex set, you can look at its boundary, that's the hyper surface.
00:05:35.994 - 00:05:43.436, Speaker C: So you can look at what the smallest degree of a polynomial that vanishes on this hypersurface. And this is the quantity that will.
00:05:43.460 - 00:05:44.984, Speaker B: Show up instead of this.
00:05:48.764 - 00:07:01.958, Speaker C: So let's try to implement this line of thought. So assume that I have a convex body c and it's a projection of a certain spectrahedron. I know this spectrahedron is a semi algebraic set. So I can write polynomials that define this spectrahedron, for example by looking at all the minors and saying that they're non negative, or by using something a bit better, say the Descartes rule of sign on the determinant on the characteristic polynomial of this, and then by using results based on quantifier elimination. These results allow us to get a description of the projection of s of c, and the complexity analysis of these quantifier elimination algorithms will actually tell us how many polynomials you will need to describe c and what is the degree of these polynomials. And so essentially it will tell us, it will give us an upper bound on the degree of the boundary of this convex set c. So in fact, if we implement this result and use the kind of the hammers or the really heavyweight results from quantifier elimination, then we get that the PSD rank of the convex of any convex body c is bigger than this, than this quantity.
00:07:01.958 - 00:07:07.662, Speaker C: So here, this is a root of log d over n log log d, where d here is the degree of.
00:07:07.678 - 00:07:09.718, Speaker B: The boundary of my convex body.
00:07:09.766 - 00:07:17.634, Speaker C: So that's the smallest degree of a polynomial that vanishes on the boundary of C. And n is the dimension of my convex body.
00:07:18.934 - 00:07:25.034, Speaker B: So is this kind of, okay, so.
00:07:25.734 - 00:07:55.834, Speaker C: One, I mean, so I think one major drawback about this lower bound is that the constants here are really not explicit. I mean, if we look at these complexity results in quantifier elimination, they involve a lot of constants that are actually very large. I mean, they're often not explicit and most likely they're very large. And another kind of drawback of this is that we don't have a way really to check whether this is tight because we're using somehow in a black box way, this results from quantifier elimination. So we cannot really know if these.
00:07:55.914 - 00:07:57.574, Speaker B: Are actually tight or not.
00:07:59.114 - 00:09:02.664, Speaker C: So the results that I want to present today is kind of a way to find a lower bound in the same spirit, but with actually explicit constants. So these are the results. So the result that I'm going to present using a crucial way, the notion of a polar, of a convex body. See? So the polar lives in the dual space, in the space of linear functions, the set of linear functions that attains a maximum of at most one on c. And so the first result, which is the lower bound, it tells us that if c is a convex body and d is the smallest degree of a polynomial that vanishes on the boundary of the polar. So now this is the quantity that shows up in the lower bound, then the PSD rank is at least root of log d. Okay, so just to be sure, I mean, if c is a polytope, okay, if c is a polytope, then the polar, essentially the facets of the polar are really the vertices of my polytope.
00:09:02.664 - 00:09:18.108, Speaker C: And so d here is going to be the number of vertices of the polytope, because you need, I mean, if you have a polytope with d facets, then the degree of the smallest polynomial that vanishes on the boundary is d, because you need exactly one linear polynomial.
00:09:18.156 - 00:09:20.744, Speaker B: Per facet of the polytope.
00:09:22.484 - 00:09:25.652, Speaker C: So this is the lower bound we get.
00:09:25.788 - 00:09:28.820, Speaker D: It should be vanished exactly on the boundary and nowhere else.
00:09:28.932 - 00:09:32.620, Speaker C: No, no, it can vanish also. I mean, it can vanish elsewhere.
00:09:32.732 - 00:09:36.124, Speaker D: Then what about the zero, just the polynomial which is equal to zero.
00:09:36.204 - 00:09:37.824, Speaker B: No, so a non zero polynomial.
00:09:43.214 - 00:09:58.086, Speaker C: So, yes, and in fact, okay, later in the talk, I'll talk about the algebra, the algebraic boundary of a convex set. So this is actually the smallest, what we call the smallest algebraic variety that contains the boundary of a convex set.
00:09:58.190 - 00:10:01.154, Speaker B: Okay, so I'll get to this a bit later.
00:10:02.334 - 00:10:16.370, Speaker C: So this is the lower bound. And in fact, so we show also that this lower bound is tight. So we show that there exists convex bodies such that the PSD rank is at most root, I mean, some constant times root log d. And d can be made arbitrary.
00:10:16.562 - 00:10:18.494, Speaker B: So we show that this is.
00:10:20.034 - 00:10:21.818, Speaker C: So is the statement of the theorem clear?
00:10:21.906 - 00:10:24.490, Speaker B: Or is there any questions about this?
00:10:24.522 - 00:10:29.334, Speaker C: So again, for polytopes, this would be d here would be really the number of vertices.
00:10:30.554 - 00:10:32.850, Speaker B: So, but here you talk about the.
00:10:32.882 - 00:10:37.542, Speaker D: Polynomial that vanished on the boundary of this polar.
00:10:37.598 - 00:10:39.166, Speaker B: Okay, yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:10:39.350 - 00:10:55.590, Speaker C: So, okay, maybe I should mention this. The PSD rank of a convex body and of its polar are equal. So you can also put this to be the degree of the thing that varies on the boundary of C. But in fact, the reason I put the polar is because the polar is really a crucial tool that we use in the proof.
00:10:55.622 - 00:11:03.072, Speaker B: So it would be kind of hiding something. Yes, yeah, sorry.
00:11:03.128 - 00:11:05.056, Speaker E: So could you just clarify where is.
00:11:05.080 - 00:11:05.984, Speaker B: It allowed to vanish?
00:11:06.024 - 00:11:09.040, Speaker E: Is it allowed to vanish inside or outside?
00:11:09.152 - 00:11:11.848, Speaker C: No. So it just has to vanish on the boundary.
00:11:11.936 - 00:11:14.724, Speaker B: So what it does anywhere else doesn't matter except.
00:11:15.904 - 00:11:16.776, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly.
00:11:16.880 - 00:11:19.920, Speaker B: It just, yeah, yeah, exactly. Okay. Is that.
00:11:20.112 - 00:11:26.648, Speaker E: Yes, but the algebraic degree for c and the polar need not be the same, right?
00:11:26.776 - 00:11:28.164, Speaker B: No, no, no, they're not the same.
00:11:28.304 - 00:11:29.420, Speaker E: So you could have like a max.
00:11:29.452 - 00:11:30.244, Speaker C: You could have the max.
00:11:30.284 - 00:11:31.504, Speaker B: Yes, yeah, exactly.
00:11:32.084 - 00:11:48.660, Speaker C: So, okay, let me give an example then, because I think, just to clarify this. So if I have a spectrohedron like this, okay, I claim there is a polynomial of degree m that vanishes on the boundary of this. So can you give it to me? So what the determinant. Exactly.
00:11:48.692 - 00:11:49.384, Speaker B: Okay.
00:11:49.684 - 00:11:57.280, Speaker C: But in general, the polar of this thing will have the boundary of the. The boundary of the polar of this will actually have a degree that is.
00:11:57.312 - 00:11:58.564, Speaker B: Much larger than this.
00:11:59.944 - 00:12:03.444, Speaker C: But for spectra, Hydra defined using matrix of size m, it is m.
00:12:05.824 - 00:12:06.604, Speaker B: Yes.
00:12:07.184 - 00:12:18.464, Speaker F: When you go to your bound. Yeah, I mean, of course you can make it symmetric between primal and dual by taking the maximum. Yes, more natural. Like if you look at the joint.
00:12:18.584 - 00:12:22.464, Speaker B: C cross c cross c polar and.
00:12:23.684 - 00:12:25.316, Speaker C: Oh, yeah, I didn't think of this.
00:12:25.340 - 00:12:26.704, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe this is actually nice.
00:12:30.604 - 00:12:32.340, Speaker C: Any other questions about the statement?
00:12:32.452 - 00:12:34.024, Speaker B: Is the statement kind of clear?
00:12:36.284 - 00:12:47.624, Speaker C: So now I want to. Okay, so in order to prove this result, I want to kind of forget a little bit about lifts and go back to something very standard in optimization, which is KKT system.
00:12:47.684 - 00:12:49.244, Speaker B: Okay, KKT constraints.
00:12:49.584 - 00:13:05.456, Speaker C: So let's assume I have a certain semi definite program like this. So I want to maximize c transpose x subject to this linear matrix inequality. Okay, so we know from standard convex optimization that a point x is optimal if it, if there exists a certain dual variable z such that the following.
00:13:05.520 - 00:13:09.576, Speaker B: KKT system is satisfied. What does KKT stand for.
00:13:09.680 - 00:13:11.456, Speaker C: Okay, that's Karushkun tookr.
00:13:11.600 - 00:13:13.358, Speaker B: Okay. Yeah.
00:13:13.456 - 00:13:43.250, Speaker C: So that's, these are three people. So this is the primal feasibility. Then we have dual feasibility, which is this and this. And then we have the complementary slackness, which is this. But essentially, the key point to know about this is that these are polynomial systems. So we have these quadratic equations in x and z, these are linear equations in z, and these are inequalities in x and z. So I want to deal with polynomial equations only.
00:13:43.250 - 00:14:15.892, Speaker C: So I want to get rid somehow of these inequalities. And then the question that I'm going to ask is, let's try to. Yeah, so let's just get rid of these inequalities, and let's think just of this polynomial system. And let's ask, what are the solutions of this polynomial system? Okay, so this is a valid question that I could ask. Okay, so first I can actually ask, are there just a finite number of solutions? I mean, I know there's only one unique solution of this system. Now I can ask, is there just one unique solution to this? Is there finitely number of solutions? Is there actually a manifold, say, of dimension? What is the dimension of the solutions?
00:14:15.948 - 00:14:16.784, Speaker B: And so on.
00:14:18.124 - 00:14:46.902, Speaker C: So let's rewrite. So this is exactly the same system that you saw before, but I've just rewritten it. So I've introduced x just to stand for a of x. And the first fact that one should know about this system of KKT equations is that this system is actually has a finite number of solutions only. This is something that you can prove. And the reason, so this is formally, this is an application of what we call the Bertini theorem. But it's actually not very easy to see.
00:14:46.902 - 00:15:28.656, Speaker C: I mean, you don't really need to know Bertini theorem to believe this statement. So the reason for this is that if we look at the structure of this polynomial system, so this is a certain variety defined using quadratic equations, and these are two linear equations. So we're essentially intersecting a certain variety with a certain subspace. So if you compute the dimension of this variety and the dimension of this subspace, you'll find if the dimension of this variety, say, is k, you can show the co dimension of this subspace is k also. And so we know that if you have a manifold of dimension k, you're intersecting with a subspace of co dimension k, you get something of dimension zero. So you can show that this is a zero dimension variety. So this is essentially what happens.
00:15:28.656 - 00:16:17.764, Speaker C: And you need the AI's to be generic so that you don't have things don't mess up. So this is why we have the genericity assumption on a zero up to and c. This is really not difficult to see. And so then now we can ask, how many solutions does it have? Okay, and now this is where we're going to use the Bezou bound. Okay, so what is the Bezou bound? So, the Bezel bound essentially tells you that if you have a system of polynomial equations and you know that this system has only a finite number of solutions in the complex numbers, then the number of such solutions is upper bounded by the product of the degrees of these polynomials. So if we look at this system, I have here m squared polynomials of degree two, and then here, these are all linear equations. And so I have two to the m squared.
00:16:17.764 - 00:16:20.412, Speaker C: I mean, if I apply the Bezou bound to this system, I get two.
00:16:20.428 - 00:16:21.464, Speaker B: To the m squared.
00:16:23.764 - 00:16:57.710, Speaker C: So, essentially, this argument, I mean, these two lines tell me that this system generically has two to the m squared solutions in the complex numbers. And this is where the notion of algebraic degree comes into play. Is that now in this paper. So, by j one, Christian and Bernd, they ask, what is actually the exact number of solutions to the system? So this just gives us an upper bound. So what is the exact number of solutions? And this is where the notion of the algebraic degree of semi definition programming comes into play. This is actually the exact number. And in fact, more precisely.
00:16:57.710 - 00:17:15.454, Speaker C: So what they do is that they look at the irreducible decomposition of this variety, and they compute the degree of each irreducible component. Okay, but I will skip this part. Maybe I'll get back to it a bit later in the proof of the other part. So, but is this kind of. Are these two points?
00:17:15.534 - 00:17:16.274, Speaker B: Okay.
00:17:18.854 - 00:18:01.342, Speaker C: So, so now let's go back to our, let's prove our lower bound. So, in fact, the proof is very simple. So, if I have a convex body C, and I assume that it's the projection of a certain spectrohedron. So what I will do is that I will exhibit a system of polynomial equations that vanish on the boundary of the polar, okay? And in fact, it turns out that this system is nothing but the KKT equations. Are nothing but the KKT equation. So let me try to explain this. So what does it mean for a point c to be on the boundary of the polar? Okay, so this means that its maximum on C is equal to one, okay? But then I know that C has a semi definite representation.
00:18:01.342 - 00:18:13.670, Speaker C: So I can rewrite this optimization problem here, I can rewrite it as a certain semi definite program. Okay, so this is a spectrohedron. So this is a semi definite program. And the cos now is PI star of C, where PI star is just.
00:18:13.702 - 00:18:15.394, Speaker B: The adjoint of, of PI.
00:18:17.534 - 00:19:08.590, Speaker C: So now this is an SDP. So I can write that this statement here is equivalent to a certain system of KKT conditions. So this is equivalent to the existence of a certain z, such that this is true. And now let me get rid of these inequalities, and let me just keep these polynomial equations. So what I've shown essentially, is that if C lies on the boundary of the polar of c, then these polynomial equations have to be true. So what we have shown essentially, is that we have a certain polynomial system that vanishes on the boundary of C. And so if I just look at the degree of this polynomial system, this will give me an upper bound on the degree of the polar, of the boundary of the Polaroff C.
00:19:08.590 - 00:19:29.462, Speaker C: Okay. And so again, by using Bezou bound, I mean, this is exactly the same argument that we saw in the previous slide. We know that we get our result, essentially that there is a polynomial of degree, at most two to the m squared that vanishes on the boundary of.
00:19:29.478 - 00:19:32.358, Speaker B: The polar of circumstances.
00:19:32.436 - 00:19:48.850, Speaker C: So, I mean, I've skipped something here, is that, I mean, I've skipped a small detail here, because we were dealing with a finite number of solutions to the KKT system here. We're losing, we're working kind of with this hyper surface, but it's really, I mean, there's just a small technical detail that.
00:19:48.962 - 00:19:54.454, Speaker B: Yeah, it's, this is really just the idea, essentially, just apply Bayesu bound on the system.
00:19:55.474 - 00:20:03.986, Speaker C: So this is really the lower bound. I mean, this proves the lower bound, because then you just invert this function, root log d. So are there any questions about.
00:20:04.050 - 00:20:04.826, Speaker B: Yes. Yeah.
00:20:04.970 - 00:20:20.194, Speaker D: So since the correct way of writing complementarity is a z plus z, a equal to zero, because you are in the symmetric world, or m times m plus one over two, or.
00:20:20.354 - 00:20:28.540, Speaker C: Oh, yeah, yeah, because, yeah. So that's actually a good point. Yeah. So we didn't try to optimize very much. So we just said, yeah, this is.
00:20:28.682 - 00:20:29.784, Speaker D: So anything counts.
00:20:29.864 - 00:20:40.136, Speaker C: Yeah. Yeah, exactly. So these two is true. A and z are symmetric. So a times z is not necessarily symmetric. So that's why I have an m squared. I don't have an m plus one.
00:20:40.136 - 00:20:45.760, Speaker C: Choose two here. Maybe it could be optimized, I don't know.
00:20:45.792 - 00:20:46.404, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:20:49.464 - 00:20:55.876, Speaker F: So how much of a difference is there between the two m square upper bound versus algebra degree.
00:20:56.020 - 00:20:59.948, Speaker C: It's actually. Yeah, asymptotically, it's this. Yeah, I will talk about this in.
00:20:59.956 - 00:21:01.904, Speaker B: The, in the, in the other part.
00:21:02.564 - 00:21:05.460, Speaker C: But, but before I do. So is there any question about this proof?
00:21:05.532 - 00:21:07.544, Speaker B: The general idea, is it, is it clear?
00:21:09.684 - 00:21:14.012, Speaker C: So let me now prove to. I mean, now I want to show that this bound is essentially tied up to constants.
00:21:14.068 - 00:21:14.316, Speaker B: Okay.
00:21:14.340 - 00:21:18.900, Speaker C: And this is where I will crucially reuse the formulas for the algebraic degree. I really need them.
00:21:18.932 - 00:21:20.564, Speaker B: Okay. So just.
00:21:24.744 - 00:21:27.704, Speaker E: We didn't use that much about PSD.
00:21:27.744 - 00:21:28.404, Speaker B: Ness.
00:21:30.304 - 00:21:32.696, Speaker E: Or I guess, in deriving the dual.
00:21:32.800 - 00:21:35.656, Speaker B: Yes, yeah, yeah, but then when you.
00:21:35.680 - 00:21:36.944, Speaker E: Extract the algebraic degree.
00:21:36.984 - 00:21:38.600, Speaker C: Yeah, it's true. We forget about this somehow.
00:21:38.632 - 00:21:40.324, Speaker B: Yeah, but, yeah, but that's.
00:21:45.304 - 00:22:16.684, Speaker C: Okay, so let me now, okay, this was kind of an illustration of this. So you can actually implement. I mean, I have a certain linear matrix equality that projects on the Pentagon. And then I essentially just compute. I look at this variety defined by these equations and I plot it using maple, and I observe that I actually do get the boundary of the polar of the pentagon, which is a slightly rotated pentagon. But actually what we observe is that you also obtain some components that do not belong to the boundary that are spurious. So I'll come back to this also.
00:22:16.684 - 00:22:19.812, Speaker C: So now let's move on, because I'm.
00:22:19.828 - 00:22:21.988, Speaker B: A bit short of time.
00:22:22.036 - 00:22:44.632, Speaker C: So, okay, this was another application in upper bounding, the number of vertices of convex bodies. So essentially, a vertex of a convex body is a point where the normal cone is full dimensional. So this was studied by Monique, for example, for the elliptope, where she showed that the vertices of the elliptope are exactly these cut matrices. And I think levent also had a.
00:22:44.648 - 00:22:45.644, Speaker B: Paper on vertices.
00:22:49.144 - 00:23:11.512, Speaker C: Of certain spectra hydron their shadows. And so, but we couldn't actually find in the literature any upper bound on vertices. So this kind of a corollary of our result is that it says that any. That if I have a convex body with an SDP representation of size m, then it has at most two to the m squared vertices, because essentially each vertex of c has to contribute a.
00:23:11.528 - 00:23:13.604, Speaker B: Linear factor in the boundary of the pole.
00:23:17.994 - 00:23:29.974, Speaker C: Okay, so how do we prove then, the fact that this is tight? So the convex bodies for which this will be tight are random spectra, Hydra. So these are chosen generically somehow.
00:23:31.514 - 00:23:34.174, Speaker B: So, okay, let me.
00:23:35.314 - 00:23:49.514, Speaker C: I want to. Yeah, so this is really the main point of the result is that. So if I take c to be a generic spectrahedron, okay. Defined using a certain linear matrix, inequality like this, then we know that the.
00:23:50.734 - 00:23:59.262, Speaker B: So, okay, maybe I have five minutes. I just want to write something. Where is the. Yeah, so what?
00:23:59.318 - 00:24:00.654, Speaker C: So remember the.
00:24:00.814 - 00:24:20.210, Speaker B: So I have, this is it. So one. And then I have, and I also have c comma, x is equal to one.
00:24:20.282 - 00:24:30.738, Speaker C: Okay, so we saw that. If I look at this polynomial system. So where my. These are my variables, really?
00:24:30.786 - 00:24:31.374, Speaker B: So.
00:24:35.044 - 00:25:12.444, Speaker C: X and z. Okay, so if I look at this polynomial system, which I project on c, we saw, I mean, the argument we saw before is that this is a polynomial system that vanishes on the boundary of the polar. Okay, so now I can also do. So if you want to understand the irreducible decomposition of the system. Essentially what you want to do is to put rank constraints on x. So you put rank of x smaller than r and rank of z smaller than m minus r, and you can show, and this is in the paper of Nier, Randesta and Schoenfels, is essentially, these will be irreducible. And each one of these, this is what I call VR.
00:25:12.444 - 00:25:24.116, Speaker C: These form an irreducible decomposition of this algebraic variety. Sorry, I mean, these are all irreducibles, and they cover somehow this.
00:25:24.180 - 00:25:25.064, Speaker B: Okay, but.
00:25:26.964 - 00:25:39.092, Speaker C: What is potentially the case is that it may be that one of VR is not necessarily actually in this algebraic variety, because it doesn't touch. I mean, it doesn't touch the real.
00:25:39.188 - 00:25:41.624, Speaker B: Sema algebraic set, the boundary really.
00:25:42.964 - 00:26:31.276, Speaker C: But really, the main point that I want to make here, and this is the word irreducible here, is really key, because if I show that for a certain value of r, that this VR touches this thing, then I know that the whole VR has to be inside it. And really, the degrees of the VR are the ones that were computed in this paper by Nier, Reinestad and Sturmfels. So we need a little bit of machinery to show that there is a certain r for which it will be contained in here. But then if we do this, and then we, we essentially do an analysis, an asymptotic analysis of these algebraic degrees. So we show that the roughly two to the m squared for a certain value of r. Okay, we can get, we somehow get the result. Okay, sorry, I'm a bit out of time, so I have to be a bit quick, but this is roughly the.
00:26:31.300 - 00:26:34.104, Speaker B: Idea of the proof.
00:26:34.444 - 00:26:57.336, Speaker C: So. Okay, so just to wrap up. So I think one important question is to know if the lower bound can be improved if we assume the convex body c to be a polytoe. Okay, so this we don't know. I mean, because we don't have any example for which this is tight, but where c is really a polytope. In particular, what is the positive, semi.
00:26:57.360 - 00:27:00.044, Speaker B: Definite rank of regular polygons in the plane? We don't know.
00:27:00.664 - 00:27:03.888, Speaker C: And then there are a couple of other questions that maybe I will just.
00:27:03.936 - 00:27:17.194, Speaker B: Keep and I will finish here. Thanks a lot. Yes. Yeah.
00:27:17.854 - 00:27:21.126, Speaker E: Do we have time results for like the two to the n gon or.
00:27:21.230 - 00:27:23.286, Speaker C: No, do we have what, sorry, type.
00:27:23.310 - 00:27:25.694, Speaker E: Results when like it's a two to the n gon?
00:27:25.734 - 00:27:26.846, Speaker B: No, we don't have any.
00:27:26.990 - 00:27:30.914, Speaker E: So what is the PSD rank now that we have. Don't you have this result?
00:27:31.374 - 00:27:32.514, Speaker B: I don't know.
00:27:32.934 - 00:27:38.582, Speaker C: So we just have a construction of log of size log n, and the lower bound is root log n, and.
00:27:38.598 - 00:27:40.474, Speaker B: We don't know if it's where is it.
00:27:44.814 - 00:27:47.794, Speaker D: So for the lP, would the log be bound for which.
00:27:48.534 - 00:27:52.554, Speaker C: Yeah, for polygons. It's tied for polygons, it's typed for the permutahedron also.
00:27:52.894 - 00:27:53.230, Speaker B: Right.
00:27:53.262 - 00:27:54.582, Speaker C: So this is the construction of gomans.
00:27:54.598 - 00:28:00.542, Speaker B: Where he used sorting networks to get an n log n. So that's, are.
00:28:00.558 - 00:28:11.438, Speaker C: There better sdp representations for either? I don't know, and that's why actually it would be interesting to understand this question. I mean, if we can prove that it's log d for, for polytopes, then.
00:28:11.486 - 00:28:20.194, Speaker B: We will show that it's not possible. But we don't know. Really. Yeah. Any other question?
00:28:21.054 - 00:28:24.874, Speaker F: What's the candidate for this explicit? Is there a natural candidate?
00:28:25.334 - 00:28:26.590, Speaker B: I don't know. No, no, I have.
00:28:26.622 - 00:28:54.970, Speaker C: No, it seems, I think what we would need, I mean, so from the construction here, I, I mean, I have some indication of what the subs, I mean, what the dimension it should be. I mean, the dimension should really be in the half of the dimension. I mean, it should be in the bad kind of regime. I think it should not be very symmetric. It seems to be these things. I mean, as soon as you're symmetric, it seems that the two to the m squared drops to two to the m somehow. I'm not sure exactly why, but this seems to be kind of.
00:28:55.002 - 00:29:03.364, Speaker B: What? And, but yeah, I don't have any explicit, any idea.
00:29:04.864 - 00:29:06.144, Speaker A: Okay, let's take Hans.
