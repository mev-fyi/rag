00:00:01.240 - 00:00:03.554, Speaker A: What will I talk about? That's a good question.
00:00:04.894 - 00:00:08.502, Speaker B: Humerus, brachiometry, and, I believe, tropical curves.
00:00:08.678 - 00:01:05.436, Speaker A: Right. So I'm going to talk about computation of tropical curves using hemotropy continuation. And that's joint work with Anders Janssen and Josephine Yu. I'm gonna follow the passionate recommendation of one of the organizers and give the total board talk. I also believe that last is more. That's why we have eight talks a day instead of a dozen. So let me, you know, we could.
00:01:05.460 - 00:01:06.624, Speaker B: Just cancel your talk.
00:01:07.844 - 00:01:56.594, Speaker A: All right, that would work. But let me entertain you further. Consider a curve. It's a curve in c n. It's a complex curve. So I should tell that this project, well, we start talking about the idea maybe about three or four years ago, and there are many people to thank for talking to us. In particular, we talked about this with Mikhail Pasare back in Sweden maybe three years ago.
00:01:56.594 - 00:02:50.804, Speaker A: And what Mikhail would do, he would apply to this, the following map. So suppose your coordinates here are x one through xn. They do get maps into log of the absolute values of x one through xn. So you get something in the space rn and that something would look. Well, okay, this something would be called amoeba. So we are in the world of biology here. Okay, I think I drew enough.
00:02:50.804 - 00:02:52.944, Speaker A: Is there an eraser?
00:02:53.104 - 00:02:53.896, Speaker B: Right there?
00:02:54.040 - 00:03:33.388, Speaker A: Okay, got it. So, what you should imagine. Let me draw some holes for the dramatic effect. So what you should imagine is this body in rn and one way to define a tropical curve. So this is called an amoeba. Amoeba. One way to define a tropical curve is to take.
00:03:33.388 - 00:04:20.912, Speaker A: Well, let's say I have an ideal defining the original curve. And let's say it's in c during all these variables. The tropicalization of that is going to be the limit. The limit when t goes to infinity of one over t script a of I, where a of I is this amoeba I drew? Okay, so what is that set? I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Log base t in this case, log base.
00:04:20.928 - 00:04:21.920, Speaker B: Well, it's the same thing as taking.
00:04:21.952 - 00:04:55.024, Speaker A: Log base t. Yeah, it's the same thing as if you would take the. If you change the base of the log, you can do this instead. Well, what happens in this picture, it sort of shrinks and moves a little bit. And maybe you get something like this. Okay, so this would be rays with integer slopes, slopes emanating from the origin. So that's what Mikhail passare would do.
00:04:55.024 - 00:05:25.004, Speaker A: What Bernst Dan McLagan would do in their book, mostly is different definition, they would take t of I to be the set of w's that are in rn such that the initial ideal with the weight w contains no monomials.
00:05:28.864 - 00:05:33.112, Speaker B: Could you say exactly what a of I is? Because I got a little confused with.
00:05:33.128 - 00:05:47.914, Speaker A: The discussion on it. AI is the image of this curve. So this is a two dimensional real object that maps into two dimensional real thing with boundary in our edge log. Yeah, the logo put your favorite base.
00:05:48.534 - 00:05:57.234, Speaker B: And you fix that and divide by t. So it's the same map, the same map for all t. And then.
00:05:58.214 - 00:06:07.670, Speaker A: It seems, oh, t. It doesn't change. This particular doesn't change. I'm just taking this limit, set limit.
00:06:07.742 - 00:06:19.740, Speaker B: How does t play a role in a of I? Otherwise the limit is just the constant AI. But you pick out the rays that go to infinity.
00:06:19.892 - 00:07:06.104, Speaker A: Okay, try it. Try it on the computer. Maybe. I've actually never tried it. So maybe just to a more concrete example, let's do the following curve. One plus x, one cubed plus x squared is going to be our x, two squared is going to be our ideal. And that will look, that would be some elliptic curve, and in c two.
00:07:06.104 - 00:08:02.014, Speaker A: And of course it maps into something like this. So you will have the slope, I mean the ray two three given by a primitive vector two three in the integers. And here you will have minus e, two minus. Okay, so the way to compute this curve, well, here it's easy. You can draw a Newton polytope and it will look like this. And you would compute the outer normal to the Newton polytope of this one equation and get all the initial ideals that do not contain monomials. In more general, and I'm going to pick another color to write it.
00:08:02.014 - 00:08:51.994, Speaker A: In a more general case, you would use software by Anders Janssen. It's called GfEN, and it does it for you on small problems, on large problems, sometimes on very large problems. But on very, very large problems, it fails. So forget about this definition. Well, what we try to do is experiment with a very, very naive idea. So remember, there is an amoeba floating around here. So I'm just drawing the boundary of it that limits to this tropical curve.
00:08:51.994 - 00:09:56.574, Speaker A: So what I would do is, let's say, take one tentacle of it and try to explain this idea in pictures. Well, what a numerical algebraic geometry would do to any picture. He or she would slice it. So we would like to slice this with, with, let's call it h, which is going to be just a set, just a set of points. Capital x, I will use capital x. For these log coordinates where x dot v is equal to c, where b is the normal to this hyperplane. And, well, for simplicity, I'm going to take it integer.
00:09:56.574 - 00:11:24.598, Speaker A: What do I get in the slice? In the slice, well, this is a full bodied thing. So in the slice I get a segment, but if I do take two slices that are parallel, I get two segments. And perhaps I don't want to compute points, the full segments, but I would like to sample some points in the segments. So to that end, I would introduce the ideal I D small c, which is going to be I plus the ideal defined by x to the power of v minus c, where I make sure that the small c is in relationship with the big c, which is the most natural one. C, capital c is going to be log of the absolute values. Okay, well, now I'm in a situation where I can compute, so I can compute the zero dimensional variety, which is the variety defined by IVc. That will give me only several points.
00:11:24.598 - 00:12:47.204, Speaker A: So let's say if this is my c, then it will give me several points on this slice. But then I'm going to create a homotopy that will continue c zero. So consider homotopy C of s, where s goes from zero to one in such a way that the log of the absolute value of c increases or non decreases. Then it guarantees that you stay in the same tentacle and you would end up, well, there are some paths that lead you here. So follow the hemotropy C o S. And finally what you would do, you would just compute the differences between the endpoints. And in number three, you would take these guys, which are vectors in rn, and process them with your favorite technique of getting integers out of real numbers.
00:12:47.204 - 00:13:10.024, Speaker A: The favorite technique we use is lll. You can read about the paper. It's a very simple setup. So there you get your candidate. Raise that later. We might want to do something with. So it's an experimental computation.
00:13:10.024 - 00:13:21.562, Speaker A: I mean, you run it many times with many different parameters and try to get some set, which is the set of integer vectors that would generate your rays.
00:13:21.658 - 00:13:25.574, Speaker B: So Anton, the number of black paths, that's going to be the multiplicity.
00:13:26.154 - 00:14:07.916, Speaker A: Yeah, it's common. So it's sort of a multiplicity of a tentacle. There could be many tentacles, by the way, in the same direction. At this point we are just in block number zero of this procedure. We would like to find some suspicious race that may be candidates for our thing. And actually that was like on small examples, we made an undergraduate who did an reU in Georgia tech to run small examples, and we saw that it actually worked. Henry Duan was his name, and Robert Krohn, who's in the audience, was participating in these discussions.
00:14:07.916 - 00:14:17.084, Speaker A: So. Okay, well, I mean, we can stop here and declare that for some values of parameters, our thing works and gives us the correct.
00:14:19.184 - 00:14:22.124, Speaker B: Log. You have to compute the log at some moment.
00:14:26.504 - 00:14:37.386, Speaker A: You do compute the log. Yeah. So you get the points. Right. So the picture is drawn and the log coordinates. Yeah. So just fill in the blanks.
00:14:37.386 - 00:15:27.614, Speaker A: I have only ten more minutes to go. All right, so what do we do next? Well, we changed the field. So instead of c here, I would consider now the ideal in the field where the coefficients of those series. So k is ct. And suppose I do get a point. Well, maybe I should redraw this picture anatomically correct. So, for this particular example, let's say I get a point w equal to two, three.
00:15:27.614 - 00:16:43.344, Speaker A: So what I want to do next is to consider curves with non constant coefficients, Torvagall curves with non constant coefficients, and do the same slice through the, through the point. So here I can take one minus one. Yeah, that would work. One minus one as the direction. So, very similarly to this setup, I can define I, v, c of t, which is my I plus x to the v minus c of t, where c of t is now a piezo series with the same valuation as, where the degree of c of t is equal to. Well, I mean, I would have to pick it. V dot.
00:16:43.344 - 00:18:35.932, Speaker A: Oh, here the degree, the degree, the degree of t has to be set to minus one. There are some conventions that are floating around, but basically, this is what happens in the picture, in the valuation picture, if you pull it back. Well, the fundamental theorem, the fun theorem, theorem of tropical geometry, tells you that this zero dimensional ideal over field k would have the following property. If I take the solution to my ideal. So if I take w and compute the multiplicity of tropicalization of, let's say, some zero dimensional ideal j, and it is equal to the number of Pissau series solutions to my ideal. So this is the number of piezo series roots, zeros, I should call them zeros, of j with valuation with degree equal to w. So in the same manner, we would, we would do the following.
00:18:35.932 - 00:20:38.224, Speaker A: We assume that we can, well, I mean, we can always move the picture here in such a way that w is at the origin. So if I make the transformation that fits x goes to x, t to the w or minus w, and this point of question is at zero, that means I'm considering, I mean, the pizza series zeros are going to have valuation zero. So they're going to start with a constant term, and the terms will go up. So each solution will look like each solution will be a solution to the, let's say if this operation is called wave. So if this operation sends j to j wave, then I want to set up a homotopy that computes I c the other way around, I v c of S. Let's say c t of s when this t actually goes from. So if you remember the picture from Charles's talk, then you will have this parameter s that would parameterize a homotopy for t that goes towards t equals zero.
00:20:38.224 - 00:21:52.234, Speaker A: So let's say I picked some point where my solutions are regular, where in other words, I do get some slice of my pizza series and then I want to go to zero. And if it's generic enough, then the hemotopy you have is going to avoid, is going to avoid singular points of the branch cover. Well, it's not going to avoid this point if it were singular. But that's okay. I mean, that's okay from the point of view of applied numerical algebraic geometry. Yeah, I didn't, I forgot to mention that actually in, in full trueness, we should consider ideals in the Laurent polynomial ring, because, well, taking logs of zeros is not a caucier thing. So here we do have c star to the power two or n.
00:21:52.234 - 00:22:44.864, Speaker A: And the thing is that perhaps your variety is going to have other components than this curve you are interested in at the coordinate axis. And this junk has to be somehow ignored. So here at t equals zero, you're going to get a very singular point towards. You are driving your hemotopy to, and I guess, well, at the end of that homotopy, you're of course going to discover the value of your pizza series with valuation zero, which are constant coefficients of your Pz series. And that would be exactly the multiplicity, the multiplicity of the ray. If that multiplicity is zero, you have no ray. Okay, well, there are several.
00:22:44.864 - 00:23:49.694, Speaker A: I'm going to skip, skip the part where I explain to you how to actually stop this computation, how to stop guessing. But let me point out that the toughest part of this was application of software. We actually had to apply all numerical, well, not all, but at least three packages of numerical algebraic software available. And the crucial, I mean, you may think that why do we keep programming different implementations of homotopy continuation? Isn't bertini enough? Well, there are some features that are not present in all of them. So we actually used. The crucial for this project was PHC pack. So when you have this situation where the other junk floats around, you want to compute, you want to compute the variety that you are interested in, which is a curve in the torus.
00:23:49.694 - 00:25:13.530, Speaker A: And here you have to use PhCPeg, because that's well, out of three things we used, that's the only one that has an implementation of polyhedral homotopies, otherwise we could not move on. Well, I mean, for just sampling, everything was executed inside of Macaulay two, where we have nice interfaces to all the other things like Phcpeq and Bertini. Bertini was particularly useful when we drove things into singular situations, because there, I mean, the other implementations use fixed point precision, at least for now. And with bertini, we were able to get more accurate approximations of this leading coefficients of puzzle series, giving us multiplicity. So altogether, we used all the available knowledge and software in numerical algebraic geometry to get something that would work. And please one colleague of mine, his name is Staras Gerfalidis and he is a not theorist. So our examples come from topology, from topology and dot theory, more precisely.
00:25:13.530 - 00:26:05.876, Speaker A: And this is exactly the situation where some work has been done, but a lot of it stopped because we cannot, people could not get hands on this curve because it has a lot of junk at the boundary of the torus. So at the end of the day, we are hoping to compute some invariants of knots of incompressible surfaces in the complements of knots. And, well, that's the upshot of this. Another upshot is certification of all of this. And John is saying stop. So I'm stopping, thank you. Any questions?
00:26:05.980 - 00:26:07.012, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm curious, a little bit of.
00:26:07.028 - 00:26:08.916, Speaker A: The instances when you talk about THC.
00:26:08.980 - 00:26:12.084, Speaker B: Pad, then you have completed the sections, right?
00:26:12.124 - 00:26:14.332, Speaker A: So one, what's a typical input?
00:26:14.388 - 00:26:19.344, Speaker B: What's a typical I where this works? Well, that's not a complete mistake.
00:26:19.864 - 00:26:44.956, Speaker A: Well, it turns out that actually the examples supplied by estavorous are complete intersections. But you can use this for non complete intersection, the same way you are using numerical algebraic for non complete intersections in the usual settings. Moreover, this scheme doesn't need to be reduced. You can use deflation and so on. I mean, this is all under the carpet ideal.
00:26:45.020 - 00:26:46.904, Speaker B: And you have to be sure it's a curve.
00:26:47.924 - 00:26:53.064, Speaker A: You have to be sure that in the torus there is a curve. Yes.
00:26:54.244 - 00:27:00.636, Speaker B: I mean, can you start with like a witness set for a curve, witness set representative of a curve? Or do you need something more than that?
00:27:00.820 - 00:27:17.504, Speaker A: You need a witness represent witness set for curve. I think that's enough? Yeah, that's enough. And that is actually the bottleneck here, because without PHC pack, we were not able to get this witness set.
00:27:17.664 - 00:27:29.920, Speaker B: Well, also, it looks like what you're following here when you go back to the original scheme is intersection of that curve with an exponential hypersurface or something, right? That's the inverse image of a. Or is it?
00:27:29.992 - 00:27:39.332, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. If you push it. If you push this usual hypersurface and log coordinates up, you're gonna get. Yeah, you're going to get an interior.
00:27:39.508 - 00:27:41.864, Speaker B: Or it's just like a translation of a subtorous.
00:27:43.044 - 00:28:07.244, Speaker A: Translation of a subtorous. It is a translation of the subtorus. It is algebraic. I mean, what it amounts to is computing an intersection. A slice of the original thing with the hypersurface is given to you by a binomial. Any other questions?
00:28:07.544 - 00:28:16.032, Speaker B: Is there any help of sort of interfacing this? Interfacing, like combining this with GfAM to compute larger things?
00:28:16.088 - 00:29:04.112, Speaker A: Yeah, so actually, I mean, honors got involved because he's really hitting the wall with the symbolics and. Well, I mean, does the symbolics fail in a big way on those examples? Because you cannot even produce the candidate race, the pre variety. There is not one dimensional for those examples that we're interested in. And the hope is that. Well, I mean, the hope is that there's a bottom layer of computing higher dimensional tropical varieties with this technology, because you always can sort of intersect the tropical variety and consider links that occurs, things like that. No, it's all. It's in the paper.
00:29:04.112 - 00:29:19.444, Speaker A: There is a big future developments, two page section of all the future that could happen, where we made way with bigger examples of nots. That's why I say there is one happy person.
00:29:21.904 - 00:29:23.624, Speaker B: Any questions? All right, thank you.
