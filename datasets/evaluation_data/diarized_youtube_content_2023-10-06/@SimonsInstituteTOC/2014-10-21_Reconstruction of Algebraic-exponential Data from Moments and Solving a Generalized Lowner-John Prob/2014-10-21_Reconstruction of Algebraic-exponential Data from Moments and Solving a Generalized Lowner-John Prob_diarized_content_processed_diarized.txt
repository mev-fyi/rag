00:00:01.040 - 00:00:50.394, Speaker A: Thank you very much. So I want to thank of course, the organizer for this very nice invitation, like very much brokel. It's my favorite place in the US. Well, so before I start to talk about what is indicated in the title, I will just make a gentle introduction of what the kind of things I'm interested in sometimes. So for example, take the euclidean ball sigma of Xi square less than one. And if you look at Hilbert, I think he has listed eleven geometric properties of the euclidean ball. Like for example, for a given surface area, it is a convex body that has the smallest volume, these kind of things, right? So there are eleven properties like that.
00:00:50.394 - 00:01:39.414, Speaker A: I'm not a geometer at all. But when you look at this definition of a unit ball, even a freshman at university, that has a very something is very special, right? I mean, do you see that? If you take for example, any other quadratic form that define a level set of this form, you see this one, you cannot make it simpler as n coefficients all equal. If you take one coefficient less, the volume is not finite. And this is really surprising. So I will explain why sometimes this happens. In fact, with the tools. For example here, if you take another quadratic form with finite volume, you could have potentially o coefficients, right? Here you only have one n and you cannot do less.
00:01:39.414 - 00:02:19.668, Speaker A: So in fact, this one for constant volume, minimize, for example, the so called pseudonym of l zero, the number of nonzero coefficients, right? But with the tools that I will present, we can also prove that it minimizes the l one norm. And this is a unique optimal solution. So I think it's an intuition, when sometimes in thematics, intuition is not a good friend. But I think that when you have a strong property of a convex body, a strong geometric property, maybe there is some hidden convexity behind that, you can also retrieve this property looking at the representation of this convex body, I mean, not for all convex bodies, but for this kind of bodies, for example.
00:02:19.796 - 00:02:31.172, Speaker B: So John, the optimization problem is something is a quadratic form inequality, which defines a bounded set smallest equation. For that, in that sense, that's okay. That's what you mean.
00:02:31.228 - 00:03:09.278, Speaker A: So for example, here, if you look at all the quadratic forms that give this set the same volume as this one fixed volume, this one minimizes the l one norm of coefficients, and it's unique optimal solution. And the tools we use are just an example of the kind of things I'm looking at. And then we explain why this convexity appears. The motivation, this is one, but it's not the only one. I will talk about some motivation. And I will present an important property of so called positively homogeneous functions, some properties about convexity, polarity. And then mainly we are interested in sublevel sets.
00:03:09.278 - 00:03:50.074, Speaker A: We will see also that the self level set of minimum volume has contained a fixed given set k of rn. And then we come to the title of the talk about the exact reconstruction from moments and for the case of homogeneous polynomials, and also for the marginal case of non homogeneous polynomial motivation. At the beginning was a reconstruction of a shape. Well, the only know. So you have a shape k of rn in a set of rn compact, for example, not necessarily, but assume. And then the only knowledge you have on this set k is the moment of the rebel measure. So you don't know k, you know only the moments of the rebec measure.
00:03:50.074 - 00:03:55.354, Speaker A: And the idea is just by this knowledge could you retrieve the set k?
00:03:56.734 - 00:03:57.474, Speaker B: Right.
00:03:58.894 - 00:04:06.166, Speaker A: And even if you want exact recovery, it's even harder. And it's the same question. And now you want to recover exactly k. But for example, the boundary of.
00:04:06.190 - 00:04:06.754, Speaker B: K.
00:04:09.254 - 00:05:08.444, Speaker A: Example of exact recovery. One of the famous one is in R two by the what are called quality of domains work by Gustavsson Boutinar, and in your collateral domain is a domain for which there is a co director formula for analytic functions, harmonic function, let's say. So it's a very special case then for convex polytope. If you use the nice formula by Kovanski Laurence Proklikov, then you can retrieve, given the moments of the measure on the polytope, you can retrieve the vertices by inverting this formula. And when you invert this formula, you do a sort of pony type method and an extension. Non convex polarizer was done by Dimas Pasenik recently, and you also can have approximate recovery in multi dimensions. It was nice work by these people.
00:05:08.444 - 00:05:51.544, Speaker A: I'm not pretending to be exhaustive about the literature. Okay, so the talk is about exact recovery when the set kick is a third level set of homogeneous polynomial. So G is a negative homogeneous polynomial such that this k has finite volume. And you suppose you don't know g, but you know the moment of the rebel measure. So you know those numbers. And from those numbers you would have to retrieve the polynomial g. And this, the way we do it, also works not only for marginal polynomial, but also for quasi homogenous polynomial, which is a slight generalization of homogeneity, sorry, of homogeneous homogeneity.
00:05:51.544 - 00:06:20.624, Speaker A: Now you say that the g is quasi homogeneous. If you find some rational number u one u n such that g of lambda u one x one u n x n is equal to lambda g. Okay, so it's a slight generalization. And all I say for this will work for this cause, the homogeneous polynomial. Another way of looking at the quasi homogeneous polynomial, it's like if you look at the Newton polytope of such a polynomial, it is degenerate, so it has only, it's an hyperplanear two. For example.
00:06:22.764 - 00:06:28.900, Speaker B: Is d the degree of g, or is just some number? Sorry. Is d the degree of g or just some number?
00:06:28.972 - 00:06:40.362, Speaker A: No, no. Here, what is a d? Here it comes from the, from the u one. Yeah. For u one, u two, u n, you find a degree like this.
00:06:40.548 - 00:06:42.638, Speaker B: I mean, are you given the moments that you're given?
00:06:42.726 - 00:07:10.134, Speaker A: Ah, okay. We see that we need, normally I shouldn't put a d here, or you have a certain number of moments. Yeah, sorry about that. And we see that we need only finitely many of them. Sorry, it's a mistake. And the second part of the talk would be exact recovery also. But now we look for a set that is a set g, which is an open set, which is the interior of its closure, to avoid bad points.
00:07:10.134 - 00:07:54.784, Speaker A: And we assume that there's a real algebraic boundary. And we assume we also know the degree. And again, in this case, we want to find, from the knowledge of moments of the rebellion measure, we want to find the polynomial that vanishes in the boundary. It will be a second part. And before we go to this, I do a little detour about positively homogenous functions, which is a wide class of functions, encounter many applications, and as a consequence of homogeneity, they enjoy very particular properties. And among them, of course, the other identity. There is another apparently not so well known property of positively homogeneous functions, which sometimes surprising and unexpected results, some of them already known in particular cases.
00:07:54.784 - 00:08:26.042, Speaker A: And when you, homogeneous polynomial, are a particular case of positive homogeneous function. So in the case of homogeneous polynomial, we can say even more. We will see. And so we are interested so far with this kind of thing. So we have an integral, which is what the domain is the sublevel set of some positively homogenous polynomial of our positively homogeneous function, let's say not necessarily a polynomial. So far, h is also a positively homogeneous function. And we want to look at this integral from two ways.
00:08:26.042 - 00:08:49.490, Speaker A: The first way is you fix g and h, and you look this as a function of the right hand side. You want to analyze this function with g and h. Fix. Now you can also look at this integral in a different manner. Now you fix h, and then you look this as a function of y of G. Sorry. Now, of the coefficient when g will be a polynomial, this will be a function of the coefficient of G.
00:08:49.490 - 00:09:27.296, Speaker A: And you would like to see how this integral behaves when you move g. For example, the volume, when you take h equal one, this will be the volume of this set. And you want to look at the way the volume changes when you change some coefficients of the polynomial g. Okay. All right. Some motivation. In fact, there was a nice paper by two russian physicists where they were relating this integral with another one, which is not on a domain, but on rn, and it's called discriminant integral.
00:09:27.296 - 00:10:05.340, Speaker A: So they were looking at, they were showing, as a byproduct of what they wanted to show. They could show that this integral here is related to this one in a very simple manner when you have h and g as homogeneous polynomials. And they were motivated by that because our physicists. And this kind of integral appears very frequently in quantum physics. Don't ask me why, because I don't know any reason why they look at those integrals. That's what they say in their paper. And of course, the challenging issue is to provide an exact formula for this integral.
00:10:05.340 - 00:10:38.966, Speaker A: For example, when h is equal to one, we would like to give an exact formula for this integral of this homogeneous polynomial g. And we all know that when degree of g is equal to two, then you have a quadratic form, positive. Right. Then we know that this integral is, of course, related to up to a constant that does not depend on g, to the determinant of g. Right. So they want to, these two russian people were interested in finding analog of this kind of results. When the degree is not two, but four, three depends on the.
00:10:38.966 - 00:11:07.514, Speaker A: And the integral could be on some line, integral could be not only necessarily on rna. So that was the basic paper. They were looking at this kind of property. And of course, it's a very difficult problem, and you don't know. So they call this kind of integral discriminant. The tool are okay to analyze this kind of integral. The key tools that they present in the paper are discriminant and the SLN group.
00:11:07.514 - 00:11:54.558, Speaker A: And they call this kind of integral a discriminant integral, because for the few cases where you can have an exact expression, the discriminant plays a fundamental role. And the kind of tool they use, they use, they show that this integral satisfies, or this functional satisfies, this kind of partial differential equation. Very easy to show, actually. It's not very complicated. And using, it's called wild identities and using these identities in some particular cases, they are able to provide an exact explicit expression for this functional. But of course, they've succeeded in very, very few cases. So the two guys are Morosov and Shakirov and Cinder.
00:11:54.558 - 00:11:56.074, Speaker A: Now he's published in a physics journal.
00:11:56.454 - 00:11:57.934, Speaker C: Shakirov is here.
00:11:58.094 - 00:11:58.486, Speaker A: Really?
00:11:58.550 - 00:12:05.174, Speaker C: He's actually a graduate student in the math department. Finished a physics PhD in Russia. And he is now a student in Russia.
00:12:05.214 - 00:12:44.684, Speaker A: That was funny. Okay. And so they seem to know a lot about algebraic geometry. Seems to be a good guy. You know him? Yes. So in particular, as a byproduct of what they mentioned in their paper, when they want to compute exactly this functional as a byproduct, they show that you have this link between the volume of this level set and this integral. So you see, they are equal up to a constant that does not depend on g, just on the degree of g.
00:12:44.684 - 00:13:29.998, Speaker A: In other words, the volume is the same as this exponential up to a constant which does not depend on the coefficient of g. But they just present this as a byproduct. They don't really use it. In fact, if you think carefully and you are in convex analysis, there was a formula and geometry also that of exactly the same flavor was already known for a long time ago and actually was the initial motivation of our work. And it goes as follows. If C is a set, convex set of rn and you define the support function the usual way, right? This is a positively homogeneous function of degree one. And then the polar of C is defined like this.
00:13:29.998 - 00:14:11.414, Speaker A: So this support function of C is a tool to define by a positive neuromorph function, the set the polar of C. And it is well known that the volume of the polar is just one coefficient. Here there's no dependency the exponential of minus sigma c of x, which is also a positive homogeneous function of degree one. And this was known for a long time. So I suspect, in fact, that this formula was known appears somewhere. I'm not sure that Shakiroff and more software, they give a proof of that, but I suspect it was known already. But so what is this important property of positive geomorphous function that they use in their paper? We will see two proof of that.
00:14:11.414 - 00:15:04.064, Speaker A: But they were using this proof and I think it's very nice to know. So you take two measurable mappings from r plus to r, almost anything, just measurable mappings, and let g to be a positively homogeneous function, non negative positive homogeneous function, and h to be a positive homogeneous function of degree d and p. You can show that if you take this integral, I haven't said what is what phi one and phi two are so far. But when this integral is finite and you take the ratio of those two integral, you see the ratio does not depend on g and h, just depends on the degree of homogeneity of g and h. And of course, of the function phi one and phi two. But if you move, if you stay in the class of opposite homogeneous function g and h of degree d and p, you still have the same ratio. So it does not depend really on the function itself.
00:15:04.064 - 00:15:51.054, Speaker A: Okay, so for example, what choice are interesting for us? If you take phi one of t equals the indicator of zero one, then you get this. This integral becomes this one. And if you take, for example, phi two is exponential minus t, you get this integral, right. So that's why we can, from this, you will see that since we have this formula, you can relate directly this volume. Take h one, for example. This will give you the volume of the level set, and you will show that the ratio of the volume against the integral over rn of the exponential is a constant that does not depend on g and h. And the proof is very, very simple.
00:15:51.054 - 00:16:40.194, Speaker A: So the theorem says the following. So phi is measurable mapping. G is a positively homogeneous function negative, and h is a positive homogeneous function of degree Dnp. So that you assume that this integral is finite. So this, now this integral with phi of g of x, h of x is equal to a constant, this integral, and again, the constant that depends only on phi, d and p. In particular, you get the level set equal to this. So the proof is just for a freshman at university doing calculus for simplicity, you assume that gx is strictly positive except at zero.
00:16:40.194 - 00:17:26.184, Speaker A: And then you look at this integral, you make this simple change of variables, okay? And then here, so the integral becomes this one. And now you just use homogeneity to put the td outside of g. That's the only place where you use homogeneity. Then you have a Toneli Fovini argument to interchange the integrals. And then you have this, just very basic calculus. And then you prove that finally this integral is equal to something of this form, which is a famous constant that we have seen in the theorem, does not depend on g and h, just on the degree, on the function phi, p and d. A term that depends on d and h, which is this one.
00:17:26.184 - 00:18:12.262, Speaker A: So if you change your phi, you will find the same thing, j of h, but this constant will change. For example, for example, if you choose phi equal exponential of minus t, you find this. So this is expression when phi equals exponential of minus t. If you choose phi of t equals the indicator function as before. So now you get the volume, and you get that the constant now is one over n plus p terms he of h the same he. So when you make the ratio, this disappear, and then you link the integral, the volume with the integral, okay? That's why you find that this integral is equal to this one times coefficient that does not depend on g and h. Very simple.
00:18:12.262 - 00:18:56.010, Speaker A: Just mean. A freshman at university can prove this after a plus of calculus. An alternative flow is via the Laplace transform, which is even faster, I think, in this case. So, if you look at the integral we had mentioned before, since z is positive, non negative positive measurement function, when y is negative, this is zero. So you can take the Laplace transform, which is integral of zero to infinity, of this times this function. If you develop the definition of this, you find this, right? So you make a four begin interchange, okay? That you are allowed to do it in this case. And then you find it's equal to this.
00:18:56.010 - 00:19:40.404, Speaker A: This is elementary. And now you use homogeneity of g to put the lambda inside, make a change of variable, and you find this term now, and this, the lambda does not appear here anymore, okay? So you can write it like this, and you find that this quantity here, gamma over lambda, one plus n plus p over d, is a Laplace transform of this of y to the power n plus p over d. That's why you get it one page proof, which is elementary. And so you find that this integral is equal to. Yeah, okay. Just very simple. Also proof.
00:19:40.404 - 00:20:49.984, Speaker A: So, for example, now, if you, if you said, if we like to compute this integral, like the physicists would like to compute, the same as computing the volume of this level set, in fact, and we know how to, we don't know how to compute it exactly, but we know how to approximate it. So I won't spend too much time on it. Let's say that we have an approximation, a numerical scheme that approximates, as closely as desired, the volume of this set. Hence, you can approximate this integral as closely as desired. I don't go into details now we go to another identity again, using this magic formula, using this function phi, you can play with the function phi to get different formula. So, for example, you can show that this integral exponential of minus g over g of less than y divided by this, the mass of this measure. Okay? So if you look at the measure of this set, to take the measure mu, equal exponential of minus g dx so this ratio is just the measure of this set over the mass of mu.
00:20:49.984 - 00:21:37.494, Speaker A: You can prove that this is equal to this. So the way, so, in fact, when y goes to infinity, this is going to, this ratio is going to one, of course. So the measure of this set, the rate at which it goes to the mass of this measure, is exactly the rate at which the gamma function, this exponential, truncated at y, goes to the gamma function. It's like we have a one dimensional integral. In fact, again, just use this formula with phi. You play with the phi, and then you can have a lot of formulas like that. And now we go to this convexity business that I think is perhaps the most interesting result in this framework.
00:21:37.494 - 00:22:16.014, Speaker A: Now, an interesting issue for me is to analyze how the bag volume changes with g. So now g is a polynomial, and you have to see how the volume of this level set, how it behaves as a function of the coefficient of g. Okay? So in fact, you look even at a more complicated integral. So you can put an h, which is a positively emergence function. Here we have h equal one for this, but we will have this integral, okay? And this is positive, the homogeneous function of n plus p over d.
00:22:17.714 - 00:22:18.090, Speaker B: It's.
00:22:18.122 - 00:22:52.424, Speaker A: Convex whenever h is non negative and strictly convex. If h is positive on except at zero. And we know how to relate the volume to this one. So you can have also the, this h. If h is continuous and this is finite, then of course you have also the gradient and the asian, which are just moment of this integral. Okay? It's very easy to, in fact, to get the gradient, you can show that you can differentiate under the integral sign. So it's trivial.
00:22:52.424 - 00:23:36.448, Speaker A: Not trivial, but not very difficult. So you get the Hessian and the gradient as a function of g, right? And again, to prove this, you just use that the volume is equal to this. So this function is convex. The volume is convex. So the volume of this set as a function of g, the coefficient of g, when you look at this integral, which is the volume, it's a convex function of the coefficient of g, which is a bit surprising, because if you try to prove that it is convex, directly from the definition, I don't know how to do it. Now, if you do this formula, it's almost trivial. If you use this formula, it's easy to show that this function as a function of g is convex.
00:23:36.448 - 00:23:39.884, Speaker A: It's truly convex. But here will be more difficult to prove.
00:23:43.104 - 00:23:43.964, Speaker B: Okay.
00:23:46.184 - 00:24:25.254, Speaker A: Polarity. So this is already in the book by Kaffir. So if you have a set c, which is convex, a subset of rn. And you define a super function like we did before, and the polar is defined like this, of course. And you can also define for convex or positive function g of degree d, not necessarily convex. You can define also its Logan differential conjugate, which is a PhD, which is a positive measure function of degree q with one of d one q plus one over q, equal one. And you have a completely symmetric situation for the polar, for the volume of the polar and the volume of c.
00:24:25.254 - 00:25:06.774, Speaker A: If you look at this sublevel set, so g is a close proper convex positive emergence function of degree one, sorry. Of degree d greater than one. Sorry. And then if you look at this level set, then the polar is defined like this, when one over q, now by one over d plus one over q equal one, then the volume of g, you have a very nice symmetric formula. The volume of the set g is given by this integral, and the volume of the polar is also given by this. With the EUC appearing the conjugate. I don't go to example, not too interesting.
00:25:06.774 - 00:25:56.894, Speaker A: And there is a variational property of homogenous polynomial also that I like. And the idea is to compare what is done for the gaussian measure, which corresponds to a quadratic form. And when the form is not quadratic anymore, could you retrieve some properties that you have for the gaussian measure? So remember that for the gaussian measure, you have your polynomial, the quadratic form, sorry. We are going to look at homogeneous polynomial of degree two d to charge sum of squares. So it can be written like this. So this is a vector of all monomials of degree d, and sigma is a positive summation matrix. So this defines an homogenous polynomial of degree two d, and you can identify g with this gram matrix.
00:25:56.894 - 00:26:45.874, Speaker A: Right? So remember that in the case where d equal one, we are in the gaussian case. We all know that the exponential of minor geo fix is equal to this. So you see appearing again this determinant, this is true for the case d equal to or d one. If you take two d, and not only that, but if you look at the second order moment of this measure, the gaussian measure normalized, you find that it is exactly equal to the inverse of the sigma that defines the set g. So you have the sigma that appear here, right? And then if we take the moment, you get just the inverse. It's a very famous property of the gaussian measure. And the idea is, do you have this equivalent formula for the case of homogeneous form, but not of degree two degree four, six, for example.
00:26:45.874 - 00:27:47.304, Speaker A: So for the gaussian measure, another way of saying if you take this gaussian measure, then the moment matrix, the second order moment, is just inverse. Right? And then you can show that it's very easy to prove that, of course, you have that this function of sigma, which is the determinant square root of the determinant times the integral, is a constant function. For the case of degree two, homogeneous function, this is just a property of the gaussian measure. So the idea for going to the homogeneous case of degree greater than two is to use this. And what would be the basic analog would be, you are going to take, remember, we take a sum of square of now of degree 2d with the sigma. So we're going to take the determinant to some power to make this function now where we have d here. Now, instead of one, to make this function homogeneous of degree zero, which is the analog of the constant function homogeneous of degree zero.
00:27:47.304 - 00:28:17.748, Speaker A: Okay, so you define, okay, there's just not some notation of the dimension. So now we define this priority measure mu, which is equal to this. Now we have degree d greater than one, which is the analog of the gaussian measure, but for degree d greater than one. Okay, so you normalize by the mass, and this is the measure of the set b. Okay, and then you define the moment of order of 2d exactly like in the gaussian case.
00:28:17.796 - 00:28:18.384, Speaker B: Right?
00:28:20.084 - 00:29:05.084, Speaker A: Now you look at this function. You build up a function which is equal to the determinant of sigma to some power k times the mass of the measure, and you choose k to make this function homogeneous of degree zero, value of k. Very easy to show. And then the result is the following, that if you look at this, if you want this moment matrix to have the property that it is equal to the inverse, like in the gaussian case, it's the same as saying that the sigma is, is a critical point of this function, exactly like in the gaussian case. In the gaussian case, this function is constant. So of course, the gradient is zero. And you get this property for all gaussian measures.
00:29:05.084 - 00:29:32.020, Speaker A: Here, it's not true anymore. But when the, for the critical point of this function, then you get that exactly the same property as in the gaussian case, the moments of order two of the 2d. Sorry, it's just, again, the inverse, like in the gaussian case. But I don't know how to interpret this function. I don't know. I just see it's the analog of the gaussian case. But anyway, so it's a variational property of homogeneous polynomial of degree 2d.
00:29:32.020 - 00:30:34.504, Speaker A: In this case, I don't go to the proof, not necessarily. Now I go to the motivation of the, which is in the title of the talk about sublevel set g of minimum volume, which is the generalization of the loner Jones ellipsoid problem. Suppose we are given k, a subset of rn, which is compact, and the loner Jones ellipsoid problem. Try to find the ellipsoid of minimum volume that contains kick. Try to find the ellipsoid side that contains k, and among all ellipsoid that contains k, you would like to find the ellipsoid of minimum volume. And of course in this case, since you are an ellipsoid, is always convex. You of course, taking care of the convex side of k is the same thing.
00:30:34.504 - 00:30:57.226, Speaker A: So that's why in the literature, the London ellipsoid problem is given for convex set k. Because when you enclose a set k with ellipsoid, the solution for the minimum volume will also be the solution for the problem with a convexor of k. Of course, ellipsoid, you mean a quadratic.
00:30:57.290 - 00:30:57.894, Speaker B: Yes.
00:30:58.754 - 00:32:04.994, Speaker A: So that's why it doesn't make sense to consider k which is not convex, because you replace it by the convexor of k and you get the same solution. Now the generalization will be the following. Now we have the same set k. Now this time not necessarily convex. And you ask the question, you look now all homogeneous polynomial of degree d, in fact 2d, such that this level set contains k, and among all those level set that contain k of this form defined by polynomial homogeneous polynomial degree 2d, you want to find the one of minimum volume, okay? And then I claim that this is exactly the analog of Lon angel ellipsoid problem in the sense that it will be a convex optimization problem. With a unique optimal solution, you find px of convex coin of homogeneous polynomial of degree 2d or sublevel set as finite level volume. And with k subset rn, you define c convex cone of polynomials non negative on k.
00:32:04.994 - 00:33:01.430, Speaker A: It's a convex cone, finite dimensional convex cone. And so suppose k is a set in rn compact, and the minimum volume of a sublevel set g of this form, where g is a homogeneous polynomial of degree to d that contains k, is this quantity where rho solves this optimization problem. So you want to minimize, remember that the volume of this set is this kind of integral up to a constant. So you want to minimize this and you should contain k so one minus g of x should be positive on k. When you look at this problem in terms of the coefficient g of homogeneous polynomial of degree 2d, this is a convex optimization problem because this is a strictly convex function. This is a convex cone. So you just see that this vector belongs to this convex cone.
00:33:01.430 - 00:33:06.634, Speaker A: So it's a finite dimensional convex optimization problem. And in fact, it has a unique optimal solution.
00:33:11.294 - 00:33:11.982, Speaker B: Yes.
00:33:12.118 - 00:33:14.598, Speaker C: So k contains the origin, for example.
00:33:14.726 - 00:33:20.936, Speaker A: Not necessarily, but it will be the best would be when you contain the origin, but not necessarily, but also the.
00:33:20.960 - 00:33:25.336, Speaker C: John, so the logner of soil, I mean, you need to center it.
00:33:25.400 - 00:33:28.408, Speaker A: Yeah. This is exactly analog for the symmetric case.
00:33:28.496 - 00:33:29.484, Speaker C: I see, I see.
00:33:33.424 - 00:34:40.464, Speaker A: And why is it a convex optimization problem? Because we have seen that the volume is just equal to this integral up to this constant term. Right? And then you have this function, strictly convex, and CD is a convex cone, you can show it has a unique optimal solution. And in fact, you also get the same characterization as in the long Arjun ellipsoid problem, that you find the optimal solution is the homogeneous polynomial of degree two d of this form, and has some contact points on the boundary of K. And there is a measure which is supported on those contact points that satisfy this. This is exactly the why I don't go into detail, but this is exactly the analog of the lonodrone ellipsoid characterization. Also the contact points of the ellipsoid with the convex body k. For example, just to figure out why in this case, even when k is convex, you find that the optimal solution is not a convex set.
00:34:40.464 - 00:35:34.146, Speaker A: For example, take the box minus one, one squared and dimension two, and you look for homogeneous polynomial of degree four, so that the level set contains k, this box, and has minimum volume among all set like this, defined by polynomial of degree four, you find that the optimal solution, using this optimality condition, you can find the optimal solution is this polynomial. Okay, I give you this. So this is a box, and this is optimal solution of this problem is not. So k is convex, but the solution of this problem is not a convex set, this generalized ellipsoid. Right? And this is contact points here, here, here and here. Now if you look for the same problem with degree six. Now, same reasoning, and you can find the optimal solution is.
00:35:34.146 - 00:35:39.530, Speaker A: Now this one is y one equal to x two.
00:35:39.642 - 00:35:40.374, Speaker B: Yes.
00:35:41.194 - 00:36:07.546, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, yeah, sorry. We'll give you a solution for degree six. And degree six is almost like degree four, except it's a bit flattened, but exactly the same shape. In this case. In this case, contrary to the laundage on episode problem. Even when k is convex, the solution does not define necessarily a convex set. So now I go out to the real problem defined in the title of the talk.
00:36:07.546 - 00:37:03.344, Speaker A: How do you recover the set k? I mean the set g, sorry. From the moment of the Lubeck measure, okay, you can prove that if j is non negative and dehomogenous, homogenous of degree d, and with j compact. Okay, then you can find you don't need, in fact, g compact. You need that the level set has finite volume. You can show that this integral, so you fix alpha, and you look at this integral is equal to this just by using this magic formula with phi. Okay, what does this say? You fix alpha and you look at this integral, but this integral is just a linear combination of the moment of the on g, because this is a polynomial, right? So, you can write this like this. So, g beta is the coefficient of g, and y alpha plus beta is integral of x alpha plus beta dx over g.
00:37:03.344 - 00:37:51.512, Speaker A: So, this side gives you a linear combination of the moment of the rebellion measure. You know those numbers that are given to you, right? And the right hand side is also here is just a moment y alpha. So, for each fixed alpha, you show that the moment y alpha is a linear combination of all the moments of either order. So, the moment y alpha satisfied in our relationship, which are explicit in terms of the coefficient of the polynomial g. Okay, so you, now, since you can play with alpha, you can do that for each particular alpha, you will have some relationship. So, you do that for several alphas, and you define a certain moment matrix defined like this. So y is known, again, y are the moments of the rubic measure.
00:37:51.512 - 00:38:24.444, Speaker A: And remember that this is given to you. You don't know the body g, but you know the moments y, so those numbers are known. So you build up this matrix md of Y alpha plus beta, which is given by this. So the rows and column are indexed by the monomials. And this linear relationship can be written in this compact form md of y times the vector of coefficient of g equal yd. And this matrix is invertible. So the g is just equal to this.
00:38:24.444 - 00:39:17.150, Speaker A: So, if you know the moment of the Lebenc measure, you just filled up this matrix, and you solve this linear system, which is a unique optimal solution because it's invertible. So you recover g exactly from the knowledge of the moment. So you need moments of all order 2d, because in this matrix here, you have moments of order d plus d 2d. So if you know the 2d moments of the rebec measure, you can recover the boundary just by solving a linear system. Okay, so in other words, you can recover g. Exactly, just from the knowledge of moments of the rubic measure of order d and 2d. What about when you go to non homogenous polynomials? Because then we cannot use any more this magic formula with the phi.
00:39:17.342 - 00:39:18.194, Speaker B: Okay.
00:39:19.814 - 00:39:40.734, Speaker A: And you cannot do what we did before. Okay. But still, we have that, the Laplace transform. So I'm going to make a little. We have the plus transform of the function y f of y. Even you can put an absolute value here, for example, is equal to this non gaussian integral. This is still true, has nothing to do with homogeneity.
00:39:40.734 - 00:40:28.858, Speaker A: When you have homogeneity, you can put the lambda inside, make a change of variable. Then you would have a constant times some rational function of lambda when it is not homogeneous. Then you stop here. Then, before I go to the recovery, I take this opportunity to mention this result that I think I was surprised. I just knew about this result recently, and I don't know if people know this result in the audience, but it's a very strong result. I think it's due to this russian researcher, Vasilyev, and he said the following. If you look at this function as a function of the right hand side, okay, so suppose you have a set defined by absolute value of gess and y, you have one polynomial, but you could have several of them.
00:40:28.858 - 00:41:13.324, Speaker A: Just take one polynomial and you like to see how the asymptotic behavior of this integral when y goes to infinity or when y goes to zero. The motivation of these people, like Vasilyev, was integral of this form when y goes to zero. They use this in PDe's for analyzing some hard problem. In PDe's, they need to know the rate of convergence up to zero of this volume when y goes to zero. But there is also an analysis when you want to see how this volume behaves when y goes to infinity. So basically, if could prove that this function when y goes to infinity, for example, has exactly this form. So it's a power a of y, a power b of the logarithm of y.
00:41:13.324 - 00:41:40.384, Speaker A: And what is interesting is that the a and b, you just read the a and b from the Newton polytope. I find that very surprising. So you draw, if you have a single polynomial, but you could still have several polynomials. So you draw the convexor of the Newton polytope from this convex polytope. For this Newton polytope, you read a and b, and that gives you the behavior at infinity some hypothesis, though. Yeah, of course you need the volume. Yeah.
00:41:40.384 - 00:42:17.706, Speaker A: But this, there is some denseness result. So the case where you can, you don't have this formula are supposedly negligible, let's say. And they also have the same kind of formula when y goes to zero also. And again, you have different exponent, but your formula of this form, also when y goes to zero, you have f of y goes to zero at the center rate. But even more, not only you look at the volume. Yeah. The volume of this set.
00:42:17.706 - 00:43:02.710, Speaker A: But you can also look at the number of integral points in this set. So you look at this set, intersect with the integral points, right? Because you look at the number of integral points and you want to see how this number grows when y goes to infinity. And again, you have a formula of this form. This function behaves like y to the power a prime and b prime. Okay? And again, a prime and a b prime are now obtained from a slightly modified version of the Newton polytope. That was some results when the, the gene is not homogeneous, asymptotic results. Now we go back to the problem of exact recovery.
00:43:02.710 - 00:43:48.684, Speaker A: So now we have a non homogeneous polynomial. Okay, we know the moments of the measure of this set. Can you recover g? Then again, now we are not using homogeneity, but we can prove that again, we're going to have some relationship between moments of the measure. Now, the way to get it is by using Stokes formula. And we get formula like this. If you fix alpha and you look at this integral here, then you find that this integral is in a combination of the moments of g of j and g, k is just the homogeneous part. Decompose G into linear quadratic, cubic and so on.
00:43:48.684 - 00:44:19.706, Speaker A: You get this nice relationship or fixed alpha. This gives you a relationship between the moment of the Lebens measure, because here we have only polynomials. So this is a combination of the moments. And again here also the combination of the moments. So how to get this without homogeneity? Okay, it means for fixed arbitrary alpha, you get linear equality between moments of the. And you use torques formula of this form. You take a vector field, you can choose your vector field like x equals x.
00:44:19.706 - 00:44:51.024, Speaker A: Then you choose your function f equals x, alpha one minus g. So Stokes formula says that you have this formula right. And since you take f equal one minus g and g vanishes on the boundary, this will be zero. So this will be zero because you have chosen your f, so that one minus g of x, define the boundary. So it's going to be zero. So you will have this plus this equals zero. Okay? So you just play like this, and this gives you this formula.
00:44:51.024 - 00:45:26.164, Speaker A: This formula is just going by. You apply Stokes formula with a particular choice of your vector field and your function f. There are some little technicalities that we don't need here. So how do we cover the boundary? So now you said that you have a set g on rn, which is open, which is the interior of its closure. And you suppose that g has a real algebraic boundary. And you know, you assume that the degree, the polynomial of degree d that vanishes on d. So you know the degree of the boundary.
00:45:26.164 - 00:46:21.954, Speaker A: So you, again, like in homogeneous case, now you are going to define slightly modified version of the moment matrix. So it's a matrix whose entries are weighted coefficient of the moments of the rubic measure. So it's a matrix with row and colon indexed by the monomials of degree d. And you can take as many rows as you want, so the colon are fixed, and then you take as many rows as you want. So you fill up your matrix like this, and the stokes formula that we have here, right, translate in compact form in this, in our system, if fixed, 2d. Now you look at this matrix. So it's a rectangular matrix filled up with moments of the rubic measure.
00:46:21.954 - 00:46:35.294, Speaker A: So Stokes formula translates into this linear system.
00:46:37.674 - 00:46:38.534, Speaker B: Okay?
00:46:38.834 - 00:47:13.870, Speaker A: And can show that it admits a unique solution degree, this lunar system, unique. The kernel of this matrix is one dimensional, and there is a solution of this form. It's unique. So in other words, when you solve this in a, so this matrix is given to you. So just look at the kernel, which is dimension one, and then you can take a solution, and then you get your boundary. I said this is coming from the stocks identity. So I don't know if I.
00:47:13.870 - 00:47:32.270, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm not, I don't skip the proof. In the case where the set g is convex, you can do a little bit more, you need less moments. Now, instead of having 2d here, you would have a square matrix.
00:47:32.302 - 00:47:32.874, Speaker B: Now.
00:47:35.054 - 00:48:20.800, Speaker A: Needless moment, using the fact that the boundary, the set is convex. And again, you solve this system and you find the boundary. Okay? So just to give you an example of the annulus, so g is a set defined like this. For example, define this annulus. So we did we compute the moment of this measure on this annulus. You solve this in our system here, and you find that this is the unique optimal solution, the unique solution, the linear system, and you find this, this polynomial defines this annulus. Now, which is a bit funny that we can also assume that the boundary is not algebraic.
00:48:20.800 - 00:49:22.424, Speaker A: Now, so if I look at this g, which is like this, now that you see that this line is defined by a, is not defined by a polynomial. Okay, so you will compute the moments of the aerobic measure, very easy in this case, right? And we say, okay, we cannot apply the formula that we had before because this function is not a polynomial. But the idea would be, ideally, we would like to solve this. So now the idea is, okay, I have the moment of the measure on this set which doesn't have an algebraic boundary. I'm going to look at the eigenvector of the smallest eigenvalue, which is kind of approximating this in our system. Okay, so we have the y is the measure on the set which doesn't have an algebraic boundary, and we look at the eigenvector corresponding to the smallest eigenvalue, or also the smallest singular value for this case. So if we take a degree three, that's what we obtain.
00:49:22.424 - 00:50:28.704, Speaker A: And if you take degree four, you recover, you cannot see the difference, which is a bit surprising. So when you look, when you solve this system, of course, the dimension two, and maybe the exponential can be approximated quite well with a polynomial. But just looking at the eigenvector of the smallest eigenvector of this matrix, you find, you recover almost the set that you were given before, even if the boundary was not algebraic. And there is a consequence in probability, which is a bit surprising anyway, that now you consider the probability measure, definitely. So you have a polynomial g of degree d, and you look at the level set g of less than one. Okay, and you look at the lubing measure support on this set, then the conclusion of what we have seen before is that all moments of this measure support on this set are determined from those up to 3d. In other words, if you know the moments of the Rebeck measure up to 3d, then all of the moments are function of those.
00:50:28.704 - 00:51:12.224, Speaker A: All of the moments are function of these 3d moments, which is exactly what in statistics people call property for the so called exponential families. But this measure, this family of measure, do not form an exponential family. So it's really a bit surprising. So for this measure on a set like this, then it's enough to know only finitely many moments. All the moments are function of those moments, complicated function, but function of those moments. And it also holds. Now, if you take the measure, but you weigh the measure, so you take a density, which is exponential of a polynomial, you get the same result, only finitely many moments, determine all of the moments.
00:51:12.224 - 00:51:57.844, Speaker A: In conclusion, as I said this compact sublevel set g of homogeneous polynomial exhibits some surprising properties. And the one we like the most is the complexity of the volume as a function of the coefficients. We can relate positive homogeneous function with this non gaussian integral. In some case, you have a variational property. It looks very much like the gaussian property. And you can recover the boundary of level set of this form from finitely many moments of the Rebeck measure. And for sets which are not defined with non homogeneous polynomial, but with algebraic boundary, you can also do the same.
00:51:57.844 - 00:52:12.404, Speaker A: I don't go to, ever since some references are here for people who are interested, and part of this work was done with Mihaly Putina. I forgot to mention that. Thank you very much.
00:52:17.704 - 00:52:18.684, Speaker C: Questions?
00:52:19.584 - 00:52:20.324, Speaker A: Yes.
00:52:21.224 - 00:52:25.640, Speaker C: So, could you go three slides back, get this result up to degree 3d?
00:52:25.792 - 00:52:26.192, Speaker A: Yes.
00:52:26.248 - 00:52:43.284, Speaker C: So suppose I look at the map from the space of polynomials up to all moments of degree 3d. This image, the map is not an algebraic map. It's given by functions that are hyperg functions. But is the image dense in this? Is it a variety somehow?
00:52:43.324 - 00:52:44.844, Speaker B: Is the closure a variety?
00:52:45.004 - 00:52:50.652, Speaker A: So you take the vector of coefficient of g, and you map that to the moments of up to order 3d.
00:52:50.788 - 00:53:07.344, Speaker C: Take all the coefficients up to order d, and then I map it to moments order 3d. That gives me a map. Naively, I might think that this parameterizes a variety, but the functions are not algebraic. So to what extent is that image a variety?
00:53:07.464 - 00:53:28.604, Speaker A: I have no idea. I don't know. I don't know. In fact, there's a question how to determine the other moments, because this function will be very complicated. It's related to this, actually. I have no idea. We don't know how the other moments can be deduced from these ones.
00:53:28.604 - 00:54:03.112, Speaker A: They depend on them only. But we don't know. We don't have an explicit expression for this. I would like to find one for the gaussian case. There is, but that's a very particular case. Any other questions? Yes, about the stability of this recovery. Stability? Well, the case of non algebraic boundary is a sort of stability in the sense that either you think that the boundary is non algebraic, or you might also think that the boundary is exactly algebraic.
00:54:03.112 - 00:54:25.304, Speaker A: But the moments are known with some error. So it looks, there is some robustness with uncertainty in the fact that when you look at the eigenvector of corresponding to a smaller second value, you retrieve something that makes sense. But we have not analyzed rigorously. We just observed that on one example. So it's encouraging. But.
00:54:29.644 - 00:54:32.724, Speaker B: Any other questions? All right, thank you.
