00:00:21.160 - 00:00:22.610, Speaker A: All right, well, welcome back.
00:00:27.240 - 00:00:27.624, Speaker B: Work.
00:00:27.672 - 00:00:47.808, Speaker A: I hope you all had a headache, had a good lunch. We're excited for the afternoon session. This is going to be our final two talks of the afternoon. And we're going to start with Giovanni Petri, who's going to be going through social learning across symbolic cultural barriers in sperm whales. Take it away, Giovanni.
00:00:47.864 - 00:01:10.940, Speaker C: Thank you. So, good afternoon, everybody. Thank you for coming back. I know the first talk in the afternoon is dangerous, especially considering size of the sandwiches we had for lunch, so I might fall asleep myself. I hope it doesn't happen. And I know that everybody's very excited about the mystery talk of Michael's later, so I'm going to try and keep this as brief as we can. As I can.
00:01:10.940 - 00:01:46.300, Speaker C: Sorry, that was a royal kingly plural. So one thing that I noticed, this is actually my very first decoding communication on human species third workshop. Apart from Gaspar's talk today, we didn't really have that much SETI talk so far, so I thought that someone should give the classic spiel, you know, the Vulgata of Seti also. So I lose a little bit of time, and then I can get to the end of this talk faster. And this is not working. Yes, it's working. First of all, that's the point, right? So our whole idea, the reason why we want to be here, is to answer, try and answer this question.
00:01:46.300 - 00:02:30.304, Speaker C: Can we understand them? Okay, now, why did we choose this big lungs of fat that tower at surface in the sea? Well, Shane is a very nice guy to work with, so that's a good motivation. But the reason is that there are. Well, there are multiple reasons for this. First of all is these are mostly some of the most alien things you can really think about. Okay? These are animals that came out of the water, got on land, became mammals, decided that the land wasn't really good for them. And then Basili came back into the water. And then about 30 million years ago, and the biologists correct me here, they actually spread the branch, and then we end up with the ways that we know together, and especially very smart ones down here.
00:02:30.304 - 00:02:52.472, Speaker C: Is this kind of point? Yes. Okay. Now, so this is one reason they're like, we are aliens, and so they're the alien thing we can actually think about and that we might want to talk to. The reason why we think we can talk to them is because, well, they have a very large brain. I mean, I forgot to remove mammalian. I mean, they're the biggest brain on earth right now. From the neuroscience point of view.
00:02:52.472 - 00:03:22.874, Speaker C: The neurons are pretty large. And probably their actions are very slow. So they probably are not super smart compared to us, at least by the measurements of how fast and how many neurons you have. But they're still very large, and they have very complex societies and complex communication patterns that we. And also we expect them to have some sort of cultural transmission. And one of the examples that actually got me hooked on this comes back to the 18th century. So they were about a million and a bit before we started hunting them.
00:03:22.874 - 00:03:58.870, Speaker C: There are about 300,000 right now. And if you actually go back and you look at the diaries, this actually is pretty cool, right, because it's like anthropological biology, something like that. There should be a name of that. And you look at the logs of the whalers. Turns out that the first time, you know, the first waves of whalers were pretty good at hunting them, okay? And it was very easy. And the reason was, at least reportedly, was that basically these animals would just put in this, you know, assume a circular formation at, you know, at the surface, protecting the vulnerable animals in the center. So basically, you just go there and harpoon them and wait for them to die.
00:03:58.870 - 00:05:14.176, Speaker C: Okay? Now, second wave of whalers found it a lot harder to hunt the same number of animals. Third wave, even harder and harder and harder. Now the question becomes, why is that? Is it because we have killed the vulnerable ones and so the other ones are harder to kill? Is it because the first wave of waves were really good and the second ones were kind of crappy, so they couldn't really hunt as well? Or was it because they started basically warning each other of them of this new predator that appeared in their environment? Actually, recent work has showed that this third one, the fact that there was some sort of communication between pods is the hypothesis that is supported best by the data. If you look at actually how knowledge spread. So actually, you can actually look at how hard it became to kill these animals by, in terms of how many successful hits as a fraction of their sighting in time from after the first sighting of humans in a certain area. So this would give you a little bit this evidence, a very, very, very indirect evidence based on captain lockbooks, that there was communication there. Now, there is something else that highlights them as alien animals to us and makes them very interesting, is that they live in a different world.
00:05:14.176 - 00:05:58.958, Speaker C: So the variability, we have heard this over the last two days, but the variability of the world that they experience is very large. You go from the surface where there is light, very little pressure to down over there. And now here, I'm using some of the videos that these are against the under SETi mechanism to show you exactly how you should imagine living this kind of life. So you basically turn yourself into like a sonic cannon. As you're going down, you create these very loud ecologation clicks that are extremely limited. And these are the ones that allow you as you're going down into this dark abyss to sort of create a soundscape that allows you to hunt, at least to have an idea what's going on. The sounds we heard a lot about that get created by bouncing clicks through the head.
00:05:58.958 - 00:06:23.226, Speaker C: They get expelled, collimated in front. They come back and they're absorbed through the lower jaw. That's what we believe. And then they're created to, you know, they're basically reconstructed in order to do exactly this kind of thing. Okay. Part of the idea is that we can actually, you know, we know that these animals are very loud. One of the ideas is that, you know, they use this kind of like extremely powerful localization acclimated to stun preys.
00:06:23.226 - 00:07:02.840, Speaker C: We don't really know whether that is completely true, but definitely they increase the size, the frequency of these ecologation trees as they get closer to the praise. Okay? And then they come up and then that's what you see. Now, this is most of their life, the other 1020 percent of their life. They spend it at the surface and they chat. They basically hang out. And the hanging out has done. We heard about quotas, but something that I don't think we have really said is that codas are very different in nature as types of vocalizations, where the ecologation clicks are extremely, basically a torch light in the darkest code has a broadband.
00:07:02.840 - 00:07:24.816, Speaker C: And they're, you know, you're busy blasting around, you know, and this is a video that you've seen. I think Gasper showed the same video this morning and he didn't mention that. I think this is some of our videos. This drone video aligned with microphone, you know, hydrophone tracks in the water. And the sounds you're hearing is basically these guys hanging out. And if you, you can probably, you know, see somewhere. That is also one of the tags, early version of the tags over there.
00:07:24.816 - 00:08:01.240, Speaker C: Okay. Now I have prepared a little bit of explanation of how this goes. I'm not going to go through this because we heard this before today. We actually had a whole talk about vocalization. The other thing that I really, at least as a physicist that I once was, really struck me as amazing is that these animals basically have an optical bank, optical table in their head. If you show this to a physicist, anybody who did quantum matter, sorry, condensed motor, they would think that these are basically laser lenses that you use to modulate, which is actually very beautiful. Not going to get into anything else on this level.
00:08:01.240 - 00:08:37.266, Speaker C: So we have these two types of vocalization, these very regular ecologation clicks, which are the ones you see there. And then these codas, which are the typical way in which I've always thought about whale local communication. And they have the pattern in various ways. And you can see there are multiple rhythms. And one of the things that I love is that you go in sort of oldish, but not even that old papers. And you end up looking at plots that look like this. These plots look like they've been made in, I don't know, 1995 with one of those old printers, really that it's like 2020.
00:08:37.266 - 00:09:28.272, Speaker C: I don't want to say anything more, but this is very surprising with respect to what actually we can do now. Why am I showing you this? Because then the question becomes, okay, we have some of this data, we are thinking about this problem. So another question becomes, what can we do with the data that reasonably we can have? The answer, at least so far has been, you can look for structure to explain. What I mean by structure is, I need to introduce a little bit of extra language. You can imagine having a waveform of this type we are calling ici. So interclick interval, the time between two different clicks, you know, one after the other. And of course, as I said, there are multiple repeatable patterns that are, that have been more or less identified as standard, at lETH Classically identified as standard types of patterns within.
00:09:28.272 - 00:10:04.282, Speaker C: Within the literature, okay? And those are called koda types. Now, the existence or the role of these koda types is becoming, is getting progressively more, to put more essentially more in doubt. For example, recent work by Patrusha and also the MIT team here shows that, for example, if you look at not just a single quota, but the sequences of quotas, you end up finding extra structure. For example, you end up finding that the same quota type, same quota type, multiple quotas in a row, they can actually stretch in time. You can actually have different changes in time as you go in. So it can accelerate, decelerate and so on. Okay, an interesting bit here.
00:10:04.282 - 00:10:41.060, Speaker C: So why is this interesting? Because it means that you can actually change the role. You know how you've modulated your cortisone different axis and then, of course, then can actually try and use this thing as. So these different features as an Alphabet say, okay, I can actually move all this along these all different nodes. This is one structure, one type of structure which is at the level of sequences of coders in here. Now, there is another type of structure which is using some of the notions that we have, some of the ideas that we know about what quotas are. For example, we know that some codas are used, are basically client fabric. They're going to be called identity codas or id coders.
00:10:41.060 - 00:11:05.120, Speaker C: And why do we call them identity coders? Well, because every social unit has set some of these quota types that they use a lot. For example, here you see data from the Pacific. Each of these column is a recording of a set of codas. And they have been classified. They've been basically, you're counting. This is a frequency distribution. You're counting how many of a certain prototype you have heard in this recording and so on.
00:11:05.120 - 00:11:39.300, Speaker C: Okay. And what you see is that some of these clans, so some of these groups have like very large, basically there are some coda types that are extremely more represented than others. And this is what we call Koda types. And actually, if you cluster on this, you know, on these vectors, you end up with clans which you can assert, which you can associate a sort of a vocal repertoire. A vocal, well, not gonna say style, repertoire, coherence. Okay. The other thing that you should notice here, and again, why am I showing you this is because this is something that is about at the group.
00:11:39.300 - 00:12:07.770, Speaker C: It's defined at this level of the repertoire, at the set of quotas, rather than just at the sequencing level. The other thing you can notice is that we are using a lot of these identity quotas. So they are here and they usually account for about 30% to 40%, in case a bit more for each repertoire. But then there is a lot of other quotas that we don't really know what they do. And they're called non identity quotas in the same way that the non identity whistles were called, because we don't really know what they are doing. Okay. But they are there and there are a lot.
00:12:07.770 - 00:12:33.650, Speaker C: Now, why is this interesting? Well, because the moment you start putting in a little bit of extra information, this is just structure. And this is just looking at listening to the sounds that you have classifying. Then you can actually put a little bit of geometry in there. So this is the data set that comes from the Pacific. As I told you, we can classify. We cannot, sorry, classify. You can cluster these repertoires in different vocally uniform clans from the point of view of repertoire.
00:12:33.650 - 00:13:09.332, Speaker C: And then you can put them on a map if you have this information, and in a sense, this information, this spatial information is the simplest, if one behavioral trait that you can have, you can think of, and you end up with something that looks like this. Now, for the people who have not read the paper, how many people have read this paper? Ah, good. For the people who have not read the paper, what do you notice? Look at the colors. That's a spoiler. And there are colors all over the map, which actually means that the clans are not spatially localized. So there are multiple repertoires belonging to. Well, we don't know whether it was one animal or multiple animals.
00:13:09.332 - 00:14:04.508, Speaker C: Just we know that we recorded there. But, you know, you can have red here, red here, and red down here. Okay. Then there are also some spaces and parts of the world in which you have a bunch of different clans all on top of each other. Okay, now this starts becoming beautiful and interesting, right? Because it means that these clans can span thousands of kilometers. And actually, you can do a bit more and actually show that this type of these identity codes that we're using, because the classification is mostly based on these identity codas, has a very beautiful property. First of all, if you take two recordings belonging to the same clan that are fighting space at a certain space that will have a certain similarity, and then you can take, you actually look at all the pairs of recordings belonging to the same clans at different distances, and then you see whether a similarity constant goes down, goes up, and so on.
00:14:04.508 - 00:14:43.804, Speaker C: And what you find is that the similarity between repertoires of recordings of animals, let's say, of groups of animals that belong to the same plant, goes down with space. Okay. It's not super surprising because it means that, you know, as you go further away, I mean, you sort of start talking a little bit different. Even if you, we all come from the east coast, you know, you pick up other words, you start using other terms, other ways of expressing. The beautiful thing is that then you can actually look at what happens when you compare the similarity of clans between different clans when they are more or less in spatial overlap. Okay. So if you have different number of.
00:14:43.804 - 00:15:39.732, Speaker C: So if you have multiple clans in the same space, you can actually say, well, are they? What is the similarity between them? And what you find is that as you increase the spatial overlap between clans, the similarity between the id codas repertoire of different plans goes down. Okay? Which actually means turning the, the argument around is that the closer you are, the more differently you speak, the more different the vocal repertoire that you use is. Okay, notice one more thing, that it doesn't happen for non id codas. Okay? So for the codas that we think are used at least mostly as markers of your clan identity, of your social membership, you have this effect. You don't have it for the NAD, which actually we interpret. Well, actually was interpreted. This is not our work is Taylor, Hirsch, Shane and a bunch of other people is interpreted as symbolic use of the codas to delineate social groups.
00:15:39.732 - 00:16:27.990, Speaker C: So it's like I am in a certain place, and I try to basically stress the way I speak to differentiate myself from others. If there are people coming from another place there that are using a different language. Okay? Up to here, I've spoken about codas, either sequences of coders, of sets of codas, you know, sets of coders with probabilities put on top. Now, there is another level, which is what happens inside quotas, okay? And another way of saying is that we can actually look at how codas are put together. Okay? And so our unit in this case is going to move from whole codas or parts of codas. Clicks. Okay, how do we look at this? Well, here I'm going to get a little bit technical for a little bit of time, so please bear with me.
00:16:27.990 - 00:16:49.682, Speaker C: We're going to do something similar to what you heard from Chiara at the beginning of yesterday. So we're going to symbolize our data. So instead we have our interclick times with some different continuous amounts of time. We're going to choose some resolution, and we're going to decide that everything, say below 0.3 is one symbol, a. Everything between 0.3 and 0.5,
00:16:49.682 - 00:17:16.952, Speaker C: it's b and so on. So basically you start from something continues like this, and you go to a sequence of symbols of this type. Just a very simple tokenization for the people who gonna ask later. Yes, we can check and we can choose in an optimal way the resolution of this. Okay. We actually check in a way that makes sense. And then the question becomes, can we predict the next ICI? Why? Because we would like to show that there is some structure and we can actually capture it.
00:17:16.952 - 00:17:50.938, Speaker C: Okay. If you do it this way, the classical, you know, the first approach will be to think about the Markov chain. So you can do this, you know, in terms of the, you know, what is the probability that given a certain amount of memory that you look in the back, you know, if you have only one step, is a classic Markov chain. If you look two steps in the back like a chain, so on, you actually measure what is the probability that you actually get it, right. And the thing that you see here, this is as a function of the memory. So actually I cut it out. What you see is that the transition probabilities you see, they start, they have a transition around here around two or three.
00:17:50.938 - 00:18:25.626, Speaker C: And actually it's a lot clearer when you actually look at the violence of the transition probability from one symbol to the next symbol, and you see that there is a peak around two, or, you know, two, three, four. Now, again, if you're a physicist and you look at this, you call this a secondary phase transition, because there is transition here, there is a susceptibility exploding and so on. We don't care about this. The interesting thing is we can actually try and select what is the best model, for example, using any bayesian criterion one. In this case it was the ikai k. And what you see is that you have this minimum around two, around three. Then it grows a little bit around four steps, around two, but it's not particularly strong.
00:18:25.698 - 00:18:26.026, Speaker A: Okay?
00:18:26.058 - 00:19:25.690, Speaker C: So this is telling you that to predict the next click, sometimes it's enough to know the intertype for the previous two. Sometimes you need three. Most of the time you need three, and so on and on and on. Okay, so the question begins, can we actually do a little bit better than this? Can we do something a bit more refined? Can we actually see whether we find memory blocks inside the structure or at least levels of memories that would allow us to define some notion of blocks under sub quota blocks. How do you do that? Well, the way you do this is by looking at all the possible ways in which you can do these transitions. So what I said is, for example, you start from one symbol and then you can look at, okay, what if there is another symbol? You know, I go from a to ab ba in this case. And then you actually measure, well, what is the probability? You know, what is the divergence of the probability that I need that I have to, if I use the prediction given by keeping the whole memory of two steps, or I just use this one step twice.
00:19:25.690 - 00:20:01.952, Speaker C: Okay? And then you can go on and on and on. You can increase the memory, you can play this game. And the problem, the problem here, I mean, it's clear, the problem is that you have all the possible other symbols away. So what happens is you end up with this huge ginormous graph of all the possible transition with some probabilities there. And the problem is that you can actually solve this because it takes a little bit of time, but you end up with something by trimming all the different branches in something that looks like this. And we call the. Well, this is a variable length Markov chain.
00:20:01.952 - 00:20:41.660, Speaker C: Technically, we call it a subcoded tree because it's a way that allows. It's a little model that allows us to build trees, sorry, build codas from this tree. And what you see is that you basically start here and then you emit the first element, the first symbol. Then from there you some probability you emit the second one and the third one, and so on. Okay, now why is this interesting? This is interesting because it's not just a very fancy Markov model, but it's also something we can actually compare. So we can actually build a distance between two different of these sub quota trees that we have fit to different repertoires or to different groups of repertoires. Or if you bunch them together.
00:20:41.660 - 00:21:20.700, Speaker C: Now, even before doing that, actually spoiling my own thunder, you can measure a little bit of complexity. For example, this guy here looks a little bit more complex than this other guy here, because you have more structure on one side and so the other one is more simple. So on. You can actually make this kind of argument to look at how deep they are, so forth. And something that, I mean, we have not really done. This is not a real result, but it's like, what an aspiration of a result and such a word. Talking with Kiara and other people, for example, talking about brain, about birds, is that you can actually say, well, suppose that you have a bunch, you have data from many, many, many different animals, okay? And you can do this and you can this tokenization in a controlled way for every animal.
00:21:20.700 - 00:21:43.692, Speaker C: You can end up with something that looks like this. Okay? Now this is something that we did. Again, I don't take any credit for this in a sense that. No, it's an illustration. So these were books, text, and actually the ones with the highest path length, the highest depth, were basically joists. So this one here were kin, children's book. We have some whales.
00:21:43.692 - 00:22:05.798, Speaker C: We also took some primate data of science. We also have some fish data here. And that somewhere there are little mushrooms. These little skulls are actually mushrooms. Again, don't take this too serious. This was more to show, to prove your point. But for example, the data that we use as signals before mushrooms, in this case fungi, where electrical signals have been measured in this MSN networks.
00:22:05.798 - 00:22:38.500, Speaker C: If you actually talk to the fungi people and you point to the paper, we took the data, they laugh at you. That's why I'm saying this is not a result, in a sense that this is what it should look like. But this is an aspiration. This is the kind of thing it would be awesome to be able to do. Why? Because imagine that you could relate something like this to the complexity environment, to the brain size, the body mass, and some sort of allometric scaling of these kind of things. Okay, now, going back to the previous point, on top of these, you can actually measure direct distances if you have this two of these sub color trees. Okay.
00:22:38.500 - 00:22:59.964, Speaker C: Whoa. Why again, talk to me if you're interested in details. It's very boring. It's very, it's not hard. It's just complicated. But the whole point is that you have to imagine that each of these nodes is really equipped with a probability distribution. So you have to find a mapping between all the probability distributions between all the nodes and the two sides.
00:22:59.964 - 00:23:38.560, Speaker C: This actually ends up with a distance that is directed. You can, using some tricks, symmetrize it and do classing and so on. But trust me, I can tell you a distance between this guy and this other guy. The details I can show you later because they're not really that interesting. Now, what do we get if we do this game on the data I showed you earlier? Well, first, if you want sanity check, we looked not at the data I showed you from the Pacific, but at the legacy Dominica data that we had. Why? Well, because in that case, we know who's who, right? We actually have complete control on the animals. No, well, sorry, that came out wrong.
00:23:38.560 - 00:24:21.686, Speaker C: We have complete control of who the animal who's talking, or at least a very large control, but we know who's talking in terms of which family is talking. And so we were interested in comparing these sub quota trees on the two sides. Now, something that I'm going to start using from now on is a term which is vocal style. The reason why we're saying vocal style is because we want to make, to discriminate from vocal repertoire. Vocal repertoire is what I spoke about until now, which is what is a set of code types that you use and with what frequency. The vocal style is how you put them together from the point of view of these intertime, these generative modes. Okay? So we do this for our clans in Dominica, and we end up with something that looks like this.
00:24:21.686 - 00:24:55.488, Speaker C: Okay? So you can measure the distance between the animals within the clan and the distance between the animals between clans. Okay? And, you know, if you are a data science or data visualization designer, you're going to be very angry with me because this tool is like duplicated information. Of course. Right? But the important point here is that this guy's much smaller than this guy, and this guy is much smaller than this other guy. Which means that clans, at least in Dominica up to now, have their own vocal style, which is more similar within the unit than across the units. Okay, pretty. They have the same accent.
00:24:55.488 - 00:25:34.806, Speaker C: We can actually check the classic that I showed you earlier, that we get the right class. Then the cool part starts. You can actually do the same thing again with the Pacific data that I showed you earlier. And I was talking about the symbolic use. Now here we are cheating a little bit in a sense that we are not really showing you the clustering done on the vocal style. And oh, we have a friend like a bird and comparing it and seeing whether they are, whether the clans are more vocally uniform than across clans. But the reason why we're not doing that is because it would be cheating if I use the vocal style distances directly to classicize.
00:25:34.806 - 00:26:14.090, Speaker C: Of course, by construction, anything I'm going to show you will have that, you know, that kind of bias. He said the reason why I'm showing you these plots, but aggregated by the vocal repertoire clans is to actually test whether the vocal style within this vocal repertoire clans is more uniform than across. And the answer again is yes. Okay, so vocal classical vocal clans that we have had so far, they both have a specific repertoire and specific style. And this is true across the whole Pacific at least. Okay, you can actually play this game again. And so do the clustering on the distances and check whether you find roughly reasonable clans.
00:26:14.090 - 00:27:04.236, Speaker C: We compared to the vocal repertoire once and it works. You see, there is a bit of noise here and I can explain why there is a bit of noise there. The reason is that if you, for example, if you take these distances between all the possible plants and then you sort of project it down to a few dimensions, you see that there are some plans that are clearly separated from the others and some that are a bit moreoverlap in this low dimensional space. So when you end up classing, you end up seeing this, okay? But by and large, the strong result is that you have these kind of effects, okay? But you can make like very pretty aggregated pictures and show them. And the reason why we want to do that is because we want to play again the same game that I played before. Right? So we use space as our very weak proxy for behavior. So we're going to do again this pairwise comparison between different clans.
00:27:04.236 - 00:27:36.560, Speaker C: Okay, now just to remind you what we saw earlier, we saw that when we're looking at identity quotas, the similarity between clans that are spatially overlapping. So the more they overlap in space, the more different they are, the lower the similarity in the decoder at the level of eddy quotas. And instead they are like, nothing happens at the non identity quota, which really you should see. Think about something of this type, right? You have a bunch of whales that are using different words. You know, dude, men, whatever, they mate. Yeah. So these are British.
00:27:36.560 - 00:28:12.966, Speaker C: These are, I don't know, chavs. And these are Americans, I guess. And then when they are in the same space, animals from the same clown in the same space, they basically exacerbate this behavior and they do something like this. It may make you do and so on. Okay, now, what happens instead of level non identity quotas in the vocal style is exactly the opposite. Right? So now imagine that our whales, belonging to different clans, they also are, I don't know, Scottish, Irish and American British, whatever. And so you got the Scottish, they say Brune, and the American say brown.
00:28:12.966 - 00:28:33.862, Speaker C: And, I don't know, Irish are saying, brain, whatever. I just couldn't come up with anything better. And when they are in the same space, they actually end up converging in terms of their style. Okay? So whenever they're closed in space, their vocal similarities actually converges. Sorry. The vocal similarity become. The vocal style become more similar to the other things around.
00:28:33.862 - 00:29:00.384, Speaker C: Okay. Now this is very nice because. Well, because it means multiple things. Well, first, that we have code repertoires and they're used for symbolic markings. But also it means that we actually have this kind of. Some form of social learning across these symbolic boundaries that have been built socially and using different words. Okay? And this is direct evidence.
00:29:00.384 - 00:29:22.668, Speaker C: So if you want, going back to the wailer example, that there is crossbod, cross unit communication of this type. Now, of course, making it sound very, very sure. There are limitations to. These are many limitations. And there are many other possible. There are some other possible explanations. One would be genetics, maybe they're similar.
00:29:22.668 - 00:29:49.172, Speaker C: And so that's why they have this kind of similar effect or some effects of the environments. We can pretty much exclude both because the genetics would impose other constraints that we don't see. Like, for example, local uniformity also on the. The family level and hence. And we know that, for example, passed through the family and so on. So there are reasons in which we can reasonably exclude other explanation of this type. Okay? And the environment is the same thing.
00:29:49.172 - 00:30:08.846, Speaker C: You know, for example, it's a question of where they are, the ocean basin. Because, as I said, as I was saying, you telling you earlier, you know, there are clans with different vocal repertoires across the whole ocean. So it cannot really, cannot really be that. The dominating effect now. Beautiful. Is this enough? Of course. I am here.
00:30:08.846 - 00:30:45.936, Speaker C: We are all here. So the answer is no. We would like to have more behavior. And what does it mean, more behavior? Well, if you belong to SETI, it means having your own bespoke, basically, apparatus for recording. And this is where the SETI commercial starts. And I think that when I was preparing these, I got some slides from Shane, well, not from Shane, from David. And actually tells you, I mean, it tells you how brave Shane is, right? Because we are graduating ourselves from a lonely biologist in the middle of the sea with a fishing rod and a hydrophone, probably with a kitchen bowl, I guess, right in the waters.
00:30:45.936 - 00:31:20.156, Speaker C: We're basically looking for ways like this to this kind of like James Bond villainy looking buoys with like very long hydrophones going down there. But the beautiful thing is that they're going to. Our hope is to get many millions or maybe billions of clicks every year. Now, again, if you follow it up to now, this should be meh. In a sense, this is beautiful. It's a great achievement, but it's, again, more structures and more data without any behavior. That's why the other part of the collaboration is actually trying to get this kind of behavior.
00:31:20.156 - 00:31:43.294, Speaker C: And the best way we can actually get behavior of this type is by sticking tags on the animals. And we have of the people here I lost. Anyway, there you go. That are basically. So the verb, the sentence that we use at the beginning, and I don't think we use it anymore, was let's accelerate the drone into the wave to smack the tag in and live away. We don't do that anymore. We do it in a very soft way.
00:31:43.294 - 00:32:39.372, Speaker C: But the beautiful thing is that this allows you to do in a soft robotics. So there is no penetration, anything, sort of monitoring of depth, behavior, sounds from the wheel itself and from its own local vicinity and so on. Okay. I think there were stories also about the success rates of the PhD students being much higher than the PIs, is that correct? Like if you student had like 100% twitch rate and instead like 30% for the PI, is that true? Okay, but the other beautiful thing that you can do if you have these kind of drones in the air is this. You know, you can have videos and you can actually try and make sense, for example, by segmenting the videos with all the difficulties that there are in doing this. And if you want to know how hard it is, talk to Joe here, or a lab in MIT. Why we want to do this? Well, because if we have something like these, then we can actually try and build something that looks like this.
00:32:39.372 - 00:33:12.668, Speaker C: And this becomes. Starts becoming. You can't really see here, but here there are little links. So what we're looking at now are temporal proximity or contact networks of whales at surface. At this point, you can actually start asking questions. For example, what is the sandwich? What is the role of this guy here, with respect to the other role of this other guy here, who spends most time close to a certain other whale? You can start asking questions. Is the association network you see here related to the kinship network or not? How does it change in time? And so on and on and on.
00:33:12.668 - 00:33:44.882, Speaker C: So this is actually where, here, between here and here, you start having a lot of behavior. They can actually then link the data up here to make sense of what we're doing. There's another beautiful thing that happens when you have this kind of drones in the air, and that is that you end up being very lucky. You know, last year you must have heard something happen. Christmas arrived early during summer. So the Seti one and Seti for two already, or they came later. They were in water, they were outside in the water.
00:33:44.882 - 00:34:01.210, Speaker C: They saw some weird behavior and they spent there. And we're very lucky. And then they end up seeing something that looks like this. Now, who knows what this is? Yes. Who doesn't? Nobody. Okay, so for the people who don't know what this is, what do you think it is? Blood. That's blood.
00:34:01.210 - 00:34:24.852, Speaker C: Okay, so what's happening here? Well, that's. Well, actually, Shane first thought that someone was pooping a lot. Then he realized it was too red to be poop. And so it's blood. Sure. You see this guy down here? There was a birth, and this is the first birth recording since the eighties, nineties. And, you know, I'm not going to say anything.
00:34:24.852 - 00:34:50.874, Speaker C: This is some more on these. This is something we are actively working on now, so stay tuned for this. But there are a bunch of things, even just by looking at the videos. And then you can imagine, you can guess. And then all the description I gave you about behavior earlier. So the segmentation, the networks and all of that, for example, I tell you, and quantify what is happening here. For example, the fact that you have the baby that is being held up by the rest of the animals, because otherwise it would sink just after birth.
00:34:50.874 - 00:35:00.346, Speaker C: Okay. And then you can actually, if you don't notice, there were, I think dolphins are here appearing at some point and so on. Okay. Yeah, those were by winds. Okay. Yeah. Sorry.
00:35:00.346 - 00:35:18.960, Speaker C: Later. Yeah, they were very quick. And I'm a physicist again, I'm still learning now with that. Thank you for your attention. And I'd like to leave you with, you know, the people that contributed the part of the coda style work mostly. And we like a quote from our scientific father. Thank you.
00:35:18.960 - 00:35:29.668, Speaker C: Whoa. Yes.
00:35:29.724 - 00:35:32.720, Speaker A: A lot of questions here. I'll just get it to the side of the room.
00:35:39.230 - 00:35:51.774, Speaker D: Great talk. Very, very interesting. I guess I have a question about the way in which you end up symbolizing these quotas. Right. So you are using Interclick interval. Is that the case?
00:35:51.942 - 00:35:52.270, Speaker B: Right.
00:35:52.310 - 00:36:13.982, Speaker D: So, yeah, I was just wondering. So we just saw a talk this morning that was basically arguing that there is likely further information that is encoded in this codas that actually is there when you. As soon as you remove the ice, then there might be more information being conveyed there. So I was just wondering if you think it's. It would be interesting and how you would enrich these networks that you're building.
00:36:14.126 - 00:36:14.878, Speaker C: Yes.
00:36:15.054 - 00:36:16.710, Speaker D: Yeah. Further information and how.
00:36:16.790 - 00:36:41.806, Speaker C: Yes, it's interesting. All of the things I mentioned are interesting. It could be added, for example, even some of the work that Patricia has done and the things that Gaspar was mentioning today, I discovered them today myself, so I didn't know about that. Definitely. So there are multiple ways in which you can do this. One way would be to make those symbols more complex. You can add spectropower, you can add vowel role, and so on.
00:36:41.806 - 00:37:11.940, Speaker C: So that would be the easiest thing that you could do. And again, I discovered that this morning, so I didn't really think deeply about that. But definitely it's something that can be put in here and it should be taken into account. It's just that we didn't do it in a sense, if you want, the fact that you have this kind of effects without that information tells you that information is important, but it probably is important for something else. So that, again, might be one way of getting at functional roles of the different parts of the vocalization.
00:37:13.440 - 00:37:18.060, Speaker D: Yeah, the method is super cool and promising, so just take it further.
00:37:18.680 - 00:37:19.728, Speaker C: You're biased, though.
00:37:19.784 - 00:37:20.500, Speaker D: I am.
00:37:27.090 - 00:38:23.170, Speaker C: I wanted to make sure I understand. With distance, the coda that is like your clan signifier slowly changes, but the non clan signifying ones don't change the similarity in the repertoires. Yes. The frequency, the relative frequencies of the quota. So the way we understand it, I mean, the way at least I understand it, and I don't want to talk for the rest of the collaborations, let's put it that way, is that as you get closer you need to sort of use more. You say, if you're from East Coast, West coast, you're going to say East coast all the time more. Because you really want to make sure that it's clear that you belong this social unit as you become closer for the rest of the quotas, which in my, at least in my head, contributes to the idea that they have a more social or communicative role, nothing changes, because the moment you establish that you belong to a certain group, you just talk normally about the rest.
00:38:23.170 - 00:38:57.198, Speaker C: So that's for the repertoire, for the style instead, for how they put them together. These animals are in proximity, so they. At least they can be in proximity, and then they hear each other. So we don't really know whether they meet very much like physically very, very, very close. But we do know that they can very likely hear each other. And so this is probably what's going on, so they overhear each other. An interesting task would be to see whether, now that we have ideas about, for example, the active space of codas, whether that actually can give us a prediction of how the original work about spreading on the knowledge about whalers, you know, how.
00:38:57.198 - 00:39:02.010, Speaker C: How fast should have that spread. Can we actually measure that, given that? So this would be something.
00:39:03.030 - 00:39:03.930, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:39:08.550 - 00:39:42.700, Speaker C: So there's work in, like, human language that says, like, structures should undergo more reduction. The less informative they are or the more predictable they are in context. So are your findings consistent with that? Something that carries is less predictable in context or in a noisy channel should have more effort or prototypical. I don't know. I don't know. In a sense that we don't have context. We didn't put context in this data because we didn't have it.
00:39:42.700 - 00:40:12.634, Speaker C: The main result, I mean, to have this kind of result, we needed space, so we don't have this kind of fine grain information about the passive data set. Now that we know about this, we can actually try and go back to the Dominica one, for example, or at least to new data with tags and so on, and try to do that kind of thing. See whether there is a redundancy and all these kind of structures when, for example, it's noisier, when it's more crowded and so on. Of course. Yeah, yeah, that's a good idea. Just. We couldn't do it now with this.
00:40:12.634 - 00:40:13.710, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:40:20.410 - 00:40:35.936, Speaker B: Thanks. It's fascinating talk. I have a couple of questions, so I just want to make sure I'm understanding something. So when they're coming close, when they're coming together, do they. They're sharing certain repertoire, a certain repertoire more.
00:40:36.008 - 00:41:03.496, Speaker C: So is that what you're saying in terms of repertoires? In terms of. Okay, let me say it in a way that is not appropriate. Let's say, okay, the words they use, there are some set of words they use to identify the clan. And they use them a lot more when they are sympathetic, when they are in close proximity. And the interpretation we give is that that's what they need. Well, not, that's actually not my work. This is theta's work, that the interpretation is that you need to use this kind of reinforcement of your social boundaries.
00:41:03.496 - 00:41:15.390, Speaker C: And then in this sense you're using the symbolic value id code us to do that, to differentiate yourself from the other cloud. And that's the cute part, is that you only see this for the identity coda repertoires and you don't see it for the.
00:41:18.050 - 00:41:34.230, Speaker B: Okay, I just wanted to check so when, so if they have their own codas, two groups, they come together, they're producing their own codas more when they're together. But is there a shared.
00:41:34.530 - 00:41:56.082, Speaker C: There are some sharing. There is some sharing. And also you have to understand that the measurement is done with respect, for example, group a and group b. They might have an animals that. Groups of animals that are at very large distances or very close distances. And so you're actually looking at this effect, how similar are here a and b when they're 1000 km away and when they're like 10 km away. Okay, got you.
00:41:56.146 - 00:42:05.926, Speaker B: And the other question I had is that when you use the term symbolize, and we've been using it a lot. Is there? Yeah, I'm just asking. I'm also a linguist and I'm just wondering.
00:42:05.978 - 00:42:06.810, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah.
00:42:07.710 - 00:42:12.446, Speaker B: Usually we talk a lot about categorization of single. Can you just talk about why you've.
00:42:12.478 - 00:42:36.162, Speaker C: Chosen to use symbolize, tokenize? I am. I'm sorry. No, this is actually something that came up. Something that came up also in review. So we don't think when we transform this sequence of intertimes, or continuous intertimes in symbols, in tokens, we are just doing this in a way that. Such that we can then have a discrete representation of them. We're not thinking about them as symbols as we discussed.
00:42:36.326 - 00:42:37.266, Speaker B: Thank you for clarifying.
00:42:37.298 - 00:42:40.226, Speaker C: I just. It's my bad. It's my bad.
00:42:40.258 - 00:42:40.962, Speaker B: No, no, it's fine.
00:42:40.986 - 00:42:53.146, Speaker C: I just wanted to clear and. But we can decide how to do this transformation in a way that is principled. I mean, I'm not going to show you, but I can show you later. It's like just a technical model selection bit. You can.
00:42:53.298 - 00:43:18.090, Speaker B: I just want to mention something. So Luis Baptista, who's no longer with us, did some beautiful work years ago. He was curator of birds and mammals at Cal academy, and he studied white crowned sparrows there. And they were four different groups, north, south, east and west. And I remember him talking about they all had their own dialects. And then when the north guys would go into the east group, they would converge. And there it.
00:43:18.750 - 00:43:28.930, Speaker C: I think this makes complete sense, honestly, if you think about from the point of view of reinforcement learning, like in neuroscience, not even in artificial networks, you are exposed to an input that is similar, so you drift toward that.
00:43:29.560 - 00:43:35.760, Speaker B: But also you're saying they retain their own clan sounds, which is, I'm separate, but I'm with you, too. I share.
00:43:35.880 - 00:43:53.816, Speaker C: I think the interpretation that makes more sense is that you have evolutionary pressure on maintaining your identity code as strong as they can, while the other one, since they are used for communication and you actually get information from other parts, they drift. They're allowed to drift.
00:43:53.928 - 00:43:54.780, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:43:58.150 - 00:44:00.454, Speaker C: Set me straight. I sent you that.
00:44:00.502 - 00:44:38.456, Speaker A: Okay, well, thank you, Gioma. One thing also, I really appreciate you making the kind of giving the broad overview of SETI and also just for point of people in the workshop to kind of call attention. I think we all sort of know each other now, but the Sharma et al. Pratusha is here in the corner if you wanted to talk more about that. Nature Communications 2024 paper. And for, also, thank you for shouting out to the, to the, to the engineering group. So, so Rob woods sitting in the front over here, as well as Daniel Voight and then Joseph in the back there involved in making the, some of the hardware.
00:44:38.456 - 00:44:46.752, Speaker A: So if anyone here had more kind of talk about pieces of the hardware, feel free to reach out to them. Thank you very much, Giovanni. Appreciate it.
00:44:46.776 - 00:44:47.460, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:44:52.600 - 00:44:54.440, Speaker A: All right, and now we're down to our.
