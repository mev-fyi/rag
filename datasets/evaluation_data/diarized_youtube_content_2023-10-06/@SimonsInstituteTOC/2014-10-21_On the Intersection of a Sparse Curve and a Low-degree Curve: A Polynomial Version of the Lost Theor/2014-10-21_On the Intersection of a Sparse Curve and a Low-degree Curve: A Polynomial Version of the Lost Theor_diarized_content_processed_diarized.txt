00:00:01.400 - 00:00:26.964, Speaker A: So, hello. Thank you for the organizer, for inviting me. So I wanted to present you some work I did with Pascal Pourin and Natasha Portier in Lyon. Seems strange. No, it's okay, it's okay. So, the title is on the intersection of a spare curve and a lot of grey curve. This is a polymer version of the loss theorem.
00:00:26.964 - 00:01:01.464, Speaker A: So, exactly what we want. We want to bond the number of roots of some particular polynomial system. And the first very basic things. If you want to count the number of complex roots, and you have a polynomial of the grid d, we know the number of roots is directly d. So here it is a case for complex roots. But what happened for real roots? For real roots, for example, here we have a polynomial of degree d and one of degree 200. And the number of real roots is always two.
00:01:01.464 - 00:01:50.914, Speaker A: And in fact, there is something which is known. They can't prove it. So, something to read before it is for the real root, we can consider the parameter which is the number of monomial, which we call the sparsity. And here, so the pasty is two and two. In fact, there is a result which we call the Descartes estimate, which states that if we have a polynomial which has only t monomials, then the number of real positive roots will be at most t minus one. In fact, if we want to count the number of real roots, it will be at most two t minus one. So in fact, this result is generally famous by Descartes rule of signs.
00:01:50.914 - 00:02:40.744, Speaker A: But yeah, Descartes rule of sign is more precise. So here it was for one polynomial. But what happens now if you want to consider a system of polynomials? So, if we consider the complex case, we have a system of n equation, for example, n variate. And if the system is not generated, there is a Bezel theorem. The jet, the number of complex solution will be at most the product of the degrees. Is it possible to do something similar for real roots and sparse system? If now we have a system so that f one is t one sparse until fn is t n sparse. Is it possible to count the number of real solutions of this system? So, this question was asked by Kushner and co.
00:02:40.744 - 00:02:54.538, Speaker A: Is there a function which only depends on t one until ta, which bounds the number of roots of the system? And what is if it exists, what is the optimal bond for this system?
00:02:54.706 - 00:02:56.178, Speaker B: What would these t's be?
00:02:56.306 - 00:03:27.814, Speaker A: Sorry, what are these t's? Sorry, the t are the sparsity of the function. So, we assume we have stem f one is t one sparse f two is t two. Sparse. Yeah. And what I call spacity is a number of millimeters, number of terms. So there exists a bone which only depends on the sparsity, and not at all on the degree. There was an initial case by Sebastianoff.
00:03:27.814 - 00:04:19.856, Speaker A: We tried to solve the previous question, and in fact it is. If we have a better case, we have a system with only two polynomials, which DIY polynomials, such that the first polynomial we know the degree is bounded by d, and the second polynomial, the number of terms is bonded by t. Is it possible to find a bond which depends only on d and t, which bounds the number of real solutions for the system? In fact, according to Kushner and co, Sebastianoft proved the existence of such a function. Sadly, he died sometimes after, and the proof was lost. But in fact, hovensky, some years, few years after, proves something which is more general. He achieved with if we have a system. In fact, he.
00:04:19.856 - 00:04:39.014, Speaker A: His proof is something for more general, of just a system of equation. Preliminary question. But if you have a system of polynomial equation in particular, and if the number of distinct monomials is small, then it's possible to find a bond which is here, which bonds the number of real solution of your system.
00:04:40.114 - 00:04:43.094, Speaker C: What does positive mean for the n variables?
00:04:43.594 - 00:04:44.210, Speaker A: Sorry?
00:04:44.322 - 00:04:47.218, Speaker C: What does positive mean for the n variable case?
00:04:47.346 - 00:04:51.134, Speaker A: Positive. It means each coordinate is positive.
00:04:51.894 - 00:05:00.554, Speaker D: Oskol points out that he was inspired by Sebastian Ostera, but this really that led him to this work. I'm going on this.
00:05:06.814 - 00:05:08.314, Speaker B: Published, this proof.
00:05:09.054 - 00:05:10.598, Speaker E: As far as we know, it's not published.
00:05:10.766 - 00:05:50.984, Speaker A: It's lost, really lost. And in particular. So, yeah, so it answers to the question by Koschmen. Co. In fact, there exists a bond. So the first question, for example, this bond, in fact, in the case of a system of polynomials, where I tested, there is an improvement by Bnc, so that if you have the same system of n equation and n variables, and the number of distinct monomers is small, then we can get a bone which is now just exponential in l square. And before it was exponential in l plus n squared.
00:05:50.984 - 00:06:31.950, Speaker A: So, improvement in the exponent. So here I point to before the general system. But what happened about, if we take the problem in the other direction, what are we able to do for small system, for particular cases? And for example, if we have a trinomial, f is a trinomial and g is t sparse. There is a result by Lee Rohra Sembron, so that the number of real solution is at most two. T means two. In fact, they generalized this result in the case where we have one polynomial, which is t sparse and other polynomials are dense or small degree. Sorry.
00:06:31.950 - 00:08:02.810, Speaker A: Other polynomials are trinomials. And in this case, the number of positive real roots will be function and n to the t. In fact, first, we improved the first result by proving that if we have a polynomial which is a trinomial, and another polynomial which is t sparse, is it possible to bond the number of real, positive real solutions of the system by a polynomial in t cube? In fact, we improve the previous result to get the case introduced by Sebastianov. If we have a polynomial f, which is non zero, but which is of degree at most d, and if g is this part, and if we want to bond the number of real solution of such a system, we are able to get a polynomial bond for number of solutions of realization. So the previous bond was given by the result by Bjorn satellite. And in fact, the constraint that f is not zero polynomial is important, because if it is the case, we are not able to solve this problem. So I said, you what we prove? It is, if we have a system such that f is of degree d and g is this part, we are able to get a polynomial number of solution.
00:08:02.810 - 00:08:58.084, Speaker A: But here, what happens both if the case is degenerate or not? What are my assumptions? In fact, we have the strongest result for this problem. In fact, we are able to count the number of real connected components. For example, if you have this set of zeros, we will get two, and we have a bound on both this number. So first, I wanted to introduce how we are able to prove something like that. And first, the idea is we can strengthen the hypothesis, we can add some variables hypothesis. And we add the hypothesis that the polynomial f is irreducible. And we add the hypothesis that the number of solution is finite.
00:08:58.084 - 00:09:43.364, Speaker A: So why we are able to do that? We suppose we are able to prove the lemma, how we can prove the theorem. So maybe in the lemma, we have these two hypotheses, and maybe they are wrong when you want to use the theorem. So, first, if the number of solution is infinite, in fact, it means that f is irreducible, so f divided g. So we just have to search the number to bond the number of zero of f, which is of small derivative. And this is known before, and there is a bond dt minus one. They are resolved by. I forget the name.
00:09:43.364 - 00:09:50.804, Speaker A: It's the generation of dessert, like Tom Petrovsky.
00:09:51.864 - 00:09:53.204, Speaker E: Petrovsky and Tom.
00:09:54.384 - 00:10:28.814, Speaker A: Sorry. And the second point, it is maybe f is not irreducible. So what it means that f is a product of irreversible. Factor f one until fk. And we just want to bond the number of real root of such a system. And after we will get all the real roots. So what this problem, what we want, in fact the idea is, first we have f equals zero.
00:10:28.814 - 00:11:22.364, Speaker A: We want to transform this equation into y equals a nice function of h. And after we can re inject this function into g xy equals zero. And we will get a small of nice function equals zero. And after we want to bound the number of hell roots of such a sum. So for the first step, we want to consider the solution of f of x, y equals zero. And for that we will use the cylindrical algebraic decomposition. So, we have the set of the zeros, we can cut the real line for the x coordinate into different intervals, so that on each interval there are some functions, a nice function of x.
00:11:22.364 - 00:11:58.304, Speaker A: What can you say? We can say, in fact, it's possible to show that the number of interval, it's at most d squared minus d. And the number of functions on each interval is at most d. So if we just want a polynomial boon, we can consider just the intersection of each part, each such a function energy, and we multiply at the end by a d cube. If you want to get the boon we announced before, we need to be a bit more precautions. And now we want to bond the number of roots of such a sum.
00:11:59.324 - 00:12:02.984, Speaker B: These h of x's are semi algebraic functions, not polynomials.
00:12:03.484 - 00:13:03.646, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. So we end up only the number of roots of such a function polynomial, because h is not a polynomial anymore. We will use the Vonscan. So in fact, it was already proved used for proving some result like that, for example, use it for proving, for reproving another proof for Descartes rule. There were some connection with before with a number of roots, which was introduced by Vurov and van der Porten. And for example, what is the wrong scan? The wrong scan, it is, you take the matrix, you have a familiar function, k function, which are sufficiently differentiable on an interval I. And you take a matrix, you put all your function in the first line.
00:13:03.646 - 00:13:58.294, Speaker A: In the second line, you put the first derivate of your function, and so on, until the last line is k means when derivative of your function, you take at the end the determinant of this matrix, you will get the von scheme of this family. And so the idea is, we want to upper bound the number of roots of a sum by the number of roots of some particular von schemes. So here in the basic case, what happens if you have an I, an interval? And we can grab these familiar von scans and we assume first we have no zero on I. This von Schalli does not have zero. And then we can prove that the number of zero of this sum is smaller than k minus one. So in fact we can prove it by induction. We can verify for check for k equals one.
00:13:58.294 - 00:14:26.786, Speaker A: But it's more interesting, k equals two. So if you have f one plus f two, you can put f one in factor. You get one plus f two over f one in the parenthesis. In fact, you know, f one is exactly bronze kan or f one. So by hypothesis, f one does not have zero. So you just need to search the zero of this parenthesis. You take the derivative of this parenthesis and you will get in fact exactly bronze kan of f one.
00:14:26.786 - 00:15:17.334, Speaker A: F two divided by f one square. By assumption, this does not have zero. By a rule, by a roll theorem, it means that before the number of roots, it at most one number of roots of this parenthesis, it at most one. Okay, now, if you have a sum of size p, you do the same, you put f one factor, you have this sum. The idea you want to use, you want to derivate these parentheses. After, when you derivate, you will get a sum of p minus one function. So you want to use your induction parenthesis, but in fact, your induction parenthesis, the assumption are about the wrong scan of the fi.
00:15:17.334 - 00:15:45.824, Speaker A: That's something, in fact, we can show it is if you consider now the von scan of the family f two divided by f one prime and so all so on until fq one prime. In fact, it's exactly the wrong square of f one until fq times one divided by f one to the p. So in fact, you can derivate and use your induction hypothesis. So in particular, the number of, of this sum is bounded by k minus.
00:15:45.864 - 00:15:49.550, Speaker E: One q and q, the same thing as p. No?
00:15:49.742 - 00:16:21.054, Speaker A: Ah, qq. Uh, yeah, it's q. Yeah, it's q, sorry. Yeah, so first is always the same. If you just want, you just search for a polynomial bone, you can say we search the zero of the states which are few k. And now you check on each interval between two roots, you count the number of intersections and you get an issue. Yeah, you get a bond.
00:16:21.054 - 00:17:27.994, Speaker A: In fact, if you want something which is more precise, we can get exactly if we need to check each root already quantitative or not, that the number of zero of a sum of size k is smaller than k minus one plus two times the sum of the number of the zero of each one of these ones. So what remains to be done, if we come back to our outline. So, we have rewritten f zero into y equals a nice function of x. We have bounded the number of roots of this sum by the number of roots of some particular one scans. So we just need to bond the number of hell roots of this family of wrong scans. So we just want to bond the number of roots of these wrong scans. In fact, the idea, it is why it was interesting to use the wrong scan it is now we can easily factorize some parts, some part in the colon or in the line.
00:17:27.994 - 00:18:38.124, Speaker A: So for example, here, if we consider the case where we are n equals three, so we have each monomial, which are the form x to the exponent, h to the exponent. And now when we took, when we derivate, in fact, we can see we can get something, a big part and factor, because at each time we can just touch the exponent by one element. So we can put for the first colon to all the x to the alpha one means two, h to the beta one means two factor, and do the same for each column. And at the end we have a big term in factor and a determinant of some nice function of small degrees. So the number of roots of this is just the root of x, the root of h. The number of roots of this, it is just a small polynomial in x and h. And so, if we do the computation, you can get, in fact, the number of connected components will be at most this polynomial in d and t.
00:18:38.124 - 00:19:28.306, Speaker A: Now, what are the perspectives? So, yeah, it was Sebastian a problem, but is it possible to extend this result, to generate this result? So the first ide, it is if you have one polynomial g, which is parse, and other polynomial f one until fn, which are dense. In fact, with Moab safely in Pascal, Quran. We need to finish the proof, but it seems almost done. Another problem. It is so here I think it really is harder. This is what happens if we have f which is parse and g which is parse. Yeah, just to the question to system.
00:19:28.306 - 00:19:46.272, Speaker A: And in fact, this corresponds to the case where f equals zero. And you just want g is a b variate and sparse the case before I say the constraint f zero was important, otherwise we are in this case.
00:19:46.448 - 00:19:48.444, Speaker B: Why isn't this Kovanski theorem?
00:19:49.544 - 00:19:51.044, Speaker A: Why is the relation between.
00:19:52.264 - 00:19:58.168, Speaker B: Why is this Kovanski? If f and g are both parts, then Kovanski's theorem.
00:19:58.216 - 00:20:09.644, Speaker A: Yeah, but we have always the bond which is exponential on the opacity. And always the idea is to search is it possible to find a polynomial bond?
00:20:10.204 - 00:20:22.104, Speaker D: This case, I mean you get from Quonsky's theorem, it's just wrong, just too big. Yes, they have different supports. If they have the same support, it wouldn't be so bad. But having different supports is crazy.
00:20:22.484 - 00:20:24.860, Speaker E: I think that's would we happy you.
00:20:24.892 - 00:20:27.100, Speaker D: Could bound the number of connected components.
00:20:27.132 - 00:20:28.824, Speaker A: In terms of the sparsity of.
00:20:30.524 - 00:20:32.580, Speaker E: It's still exponential. It's still exponential.
00:20:32.612 - 00:20:33.184, Speaker B: Actually.
00:20:36.424 - 00:20:37.936, Speaker C: Could you explain how both of.
00:20:37.960 - 00:21:55.664, Speaker A: Them sparse correspond to f zero, the other sparse? Because if we are able to do f equals zero and g is sparse, what happens? And if you have a system like that, we can put f squared plus g square and you try to search which are the solution, and it will be exactly the solution of the system. And so we are suggesting the number of solutions for such a system. But now, is it possible to do something with such a solution? Possible to counting them, for detecting them or something like that. We don't know. I wanted to give you one motivation first. When I was in introduced to this problem, it was by a conjecture by Pascal. Poron said that if you have a particular family of polynomial, which is the sum of product of sparse polynomial, is it possible to show that all these polynomials, the number of her roots is polynomials in these parameters.
00:21:55.664 - 00:22:46.984, Speaker A: In fact, what is interesting with this real topography, it is that it implies lower bound for the size of arithmetic circuits for the permanent. And so I wanted to finish by with some stupid problem. If you want to play, if you have two polynomials, f and g, which are t spars. So f number of real roots, it at most two, t minus one 4g is the same. It's just descartes estimate. If we take the product, the number of roots will be at most either of the roots of f, either the root of g, and you can count, in fact, the number of roots will be at most 40 minus three. And now we consider fg plus one.
00:22:46.984 - 00:23:14.854, Speaker A: So in fact, it's a basic case of this. It is a sum of product of polynomials. What is the number of real roots? We expand the product and we count the number of terms. We can get a bone which is two times t square minus one. But before it was linear in t. And now we are quadratic in t. And we don't know if there exists or not a bond which is linear anti or something somewhere between linear and quadratic.
00:23:14.854 - 00:23:18.694, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:23:24.964 - 00:23:38.024, Speaker C: Questions? No questions anywhere in the room.
00:23:42.324 - 00:23:47.444, Speaker B: Does it have any application other with bivariate case or any other?
00:23:48.344 - 00:24:24.454, Speaker A: Not directly, but maybe we hope that if we are able to get non trivial argument here or something which is linear to do the same after to do the same. If you press x, something like that. And to get something which is non trivial for this problem. The idea is to find a tool for this problem. And just with this basic case, we are stuck. So maybe the tool for this case, we hope could be generalized for.
00:24:24.954 - 00:24:33.694, Speaker D: So this is the case that this last question arose. You didn't think this up? In a room without windows, somebody asked you this question, isn't that someone mentioned this.
00:24:33.994 - 00:24:39.364, Speaker A: So I don't know exactly who you see someone in your factor for.
00:24:41.264 - 00:24:42.936, Speaker C: Ah, you mean for sg plus one.
00:24:43.000 - 00:24:43.696, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:24:43.880 - 00:25:26.102, Speaker C: Oh, okay. So. So I asked this general question and then we looked at various cases. Like for instance, you can look at f one times f two times f m plus one m four product and ask whether there's a bound that is polynomial in m. Someone pointed out that even for two fold product, it's not known as this was observed by arcade shadow ballet. That even. Yeah, even for if you have a product of two polynomials, it's not obvious.
00:25:26.158 - 00:25:27.598, Speaker A: What the optimal bound is.
00:25:27.726 - 00:25:50.350, Speaker E: It seems to be a serious stepping stone, that one. It seems that you should be able to get more and a comment on this. If you look at this tropically, then there's some motivation. So if you look at this over the p addicts, or if you look at over the reals, then under some combinatorial assumptions, then it seems like there might be a linear bound. But something being true tropically does not mean that it's true for in the real world.
00:25:50.502 - 00:25:51.958, Speaker D: It's true in a very extreme sense.
00:25:52.006 - 00:25:56.754, Speaker E: Yes, exactly. So it's true in extreme sense, not extreme ones. Yeah, that's exactly the, the problem.
00:26:00.814 - 00:26:01.874, Speaker A: Another question.
00:26:03.374 - 00:26:11.294, Speaker C: Okay, so when we stop here. Thank you. Next.
