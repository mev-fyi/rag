00:02:22.624 - 00:02:52.797, Speaker A: Thank you very much for the introduction and I really appreciate the appreciation. And my chair supposed to be just came. Okay, thank you everyone for coming to my talk today. So what I plan to talk about is about the mixing time of open quantum system. Specifically I'm going to dive into the idea of the so called hypercursivity. I will talk a little bit about what it actually means. And as you can see, this is drawing work with Jian Feng Lu, who is a cognizer of this event, sitting in the audience and also Yu Tong sitting in the audience.
00:02:52.797 - 00:03:28.123, Speaker A: So as you can see, all the three of us are in Duke. But actually this project didn't start it until all of us were actually at UCLA at the LA area. So sometimes it's good for us to travel around, sometimes new ideas can come along. Here is outline. First of all I will discuss what is the missing time. I will just define the definition of the problem because we have already seen various reasons why we want to consider this problem. I will discuss a little bit what is mixing time, what are the state of art? What are the relevant tools we use to estimate mixing time.
00:03:28.123 - 00:03:52.047, Speaker A: Then propose open question after that I will discuss this idea of hyper coercivity. Then I will discuss the results of our work, especially the statement on how we understand it. And then I talk about some of the applications. Okay, so let's get started. I'm going to start by talking about the equations. And we have already seen this equation. So dealing time inside of this workshop, which is the topic of the workshop.
00:03:52.047 - 00:04:20.061, Speaker A: So I will not tell discuss like what is motivation, how we derive it, but rather I will just say that inside of my talk today I will mainly focus on the Heisenberg picture. While I'm looking at the observables that are time evolved. We have a Hamiltonian part. This curly A stands for the Hamiltonian part. And then I also have a dissipative part that is governed by all of these jump operators. This D and curly D is the dissipative part. As we have seen in many of the previous talks.
00:04:20.061 - 00:05:10.201, Speaker A: There's also a duality representation in the shortened picture where we can look at the time evolved state and this is the corresponding picture. The two picture are exactly equivalent under the duality in the regular Hubert Schmidt inner product. So throughout my talk, whenever I see L, I mean the Heisenberg picture and all of these are Heisenberg pictures. So by say star, this means the corresponding Schrodinger's picture. So now what is mixing time? I just want to say the definition of mixing time that we want to study is how fast does the system approach to equilibrium? Otherwise how fast does it thermalize? Before diving into the concrete definition of mixing time, I just want to discuss a little bit of why do we care? As you are in this conference, you already know why we should care. But I think it doesn't matter. I just briefly go through it again.
00:05:10.201 - 00:06:13.289, Speaker A: So dated back to 2009 by this amazing folks, they have shown that dissipative quantum dynamics is actually universal, can be used to do universal quantum computation and later they find this pretty useful in terms of quantum field series simulation in their data papers. Then we do understand there is a surge inside of this field. Greater advances has been made since last year. At least some of these really significant advances in the field. For example, we have seen lean bloody dynamics can be used to prepare thermostates and ground state preparation, local medium, which will be the next talk, and the quantum control which we have already heard about, and also sometimes some classical optimization. So the point is that many of these algorithms are actually talking about lean bloody equation. Specifically, if you look at some of the formulations, say if you talk about ground state preparation or classical optimization, the formulation is that you want to formulate your in the blood equation in the form so that the thermostat is the actual solution you want in the end of the day.
00:06:13.289 - 00:06:46.055, Speaker A: So you can imagine, then you use a quantum algorithm to solve it. The mixing time will come into the complexity estimate or the cost estimate, at least in a polynomial fashion. So you know how long you need to simulate those equations. That's why mixing time is a really important feature. Not just because it's obvious physical meanings, but also because the algorithmic applications. What I find particular amazing for this workshop is that for all these recent development, for each of this significant work, at least one of the author is actually in the audience. So this is where our workshop is really great.
00:06:46.055 - 00:07:12.897, Speaker A: So now I just want to define what is the mixing time that I'm going to talk about. So this has already defined by other talks. So I'm going to look at a shadow one norm or the trace norm, whichever you may you prefer. And then I'm looking at the Schrodinger's picture and I want to show that it's evolution up to thermal state. They bonded by sort of epsilon. And this is the notion of meeting time that I'm going to use. Apparently this is a quantum information, which is our target question.
00:07:12.897 - 00:08:01.475, Speaker A: However, we do understand that this problem have very different names. A Quantum Markov semi Group just as Nathan said, sometimes if its name already suggests you what you want to do, that's great. So we do understand that Markov semic group then there is definitely a probability viewpoint. For example, you can utilize the two in ergodicity theory and detail balance, which is very important and we have see a great deal about that. At the same time this is really a differential equation. So correspondingly people can also think about from a differential equation viewpoint correspondingly dynamical system where when we talk about the global the global equilibrium we will talk about maybe some energy estimates or Lyapunov energy functionals. So my overall approach is more aligned on the Lyapunov functional approach which I will show you soon.
00:08:01.475 - 00:08:36.299, Speaker A: So now it's time to just revisit a little bit about the existing works amazing of the advances in this field how to estimate the mixing time. So I will say this is the typical route that one will take. First of all you have a Hamiltonian. First of all you have a Linda Bloody of your interest and the first thing you do is you choose your favorite inner product. Now it can be gls, can be kms, can be any of the other interpolation and then you want to first check that your linear bloody is actually detailed balanced. This will ensure that the eigenvalues, the spectrum of the Linda Gladys are actually real. So it makes sense for us to talk about the spectral gap notation.
00:08:36.299 - 00:09:22.095, Speaker A: So this would be the first thing that you want to check. If not, you can imagine the eigens the spectrum may not guarantee to be real. So instead of the full inner Vladimir people can talk about, you know, the symmetrization of so that it satisfies the detailed balance. In other words, you look at the Hermitian part of the if this is a satisfies grid, then the next task we need to do is to estimate the lower bounds of the spectral gap because all of this spectrum now is real. So we can just talk about what is the spectral gap in a very well defined way so that we can estimate the lower bounds of the spectrum. There is this amazing set of works along this line. Then if we say the spectral gap is G, then we can easily get exponential decay.
00:09:22.095 - 00:10:24.775, Speaker A: We will immediately get that this is a Heisenberg picture where G exactly govern the decay rate. Then we can just simply use the duality argument. The Heisenberg picture and Schrodinger picture follows the duality argument and simply get a mixing time estimate. The takeaway message would then be, especially for quantum applications, is that if the gap is polynomial Correspondingly, we will have a polynomial mixing time which will mean the quantum algorithm is very efficient. There is another line of work, for example, for this if we just look at a so called L2 framework, even if your gap is just a constant, still you can only show its polynomial mixing. However, this amazing line of modified log solving inequality will be able to further tighten the bound and show you there are cases. For example, if you have 1D commuting harmony and the gap is constant and you can show using log solve the inequality that the meeting time is actually poly logic that is very significant.
00:10:25.515 - 00:10:35.715, Speaker B: Please, one question. So when you say that there is no denial balance condition, what do you mean by consider the symmetrization of.
00:10:35.795 - 00:11:02.299, Speaker A: I will show you an example later. Yeah, I will just say that for example, if the whole linear vladia is not detailed balance, in other words, what is detailed balance? It means you choose a favorite inner product. You want to check whether the linear vladia is symmetric. I'll sample the drawing either that inner product. If that's not the case, you can imagine I can take the hermitian part, the self or the joint part. I can still talk about that. I will give you a concrete example in the most minimized version to show you the idea of the so called hypercursivity.
00:11:02.387 - 00:11:04.947, Speaker B: Let's say the symmetrization may not always work.
00:11:05.051 - 00:11:27.685, Speaker A: Yeah, that's right. That's why I will talk about the cases when symmetrization does not work. Thank you for the remark. I guess the takeaway for the previous work is to say that it's very important. We want to estimate the special gap. Also, deep health balance, as you can see is extremely important. It's pretty much the beginning point of the considerations.
00:11:27.685 - 00:12:17.547, Speaker A: Now what I want to say a little bit is actually estimating the spectral gap is a very difficult task in reality, as many of us know. That's why we are attending this workshop just giving you some simple examples. For example, even if my Hamiltonian part and dissipative part are super simple, for example, maybe part is just a transverse easy model 1D and you pretty much know everything and your noise may be just some simple poly noise. And then you pretty much know everything as well. However, as soon as you add them together, you want to say okay, let's try to estimate the special gap. That's actually not as simple as a problem to treat both of them separately. Another scenario you can imagine is suppose my dissipative part have a bunch of jump rate operators.
00:12:17.547 - 00:13:07.133, Speaker A: Maybe they only acting on very few size that I'M considering and then I put it in a super large Huber space where H acting on all these terms. So if you look only look at the dissipative part, there are many things you can do with it. However, as long as you put it into a super large Huber space, the whole special gap estimation is going to become difficult. So the corresponding question that I want to address in this talk is that is it possible, suppose I do have very simple D and I have very simple Hamiltonian. Is it possible to have some way, or at least the existence maybe of some sufficient conditions so that I can treat the D part, H part separately, somewhat separately. You will see what I mean later, yet still yield a mixing time estimation. And also we want to ask ourselves, is detailed balance have.
00:13:07.133 - 00:14:14.915, Speaker A: Does detail balance have to be the beginning point? So what if my lean the bloody as a whole do not certify detail balance at the very beginning? Is there, can you say at least that there exists, you know, some lean blood equation? Although detailed balance is not satisfied yet, you can still say a little bit something about the mixing time. So that's what I'm going to discuss now. So regarding this question, I would say the answer is yes, because I'm only asking is there any cases? So there are cases. So concretely in this work we propose a theoretical framework where we propose a set of sufficient conditions, if you like, where we treat this H and D sort of in a somewhat separated fashion. I will show you what the condition are and then we can still establish this exponential convergence of the bloody equation to its equilibrium. And the second thing is that throughout our discussion later, we will not assume the whole in the body have a detailed balance to begin with. And I'm not saying all the cases where I do not treat it, definitely not, but there exists at least some cases where, being the lady, is not detailed balance, nevertheless we can prove a convergent rate.
00:14:14.915 - 00:15:12.579, Speaker A: So you may wonder, okay, fine, you have a theoretical framework, so what? Mathematically you can do whatever you like. You can define whatever condition you like, and you can prove beautiful theorems about it, beautiful properties. But if there's absolutely no applications, then maybe that's not as interesting. So I will indeed show some applications which may be interesting to you, may not be interesting to you. But what I will show is I will consider some simple polynoids and I will show you the following three examples. One is transverse field, easy model, Heisenberg model and quantum work where we can provide, well, for these models, the conditions that we want to certify can Be very easily checked. And lastly, I just want to say that the construction of this is really the dynamical system viewpoint where we want to come up as a diapno functional and how to come up with that is tightly associated and inspired by the concept of hypercursivity which originates from the Kinect theory.
00:15:12.579 - 00:15:56.737, Speaker A: Before I dive into our result, I will just first talk a little bit of what exactly is hypercursivity. Here is some history slides to respect all of these geniuses who come up with the idea. Hypercursivity is originally proposed to study the so called kinetic theory means the theory for kinetic equation. What are kinetic equations? We are all familiar with the Schrodinger equation which are on the quantum level, fundamental level. And then if say there is object like some force, then this is a dynamical system level which is a classical dynamics. And then we also know if we want to send, you know, a plane to the sky is the fluid dynamics. So the kinetic equation is actually in between these two levels.
00:15:56.737 - 00:16:45.573, Speaker A: So specifically if we talk about the verified gas or plasma, then those equations are kinetic equations. Some famous example includes, you know, Boltzmann equation. For Kaplan's equation, we'll have Boson equation and so on, so forth. So the hypercursivity was originally proposed to study this type of equations by the famous mathematician Villali back into 2001 and 2005. At the time he didn't name it hypercursivity and later he write it into a mimer and then later published as a sort of a book and formally name it as a hypercursivity. And Milani was awarded Fields medal due to the contribution to his contribution to kinetic equations. One is precisely the equilibrium behavior hypercursivity.
00:16:45.573 - 00:17:45.367, Speaker A: The other was the Landau damping which is also a kinetic equation relevant object. So there's indeed after that, as you can see this is a really significant involvement in the mathematical side. After that there are many famous and great mathematicians come into the play and they have developed different frameworks and made significant advances into the hypercursivity field. So some of the notable example is for example Mahat was a one of the student by Villani. He together with Vinny also write the other work. Lando dampened these two villages fell medal and together with Dubot and Schmer further developed a very significant framework of hypercurs which further inspired many of the data applications. Also just to talk about application originally from the kinetic theory, as you can imagine previously I have this slides where all of the physical dynamics are actually tightly connected.
00:17:45.367 - 00:18:39.023, Speaker A: You can imagine the Hypercursivity if you go to the other side of limit where you have some fluid dynamics where people such as Jacob Bedels and so on, their collaborators and av so far they have shown that hypercursivity can also be used to study shear flows and some invasive damping behaviors that are significant. On the other side, the dynamical system sides since kinetic equation is closely tied by dynamic system sd which is further tied to sampling problems. And we have the expert Jian Feng, who develop a lot of frameworks and hypercursivity related results over there for sampling applications. And also there's mathematical biology such as blockings and authority quantifications, so on and so forth. There are just many more applications. So today I'm very glad to present that we also have a quantum application. So in terms of my previous graph, because now hyperconceivity complete the whole picture.
00:18:39.023 - 00:18:48.875, Speaker A: So quantum we can also use hypercar. Now I'm going to discuss, you know, minimal example. What exactly is hypercursivity? Please.
00:18:49.215 - 00:18:50.535, Speaker B: That's exactly what I was asking.
00:18:50.575 - 00:19:09.397, Speaker A: Yeah, sorry. Right, right, right. So I wouldn't take the credit of this com this simple ODE example to myself. It was actually dated back to Arnold a talk that I attended back in 2017. At the time it's. I wasn't working on quantum computing. I was still very much involved in the kinetic community.
00:19:09.397 - 00:19:39.891, Speaker A: And he had this I find ingenious demonstration, very simple demonstration through all the what is hypercursivity? So I decided to show you. So now I'm just going to consider a very simple ode. Forget about lean bloody and forget about quantum dynamics. And this is negative A. I'm going to talk about the coercivity. So you cannot talk about hypercursivity without defining what is coercivity. So coercivity coercive is defined if the hermitian part of the any of the matrix.
00:19:39.891 - 00:20:16.845, Speaker A: We can also be that composing into the hermitian part or anti hermitian part. Coercivity states that if the hermitian part has this bounds then correspondingly you can immediately get exponential decay. You can imagine this is under the detailed balance and the special gap. We immediately get exponential decay. But then the question natural question that they have been asked is that its coercivity the necessary condition for you to get exponential decay. Certainly not right? If we think about the simple odds. This slide is just to show you a little bit how do I get the exponential decay? I think this is fairly important.
00:20:16.845 - 00:21:03.233, Speaker A: So I just show you. Similar behavior happens in the bloody case as well. So the way that you prove it is by Energy functional methods by the up, no functional masses. So you want to take the inner product between the X and you look at what the differential equation and you hope this is bounded by what I say bonded by negative G and X norm, so that you can just simply do that and you can substitute E. Then what will happen is, please everyone think together with me for three seconds of what is the outcome of this product, if you will, I should have count three seconds is that you will get the Hermitian part. So that's why hermitian part is coercivity, that's related to exponential decay. So correspondingly we get that.
00:21:03.233 - 00:21:26.021, Speaker A: And here I just do the simple chain rule, and so on, so forth. We get precisely the previous case. The question is then, is coercivity a necessary condition for exponential decay? Certainly not. It's because in simple odes we have. Well, simple odes are so simple we can just write it into its drawdown form and so on, so forth. There was a question, please. So in the previous slide you have.
00:21:26.053 - 00:21:28.829, Speaker B: X A, X the A is equals.
00:21:28.877 - 00:21:31.197, Speaker A: Aha. So there should be a curve aa, Right.
00:21:31.221 - 00:21:33.025, Speaker B: So what is the term aa?
00:21:33.965 - 00:22:18.217, Speaker A: Oh, you mean this term or like from here to here? Is that the question? From here to here? Yeah, it's because the hermitian parts is defined by one half of a plus a dagger. And so that's precisely what this is. This corresponds to. Yeah, the hermitian part of a. I should have written it is that it's 1/2 of a plus a dagger and the anti Hermitian part is the other is the opposite. Yeah, that's right. So just to recall back as what I will, you will see later, anything that is anti hermitian will just disappear in this energy estimation.
00:22:18.217 - 00:22:53.013, Speaker A: So let me continue the story if that's really the case. Well, for all the simple odes we can just diagonal write it into the Jordan canonical form and then we will immediately get this sympathetic behavior, which is what I teach in my ode class last month. So this is a very simple example. So what I'm trying to say is, through this very simple example, what is the Hermitian part? It's just the diagonal part. What you immediately realize is that this needs to hold for all X. You can simply take the eigenvalues of the zero mode and you just plug in. You realize it's zero.
00:22:53.013 - 00:23:25.507, Speaker A: So your G is going to just be zero. In other words, through this coercivity argument, you will not be able to get any of the decay. But the question is, is there really no decay? Well, the answer is certainly no. It's because you can. We can look at the eigenvalues which give us this. So by simple ode basics we know that this actually gave us a decay rate that is precisely one half. The way you do it is to think about the fundamental matrix where A is T and Jordan block T inverse and then you multiply both cases.
00:23:25.507 - 00:24:09.649, Speaker A: I just want to make a quick comment. Why say you do not want to necessarily do it in that way in reality, even for later in blood equation, is that if you do that way, you realize the sympathy here where the constant will have the norm of T and the T inverse which is a condition number of the matrix which can be arbitrarily bad. So still, even in this cases the energy method is still going to be very helpful. That's why we do not teach the energy method. Instead we want to say is there any modifications we can do to the energy methods so that we can yield something helpful. This was just the previous plot where I'm plotting the derivative of the L2 norm. And the precise reason where I cannot get the case because you can see there is a bunch of black holes where the derivative is flat.
00:24:09.649 - 00:24:53.109, Speaker A: So that I can just get something that is bounded by zero instead of saying that is actually decay. If you think about from the level set viewpoint, X squared, Y squared, this is already up to function or you draw a bunch of the level set. What you will see is that the solution sometimes become conjunctional to each of the level sets. So you can no longer guarantee it is decaying to your. So what is the easy fix? Actually the easy fix is just to say well, instead of consider that regular L2 norm which is energy, the energy we typically use, we talk, we want to consider a twisted L2 norm. Precisely the twisted L2 norm for this simple case is just that. So what will happen is you can treat it as the up no functional and then you just work out all the.
00:24:53.109 - 00:25:20.929, Speaker A: All the simple algebras you will see you give. It gives you precisely negative 1/2 rate as what is expected originally. So on this graph I'm just showing that if you look at this new tracing norm, you can actually get exponential decay. There's no plateaus. And if you think about level set picture is this new level sets and it will guarantee the solution will never. The direction of the solution will never become tangential to the level sets to the diagonal functions. So this is.
00:25:20.929 - 00:25:36.039, Speaker A: I would claim that this is really the key idea of what is hypercursivity. So in the simple ode case, because sort of define hyper coercivity in the case where A is not hypercars, A is not coercive yet because you have exponential decay.
00:25:36.137 - 00:25:39.135, Speaker B: Is there a way to stare at this and come up with this P?
00:25:39.515 - 00:25:58.255, Speaker A: I'll come up with this. Yeah, that's right. So how to come up with the P is the part of the proof. That's what we are supposed to figure out ourselves. That's a very good question. So for this simple diabno functional case, it's very simple to come up with. For ODE cases, it's pretty simple to come up with.
00:25:58.255 - 00:26:12.765, Speaker A: You just put P1, 1, P12 and you just calculate it and you want to. Yeah, that's actually. This is, you know, via Teach od. This is one of the homework question that. For this it is easy once you have.
00:26:13.065 - 00:26:14.905, Speaker B: But how to come up with this particular.
00:26:15.065 - 00:26:50.085, Speaker A: Oh no, what I want to say is that you write out all of these things. You write out all the right hand side and you want to control the right hand side by some constant which you don't know yet and together with the P norm. So you can write out. This is a simple two by two cases. You can write out the whole right hand side and you can write a constant C times the P norm and you have all the coefficients and then you start to choose the P11, P1, 2, all the four degrees of freedom so that you can actually gather. Actually for this case it's two degrees of freedom because of diagonals needs to be the same. So you can actually play around with that and get it through.
00:26:50.665 - 00:27:11.245, Speaker B: Yes. So under the same setting, if I have much more complicated matrix, what I need to do is I first. I first transfer from it to a Jordan form. Therefore any jotform you have a canonical way to come out with the P and then you just.
00:27:11.745 - 00:27:27.965, Speaker A: Yeah, but that. That was sort of the way that I was. I want to avoid. Because once we go to the dotted form, we have the transform matrix T and we have the, you know, the condition number of the T. That's what I try to avoid. That's true. Yeah.
00:27:27.965 - 00:27:37.385, Speaker A: Thank you. Okay, so now I'm going to talk about the DL equation. Bring our back to the quantum application. So I'm going to. Yeah, please.
00:27:37.925 - 00:27:44.425, Speaker B: You have proven the exponential decay in the P node. But in the end you have to do some interpolation to get.
00:27:45.285 - 00:28:07.419, Speaker A: Yeah, it's very important. That's a good question. It's very important that in the end you show that these two are actually equivalent, so. Oh, that's right. That's right. Then you know, finite Dimension is already equivalent, but we need to figure out like what's the concept. But usually you know, it's system side.
00:28:07.419 - 00:28:49.731, Speaker A: Okay, but in the body I'm going to talk about the Heisenberg picture again and just recall ourselves. This is the Hamiltonian part, this is the dissertative part. And what I want to just say is that if we just took this simple form, look at the Heisenberg picture, then we can realize that identity is always a fixed point and identity is full rank. And I'm just going to. Because this is a linear equation, so I can just simply choose our favorite inner product. Choose any of your theory in the product we're going to use gns, you can choose your favorite one. And then because this is the linear equation, so I can just subtract any observable with A which is the projection up to the A.
00:28:49.731 - 00:29:17.741, Speaker A: I talk about the difference or the fluctuation around the equilibrium. So I want to prove this fracture is exponential 10 into zero. If that's true and then I get the exponential estimate. So then the question is, let's imagine this is a linear bladder equation. Great. What if we do a naive energy masses just as what we did before? Well, that work. Well, the thing is that now I have this new inner product and I do this energy estimate for the new inner product.
00:29:17.741 - 00:29:44.845, Speaker A: Let's just on top of that simplify the situation even further. Let's imagine suppose sigma is actually maximum mixed state. Then the inner product is the same as the Huber Schmidt inner product that are simple to deal with. Just to imagine. We immediately realize that this part is a hermitian part is actually self adjoint in the hermitian inner product. In other words, we'll do the energy estimate. This part will disappear.
00:29:44.845 - 00:30:12.869, Speaker A: You will only see D. So this was just a simple illustration telling you that well, it's just not going to work. However you can. Well concretely you can imagine a scenario where suppose D is degenerate in the sense that it has many kernels. The kernel dimension is larger than one. So in this case D is actually degenerate. The energy methods will just tell you nothing, right? Because there's nothing.
00:30:12.869 - 00:30:37.615, Speaker A: So what we want to treat is precisely this scenario. We are not saying we can treat all the scenario, but is there a case? At least we can argue there's something going on. So here is a simple intuition of why it is there are some scenario it's going to work. I'm just going this is not approved, it's just intuition. I'm just going to look at my period, you know, Charterization, I'm a charter person. So I'm going to totalize it into T and D. Let's imagine we are doing the following.
00:30:37.615 - 00:31:01.947, Speaker A: So I'm going to say the kernel of D is. There are many the kernel, the dimension is bigger than one. And then the projection onto the kernel I will denote as T. So any arbitrary A can be decomposed into the part inside of the kernel, the part that is outside of the kernel. And then let's imagine what happens if I acting on exponential D here. It's not going to move anything. You will get.
00:31:01.947 - 00:31:37.975, Speaker A: If you have this part, you'll get expansion of D. Just imagine you do a Taylor expansion that anything other than disappear. So you will just nothing is going to move. However, what D is essentially doing is a dissipative operator. So we essentially hope that maybe D although does not move this part, maybe it's dissipative anything that is outside of the kernel, that is perpendicular to the kernel. So hopefully it damps anything there after that. Let's imagine what happens if I have expansion of H, that I'm going to only focus on this part, because this part is going to be exponential damping already.
00:31:37.975 - 00:32:30.221, Speaker A: What happens there is that we can do a tailoring simple Taylor expansion. And then what we will realize is suppose in a very simple scenario that suppose if php actually equal to 0, then this is actually the T is actually doing a stir of your A where it's pushing a P of A into something that is to the orthogonal part, right? So this is actually very important is because you are doing a series now going to the orthogonal part. Then next step D will decay it and you just keep doing it. You can imagine this is a precise scenario where the whole thing will still converge exponentially. So the question for us will just be how precisely we formulate that. So before that, here is a picture we also included in our manuscript. It's just to say, suppose I have a kernel of D where it includes this line, it has many kernels.
00:32:30.221 - 00:32:56.585, Speaker A: Then this, the D part is dissipative and the Hamiltonian part is like turning it around. So for any that thing that is inside of a kernel after Hamiltonian it was outside. Once it's outside, then the D part will dissipate a bit and then finally you converge to the global equilibrium. This is the idea. All right. Now a more concrete example. If I think my time is still okay, is that.
00:32:56.585 - 00:33:27.965, Speaker A: Suppose I just take this very simple example. I just want to give you a more. I guess it's already intuitive enough. But more intuitive is that this kernel D will be something that is diagonal. And what H will do is actually turn the diagonal into the off diagonal. So in this case you can usually check that PHP is actually equal to zero because diagonal of diagonal is no longer diagonal, so it's equal to zero. So and you can simply compute in this very simple case that D is decaying anything that is on the side of its kernel which is off diagonal part.
00:33:27.965 - 00:33:48.161, Speaker A: So good. Now I'm going to talk about the precise result of ours. And I already verbally described to you what are the condition I actually need here. I'm just going to repeat them. So first of all, I want this D It do not need to decay everything. I want it to decay anything that is not inside of the kernel of D. So that's why it's I minus T.
00:33:48.161 - 00:34:14.561, Speaker A: If I do not have this term, this will be coercive. But if I do have this term, this is a hypercursive. And the second condition will be proposed to H which says that I want H to stir the dynamics. This, you know, the kernel of D should not be, you know, equilibrium of H as well. Then nothing is moving. Then our previous intuition will just not work. So I do need H to stir what's going on inside of P.
00:34:14.561 - 00:34:46.655, Speaker A: And then I do have this condition of php equal to 0. So which will on top of that make sure the 30 is orthogonal direction of the kernel. And the final layer is just to make explicit of the mixing time. We do want to have concrete estimate of all the constants. This is just a condition to talk about what precisely the constants will be. You can imagine for a concrete example, suppose I have a Hamiltonian. Then these are D and H are associated with the, you know, the system size.
00:34:46.655 - 00:34:49.447, Speaker A: There will be polyn, which you will see some example later.
00:34:49.551 - 00:34:55.495, Speaker B: Please turn out in practice to be easier to estimate condition one and condition the lambdas for condition one and condition two.
00:34:55.575 - 00:35:26.865, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So for all the examples that I show you, it's very easy to estimate. But a certain question exists. Is there more interesting example that you pass? Yeah, yeah, that's a great question. That's the open question. Okay, so here is the theory. Suppose all the fault conditions are okay.
00:35:26.865 - 00:36:00.077, Speaker A: Then we can get exponential decay and expand explicitly calculate what are the Cs, what are the lambda? Because we do understand, you know, the constants are important. That's what essentially gave us the mixing time. These slides is pretty, I mean difficult to swallow. But the point is that the Mixing time estimate will have something look like this. This is due to duality Already know show the Heisenberg picture is decaying exponentially. Just the duality argument will get us here. And you can see the CM square which I said CM is associated with the system size which we'll see some concrete example later.
00:36:00.077 - 00:36:04.425, Speaker A: And this is the format of what we have. Please go backwards. Sure.
00:36:05.925 - 00:36:10.705, Speaker B: Oh, this condition is really necessary or we can relax it.
00:36:11.525 - 00:36:39.665, Speaker A: So I have it here so that I know explicitly what to put inside of these constants. Yeah, so. Well, I mean. Well, because if we imagine we're just doing K local Hamiltonian everything is. We are not dealing with our boundary operator at this moment. So everything is going to be bounded. Condition three is just quantify precisely or quantitatively what is the bound so that I can tell you what precisely they are in this estimate.
00:36:39.665 - 00:37:07.165, Speaker A: We currently work with three and that's the first future work that is to relax that we are working on it. Okay. Right. You can imagine it shouldn't be necessary. Right. That's only the final step. Yeah, yeah, that's only the duality argument has nothing to do with hypercursivity itself.
00:37:07.165 - 00:37:30.783, Speaker A: To get here. Yeah, to get here. That's right. Okay, so just several remarks. First of all the I didn't assume the whole lean body have detailed balance as in any of the conditions. Second, as you can see data example they actually do not. And another thing is the take home message is that if you have the right Hamiltonian it actually enhances mixing.
00:37:30.783 - 00:38:06.641, Speaker A: It's because the way that it's playing around now let me just show you some of the example. The first example is very simple, it's a qubit and I'm just going to look at this Hamiltonian look at this jump operators which are not necessary interesting or physically exciting. But this is what we can look at. And then all of the condition can be very easily analyzed and particularly you can see that the unique fixed point is this guy. And then you can just simply. Well, it's very simple calculation to check all of our three conditions and correspondingly we can produce you amazing time. So this is example number one.
00:38:06.641 - 00:38:38.065, Speaker A: Then the question would be what about embody Hamiltonians and body examples. So for these I will show you three embody examples as I promised you. So in this part I will just look at a very simple polynoise which is the defacing noise. We know that the defacing noise the kernels are spanned by the z strings. It's also very easy to check because it's poly channels you pretty much know everything. The D part is 2 gamma. Let's look at the transverse field Ising model.
00:38:38.065 - 00:39:01.445, Speaker A: I have a condition of D which I already checked. I have a condition of H. Okay, just work a little bit and have a condition of cm. And then that's relative is the system slice. What about the condition 3 which is PHP data? Back to Lexington's question. Then let's imagine for this concrete example the kernel is Z string. So I take Z string, I want the php equal to 0, I take something from the Z string and I commute with it.
00:39:01.445 - 00:39:35.119, Speaker A: So Z will just disappear and I commute with Y. So it's no longer inside of any of no longer inside of a kernel because it's not Z string. So you can easily check that condition here. Um, so the conclusion is that you can easily check all the conditions and the missing time they'll give you some polynomial missing. This was as what I promised before and this CM is associated with the system set. So similarly you can also do it in the Heisenberg picture and there are similar conditions we can check which you can find into Yarrow manuscript. And now just to say a little bit about what about quantum work.
00:39:35.119 - 00:40:13.511, Speaker A: And then here is a another example where I just look at a deregular kinetic graph where I say that okay, the graph have a special gap which is delta. And then we can look at the simple defacing noise. And again this is another example where all the condition can be very easily checked. And in the end you also have polynomial. So I'm not saying all, I mean these are. I'm just trying to construct to you some of the interesting examples to show you that this framework actually works. Oh, the sigma in this particular case is actually maximum mixtape.
00:40:13.511 - 00:40:58.651, Speaker A: So that's not very exciting. But these are some examples where we can show the exponential decay rate. So now just to say a little bit about the proving ideas. The proving idea is actually you can already tell from the simple ode case is that recall we said, okay, I want to do an energy estimate map methods and once we do the regular energy estimation methods, the symmetric part about the anti self drawing part will disappear. You will just not see its contribution that you are, well, it just will not work. So the idea will just be we want to work with a twisted norm. So how to come up with a twisted norm? So the point is we can come up with a twisted norm which is defined in the following way.
00:40:58.651 - 00:41:27.555, Speaker A: Where this curly A is auxiliary operators, where we can define and there's some expression of it, you just work with it you can prove everything. And the point is, the point is this new twisted norm is actually equivalent to the original norm. So that's data back to Dean's question. If I have a P norm and I can make it equivalent. Thank you. In fact, inside of this estimate you will realize condition four is not exactly in that form. All we need is in this form.
00:41:27.555 - 00:41:55.747, Speaker A: But since we can show that Kerdi A is a bonding operator, you can just replace it with this as a. As a simpler form. But this is more relaxed condition. If you can check that, that will also be great. So I guess I can conclude. So today I talk about the framework to estimating mixing time of the blood in system which we treated H and D sort of in a separate fashion. But we do need to check, you know, php equal to 0 which tell you some of the correlation between the two.
00:41:55.747 - 00:42:35.883, Speaker A: And then it do not need to have a special gap of the full in bloody and which is typical the starting point and we do not require it to have a detailed balance. And so the open questions which was asked is can we relax the condition php equal to 0? That's what we are working on. And then there are various different framework. As I said, hypercursivity is this really rich mathematical field. There are so many genius has been working on it. There are various different opportunities as I believe that we can look at and see whether there's any quantum applications quantum analog into. And this is a reference and finally let me just advertise, you know Duke, I believe Duke math.
00:42:35.883 - 00:43:01.695, Speaker A: Now we have a very specialized great concentration in quantum computing and quantum information. These three folks are the authors of this paper. We also have Robert C. Who needs no introduction and Harry Fister, who organized the last semester's error correction law program assignments. So if you have any talent, you know, students or maybe potential postdoc candidates, please consider send them to us. Thank you very much.
00:43:06.755 - 00:43:28.013, Speaker B: Thanks a lot Dee for an amazing talk. We've got time for some questions. Nice talk. I wanted to ask if you have any examples where you can prove mixing time bounds for a Gibb state at non infinite temperatures.
00:43:28.109 - 00:43:37.655, Speaker A: That's a great question. We don't currently. I guess that's one of the reasons why we come to this conference. Hope to talk to you. Yeah, right.
00:43:37.695 - 00:43:38.063, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:43:38.119 - 00:43:39.047, Speaker A: Yeah, thank you.
00:43:39.191 - 00:43:41.995, Speaker B: Quick question. Is that related to the PHP thing?
00:43:42.775 - 00:43:50.595, Speaker A: That I'm not sure that. I'm not sure that. I don't think so. That I don't think so.
00:43:53.095 - 00:44:03.473, Speaker B: Somewhat relatedly, I want to ask are there any explicit examples where it's hard to estimate the gap of the limb audience but it's easy to estimate mixing time using your method.
00:44:03.599 - 00:44:04.781, Speaker A: All the example I gave you.
00:44:04.813 - 00:44:05.453, Speaker B: Oh, they're all.
00:44:05.509 - 00:44:06.145, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:44:08.965 - 00:44:26.349, Speaker B: Any other questions? Okay, if not. I've got one question. So I. I'm kind of curious. Does all of this transfer over straightforwardly to the case where you have time dependence or. Or even even more interestingly stochastic terms?
00:44:26.437 - 00:44:54.301, Speaker A: Yeah, great question. So for time dependence we can still cook up the up. No functional. But I want to say for time dependence problem the special gap is really not going to tell us anything about the actual dynamics. If we just think about very simple ode we can cook up example, you know, two by two diagonal is negative one, negative one off diagonal let's say E to the T. And then you know, the spectrum is all decaying. But you can simply solve this different equation which tell you there is some unstable exponential growing mode.
00:44:54.301 - 00:45:07.775, Speaker A: So generally you know, special gap is not going to be a relevant concept to think about general time dependent case. But if you can prove energy methods still work, that's. You can, you can still do something about it. Thank you.
00:45:08.155 - 00:45:18.975, Speaker B: All right, any other further questions? How sharp is this technique for hyperconceivity compared to other proofs techniques for hypercursivity for spectrum gap?
00:45:19.395 - 00:45:21.679, Speaker A: You mean how sharp?
00:45:21.847 - 00:45:26.759, Speaker B: Well, well, I mean has worked on like time space.
00:45:26.927 - 00:45:32.391, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. So. Yeah, you will hear about it tomorrow. Yeah, okay.
00:45:32.503 - 00:45:37.327, Speaker B: But I mean maybe which, which method it will give you better since I don't.
00:45:37.431 - 00:46:05.297, Speaker A: Yeah. Actually so. So I think what you will hear from Bowman's work tomorrow is that suppose I'm. I have Alpha in front of my Hamiltonian part and I have Gamma in front of my dissipative part. Then I ask myself for example what is the best Alpha and Gamma that I can tune so that the optimal the rate is better but the cons, the conditions are same. Just that the. I can play around with finding the best, you know, the Hamiltonian part so that it dissipates faster.
00:46:05.297 - 00:46:12.569, Speaker A: Yeah, that's the. Yeah, they do have a work on it. Yeah. Great. Yeah.
00:46:12.617 - 00:46:19.757, Speaker B: How about. How about you guys connect your. The coffee break. So thank D one more time.
00:46:19.901 - 00:46:20.245, Speaker A: Thank you.
