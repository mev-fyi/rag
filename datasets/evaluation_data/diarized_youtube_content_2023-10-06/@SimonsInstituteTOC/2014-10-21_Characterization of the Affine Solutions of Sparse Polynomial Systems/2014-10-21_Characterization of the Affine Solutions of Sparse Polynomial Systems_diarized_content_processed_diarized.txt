00:00:00.960 - 00:01:11.828, Speaker A: Thank you for having me. Well, this talk is based on some showing work with Gabriela Geronimo and Juan Xavier. And up to now my research has been mainly focused on the development of theoretical results and efficient algorithms to be able to describe the common set of zeros of a system of n polynomials in n variables. And because of the applications that there are a lot of applications that have relatively equations that describe them with relatively few monomials. And because we are looking for efficient algorithms, is that there's some interest in the sparse polynomial systems. These systems are systems where the monomials that have coefficients that are non zero are fixed, are preset, and to this fixed set of monomials that we are going to represent by their exponents, we're going to call supports and use this notation here. A one to am my algorithms are not numerical ones, but symbolic ones.
00:01:11.828 - 00:02:56.982, Speaker A: This means that we're going to describe the variety by using geometric resolutions, parameterizations by means of these geometric resolutions. And in the zero dimensional case, when we have a variety that is definable over the rationals, if we have a linear form that sends different points to different values, then a geometric resolution is going to parameterize the variety using this polynomial here, this univariate polynomial, and a set of polynomials v one to vn, that they are chosen such that if we had the roots q and we evaluate them in this vector here, we recover the variety v. This definition can also be extended to the equidimensional case. If we have a variety, an equidimensional variety of the dimension r, and for each irreducible component we have a free maximal set of variables such that for each irreducible component this condition holds. Then we can get again to go to the zero dimensional situation by inverting that set of maximal free variables. My algorithms are also probabilistic in the sense that they make some random choices of interiors that if we chose them outside the static clause proper set, allow us to get a correct result. Something to be said before I start.
00:02:56.982 - 00:04:19.536, Speaker A: A difference between the case, the generic square sparse case and the generic squares dense case is that if we had as many polynomials as variables, and with fixed degrees, and every possible monomial that can appear has a coefficient, then the common set of zero is finite. But if we fix the monomials that can appear, then we can have components of positive dimension. For example, with this system here, if we factor the system looking at which of these variables can be made zero, we obtain five irreducible components, and only one of them is a point. So we are interested in knowing when we're going to be able to find components of positive dimension in coordinate linear spaces and of which dimension these components are going to be. A question to ask beforehand is in which parameters one wants to write. The complexity of the algorithms. A combinatorial invariant that is expected to appear is the degree of a variety, somebody that I think everybody knows.
00:04:19.536 - 00:04:56.618, Speaker A: But just in case, for an irreducible variety, the definition is the maximal amount of points in the intersection of the variety with as many hyperplanes as the dimension, as long as these points are finite and this number is achieved in the generic hyperplanes and for arbitrary varieties. The definition of degree that I'm going to be using in this lecture is the sum of all degrees of each and every one of the irreducible components of the variety. So.
00:04:56.746 - 00:04:58.574, Speaker B: So even if they're different dimensions?
00:04:58.874 - 00:06:22.664, Speaker A: Yes, even if. Okay, I'm going to use this notation a lot. I'm going to call this way to the variety defined by the union of every irreducible component of the variety defined by a system f that has at least one point with all non zero coordinates. That is the same thing as the Tsaritsky closure of the set of all zeros of the system with all non zero coordinates. So using that notation then, for a generic system with at most polygenetic system, either that variety is going to be empty, or in the case when the amount of polynomials is less or equal to the amount of variables. And when this condition here holds, then that variety is going to be an equidimensional variety of the dimension that one expects, the amount of variables minus the amount of polynomials and degree, this mixed volume, where these are supports of the system, and this is the simplex repeated n minus m times, that would be the support of the linear forms that one is going to be using. For example, obtain the degree.
00:06:22.664 - 00:07:44.810, Speaker A: And we can use this to give a probabilistic algorithm that generalize an algorithm for from Geronimo, Matera, Solano and Weinstein from 2009. That algorithm is for square systems. In this case, for a system with at most as many polynomials as variables, we can compute a geometric resolution of the variety that I just defined with a complexity that, disregarding logarithmic factors, is polynomial in those combinatorial invariants. There, the amount of variables, the amount of points in the supports, the degree of the variety, this other mixed volume here, and a combinatorial invariant that depends on fine mixed subdivision that we include in the input. There are several algorithms that compute this kind of subdivision, such as the one from Misutani, Takeda and Kohima from 2007. But they work really efficiently in practice. But they don't have an explicit computation of their complexity and that's why we don't include them in the estimation.
00:07:45.002 - 00:07:45.690, Speaker C: What is the number?
00:07:45.722 - 00:07:48.410, Speaker D: Is that the number of excels or what is that number?
00:07:48.602 - 00:08:09.114, Speaker A: This number actually is going to be the maximum of the norms of the primitive interior normal of all the mixed cells. Yes. And actually this other mixed volume comes from that subdivision.
00:08:12.654 - 00:08:14.954, Speaker B: Is this mixed subdivision.
00:08:16.494 - 00:08:17.102, Speaker A: Sorry.
00:08:17.198 - 00:08:18.302, Speaker B: So part of your input to the.
00:08:18.318 - 00:08:19.862, Speaker A: Algorithm is part of the.
00:08:19.918 - 00:08:21.898, Speaker B: Yes, but also this mixed up division.
00:08:21.946 - 00:09:20.784, Speaker A: Exactly, yes. And the basic idea is to take the variety, code it with n minus m generic linear forms. We then obtain finite points that we find a geometric resolution of those points using the algorithm from shenanigan material, solenoid and Weinstein that I was saying before. And then we lift those points to obtain the geometric resolution of this variety using a Newton Hansel lifting with precision the degree of the variety. So now that we have this algorithm, the idea is to be able to reduce the description of every component of the variety to that algorithm that I was just talking about. For that I'm going to need some notation. This projection you can forget after this slide, but the rest are going to be appearing a lot.
00:09:20.784 - 00:11:35.584, Speaker A: So f I is going to be the system that we obtain by evaluating in zero the coordinates index by I and discarding the polynomials that vanish completely. Ji is the set of index of the polynomials that did not vanish. PI is the projection to the coordinates not in I, and the last one is the set of supports of the system that can also be obtained by projecting with PI the supports of the original system that are indexed by j I. So if we have, the first result is that if we have an irreducible component of the variety defined by f, and we define this set I w as the set of all coordinates where all the points in w have zero coordinates. Then the dimension of w can be written using that iw and projecting the points projecting w with p sub iw is not only a set of zeros of this system, but it's an irreducible component of this variety that has at least one point with all non zero coordinates. Using this and using the first lemma that allow us to say that f I is going to have at least 10 with all non zero coordinates if and only if we have that first condition, that blue condition on the supports, and using that for every reducible component of the tsarisci closure of all zeros with all non zero coordinates of fi and adding zeros in the coordinates indexed by I, then that is an irreducible component of the variety defined by f. If and only if we have this second blue condition on the supports.
00:11:35.584 - 00:13:48.124, Speaker A: Those two blue conditions are only combinatorial, they are only on the supports. So they allow us to give a combinatorial description of the variety, description that is going to be the union of all eyes that fill these two blue conditions of adding zeros to these kind of varieties that we knew how to compute from the previous algorithm, and also a combinatorial expression for the degree as a sum over the same set I that fulfill those two blue conditions of the degrees of these varieties here. So, using this, if we have a system in sparse representation with a fixed set of supports, first we find the second blue condition, and this other condition here that is weaker than the first one, but is easier to find and is also necessary then for every one of the sets I that fill us to those conditions, we found the geometric resolution of this variety. And in doing that we use that preprocessing that I was mentioning before, that in particular allow us to define, decide if this condition that I was mentioning before, the first one, is going to be true or not, because that first condition is equivalent to the mixed volume of the set of supports of this variety here. This system here completed with simplices being zero or not being zero. So, adding zero to the coordinates, to the corresponding coordinates and grouping by dimensions, we have a geometric resolution that describes each of the key dimensional components of the variety defined by f. And this algorithm is a probabilistic algorithm because of this step here.
00:13:48.124 - 00:14:12.580, Speaker A: And it's going to have a complexity that this term is written in combinatorial invariants similar as the ones from before. But the first one, unfortunately, is exponential and cannot be disregarded because we can have an exponential amount of irreducible components, for example.
00:14:12.652 - 00:14:13.884, Speaker B: So what's known here is the n.
00:14:13.924 - 00:14:18.806, Speaker A: Two to the n, n to the n. Yes, that's what we're having for.
00:14:18.830 - 00:14:19.394, Speaker B: Yes.
00:14:22.014 - 00:15:44.794, Speaker A: And as I was saying, if we look at this example, if for every two variables I choose one to make zero, one to make zero, and so on, then there's two to the n ways to do that. And that gives us two to the n components that they are not included in components of bigger dimension. So actually we can have, as I was saying, an exponential amount of components. The good news is that for systems such as this one, where all the supports are the same, we could present these kind of systems are called unmixed and we could present a new reformulation of our characterization using that. If this is the equidimensional component of the variety defined by f, then you are going to be able to write it as the union over all ista to fill these conditions here of these linear spaces. And for these kind of conditions, we did get an algorithm to compute them in a polynomial time. So that gives us an algorithm to compute this kind of decomposition in a polynomial time.
00:15:47.774 - 00:15:55.434, Speaker B: So it's polynomial because you don't have to look at, because all the a's are the same, you just look at one of them, is that it?
00:15:56.774 - 00:17:54.484, Speaker A: Not because it's kind of like technical, but it was because we could, in each state step, we could limit the amount of, we were adding like one polynomial at a time. And in each step we had a bound for the amount of components that could appear in it was the degree, and they were in each step we sum these things, and at the end it was n times the degree, and something else. So, for the non generical case, something that is worth mentioning is that unlike what happened with isolated roots, where the, in the generic, for a generic system with fixed supports, the amount of isolated roots is a superior boundary for the amount of roots. For an arbitrary system with the same amount of, with the same supports, that does not happen with the degree. The degree of an arbitrary variety with fixed supports can be larger than the degree of a generic system with the same set of supports. So we need a bound for the degree. In 2001, Teresa Pardo Ensombra presented this bound here for n polynomials in n variables, and just more recently for the case of the square case, when we have n polynomials in n variables, we could improve a little that bound, because this bound, this new one, it does not involve a union of the supports, but it's only four square systems.
00:17:54.484 - 00:19:15.474, Speaker A: And this bound is important to us because it's going to appear in the complexity of the algorithms. The idea we heard this morning about witness set from the idea from Somerset and Guampla, okay, about using sets of witness points to represent the irreducible or undimensional components of varieties. For the non generic case, the best that we could do was to find geometric resolution of what is called a witness point. It's superset. This is a set of points that contains a set of witness points, but also can contain some points in components of bigger dimension. The basic idea is that if we have, if we add generic linear forms to our system, then it is known that every time I say it is known, I think that I'm reading too much Game of Thrones. Okay.
00:19:15.474 - 00:21:32.704, Speaker A: It is known that if we take generic linear combinations and generic linear combinations of these polynomials, and in particular, if we take this kind of generic linear combinations, where only the generic coefficients that we're going to be using are these ones, then all the isolated zeros of this system are also isolated zeros of this system here. So using that having system in sparse representation with fixed supports and the mix cells in a fine mix subdivision of the extended supports. Now, not only the supports, at first we find the geometric resolution of the zeros of a system with these extended supports, a generic system with these supports. Then we choose generic linear forms and use them to construct these systems here. And from the zeros from the original system j, we use homotopic deformation to find a geometric resolution of a finite set of points that contain all isolated zeros of this system. And clearing that from all the points that are not in the variety defined by f, we obtain a family of geometric resolutions that are geometric resolution of finite set of points containing witness set points of every dimensional component of the variety defined by S. And this algorithm is also probabilistic and has a complexity that is polynomial in the amount of variables, the amount of points in the extended supports, the degree of the maximum degree of the polynomials that hadn't appeared before, and in particular in the degree in the bound for the degree of the variety that I was presenting before.
00:21:32.704 - 00:21:35.944, Speaker A: And that is all. Thank you very much.
00:21:42.164 - 00:21:43.544, Speaker B: Are there any questions?
00:21:44.324 - 00:21:54.604, Speaker D: Just wondering if, like what's the range that you can practically compute? Like if I give you a system, 48 variables and 48 equations, could you solve it?
00:21:58.504 - 00:22:44.964, Speaker A: Well, the good thing about these kind of algorithms is that the complexity is in regards to the mixed volume. So if the mixed volume is small, if you have, for example, supports that are kind of like, I don't know, something like this, then maybe your degree will be really big. But the mixed volume is going to be really small. So the complexity is going to be small. But the bad news is that I'm learning to program right now. I haven't completely learned yet, so I haven't been able to write my algorithms in a computer. So I don't know which.
00:22:44.964 - 00:22:51.884, Speaker A: How much time do they take? I can give you a theoretical description of the complexity.
00:22:53.424 - 00:23:05.840, Speaker B: It's two different tasks to devise an algorithm and then implement it. You ever try to work on both? You like the fact that they're counted twice? Yes, please.
00:23:05.992 - 00:23:13.414, Speaker C: Another question. Always taking the union of the AI's with Delta.
00:23:14.234 - 00:23:21.122, Speaker A: Yes. Unit simplex for the non channel case. Yes, CN. Sorry.
00:23:21.218 - 00:23:26.410, Speaker C: Because you are looking for roots in CN, not C star.
00:23:26.482 - 00:23:40.574, Speaker A: N. No, that has. That was. Yes, because we are using these polynomials here. So the support of these polynomials is the support of every polynomial and simplex.
00:23:41.714 - 00:23:58.774, Speaker C: So you don't gain, you will not gain better complexity by looking only for roots with non zero coordinates and maybe using a. Fine.
00:24:05.254 - 00:24:08.234, Speaker B: Any other questions? Oh, I'm sorry. Yes, please.
00:24:08.574 - 00:24:14.486, Speaker D: So with respect to this algorithm, what is the difference with the algorithm of jurisdiction?
00:24:14.550 - 00:24:15.994, Speaker A: I can't hear you. Sorry.
00:24:20.294 - 00:24:39.346, Speaker D: What is the difference between the algorithm on this slide and the one by Gregoire for computing geometric resolutions in the case of sequences? This one is more expensive. I mean I think this one takes into account the nuclear polytopes. Isn't that the difference?
00:24:39.490 - 00:24:48.410, Speaker A: I think so, yes. I think so.
00:24:48.482 - 00:25:06.684, Speaker D: What about the, I mean the juice algorithm? The complexity would be depending on the number of solutions which is which you can bound like that, as well as the degree of intermediate varieties which you could probably hope to bound like that. So wouldn't you be able to get the same kind of results at the end with diagonal.
00:25:11.264 - 00:25:17.364, Speaker A: I'm going to have to figure. Maybe we can talk about it later.
00:25:19.584 - 00:25:23.354, Speaker B: Are there any other questions? Okay, what's that?
