00:00:00.600 - 00:01:20.604, Speaker A: So, yeah, so I'm going to talk to you about network variation. And I guess, you know, my group's worked on analyzing protein interaction networks for a long time, and we've done a lot of work at kind of like, graph theoretic methods for analyzing networks, but we also do a lot of work thinking about predicting interactions as well. And so today, I really wanted to focus specifically on the question of trying to assess computationally, to what extent do protein interactions and networks vary across organisms and individuals. So, in yesterday's panel discussion, we talked a lot about whether thinking about protein interactions in the cell, whether it made sense to think about them with this nice graph interpretation, and I think it does. But when you want to answer questions about protein interaction variation or a network variation, I think the task is actually more difficult than the opposite question of asking whether interactions are conserved or network modules are conserved. And a lot of that has to do, of course, with what's been measured and the noise in the measurements. And so we know that we have many interactions that haven't been observed, but this could be because they've never been measured, or this could be because they're errors in the experimentation.
00:01:20.604 - 00:02:14.214, Speaker A: And so we're thinking about how to address this question with the data we have. And so we're going to think about protein interactions, but we're going to look at them a little bit more closely. And in my group, we do a lot of work relating to protein structure. And so we're going to think about some of these protein interactions with respect to the underlying structural interface that makes these interactions possible. And so I'm going to try to tell you two stories relating to network variation, one relating to transcriptional regulatory network variation, and the other relating to variation across individuals. So let me start with telling you about variation of regulatory networks across organisms. And this is joint work with Shilpa Nadampali, a graduate student in my group who came from Tufts, well represented here, as well as Anton Persikoff, who's been in my group for a while as a research fellow.
00:02:14.214 - 00:03:28.904, Speaker A: So, actually, we saw in the first talk today that a lot of the changes that we see between organisms are thought to be due to changes in gene regulatory networks. And so it was observed a long time ago that if you look at the protein coding regions between chimp and human, that they're very similar, so greater than 99% identical. And yet we'd like to think that we're a little bit different from chimps. And so it was proposed that it's not differences in protein coding regions that are responsible for these phenotypic differences. But instead, it's changes in networks and in particular, gene regulatory networks. And this has been verified experimentally in various model systems, many of them in fly, actually, where they've shown what happens when you change pieces of regulatory networks and you see differences in morphology or pigmentation or other such things. So how might transcriptional regulatory networks change? So we all know the basic paradigm of transcription factors binding sites and then regulating genes.
00:03:28.904 - 00:04:11.594, Speaker A: So they could change by mutations in the regulatory DNA themselves. So this is the piece of DNA that this protein is binding, and maybe one of these nucleotides changes. And as a result of that, you can lose transcription factor interactions, or you can get transcription factor substitutions, or you can get other transcription factors that bind there. But the other alternative is that you can have mutations in the proteins themselves, in the transcription factors themselves. And so the conventional wisdom, though, has been that this is highly detrimental, that there are many pleiotropic effects. And for this. So, as an example, you have a transcription factor.
00:04:11.594 - 00:05:14.874, Speaker A: It regulates all of these genes. If there's a change in this transcription factor itself, then you're potentially affecting the regulation of many downstream genes. And so for this reason, it's thought that mutations in transcription factors are largely limited to the cases where transcription factors have duplicated, and that if you look at transcription factors across organisms and focus on orthologs, because of pleiotropic effects, you are going to tend not to see mutations within them. So there are cases where people have looked at what happens or have seen what happens when you have mutations in transcription factors themselves. And so there are many examples that are associated with disease, and here are three examples. So, relating to mutation and this transcription factor causes limb deformation. Mutation in this transcription factor causes these eye defects, and mutations in this transcription factor causes defects in growth.
00:05:14.874 - 00:06:27.022, Speaker A: But those are just case studies, and we'd like to do this a little bit more systematically. So, you know, we noticed, you know, this is consistent with the idea that you have these huge effects that are really detrimental, but maybe we noticed these changes in transcription factors because they're so severe and in this case, causing disease. And so we were interested in this broader question, in trying to do it kind of at a larger scale, which was, do transcription factors or mutations within them contribute to regulatory network rewiring? If so, how prevalent is this? And you could think about trying to do this experimentally. And I wanted to say that there are limitations of experimental approaches. So, for example, to do this, we need to look, and we want to do it kind of genomically, we would need to look at many transcription factors and we need to look across many organisms. So you can say, well, you know, actually encode and MoD encode has done this. But really, the existing experimental data is from a very large set of diverse model organisms where the homologous relationships between these transcription factors are actually hard to pin down.
00:06:27.022 - 00:07:41.794, Speaker A: Are they orthologs? Are they duplications? Is it something else? And of course, if you wanted to do this, do it across more organisms, you have issues with scalability. And so our idea was to try to do this computationally and to develop this computational pipeline to evaluate changes in transcription factors which may lead to regulatory network rewiring. And so, in the general case, this seems like a very hard thing to try to do. But my group has been, I guess, obsessed with one particular class of transcription factors for probably more than a decade. And so one thing, as part of many other things that we do, is we study cis two hystu zinc finger transcription factors. And so these are the largest class of DNA binding domains in human, and they have this unique, fairly conserved, modular structure where this alpha helix is what binds in the major groove of DNA. And it's easy to kind of look at this alpha helix, look at the sequence that underlies these alpha helices across many transcription factors, and figure out the positions of the residues with respect to how they bind DNA.
00:07:41.794 - 00:08:27.884, Speaker A: If you look at a sequence logo of the cis two histo zinc finger domain, you can say, ah, this position is minus one. It's right before the start of this, this helix. It's a nice conserved domain. And further, through lots of work over decades, people have an idea of what parts of the alpha helix are actually responsible for interacting with DNA and largely driving specificity. So these are unlikely to be the only things that drive specificity, but these are known to be important. So if you look at a helix and here's one helix, there are four positions called the minus one, two, three and six that largely interact with DNA. And you can see that, in fact, most proteins have more than one of these domains.
00:08:27.884 - 00:09:32.808, Speaker A: They don't need to, but they often have more than one of these domains, and they essentially bind these triplets with maybe a fourth contact of DNA. And so, from the point of view of probing variation in these types of transcription factors, we know that mutations in these lightning bolt positions are likely to affect binding specificity. Okay, so I'll just say that previously, people have looked at the variation due in regulatory networks due to cis two, his two zinc fingers, but they've largely focused on paralogous transcription factors. And so that's consistent. And they found variation that's consistent with the paradigm I set up to begin with, which is you can have variation in transcription factors, but in the case of duplication, and still kind of leaving this idea that if you look at orthologous transcription factors, that you would have these pleiotropic, potentially very damaging effects. All right, so we're going to limit ourselves. We're going to try to look at variation, and we're going to do it by focusing on the cis, two hist, two zinc finger.
00:09:32.808 - 00:10:06.346, Speaker A: And I'd like to say that I think this is a great system to look at, not just because of the structural reasons I told you about and how well defined they are, but really, they are the largest class of transcription factors in metazoans. So if you look at human, almost half of the transcription factors in human are cis two hysteres. So we're going to be looking actually at a significant fraction of transcriptional regulatory networks. So here's the bar for zinc fingers. And here's the other class of transcription factors in humans.
00:10:06.450 - 00:10:10.746, Speaker B: Is this the number of specific proteins in all organisms?
00:10:10.850 - 00:10:21.214, Speaker A: This is just in human. This one's human. And so this is. I'm actually going to talk about fly proteins. And so this type of picture is also true. It's pretty consistent for metazoans in general.
00:10:23.834 - 00:10:29.306, Speaker C: When you have c, two h, two thin fingers, how they have a lot of fingers, right?
00:10:29.370 - 00:10:29.842, Speaker D: Yep.
00:10:29.938 - 00:10:31.866, Speaker C: Are all the fingers the same kind?
00:10:31.970 - 00:10:52.104, Speaker A: No. We'll talk about that in a second. Okay. So I'll come back and answer that in a little while, and then you can ask the question again if I don't answer it. Okay. So I want to say that these domains have been studied extensively. So, for example, Marcus spoke, and I don't know if he showed this picture or not when he gave us talk, and he's nodding his head no.
00:10:52.104 - 00:11:57.060, Speaker A: So Marcus, who's now a faculty member at NYU, he previously was at Princeton, which was awesome. And one of the things that he did was he tried to see, he looked at, as I said, each domain binds, essentially, this triplet of DNA. And he looked over all 64 possible triplets and built these huge protein libraries and used his bacterial one hybrid system to assay which proteins could bind each of these 64 triplets. And he created this massive data set where he ended up looking at greater than 160,000 interfaces, corresponding to 103,000 helices. And just if you look to see how many are distinct with these four positions that are important for specificity, he was looking at more than 18,000 interfaces, corresponding to more than 8000 helices. And so this data set was an order of magnitude larger than all previous datasets combined. And so we have really a lot of information about zinc finger determinants for specificity.
00:11:57.060 - 00:12:33.634, Speaker A: And what this has meant for me and mind group over the years is that you can take a transcription factor that contains these cis, two hist, two zinc finger domains. Like zpingaxis. You have more than one. So there are three domains here. You can identify them, you can use knowledge about the structure, you can use the type of data that Marcus has generated, you could use data that existed other than that from before. And we have, over the years, developed these methods to try to de novo predict the DNA binding specificity of these proteins. And so these methods don't work perfectly by any stretch of the imagination.
00:12:33.634 - 00:13:37.322, Speaker A: But many people have gone on to use our tool to do some pretty interesting biology, for example, implicating proteins involved in recombination as well as in regulation of retro elements. Okay, so we now have a system that we can use to really probe regulatory network variation, and that's the cis, two hist, two zinc fingers. And our overall outline is we're going to uncover and focus on one to one orthologous cyst, two hyst, two zinc fingers across closely related species. We're going to see whether there's any variation, and if so, we're going to characterize how much. We're going to really focus on the issue of functional constraint. So say these changes occur, how does it potentially affect the protein? And then, because we know things about the specificity of these transcription factors, we're going to determine whether the variation that we observe results in variation in predictive specificities as well. So, as I mentioned, we actually did this work not in human, but in fly.
00:13:37.322 - 00:14:19.850, Speaker A: And so there are at least twelve fully sequenced fly genomes, including the model organism, Drosophila melanogaster. And these organisms last shared an ancestor 50 million years ago. These flies are fairly diverse. You can see they vary a lot in terms of size, as well as in pigmentation and as well in things that they eat and other things like that. So it's a good system to look at. So the first thing we did was we identified all of these cis, two hist, two zinc fingers across all of these flies. As I said, these are the largest class of transcription factors in metazoans.
00:14:19.850 - 00:14:57.142, Speaker A: And so we found hundreds of genes that contain cystohistu zinc finger domains. As Xi Ping asked about that, these domains can occur in tandem across the sequence. For reasons that hopefully become apparent soon. We actually did our analysis focused on genes that had more than one domain. And then we characterize orthologous relationships between these proteins, all of them in each organism with reference to melanogaster. And so we asked how many of the, for example, D. Sechelia zinc finger genes had a one to one ortholog in Drosophil melanogaster.
00:14:57.142 - 00:15:43.716, Speaker A: So that was 250 in this case. And this corresponds to a large number of total zinc finger domains. So we're going to do this analysis of regulatory network variation, really at a fairly large scale. So covering 40% or so of the transcription factors and covering a numerous number of domains as well. So, zinc finger domains, if you look at a protein sequence, you typically have many of them. And one thing that makes this a little bit difficult to work on is that zinc fingers are actually multifunctional. So not all of them bind DNA, but when they bind DNA, they tend to have a particular relationship with respect to each other and that they have a particular kind of distance along the protein sequence.
00:15:43.716 - 00:16:53.044, Speaker A: And we'll refer to this as being canonically linked. And so there are kind of more precise definitions than that, but this is the level at which I'll stay in for now. And so these canonically linked domains, so, domains that occur sequentially in a particular format with respect to each other, are more likely to be DNA binding. Okay, so we looked at these thousands of domains and we asked how much variation do we see in these four positions that are responsible for DNA binding specificity? And so what you see here is all the flies kind of ordered with evolutionary distance from melanogaster. Melanogaster. And if you look at all the domains, we can see that large fractions of them vary in one of these four DNA contacting residues that affect DNA binding specificity. And so when you get to the flies that are furthest away from the language and the ones that we studied, about a third of the domains vary in one of these four positions and thus could affect DNA binding specificity.
00:16:53.044 - 00:17:15.296, Speaker A: Some of these domains may not bind DNA. So we restricted this into kind of two groups. We split this up into those that are canonically linked, so they have that nearby domain and those that are non canonically linked and thought maybe they don't bind DNA or maybe are less likely to bind DNA. And so even just focusing on canonically linked domains, you can see that a large fraction of them actually vary. Yeah.
00:17:15.360 - 00:17:17.896, Speaker E: Did you say heard about the quality ascertainment?
00:17:18.080 - 00:17:51.384, Speaker A: Yeah, we used several different sources of orthologs, like orthological orthomcl or, you know, in paranoia, different ones. And then we also did reconciliation. So we were really careful to make sure to exclude things that had duplications with them. Did we? No. So we actually studied that separately. I'm just not showing that data. So there's also gain and loss of domains.
00:17:51.384 - 00:18:15.146, Speaker A: However, in fact, at least for flies, that's much less common than actually seeing variation in the residues themselves. So this is the dominant type of change we see. We also see gain and losses. There are, of course, issues with genome quality. So some of the genomes that are kind of crummy, you might see domain losses more frequently in the HCC outliers.
00:18:15.210 - 00:18:17.914, Speaker E: This statistic is at the level of protein, not at the level of.
00:18:18.074 - 00:19:18.720, Speaker A: This is actually at the level of domains. But I want to say that this corresponds to so 70% of the melanogaster zinc finger transcription factors have a domain that shows some variation and this corresponds overall. The ones that do vary correspond overall to about a quarter of Drosophila melanogaster transcription factors. Okay? So we would say that actually there's extensive divergence in one to one orthologs. Okay? So there are these changes, but there's this issue that maybe not all domains bind DNA. And so we spent a lot of time kind of showing that the positions that were diverging were under evolutionary constraint or had other evidence of functional constraints. So here's one type of analysis where we looked at each domain and kind of split them up between the blue, which is the residues that bind DNA, the residues that have nothing to do with the domain, as well as like, for example, the link regions.
00:19:18.720 - 00:20:15.264, Speaker A: And so we looked at evolutionary rates and so we looked at just the positions that diverge in any one genome. And roughly the signal that we wanted to see was that the residues that were binding residues and that varied in this organism had lower evolutionary rates than residues that weren't involved in binding. We did the same type of work looking at populations. So here we try to ask what percent of diverging residues are fixed within a population of Drosophila melanogaster? And here what we wanted to see, and what we see across all these organisms, across the varying residues, is that the binding residues tend to be fixed at higher fractions than the other residues. Ok? And we had many other kinds of tests that were like this. So now we know that actually changes in these residues are pervasive. We have evidence that these positions are under functional constraint.
00:20:15.264 - 00:21:02.130, Speaker A: But does that mean anything in terms of changes in specificity? So I didn't talk about the analysis we did of Marcus's data, but if you think about it, each domain binds 64 triplets, but you have 20 to the four possible combinations of amino acids that bind them. And he had these huge fraction of proteins that actually bound DNA. So there's some redundancy. So the next thing we did that is different proteins can bind, can have very similar DNA binding specificity. So the next thing we did is look through domain by domain and predict binding specificities for all variants. And so, for example, here is for the first five flies, they're all the same. And here is a predicted specificity.
00:21:02.130 - 00:21:52.978, Speaker A: And then for this domain, here is the predicted specificity. And so here's just an example. But we did this kind of more rigorously. And our overall bottom line is, across domains, these divergences, there are divergences and predictive specificities, and they also increase with increased evolutionary distance. So then we have these transcription factors, we know they vary, we have different predicted specificities. We also wanted to see, well, does this actually change a topology of the network? And so what we tried to do here was we looked at 52 transcription factors with known binding specificities. In drosophil melanogaster, we map binding sites just proximal to genes and promoter regions in Drosophila melanogaster.
00:21:52.978 - 00:22:32.050, Speaker A: And then we wanted to know, for the conserved group of transcription factors versus the diverged group, do you lose binding sites more or less frequently? And here we did many versions of this type of analysis. So here we're restricting ourselves to what we call high confidence binding sites, those that are conserved in the four closest flow. And then we saw what fraction of those binding sites are present or absent in the conserved groups of transcription factors. And the diverged. And so you can see across the board that for the diverged set, these binding sites are lost more frequently. And that's true at the level of binding sites, and it's also true at the level of transcription factor promoter interactions.
00:22:32.082 - 00:22:37.854, Speaker D: Is it either lost or because you have mutation under the place by.
00:22:38.454 - 00:23:13.162, Speaker A: Well, so we didn't predict, we didn't go look for, like compensatory binding sites. So I can't answer that question precisely, but so we would say that there are certainly those binding sites are gone away. It's true at the level of individual sites and it's true at the level of promoters. But I think it'd be very interesting to look to see if there are compensatory sites. That's what she's asking. And so I think that we don't have quite the tools to do that. I think we could predict specificities and try to find them.
00:23:13.298 - 00:23:15.570, Speaker D: Since I already interrupted the follow up question.
00:23:15.682 - 00:23:16.374, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:23:19.474 - 00:23:26.694, Speaker D: Is the lookout composition the same in all the flight is like at content and all of that the same for some changes?
00:23:28.474 - 00:24:05.824, Speaker A: That's a good question, and I think I won't. I don't know the answer well enough to answer that. Okay. So I wanted to say that if you look at the set of conserved transcription factors and the diverged set and all both of them together, they actually have different functional properties overall. So both sets, if you look at functional enrichment, you have things that are related to transcription. If you look at the transcription factors that are conserved or the zinc fingers that are conserved, you see a lot of developmental processes come up. If you look at the set that's diverged, actually, there's no enriched function.
00:24:05.824 - 00:25:01.004, Speaker A: But individually, these proteins are annotated. It's not that none of them have annotations. So you have things, some of them related with development, but largely maybe because melanogaster has a lot of those kind of annotations to begin with, but overall, there's no biological process that's enriched here. Another thing we did is we looked at expression patterns. And so the diverged set, I'll say they're expressed, and in fact, surprising to us, they're actually more broadly expressed when you look across tissues than the diverge set, than the conserved set, but they are expressed at lower levels. And so what I wanted to argue was that there's in fact pervasive variation in transcription factors, and that we think this contributes to regulatory network evolution. And I did this by giving a comparative genomics framework that uses aspects about what we know about protein structure.
00:25:01.004 - 00:25:49.786, Speaker A: And we showed that there were changes that could affect DNA binding specificity. We showed that these divergent residues, in a number of analysis only some of which I showed you show evidence of functional constraint. We showed that these changes result in change specificity. And this is based on computational predictors, rs, and also kind of consensus based views. And these changes in specificity actually increase with distance to millennia, and that this gives actually. So instead of thinking about having a change in a transcription factor leading to catastrophic changes, this actually gives an evolutionary, viable model by which these regulatory networks can change. Okay, I wanted to do just one more short story, which was relating to so that was what we did with transcriptional regulatory network evolution.
00:25:49.786 - 00:26:33.460, Speaker A: I wanted to switch and talk a little bit about various other kind of protein interactions and in particular mutations affecting protein interactions in healthy and diseased individuals. And this is the work of Dario Gersey, who's now a professor in Nebraska. And so I think this is a picture that Sridhar showed in his first slide. Yeah, yeah, Google, exactly that. We think about different individuals and we all vary, and again, our protein coding regions are almost the same. And so it's really the networks that are different between us that give rise to this incredible diversity. And so, as with the last part of my talk, I want to think about how these networks change when thinking about mutations.
00:26:33.460 - 00:27:56.024, Speaker A: And really just the idea, kind of the obvious one, that not just for transcription factors, but for other things as well, that mutations that affect protein interactions are critical, whether it's protein, small molecule, protein, protein, protein, peptide, protein, DNA, protein, rna. And so Dario had developed this framework to think about mutations with respect to protein interfaces. And so basically, he focused on protein interactions, and he looked at mutations that were observed, he mapped them with respect to reference, and then he was able to look in the PDB as well as this semi curated database, biolip, and uncover which residues are associated with binding. And using kind of very conservative criteria for transferring information about binding, you can model about 22% of human proteins. So a fair fraction, but actually, I think you can push this up pretty far. And here we ended up focusing on interactions with nucleic acids, DNA and rna with small molecules and also with peptides, and kind of ignoring bigger questions of protein, protein interactions, which have more complicated interfaces. And so the first thing we tried to think about was just polymorphic sites across healthy individuals.
00:27:56.024 - 00:28:46.290, Speaker A: And so here we asked how they vary with respect to protein interactions. So we looked at the number of sites with structural information. We looked at the number of these sites that are polymorphic, we looked at the number of sites that are involved with binding, and we looked at the number of polymorphic sites involved in binding. And this is just restricted to missense mutations. And if you do this kind of aggregate, this kind of analysis in aggregate, what you see is that polymorphic sites across humans tend to avoid binding sites. So this is what you would expect, kind of using a hypergeometric, and this is an aggregate, the total number of sites within binding positions that are polymorphic. And so overall, this points to the idea that networks across individuals, which we know vary, are not varying due to changes within proteins.
00:28:46.290 - 00:29:37.210, Speaker A: And this is, you know, maybe what we would expect okay, so you can do the same thing across disease individuals. And so the cancer data set is a good one to look at here. And so, if you look at missense mutations found across these eight cancer types, what you would see, actually is the opposite trend, that just in aggregate, you tend to see cancer missense mutations enriched in binding sites. If instead of looking at missense mutations, you look at synonymous mutations, which would have no effect on protein interactions, this kind of is as you would expect. And this trend is shown in aggregate for nucleic acid, small molecule and peptide binding sites. But in fact, if you split them up individually, all these same trends are true. Okay, so then you can turn it around.
00:29:37.210 - 00:30:46.614, Speaker A: And this is something that we've thought about quite a bit now, is if we know that binding sites across healthy populations tend not to vary, but in these cancer genomes seem to vary, maybe we can use that as a way to try to identify genes that may play a role in cancer initiation or progression. And a lot of people, of course, have talked about this yesterday, and many people raised the point that, in fact, the real challenge that many of the frequently mutated driver genes have been identified. And the challenges really lie in identifying less frequently mutated genes with functional roles in cancers. And so yesterday, we talked about using networks as a framework to do this. And today I'm going to say that structure is another framework for doing this as well. And so, based on the data that we just showed, our hypothesis is that mutations affecting interactions are more likely to play functional roles. And so we developed, taking kind of the pipeline that I already presented, we decided to try to uncover specific genes, not kind of doing aggregate analysis, where you have significantly mutated binding sites.
00:30:46.614 - 00:31:55.334, Speaker A: And roughly, just as, just very simply, you can tally up the mutations you see in a gene across samples, and you see how often binding sites are hit. It's a little bit trickier than that, because you have to take into account more aspects of the structure, but you get some kind of binding score just very simply here, just adding up the number of binding sites that are hit across your samples, and then this is just a score. To get a p value, you can do permutations where you just throw these mutations around, and then you can get a p value for each gene. And if you then rank your genes by p value. So from those that are most significantly hidden, their binding sites, to those that are least, and you look to see how often you see cancer census genes, those that have been implicated to play a role in cancer initiation or progression, you see a strong enrichment in the most significantly mutated binding sites. If you repeat this analysis, just looking at synonymous mutations, you don't see this enrichment at all. Okay? And you can do this type of analysis in aggregate, which is what I just showed, but you can also do it individually across different cancer types.
00:31:55.334 - 00:32:36.022, Speaker A: And here are genes that were found to be significantly mutated in one or more of the cancers. And here, this part got cut off. But you can see the frequency or the fraction of samples for which mutations are found in binding slides. And in red are known cancer genes. And so you can see some cases, of course, where you see that there's enrichment in mutations in the binding site across a broad swath of cancers and others. For example, IDH one where you're seeing mutations in just one of the cancer types, and you can look to see one by one. So one of the known cancer genes is dicer one.
00:32:36.022 - 00:33:22.406, Speaker A: And here's an example of the mutations that we see in it in red are the ones that affect an interaction with magnesium, shown here. And these are found in endometrial cancer and glioblastoma. And these mutations affect these negatively charged amino acids that are required for catalytic activity. So this is the type of analysis you could do by putting mutations that are found across these cancers onto structures and uncovering perturbed interaction interfaces. So, just to sum this, sum this up with network variation in healthy and diseased individuals. So say that networks across healthy individuals tend not to vary due to changes in proteins. That doesn't mean that you never see these mutations, just that they are rare.
00:33:22.406 - 00:34:26.764, Speaker A: On the other hand, it seems that networks in cancer cells often vary, or at least are preferentially vary, due to changes in proteins. And this leads to a way they can think about predicting genes that are functionally important in cancers that are based on analyzing interactions. And so I'll say for the second part of our talk, what's ongoing is we're extending the applicability of this approach using predicted binding sites and protein domain information. And we think that using pretty conservative methods, we can get about 60% of the human proteins with respect to interaction domains. So we can probably triple coverage with respect to the protein sets that we can look at with respect to interactions. And so with that, I'll stop and thank again Dario Shilpa and Anton. So I'm wondering if you look at.
00:34:27.304 - 00:34:31.814, Speaker F: CGA data expression or translation from sneak attack.
00:34:33.314 - 00:34:50.334, Speaker A: So we have started looking at to see whether these mutations are affecting genes that are expressed. Yeah, we have looked at that. It's a little bit more tricky than we had hoped, because I think the question is, when is something not expressed?
00:34:52.394 - 00:34:55.054, Speaker F: And have you checked out any indels?
00:34:55.514 - 00:35:04.094, Speaker A: We have not looked at indels. We have looked at nonsense mutations. But I think right now what we've mainly focused on are missense.
00:35:07.794 - 00:35:45.920, Speaker G: So one from Cornell. So we are also very much interested in looking at protein pruning interactions and looking at structural details of these protein pruning interactions. And, you know, my question is more philosophical about your first, in your previous slides about healthy individuals. Their network variation tend not to be due to proteins, changes in proteins, because we also. The result is definitely right. That is, we also observe that common variants tend to be depleted at the interface because they're much more concerned.
00:35:45.992 - 00:35:48.958, Speaker A: Protein protein interface prothesis, protein protein interfaces. And.
00:35:49.006 - 00:35:58.158, Speaker G: But, you know, the rare. But if you look at the, you know, based on the allele frequencies, the rare ones do tend to be more enriched at these protein pronouns interfaces.
00:35:58.286 - 00:36:34.816, Speaker A: No, and I. Right, yeah, so I. No, I, that's right. So I think for, like, mendelian diseases, some of those things, I think, are known also to affect, you know, stability, but also interfaces. I think just in general that seems to be true. Actually, we haven't looked at protein interfaces because they are more complicated and you have larger interfaces. And so the effect of a mutation is a little bit harder to assess because the impact of the mutation might vary depending on the size of the interaction interfaces.
00:36:34.816 - 00:36:45.580, Speaker A: And so that's why we actually looked at smaller interaction interfaces here. And so I think it's really, you know, I think the PPI work is really cool. I think it's also, I think it's also more difficult.
00:36:45.732 - 00:37:05.204, Speaker G: Yeah, I think I'm clearly biased because of my work in protection. I do tend to think, although we need to find more evidence that I think even for healthy individuals, because we, you know, each of us carries four to 5 million, you know, based on the latest 1000 genomes variant.
00:37:05.244 - 00:37:22.404, Speaker A: So, yeah, so I should be clear, we were relating a protein, peptide protein, DNA protein, rna protein, small molecule, protein, ion. And I think, and also I don't want to say that we never saw variation. We did. So I just showed aggregate statistics that said you find them less often than you would expect.
00:37:24.224 - 00:37:53.172, Speaker F: So I guess I have a question. So it looks like when you're going at this, you're kind of approaching it not so much. I mean, it's kind of a network point of view. But. But going at the variation question, basically there's fewer mutations in these type. The localized binding sites. Do you see that a binding site that interacts with more things is also like, is there a further selection pressure on that? So is there some sort of pressure at the network level, or is it just.
00:37:53.348 - 00:38:02.384, Speaker A: That's a good question and I don't have an answer for you yet. I don't know, but I think that's a. That's a good question.
00:38:04.484 - 00:38:18.348, Speaker C: A question about how you define the binding site. Yeah, say, intuitively, you've never talked about, like, the interior of a protein. I assume if you do this kind of analysis, or a core.
00:38:18.516 - 00:38:22.540, Speaker A: So we have not looked at cores, so we looked at protein ligand interactions.
00:38:22.652 - 00:38:29.526, Speaker C: But how do you know those residues are actually not? Because many of them are, like, deep pockets.
00:38:29.590 - 00:39:05.218, Speaker A: There are deep pockets, so. That's right. So we are looking at proximity to ligand from heavy atoms on both sides. And so there are probably other reasonable ways to do the same thing. No, we didn't further analyze that, but some of the questions about mutations in the quorum might also be interesting, but maybe less. But I see what you're saying. So you're saying maybe that all the things that are proximal may not.
00:39:05.218 - 00:39:07.866, Speaker A: In fact, I will assume you need.
00:39:07.890 - 00:39:11.454, Speaker C: To require them to have some kind of solvent accessibility.
00:39:13.314 - 00:39:33.994, Speaker A: No, because I think. No, but a lot of times when you look in a pocket, they are actually. They have very low solvent accessibility. Some things have high solvent accessibility and some. Some things have low solvent accessibility, but they're still interacting with the ligand. So right now we're not adding any extra things on there. So it's really looking at the side chains and their proximity to the ligands.
00:39:34.294 - 00:39:51.160, Speaker C: It might be interesting to separate the pockets into, like, different kinds of pockets, which ones tend to be more disruptive? Cancers, which kinds of pockets?
00:39:51.352 - 00:40:02.204, Speaker A: Right. So we didn't do it specifically on pockets, but we did do it on different kinds of ligands. So, for example, we know the signal is actually strong, very strong for DNA binding and for a small molecule.
00:40:05.304 - 00:40:17.332, Speaker B: So there have been some studies that show the cool stories of concomitant c changes. So cases where the transcription factor protein.
00:40:17.388 - 00:40:20.716, Speaker A: Changes and the binding site changes. Yeah.
00:40:20.780 - 00:40:22.784, Speaker B: Can you do this with your data?
00:40:25.284 - 00:41:01.114, Speaker A: Yes, I think each step that we move away, move towards it would be with prediction. So I feel like the analysis we did was fairly conservative and I think we could. Our predictions, I don't know if I trust them so well that I'm going to say here is where they really bind. This is a new specificity, and here's a new predicted target. Having said that, I think that in aggregate, maybe an analysis like that could work. So I think it'd be very cool to try. We've shied away from it a little bit.
00:41:02.614 - 00:41:34.534, Speaker E: I don't know if you have followed Ali Ragha's latest work on that. Despite huge changes that target genes, individual factors across species, the functional enrichment in those targets, very different target sets, is very similar. Despite regulating different genes in different species, they are involved in the same type of function, which is kind of. And you are saying things that diverge do not show any functional enrichment.
00:41:35.134 - 00:42:12.542, Speaker A: Those are the transcription factors themselves. So it's what's known currently about the transcription factors. So we're just trying to say, here's a set of transcription factors that are conserved, and some of them are conserved across all. You know, they're present in single copy across all twelve flies. If we just look to see what they're annotated with, you see a lot of developmental, you know, they're enriching the developmental annotations. If I look at this other set that people had largely not thought about, you know, I don't think the phenomenon was thought about too much, how much they could vary. And you look at their functional enrichments, you don't see functional enrichments, you see individual transcription factors that have annotations.
00:42:12.542 - 00:42:16.166, Speaker A: You just don't see like a general process that they're involved.
00:42:16.310 - 00:42:18.074, Speaker D: Let's take one more question before.
00:42:20.294 - 00:42:35.592, Speaker B: So I have a question with regards to the 60% proteins. You can achieve stress with at least one binding domain. So do you go beyond 3d structural information or what would it be really in primary sequence space?
00:42:35.648 - 00:42:36.244, Speaker F: Because.
00:42:37.864 - 00:43:06.574, Speaker A: No, we use information about structure. We're just. We're using protein domain information as well. 60% is what 60% of proteins have. Actually, the number is larger than that. If you look at PFAM domains that are in complex with a ligand and you look to see how many human protein sequences are covered by them, it's more than 60%. Maybe it's closer to 70%.
00:43:06.574 - 00:43:32.416, Speaker A: I don't know the exact number right now, but we need to get from a PDB structure where you have information about interaction to kind of a general model for how this domain interacts with its ligand. And so you are going to lose some information there in terms of primary sequence coverage. Yeah. So it's not going to be. It's not 90% of the sequence. That's true for us already. So yeah, it's going to be much.
00:43:32.416 - 00:43:41.444, Speaker A: It's going to be correspond to the domain portions of the sequences, which is less. So I don't have a great number there. Yeah.
00:43:42.864 - 00:43:43.984, Speaker D: Let's thank monetary.
