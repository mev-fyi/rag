00:00:00.800 - 00:00:44.200, Speaker A: Thank you very much and thanks for the invitation. It feels like being a party crasher, being only one of two experimentalists here. But I hope that in the course of the talk I can show you that there's a chance that experiments actually can implement those very interesting concepts. And the gap actually gets smaller and smaller basically between theory and computer scientist concepts and ideas and what actually can be done in a laboratory. As you can see from the title, we work with photons and I would like to use a few slides to make advertisements that there's a reason why we still work with photons. And I'm a fan of those nice little guys. First of all, it's very nice to implement qubits zero in one state by using the polarization degree of freedom.
00:00:44.200 - 00:01:13.640, Speaker A: You see, basically the blob sphere is the same as the polarization sphere. You can address that very nicely with a simple plate. So it's actually undergrads can do it after a five minute introduction. To go to any point on a ploch sphere, we can make measurements very nice by splitting polarization one or the other. On a cube like here, we can split them into different paths. So you see this, It's a very accessible qubit with respect to many other systems. The more tricky part is to get entanglement.
00:01:13.640 - 00:01:44.536, Speaker A: And now we use for more than 20 years the same way to get entangled photons, because it's still the best option out there. What we do is we use a nonlinear crystal where basically one photon, one blue photon goes through. And there's a small chance that this blue photon is converted into two red. It has to of course obey energy conservation. So one blue is the same as two red in terms of energy and of course momentum conservation. If you take the right crystal, they're fogonally polarized. You see, there's one polarization cone, here's the other cone.
00:01:44.536 - 00:02:12.338, Speaker A: Now you see a picture. Basically you look at the crystal when the photons come out. What's the tricky part? The tricky part is you should get the same frequency guys, let's say the green ones. This is one polarization state, here's the other state. And if you take photons from the cross sections, then you know they have to be different, but you don't know basically which one belongs to which cone. So you get almost perfectly entangled states with up to 99.9% fidelity to explain in a movie what I just said.
00:02:12.338 - 00:02:43.966, Speaker A: Now we have a movie here with a CCD camera where you look at the crystal, the laser shoots in your eye and if you tilt the crystal, you change the properties in such a way that suddenly you see that this down conversion starts happening. If you tilt further on, you see how the cones appear. And then when they start to overlap, you would stop there to catch the entangled photons. Since we like this movie because it's so nice to show how it goes, let me show it here. Basically you see this down coated photons H. Polarized, depolarized. You tilt further on and you see at some point they start to overlap.
00:02:43.966 - 00:02:54.410, Speaker A: You would stop here and catch photons from this gentle. This small point here and there to get you a nice entangled photon pairs for whatever you would like to do. Chsh, test quantum computations and so on.
00:02:54.710 - 00:02:57.342, Speaker B: What do you mean by catch photons from here and there?
00:02:57.526 - 00:03:18.162, Speaker A: Sorry. Basically there's a crystal shining light into your eyes, just a single photon, so really like the smallest amount of light. And you would basically put a fiber or some coupler there to catch just from this cross section. Okay. Otherwise they're not entangled because only when you get photons from these cross sections here, okay, you're able to get entanglement because you know, they have to be orthogonal, but they don't know which way independence.
00:03:18.226 - 00:03:19.986, Speaker B: So you actually have a fiber that's.
00:03:20.018 - 00:03:30.370, Speaker A: Physically located at this point, the lens and the fiber, and that's the tricky part. So the hard part is to get, to get this arrangement that you have this situation happening and they get them right from there. Okay, how big?
00:03:30.410 - 00:03:34.190, Speaker B: What's the scale? The crystal on the picture, the sky.
00:03:36.600 - 00:04:07.306, Speaker A: That's basically 300 microns, like half a millimeter. So but this one is like, this is like a couple into 5 micron fiber. So it takes some experience, but people nowadays know how to do it. Okay. Since I heard from Dorothy, it's a computer scientist workshop, we should not spend too much into experiments. I hope we can go slowly towards the experiments for. For wrapping up photons, a thing in my eyes, a neat system that allows to combine basically everything that's out there with quantum fun.
00:04:07.306 - 00:04:57.794, Speaker A: You can cover, of course, foundational tests which are done for many years now, variation of spelling, equalities and so on. They're the natural choice for communication purposes because they fly at the speed of light. Of course, they're also a natural choice for metrology applications where you can also achieve enhancement by using quantum states of light. And now for roughly 10, 12 years, people have realized there's a scalable approach in principle where you can use photonic systems for making quantum computations. How do you make your gate operations basically by measuring extra photons as shown here, which process your input states through the computation. The thing that I've not realized until I met Elham Jones on is actually that you also can combine them in different directions. Which means, for example, you can combine communication and computation purposes because they're mobile.
00:04:57.794 - 00:05:43.248, Speaker A: So you can use mobility as a key feature for starting like cloud computing or dedicated computations. So until I met these guys, my understanding was basically like this of the comic about cloud computing. So just brief ideas about Gmail and Yahoo. But then basically when I met the first element workshop, I was fascinated by this line, point to point in computation. And then very soon afterwards we had the first meeting with the theoreticians who proposed this theory model here in Adam Brownder's and Broadbent, Elam Kashev and Joe Fitzsimmons. They basically had the first interaction between experimentalists and computer scientists, theoreticians. It took some drinks actually to realize, yes, with a few photons in your hand, you actually can do something.
00:05:43.248 - 00:06:22.976, Speaker A: It turned out it was like a three year project until we got the final result. And it was a very interesting role that both sides, I guess, could learn a lot, at least from my side. And it was very interesting to see how things work from the other side of the thing. Okay, thanks to Joe, I can make this rather brief. So the idea of blind quantum computing, if you combine cryptography, the benefits from quantum cryptography and quantum computing, you can also map this in this kind kind of delegated computation that you say as a client, sending something just tiny, classic tiny quantum information to computer. He makes entanglement, he makes the measurements, sends information back. The point is the computer is blind.
00:06:22.976 - 00:07:04.462, Speaker A: He doesn't know the input, know the processing and know the output. This is done in the framework of this measurement based quantum computing, which is one of the few main avenues how you can build a quote quantum computer. There's the circuit model where you have gates in here, whereas in this case you make basically this entangled resource state and make measurements basically to process few information. So I will rather shorten that up because Joe gave a nice introduction for Curiosity. You might see that experimentalists explain things differently than theoreticians. So we reduced the number of equations and rather good pictures. So for me, in the simplest way, experiment quantum computing is you have these plus states.
00:07:04.462 - 00:07:50.624, Speaker A: You entangle them by C operations to a cluster state. You make measurements one by one according to what's shown here on this XY plane. And you see the first class state is Rotated according to the measurement setting followed by hadamard2 here and so on. This was done the first time roughly 10 years ago, with also four qubits. There you can see depending on the shape of the cluster, one dimensional cluster you, you make one qubit rotations. If it's two dimensional, we basically get two dimensional gates and so on. The point is, what I also learned from this blind quantum computing is that very nicely you can split the quantum and the classical part in a way that the quantum part is the entanglement resource, basically the cluster state itself, whereas the structure one dimensional, two dimensional and so on.
00:07:50.624 - 00:08:22.446, Speaker A: As well as the measurement settings. Here are the classical informations that define the quantum computing. Okay, the point is of the splined quantum protocol is to hide those two informations to make it short brickworks. If you build out everything out of bricks, then you can take a snapshot and you don't know what's going to happen because every brick can implement all the ingredients for universal quantum computing. You just need to choose the right measurement settings. So the trick now is how to hide the measurement settings. Basically by adding one degree of freedom.
00:08:22.446 - 00:08:46.540, Speaker A: So now the qubits can have this one out of eight phases up shown here. The computer makes the cluster state, but doesn't know which kind of cluster state makes measurements. Again, another point is the computer knows the measurement setting. He's doing this delta, but does not notify, which only the client knows. That's the point for making this one blind. In a nutshell, that's how the protocol goes. And we go to the experiments.
00:08:46.540 - 00:09:17.482, Speaker A: Client prepares those queues of a random phase, sends it to the computer, he makes entangled state. Computer gets the orders what to measure, he gets results, sends this back. Basically only you as the client has the benefit to know basically what was done in the computation. So experiments. So when we had this, when we heard about this protocol, we said, yes, that's great, we would like to do it. And then of course comes the first negotiation part. So what's the minimal effort we have to do? Because everything is hard, you know, like we had four qubits in a laboratory.
00:09:17.482 - 00:09:47.066, Speaker A: We had some constraints with the setup. You know, turnarounds always take one year. Basically it's an experiment at least, at least one year, maybe sometimes longer. So we could negotiate that actually two encoding two of them are sufficient to show all the benefits. So we could achieve optimize blind function computing by having just theta 2 and theta 3 in a blind configuration. That's the setup. We have a down conversion source here's the client part where we can choose the settings here for those four input states.
00:09:47.066 - 00:10:19.528, Speaker A: And again, entanglement quantum computation is happening at beam splitters optical elements, where the computer makes it a cluster state or the blind cluster state and performs the measurements. I prepared some movie which shows basically this part of the setup in addition to the second gate. So we used later on we used this part for effectively one cnot and then we added another cnot. But that's not so important. That's the picture for the updated setup. The point would like to show you what kind of space is needed. So for just this blind quantum computing.
00:10:19.528 - 00:10:48.382, Speaker A: That's basically a space for implementing the dedicated quantum computation. And then later on we added this little part for a second CNOT gate. It's also important, but I would rather show you. It's a clip what I meant. Our down conversion works. So what you see now is that our down conversion crystal fast laser shoots through like this blue laser that pairs either forward or backward emitted. It's a different experiment, so don't be confused about the nomenclature.
00:10:48.382 - 00:11:12.732, Speaker A: But the experimental setup somehow looks the same. So if pairs in one way, we send the laser back. We can send pairs also in that way. Sometimes it happens to have come out at the same time, which is what we want to get. Four photon entanglement we shoot with 80 million shots per second. So you see many photon pairs come out in principle along this way and that way. The tricky part is to align that the single photons overlap coherently at beam splitters.
00:11:12.732 - 00:11:41.296, Speaker A: And if one guy is measured, you effectively introduce a gate operation which is a CNOT in that experiment. So after the first C note, the photons continue traveling, go through these wave plates that define the spin state. Basically local operations. You see how the spin is changing here? It's cute. And then again the overlap again with another view splitter. And I measured at the end for making the final gate. But that's basically what you do for living in the laboratories to make some experiments happening.
00:11:41.296 - 00:11:45.600, Speaker A: Okay. Not the latest.
00:11:45.720 - 00:11:49.568, Speaker B: This picture is sort of. For instance, you're preparing the cluster state here.
00:11:49.704 - 00:11:52.652, Speaker A: So this is. Yeah, that's basically how it goes.
00:11:52.716 - 00:11:55.500, Speaker B: So the cluster state is. I mean, it's sort of flying around.
00:11:55.620 - 00:11:56.716, Speaker A: Yes, precisely in the table.
00:11:56.748 - 00:12:07.440, Speaker B: Yeah, but say. So when you're running this protocol, the server is preparing the cluster state. So it's in these photons and then at some point it receives some instructions.
00:12:08.340 - 00:12:26.102, Speaker A: Yes, it's a very short time script because the flight, the speed of light, literally. So what we do is We. Sorry, I interrupted you. Maybe it was a different question. Okay, so of course here you make a simple. Simplify as much as you can. So in principle you can change shot by shot, but then you have to use very fast switches for doing that.
00:12:26.102 - 00:12:41.782, Speaker A: So what you have done is Alice had one switch, one setting and then the BOB the computer was for had another setting and made some kind of. Made some rounds and collected data. Then in different setting, different setting the other side. So of course it was not shot. In principle we should do a shot by shot, but here it was not done like this.
00:12:41.886 - 00:12:47.600, Speaker B: Everything needs to be timed very precisely, of course. Can you keep the cluster states sort of flying around for a little bit of time?
00:12:47.640 - 00:13:11.226, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. So the setup is very stable that we have. So we can, we can. So once it was aligned and we had our sweet spot, it was running basically weeks. We got data for all possible settings to really measure it until it's dead. Basically to get all the information out we could get from the photon on the same state your photons generate, then you measure. So the state itself is basically destroyed because you measure all the time, you know, but you make new ones.
00:13:11.226 - 00:13:13.030, Speaker A: Basically it runs when you make.
00:13:13.410 - 00:13:15.082, Speaker B: So it's not the same photons for the whole week.
00:13:15.106 - 00:13:19.630, Speaker A: No, no, no. Of course they turn into electricity, they get to the APD and the dawn.
00:13:23.730 - 00:13:40.740, Speaker C: Okay, did I understand correctly that you don't actually communicate between Alice and Bob, but you let like Alice say why she would communicate and Bob guess what Alice would say and then you discard the run if it didn't match?
00:13:41.200 - 00:13:43.512, Speaker A: Is that essentially what you do don't understand?
00:13:43.696 - 00:13:47.500, Speaker C: So Alice does not actually send to Bob.
00:13:48.080 - 00:13:49.272, Speaker A: He sends the qubit there.
00:13:49.296 - 00:13:58.500, Speaker C: Okay, yeah, but not the classical information. Essentially Bob just guesses what Alice sends and you in a sense discard the experiment if it didn't match up?
00:13:58.800 - 00:14:13.080, Speaker A: No, basically. So it was pre arranged. Basically Bob could have got the order to get the message whatsoever set. But now we said, okay, for this time we put this setting there. So we added like half a meter of table. So they make a fast communication and speed of light was the point. So we wanted to show that.
00:14:13.080 - 00:14:15.208, Speaker A: But in principle what needs to be done.
00:14:15.264 - 00:14:20.100, Speaker C: For example, if you. Because in the actual product, if you try to scale it, you have like several.
00:14:20.800 - 00:14:22.424, Speaker A: You need this communications. Yes.
00:14:22.552 - 00:14:27.914, Speaker C: Then you can't do this Communication matches some transit.
00:14:28.112 - 00:14:29.398, Speaker A: So but now we've done.
00:14:29.534 - 00:14:33.450, Speaker C: The probability that the computation will work goes down exponentially.
00:14:35.470 - 00:14:54.076, Speaker A: Any of what could have been both directions. But it's one that we could do it so we have to basically talk about is feed forward and classical communication. We could have done that and we had actual equipment there. But now we were focusing on the first step towards this story. In the future, we're going to do this really like giving orders, implementing feed forward operations.
00:14:54.158 - 00:15:04.144, Speaker C: So on the Bob would become bigger and bigger so that to match the. Because between Alice and Bob, there's a time that needs to pass, but you.
00:15:04.152 - 00:15:25.194, Speaker A: Can slow it down. So 55 photos, if they go in fibers, they're only 2/3 the speed of light. So you can still have a classical benefit to say, okay, while they're traveling there, you can tell Bob, hey, please be prepared to make this measurement so this can be done. But you know, this one took so long to compile. It sounds clean. But to understand how we can implement this in the laboratory, it took some time. And we said, okay, that's our focus, how to do it.
00:15:25.194 - 00:15:45.002, Speaker A: And then every overhead is considered. Let's do it. Now. We plan to do it, of course, but at some point you have to decide what's the step you would like to show? Okay, well, that's basically it. So we took our four photons and played around in this blind quantum computation scheme. So you see, these two are black. These two were blind.
00:15:45.002 - 00:16:23.034, Speaker A: So you could hide one qubit rotations. If these two are blind, you could hide those two qubit gate operations. And we could implement also like Deutsche algorithm and global search algorithm in a blind fashion. So you see, these are the hours of measurement, not for one run, but just to show we took really all possible settings and we're interested in studying as much as we can of such an interesting computation. Another thing that interestingly I learned from the experiment was that sometimes people ask you, well, we know the theory, like Bell test, I heard was also the same case 40 years ago. We know the theory, and theory seems to be right. Why too bother to make an experiment.
00:16:23.034 - 00:17:26.673, Speaker A: Okay, and then the thing that we learned, or at least I learned, and I guess maybe Joe and Adam knew already in advance, was that via the experiment itself, and then also from feedback from referees, actually, we learned that it's more secure than I thought. And more secure mean that if they have imperfections that we had, you know, computers are not perfect, you have not perfect entanglement generation, then what's basically jeopardized or destroyed is the correctness of the computation, but not the security. So it means the clients, they can preserve its security, its privacy, as long as the data's a random. I think it was a very interesting Thing to learn that this aspect shows that how strong this protocol actually works in real life conditions and with less demanding. I meant that it was shown that by being such a hard negotiator to make it simple for our experiments that it seems you don't need to make all of the qubits blind. You can find cases or scenarios where you can basically limit the amount of blind qubits, which also is a big benefit in real life applications. So in the future we have this kind of dedicated quantum computation.
00:17:26.673 - 00:18:06.950, Speaker A: It's my dream to go with distance and hopefully in the future we can show in Vienna that we can go with some kind of kilometers for this dedicated quantum computation. Okay, that's the obvious thing. Security and privacy preserving features. The thing I was not aware of, which is also like a new baby for me was the idea of interactive proofs and verification of quantum computations. Where this blind quantum computer seems to be a very nice approach at the moment, a very resource efficient approach to to get an idea of what's happening in the machine. It goes back to Dorit and Oran Ewan. That's basically how I heard about the first time about this quantum verification ideas.
00:18:06.950 - 00:18:37.176, Speaker A: But since we had this flying quantum computer, we went along this line with Joe and Elham to implement basically strapped qubits. As Joe mentioned in our case again we had four qubits. So we had to find some optimized protocol. What we have done is we didn't place the trapped qubit isolated from the others, rather prepared the trapped qubits by making measurements on those 2 3. And then we check is this result is correct or not correct. Basically by comparing what the computer is telling us. And you see we had pretty good results.
00:18:37.176 - 00:19:00.706, Speaker A: And see that's real life conditions. So we're going to get those numbers or 91% success rate. What does it mean? So then comes the hard part for them to say yes, that's a serious proof. We can show that this is. That makes a statement was just noise. But at the end it turned out it's a pretty good sign. Of course we place the trap in different configuration so we could show in a nice way how this verification idea works.
00:19:00.706 - 00:19:44.166, Speaker A: Since it's a small system, we cannot place the traps in a big computation, but rather put it basically like as an alternative run. Either you make a computation if you're four qubits or a verification and so on. That was the idea of this quantum verification with single photons. Basically opening the eyes that this is a very interesting concept for getting idea what's happening in the machine. We had also debates about what needs to be shown. And there's interesting different of opinions. So from coming from quantum physics and being like in Vienna with foundations and entanglement and Bell inequalities, we thought that the only way to prove a quantum hood ever explained properly is to make a hidden Bell test, which was a topic also today.
00:19:44.166 - 00:20:42.262, Speaker A: But we learned that for computer scientists, sometimes it's even better to make a proof to say can we trust the machine? Is the machine running properly? And from that automatically it follows that if it's a quantum computer, you can also do Bell in the college if you want. So. But there seems to be some different opinions about concepts. What's nice to show? Never mind. We showed this kind of blind Bell test where the computer got the input states, he entangled them, he didn't know that he's doing that, and he made all the measurements in a blind fashion, which means he had no idea that he's preparing Bell pairs and making a CHSH inequality within this verification process. Okay, the last 10 minutes would like to raise questions for total different stories. Now we change gears and the question is, can we apply verification concepts to this new hype of intermediate or resource efficient quantum computations? And what I mean by that.
00:20:42.262 - 00:21:38.810, Speaker A: Let me explain briefly what these resource efficient computations are about. So Scott basically is the right guy to talk to about the theoretical concept. It's about boson sampling, for example. So for that photons are very neat system as well the ideas you can actually very efficiently implement unitary transformations to photons. So if a photon comes in one of those input ports and you have those complex interferometers where just beams, beam splitters and phase shifters, you can effectively and efficiently map the input state to an output state. So if you modern guide and use wave guides and you have those modes here with beam splitters and you can adjust to your unitary transformation. So the task is how can you put how can it transform your input to an output state? If you consider the simplest case, which I guess many of you have heard for a couple of times already, it's just a beam splitter where you have a 50% chance the photon comes to be transmitted or reflected.
00:21:38.810 - 00:22:25.348, Speaker A: Now you say the task is I put a detector here and there. What's my chance to get a coincidence that those two different output ports we get a click and then there comes this famous quantum detective interference effect, also called Hong Mandel effect, where you will see that the chance that both photons are transmitted and both are reflected Give you zero. Because when you write down the beamsplitter matrix, you see that those terms here, the ones A, A and D plus, those terms here cancel because there's an I phase shift for each photon and it's reflected to surface. Okay? So this kind of interference effect leads to a very nice feature that this can be explained by the permanent of a matrix. You see, there's a plus sign actually by the permanent squared. The point is, to make it short, it's very hard to calculate permanence. It's a class of sharp P.
00:22:25.348 - 00:23:23.766, Speaker A: And what Scott has shown that actually even related things like sampling, which means the photon comes here and it propagates through just sampling, is very hard because it's related to the permanence within the circuit. So make it short, because Scott, I guess we talk at the last stage about this interesting direction. The thing that was so mind shaking for us experimentalists was that in ideal case, which is never out there, just 20 photons and 400 modes, like the size of the unitary in principle would outperform any classical machine. And that's great. I mean suddenly you see like there's a machine out there or some sample out there, you don't need anything. No two qubit gates as you get, just photons, which is 20, not so much, and a complex interferometer which is not that hard and not that unrealistic. So in my eyes, such a concept is among the best, if not the most feasible approach to really set the benchmark can be in 15, 20 years from now.
00:23:23.766 - 00:23:53.968, Speaker A: See, there's a result out there where no classical machine can basically verify this anymore. Okay, which opens the interesting question extended of the extended Church Turing thesis, or is there complexity arguments out there that basically would not allow these quantum computers? So for that reason, four groups simultaneously jumped on this interesting research. Also we have done an experiment. So we had these five modes. What's the first non trivial thing to show you? Take three photons. Okay, so we had three photons in there. This is the real picture of the circuit.
00:23:53.968 - 00:24:26.324, Speaker A: You got the output distributions. And the same stuff was done by the groups in Oxford. Andrew White Brisbane with Scott together and Fabius Guerino in Rome. Of course, when you have this very nice simple scheme or simple concept to suddenly reach basically outputs which cannot be done by classic computers, how can you be sure that the result is right? Okay, in particular, it's an entirely passive system. It's a passive network. So there are no gates. There's no way to make this kind of interactive proof because there's nothing there.
00:24:26.324 - 00:25:03.660, Speaker A: So then rises the question what can be said in a classical way? So as soon as the papers were out there were people raising questions actually, can you distinguish the output from the boson sample to uniform distribution? That was Jens. And then Scotty Meter said yes, of course, read the old paper was done there already. Okay, that's my way of reading that. Yeah, very nicely. But to the point, look, there's difference. And then two groups basically compared the output when you have interference in the quantum mechanical way and totally classical configurations. We have also done something along this line, but in a more general fashion.
00:25:03.660 - 00:26:00.078, Speaker A: We said when we tuned basically the quantumness by changing the distinguishability distinguishability of the photons, which allows to characterize errors because there's probably no way of error correction such as this system because it's passive. No, there's no way to do something. And the question is which I hope there will be a positive answer. Can we extend this problem to bigger classes by considering also permanence, which are imminent as something we are going to sample? So we have done basically in a nutshell, because just two minutes left. Normally we have this kind of situation that three photons come in at the same time such that they can interfere with and following the rules of the permanentness on. However, if they're not basically interfering because they have different timing information so they're not coherently overlapping, then you just get a terminal result which is simple to calculate. However, if they're like slightly overlapping, then they have a mixture of both which belongs to the CAS imminence.
00:26:00.078 - 00:26:34.650, Speaker A: And there's interesting open question. Nobody knows yet if the imminence or how many of the imminence are hard to calculate and if they're basically interesting open question, but it seems right now, at least that's what we learned from Barry Sanders that there are interesting hard questions related to immanent. So it might be that there's a more bigger class out there for sampling. Immanent basically is a mixture of determinant and so determinant is a minus sign. Put in the plus sign. If you have something which is plus or minus in a different values then you have immanent. This is the most general case of that.
00:26:34.650 - 00:27:21.364, Speaker A: So you have a sine function which changes as you design. Okay, so just turn the terminant and permanent extreme cases immanence. Okay, okay, well. Okay, so what you've done basically change the timing the arrival time of photons if they overlap perfectly, if the permanent case is a spot here, if it changed for one of the other photons you see, I get landscape which corresponds to immanence, sampling of immanence of the matrix in there. Good with that at my last slide. So basically that's where we are right now with this efficient intermediate quantum computations. So if people ask why don't you go for much more photons these days? Because I was asked to give some take home message.
00:27:21.364 - 00:27:49.246, Speaker A: What's our challenge? Basically our quantum computers can be split into three parts. So source the circuit and detections. Recently there was a huge improvement for detectors. They work very nicely with almost 100% efficiency. If you have superconductor systems here. The ports are also no problem here because you can use as you like bulk optics or integrated circuits. But the challenging thing is that we have a good multiphoton source where you get photons with the same properties, the same characteristics at the same time.
00:27:49.246 - 00:28:40.980, Speaker A: And here all of them are anti distance probabilistic, which means two photons bright source, four photons at the same time. You see only 200 photons per second, six or eight. You have to wait a very long time to get the positive click and to use them for computations, if that. I have to thank the people who actually did the work, it was not me, but in particular Stephanie Bartz for this blind quantum computing and verification and Max for this boson sampling. And then of course the fruitful collaborations with, with cqtino Joe and where is Edinburgh here? And there's no particular reason that it was like this? No, no, it's like I see the look, it's like kick you afterwards. And here's the summary to show that photons I think have benefits compared to other systems because of the capability to be mobile, to fly around. So you can use this for interactive proofs and so on.
00:28:40.980 - 00:30:01.680, Speaker A: Open questions which I could come up with is like what are the next things to do along the line of experiments for verification? Because now we have just made the first step. But what are the obvious loopholes people have to consider? What about avoiding in principle classical communication that could happen? What are the next thing? What are the resources we need? Do we need quantum memory? Can we go down to really classical communication? So here's the thing. What, what's interesting to show in the future in experiments for the quantum box, can we extend this interesting intermediate computations to broader class of problems by considering immanence or other degrees of freedom that are changed for this computing? And of course if you have such a simple, simple device, how can you verify? Or is there some fundamental limit that as soon as it gets too simple, because you have a very simple, very, very small special purpose simulator like this boson sample. Is there no way at the end to verify if this interactive proofs? Because there's a trade off. So that might be an interesting question to see. There's a fundamental reason or limit with this verification of intermediate quantum computations. If that reached the end, I hope I could stay in time for five minutes and I guess now we have time for a few questions and then large.
00:30:09.660 - 00:30:11.080, Speaker B: We can take questions.
00:30:13.820 - 00:30:24.360, Speaker D: So you in the imminent slide where you were showing that the determinant was appearing when you have three distinguishable photos.
00:30:25.260 - 00:30:44.206, Speaker A: Sorry, let's go. So basically when the photons are distinguishable. Okay, this gets very boring. It's just a classical interferometer. So when they have donor domain, they do not overlap. So one photon comes time one, other one, time two, there's no overlap, no interference happening. Then you get basically results that are related to the determinant of the.
00:30:44.358 - 00:30:52.276, Speaker E: Is that so I thought with distinguishable photons, I thought it's again a permanent. Except now a permanent of a non negative matrix. A matrix of probability.
00:30:52.438 - 00:30:53.016, Speaker A: Yes.
00:30:53.128 - 00:30:55.576, Speaker E: So with fermions you get a determinant.
00:30:55.688 - 00:30:56.632, Speaker A: Yes, it's true. Sorry.
00:30:56.696 - 00:30:58.392, Speaker E: I mean in both cases you get.
00:30:58.416 - 00:31:08.744, Speaker A: Something that's easy, very easy to calculate. Yeah, yeah. So you're right. Yeah. But the interesting part was to think of what happens if this is the partially overlapping.
00:31:08.792 - 00:31:19.170, Speaker D: Okay, I still think this is because I don't know if the immanent here appears in a different. I don't see why you. You get a determinant on why this.
00:31:19.210 - 00:31:28.230, Speaker A: Is service model sticks. So it's as simple as determinant. Sorry, it's like a permanent. Yeah, right, sorry. Because it's the boson, the underlying boson system. You're right. Sorry.
00:31:28.230 - 00:31:43.926, Speaker A: Non negative permanent. Yeah, but the picture is right. So it was my mistake. That was like the slides are differently made recently. Like. But the main story is this picture here where you have this. That's a permanent case in the middle where they overlap perfectly.
00:31:43.926 - 00:32:00.350, Speaker A: And then you say okay, what's happening? If you consider the realistic noise that there's some distinguishability from frequency differences overlapping, which is happening in real life. Okay. So then you're basically somewhere out in this intermediate regions where you basically have to treat the full picture with immanence as well.
00:32:00.390 - 00:32:12.860, Speaker D: I mean I don't doubt that the determinant appears in this case, but I wonder if it's just in a different interpretation. I mean has a different interpretation than the Determinant for fermions.
00:32:13.760 - 00:32:24.248, Speaker A: I agree. It's not bosons, of course, there's no fermions in there. But they had this different sign of the permanence, which is then simple to calculate. You're right. Sorry, that was my mistake again. Yes.
00:32:24.344 - 00:32:29.496, Speaker B: Just on this topic, could you explain how you. I mean you have this unit, Gary, right?
00:32:29.568 - 00:32:29.960, Speaker A: Yes.
00:32:30.040 - 00:32:37.610, Speaker B: So how do you actually sit it into to get these pictures? How do you send it into an experiment?
00:32:37.760 - 00:32:52.422, Speaker A: Okay, so the unitary is the hard part to calculate. So basically first characterize the unitary. You get a chip and then you make measurements to correct there's a unitary. Okay. Then you do classically the calculation. What do you expect to see? So we compare basically. So what you do that is theory.
00:32:52.422 - 00:33:32.786, Speaker A: So theory says, okay, if you know, if you consider these various delays, which was the hard. Actually the core of the paper with Barry Sanders, we get this landscape and then we took. Then we took the data and looked at the end what's coming out and we made those six points and check are they basically in agreement with the theory. So what you do is you measure basically the output distribution as shown here, which is like theory on one side and experiment on the other side. You see does the output contribution basically agree with very high reduce chi squared and so on with the theoretical prediction. So the story of this paper is we would like to understand the realistic conditions when photos are not perfect. There's no delta function, they have a spec spectrum and this and so on.
00:33:32.786 - 00:33:44.910, Speaker A: And moreover, then we learned that imminence also hard to calculate, sometimes as hard as permanence. That we can maybe reach a bigger class of computations by playing around. If this delays of photons. That's the only story.
00:33:47.130 - 00:33:54.150, Speaker C: But if there is no determinant in the distinguishable case, then the partially distinguishable shouldn't be an imminent either.
00:33:54.490 - 00:33:58.480, Speaker A: No, sorry. It is an imminent for sure. That's for sure.
00:33:58.520 - 00:33:59.620, Speaker C: It's an intermittent.
00:34:00.520 - 00:34:21.300, Speaker E: It's some more complicated expression that interpolates between this squared permanent of a complex matrix and a permanent of a non negative matrix. Actually, I'm not sure that it is an imminent. But whatever it is, it may well continue to be computationally hard in the regime of partial distinguishability.
00:34:28.210 - 00:34:30.282, Speaker D: How much of the difficulty of generating.
00:34:30.346 - 00:34:33.870, Speaker E: Multiphoton sources is due to getting the timing correct?
00:34:34.610 - 00:34:57.030, Speaker A: Or is that not much of a problem? The timing is not that hard because you have parts laser systems. So we're synchronized shot by shot. The only painful thing is to wait. Okay. So you have to optimize, you have to optimize to catch as many as possible photons. You have two random sources, and you only want to have the case when both meet simultaneously. So here people spend a lot of time to be efficient in coupling to improve detection.
00:34:57.030 - 00:35:23.760, Speaker A: Because until these days, there's no deterministic photon source. So that's a Nobel Prize in Myers. If somebody develops a multiphoton source, literally, that's for many applications, push a button, they come out like a 5 photon, 10 photon state. You rock. But now there are many approaches, ideas how you can do it, but it's very hard. So nature seems to fight it hand and feet against giving fox states, basically sharp photon states for free. That's our challenge.
00:35:28.260 - 00:35:29.620, Speaker B: Let's thank Philip and all the.
