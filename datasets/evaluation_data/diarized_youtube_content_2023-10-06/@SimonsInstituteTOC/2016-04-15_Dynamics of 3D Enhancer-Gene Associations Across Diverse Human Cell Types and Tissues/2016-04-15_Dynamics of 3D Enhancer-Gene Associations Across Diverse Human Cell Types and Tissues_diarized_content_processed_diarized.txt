00:00:00.320 - 00:00:58.124, Speaker A: Thanks to the organizers for this kind invitation. It's a pleasure to be here and once again talk a little bit more about enhancer gene interactions. So this has been work largely done by my postdoc Zhanrong. I actually collaborated with him while I was a research scientist in Manor's calluses lab. So we've been doing this for about a year and a half now, and I think the results we have are reasonably interesting, and we've been sort of working on validating a bunch of these interactions using CRISPR cas nine. Um, so I'll give you a broad overview of sort of a new probabilistic model we have developed to try to infer enhancer gene interactions just from chromatin data and expression data across many diverse cell types and tissues. The goal is to infer cell type specific interactions and then to try to use these interactions to infer interesting hypotheses about target genes that may be affected by non coding GWAS variants.
00:00:58.124 - 00:01:43.654, Speaker A: So that's basically the theme of the talk. So we're going to focus on this particular data set, which is data from the Roadmap Epigenomics Project and the Encode project, and this was published sometime last year. Basically, it's a really nice dataset with epigenomes and transcriptomes of about 127 different cell types, tissues and cell lines in combination, ranging from a variety of adult tissues, fetal tissues, ips, es cells, and differentiated cells. And we also include a few encode cell lines within this set. So it's basically a nice collection of 127 cell types. Each of these cell types and tissues have at least six key histone modifications. Open chromatin assays.
00:01:43.654 - 00:02:26.002, Speaker A: A subset of them have open chromatin assays, DNA methylation and gene expression. So that's basically the data set. So, one way we decided to integrate this data was to essentially try to learn these hidden marker models using the chrome hmm method. And what it does is, as you know, different combinations of marks often define different classes of elements. So, promoters, for example, will have trimethyl and acetylation enhancers, will have acylation and monomethylation and so on. So chrome HM basically walks across a genome, learns an hmm that learns these states representing different combinations of marks. Now, you can do this for a single cell type.
00:02:26.002 - 00:03:28.164, Speaker A: What we did is we wanted to learn a joint model across all the 127 cell types. So we did a virtual concatenation of each of these cell types, and we learned a single hmm across the board. So the nice thing is, now you have a joint model across all cell types, all the states sort of align with each other, and so on. And so with the five core marks that we had, k four trimethyl monomethyl, k 36 trimethyl, k nine trimethyl, and k 27 trimethyl, we learned a 15 state model. The number of states is, of course, you pick it out of your hat, but this was something that was pretty reasonable. With these 15 states, we capture broad classes of elements, like active promoters, flanking TSS regions, transcribed regions, enhancer like states, a bunch of other kinds of heterochromatin repeat states, bivalent or poised states, and then polycomb repressed elements. So, basically, there are a bunch of active, largely active chromatin states and a bunch of repressed chromatin states.
00:03:28.164 - 00:03:52.666, Speaker A: So, using this strategy, we can now essentially take all the 127 cell types. Each row is one of these cell types, and I'm focusing on one specific locus around the pax five gene, and I can color every position in the genome based on the inferred state in that cell type. So, you know, we pick up pretty nice dynamics. So, for example, pax five is, as you expect, highly. Yes, I would like this question before we lost me.
00:03:52.730 - 00:04:11.520, Speaker B: So if you go back, slide before, and you said that we have a bivalent state, I wanted to understand, is that with him, is he bivalent because of the heterogeneity, or you think that you have simultaneously the same. In the same region, both types of marks?
00:04:11.592 - 00:04:35.428, Speaker A: That's a great question. It depends, I guess, because in some cell types, you see bivalence simply because it's allelic bivalence or heterogeneity across cells. Many of these are tissues, so it could even be more heterogeneous in that case. But we also have embryonic stem cells here where bivalence has been shown to be real. No, because it's a combination. It's a pretty heterogeneous set of things. It's tissues, cell lines, cell types, all kinds of stuff.
00:04:35.428 - 00:05:02.684, Speaker A: I'll just call it a bivalent state and not care so much about whether it's exactly bivalent or not. I would generally just put that in sort of a different class of elements. And these are largely enriched h one cells. That's something we see. So they're probably, in some cases, truly by one, in other cases, allelically or across cells. Any other questions? Sorry, I was looking at the screen. Okay.
00:05:02.684 - 00:05:43.394, Speaker A: Yeah. So you get this very nice dynamics, and we want to now start using some of these dynamics to try to infer, essentially, which distal elements may be linked to which proximal elements. So pax five gene shows very nice cell type specificity, specifically expressed in specific types of lymph lines and t cells. And then around it, one, I think, interesting feature is sort of the non continuous dynamics of the genome. You have a region right here that's highly cell type specific. And right next to it, there's a gene, for example, that is super ubiquitous. So this is kind of pretty interesting and goes back to what I'll show later, is that the associations we learned between enhancers and genes usually need not be proximal.
00:05:43.394 - 00:06:20.864, Speaker A: In fact, we often see enhancers skipping their nearest genes in terms of associations. So going forward, one of the things we were able to do is find a bunch of puritan enhancers, and these we defined as chromatin accessible sites. So, DNA speaks in states that essentially are annotated as enhancers in at least one of these cell types. So we can take, we obtain 2 million such chromed and accessible elements that fall in enhancer like states in at least one cell type. And if you take these. So that's the columns in this matrix. And if you take the rows, and we essentially just cluster them by activity.
00:06:20.864 - 00:07:28.944, Speaker A: So if you see yellow, it means the enhancer is active, and white, it's inactive. So you just cluster this, you actually see really nice modular dynamics, right? So we pick up approximately 206 course modules. And if you take these modules and just run like some kind of go annotation enrichment engine, like great, you actually pick up a pretty serotype and tissue specific or lineage specific go terms. So, for example, this module that is active in ES and IPS cells, highly enriched for terms and development morphology, immune enhancers that are highly, specifically active in T cells and B cells are enriched by immune response terms and so on. So it indicates that there is a sort of very nice modular dynamics of enhancers, lineage specific activity enriched for linear specific functions. Now, the key question we weren't able to answer is, which enhancer is associated with genes? That's something you don't get easily out of this analysis we had initially done. So Chandrang basically tried to work on this, and while we were at MIT, and now he's joined my lab as a postdoc, and we were trying to use an unsupervised strategy to link these enhances to genes.
00:07:28.944 - 00:07:58.874, Speaker A: So, as you all know, there are a variety of different experimental methods for assaying chromatin contact maps. I just list a few here. Hi C and Geopet. And these are generally good. I mean, they're getting better over time, but I would say hi C. Still most high C datasets out there, other than, for example, the Lieberman data set, which is really, really nice, generally ten kb fragments, so it's pretty low resolution. Chia pet, on the other hand, is specific for the proteins that you pull down with the chip.
00:07:58.874 - 00:08:54.458, Speaker A: Generally the high costs require millions of cells. And one, I think central issue with hi C that we've seen, and maybe you guys agree and I'd like to know your opinions, is generally the interactions that you can predict that you can pick up from hise maps reliably tend to be these more stable loops. So the CTCF mediated stable loops. Think about these dynamic enhancer promoter contacts. It's much harder to reliably call them from high c data, even if it's really deep. So for example, the Lieberman folks find these 50,000 looping interactions, and depending on how you process the data, you can learn more or less loops interactions, but they definitely do not cover the entire spectrum of enhancer genes and so they don't really give you all the information you need. So they generally have relatively low signal to noise in the interesting region, interesting sort of interaction space, which is these dynamic and answer promoter contacts.
00:08:54.458 - 00:09:11.162, Speaker A: And recently there have also been several studies showing that 3d fish experiments actually highly contradict high c. So you often see very nice proximal contact in fish, but you see nothing in the high C map. So there's lots of, you know, high sea isn't necessarily the ground route.
00:09:11.298 - 00:09:13.066, Speaker B: You're using the word dynamic to represent.
00:09:13.130 - 00:10:19.242, Speaker A: What, across cell types or in the same cell type across. Yeah, I would say so. I have a hypothesis that most enhancer promoter interactions are not like sticky in the sense there's lots of, there's a regulatory potential and you need a certain, maybe a number of enhancers to kind of activate a gene, and you have an ensemble of an answer that can dynamically loop back and forth to promoters or not. And that's probably one of the reasons why you do not see them as much in high c, because there is heterogeneity maybe across cells and so on. But that's just a hypothesis. Dominant interaction, that's a great question, but I think there was a nice talk also at cold spring of assistance biology this year that really showed this dramatic difference between what you see physically in microscopy and things you just do not see in the high C maps. And we've tried lots of processing strategies and I think others have tried this too, and it's very hard to pull out beyond the CDCF loops.
00:10:19.242 - 00:11:06.984, Speaker A: A lot of the other interactions you see are highly irreproducible across replicates and so on. So it's pretty difficult to get signal from that. And these are usually available only in a few cell types. So one of the strategies that folks have used to kind of learn from other kinds of data is an unsupervised learning strategy where, let's say you're given a matrix of genes in a bunch of cell types. You have, let's say rna seq expression data or DNA seq are the promoters, and then you have a bunch of enhancers that you called in the same cell types and you have some other measure of enhancer activity, let's say k four monomethylation or dnas. Then you can try to do some kind of association like testing frameworks. You can do Pearson correlation or something, and then you could permute these matrices and like a classical association test to link an ancestor, genesis.
00:11:06.984 - 00:11:34.774, Speaker A: So these are marginal association testing techniques. And I think the biggest problem generally is they're highly underpowered because you generally don't have many observations. You have just a few cell types, and so there are exponentially many. Sorry. You have a product of genes times enhancers. That's the number of tests you're trying to do, and that dramatically reduces your power. Others have used supervised approaches where you actually train on these high C or Chia pet maps.
00:11:34.774 - 00:12:03.618, Speaker A: Here's a recent paper. I think it's from Katie Polar's group. And I think one of the problems with this approach is generally the training data is very sparse. So, for example, you pick up a few thousand positive links that you can call confidently from hi C. And also these links, the features can often be cell type specific. So it's pretty hard to generalize this across the board, potentially for lots of cell types. So what we want to do is really look at what the.
00:12:03.618 - 00:12:27.094, Speaker A: Yeah, by links. By links. Like, for example, hi C interactions or Chiapad interactions, right. Between enhancers and promoters, for example. So you'll have positive links from an assay and then negative links, that is, things that don't interact versus things that interact. So you'll have a binary classification task or regression task. You throw in a bunch of features and try to predict.
00:12:27.094 - 00:13:13.114, Speaker A: So it's a supervised learning task. So what we want to do is sort of also go back to the basic assumption of what kind of relationship enhances and genes actually have. Are they, for example, linearly correlated across cell types, or do they have nonlinear behaviors in fact, what we saw very often. So this is a real interaction that we see in CD four T cells supported by geopat and various other assays and enhancer linking to the TBCC promoter. And if you just plot the gene expression data against the enhancer activity, you see in most cell types, the gene is off and the enhancer is off. So it's just a cloud of noise. And then you have some cell types in which they're both on, other cell types in which the gene is on, but the enhancer is off, and other cell types where the enhancer is on and the gene is off.
00:13:13.114 - 00:13:38.224, Speaker A: So it's clearly not a linear relationship. It's pretty on off. And the same gene can be potentially activated by other enhancers. That enhancer can potentially activate other genes. So it's kind of hinting that particular strategy. So if you use linear correlation like methods, like association metrics, then you kind of get killed pretty bad. So this promote this interaction, which is actually really strong in the Geopet data, only has a correlation of 0.4.
00:13:38.224 - 00:14:15.794, Speaker A: So we want to kind of develop a slightly different way of associating enhances of genes, sort of potentially a nonlinear metric. Okay. So we want to kind of get around this issue of enhancer activity being sparse and nonlinear. We want to build many to many maps and try to learn cell type specific links, rather than assuming that a link is invariant and sort of capturing enhancer and gene activity across cell types and developing some sort of linear correlation association metric. So this is the strategy we used. We tried to build this hierarchical probabilistic model. The basic idea is you start off with these two matrices of activity, gene activity and enhancer activity.
00:14:15.794 - 00:14:48.274, Speaker A: And you first start by learning modular behavior. So like I showed you, enhancers have this pretty nice modular behavior. So you can take advantage of that and learn sort of a latent variable space where instead of linking individual enhances to individual genes, you first learn modules of enhances and modules of genes. Then you try to link modules to modules. So now you have much fewer variables that you need to link the latent variables. Once you learn the links between the modules, then you go into these links, sorry, into these linked modules, and then you try to dissect, which enhances are linked to a gene. So it's sort of a hierarchical approach.
00:14:48.274 - 00:15:21.440, Speaker A: And for this, we use this sort of a mixed membership model. So there are two components to this model. The first is a mixed membership model, which allows enhancers to probabilistically belong to multiple modules. Okay? And this is, we use a pretty simple, well known mixed membership model called LDA latent Dirichlet allocation, which allows enhancers and genes to probabilistically belong to modules. So there are two main parameters you need to think about. The first is what we call the fractional probability. So this is the probability of observing the kth module in the teeth cell type.
00:15:21.440 - 00:16:02.100, Speaker A: So this tells you the importance of the module in a specific cell type. And then the second probability is the enhancer module membership. So that's the probability of the enhancer given the module, the latent module zk. So it's this sort of hierarchical topic model where you assume, for example, it's based on this document model. So for example, documents can be represented as mixtures of topics, hidden topics and topics are mixtures of words. And so in this case, our cell types are like documents, our enhancers and genes are like words. So we have this kind of mixed membership clustering model on the enhancer matrix and also on the gene matrix.
00:16:02.100 - 00:16:27.018, Speaker A: So the idea of this particular piece of the model is to learn the module structure in the enhancer matrix and in the gene matrix. So we have two such models. The second component tries to link these together. So the basic idea is you now have these module fraction probability. So let's say we learned the enhancer modules. Remember, we have this parameter that tells us how important that module is in each tissue. So that's this.
00:16:27.018 - 00:17:18.966, Speaker A: Similarly, for the gene modules, we have this probability of gene module being active in different tissues. So you can think of a simple metric whereby if the gene module and the enhancer module both have similar fractional probability profiles, then they are more likely to be linked. So that's the intuition behind this. And so we can try to learn a matrix, a pairwise matrix between all enhancer modules and gene modules that captures this posterior probability of a gene module being linked to an enhancer module. And so a little bit of math. But the way we try to do this is rather than looking for a global correlation, again, across all cell types, we focus on the cell type that has the highest module fractional probability for the enhancer module. So for a particular enhancer module, let's pick the cell type that has the highest fractional probability of membership.
00:17:18.966 - 00:17:40.124, Speaker A: And then for that particular cell type, just focusing on that cell type, we let all the gene modules compete for getting sort of correlated to the enhancer module. So all the gene modules are competing to try to link to the enhancer module in the cell type in which the enhancer module is most active. And we use sort of a. Yeah, can I?
00:17:41.464 - 00:18:05.988, Speaker C: Somehow your model assumes that every enhancer works independently. If you now have interactions between enhancers, then this assumption that they will correlate over cell types is, you know, won't work. So the question is, is do you try to evaluate how much this is really happening in the data or.
00:18:06.116 - 00:18:16.660, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, like I showed you. I mean, actually, we're not assuming they're independent because we are explicitly forcing them to go through this module structure. Right? So in fact, there's a lot of dependence in their activity space. Right?
00:18:16.692 - 00:18:26.388, Speaker C: So that's, I guess then I should rephrase and say that you assume that two enhancer modules are independent in your model, where you try to now tie them to the gene modules.
00:18:26.436 - 00:18:27.064, Speaker A: Yes.
00:18:27.364 - 00:18:35.300, Speaker C: So what happens if you need both of them to work in order for a gene module to turn up and down, then you wouldn't see when you make your connections.
00:18:35.412 - 00:18:54.258, Speaker A: No, you can actually link. I'll show you later. But that's not an assumption. We allow any enhancer module to link to any gene module. So we condition on. We take every enhancer module, check which cell type it is most active in through this probability, and then we allow all gene modules to compete to get access to it. So we will learn a probabilistic link.
00:18:54.258 - 00:19:37.716, Speaker A: Then we go to the next enhancer module and we again learn this. So you can have enhancer modules linked to multiple gene models. In fact, that's what we find. So effectively we are able to learn this Aij parameter that captures the linking probability between enhancer and genes. And I can give you more details on this diffusion method. It's pretty complicated, so I don't have enough time to get into it, but it allows you basically to think about looking at the enhancer module fractional probability and the gene module fractional probability. What is the likelihood that the enhancer module can diffuse across the diagonal versus diffuse out of the square? And if it's more likely to diffuse out of the diagonal, then it has a higher likelihood of interacting with the gene module.
00:19:37.716 - 00:19:40.724, Speaker A: That's basically the idea, so just an intuitive feel for it.
00:19:40.884 - 00:19:46.944, Speaker B: But haven't you already picked the cell type for which your inverse module is most probable?
00:19:47.924 - 00:19:49.542, Speaker A: Yes, diffusing.
00:19:49.598 - 00:19:53.102, Speaker B: If you have already picked the cell type, then you don't diffuse anymore.
00:19:53.238 - 00:20:18.610, Speaker A: We picked the cell type, but all the gene modules are competing. So each of these points. So the enhancer module probability is fixed, but the gene module probability switches, right? So all of those gene modules are in this map and they're all trying to diffuse across the diagonal. And the one that diffuses more quickly is the one that's more likely to be associated with the gene module. So they all compete in that sense. That make sense. Um, so we can fit this model, uh, jointly.
00:20:18.610 - 00:21:14.188, Speaker A: Instead of learning the module structure on the genes and the enhancers separately and then linking, we can use a single, uh, sort of joint Gibbs sampling approach that learns the latent module structure for the enhancers, learns it for the genes, then computes the linking probability and then re updates the, the module, uh, assignment for the enhancers in the genes and continues this iteratively until the models converge. Okay, so you simultaneously learn the module structure, use them to learn the linking, and then use the linking to update the module structure and so on. So it's an iterative process. From this you can then compute the probability that any enhancer is linked to any gene in a given tissue by simply combining these parameters. So basically you have the probability of enhancer I belonging to module k. You have the probability of module k being active in tissue t. Then you have the linking probability of enhancer module k to gene module h.
00:21:14.188 - 00:22:01.858, Speaker A: And similarly you have the membership probability of gene j in gene module h and probability of gene module H being active in the tissue t. So when you combine all of this, you marginalize out all the enhancer modules and gene modules. You can effectively get a probability for every gene linked to every enhancer condition on a specific tissue. That's how you get the probability. Now just getting the probability is not enough because you need to actually find statistically significant links. And so now what we do is once we have all these properties of associations between genes and enhancers, we focus on about one megabits based domains around genes. And then we compute a null distribution for the linking probabilities by basically shuffling either the enhancer matrix or the gene matrix.
00:22:01.858 - 00:22:11.886, Speaker A: And so you can compute a null distribution of these properties of linking and then you can compute a p value and an FDR for any specific link. Yes.
00:22:11.990 - 00:22:18.870, Speaker C: So this model up to this point is not used at all the proximity.
00:22:19.062 - 00:22:21.678, Speaker A: No, only at this stage it uses proximity.
00:22:21.766 - 00:22:32.458, Speaker C: What fraction of this falls into this stuff? Principle, you could get an answers. And genes spanning multiple chromosomes.
00:22:32.626 - 00:23:07.144, Speaker A: Absolutely, absolutely. This is mostly a choice we make because of power constraints. So the modules are helping us constrain things now because we don't have to try to link every enhancer to every gene. It's just module to module linking. But within enhancer modules and gene modules, we still have quite a few enhancers and genes and high c data and other data show that most links tend to be within tabs or at least neighboring tabs. So we're just going to focus on distal links, but not very, very long range links. So we definitely don't learn interchromosomal interactions.
00:23:07.184 - 00:23:13.364, Speaker C: For example, 2% or 80% of your mode.
00:23:15.104 - 00:23:35.004, Speaker A: So this is using all the enhancers and all the genes, but it is focusing on links that are within that distance constraint. Right. So those links would potentially be. Yeah, go ahead. Those links would potentially be a small fraction of the total number of links, maybe 10%. Yeah.
00:23:39.704 - 00:24:09.646, Speaker C: Promoter gene clusters, which is find co regulated large groups of tissue specific genes and maybe the thousands or enhancers of tissues disorder. And so within those, it's really hard to. Now, I don't know if you start now marginalizing over the different associations, could you really pick out within those groups now which specific enhancer links to which gene? Or is this more or less than just driven? Oh, in the end, after all, I just look at what are the close ones together.
00:24:09.790 - 00:24:24.184, Speaker A: So I'll show you. That's not exactly what it does. In fact, it is able to pick up these interesting, like looping across genes and things like that. So it's not just looking for proximal things. I'll show you some analysis showing how, how it compares to nearest gene and so on. I'll show that in a second.
00:24:24.924 - 00:24:31.260, Speaker B: So do you fix the number of enhancer modules or the gene modules?
00:24:31.372 - 00:24:45.784, Speaker A: Yes, you have to predefine that. Yeah, absolutely, like any other clustering method. But we play over these parameters to see what gives us the best. I'll show you that. Exactly. So we pick up 61 enhancer modules and 65 gene modules. Okay.
00:24:45.784 - 00:25:08.592, Speaker A: Across all the cell types. That's correct, yeah. So this is what the linking structure looks like. And like you were asking, you can see how multiple modules can be linked to multiple modules. So it doesn't necessarily force any single enhancer module to link only to one gene module. You can have many to many linking. And again, when we learn the module structure, we just take the modules themselves and do go annotations.
00:25:08.592 - 00:25:46.488, Speaker A: We capture really nice lineage specific terms for the enhancer modules. We also do that for the gene modules. This kind of indicating that the module learning is sort of working reasonably well because it's picking up tissue specific, lineage specific activity terms. This is just showing the number of enhancers, cell types in which an enhancer module has sort of high activity. You can see it sometimes goes up to ten. This is the enhancer module to a cell type sort of association matrix. Similarly for gene modules, the 65 gene modules is again showing you that gene modules can be active in multiple cell types and not just one cell type or anything that sort.
00:25:46.488 - 00:26:23.266, Speaker A: Even though the linking was focusing on a single cell type, the module can still be active in multiple cell types. This is the enhancer to gene module linking probability. And again, so these are gene modules, these are not genes, right. So there are rarely modules that are active in all the cell types. I mean, there's probably one module which is the main, like the ubiquitous module. So it probably has a. Yeah, I mean, I cut it off.
00:26:23.266 - 00:26:50.634, Speaker A: There are many more side types. I just wanted to show this distribution. So this is the enhancer gene module linking probability. And here you can see again that multiple enhancer modules can link to multiple genes. Okay, so an FDR of 1%, we pick up about 250,000 statistically significant enhancer to gene links linking 132,000 enhancers to 15,000 genes. That's basically what we can learn. Obviously there are many more links, but given the power we have, that's basically what we pick up.
00:26:50.634 - 00:27:34.102, Speaker A: So I just want to show you quickly some. How much time do I have? Five minutes. So of course we want to validate these links against some experimental data. So these are just aucs on his links, chia pet links and eqtls for different cell types and tissues. So these are aucs. But I also have AUPRC, sorry, precision recall curves, which are more relevant for this kind of unbalanced training. One of the reasons I don't mind showing AUC for this kind of data is because each of these data types have pretty high false negative rates because we use pretty stringent thresholds.
00:27:34.102 - 00:28:18.750, Speaker A: So the negatives are not as well defined as the positives. This is just showing that. So this just shows that we have good agreement across the board for different types of assays, including eqtls. This is showing the tissue specificity of the predicted links. So if we take our predicted links and we look at high c in different cell types, chiapar and different cell types and so on, and we look for enrichment of the predict, the tissue specific predicted links with respect to tissue specific high c, then you start seeing pretty nice tissue specific enrichment. So h one links that we predict are much more enriched in h one hi c than in other cell types. Okay, so this is sort of validating to some extent the tissue specificity of the predictions.
00:28:18.750 - 00:28:50.356, Speaker A: Same way for eqtls and for chiapad interactions. We have some immune cells and breast cancer. These are precision recall curves comparing to other methods. And again, you notice how the precision recall is actually pretty terrible across the board for all methods. And again, this may not necessarily be because the methods suck, or it could be because the methods suck, including ours. But I think it's more to do with the data just having not being an actual gold standard. The positives are pretty well defined, the negatives not so much.
00:28:50.356 - 00:29:24.244, Speaker A: Either way, our LDA method actually does generally better precision recall than most other methods we haven't compared to the latest, two of the latest methods, which we are going to add to this pretty soon. These are some properties of the long range enhancer gene network. So the key thing to notice is generally each gene is linked to. We find multiple enhancers. Here's an example of. These are super enhancers. So many enhancers, our definition of enhancers are small hypersensitive units, right? So you can have 30, 40 of them in a super enhancer linking to genes.
00:29:24.244 - 00:30:03.978, Speaker A: So that's sort of the distribution. So many enhancers link to a gene, each enhancer can often link to multiple genes, of course, an exponential distribution. But sometimes an enhancer can link to up to ten genes and there's a nice distance distribution which supports sort of what you also see in high C data and so on. Yeah, but then after that we can get links between individual enhancer engine. So this is based on that final statistic. The key point is that the enhanced gene network is highly connected. 56% of the links are specific to one lineage.
00:30:03.978 - 00:30:37.544, Speaker A: I think what's most interesting is even though half of the predicted links are within 50 kb of each other, only one third are actually linked to the nearest gene. Okay, so that's pretty interesting. So many of them actually skip the nearest gene. And I think others have also found this in other kinds of prediction methods. I'll skip this slide with just showing you an example of, for example, an eQTl right here that skips the nearest gene, the two nearest genes, and goes all the way to this particular gene. Right. And we have a link that supports this eQdl quite nicely.
00:30:37.544 - 00:31:37.374, Speaker A: Since I'm running out of time, I'm going to skip this part and just jump to something more interesting, which is how we can use these modules to actually infer target genes of non coding variants. So somebody asked a question about whether it was how does this compare to the nearest gene linking? So you can take an enhancer and link into the nearest gene. So the enhancer may contain a non coding variant for GWAS variant and link it to its nearest gene versus link it to a gene that we predict as being the target of that enhancer. And so you'll notice that if you then take those genes and you do go enrichments, we've done this for almost 100 GWAS studies. If you look at the overall sort of the q values of the go terms, you'll notice that the linking method actually gives you better q values than the nearest gene method. So overall there is a better pathway enrichment. When you use our links, then make the assumption of nearest gene.
00:31:37.374 - 00:32:12.420, Speaker A: Now, I'll show you three case studies real quick. The first is colorectal cancer. So we had a nice GWAS dataset for colorectal cancer from the Gecko consortium. So we just take all the top GWAS SNP's with p value less than ten to the minus five. We expand this list because these are tag SNP's, we expand them in LD using an r square of 0.8. Then we use find all enhancers that overlap any of these snp's, the SNP's in LD, and we link them to the genes using our links that we predict in CRC specific tissues. So colon rectal mucosa and so on.
00:32:12.420 - 00:33:04.664, Speaker A: When we do this, starting with almost 5000 snp's, because we use a pretty relaxed p value, we're not only looking at the genome wide significant hit list, we end up with only 76 genes. And these are actually a really nice list of genes, many of them lamin genes and so on, very well known to be associated with colorectal cancer. And in fact, if you take those genes and run them through go enrichment, we pick up SMAD signaling, TGF beta integrin, pretty well known to have important roles in colorectal cancer. Here's a nice example of also how we can do this for HDL cholesterol. Here's the SNP. And you'll notice how the predicted link jumps the two nearest genes, BUD 13 and ZNF 259. And this enhancer is predicted to link to all the apo apoa apoc apoa genes.
00:33:04.664 - 00:33:47.188, Speaker A: And those genes have been known to actually be involved in hdl cholesterol lipid metabolism. And the last case study is to do with ulcerative colitis. So this is a novel association. It has a pretty nice p value and it's potentially a causal step based on this fix probability. So the SNP has been potentially linked as being causal for ulcerative colitis, but the target gene has not been identified so far. And what we find is, in this case, of course, it seems to link to the nearest gene, but it is 50 kb, at least 50 kb away. And this gene, in fact does have an important role, sort of in some kind of membrane protein.
00:33:47.188 - 00:34:27.712, Speaker A: It's specifically active in intestinal cells. And so we have a cell type, of target cell type. We have a target gene and a target, a causal targets SNP. So just to give you a few examples of how we are able to link these, use the links to essentially infer tissue specificity of a non coding variant and also the target genes associated with it. Yeah. So I'll just end there and state briefly that we have an all probabilistic model for linking enhancers to genes in unsupervised fashion from coden expression dynamics. Um, we get pretty high resolution predictions, uh, which are validated by experiment data to some extent.
00:34:27.712 - 00:35:08.384, Speaker A: Uh, the enhancers are pretty important for explaining cell type specific regulation. I skipped these slides, but, um, uh, we find multiple genes are often regulated by more than one enhancer and often different ones in different cell types. So very linear specific linking, uh, majority of enhancers actually do not. We do not find them looping to their nearest, nearest promoters. And I skipped this slide as well. But we find enhancement promoters to be enriched for transcription factor motifs that are known to have strong protein, protein interactions. So that would be one mechanism by which the looping happens and the links are predictive of target genes and pathways affected by non coding variants.
00:35:08.384 - 00:35:28.380, Speaker A: So I'll just stop there and thank Jianrong for building these models, patented some of the analysis for the disease variants. And this was originally in collaboration with menolaus. Thanks. One or two questions and then just.
00:35:28.412 - 00:35:30.580, Speaker B: Keep the genes, are they expressed?
00:35:30.732 - 00:35:51.134, Speaker A: Yes. I showed you the example of. Yeah, right here. So this is Bud 13, right. It's in fact ubiquitously expressed in all the cell types. Here's the enhancer. You can see it's very specific to liver fg two and fetal intestine, classical tissues associated with lipid metabolism.
00:35:51.134 - 00:36:10.414, Speaker A: Here's the promoter of APOC three, also perfectly coordinated activity. You can see it's again very lineage tissue specific. So it's not the classical linear activation. So correlation metrics like linear or spearmin will fail pretty miserable here. And so you want some of these kind of metrics that capture on off like activity.
00:36:14.214 - 00:36:24.126, Speaker C: So there's a lot of tissue specificity that you're finding here. But have you actually tested it? So have you taken a cell line where you expect this enhancer to be active and one where you expect it to not be active and actually done.
00:36:24.150 - 00:36:36.734, Speaker A: The CRISPr experiment yeah. We've just finished with those. With a collaborator. I don't have an answer for you yet, but we'll see. Let's thank both of the speakers in this session.
