00:00:01.440 - 00:00:54.994, Speaker A: Good afternoon. First of all, I want to thank the organizers for giving me this great opportunity to come up here and talk about our work. And today, yes, I want to talk about comparative networks, network analysis, to understand how protein interactions and protein networks evolve. Speaking evolution is a big theme in biological research. A lot of people have talked about even just today here to go through sort of, because sequencing, of course, it's the first large scale data that we have, biological data that we have, and it still is the most abundant data sequencing with next gen sequence. So comparative genomics is one of the approach. People study evolution and it's been really very, very important and continue to be important.
00:00:54.994 - 00:01:45.894, Speaker A: But again, I seen this same picture actually this morning, so it shows the stability of Google searches. So anyway, but the point has been made also by multiple speakers, just even today, that everything is in the sequence. So you have to look at the network. And so the next sort of methods people have been doing is comparative functional genomics. Like again, people have talked about genetic networks and comparative, actually even comparative analysis of genetic interaction networks, which again is very, very important and continue to be important. But let me just say, genetic interaction is not a physiological process in the cell. So two genes can have a genetic interaction for many reasons.
00:01:45.894 - 00:02:34.164, Speaker A: Also, when you do comparisons, it could be that there is a genetic interaction that there or not there because a gene lost a redundant copy in one of the species. So that can give you some interpretation difficulties. So what we really want to do is we want to directly compare function, right? So to speak, comparative functionomics, right. And the way we do it is we want to look at interaction, how interactions evolve. Because number one, protein interaction, protein, protein interaction is protein function. And number two, most proteins, even transcription factors, have to bind other cofactors to carry out their function. So understanding interaction is very, very important to understand their function.
00:02:34.164 - 00:03:40.046, Speaker A: And this, looking at the evolution of protein interactions and protein interaction networks is not a new problem, not at all. People have been trying to look at this, especially since for ten years now, we have networks in yeast, fly, human and worm people have been trying to do comparative analysis just for, for the interaction network. But again, it's been very useful, but success has been very, very limited, actually, surprisingly, just because overlaps are very, very sparse between this network. I remember one of the first papers in nature genetics find only 16 interactions are shared between the four species. So you cannot do any statistics using only 16 pairs. So I think the problem is none of these networks, our whole protein scale, so not all of the proteins they have even tested and number two and I will get to even more, is that our technology, we realize, have a huge false negative issue. So we don't detect a lot of the interactions.
00:03:40.046 - 00:04:18.964, Speaker A: So even you test the interaction of protein, not all the interactors are found. And also these are huge, from budding yeast to all of these, they're 1.5 billion and above years apart. So you really need to have comprehensive maps at appropriate evolutionary distance and generated by the same technology. Again, people are trying to do this comparison by combine all of the interactions in the literature for other purposes. That is good because that improves your coverage. But the interaction in the literature are detected by different essays, completely different essays, co ip and mass.
00:04:18.964 - 00:04:47.382, Speaker A: And they all have different false positive and false negative rates. And I will show you where later on most of this, actually almost all of them, you don't know, as one of the speakers actually talk about today. So you cannot plug them into the equation that I'm going to show you. You cannot calculate them. So we really need to use the same technology. And you know the false positive and false negative rates, right. So my lab is really a systems biology lab, although I'm in the biostatistic department at Cornell.
00:04:47.382 - 00:05:27.156, Speaker A: So we do experiments and our primary screen methods is y two h. And I want to, you know, I know different people have different opinions on y two h, so I just want to talk a little bit about y two h. So first of all, we have y two h is really huge scale. So we can do 1 million protein pairs screened per person per week. So that's a scale that none other methods comes even close. And so we believe we published slew papers on this, that y two h, at least our version of the y two h is actually very high quality. And I will show you more data, hopefully can convince you.
00:05:27.156 - 00:06:06.320, Speaker A: And also the problem really is we've realized this for more than ten years now. The effort led by actually my postdoc like Mark Vidal at Harvard, he realized that at the early on, the Drusophila network, the early the y two h network in yeast are all done. A lot of those are done by using cdna libraries. So there's a whole host of other reasons. But using cdna libraries is very dangerous because we realize. So what we do is we use orf clone. So for each gene we generate a specific clone, one clone, and we sequence verify.
00:06:06.320 - 00:06:39.870, Speaker A: So we know the sequence is right and we test it. And then the reason for y two is through this y two h process, because it's a very harsh selection. So it's a life and death selection. So proteins that don't interact, if two proteins don't interact, the cell dies. That's just very simple. So cell wants to live, right? So it's evolution. So we realize, oftentimes proteins that don't interact under normal, actually don't interact, will accumulate mutations so that they can interact and they can survive in our screen.
00:06:39.870 - 00:07:16.230, Speaker A: So to get rid of that, what we do is after the screen, we go back to a frozen copy of those columns and we retest them. And we actually, by doing that, we get rid of half of our hits. It's actually a huge loss. We would want to have that so that I can report double the size of the network. But you see, if you use CDN library, because you don't have a specific library for each gene, you can't do that. So you cannot do that. And also the representation in CDN libraries is dictated by the expression levels in the cell, right? So that has a huge bias, so creates all kinds of problems.
00:07:16.230 - 00:07:54.144, Speaker A: And there's some other things that we've developed. So we believe our version is very, very good. In fact, if you go back to the Drusophila network and the early y two eight east network, one practice and we've decided not to do anymore, is they always report a core set and a non core set. For the early east, for example, the nature 2000 paper, it was a core set is 800 interactions, which is solid. And then they have a non core set, it's a 3000 interactions. And the difference between the two data set is how many times they see it in their screen. And the fact the 3000 is they don't see it again, they only see it one time.
00:07:54.144 - 00:08:19.582, Speaker A: So the fact that they only see the one time, if you get rid of that 800, we've actually tested using independent essays to show is actually pretty good quality. Yes. The second time you do it and it's not positive, then you throw it out. Yes. So how much are you, how many positives are you losing by doing that? Half. So for. Yeah, so for.
00:08:19.582 - 00:08:42.222, Speaker A: Yeah, half, half. Yeah. So 50% chance. We use also very stringent, very stringent criteria. I mean, it depends on. So, because we do the second screen, so the first time around, we can go a little bit, sort of the threshold can be a little bit lower and then we use the second threshold higher. So, but so the way we do it, we lose half.
00:08:42.222 - 00:09:05.628, Speaker A: I mean, I would definitely want to keep that as a non core so that we can report a bigger number. But we don't do that, it's gone. What fraction are you losing that you wouldn't want to lose? Oh, that, I will show you that we lose a lot. Yes, I will show you that kind of. Yeah, so the false negative rate you're getting to. Yeah, so anyway, so let me hopefully. Yeah, so hopefully I can go through the talk.
00:09:05.628 - 00:09:55.194, Speaker A: Anyway, so as a postdoc. So I've been fortunate to be involved in these two networks, the bunnies and the human, but it's still the most, the only proteome scale screens that we've ever done in eukaryotes and my humans. Actually, Mark just published a cell paper about a year ago, so that becomes the most comprehensive. Anyway, so we want to, because we did this budding yeast, so we need to do a well controlled, systematic cross species interactome comparison. And we decided to use pong bee because it's much closer, it's related yeast species to budding yeast. And so we want to do this kind of comparison. And orphume is already available, so we don't have to spend years to just clone these 500 proteins from the genome.
00:09:55.194 - 00:10:34.226, Speaker A: So my talk today, I want to talk about first, just we build the first protein wide network for fish and yeast and the biological insights I really want to show you guys this we get from that. And then the second part is comparative network analysis. And we did to show evolutionary insights. So we did it. So there is 5000 proteins, right? We screened 5000 by 5003 times. So that's 75 million pairs tested and we found only really it's not even. So the reward is varying.
00:10:34.226 - 00:11:07.078, Speaker A: So it's 2300 interactions for 1300 proteins. So we throw out a lot. But if you look at this, so it covers a wide range of different cellular processes and about half of it is novel, it never reported in any other species before. And 700 of those novel involves orthogonal in humans. So it kind of really tells you human biology. Right. So of course the first question is just published a couple months ago, so we're very happy and, you know about quality.
00:11:07.078 - 00:11:53.754, Speaker A: So one thing we show, so the way we do this is we pick a large positive control set and a large random pairs as our negative control set. And first we test y two h. And you can see. So again, our version of y two h actually does not suffer through high false positive rate at all. We didn't detect any from those random pairs, so, but the problem really is from about 100 multiple lab independently validated interactions, we were only able to find about a little bit more than 20%. So 80% of the interactions out there, even if we test it, we won't find it. So that is really the problem.
00:11:53.754 - 00:12:16.944, Speaker A: So that's really a problem. That's for any other essays. So we have this fission net, we call this fission net. And so to test it, we use another independent assay. So it has nothing to do with y two h, which is the PC, is protein complementation assay. Basically you have two fragments of the YFP. You fuse that with your protein interest, X and Y.
00:12:16.944 - 00:12:39.314, Speaker A: And if X and Y interact, you reconstitute a functional YFP. Right? And this is done in mammalian cells. So it completely has nothing to do with yeast cells. And you can see, again, that also has sort of sensitivity issues. Right. And. But when we test it using this component independent methods, we show our fission that and the positive controls are the same quality.
00:12:39.314 - 00:13:21.894, Speaker A: Also, in any of these networks, we all know there is hubs. Biologists often say, oh, these hubs maybe tend to be more noisy. That is also not the case either. We find the same quality that really shows systematically that we have a good quality. But really, can we learn new biology from this network and the way. So we sort of picked this example, which is heat shock gene regulation by ATF one. So ATF one binds constitutively to all of the ATF one is the major regulator, transfusion factor in fission yeast, regulating all the heat shock genes.
00:13:21.894 - 00:14:02.874, Speaker A: But ATF one constitutively bind to all of the promoters of the heat shock genes, even under normal conditions. Right. So there's a question of the control. So just a couple years ago, there's a paper published saying they didn't find any physical link, but they found that dicer one somehow is involved in these heat shock genes. They say that dicer one involves in repression of these heat shock genes under normal conditions. And then under heat shock, dicer one is transported outside of the nucleus and relief of the repression. And therefore these heat shock genes can respond to heat stress, but they found no physical link.
00:14:02.874 - 00:14:36.238, Speaker A: So. Well, let's just. So the reason, so we picked this example is not, it's very actually systematic, because we want to find new biology. We want to find biology that using really show the power of an interactome network, right? So we want to find, we want to follow up on interactions that connects two well studied pathways and modules. So we did clustering and we look at connect novel interactions never seen before, connecting two well studied modules. So not that many, actually, we found. So this is one of this.
00:14:36.238 - 00:15:08.824, Speaker A: So, on one hand, you have stress response. All these interactions found by y two h and has been studied to death in the literature. So people know stat one, regulate ATF one, all of these. And on the other hand is the RDRC complex that's involved in RNAi pathways without boring with this evolves in the gene silencing at the centromere region. Okay, it's a major player in there. And again, we found these interactions in y two h. And this complex is well established before us, but this interaction has never been shown before.
00:15:08.824 - 00:15:44.666, Speaker A: Right? So our hypothesis is, oh, since this paper didn't find a physical ink between dicer one and this, and this complex actually turns nascent single strand rna into double strand rna. Provide substrate for dicer one. Dicer one only works with double strand rna. So we say, oh, maybe this is the physical link. This is where ATF one can recruit the RNAi machinery to their heat shock gene target regions, which is really cool, never been shown before in vivo. So this is our hypothesis. First, of course we did, because our y two h is done embedding its cells.
00:15:44.666 - 00:16:20.592, Speaker A: These are fixing its proteins. But we do it, the y two H is done embodying its cells. So we say, okay, does it even happen in vivo? So we show use coip in fitness. So the in vivo coip shows this interaction does happen in vivo in fitness cells. And we also show to do this kind of look at the mRNA level, gene expression levels, we show that delete dicer one, you relieve, right, when you, in normal conditions, dicer one is required to repress this gene. Delete dicer one, gene expression increases. Same thing if you delete c twelve also increases.
00:16:20.592 - 00:17:03.362, Speaker A: But double deletion, you don't increase any more significantly. So it shows diced twelve is working the same pathway for this purpose. And then I want to go one step further. And my student really hate me for this. So I said, okay, if we're convinced this is the physical link, because this is the only link we could find in our network and in the literature, to link this two path of RNAi and this ATF one, heat shock gene regulation. If this is only the real link, if we break this link, we should be able to separate these two pathways. Another part of my lab is to do these kind of using structural modeling and others to model mutation effects.
00:17:03.362 - 00:17:41.624, Speaker A: So I told the students, can you come up with three candidates on sig twelve that specific losing interaction with h one, but still binds RDP one, hr one, keep the integrity of RDRC. He looked at me saying, you know it's not going to work, right? I said, well, let's just try it. So we came up with two, he came up using our preliminary, sort of a pipeline, three mutations. And lo and behold, two of them worked exactly as we have predicted. Right? So Brics specifically, this interaction, ATF one and c twelve, but keeps the integrity of the RDRC complex. Right. The third one doesn't have any effects.
00:17:41.624 - 00:18:19.130, Speaker A: So again, so here we show the hi shock gene regulation. So these two mutants, do they still can regulate hi shock genes, right? Basically, we show that in the c twelve deletion strain, these genes are overexpressed. If you overexpress wild type c twelve in the c twelve deletion strain, of course, you rescue that, right? So these genes level goes back down. But if you over express these two point mutation, they do not have the ability to regulate those t shock genes anymore. They keep highly expressed. So that's really cool. Shows that, okay.
00:18:19.130 - 00:19:01.776, Speaker A: If you lose this interaction, you lose this regulation, again, shows this is the recruitment point. So what about the RDRC's function as an RNI pathway factor? What about the centromere silencing? So basically there is a strain that has been developed by another lab who is graciously shared with us. And so basically insert your URL four reporter into the centromere. And so, under normal conditions, centromere region, no gene is expressed. So the URL four is not expressed. And if URL four is not expressed, the cells are not sensitive to five foa. So this is a reverse selection, right.
00:19:01.776 - 00:19:44.734, Speaker A: Under normal conditions, if you just express a vector, it's expressed. But if you delete c twelve, central is expressed because it's required, Rnai is required so that the cell becomes very sensitive to 504 a. If you overexpose a wild type c twelve in the cell c twelve deletion, you rescues that so they can grow again. And when we over express the two point mutation, it behaves just like the wild type at the centromere region. Right. So that we show by creating a point mutation specifically disrupts this interaction. We can separate our c twelve's function at the heat shock t locus loci and at the centromere locus.
00:19:44.734 - 00:20:33.370, Speaker A: So it's really very cool as it shows that our theory is ATF one recruits, physically binds and recruits the RDRC complex to these heat shock gene loci and basically recruit the whole Rnai pathway to these loci's. And under normal conditions, shut down the expression of these heat shock genes. And heat can. We have different theory. But this is the publication of that paper is that heat will dislocate the Dyson one out of the nucleus and then relief of these heat shock gene can be expressed under heat stress. Right? So we call this sort of transcription activator, recruitment of RaI tar for gene silencing. Right? So we were quite excited about this.
00:20:33.370 - 00:21:07.154, Speaker A: So I just want to say, so this is basically the first part. We actually have about five or six examples like this. All find, use my criteria, looking for connections between known pathways, and they are all validated. And we didn't test that many to get to those five or six examples, we only tested no more than ten examples. We start with. So the hit rate is much higher than I thought. So I really think these networks can be very helpful if you use it correctly.
00:21:07.154 - 00:21:57.110, Speaker A: Now, we have this network. Can we compare it to the budding is on the human network, right? So we have the three networks. The one question we want to know is, oh, how, you know, everybody asks this, right? How is the interactions are conserved, how many interactions are conserved between the species, right? And many publications have published looking at this question, of course, very, to do this, people say, oh, it's easy. You take the interactions to 2300 interactions in fission east. You look at how many of them are in human, how many of them in budding yeast, that is your conservation rate. But that's not right, because we know that 80% of the real interaction are network. None of these networks are complete.
00:21:57.110 - 00:22:38.604, Speaker A: They're actually 80% incomplete. So you can't just do that directly. Another speaker also earlier talked about this. You really need to. So, but a lot of paper has published that way. And so anyway, so really what we want to get, the conservation rate really is sort of this probability, right? Is if you have interaction in a species two, what is sort of our observed, sort of, if you just do the direct overlap, that fraction really is the probability of you observe an interaction in specific species two by y two h, in species one. That is not the conservation rate.
00:22:38.604 - 00:23:03.806, Speaker A: But you can actually expand this this way. And now this is your underlying conservation rate is interaction in species two. Also interaction in species one. That is really the conservation rate we want to get. And it turns out. So we just need to calculate. We have this, this is the observed conservation rate, if you wish, and we want to get to that.
00:23:03.806 - 00:23:54.202, Speaker A: We just need to be able to measure or estimate these things, right? So, turns out we can estimate that, right? So for this, for example, if we make this, I think is a very reasonable assumption, is if I have an interaction in species one, the probability of I detecting that interaction in species one really doesn't have anything to do with whether it's going to have it's interacting in another species. Right. It's just. So if I make that assumption, and also I know that the conservation rate or the rewiring rate interaction in species two, not an interaction in species one, just one minus this, right? So this is very simple. We can actually solve this, right? So this is our true conservation rate. This is our observed conservation rate. And these are just basically false positive and false negative rates of y two h in these species.
00:23:54.202 - 00:24:09.962, Speaker A: And we can measure all of these using the positive and negative controls. So we solve this and we can even estimate the error in our estimate using delta methods. Right? So we can do all of this. So we can actually vary. So. And we did that. Right? So we did that.
00:24:09.962 - 00:24:51.424, Speaker A: But before I show you the interaction conservation rate, I just want to remind you, this is basically the gene conservation rate or genomic sequence similarity relationship or evolutionary relationship between these species, right. Clearly, the two yeasts are much more related. 80% of the genes are shared between the two species, and they are further, they're both further away from human only. I think 60% or 55% of genes are shared between human and either yeasts. So human is the out group here, based on the sequence. So first calculate this. Palm b, conservative interactions in budding east, we got about 40%.
00:24:51.424 - 00:25:10.664, Speaker A: It's one point we don't know what to make of this. Next, we look at pound b to human. Remember, these conservation rates are actually directional. So interactions, 70% of them will be conserved in humans. So much higher than pung bee in budding.
00:25:12.824 - 00:25:17.968, Speaker B: How do you compute your monitoring? Do you simply take the best blast metro or something?
00:25:18.136 - 00:25:33.056, Speaker A: So we used multiple things to look at the. So, orthology is basically we use in paranoid. We use in paranoid. We also have palm base, for example, for palm and human palm. And budding is we always take the.
00:25:33.080 - 00:25:37.328, Speaker B: Community, several candidates for a homolog. You simply consider all of them?
00:25:37.376 - 00:25:56.804, Speaker A: Oh, yes. For this calculation, I'm pretty sure. So, yeah, reviewer also raised that question. Yes, so we did. So this one, we just compare. We just consider all of them. But there is one figure, it's the same exact figure where we only use the one to one orthogonal, so that there's no question of multiple mapping.
00:25:56.804 - 00:26:18.456, Speaker A: Yes, so that's a good question. And so we show this. Okay, so that's surprising. And then we look at. But budding is the human also 70%. Budding is to pungy, also 70% human to pound bee, 70%. But human to ceresia, again goes down to 45%.
00:26:18.456 - 00:26:45.818, Speaker A: Right. So basically, based on this, our explanation is that basically. So budding is a very good model organism. What you learned can be equally well, you know, apply to human as well as fish and yeast. However, there are functions like the RNAi we talked about, you just cannot study. So there's a lot of interactions has been lost or functions has been lost in budding yeast. So.
00:26:45.818 - 00:27:12.240, Speaker A: So to study those, you have to use fishing yeast. But whatever you learn in budding yeast is, is actually pretty good, right? So, you know, so many functions shared between fishing and human, but not symptoms, right? Such as rnai. We know buddies doesn't have RNai, so. Okay, so. All right, so speaking of. So this conservation. So speaking of conservation, actually, I tend to think there's this sort of paradox, so to speak.
00:27:12.240 - 00:27:57.572, Speaker A: That is, whenever we talk about conservation, conservation, especially in comparative genomics, right, have this sense of not change. Conserve means it's not changed. And in comparative genomics, we look at sequences, literally, it means the sequence has not changed. However, we also know that many proteins, even if they have conservative interactions, they evolve new interactions. They carry out novel functions in the new species. So, being repurposed to a degree, they keep their old function, but they also have new function. So what is that all about? So, because we have all these clones, so we can literally test perform, which I'm very excited about, these cross species mappings.
00:27:57.572 - 00:28:57.644, Speaker A: So we can take, basically we can ask if we know ab and a prime, b prime are conservative interactions in the two species. What about if I test a's ability to bind b prime and a prime's ability to bind b? Like I said, all these species are separated by hundreds of millions of years and billions of years, right? So this is basically a date billions of years in the making, right? So I'm very excited about this. So we did this, we did all of these and then. So if they still keep interaction, this is. You mean that means that the interface between a and b has been kept for the billion year, but if they don't, means that they have co evolved, even though the interaction is conserved, the interface has coevolved, has changed, so they cannot recognize their partner from a billion years ago. And if you have to really think about it in evolution, about. Because co evolution, you need the two proteins to change coordinately.
00:28:57.644 - 00:29:38.090, Speaker A: If we think about, it's not easy at all. And we don't have a lot of. We do have example, but don't have a lot of examples of co evolved interaction problems between species, right? So my expectation is this should be relatively rare, but that's actually not what happened here. Right? We found actually almost half of the conservative interactions for both the east pair and fishing east to human has been, the conservative interaction has been co evolved. Right. And that actually agrees with our human work. And other people have shown this is to rewind, to change the interaction interface.
00:29:38.090 - 00:29:58.442, Speaker A: One mutation, oftentimes is enough to do it. Right. So even though the amino acid for a given pair, it's very hard to co evolve. But the protein is large and interface is large. Right. So you only need one pair. Oftentimes it's enough to change the interface enough so that the ortholog cannot recognize it anymore.
00:29:58.442 - 00:30:33.812, Speaker A: Right. So that's actually really interesting. And that explains how they can potentially, these have at least, can potentially now accommodate a new interface. And so this is an example where so these ram one, ram two, and CDC 43 are three subunits are the farnesole transfer rates in subunits, three subunits of farnesose transferase in the budding yeast. And it's very important for post translational modification of proteins in cell cycle control. People know that. And you can see we recompute, all these interactions work very well in our hands.
00:30:33.812 - 00:30:58.566, Speaker A: The pong b ones also work in our hands, but the cross species ones, none of them work. So go ahead. Oh, all right. So, sure. And we found this, and we look at the literature, we realize people have actually done the budding, because there are so many studies in budding. People have done this study. They show that if you delete Ram two and you overexplained, you have defects over, you have CWP one.
00:30:58.566 - 00:31:33.126, Speaker A: The ortholog of fissioning does not rescue. So Arnold perfectly explains their observation, which is really cool. This is an example of, well, I don't have time, but I just want to show that we can also use this to really study gene duplication, because gene duplication really is a major source of genetic novelty through evolution. And all vertebrates has gone through at least two rounds of whole genome duplication. And the small scale point duplication is continuous. Right. So, and I just.
00:31:33.126 - 00:32:19.604, Speaker A: Yeah. Anyway, so I don't have time to go through this, but basically, there has been a lot of studies about, you know, what happens after gene duplication. Right. Of course, at the very beginning is functional redundancy because you have two identical copies, but then you could have sub functionalization versus neon functionalization. So far, people, you know, in the rhabdopsis or in yeast, because you only have one interactome, they often just look at how many interactions are shared between parallels, which gets to the point of functional redundancy really. There is no experimental data about sub function, the degree to which you have sub functionalization and neo functionalization. And we know bunny has gone through a whole genome duplication, but they also have of course, sort of point a gene specific duplications.
00:32:19.604 - 00:33:19.254, Speaker A: So we can now, and we have the fission yeast. So we can use basically the fission yeast as outgroup to get about the subfunctionalization and the neo functionalization. I don't have time to go through them, but basically we show that whole genome duplication lead to more functional redundancy. We believe, and there's literature support that the stoichiometry comes into play because everything is duplicated versus small scale gene specific or segment duplications lead to more sort of genetic novelty, if you wish, more sub functionalization and or neo functionalization. And I think that can have a major impact because all vertebrates, as I said, gone through these. So basically, just to summarize, we've done this network, we believe it's high quality, lead us to. To find a couple of new gene regulation factors actually Rai and mRNA splicing, and also can help us to do comparative network analysis.
00:33:19.254 - 00:33:45.874, Speaker A: And all the work are done by my students and technicians and postdocs and my collaborators and my funding agencies. And. Thank you, thank you so much. Please. You clean your network. You had this initial screen, which was quite liberal. And then you have second screen, which perhaps, as I understand was little bit for some of it was independent and then was more stringent.
00:33:45.874 - 00:34:02.324, Speaker A: Have you been ever tempted to do independent second screen and then compare, you know what? Yes, yes. So we have done it at mark where I got trained, as opposed to also have done it. So there is very, very, very consistent. Yeah. So you do. Yes, very, very consistent. Yeah.
00:34:02.324 - 00:34:25.404, Speaker A: Once you do that, it's very, very consistent. It's very, very consistent. I don't. Yeah, yeah. Your estimation of conservation rate. Yeah. So the error estimation will be depending on your right.
00:34:25.404 - 00:35:13.712, Speaker A: But that specific, the conservation rate is not because the error is because that ties into if we test 100 pairs versus, in our gold standard, versus we have 1000 pairs in our standards, our error estimation will be different. The thousand pairs can give us a better error estimation, but the estimation of the conservation rate is not dependent on the pair, on the size of the gold standard. But actually, have you done this kind of power analysis? Let you only use a smaller portion of what we know and see how that would be great because as I said, our gold standard. So there are two things. Number one is fishing yeast is really the forgotten yeast, I have to say. Right. So in my grand application, actually, I wrote that is you have.
00:35:13.712 - 00:35:43.060, Speaker A: I want to begin this. You have about 80,000 high quality binary direct interactions reported by all kinds of resources in the literature. Just go to any database in budding east, but in Pungvi, only at time like five years ago, it's 142, I remember in fishing east, so I can't. Yeah, it's not like I have a thousand. So that I can do that I would love. And also, that's the one reason I just don't have that many. Also, these experiments are not as easy as a sequel, as a sequencing.
00:35:43.060 - 00:36:12.834, Speaker A: So we're trying to develop methods as well. So these are still pretty tedious to do that, but that would be interesting to look at. Please. So could you tell the part, the ones that co evolve from the ones that remain consistent, like when you cross state them, they still bind. Yeah, based on the experiments we can tell. Did you find any features that could. We haven't looked into that yet, and that's something we can.
00:36:12.834 - 00:37:03.362, Speaker A: I mean, I think one thing we didn't notice is the interface conservation. So I didn't have time, so we didn't look into that a little. So interface, for example, the conservation is much better between this intact versus. I mean, that's almost a given, right? Because so they're just. And actually one thing I didn't show is actually is interesting is that for those intact interactions between the fissionese and human, we can actually clone. So we know, because Mark and I, we've done a lot of these and Marianne done a lot of these cloned mutation, disease mutation for the human proteins and look at whether, how they disrupt the interactions. We clone the same human mutation into the fission yeast protein, the same exact mutation, and it disrupts the same exact set of interactions in fishing yeast for those intact ones, for the rewired ones, we can't even find because they don't even align anymore.
00:37:03.362 - 00:37:05.534, Speaker A: Yeah. So it's actually pretty cool.
00:37:06.634 - 00:37:17.898, Speaker B: I'm still puzzled by the results on the conservation between the species. The two yeasts are not as conserved as yeast and human, if I understood correctly the graphs, yes.
00:37:17.986 - 00:37:20.082, Speaker A: In terms of the interaction conservation, yes.
00:37:20.178 - 00:37:27.570, Speaker B: So how do you explain it? Could it be that because the human network is much bigger, then somehow your estimates were biased?
00:37:27.602 - 00:37:47.934, Speaker A: But even with the human ones, is this. How would that bias. I don't see, because we do the same compression, so we have the fishing needs to human and human to fishing and fishing to buny and human to buddies. I don't see how they. So that is a concern. So we look at it. The detection rate are the same in all these three species.
00:37:47.934 - 00:38:00.954, Speaker A: The false positive, false negative rates using positive negative control sets. In the species, we have three sets of positive and negative controls. They all behaving very similarly. Yeah.
00:38:01.574 - 00:38:05.314, Speaker B: Motivating us and saying that the twists are very close. That's why.
00:38:06.854 - 00:38:24.558, Speaker A: Yeah, so, yeah, so that's. So that's. So for the. That's also something of a debate, actually. Yeah. So there is people. So basically, the estimation is 400 million years to 1 billion years.
00:38:24.558 - 00:38:43.562, Speaker A: Depends on who you talk to. The more genetic, molecular biology, biochemistry. People believe there are 400. They're very close. You don't need to study fishing yeast if you understand everything in budding yeast, it's the same in fishing yeast. But if you talk to evolutionary biologists, they believe it's like a billion years apart. They are as far away as human and yeast.
00:38:43.562 - 00:39:09.120, Speaker A: So there is this difference of opinion. But regardless, I think it's just what we saw. I mean, this is the result, what we saw. And the explanation we can come with. Come up with to fit that, you know, like a parsimony explanation is just that there's a lot of interactions that are shared between human and the fishing yeast that are simply lost. Like Rei, which we know in the budding yeast lineage. I think we should.
00:39:09.120 - 00:39:13.344, Speaker A: We should. We should take it to the great things. Thank you.
