00:00:00.120 - 00:00:48.704, Speaker A: And I have a few experiments to show that, which were done by a PhD student, Daniel Martin, who's now graduated. So I like my spare time to draw pictures of the world and things I see around me and also take pictures with my camera at the same time, just so I have it for reference later. And around five years ago, I started to notice that I would take, you know, compare my photograph to my drawing and think, well, they depict space very differently. And my first thought is, well, I'm not a very good artist. But then I look at the picture on the screen and say, well, actually, a picture on the screen also doesn't really depict my experience of the world very well at all. There's lots of things about that I don't like either. And so that sent me down this long process of trying to think about how does work when we look at pictures on the screen, we look at 3d in the world, because I'd always been confused about this ever since my art classes.
00:00:48.704 - 00:01:25.366, Speaker A: And so that's what I want to talk about here. How do we understand shape and space in pictures? And I'll also have a few things to say about how we do it in the real world, because these things are very tightly connected. So I specifically want to focus on projections and pictures. And the famous one is linear perspective, invented in the Renaissance, and it was really invented as a technique for drawing pictures. You set down some vanishing points and draw some straight lines, and it's a technique that can produce very realistic senses of space. When it was first developed, the Renaissance artists had to figure out how to use it effectively. So here we have kind of like a bunch of billboards on a matrix like backdrop.
00:01:25.366 - 00:02:03.302, Speaker A: And over the years, they figured out techniques to integrate people into architecture in ways that felt more real and more convincing. And now, linear perspective, as we all know, is the basis of most of our photography and most of our computer graphics. But throughout art history, there are so many other techniques that are worthwhile and worth studying. I don't think we should just focus on linear perspective all the way from early cave paintings, which have just arrangements of elements. This is ancient chinese parallel projections, russian reverse perspective. And then in modern contemporary art, we have all sorts of different things going on. So more formally, I would think about projection in geometric terms.
00:02:03.302 - 00:02:58.272, Speaker A: We have objects in 3d world, and we want to put them onto 2d space in some way. And the key question I want to talk about here is, in human vision, when we are looking at pictures, what are the constraints on what that relationship can be between two d and three d. So, for example, if it were the case that we all assumed that all pictures were made by linear perspective projection, then we would expect that any point in 2D has to lie in a line with its three d point and with the picture's center of projection. But it could be something else. There could be some other relationship that we assume. In my reading of the vision literature of the human perception in psychophysics, all these papers, nearly all of them, seem to assume linear perspective in some way, either through through explicit estimation of center of perspective, or all the stimuli are linear perspective. And yet nobody I've met actually seems to believe that this is how human vision works.
00:02:58.272 - 00:03:39.612, Speaker A: And I just mentioned there are a few papers that do talk about alternatives from gun, drink, and pepperrell. And I found these papers very inspiring. So I'll review some of the limitations of conventional linear perspective as a technique for depiction, which I think people will know, but I think are good background for some of the discussion. So if you take a wide angle picture, this is taken on my iPhone. In the default zoom, you can see in the corners, objects look stretched and distorted. The basketball here and the person on the lower left. So one response this people often give is that, well, the reason the picture looks distorted is because you're not viewing it from the center perspective.
00:03:39.612 - 00:04:01.744, Speaker A: And so the question I have for you then, is, for this picture, where is the center perspective? Default iPhone zoom mode. Any ideas? Very close. Yes. And I would not have known this before I started thinking about this. No reason why you should. But basically, the center projection for this picture is about where my thumb is. So according to the conventional theory, if your eye is not where my thumb is, you are viewing this picture the wrong way.
00:04:01.744 - 00:04:30.532, Speaker A: And obviously, that's not how we view pictures. That really doesn't really reveal much about visual perception. Now, of course, if you do move your camera over to that spot or view monocular lately from the spot, then of course it does. The distortion does go away. But, you know, that's not how we view pictures. You know, even when pictures do have focal centers, we don't stand at the spot. We see small faces projected onto big billboards.
00:04:30.532 - 00:05:18.344, Speaker A: We look at big landscapes on our phones and so on. I feel like that's a bit of a dead end. Conversely, we could also ask, is this what artists do? And the art historian Martin Kemp surveyed the collection at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, and he found that only 3% of these pictures actually seem to strictly follow linear perspective. And specifically, this means construction techniques. But again, it kind of illustrates the point that this is not really how artists work. And many great artists, through history, back to da Vinci and Turner and Hockney, mastered linear perspective, discovered its shortcomings, and wrote about how it was really not the only or the best way to make pictures. If we look at Raphael's school of Athens here, this is a famous example where the architecture strictly follows one point perspective.
00:05:18.344 - 00:05:48.056, Speaker A: But if you look in the lower right, these philosophers are holding globes that, according to Linear's perspective, should all be stretched out, and the faces should also be stretched out, too, in linear perspective. But they're not. The one calculation is that the globe there should have an aspect ratio of 1.2 to one, and it doesn't. So clearly, artists are not doing this. I have never seen a painting in all of history that stretches out objects in this way. So one clue as to how perception might work, I think, comes from multi perspective techniques.
00:05:48.056 - 00:06:24.414, Speaker A: And so if you've seen Pietro's talks from back in the day, you might recognize this picture in which the horse rider has essentially a different center projection than the structure below him. So there's especially all these great techniques in photography and computational photography. So here's Freda Dron's holiday card from last year. And the way he made this was by photographing his family repeatedly inside this cardboard box and then collaging all those different boxes together. And so we have a single picture which has every box at its own vanishing point. They're all separate projections, and it all looks fine. There's no apparent distortion here.
00:06:24.414 - 00:06:45.372, Speaker A: There's nothing, particularly from a shape perception point of view. Nothing particularly weird about it. Here's a work of a photographer. He has a sequence of photos from Bernal Hill. It appears that he's concatenated together. You can see multiple vanishing points. The objects don't look square, box shaped.
00:06:45.372 - 00:07:17.090, Speaker A: They're sort of trapezoidal in a way, but there's no apparent distortion. There's nothing about it that looks like, you know, there's no marginal distortions, for example. And there's a whole long history of computational techniques that are inspired by things like this, that collage different projections horizontally in various ways. It doesn't have to be horizontal collage. This is a nice paper that adjusts perspective and depth. The photos and left have a dolly zoom relationship. Objects far away are essentially depicted with a different projection than near ones.
00:07:17.090 - 00:07:50.474, Speaker A: And again, picture looks totally fine. So these are all different techniques in for making pictures, multiple projections that all work out. I'd also claim that classic painting is essentially, we can describe it in terms of these multi perspective techniques. So, like, these spheres and faces are being depicted as if from a different view vantage point than the other objects in the scene. And the psychologists who studied this wrote about like, oh, it's almost like they've moved the center projection for these objects. And they say, exactly. That's what they're doing.
00:07:50.474 - 00:08:25.458, Speaker A: So how does the shape perception work here? So I want to look at perceived distortion. When do things look wrong? So when does it look like? This is not how basketball should look, and that one in the middle is. And I think that we seems like we have an intrinsic sense of this or a built in sense. This is not a normal, like, good looking depiction of a basketball. It looks stretched out and elongated. And I think we can have a mental representations for each. This object looks elongated, but we can mentally know it's actually a distorted depiction of a normal looking basketball.
00:08:25.458 - 00:09:12.818, Speaker A: And often this, you know, these two mental representations can be intentioned that, like the depiction and the knowledge are two separate things. So to describe this in more detail, one observation we can make is that objects never look distorted when they're near the center of a linear perspective picture that has a reasonable focal length. So all of this stuff in the center looks reasonable, the corners do not. And so this leads to something called the direct view condition. And this is based on a cigarette paper from 95. But I want to rephrase it in a more perceptual way. And basically, my claim is that a region of a picture looks undistorted if it looks like a normal object at the center of a linear perspective picture.
00:09:12.818 - 00:09:43.912, Speaker A: So this is how a basketball looks at the center of a linear perspective picture, and therefore it does not look distorted. This rule predicts things like straight, well, common heuristics. Straight lines should be straight, spheres should project to circles, faces should be symmetric. But it also can describe what happens in other kinds of projections. So here's a stereographic projection. Most of the objects, I think, look pretty distorted. But the Eiffel Tower here, to me, that looks like a completely undistorted view.
00:09:43.912 - 00:10:18.324, Speaker A: I don't know what the proportions should be, so it seems totally fine. In parallel projection, all of the objects look undistorted. The corners are a little bit off for if they're meant to be right angles. But for the most part, all people in all parts of the picture can look undistorted, because locally they look like linear perspective projections. And we can look at more other kinds of distortions. I imagine the real person's face isn't actually shaped like that this depicts someone whose face is elongated. And I can know that there's two separate things going on there.
00:10:18.324 - 00:10:57.914, Speaker A: We did a study to test this idea. On the left is a extremely wide angle projection of a 3d scene. And we also made a version of that in which the volleyball on the left is replaced with a projection of it with a local linear perspective projection. And we asked people, which one looks more like a volleyball? And everyone agrees the one on the right does, even though the one on the left is geometrically consistent. This one has separate, a separate projection here, as for everything else. And we tried it with a bunch of other parametric families of projections, such as with equirectangular projection. And again, people care about the local appearance and not global consistency.
00:10:57.914 - 00:11:42.646, Speaker A: So that describes a phenomenology of when things appear distorted, when they don't. Why would that be? And how do we interpret shape? So now I want to switch gears to talk about real world 3d vision, and I'll come back to pictures in a minute. And there's a bunch of things about real world 3d vision, I think, together that are not necessarily obvious and that have a lot of implications. So the first thing is, so we all have, you know, or, you know, we generally have about 180 degree field of view. We have this very, well, field of view of the world. But as, as you probably know, we get most of our information or most detail in foveal vision. The thing that I hadn't realized, at least until a few years ago, is that foveal vision is really small.
00:11:42.646 - 00:12:21.116, Speaker A: So if you hold out your arm at, you know, arm's length, the size of your thumb is roughly the size of foveal vision, or maybe your five fingers. But either way, it's depending on your definition of fovea, either way, it's 0.1% of your entire field of view. And so when I took this picture, I could read street signs way off in the distance there. But I challenge you to do this. Stare at one street sign and read any other word on the slide while looking at one street sign. And I, you know, maybe you can read something very close by, but generally I can't do it.
00:12:21.116 - 00:12:49.584, Speaker A: So you really have to move your eyes around to see detail in different parts of the picture. But we do get information from peripheral vision. We get a lot. So now I'm just going to show you a slide for a very brief time, 200 milliseconds. So just stare at the red dot right now. So hopefully, in that 200 milliseconds, you got a sense of what was happening in the picture? Right. You saw some people or saw a person? I hope so.
00:12:49.584 - 00:13:16.236, Speaker A: The point is that even though we don't get detail in most of our gaze, we start getting information right away. You don't have to move your eyes all around the room to understand the world. Now, I also want one more demonstration here. I want you to take a look at this picture. See, you know, anything odd about it. It's a Harvard vision lab, I guess, as I understand, this thing here is just a stimuli that they use in weather experiments. You can ignore it if you want to.
00:13:16.236 - 00:13:54.684, Speaker A: There's some champagne bottles on the wall from, you know, when people finish their PhD defenses. But, you know, just take a moment to look over it and see if there's anything particularly non photographic about it. Okay, so that was actually video. And the point of this example is that most of it is changing. And when you're staring right at a part which is changing, you can see it change. So I think this might. Let's see if I can find.
00:13:54.684 - 00:14:28.792, Speaker A: Okay, so let that, you know, the jackets here are changing, and you can see them shift moment by moment while you're looking right at them. In peripheral vision, you don't notice it. So there's lots of things we're sort of unaware of, oblivious to in peripheral vision. We don't notice them, and we just sort of assume they're not there. And this can actually provides a possible explanation for a lot of change blindness experiments. So there's this, like, you probably saw the famous one with the gorilla and the basketball. If you have.
00:14:28.792 - 00:15:08.550, Speaker A: When you're looking at the gorilla, you see it. When you're not looking at it, you don't see it. And so this can be described as sort of an illusion of awareness. We think we're seeing everything in front of us, and we're really actually getting information from a relatively small fraction. And the same thing for a picture, we think we're just seeing a whole picture at once when we're actually getting a very selective bit of information from it. One more thing about real world vision, another question is, how much 3d information do we store about the world around us? It feels like we are just doing 3d scanning, of getting a nerf or point cloud or something representation of all the stuff around us in the world. And that's really not the case.
00:15:08.550 - 00:15:51.424, Speaker A: This is one demonstration from a change blindness experiment where people wear a vera headset, look into a room, look around the room, and then they turn around and look back. After they've looked back a bunch of stuff has changed in the room, and often they don't notice it. They haven't recorded the 3d geometry of the world. There's a growing body of literature over the past decade or two that illustrates that. Experiments like this show that we cannot be maintaining a consistent 3d representation. Whatever 3d representation that we have in our head is fragmentary or broken. There's inconsistencies and inconsistencies over time that can't be explained by a coherent 3d world model.
00:15:51.424 - 00:16:31.446, Speaker A: But then the question is, what is that world? Or how are things fragmentary? How are things broken? And I want to argue that our 3d sense of the world is fragmentary across fixations. So at any instant, whatever you're looking at in the world, you have a sense of its detailed shape and geometry and color. You can get detailed sense of 3d just by looking at something. Then when you move your eyes somewhere else, you get a 3d sense of the new thing you're looking at. But whatever, most of the information from the first fixation is gone. I look at a tree, I can count the leaves on it, I can see the shapes of the leaves, and then I look away. I can't recall almost anything.
00:16:31.446 - 00:17:00.994, Speaker A: I can't draw a picture of something without looking at it, or I can't draw a good picture or accurate picture in the context of pictures. We did one change blend of study to. To sort of test this idea. So here's a wide angle projection of a 3d scene. We tell people to fixate on the center of the picture. So this sort of junction here. And then we tell them, move their eyes to the upper right, and then we blanket the display for a moment because eye tracking is hard.
00:17:00.994 - 00:17:49.094, Speaker A: And then they see this, and we ask them, did the picture change at all? And most people say, no. And in case you didn't notice it, in the upper right here, this building has a perspective, marginal distortion. And then once they fixate on it, they fixate on one which is local, has a local projection. So that suggests that people are not seeing that when they fixate on the center, they're not seeing that detailed perspective or shape in the corner of the picture. But what's more, after we've done this experiment with looking at the four corners of the picture in the same thing, where they see the undistorted version, when they look in the corner, we ask them, did you see? Which of these pictures did you see? The one on the left is one that they actually. We showed them that picture, and they say they didn't see it. The one on the right.
00:17:49.094 - 00:18:28.414, Speaker A: They never saw this whole picture, and they say that they did see it. And the reason is the one on the right has undistorted versions of all the corner objects, and they never fixated on the distorted versions. It's also interesting to look at cases where these things break down in visual illusions. So this illusion here is an object that has, or, you know, a picture that has two rings, and hopefully that's clear that this is two rings. If you fixate on any part of it, you can see that there are two rings. But in peripheral vision, it messes with the encoding and peripheral vision somehow. And so you keep looking over it and it never seems to come together.
00:18:28.414 - 00:18:45.764, Speaker A: And this illustrates both the importance. You know, it illustrates a lot of things, I think. But one thing it illustrates is that no matter how much time you have to scan this picture into your memory, you never do. You never know. Okay, now I know what the picture is. No more contradiction. It's every moment is a separate interpretation of the world.
00:18:45.764 - 00:19:32.474, Speaker A: So this is longstanding question people have had. Why is it that pictures can convey such effective illusions of a 3d world when they're just flat things? And the answer I give to that is that real world 3d vision is a lot less than it seems. It's much more fixation by fixation than we would assume. So what happens when we look at a picture? You look at what you fixate on one part of the picture, you see a person's face, you get a sense of the shape of the detail there. Fixate somewhere else, you see some other detail, and that other part, fixate somewhere else, you get some other detail, other information, and over time, you can build up an abstracted representation of, you know, that there's four people in a row here. You can remember that even if you close your eyes. But we're interpreting the picture separately at each glance.
00:19:32.474 - 00:20:01.320, Speaker A: And so coming back to the question of projections and perception, I claim that we're essentially, we have a separate fixation for each fixation on a picture. So let me. I want to use this picture to illustrate that. So this is a wide angle, linear perspective picture. How are the people oriented with respect to each other? Are they facing away? Facing toward a parallel? Parallel, that's right, yeah. Is that the impression it gives? Yeah. Yeah.
00:20:01.320 - 00:20:46.324, Speaker A: So the pic, you know, if you think about it, you can tell, you know, that they're parallel, but it really looks like, you know, Jan here is facing away from the viewer when in fact they are indeed all parallel. And the thing is that Jan's orientation with respect to the viewer here is the same regardless of where he is in the picture. So whether he's in the side of the picture or the whole picture is just Jan, or Jan is just the right most part of the picture. The perception is the same. So this really says it's a local shape perception. And so the hypothesis I want to express here is a generalization of the previous one. It says that in each fixation on a picture, we interpret it locally in terms of a linear perspective projection centered on the fixation.
00:20:46.324 - 00:21:29.274, Speaker A: Or diagrammatically, you fixate on part of a picture. You interpret this at its own little picture with its own little local linear perspective, plus peripheral vision, largely modulated by the size of foveal vision. Then you fixate somewhere else in the picture, and then you're looking at almost like a different picture. You know, there's a relationship. Peripheral vision connects some, but most shape is coming from a linear perspective picture, a linear perspective interpretation of this picture. There are a whole bunch of nuances here, especially around slant compensation. That is a big point of contention in literature among me and the reviewers, which I'm happy to talk about, but it's not, I think, crucial for this.
00:21:29.274 - 00:22:33.830, Speaker A: So I think these hypotheses explain the evidence well across all kinds of evidence about pictures. They're consistent with the biology of how vision at a glance works in foveal vision, consistent with the effectiveness of linear perspective, and explains why it works well in lots of ways, as well as how it can create all kinds of different distortions. And also when we perceive distortions in art and how we interpret those as well, it fits well with the way that paintings can be multi perspective in various ways, and so can all the great work in computational photography, and it also fits the experimental evidence that it provided. I don't know of any attempt to capture all these different things within one set of theories. So, to summarize, the key idea here is that I think we perceive shape in each fixation in a picture that corresponds to a local linear perspective. I think this can explain lots of phenomena of shape and distortion in pictures throughout art history and photography. I think this also could inform how we think about making pictures.
00:22:33.830 - 00:23:20.244, Speaker A: You know, nowadays, I think about, you know, depicting how individual objects look and how they're arranged within a scene, and there's lots of different objects and choices you make in those choices of making a depiction. And this is just scratching the surface. I've squeezed a ton of different stuff into 25 minutes talk. There's lots of open problems here to test out these ideas to elaborate, like, what is the cutoff of foveal vision? Maybe there is no cutoff. How much do we actually, there's a huge open question, but 3d vision over time and so on, that are unknown in literature and on the paper is online and webpage, along with a few other links. And. Thank you very much, Bill.
00:23:22.304 - 00:23:40.410, Speaker B: As I listen to it, I listen to it thinking that, of course, this is more general than perspective. It's all about all these nuisance variables that we just love to get rid of. Illumination, color, we get rid of shadow, direction. We get rid of all these things that don't matter in terms of what we're perceiving. Do you see it in that way?
00:23:40.442 - 00:24:04.186, Speaker A: Like. Yes. Yeah. So, you know, one follow up thing we're looking at now is, how does this affect tone perception? Like, if, you know, the McGregor painting empire of light, you know, the building and the sky have completely different lighting and tone, and it looks fine. Yeah. So I think that this generalizes beyond just perspective. Yeah.
00:24:04.210 - 00:24:29.080, Speaker C: So, first of all, lovely perspective on. So something you left out, which I think we should discuss, and I'm wondering, where are your thoughts? Is we still preserve, as you pointed out, at some point, the entirety of the scene, at some much more abstracted form?
00:24:29.152 - 00:24:29.804, Speaker A: Yes.
00:24:30.104 - 00:24:49.670, Speaker C: And so today, you concluded with the individual glances, which open a little window in the world, but it's something from them. And there is a prestige that we make out of all of those glances, which includes the global shape. So what is that? At what level is gap and so on. That would be an interesting question.
00:24:49.862 - 00:25:10.664, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's a completely open question. How much do we know we don't perceive? We don't preserve all 3D information of the world. We know we preserve something like, you know, how to go out of the building. So it's somewhere in between these two extremes. And what is that? I think that's a big, open question. But it's not just. It's also too deep.
00:25:10.704 - 00:25:10.880, Speaker B: Right.
00:25:10.912 - 00:25:30.704, Speaker A: We don't never actually have a full 2d picture. We never store the actual good. That's right. Yeah. We are using little transformers with patches. Well, we have some abstracted. I think we have an abstract representation.
00:25:30.704 - 00:25:42.824, Speaker A: You can say, I know that there are four people in a row. I don't know what the pixels are. Just like, I know there are a bunch of people arranged in this room. When I look away, I don't know exactly. I didn't see everyone who it was.
00:25:45.124 - 00:26:42.622, Speaker D: So two points. One is that, I mean, this is sort of crying out for our learning theory in the sense that as we grow up, we have our experience, and our experience is modulated by how do we see typical objects? So maybe we don't see basketballs way out in the periphery. Often we are. Exposure to objects is in this certain sense. And therefore, whatever we see, we interpret in the light of what we know it is, rather than what the actual pixels tell us. My second point is that there is a. We also have to explain that we do see the benefit of perspective, right? So there is a difference between the chinese painting and, like a painting from the Renaissance, 1480, we do have that perception of the spatial layout.
00:26:42.622 - 00:27:26.676, Speaker D: So somehow there is. The spatial layout is being perceived, and it's giving us this sense of this plane receding in depth at the same time that for the objects we are, we are just seeing them the way they should be, in the sense that we are not treating it purely in terms of perspective projection, but in terms of what the object we know, quote to be there. Right? So there is the layout. Right. It's not that we can say for linear perspective is all bullshit. We are actually seeing the scene. We are getting the benefit when we see those Renaissance paintings of this perception of the plane.
00:27:26.676 - 00:27:37.348, Speaker D: So it's not that linear perspective isn't there. The scene is being seen with the benefit of perspective giving us that sense of the plane receiving it there.
00:27:37.476 - 00:28:06.524, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. And I think in squeezing this talk to 25 minutes, I couldn't really talk about arrangement. And I definitely believe that there's a lot to say about how the arrangements of objects into a picture affects perception. So one of my. I mainly talked about individual fixations. I've talked about local shape. So here in the ponzo illusion, these two people have the same pixels, and they look like they have the same shape, but they clearly have a different perceived scale.
00:28:06.524 - 00:28:35.554, Speaker A: And then when in the parallel projection in ancient chinese painting, you have one sense of, like, there's sort of no receding depth for, you know, a cave painting is just a bunch of, you know, objects are arranged in a 2d plane and so on. So all these different arrangements convey different senses of space that are separate from local shape. And I think there's, like. That's a huge question, or what are the range of depictions there?
00:28:37.254 - 00:28:51.874, Speaker B: Well, just quick comment. I think, like, the main takeaway for me, I think, of your entire presentation is something very, very deep, which is that even the representation of an image is wrong.
00:28:53.574 - 00:29:00.798, Speaker A: Well, I mean, I would avoid value judgments, but about, like, right and wrong, I think all kinds of pictures can be good but what do you mean.
00:29:00.926 - 00:29:15.394, Speaker B: For example, like this. Like the starting point of an array of pixels of this scene is literally not what, like, our eye and brain are doing because we're fixating on certain aspects of it.
00:29:15.514 - 00:29:15.914, Speaker D: Right.
00:29:15.994 - 00:29:24.094, Speaker B: So just the starting point is even wrong, basically, if you want to compare biological systems to artificial ones. Right?
00:29:25.194 - 00:29:25.930, Speaker A: In what way?
00:29:26.002 - 00:29:34.874, Speaker B: Like, in the sense of, like, for example, this. This scene over here, for example, would be philosophers or whatnot. That's not actually what is being perceived.
00:29:34.954 - 00:29:35.602, Speaker A: Right. You.
00:29:35.698 - 00:29:45.834, Speaker B: I mean, you just said that you're fixating on something. Move over here, move over here, move over here. Right. What's drawn over here is our idea of what we think we're seeing.
00:29:45.874 - 00:29:46.050, Speaker D: Right.
00:29:46.082 - 00:29:53.866, Speaker B: But actually, I'm never really seeing all that much. Fixating, fixating, fixating, fixating. So even the starting point is not accurate.
00:29:54.050 - 00:30:25.074, Speaker A: Yeah. I think a picture is a way of creating an experience in a viewer that will capture aspects of real world visual experience. It will never capture all of our real world experience. You know, if you wear virtual reality goggles, then you can get most of it, and then, because then you're like, you're giving each eye the correct. The accurate light field it would see in the real world. But a picture gives us a very different experience, and we have captured some aspects of the real world experience, and those others, it just can't. I don't know if that aligns with what you're thinking.
00:30:28.854 - 00:30:48.774, Speaker B: Great talk. I think it makes a lot of sense. I just want to layer on in there that I'm a camel person. So I used before I really start hanging out with a vision scientist, I usually sort of think of that way. You point your camera different places, and I point my eye in different places, and it look really much the same. So it's kind of like my eyes.
00:30:48.814 - 00:30:49.198, Speaker A: A camera.
00:30:49.246 - 00:31:07.364, Speaker B: My camera's an eye, and. Great. So if I hang out with the vision scientists, a lot more deeper sort of cartoon of, like, how different that is. And you pointed out the foveal spot is basically just like your thumbnail at arms, leg.
00:31:07.404 - 00:31:07.772, Speaker A: Right.
00:31:07.868 - 00:31:39.474, Speaker B: And I just wanted to layer into all the things you're saying that in that foveal spot, it's not like linear perspective at all, for many, many reasons. But even just the spatial warping, because of the foveation, the density of photoreceptor changes. It means it's a very warped, wide angle, like a fish eye kind of even within that thumbnail feature. And, of course, that's so different than our vision that's happening even in that fixation. Yeah.
00:31:39.514 - 00:31:59.976, Speaker A: Thank you. I would just add to that, though, when you're making a picture, you are essentially simulating the light coming to the eyes with a fixation. The, I mean, the, the sensor in the eye may still be able to compensate for that warp that happens. Yeah, we can talk a little more later.
00:32:00.000 - 00:32:01.864, Speaker B: Yeah, it's definitely the brain.
00:32:01.944 - 00:32:02.200, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:32:02.232 - 00:32:22.356, Speaker B: It's a huge illusion that has to occur in that perception of the vision that we experience and feel like it's a huge complication of inference to take out that sensor based distortions. Let's do one last question and then we'll break for lunch.
00:32:22.460 - 00:32:23.224, Speaker A: Okay.
00:32:24.084 - 00:33:10.954, Speaker E: So I've been curious all morning how few references have been made to the pathologies of vision, and in particular in your talk. I couldn't help but think about agnosia, which are quite common in the population. So protopagnosia, where people see eyes and nose and ears, but don't see faces, or semel diagnosia, which is similar, but with abstract, abstract diagrams. One sees the different parts but doesn't put them together. And I wonder how you account for those kinds of phenomena, given that if it's innate, well, it should be innate to everybody.
00:33:13.494 - 00:33:32.194, Speaker A: I guess I don't know enough about those to comment those. Some more like questions about recognition, which I would view as being a little higher level later in the pipeline than perception of shape and color, which is more what I'm talking about. Sorry, I guess I don't know enough to say more.
00:33:32.574 - 00:33:35.110, Speaker D: Okay, so let's continue the discussion over lunch.
00:33:35.262 - 00:33:38.086, Speaker B: We'll come back here at 130 for.
00:33:38.110 - 00:33:39.934, Speaker D: Bruno, and let's thank Erin one more time.
