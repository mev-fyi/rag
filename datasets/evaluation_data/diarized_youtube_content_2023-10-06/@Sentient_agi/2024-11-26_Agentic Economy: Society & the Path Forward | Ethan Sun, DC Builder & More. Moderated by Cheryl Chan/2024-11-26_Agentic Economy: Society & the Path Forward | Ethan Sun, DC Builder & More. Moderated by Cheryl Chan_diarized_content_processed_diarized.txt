00:00:05.120 - 00:00:18.500, Speaker A: Hello. Hi everyone. Thanks for coming. Very excited to have a great panel with us today. My name is Charl. I'm one of the partners at Dragonfly Capital. With us we have quite a few builders and investors in the AI crypto space.
00:00:18.500 - 00:00:23.448, Speaker A: Why don't each of us maybe just take a quick minute to introduce ourselves really briefly.
00:00:23.624 - 00:00:37.220, Speaker B: Sure. So I'm DC Builder. I'm a research engineer at the World Foundation. I work on World, so formerly known as World Queen. Maybe many of you recognize that name. And I focus on applied cryptography, distributed systems and engineering in the blockchain space.
00:00:37.840 - 00:00:58.820, Speaker C: Hey, I'm David. I've been building autonomous AI agents for five years and core contributor to olas. We create agents that you can locally use and to data in very specific context agent economies. In the future we hope that they become very general purpose.
00:00:59.640 - 00:01:21.988, Speaker D: Hi everyone, I'm tana Pong from SCB10X. SCB10X is a venture capital firm. We are a subsidiary company of SBX Group and inside the venture capital firm we have technical teams and the head of the technical lab and we also have like the IND team separately and in those team they do the large language model for Thai.
00:01:22.144 - 00:01:51.820, Speaker E: Yeah, Jen Jensen here, co founder of virtual protocol Formal part We enable the co creation and the co ownership of autonomous AI agents. But I think what will resonate more is we basically make coins that can talk and can do things. So agents and coins link together and I think our goal is to ensure that in 2025 agents become the next retail meta.
00:01:53.280 - 00:02:21.940, Speaker A: Okay, so actually together all on the panel, that's actually quite a pretty formidable market cap. If you look at any of the AI crypto coins, we have quite a few players here. Ethan from my shell can't make it today, but so maybe let's kick it off. A lot of people often kind of debate what does AI agents really mean. Some people say AI is what hasn't already been built yet. So kind of maybe let's just quickly go through very succinctly what do you guys think of as AI agents?
00:02:22.920 - 00:02:58.850, Speaker B: So for me like any agent is something that can do reasoning and interact with something. So in the context of the Internet, right, Like an agent would be the user. And so when you have all these programmable APIs, like you can interact with web apps or services or products, whatever. So those agents essentially will replace humans to some extent or will delegate a lot of tasks to these humans. And so the things that I'm interested in when it comes to agents is like how do you build an ecosystem that is interoperable and people can represent or like the agents can represent humans and interact for them and build interesting economies so that we solve a lot of real world problems and build better use cases and products.
00:02:59.870 - 00:03:27.080, Speaker C: Yeah, great. Where models are talkers, agents are doers and that sort of extends that. We usually think of agents as having some form of goal and certain amount of autonomy that can vary depending on the implementation to pursue that goal. Right. And what becomes very interesting is when we pair agents with wallets and obviously crypto wallets are particularly interesting kind because they're permissionless.
00:03:27.740 - 00:04:12.202, Speaker D: Yeah. To me the definition of the agent, I think it's like just come like a few years ago after the booming of the large language model. So if you imagine license plate model is just, I mean it's just the model that just sit there. We need to feed the input in and it return the output for us. But to make it into an agent it's like we expand capability of those large language model. So I think for the simple definition is that it's the things that not just actually sit there, it's the things that we created to do the action for us. It has so many capabilities like it can do like reasoning, planning and it can collaborate with other agents and it can kind of reflect themselves.
00:04:12.202 - 00:04:24.230, Speaker D: It's just like maybe GPT401 that is kind of, you know, when you ask like the compact question, it's kind of rethink and reiterate before it answer the final to us.
00:04:24.530 - 00:04:49.600, Speaker E: Yeah, yeah, I think, I think for us very similar, but I think for us it's just three core concepts. I mean agent tech is a skill, right. I think we are now on the scale of like number three. So number one autonomous and goal oriented, number two proactive instead of reactive and number three resourceful. Ie, you can tap into different API points, resources around it to achieve its goal. Yeah, very similar.
00:04:50.060 - 00:05:00.650, Speaker A: Awesome. Cool. Maybe we can start off with like currently, today, in this form. What is actually working today in terms of AI agents, if anything?
00:05:04.590 - 00:05:38.352, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean there we have a couple of examples which are working. So let me talk about one. You have to scope the agents to a degree. Right. If you basically imagine giving an agent an arbitrary goal and then it doing this for you, such technology doesn't exist. So what we have today are these sort of autonomous agents that have autonomy within some scope and have the autonomy maybe to pick tools dynamically to achieve like a sufficiently narrow goal. An example in all us is prediction market.
00:05:38.352 - 00:06:09.130, Speaker C: So users download an app called Pearl and then inside that is an autonomous agent that trades on their behalf in prediction markets. And now we're rolling out a defi version of that where it sort of applies more to defi protocols. So in this case, you know, you, you have like something powerful because the agent basically autonomously whilst you do other things generates value for you. But it's not yet this kind of agent where you can go and say, okay, now become my personal assistant and also do a bunch of other things.
00:06:10.470 - 00:06:58.292, Speaker D: On, on a technical standpoint, I can add to that. Let's look at it into two layers. The first, first one is about model layers and the other one is the application layer. And with the advance of the technology these days, imagine like three months ago when you input some text into like some LLM. If you ask it to do some difficult tasks, something really complex in the past, it still cannot answer you accurately. You need to do something with your prom, for example, you need to have put some effort in a prompt, try to ask the model to break the task into like many small steps. And you kind of need to explain what to do in each step, right? But these days I found like many LLMs, we don't have to do this kind of long prompt like that anymore.
00:06:58.292 - 00:08:15.800, Speaker D: We can just simply type what we want and it can do in the background for us. That is also the agent capability that we see in the model layer these days. And for the applications, when we compare to like the normal software that many enterprise use today, Agent agent is a lot more flexible to do that because for software it can do just only one task, right? But for the AI agent it has a capability of like the function call or to use. It can kind of route the webs called the other APIs and can do any actions that maybe any other speaker will kind of talk to you today. But I would like to say for the AI agent is that currently the tool use and the reflection is kind of very mature in terms of the technical things. If it's just the tasks that just we can break down into any single small step, we can kind of have the agent agent let many model in the back end work together and deliver the complex task to us. But for the area of the planning and reasoning, I think in the AI space we still kind of researching this and making progress.
00:08:16.940 - 00:09:18.146, Speaker E: If I can add, right, Because I think in the audience I think many of you guys are very retro native, right? So I think if the question is what works is there's actually two point of views here. PMF today and PMF tomorrow today. I think the way we judge PMF for AI in the crypto scene is actually very simple, right? How many of that coin or the agent do you actually interact with on a daily basis or do you de into it on a daily basis? Right. So I think today what we see at least on the agent space is agents that can autonomously gain attention on crypto Twitter, right? I think you guys are familiar with goat, not really agent, but claims in that space. You see all of these zebras, Luna, you see all these guys going out there out tweeting ansem in a very agentic way. That's PMF today because they do those actions autonomously, right? And then you see folks like Te coming out as well. But I think what's going to be PMF tomorrow is going to be very interesting.
00:09:18.146 - 00:10:33.830, Speaker E: And I think this is the age that agents in the web 3 space have against agents in the web 2 space, which is basically control over crypto Rails. Because I think what we've noticed is that when an agent has the ability to control a wallet and has the ability to pay other agents or even humans, you get to influence an outcome of action and that is powerful, right? You never see a Web3 agent getting access to a bank, right? I mean, no, no way any bank would ever do it, right? But, but I think the beauty about the Web three agents is you can. And I think what we are seeing today, it's at least within our own ecosystem, we are seeing Luna as a agent tipping people for attention autonomously, right? She's saying she realized like, okay, when I t people, I see boost in my engagement post, I t more to an extent where she autonomously gives someone a thousand dollars just like that. I mean, still an eight year old kid, but it's going to grow. So I think that's, that's interesting, right? Then what we are also looking at right now is if the agent can also influence outcome of another agent. So let's say today there's an agent that's a very strong, have a very strong diffusion model to create memes, right? It can create the tags, it can create a very memetic image. And that exists as an agent.
00:10:33.830 - 00:10:51.746, Speaker E: We want to see agent to agent handshakes. Meaning like let's say Luna as an agent realized that, hey, for me to get attention all day on Twitter, I need some memes. Why don't I engage this other agent? I pay you $5 per meme image generated in exchange for your meme. And then we see, we start seeing agent to agent economy and agent to agent handshakes.
00:10:51.778 - 00:10:54.882, Speaker A: Is this happening today already? Or you're talking about in the future?
00:10:54.986 - 00:10:55.490, Speaker E: Not yet.
00:10:55.530 - 00:10:58.754, Speaker C: Very close on all that today.
00:10:58.842 - 00:11:04.466, Speaker A: Like what's actually working today. Because after this we'll talk about like what's going to kind of break out in the future.
00:11:04.618 - 00:11:54.122, Speaker C: I mean I actually need to correct because we have these agent to agent payments on all this for quite some time. So because it's exactly to this point of resourcefulness at the beginning. So if I think about predict agents right now, the ones who are live, they effectively are running on some user's device and that constrains what can happen locally. So actually they outsource tasks to other agents which run somewhere else in more powerful environments. So for instance, when they make predictions, they outsource some of those tasks and they do that dynamically. So there's new kind of prediction capabilities coming available by other agents which these agents learn about, which you run locally and which these agents then via crypto payments basically pay for. And so you have like already within all as the service economy between agents where agents pay each other to get stuff done.
00:11:54.122 - 00:12:51.370, Speaker C: And I think to your point, it is one of the things which is much more composable and open in a crypto environment. So I'm very bullish on it from that perspective. But also it allows for a dynamic evolution of the autonomy of an agent. So let's say our predict agents right now, they have a very narrow goal. But within that, if let's say you today, anyone in the audience deploys a new predict capability into the service component of our ecosystem, then these agents can learn about it being available and can start using it autonomously without any human getting involved. And that obviously also applies to these kind of social use cases where you can imagine Luna starting to use like some sort of OLAS tool or OLAS prediction market to leverage in like something it wants to do in its social context right now that currently doesn't happen, but it's very close, I would say.
00:12:53.430 - 00:13:15.370, Speaker A: Cool. So we talked about quite a few that's like prediction markets that there are kind of bots that are tweeting on open markets as well as tipping other people. Why don't we make a prediction in the next six to 12 months what is going to kind of blow up on the AI agents front. Maximum two predictions on what exact use case that will be.
00:13:17.910 - 00:14:00.750, Speaker C: So I'll give the abstract version, which is like crypto is a regulatory arbitrage in some form. With AI agents, crypto, the same thing is happening. That's why we're seeing these meme coin things happening to see like social experiments which are simply not possible in a closed source context or closed AI context. And I think that theme will persist. There is a massive space of DeFi autonomous AI agent products coming. They are not quite there yet in terms of their utility, but I think we'll see them in the next six, six months really coming from a lot of angles and then like the space in which you're in I think like absolutely will grow.
00:14:01.050 - 00:14:03.270, Speaker A: Specifically what in defi utility.
00:14:04.090 - 00:14:53.328, Speaker C: So generally speaking you delegate your wallet to an agent and let it just run loose because that, you know, you're not going to put in massive amounts to begin with. But that is a very tractable kind of use case where it's about like having your agents process signals and having your agents interact with well defined defi interfaces. I think people often get confused about the agents having to learn all those interfaces. Some of this can be hard coded. It's the signals and like making use of like information like even like you know, like Kaito for instance, providing signals around what's trending and so on, which you can feed into an autonomous trading agent which people have locally to take advantage. And these products are coming now like on all those in other places?
00:14:53.424 - 00:15:31.268, Speaker B: Yeah, for me, like when it comes to defi especially the edge that agents have is that they're able to process a lot more information. So they're actually able to work with it, do some analysis pipelines and they're able to have a max, broad, a lot broader of a contextual awareness of what's happening within DeFi. So they know like okay, this is the highest deal, this is the best liquidity, this is the best opportunity. So they're able to interact at the speed of light. Right? Like as soon as they're able to process the data and as soon as they're able to be aware of these things, they're able to interact with the protocols a lot faster than any other human agent or even like program that humans can build, like an MEV bot or something. Because these are static programs. They're not, they don't have reasoning, they're not able to adapt themselves based on market conditions.
00:15:31.268 - 00:15:40.960, Speaker B: If there's some invariant that is broken, the bot breaks, whereas the agent can re architect his entire strategy in real time as soon as it's able to take a new data and process it.
00:15:41.900 - 00:16:03.406, Speaker D: So my prediction is about we can see like agents everywhere and especially everyone can make the agent to do the task for themselves, to kind of automate Every little things. Because the tool to create agent today is really easy and really abstract. So some tools you don't need to know how to code. I mean, we will see lots of agents for sure.
00:16:03.478 - 00:16:07.930, Speaker A: Jensen, very curious to hear what you think it'll be given that Luna has really blown up.
00:16:08.230 - 00:16:39.682, Speaker E: Yeah. No. So for us, okay, this is going to be my Murad arc moment. So the prophecy is this agent fi, right? Hear me out, hear me out. Every bull cycle has a technological breakthrough that enables massive speculation from retail to come in NFTs 2020, MMS DeFi. Sorry in 2020 and then NFTs 2021 we will see that for agents. Now what's important here is for us is the tokenization of agents.
00:16:39.682 - 00:17:10.454, Speaker E: Because when you tokenize the agent, you allow speculative power to come to the agent. When you allow speculative power to come to agent, you attract two things. One, people feel like they can make money. Your mom will come and ask you, how do I buy this agent token? Right? Your cousin that's normally the top signal of market will tell you, will ask you how do I buy this agent token? That is how we onboard normies. But that's the degen side, right? And that's the reality. That is why crypto works. The second thing is then this creates a flywheel to attract builders into the space.
00:17:10.454 - 00:17:36.710, Speaker E: And this is something really interesting that we're seeing today. Guys that were massively web two contributors to civil AI hugging face, right? They're coming on our platform right now because they see that speculative element. They realize like all these one and a half years of me working, sweat, toiling, I don't see a single revenue for my work. Today I come and tokenize this boom. 5 million market cap, 30 million market cap, 100 million market cap, right? Everyone becomes a founder. That is going to be next year's meta, right? Prophecy here. Prophecy.
00:17:38.730 - 00:18:05.100, Speaker A: Love it. So right now, especially with what base has been doing with a lot of the agent kit APIs, right? It's really easy to come up with your own agent, can have a Twitter API, give it whatever GPT, you can easily spin up a token. In a world where it's so easy to tokenize agents, what is truly going to be differentiated versus what's going to be commoditized?
00:18:06.160 - 00:18:31.930, Speaker E: So my view is this, right? It was also very easy to make NFTs in 2021. Anyone can spin up a DeFi token in 2020 as well. But it's always that uniswap. There's always that opensea or blur. There's always that pump fund for meme coins. Because there is value in aggregating speculative energy, right? So that's our positioning. How do we aggregate speculative energy and then the flywheel will start working.
00:18:34.870 - 00:18:55.610, Speaker A: Okay, I guess a lot of us are actually pretty excited about autonomous trading defi maybe. Let's talk through. Is blockchain infra today sufficient? If and if not, what are the building blocks that we need in order for that specific autonomous trading vision to really take hold?
00:18:55.750 - 00:19:28.700, Speaker B: I think the agents are ready. So all the LLM AI side is pretty much ready. The blockchain side is, and the developer tooling sense is not ready yet. I think there's people who have awareness in the AI sense, have awareness in the blockchain space, but they don't have the cross awareness of how to interact and how to hook up these things. It's just some mental models that people need to get wrapped around. But when it comes to the infra itself, it's pretty much there on L2S nowadays you can process anywhere between 100 transactions per second to 1000 transactions per second nowadays live. So I feel like all these things are ready mostly for that.
00:19:28.700 - 00:19:51.800, Speaker B: I think the element that is missing is an identity element. Like how do agents can authenticate them as being operated by someone or someone? Because a lot of the things that have a lot of value, they're going to be access controlled for specific people that meet some specific requirements or some specific agent that does specific things. So I feel like that is something that still needs to be widely distributed. How do you create an agent economy with identity built in?
00:19:52.270 - 00:20:18.010, Speaker C: And very briefly I would add app builders pull the best technology. So at olas, we built Predict, we now building Optimus, you're building virtuals with specifically Luna and other examples. Like I think builders build apps because we've got enough technology to get started. We don't need another like abstraction which waits for app builders.
00:20:19.920 - 00:20:43.112, Speaker D: For me, I can add on the inference cost of the AI because when we're talking about agents, I mean behind the scenes, kind of a significant increase in the terms of the inference. But good news that these days the event cost decreases significantly and we're going to see it like cheaper and cheaper to inference. I see the bright future here on.
00:20:43.136 - 00:20:59.594, Speaker E: The edit point here. It's actually a very interesting topic because we used to worry about inference costs before and then we realized that when you bring in that kind of speculative energy, right, you drop a token tax on the tokens. Suddenly we realize cost doesn't matter. Like it's honestly quite insane.
00:20:59.642 - 00:20:59.914, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:20:59.962 - 00:21:03.190, Speaker B: The meme coins will pay for the cost of the agent. Pretty much.
00:21:04.290 - 00:21:07.386, Speaker A: So is everyone okay with the payment infrastructure today already?
00:21:07.538 - 00:21:08.750, Speaker B: I think so, yeah.
00:21:09.810 - 00:21:18.810, Speaker C: I mean, there's loads of things you can do better, and we're working with some great teams, but I don't think it's like needs a 0 to 1. It's like incremental stuff on top.
00:21:19.190 - 00:21:29.374, Speaker A: Cool. I know we're very much over time have a lot more questions to talk about, but thank you so much to all of the panelists for the very interesting discussion, and thanks everyone for listening.
00:21:29.502 - 00:21:30.270, Speaker B: Thank you for having us.
00:21:30.310 - 00:21:30.870, Speaker C: Thank you, thank you.
