00:00:02.640 - 00:00:55.878, Speaker A: Hello, everyone. So thanks. Thanks, Will, for telling me two minutes before that, I am introing the conference. So that's a lot for the confidence. So, guys, like, welcome to the decentralized AGI conference, one of its kind. And the core goal of this is, like, as all of us are hearing a lot of, like, you know, like, hype around the AI, and we all know that the emergent risks of AI across the globe, that this can make some parties really, really powerful, some centralized parties really powerful. And when you think about it as a problem for the humanity, I also think that this is one of the biggest problems of our lifetimes and definitely want to spend time and resources into this.
00:00:55.878 - 00:01:49.744, Speaker A: And you see, when you look at AI, AI is a big centralizing force. And if you want to decentralize this power, crypto is the only technology in the industry, like, in the world, right? So there needs to be more innovation, more like, you know, attempts resource money being thrown at it to create these decentralized incentive structures which can allow these emergent AI companies projects or even community projects where this power can be a little bit more decentralized. So that's the whole background behind this decentralized AGI conference. We expect this conference to happen in most of the big crypto conference places. So this is the first inaugural event, and it will happen across the board. This is also hosted by Sentient. Sentient AI.
00:01:49.744 - 00:02:40.772, Speaker A: The sentient AI is basically, it's an AI company which wants to create OpenAI, or anthropic kind of user experience and user facing AI product, but with the power of crypto incentives in the background, so that you can use crypto incentives to catch up to the lead time or catch up to the lead that these centralized and closed AI companies have globally. So that's the core goal of Sentient. And I would like to invite the founding team of Sentient on board. And I also want to announce that I will also be joining them as a co founder in this endeavor. So let me invite, like, Pramod Vishnath. Professor Pramod Vishnath. He's the professor of computer science at Princeton.
00:02:40.772 - 00:03:15.554, Speaker A: And, you know, like, also the co inventor of 4G. So pretty accomplished, you know, person in the scientific arena. Then we have Himanshu. And Himanshu is like the professor of computer science at ISC Bangalore, which is India's premier scientific institute. And he also recently got, like, the young Scientist award from indian government. And then we have Kenzie Wang, who's also the co founder and, you know, pretty OG personality in the crypto space. So yeah, guys pramod over to you to say something for the people.
00:03:22.534 - 00:03:48.112, Speaker B: Thank you. I'm a plumber. I like to build pipes for the information age. And the first sort of plumbing I was involved in very closely was when I was doing my PhD. And right after we did a startup and it became 4G. So then wireless networks, the Internet was there, wireless was phones and building networks that scaled to the world. And blockchains are similar eco spirit with incentives built in.
00:03:48.112 - 00:04:39.576, Speaker B: They are networks that align economics and incentives with people and of course, information. And now you have the era of AI, which are agents, artificially and intelligent agents together with humans that are natively interacting with each other. The platform that can align, that allow interactions, a, in a permissionless way, anyone can come in, b, sovereign. That means once your actions are defined, it executes. And c, incentive driven way is the basis for testing, building, designing, inventing, artificial general intelligence will come out of these kind of interactions. And the platform that enables such interactions is just blockchains. You can give another name, but it's just, that's what blockchains are.
00:04:39.576 - 00:04:58.124, Speaker B: They allow any number of agents to interact in an incentive driven, composable sovereign way. So that's what we are trying to build at sovereign, an AI native network that has all the ethos of the principles of blockchains behind it, but entirely for AI.
00:05:02.464 - 00:05:24.164, Speaker A: I would also like to get will on the stage, who is the head of ecosystem. He's like Ethereum OG, and not many people know, but basically he's technically the co founder of ETH research and works very closely with many heavyweights in the ethereum ecosystem. So, will, if you could also say a few things about sentient.
00:05:24.324 - 00:05:48.694, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. So super excited to get this kicked off. I think this is necessary. I think in the same way that we see finance needs to be decentralized, AI has a lot of the same core fundamental reasons. So, yeah, I've just been really excited to see this take off, support this effort and get this moving. So super excited. Yeah.
00:05:48.694 - 00:05:57.454, Speaker C: All right, so I'll invite Sam Lehman up here to begin to kick things off.
00:06:00.034 - 00:06:01.834, Speaker A: Everybody, I'm going to be.
