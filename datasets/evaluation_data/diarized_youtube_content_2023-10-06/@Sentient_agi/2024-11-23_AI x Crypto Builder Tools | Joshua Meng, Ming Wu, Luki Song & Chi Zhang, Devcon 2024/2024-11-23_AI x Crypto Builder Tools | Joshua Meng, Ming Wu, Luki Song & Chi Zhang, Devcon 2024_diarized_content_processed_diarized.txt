00:00:04.680 - 00:00:46.425, Speaker A: Hi everyone, fellow panelists, good to see you again. My name is Adrian. I'm principal architect for the Web3 team at Google. I've been working around eight, nine years in crypto. Now I work for Consensys as maybe you know, and I'm going to have the honor to present this beautiful panel around AI and crypto and builder tools. Right. So with us, maybe everyone can present what you're doing, what your company is doing, and what you're focusing on solving.
00:00:46.425 - 00:00:47.205, Speaker A: Maybe.
00:00:48.305 - 00:01:04.543, Speaker B: Thank you, Adrian. I think my microphone works very well. Thank you, Adrian. And thanks for everybody to attend this event. And thanks for the brilliant panelists who sit with me right here. So I'm Ivy. I'm heading up the marketing efforts in Chainbase.
00:01:04.543 - 00:01:46.065, Speaker B: So we're a omnichain data network that aims to revolutionize decentralized AI. So what we do is we grab every little bit of on chain data that's like raw data, transaction data, cross chain data, you name it, and then we wash them, we process them into usable APIs for everyone in need of the, you know, any sort of data requirements. So that's, you know, in a nutshell, that's what we do. And as of now, we're decentralizing our network. We're launching the minute at the end of this year. So everybody you know, please keep a close tap and follow us on Twitter. Thank you.
00:01:47.645 - 00:03:07.339, Speaker C: Hello everyone, I'm Ming Wu and I'm the co founder and CTO of ZERO G. And zero G is the first decentralized AI operating system. So we are targeting to provide a infrastructure and platform that can easily adapt your web to AI applications into the decentralized environment so that we provide the OS abstraction that can manage all the decentralized hardware like storage and the computation for all the AI applications so that we can provide the data verifiability and the computation verifiability and also coordinate all these decentralized applications to collaborate in a well organized way. And again, so we think that the decentralized environment has a lot of performance bottlenecks. So our system actually provide several components. So one is a highly scalable consensus protocol and another is a storage, decentralized storage network associated with the BA network. And also we have on top of that built a computing network and we have a service marketer layer to embed all this incentive mechanism and the fee marketplace for all these kind of resources for users to use them.
00:03:07.339 - 00:03:26.343, Speaker C: And we really, really want to make this system to solve this scalability problem so that we can, we have designed a Bunch of innovative sharding mechanisms on all these kind of components to make them have the horizontal scalability without any limitation. Yeah, so that's how they are.
00:03:26.439 - 00:03:27.647, Speaker A: Thank you, Joshua.
00:03:27.751 - 00:04:01.517, Speaker D: I'm Josh, I'm from Open. Actually, Open is only one day years old. We announced the merge yesterday. So it's a merger from RCS3, RCS Hub, open information Initiatives and a lot of different, a couple of technical products. So basically what Open does is that we have a network that primarily handles information abstraction and also compute abstraction like blockchains. Information is scattered around in different formats across web 1, web 2, web 3. And we try to make sure that we can structure these data and information.
00:04:01.517 - 00:04:36.807, Speaker D: So for anyone who's in need for search engines, for AI model trainings and stuff, and at the same time, compute is as scattered. You can see that compute could be decentralized, centralized, verifiable, closed. And we try to breeze these kind of compute resources into the same kind of standard and try to make sure that we could have high performance computing in a verifiable way. If we talk about specifically for AI, we act as kind of like the AI wormhole, where we wormhole the data or the information at the same time we hold the compute together. Yeah, that's basically what we do.
00:04:36.951 - 00:04:39.119, Speaker A: Okay, thank you, Andrea.
00:04:39.167 - 00:05:40.691, Speaker E: Thank you so much for inviting me and also thank you for Cynthia and all the audience. I'm Chi. I'm the co founder and CEO of Kite AI and Zeta Block Labs. So what KITE AI is doing is we're building the composable decentralized foundation that democratize AI by enabling scalable access to data and models. So we believe that AI data shortage or accessibility issue is going to be the next biggest bottleneck for AI after gpu. So that's why as the base layer of AI, we are really trying to create a foundational framework that can foster a transparent and accessible ecosystems of those key AI assets, which are the data and models and our architecture with purpose built identity and attribution mechanisms that can really enable participants, from enterprise to individuals to contribute, build and monetize data and models collaboratively. And we're launching our test nets by the end of the year.
00:05:40.691 - 00:05:56.615, Speaker E: So feel free to follow us on Twitter and join our discord. And by the way, we're also three days years old because we just launched our KAI AI network this Tuesday. Yeah.
00:05:57.075 - 00:06:26.077, Speaker A: All right, congrats then both of you. When we talk about the intersection of AI and Web3. Right. And in my speech a bit earlier, I said that it's good to look at, to look at it in two ways. You have first, how AI can help web3 and also how web3 can help AI. Right. So I'm going to divide some questions first for how AI can help Web3, right.
00:06:26.077 - 00:06:49.463, Speaker A: And so the first question, right, and I think everyone kind of thinks about it, is can AI bring more adoption to Web3 and if yes, how? Right. So another way to put the question is what is the killer use case right for AI in the web3 space and how does it bring adoption or how does it bring improvement of user experience? And I don't know, maybe if you want to start.
00:06:49.599 - 00:08:12.139, Speaker B: Okay, I'll go first, I'll just share my two cents. So I personally strongly believe that AI and Web3 has strong intersection with each other. While speaking of the killer apps, I know everybody's talking about AI agents and of course we've seen a lot of decentralized AI agents on the markets right now. But there is one possible big change in Web3 applications I would like to mention is actually gaming. So I personally believe the game maker, the whole designer of the game mechanics behind everything, if it's neutral, completely neutral and completely unbiased for everyone, that would be, you know, plus one on the current, especially blockchain plus gaming. So I do believe, you know, there's will be, there will be very interesting AI+Crypto Gaming in the market very soon. Although personally I haven't seen any and you know, of course I believe it's like before the mobile Internet emerged.
00:08:12.139 - 00:08:37.375, Speaker B: We can't even imagine some of our daily, our daily used apps that could happen, you know, and I believe there will be some killer apps on the market in probably a couple of months or in a year or two that beyond our imagination and I personally would like to see that day coming.
00:08:37.865 - 00:08:38.961, Speaker A: Okay, thank you.
00:08:39.033 - 00:09:33.693, Speaker C: So yeah, so I certainly believe that the AI can help a lot for the Web three maybe majorly from three aspects. So one is the user experience. So that we know that in the blockchain world the user experience is very, very different than user in the web tool. So for example, the user need to manage their private keys, which is random numbers that hardly remember and you need to keep that in some safe place and kind of a tedious stuff. And a lot of users actually don't understand what signature means. And many smart contracts they need to, many transactions, they need to send and they need to send. What's that? Right? So I think with AI technology actually it can make this user experience more user friendly that can manage these tricky cryptographic tricky stuff for users so that user don't need to worry about that.
00:09:33.693 - 00:10:41.069, Speaker C: And I do believe that on the other side, I think in this case, because the AI is managing the user assets for the users, so the truly decentralized AI is really needed because it needs to be very, very safe so that without any centralized manipulation of that kind of thing. And the second aspect is the security stuff. So because the blockchain technology is kind of a very tricky distributed system. So for example, the consensus system is kind of, you need to carefully design, carefully engineering that and then AI actually gives you capability and tools to explore some potential attacking scenarios that can break your system. So that can help you easily, more easily find your system bug so that I can fix that very quickly. I think that makes this testing process more effective and more secure. And the third aspect is the development.
00:10:41.069 - 00:10:58.565, Speaker C: So we can use AI to help the smart contract developers to quickly generate a lot of smart contract code to help you significantly accelerate your development of your dapps and makes you, makes developers focused on the key part of the logic. Yeah, I think.
00:10:58.725 - 00:11:02.189, Speaker A: Okay, thank you. I think that's very clear. Josh, maybe if you.
00:11:02.277 - 00:11:38.053, Speaker D: Yeah, just add one thing because. Yeah, for the time. Yeah. So I think these AI agents right now are in a way the first time in world computer science or Internet history where a software or we call like a, like a human made artifact. They, they were never given the right to do things on chain. They have the ability to actually start an account and do activities and activate actually just act upon their own thinking in a way if they have any thinking. And we have been observing some of these coming up.
00:11:38.053 - 00:12:21.811, Speaker D: I think more likely that there will be more interesting synergies. When you see AI agents doing a lot of different stuff on a place where they couldn't, you know, possibly do before and, and that's gonna bring in more human interactions as well. I think it, there might be more synergies and more combinations there. When, especially when after AI agents are more secure and more mature and you know, if you look at how agents are built today, it's still very, very primary. Right. It's very, very Nate naive at the moment, but I think with a bit more time it could be more decentralized, it could be more safe, smarter and hypothetically to bring more innovations and creations to the Web3 ecosystem.
00:12:21.963 - 00:12:28.875, Speaker A: Okay, thank you. Yeah, I think it answers some of the next part as well. But do you have anything to add on this?
00:12:29.035 - 00:13:25.539, Speaker E: Yes. First of all, I actually really like what Ming mentioned about user experience and the development piece Just add on top of that a bit. We actually work with a lot of customers that we see some of the user experience piece that they are using AI to help web3 right now. Because again web3 now with all those jargons and specific wallets and swap DAC sacks type of specific Web3 tools, it's very hard for Web2 users to adopt. So then in that case people build agents, for example helping you to automatically swap different tokens in different stacks without writing any code or doing anything. You just use language to tell them or the AI models where agent will help you to find the best yield in the landing pools. So that's all the things we see.
00:13:25.539 - 00:14:28.597, Speaker E: And for the development piece that is where I want to add a little bit where we, you know, like see even in web2 because AI coder in web2 has actually become real. You probably heard like a Daven is, you know, the first AI coders that's been built out and recently actually in a small event that Sam Altman was giving, you know, like some of the insights about what OpenAI is going to go next. Because I was in that event, I was you know hearing like AI coding is actually one of the big ones that they're going to do, which means and they believe there's going to be trillions of markets to really help increase the development. And I feel like that's exactly the same will be reflected in the in the web3 space. And the last one probably is money related because again if we think about crypto at this moment, the real product market fits we found probably is stablecoin and a little bit defi. So in the end of the day we see a lot of the models and the use cases built are all about money. Either help you to make more money or help you to protect your money.
00:14:28.597 - 00:14:45.385, Speaker E: So help your money is already we talked about find the best yields or you know, help you to do trading but protect your money is really about, you know, how to do those better real time like a risk detection management of the on chain transactions and all those stuff. So that's are some of the concrete use cases we observed.
00:14:45.805 - 00:15:17.303, Speaker A: All right, thank you. And just wondering if you guys have concrete examples of projects that you know, maybe you've developed or maybe some examples of projects that are out there or tools that are using AI and helping on these different fronts. Right. So we talked about AI agents, we talked about security, user experience and so on. Right. I think personally like Forta for example, tenderly as well Metamask Snaps are doing this kind of Stuff that are quite cool. Now using AI to improve user experience and security in the same.
00:15:17.303 - 00:15:23.595, Speaker A: Do you have some maybe name dropping a few projects that you like very quickly like that are using AI today?
00:15:24.175 - 00:15:49.363, Speaker E: Action Forta is our customer and exactly what the use cases you're talking about. Forta and Open Zeppelin, they used to build like more predictive ML using extraboost type of models but now everybody's adapting, you know, Transformer and for example like the GPT for. Yeah. Some of the use cases like the on chain transaction fraud detection that has been quite an improvement.
00:15:49.419 - 00:15:52.107, Speaker A: Yeah. Any other use case maybe you guys can think about.
00:15:52.251 - 00:16:31.643, Speaker D: We have a framework called Open Agent and there's a project called I think it's called Funguy. It's built upon the framework, they call it the Defi Agent nonchain. Basically it's not actually an automatic or like autonomous agent. Right. It doesn't really do things without commands, but still it handles a lot of commands. If you want to say okay, observe the price of something and then try to do purchase and sales you can tell them to moving particular assets from one pool to another. And I think at the moment this is one of the ways where these agents could be helping people without being individually or independently doing things themselves.
00:16:31.819 - 00:16:32.539, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:16:32.667 - 00:16:49.761, Speaker C: So we have an ecosystem partner project called Octane who is doing the using AI to maintain the security of the on chain activity like a smart contract audit and also explore the potential bugs in the distributed system. The consensus protocol stuff.
00:16:49.793 - 00:16:51.245, Speaker A: Yeah, very cool.
00:16:51.665 - 00:17:51.127, Speaker B: Well actually as a data provider for the industry, so we do have a lot of partners that work with us. For example, GO plus. Right. So GO plus work with Chainbase and plus their own in house AI models to help further improve their protection for all of their retail users by integration of the high quality data that we provided and of course the smart algorithm that developed by GoPro themselves. I believe their whole efficiency increased more than six times just very recently. Just before this event, our data scheme manuscript just integrated with Google Gemini. So yeah, Gemini hugely help us to help developers to design and contribute their own data schema into the whole chain based data network.
00:17:51.127 - 00:17:53.735, Speaker B: So yeah, I think that's the two cases that I want.
00:17:53.775 - 00:18:23.087, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you. So yeah, a lot of alpha I guess. Okay, so if we now think about how Web3 can help AI now. Right. And so I think that's maybe a bit more futuristic or. But I think the first good question is what's wrong with the current centralized AI right As we know it today in your words and why are we trying to decentralize it and what does it mean exactly? Right, Maybe I'll do.
00:18:23.087 - 00:18:23.551, Speaker A: Yeah, go ahead.
00:18:23.583 - 00:18:59.555, Speaker D: I think technology, or like Internet technology in general, intelligence technology have been penetrating human lives in an unprecedented way. Right? You could have autonomous cars, whatever you might be having, robots taking care of your family and trust is always a big deal, right? You want to make sure that whatever is taking care of your children actually, you know, does that instead of something malicious. So I think in general what's going to happen is that if we want technology to keep improving and especially penetrating our daily lives, then we have to make sure they are safe. And openness, decentralization, trustworthiness have to be that way.
00:19:00.335 - 00:19:34.391, Speaker C: Another factor for the centralized AI is that it is not a fair reward distribution system because the AI model is very powerful and valuable. Right. But the creation of the AI model is actually accrued a lot of contributions from the different, many, many different partitions around the world. So how we can distribute all these the AI model rewards to fairly to distribute to all these contributors, that's a problem. And currently I think centralized AI does not do that things well.
00:19:34.463 - 00:20:57.683, Speaker B: Yeah, just adding my two cents to Ming's previous node. I personally also strongly agree that currently the Web2 giants, who holds up to the large language models or data providers, their contribution is not fairly rewarded. Well, I mean a lot of, well as we know a lot of the data indexers around the globe, especially in the probably like Africa or other or Southeast Asia countries, they are paid very, very poorly. So not worth of their time at all. So I think decentralized AI will help to fairly distribute the rewards that they deserve to a great deal and well, I mean currently. And another point I would like to mention is currently most of the models and most of the large language models can only be afforded to train and developed by Web2Gants. So a lot of smaller players don't have enough resources or don't have enough bandwidth to cover the cost or to participate or to even get into the game.
00:20:57.683 - 00:21:02.135, Speaker B: And decentralized AI will greatly improve that.
00:21:03.795 - 00:21:57.509, Speaker E: So I think decentralized AI the biggest value to the mainstream AI will be democratization. So what does that mean is we have. I have been building in AI for over 10 years because I did my PhD from UC Berkeley focused on machine learning first. At the time after school, the first AI startup that I built was a automated machine learning company. And that time we already call it Democratize AI. But at the time the democratization we're talking about is more about technology to make sure everybody even like you know, we call citizen data scientists can build machinery models without coding. However, right now I think one of the biggest problem, just like Avi pointed out, is not everybody, actually only a handful of companies can really train models because they have the access and the resources to GPU and data.
00:21:57.509 - 00:22:33.975, Speaker E: However, most of the people don't. Most of the researchers, even in universities and institutions don't even have enough data access and compute resources. So in the end of the day, decentralized AI can really help us to have a trustless and scalable way to bring all those resource providers together and collaborate. In that case we can really encourage smaller teams of researchers and developers to build more innovative models and agents on top of that. And that's the only way for us to keep up the innovation in the long run.
00:22:34.755 - 00:22:49.695, Speaker A: So is it just about decentralizing the models then and like creating new models or is there anything else? Right, and like the added value for the end users? Right?
00:22:50.275 - 00:23:29.033, Speaker E: Yeah. I mean if you think about that right now, a lot of there's not going to be foundation model is not going to be enough. There's going to be a lot of smaller models or even a customized model built on top of them. Why do we need those is because we actually want to help end users, not only individual users but also enterprises to build better specialized models and agents for the tasks they need. So in the end of the day by helping developers to build more specialized or even intelligent models via accessing better data and GPU is in the end of the day helping the end users to have better AI solutions.
00:23:29.169 - 00:23:39.045, Speaker A: And so what's the broker today to have decentralized AI to train new models using Web3 like what's missing?
00:23:39.745 - 00:23:41.417, Speaker E: Sorry, could you repeat the question?
00:23:41.601 - 00:24:10.565, Speaker A: What's missing to have this decentralized AI that we talk about which is know training new models in a decentralized way and we have these models operate in a decentralized way. We have, you know, hugging face Kaggle that have a lot of open source models. Google also has open source models. So what is missing to get to this decentralization of AI? Right like that we talk about which is decentralized inference, decentralized models and so on.
00:24:11.305 - 00:24:35.391, Speaker E: I'll quickly say that and leave the time to others. But I think there's two reasons. One is for hugging face everything is open source. Actually not only like the model developers and data providers are not having any incentive in this process. Hugging Face themselves is very struggling with their business model as well. They're not making money. So in the end of the Day I think it's very fundamental broken of the AI economy in this process.
00:24:35.391 - 00:24:59.193, Speaker E: And the second reason about when you talk about decentralized inference and decentralized training, I think there's a lot of infrastructure bottleneck here. But again there's a lot of great improvement and breakthrough. Recently a lot of researcher groups even in Web2 are doing, for example Google DeepMind recently launched the local and deep type of framework for decentralized training. So hopefully that's what help us to get to the next level.
00:24:59.369 - 00:25:00.577, Speaker A: Any other opinion?
00:25:00.681 - 00:25:53.749, Speaker C: Yeah, so I think the first missing part is the well designed perfect verifiability stuff. So basically although we have a lot of open source models, but we don't know that model, how they are trained, from what data they train so superficially they could look very useful but we don't know in some corner case it could be not aligned with human value and attention. So we really need to monitor the entire training process with some verifiability of stuff. So currently I think there are a lot of several verifiability mechanism proposed like the hardware based solution TE and also the ZK stuff and also the OP kind of stuff. But all these kind of stuff is not that perfect. Right. So either they have the performance bottleneck or they are not very secure.
00:25:53.749 - 00:26:29.187, Speaker C: And this is one part, another piece is that in a decentralized environment, if we think about very, very large scale, like millions of GPUs from the Internet, we cannot assume that these bandwidth can be infinite high. So we definitely need to make the training process happen in the bandwidth constraint environment. So how the training process with a large model and large language model, with a huge amount of data that can be trained efficiently in that kind of environment. That's a big question. Yeah, that's good. Yeah, big challenge.
00:26:29.331 - 00:26:47.075, Speaker A: Thank you. And, and I think last question would be when are we going to have the first versions of this decentralized AI? And is there any instances that are running now and any projects that are worth looking at today?
00:26:47.695 - 00:27:20.419, Speaker D: I think there are definitely a lot more projects working on the decentralized model or like decentralized process for training a specific model. Right. And I think a couple years ago people started to work out more on federal learning and there are different approaches, local first and whatever. But it's still, I think if you're talking about a fully functional one or like competitive one against centralized ones for an AI model, I'd say about three years, five years maybe, I don't really know. But yeah.
00:27:20.587 - 00:27:22.815, Speaker A: Okay, another guess.
00:27:24.915 - 00:28:12.989, Speaker B: Well, actually, well, Chainbase, you Know we just launched, we just open source a crypto vertical foundation model on hugging face. But it's a baby step. So it's basically still an alpha version and I believe there are several such cases on the market as well. But you know, as Ming and Chi just mentioned before, so for AI basically. Right. So it's a bottom up sort of approach. So we have to have better decentralized computing resource solutions, decentralized data providers, that's what Chainbase is building is working for and you know, and then we can talk about decentralized models.
00:28:12.989 - 00:28:43.505, Speaker B: So I think we're still in a very early stage or personally I can't really predict a specific timeframe but you know, but I think, you know, with you know, everybody, we've seen so much good solutions already, you know, like IO and Ether for decentralized computing resources. While data providers. I believe there are a lot of data providers as well, so I believe that they won't be so far. So I'm probably a little bit more optimistic than Josh. I don't think we need five years.
00:28:43.585 - 00:28:44.285, Speaker A: Okay.
00:28:48.185 - 00:29:38.905, Speaker E: I think it's really about depends on what's your definition of decentralized AI? If your definition about decentralized AI is you know, is like the community where like kind of like a contributed resources for you to help you to train AI model, then it's already happening and actually we have customers and partners who already built those models in production environment. But if your thoughts or definitions about it's literally to be fully decentralized and everything is even like a one model can be decentralized and distributed, chopped into many different pieces and run in different nodes, then that's a little bit far away. But I still think that's probably going to happen in three years. Especially if we're talking about small foundation model, very large foundation model, then that's another beast. But we will see.
00:29:39.445 - 00:30:14.345, Speaker A: Thank you. Thanks a lot. I, yeah, I really think and I think maybe some stuff that could be interesting on how you know, Web3 can help. AI is also on the notarization. Right. We didn't talk really about that but we have a lot of content with AI, fake images, fake articles and so using blockchain to have digital signatures of a news outlet to encore notarize an article on the blockchain and have traceability of it and so on. Stuff like that is web3 for AI as well.
00:30:14.345 - 00:30:33.223, Speaker A: And I think that is much, much closer than everything we talked about. Right. And of course I hope it goes in this direction. Right, of course. But yeah, I think there is a lot of other topics maybe around authorization and traceability that I hope will happen. But thanks a lot for all.
00:30:33.279 - 00:30:33.855, Speaker D: Thank you.
00:30:33.975 - 00:30:34.711, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:30:34.863 - 00:30:35.663, Speaker E: Thank you so much.
00:30:35.759 - 00:30:36.175, Speaker C: Thanks a lot.
