00:00:01.160 - 00:00:57.743, Speaker A: Okay, we are moving into our next panel, which is titled VCs on Decentralized AI. For this panel we have Joey Krug, he's a partner at Founders Fund. Cheryl Chan, who is a partner at Dragonfly, and Davy Wan, who is the founding partner at Primitive Ventures. And myself, I will be moderating and I'm an investor at Symbolic Capital. All right, so just to get things started, I want to get a little bit of a lay of the land for the audience here. Dovey, maybe you could start if you could just give us a little more context on your fund and specifically a bit of your approach to how you see the decentralized AI landscape.
00:00:57.879 - 00:01:23.123, Speaker B: Yeah. So, hi everyone. My name is Davi Wan and I'm founder of Primitive Ventures. We are not a vc, but write VC checks. And because we don't have any LP and just our own money investing on the balance sheet. So we've been investing Frontier Tech, like Frontier Tech because crypto used to be under FinTech since 2014 and then become its own category. And so having investing frontier tech since 2014.
00:01:23.123 - 00:01:50.157, Speaker B: And so, and also like AI prior to the Transformer era. And then so it's mostly on computer vision. Yeah. And then so when it comes to like crypto AI and I think like both of them are like orthogonal. And so because like crypto change how money and value transfer. And then it's basically reorganizing our desired societals. So like reorganizing our societal, like value, like value supply chain.
00:01:50.157 - 00:02:54.475, Speaker B: And then when it so well, so when it comes to AI because AI is a huge category and then so pick up like after like chatgpt and like chatgpt is more of like a revolution when it comes to medium. So when it comes to alternative distribution, because what ChatGPT has done is basically instantly create like a new distribution channel like out of the iOS and then so out of like Google Play and then with like 100 million sign up in just like three months. So it's every major technology. So any major tech innovation is about alternative distribution. So if we specifically talk about LLM as a new AI meta, and I really think that's like alternative distribution that we have seen so for our era and also fundamentally so it basically make human language into programming language. And then so like what like used to be like 10x engineer and then so now can be 100x engineer. So I think like in the future we are going to see a.
00:02:54.475 - 00:03:05.295, Speaker B: What I consider as like a super solo. Like super solo is that you can be just a one team army and then so probably can make like just hundreds of millions of ar. Yeah.
00:03:05.955 - 00:03:11.009, Speaker A: Then Cheryl, maybe just a little bit on yourself and then how Dragonfly sees space.
00:03:11.177 - 00:03:23.849, Speaker C: Sure. Hi everyone. I'm Shara from Dragonfly. Dragonfly is only a Web3 fund. We don't do anything in Web2. Recently we've been paying a little bit more attention into AI and crypto. I think the reason for that has been pretty straightforward.
00:03:23.849 - 00:03:55.885, Speaker C: We think that in AI, because of the way compute and data has been set up, there's inherently a very centralizing force to that in which there is a lot of trust assumptions to be had. We think that's kind of a perfect marriage with crypto in which there is a need for a trustless, permissionless, more democratic solution in which you're putting power back into the people. So we've been looking at AI crypto pretty closely. We're pretty proud to have partnered with quite a few portfolio companies that we're sure will do very great things. And yeah, thanks for, thanks for having me today.
00:03:56.425 - 00:03:58.805, Speaker A: And Joey, maybe about yourself and founders.
00:03:59.105 - 00:04:43.785, Speaker D: Sure. So I'm a partner at Founders Fund. Our main model investing, which is the same model we apply to crypto as well, is we try to find, you know, really zero to one ideas that are like, you know, really novel or have some sort of technical edge or distribution edge. And then the other thing that's really important for us is, you know, backing the best founders. You know, we're, I think, the only VC fund that's been around since 2005 that's never fired and never will fire a founder. And then we like to try to find, you know, people and companies that we think become market dominant players in terms of the crypto and AI space. You know, we've only made two investments there, one of which is sentient, which I'm sure we'll talk about in a moment.
00:04:43.785 - 00:05:35.505, Speaker D: I think there's, you know, part of the problem, I think is that, you know, today in AI, the financial incentive is really only to do closed source. There actually is no good financial incentive for open source yet I think since you, you know, hopefully solve that. There's the other area that I think is quite interesting. We haven't made an investment in it yet, but the area of like creating sort of kind of an open marketplace for compute, not the style where you try to like everyone run their own, you know, home gpu, but rather just like an actual large marketplace for compute. Because today all the platforms are effectively brokers. It sort of kind of reminds me of like Wall street, back in the bucket shop era where very few people actually traded on the exchanges, everyone went to the brokers. And so I think maybe that scenario where decentralized tech could help there, but haven't done anything yet.
00:05:36.645 - 00:06:11.515, Speaker A: And so actually on that point, Joe, I want to push you a little bit because your colleagues at Founders Fund recently published a well received piece, or very least a controversial piece, pushing for closed source AI over open source, given it's a better business model. And then a couple months after that you go and lead an $85 million round into Sentient, which is explicitly building an open source platform for AI. Just tell me more about your thesis on investing in open source AI projects.
00:06:12.095 - 00:07:01.755, Speaker D: Yes, I think, I mean, first I'd say as a fun. Founders Fund is, you know, very good at holding two opposing ideas in our head at the same time and then, you know, making decisions accordingly. We don't have like, you know, one kind of, you know, firm wide, you know, 1984 style thing that you kind of have to, everyone has to agree upon. But even outside of that, you know, I actually agree with kind of about 95% of that piece John wrote about closed versus open source AI. I think today it's true, the financial incentives for closed source are far better than open source AI. The reason is because once you publish an open source model today, anyone can just use it and so it's very, very difficult to monetize off of it. Facebook has some ideas, maybe they'll be able to monetize because they can monetize off their user base somehow.
00:07:01.755 - 00:07:54.595, Speaker D: But even that's questionable. There's some talk that Zuckerberg will probably open source the next model, but is probably not going to open source the 50 to 100 billion dollar training run model. So I think that's part of it. The one part of the piece that I kind of disagree with is I don't think one of the other arguments for closed source is national security concerns. And I think those are a little overrated. Just in the sense that if you read the press like OpenAI was hacked in 2023, a lot of these security concerns, you know, I would sort of just assume, like if you made me bet on it, I would assume that, you know, the Chinese government probably already has access to the weights of a lot of us, you know, closed source models. Not based on any inside information, just based on what I would bet on.
00:07:54.595 - 00:08:13.925, Speaker D: And if that's the case, and you kind of take the bet that it's very unlikely that the US government or any of these private companies in the US could actually secure our models in a closed source world, then open source doesn't really have the downside that it seems. If you assume that the world is insecure, which I sort of do.
00:08:15.745 - 00:08:38.818, Speaker A: And to steer the conversation a little bit, Cheryl, we know each other a little bit and you're one of my favorite skeptics in the crypto AI investing space. Can you tell me a little bit about which subverticles within this larger domain of crypto AI projects are most interesting to you? Where do you think there is a real need to decentralize AI? What gets you excited?
00:08:38.946 - 00:09:41.029, Speaker C: Yeah, I think just to kind of follow up on what Joey was talking about because I think what was important in the decision behind Sentient was really in that crypto kind of has this unique advantage in order to make open source AI profitable for its data contributors, for the model developers. And really the way it's trying to do that is by basically trying to have attribution on chain. And I think kind of having that win win scenario of when crypto can inherently make AI better or the other way around is kind of why Dragonfly wants to be an AI crypto itself. So you've talked about how, you know, I'm a little bit skeptical of a lot of these people were projects that have been going on in the space and raising 100mil rounds right off the bat. I think for us what's really important is kind of finding an angle where in the hyper financialization of crypto can make AI better. So for example, one of the projects that we recently invested in is called My Shell. My Shell is kind of a.
00:09:41.029 - 00:10:27.835, Speaker C: Today it's kind of like a tokenized character AI, but in the future it has plans to be kind of a launchpad for AI assets. So if you look at it today, it's basically just a marketplace for AI chat bots, for example. And what crypto is inherently doing is creating this hyper financialized aspect of social betting in which you can kind of bet on different agents that you think will be providing the most value going forward. So instead of having users paying for subscriptions to talk to chatbots in the way Web2 currently is, which is the usual monetization model without Web3. Now you're having Web3 speculators come in into the ecosystem and kind of really bootstrap and hyper accelerate that flywheel. So we're kind of looking for edge cases like that in which AI and crypto naturally can come together.
00:10:29.575 - 00:10:57.565, Speaker A: And then dovey to bring you into the conversation. Are there any areas where you think centralization is really essential for a specific crypto AI project? Are there any sort of vectors within a startup stack that you think maybe, at least initially centralization is good and then there can be progressive decentralization. So how do you think about that, this idea of progressive decentralization within the world of crypto AI for investments that you're looking at?
00:10:57.725 - 00:12:09.501, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think there's like a spectrum of like. So there's a spectrum when we talk about decentralization, right? And then also are we talking about the training itself? Are we talking about the data pipeline? Are we talking about like the inferences? And then so I think so like there's like a spectrum and like there's like a different stacks, right? So for us and then so we don't look at like the thing like that. And so like probably just like take a step back. So if we think about smartphone, right? So like smartphone basically made all the like the small consumer gadgets like obsolete, right? Just like before smartphones and we have like camera, we have like recorder, we have gps, we have all different like small consumer gadgets that we have to just collect for our daily applications. And then so I also think that it will be probably the same for AI and then so decentralized also. And then also DAI in the future. So they will potentially make all different SaaS application and especially verticalized SAS and then so long and also long and then verticalized SAS as well as all these long tail SaaS obsolete as well.
00:12:09.501 - 00:13:11.233, Speaker B: Just like give you one quick example. And so we internally we have a lot of meeting notes and then so we don't and then also recording and stuff like that. And so I myself, I write a lot of my personal journal and also sometimes and I actually record my dream as well. So probably wake up in the middle of the night and I just quickly snap my phone and then just talk about what I have dream, right? And then so for all this I recording and also for many lawyers as well, so they cannot. So it's much better for them to do local computation when it comes to process all of this information. So that's why when I think about decentralization, so I think about what the user need is right? And then so like currently we are running so currently we are running Alpaca which is like a local model. And then because we don't want to upload any of this so like we don't want to upload any of this material to the cloud and to the Microsoft cloud, right? And Then so like once we can so and then first of all we have to run the local transcription.
00:13:11.233 - 00:14:15.127, Speaker B: So that is one model from Nvidia which is small enough can fit into your local MacBook and then once we have the transcript and so we just process all the transcript also using local model. And then so that is how can the individual investor founders or future entrepreneurs so can safeguard their secret sauce. And so I think when it comes to like the decentralization versus decentralization question. Yeah, and I think it's okay because for the so for like the new startup founders it's very hard for so it's very hard for them to like just had to battle with like meta to battle with OpenAI when it comes to compute resources. And then so we can just say let them to just say dump money like to like all the competition problem. And then so like once we have that and and then so like when it comes to like edge computation, local compute and also verifiable so verifiable inferences and so in the future and what license. So what and so Westentian is working on as well.
00:14:15.127 - 00:14:24.635, Speaker B: So can also probably give like alternative attribution model. So to empower all the individual creator and then just like knowledge workers. Yeah.
00:14:24.935 - 00:14:54.775, Speaker A: Okay. And then I wanted to maybe take a step back, look at the greater landscape. This investing market has been kind of crazy for a while and I think we've seen a lot of big rounds happening as VCs. Now how are you seeing pricing change maybe Cheryl, do you want to start? How does it also feel as a VC to be in a market like this? Are you hoping that changes? What are you seeing?
00:14:55.805 - 00:15:41.625, Speaker C: Yeah, so you're also asking me of like coming off vacation for two weeks. So my commentary will be pre vacation. This was a nice welcome back by the way. But I think for, I think we have been seeing prices come up quite a lot and I think the reason for that is, you know, it's never just the founders, but VCs have also been willing to fund projects at these pricing. I do believe in, you know, demand and supply slowly working out. I do hear our founders starting to negotiate a little bit more on pricing. So it has softened a little bit in the last couple of weeks.
00:15:41.625 - 00:15:49.435, Speaker C: But really I do think that the overall risk reward probably hasn't been as attractive as it was say early this year.
00:15:49.935 - 00:15:54.275, Speaker A: Joey, maybe do you want to weigh in as somebody who was involved in one of the bigger rounds recently?
00:15:54.815 - 00:16:35.437, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, I think. Yeah, I mean there's no way to deny it. Pricing is certainly, you know, substantially higher than it was this time a year ago. It's probably substantially higher than it was this time six months ago. And I think it's probably going to still be substantially higher six months from now than it is today. I think the implication of that is you just have to be a lot more selective in terms of what investments you do make. I think there's also some investments where there actually is a downside to raising too much capital or too crazy evaluation.
00:16:35.437 - 00:16:58.025, Speaker D: And so there's some founders that are kind of very rational about that because they've been a founder before or whatever. So those are rounds that you can kind of always do irrespective of where the market cycle's at. You know, I think, yeah, I think the market's definitely gotten, you know, a lot crazier than it was a quarter ago.
00:16:58.405 - 00:17:25.275, Speaker A: And then speaking on founders, when you're identifying or you know, evaluating an investment within the crypto AI space, how important is it to for somebody in the founding team or multiple founders to have Web2AI experience? Is that valuable to you? Are you wary of investing in pure web3 founders trying to do this new AI thing? Joey, maybe you want to start again?
00:17:25.695 - 00:17:58.955, Speaker D: Yeah, I think it's useful to have at least one person on the founding team with some AI background, whether that's academic or an industry. I don't think it's like as important as hiring really smart AI people. I mean like the most famous AI company that's created, the most valuable other than Nvidia. But if you look at the private markets as OpenAI, Sam Altman had no AI background. And so I think, you know, whenever. Whenever you have like a super hard and fast rule about anything as an investor, there always tends to be some exception to it. But I think generally it's.
00:17:58.955 - 00:18:00.275, Speaker D: It's useful for sure.
00:18:00.615 - 00:18:02.695, Speaker A: W do you want to weigh in?
00:18:02.855 - 00:18:46.991, Speaker B: Yeah. And then also just one just want to add on devaluation question. Right. So because I chat with a lot of this Web2AI founders or like Web2AI crypto bandwagoners. So they have this like very idealistic or just I decide fantasize moment on okay because I work one is I at the top is close to like 100 billion coin and so I can launch like 10% of work one or even 5% of work coin rate. But the thing is most of them just don't understand how crypto capital market works and work on it just I guess an optimal. So it's just like a send Altman min Coin right? And then so like that is so like the fact that like work on has no intrinsic value, has most of the capitalization value.
00:18:46.991 - 00:19:37.915, Speaker B: So many of these web tree founders so they just don't get it right. And so like their mental model is around decide market valuation comparison and then same for many VC as well. So like currently for many this crypto VC and I think their valuation model is just that everything come to either work one or like or just big tensor. But like bittensor is like a low flow coin and it's like a pow low for a coin, just a virtual pow low flow coin like just from the star. So I think there's a lot of like just, just totally unrealistic expectation when it comes to valuation and we have seen like most of the AI like the crypto I think try to raise like a 200 million or like 100 million as like a pre C round. And then so now it's heavily rerated. Yeah.
00:19:37.915 - 00:20:15.447, Speaker B: So like one of the very notable ones so like was racing at 300 million a month ago at like Dubai token 2049. And then so now the valuation like down to 100 and then so once you try to down racing and it's like a pretty weak signal. Right. It's like a supply demand. Right. So anyway so when it comes to founder and I think so like founder like yeah, so like definitely he needs to understand what AI can enable and then so what AI can so and what AI can have a really nice union point. So really nice union point with like crypto.
00:20:15.447 - 00:20:52.695, Speaker B: Right. And then so and then also because if you're like a new founder and then you have to leverage it like your three capital, social capital, human capital and then also intellectual capital. Right. So to better race. And so I so I think like if so if so if like a non AI founder like he or she can so can hire some relatively good like AI researchers and then so like that would be a really good sign. And then so and then like the actual crypto dominant founder like needs to handle all this financial populism stuff. Right? And then so community branding and like narrative crafting and like all this.
00:20:52.695 - 00:21:10.439, Speaker B: And then so my advice for all the founders is imagine yourself as a producer of a movie, right? And so you have to hire the director and then so also you have to work with the director to hire a cast of actor and actresses. So that is like a rough mental model we have.
00:21:10.567 - 00:21:54.155, Speaker A: Okay, I want to go down the line now, looking ahead and ask what categories are exciting to you the most within this Space moving forward and with a particular carve out for seeing a lot of infra companies getting funded in this space and not a lot of consumer projects. And I'm also curious, you know, do you think that the Crypto AI market is going to go the same direction of Web3 more generally, which is a ton of money in infra and underinvestment and sort of, I think associated underutilization of consumer applications. Let me start with Joey and then working our way down.
00:21:56.015 - 00:23:01.099, Speaker D: Yeah, in terms of the AI side, I think, you know, the stuff that's less interesting to me is like the sort of, you know, on chain, fully verified like inference or some of the ZKML stuff. I think it's. There's not really that much demand for people kind of, you know, either as users or on the AI community side stuff. I'm excited about, you know, what Sentient's doing. I'm excited about some of the GPU marketplaces. I think the, I think someone will create something on the consumer side which is more like, you know, probably by the time GPT5 is out, it'll be possible to do this in a way that actually works really good, which is like, you know, a really simple interface to use crypto where you just kind of say, you know, hey, I want to deposit, you know, 100 ETH into Metama or into maker and borrow, you know, this amount of USDC and then automatically send it to my coinbase and sell it for dollars and like you should be able to plug into all the APIs to do that. Outside of that, the kind of more broader question of infrastructure versus consumer.
00:23:01.099 - 00:23:43.999, Speaker D: Yeah, there's still a lot of infrastructure stuff in crypto. You know, we've been funding some stuff on the infra side. We've also been funding some stuff on the consumer side. I think, you know, poly market's one of the bigger consumer bets we did and I think that's going to continue to get even bigger, you know, into the election, I think. Yeah, there's one, there's one or two others as well that haven't been announced yet. But I think, you know, I've been investing in crypto for, you know, since like, you know, 2017 as VC and I'd say I've probably done, you know, more consumer stuff, you know, in the last eight or nine months than I did, you know, and all the time prior to that. So I think there finally is some early consumer stuff starting to, starting to happen.
00:23:43.999 - 00:23:49.035, Speaker D: But it's still early in a, you know, a minority of deals as opposed to a majority.
00:23:52.335 - 00:25:04.955, Speaker C: This is a very loaded question by the way. I feel like this could have gone on for like the entire 40 minutes. I think what I hate about a lot of founders raising is that they typically go for, okay, what is really highly valued in the markets right now? What is the narrative that VCs are pouring a lot of money and let me go start that right now. Many times it's pretty obvious from the first couple of calls. And so I would say that I, as much as we have a fiduciary duty to our shareholders, I definitely try to keep my eyes peeled to what actually makes sense, what can have actual product market fit, what makes sense technically, regardless of how it might be valued on the token listing. With that said, I think things like on chain training is still very, very difficult today in terms of the infra like architecturally, what it has to be done, the parallelization of workloads in a distributed way, it still does not feasibly make sense. So we have not been putting too much time there.
00:25:04.955 - 00:25:39.781, Speaker C: I am very curious as to what has been happening lately in decentralized fine tuning and model alignment, model distillation, model compression. I think that is very fascinating. Um, something like distributed inference for example, which can be done on a single note. That's obviously very feasible today from a go to market perspective. That also seems really interesting. Um, like I mentioned Michelle, we've been investing heavily into consumer apps as well. Um, so I think for us it's more a matter of just first principles.
00:25:39.781 - 00:25:46.615, Speaker C: Does it make sense? Do we think it adds value? Um, is there a way that AI crypto marriage can come together?
00:25:49.275 - 00:26:28.275, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think for us is consumer versus infrastructure. Okay, so the infrastructure, so economic infrastructure is also an infrastructure and then economic. So do you consider money as an infos so like as an economic infrastructure or as an economic application? Because I think like money is the biggest, both the biggest application and also infrastructure when it comes to crypto. Right. And just that is a global magical Internet money. So I think when it comes to crypto AI and so for now, so like what we are seeing for now is so there's a lot of so.
00:26:28.275 - 00:27:26.061, Speaker B: Well, so what I consider those as a economic infrastructure, middleware for AI. So for instance we invest in, so we invest in Sapien and which is a like decentralized like data pipeline. So for future AI training, basically what Sapien is doing is OpenAI right now. So they hire millions of Africans in Nigeria, in Kenya and basically to do their human reinforcement learning on their AI model and then so they basically pay everyone one to two dollar per hour. And then Sapien basically tried to do it in a more collective like crowdsourcing way and then just say make it pretty fun. So imagine just like Access Infinity version but for AI reinforcement training. So like that's what I consider as more as this data, like just a data economic like middleware.
00:27:26.061 - 00:27:44.609, Speaker B: Right. And also like the other AI portfolio we have is like hyperspace. And so hyperspace basically is like a decentralized network of like local computer. Yeah. So like that is also. So that's probably more on like the infrastructure side. Yeah.
00:27:44.609 - 00:28:07.341, Speaker B: And so I think like crypto. So like what is like, so what is crypto really good for is for alternative distribution and also for alternative value attribution. So if you can build center around this two fundamental elements and does not matter whether you are like categorized as application or infrastructure. Yeah, great.
00:28:07.373 - 00:28:15.445, Speaker A: Well, I think that's all the time that we have for this panel today. So three of you, thanks for your participation in taking these questions and let's give them a big hand as we move to our next panel.
