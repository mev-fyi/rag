00:00:04.800 - 00:00:27.473, Speaker A: All right, guys, we are just going to riff. We're just going to pretend like me and Tarun are having a conversation. No one's around, or we're at like a private bar or something like that. So, you know, hope you guys enjoy. But my name is Paul Vraditaket. I'm a managing partner at Pantera Capital. Pantera Capital is an early investor in crypto.
00:00:27.473 - 00:00:49.125, Speaker A: We manage about 5 billion of assets right now. We do liquids, we do equities, and we are excited about Thailand. I would say that one fun fact is actually, so I am Thai and I'm bad. I'm glad to be back in my home country. So, again, Kapoor, thank you for letting us speak.
00:00:49.905 - 00:01:05.655, Speaker B: Hey, I'm Tarun, partner at Robot Ventures and also founder of Gauntlet. We do a lot of early stage, highly technical investments and excited to. A lot of the companies we invest in are here. So thanks for hosting.
00:01:06.035 - 00:01:35.367, Speaker A: I mean, I think the cool thing about this interaction right now is obviously I've been investing in this space for like 11 years. You've been both an investor and an operator. And Gauntlet does a ton of data stuff. So this is obviously relevant to both sides of the coin. And we're supposed to be talking about AI and crypto and daos. I mean, I know. How do you think about the intersection of AI and investing? I mean, any sort of thoughts on, like, how that sort of, like, will work together?
00:01:35.471 - 00:02:02.399, Speaker B: Yeah, I think one thing that seems to just be fundamentally true about the current state of this kind of agents and chatbot stuff is most of it is fake, but it's all performance art. And there's this life imitating art aspect to it where, like, people do something that's like, hey, the bot is not really trading. People are just airdropping it. Or, you know, maybe it's not really making a valid blockchain transaction, but people are making it on its behalf.
00:02:02.487 - 00:02:02.911, Speaker A: Okay.
00:02:02.983 - 00:02:08.415, Speaker B: And I feel like that is inspiring people to actually make the thing do what it says. Right. So there's.
00:02:08.455 - 00:02:08.767, Speaker A: Got it.
00:02:08.791 - 00:02:24.735, Speaker B: Got it. I feel like it's starting as art and then turning into reality, which is like, kind of different than the rest of crypto. Yeah, it's like very brutally like, you know, the financialization means that you need to know what you're doing up front versus the other way around.
00:02:24.855 - 00:03:18.107, Speaker A: I think that's about right. I mean, look, I mean, the way that we thought about AI and we made a couple of bets in artificial intelligence Sentient, which is kind of, again, going for the sort of like model Training and decentralizing that portion, Sahara, which is around the data side of things, good data, better models, transparency, et cetera. And you know, at the end of the day, I mean, I think there's a hope of, you know, AI agents and what it could sort of do around decision making and investing, venture capital, etc. But there's a bunch of potential in a few different areas. But at the end of the day, I mean, we're just not there yet. But I mean, it's going to drive people to figure out these solutions and I think that's probably where we're at right now, where, you know, people are going to go out there, they're going to build, they're going to raise capital and we'll start seeing what actually happens with this intersection of AI and investing. I'm not quite sure yet.
00:03:18.107 - 00:04:19.379, Speaker A: I mean, I think there's a lot of different ways you can go. I mean, I thought about it myself in terms of like, I mean, I don't know, I think it's actually interesting. So we invest into both like equities and tokens and logically I think about like the use of data and AI around our liquid token investing just because like, when I look at what our liquid PM does, Cosmo, like, he's a fundamental investor and so we do whatever we can to ingest as much data as possible to make decisions. And he's probably more data oriented than I am because I focus on ventures. So I look at the early stage stuff and a lot of qualitative things. And so, you know, what if we can, you know, supplement what he's doing and maybe eventually, like, it becomes even more automated by, you know, using models. You know, actually the Pantera liquid token fund started off as a quantum want fund before we decided, hey, I mean, I think it's probably a little too early for the space to be just driven on fundamentals as, you know, I mean, with Meme coins and everything like that, it's hard to sort of like underwrite that.
00:04:19.379 - 00:04:32.763, Speaker A: So we went back to discretionary investing. But as this space gets a lot more data driven on chain data, you know, I think, I think that could be a pretty interesting part where Pantera, you know, sort of intersects with that.
00:04:32.939 - 00:04:55.313, Speaker B: Yeah. So one thing I think that people have obviously been kind of like interested in this idea of like, hey, there's this agent that's like managing my Meme Coin portfolio or whatever. Right. Like, I think the interesting thing. And so this is a quote from sort of Ilya from Near, which is like that's basically just a normal hedge fund. Right. Like a hedge fund with a normal automated strategy that's trading on chain on your behalf.
00:04:55.313 - 00:05:26.987, Speaker B: Yeah, that's not that different. But the interesting thing is that, you know, if say like one of these things was, you know, controlled by a dao, there's sort of this natural thing that I think is still missing. And this is sort of the big opportunity. And I think, for instance, that people like promote that sentient are thinking about this is actually making sure that there's some notion of privacy for this. So you know, when I think about private investment, venture investments, a lot of it is actually about private data. Right. It's about data you get that's not totally public.
00:05:26.987 - 00:05:40.931, Speaker B: Maybe it's coming from, you know, external sources, maybe it's coming from diligence, maybe it's coming from comps to other companies, stuff like that. And that private data is then sort of converted into something that's mixed with public data and then you make investment decisions.
00:05:40.963 - 00:05:41.579, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:05:41.707 - 00:05:51.779, Speaker B: And somehow we, we. I think in order for these things to be managing a lot of your finances, you can't kind of only have the strictly public smart contract. Right?
00:05:51.827 - 00:05:52.123, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:05:52.179 - 00:06:18.263, Speaker B: Like if it's telling everyone what its strategy is, it's just going to get front run all the time. Yeah. And so I think kind of the next phase of this evolution is actually daos being able to have some privacy. Whether it's conveyances via enclaves, whether it's FHE or zk, there's a lot of different ways it could show up. But I kind of think like we're still at the stage where these public investing vehicles, like, I don't know, like the AI 16Zs.
00:06:18.359 - 00:06:19.055, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly.
00:06:19.135 - 00:06:28.655, Speaker B: They're all just like getting front run. Right. Like if you look at Solana mev, it's very correlated to the usage of these things. And that's not a coincidence. That's because they're completely gangfront.
00:06:28.735 - 00:07:28.867, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I agree with that. I mean look, even with liquid fundamental investing, at the end of the day folks are still having conversations with teams. They still want to understand the qualitative part, the vision part, understanding customers, things like that. So I do think that if we are able to mix in like you mentioned public and private data, it becomes really interesting and especially if you can sort of have like a private way to sort of contribute some of this data. For instance, like I was talking to a portfolio company that was thinking of trying to create sort of like a more open repository of payment data that's happening on chain, but being able to sort of mix what's on chain with also like things that are off chain and then be able to then like have, you know, daos, be able to tap into this sort of like anonymized data set and make decisions off of that. So, you know, that, you know, allows these models to be a bit smarter. You know, we think about same similar things where we just kind of do it internally too.
00:07:28.867 - 00:07:49.095, Speaker A: We mix kind of like actually for us, like, you know, we've looked at like, you know, data across different sectors in crypto for making investments. So if we could actually pair, you know, our private data with on chain data than, you know, be able to actually like at least internally use models that make a lot of sense.
00:07:49.635 - 00:08:16.527, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean actually when you think about investing in AI projects right now, how far would you say, you know, if I put the pure crypto, purely financial and the pure AI like infrastructure, where would you say you are on the spectrum of like things you're, you're investing in? Are they more on the crypto side, like monetizable? Are they more on the AI side? Like better model performance? Are they in the middle? Like where do you kind of put your current strategy?
00:08:16.631 - 00:08:47.245, Speaker A: Yeah, I would put our current strategy as more around the infrastructure side of things. Again, trying to sort of better data, better models. I think we haven't done anything on sort of the agents that are sort of a consumer facing or anything around the payment side of things yet. I think we just want to sort of go a bit lower and sort of understand kind of where traction is going to take off and then be able to then like further sort of invest into like other sort of like infrastructure that's a little bit closer to the, the end user.
00:08:47.705 - 00:09:41.163, Speaker B: Yeah, I would say from my standpoint I've actually started finally starting to think that the application side is finally getting a lot more interesting. Like yeah, I look at a lot of the telegram bots that people have for trading and I think a lot of them are actually taking much more advantage of language models than most of the on chain agents that are, that people will that have a lot of hype. And I actually think the wallet interfaces are changing a lot. Like people are really talking to their wallet rather than like exactly checking on their ledger whether they signed for the right address and then blind signing and losing their money. So like actually the security properties from interpretable blockchain transactions have actually been where I think the biggest consumer surplus is going to come in the next year. Like, I think in general Investors always, you know, go through phases of whether they invest a lot in wallets and front ends to not doing it. Yeah.
00:09:41.163 - 00:10:10.353, Speaker B: But right now it actually feels like a great time to invest in front ends and wallets because there's just this phase transition from I had to open a wallet after read the addresses I have to sign everything to like a very high level description of a sequence of transactions without me having to know exactly what every single one is doing. And I feel like that abstraction is, changes the user modality. Like users will make blockchain transactions not only without thinking about them, but across 20 different chains without realizing.
00:10:10.409 - 00:11:01.007, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree with that. I mean, you know, if I talk to a lot of my friends that are early users in crypto, I mean the interface around trading right now is, I mean you have some of your, you know, your pro guys that will use, you know, sort of like, you know, limit order books and all that kind of stuff. But I think for the most part to kind of get a much larger user base in there and sort of create a much larger sort of demographic for the prosumer. It's going to be sort of conversational. I mean, you know, a lot of folks right now as they is sort of when they trade like they like to be able to almost have like a private wealth manager to be able to sort of like help them execute on things. Right. Like, you know, if you guys trade with Amber, there's like, you know, the, I think a lot of folks just like being in the chats themselves and being able to sort of get advice along the way, be able to sort of like get a little bit more like customization in terms of what you're doing, at least feel special.
00:11:01.007 - 00:11:27.573, Speaker A: Right. And so I think being able to have, you know, some of these like tools and of course like being able to sort of do so in a seamless way where you know, you have WeChat, you have, you know, ton Telegram and all these other places that have an embedded wallet where you can then actually just start executing and making it, you know, very sort of seamless, where you don't have to worry about like, you know, moving across blockchains, all that kind of stuff, everything's just kind of done for you. You can have conversations and whatnot.
00:11:27.669 - 00:12:05.415, Speaker B: So since we're talking about the future of VC being AI, maybe I'll ask you a more hard hitting question, which is of all the different parts of finance, let's say private equity, vc, liquid trading. Yeah. Who, who do you think is the first to get replaced by A dao, like if say, like which entity would be, is like the most likely to get replaced by DAO in the next, say 10 years. Because if I think through all the different types of public, private and sort of in the middle investments, you can see arguments for both sides, right? Of course. But what's your gut feeling?
00:12:05.575 - 00:13:22.385, Speaker A: I mean, my take is probably like, look, I mean, I'm biased. I focus on the earliest of stages and I feel like there's just a lot more qualitative stuff that kind of goes into that. But even in my line of work, I mean, we're trying to use a lot more sort of data, you know, everything from like, how do you sort of quantify like quality of teams to looking at like one thing that I actually was riffing with Sequoia about was like, how do you sort of like, know what's a good team for a certain type of investment? I mean, sure, maybe it's like, oh, I just invest into all the founders that went to Harvard or MIT or whatever, but like, there's certain profiles that make sense for certain types of use cases, at least in their view. So again, like just trying to figure out like, what, what has translated to success. Be able to sort of quantify some of that and then layer it on with like, you know, some of the things that you normally sort of look at customer, you know, all that kind of stuff I think, I think becomes interesting. But I do think that, you know, public investing, you know, and I think that's probably has like a little bit more of a, like a, you know, highly likelihood to be able to sort of get disrupted by models just because, like, there's just, I think a lot of that is more, potentially more data driven than qualitative. And a lot of these companies are a lot more mature too.
00:13:22.385 - 00:13:28.109, Speaker A: There's actually things going on versus like, you know, not even having a product, not even having, you know, any sort of traction.
00:13:28.197 - 00:14:34.003, Speaker B: Yeah, I'll make my claim that I think private equity is actually the first to get replaced for the following reasons. One is, it's a field where there's a lot of taking huge corpora of documents and then distilling them down to like, oh, what's the real debt ratio here? What is actually like the roadmap? And there's a lot of like text to Excel conversion that's done by legions of financial analysts that once you're in Numberland, it's very easy to finish. But the text conversion piece has always been like, throw bodies at the problem instead of throwing cpu's at the problem. But now it really feels like that's flipping. And I generally think the private equity industry has probably the best capital cost structure for getting rid of most of the analysts and having basically gps who just give themes. And then most of it boils down to like getting documents, you know, getting industry documents, getting bond offerings, getting like whatever. And you should be able to actually get a kind of a faster, cheaper version.
00:14:34.003 - 00:15:07.817, Speaker B: And I bet you we're going to see the first fund that's pitched like this, that is a one person fund that raises a billion dollars for doing a buyout vehicle and hires zero other people. And yeah, I'm much more willing to believe P is like first to go vc. I agree. There's a lot more like unfortunately like animal spirit assessment. Right. It's like, it's like you really are, you really are like, you know, for better or worse, like trying to assess like how much a founder is like willing to, willing to continue when like everything blows up or they have to take a big risk. Right.
00:15:07.817 - 00:15:28.347, Speaker B: Which is like not something you can really assess from their written record. But in pe it's like you're really trying to assess like, will this company default on me? And that is a much easier thing, I think fundamentally to go from like documents to numbers. Now I apologize for all the people working in PE or asset management because I kind of, I see, I see, I see one person.
00:15:28.411 - 00:15:54.007, Speaker A: Well, in the spectrum of venture capital, early stage versus late stage private equity. I mean, totally. I mean, I think again, like in private equity and growth, growth equity, I mean, you're using so much data to be able to sort of like figure out like what's going to, what's going to work and what's not going to work. And there's like, it's a lot more quantifiable. But what about, I guess, AI hedge funds and stuff like that for public equities? I mean that's already, I feel like that's existed forever.
00:15:54.071 - 00:16:04.735, Speaker B: Right? Yeah, that's sort of why I think I find sometimes the, oh look, I have this AI thing that's trading for me that's just like wealth front with a slightly different.
00:16:04.895 - 00:16:05.503, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:16:05.599 - 00:16:34.459, Speaker B: But I do think the private data aggregation piece is actually kind of interesting. Like if you could get a bunch of users to aggregate their private data and then the AI trades on the collective's behalf, which is, you know, that would be a lot more useful because it's a way for people to be like, I want these types of returns from this industry. I only know A little bit about the information of this industry, but there's 10 other people and we all know a little bit. And if we pulled our information together, we get better yield, but we also want to reveal to each other like.
00:16:34.507 - 00:16:35.315, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, exactly.
00:16:35.355 - 00:16:41.371, Speaker B: Right. Like I feel like that is the type of thing that is like the highest EV for like. Yeah, autonomous.
00:16:41.523 - 00:17:01.555, Speaker A: Yeah, that's what we're talking about. Just like again, like different sources of data to be, to have it be anonymized and be able to sort of like be accessed and maybe again like that's the cool thing about like tokens, right? Being able to sort of incentivize folks, have them be part of the journey. Consumer versus enterprise data. Do you. They're both valuable, right? I mean, do you see one being more valuable than another?
00:17:02.335 - 00:17:43.435, Speaker B: Yeah, I think one kind of interesting thing is like enterprise data generally has like a lifetime for its value. Like it doesn't after a certain amount of time beyond some event, it's like, oh, it's old and it doesn't reflect the current price. Whereas consumer data says something about a persistent trend like oh, like this particular set of podcasts or content is like suddenly being consumed more and it's compounding on itself. So I kind of think there's kind of this bifurcation where you have data that's very time dependent. Like it's only valuable for a certain amount of time for monetization and data that's persistent and like you, you can continue to monetize forever. Social networks of course are sort of bridging the gap. Right.
00:17:43.435 - 00:18:05.343, Speaker B: Some social network data is instantly monetizable, some is monetizable over the lifetime of the user. And I kind of think the crypto version of this is evolving and maybe there'll be some persistent data that people actually really care about. Obviously right now it's like everyone has the attention span of a lemming. But like, you know, interesting.
00:18:05.439 - 00:18:12.675, Speaker A: What about, what about Gauntlet right now? How do you sort of see the intersection of Gauntlet and maybe how it sort of contributes to.
00:18:13.055 - 00:18:41.801, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean I think one interesting thing about risk stuff is. Yeah, a lot of AI is really focused on average case behavior. Like on average this type of thing would happen and like it's fine, you know, you're fine making an error 1% of the time to get optimal answer. 99% of time. The problem is sometimes in risk. So especially with things like MEV and also like delays you can't understand on chain, you end up that 1% is where you lose all your money. Right.
00:18:41.801 - 00:18:50.129, Speaker B: It's like the 1% is the hack effectively. Right. And so I think we're still a little farther from having enough safeguards on chain for that.
00:18:50.177 - 00:18:50.425, Speaker A: Okay.
00:18:50.465 - 00:19:23.921, Speaker B: It's not that we won't. I think the privacy technologies are actually key to making that much more efficient. I actually think using TES and using ZK within protocols is actually going to be able to set up ring fences so that it's much more safe to have AI models. And we've been thinking a lot about that, especially from the sense of like how do you use CO processors to do that? Because at least the CO processors give you some off chain privacy. I think we're going to see a lot more of that type of stuff. I think TE's are making a comeback. They were a 2017 meme.
00:19:23.921 - 00:19:41.469, Speaker B: We had Oasis and stuff like that and, and none of those really took off. And then I think now we're seeing the TEs come back. I think a lot of the companies probably on this board are working on that and using those. So I think the privacy preserving technologies are going to be the key to kind of getting things to be safer.
00:19:41.557 - 00:19:44.861, Speaker A: I haven't dug it as much into it. I was kind of curious. I mean, have you looked into fhe?
00:19:45.013 - 00:20:06.091, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. I think like FHE is like, you know, FHE is actually the thing that sort of got me into being interested in crypto. Like when Craig Gentry's PhD thesis came out, that was when I was like, oh wow, like it's actually worth reading cryptography papers. But there's sort of this thing where it's like, it does feel like it's like 10 years away to get to.
00:20:06.123 - 00:20:07.315, Speaker A: Yeah, that's what I mean, that's what my team.
00:20:07.355 - 00:20:26.493, Speaker B: But it's the holy grail. Right. So like if you can build out this whole ecosystem with things using tes and then you later hot swap it for fhe, then you basically got the best of both worlds. And I think there is obviously this like supply chain issue. Intel always screws things up. Like there have been a million hacks, whatever. Yeah.
00:20:26.493 - 00:21:23.857, Speaker B: But I think we're getting to the world where everyone and their mom is making a tea. And so I'll give you an example of this that's really important, which is Nvidia actually in Most of the A2 hundreds and A2 hundreds has added a bunch of new TE support. And a lot of the reason for this is that the largest customers so OpenAI, Anthropic, et cetera, have sort of demanded that Some of their inference is done privately. Why? Because there have been like lots of attacks of people stealing their weights, kind of getting, you know, like, you know these companies are spending billions of dollars to get these kind of their private data and these weights and they've been getting hacked and people are like kind of stealing their models and whatever. Right. So there's been this kind of move to actually having hardware based privacy for inference in AI. And I think that is something that crypto will be taking advantage of because there's going to be a lot more abundant tes that are not just one manufacturer.
00:21:23.857 - 00:21:24.361, Speaker B: Got it.
00:21:24.393 - 00:21:36.481, Speaker A: Okay, that makes sense. I guess another question I was kind of curious about was like so we've done a couple of AI investments. Like I mentioned Sahara and Sentient Robot Ventures. I mean how active have you guys been on AI?
00:21:36.593 - 00:22:10.821, Speaker B: Yeah, so we, we, I would say we accidentally made our first. So some sort of pivot probably investment in 2022. Okay. Which is an awesome company called together. They actually sort of started in crypto and then kind of went back to AI. But since then we've invested in a lot of people who are working on training kind of edge models. So like Sentient, like you mentioned as well as people who are trying to do distributed training like Noose research and then people who are doing distributed inference and edge inference like exo.
00:22:10.821 - 00:22:17.613, Speaker B: So that's sort of, those are sort of been like we've been more, I would say on the infrastructure non financialization side.
00:22:17.669 - 00:22:17.909, Speaker A: Yes.
00:22:17.957 - 00:23:16.327, Speaker B: But I'm starting to see teams that are really interesting where they're realistically their product is a wallet, but they're actually a much more technical team that is actually trying to build a lot more of the on chain automated management stuff. So you know, earlier I was sort of saying okay, yeah, these agents trading for you is just wealth run for you, who cares. But the thing is I actually think there's a sense in which wallets and something like automated investment management are slowly converging. And I actually think the value capture for wallets and the moat that they'll be able to take the higher the fee they'll be able to actually take on. These swap fees and transaction fees are going to come from having better sort of private wealth management like features where it's like a person gives you a high level objective of like hey, I want exposure to equities, I don't want to be too overweight bonds, I want a ton of meme coins. But I also don't want to buy meme coins that are racist like Find me the exact. Right, like, there's.
00:23:16.327 - 00:23:35.733, Speaker B: There's going to be this kind of hybrid thing. And I think the wallets you see today are likely the Palm Pilots. I think the wallets of the future will not look at all like what you. You think of as current crypto wallet. I think those are like the dinosaurs and starting to see the things that are really taking advantage of AI to make those new interfaces. That's what I think is exciting.
00:23:35.789 - 00:23:51.869, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, it'll be interesting. I mean, we're definitely hoping to sort of see a lot more innovation there, whether it comes from sort of new companies or existing wallets that just really can, you know, integrate more AI and figure out, like a better sort of user experience, whether it's like a metamask or something like that.
00:23:51.997 - 00:24:03.415, Speaker B: So since we have 29 seconds, I'm going to ask you the. Not financial advice, but what financial. But sort of financial advice, which is what is your favorite meme coin?
00:24:03.835 - 00:24:13.855, Speaker A: What is my favorite meme coin? Look, I mean, you know, Pantera would probably say. I can't say a specific token, but.
00:24:14.515 - 00:24:18.235, Speaker B: What class of meme, like, what themes do you like, exactly?
00:24:18.275 - 00:24:33.615, Speaker A: Look, I mean, I think. I think the meme coins that, you know, outside of just like, I think. I think when they rally a community around sort of a certain cause or a certain sort of a mission, vision, objective, are the ones that I'm super interested in.
00:24:33.915 - 00:24:50.339, Speaker B: Yeah, for me, it's definitely the goat for sure, because I think, like I said, goat itself was kind of a scam. Right. It didn't do what it said, but then it inspired people to make things that did what it said. And that's the beauty of open. You can do open stuff in crypto that you can't do elsewhere.
00:24:50.467 - 00:24:54.595, Speaker A: Exactly. Awesome. That was a lot of fun. Thank you. Thank you so much. Tune.
