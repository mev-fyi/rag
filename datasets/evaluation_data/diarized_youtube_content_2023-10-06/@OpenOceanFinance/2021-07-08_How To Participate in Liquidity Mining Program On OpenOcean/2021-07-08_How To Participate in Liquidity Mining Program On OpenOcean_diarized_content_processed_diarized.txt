00:00:00.160 - 00:00:14.710, Speaker A: So this video where we will show you how to provide liquidity and how to use the farms in Openocean once the token goes live. So Openocean is a full aggregation protocol that sources liquidity from DeFi and CEFi.
00:00:14.822 - 00:00:18.126, Speaker B: And lets you trade on the best price with lowest leverage.
00:00:18.310 - 00:00:21.086, Speaker A: We support Ethereum, binance, smart chain, ontology.
00:00:21.190 - 00:00:26.274, Speaker B: Tron and Solana, and the major decentralized and centralized exchanges on that.
00:00:26.694 - 00:00:32.846, Speaker A: So this video is where we demonstrate our test environment to right liquidity and.
00:00:32.870 - 00:00:34.110, Speaker B: How to use the farms.
00:00:34.222 - 00:00:36.474, Speaker A: So it's going to look slightly different.
00:00:36.774 - 00:00:38.686, Speaker B: In the real life once the token.
00:00:38.790 - 00:01:24.166, Speaker A: And Dex goes live. So let's go into the farms and see how it works. Okay, so this is how Openocean farms will look like. In this case, we use token b and token a, which represent some test tokens just for the demonstration purpose. In the real one, we will have two pools, OOe and Busd and Ooe and BNB. It's all part of our token pre announcement. So when I want to provide liquidity and earn oe, there's basically two steps.
00:01:24.190 - 00:01:27.110, Speaker B: That you need to go through. The first step is that you select.
00:01:27.142 - 00:01:42.682, Speaker A: The pool that you want to provide liquidity to, and then you click the add token BNA in this case, which might be BNP or OOE in another case. And with this, you can go in.
00:01:42.698 - 00:01:45.534, Speaker C: And add the liquidity and receive the LP tokens.
00:01:45.954 - 00:01:57.298, Speaker A: So for example, I can type in how many I want to supply. In this case, it's like test token b and test token a.
00:01:57.426 - 00:01:59.402, Speaker B: And then next I'm gonna unlock the.
00:01:59.418 - 00:02:26.756, Speaker A: Wallet and I'm using metamask. So after I unlock the wallet, I can supply the two token pads and receive LP tokens. I'm gonna go ahead and click supply here. We'll prompt you with the information so you can see the ratio between the tokens you supply and how many LP tokens you will get and the amount of the share of the pool you receive. I'm gonna confirm the supply, then metamesk.
00:02:26.780 - 00:02:28.372, Speaker C: Will prompt me for the transaction.
00:02:28.468 - 00:02:36.380, Speaker A: I'm gonna confirm. So after this, the transaction will take.
00:02:36.412 - 00:02:38.824, Speaker B: Place and I will receive the LP tokens.
00:02:39.724 - 00:03:34.894, Speaker A: Next step is that I go back to the farms and I click on the farm where I provided liquidity and got the LP token, and now I can deposit them. So I'm gonna go ahead and say deposit, and then I'm gonna specify the amount of LP tokens that I want to stake, and I can just hit Max here and then say confirm. Then I'll get prompted in metamask again about the transaction to stake my LP tokens. And now we have submitted LP tokens into the stake, and on the screen here you can see how much you have staked and you can see how many ooe you have earned. So first step is to provide liquidity.
00:03:34.934 - 00:03:36.158, Speaker C: And get the LP tokens.
00:03:36.206 - 00:03:41.646, Speaker A: That basically means that you are qualified to receive the transactions fee from the pool.
00:03:41.790 - 00:03:43.326, Speaker B: Next step is to take your LP.
00:03:43.390 - 00:03:45.174, Speaker C: Tokens and stake them into the pool.
00:03:45.254 - 00:03:46.526, Speaker B: So you can also get part of.
00:03:46.550 - 00:03:49.474, Speaker C: The governance reward that's distributed to the pool.
00:03:50.494 - 00:03:54.974, Speaker A: So again, remember, this is a demonstration of our test environment.
00:03:55.134 - 00:03:56.806, Speaker B: Once we issue the token, there will.
00:03:56.830 - 00:03:59.310, Speaker A: Come a lot of information about how to do it.
00:03:59.382 - 00:04:01.190, Speaker B: But this is the general mechanics that.
00:04:01.222 - 00:04:09.134, Speaker A: You can use to provide liquidity and stakeholder.
