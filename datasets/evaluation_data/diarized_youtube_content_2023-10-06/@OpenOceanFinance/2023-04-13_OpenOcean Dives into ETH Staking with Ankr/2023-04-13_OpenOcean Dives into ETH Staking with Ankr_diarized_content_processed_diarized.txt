00:00:00.280 - 00:01:00.754, Speaker A: 500. Hello everybody, my name is Guy, I'm from Openocean and you're watching the second video that we're doing about the upcoming Openocean liquid Ethereum staking dashboard. On the new dashboard we're releasing, you'll be able to compare offerings from all the major players in the liquid Ethereum staking market, as well as see all the different pools available, the specific rewards for each of those pools broken down by token type. And you'll also be able to see the open ocean edge, which is the specific edge you get from buying liquid staking tokens directly on open ocean as opposed to buying on the open market. And who knows, you might even get more rewards for it in the long run. In the upcoming interviews, we'll be talking with individuals from many of the major staking platforms. And today I'm absolutely thrilled to be welcoming Thiago from anchor, thank you very much for joining me again.
00:01:00.754 - 00:01:24.754, Speaker A: And today we're here to speak to Tiago from anchor. Openocean is building a brand new Ethereum staking dashboard, and as one of the providers for the liquid Ethereum tokens, we've brought Tiago on just to find out a little bit more about anchor, a little bit more about how their liquid staking works, and a little bit about how we can tie it into the open ocean platform. Thiago, how you doing?
00:01:26.014 - 00:01:28.794, Speaker B: Hey guys. Everybody. I'm good. What about yourself?
00:01:30.014 - 00:01:56.864, Speaker A: Awesome, man. It's awesome. It's a really fun time to be in crypto with the Shanghai upgrade just around the corner, you know, we're all waiting with bated breath for the 12 April. I think it's going to be absolutely incredible. There's going to be so much more eth in the market. So it's all of these overviews of the different platforms and the tokens that are available through open ocean. It's going to be great to get to know Anker and to get to know where your guys placement in the market is.
00:01:56.864 - 00:02:02.624, Speaker A: So if you could just tell me a little bit more about what you do for anchor, that would be great. Just to start us off.
00:02:04.324 - 00:02:22.064, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. So I'm the defi business dev, so off liquor staking. Anker has two main sectors, right? We are also infrastructure, SDKs, RPC nodes as a core, but we also have liquid staking where I'm the business. Yeah, business developer.
00:02:23.204 - 00:02:48.544, Speaker A: Awesome, man. And if you had to sort of. Cause obviously when we're looking at the open ocean dashboard, the whole entire idea is to get a feel of all the different liquid staking options, right? So let's say I'm going onto it and I'm looking at all the different options presented and I see anchor. Right. So could you give me a little bit of an overview of anchor and how you would say you guys differentiate yourself from the other players in the market?
00:02:50.244 - 00:03:46.478, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. So first of all, and this is a really cool curiosity, which is Anker actually launched liquid staking two weeks before Lido. But you know, stuff happens basically because. Yeah, and basically this is because first of all, it's like a philosophy, also necessity, because in the end of the day, the core and bread and butter I was explaining to you of anchors is actually RPC nodes. And to consume those RPC nodes, you will need anchor token, right? So we can just use anchor tokens as rewards to incentivize these more Degen pools like our competitors can because they have their own token just dedicated for this. That's why I think why we lose a little bit there. But you know, at the core, I think anchor not only serves Ethereum, it serves like a lot of a big variety of liquid staking chains.
00:03:46.478 - 00:04:25.670, Speaker B: We have Ethereum, BNB, where we actually are leaders. So on BNB we are leaders. We have like 80% of the market share there. Then we have matic, Phantom, Avalanche, Polkadot and Kusama. And I think basically our main differences, I would say, is that we have our own bridge and we are pushing for this like omni chain liquid staking, where you could for instance, stake Ethereum on BNB chain, which for new users and newcomers could become particularly more interesting. As you know, the fees on BNB chain are way cheaper than on Ethereum. So this is one of the advantages of having anchor eth that no other protocol has at the moment.
00:04:25.670 - 00:04:54.254, Speaker B: And secondly, we also have interesting features like Flash and stake, where basically users can instantaneously redeem their tokens without the needing of waiting for the bonding period. So of course this is not the case for Ethereum, right? Ethereum is not redeemable yet, but when it becomes redeemable, it's definitely on our plans. But really the core idea are this so anchor as omnichannel liquid staking solution and it's the most liquid liquid staking.
00:04:54.834 - 00:05:25.234, Speaker A: Oh, that's fantastic. I say, I know you guys have loads of liquid staking products from BNB to avalanche, and it's fantastic to see you guys actually release so many because a lot of other providers, they just stick to Ethereum. So it's great that you kind of capturing that market share no matter where people want to defi or where people want to crypto. So let's say I'm just looking at Ethereum only if I had to ask you to give me just a few benefits when compared to the competitors where anchor stands out above everybody else.
00:05:27.694 - 00:06:06.154, Speaker B: So first, again, omnichannel experience. So you could actually stick your anchor ETH on BNB, for instance, but it's still anchored. Secondly, I think we are also going through a shift on our node operation where we want to really build this decentralized network of node operations that I don't believe any of the other our competitors have. So basically, we are going to decentralize our node operation using DVT technology as well. So using nodes from oval and ssv, for instance. So yeah.
00:06:08.894 - 00:06:58.194, Speaker A: As I say, it's good that you guys actually have a really big focus on decentralization because I think with a lot of other providers that is something that they're also taking into consideration. How can they provide and sort of support decentralized ethereum staking? Okay, so with the open ocean dashboard, you're going to be able to buy liquid staking tokens from all the major providers, right? So you're going to be able to go on there and buy your anchor eth. You're also going to be able to see all the available pools for staking, right? So how effective would you say are third party dashboards? Not necessarily, not just, just necessarily covering ours, but how effective would you say that providers of third party supplementary apps are to the growth and the future of anchor?
00:07:00.614 - 00:07:54.122, Speaker B: I'd say it's quite substantial. Right. In the end of the day, the more channels that can help us spread the message of our liquid staking, it further helps disseminate this new technology. That's quite interesting because it really promotes capital efficiency as basically you can stake your eth, but you can still use it and try to farm it on other additional defi opportunities. And this is quite substantial, especially now with the Shanghai updates. Basically, there's also the tendency for certain players to accumulate a lot of ethereum on their nodes, and this might result in centralization issues. So it's really important for everybody to understand what options do they have in the market? What can they stake? Like where can they stake which pools can attract extra yield, which tokens are trading at a discount, for instance, which is also like a good opportunity.
00:07:54.122 - 00:08:08.264, Speaker B: And I believe definitely that Openocean and this dashboard can help us out, spread that message and have like for the user, have like a clear view of every major protocol and yeah, just allow them to choose what they want to do.
00:08:09.004 - 00:08:52.574, Speaker A: Ah, awesome. I mean, the whole entire idea behind what we're sort of pitching is the open ocean edge, which is sourcing your liquid staking tokens from open ocean and actually earning a little bit of a better rate than necessarily getting them providers, getting them from the providers, or getting them from the open market. So we include a full breakdown. So you can see not only the main pools, but but also the boosted pools as well. So now we've touched on decentralization, but how can you ensure that people who are holding anchoreth, how can we be sure that there's security in mind? And what are your view on security and what steps do you guys take to protect users?
00:08:54.314 - 00:09:30.684, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. Security is a very thing, a very important thing for us. And I think for every protocol, right in the end of the day, this is a new tech that requires and have really specific requirements. And the truth is that sooner or later most of the protocols get hacked. So at anchor security is a big priority for us. And all the smart contracts are audited by several different firms that you can have a double look and a double check on our documentation, including our bridges, our staking contracts, our staking tokens. So everything is audited.
00:09:30.684 - 00:10:23.516, Speaker B: And the secondly is this is a big thing that we plan for what we call like ETH V three, where basically what we're going to do is fully decentralized our node operation. And with this, basically we will include, as I mentioned before, DVT technology, which also helps users prevent from slashing. So you know, this will add like an extra layer not only of, in terms of security as you, you know, slashing insurance as. Yeah, like you will basically be decentralizing this entire operation. So maybe I can dive a little bit of how this will work. But basically, first of all, we're going to have like a node marketplace where users can choose which nodes they can delegate their ETH. And then secondly, based on of course certain requirements and thresholds.
00:10:23.516 - 00:10:57.870, Speaker B: And this is a little bit of alpha I'm sharing here. Basically, you know, it will be the community that will decide and vote on which nodes can be part of the validating procedures of anchor eth. So basically it will be the community to decide which nodes are secure or not and validate the transactions of the anchor ETH that they hold, which I think is quite powerful. Again, especially if you consider that you can also include DVT technology in here. Yeah, I believe this will be quite powerful and a very meaningful solution. Only in terms of security as decentralization as of course, as well, community engagement. Right.
00:10:57.870 - 00:11:01.994, Speaker B: Because in the end of the day, it's the users that are choosing and building their own products.
00:11:02.574 - 00:11:45.124, Speaker A: Yeah, that's fantastic. It's really refreshing to hear that the users in the crypto community are in the forefront of your mind when you're thinking about updates and stuff to the platform and where you go. That's really, really great. As I say, a community first focus, it always tends to win. So okay, we've touched a little bit about yourself, a little bit about the anchor platform. Could you tell us the fundamentals of how liquid staking with the anchor token works? So not your own token, but how the anchor eth token works, how rewards are accumulated? If you could just give us a brief overview of that.
00:11:45.904 - 00:12:23.480, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. So basically how it functions is users can take their ETH, they can stake on, you know, anchor ETH or open ocean because that will seems to become an option here. So that's quite interesting as well. But basically how it opens is anchor currently has like a node operation. And basically what we do is we take your ethereum and we deposit on our nodes. However, you know, until the Shanghai update happens, this ethereum will be locked. So really what anchor does here is they issue like a receipt token that basically represents your staked ETH.
00:12:23.480 - 00:13:03.712, Speaker B: And basically when we talk about liquid staking and liquid staking tokens, in fact, what we are talking about is the opportunity to trade these receipts that represent your stake if, and this is quite meaningful, especially because it has another layer of rewards that you can get and also adds a little bit of capital efficiency. Right. Because now you could sell your unstake eth and yeah, it just becomes more liquid and more efficient to users of your, of your capital because you don't have your Eth log for, you know, we don't know how, when. Right now we know, but like we know how much time this took to get pushed.
00:13:03.768 - 00:13:06.124, Speaker A: Those were very brave people back in the days.
00:13:06.624 - 00:13:16.194, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. So, so yeah, I mean basically it helps promote capital efficiency and in the background, this is basically what's happening.
00:13:16.734 - 00:13:52.282, Speaker A: Yeah, that's awesome. And it's really good to see all the different kinds of models of liquid ethereum staking. And I've definitely got to say that I'm a big fan of you guys from liquid staking on BNB. So you probably would be one of my first choices if I was considering doing that. But yeah, one of the fantastic options about jumping into our pools with, with Anchoreth is that you get to see a breakdown of all the different rewards as well. So you can go on it and you can see, oh, I'm going to get paid out in crv tokens or I'm going to get paid out in these tokens. So it's kind of refreshing.
00:13:52.282 - 00:14:16.654, Speaker A: But I mean also we have open ocean was built on a traditional swap, on a traditional swap foundation. So we've got more liquidity sources running on more chains than anybody else. So by that extension we support the native anchor token. So could you just fill me in a little bit about the native anchor token and how it fits in with your staking solutions and is there any utility for the users?
00:14:18.234 - 00:14:58.036, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. So again, liquid staking is just like a branch out of anchor. In the end of the day, the bread and butter of anchor is RPC nodes. And basically in order to consume these RPC nodes, you need to pay in anchor tokens. This is like the main use case of the anchor token in terms of staking currently. You could also stake anchor basically. So you could lock your anchor in exchange for, you know, a yield and yeah, maybe like in the future, and I'm just saying maybe, maybe the token will have like governance rights that it will allow you to vote on certain and specific things.
00:14:58.036 - 00:15:00.784, Speaker B: And I think everybody can connect the dots now.
00:15:03.564 - 00:15:24.784, Speaker A: Okay, well I mean like looking forward. So how do you obviously the upgrades going live on the 12th? How do you envision the future of the staking market, let's say for 2023 and beyond? And then a second question. Where do you see anchor and how does it fit itself into this evolving landscape?
00:15:25.884 - 00:16:02.750, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. So I think that like the big question at the moment is really trying to understand what's going to happen to Ethereum. Because on one hand this is a major upgrade for Ethereum, but on the other side you could also have a big and huge unlock of Ethereum on the market. This could lead to a price dump, but this could also lead to other protocols. Try to capture this ethereum that was once locked in other protocols. But we also have the other hand which is now staking. It is way less risky because you can just take and unstake your ethereum.
00:16:02.750 - 00:17:06.430, Speaker B: And basically, especially with liquid staking, if maybe you wanted to sell your ethereum, you could also already sold. So this is like the main purpose and the main value proposition of each staking anyway. So what I expect actually, and this is again like speculation is since basically I believe that people that wanted to sell their stake if probably will be using liquid staking, and if they want it to, they were already sold. I would expect that, you know, more ethereum will become to be staked as staking. It just became less riskier after the Shanghai upgrade. So. And how Anker is just really trying to position itself is really this community driven protocol with liquid staking that is truly run by its community and really just trying to capture this market share of the ethereum that will become redeemable and will most likely get unstaked from a protocol.
00:17:06.430 - 00:17:47.686, Speaker B: So really what we're trying to do is really push for that narrative we want with the flush and staking become the most liquid, liquid staking. Even though we might not have a lot of liquidity on the pools and a lot of volume, the trees that's anchored will become an anchor. Ethan, on all of the other chains that we cover will become the most liquid, liquid staking on the market that is run by the community that is decentralized. So, you know, I think this is a good value proposition and yeah, now it's up to the users to decide which solutions they want to do and they want to use, of course. But we believe this is a really, really strong value proposition that we are positioning ourselves to get ready and try to attack that, attract that Ethereum that.
00:17:47.710 - 00:18:16.714, Speaker A: Just goes, yeah, yeah, I like, I like pitching yourself as the absolute most liquid platform, like, no matter where you want to go, that's really cool. It's kind of like, it's kind of like open ocean a little bit. We're like, hey, get the best swap rates no matter what chain you want. So it kind of feels like that. It kind of feels like that same thing. You guys are in it for the community, you're in it for, you know, putting the power back into people's hands. And that's absolutely amazing.
00:18:16.714 - 00:18:59.718, Speaker A: So, yeah, depending on when, in what order this interview is released, it might be released before we release our Ethereum dashboard. It could be released afterwards. We're going to be doing a little bit more events around the actual release date. But the fantastic thing is that anchor is fully integrated into the Openocean Ethereum staking dashboard. That means you can go and buy your tokens, you can see what rate you're going to get, and you can also see all of the pools and the rewards broken down for you. So make sure that when you're picking up some Ethereum tokens to stake, you give anchor your utmost consideration. Thank you so much for coming on here and talking to me today about Anchorman.
00:18:59.718 - 00:19:04.234, Speaker A: It's been absolutely great to get to know you. It's been fantastic to get to know the platform.
00:19:06.774 - 00:19:23.354, Speaker B: Honestly. My pleasure. We are more than happy to cooperate with Openocean. Again, this is not in branding, but I use Openocean almost every day. Right. So it's always a pleasure to talk with the guys that are behind this and do partnerships in order to just boost the entire ecosystem as well.
00:19:23.514 - 00:19:42.046, Speaker A: Yeah. Fantastic, man. And that's that. Again, that's, at the end of the day, that's what we're trying to do. We try and release products for our community. We try and release products for the wider crypto community, but also we're trying to democratize access to it. So bring that barrier of entry down.
00:19:42.046 - 00:20:03.594, Speaker A: Same thing that you guys are doing with the liquid staking, you know, so you don't have to come up with all those assets out of your pocket in order to be able to participate. Awesome, man. It's been, it's been an absolute pleasure speaking to you. Is there any, any wise words you want to leave us or anything that you want to say about anchor or about the crypto markets in general?
00:20:04.394 - 00:20:17.774, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. So just a quick tip is that currently the anchor ETH is trading at a 2% discount. So if you buy now and you stake on the Shanghai update, you'll just get 2% of free Ethereum. Hey, look at that.
00:20:19.394 - 00:20:22.774, Speaker A: Look at that. Coming in with the alpha.
00:20:23.514 - 00:20:24.394, Speaker B: Oh, yeah.
00:20:24.554 - 00:20:30.774, Speaker A: So I'm hoping that by the time actually, people watch this, there's like a mad influx of people going and buying Anchorage.
00:20:31.474 - 00:20:34.714, Speaker B: Probably there won't be any arbitrage opportunity.
00:20:34.754 - 00:20:57.200, Speaker A: There, but, yeah, but, yeah, I mean, if you want to pick up any Ankoreth or you want to pick up any of the Ankhwa liquid staking tokens, all of those are available to purchase on open ocean, and we're not going to charge you any fees for it whatsoever. Right. Fantastic. I think we're going to wrap up there. We got so much information. I think if I take in any more, I might have to go and have a lie down. So thank you.
00:20:57.200 - 00:21:00.884, Speaker A: Thank you very much for coming in and talking to me today, man. It's been an absolute pleasure.
00:21:01.524 - 00:21:02.444, Speaker B: Thank you. My pleasure.
