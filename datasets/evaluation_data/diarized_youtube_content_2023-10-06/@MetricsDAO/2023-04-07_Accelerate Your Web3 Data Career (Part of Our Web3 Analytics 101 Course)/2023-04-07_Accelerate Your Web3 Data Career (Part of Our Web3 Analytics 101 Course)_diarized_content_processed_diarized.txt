00:00:12.080 - 00:00:40.040, Speaker A: There should be a couple more speakers joining us, but I could go ahead with announcements. I'm thinking they'll be here shortly. Maybe one of them was here before. Maybe they're rejoining the space. So I'll just get started with some announcements and just get space going in general. In general. Happy to have everyone here.
00:00:40.040 - 00:01:16.260, Speaker A: It's going to be super exciting. One really proud of the panel we got together today. So pretty stacked, pretty, pretty amazed. So, yeah, first off, I just want to invite everyone to post their questions, if they have any. Obviously, it's a panel. We source a lot of questions, but we also take some questions from the crowd today. So if you got questions, drop them in the comments and we'll get to them on the end as well.
00:01:16.260 - 00:01:59.330, Speaker A: Maybe you don't have a specific question. In that case, it'd be cool if you just let us know what brought you here. Uh, what's your motivation? What are you excited about? What are you hoping to learn today? Um, and, yeah, just, uh, just for us to give a general direction to the, to the space. That would be really, really helpful. Um, so, yeah, a bit about the format today. I'll be doing some short announcements. After that, I'll give it over to Marina, who will be moderating the panel with our guests, and then we'll also take some questions from the chat.
00:01:59.330 - 00:02:36.940, Speaker A: So without further ado, I'll get to the announcements first. So, yeah, if you're here today, you're probably interested in Twitter spaces. We are going to do more of these probably every week, but this week we're even doing two of them. So on Wednesday, we're doing another one. I'm really excited for this one as well. I'll be hosting some great speakers on the future of work. So that means, like, the decentralization of work daos, basically a lot of things that bring us to this space.
00:02:36.940 - 00:03:11.740, Speaker A: I'll be interviewing some white paper writers upon which the metrics app is based on their thinkings. Um, so really interested to dig into deep. Also have some builders. So that means a developer who's building our app and some power users who are heavily using our app. So really, really interested that. I'm going to drop the link in the comments in a bit. What else? Okay, so let's move on to today.
00:03:11.740 - 00:03:40.190, Speaker A: The reason we do this panel, this career panel, is because we have a live course on web3 analytics. A lot of people take it, and at the end of six weeks, you got some people who graduate. That's great stuff. And we want to celebrate that. So this cohort got 15 graduates. I'm going to name them off. It won't be their Twitter handles, unfortunately.
00:03:40.190 - 00:04:01.246, Speaker A: So we're not sure if we can see you in the, in the, in the crowd, in the audience, but we hope you're listening. Just want to give you a cool shout out. Here we go. First graduate is a yo. The great, then light man, glorious leader, Laja. Paul. Paul.
00:04:01.246 - 00:04:21.528, Speaker A: Paul is striving telogy. Thomas Harris, Mason R. The christian decrision or sometimes these names. Nathan Clive, Ludovico Pha. Yeah. Proof of humanity. I see you in the crowd, Ludavi.
00:04:21.528 - 00:04:38.810, Speaker A: Awesome to have you here, man. Congrats. Congratulations. Sylvia Orlando, 107, Dallas. Another familiar face I think I see on the crowd. No, that's too bad. Well, congrats to him.
00:04:38.810 - 00:05:18.474, Speaker A: Sovereign alchemist as well. And then finally, tentacles 2020. So, yeah, really happy for these guys. Give it up, show some applause emojis, and, yeah, congrats, and let's move on to the. To the next step in your web3 data career. Let's say we also are running a jokedao contest so we can decide who made the best dashboards from our student participants. So get your folks in at the joked out contest.
00:05:18.474 - 00:05:21.510, Speaker A: I'll share the link for that in the comments as well.
00:05:23.210 - 00:05:24.030, Speaker B: Yes.
00:05:25.020 - 00:06:06.140, Speaker A: Okay. Talking about moving on in your web3 data career, we also got a product session on Sentio, which is a data provider on Wednesday. So that's a nice webinar, under 60 minutes, short, quick, and easy, just to elevate your game a little bit. So be sharing that shortly. If you think this is cool, you want to learn more, we're going to do more of these live course cohorts. So just jump in our discord, get involved, and you'll be the first to know when our next live cohort registration opens up. So with all that out of the way, people, thank you for being here.
00:06:06.140 - 00:06:32.580, Speaker A: Thank you for listening in. I'm going to give it off to Marina, our lovely lead community. I gotta say, she really forged our discord into the lively community that it is today. And she's also a course instructor of the course I just talked about. She did multiple sessions, this and last cohort, and I believe even the one before that, so she's becoming a bit of a veteran. So without. Without all that.
00:06:32.580 - 00:06:36.660, Speaker A: Yeah. Marina, the floor is yours.
00:06:37.120 - 00:07:01.020, Speaker C: Hello. Hello. Hey, everyone. Super excited to be with all of you here today in this awesome company. Big, big congrats to our graduates who helix just shouted out. I'm so proud of you all for sticking through the course for becoming brand new web3 data analysts as of today. It's so exciting.
00:07:01.020 - 00:08:01.840, Speaker C: Give some claps, give some applause to our awesome grads. And we also really appreciate our awesome speakers who are here today on the panel. I think we're trying to get one or two more people up, but all of you really appreciate having here today to share your wisdom about the next steps in every new analyst's web3 data career. So, so stoked to get this started. So, to kick this off, let's go in with a round of introductions. I'm going to give the mic to each one of you here on the panel today. Anything you'd like to let the crowd know about who you are, what you do, where you can be found in this web3 universe, and also, what are your touch points with blockchain data? Since this is kind of the focus of our panel today, how do you interact with data and data people and anything else you'd like to share? I'm gonna throw it first.
00:08:01.840 - 00:08:08.640, Speaker C: Let's see. Let's throw it first to Jones on chain data. Nerd floor is yours.
00:08:08.940 - 00:08:42.729, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm here. Okay, so, my name is Jones. I am the head of the. The data node. So we specialize in on chain data, but specifically for wallet tracking. So we would like to provide, like, movement for on chain movement between wallet, for example, VC, smart money, that kind of stuff, so that the investor and traders can get a clear insight into the token and what they're getting into. So, that's my job and.
00:08:44.509 - 00:08:52.089, Speaker C: Awesome. So great to have you here. I'm going to go in the order that I see all folks. Give it to Alex.
00:08:55.469 - 00:09:26.870, Speaker B: Hey, guys. Yeah, just some background about me. I used to work as a quant trader at a high frequency trading firm. I left last year to do a DeFi project where I worked on research and I guess quant research at this DeFi protocol. Unfortunately, the protocol closed down this year. So right now I'm building my own sort of research consultancy, trading firm, and I'm mainly doing, like, on chain and also like. Yeah, just trading stuff for that.
00:09:27.770 - 00:09:36.540, Speaker C: So cool. Thanks for the intro. And let's go to Tomas so spoke, who is here with us on stage as well, if you'd like to introduce yourself.
00:09:37.920 - 00:10:29.010, Speaker E: Yeah. Hi, everyone, I'm Thomas. My background is. I did a PhD in computational neuroscience. So nothing to do with blockchain at first, but then I moved on and I used to work as a data scientist for doing analytics. And then I recently, like a few months ago, joined I the robust incentives group at the Ethereum foundation as a researcher and our research is focusing on game theoretical mechanism designs on Ethereum. So that includes MeV proposal builder, separations, roll up economics, gas fees, but all of that from a kind of mathematical economic perspective.
00:10:29.010 - 00:10:42.040, Speaker E: And yeah, I use on chain data a ton, mostly associated with off chain data as well now. But yeah, I use it every day.
00:10:43.900 - 00:11:15.060, Speaker C: So cool. Such a diverse panel of speakers here today. Again, appreciate you all being here. We'll see if more of our speakers are able to join throughout. But it's really awesome to have all of these different views and angles on on chain data, web3 data here today. So with that, let's jump into some questions. We asked our graduating cohort, first of all, if they had any questions for you all as they are starting their new career path and in this new to them field.
00:11:15.060 - 00:12:11.998, Speaker C: And we also have questions coming in still, I believe. So I'll post some of those at you and touch on some of the themes of for you all to tackle and for everyone listening. You're also welcome to drop your questions in this threads comments and we'll be monitoring them, Helix and I, and we'll try to pose them to our panel too. And finally, towards the end, I hope we have time to open it up to the floor and some audience questions too. So without further ado, so let's go in with talking about blockchain data, big view, bird's eye view, something that's really tempting right as one is starting in this new niche. To them as an analyst is to sort of be sort of just see that part of the ecosystem that you're looking at. You know, you are the analyst.
00:12:11.998 - 00:12:59.730, Speaker C: You're analyzing a topic, you have a SQL query in front of you that's running or maybe it's throwing an error, but it's really, really valuable to kind of step back and get an understanding and have a bird's eye view of the field as a whole. So to each one of you, the question can you talk about kind of your role and niche and experience with data, with a view on this broader blockchain data ecosystem? You know, some of you are kind of more on analyst side, some of you are more on the research side and the foundation. So how does that all plug into the big picture of on chain data? I'm going to throw it to Thomas first.
00:13:03.190 - 00:14:09.410, Speaker E: Yeah. So, well, I do think you it's easier to be good at something in a niche. My niche, I guess, is evolved over time, but at dune, I used to be quite about unchained data in general and just making it open source and having people contribute and everything. Right now it's definitely more ethereum, obviously. I think it's also different in the kind of work I do right now. It's more like at the intersection of academia and data science, I guess most of the things we do is writing scientific papers and most of our time is dedicated to research. But there is a more applied side of things and data side of things, because when we try to design mechanisms around Ethereum, we go back and look at the on chain data and kind of come up with new hypotheses and new ways of kind of researching things.
00:14:09.410 - 00:14:14.490, Speaker E: But yeah, I guess my niche now is pretty obvious. It's ethereum for sure.
00:14:16.630 - 00:14:24.730, Speaker C: That's so cool. Either Jones or Alex, do either of you want to jump in next? Up to you.
00:14:34.880 - 00:14:42.100, Speaker B: I can take it. I might have forgotten the question. The question is, I guess, how do you use on chain data?
00:14:42.480 - 00:14:44.300, Speaker C: Yep, that's great.
00:14:45.520 - 00:15:39.526, Speaker B: Awesome. Yeah, I'd say the way I've used it has evolved a lot in my time here. But like right now it's very useful for generating actionable trading decisions. A lot of times token prices are very driven by flows, especially like flows of big token holders like VC's or like the foundations or investors. And yeah, there's a lot of, I guess, actionable decisions you can make by analyzing the flows to exchange. Like the flows between wallets and every chain, every project has its own different set of wallets that you need to track different schemas. It's not always nicely formatted on Dune.
00:15:39.526 - 00:16:07.830, Speaker B: So sometimes you have to go to some random explorer and then like ping their API over and over again just to index things. So it gets kind of messy, but the messier it is, the more alpha it generates because less people are looking at it. And yeah, I think it's like not many people are looking at it. So it's very, I think, profitable, fruitful endeavor to do.
00:16:10.620 - 00:16:19.280, Speaker C: So. Cool to hear about your in depth experience with data and get a really digging in and diving in. Jones, do you have anything to add as well?
00:16:21.020 - 00:16:52.696, Speaker D: Yes. So actually my answer is quite similar to him. So I am also a trader. So I use on chain analysis to track wallet and then to make investment decisions. So I also track VC, wallethorne, token whales, smart money, that type of stuff. So my experience is quite similar to Alex in a sense. Besides that, I also use dune and transpose to do more fundamental analysis.
00:16:52.696 - 00:17:04.780, Speaker D: So for example, I would like to know more about the revenue of a protocol or the number of users. But all in all, I use onchain data more toward investing than researching.
00:17:04.820 - 00:17:56.180, Speaker C: Yeah, right. Awesome. So it's interesting to hear that some of your roles are kind of more focused and others are, you know, you're exploring kind of different protocols and different, kind of really varied, you know, breadth of data. With that, a question on specialists versus generalists comes to mind. This has come up for our students as well. What's your take so in ontane data? You know, are there, do you see more specialists versus generalists? Do you recommend being one versus the other? If you kind of see the path for becoming a specialist, kind of. How would you recommend somebody really new to the field takes it? Your take? Would anyone like to jump in first?
00:17:59.600 - 00:19:15.920, Speaker B: I'll throw my two cent on there. I think it's necessary to like, be a generalist up to a certain point. Like, you just have to be proficient with SQL and hopefully like maybe like Python and, you know, just like interacting with APIs and stuff like that. But I think, like, with the routes you can take, if you want to be a researcher for a specific protocol or a specific chain, it is very helpful to learn the specifics of the blockchain and how their data is structured so that you can do some pretty advanced querying and analytics on projects on a specific chain or that project itself. An example for myself would be back when I used to work on a Defi protocol in Solana. The account structure would be much different than what you'd see on Ethereum, and Dune wasn't the best indexer to use. So learning Solana specific things and generating things like, I want to generate the p and l of this portfolio, or I want to generate user actions and just specific stuff, more nuanced questions, I think get helped by specializing in a civic chain.
00:19:20.140 - 00:19:38.480, Speaker C: Awesome. Would you be able to talk a bit more for our neuroanalysts how to kind of how you recommend, you know, getting in, specializing in kind of maybe resources or maybe any approaches that you would maybe recommend to yourself if you're just doing it all over again? Now.
00:19:41.270 - 00:20:09.190, Speaker B: To be honest, I think specializing can get kind of hard unless you are working closely with someone who has expertise in a specific chain. A lot of the Solana specific stuff, I had no idea how they worked unless I was able to talk to my coworker who was a Solana blockchain dev. So I guess finding a developer in that specific expertise that can sort of guide you in deciphering the data would be really helpful.
00:20:11.250 - 00:20:57.200, Speaker C: Awesome. Yeah, so networking with developers who are creating or outputting that data and creating the events and everything for it and have a firsthand understanding and role to play and how it comes together. That's awesome. Yeah, exactly. With that, Thomas, I wanted to ask your take, since you are pretty specialized, if I say so myself, with Ethereum data and kind of ethereum topics, do you have your take on chatting with developers data and developer connections and any specialization and kind of diving more into smart contracts maybe as well?
00:20:59.640 - 00:22:26.918, Speaker E: Yeah, so I think, I think I agree with Alex. And you kind of have to start being a generalist and then kind of work on like, if you don't have them already, work on like your basic, I don't know, kind of basic coding skills and writing skills maybe. And then for me it was a bit more about like what drove me and like the people I met and what I was interested in that, that made me focus more on like Ethereum and kind of game theory mev side of things. But yeah, ultimately I do think it's very helpful to just jump on projects, do them like participate any way you can, and then sometimes you're going to jump on projects that won't be very interesting to you or maybe you won't feel that comfortable. And other times you actually meet very cool people and do some nice things. And then I do think there is a lot of value in also staying a generalist. I think it's also very worth it to have people that can just talk about a lot of like, yeah, talk about a lot of different things and write it in a concise way so that people can understand it.
00:22:26.918 - 00:22:35.330, Speaker E: And we don't all have to just like dive super, super deep into one chain or one protocol. So it just kind of depends.
00:22:36.510 - 00:22:49.090, Speaker C: That's important. There's really room for both. That's really cool to hear. Jones, do you care to weigh in on this question as well? Specialists or generalists and how to.
00:22:50.590 - 00:23:59.588, Speaker D: Yeah, so actually I am more advocate for specialists in like, I feel that when the market is more mature, you, you need to be more like a specialist to make a name for yourself. And moreover, I think that data analyzing, it's just the first step. And the user, the audience, they would focus more on the insight getting from the analyzing data itself. Yeah. So I think that being more specialized can help you get more experience and easier to provide insight here. So for example, if you are more, let's say so for me, I'm a trader, so I understand the viewpoint of traders, what they are thinking, what they are wanting to yeah. So I understand the perspective of traders and what they are needing right now and I analyzing the data and I provide in the seamless manner for them.
00:23:59.588 - 00:24:29.772, Speaker D: So you are aware that traders, they do not use alternative pretty much they use technical analysis and chart. So that's why my account is growing so fast right now because I can provide them what they need in a simple manner. That's one way to put it. So yeah, being a specialist can give you more advantage over other people. That's my take on it.
00:24:29.916 - 00:25:07.160, Speaker C: Thanks. A cool insight in there about what to do to be growing and to be growing your audience. So to refund that a little bit more, what would you recommend? New and beginning web3 data folks and analysts to be building, creating, maybe kind of exploring any specific topics, any specific niches, any kind of anything you recommend that someone who's starting today will be focusing on to kind of expand their reach and to maybe find what they're interested in. Anyone? I'm not going to throw it to anybody in particular. All right, awesome.
00:25:07.620 - 00:26:11.596, Speaker D: Maybe I can answer that question. Okay, so this can be a bit weird, but for new beginners, I actually would suggest you explore different types to explore as much as possible. So crypto is pretty new. And so if you are beginning, you can be quite overwhelming with the, the info. So for example, we have text, we have landing protocols, we have different change that type of stuff. So my take is that you should go out and explore and find something that fits that click. So for example, if you're new, you may be more familiar with Ethereum, but then I will suggest branching out to L2 and Solana or near protocol and see that if the ecosystem or the community that suits you and then you would decide to specialize on it and then develop your skill from there.
00:26:11.596 - 00:26:13.760, Speaker D: Yeah, that's my advice.
00:26:14.580 - 00:26:19.520, Speaker C: Awesome. Alex or Thomas, would either of you like to weigh in as well?
00:26:22.590 - 00:27:06.648, Speaker E: Sure. Yeah. I think my advice is a bit different, but it's complementary and it's very personal. But I think what helped me a lot in the beginning was just to also bring some kind of expertise in like a previous domain. So I think it can be anything. But I like for me it was, I was analyzing brain networks, so I kind of applied the same techniques I used to apply to the brain to blockchain networks and that's kind of how I started. But I know people that were lawyers and just got interested in the blockchain space and now working there too.
00:27:06.648 - 00:27:23.620, Speaker E: So I think it can be anything really, but I think it's helpful to bring in something from past experiences so that makes you unique and you can bring it to the space you are interested in.
00:27:25.040 - 00:27:37.380, Speaker C: That's great advice and appreciate your personal touch as well. It's cool to learn from what you went through and your experience. Alex, so what about you? What would you recommend?
00:27:38.960 - 00:27:57.280, Speaker B: Yeah, I'd say my advice is pretty similar to Moss's. I think having your natural curiosity drive you, it's definitely the recipes for success. And, yeah, I think like having a. Yeah, that's pretty much it. Yeah, I agree.
00:27:58.460 - 00:28:19.380, Speaker C: Awesome. All solid advice. Everyone agrees. Love to hear that. All right, so let's say our beginner analysts, they've now got their tools and now let's say, got their SQL and their domain expertise from what they were interested in before. Maybe they're exploring a little bit. They may be starting to learn smart contracts.
00:28:19.380 - 00:28:42.300, Speaker C: Any other go to tools that you use or recommend? Or how would you go about someone expanding their web3 data toolbox? And where would you look today? And this is to anyone who wants to jump in to.
00:28:48.510 - 00:29:33.910, Speaker E: Okay, I can go. So I think it's very case specific, but there is a surprising amount of APIs and data sets you can query from. So, yeah, I used to be mostly on Dune, honestly. Also, I work there. I still think it's great, but now that I have to focus on different topics and maybe sometimes data that's off chain, for example, I focus a lot on MeV now. So you have flashbots relay data that's available. You have Eigenfi that's providing MeV transactions.
00:29:33.910 - 00:30:02.140, Speaker E: You have rated. That's like looking at validators data and builders data. You have people just building free tools like Mev boost speaks. You have a ton of actual options that are very specialized and just very good at what they do. So for me right now, it's also about bringing these data sets together and getting insights from that.
00:30:04.680 - 00:30:10.980, Speaker C: Awesome. Alex and Jones, would you like to chime in with anything too?
00:30:14.600 - 00:30:53.830, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. Yeah. I think beyond the stack everyone knows about, especially for getting off chain data or maybe data from a place that doesn't have like a nice API for you to query, you have to kind of scrape it yourself. So I think like being comfortable with like a proxy provider and like rotating through proxies to scrape your data without getting rate limited or blocked I think has been really useful. Yeah, make sure you do it ethically. That's my advice.
00:30:56.020 - 00:31:00.080, Speaker C: That last part, love it. Jones, what about you?
00:31:01.980 - 00:31:31.540, Speaker D: Yeah, so I wouldn't recommend, like, trying out tools that would complement the existing one. So for example, like, I do more of my data analysis on do n transpose, but the labeling, the wallet labeling, and then, yeah. Is not quite sufficient for me. So, yeah, I also use Namsan as well and also like, do my own wallet labeling on either scan. So, yeah, I would suggest that as well.
00:31:32.680 - 00:32:18.490, Speaker C: That's, that's great. That's awesome. All right, so there's, there's a lot more questions our analysts and brand new and future analysts have. I'm gonna jump in with some practical ones. And of course, everyone wants to know what the space is going to look like and what the job market's like and how to look for some. So any takes on where do you see the space emerging? Maybe in the next six months to a year or maybe even shorter. We know how fast time moves in web3 and kind of any practical career advice, career building advice and for job searching, advice for brand new analysts.
00:32:18.490 - 00:32:35.730, Speaker C: And this is for anyone who wants to jump in as well. That's a big question. Anyone? Any takers?
00:32:36.830 - 00:33:20.328, Speaker E: Yeah, I can try. Thanks. So I think, well, on my perspective, a lot of projects are actually coming up now. And I like, I'm just going to speak about the Ethereum side of things because it's the one I know more. But for now, there's definitely like a kind of enthusiasm and a lot of innovations around L2, whether that's like optimistic roll ups or ZK roll ups. There are like a lot of projects being built around that. So I actually around the MEV space also.
00:33:20.328 - 00:34:21.492, Speaker E: It's pretty crazy. You have a lot of initiatives still. Company projects keep being created and being funded and exploding in the amount of innovations and complexity they are going to bring to the space. So I'm not really seeing any kind of slowdown in that aspect. I still think people are very motivated to innovate and to bring new things. And then as a career advice to start, I mean, yeah, I think jumping in with new projects that are cool and being created is actually a good opportunity because it's just like they are getting traction and working on the cutting edge technology that's happening. So joining them is probably interesting.
00:34:21.492 - 00:34:34.450, Speaker E: And as a very selfish take, I do think we need some more research and data science, like on L2, so we can all work together and collaborate.
00:34:36.670 - 00:34:48.650, Speaker C: Awesome. That's, again, a personal take which really appreciate and yeah, that's great tips. Let's see, Alex, do you want to jump in? Or maybe Jones, Alex, you got it.
00:34:49.960 - 00:36:03.110, Speaker B: Cool. My take's a little bit more cynical, I guess it is kind of shaped by personal experience. But I guess my advice would be like, if you're going to join in as a data scientist to a DeFi protocol or a foundation, I'd say make sure you're very hyper aware of their funding situation and also health of the chain. Like the higher up the frontier, you go up in both the protocol and the chain, the more chances you are to not have a job in a year if something turns bad. Obviously, Ethereum and protocols on Ethereum are not only funding rich, but also they're probably going to last for a while compared to, let's say, a random alt l one or something. I would just be cognizant of that and make sure if I specialize in a niche area that it's not going to be wasted on anything. That's probably the reason why right now I'm mainly using it for trading, is to extract as much now as opposed to later.
00:36:03.110 - 00:36:05.350, Speaker B: Yeah, that's just my take.
00:36:07.130 - 00:36:17.570, Speaker C: So important, doing your research, doing your own research and due diligence. I mean, that can't be overstated. That's really, really important. Jones, what about you? What do you, what advice do you have to impart?
00:36:19.550 - 00:37:06.510, Speaker D: Yes. So my advice is to be creative. And I cannot emphasize enough the importance of when you're starting out, you should create your own Twitter account and start creating June dashboard and other kind of stuff to get tractions. Because as I said, the job as a data analyst is to provide insight to the audience, to the people, and not just to analyzing data and leave the insight to the reader. So by creating a Twitter account, you can also hone your writing skills. And for the first part, I said you should be more creative. For example, you can come to now and then create a proposal to create a new dashboard for them and then to maintain them.
00:37:06.510 - 00:37:29.480, Speaker D: That's one idea. When I start. Yeah. And also just do it when you're starting out, there's nothing important. Just do it and then get feedback and then improve on your skills. And then the jobs will come, of course.
00:37:32.020 - 00:38:08.262, Speaker C: Love that. Thank you for. Thank you for that advice. I think it said in the space setting, just a quick moment, that everyone is now muted. Is that cool? Do we want that? Is that for speakers? Okay, everyone is now unmuted with that intermission. Let's jump in into maybe the hottest question of panel today. Any, we already got a lot of great advice from you all.
00:38:08.262 - 00:38:38.860, Speaker C: I really appreciate you sharing your wisdom, but any really, really kind of slept on advice or a hot take about what to do and what maybe not to do for someone breaking into on chain data right now. And this, too is for anyone who cares to jump in or maybe elaborate on prior advice you were giving as well.
00:38:41.560 - 00:39:19.810, Speaker B: I guess my take would be, like, for contractors or for grant proposals, I do think they're generally underpaid for how many hours you have to do. And I think it's a great way to get your name out and establish sort of like, a proof of work and, like, use it as a launch pad into finding, like, a job. But, like, yeah, I think it's typically not worth just being, like, good doing that, like, forever. It's like, my hot take, I guess.
00:39:21.870 - 00:39:29.670, Speaker C: Yep. Appreciate that. What about Tomas? Do you have any hot takes or any really slept on advice to break into veto today?
00:39:34.130 - 00:40:16.670, Speaker E: No. The only thing I'm thinking about is I do agree. I didn't want to sound too optimistic, and I really do agree with Alex. And you should do a lot of research before you want to join in on anything, including protocols. It's like, yeah, that was. That was implied, but maybe not very clear in my explanation. And, yeah, for, again, from, like, a personal standpoint, I spend a lot of time talking and researching any kind of either protocol or project or company I want to join.
00:40:16.670 - 00:40:32.070, Speaker E: And you can just like, yeah. Spend months discussing with people, kind of seeing if it's a good fit and. Yeah. So I think Alex's tech was quite important to remember and.
00:40:33.050 - 00:40:37.790, Speaker C: Yeah, yep. Super important. And, Jones, what about you?
00:40:40.250 - 00:41:25.870, Speaker D: Yeah. So maybe my final is to quickly find your own group. So, like, group of data analysts, like, for example, newbie to study with each other so it can help you to motivate and learn faster. I remember that when I started, I encountered many problems that may seem that looking back is very easy to fix. But, yeah, having a group or like a mentor can help you discover the problem much faster than if you are working on your own. Yeah, that's from my experience.
00:41:26.610 - 00:41:53.820, Speaker C: Great advice. Thanks. Thanks for your advice, Jonas. Thanks for all your advice. That's about it for the questions that our analysts have asked. And we do have a bit of time, so I do want to invite everyone here to jump right on in. If you have any questions for our panel today about breaking into and accelerating your career and web3 data, please raise your hand.
00:41:53.820 - 00:42:06.800, Speaker C: We'll put you on stage if you'd like to ask a question, and I'm going to take a look. Also, if there are any questions in the chat, although I think not yet.
00:42:07.950 - 00:42:10.270, Speaker A: Yeah, we have two questions in the comments.
00:42:10.350 - 00:42:10.630, Speaker C: Awesome.
00:42:10.670 - 00:42:13.650, Speaker A: One from Ludovico and one from Liam.
00:42:15.470 - 00:42:20.850, Speaker C: I'd be looking in. Not the right place. Would you mind reading them out? Helix?
00:42:21.750 - 00:42:39.940, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. Okay, so from Ludovico dot ph h proof of humanity, a question for. So I spoke. That's tomasd. Any advice for someone that is thinking of transitioning from academia into web3 metrics?
00:42:43.600 - 00:43:10.916, Speaker E: Yeah, that's a. That's a good question. So it's. It's. Well, I guess one of the things is it depends what research you were doing for sure. If you are like, a computer scientist or, like, you know, cryptographer, it's quite easy these days to actually find jobs for me was. It was not exactly the same.
00:43:10.916 - 00:44:03.746, Speaker E: I did have, like, some computer science background, but, like, I mean, I think it really depends where you want to go. If you want to keep doing research, then. Then I actually look into, like, a lot of. Yeah, new solutions or even layer tools or whatever, and they often have, like, a small research team, so that might be an avenue. And if you actually want to transition towards more, like, data science, well, then having a background, at least in some, like, doing some codes or just, like, basic math and stats, is usually useful. And then the last thing I would say is it did take some getting used to. It was super interesting.
00:44:03.746 - 00:44:36.050, Speaker E: I actually loved it. But transitioning from academia and the whole world of academia, which is quite remote and separate from, I don't know, private companies or startups, the transition, you kind of have to learn how it works, kind of the rules of everyone and how to interact with everyone. But other than that, it was actually a very smooth and cool experience on my end, so I definitely think it's very possible.
00:44:40.150 - 00:45:06.770, Speaker A: All right, thank you for the insight. I do think that's very helpful for someone like Ludovico or anyone else in academia. Yes. On specific advice on that specific situation. Thank you, Tomas. Marina, the other question we got, it's not entirely clear to me, but maybe you can cyber it from Liam. I am OPC and can't talk.
00:45:06.770 - 00:45:34.330, Speaker A: My mic is a problem, so that explanation. But the question is, can we use on chain data analytics for this topic? Yeah, they asked us at a specific time, which was 29 minutes ago, so it's hard to know what we're talking about at the moment. I already asked if they could clarify, and maybe they will, but in the meantime, I guess we could move on to live questions.
00:45:35.870 - 00:46:06.220, Speaker C: Yeah. Thanks, Felix, for spotlighting those two questions. And let's see if the person who asked might want to clarify and jump in. Otherwise, would anyone else like to raise their hand and post a question directly to our panel about breaking in two or three data. All right, it looks like we're winding down. There are no more questions.
00:46:07.110 - 00:46:40.830, Speaker A: If no one has any questions, I I might actually have a question for. For Alex. And maybe you don't want to get into this because maybe it's quite controversial or not. I don't know. The. The moment I discovered you was actually the war. From the one thread on uniswap and back in November, I thought that was so gutsy.
00:46:40.830 - 00:46:55.590, Speaker A: I'm not even sure what my question is, but I'm just, like, curious about that whole situation and how it went down and how you even, like, worked up, like, the nerve to do that. I guess I thought that was very brave.
00:46:56.850 - 00:47:27.910, Speaker B: Yeah, I appreciate that. Yeah, I think back then, like, I had maybe, like, 500 followers on Twitter. I was writing, like, a report on, like, the state of Defi for, like, our protocol. So I was just going over, like, unclotalized lending, you know, Dexs. What's the other one? Staking and derivatives. And I was just, like, talking about capital efficiency and all of them, and we're gonna, like, release, like, a quarterly report that was, like, the original plan. So I built, like, a dune dashboard for each of them.
00:47:27.910 - 00:48:22.220, Speaker B: Like, one of the highlights was, like, the efficiency of price discovery on Dexs, like, how efficient of a price discovery mechanism it is. And I sent it to a friend who is building a Dex, and he wrote a thread saying that uniswap is bad for retail traders because of how inefficient it is. And I guess the world needs to know. Uniswap replied, saying, the query is wrong, the dashboard is wrong. Everything's just wrong about this. And I guess that's when I felt the need defend my query, because it definitely wasn't wrong. So, yeah, I wrote a thread and it blew up, and it cost some drama, but I think it was good for the space to see, I guess, the price efficiency mechanism measured in a novel sort of way, and.
00:48:22.220 - 00:48:25.220, Speaker B: Yeah, that's the story behind it.
00:48:26.880 - 00:48:47.066, Speaker A: Yeah, I remember that. That was quite crazy. And to me, it was, like, hardening to see the community really get behind you, and obviously, you blew up after that. I get. Yeah, that was crazy. I think I just wanted to, like, appreciate. I'm sorry.
00:48:47.066 - 00:48:50.630, Speaker A: Express my appreciation for that. That was awesome, man.
00:48:51.530 - 00:48:53.910, Speaker B: Thank you. Appreciate the kind words. Means a lot.
00:48:56.850 - 00:49:26.400, Speaker C: So cool. It's a super cool example, too, to me, of, you know, being an analyst for on chain data and really kind of going in and finding for yourself and making the case that you have to make with the data that's not, you know, gated, that's available, and just kind of putting your methodology out there and having a conversation about it or defending it or whatever it may be, I think that's a really cool kind of empowering moment of on chain data analytics for me.
00:49:29.220 - 00:49:30.520, Speaker B: Yeah, I totally agree.
00:49:31.940 - 00:50:02.782, Speaker A: Yeah, 100% agree. I think that's, you know, that's so cool. That's when this stuff really comes to light, to life, where you, like, starting to research stuff that actually matters to people and that makes a difference in the space and that has an impact on how people go about things or how they view certain reports or metrics or whatever it may be, but you're having an actual impact on people and on the space, and that's just awesome to see.
00:50:02.926 - 00:50:43.970, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's a beautiful way of phrasing it. I think, like, picture tells like a thousand words, but like, a dashboard can tell the whole story. And because of how the public form of Twitter is like, able to amplify just like a single person, like, it's cool to see it. Like, I think it reached, like millions of people are talking about it just from like a single tweet. And like, it kind of changed, like, the whole public discourse around the situation. And yeah, I, looking back at it, I don't think I realized it at the time, but looking back at it, I think I. The power that you're able to wield just as one person with like, data analytics and like, building visualizations is quite, quite beautiful.
00:50:46.150 - 00:51:00.238, Speaker C: Very decentralized. Gotta love that. We have a couple of questions that are coming in or a couple of requests to speak and ask a question coming in from our audience. So I'm gonna give the mic to sorabd if you'd like to ask yours.
00:51:00.334 - 00:51:55.210, Speaker F: Hi. First, thanks to Matrix Daw for organizing this. And I have question to each one of you. And the question is, for someone who have, who are pretty proficient in, let's say, SQL and have done data analysis for some time in Web two world and have, I would say, beginner level or moderate understanding of blockchain data, how would you suggest I should tackle next couple of months in terms of what project I should think of on my own or what area I should focus on that would give me best return in terms of impact or like, ecosystem would really like it when I build that. Is my question clear or is it little bit more broad? I'm not sure. Hello?
00:51:56.510 - 00:53:14.254, Speaker E: Yeah, I can try to find out. It's a tough question because it's very, I guess, dependent on what you like. But, yeah, I'd say if you were like, if you basically want to work in the blockchain space, well, like, one very, very important step is to actually do your research and kind of try to find the projects you are most inspired by. And then once you, like, found a couple of projects you really, really like and you find their mission or their ideas or their goals fascinating, then just reach out because you already kind of have the skills that are needed to be either, like, data analyst, scientists or anything. So if you really want to do that and then if you see a project that really, you like a lot, but, like, you don't have the skills yet to maybe apply and be proficient, then, like, work on these skills and along the way, like, kind of publicly post everything you do and. Yeah, I. I don't know.
00:53:14.342 - 00:53:14.582, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:53:14.606 - 00:53:15.690, Speaker F: Makes sense. Yeah.
00:53:18.190 - 00:54:17.476, Speaker B: I think if my take, if you're trying to maximize, like, impact, is to be very aware of the narrative, the current narrative, granted that assuming you're decently well versed in domain knowledge and how blockchain, like a DeFi protocol, like, all the different types of DeFi protocols and what's important for a blockchain, metrics around those. Assuming you're up to date on that, then tracking what the public eye is focused on right now in the past week or two is really focused on L two s with the arbitrage launch, building a dashboard to track some relevant metrics and the users and stuff like that, I think we've gotten a lot of attention. I think in the upcoming couple weeks, it'll be the merge. If you're able to get a dashboard up to track or not. Sorry, not the merge. Shanghai. If you're able to track, like, withdrawals, I think a lot of people will be intensely watching, like, how many people are withdrawing and potentially selling their ETH and.
00:54:17.476 - 00:54:22.524, Speaker B: Yeah, just like, I guess just, like, figuring out, like, what's in the meta and, like, tracking that, I think, is my advice.
00:54:22.652 - 00:54:23.356, Speaker F: Yeah, makes sense.
00:54:23.388 - 00:54:23.796, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:54:23.828 - 00:54:24.440, Speaker F: Yeah.
00:54:28.100 - 00:54:59.792, Speaker D: Yeah. So my advice is quite similar to Alex. If you want to, like, make the moon most impact in terms of growing your. Your account or growing your presence on social media, is definitely best that you follow the narrative of the trend. So, for example, like, in the past weeks, I have created a dashboard on arb tokens. So, like, for falling wallet and that stuff. And I also do a dashboard on Zaggy sync and Stocknet bridge.
00:54:59.792 - 00:55:30.462, Speaker D: Bridge trend. Yeah. So it's going quite fast. And I gained a lot of style on dune, so that. So that's one way to do it. On the other hand, if you want to focus more on growing your skills. So I know that you are already a data analyst in web two, but I actually tutor many people like you, so they are very proficient in web two already, but they want to make a move to web3, and they still have a lot to learn.
00:55:30.462 - 00:55:40.486, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah. So maybe try to figure out what. What you want best and then make a plan for it. Yeah.
00:55:40.518 - 00:55:43.278, Speaker F: Thank you. I think it makes sense I would work on it.
00:55:43.294 - 00:55:46.542, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thanks.
00:55:46.646 - 00:56:49.694, Speaker C: Awesome, awesome questions. Thank you, everyone, for all of your advice. I think we had a couple of folks who also had raised their hand, and they're on stage, but unfortunately, I see them dropped. So if they come back in the next little while, we'd love to have them back on stage. Otherwise, would anyone else like to jump on and ask a question before we start to wrap? All right, it sounds like there are no more questions today, so we really, really appreciate all of your advice and your time and your personal stories and your well deserved warnings and well important warnings to do your own research and stay vigilant. I appreciate all of you today on stage and our awesome speakers, and I'm gonna turn over back to Helix. It's been a pleasure.
00:56:49.694 - 00:56:50.530, Speaker C: Thanks all.
00:56:54.000 - 00:57:34.390, Speaker E: Yeah, I forgot to mention something. Can I. Thomas, please, please go ahead. Yeah. So talking about, like, some kind of things you can join and groups you can, if you're interested, join? Yeah, we just. We are launching, like, a, what we call rig open problems, and it's an initiative around MEV data. So basically, we are trying to bring people from the MEV space at different parts of the stack into getting together and evaluating kind of the network health from an MEV perspective.
00:57:34.390 - 00:58:12.060, Speaker E: And we are looking for anyone that's motivated or that really wants to dig in MEV data. And so that goes to researcher or both, like, analysts, data scientists, traders also. So if anyone is actually interested in joining, we also have, like, a small grants that we give out for projects that actually go, like, go a bit deeper and, like, for people that really want to work on this. So, yeah, I forgot to mention it. I want to do.
00:58:15.080 - 00:58:19.300, Speaker C: Thank you for shouting this out. Gonna say thanks.
00:58:20.760 - 00:58:50.026, Speaker A: Thank you. Thank you, Tamara. Yeah, that's amazing. Please, like, please do share this type of stuff. Yeah, I remember we tweeted this out as well, because this is. It's just really cool and, like, it's stuff our audience loves, you know? Of course we want you to share this and we'll be happy to cross promote or help amplify. Yeah, for sure.
00:58:50.026 - 00:59:28.860, Speaker A: Same goes for Jones and Alex, by the way, if you have any initiatives or anything that you, you want to share before we leave, please take this opportunity right now before we close it out. If not, of course, that, that's also cool. Yeah. I want to thank everyone. Marina, thank you for being our lovely moderator and for your great questions. Alex, Jones and Tomas, thank you for being here and for sharing your insights, your experiences. Your experiences.
00:59:28.860 - 01:00:03.360, Speaker A: You've been around here for a while. Love your insights. People can definitely take a thing or two from, from your story, so thank you for that. Everyone in the audience, please go ahead and give these guys a follow. There's tons of great stuff on the regular, so be sure to drop them a follow. Yeah, before we close out, just want to make sure and repeat that. We got another Twitter space going on.
01:00:03.360 - 01:00:54.250, Speaker A: It's Wednesday, so two days from now on the future of work. So daos, decentralization and our metrics app, it'll be very interesting. I'll be interviewing some very, very interesting guests and getting their thoughts and philosophy on the, yeah, the future of work and decentralization Wednesday. We're also doing a product session on Sentio, so if you want to up and elevate your analyst game, you can take that webinar. That'd be great. If you want to join our next cohort and learn web3 analytics, that's also possible. Best thing to do right now is jump in our discord, get involved, and you'll be notified when the next registration opens up.
01:00:54.250 - 01:01:37.120, Speaker A: And we want to remind everyone to vote on the student dashboards on jokedao. You can find them all in the highlights at the top of this Twitter space or in the comments. You'll find it on our profile page, the metric style profile page. So, yeah, once again, thanks everyone. Thanks to Marina, thanks to Moss, thanks Jones, thanks Alex, and definitely thank you to all of you in the audience for being here and being part of this amazing experience. Thanks, everyone. Have a good one.
01:01:39.060 - 01:01:39.852, Speaker C: Thanks all.
01:01:39.956 - 01:01:40.508, Speaker E: Thanks, everyone.
01:01:40.564 - 01:01:41.444, Speaker C: See you soon.
01:01:41.612 - 01:01:42.140, Speaker B: Thanks, guys.
