00:00:01.560 - 00:00:35.808, Speaker A: Welcome, everyone, to another metricsdao Twitter space. Today we'll be talking about layer Zero, which is an interchange operability protocol, which we'll also be diving in and talking about. And maybe we'll also touch on airdrop farming or hunting, whatever you want to call it. And we're going to do this all with a data driven approach. So I'll be your host and moderator for today. I'm Helix. I'm a big believer of making data driven decisions, and I'm inspired by the possibilities that crypto brings.
00:00:35.808 - 00:01:22.360, Speaker A: And therefore, I love bringing a web3 analytics community together to connect and learn with metrics now. So for the people in the audience who are not familiar with Metricsdao, Metricsdao is a community of web3 data analysts and ways you can earn, learn, and connect. So, so we do pay analytics challenges courses and webinars. We got a discord, you can jump in. And of course, we got this weekly Twitter space on the hottest topics in web3. Always approach with data driven insights from top analysts and researchers in the web3 space. So today we got Chase Devens from Missouri, we got Tim from Defi Llama News info, and we got Springsan.
00:01:22.360 - 00:01:40.360, Speaker A: Glad to have you all. Guys, please introduce yourselves and tell us a little bit more about your general background, but also how you, how your work relates to today's topic.
00:01:43.220 - 00:02:25.290, Speaker B: Sure, I guess I can go first here. I'm Chase Devins, senior research analyst over at Masari. Got into crypto mostly studying defi, but now pretty much cover anything under the sun. One area I'm super excited about is just anything cross chain. I've written wrote a report about two months ago covering kind of layer zero growth from a data driven perspective after their latest funding round. I've also covered various other cross chain platforms and compared them last summer that reports open to the public over at Masari.
00:02:28.830 - 00:02:58.330, Speaker C: Hey, everyone, I'm Tim. I'm a journalist at DL News, the news arm of Defi Lama, and my reporting takes me to all kinds of places in crypto. One of them is crypto bridges interoperability protocols. At the beginning of the year, I wrote a pretty extensive piece looking at bridges and bridge hacks and why they occur. And that took me to studying and looking a lot closer at alternative ways to bridge between chains like layer zero.
00:03:02.670 - 00:03:10.810, Speaker D: Hello, I'm currently doing some data analytic works on doing.
00:03:24.880 - 00:04:11.960, Speaker A: Hey spring, I'm not sure if you can hear me, but it seems your audio is breaking up a little bit. I cannot hear you. I still can't hear you. Unfortunately. Maybe you could try rejoining the space. Is anyone else getting a signal from spring or it's just me. Okay.
00:04:11.960 - 00:04:53.928, Speaker A: Trying to go back to listener now. Yeah, let's try reinvite a speaker. Spring, you should have an invite. I'm hoping it's popping up. Maybe we have some technical difficulties, because I know that Tim also took a really. You also needed a lot of time.
00:04:54.094 - 00:04:54.420, Speaker C: Hey.
00:04:54.460 - 00:04:55.760, Speaker A: Yes, I hear you. Now.
00:05:01.700 - 00:05:29.590, Speaker D: Some data analytic work on doing platform many. And I am a team leader doing some web two development in the past. And currently we are tending to switch to web3 failed. So maybe we do more data analytical. Yeah, this is my brief introduction.
00:05:33.650 - 00:05:58.460, Speaker A: Interesting. I wasn't aware there was actually a whole team behind you, but that makes sense given your work output. Let's say that you're putting out a lot of content on. On Dune and Twitter, which is always of very high quality. And now I can see how you manage that. Good job on that. Okay.
00:05:58.460 - 00:06:46.460, Speaker A: Thank you for those introductions, guys. I think I want to start with introducing the topic of today and just, you know, asking what is it really for anyone in the audience who's, like, not familiar, for people who don't have a very heavy tech background? Let's set out the context here. So can you guys tell me what layer zero really is from your own point of view, from your understanding? Maybe also tell us how it's different from bridges, because it's kind of similar, but I think it's also not. Yeah. Who wants to go have a shot?
00:06:47.640 - 00:06:50.060, Speaker C: I can jump in first. Can you hear me okay?
00:06:51.400 - 00:06:53.220, Speaker A: Loud and clear. Thank you, Tim.
00:06:53.520 - 00:07:18.992, Speaker C: Awesome. Yeah. So it's kind of in the name layer zero. It's something that you can imagine as being, like, below these layer one chains, like Ethereum, Solana, avalanche, and so on. It's an interoperability protocol that can sort of tap into all of these chains using its system of a relayer and an oracle to sort of like. It's almost like Lego blocks. Maybe if you imagine like that, it's easy.
00:07:18.992 - 00:08:06.928, Speaker C: They can. It can sort of snap them together and then allow data or messages to be transferred across. And it's just really got two things to it is, like I said, the Oracle, I think they use Chainlink Oracle at the moment to prove, like, that an asset's price or some piece of data is what it actually should be. And then they have a relayer, which at the moment, you can use layer zero's own in house one as default, but you can also set it to whatever you like. So you can make that as secure as you want. And what can you do with this? Being able to transfer messages? I mean the one thing we see right now is Stargate. It's the flagship, flagship product and it's, it's this omni, omni chain bridge.
00:08:06.928 - 00:09:08.064, Speaker C: You can transfer funds using this method from any chain to any other chains. It's fast and it's kind of debatable about security, but I think it's very much worth noting how it differs from some existing bridges like the wormhole bridge in the past. Actually very recently we've and seeing some concerns with the multi chain bridge, they use, or did use multi signature wallets to hold funds. So you've got maybe let's say about ten people on a team and they are all signing on a multi signature wallet. Usually you need a majority to sign off on transactions and seems pretty secure. But if those people, if they're private keys that they need to sign the multi signature wallet get compromised, if enough of them do, then it still can be, can be hacked or exploited. You don't have any of that worry with layer zero in a sense, and that there is no centralized point of control like a wallet that holds funds.
00:09:08.064 - 00:09:18.060, Speaker C: Everything is done through smart contracts instead. I'm sure that other people can expand more on that, but I'll leave it there for sort of a basic introduction.
00:09:23.890 - 00:10:16.638, Speaker B: Yes. The one thing I would add is a lot of the trust assumptions really baked into kind of what oracle network you decide to use to pass these cross chain messages. Obviously right now they default to their own oracle as well as I think they're migrating over to the chainlink one, as Tim mentioned. So to me it's very similar to what Chainlink is working on with their CCIP protocol. So I'm really interested in seeing how the two of those compete once that goes live, probably later this year. Another interesting thing about layer zero is they have these concept of ofts. So omnichain fungible tokens also o nfts omni chain non fungible tokens.
00:10:16.638 - 00:11:29.420, Speaker B: And what these are essentially is a catch all token standard. Can think of it similar to like an ERC or BRC 20 that's really interoperable with any of these existing standards. And so it allows pretty much anyone, any protocol to function kind of as their own bridge and issue these ofts across any chain by doing like a mint and burn function. So you burn the oft on one chain, mint it on another. That way you don't have to deal with the issue of having funds locked in a smart contract and having a wrapped asset on another chain that could be exploited in kind of like those two spots. The only area that could be exploited is just at the, the control layer through, like, the Oracle network there. But pretty much these omni chain fungible tokens allow for a lot of design flexibility and for developers to plug into any of the supported networks without having to configure a standard across multiple different chains.
00:11:34.810 - 00:12:42.060, Speaker D: My knowledge about layozero is mainly from their offshore documents, because I don't use it too much myself. I think the main point that attract me is about the capability to send native tokens or call across chains, and it even can help you to send some native gas to the target destination network. So you can send some token you have on this thing, but get the native token on the destination network. I think this is a key point for mass adoption because myself had the problem that I don't have gas on Liu chain to start my transaction. So I think this is very interesting and created many new chances for developers.
00:12:49.720 - 00:13:25.520, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a familiar problem, right? When, whenever you decide to jump on a new chain, you always need, like, some gas. So you always need to send something there first. Okay. Thank you for laying the groundwork here. Let's, you know, introducing the topic. So what got you guys interested in researching this? What, what were you excited about or was inspiring, or what possibilities were you seeing that we haven't seen before?
00:13:31.580 - 00:14:43.618, Speaker B: The reason I got interested in layer zero is they have a really strong business development team, and they have their hands in a lot of different buckets. So it's tough to really go into the cross chain world without coming across layer zero. The reason I wrote a kind of a longer updated report on them a couple of months ago was on the back of their race that valued them. I think it was their Series B valued them at just around, like $2 billion, fully diluted. And surprisingly, if you compare that to something like the top layer one networks, that's actually more than NIR and algorands fully deleted market caps. It's more than a couple of other circulating market caps for some of the big layer ones. And so just seeing that from, like, the early adoption of layer zero and more particularly in early 2023, as it's really started to hockey stick in its growth, its investors are pretty much pricing this as, like, a layer one network.
00:14:43.618 - 00:15:17.260, Speaker B: And obviously, like, right now, there is no layer zero token. Kind of proxy it through stargate. But again, that's just specifically for the proprietary bridge. I thought it was pretty interesting to see how investors are kind of thinking about this protocol more so from, like, its own standalone network in the future compared to some of the other cross chain protocols that we see that are more so just bucketed into, like, a bridge category and have far smaller valuations attached to them.
00:15:21.000 - 00:15:42.150, Speaker A: Okay, so I hear you. It's making huge waves. Big valuation investors are getting attracted. They also have really good biz, Dev, so you came across them everywhere. I was another point to touch on that later spring. And Tim, what got you guys excited about this and what put it on your radar?
00:15:43.290 - 00:16:15.064, Speaker C: Yeah. So I guess the same thing as chase, like, the evaluation that it recently got to was very much out of the blue for me. It surprised me. But then when I thought about it some more, it doesn't perhaps shouldn't be so surprising, because there's a hell of a lot of potential with layer zero. The fact that it can be this sort of base layer. You can have assets that will transcend all of these different layer one chains, and they can all be linked through this universal router. There's a huge amount of potential there.
00:16:15.064 - 00:16:53.864, Speaker C: And I guess it's like in crypto, a lot of the time, people, I mean, it's very speculative. So people are going to take that, take ideas, things that could be, and they'll run with them. And that's kind of what I think is happening with layer zero. Not to take away from the interesting nature and I guess the novel nature of attack, but certainly there's some speculation surrounding it. I guess that's what's put me onto it also, I've spoken to some of their team members, like Brian Pellegrino in the past. I've gotten quotes for him, for some of my articles. Really great guy to talk to.
00:16:53.864 - 00:17:04.980, Speaker C: Very insightful comments he's provided me. So that only made me more interested in L2 and what they're doing. Sorry, layer zero and what they're doing over there.
00:17:06.920 - 00:17:18.176, Speaker A: Yeah, so many layers. Layer one, L2, layer zero, layer x. Yeah. It's funny you mentioned Brian. I talked to him and asked him if he wanted to be on.
00:17:18.208 - 00:17:19.240, Speaker C: He couldn't make it.
00:17:19.360 - 00:17:51.042, Speaker A: Same went for Max there, the head of their data team. But I promised them I shared this space with them, and maybe they'll have some interesting input or feedback afterwards. Let's see. Yeah, you mentioned a very interesting thing also like this. Certainly as a user, and I think a lot of people will identify with this in crypto. It's almost like you have this very fragmented experience. Okay.
00:17:51.042 - 00:18:30.370, Speaker A: You're doing some stuff on this chain. But then now this new NFT coming out and it's on another chain. So you need to, you know, have another type of wallet and have another type of token, etc, etcetera. And it like this project does appeal to that centralized UI or UX where it's like, as an end user, we talk about this often that, you know, you should have way simpler experience. Like, okay, you just go on to happen, do your thing. Like, what's happening on the background, like all these different blockchains, maybe you don't even know about that as a, as an end user. Interesting points.
00:18:30.370 - 00:18:40.210, Speaker A: Definitely feel the same thing. That's definitely one of the appeals here. Spring, what got you excited about this?
00:18:41.910 - 00:19:33.040, Speaker D: Okay. I think the capability to send any message is what they are trying to do currently. Maybe we many see users upgrade tokens to other blockchain through layer zero, but from their documents, I see it also supports NFT to be breached. And actually you can send any message according to your usage. So I think there is lots of usage errors to come in the near future. Thank you.
00:19:35.580 - 00:20:20.730, Speaker A: Thank you, spring. So, yeah, okay, so again, this possibility to just, you know, go from one chain to the other, send anything, anywhere, is certainly very appealing. All right, guys, I want to ask you, so you've all done your own research. I always like putting this bit of like an open question out there. It's like, okay, what did you look at? What did you research specifically and what did you see? So what, you know, can be observations or numbers, but certainly also, like the next step maybe would then be, okay, so what are the insights from that? Right, what do you conclude from that? Yeah, curious about your research.
00:20:25.430 - 00:21:01.068, Speaker C: Okay, I'll win. So, yeah, I've got to take the opportunity to promote defi llama here. The bridges dashboard is great place to check out and see what's going on. And for Leia Zero specifically, we've got Stargate. Like we've mentioned, I, and I think this is something you planning on touching on, maybe later on. But the number of transactions and the volume going through the Stargate bridge through layer zero is astronomical right now. Just looking at it right now, there's been over half a million transactions in the past 24 hours.
00:21:01.068 - 00:21:30.074, Speaker C: And to put that into perspective, the next biggest, almost active bridge is the seller, sea bridge, at about 9200 transactions. And again, an interesting point in the data here is you can look at, for example, the one month volume on Stargate. It's about 2.15 billion. And that's with, like I said, half a million of transactions over the past 24 hours. And that's not unusual. That seems, you know, I checked yesterday as well.
00:21:30.074 - 00:22:21.534, Speaker C: It was about 400,000 transactions. If you look at the arbitram bridge in comparison, you got about 1.24 billion volume over the past month. So only about half as much as Stargate, but with a lot fewer transactions. Only about 1776 over the last 24 hours. And what this says to me is that there's a lot of people doing sort of smaller transactions on Stargate, whereas arbitrum, there's people doing bigger transactions bridging onto there. And so that leads me to the conclusion of what I'm trying to say here is I think that Stargate is getting, there's a lot of people who are using it in the hopes that they'll get an airdrop of a potential layer zero token further down the line.
00:22:21.534 - 00:22:27.770, Speaker C: I don't think it's too big of a secret. Yes, that's what I've been looking at recently.
00:22:29.200 - 00:23:07.526, Speaker B: Yeah. I can also build off of that. I think the arbitrum airdrop was like March 23 or something, and for a while that was kind of like the biggest airdrop farming opportunity. That was like public knowledge. And ever since that point, there's a couple dune boards that track the layer zero air job farming. And the amount of transactions, like getting routed through the various layer zero supported protocols has just gone like exponential. I'm sure there's plenty of people running different bots and stuff to have daily transactions repeated and whatnot.
00:23:07.526 - 00:24:22.820, Speaker B: So it's tough to gauge exactly how much of the activity is organic versus just kind of like this farming. I sent a DM to the Metricsdao account with a thread that I have with a couple of charts on this topic. But one that's really interesting is more from like an organic perspective, is the layer zero monthly contract deployments. We saw pretty stable deployments over the last year, and then in March and April, that number just shot up probably about like three times the average per month for the last year. So what that signals to me is that developers are actually starting to come implement layer zero contracts more. And to me that's a lot more telling than just the transaction activity that we're seeing on top going back to the airdrop farming. And then another thing that I like to look at is just kind of the different ecosystem of applications that are starting to get traction.
00:24:22.820 - 00:25:20.406, Speaker B: I know one omni chain NFT issuance platform, I believe it's called holograph, recently launched. I don't remember the exact collection, but they set a record for a number of new mints or unique mints on that. A free mint that can be done across any chain. So starting to see actual usage of some of the different applications within the ecosystem is really interesting. And I guess the last point on that is the number of active users and transactions using the BTC boft, which is pretty much the same thing as bitcoin. However, it can be transferred across any chain or any layer zero supported chain. The number of users on that has increased very steadily over the last couple of months.
00:25:20.406 - 00:25:57.340, Speaker B: They're primarily coming from avalanche, but arbitrum is also seeing some good growth there. And there's a dune board that I can pull up a link of that shows just the percentage of transactions that's coming through BTCB versus wrapped bitcoin, specifically on the avalanche network. And I want to say it's up to like 98% dominance for BTCB now. So you're starting to see more of a shift in like collateral types as well as different derivatives. Adopt this oft standard that's built on layer zero.
00:26:00.490 - 00:26:05.710, Speaker C: Yeah, interesting. David. Oh, sorry, go ahead. Sperm.
00:26:07.170 - 00:27:08.260, Speaker D: Okay. From my side I noticed several interesting points. Firstly, there are more than 75% users only active in less than five days on layo zero. So maybe they just come to do some transaction and waiting for the coming airdrop. Secondly, I saw the transaction increased very fast. Start from May 6 ma six is the first workday after the Telepublic holiday for the library holiday. Does that mean lots of users for layer zero is Chinese.
00:27:08.260 - 00:28:04.680, Speaker D: The third one is yesterday the transaction and active users reaches the wartime high. So from the among them the BNB chain contribute most transaction. It's about 30% from BNB chain. The fourth point I saw was Stargate has about 65% of the total transactions from layer zero. So maybe other apps need get more users to use. This is a short summary. Thank you.
00:28:09.980 - 00:29:04.940, Speaker A: Okay, some pretty remarking statistics there. So what especially caused my interest is you're saying only. So in fact 75% of users only got active in the last five days, which seems like a big, like big, big spike. And it's interesting to hear that there's a lot of activity on this chinese festive day holiday which might also, you know, point in direction of a lot of users or airdrop farmers being chinese to, to touch on that further. Right. The whole airdrop farming which. Yeah, like Chase said, like the first time I really heard like a lot of chatter about airdrop farming was with arbitrary.
00:29:04.940 - 00:29:22.180, Speaker A: Suddenly everybody was like, hey, did you like get get like Arp dropped to you or like, you know, this, this going crazy, blah blah blah blah blah. And since then, it seems like that's like a real big thing is.
00:29:24.280 - 00:29:24.616, Speaker B: Like.
00:29:24.648 - 00:29:42.820, Speaker A: I'm guessing, you know, that brings up a lot of questions. So, like, because it does seem this has a very clear use case, but that, the other hand, it does beg the question, like, okay, is this really organic? What do you guys think? Which side are you leaning more?
00:29:44.490 - 00:30:19.200, Speaker C: It's absolutely not organic. But like you're saying that doesn't really, like, matter if you believe the tech is good. Personally, I do. I'd like to really stress something Chase said as well about you cannot trust these metrics. Like, I don't know, volume through the bridge or users, because, yeah, a lot of it will be people. Well, first of all, they'll just be like your average Joe who's like, oh, I'll do it on one or two accounts because I might get an airdrop. And then you've got the industrial airdrop farmers who are doing this on hundreds and hundreds of accounts.
00:30:19.200 - 00:30:58.170, Speaker C: So that's bumping up the metrics. But, yeah, looking at developer activity, like Chase said, I was speaking to Uri Colodny of Stocknet the other day, and we were talking about stocknet's growth, and he was saying, yeah, we don't look at these metrics like users or transaction volume on stocknet because they're just very open to misinterpretation is what he said. And he was like, yeah, we look at active developers, how many people are committing on posting commits on GitHub, for example. That's a much better way to see who's adopting the chain or the product or the protocol or whatever it might be.
00:31:00.040 - 00:32:03.424, Speaker B: Yeah, to kind of follow up with that. One thing that I think has allowed layer zero to quickly bootstrap developers is just the ease of onboarding for building on the protocol. I think their tagline is like, you can integrate layer zero with five lines of code, and once you do that, you strap into the endpoint smart contracts, you pretty much gain access to any layer zero supported chain. And they've been adding pretty fast throughout the last year. The one that I'm waiting on particularly is support for Solana. I think that we just, the industry as a whole lack a good, reliable bridge to get from Ethereum to Solana. And with wormhole liquidity kind of drying up on that front, if there's to be a return of Solana Summer, I think it needs to be ignited by a reliable bridge provider.
00:32:03.424 - 00:33:03.530, Speaker B: And I think Layer Zero is really well positioned for that, considering what they did with the Aptos bridge a few months ago, kind of went out of their way and just developed a really good, easy bridge protocol to get in and out of apdos. I'm pretty sure that's been some of the biggest volumes coming in and out of Apdos has been through the official layer zero supported one. So if they run that playbook back with Solana, I think that's very promising for them. But, yeah, just to double down on what Tim had said, I think really, the important thing for tracking actual growth and usage of these networks is going to be looking at things like developer activity, because so much of the user facing stuff right now in crypto is very inorganic. And, you know, there's not many actual products that are being used on the day to day by people that aren't necessarily just airdrop farming.
00:33:08.510 - 00:33:36.540, Speaker A: Interesting. Okay. So to. To, um, pose a pretty dumb question, maybe, but I'm, you know, what do I know? I'm not an analyst. I'm just a marketeer in this space. So I'm just trying to figure it out and learn here as I go as well. Um, then what you say makes absolutely sense, but why then do so many protocols adopt this strategy of, like, doing air drops?
00:33:39.160 - 00:34:53.000, Speaker B: I think to me, the airdrop phenomenon is just proven to work to get actual users. And I think a lot of people that aren't as ingrained into the space will kind of just look at the metrics on a user perspective, because that's how we measure a lot of things in web two and are comfortable with it. And everyone likes free money. Right? So if there's an opportunity to run a couple of transactions a day and potentially qualify for five or six figures worth of an airdrop, it's pretty compelling to go ahead and do that. And I think going forward, we might not see the same airdrop strategies to things like uniswap and arbitrum, where it really just rewarded actual activity with the protocol. We'll probably see some sort of more evolution in terms of qualification. But I think for now, until we see things shift in a material way, like, people are going to continue to just try to farm in the existing ways.
00:34:54.860 - 00:35:35.112, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, ultimately, it might be a really inefficient way to get users, but it's definitely proven to be an effective one if you hint at an airdrop or even liquidity farming. So it's going to be really hard, I think, for crypto as an entity to wean itself off that, especially when, if you're launching a new product. It's going to be very tempting to hint at an airdrop because you know that it's going to get people using it. Even if it's not organic, it's exposure. You're exposing more people to it. They have to use the product if they want to try and get the airdrop. And some of them will be like, hey, this was useful.
00:35:35.112 - 00:36:01.016, Speaker C: This was pretty good. I was the same. I saw that layer zero had a bridge to aptos or from aptos, ended up using that. I was like, oh, that's good. And then I went back and used it again in the future. Yeah, like I said, it's going to be difficult to stop doing it when it's proven to be effective. But yeah, for now it seems just to be something that everyone accepts.
00:36:01.016 - 00:36:15.510, Speaker C: Like, you know, we're going to get an airdrop and we're going to give you an airdrop and, you know, it's kind of like a hidden handshake on that. You know that people just sort of agree that that's the state of things and yeah, I think it'll be quite difficult to change that.
00:36:20.690 - 00:37:12.820, Speaker D: I think it is very reasonable to send the airdrop to users who have joined the ecosystem at the early age because we are doing transaction on blockchain. Every transaction needed gas. Many people spend lots of gas phase to use the application if there is low expectation to future airdrop. I believe lots of people want to use those apps. It looks to me very reasonable to do airdrop for, for users.
00:37:16.080 - 00:37:54.230, Speaker A: Right? Okay, so I get what you're all saying and like, like I said, I am a marketeer. So even from that point of view, it does make sense. Usually you have a budget to do, like marketing, but, you know, the point of marketing ultimately is to acquire users. You know, you could come up with all types of fancy like content strategies and whatnot. Or you could use that same budget, promise it to the users, and maybe, you know, that is more effective. Maybe it's easier as well. So interesting, interesting strategy and it does seem to be paying off in a big way for now.
00:37:54.230 - 00:38:39.290, Speaker A: There's another thing I, and you guys definitely feel free to ask each other questions as well. Or if you have like, things that you were like wondering about and want to like get each other's takes on, totally feel free to bring it up. Goes for the audience as well. Just drop your questions in the comments and we'll get to them. One thing I had, again, very much like maybe a newbie question, but one thing that stood out to me, like, we're always in crypto talking about liquidity pools, and that's like important. And I kind of got the sense that, you know, with Stargate, you basically have like a unified liquidity pool. That's what they were calling it.
00:38:39.290 - 00:38:58.180, Speaker A: Like, am I, am I right? And if so, like, is that a big deal? And if it's a big deal, why is that a big deal? Anyone can, can shine some light on that, maybe. I know it's very specific question. I'm kind of like putting you on the spot. Is this one thing I was curious about?
00:39:02.400 - 00:40:22.410, Speaker B: Yeah, I can try and take this. So from my understanding, the unified liquidity pool is different from some of these other bridge liquidity pools that are popular like synapse or multi chain, for example, in that usually you need to pair like the wrapped asset that a bridge produces with like the canonical asset on the chain. And so it takes up or requires a lot more liquidity, like from LP's. But what Stargate does with this unified liquidity pool is they pretty much just have people contribute the canonical asset to the liquidity pool, just single sided. And they run kind of like a, I think it's called like their delta algorithm or something that kind of does. Like if this much is requested to be burned on this chain, mint this much on or release or kind of reallocate that amount to the user on the other chain. So there can be imbalances in the amount of liquidity across the different chains.
00:40:22.410 - 00:41:23.760, Speaker B: So let's say that I bridge USDC from avalanche to Ethereum. We would be increasing the amount of USDC liquidity that's going into the unified liquidity pool over an avalanche and then decreasing the amount of liquidity in the pool over on Ethereum, as I'm know, withdrawing out of that side. So what the unified liquidity pool will do is increase the rewards for providing liquidity on the Ethereum side and drop the amount of rewards on the avalanche side to kind of incentivize people to kind of come rebalance it. And then the users or the liquidity providers that come fill that hole. We'll also get a portion of, I can't remember the exact name for like the fee, but essentially there's like a rebalancing fee that will be rewarded to the people that kind of come top up the liquidity pools.
00:41:32.500 - 00:41:33.680, Speaker A: Go ahead, spring.
00:41:34.820 - 00:42:47.310, Speaker D: Yeah. To me, I think the United pool can bring some advantage. It has low percentage loss, so users can gain more from the liquidity pool. And I think it adds more, make the liquidity pool more deep. So you can utilize tokens from multiple chain into the liquidity pool. And since you don't need to warp the token before you swap, the transaction fee also can be a bit lower than currently two tokens payers. So I think these are some advantages for United pools.
00:42:56.660 - 00:43:07.400, Speaker A: Okay, so if I'm understanding correctly, this allows you to have a bigger liquidity pool. Bigger liquidity pool means lower transaction fees. Is that like the short and dirty of it?
00:43:20.870 - 00:44:01.630, Speaker B: Yeah, it's just a lot more efficient, and it removes the need to have kind of like, these wrapped assets. Like liquidity is locked on one chain and the derivatives minted on another. And that could become unbacked if a hacker came and drained one side of it. So really more so centralizes the attack surface into, like, a single spot rather than spreading it out to a lot of, like, disparate places. But I'm sure there's some efficiency gains in there as well.
00:44:04.170 - 00:44:28.710, Speaker A: Gotcha. Okay, cool. Interesting to keep seeing these developments in, in crypto and how we keep improving processes. We way to do things. And everything's getting bigger, or not necessarily bigger. Well, also that, but just more efficient and just better. Okay, cool.
00:44:28.710 - 00:44:57.280, Speaker A: We're nearing a little bit the end of the hour, so I kind of want to reshift our focus and, you know, look forward a little bit. So I want to ask you guys, what, what do you think will happen next with layer zero? What are some things that we can anticipate and also maybe what would be good areas to research next for any analysts out there in the audience?
00:45:00.140 - 00:45:50.940, Speaker C: So there's one thing I'm pretty interested in to do with layer zero, and that's these protocols that they're building directly on layer zero. And they're trying to build probably defi protocols that you know about stuff like lending protocols, like Aave, but they're trying to do it. Omnichain, the one that I'm most familiar with is called tapioca. Now, they've been going for quite a while. They've built up a pretty strong community, and what they're planning on doing, basically, very simply, is to have the first cross chain omnichain lending protocol, and where users can also mint sort of a USD stablecoin that's interoperable across all the chains that layer zero can tap into. So I'm quite interested. It hasn't launched yet, but it seems like they've got a lot of talented devs that are working hard.
00:45:50.940 - 00:45:54.920, Speaker C: So I'm interested to see what they eventually launched.
00:45:57.210 - 00:47:00.930, Speaker B: For me similar to what Tim was just saying about the native omni chain applications. Another one I would put in there is radiant capital. It's kind of doing the same thing with cross chain lending markets. I thought this would get more traction when layer zero was first rolled out, but it seems like only really sushi swap was a main integrator on top of Stargate. So there's an option on Sushiswap that lets you swap from one chain swap any asset on one chain, receive a different asset on another, and they plug into Stargate directly underneath the hood and kind of abstract away a lot of, like, the complex transaction logic there. So I think just more of a trend towards these omni chain applications where users don't necessarily care which chain they're interacting with. They just want the easiest execution, lowest prices is something that will continue.
00:47:00.930 - 00:48:10.740, Speaker B: I believe that layer zero just put out a co authored report with the University of California, Berkeley's blockchain department, and that was a study on market research on what an ideal cross chain wallet should look like. I think wallets are just very ripe for innovation, obviously, like, metamask is dominant. But, you know, what is metamask actually, like, added in terms of ux for the last couple of years? Not much. And so they were talking about what might a ideal cross chain wallet look like? And would definitely encourage people to go look into that pretty basic in terms of, like, the findings, pretty obvious in that, like, you know, people want to be able to do all sorts of transactions just with one click from a single interface and have it primarily be mobile focused. And that's exactly what layer zero can enable. And we wouldn't surprise me if layer zero came out with conflict, their own proprietary wallet in the next year or so.
00:48:18.040 - 00:48:35.670, Speaker A: Awesome. So I'm hearing we're anticipating Dapps to build on layer zero and become really omnichannel. We're expecting wallets or hoping for them spring. Anything to add here?
00:48:36.570 - 00:49:00.820, Speaker D: Okay. Yes. I also wish to see more apps developed on top of the layer zero. And I think it will be quite interesting to do more data analytics against the apps that will be using layer zero in the near future. So I look into that.
00:49:05.920 - 00:50:05.960, Speaker A: Yeah, of course, like, all this new activity and new technologies, you know, they, you know, they garner, they bring up new data, they make new data available to look at, and that's like a gold mine for you and any other analysts out there on, obviously. Cool. I want to close it out, but before we do, I want to invite you guys to. Today we talked about Layer zero but it would be cool if you guys can also share other stuff that you're currently working on, like hot projects that you're about to drop, maybe dashboards, maybe newsletters, maybe reports and let us know that. But also where we can find those, like, you know, your, maybe your own Twitter, maybe some website, let us know.
00:50:10.220 - 00:50:55.160, Speaker B: Yeah. For me, I do regular updates on kind of like the defi sector. Going to be looking into kind of like payments protocols in the next month or two, doing a large report on that. You can find all of our reports over at Masari IO. You can also sign up for daily newsletter and then also I regularly post snapshots of my content on my Twitter profile as well as our main sari account will also broadcast quite a bit of our content. Yeah, that's what I've got. And thanks again for hosting us Helix and the rest of metric style.
00:50:58.580 - 00:51:32.930, Speaker D: I created a new dashboard yesterday for Zksync, which is another L2 blockchain that users also hoping it will doing a bigger airdrop in the near future. I think X is another hot topic in the coming days, so you can find my dashboard on doing it is published under the six degree lab team account.
00:51:43.250 - 00:51:43.626, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:51:43.658 - 00:52:09.330, Speaker C: And for me, yeah, I'll be continuing to write for DL News, obviously, so if you haven't already followed them on Twitter, please do, please check out the site. We just had a bunch of new journalists, so we're putting out lots of content every day. Really good stuff. So yeah, I hope to hopefully back here again in the future as well to talk about some good topics. Thanks again, helix for organizing it. It's been great.
00:52:11.470 - 00:52:35.738, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. We'd love to have you back, Tim. And that goes for Chase and spring, of course, as well. So yeah, give these guys a follow. Chase gonna do more stuff about payment protocols and defi in general, so follow him and follow Mazari crypto as well. Give spring a follow to check out his dune dashboards. He's dropping one on ZK sync, which should be awesome.
00:52:35.738 - 00:53:03.838, Speaker A: And Tim's gonna keep putting out awesome reports over at DeFi llama. Really, really excited to see DeFi Llama having a news arm right now. So exciting times, exciting stuff. Thanks for being here. If you're in the audience and you thought this was awesome, then be sure to be here next week as well. We doing these weekly. The one next week will be a little bit earlier.
00:53:03.838 - 00:53:52.366, Speaker A: It will be at 10:30 a.m. eastern time, but just check out our twitter to stay updated and it will be on supercharging your analytics website web3 career and we're going to have all female panels, so pretty cool. There are definitely some female analysts out there kicking ass, and we're going to see how they do it to learn from them. Other than that, you can follow metrics. Now for cool web3 analytics challenges, content and education. So we got webinars going on from data partners right now. We got courses launching soon, and of course, we got our discord and paid analytics challenges.
00:53:52.366 - 00:54:04.790, Speaker A: So check us out on Discord, check us out on Twitter. You can find us at metrics, Dao Xyz as well. So thanks everyone for being here, and thanks again to the speakers. See you next time.
