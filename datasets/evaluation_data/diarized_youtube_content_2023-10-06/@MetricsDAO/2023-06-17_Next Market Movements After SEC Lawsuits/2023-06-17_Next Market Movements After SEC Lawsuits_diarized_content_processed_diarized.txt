We got Lena from 21 shares, Clara from Keiko data D or effort from Blockworks research.
00:01:25.126 - 00:01:54.120, Speaker A: Then we got Joanna and Adam from Defi llama News info. Adam, glad to see you made it as well. Thank you for being here, sir. And finally, we got Jimmy van Stratton from crypto Slate. Welcome, guys. Please tell me a bit more, or tell the audience a bit more actually, about yourself, your work, and specifically what you've investigated on today's topic. Lena, maybe you want to take it away.
00:01:56.500 - 00:02:21.830, Speaker B: Pleasure. Thank you so much for having me, guys. I hope you guys can hear me well. My name is Lena Deep. I've been working with 21 shares since June 2021. Before that, I used to be a business reporter based in Cairo, reporting on startups and entrepreneurship and tech in the Middle east. Specifically about this, the topic of this Twitter space.
00:02:21.830 - 00:02:55.700, Speaker B: I usually co author a newsletter with newsletter published on 21 shares. And we have a special report on the Binance and SEC lawsuit. So we're pretty in the mud in this case. We also have a dream analytics dashboard spearheaded by Tom won. He's here listening. Make sure to follow him. Pretty sure everyone here follows him.
00:02:55.700 - 00:02:59.700, Speaker B: And yeah, that's pretty much it.
00:03:07.760 - 00:03:17.340, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you for that introduction, Lena. I really enjoy your weekly newsletter. Been following it for a while now. Awesome. Thank you for that.
00:03:17.380 - 00:03:18.156, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:03:18.348 - 00:03:25.440, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. Definitely. All right, who wants to go next?
00:03:28.500 - 00:03:29.480, Speaker C: I can go?
00:03:33.100 - 00:03:33.796, Speaker A: Sure. Please.
00:03:33.868 - 00:03:55.056, Speaker C: Hi. Thank you for having me. I'm really happy to be on this knowledgeable panel. Adam and I are from DL News. We are funded by, but very emphatically independent from Defi llama, and we cover the crypto and defi markets. I came out of tradfi. I think Adam did as well, but I'll let him tell you a bit more about himself.
00:03:55.056 - 00:04:08.260, Speaker C: And as journalists, we are just following the Coinbase and binance lawsuits, as you might expect. So I feel a little bit of imposter syndrome being around all this data talent today, but that's where I'm coming from.
00:04:11.530 - 00:04:12.170, Speaker D: Okay.
00:04:12.250 - 00:04:16.710, Speaker A: We appreciate all research based perspectives, Joanna. So it's all good.
00:04:17.010 - 00:04:46.100, Speaker E: I jump in there and. Yeah, just to kind of piggyback on what Jonah said, work at DL News, sort of a trifle background. Yeah. I started off with Business Insider a few years ago and then spent a little over a year at the block covering markets and companies with DL News for the last. I guess I've come up with my first month now, so it's a fun time to start covering news with the Saturday on news, just as everything kicked off the SEC. So that's kind of where I'm coming out from.
00:04:54.080 - 00:05:07.090, Speaker A: Love it. Always good to have some experienced folks from tradfi now in our blockchain space to share their ticks. Any other analysts? James D. Clara.
00:05:08.030 - 00:05:34.290, Speaker F: Yeah, hi. Thanks for having me on. Yeah, I used to work for a hedge fund, Seidler and company. More coming from the macro perspective, so then came to crypto slate to understand it more from the crypto perspective and, yeah, just looking at it from an on chain perspective, from a trading perspective, so it's really interesting to see what's actually going on at the moment.
00:05:41.490 - 00:05:48.874, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. Thank you for that. There's definitely a lot going on, that's for sure. Dee or Clara, care to introduce yourselves?
00:05:48.962 - 00:06:04.322, Speaker G: Yep, I can go. Hi, everybody. My name is Clara. I'm the director of research at Keiko. Keiko is a crypto market data provider, so we specialize in centralized exchange market structure. We also do some defi analysis. So, of course, the binance.
00:06:04.322 - 00:06:25.730, Speaker G: Binance us and coinbase lawsuits have been sort of top of book for everything we've been looking at this week. We noticed that there was an 80% drop in liquidity on finance us in the hours immediately following the lawsuit. And so that's been sort of the big thing that we're looking at today. And now, of course, more recently, the CRB and then tether depegging.
00:06:33.200 - 00:07:08.190, Speaker D: Yeah, I'll jump in here. Thanks for having me and everyone else here. My name is Dee. I've been in the crypto space for about six years now. Currently work at Blockworks Research, predominantly focusing on the cosmos ecosystem, but really just following all market happenings. Prior to working at Blockworks, I was working for two years at a crypto hedge fund in DC as a lead analyst and also trader. And yeah, I'm excited to talk about the current market situation and I think where we all expect the market to go from here.
00:07:10.650 - 00:07:36.374, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. That is definitely today's angle. Let's call it that. Clara already mentioned the Deepak from better. I wasn't aware that it's so directly related to that, but I guess we'll come to that. Let's start at the start, though. And I'm looking to our reporters, maybe they're the, the best position to start this out with.
00:07:36.374 - 00:07:49.286, Speaker A: Let's call it like a little summary of the events of the last two weeks or weeks and a half. How did this all start and what's been happening since last Monday?
00:07:49.478 - 00:08:20.790, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. So I think it's clear that you asked me before, is finance in trouble? I think, yes, it's obviously in deep trouble. There's the SEC complaint from last week. It already had one pending. It already had a pending lawsuit from the CFTC, and we're momentarily expecting an indictment from the DRJ. The SEC and CFTC suits are civil, while the DRJs will be criminal. And that will probably relate to the fact that binance allegedly facilitated billions of dollars worth of money laundering.
00:08:20.790 - 00:09:22.150, Speaker C: So the SEC is obviously, is probably what we'll focus on today. And the allegations there are pretty damning. I was surprised to see a lot of defensive of binance on Twitter because I was thinking if I was a customer of binance, I would be pissed. This is not just, I think you see these kind of highfalutin phrases like registering as a broker dealer and you think, oh, that just kind of sounds like something that would annoy Gary Gensler. It's nothing to do with me. But what they were really doing was lying to investors, customers, denying the protections and transparency that users of the platform are kind of entitled to as people who live in a country with very strong securities regulation, leaving aside the fact that they weren't even supposed to be marketing to these people necessarily. So some of these allegations, I don't want to go into it too long and take up too much airtime, but because there's obviously a lot, but just to pick up two of my favorite inadverted commas.
00:09:22.150 - 00:09:55.230, Speaker C: They engaged in watch trading using a subsidiary called Sigma chain, basically buying and selling the same security to make it seem like there's more liquidity and activity going on on the platform. For various reasons, you'd want to do that. And then the other thing that they did was kind of regulatory arbitrage. They created this, what they called the Tai chi entity, bam. Trading that established binance us. And the point of this was to pretend that they were going to kind of separate out binance from its Us arm. But the.
00:09:55.230 - 00:10:17.150, Speaker C: The allegations at least, are that CZ, the CEO, kind of kept this really tight grip on Binance us and was profiting from it. So that's kind of what really jumped out at me about the suit. But obviously, there's so much more to talk about. I think maybe, Adam, if you'd like to add anything from your marker's perspective, maybe.
00:10:17.490 - 00:11:22.720, Speaker E: Yeah, I think you covered it kind of well for regulation and kind of main, like the important stuff, but from market side of things, I guess price prices kind of dipped on the news initially when the binance suit was announced. There was less of an impact, I guess, on Coinbase when the enforcement action against Coinbase was announced. But I'm not quite sure about why that was, if smaller user base or, I mean, if the market already absorbed most of the bad news. But maybe some of the research, some of the researchers can tell us a bit more about that, like Nina and Clara. But I guess in the time since volatility picked up, because I know markets volumes in May fell to like three year lows, lowest point since May 2019, volatility spiked and volumes were up a little bit. But with inflation and the fed yesterday out of the way, it doesn't look like there's much, kind of many more catalysts for markets on the horizon, I guess, until the 26 July next Fed meeting, but they've signaled two more hikes before the end of the year, so quite hawkish.
00:11:23.500 - 00:12:07.880, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's also, obviously, I didn't talk about Coinbase here, but that was also in a pretty crazy week. It just kind of dropped the next day after binance, and it looked, if you kind of open it, it just looks like a bit of a cut and paste, but they're extremely different situations. Binance was kind of, if the allegations are accurate, it's kind of almost like nakedly criminal or nakedly fraudulent, while Coinbase will, you know, that's just very different. That's more about a. What's the word, the interpretation of the law. It's like, do you agree with Gansa everything is a security? Do you agree with Coinbase that they've kind of been really fairly untreated and. Sorry.
00:12:07.880 - 00:12:18.710, Speaker C: Really unfairly treated, and they've kind of done everything that they could to be compliant? So, yeah, I think that was what we sort of saw last week.
00:12:20.930 - 00:12:51.360, Speaker F: Yeah, I agree. I think there's a clear difference between Coinbase and binance. I think Coinbase just listing supposedly unregistered securities. So it's a completely different kettle of fish with binance, but in terms of similarities with binance and FTA, in terms of COVID.
00:12:53.340 - 00:13:25.038, Speaker A: I'm sorry, James, I'm going to cut in here. James, I hope you hear me, but your audio is cutting in and out. Maybe move to two part of the building where you have better connection. I hope you have. Okay, nothing more from James until now. I hope we get James back in a second. D I see.
00:13:25.038 - 00:13:27.810, Speaker A: Also unmuted. What would you like to.
00:13:29.870 - 00:13:32.050, Speaker D: Yeah, can everyone hear me okay?
00:13:33.150 - 00:13:34.302, Speaker A: Loud and clear.
00:13:34.486 - 00:14:28.590, Speaker D: All right, perfect. Yeah, I was just going to kind of, I guess, add a little bit to, or add a little color to, I guess, the coinbase and binance lawsuits. So, yeah, I think it's obvious that these are two different categories of lawsuits that are going against binance and Coinbase. One is just saying, like, this is the market stance that the SEC has as a regulatory body of the entire crypto asset space. And the other one's really saying, you. Yeah, not only are you selling unregistered securities, you are potentially laundering money, you know, leveraging customer funds, commingling customer funds to do illegal activities with it. I think the major question now is, was that the binance of old was, or is that still how Binance operates today? Is binance still potentially doing nefarious things with customer funds? Is this a repeat of FTX 2.0?
00:14:28.590 - 00:15:09.860, Speaker D: It looks like a lot of the information that was in the lawsuit for binance was predominantly focused on the era of 2018, 2019, when, if everyone remembers, that's really, like, when Binance was a two, three year old company. They obviously gathered a substantial amount of market share in that period. But there's also a chance that the binance of today is not necessarily what they were back then, when they were potentially doing those illegal activities again. All of these are just hearsay for now. We don't necessarily know if this is true. They're innocent until proven guilty. But I think there's a completely different types of lawsuits that are going on today.
00:15:09.860 - 00:15:49.914, Speaker D: But unfortunately, the problem is that the entire market's finding out in real time what assets SEC deems are securities. There was a large overlap. Like, I forgot who said it. I think it was Joanna said that the lawsuits were relatively copy and pasted in terms of the SEC stance on what assets they deem as securities. But there's also, really, interestingly, there was things that were missing. One asset that I personally cover a lot in blockworks is Adam, one of the largest asset in the cosmos ecosystem, the binance us lawsuit. SEC said that Atom is a security, but for Coinbase, it said it wasn't.
00:15:49.914 - 00:16:29.304, Speaker D: It didn't explicitly say that it wasn't, but it wasn't explicitly called out as an under registered security. And we're not exactly sure what that means. But what I think is interesting is that because the SEC in these lawsuits are saying, like, these list of assets are securities, we saw a lot of second or second order effects for another, for other companies that do have crypto as an offering. So, like Robinhood. Right, because the SEC registered Sol, or claimed that Solana and Matic, and I believe Cardano are unregistered securities, we saw Robinhood say that they're going to. They pretty much hold their. Their entire customer base.
00:16:29.304 - 00:17:14.180, Speaker D: We're going to stop selling these assets because of the unregulatory certainty around these assets. And you essentially need to go sell custody them yourself. Or if you don't self custody by such and such date, we're going to force liquidate your assets and then convert them into cash on your Robinhood account. And I think that was when you really saw the large precipitous fall in the market this past weekend, because I believe that Robinhood announced this on Friday, and I think people looked at Robinhood's balance sheet and saw that they had, like, $1.4 billion in assets that were altcoins. That might not be the exact number, but it was a large number. Regardless, the market kind of realized that, oh, shit, there could potentially be a lot of selling pressure for our altcoins.
00:17:14.180 - 00:18:05.700, Speaker D: You saw bitcoin and ethereum take, like, a two to 3% drop, but you saw the likes of Matic, Cardano, Solana, near. A lot of the assets the SEC explicitly mentioned are unreached. Securities have a 20% plus decline, and it was heading into a low liquidity, a liquidity event over the weekend. And I think the market's kind of anticipating that. There's a chance that you might see centralized exchanges, at least in the United States, and other fintech companies that have these assets on there as a service offering that they might ultimately have to make the same decision, which is to completely delist it, which I don't think that's the case. I think ultimately, the companies that have already made this decision to delist have already done so. We already know Coinbase said that theyre not going to stop their staking product.
00:18:05.700 - 00:18:21.200, Speaker D: We already know that Coinbase, theyre not going to delist any of their assets. So I think at this point, ultimately, the market is all about the marginal buyer and marginal seller. And I feel like, at least in the United States, if you havent sold yet, im not really sure what will cause you to sell forward looking.
00:18:27.550 - 00:18:54.550, Speaker A: Right. If you've been holding onto now, then you're probably pretty convicted crypto holder or user. Right. That also makes sense with regards to last weekend when everything was in the red. That explains why. So all these securities that were listed in by the SEC basically are tainted right now. That's the way to put it.
00:18:54.550 - 00:19:16.030, Speaker A: What does the rest think? Is our, like, is crypto deeply in trouble here? Will it stay contained to just us markets, or will it expand further into the global crypto markets? Clara, I see you unmuting.
00:19:16.920 - 00:20:17.082, Speaker G: Yeah, I mean, so we've been talking a lot about binance and sort of the nefarious activity there, but the reality is that Coinbase has a lot more to lose than binance does in this situation. 80% of Coinbase's business right now is in the United States. And so the fact that the lawsuit is essentially saying it's essentially putting Coinbase's entire business model at risk, they have no choice but to fight it till the death. Whereas binance was binance global, binance us is a very, very small, tiny fraction of finance global's overall trade volume and just overall influence over the crypto ecosystem. In fact, binance us never really penetrated us markets at all today. I mean, in the week before the lawsuit came out, I think it had, like, less than 10% of total us market share. And this market share was extremely volatile over the years, probably because there were some really weird things happening, like always a new zero fee trading promotion.
00:20:17.082 - 00:20:43.830, Speaker G: There was now allegations of the Wasp trading. And so it's, I guess, can be assumed at this point that Americans weren't really using binance us. They would almost always just go for Coinbase or Kraken. And so binance, I think, can make it through globally because I guess they're everywhere. Whereas it's really going to be tough for Coinbase in the near future to sort of maintain strong business.
00:20:45.410 - 00:21:15.832, Speaker D: Yeah. What I will say is, I agree with everything Clara said. One thing that I think there's a whole brand recognition that Binance has and CZ. I kind of liken like, CZ and Binance to like, Tesla and Elon Musk, like they're attached at the hip. CZ has such, like a fervent followership. And even on the backs of the binance announcement of them potentially co milling, commingling funds, and doing all these nefarious activities, you saw about like $1.4 billion in outflows over the past week from Binance.
00:21:15.832 - 00:21:41.198, Speaker D: And I'm getting this information from Defi llama. And I think they have arguably, like, the best centralized exchange transparency dashboard in the business. But that's like 3% of their aum. It's really not. It's like a blip on the radar. You would think that if finance users were really afraid of them losing their funds, they'd be withdrawing en masse. And hopefully Binance is actually not lending out their customer funds like FTX was, and should be able to wind down accordingly.
00:21:41.198 - 00:22:33.820, Speaker D: But the reason why I was kind of going back to this whole Elon Musk Tesla argument is because if the DOJ does come down on Binance, and specifically CZ, and says he is indicted in the potential, like, lawsuit, and they need him to step down from being the CEO of Binance. And I think you saw some news on Bloomberg last week that Binance is already potentially, like, thinking about the air successor to CZ. I think he's. I forgot his name off the top of my head, but he's like an ex regulatory head in Singapore and also in Dubai, or. Yeah, I think Dubai. And he's potentially going to be like the new CEO and chairman for Binance. I do think that the confidence in binance as an entity, once CZ steps down, is actually going to be like the telltale sign for how sticky their user base is.
00:22:33.820 - 00:23:04.030, Speaker D: And you could. I personally think you're actually going to see a lot of users actually leave Binance and go to, like, the OKX's and buy bits of the world, because during these outflows for binance, you saw a lot of inflows into those exchanges. And it's kind of like playing whack a mole at this point. Like, what exchange is like, I guess, the safe haven, which today there really is none internationally. And obviously binance is going to be the number one for the foreseeable future. But I think if CZ is forced to step down, that could be an interesting event to see, like, how good their brand is.
00:23:08.090 - 00:23:18.270, Speaker A: Right? Any thoughts as to why those exchanges specifically seem like safe haven havens to those users that cause the outflows?
00:23:23.530 - 00:23:59.120, Speaker D: I think they generally have good products. They have liquid markets. As of today, knock on wood, they haven't been fined or been caught red handed doing anything nefarious. I honestly think it just like, where else are you going to go? You couldn't go on chain. Not a lot of customers, not a lot of crypto users feel comfortable self custodying their assets, but they also want access to leverage. They want access to a bunch of long tail assets. And those are the two largest perpetual futures, centralized exchanges that they can get access to those types of products.
00:23:59.120 - 00:24:34.610, Speaker D: And binance has, like, I don't know. I'm sure Clara can give us a more precise answer. But they have probably 90% plus market share. Binance does in all crypto market share in terms of trade volume. And, I mean, I think, regardless if finance goes down or not, I think it's a good thing that we're seeing more market share in these other venues, just because, especially as an industry that prides itself on decentralization, it's not a good thing that regardless if they're a good actor or not, it's not a good thing that one entity has 90% market dominance in an industry like this.
00:24:35.990 - 00:24:49.040, Speaker G: Just to clarify, they have about. I think the last time we checked, like, earlier this week, was about 65% market share, which is, I guess one exchange at 90% market share would not be great for crypto right now.
00:24:50.220 - 00:24:53.724, Speaker D: Is that for futures plus spot, or is that just futures?
00:24:53.812 - 00:25:06.428, Speaker G: This is just spot and actually, derivatives, binance, Okexon, Huawei are actually sort of edging in on Binance right now. So binance is a little less dominant right now.
00:25:06.604 - 00:25:07.720, Speaker D: Okay, that's good.
00:25:23.790 - 00:26:02.924, Speaker A: Okay. Small summary finance, Coinbase, they're both in trouble, are a lot more serious. But on the other hand, Coinbase's business is totally dependent on what happens in the us market, and that's where the lawsuit is taking place. So if they fall, they fall all the way, whereas binance has a way out because it has global markets. And then, as Dee pointed out, um, they might it. The way I would summarize it is kind of like CZ might turn out to be the fall guy. So, you know, he turns out to be the scapegoat.
00:26:02.924 - 00:26:24.470, Speaker A: Somebody else can step in, and binance can kind of continue operations. James, I'm glad you rejoined us. Hopefully you have a better connection this time. I do want to give you the opportunity to respond to the other speakers or what you originally wanted to share with us?
00:26:27.610 - 00:27:06.570, Speaker F: Yeah, I went out. So I have missed parts of the conversation. No, but I just wanted to allude back to the similarities between binance and FTX in terms of commingling funds. Like this time last year, FTX pretty much had the most amount of coins on exchanges. And then literally four or five months later, we all know what happened. So it's weird how correlations work. So, yeah, it's, there's, even on the trading we can see that BNB suppose being artificially lifted as well.
00:27:06.570 - 00:27:26.090, Speaker F: So it's not great. But yeah, it's hard to put a point on it without being suggestive. So it's hard to have actual data, which is what we're in for. So it's hard to actually say definitive answers.
00:27:50.880 - 00:28:07.300, Speaker A: Educated guesses about what could potentially go down next or maybe what. In the past, you usually see how you see situations unravel a similar scenario, right?
00:28:08.320 - 00:28:48.520, Speaker F: Yeah, well, similar bear market stories and scenarios. The news will tank the market and then obviously bull markets will go the other way. But like, for example, tether depegging usually is a market bottom, relatively. That's with like perpetual funding rate going negative for bitcoin as well. So with two SEC lawsuits, Blackrock coming out just after the lawsuits, what would happen if they actually came out before the lawsuits? So timing is everything. So, yeah, not surprised. But I do see more and more similarities between binance and FTX, to be honest.
00:28:51.590 - 00:29:25.888, Speaker A: Yes. Which is also very ironic, of course, because it was CZ who originally called out FTX and Sam bank. And now we see, let's call it, what do you call it? A repeat of, well, certain scenario. I have two questions here. We could go two ways. I'll leave it up to you guys, I guess, like. Okay, so on one hand, I'm wondering what.
00:29:25.888 - 00:30:06.090, Speaker A: What, what's the, what are the chances of Coinbase? Because on it seems that they are very well prepared. It seems like they were waiting for the scenario to go down a while. They've been like gathering like, legal resources, getting all their facts straight. So I'm very curious about what you guys think about their chances in court, and I'm also. But maybe we can save that a little bit for later. Like, I'm very curious about how the unpacking of tether ties into all of this. Anyone cares to respond to either of these two questions?
00:30:08.990 - 00:30:39.830, Speaker B: I can take the first question. Helix, I hope you can hear me. Well, I think Coinbase of course, my, my. Whatever I'm going to say only represents my opinion and no financial advice. But I think that Coinbase is pretty much a big key player and we admire their efforts to reach regulatory clarity. Obviously, they have a stake in that. I think they are.
00:30:39.830 - 00:31:43.670, Speaker B: The way they're handling it is sort of like buying time until the bookcase is when Congress steps in the. With a bill that would standardize crypto regulation and clear the noise in the FUD. So I think this is. That's how I see Coinbase's position. I can't say if it's going to pay off or not, but I feel it's gonna. I think this whole thing, this whole ordeal. Yes, the reaction, the market is very panicky, but I think this will all pay out well in terms of regulatory clarity and more conversations about how crypto should be treated in the eyes of the law.
00:31:43.670 - 00:31:54.450, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. And I think we just need to closely monitor the situation and. Yeah, that's pretty much it.
00:31:55.670 - 00:32:23.370, Speaker C: Yeah. I would agree that the fact that next year is an election year is complicating factor and, you know, when you're trying to understand what the future might hold. I completely agree with that point. I think, you know, I quite like reading the tea leaves with these, with kind of litigation. And just from that perspective, I think it's very. I think it's very obvious then Coinbase won't settle. The SEC always likes settling because it gets you kind of a win.
00:32:23.370 - 00:32:59.562, Speaker C: I'm not supposed to say that because settling is not supposed to be seen as a win, but it does mean that you don't have to go to the uncertainty of a trial. I don't think Coinbase will settle here, though, because if they do, that's the end of their business, probably. So the question then becomes, do they go to a jury trial or a bench trial, which is just when the judge decides without it going to a, you know, sort of public jury. The SEC has asked for a jury trial. That doesn't necessarily mean they want one. It's just what you do to make sure that you can get one if that's what you want at some point. So it could go either way.
00:32:59.562 - 00:33:36.120, Speaker C: Mostly led against both sides, like having a bench trial for various reasons that are probably too boring to go into. But what Coinbase has had, and I think Lena kind of pointed to this, they've always had this very sort of strong. I want to use the word marketing, but it comes across as a bit cynical. I don't mean it like that. They've always had this very strong messaging around their mission. You know, they see themselves as a kind of champion for the industry. They're kind of going into the battle with the SEC not just to preserve their business and their own interests, but to create case law that will provide clarity around how digital assets are treated under securities laws.
00:33:36.120 - 00:34:02.440, Speaker C: And that kind of really strong messaging tends to be very easily communicated to a jury. So they might want to go to that kind of situation just because you get that kind of emotional and moral high ground that plays well with a jury. But to bring it back to the original point, this is probably all moot because it's 2024 next year, so it's really hard to tell. But I think it'll be really interesting to see how that plays out.
00:34:08.910 - 00:35:21.880, Speaker D: Yeah, I think the thing to watch out for over the next six to twelve months, and I doubt Congress, Congress never moves that fast. But is the recent McHenry Thompson market structure bill that was just introduced, I want to say the last week or the week prior. And obviously we're seeing a lot of international regulatory bodies start to create their own frameworks around digital assets. So you saw Micah just officially went into the EU journal, and my understanding of Mica, and hopefully somebody correct me if I'm wrong here, is that that creates like a separate regulatory body that oversees digital assets. Whereas I think the McHenry Thompson bill pretty much tries to figure out where digital assets sit in the securities or commodities discussion, depending on a variable amount of factors. But essentially it creates like a pathway. Saying like, if you, you could very well be a security today doesn't necessarily mean as a digital asset, you are security tomorrow if you meet certain criteria to become a commodity and you're sufficiently decentralized, I think, I'm not a legal expert, but a lot of legal experts I follow on crypto Twitter that are reading these types of case laws and reading these types of bills day in and day out, they sound cautiously optimistic about at least the initial draft of the McHenry Thompson bill.
00:35:21.880 - 00:36:24.140, Speaker D: It sounds like it gives small wins to the SEC, gives small wins to CFTC, and ultimately creates good consumer protections while also allowing digital assets and crypto in general to flourish in America in this kind of safe sandbox. I don't think crypto is probably not the top of the priority list for Congress and the us government as a whole. But I do think that the United States is going to get it right in crypto. Regards to crypto, probably sometime next year with the being an election year, obviously, again, there is a, you're going to see a lot of other priorities make, make its way to Congress with it being an election year, because they got to prove to american people that they're doing things that actually matter to them. And majority of people really don't think crypto is at the forefront of their minds. But I do think you're going to see some type of positive regulation movement sooner rather than later. Especially, you know, it was predominantly on the republican side saying that we need a positive framework.
00:36:24.140 - 00:37:41.642, Speaker D: But you did start to see some House Democrats and predominantly, I think, Richie Torres out of New York, who's a Dem, on the House floor, he wrote this relatively scathing op ed, I think, about, I guess, how the SEC, under Gensler's watch, has kind of overstepped the regulatory purview and ultimately saying that we do need some type of sensible framework in, in the United States for digital assets. So I think you're starting to see momentum, and I think especially recently with the SEC telling the court related to Coinbase's lawsuit against the SEC, saying that they were supposed to respond with some type of, I guess, basic understanding of what assets are securities and which aren't. And the SEC pretty much responded saying, we're not going to tell you, and pretty much told the courts, you have to trust us. And Coinbase really has no, like to stand on pretty much demanding a black and white, I guess, rulebook as to what, what assets are deemed securities and what aren't. But I think the SEC is kind of going down this, like, belligerent path where they're not listening to anyone. They're obviously doing regulation by enforcement. And this is really not a way to, I guess, treat this, this growing industry.
00:37:41.642 - 00:37:54.880, Speaker D: So again, I'm cautiously optimistic you're going to see some good movement in the next six to twelve months. But to Terry one's point, I think being an election year next year does kind of muddy the waters a little bit.
00:38:09.590 - 00:38:49.806, Speaker E: I guess I can jump in there. I wouldn't speak much to the policy and regulation side, but just kind of like from my own point of view, I find it hard to imagine that crypto would be that much of a voter issue in the states. So I think there's probably bigger things. And I guess the kind of argument that the SEC is being quite belligerent with how it's approaching this. I mean, they've said that most things are securities and that there's a path to registration. We don't know how those conversations have gone, but surely, I think from the Coinbase point of view, they've registered. They said these 13 tokens are securities and they've registered.
00:38:49.806 - 00:39:13.820, Speaker E: Coinbase offers near like 200 different cryptos or so. I mean, if you're not sure the head of register and you don't know what is or isn't the security, you don't have to go on and offer 200 of them. So there's also this like that. It kind of makes me wonder, but that's all I really have to offer on that. Not much else. On the policy side.
00:39:39.530 - 00:39:56.090, Speaker A: We don't want to be unregulated, but we kind of want to know what's up. And the SEC is not given into that, which is very weird to a lot of people. Joanna, I saw you on mute for a second.
00:39:57.430 - 00:40:31.436, Speaker C: Yeah. I didn't want to jump in in case anyone else wanted to speak, but I did want to kind of underline the point made, which is I used to speak to a lot of ATS, which is a kind of a kind of small mini exchange that operates in the US, but tradfi, not crypto. And they had to go through this registration process and they complained about how hot it was all the time. And once you've gone through the registration process and you're disclosing, that's even worse. It's extremely expensive. It's very burdensome. A disclosure doesn't sound like a big deal, but it is.
00:40:31.436 - 00:40:58.120, Speaker C: Just logistically, you need an entire person to do it every year. I mean, every month. Sorry, depending on the kind of cadence of your reporting. But one thing that no one in tradfi ever does is they don't offer the product and then wait for approval. They wait for the approval first and then they start offering the product. So I think that point that Coinbase makes, you can't poke holes in it from their perspective. And.
00:40:58.120 - 00:41:01.220, Speaker C: Yeah, I thought that was a good point made by the previous speaker.
00:41:04.200 - 00:41:53.040, Speaker D: Yeah, I think the problem is, though, that maybe somebody correct me if I'm wrong. I think Coinbase actually has requested a license to become an exchange that offers securities. Digital assets are not, and the SEC has refused to approve that license for over a year. And if they won't approve, like, let's say, let's just make the assumption that everything's a security, if everything in the crypto security, Coinbase has a stale license that they're waiting to get approved from the SEC to actually offer crypto securities because they've even sent themselves. Some assets are securities, some aren't. And obviously that's Coinbase is like specific view, but if the SEC won't even let Coinbase become a registered securities exchange then. But at the same time, they're claiming everything in crypto is a security.
00:41:53.040 - 00:42:31.630, Speaker D: Wouldn't the SEC, if they were acting in good faith, wouldn't they at least let Coinbeast become a registered securities exchange and then at the very least say, like, all right, well, now everything's a crypto security. Obviously, each individual product team is going to have to register with the SEC and provide the proper disclosures. But if I feel like it's kind of like a chicken and egg problem, like, if Coinbase is offering unregistered securities, that's one thing. But if Coinbase at the same time is at least looking for a path to become a registered security exchange, and the SEC has not given them that opportunity, then I feel like then the SEC is really not operating in good faith at the same time.
00:42:32.730 - 00:42:54.270, Speaker C: Yeah, I think we're just encapsulating the debate that's going to play out in the courts. I think this is exactly what it'll come down to. Maybe it's dangerous to make this kind of prediction, but you can see that these are the battle lines that are being drawn for sure. Certainly also a great point.
00:42:59.580 - 00:43:38.680, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess none of us are making predictions, but it is definitely interesting to, let's call it, going through the possible scenarios. Right. One other thing I would like to touch on, moving towards the. A bit of the end of this space is much more recent event. By that, I mean the tether dpeg. It's always a bit alarming when a stable coin starts deep, so. And I think it was Clara who mentioned that it's also related to the event.
00:43:38.680 - 00:43:51.320, Speaker A: Well, the topics we're talking about today, I would like to know how, if that's the case, and also if we should really worry.
00:43:53.580 - 00:44:27.000, Speaker G: To clarify that it's not actually related to the binance sec stuff. The tether DPEG seems to have been a coordinated depeing attempt by sort of an unknown entity. Tether actually, just a second ago, published, published a press release claiming that today someone tried to depeg Tethere on centralized and decentralized markets. So it's unrelated. It just happens to be, like, part of the news this week. Same with the CRV lending issues, along with the binance and Coinbase stuff.
00:44:29.580 - 00:44:40.912, Speaker A: Gotcha. Thanks for clearing that up. Okay, I misunderstood. Nonetheless, it seems like crypto is. Is in troubled waters these last few weeks.
00:44:40.996 - 00:44:41.264, Speaker D: Lot.
00:44:41.312 - 00:45:21.130, Speaker A: Lots of things going on. I also understood that Hong Kong is opening up its business to crypto. I believe they have encouraged some banks to start doing business with crypto exchanges. Something along those lines. Does anyone here know any more about that? Because I find it curious that right at the time that things are getting more complicated in us, we do hear positive sounds from EU and Asia.
00:45:27.470 - 00:46:10.808, Speaker B: Yeah, I can take that away, if I understood your question correctly. Helix. Yeah. There has been moving east. Hong Kong is opening up to crypto. And actually one of the regulators, or. Yeah, one of the regulators took, went on Twitter after the Coinbase lawsuit and he explicitly said invited Coinbase and other global digital asset providers to come to Hong Kong and leverage the growing appetite for crypto.
00:46:10.808 - 00:47:07.782, Speaker B: So this is generally good news for the industry. It's good news for the greater cause of crypto. The reason why I personally worked in crypto is because, or believe in crypto is I believe in the narrative of non state money. I don't think countries should own our money. And adoption anywhere is good for crypto, especially Hong Kong as a hub that closely works with the UK, especially now that we're seeing that they are attracting foreign investments through crypto, through tokenized security, especially with. We just saw a few days ago that they just collaborated with UBS to do so with bank of China Investment bank. So.
00:47:07.782 - 00:47:50.350, Speaker B: And we've also seen Singapore give a license to circle for also cross border operations. This is all good news. And this all indicates that the SEC lawsuit is just one straw. And I can't remember the proverb, but you know what I mean. So I'm not downplaying the SEC's lawsuits, of course. It's a nightmare. But what I'm trying to say is just to focus on the bigger picture and on the fundamentals and, yeah, good vibes.
00:47:50.350 - 00:47:51.330, Speaker B: Good vibes only.
00:47:54.310 - 00:48:43.704, Speaker A: I think that's a great message because, yeah, the markets are down, everybody there is definitely, like, this sense of doom and pessimism going on right now. You see the lot on crypto Twitter. Like, the markets are really bad. So I think that's a great message to focus on the. On the larger picture, on the bigger picture here and also to, you know, keep in mind the whole reason a lot of us probably got interested in crypto in the first place, like this potential for non stake money, for example. You know, really having ownership over your finances. It's important to remember these things in times like these.
00:48:43.704 - 00:49:11.110, Speaker A: I think I, um. Before we close it out, I think my last question would be to everyone here. Um, just like in general, like in. In summary, I guess, how do you think it will play out again? Obviously, we can't make predictions, but are you generally positive, or are you a bit worried?
00:49:11.150 - 00:50:05.526, Speaker D: I I'm positive. I mean, I'm based in the United States. Obviously, I'm not happy with how things have unfolded here, but I think at the same time, the United States is battening down on crypto. You're seeing, like we've already discussed, we're seeing international expansion. You're seeing western and Middle eastern nations, and obviously Hong Kong as well, kind of take, embrace crypto with open arms. I think. I ultimately think the United States is going to get it right, and I think that this international competition for crypto talent is, if anything, going to light a fire under the United States government's ass to try to maintain, become and maintain competition and be the leader in this space like they have historically.
00:50:05.526 - 00:50:47.132, Speaker D: Historically and other areas, predominantly web two tech. Obviously, it's not a great time to be in crypto, but I also think at the same time, it's probably, if you can survive this, I also think it's arguably the best time to be in crypto. It really, it's double edged sword, but I think at the end of the day, for most of us that are in this industry, we believe in decentralized ownership, we believe in open financial systems. We think that it's inevitable that you should be able to track the maybe financials of a business or a decentralized entity. 24 7365. The future is not quarterly reported in quarterly financial statements. Like, we have information at the touch of our fingertips.
00:50:47.132 - 00:51:11.580, Speaker D: And crypto, ultimately, I think, is the next iteration of this. And I don't think the pandora's box is already opened in terms of crypto and open financial systems. I think ultimately the world is going to embrace it, and hopefully the United States is part of that story. But if not, I look forward to seeing innovation and development in other nations as well.
00:51:17.720 - 00:51:21.900, Speaker A: Love it. Positive spirit. Clara, your closing sentiment.
00:51:23.560 - 00:51:40.510, Speaker G: Yeah, I mean, it definitely like dark times in the US right now for crypto, but I think there's definitely a lot of opportunity in the EU and AIPAC. So I would say my positive outlook is looking at other regions and a less us focused crypto environment.
00:51:42.890 - 00:52:06.040, Speaker E: Yeah. Just to piggyback on what Claire said, I'd agree. I think we can start looking beyond the US, maybe, and it should be kind of transcend nations anyway. So if crypto is going to be truly uptake with crypto, it should be global and not just singular to the focus on the US. Single point of failure.
00:52:14.100 - 00:52:17.880, Speaker A: Great points. Let's keep a wide perspective. Joanna?
00:52:19.340 - 00:53:19.910, Speaker C: Yeah, I think this might not go down well with everyone, but I think if crypto wants kind of big inflows, it's going to have to get institutional buy in. So big banks, for instance, that's not necessarily a positive for everybody. Agreed. But I think that is going to be something of the trajectory, at least for some of the industry. I think there are banks and big asset managers and so on, looking at Defi tech, for instance, and I think what you're going to see is the merging of the two worlds, at least to a degree. And what we're going through right now is almost like the sort of teething problems of a fairly young industry that will get more and more, what's the word? Kind of authorized, I guess, and kind of absorbed into normal life by.
00:53:22.250 - 00:53:22.538, Speaker D: A.
00:53:22.554 - 00:53:40.870, Speaker C: Wider investing public as it gets adopted more and more in institutions. I know, as I say, I think that's not something that everyone wants to hear, but I think that is a trajectory, and it might just end up being the thing that saves it in some ways. So I guess that's positive. But I guess for some people, maybe not.
00:53:48.490 - 00:54:34.500, Speaker A: Everybody ultimately wants to see a wider adoption of our industry. So at least that is something we can all get behind. Lena, your closing sentiment. I'm not sure if Lina is still with us, or at least she's not unmuted. If you still want to share your closing sentiment, please speak up now, otherwise I'll have to move on with closing out the space. Um, yeah, very interesting. I think we learned a lot today.
00:54:34.500 - 00:54:42.180, Speaker A: Uh, yeah, I'm not going to summarize everything, obviously. Clara, did you want to share something?
00:54:45.880 - 00:54:47.020, Speaker G: Oh, no, sorry.
00:54:49.040 - 00:55:18.106, Speaker A: All good. All good, yeah. So I want to thank everyone for being here, the audience, also the speakers. Very interesting talk. Again, you know, regulation can sometimes be a bit dry, but definitely the last two weeks are, you know, proof of the contrary, I think lots of fireworks. It's shaken the markets. It's quite a bit.
00:55:18.106 - 00:55:58.326, Speaker A: It. It'll be interesting times. Very important time for. Especially for Coinbase, but also for finance and definitely for the industry as a whole. Yeah, let's just stay up to date on developments. And before we close it out, I want to give everyone, all the speakers. By that, I mean opportunity to tell the audience where to find their work, where best to follow them, maybe sign up to newsletters that they work on, stuff like that.
00:55:58.326 - 00:56:03.370, Speaker A: So, with that, please take it away. Clara, maybe feel free to start.
00:56:07.110 - 00:56:13.810, Speaker G: You can go to kaiko.com and then click research, and you will find all of our newsletters there.
00:56:23.070 - 00:56:49.256, Speaker B: I have some trouble connecting or like hearing Helix right now, like right before. And also, Joanna, I didn't hear you speak at all. Just saying. So I'm assuming now that we're just saying where you can find our publications. So I feel like a deaf person now. So 21 shares.com insights I hope I didn't.
00:56:49.256 - 00:56:55.300, Speaker B: I'm not speaking over anyone. Yeah, the Internet is weird. Okay.
00:57:01.720 - 00:57:29.200, Speaker D: I'll go next. Yeah, you can find, obviously you can follow me. You can follow Blockworks research on Twitter. Also blockworksresearch.com. so we do institutional grade research, writing about the long tail assets as well as more traditional crypto assets like bitcoin and ethereum. Obviously you can also go on blockworks co to look at our journalist side of the business. Just thanks for having me having of us.
00:57:43.060 - 00:58:00.990, Speaker E: Yeah, I can jump in, I guess. You can follow Joanna and I at dlnews info on Twitter or by the website. Joanna has a newsletter, I believe, coming up on regulations. You probably tell you a little bit more about that, but definitely want to subscribe to when it's, when it's got, when it gets going.
00:58:02.730 - 00:58:20.394, Speaker C: Yeah. That is forthcoming. It's going to be called the guidance. We haven't launched it yet, so watch this space. We are dlnews.com. we have a very talented team. It's not just us, there's a big defi team as well and a couple of other correspondents.
00:58:20.394 - 00:58:28.270, Speaker C: And we do great stories. I think so, yeah. Give us a follow and check us out and thank you for having us again.
00:58:34.210 - 00:59:14.566, Speaker A: Thank you.
