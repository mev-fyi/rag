00:00:11.720 - 00:00:34.756, Speaker A: Awesome. Yeah, thanks. Hey, thanks for having me. My name is Tom. Excited to be here. I'm from 21 shares, so 21 shares is one of the largest ETP issuer for crypto. We have a lot of different products and we have currently 1 billion asset under management and the work I did for the sticking and Ethereum propeller upgrade is at Dune dashboard.
00:00:34.756 - 00:00:53.530, Speaker A: I worked with Kareem, which is our research associate, and another dashboard on flip side which mainly focused on beacon chain data. And I will pass it to another analyst and pleasure to be with all the starting lineup, like all star lineup here. So here you go.
00:00:54.990 - 00:01:21.314, Speaker B: Thanks. As the other Tom in the chat, I'll go next. So Tom Dunleavy, former Masari, now on my own. Just analyzing and continuing to look at the space here, working with a few firms part time. Something coming soon on my end. More full time so soon TM. But yeah, looking at continuing to look at all of the Ethereum data.
00:01:21.314 - 00:01:35.550, Speaker B: More of a commenter and analyzer rather than in the weeds guy like Thomas. So a lot of interesting data I think we've seen since the beacon change has sort of had these withdrawals. So happy to talk about a lot of the interesting stuff we've seen at.
00:01:39.770 - 00:02:02.398, Speaker C: Sure. I mean, I'll go next. As you know, I mean, Tom is an old friend. Tom Dunleavy, that is. Yeah. I'm a research analyst at Missouri, you know, sort of covering staking for a while now. I was excited about Lido in Q two of last year and like Rocket Pool Q three of last year.
00:02:02.398 - 00:02:20.990, Speaker C: Now I just mostly go through Hildebe's Dune dashboard, which really just gives like excellent information of like, you know, withdrawals and everything that's happened since shapela. So, yeah, that's my background.
00:02:23.170 - 00:02:51.330, Speaker D: Hey, I'll go next. I'm Oscar and I work with Nansen in research, and some things I've done relevant to this topic is a deep dive into what's going on before the merge, then a piece going on anticipating what will happen with Shanghai, and our team has also published some extensive post Shanghai dashboards as well. Great to be here as well.
00:02:56.670 - 00:03:16.140, Speaker E: Hey, guys, I'm Riyadh Carey, research analyst at Keiko Data. We're a crypto market data provider covering over 100 centralized, decentralized exchanges. So looking forward to this conversation. Thanks Helix, for setting this up.
00:03:26.880 - 00:04:04.106, Speaker F: I guess I'm next. Hey, everybody, I'm Elias. I'm co founder and CEO at Rated. I've been working in the infrastructure space since about 2020, been following the beacon chain since the medalla testnet and at rated we are basically building the most complete 360 view of the network. And we deal in what we call machine reputation. And we're starting from Ethereum validators and in that context, reputation is performance risk and externalities. So happy to be here.
00:04:04.106 - 00:04:09.400, Speaker F: Happy to talk about. About withdrawals and all the cool stuff and events around it.
00:04:12.220 - 00:04:44.550, Speaker G: Hey guys, I'm Hill Dobby. I worked at Geico a bit before. I also was freelancing a bit for some data in June. And then eventually since a year ago I joined Dragonfly. And I think about a year and a half ago I thought there was little information like the all the whole staking system. So I think the only thing I could find was Elias's amazing dashboard on liquid staking. And I think it's great.
00:04:44.550 - 00:05:14.110, Speaker G: It's one of the biggest component of it. But I think I wanted a bigger picture. So I just built a dashboard there, had a grant from estaker at the time through quadratic funding. And I just kind of swore to myself to maintain that dashboard for a while and get it as good as possible given the data I have on hand. And. Yeah, and I also like got the entire underlying data that I use. I put it into spellbook so that everyone else can easily leverage it.
00:05:18.970 - 00:06:10.556, Speaker H: Awesome. Thanks for those introductions, guys. Pretty stacked panel again. Also means we don't have a lot of time and I want to get a to everyone's research. I think it's good if we start because the challenge here is all of y'all did research on different things here. So I think the best approach to take is if we take just a high level few and everyone just shares like, let's say the top observation that they had. And by top observation, I mean like the thing that surprised you most or maybe something that confirmed like a very deep belief that you already had about this whole situation, things like that.
00:06:10.708 - 00:06:45.256, Speaker F: I could start, yeah. I have a slightly contrarian view around withdrawals and that they would be a non event. And I think the sort of data that's rolling through is that it has been a non event in terms of what's happening with staking. Right. And non event is kind of like a punchy, sensational title. What I really mean by that is that every network that runs on proof of stake, you can stake, but then you can unstake and you can claim your stake back. Right.
00:06:45.256 - 00:08:05.698, Speaker F: So the beacon chain is a little bit special in that it ran for two years and it was Hotel California. You can check in but you can of never check out until Chappelle and really it's like the network coming into its own and completing the circle and becoming a fully fledged network in terms of proof of stake, where you can stake and then you can unstake. So in that frame of reference, just adding that final piece just makes the network whole. And it's not a huge thing. Um, the leading indicators up to withdrawals in terms of kind of all the uh, the pegs on, on liquid staking derivatives, which you know, if you did see like a massive sort of uh, rush through the exit sentiment, that would materialize in people just selling those derivatives and then these, or liquid staking tokens, rather, not derivatives, and they would lose the peg. But that happened months before, sort of the lead up to withdrawals, and it was not related to that sentiment, right? It wasn't, everything was really sort of breaking apart. And the whole industry went through a major credit and liquidity crunch, FTx and all the likes, and then the pegs were restored.
00:08:05.698 - 00:09:02.448, Speaker F: So that was like a pretty strong leading indicator to me, from a performance standpoint. The network struggled a little bit as operators sort of upgraded their nodes and all that. We did see kind of the highest drop in effectiveness that we've ever seen during an upgrade, but then bounced back within days pretty quickly. And in terms of how the flows panned out, it was really like a cleansing moment. It was really the big entities that kind of withdrew where entities that were in some sort of distress. So Kraken, for example, was sort of the poster boy with all the SEC stuff that transpired. And then they weren't allowed to basically operate the staking operation in the US.
00:09:02.448 - 00:09:53.664, Speaker F: So a lot of withdrawals came through Kraken. And then I think it was like the other two main ones where Huobi, which is also, there's a lot of sort of news around Huobi not being in a, in a great state. And then cream finance is like a, you know, the project I think was deprecated many, many quarters ago. And then their stake is just, I think, in transition and folding into manifold's new, new product. And besides that, nothing else really. Right. And we're currently in a state where the activation queue is like twelve days long, and the withdrawal queue is only seven days long, which means that demand for real estate on the beacon chain is actually increasing again.
00:09:53.664 - 00:10:29.510, Speaker F: Right. Effectively having sort of de risked the whole staking thing, which is the only risk that existed. Washington. Well, if I commit into staking and then I change my mind or something happens, will I ever actually be able to reclaim the money that I've pledged to provide security in the network. And with that out of the picture, it's only like up, I think for staking on Ethereum at least and the leading indicators at least like short few weeks after. So pell are pointing in that direction.
00:10:33.490 - 00:11:23.290, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that was a great summary. I think up and above the detail that was just shared there. The thing that's been most interesting to me is just looking at where the stake subsequent to the event has been going. So you've seen a lot of institutional staking providers come on board, which I think it was the de risking event we all sort of thought it would be. You've also seen Lido, rocket pool and a lot of the other liquid staking tokens have strong inflows. So the interest is there and the decentralization will continue to play out as these folks get more and more tokens. But that's been the most encouraging sign to me is that where the stake is going and who the folks are who are actually redistributing money back into the ecosystem.
00:11:26.710 - 00:11:27.046, Speaker F: Right.
00:11:27.078 - 00:12:25.544, Speaker A: I totally agree what Tom said. We've seen huge institutional staking providers and afterwards we've seen highest weekly inflow in terms of deposits on Mainnet. And here would like to give a huge shout out to Hiltabi for his amazing entities tagging. If not, we won't have a clear picture on how to map those entities with those addresses. So really amazing work so that we can have full visual on who is depositing, who is withdrawing. And in the meantime, I think it's also interesting that Elias mentioned a lot of the distressed entities are withdrawing, right? We have seen that 80% of the full withdrawals are actually coming from centralized exchanges like Kraken, obviously due to regulatory crackdown. But in the meantime, I think after the FTX and the implosion of centralized entities like blockfi Celsius, these entities scared a lot of investors.
00:12:25.544 - 00:13:46.970, Speaker A: So liquid staking or decentralized staking solutions, definitely an alternative, a good one for them to hold their own staked solutions or staked eth in their custody wallet. So it's definitely a good sign for decentralizing the network as well. And in the meantime, I find it really interesting findings I would like to share. So one day right after the Shanghai upgrade, I found that one of the first fellow leaders who withdrew Ethereum, he actually swapped directly on decentralized exchange, swapped the withdrew to Ethereum to rocket pool and then attacked him on Twitter and asked, oh, why are you selling your ethereum? So he is kind of like the first person I seen on chain selling their ethereum on decentralized exchanges. And his answer is actually he told me that he's switching from a sticking a centralized staking solution to a rocket pool. So he's going to operate his own rocket pool node via swapping Ethereum to RpL so that he can use it as collateral. So shuffling is definitely going to be a trend in the future from centralized exchanges towards decentralized staking solutions like rocket pool and lido.
00:13:51.950 - 00:14:44.944, Speaker C: Yeah, and this is something that I've been thinking about. I always thought that this will be a big de risking event and essentially I think now staking through liquid staking providers, the risk is near zero. Of course there's some smart contract risk and there is some, perhaps some counterparty risk, but liquidity risk is near zero. And execution risk on the part of the Ethereum developers, that's also gone to zero. We've been fairly lucky. The work has been great. The last few upgrades that there haven't been any hiccups at all, but there was some execution risk, at least before Shapella shipped.
00:14:44.944 - 00:15:40.550, Speaker C: So I do expect that Lido, rocket pool and all the others like fracs, whoever's doing liquid staking through a decentralized method will benefit. But I was a little surprised by how slow the growth has been. I know Lido hasn't approved validator hasn't approved withdrawals yet, but I was still like a little surprised that net inflows for all of these, all of these decentralized liquid staking providers has been fairly low. And as Tom said, Tom Dunleavy said, it's largely the institutional staking providers that have seen large net inflows. So that was something that was a little surprising for me.
00:15:44.010 - 00:15:44.950, Speaker D: I think.
00:15:45.530 - 00:15:46.550, Speaker G: Sorry, go ahead.
00:15:46.890 - 00:16:06.926, Speaker D: Oh yeah, sorry. Yeah. So for me, Shanghai slightly surprised me. I thought there'd be a little bit more selling pressure. Interestingly, for me, the principle of stake deets has actually never been higher. At Shanghai it was 19.3, now it's 19.1
00:16:06.926 - 00:16:42.718, Speaker D: million. But that includes all the rewards that had accrued before Shanghai. So the principle of east has never been higher. And the withdrawal behavior has been very interesting as well. Pretty much 80% of the principal withdrawals have been sent to sex, which would normally imply selling. But it's actually the sexes that are withdrawing. Most of it, like Kraken, has contributed to 30% of all ETh withdrawals since the upgrade.
00:16:42.718 - 00:17:26.540, Speaker D: And then that's followed by binance and Coinbase, Lido and Hurrobi so this is actually just generally sex is returning the funds to themselves, most of which will actually not be sold. So in total I think around 250k additional ETH has now hit the market. But most of it hasn't been sold. So I mean like I think that's very bullish. We're arguably in a bear market, but a lot of people still believe that Ethereum is the only and main game in town. So yeah I've been slightly surprised by, I don't know, quite overwhelmingly positive reaction and behavior following Shanghai.
00:17:31.320 - 00:18:18.346, Speaker G: Yeah I think as everyone touched on it's pretty much mostly a non event other than central exchanges withdrawing. And I think since Schappella they like, if you, if you can call it market share, central exchanges like went from like 28% to now about 23%. And this is by the way looking without the queue. So I'm solely looking at data that is inflows and outflows from the, from, from mainnet from the beginning chain. So of course the queues play a little role but it's mostly like a slight delay to the data that is applied. So nothing really significant I would say. But yeah, and these funds are for the most part what we're seeing is people are restaking them.
00:18:18.346 - 00:19:14.230, Speaker G: And actually ever since Schabella like the past four weeks I think has it been four weeks or something? They are like the highest in terms of staking almost ever in terms of estates, which I think is pretty impressive. And it's just showcases that people have gotten more confidence and it has been a de risking event where people now know that they can actually withdraw their ETH and just brought more confidence into the protocol. I'll also be curious to see how lido users react when withdrawals are enabled there. I think that is the next thing I'm really curious about. But yeah otherwise pretty smooth, pretty smooth event and yeah pretty, pretty cool to witness this whole, this whole upgrade thing.
00:19:16.690 - 00:20:07.114, Speaker C: You know I have a, I was looking at this data and obviously Kraken you know, has those SEC, has that SEC settlement after which it's not allowed to do sticking operations in the US. But why has there been such huge outflows from Coinbase and Binance? I havent really found a good explanation for myself why Binance is. I dont think its the binance US entity and im not sure why there has been such large amount of staking. Do you think some of it is flowing to liquid staking protocols or you have that chart with stakers and profit and losses? Do you think its something to do with that, is there a good explanation for why people are withdrawing from Coinbase and Binance?
00:20:07.242 - 00:21:26.766, Speaker F: I think there's a non obvious explanation to that, and that's sort of we're all looking at the current best spot view and looking backwards, and there's things like, so the tags database or databases mapping validator ids to entities that operate them, or that the stake belongs to and so on. So at the moment, we are looking at a lot of coinbase outflows and a lot of binance outflows, because partly all of the dashboards and work that exists out there, indexes on validators that have been identified already as part of Coinbase or as part of finance and so on. But these large entities have complex deploying structures. Right. And the spot view of the database always lacks what the actual view is. So, you know, in the last 30 days, I'm looking at, you know, 55% of validators that have onboarded are from entities that have been unidentified. And my bet is that actually, like, a fair amount of those could be Coinbase and potentially binance, right? Maybe binance not so much, but definitely coinbase.
00:21:26.766 - 00:21:49.770, Speaker F: So there's, on a net basis, Coinbase is like 3% down, but like only from the slice that has been identified. So there's like an interesting tidbit to consider there kind of, before you, you arrive in any sort of final conclusion as to whether it's, you know, net down or net up.
00:21:51.830 - 00:22:29.694, Speaker G: Yeah, I agree, definitely. Like, it's. The data is skewed towards what we've identified, so it's easy to point fingers to the bigger entities. I think there's several things at play here. One of the things is what I'm seeing is most of those withdrawing are from earlier stakers. You can see the validator indexes are mostly from stakers from back in the 2021 days. And the space was a little different where centralized exchange were probably a much better deal.
00:22:29.694 - 00:23:14.666, Speaker G: I don't know if that makes sense in terms of staking returns and everything. The longer you've been, maybe those people have been waiting on to withdraw this eTh. There's also a lot of, like you said, new people staking and staking that are unidentified, which is, which is a big problem. And I'm like trying to work through those, but most of them can't really be identified. And there's actually some validators I found I need to label those that, for example, belong to Coinbase and are withdrawing, but aren't tagged anywhere. You can see through other stuff. I'll share this eventually, but there's a lot of central exchange.
00:23:14.666 - 00:24:10.900, Speaker G: It's, of course, what we've identified from what identified it is that the central exchange are losing market share towards independent stakers, I think a lot, hopefully. It's always hard to say whether that is a definitive thing or not because. Unidentified you can't really say if it is actually an independent staker, but it is largely a positive thing, I would say. But yeah, there's always this thing where we'll be lagging in terms of who have we identified? What does that tell us? So we can really look back, but we can't really say necessarily, like, what are these new stakers doing? Who are they? P two p, for example, just recently popped up and staked 100,000 ETH, and this is a recent new one, technically. So, yeah, it's always try to be on the lookout to identify new entities.
00:24:18.330 - 00:24:57.330, Speaker F: There's also possibly an important distinction to make, you know, in terms of how you slice the network. Right. There's, you know, the custody layer, which is, I guess, the pools that aggregate capital and then deploy it into operators. And this could be decentralized pools like Lido, for example, or rocket pool, or it could be like, I mean, centralized exchanges are pools of capital. They just operate in different ways. And a lot of their surface is not on chain, it's rather off chain, but in sort of the master highest level archetypical structure. They look very much the same and very similar.
00:24:57.330 - 00:26:23.748, Speaker F: And the function that they sort of serve in the ecosystem is actually quite segregated and different from someone like Peter P, for example, who is place that operates nodes and potentially like runs capital for, on behalf of others. And in fact, you know, p two p exists in the lido set, might or might not work with centralized exchanges. And so, you know, maybe some of the capital that you see sort of maps back to p two p can also map back to an exchange, right, that they, that they work with. So largely, these exchanges don't run validators themselves. Some have staking arms through acquisitions that they did over the last couple of years or they developed some in house. But they do operate similarly to the lidos of the world in terms of distributing the stake to multiple providers, to have redundancy, to have appropriate risk management and so on, because, you know, the last thing that they want is being in dire straits because, you know, some sort of mismanagement took place in the operation layer. But it's, it's an important distinction to make because the operator doesn't necessarily have in terms of the flows of ETH doesn't necessarily have the same agency that a pool might have, right? The pool is like much closer to touching the asset.
00:26:23.748 - 00:26:54.420, Speaker F: The ETH, rather than the operator, who's like, you know, might even be completely abstracted from actually running the capital because the withdrawal deposit keys might sit somewhere else than the operating key. And then with things like DVT coming down the pipe, this is going to become increasingly more commonplace, segregating sort of the who owns and has access to the capital that powers the proof of stake and the operation layer of proof stake.
00:27:02.020 - 00:27:51.280, Speaker B: Shifting gears a bit, I'd be interested to hear the panel's thoughts on where they think the terminal staked rate for Ethereum is. So we're at 15% or so. Obviously, we all know other networks are much, much higher. Do we think it's 30%, 40% or much higher than that? My own personal view is 30% to 40% feels right. As sort of more stakers come in, the reward structure diminishes and sort of naturally limits the need for the actual impetus for more stakers to come in. Also, you obviously need naked ETH to sort of pay gas prices and do other things. So I guess where does the panel feel sort of that levels off long term? And does it approach any of those other larger or those other major networks?
00:27:53.780 - 00:28:23.872, Speaker A: I think in the long run there are several pieces of the sticking reward. First one is definitely the issuance, which is in the consensus layer in Dune. I recently saw that data always. He shared a really cool calculation, which you can estimate the issuance in the beacon chain based on the number of validators. So check that out. Right now it's around 3.8% apr.
00:28:23.872 - 00:29:11.036, Speaker A: And then you also have the math rewards, right, and the priority fees. So in terms of the issuance, if we expect the number of validators will grow in the long run, given that institution investors, more retail investors, are more comfortable with staking due to the de risking events. So the issuance on the consensus layer per validators would definitely decrease. And right now we're looking at the priority fees and map rewards. So in a really long time frame, in my point of view, given that we have like Ethereum has a L2 roadmap, right? So a lot of the execution will actually move to L2. So potentially the priority fees will also decrease. So as the math rewards potentially.
00:29:11.036 - 00:29:19.090, Speaker A: So in the long run, instead of increasing, I believe it would be more on the decreasing side. What do you guys think?
00:29:21.510 - 00:31:00.080, Speaker C: Yeah, I just want to cite data always. Again, he had an excellent report recently where he spoke about the impact of external yield on the game theoretical fair point in each state and his conclusion, I'm just remembering off the top of my head, was that even a half to 1% increase through things like restaking with Eigen layer will push out the amount of ETH staked to close to 100%. Obviously you will always need some to transact on the network, but essentially the game theoretical number becomes tenths towards 100%. And I personally do believe that holding staked versions like liquid staked versions of ETH would just become the norm, and even more so if there is greater adoption of L2s. Because on L2s you can have pretty much any token as the fee token, and they can just swap, swap and pay the fees on the layer one through ETh. So I expect the number to be very large in its end state will be more than 50%, but it won't be immediate, obviously. There are obviously limitations on how much it can grow by, and this won't really happen overnight either.
00:31:02.430 - 00:32:05.652, Speaker G: I have a slightly contradictory point of view where first off, I also agree that data always that article is really good and recommend everyone reads it. I think it's a really good new point of view that no one is really looking at much, but I think that a major difference as well with other chain is that just ETH is useful. There's stuff to be done with ETH, and it's not just this whole assumption of we eventually end up with most of it being staked is that we assume that all there is is ETH and a higher yield on staked ETH. But there is actually the whole defi ecosystem where there might be better strategies, there's better stuff to be done maybe with ETH, if you're good at optimizing it. There's just a lot more that your eth can be used for. And also, I don't know if everyone is comfortable necessarily. Even if you can withdraw and stuff, you don't have the liquidity necessarily on hand.
00:32:05.652 - 00:32:29.940, Speaker G: You need to wait for the queue to go through and whatever. So I think liquid staking is part of the solution to this illiquidity problem, of course. But yeah, it's hard to say for sure how much to estimate the exact amount, but I don't think it would necessarily be as high as we see on other networks, actually.
00:32:30.840 - 00:32:44.460, Speaker B: Hildabi, do you think though that you could have STE or re or whatever, just be that base layer of liquidity as it sort of proliferates throughout deFi, rather than just regular ETH as the base currency.
00:32:47.040 - 00:32:48.600, Speaker G: I think. Sorry, go ahead.
00:32:48.640 - 00:33:19.040, Speaker C: Just like adding, adding a question on top of that. It doesn't have to be. There are risks to the network with too much being staked through one protocol. But it could just be an aggregator. So we're seeing unsheathed and index coops deset. I think so there are aggregators as well which would fill the role, which don't really necessarily have to, have to, you know, like the network isn't like at risk. Then.
00:33:21.500 - 00:34:25.000, Speaker E: This ties in with a point that I wanted to bring up. I've really been struck in my recent research with like how prevalent liquid staking tokens have become just in DeFi protocols. I mean, I think pretty quickly the main use case for like lending and borrowing protocols has been sort of leveraging stake tokens. But the problem with that is that they're super illiquid like especially compared to ETH. I tweeted a chart that shows like there's like 100 ETH worth of bid depth within 1% of the mid price across all centralized exchanges, which is mostly concerning. I mean as leverage for these tokens increases, you'd ideally like to see that scale up as well to avoid sort of large liquidation events, which I think is a pretty huge risk right now.
00:34:31.820 - 00:35:24.600, Speaker G: I think there's like two kind of viewpoints on here where some will try to like, the ideal utopic thing on staking is that there's a lot of solo stakers and ol are contributing to the network and securing it in a most decentralized way possible. But there's also those who want to leverage their ETH in the best way possible, use it in DeFi and everything. And as you said, there's like huge liquidity problems. I think most liquid staking assets are very liquid. Lido is probably the most liquid and available throughout protocols. And in order to get better liquidity, you need maybe some kind of main go to monopoly of liquid staking asset. That would be in terms of liquidity wise on chain would be the ideal scenario.
00:35:24.600 - 00:35:36.530, Speaker G: But then it counterbalances that other point of turnabye spread out across a lot of solo stakers. So I think that's like an interesting dynamic to kind of look at.
00:35:37.590 - 00:36:29.280, Speaker F: I think that's the answer. Therein lies the answer in terms of what's the terminal staking rate. And it largely will depend on what happens with the liquid staking markets and all these protocols. Like if one gets enshrined and is double for weth or even eth, and you can pay for fees with it, then surely it will tend to 100% because the opportunity cost would be silly. Probably not 100% because technical difficulties and all that, but very close to 100%. However, I don't know if that's actually like a plausible scenario, at least with the information that we have today. It's a sensible scenario, but there's like a very messy middle until you get to like a sensible scenario from where we are today.
00:36:29.280 - 00:38:06.564, Speaker F: And frankly, I don't really see like a very clear path, although the end state makes a lot of sense. So my view is like we end up at like a 50% or maybe even lower 40% to 50% terminal stake rate, and then the rest sort of roams freely. And on the point of solo stakers, we sort of run the numbers and we're going to publish a blog post pretty soon on it. What we found is that solo stakers represent about 7% of the whole stake mass on Ethereum, which is pretty amazing. It's not like it sounds like a small number, but if you consider that it's very likely that these people are also like a 30% or more of the actual beacon nodes that are running the chain, then it actually makes for a very strong backbone of the network. Right? Like, don't forget Ethereum, the beacon chain has been designed with like, one of the core design goals of the whole thing is to withstand a, like a world war three catastrophe scenario. And in that scenario where, you know, governments go after kind of all the actors that they can go after, well, you can't really easily shut down the one honest validator that runs on a fridge or whatnot, so the chain keeps.
00:38:06.564 - 00:38:08.040, Speaker F: Keeps chugging along.
00:38:16.070 - 00:39:19.482, Speaker D: Yeah, I'm also curious to hear what people think about, like, which, like what sort of market structure can arise from the LSD's, because, like Lido is extremely dominant at the moment. It's like 30% of all deposited Eth. It's by far the largest liquid staking token. And people talk about rocket pool a lot, but they're practically incomparable. Like, Lido is just so much larger. And yeah, I think that comes with some clear governance risk and various other risks, like the node operator set maybe not being geographically and legally distributed enough, and what sort of risks that brings. Because if, like, Lido is offering good yields compared to other things, and it's like a tragedy of the commons like situation where people will just go with Lido, even if it's not necessarily best for the network.
00:39:19.482 - 00:39:36.750, Speaker D: So curious what people think will be an end state in terms of the liquid staking tokens, like, do you think it could be a monopoly or oligopoly, or do you think it could be a better and more distributed set than that?
00:39:45.010 - 00:40:26.086, Speaker G: I think there's several things, which is that, yes, in terms of market share, the rocket ball and Lido are not necessarily on the same page, but, like, they're also very different protocols. And the bottleneck to rocket pool is mostly who wants to run those solo stakers nodes, which now I think it's like eight eth minimum to do that. And it's a much bigger bottleneck than being able to deposit any amount and have it staked through Lido. But I think. I really like, I think rocket pool. I think diversity is cool. But, like, if you look at the.
00:40:26.086 - 00:41:04.992, Speaker G: At the space and historically on Ethereum and what has happened, we have a big history of starting to rely on monopolies and people getting used to certain protocol becoming the go to standard. You can see this in almost all sectors of the space. And I hope this isn't the same that is going to happen here, especially since it's much more important to. To have it kind of diversified. And Lido does seem hard to, like, dethrone right now, but I don't think it's increasing. I need to. I don't.
00:41:04.992 - 00:41:49.510, Speaker G: I'm not brought in the data there, but it's like I'm seeing a lot of influx from other stakers as well, other than Lido. And, you know, we're still in this unknown in terms of what will happen when withdrawals happen. I think it will be mostly a non event where some will test it out. But you can already swap your Steve into Eth if you want to unstake. And the rates of Steve tells us that there isn't actually a lot of demand to unstake this SDE. But I just don't hope we reproduce this history of monopolies that we've had throughout Ethereum's history.
00:41:49.850 - 00:41:50.138, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:41:50.154 - 00:42:46.460, Speaker B: If I could just add some more color on rocket pool with hopefully not going on a rocket pool rant, as I've been want to do over the past few weeks, as I've sort of been bitten by the bug of this protocol since the Atlas upgrade, they lowered their requirement from 16 eth to create a mini pool down to eight. The corresponding other side of that transaction expands the potential supply of RET. So there's been a constraint on the amount of RET that can and would be created to date. Now, if you think about each person who creates a mini pool. The other side of that transaction creates Reth. The queue for minipools right now is sitting at 2300 people waiting to form a new minipool and the constraint is folks looking to actually deposit and mint new Reth. And I think a lot of people have been sort of hesitant to do that transaction because of how high gas fees have been.
00:42:46.460 - 00:42:53.220, Speaker B: Still, Reth has grown since that upgrade, and I think you're going to continue to see it grow as gas fees start to come down.
00:42:55.880 - 00:44:04.612, Speaker C: Yeah, I can speak a bit to the liquid staking. I mean, how I think of the liquid staking endgame perhaps. I do hold RpL lido some of these liquid staking tokens, so just want to give that out as a disclosure first. I mean, I agree with Hill Dobby's point about we've had quite a few monopolies, but I think we've also had a few oligopolies in at least the stable coins. So DAi, USD, USDC and BUSD, they've all had significant market shares and I think largely Lido share has been capped around the 30%, one to 32% mark for a year almost. So the stakers are obviously cognizant of the fact that if any validator or single entity controls 33% of the stake, they can choose to single handedly halt the network. And as such, I don't expect now expect any validator or single entity to ever have more than 33 mobile, 33% market share of staked ETH.
00:44:04.612 - 00:45:23.198, Speaker C: And I think that just then necessitates like at least, at least in Oligopoly, where there are other large players also that are vying for the remaining 67% of the shares. So that could be like one portion of that could be centralized exchanges fighting over some part of the pie and some part will always be solo stakers, Vitaly butane and himself and long term sort of eth believers who would not use any sort of decentralization, maxis who wouldn't use any other service. And I think another portion could be another liquid staking. Derivative aggregators as well help in this regard, where they manage their allocations to different, different protocols, keeping the risks in mind. So when lido share exceeds, it's not exceeds 33%, it doesn't only pose a threat to Ethereum. Even lighter stakers have a higher risk because the slashing is much larger the larger your stake is. And I think if it's about 33% it's like much more significant.
00:45:23.198 - 00:45:35.370, Speaker C: So it's like it's in everyone's interest for any single entity share to not be more than 33%. And I think it will sort of then necessitate, at least in oligopoly, maybe like even higher competition.
00:45:39.270 - 00:46:17.460, Speaker F: I have a question for the panel. Do folks have good ideas or assumptions as to say now we're at 15% of Ethan circulation is staked. I assume that we get to like something like 40 or 50%. Where does the additional 25% to 35% come from? Who are the people or entities or whatnot that actually will make up for this balance in the years to come?
00:46:19.560 - 00:46:59.138, Speaker A: I would think it would be institutional investors. So right now, a lot of areas or countries are still really bearish on crypto or not as crypto friendly as some countries like Switzerland. So our company has different crypto products. Right. But like us, still doesn't have a spot ETH or spot bitcoin ETF. But when it happens, it could definitely open up a lot of opportunities for institution investors or even retail investors. And right now, we have seen that Hong Kong is like, where I'm from is actually opening up for a lot of crypto products.
00:46:59.138 - 00:47:33.948, Speaker A: We have seen that they launch a futures bitcoin and ETH product already. And in the meantime, some Asia countries as well, they can down the line, potentially explore it. Spot bitcoin ETF. Right? So Asia has seen to be more crypto friendly than the US right now. So I believe, in my opinion, the next catalyst for more ETH stake on network could be more institutional crypto products launched in the world. I think.
00:47:33.964 - 00:47:37.600, Speaker F: I agree. Anybody else have any ideas?
00:47:42.140 - 00:48:29.776, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's just whoever holds eth, in my opinion. So Daos holds some significant parts of eth. Neo says, I believe is a big holder golem. Some of these older ones that had their icos, so I think they're quite likely to stake. I know maker has this endgame plan wherever I. It moves from, like, eth to stake teeth. So I just, I just imagine that, you know, steak teeth will just be that much more popular that whether it's individual stakers or institutions with really minimal risk, it would just be like the standard or the norm to hold steak teeth rather than vanilla naked ethan.
00:48:29.878 - 00:49:45.040, Speaker F: Yeah, that's a good point. If you put all these points, like, in a time continuum, I would wager that sort of institutional capital comes earlier than kind of liquid staking tokens becoming the standard in terms of doubling for transaction fees or whatnot, or having even deeper, almost protocol level integrations. And so if that is the assumption that we take as the truth, for the sake of the experiment, then institutional capital might elect that. The current solutions, or lido, for example, specifically, might not take their boxes in terms of the risk that they're willing to undertake. That's in the short term, one sort of interesting path forward insofar as how this ecosystem will pan out in terms of distribution. So other products that actually cater to that kind of capital that we assume will be interested will take a disproportionate amount of these new flows into staking.
00:49:46.300 - 00:49:52.850, Speaker H: Interesting. Do you think these are products already in existence or that still need to be developed?
00:49:53.990 - 00:50:52.442, Speaker F: I think there's like a lot of interesting products that are coming to market right now. So alluvial is one, etherfi is another one, swell is another, stator is another. They all kind of cater to different use cases. I would think that Etherfi and I, alluvial liquid collective, are kind of the ones that are architected in a way that is more amicable to the sort of demands and needs of more institutional, like capital. We have like a lot of new products that are coming online in terms of liquid staking. I think by the end of this quarter, there's going to be a more than ten different protocols that are deployed on Ethereum. So there's enough design sort of variability in the environment already.
00:50:52.442 - 00:51:33.010, Speaker F: So I don't think it's really new products. It then becomes a game of business development. As unsexy as that, as that might sound. It's like, okay, well, you know, this capital won't necessarily come of its own accord. It needs to be sold into the opportunity. So there's this sort of, you know, unsexy work that people will do and then, you know, whoever, whoever does it best really might have the better chance. So obviously, like side by side with a, with a great product that sort of caters to whatever the need, want sets of these, these entities might be.
00:51:33.010 - 00:51:36.750, Speaker F: And I guess, I guess we'll see, right?
00:51:36.910 - 00:52:13.700, Speaker H: Build it and they will come is not always true, unfortunately. You also need that extra piece of the puzzle and you do need both sides. So that's an interesting takeaway. I think that, you know, starting this talk and everybody agreed, it has turned out a bit of a non event. If anything, it makes the network whole. It has been bullish on decentralization. Not so good for some institutional players such as Kraken.
00:52:13.700 - 00:53:09.990, Speaker H: Yeah. But according to you, there will be very interesting developments going forward to see who will cater to these institutional players who will become bullish on ether, especially, especially after Shanghai update and the whole de risking I do want to be mindful of everyone's time here. We're coming up at the top of the hour and everyone in the audience, I want to thank you for being here. Thank you for listening in. It's been wonderful. It's been amazing to just see you guys, listen to you guys talk, exchange thoughts, asking each other questions. I feel like this is the way every panel should be.
00:53:09.990 - 00:53:41.590, Speaker H: Mutual engagement and interest from everyone. So guys, please give everyone on the panel a follow. You can always expect top insights from them, top information. So, yeah, just give them a follow. I also want to give everyone an opportunity to just outro and tell everyone in the audience what you're working on currently, where to find you, newsletters, websites, etcetera.
00:53:45.600 - 00:54:09.670, Speaker B: Yeah, I appreciate you having us on. Nothing to play yet. As I mentioned. More announcements coming on the personal side, hopefully soon on where I'm at, where I'm going to be stationed full time. But yeah, you can always find me on Twitter 89 and just another shout out to Hill Dobby for all of the amazing work. I think we're all jumping on his back with a lot of the stuff he basically holds up. Dune in my view, data, always.
00:54:12.370 - 00:54:34.790, Speaker A: Thank you for having me. And I learned a lot from everyone in the panel as well. Super happy. And right now I'm working on a new Dune dashboard which is about Ethereum. So stay tuned. And in the meantime, we also have a lot of newsletter, a lot of great content, great tools, which is available on our website, 21 shares and then look up our research there and stay tuned.
00:54:43.810 - 00:55:04.030, Speaker E: Yeah, thanks for hosting this, Helix, really appreciate it. At Keiko we've got a couple newsletters, one more broad market trend and then a deep dive one. You can find that at our new research website that's linked in my bio and yeah, thanks for having me.
00:55:06.120 - 00:55:26.100, Speaker D: Yeah, so great to be here. Thanks for having me. I really enjoyed hearing all the insights from such a brilliant panel. And yeah, I'm currently working with Nansen Research covering scaling and infrastructure and yeah, so check out Nansen research for some nice data driven research.
00:55:31.490 - 00:55:57.530, Speaker C: Yep, thanks for having me. On Helix and Metricstow, there's such a great panel. I just had like my notebook art and everyone's such a. Such an expert in their field. You can follow me on Twitter and Misari Crypto as well. I will continue to write research and cover staking and all things defi and layer ones. Yeah, thank you.
00:55:59.670 - 00:56:37.070, Speaker F: Super, thanks helix and everybody for putting this on and sharing your viewpoints. You'll find us under rated.net work or aidedw three b on Twitter. I'm eliasimos on Twitter and if you're interested in working with infrastructure data, especially low level funky stuff like Meb and building things like relay reputation builder reputation, dig deep into that whole can of worms that is infrastructure data, come talk to me. We're always looking for great people to work with.
00:56:40.570 - 00:57:35.620, Speaker G: Thank you for hosting Helix. That was really nice, really good talk and learned a lot there. You can find me on Dune and on Twitter. And yeah, I think I also use just about tools from everyone here, so it's also nice to have a really good panel in general for staking. I would just recommend if you look at high level data of dashboards, if you look at lower level data, I would recommend, like Elias said, rated network, which I think has the best view there. And in terms of what I'm working on next June, dashboards mostly. And in terms of what exactly there's a lot of them, I already say right now because I don't know what I'll be able to share next, but yeah, thanks a lot for hosting.
00:57:38.000 - 00:58:00.814, Speaker H: Amazing. Thanks everyone for joining. Thank you to the audience for being here listening in. If you want to check out more of this content, give us a follow. We have these spaces weekly so those are always cool to check out. We have educational courses if you want to learn web3 data analytics. So give us a follow, check us out and see you next week.
00:58:00.814 - 00:58:01.890, Speaker H: Thanks everyone.
00:58:02.990 - 00:58:03.870, Speaker D: Thanks so much guys.
