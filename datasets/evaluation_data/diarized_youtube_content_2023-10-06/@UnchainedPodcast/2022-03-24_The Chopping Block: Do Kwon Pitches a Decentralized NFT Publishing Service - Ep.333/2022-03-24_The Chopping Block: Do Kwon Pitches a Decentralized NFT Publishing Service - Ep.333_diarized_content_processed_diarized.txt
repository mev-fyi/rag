00:00:02.410 - 00:00:23.514, Speaker A: Hey, everybody. Welcome to the chopping block. Every couple of weeks, the usually four, but currently four, but three regulars of us get together and give an industry insider's perspective on the crypto topics of the day. So quick intros. First we got Tom, the DeFi maven and master of memes. Next we've got Robert, the crypto connoisseur and captain of compound. Then there's myself, haseeb I'm, the head hype man at dragonfly.
00:00:23.514 - 00:00:58.880, Speaker A: And as special guests today have joining us, do kwan, who is chief terrorist at terra. Sorry, doe kwan one of the co founders of terra, the terra foundation, and the LFG. So the three of us are early stage investors into crypto. Do Kwan is a founder in crypto. But I want to caveat that nothing that we say here is investment advice or legal advice or even life advice. Doe, how are you doing? And apologize for the intro. I was feeling myself.
00:00:59.330 - 00:01:02.574, Speaker B: No worries at all. Yeah. Thanks for having me.
00:01:02.692 - 00:01:25.110, Speaker A: Yeah. How's life in terra land? Oh it's know. I know. I'm hoping that we don't get taken off the air now that we have you on. I'm in Singapore, right? So by the way, anybody who's watching live to excuse if the connection's not great, but my connection in Singapore has been a little flaky. But you and I actually ran into each other. I didn't even realize that you were in town.
00:01:25.110 - 00:01:27.042, Speaker A: How are you liking Singapore?
00:01:27.186 - 00:01:43.898, Speaker B: It's good. It's super hot. So I find my sleep schedule all weird, so I try to maximize the time where I stay awake when the weather is still cool. So I wake up very early, go to sleep very late at night, and then I take a nap at two to three.
00:01:43.984 - 00:02:11.046, Speaker A: Two to yeah, I'm I'm living the same way because a lot of my team is on us hours, and a lot of the entrepreneurs I speak to are on us hours. So basically, I get up super early and I work a lot, like 07:00 a.m to 01:00 p.m.. And then my day gets really slow, which I'm not used to. And so then I have time to nap or work. Out or whatever. And then at night it picks up again because then East Coast wakes up and then I have a bunch of calls at night.
00:02:11.046 - 00:02:48.814, Speaker A: So I'm getting used to that routine. But it is a little weird when you first get into it. Yeah, for sure. Well, one of the interesting piece of news that we wanted to chat about this week was so you've been on a betting spree lately. It was reported that there were two bets that you made with some folks in the crypto universe. First, you made a $1 million bet I can't remember who it was was some rando on crypto on crypto twitter who was yelling at you. And then you made a second bet that was $10 million with another person, a trader in crypto.
00:02:48.814 - 00:02:56.598, Speaker A: Tell us about why you made these bets, what was the impulse behind them, and why you're so bullish on the.
00:02:56.604 - 00:03:01.880, Speaker C: Price or why the other side made the bets and what you're going to prove or disprove through.
00:03:02.650 - 00:03:49.282, Speaker B: So obviously I can't be objective about what I think about Luna price is going to be over the next few years, right? So if I wasn't bullish, I wouldn't be working so hard. So I think for me it made a lot of sense to bet in a direction that I have very strong belief in. But at the same time, one of the things that I regret about making this bet is that once I made it, I got hundreds of DMs from a bunch of people asking me to bet on everything, running the gamut from oh, like can we bet Luna at a different price point? Can you give me different odds? Can we bet on the outcome of this game? Can we bet on something? But can I be the custodian and I promise not to rug so massive, massive headache and it definitely wasn't worth OD hassle.
00:03:49.346 - 00:03:50.006, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:03:50.188 - 00:04:01.494, Speaker B: Also I think it had the side effect of giving two people, which are okay, but mildly annoying, lots of publicity in the process. So that definitely probably had some cost.
00:04:01.532 - 00:04:02.394, Speaker A: To it as well.
00:04:02.512 - 00:04:12.686, Speaker D: Maybe Terra will be the very first protocol to nail the decentralized prediction market, but it'll just be dope. You can place a bet on chain escrow and a smart contract and those going to be the counterparty for everything.
00:04:12.868 - 00:04:14.480, Speaker B: Well, nods would be great.
00:04:15.090 - 00:04:40.614, Speaker C: Let me ask you a very basic markets question. Just because I'm a markets person at heart, is there a positive or negative carry on? Let's say, like Luna Perps. Is the expected price of Luna in a year higher or lower than it is today? And did one side of this bet you or the other folks enter into this at a very quiet disadvantage based on the sort of like carrying cost of the bet.
00:04:40.812 - 00:05:10.654, Speaker B: So I think the second trader most likely hedged his bet. And you're right, from an actual cost perspective, it doesn't actually make sense for me. But for example, like the first bet, for instance, I had the luxury of locking up capital, a significant amount of capital for somebody that's kind of annoying. So it prevents him from making trades while at the same time he might make a modest return from hedging, but not as much as he would like to. Right.
00:05:10.692 - 00:05:12.046, Speaker A: So definitely worth it.
00:05:12.068 - 00:05:18.420, Speaker B: But if your question is just from like a pure trader's perspective, can these guys hedge their bets and still make money? The answer is yes.
00:05:18.950 - 00:05:29.000, Speaker C: Got it. So right now there's a carrying cost that they're profiting if they hedged it. And if you hedged it, it would have been losing to just run with that for a year hedged. Definitely interesting.
00:05:29.610 - 00:06:02.160, Speaker D: Maybe you were going to say the same thing. I'm actually curious why they want to bet with you specifically on the price of luna, when I feel like so much of the discussion I see around Terra on Twitter is around UST and the price of UST, and there's these constant battles back and forth around how UST works and if people believe in the UST. Peg and I feel like that's the interesting bet in my mind versus Luna. I think you're great and I think you've been putting out some great product, but there's so much fluctuation in overall crypto markets, it's hard to sort of know.
00:06:02.530 - 00:06:09.498, Speaker B: Well, I mean, there's a simple answer to that, right. It's harder to hedge a bet for ustdpegging.
00:06:09.594 - 00:06:09.914, Speaker C: Right.
00:06:09.972 - 00:06:15.522, Speaker B: Whereas it's very easy to hedge a bet in terms of what Luna's price is. It's a very simple option.
00:06:15.576 - 00:06:15.794, Speaker A: Right.
00:06:15.832 - 00:06:29.874, Speaker B: So I think that's why in fact, I think for the first person who took the bet, he was initially proposed a bet on USD deepging risk, even though he's been bitching about it for a year and he wouldn't take it precisely because it's not hedgeable.
00:06:30.002 - 00:06:56.450, Speaker A: I mean, it feels like, though, the real story, so there are a bunch of details about market structure that are interesting to delve into, but the real story here is that there are a lot of annoying people on Twitter. And you were like, you know what? I'm going to pick you, and you and I are going to go head to head in gladiator combat on crypto Twitter. And the question is, does that work? Do you feel like you have learned something about how crypto Twitter settles fights?
00:06:57.750 - 00:07:14.246, Speaker B: Well, I mean, it depends what you're going for, but if you're trying to apply a utility function to my time, my money and net positive publicity, it was probably negative. I'm pretty sure I'll make money.
00:07:14.348 - 00:07:16.370, Speaker A: So you feel like the publicity was negative?
00:07:16.530 - 00:07:34.970, Speaker B: No, I mean, the publicity itself wasn't negative. I think the publicity was net neutral. We got attention, but there were other things going on in the backdrop leading to that publicity as well. But I think the main cost was now basically my Twitter inbox looks like Polymarket. It's probably more liquid.
00:07:38.210 - 00:07:42.880, Speaker A: I see, okay. So probably this might be the last bet that you make for a while.
00:07:43.510 - 00:07:44.306, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:07:44.488 - 00:08:08.214, Speaker A: With Twitter critics. I see. Okay. Any advice to folks on how to deal? I mean, obviously the rise of terror over the last year has been meteoric and naturally that's probably gotten you both a lot of supporters and a lot of enemies. What have been your overall lessons on how to deal with the clamor and the noise in crypto Twitter for somebody like yourself?
00:08:08.412 - 00:08:50.200, Speaker B: Well, I feel like when I talk to a lot of founders, one of the biggest sources of burnout is that they tend to take stuff that people say on discord or on Twitter or in telegram personally. And that's a really bad way of looking at things because especially if somebody's saying that you're a scammer or whatever that you designed is not going to work. Yeah, they're not doing it so that you are going to take it personally. Even if they're fighting their bags, it's just good business. And even if they're not, it might be because it's a part of their job or because they don't know you personally. But insofar as you treat it as an opportunity to potentially say something clever or to ratio somebody, then it becomes massively fun.
00:08:50.810 - 00:08:56.518, Speaker A: Robert, I mean, you've also been through this of course, with Building Compound. What's your perspective on that question?
00:08:56.684 - 00:09:49.238, Speaker C: I think it's really simple. Crypto is more front and center as an industry in the public domain than I think any other industry on earth. If you look at the CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, they have like 1000 followers and crypto even like the earliest stage projects are immediately in the public arena right. In a way that most corporations aren't or most leaders of corporations just aren't. And I think it's both extremely positive and extremely negative, especially for the mental health of a lot of the participants. The other thing that's interesting about it is we also live in an industry unlike every other where almost everyone's anonymous or a very large contingent is anonymous versus any other industry. And so it makes it a lot easier in a good and bad way to spar.
00:09:49.238 - 00:10:27.926, Speaker C: Right. And so I actually think it's a great skill and I think the folks that are looking to create something in the space have to just assume that they're going to get it. That there's a lot of people who are comfortable and it's helpful for a lot of founders and negative, but there's a lot of folks that are ready to engage with the positive and the negative and it's just not something you're ever going to get. With Web Two? I founded a Web Two company. The number of people that were positive or negative on Twitter about it was like zero. Right. And so it's just so fundamentally different.
00:10:27.926 - 00:10:41.980, Speaker C: And I think some people it's fuel. And if it's fuel for you, you should probably consider founding something. And if it's not fuel and if it's scary, find a co founder that it is fuel for.
00:10:44.990 - 00:11:24.760, Speaker A: I remember the very early days of Terra back when it was primarily just payments. And I remember there was Chai, which was the payments company that was kind of the primary tenant of the Terra blockchain way back in the day before you guys adopted smart contracts. When do you feel like the experience of building Terra really changed from being kind of like what Robert's describing of like it matters but mostly people are just kind of using the product to now this is like a you're constantly fighting every single day on crypto, Twitter and it's like it's just a war zone. When did that change?
00:11:25.370 - 00:12:26.454, Speaker B: After some point we sort of made a conscious decision that it's not worth a lot of trouble trying to build a payments company across like twelve different jurisdictions. There's a reason why it's never been done before, and it's more of a compliance business than anything else, right? So the reason why all the payment interfaces look pretty much the same is not because the entrepreneurs working there are stupid. It's because there's a lot of red tape in trying to get anything done. And actually, the less developed the market is, the harder it is to get things done. So, for example, if you look at Indonesia, they haven't caught a payment license in, I think, over the last decade, and then in order to do so, and if you talk to the people on the ground there, they say stuff like, oh, you need to know the right people, or you need to be ready to pay. And I'm like, dude, I'm not going to bribe people. After a while, we sort of decided that trying to build a payments company and have that be sort of like the central consumer of a blockchain just doesn't work for lots of different reasons.
00:12:26.454 - 00:12:33.750, Speaker B: So we started to think about what are some other things that you can build with stablecoins? And that's sort of when the Terra ecosystem started to take off.
00:12:33.920 - 00:12:41.870, Speaker A: And when do you feel like you guys hit that inflection point of like, oh crap, now this thing is more than just a product, it's now like a movement.
00:12:42.370 - 00:13:36.206, Speaker B: So actually, in DFI 2020, we spent a little bit. So like, in early 2020, we split the two companies altogether. So Chai, my co founder, Daniel Shin, he split off and he started to run Chai. And then I started running TfL, and then TfL had, I think, twelve people when the split finalized, and it was almost all devs. So we said, hey, look, I think we need to think about different things that we need to build. So we sat and looked at the whiteboard and twiddled our thumbs for like 3 hours, and then we decided, okay, yeah, we got to try to do this in another ecosystem where there's more activity, right? So we started to spend some time looking at DeFi ecosystems on Ethereum. And then I think around DeFi Summer, we anonymously launched a fair launch project on Ethereum.
00:13:36.206 - 00:13:58.666, Speaker B: And I think I spoke to more than one of you here, which was super fun because Terra didn't really have a DeFi ecosystem back then. So understanding the mechanics of fair launches and what gets people excited about DeFi, and lots of other new innovations that were coming into the space, that was a huge learning experience. So we took a lot of those learnings and started to launch things like.
00:13:58.688 - 00:14:04.234, Speaker A: Mirror and Anchor and some other things, which ended up doing pretty well.
00:14:04.432 - 00:14:07.770, Speaker C: Yeah, full disclosure, robot Ventures invested in Mirror.
00:14:08.270 - 00:14:31.534, Speaker A: Yes. And Dragonfly invested into Anchor. I think we got some Mirror through secondary markets so we're also very avid investors in the Terra ecosystem. Speaking of investments, one of the big news of the week that, unfortunately, Tarun couldn't be here to experience our love and admiration.
00:14:31.662 - 00:14:33.506, Speaker C: It's more fun, actually.
00:14:33.608 - 00:14:56.442, Speaker A: It is more fun. Who's not here that we can talk shit and talk about the real stuff. So, Gauntlet just closed around, raising $23.8 million, led by Rivet Capital at a $1 billion valuation, which makes Gauntlet a unicorn. So congratulations to Tarun. Crazy, crazy outcome. I realize that a lot of people listening to the show probably don't even know what Gauntlet does.
00:14:56.442 - 00:15:30.594, Speaker A: So, actually, we are early investors into Gauntlet. Gauntlet, for those of you who are not aware, gauntlet is basically a how would you describe Gauntlet? So, basically, they're like a kind of analysis simulation company. That what they do is they work directly with protocols, layer ones, DeFi platforms, things like that, and they try to use actor based simulations to determine what optimal parameters might be and what the risks are to different protocols. Is that a good description, Robert?
00:15:30.722 - 00:16:26.066, Speaker C: Yeah, I think Compound was Gauntlet's first customer, so I'll explain it from the perspective of Compound. So, Compound has all these parameters to determine how risky it is to borrow assets from Compound or to provide liquidity and earn an interest rate. How useful is each asset as collateral? What are all these different bells and whistles and levers and buttons and things? Right. The parameters of the protocol. Gauntlet built a super smart computer program that analyzed the one key important number, which is, will the protocol suffer losses in the context of all of these parameters and configurations? And they built, like, a computer program that analyzes it and simulates it and runs it through 800 million Monte Carlo runs. And it says, Are these parameters good or bad? Based on what the market does? Do that for Compound, they do that for Aave. They do that for all sorts of other DeFi protocols.
00:16:26.066 - 00:16:51.470, Speaker C: It's like simulation Monte Carlo box to analyze if a protocol is safe or unsafe. So they could theoretically build a simulation engine to look at UST or different Terra things or any other DeFi protocol. But it's a bunch of PhD types that are building models of how DeFi protocols work, and they get paid by these protocols, which is like the new approach.
00:16:51.970 - 00:17:06.002, Speaker A: Yeah, it's actually really interesting. I think they were the first company to really get paid in a very significant way by protocols. So I think it was Ave that first did, like, a Dow proposal to pay them, and I think Compound pays them as well. Right.
00:17:06.136 - 00:17:10.578, Speaker C: Ave and Compound both pay Gauntlet by the protocol itself right.
00:17:10.664 - 00:17:25.210, Speaker A: Sort of in protocol payments, which now I think has actually become more of a thing since Gauntlet kind of pioneered it. And now I think we see, like, auditors starting to get paid within protocols and other things like that. Doe do you guys do anything like that within Terra, sort of paying companies within the protocol.
00:17:25.710 - 00:17:55.010, Speaker B: So I think there's been a number of brands, but no, we've never really had an association where the Dao is paying for a service provider. Some of the things that we've done are things like, for example, like the Washington National sponsorship. So the Nationals team made a community pool spend proposal against our community pool, and then the community voted to unlock the funds to give to the Nationals. And that was like the only instance that happened at scale.
00:17:55.690 - 00:18:21.450, Speaker A: That's pretty cool, though. That's legit. That's definitely taking it a step further to do, like, a sponsorship by a Dow proposal. That's pretty sick. Well, now we know why Tarun didn't show up today, is that he's too good for us now that he's a unicorn founder. So hopefully we could try to convince him to hop back on the show in the future. But congrats again to Tarun and Doe.
00:18:21.450 - 00:18:25.040, Speaker A: Do you want to take a bet on what Gauntlet is going to be worth in ten years?
00:18:25.650 - 00:18:27.790, Speaker B: No, I wouldn't bet against Tune.
00:18:29.250 - 00:18:39.666, Speaker A: You could take either side. Yeah, you don't have to bet for him. You could bet against him. You could bet against him. I promise there's no carrying costs on this one, so this is the only way to do it.
00:18:39.848 - 00:18:40.580, Speaker C: Right.
00:18:41.190 - 00:18:44.306, Speaker B: Well, I am less educated, so I don't think I'll bet on that one.
00:18:44.488 - 00:19:10.474, Speaker A: Okay. All good. I was hoping we could hedge some of our Gauntlet exposure. Well, moving on in news, so that was not the only major fundraise this week. There was another pretty blockbuster fundraise. So there's been a lot of news in the last couple weeks about Yuga Labs, which is the creator of Board Ape Yacht Club, as well as other associated franchises. There's a big pile of news, and I'm just going to kind of run through all of it and then kind of hone in on the most interesting bit.
00:19:10.474 - 00:19:53.542, Speaker A: So the first of all, Yuga Labs announced a fundraise. So they raised $450,000,000 at a $4 billion valuation led by a 16 z. So obviously the second now most valuable company in the NFT space behind Openc. They also announced that they had bought the rights to all of the CryptoPunks from Larva Labs. And what they did is they decided to give the IP rights of the CryptoPunks to the owners of CryptoPunks. So Board Ape Yacht Club has always had, as part of their IP agreement or the licensing agreement, that if you own the board Ape, you have the IP rights of that board Ape. Meaning you can put it on merchandise, you can put it in a movie, you can do whatever you want to with that IP.
00:19:53.542 - 00:19:56.950, Speaker A: That was not the case with CryptoPunks. You have the commercial commercial rights.
00:19:57.030 - 00:19:57.274, Speaker C: Yes.
00:19:57.312 - 00:20:19.854, Speaker A: You have the commercial rights. Commercial rights. Excuse me. And so that was not the case with CryptoPunks. But after Yuga Labs bought up the IP rights to CryptoPunks from Larva labs. They now did the same thing with CryptoPunks, which now gives any holder of a CryptoPunk commercial rights over using those CryptoPunks however they choose. Subsequently, that brought them a lot of fanfare, a lot of cheering, a lot of people were very excited.
00:20:19.854 - 00:20:50.140, Speaker A: And it caused a resurgence in trading volume for both punks and for the board apia club franchises. Then Yuga Labs launched Apecoin, which is a token that is airdropped to all owners of anything within the crypto, or sorry, not the crypto pumps, the board AP yacht club universe. Apecoin did an enormous amount of volume. It was a huge event, tons and tons of excitement around it. It is currently trading at 1.5 billion circulating market cap what's the FDV right now?
00:20:52.190 - 00:20:53.582, Speaker D: 11 billion? Something like that?
00:20:53.636 - 00:21:02.078, Speaker A: Yeah. Ten to 11 billion FTV. Apecoin right now. It's a little bit under specified what it does. What exactly does apecoin do? A lot.
00:21:02.164 - 00:22:08.946, Speaker C: Okay, so one, it's going to be the primary currency in a project called other side, which they're releasing shortly, which is going to be like their universe, other side, they're going to sell land, it's going to be competing with decentraland and the metaverse projects out of Facebook one day and all these things. Also, they're really working hard to make it a currency that's usable everywhere. So, like, Time magazine announced that you could purchase a Time magazine subscription in Apecoin. It's likely that they're going to be working on many other use cases for the ape token, but it's meant to really be a currency. It's also a governance token in their platform. And it's also going to be, if you've read some of this community discussion proposals on the apecoin forums, which I have and I don't know if many other people have, it's also going to be distributed to, potentially distributed to those who stake their board apes, mutant apes, et cetera. I think it's going to be one of the most powerful economic forces in NFTs, in the history of NFTs.
00:22:08.946 - 00:22:10.950, Speaker C: But that's a whole separate conversation.
00:22:11.450 - 00:22:22.220, Speaker B: So let me ask you guys this. Why would somebody buy board apes versus those mutant skull things? What makes this collection special?
00:22:23.070 - 00:22:58.946, Speaker C: Well, the mutant skull things are weird, interesting, ugly, and important. So I'll just go through why I think they have an interesting place in the NFT history books. So what really set board apes apart from CryptoPunks and CryptoPunks are OG. And I'm an OG crypto punk. Maxi and I used to only support CryptoPunks, and I've, over time been converted to someone who also has board apes. But CryptoPunks existed. Larva labs created me bits and gave a large number of me bits to the holders of crypto punks.
00:22:58.946 - 00:23:55.010, Speaker C: Mutant apes were a similar fork AirDrop to board ape holders, but they did it in more interesting ways, as opposed to just like you have a crypto punk, you get one meat bit. So the mutant apes are. It's a more complex offshoot where there's different tiers of mutant apes, there's mutation serums that everyone got. You basically evolve these original board apes into these mutant apes and where they also have relevance in the apecoin ecosystem. And I apologize ahead of time if I sound like a board ape crazy person, but where they also have relevance is that they're one of the other primary assets in their ecosystem. And in terms of the distribution of apecoin, in terms of the distribution of future call it airdrops of different properties that they're creating. And they've announced that they're creating many different properties to coincide this universe.
00:23:55.010 - 00:24:46.834, Speaker C: These are like the primary identities that they view as having value. They bought all the IP of crypto punks and me bits, but they don't view them as like the primary actors in the apecoin or Yuga ecosystem. In the same way they do this tiered system of board apes and then mutant apes as sort of like the recipients of the economic benefits of their ecosystem. So what's interesting is that board apes and mutant apes and the Kennel Club, which are the dogs, all have sort of like a ratioed economics which were integrated through the ape token. And so you can see this in the ratio of value that was given away in terms of how much ape for each of these. You can see it in the proposals around the staking rewards for the different asset classes. There's basically through the early experience been like a ratioed value between these different assets.
00:24:46.834 - 00:25:22.914, Speaker C: And the interesting thing is to see on secondary platforms like OpenSea and Looks rare and potential future marketplaces, whether or not they continue to trade in these given ratios and why. I imagine at some point this is like my utopian future. There's going to be a hedge fund that's like a Yuga ARB hedge fund that just ARBs between relative value, between mutants and apes and dogs, right? And it's going to be an actual professional job title for somebody in like a year. And if you're an up and coming person, that could be your it.
00:25:22.952 - 00:25:55.498, Speaker B: It almost feels like with NFTs, you're sort of inverting the IP publishing model, right? So before you needed to create sort of a centralized lore like Harry Potter or the Marvel series. And then there will be one person writing it, one canonical lore that codifies all the stories and the myths and all the fantasies in this world. Once you make that story successful, you now get to sell little tokens that represent some associated value of this IP. So you could either sell like Harry.
00:25:55.514 - 00:25:57.998, Speaker A: Potter wands or capes or, I don't.
00:25:58.004 - 00:26:33.980, Speaker B: Know, whatever people buy or like a little scart sticker or whatever. But I think NFTs it has the same value capture mechanism, or maybe even saying value capture mechanism is sort of the middle of the bell curving it. But the idea is that you sort of publish these tokens first, and then you sort of rely on the community to create provenance and lore around it in a way that doesn't really have a canonical center. But it almost feels like the value of these collections, the collections with more provenance, with more lore, more culture built on top of it, is going to eventually be more valuable. Am I looking at this the right way?
00:26:34.510 - 00:27:18.146, Speaker A: So I would disagree with that. I think that's true for some NFT collections, right? I think it's very true for Loot. I think Loot is the canonical example of that. I think it's somewhat true for CryptoPunks, but I think apes are probably the least probably the polar opposite of that, where I think Yuga labs actually done themselves a tremendous amount to create that lore, to create the universe. To actively market to build those relationships and kind of build relationships with celebrities, get this thing into TV spots and make news and do really dramatic things in order to keep the lore going and make it really powerful. And so it does feel like there's some NFT collections whose valence has been built in a very bottoms up way. And it's true to an extent.
00:27:18.146 - 00:28:13.450, Speaker A: Like every NFT collection can only be successful if there's bottoms up engagement. But of all the NFT collections, it feels like the ape universe has been the most top down and the most successful in large part because of that, right? If you sort of compare NFTs to luxury brands, there are some luxury brands that become really, really powerful sort of in spite of themselves, right? Because, oh, this one woodmaker from however many years ago, only made like 200 violins. And that's why these are the most famous violins in the world or whatever. And then there's Rolex, and Rolex just goes out and they just do the friggin work to make Rolexes what they are, right? They get into all the rap videos. They make sure that people on TV are wearing Rolexes, they make sure that the most famous people are flashing it when they're on late night talk shows. That's to my mind, what Yuga Labs is. And they've shown that execution can get you there, can get you into that central spot in the NFT ecosystem.
00:28:13.870 - 00:28:16.810, Speaker C: It's manufactured, but it's brilliantly.
00:28:18.510 - 00:28:20.166, Speaker D: Mean, you touched on a point with the Rolexes.
00:28:20.198 - 00:28:22.346, Speaker A: And with the mutant apes, which is.
00:28:22.368 - 00:29:17.246, Speaker D: Like, I think in my it's. I feel like a lot of brands struggle from this issue, especially in NFTs, where supplies are so limited, of wanting to be broadly desirable and recognized, but also having some level of accessibility, right? Like a Ferrari is kind of more accessible than a Pagani Huira, even though it's more expensive, but there's more Ferraris, and so people kind of know about it more and has more of a legacy or something like that. And so I feel like you want to sort of find room for yourself to. Go down market and if you're supreme sell a box logo shirt for $80, but not everyone can buy the $10,000 jacket or something like that. So you have some amount of accessibility without ruining your brand but still sort of preserving that top tier status. I think that's what Mutant Nave is trying to explore that line right now. I think a lot of people were really excited about the Larvae Labs acquisition for sort of the commercial license reasons that you mentioned.
00:29:17.246 - 00:29:48.760, Speaker D: But I think if anything, it's in my mind sort of a big advertisement for CC Zero and sort of on chain it native NFTs as opposed to having IP live in this sort of weird meat space and be arbitrarily reassigned at the whim of VCs or entrepreneurs instead of have it live with the NFTs themselves. So who's to say that the commercial licenses cannot be revoked or changed or sold somewhere else? And so it's weird that it's been given, but it can also just as easily be given away or taken away.
00:29:49.370 - 00:29:53.194, Speaker C: Oh, so the question that I was going to ask is regardless of the.
00:29:53.232 - 00:30:08.350, Speaker B: Method by which collections get this metric, but would you say that there's a similar relationship between NFT collections to cultural exposure and let's say relevance to layer one blockchains and their TVL?
00:30:09.410 - 00:30:46.838, Speaker A: It feels quite different to me. It feels very different to me. I'd say NFTs getting a lot of cultural cachet and getting a lot of attention is not enough to make your TVL go up. That just seems obviously true is that there are things like disagrees who disagrees anjay disagrees. Take cardano, for example. Right. Cardano has an enormous amount of cultural attention and awareness and eyeballs and users who own Cardano token are excited about Cardano relative to its TVL.
00:30:46.838 - 00:30:49.178, Speaker A: Its TVL is like infinitesimal, right?
00:30:49.264 - 00:30:55.142, Speaker C: Well, that's because the blockchain doesn't really work yet if it was actually functional. L one.
00:30:55.296 - 00:31:19.654, Speaker A: Sure. I mean, take even ethereum classic, right? Ethereum Classic is a good example of a blockchain that way punches under its weight relative to the number of holders of ATC. I think there are plenty of examples of this where there's a divergence between the actual because the number one thing that's going to give you TVL is builders building things that actually require TVL, that there are reasons to put money on there. Right. TVL is more a function of whales to those point.
00:31:19.692 - 00:31:39.514, Speaker C: This is what I agree with. They're both vaguely like Hype derivatives in a way, in that how successful it is is sort of like a derivative of just how much attention and excitement there is for it and there will know things that don't fit into that model. Like Cardano. Right. But I think in general there's a.
00:31:39.552 - 00:31:48.174, Speaker A: High correlation I want to push back on. Like I think you need more than Hype to get TVL, right? Just getting Hype doesn't get you TVL, it gets you eyeballs, it gets you.
00:31:48.292 - 00:32:00.798, Speaker C: Trading blockchain has to work. If cardano was like Avalanche, let's just say it was as functional as Avalanche, I guarantee you would have crazy TVL.
00:32:00.974 - 00:32:07.650, Speaker B: Yeah, there's a lot of latent TVL for cardano. Just because I haven't moved it in yet does not mean it's not TVL.
00:32:08.310 - 00:32:23.626, Speaker A: No, the thing is, I think the willingness to buy cardano and trade it is very different from the willingness to put your money at risk in the protocol. Right. There's a much smaller number of people who can actually deposit TBL into protocols than who can buy know guys.
00:32:23.728 - 00:32:46.660, Speaker B: I was actually just thinking about this one thing. So it almost feels like if there was a service provider like Yuga Labs, but they sort of do this thing of creating culture and stories around NFT collections as a service instead of doing it just for that one collection, this company would be massively successful. Kind of like decentralized Disney, if you will.
00:32:47.270 - 00:33:09.446, Speaker A: No, Disney owns the Disney like makes it very genuinely part of their universe. It's not like a if Disney was outsourcing the creation of the like that company that did the outsourcing would be worth a lot less than Disney. Nike has a bunch of suppliers, but Nike is the thing that's valuable, not the suppliers. Right.
00:33:09.468 - 00:34:14.346, Speaker B: But what you could do is that in some ways by being a service provider, instead of issuing all the IP yourself, you sort of subscribe to the game publisher model. So if you look at game publishers, they don't actually initially come up with the game scripts or the initial game IP themselves. They wait for indie game developers to pitch the games to them and then they see early traction. So they have the comfort and the ability to use the data that they see from that early traction to publish multibillion dollar games. And what they can do is that they make an investment right before they publish such that they take a meaningful stake or meaningful royalty cut of the potential revenues that are generated. And this could be exactly the same thing. For example, off the top of my head, and I'm kind of definitely not an NFT expert, but what if we just got a collection, hired a bunch of novelists to write fantasy novels about ten different characters, and then just made, like, a Simpsons TV show by gathering a village of 30 different NFTs together.
00:34:14.346 - 00:34:27.650, Speaker B: And then we got, like, four guys and then made a girl group out of it. Hire four girls from Asia. Actually you can hire twelve and have three groups compete. I don't know, I feel like there's a publishing model here that could potentially make money.
00:34:27.800 - 00:34:41.350, Speaker C: I agree that there's an opportunity to expertly manufacture NFT experiences in a way that's more than just like here's 10,000 pictures that I pseudo programmatically generated.
00:34:41.850 - 00:35:40.042, Speaker D: I like DOE's point here, especially on the Disney topic. There's this phrase inside of Disney Feed the Beast, which is this idea that the way Disney makes money is not by selling movies, it's by selling merchandise and parks. And that's where they make all their money. And so in reality, it's like you generate the IP to sell all of this other stuff. And the IP is almost like secondary in a way. And so really what Disney has been doing lately over the past few decades has been buying distressed IP and then like Marvel, Star Wars, which no one really cared about, and shoving it through the Disney machine and making insane amounts of money by basically taking this distressed IP and showing how to make money on it. And so I don't know if there's like a comp here for like maybe the question is what would you guys buy as distressed IP in the NFT space? What do you think are underrated gems that you think deserve polishing from the sort of community and merchandising and narrative side?
00:35:40.176 - 00:36:26.902, Speaker C: Well, I think the key point though that you were just bringing up is that those brands had fan bases that were passionate and ready to vote with their wallet on those brands. What makes them distressed is that the price that the market was valuing them was too low relative to how many diehard and loyal fans they had. Right. I don't know if the same model is going to work with NFTs because most of these at least today in 2022, and we're in chapter one of NFTs, which is going to be like 100 page, 100 chapter book. But as of right now, there's so many of these things. They've all been around so short an amount of time. And in very few cases you have loyal fan bases for them.
00:36:26.902 - 00:36:53.780, Speaker C: Right. There's no loyalty there because there's nothing to be loyal to. There is no content. They're just profile picsets that are pumped out in short amounts of time. And so I don't think it's the same thing yet. Maybe in 30 years someone's going to look at Board Apes or Crypto Punks as like, wow, that's an undervalued brand because people are still diehard about their punks, but it's worth almost nothing on the market.
00:36:54.870 - 00:37:24.714, Speaker A: Maybe the realization here is that Board Apes is the first real franchise that we've seen within NFTs. Right. They're the first real kind of full stack. Not just four dudes get together and pay a bunch of service providers to mint a 10,000 PFP collection, but they do something much more, much more muscular and much more like what we would identify as what Disney might do with Star Wars. That feels like the thing that Yuga Labs really got right, that almost everybody else gets wrong in this industry. Yeah.
00:37:24.752 - 00:37:36.080, Speaker C: They onboarded celebrities and through events and through parties. And they took what otherwise would be like every other profile pick 10,000 NFT set and actually made it awesome.
00:37:36.610 - 00:37:36.974, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:37:37.012 - 00:37:43.710, Speaker D: Ugalabs. I guess Disney crypto punks, right? These neglected punks and they're pumping up the ugalabs machine.
00:37:44.450 - 00:38:21.210, Speaker A: I saw the ugalabs deck. And obviously they're now teasing other side, which is like this metaverse thing that they're going to do. And it did feel very disappointing to me. And I guess this is like the other side of the if you, if you sort of take seriously the idea that, okay, these guys are good at this brand identity, right? That's what these guys are good at. Building a metaverse, building like a game universe is incredibly hard and it's obviously going to take many years. And it's not their proficiency, it's not what got them here. But then straightaway land sales, right? There's 200,000 or was it 10,000 or 100,000 plots of land in like a metaverse that's currently unspecified.
00:38:21.210 - 00:38:50.486, Speaker A: It feels like just incredibly money grabby to me. And I don't know if anybody else felt that way, but I'm just like this is like you jumped straight to the end of the Disney line of like now you're pre selling tickets to your theme park and you have no ability to even build theme park. Like you never built a theme park before. Or maybe a theme park has never even been built before and you're just like, oh yeah, obviously you're going to want season passes to my future ape themed theme park. And I don't know.
00:38:50.588 - 00:39:06.102, Speaker D: Yeah, it is a bit triple dippy in that they sold the apes and then they sold equity in the company that made the apes and then they dropped the token, which is nondilutive for whatever reason. And now they have a bunch of the token and so it's like, yeah, they just kind of keep dipping.
00:39:06.246 - 00:39:09.558, Speaker B: It's God tier which is working. Yeah, God tier.
00:39:09.654 - 00:39:44.386, Speaker A: It is god tier. It is definitely God tier. Monetization for a company that launched three PFP collection or four PFP collections. But to your point, Tom, that is the power of Disney, right? Disney is not the massive company that it is because the IP is so creative and generative or whatever. It's because it's really freaking good at monetizing the IP that it does have. And maybe that's the ultimate takeaway from Yuga Labs is beyond just the execution and the creativity. It's the fact that they were somehow able to wring billions of dollars out of launching a bunch of apes.
00:39:44.578 - 00:40:06.160, Speaker B: What do you guys think about these web3 games that are launching? So how does everybody feel about something like Axie? And it's kind of interesting watching a bunch of AA web, two gaming publishers trying to jump on the bandwagon because they saw the axe success story and they think they can do better.
00:40:06.610 - 00:40:36.914, Speaker C: Axie was a success not because the game the game sucks and is horrible and is not fun, it's completely stupid. But because of the economics of the game. What they really launched was a D Five protocol with a better pixel front end. They didn't launch a good game. Candidly, the game sucks, right? But the economics are what made it interesting to the world. Right. I think there's going to be a lot of people that launch web3 games and they're all going to suck.
00:40:36.914 - 00:41:06.500, Speaker C: I think at some point someone's going to launch a game that's absolutely amazing and it happens to coincide really well with cool crypto economic systems and it's going to win the whole world and it's going to be like the greatest game that's ever been created and everyone's going to be obsessed and play it. Economies around the world will collapse and people won't leave anymore, but I think that might be like a long way away until someone just nails an incredible game and an incredible economy at the same time.
00:41:07.030 - 00:42:04.914, Speaker A: Yeah, I find Axio Infinity incredibly cynical and very I think it was incredibly bad precedent that taught a lot of people the wrong lessons about what crypto gaming will be and what it'll be about. And I think I actually placed a lot of the blame at VCs as well because I think a lot of VCs were kind of amplifying this narrative because it sounded good and it got a lot of attention that this is the future of gaming, this is the future of economies. People in the third world are going to stop growing crops and going to stop attending stores and instead they're going to sit around and do repetitive game loops all day and just Mine, fake currencies and fake universes. And this is just obviously not only bad for the world, but it's also just like a perpetual motion machine level understanding of how economics works. And there can't be a game where everyone makes money. There's no economy where everyone makes money. Some people must spend money for other people to make money.
00:42:04.914 - 00:42:20.218, Speaker A: And the idea that everyone in the third world is just going to get paid to play some dumb game over and over again that doesn't actually produce any net value to anyone else is unsustainable. I had this tweet a long time ago that was a little tongue in cheek but also very genuine, which is.
00:42:20.224 - 00:42:22.170, Speaker C: That you can't show your own poker.
00:42:23.710 - 00:43:01.766, Speaker A: It's our show. I could show whatever. All right, there was somebody from Dragonfly who tweeted that poker is the original play to earn. And I think actually this is a the more time I've thought about this, the more I actually really strongly believe this is that poker is a good example of a game that works within play to earn. Because some people make money, some people lose money, some people don't, some people break even. But that has to be how the game works. There cannot be a game and poker manages to make that fun and that's a good understanding of what the game probably will feel like if there is this economy within inside of it.
00:43:01.766 - 00:43:15.414, Speaker A: Right. There can't be a game where everyone's making money that doesn't exist. There is no game like that. Yeah, ask people who bought it. Ask people who bought it in January.
00:43:15.542 - 00:43:21.530, Speaker C: Over any long period of time. Like, come on, you can have things that aren't zero sum.
00:43:22.190 - 00:43:40.558, Speaker A: I agree, there are positive sum games, right? But in order for there to be a game where people are making money, there has to be spending and there has to be value creation. And so it's like, okay, where is that spending coming from in Axio Infinity? Very unclear. Most of what's happening in Axio Infinity is basically like digital sharecropping.
00:43:40.734 - 00:44:21.760, Speaker C: Sure, but here's the, you know, vision though. What if you just put a game layer on top of the actual real world economy, okay? Like what if you just had like a sick metaverse on top of a real economy that's not zero sum, right? Where you're not in a zero sum mining and spending loop, but where you're actually running the corporations that exist in the real world. Some enderts game like thing where you don't even realize that you're playing the real world and you're controlling the corporations and business units of things. What if the play to earn thing is like you're running corporate treasury of some corporation in Argentina and you don't even know, right?
00:44:23.170 - 00:45:16.774, Speaker A: So basically this right now is the metaverse. Well, what I would say is that look, if you imagine jobs in the Metaverse right here's, one of my core complaints about the kind of play to earn vision is that the jobs that are conceived of as being the jobs you'll do in the metaverse are extremely repetitive, simplistic tasks like mining in axio infinity or growing your axes and battling them and whatever. And basically in Axio infinity, I mean, here's the first telltale sign that your system is fucked up is that in Axio Infinity you cannot run bots, right? If you run bots, they have like an anti bot detection. Why? Why do they prevent bots? The answer is because they want you to do it manually. They don't want you to write a bot that will do this very repetitive, stupid, mind numbing thing over and over again because otherwise there'd be too much mining too fast. And they're like, no, we can't do that. We can't automate things and make things more efficient.
00:45:16.774 - 00:46:09.218, Speaker A: We have to make things inefficient so that we slow down the rate at which this ponzi ends up getting unwound, right? That's why you're not allowed to bot in Axio Infinity in the real world. If you can bought this thing, of course you would bought it because that is the way that we've improved the world is by having human beings not tilling the fields, but machines tilling the fields, right? So human beings get freed up to do more complex things like design ponzi nama games. So the job that you'll do in the metaverse that will actually pay you will be things that only a human being can do. Like for example, being like a virtual host where you come in and you entertain people and make them excited to come into your virtual cafe and meet. That's the kind of job that's very hard for an AI to do. Probably you will need a human being to do that and it's more like a real job. It's not like a rote clicking buttons over and over again.
00:46:09.218 - 00:46:11.538, Speaker A: That's what every Play to Earn game today is like.
00:46:11.624 - 00:46:18.726, Speaker C: I'll visit the cafe that you're the virtual host. That sounds awesome to see. Once you are a virtual host, let me know.
00:46:18.908 - 00:46:23.590, Speaker A: There you go. I had a more colorful example in mind, but I went with virtual host.
00:46:26.410 - 00:46:30.138, Speaker C: All right, I hope I don't think that is what I think that is.
00:46:30.304 - 00:47:05.770, Speaker A: No, don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. Anyway, let's move on. So last piece of news that we'll run through is Mr. Mark Zuckerberg, who actually Tom used to work for, I don't know if everyone knows this, tom used to be at Facebook and Instagram, so he's very close with the Zuckerverse. Mark Zuckerberg announced at south by Southwest, which is a big sort of multimedia conference in Austin that NFTs are coming to Instagram. So he was a little bit vague on the details, but supposedly there will be minting of NFTs and presumably there will also be PFPs that can be used natively on Instagram.
00:47:05.770 - 00:47:14.678, Speaker A: So Tom, given your insider's perspective on the Zuckerverse, what do you think of this announcement about know I was going.
00:47:14.684 - 00:47:23.318, Speaker D: To say, I think our portfolio company founder Alex Mess might say instead that Instagram is coming for Showtime joke.
00:47:23.414 - 00:47:25.610, Speaker C: You mean NFTs are coming for instagram?
00:47:26.510 - 00:47:27.978, Speaker B: No, because that's what you said.
00:47:28.064 - 00:47:32.134, Speaker D: NFTs are coming to Instagram. It was a joke about Showtime trying to do Instagram.
00:47:32.182 - 00:47:33.440, Speaker A: Instagram is coming anyway.
00:47:34.370 - 00:47:35.758, Speaker D: Yeah, sorry, that's what I get it.
00:47:35.764 - 00:47:36.622, Speaker A: We got the joke. Great.
00:47:36.676 - 00:48:30.398, Speaker D: Anyway, ten out of ten really land anyway. Yeah, I've heard about this coming for a while. I think the impression I get was this was initially sort of designed or started as like a creator monetization movement within Instagram which has always been sort of this conflict with a lot of these social media platforms now of how do content creators get paid. Some obviously platforms pay out pretty generously like a YouTube. Others such as Instagram, less so and they sort of do it on like a more ad hoc basis with respect to negotiating contracts and things like that. And the idea was this going to be a way for Instagram to sort of up level its game here and get Instagram creators paid. And I think since basically the pivot to meta Zuck's become much more interested in this area and so now it's becoming almost more of a metaverse kind of play that Instagram is a part of.
00:48:30.398 - 00:48:42.990, Speaker D: So I'll be curious to see how this plays out. I don't quite know what they have in store. But I mean at this know, Twitter has already sort of broken the gates open. So we'll see what happens when it comes to tech adopting NFTs.
00:48:43.150 - 00:48:51.080, Speaker A: So how is the meta metaverse going? Because I keep seeing these tech demos come out every once in a while, but it seems very underwhelming to me.
00:48:51.530 - 00:49:20.942, Speaker D: Yeah, I don't really know, to be honest. I don't really know what everyone's doing. I do know, I think what Facebook does better than any other tech company is growth. They can pretty much build mediocre products and then just grow the shit out of them. And so I really have complete faith that they'll be able to get a shit ton of users on whatever it is that they build independent of the quality. I think it's a question of what is it going to look like, when does it come out, all the sort of nitty gritty details around it.
00:49:21.076 - 00:49:24.954, Speaker C: I think they're going to fail and instead partner with the Yuga verse.
00:49:25.082 - 00:49:32.814, Speaker D: Wow. I think they're going to buy Yuga's coming for Instagram. They're going to buy something. What would you buy if you were Zuck?
00:49:32.942 - 00:49:47.398, Speaker C: If I were Zuck, to be honest, I would not buy Yuga or Apecoin because it's probably too expensive. But you buy the sickest early stage team in the entire space. You buy five of them, right. Buy 20 of them.
00:49:47.564 - 00:49:51.718, Speaker B: I don't know if that's Facebook style, though. They buy like a category leader.
00:49:51.814 - 00:49:52.122, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:49:52.176 - 00:49:54.970, Speaker B: So maybe it's like something like Openc.
00:49:56.110 - 00:50:06.590, Speaker C: Openc would be really good. Openc would be a great also very expensive. If Meta buys openc. You heard it from Doe.
00:50:07.330 - 00:50:12.766, Speaker A: You heard it from Doe. Doe, do you want to take a bet on the value of Apecoin in ten years?
00:50:12.868 - 00:50:15.010, Speaker B: Not at all. Well, zero.
00:50:15.080 - 00:50:15.906, Speaker A: That's a good one.
00:50:16.008 - 00:50:17.790, Speaker C: I'll bet on Apecoin with you, Doe.
00:50:17.950 - 00:50:18.274, Speaker A: Okay.
00:50:18.312 - 00:50:19.170, Speaker B: I'll bet on zero.
00:50:19.240 - 00:50:20.660, Speaker A: Doe says going to zero.
00:50:21.670 - 00:50:23.442, Speaker C: I'll take way higher than that.
00:50:23.576 - 00:50:24.500, Speaker A: Oh, really?
00:50:25.190 - 00:50:29.446, Speaker C: I'll take the current price higher in one year than the price right now.
00:50:29.628 - 00:50:33.480, Speaker A: Oh, wow. Higher one year than it is right now.
00:50:34.010 - 00:50:36.680, Speaker C: Let's say ten months. Let's say ten months, to be specific.
00:50:37.210 - 00:50:39.990, Speaker A: Ten months. What do you think is the terminal value of Apecoin?
00:50:40.150 - 00:50:50.794, Speaker C: Honestly, I think it's a very asymmetric situation, but I actually would be long. Personally, I am slightly long. It so not materially, but like, wow.
00:50:50.912 - 00:51:02.350, Speaker A: Did you see the Labs round? Yeah. Did you invest or no? No, you did not invest. Okay. Are you open to sharing your rationale of why you pass on Yuga Labs?
00:51:02.770 - 00:51:09.220, Speaker C: Listen, I only invest in things less than, like, a $50 million valuation. I'm a precede person.
00:51:10.070 - 00:51:44.646, Speaker A: You're a precede okay. Got it. I was looking at some of the big luxury goods companies, like the valuation of Nike and LMVH and all these companies that maybe you can think of as, like, the non Metaverse analogies to what UGA Labs might be or is trying to be. Now, obviously, if they do build the Metaverse, then the comp is really different. But nike is the most valuable company in that category. It's worth 36 billion today. And right now, apecoin FTV is like eleven bill, so that's like a third fully diluted.
00:51:44.646 - 00:52:10.230, Speaker A: I mean, I think I think to be clear, I think FTV is kind of a nonsense metric in a lot of ways. I don't think it's really that comparable to looking at the market cap of a traditional company, but because of the differences around dilution and how to actually understand what dilution means in crypto versus in traditional companies. But it does feel rich. But with apecoin right now having 1.5 billion circulating, that actually seems if you just take the nominal circulating market cap, it actually seems pretty reasonable to me.
00:52:10.380 - 00:52:56.430, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, I don't know how you can say it's rich when they just created $11 billion out of value out of thin air. I think, if anything, it's kind of like people underestimated tech companies in the early 2000s compared to sort of brick and mortar legacy businesses and sort of doubted the ability for these companies to maintain software like margins at scale, and instead they turned into the biggest companies in the world. And I think we could see something like that for luxury goods where, yeah, maybe nike just isn't a great business because they have this sort of lower margin, brick and mortar, high opex sort of business. Whereas if you just have only the IP, and that's pretty much your only cost, maybe you can actually just get way bigger than all these other sort of legacy luxury businesses.
00:52:56.590 - 00:53:21.274, Speaker C: I mean, the best counterpoint is I don't think I've bought any luxury good ever. Like, the most expensive watch I ever bought was, like, $1,100. I don't buy nice shoes. I don't buy nice anything. But dropping a hilarious amount of money on a picture of a monkey, I'm like, yes, give me that digital monkey now. Right? Like hundreds of thousands of dollars, right. In a way I would never over a lifetime, spend that much on luxury goods.
00:53:21.274 - 00:53:22.218, Speaker C: Offline.
00:53:22.394 - 00:53:25.710, Speaker B: Shouldn't you only invest in precede NFTs?
00:53:26.050 - 00:53:29.082, Speaker A: Great question. What happened to being a precede investor?
00:53:29.146 - 00:53:31.738, Speaker B: Yeah, what's up with overpaying for NFTs.
00:53:31.754 - 00:53:33.418, Speaker C: When you should be getting precede?
00:53:33.594 - 00:53:37.706, Speaker A: Exactly. That's my approach. I mint only. That's my approach.
00:53:37.898 - 00:53:43.422, Speaker C: I buy the lindy effect. Once the NFT is awesome and everyone agrees it's awesome, that's when I'm like, aping in.
00:53:43.556 - 00:53:54.178, Speaker A: Got it. Aping in. Indeed. It okay. Well, on that note, I think we're at time. So want to thank you, doe, for coming on board and jamming with us on everything going on in the aperse.
00:53:54.274 - 00:53:54.822, Speaker C: Thanks.
00:53:54.956 - 00:53:59.220, Speaker A: That's it. That's it for this week. See you, everybody on the other side.
