00:01:22.060 - 00:01:35.830, Speaker A: The topic for today's show is DAOs. Here with me in Osaka, Japan, at defcon to discuss are Mariona Conti, head of smart contracts at MakerDAO and Peter Pan seminar of MetaCartel. Welcome, Mariona and Peter.
00:01:35.990 - 00:01:38.010, Speaker C: Hi. Happy to be here.
00:01:38.160 - 00:01:43.840, Speaker A: Let's start with introductions. Why don't you each talk about what you do in the space. Mariono, why don't we start with you?
00:01:44.290 - 00:02:06.190, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. So I'm the head of smart contracts at MakerDAO. I've been at the foundation for three years now, and I'm in charge of making sure that the Maker platform smart Contracts, work correctly. So lately it's mostly been taking care of audits and formal verification ahead of multicolateral dai.
00:02:06.350 - 00:02:14.642, Speaker A: Great. And Peter oh, actually, you know what, I wanted also to ask you, can you just describe sellout Dao? Because that was something fun that you did that's related to our topic.
00:02:14.786 - 00:02:47.806, Speaker C: Yeah, that's a hobby of mine. So I am also a member of Molokdao, and at a hackathon I decided it would be fun to try to do on chain corruption. And this involved Dao, which is just a smart contract that I can use as my delegate key in Moloch. So anybody can use my voting power to create proposals and vote on them on the Moloch Dao. And it actually works on any Moloch like Dao.
00:02:47.998 - 00:02:57.862, Speaker A: Wow, interesting. So we'll dive a little bit more into that later. So, Peter, why don't you tell us about MetaCartel? And I think it's separate MetaCartel Dao. Maybe not, I'm not sure.
00:02:57.916 - 00:03:12.854, Speaker D: Right. So, hi, I'm Peter, and I guess I'm one of the people running the MetaCartel community. Right, and the MetaCartel is community around focused around DAP experimentation and DAP development.
00:03:12.902 - 00:03:13.258, Speaker E: Right.
00:03:13.344 - 00:03:20.886, Speaker D: And currently one of the projects that we've been working on for the last half year right. Is our metacarto dao.
00:03:20.918 - 00:03:21.114, Speaker E: Right.
00:03:21.152 - 00:03:32.030, Speaker D: So the Metacarto Dao is a communities Dao, at least Metacarto's communities Dow, that's focused on funding DAP experimentation, specifically new business models and new use cases.
00:03:32.450 - 00:03:40.610, Speaker A: Great. And can you give us a little bit of the backstory about how you started that? Because I think it started with you being rejected from Dao. Right?
00:03:40.760 - 00:03:51.138, Speaker D: Right. Yes. So the Metacarto Dao was kind of like birthed from the path of redeeming myself.
00:03:51.224 - 00:03:51.714, Speaker E: Right.
00:03:51.832 - 00:04:00.342, Speaker D: So while the Medicator community have kind of existed for a while now, ever since it was created around last September.
00:04:00.486 - 00:04:01.594, Speaker E: Nearly a year ago. Right.
00:04:01.632 - 00:04:13.498, Speaker D: Or it's now nearly created a year ago, but during April, I believe, this year, Molokda was really taking off, and I really wanted to be part of that governance experiment.
00:04:13.594 - 00:04:14.240, Speaker E: Right.
00:04:14.690 - 00:04:20.266, Speaker D: Except Amin picked me to kind of join it because I was doing a lot of stuff around DApps.
00:04:20.298 - 00:04:20.686, Speaker E: Right.
00:04:20.788 - 00:04:39.874, Speaker D: And they wanted a new perspective within Molokdao, except I don't have that much money, so I pledged ten E as opposed to standard 100 E. Right. And I didn't have a lot of friends in Molok, so I was rejected. And basically can I say something publicly?
00:04:39.922 - 00:04:41.858, Speaker C: I voted against Peter.
00:04:42.034 - 00:04:42.758, Speaker A: Oh, really?
00:04:42.844 - 00:04:44.182, Speaker C: That first time? Yes.
00:04:44.316 - 00:04:46.840, Speaker A: Wait. Oh, why?
00:04:48.830 - 00:05:20.898, Speaker C: It was mostly a social contract, like Peter said. The initial members mostly pledged 100 E, and some of us said that we just by principle, wouldn't let anybody with less than 100 for the first few months. So this is all public on the blockchain. You can see I would vote down for the first couple of months people joining with 50 and ten, but I think something good came out of it. This is my pen, and sorry, are.
00:05:20.904 - 00:05:22.980, Speaker A: You saying that you would accept him now?
00:05:24.070 - 00:05:27.830, Speaker C: No, the second time around. Well, you tell the story.
00:05:27.980 - 00:06:04.414, Speaker D: Right. So, I mean, I accept the apology, Mariano. It was all good. I understand what came from. But yeah, so interestingly. I'll get to how I got in later on, even though that was very contentious by itself, but I was rejected, and I was like, you know what? Why don't we create our own Dao? So for more context, for the last couple of months before April, right, the Medicato Dao kind of finished up a lot of its work around Metatransactions, right. Basically, it's a UX, I guess, solution that allows you to abstract gas fees from the user experience.
00:06:04.414 - 00:06:19.942, Speaker D: And as we finished up this work, we were looking for new things to kind of work on. Like, we have a great community. We have a funny meme or dancing chili. What should we work on? And it was like, Why? And we realized no one was building DApps. It wasn't a topic or headline title in this space.
00:06:19.996 - 00:06:20.214, Speaker E: Right.
00:06:20.252 - 00:06:24.434, Speaker D: Everyone was still focused on infrastructure and being working close to the infrastructure layer.
00:06:24.482 - 00:06:24.982, Speaker E: Right.
00:06:25.116 - 00:06:32.790, Speaker D: We realized that we should be getting people to build DApps, and we were like, okay, let's create a DAP incubator or let's create a pot of money to fund DApps.
00:06:32.870 - 00:06:33.402, Speaker E: Right?
00:06:33.536 - 00:07:08.706, Speaker D: And as I was know, this was like a perfect, fun little stunt to kind of get back at it. It started off as a meme, right? But then people were like, hey, sure, I'll put Ethan the pot. And I'm like, oh, really? Cool. Yeah. And I am also a member of a few other Dows, including so how I got into Moloch, right, was I was working on this other dao of Amin, right? And James Young and a few other people. Ken Yang and Darren Mills.
00:07:08.738 - 00:07:08.982, Speaker E: Right.
00:07:09.036 - 00:07:11.842, Speaker D: On the synchron Yang Dao.
00:07:11.986 - 00:07:12.342, Speaker E: Right.
00:07:12.396 - 00:07:25.062, Speaker D: So basically one day I was for an INSO chat by Me, and it was like, the synchronic Yang Dao. I'm like, what the hell is Yang Dao? And then it was like, oh, let's create a Dow to push Andrew Yang.
00:07:25.126 - 00:07:25.642, Speaker E: Right?
00:07:25.776 - 00:07:36.770, Speaker D: And then apparently that became a thing and worked on that and I guess kind of like pushed for funding proposal to fund the work of Yang Dao.
00:07:36.790 - 00:07:37.070, Speaker E: Right.
00:07:37.140 - 00:07:48.094, Speaker D: And I was part of that. And even then, that was very contentious by itself, and even how the votes came kind of like, fell through, it was also contentious.
00:07:48.142 - 00:07:48.514, Speaker E: But yeah.
00:07:48.552 - 00:07:49.460, Speaker A: Wait, why?
00:07:50.150 - 00:08:41.362, Speaker C: Well, because if I remember correctly, a lot of us voted no on Yang Dao. But this was Yang dao proper. Moloch funded Yang Dao, not Peter specifically. And then, I mean, since he had his votes and he had, I believe, 500 shares of spank chain voting aside from his own, he swing the vote in his favor. And I actually considered race winning then because I thought that Yang Dow, it was too US centric, too political. But I came around after watching the memes. I believe everything is better with memes, and it's a way that people can communicate and understand, and in the end, I accepted it.
00:08:41.496 - 00:08:53.654, Speaker A: Yeah, well, that was actually my very first thought. Like, you're Argentine and Peter is Australian. So I was like, why would you guys care about doing the Yangdao? But now you're saying that you're glad that you guys did that.
00:08:53.852 - 00:09:18.074, Speaker C: I am from Argentina. But I do follow us. Politics quite a bit because anything that happens in the US. Creates ripples. And in places like third world countries like Argentina, we feel anything that happens in the US or Europe, we feel it bad. So if you get a cold, we get pneumonia. And I was following the elections, and I realized that this was actually a good way to proceed.
00:09:18.202 - 00:09:36.718, Speaker A: That's interesting. It's also interesting to me because I feel like Andrew Yang has a much more domestic focused platform, but now we're getting really far afield. So just to go back, I wanted to ask about MetaCartel. Like, how much money now do you have? In it and what are the requirements for people to participate?
00:09:36.814 - 00:09:42.582, Speaker D: Right, so I guess we recently dipped back under 1000 e because we keep spending our e, right?
00:09:42.636 - 00:09:43.286, Speaker A: Oh cool.
00:09:43.388 - 00:10:24.434, Speaker D: But we hover up around 1000 to 900 E nowadays. Right, and the requirements is really like so you can actually join the Dow through two means. You can either pledge funds and the minimum is like ten E right now, which is about 2000 $3,000 USD and you can also join the Dow by providing work that we want to get done in space. Right, and it's really like we see work and I guess pledge funds as just like minimum barrier to filter people through and it's really about we just want to actually get the grid. I guess what we really care about is getting the right people in versus how much they bring monetarily, right?
00:10:24.632 - 00:10:45.218, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, depending on the demographic like for some people $2,000 is a lot for a hobby type thing but if they can work their way into it but then is there like a max? Because otherwise are you guys then subject to people just sort of dominating that?
00:10:45.404 - 00:11:15.714, Speaker D: Yeah, we do have a max as in like whenever there's a new member that wants to join right, there's a social max of like 100 e at the moment. Right, but whenever a new proposal comes we all discuss it as a Dow. Right, so whether we're comfortable with them joining firstly and them comfortable joining with that many shares or that much power yeah, there's some cases where we've actually not let certain people come in with as much. Okay, interestingly enough.
00:11:15.912 - 00:11:32.134, Speaker A: Well so before we go on, I actually also want to go back to Sellout Dow. So what was the reaction from the other Malok Dao members to that? Do they like it or do they dislike it? Did they feel like you're hijacking the process? Do they agree that it is on chain corruption internally?
00:11:32.262 - 00:12:35.210, Speaker C: A lot of people did like it and as you can see it is not very powerful yet somebody can hijack my account and vote with my 100 shares. That's about it. So even though we do have some kind of voter apathy, if somebody puts a proposal through it's very easy to get shut down. It only needs two other members maybe to vote it down. So as a social experiment it was really amazing. Pretty much everybody liked it and it gave way for other types of discussions like do we need shielded transactions? Anonymity a lot of people do want to vote yes or no to proposals but they don't want to make it be public, make it known what they voted on. So no, I think it was a really good experiment and when I wanted to join MetaCartel this was after Selloutao I got a little bit of a pushback because they said are you going to try to corrupt this one as well?
00:12:35.360 - 00:12:38.590, Speaker A: That's funny. So then did they let you join?
00:12:39.170 - 00:12:44.250, Speaker C: Yes, I believe one member voted no to my proposal, but was it Peter?
00:12:44.410 - 00:12:57.510, Speaker D: No, I wanted if Marriott is joining, I welcome them in. So the member that I guess raised a concern against his crimes right, with Moloch Dao was Makoto.
00:12:59.290 - 00:13:09.546, Speaker C: Makoto from Weird Kickback and ENS yeah, he does another Dao archie or Archie, yeah, so I joined that one as well yeah what.
00:13:09.568 - 00:13:10.570, Speaker A: Does that one do?
00:13:10.720 - 00:13:25.534, Speaker C: It's an events dao. It was made specifically for DevCon as a way to fund and sponsor events and it may go on after DevCon. We're still not cool.
00:13:25.732 - 00:13:37.426, Speaker A: Well, wait, so I just want to make sure I understand Sellout dow again. So at any given moment, when is it that somebody can take your right.
00:13:37.448 - 00:14:03.046, Speaker C: Now, the way I wrote it, because this was just during a weekend, it only works one time. So when I did it a couple of months ago at East Berlin, I managed to sell my vote once and the member who bought it, santi City from Democracy Earth, he ended up getting voted in because people love the experiment.
00:14:03.158 - 00:14:03.834, Speaker A: Oh, cool.
00:14:03.952 - 00:14:24.894, Speaker C: And this second time, I activated it again just for one other bribe, let's call it. And I was giving a presentation on Sellout and the first slide had a QR code saying whoever sends one Ether will be the briber and before I turned to the second slide, somebody shouted from the audience, Sold.
00:14:25.022 - 00:14:25.570, Speaker A: Oh, wow.
00:14:25.640 - 00:14:29.806, Speaker C: So somebody sent one Ether in like 30 seconds to an unknown smart contract.
00:14:29.918 - 00:14:31.586, Speaker A: And do you know who it was?
00:14:31.768 - 00:14:42.210, Speaker C: I think I do know, but this person has not actually used it. They're reselling this bribe OTC.
00:14:42.370 - 00:14:43.318, Speaker A: Oh, wow.
00:14:43.484 - 00:14:44.150, Speaker C: Yes.
00:14:44.300 - 00:14:49.530, Speaker A: Wow. Okay, so I guess you, in a way, almost have anonymous transactions.
00:14:50.430 - 00:15:13.294, Speaker C: It is a way to kind of do that, yeah, and I think it was a great continuation of the experiment. I thought whoever sent the ETH would just come to me and say, hey, I want this to happen. I want to try to get some money for this proposal or want to join as a member. But no, they want to resell it.
00:15:13.412 - 00:15:24.514, Speaker A: Well, but one thing is, I guess I thought with Malik Dao that part of the voting and stuff is like people sort of knowing who's proposing what or you know what.
00:15:24.632 - 00:15:34.326, Speaker C: So like, for a member to join, somebody has to sponsor them. So you cannot create a proposal. Not anybody can do it, only existing members.
00:15:34.508 - 00:15:38.802, Speaker A: So wait for Sellout, they can only vote they can't also propose for Sellout.
00:15:38.866 - 00:15:47.354, Speaker C: Yeah, if they do it via Sellout, then they can create proposals without my intervention. So they run through me as a proxy, let's say.
00:15:47.392 - 00:15:54.570, Speaker A: Right. So did people kind of dislike the fact that then they don't know who is behind any given proposal?
00:15:54.730 - 00:16:23.830, Speaker C: No, not really, because it was still a controlled experiment. As I tell you, I only activated it twice and for this second time. Yeah. We don't know what's going to happen, what proposal is going to go through, and even if it is going to go through at all, because I give the limit of one week, and after one week, I will just revert to my original key and shut down the Sellout.
00:16:24.250 - 00:16:27.240, Speaker A: Oh, why are you putting a time limit on it?
00:16:27.770 - 00:16:45.082, Speaker C: Because the way Molok works, selloutao is a smart contract that acts as my delegate key. So as long as I have a delegate key, if it is Selladao, then I cannot do anything else on the system. I cannot vote on anything. I cannot create my own proposals.
00:16:45.226 - 00:16:46.078, Speaker A: Oh, I see.
00:16:46.164 - 00:16:52.490, Speaker C: And if I want to keep participating, then I need to revert back to my original key.
00:16:52.660 - 00:16:57.220, Speaker A: Okay, so when Santi had it, what did he do with it?
00:16:58.230 - 00:17:28.726, Speaker C: He put himself up as a member, so he proposed himself as a to. I was going to propose him anyway because I think he's a good candidate for Moloch, but when he found out what I was doing, he no, no, I want to go the Sellout Dow way. It's like there's an Argentinian creating on chain corruption and another Argentinian actually using it. We thought it was hilarious.
00:17:28.838 - 00:17:50.654, Speaker A: Yeah, that is great. I did a great episode with him and Glenn. Wyle. All right, so can you guys each describe how you handle the governance of well, so MetaCartel we can talk about, but then also I was thinking maybe MakerDAO. So whoever wants to start just like in general, describe the governance of your Dao.
00:17:50.702 - 00:18:15.014, Speaker D: Right. So one of the interesting things is that while most people assume that because the governance, I guess the hard governance on chain right. Aspect of the Dao, of Medicato Dao is distributed amongst its members, that governance is conducted in distributed manner, if that makes sense. Right. Governance in Medicato Dao is done and conducted in a very soft manner.
00:18:15.062 - 00:18:15.274, Speaker E: Right.
00:18:15.312 - 00:18:16.938, Speaker D: It's mostly soft governance, actually.
00:18:17.024 - 00:18:18.902, Speaker A: And how do you define soft governance?
00:18:18.966 - 00:18:38.802, Speaker D: I guess it's like before, really. Any decisions are made on chain membership proposals or funding proposals. It goes through the internal forum, right. Our internal discord chats, and we have weekly calls as well around new proposals. And I guess there's like due diligence that's done.
00:18:38.856 - 00:18:39.170, Speaker E: Right.
00:18:39.240 - 00:18:48.082, Speaker D: And we trust certain people to conduct due diligence. And basically it's actually heavily built on trust, ironically.
00:18:48.146 - 00:18:48.760, Speaker E: Right.
00:18:49.210 - 00:19:04.780, Speaker D: And it seems that we can't get away from, I guess, human leadership as it is. I think that's something that we realize that we're going to actually further invest into that social scalability, if you will.
00:19:05.150 - 00:19:06.634, Speaker A: And what do you mean by that?
00:19:06.752 - 00:19:38.230, Speaker D: I guess it's like Medicato Dow right now is bottled deck quite a bit governance wise because I guess it's like basically when you have one person doing a lot, that person tends to have a lot of information asymmetry right. And because of that, if people trust the Asymmetry, right, and trust that person's know how, then it's fairly lopsided and you end up with just like, people following one person.
00:19:38.300 - 00:19:39.014, Speaker E: Right.
00:19:39.212 - 00:19:48.886, Speaker D: And that's quite inefficient, just simply due to input output right. Or decisions that can be made and proposals that can be processed.
00:19:49.078 - 00:19:55.660, Speaker A: Right. Like it's not delegated. So then what are you saying that now you need, what, more people?
00:19:56.110 - 00:20:06.974, Speaker D: So one of the things that we're looking to solve, I guess, solve the social scalability problem of Dows right. And how we govern this dow is by 40 people right now.
00:20:07.012 - 00:20:07.358, Speaker E: Right.
00:20:07.444 - 00:20:08.558, Speaker D: And soon it's going to be 60.
00:20:08.644 - 00:20:09.470, Speaker A: You said 40.
00:20:09.620 - 00:20:22.354, Speaker D: Yeah, there's 40 people right now, and soon there's going to be 60, 8100. And that's like, very unmanageable. So we're looking to actually set up working groups and delegate trust and autonomy to each one.
00:20:22.392 - 00:20:22.594, Speaker E: Right.
00:20:22.632 - 00:20:28.382, Speaker D: So it's likely going to be a working group that's going to basically be focused on technical due diligence.
00:20:28.446 - 00:20:29.022, Speaker E: Right?
00:20:29.176 - 00:20:33.074, Speaker D: There's one that's going to be focused on outreach, one that's going to be fundraising.
00:20:33.122 - 00:20:33.430, Speaker E: Right.
00:20:33.500 - 00:20:40.598, Speaker D: And we're starting to and for example, right now we're spinning out our first, I guess, group called the Raid Guild within our Dow.
00:20:40.774 - 00:20:42.842, Speaker A: The raid guild. Yes. Okay. What's that?
00:20:42.896 - 00:20:53.482, Speaker D: So the Raid Guild is really focused on design and development of everything we need in Dao, right. And we've been funding work basically to service the dow internally.
00:20:53.546 - 00:20:53.966, Speaker E: Right.
00:20:54.068 - 00:20:58.874, Speaker D: But we realize that even the teams who are running that need to scale socially.
00:20:58.922 - 00:20:59.614, Speaker E: Right.
00:20:59.812 - 00:21:05.162, Speaker D: And so we're almost just starting to spin out working groups and each one will likely have its own leader.
00:21:05.226 - 00:21:05.742, Speaker E: Right.
00:21:05.876 - 00:21:13.442, Speaker A: So I don't know if I totally follow, but it's like if one of the projects needs marketing or something, then there's like an in house marketing. Is that what you're saying?
00:21:13.496 - 00:21:38.922, Speaker D: Correct. There's likely going to be a Shill dow, right, where all the shillers go there. And just like, we have a guild, so just like we have a Raid Guild, there's going to be a Shill Guild or Dao, et cetera, internally within it. And we kind of think about metacartone the community and the Dao not as just like one organization. We think of it as a system, like a kingdom, if you will.
00:21:39.056 - 00:21:39.450, Speaker E: Right.
00:21:39.520 - 00:21:51.578, Speaker D: We think of it as a kingdom where it creates economic value, but it doesn't optimize for just money, right. It optimizes for also our well being. It invests resources into culture.
00:21:51.674 - 00:21:52.320, Speaker E: Right.
00:21:52.930 - 00:22:40.394, Speaker D: And we even have a visual map internally on a figma board of Medicato as a kingdom. So we have Forgery, where it kind of maps out all the pieces of software that we have shipped and exists out there. We have like a alchemy lab where it's like ideas. It's almost like a visual CRM to map out the I guess to map out the virtual reality of the Medicato kingdom. Right, and it really helps you us frame how we should think about things. Right, and on this map, we have one city, right? Now imagine you have different literal, a map with images representing buildings, right. And all the components of the Dao, from our discord chat to our forum to our Dow Bank.
00:22:40.442 - 00:22:40.750, Speaker E: Right.
00:22:40.820 - 00:22:45.466, Speaker D: It's all visually represented by images of kingdoms and houses, town halls.
00:22:45.498 - 00:22:45.898, Speaker E: Right.
00:22:46.004 - 00:23:12.762, Speaker D: And we have a forge. It's literally a picture of a forge in the part of the city and then the logos of the software projects around it right. In a fence. And as we're spinning out our working group visually on the map, which is actually quite big on the other side of maybe a few kilometers, if you will, away from the city, we're likely going to set up visually the Raid guild and that working group.
00:23:12.816 - 00:23:13.420, Speaker E: Right.
00:23:13.790 - 00:23:18.220, Speaker D: And that's like helping us frame a lot of how we're thinking about how to socially scale that.
00:23:18.750 - 00:23:23.846, Speaker A: Huh, okay. And when you say that, you mean the DApps that you're funding.
00:23:24.038 - 00:23:26.826, Speaker D: Yes, I mean like the DAPs that we're funding and supporting.
00:23:26.858 - 00:23:27.102, Speaker E: Right.
00:23:27.156 - 00:23:32.282, Speaker D: We almost see them as like, I guess another piece of the pie or the kingdom.
00:23:32.346 - 00:23:33.006, Speaker E: Right.
00:23:33.188 - 00:23:37.634, Speaker D: And they may start up very small, but they might have their own town and city eventually later on.
00:23:37.672 - 00:23:38.210, Speaker E: Right.
00:23:38.360 - 00:23:45.602, Speaker A: Right. There's something about this that reminds me of consensus, but maybe with the incentives a little bit better aligned or something.
00:23:45.736 - 00:23:47.300, Speaker D: We don't have a lot of money.
00:23:48.570 - 00:24:01.370, Speaker A: Okay. But, yeah, I don't know if having a lot of money has worked out super well for some of the teams in so all right, so why don't we then now talk about how governance is handled in MakerDAO?
00:24:01.710 - 00:24:46.358, Speaker C: Yes. So Maker is one of the oldest projects in Ethereum. So we've been doing governance for a while and it is not unlike what Peter mentioned. We now have reached a sort of cadence where everything starts at the forums. We used to do it just on our chat and on Reddit and on Twitter. But finally we created a forum and everything starts there. And the community now, even though we have and this was also voted in, we have an interim governance facilitator, which is somebody who works at the Maker Foundation to organize all the weekly votes because there are many and many more coming.
00:24:46.358 - 00:25:03.934, Speaker C: The community is now organizing and they create their own issues that they want to talk about and eventually vote on. But I will say that one of the main ones is of course raising or lowering the stability fee, which is.
00:25:03.972 - 00:25:05.566, Speaker A: Basically like the interest rate.
00:25:05.748 - 00:25:55.760, Speaker C: Yes, the interest rate of the Dai loans. And that went through many iterations. First, everything was called an executive vote, so people would vote directly with their MKR on whether a smart contract would we call it casting a spell, whether it would actually raise it or not. But then we realized not a lot of people voted on that. So we created something called signaling votes, which are much lighter. They still require an on chain transaction, but they're much lighter and they don't require you to move your MKR from accounts. So that it started gaining a lot of traction and then people got a little bored with it because nobody wants to vote once a week.
00:25:55.760 - 00:26:56.306, Speaker C: And this is something that at least I personally want to see fixed by the community itself. I would like for them to there's a lot of great communities that talk about decentralized finance, talk about maker, talk about other projects and they should get together and via smart contracts delegate some of their voting power to elected members. We can learn something from traditional politics or whatever you want to call it, but the good thing is, since this is on chain, you can as easily give power than take it away. So you could say, let me call out a name, for example, Ryan Sean Adams. He talks about DeFi a lot. He has a great community with his newsletter, so maybe that community can delegate voting power to him and he can vote on behalf of them. And then if somebody doesn't like what he's voting on, they can remove it.
00:26:56.306 - 00:27:09.030, Speaker C: So as you can see, it's very similar starts like signaling via forum, then signaling on the blockchain, and then finally voting with the tokens on the blockchain as well.
00:27:09.100 - 00:27:16.066, Speaker A: And then how would that work technically if you delegate? Because presumably you wouldn't want to give all your tokens to Ryan Sean Adams.
00:27:16.178 - 00:27:53.074, Speaker C: No, of course there are several ways to do it and the simplest one would be just a smart contract that it receives tokens and people vote on one account. And all that account can do is with that balance, it can vote on this or that spell as we call them, but they wouldn't be able to extract any money, just any of the MKR, just the person who put that in. They will be able to take it out. In fact, I'm thinking about it, it's probably a 40 line smart contract. I would like people to do it.
00:27:53.192 - 00:27:59.350, Speaker A: So does that literally not exist? Because it does sound like it would be so easy to do and it sounds like it should already exist.
00:28:00.010 - 00:28:07.286, Speaker C: It's very easy on the technical side, but it's not easy on the community and social side like getting people to.
00:28:07.308 - 00:28:08.754, Speaker A: Actually use the smart contract.
00:28:08.802 - 00:28:09.158, Speaker D: Okay.
00:28:09.244 - 00:28:11.980, Speaker C: That's why I'm guessing that it's not there yet.
00:28:12.510 - 00:28:23.774, Speaker A: Okay. All right, so in a moment we're going to discuss more about how the governance works and also things like user experience, security, and some other issues. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make the show possible.

00:29:47.004 - 00:30:37.554, Speaker B: Will the world follow France and advocate banning privacy coins? Will government backed stablecoins become the new fiat are distributed and peer to peer exchanges just a flash in the pan? The answer is maybe. Virtual currencies can flourish and create a new, private and more versatile economy. But that grand vision can't happen without keeping crypto clean, and that requires support of governments and accountability for bad actors.

00:30:43.088 - 00:31:01.070, Speaker A: My conversation with Mariano and Peter. And then so actually, just before we kind of move on a little bit more into the governance, I just want to make sure so how do you guys fund both of these dows? I'm sorry? You said that there's a minimum of ten ether for MetaCartel, but what about Maker dow?
00:31:02.690 - 00:31:14.754, Speaker C: Well, Maker Dow, it sold MKR tokens way back during the day. This was even before my time to.
00:31:14.792 - 00:31:18.054, Speaker A: Like, polychain and and yeah, but even.
00:31:18.092 - 00:31:36.170, Speaker C: Before that, to people on a forum, whoever wanted to read the white paper and wanted to participate, that was the initial. People say Maker never actually did an ICO, and I think that's true because not even the term existed.
00:31:36.510 - 00:31:42.686, Speaker A: All right. I think Rune said on my show he gave it to just community members who were really dedicated to exactly.
00:31:42.788 - 00:32:17.122, Speaker C: And initially and again, this was before my time, just somebody would come in and design a logo, for example, and they would get MKR, or they would do something for the community and they would get MKR. And then it was just after the fact, a lot of people hired themselves just from community work, and then they. Started working more and more for the project. So that was initially and then of course selling it to investors and that was pretty much the way it was funded.
00:32:17.186 - 00:32:25.820, Speaker A: And right now MKR token holders basically just get kind of rewarded for their work literally by the value of the tokens going up, is that it?
00:32:26.830 - 00:33:06.310, Speaker C: So MKR holders, when the debt is paid for the CDPs, in the current version, single collateral Die, that stability fee, that debt is paid in MKR and that MKR is then burned. So that is one advantage of holding MKR in multicolateral Dai, it works a little bit different when somebody pays back their debt, they pay it in die and then that Dai is accumulated and an auction is created and that Dai is used to buy MKR in the open market and then burn it as well.
00:33:06.460 - 00:33:11.302, Speaker A: Okay, but you're not actually being paid, it's simply that the value of the tokens that you have goes up.
00:33:11.356 - 00:33:11.826, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:33:11.948 - 00:33:17.050, Speaker A: And you were saying that for MetaCartel you're kind of trying to figure out revenue, right? Yeah.
00:33:17.200 - 00:33:26.942, Speaker D: So right now all the members of MetaCartel Jow who have pledged, right, have really pledged out of goodwill and the want to see a lot of the work that we're funding happen.
00:33:26.996 - 00:33:27.646, Speaker E: Right.
00:33:27.828 - 00:33:54.902, Speaker D: But the truth is there's no real incentive if you think about it, aside from the belief that we're going to do something great. And MetaCartel right now is at a point where we either go beg for more money or we actually try to actually take charge of our destiny and actually try to be sustainable and create incentive for people to actually be part of the Dao and also fund the work that we want to get to see done.
00:33:54.956 - 00:33:55.560, Speaker E: Right.
00:33:55.930 - 00:34:10.794, Speaker D: So very soon, in about a month's time, we're going to be deploying a new Dao, right. We haven't caught anything, but we're working for OpenLaw, right. To deploy a legal Dao allow, if you will.
00:34:10.832 - 00:34:11.082, Speaker E: Right.
00:34:11.136 - 00:34:11.754, Speaker A: Oh, wow.
00:34:11.872 - 00:34:24.606, Speaker D: That is actually a registered entity, which actually a Delbo series LLC, which actually we got a confirmation back a couple of days ago and that will actually serve as I guess the representation of this Dow.
00:34:24.638 - 00:34:25.122, Speaker E: Right.
00:34:25.256 - 00:34:35.310, Speaker D: And it will be able to actually legally now generate revenue and take in funds right. Pledges from accredited and non accredited investors.
00:34:35.390 - 00:34:36.020, Speaker E: Right.
00:34:36.470 - 00:34:51.174, Speaker D: As opposed to right now it's just we don't have a legal entity well, operating fairly in the gray zone, even though we're so we haven't really been able to capture any value because it'd be illegal and it'd be technically classified as securities.
00:34:51.302 - 00:34:52.026, Speaker E: Right.
00:34:52.208 - 00:35:06.478, Speaker D: But now with this next, I guess stage, we're looking to create a second Dow that will enable this possibility to occur and I guess incentive right, for the community to be part of it.
00:35:06.564 - 00:35:51.290, Speaker A: It's super interesting because yeah, I was going to ask you guys about this open law Dao and Laos in general. I have like a gazillion questions for you. But before we get into kind of some of these other topics, I just want to talk about the Dow itself, because I think to me I'm a little bit like, oh, if I were to sort of judge where Dows are right now, I would sort of say they're maybe where stablecoins were, like 18 months to two years ago. But that's kind of amazing because obviously three years ago was the Dow. So I just wanted to know, from your perspective, what do you guys feel were the main lessons from the Dow or what do you think people in general think about what happened with the Dao?
00:35:51.810 - 00:36:20.246, Speaker C: I would say that people are kind of I don't want to say forgetting about it, but they're moving past it. We're out of phase. I participated in the Dao and I remember it. I was a holder, but that was it. I didn't know too much about the ecosystem as a whole. I thought it was fine that the hard fork was created. I'm okay with how history went right.
00:36:20.246 - 00:36:41.882, Speaker C: And the Dow wise, I think if it hadn't had happened, then Dows would be much bigger right now. We're like picking up the pieces of what happened and getting past the trauma of it and saying, hey, we can do the idea was okay, but let's try and learn from it and do it a little bit differently.
00:36:42.026 - 00:36:48.240, Speaker A: And what do you feel people have learned from it? Or how do you feel like the trend is different now because that happened?
00:36:51.250 - 00:37:22.710, Speaker C: The Dow was a product of its time. I don't see almost anything else getting that much money that quickly. Now we're past that craze. So first people know not to trust random, smart contracts. Now there is a lot of laughing, laughing, laughing. No, because there is a lot of social stigma if you either don't have an audit now or you centralize certain things. And this reminds me through Moloch.
00:37:22.710 - 00:37:30.090, Speaker C: He talked to this guy from Compound and asking him about the audits for.
00:37:30.160 - 00:37:31.558, Speaker D: Do you have an admin function?
00:37:31.664 - 00:38:02.998, Speaker C: Do you have an admin function? No. And then he said, okay, do you want us to fund some kind of thing to review the contracts? And then it's like, no, we do have an audit. I'll show it to you. And that created a whole feedback loop. I don't think anybody would be able to create something like the Dow right now. We know better. But other than that, the ideas are not that different.
00:38:02.998 - 00:38:21.926, Speaker C: We're exploring something new and with the profit sharing capabilities of maybe new Dows wrapped up under some kind of legal what do you call it? I guess a Dow wrapped in well.
00:38:21.968 - 00:38:45.620, Speaker A: So actually, let's talk about Laos now. I had that question for later, but this is an interesting topic. So actually, before we get there, I just wanted to know when do you think something should be governed by a Dao versus when should it be governed by a traditional corporation or a conventional nonprofit or any other kind of legacy structure? And I guess in your case, you're doing both.
00:38:47.190 - 00:39:19.450, Speaker D: I think the interesting thing about Dows is that first of all, I really don't like using the word Dow for a lot of reasons. But the main reason is that there's nothing too special about Dows. We've had groups of people for a long time, right. And groups of people have been coordinating using different mediums and different governance structures and maybe now we just are able to coordinate same groups of people but on Chain Valley in a distributed manner.
00:39:19.530 - 00:39:20.254, Speaker E: Right.
00:39:20.452 - 00:39:27.982, Speaker D: I think that's a real difference. I guess when we're talking about Dows, it's really like groups of people with distributed governance.
00:39:28.046 - 00:39:28.418, Speaker E: Right.
00:39:28.504 - 00:39:34.030, Speaker A: And by that you just mean like disparate people on the Internet where they can be anywhere they don't have to be physically.
00:39:34.190 - 00:39:35.810, Speaker D: That's kind of the interesting thing, actually.
00:39:35.880 - 00:39:36.498, Speaker E: Right.
00:39:36.664 - 00:39:44.934, Speaker D: Technically, yes, it can be anyone and it can happen anywhere and very easily, very little.
00:39:45.052 - 00:39:57.878, Speaker A: So, like, what if it were just like a Facebook group where there's people in the group and then they can just put comments on a thread in Facebook and be know I vote this way or that way then is that a Dao?
00:39:58.054 - 00:40:11.200, Speaker D: I guess a Dow we're getting into the definitions, but I'd say my definition of a Dow is that groups of people coordinating value together right. And in our case, in our context on chain value.
00:40:11.570 - 00:40:14.770, Speaker A: Okay, so that's where the blockchain aspect comes in.
00:40:14.920 - 00:41:27.510, Speaker C: I would add that yeah, groups of people coordinating but bound by the rules of in this case, a smart contract. So bound by the code that is in the blockchain. To your point, if you said do we need Dows for everything or not? I would say if your project is called something Dow, then yeah, because you're signaling that you want to decentralize, that you want people to make choices. But I don't subscribe to the fact that every single thing has to be decentralized. We're working off of a decentralized platform that is ethereum. But then if the rules are clear and the code is clear, then I don't mind using something that somebody tells me, hey, I have the master key if that is told to me upfront that I have the choice to use it or not to use it. If a project says that they're decentralized or they're striving for as much decentralization as they can possibly be or get, then I do expect a little bit more from them.
00:41:27.510 - 00:41:41.622, Speaker C: But I won't say no to maybe I won't use it. But I won't say this project just because it does have an owner or like a multi SEG behind. I will not use it if that is told to me upfront.
00:41:41.766 - 00:41:43.386, Speaker A: So it's more about transparency.
00:41:43.498 - 00:41:44.254, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:41:44.452 - 00:42:42.330, Speaker A: Yeah. So actually I want to actually dive into this a little bit more because this has come up in a serious way with where there's been this governance turmoil. So both the CTO, Andy Millennius and then Ashley Shap, who I guess did like business development or whatever, they left and I guess a bunch of other people left also. After MakerDAO CEO Rune Christensen kind of presented this choice between a red pill, which was about making MakerDAO compliant with regulatory regimes and work with the existing financial system. And then the blue pill was basically like, if you don't agree, then you got to go. So Andy wrote this very long document kind of detailing that whole history. And the way he tells it, it's like he really believes that Rune kind of commandeered the project instead of allowing it to be this group effort, this decentralized effort.
00:42:42.330 - 00:42:58.260, Speaker A: So to my mind, it also just kind of made me wonder, so MakerDAO is this decentralized autonomous organization and yet there's also this CEO that's literally his. Yeah. How do those things fit together?
00:42:59.110 - 00:43:58.426, Speaker C: For a long time we used the term MakerDAO interchangeably with the Maker Foundation. So I think it's good to separate both. MakerDAO is the protocol, is the layer on the blockchain and the Maker foundation is in charge of bootstrapping that getting it running autonomously with as many actors as possible and then taking a step back. So one thing is the Maker foundation and other thing is like the Maker Dow. And there's only so much that I can say that I will say that I always tell my friends I'm 38, but I say crypto is high school. It feels like high school again with higher stakes. I don't want to minimize what happened, but I do agree that in order for us and as an Argentinian, I see this a lot with finance, we try to take away ourselves away from the system.
00:43:58.426 - 00:44:34.180, Speaker C: And that is bit more like cipher punk, pure blockchain kind of thing. But then once you try to do things at scale, then you're going to find out, and every project is finding out that you do need to play by the books and talk to regulators. And if you want to interface with the real world and tokenize assets or securities into a project, you're going to have to open yourself up for the regular financial system and change it maybe from within.
00:44:35.110 - 00:45:16.462, Speaker D: So I'd say for menacarto. I feel like we have a very pragmatic stance, right, where we're not chasing this mirror image of this mirage of what we should be or what things could be. From the very start, from the Dow, from the Medicato Dow, we coordinated to collect funds to fund work that needs to be done right. And this was the easiest way to do so. There was no red tape. We just launched a smart contract, basically went on asking people and it was then there and we started coordinating, right. Similar to Molok, we would have never existed with a traditional organization, with this many tiny sums of money, right.
00:45:16.462 - 00:46:07.730, Speaker D: And continually, I guess continuing on, we're looking to create incentives and basically we want to serve more people in our community, right. We want to basically help more projects get funded, great projects that may be great, profitable and sustainable businesses, right? So we kind of see this as like the next step that enables us to create more value for the people that we are looking to help, right? We're not trying to be some random Dow, this pure Utopian Dow for the sake of it. No, we want to help real people and we want to leverage Dows and web3 technologies to kind of leverage and go as far as we can, right. Rather than spend a whole year designing incentive mechanisms, we want to move fast and create as much real value.
00:46:07.800 - 00:46:07.986, Speaker E: Right.
00:46:08.008 - 00:46:25.346, Speaker A: So you're both taking this pragmatic approach. But one thing I wanted to know was when it comes to something like the MakerDAO Foundation or the Maker Foundation, that kind of creates like a centralization point where if the authorities decide to come after the Maker Foundation, then what happens to MakerDAO?
00:46:25.538 - 00:47:09.720, Speaker C: That's a great question and I'm on the engineering side, so I want to say I have no idea, but I should maybe give my opinion. The protocol continues on the blockchain. That's unstoppable, I would say. I don't know if the idea is to try to open ourselves up and talk to regulators and that's what we've been doing. So I can't imagine a world where it would just be like, okay, shut it down and cannot work on this anymore. It's like everything that's already on the blockchain would probably continue.
00:47:10.410 - 00:47:26.140, Speaker D: That's kind of the ceiling that we plank with. Right. Until we have Dows and can coordinate military forces to basically fight governments, right. It's like we're really playing under the current judicians like roof, right.
00:47:26.670 - 00:47:36.400, Speaker A: I'm pretty sure no government would allow anyway, a Dow that funded some kind of militia. But anyway, I'm just surmising yeah.
00:47:38.290 - 00:47:43.950, Speaker D: Most governments operate through violence and ability to operate in the physical, right?
00:47:44.100 - 00:48:25.200, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, so why don't we now go I know we keep saying we're going to talk about the Lao thing, but why don't we just do this right now? Actually because this is really interesting to me. So you guys have described this, but I'll just define it a little bit more for the listener. So OpenLaw created this basically a legal wrapper for a Dao, which essentially is just like a separate legal entity that could be responsible for certain things, like if there's violations of law that occur with the Dow or in this case, like accepting funds from accredited investors or whatever. So do you guys feel like this is eventually the way that all of the DAOs will have to go? That they're going to have to have some kind of legal entity associated with them?
00:48:25.730 - 00:49:02.614, Speaker C: I know that. And I'm switching from Dao to dao. But in the case of Moloch, for example, the members did talk a lot about it and I forget what the exact conclusion was. Some were in favor of trying this out, of doing wrapping the Dow with a legal framework. Others were against it that say this is too early, we don't need it yet. We're working on a I believe Molok has around a million dollars budget, maybe 1.2. Some members are anonymous.
00:49:02.614 - 00:49:21.050, Speaker C: They said we're not there yet. And then others just wanted to see, hey, this is a good experiment and if somebody's going to push it forward, then why not let it be us? But in the case of Moloch, I believe it didn't reach any conclusion.
00:49:21.210 - 00:49:40.470, Speaker A: And like if there's some kind of disagreement or just something where I guess different parties cannot agree, is it literally just the rage quit function there? Or is there some way that you guys think that these Dows should intersect with real laws?
00:49:41.290 - 00:49:55.558, Speaker D: So interestingly, we had a very similar conversation within we need to we're in a position where we either as again beg for money or become sustainable and generate revenue and deal with securities, essentially.
00:49:55.654 - 00:49:56.202, Speaker E: Right.
00:49:56.336 - 00:50:08.874, Speaker D: And Mariano is right. There's a lot of trade offs of becoming compliant. A lot of trade offs advantages, disadvantages of being completely, I guess, unregulated and in the dark.
00:50:08.922 - 00:50:09.374, Speaker E: Right.
00:50:09.492 - 00:50:15.402, Speaker D: And we realized that I guess yes, it's like we didn't know which one was the right move.
00:50:15.476 - 00:50:15.666, Speaker E: Right.
00:50:15.688 - 00:50:40.890, Speaker D: But we needed to make one. And we realized that's when we realized why not have set up a second Dow rather than make an irreversible decision with the first one? And we realized that why not? And there's no real reason we couldn't we had a community that could operate to and we decided and working with OpenLaw, we decided that was a very clear next step right. That I think no one's really taken and we want to see what happens.
00:50:40.960 - 00:50:41.434, Speaker E: Right.
00:50:41.552 - 00:50:43.450, Speaker D: And go headfirst.
00:50:43.870 - 00:50:54.974, Speaker A: This is really interesting. So it's like basically use allow in the limited instances when you absolutely need allow and then for everything else, just make it decentralized, something like that.
00:50:55.012 - 00:51:08.062, Speaker D: Is that what you're I mean yes and no. Right. That comes from a different conversation where we were like let's set up just a normal company to deal with all the, I guess the matters that had to deal with the real world.
00:51:08.116 - 00:51:08.526, Speaker E: Right.
00:51:08.628 - 00:51:14.918, Speaker D: But I guess how we're looking to structure is that this revenue generating data will be focused on profits, right?
00:51:15.044 - 00:51:18.742, Speaker A: Well, it would be like the original Dow similar.
00:51:18.876 - 00:51:19.318, Speaker E: Yes.
00:51:19.404 - 00:51:21.990, Speaker A: And the original Dow, let's hope.
00:51:22.060 - 00:51:33.094, Speaker D: But anyway yeah. And the metacarto Dow would be focused on pure ecosystem value on the application layer, similar to how Molok's focus on pure value on the core development layer.
00:51:33.142 - 00:51:33.740, Speaker E: Right.
00:51:34.350 - 00:51:42.074, Speaker D: And ideally we actually have this revenue generating Dow that provides value back to the ecosystem as well.
00:51:42.112 - 00:51:42.410, Speaker E: Right.
00:51:42.480 - 00:51:46.222, Speaker D: A percentage that goes back to medicato, Dow and the Molok example.
00:51:46.276 - 00:51:46.542, Speaker E: Right.
00:51:46.596 - 00:51:53.140, Speaker D: Because while grant funding isn't everything and it can't be everything, they have their place in the ecosystem, right?
00:51:53.590 - 00:51:54.340, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:51:54.790 - 00:52:30.534, Speaker A: I also wanted to ask about the votes in MakerDAO kind of they don't seem super decentralized. I noticed for some of the recent votes that one of them, the top voter, accounted for 40% of one vote. There was another one where the top voter accounted for 84% of one vote. And then also these are just like really small numbers of voters. It's like 20 voters, 30 voters. So how decentralized is that if it's really like one person can kind of sway things so much and it's not even that many people.
00:52:30.672 - 00:53:31.054, Speaker C: Yeah, that is a problem that we're trying to fix and it's voter apathy, as I said. It's just the fact that those were, I believe, some of the later votes. If you look at initially we had a lot more people voting and they were happy to do so. And it was, oh, finally, once everybody started voting with their MKR, it's like, okay, the system is now working, we're making decisions together and then next week it's like, okay, maybe we need to raise the stability fee a little bit more. Okay, I'll do another vote and then next week we need to have a new one and then people just stop voting. So now we only have, like you said, a number of people voting with it. One of the things also is that there are certain institutions that have MKR and are not voting because they have their tokens under.
00:53:31.054 - 00:54:00.518, Speaker C: Oh, and I know Coinbase, for example, is working. They have the Coinbase custody where they're going to allow people with certain tokens to, for example, in the case of MKR, vote on governance. But until that is there, then I think we're going to stay with somewhat lower voter turnout until those kind of things are in places or we institute what I mentioned earlier, delegated.
00:54:00.614 - 00:54:27.090, Speaker A: Yeah. So we kind of referred to Rage Quit a little bit briefly. This is the function where basically if people kind of disagree with what's going on in Maligdao, they can literally just leave with their tokens. I've heard people saying that they view this as a really smart and important feature. Do you guys agree with that? And if so, why do you think it was such a great idea to implement that?
00:54:27.240 - 00:55:10.510, Speaker C: Yeah, race Quit was and now talking in the grand style Moloch like things, it was one of the reasons that made me join with almost no second thought, thinking, okay, I can put my money towards initially Molokdao was going to fund Ethereum 2.0 initiatives. That was their spiel. And the first grant actually was the state of Ethereum 2.0 by Kyoken that Amin and somebody else they requested. I said, this is incredible. It was a really big amount of money for me, 100 E.
00:55:10.510 - 00:55:46.214, Speaker C: It's significant, but just the idea that I could remove it if I wanted to. I think that also gave a lot of people the chance to say, okay, yes, I'm going to do this. And in any case, I don't think anybody has ragequit, at least from Malok yet. The closest we were was probably the Yang Dao. But also ragequit is very simple because it's the only way for Grantees to receive their money. When Amim built that initially, he said, I want the code to be as simple as possible because it is not audited properly. No, it had one audit.
00:55:46.214 - 00:56:02.654, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm sorry. Yeah, it did have an audit and a lot of eyes looking at the code, but I don't think anybody expected it would get that amount of money. So one of the things is that if I can take it out anytime yeah.
00:56:02.692 - 00:56:17.240, Speaker A: And I saw somebody else saying that they thought it was a really smart idea because otherwise you would get people that weren't aligned, that would be stuck in an organization together and you would end up with factions. But I guess now people can go off and create their own.
00:56:17.850 - 00:56:24.022, Speaker D: So, yes, it's a great escape hatch, which anyone can dip out under right. At any time, really.
00:56:24.076 - 00:56:24.438, Speaker E: Right.
00:56:24.524 - 00:56:43.518, Speaker D: It's beautiful. But the thing on factions, that's an interesting thing about large social groups, the social asymmetry, right. Where people know each other and they tend to know others. And this creates natural, I guess, clicks even within the large social community.
00:56:43.604 - 00:56:43.854, Speaker E: Right.
00:56:43.892 - 00:56:45.998, Speaker D: Like Molok is like 80 something members.
00:56:46.084 - 00:56:46.622, Speaker E: Right.
00:56:46.756 - 00:57:07.614, Speaker D: Medicato is 40. As you get larger and larger right. There's different factions and politics comes into play quite heavily at this stage, especially with, say, Moloch, where it's transitioning into from a single summonist leadership structure to more of a collective council structure.
00:57:07.662 - 00:57:08.270, Speaker E: Right.
00:57:08.440 - 00:57:13.320, Speaker D: We're going to see politics come into play a lot more as the grounds become more even.
00:57:13.690 - 00:57:51.762, Speaker A: Oh, wow. So, yeah, this goes back to how so much of the governance for both of your DAOs really depends on the phone calls and the discord groups and whatever. So we're kind of running out of time. But because you mentioned security and the audits and stuff, I definitely want to discuss this. Obviously, we talked about the Dao where a third of the value of that contract was drained and that caused the hard fork in Ethereum and everything in MakerDAO this year alone, there were two vulnerabilities. One found in the live contract and then one in the upcoming multicolateral Dai system that's going to be launched later.
00:57:51.896 - 00:57:52.338, Speaker D: Yes.
00:57:52.424 - 00:58:01.590, Speaker A: In general, and I know you're head of this, so what do you guys do to mitigate the risks? And how do you think about security in general? For Dallas?
00:58:04.810 - 00:58:51.800, Speaker C: The code for mortic lateral Dai has been almost at a code freeze for a long time now. I would say a few months. And the last vulnerability that you mentioned, it was disclosed recently, but it was found like a month and a half ago and it was found during the actual proper process of software development. You write code, you test it as much as you can, and then in this case, you have different audits running at the same time and also a bug bounty. In this case with the bug bounty, the hacker actually found the vulnerability through the bug bounty one day before one of the auditors found it. Oh, wow. So this is an incredibly talented individual.
00:58:51.800 - 01:00:04.986, Speaker C: If they had found it one day later, then it wouldn't have been too much news because we would have patched it before and the bounty would not have been and then a second audit also discovered the vulnerability as well. So in this case, I think because the article first mentioned that it was on the Live system and then they had to retract, I think it got a lot more attention than maybe it should have because it was really a part of the natural process of building software. Like building it, testing it, and then releasing, which we haven't done yet. And yeah, in the case of the other vulnerability that you mentioned, that was in one of the libraries that we use for governance and yeah, the collateral was always safe for individuals, so that wasn't initially a problem there, but no, we were lucky that it was found via seplin during audit for Coinbase custody.
01:00:05.178 - 01:00:12.590, Speaker A: Well, wait, so what was at risk? Because I thought it was actually the collateral that was at risk on the first version on the Live contract.
01:00:13.030 - 01:00:33.250, Speaker C: No, if I remember correctly, what you could do was freeze people's MKR in the voting contract. So not the ETH collateral for the Dai system, the MKR that's locked in the voting contract to signal voting for governance.
01:00:33.410 - 01:00:38.170, Speaker A: Okay. More like about power.
01:00:38.320 - 01:00:47.980, Speaker C: Yeah, rather than that could have been griefed and luckily it wasn't and it was a stressful weekend, but we upgraded the system.
01:00:48.830 - 01:00:52.430, Speaker A: And what about for the multicolateral die? What was the amount of that bounty?
01:00:54.450 - 01:01:13.794, Speaker C: I think we paid $50,000. In any buck bounty, you establish different criteria and then you go from the highest to the lowest. And so in this case, we did manage to pay out one of the highest that we set out for.
01:01:13.912 - 01:01:37.900, Speaker A: Okay. And so I wanted to also ask one other thing about the multilateral dialaunch because it's going to depend on Oracles, as far as I understand, just like the current version. Yes, but now there's a lot more Oracles. So how do you select Oracles and how do you ensure that they're trustworthy and can't be gamed to allow people to take advantage of the system?
01:01:38.750 - 01:02:23.654, Speaker C: Well, we have the Oracle's V Two proposal that is also going to have to be voted in via governance. But what we're going to do is we're moving away from the Oracles V One architecture that was built around two and a half years ago. So oracle's v two. They're a lot cheaper to run. They depend a lot on off chain message signing and on chain aggregation. And we are going to have the community vote on additional feed providers to the Oracles. We are still going to have certain number of those feed providers be anonymous.
01:02:23.654 - 01:02:57.174, Speaker C: Let's call it pseudonymous because there are a couple of people who know who they are, but for safety, their identity is not disclosed. But now we're going to have other projects become feed providers. And I think we announced this already. It was zero x Gnosis set. I'm going to forget one, sorry, but Maker was one and maybe one more. And we're going to be adding more of those because these projects, they already use the Maker Oracle's version one. So we're going to try to bring more and more projects in there.
01:02:57.174 - 01:03:41.060, Speaker C: One of the criticisms that I get a lot is that why don't we use purely on chain sources? I don't think we're there yet. There's not liquidity in order. Books or Uniswap can be game. I don't want to say game, but yeah, with not too much money you can move the market. But I am always on the lookout. I've talked to people from TBTC to Matt Longo, I've talked to Hart from uma, I don't remember who else, but I know that Haven from Uniswap. They're building Oracles into uniswap B two.
01:03:41.060 - 01:04:22.490, Speaker C: Balancer Finance is going to come out with some sort of price sensor, they call it. So we are getting there, but we're not quite there yet. So we're still going to do we have a blog post about our Oracle strategy. And I just want to say that in the current version of Dai, we use it for two or three things to of course check if your collateral is safe, if your ratio is safe. In multicolateral die, we only use it for that for like we don't use it when we liquidate because it's auction based. So we're trying to rely less and less on it. But we still have one point where of course we need to read from an Oracle.
01:04:22.650 - 01:04:36.120, Speaker A: Okay. All right, so we're really running out of time. But I do want to know before we leave, what are you most excited about what Dow is going forward? Like, what are you looking forward to either doing or seeing in the Dao space?
01:04:36.570 - 01:05:04.694, Speaker D: I'm really excited about how DAOs right. Which are really if you think about instant native. I'm really excited about how they're bringing people into the physical world, actually, because the metacartol dao has somehow incited and established this thing called MCON, where actually, soon after DevCon, we're actually going to Denver in person to be doing a short in person sprint on how to launch nextdao.
01:05:04.742 - 01:05:05.290, Speaker E: Right.
01:05:05.440 - 01:05:19.042, Speaker D: And it's just funny know everyone even though no one's being paid to do this, everyone thought it would be a good idea to do so to travel from all. These different countries and places to kind of meet in real life and work on this.
01:05:19.096 - 01:05:19.700, Speaker E: Right.
01:05:20.230 - 01:05:28.626, Speaker D: And it's interesting because, for example, there's several members of the Dow, right, which I've worked heavily in. They've worked quite a bit on the Metacardial Dao.
01:05:28.658 - 01:05:29.046, Speaker E: Right.
01:05:29.148 - 01:05:32.054, Speaker D: And I haven't even met them real life yet.
01:05:32.172 - 01:05:33.382, Speaker A: Right, but you will.
01:05:33.436 - 01:05:34.102, Speaker D: But I will.
01:05:34.156 - 01:05:34.422, Speaker E: Right.
01:05:34.476 - 01:05:45.078, Speaker D: And it's strange to see us being brought together into the physical from outside in right, by this community that can coordinate value, time and effort.
01:05:45.254 - 01:05:45.980, Speaker A: Cool.
01:05:47.390 - 01:06:08.660, Speaker C: In my case, just really on a social level, I want to see what decentralized finance can do for emerging economies like Argentina and other countries. On a technical level, there's so much that I couldn't just say one thing, but social level, I really want us to tackle problems in countries like Argentina, Venezuela and others.
01:06:09.190 - 01:06:26.614, Speaker A: Yeah. I urge people to watch Mariono's Talk from DevCon because it was great. I wanted to ask you a few questions about that, but I knew I had way too many questions about Dow, so I was like, I need to lay off those questions. But I watched it and yeah, it was awesome.
01:06:26.732 - 01:06:27.778, Speaker D: Thank you.
01:06:27.964 - 01:06:34.570, Speaker A: All right, so where can people learn more about you and Makerdow slash Saladao and MetaCartel?
01:06:34.910 - 01:06:54.740, Speaker C: So MakerDAO. You can go to makerdow.com or chat. makerdao.com. And me, Mariano. Personally, I'm at Nanicschool on Twitter, and you can follow me there to learn about my wacky experiments like the Sellout and other stuff.
01:06:55.830 - 01:07:08.950, Speaker D: You can always find me on Twitter at pet freerpan underscore. You can also search Medicato up and always online everywhere.
