00:00:00.200 - 00:00:25.816, Speaker A: The simple point is that when somebody says, I want l three s to build on my l two, what they're saying is they want to capture more value on their l two. I have no problem, by the way, with l three s. L three s will launch on Polygon. Pos, they'll launch on Polygon Cdk chains, they'll launch on top of polygons. Eqm. L three s can launch as much as they want if somebody finds it desirable. It's a permissionless system and it allows people to test, so I have no problem with that.
00:00:25.816 - 00:00:49.404, Speaker A: The statement was really about l two s who are trying to capture broader, more of the market. And if you think about l two s doing that at scale, in my opinion, it becomes problematic for Ethereum when everything gets built as an l three on top of one specific l two rather than across l two s, all of which are connecting to Ethereum.
