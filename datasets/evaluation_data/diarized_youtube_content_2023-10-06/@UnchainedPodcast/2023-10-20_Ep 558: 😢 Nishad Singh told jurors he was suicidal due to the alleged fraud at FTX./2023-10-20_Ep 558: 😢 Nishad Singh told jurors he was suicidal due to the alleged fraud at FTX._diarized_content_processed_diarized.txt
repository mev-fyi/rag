00:00:00.170 - 00:00:28.242, Speaker A: Nishad is pals with Gabe Bankman fried. Sam Bankman Fried younger brother, probably looked up to Sam Bankman fried. Then he's given the opportunity to work at Alameda and then FTX, although query whether that was an opportunity, but we'll call it an opportunity. And in his eyes, Sam is larger than life. He's older than him. Right. He's on a pedestal because he's the big brother, the friend of the big brother.
00:00:28.242 - 00:00:57.360, Speaker A: He's got this huge company. And he said he was intimidated by Sam. And he, unlike some of the other cooperators, it sounds like he was read into the fraud much later. September is when he's really starting to get read in. And I think him describing that, he looks up to Sam. He thought this was a good company. Now he's discovering that in reality, they're ripping people off.
00:00:57.360 - 00:00:57.980, Speaker A: That.
