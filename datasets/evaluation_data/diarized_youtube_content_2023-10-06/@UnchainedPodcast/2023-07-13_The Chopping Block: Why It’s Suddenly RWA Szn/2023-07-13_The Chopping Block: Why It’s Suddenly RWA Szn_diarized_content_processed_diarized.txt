00:00:00.330 - 00:00:02.442, Speaker A: Not a dividend, it's a tale of Tupan.
00:00:02.506 - 00:00:05.162, Speaker B: Now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet.
00:00:05.226 - 00:00:07.754, Speaker A: Generally speaking, airdrops are kind of pointless anyways.
00:00:07.882 - 00:00:10.618, Speaker B: Unnamed trading firms who are very involved.
00:00:10.714 - 00:00:12.830, Speaker C: Alec ETH is the ultimate on this.
00:00:12.900 - 00:00:15.840, Speaker D: DeFi protocols are the antidote to this problem.
00:00:17.330 - 00:00:18.062, Speaker E: Hello everyone.
00:00:18.116 - 00:00:37.010, Speaker B: Welcome to the chopping block. Every couple weeks, the four of us get together and give the industry insider's perspective on the crypto topics of the day. Quick intros. First we've got Tom, the DeFi maven and Master of Memes. Next he's got Robert, the crypto connoisseur and the Czar of Superstate. New intro for Robert, we'll be talking about it today. Then we've got Tarun, the gigabrain and grand Poobah at Gauntlet.
00:00:37.010 - 00:01:05.658, Speaker B: And today we've got a special guest, Blake, the real world asset ringleader at Goldfinch. And then finally you've got Myself. I'm haseeb the head Hype man at Dragonfly. So we are early stage investors in crypto, but I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice, legal advice, or even life advice. Please see Choppingblock XYZ for more disclosures. Blake, welcome to the show. We are going to do for the first time ever a real world asset show because crypto has gotten so boring and so uncool that we decided we kidding.
00:01:05.658 - 00:01:35.050, Speaker B: I'm kidding. Of course, it's big news that Robert announced the launch of his new company, Superstate, which we want to dive into a little bit on the show. But we thought it was a good opportunity to dive not just into what Robert's doing, but the broader landscape of real world assets. And we thought there was no better person to bring on board than Blake, who's been kind of an OG in the real world asset space and has been at it for a while. Blake, maybe we could start off with you giving an introduction about yourself and Goldfinch, what it is and what got you into the realm of real world assets.
00:01:35.470 - 00:02:21.314, Speaker F: Yeah, sure. So, first off, thanks so much for having me on the show. Big fan. And in terms of a quick background on myself, I used to work at Coinbase as an engineer back. I joined in 2018 and left in 2020 to start Goldfinch, which is a private credit platform built fully on Ethereum. Everything happens fully on chain. And from the very beginning we've been excited about doing what was now real world assets RWA and we were just at the time, I think, and still largely crypto is mostly kind of self referential landscape, right? And we felt like we really needed to kind of break out of the Matrix and we were just really excited about bringing the value of crypto to real businesses who were doing real stuff and maybe didn't have to already do with crypto.
00:02:21.314 - 00:02:38.430, Speaker F: And so that's what we've been doing since 2020, largely doing private credit lending to businesses in emerging markets, but also we have about 20% of the portfolio in America and so that's the thing. And I think your world assets is really the place where crypto has to go in order to grow in my mind.
00:02:38.580 - 00:03:11.970, Speaker B: So let me just step back a bit and define real world assets, because maybe for us, we know exactly what we're talking about. The history of real world assets in crypto goes back a very long time. I remember when I first got into the space, people were talking about real world assets. And at that time it was like asset tokenization and kind of the terms have evolved over time. As far as I know, the first real world asset to get tokenized and still the largest real world asset on chain is dollars, right? So technically every single stablecoin, except for algorithmic on chain stablecoins are basically real world assets. There's dollars in a bank, they're in the real world. That's why we call them real world assets.
00:03:11.970 - 00:04:09.434, Speaker B: There's something off chain that's being represented on chain, some kind of claim or some kind of kind of monetary equivalence between what's happening off chain and what's happening on chain. And then I remember there were things like Digix, which was an early attempt to tokenize gold. Tether has tokenized various other assets. Like, I think they had silver, they had other non USD currencies, but for the most part and then of course, I remember the 2017 cycle, then again in the 2021 cycle, a lot of excitement around, okay, can we tokenize real estate? Can we tokenize other kinds of assets like apartment complexes and boats and all sorts of things that maybe people might want liquidity for? And I think we've talked about on the show that I think in the past there's been some magical thinking, I think on behalf of a lot of people around asset tokenization, the idea that if I tokenize something, then magically it will become liquid. And there were a lot of companies that kind of got funded and kind of drove this excitement of this idea. They're like, wow, crypto trades 24/7 crypto. Anybody can buy and sell at any given time.
00:04:09.434 - 00:04:44.086, Speaker B: There are a lot of real world assets, like real estate that are really painful to transfer or to sell. Or there's all these documents they take forever, they don't work on weekends. And it's like, wow, can we bring the crypto magic or the on chain blockchain software based intermediation to all these traditional businesses? And I think this led to a lot of unrealistic expectations. A lot of people getting disappointed. They're like, hey, why hasn't there been more progress? It seems like still today, by far the largest market is dollars and not a lot else is working. So Robert, let me bring you in. Tell us about okay, that's kind of where we are.
00:04:44.086 - 00:04:50.518, Speaker B: I don't know if you disagree with that characterization. Tell us what led you to be like, cool, I'm going to go do superstate.
00:04:50.614 - 00:04:50.874, Speaker E: Sure.
00:04:50.912 - 00:05:13.434, Speaker D: So I'll start by saying that I hate the term real world assets because I don't think it describes the opportunity. So it also insults all of the assets in crypto that are crypto native assets. So I like to segment the world into two camps. One in which assets are issued on the blockchain for the first time. That's where they live, that's where they were created. Ether is a great example. It lives on a blockchain.
00:05:13.434 - 00:05:56.106, Speaker D: It doesn't live in like a database or a spreadsheet or something like that. All the tokens issued on Ethereum are crypto native assets. And then you have traditional assets which are issued on other ledgers, spreadsheets, physical paper, old ass, database software, things written in cobalt, whatever crypto native, and then traditional assets. Everything exists in the real world in my opinion. So I don't like to use the term, but I know a lot of people in crypto do use that term, but I just like to segment it real quickly between crypto native and things that are not native to blockchains. So what got me excited was actually the opposite of excitement. It actually goes back to 2017.
00:05:56.106 - 00:06:54.266, Speaker D: When I started compound in 2017, I thought that by 2022, five years later, the whole world was going to be tokenized. I remember when I pitched VCs in 2017, I was like, oh man, by 2022, in five years, everything's going to live on the blockchain. And so a market like compound or uniswap or whatever would be able to interact with all of these incredible assets where you could build one system, something like compound or something like uniswap or something like any protocol, and eventually more and more things would become interoperable with it. There'd be more assets, eventually would handle stocks, eventually would handle bonds, eventually would handle commodities, whatever. And that never really occurred because not that many things came on chain from off of the blockchain. Dollars, incredible use case, incredible product, market fit. We've seen $150,000,000,000 plus at given points of stablecoins.
00:06:54.266 - 00:07:39.326, Speaker D: Obviously there's a lot of demand for that and the invisible hand really pulled it onto the blockchain. But that's pretty much the only thing that's migrated over. So, you know, we have seen early signs of life for are things moving the other way, things moving off chain, right? And I'm really excited to talk with Blake about this, but when I look at Maker, when I look at goldfinch, a lot of times it's wealth from the blockchain getting sent to something not on the blockchain and kind of like this opposite direction migration. Obviously it builds a much more unified system and it's incredibly important and incredibly exciting and incredibly powerful. But it's oftentimes dollars moving the other way. Like Makerdow now has all of these real world assets or RWAs, but it's dollars moving away from the blockchain, away from the crypto. Nativity not onto it.
00:07:39.326 - 00:08:00.470, Speaker D: It's kind of like this reverse migration in a sense. And so the thing that got to me was saying well, it's been now six years, right? I originally thought it was going to be five years and everything would live on a blockchain. It's been six years. Nothing besides a simple dollar actually exists over here. And what can we do to help facilitate this migration?
00:08:00.890 - 00:08:02.738, Speaker B: Well, hold on, Robert, let me pause.
00:08:02.754 - 00:08:03.702, Speaker E: You there real quick.
00:08:03.836 - 00:08:08.434, Speaker B: Why do you think that is? What's your theory of the case of why other things haven't migrated onto the blockchain?
00:08:08.562 - 00:08:30.590, Speaker D: Well, I think it's a supply and demand problem. So I think this is really like the invisible hand of markets not getting people excited enough. Because when there's enough demand, when there's enough of a pain point, when there's enough excitement, it will happen. People will figure it out. The one thing that has gotten people moving, so to speak, are stablecoins. There is a clear demand for stablecoins. There's clear product, market fit.
00:08:30.590 - 00:09:03.080, Speaker D: That is a use case where the market ushered it into existence because so many people around the world demanded it or wanted it. I think when it comes to things like tokenized real estate, the demand is like microscopic still, right? There's very few people who are like, man, I'd kill for that skyscraper live on the blockchain. It's incredibly cool. Doing it is like achievement unlocked, but I don't know how many people demand it. I don't know how much capital demands it. I don't know how big the invisible hand is that wants to will it into existence. It's super cool.
00:09:03.080 - 00:09:12.874, Speaker D: But how much capital demand is there for that? I don't know. I don't think it's very high. And I think that's one of the reasons why we haven't seen more of this succeed.
00:09:13.002 - 00:09:52.198, Speaker F: I might also add, I think there's a lot of just like regulatory issues, especially for public assets to come on chain, right? Sort of like whatever the thing in Crossing the Chasm, where they talk about total cost of ownership, there's like the cost of actually using the product, but there's sort of the total cost of ownership that goes outside of the product, which for a lot of these funds and especially wealthier individuals or family offices who might be buying this type of asset. Well, there's also how does the accounting work and do I still get the same tax treatment? And this headache and brain damage of having to think about blockchain assets, I think is just too much for a lot of that stuff to have migrated over so quickly. And I think that's another piece just needs to get figured out before we're going to see the mass migration in my mind.
00:09:52.284 - 00:10:01.606, Speaker B: But it's also true for USDC, isn't it, that USDC, at least I think until recently, or I don't know if that has changed at all. But it's not treated as a currency for tax purposes.
00:10:01.638 - 00:10:02.220, Speaker E: Correct.
00:10:03.870 - 00:10:16.418, Speaker F: And the demand has largely come from crypto native people who probably don't need to think about all those same issues like they just go on Coinbase and they send in their dollars, they mint USDC, and they go about their can't hold it.
00:10:16.424 - 00:10:31.298, Speaker B: I don't yeah, yeah. Okay, so given that starting place, the two of you pursued different directions of which real world assets are the most interesting markets to pursue. Robert, let's start with your story for Superstate.
00:10:31.474 - 00:10:31.846, Speaker E: Go ahead.
00:10:31.868 - 00:10:40.842, Speaker C: Duran I'll add one thing disclosure, is that Robert de Nayo are small investors in goldfish. I realize we didn't say that anything.
00:10:40.896 - 00:10:43.526, Speaker D: We see may be very slightly biased.
00:10:43.638 - 00:10:45.242, Speaker B: And will be used against you.
00:10:45.376 - 00:10:46.106, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:10:46.288 - 00:10:46.810, Speaker E: All right.
00:10:46.880 - 00:10:51.722, Speaker B: Go ahead, Robert. Given this backdrop, why superstate?
00:10:51.866 - 00:12:15.714, Speaker D: Yeah, so in trying to solve this problem of why haven't things come on chain? For the most part, we're starting with the idea that it's because you have to go to where the demand is. And the way we see the demand right now are for not just dollars to come on chain, but low risk, highly liquid sources of yield to come on chain. And in a massive scalable way, where we sit, we think that treasuries and T bills and short term, extremely high quality instruments are what people want to hold on blockchains. And so what we're trying to facilitate is just the path for these types of assets to come onto the blockchain, not for the dollars that were on the blockchain to go off chain and then buy them, but for those assets in a regulatory structure to come onto the blockchain. So what we're doing is we're spending a lot of time focused on the legal and regulatory process to bring these assets on chain, because that's where we think that demand is. And over time, as there's more and more global demand for additional assets on chain, whether it's real estate or commodities or whatever, fill in the blank, ideally, there's a path to bring those assets on chain as well. And so really, it's a fund creation business with a structure that enables those funds to become crypto.
00:12:15.842 - 00:12:28.490, Speaker B: Okay, so, I mean, I get it. Rates are north of 5%. A lot of people, probably everybody in this thing included, we have some money getting short term interest from the government. You are not the first to do this.
00:12:28.560 - 00:12:28.794, Speaker E: Right.
00:12:28.832 - 00:12:39.310, Speaker B: So there's ondo Finance, which is the largest, I think that's kind of purely DeFi oriented there's. Franklin Templeton has some on chain thing on Stellar, I think, or something. I'm not totally certain.
00:12:39.380 - 00:12:40.640, Speaker F: Maple has one.
00:12:41.090 - 00:12:49.602, Speaker A: Yeah, I was going to say, this is being discussed on Twitter today, but the Franklin Temple thing is actually bigger than Ondo, which is like counterintuitive, almost.
00:12:49.656 - 00:12:52.226, Speaker C: Two X. Yeah, it's actually kind of crazy.
00:12:52.328 - 00:12:55.390, Speaker A: 300 million in money market ETF tokens.
00:12:55.470 - 00:13:03.926, Speaker C: On Stellar, maybe you can show the RWA XYZ Treasuries if you want to see that.
00:13:03.948 - 00:13:04.038, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:13:04.044 - 00:13:21.760, Speaker B: And so to be to the process right now, if you want to own one of these is you need to go whitelist your address. You need KYC whitelist your address and then you can go and buy these Treasuries and you get some yield on Stellar or in the case of Ondo on Ethereum can you zoom in a bit, Tom? Because I think it's pretty.
00:13:24.450 - 00:14:12.570, Speaker A: Frankel Templeton ondo Matrix stock, which is actually Matrix Ports product STPT it's like Tokenized Treasuries maple has this pool and I think this site is slightly off in that they count Flux Finance, which is Ondo's Compound fork. So it's a money market that they built that is whitelisted for Ondo products. So you can take your Tokenized money market ETF that you've onboarded and purchased through Ondo, put it into Flux and then borrow against it at a rate that is pretty attractive. I mean, you're paying half of margin rates on traditional brokerage and these people are also getting yield if you just put USDC in and you're not buying the treasury. So this is not actually Tokenized Treasuries, but it's being lent against Tokenized Treasuries and Flux.
00:14:12.910 - 00:14:27.678, Speaker F: I think something kind of interesting about it too. I believe that whole kind of market is partly there because the rates on Compound were like lower than what was getting paid out ondo. So people, I think, were basically leveraging that capital and then lending it into Flux who then borrow against it and.
00:14:27.684 - 00:14:29.234, Speaker E: Buy more ondo Treasuries right?
00:14:29.272 - 00:14:56.282, Speaker B: So there's an interest rate arbitrage that once people have access to treasury yield they can use that they can borrow against stablecoins and basically increase demand for stablecoins on chain which pushes up the interest rates on stablecoins and pushes them closer to parity. Obviously they're not going to get exactly to parity but it does mean that the rate on stablecoins should get closer to that risk free rate which is not really possible when you don't have treasuries on chain at all. Now the Treasuries on chain right now it's on the order of like a few hundred million, right?
00:14:56.336 - 00:14:59.820, Speaker F: Maybe 500 million if you a little over 100 themselves.
00:15:00.270 - 00:15:18.994, Speaker B: Yeah and then Franklin Templeton is like close to 300 or something like that. So right now the outstanding supply of stablecoins obviously in the tens of billions it's a massive, massive amount of stablecoins out there. So there is no way right now just with the differential and how many Treasuries are out there to actually do the interest rate arbitrage and push the yield on stable coins up.
00:15:19.032 - 00:15:20.578, Speaker E: But okay, there are a lot of.
00:15:20.584 - 00:15:28.440, Speaker B: People doing this, Robert what are they doing wrong? Why do you need to come in and fix what these people the mistakes these people are?
00:15:28.970 - 00:16:16.562, Speaker D: And the first thing to say is that there's obviously room for many different approaches and many different companies, right? Like, there's both Vanguard and Fidelity and both of them are managing trillions upon trillions of dollars, right? It's not that anyone's doing anything wrong we're just taking an approach that's slightly different. So there's really two names you've already mentioned, franklin Templeton and ando superstate's somewhere in the middle of the two of these. So Franklin Templeton is going the route of creating registered investments where they file a prospectus and then it's available to be purchased by anybody. Ondo is going a different route where they're relying on exemptions from registration and saying you have to be a qualified purchaser, which means you have to have $5 million to purchase their fund. Ando is super ethereum. Native. Franklin templeton is on stellar.
00:16:16.562 - 00:16:55.002, Speaker D: Superstate is kind of the hybrid of these two approaches where it's a registered approach where we're creating a registered investment. We submitted a draft prospectus, a preliminary prospectus to the SEC about two weeks ago. So it's a registered approach, not an exemption from registration so that it can be held by anybody. The goal is to be a very Ethereum Native on chain component. And so it's kind of in the middle of those two. And we believe that's something that the market is going to want, which is something know has a clear registration statement and is Ethereum Native as sort of the best of both worlds. And we'll see how it plays out over the next couple months, years, decades.
00:16:55.002 - 00:16:57.562, Speaker D: But that's the approach in a nutshell.
00:16:57.706 - 00:17:03.026, Speaker F: Robert, actually, I'm curious what kind of access is going to be possible on this fund? Who can purchase it?
00:17:03.128 - 00:17:03.394, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:17:03.432 - 00:17:03.730, Speaker B: US.
00:17:03.800 - 00:17:07.090, Speaker D: Investors or offshore investors with US. Addresses.
00:17:07.250 - 00:17:08.550, Speaker F: Retail investors?
00:17:09.370 - 00:17:09.734, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:17:09.772 - 00:17:32.042, Speaker B: So basically, anybody who can buy a mutual fund today, they can buy a stake in the superstake fund. But a smart contract or an AI or a Dao or whatever, they would not be able to directly own the Superstate mutual fund. All right, so let me take a step back. So I think we understand the approach. Let me ask kind of a broader philosophical question.
00:17:32.096 - 00:17:35.342, Speaker E: Is, like, why is it good to.
00:17:35.396 - 00:17:47.054, Speaker B: Have more tokenized Treasuries on chain? Maybe let's just start there. And I kind of want to dig into this discussion because I think it's actually quite interesting. Robert, why is it good to bring tokenized Treasuries on chain?
00:17:47.182 - 00:17:52.740, Speaker D: Well, if you zoom out and look super abstractly, why is it good to have a blockchain at?
00:17:54.710 - 00:17:57.894, Speaker B: Is that is that where we're let's start.
00:17:57.932 - 00:17:59.174, Speaker D: Let's start really low, right?
00:17:59.212 - 00:17:59.654, Speaker B: Okay, cool.
00:17:59.692 - 00:18:30.846, Speaker D: So really foundational. I think having assets that are administered and owned and tracked on blockchains is better than traditional ledgers. It's better than the stack that they currently reside in, in Tri, because in the end run, you're able to get more from them. You're able to get all of the composability of DeFi. You're able to get all of the automation of smart contracts. You're able to get the transparency of a blockchain where every action that's ever occurred is auditable. Plus the programmable open source nature of it.
00:18:30.846 - 00:18:57.880, Speaker D: You're able to get the instant settlement. You're able to get the massive speed and portability advantages over prior ledgers. Having things on a blockchain is super. Super good, right? And so having the old assets, the TradFi assets move over and start to live on the blockchain more and more and more over time is just overall going to be a net benefit for society, for investors, for regulators, for everybody.
00:18:58.250 - 00:19:33.902, Speaker F: I can also add a little color because I actually talked with the Franklin Templeton people months back. We were actually kind of looking to do a Treasury's product as well and Gulf Venge and we talked with the Franklin Templeton, they spent quite a long time getting the SEC comfortable with this fund. They started it a while ago. For them it was actually originally sort of like almost a science experiment. They were just like, hey, let's do something on the blockchain. This was like years ago when the rates were still zero and they didn't really expect anybody to use it but they were like, well let's go through the halling process because it takes quite a while to register the fund. Anyway, they spent all this time and they were talking to SEC, well how are we going to subpoena you for records? And they're like it's right here, it's right there, you just need to look at it.
00:19:33.902 - 00:19:50.600, Speaker F: And told me that once they actually been running this for a while, their actual cost of operating the fund are substantially lower from what it costs them to administer a traditional fund. So I think this other Robert is talking about is spot on and we had some evidence already of that from Franklin Templeton, at least from the phone calls I had with them a couple of months ago.
00:19:50.970 - 00:19:51.720, Speaker E: Interesting.
00:19:52.170 - 00:20:59.758, Speaker B: Let me maybe propose a counterpoint that I was just thinking about actually while I was taking a shower this morning when we were preparing for the show. Is that so? Right now in DeFi, right? So we talked about this interest rate arbitrage. It's not really being done yet because there aren't enough tokenized Treasuries on chain when this interest rate arbitrage successfully happens and the rates on chain go up. Another way of thinking about that is that what the Fed has been doing for the last two years is they've been raising interest rates and because they've been raising interest rates they've been kind of crushing investment. I mean we're all VCs, we're all investing less. The incentive to take risk, incentive to innovate, all that stuff goes down because it gets crowded out by basically just government paper, right? And so effectively what the government is saying is invest less, take less risk and instead just give your money to me and I'll hold onto it and cool down the economy. And so when you are bringing more tokenized Treasuries on chain, basically what you're doing is you're raising the on chain interest rate, right? You are basically playing that intercessory role of bridging what the Fed is doing in the real economy and bringing it to the onchain economy and telling the onchain economy hey, invest less, slow down.
00:20:59.758 - 00:21:25.638, Speaker B: Don't invest so much in growth and instead put your money with the US government and just have it sit there and kind of do nothing because we want to slow down the economy. This is going to make yield farming more expensive. It's going to make token issuances or like token emissions more expensive. Is that not going to yeah, it may bring more tokenized Treasuries on chain and maybe it's oh great, it's so efficient for on chain mutual funds for Treasuries. But isn't that going to result in slowing down the rate of innovation on.
00:21:25.644 - 00:21:27.974, Speaker E: The blockchain or it'll speed it up.
00:21:28.012 - 00:21:30.102, Speaker D: Because people have to create entirely new things.
00:21:30.236 - 00:21:38.986, Speaker F: Yeah, I don't know if the rate of innovation is quite the right metric there to go with the interest rates going up because it's taking quite a lot of innovation just to do it.
00:21:39.088 - 00:21:49.630, Speaker B: Yeah, but it is directly tied to the cost of capital, right? I mean, the cost of capital on chain goes up, it's harder to get USDC to provide liquidity for a blah blah blah. I mean, you can argue whether that is innovation.
00:21:49.970 - 00:21:50.446, Speaker E: I don't know.
00:21:50.468 - 00:21:51.390, Speaker B: Tom, what's your take?
00:21:51.460 - 00:22:49.954, Speaker A: I think you're sort of positioning us as either or like either your assets are in Treasuries or they're being deployed elsewhere, invested elsewhere. And I think I actually kind of think look at like staked ETH and liquid staking derivatives as sort of a comp of the ETH yields is basically the risk free rate, right? Like block emissions plus transaction fees and that competes with everything else. So hey, it's not super attractive to loan out my ETH for 1% when I can stake it and earn four or 5% or something like that. And that's true for everything, right? If I have my ETH sitting in like blur waiting to bid on an NFT, or if I have my ETH sitting in a dow and waiting to commission a proposal. And so instead of the current trend actually is replacing ETH with liquid staking derivatives like staked ETH. And so the two sort of compose so I can have my ETH, I can get my yield, and I can use it in all these different other places as well where I might normally use vanilla ETH. And so instead, these rates actually sort of compose with each other and complement each other.
00:22:49.954 - 00:23:06.054, Speaker A: And so I think similarly we could probably see a similar thing with these tokenized Treasuries or something like Fluxusdc where, hey, if I'm using this as collateral to trade on some decentralized perps venue, I don't have to sacrifice the risk free rate in order to trade perps. The two can actually sort of compose with each other.
00:23:06.172 - 00:23:27.994, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I think another natural thing in that vein is that staking derivatives didn't completely crush everything else, right? There's still enough liquidity in other assets. A lot of it definitely went away. I think the bigger question is just more like how well can these high rates diffuse through the existing DeFi ecosystem?
00:23:28.042 - 00:23:28.254, Speaker B: Right?
00:23:28.292 - 00:24:20.542, Speaker C: Like the real advantage of staking derivatives is they are basically more or less equivalent to ETH in DeFi. From the perspective of most of DeFi, there's really not a difference between ETH and a bunch of the staking derivatives. But the treasury assets are a little bit weirder, right? They do have some restrictions. You have to go through this sort of indirect route of borrowing against them. There's clearly some friction to them diffusing through the ecosystem. And so that's the thing I think would be more interesting. I don't know if I buy the Token emissions have to go up type of argument, though, because what will end up happening is if fees are denominated in that if those Tokens have some claim to fees, well, if the rates went up and they have something where they're collecting fees denominated in that asset, they should be earning more too.
00:24:20.542 - 00:24:45.574, Speaker C: Right? I'm not saying it's perfectly reflexive in that sense, but if they're able to utilize those assets and charge fees in those assets terms, they should be at least earning some of the beta to the growth of that asset. Now, if the protocol is not able to do that, then that's different. But I think maybe from the perspective of innovation, that would be the part of innovation that probably would have to happen.
00:24:45.612 - 00:24:53.162, Speaker B: Which I love your assumption that protocols charge fees. It's a very charming model of how the blockchain works.
00:24:53.216 - 00:25:20.498, Speaker C: No, but the LPs earn fees, right? And the LPs are also earning the farming asset. It's not totally clear to me that you have to overcompensate. In fact, you may have to compensate them less in the native token because they're getting more raw rewards in the treasury asset that they're earning fees in. Right, if they're earning fees in fusdc, it's like I'm just saying I don't.
00:25:20.504 - 00:25:33.474, Speaker B: Think it's I think the reality though is that look, if you're farming, you have to farm in stablecoins because you need it to be open and permissionless, right? Presumably, I mean, maybe not, I don't know, maybe there's some world where you can be KYC and have on chain treasuries.
00:25:33.602 - 00:26:17.062, Speaker A: Yeah, I think there's a lot of people now launching CDP platforms or basically forks of liquidity or whatever that use liquid staking derivatives as collateral instead of ether and those are quickly rising as the dominant form of collateral. I think Aave is now over ETH makers staked ETH is about to overtake ETH as the main form of collateral so the two can compose. And I think again, as long as you have players who sort of bridge these two markets, the rates should converge, right? Like you have something like Flux USDC and then you have the actual tokenized treasuries themselves. And so yeah, they're not going to be on par, but anybody can go and use Flux USDC to go do farming if they want and. In theory, they should all become more liquid over time.
00:26:17.196 - 00:26:47.822, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, another sort of reverse experiment of the thing you're talking about is in 2021 when rates were basically zero and crypto rates were very high and suddenly traditional finance people were able to access the crypto rates via centralized entities. Now of course, that didn't work out the way they planned, but they were able to access it and they immediately went towards that and it actually had sort of this feedback loop effect, some of it good, some of it bad.
00:26:47.876 - 00:26:48.574, Speaker F: A lot of it bad.
00:26:48.612 - 00:27:04.754, Speaker C: But I think you should expect the same thing. I think at the end of the day, if an asset is really good collateral and taken everywhere and has positive yield and negative carry and low carry costs, people gravitate to that.
00:27:04.792 - 00:27:04.994, Speaker E: Right?
00:27:05.032 - 00:27:05.442, Speaker C: That's it.
00:27:05.496 - 00:27:52.786, Speaker B: Well, it's a very interesting point to run because you're sort of analogizing, okay, well, raising the rates on chain is kind of like what Terra was doing of having these really high rates that are kind of pulling capital into crypto and that capital then disseminates and the cost of capital gets lower in crypto. That argument works if there's a differential between the interest rate off chain and the interest rate on chain. Right. In this case, the interest rate on chain is actually lower than the interest rate off chain. And what the tokenized treasuries are doing is they're equalizing the interest rate across the two. My mental model of capital on chain, and this might be part of why I think we might be looking at this differently, my mental model of capital off chain or sorry, on chain is that there's really like two kinds of capital. There's opportunistic capital that is just looking for yield and they're know just kind of cutthroat hedge funds and they'll do whatever.
00:27:52.786 - 00:28:41.538, Speaker B: And then there's like capital that's kind of stuck on chain which know people in China who know, they're just like, look, I want dollars and tether is the best way to hold those dollars. And so that capital is captive and they'll take whatever rate they can get. So if their best rate is 2% on compound, it's like, great, I'm going to get 2% on compound. I'm not going to be able to KYC and get the 5% from superstate, so I'm just going to live with the 2%. So be it or maybe I'll take a little more risk and put it into private credit through goldfinch. But that capital isn't moving, right? And so that black hole of pulling in more capital from off chain that Terra was doing, I think it's not likely we're going to see that just because we have tokenized treasuries on chain that those actors, even if you live in Hong Kong, you can get access to treasury yield from Hong Kong, no problem, right. It's not something that you have to be in the US.
00:28:41.538 - 00:28:42.834, Speaker B: To get access to.
00:28:42.952 - 00:28:44.354, Speaker E: What do you think of that take?
00:28:44.552 - 00:29:33.246, Speaker C: Yeah, I agree that there's some version of that that's true. But I do think, like, suppose there's another bull run ETH price goes up, suddenly the USD ETH staking rate looks significantly more attractive than Treasuries. But maybe I actually want to hold a portfolio that's like 60 40 e USD, but I don't want my USD portfolio to be only a carry cost for me effectively. I do actually want to be earning some nominal yield. This is a perfect product for that, right? And my point is, people rebalancing into the bull and bears, they're not going to be like, I'm going out of ETH completely to stablecoin or vice other than board apes owners. They're not going to be kind of doing that, right. They're going to have this kind of in between, but they kind of want yield on both sides.
00:29:33.246 - 00:29:53.586, Speaker C: And I think it makes the rebalancing costs actually a lot more palatable. And as these portfolios get larger, especially due to staking rewards kind of spreading through the ecosystem, you definitely could imagine that this has a place as viable collateral to compete with USDC or Tether.
00:29:53.698 - 00:30:02.778, Speaker B: So Blake, let's bring you in. Give us the know we talked about Treasuries. Give us the case for private credit, an attractive real world asset to bring on chain.
00:30:02.954 - 00:30:04.222, Speaker E: Why private credit?
00:30:04.356 - 00:30:53.562, Speaker F: Yeah, I think it's actually a good kind of compliment here because as Robert was saying, bringing these treasury yields on chain, I think everyone would agree that's largely a product for crypto native investors, right, for the people who are already on chain. Because for the most part, what ondo is doing, they're literally giving you a BlackRock ETF and they're adding 15 bips and then saying, here you go, now you can buy it on chain. So people from the off chain world, whereas with traditional finance, they're not going to be taking their dollars and bringing it on chain to buy the ondo product. Generally speaking, I would think this is my default case. However, because Nanasol is very, very publicly available, it's really, really easy for anyone to try to get access to their rate already. The private credit thing, on the other hand, is actually very hard to access. Generally speaking, especially for a more like kind of normal, everyday investor, it's very, very difficult to access.
00:30:53.562 - 00:31:20.110, Speaker F: And so this is sort of the whole other end of the spectrum where it's not public, it's very hard to access, and it's very bespoke too. And it takes sort of a lot of expertise to be able to look at these deals and decide whether or not they're good or not. And so that's where we actually, again, with our whole thing, we want to bring people who are outside the crypto space into the crypto realm. And so offering these private credit deals, we want to bring investors who aren't already into crypto and bring them on chain through an asset.
00:31:20.190 - 00:31:23.560, Speaker B: Can you give us an example of a private credit deal. Just so I mean a lot of people might not know exactly.
00:31:24.410 - 00:31:59.330, Speaker F: So really private credit is just doing lending to businesses by large. And so an example of a borrower that was on Goldfish was a company called PayJoy. They do smartphone financing in Mexico and so you buy a phone from them, they'll pay for it and then you pay pay them back over the next two years or whatever and you do monthly installments and if you don't pay back they happen to have software on the phone that will shut off your phone. And so everyone wants their phone to work, people pay it back. And so you can do that with tons of businesses all over the place. That was sort of specific fintech lending business. But you can do it with invoice receivables, you can do it with real estate, you can do it with all kinds of stuff.
00:31:59.330 - 00:32:30.766, Speaker F: Goldfish tends to focus on fintech lenders as our main borrowers. But that's just the rough idea of private credit. And private credit as asset class by the way, has just been growing like crazy. And this is, I would say generally a really exciting time for private credit because as the rates go up that actually pushes up. That's like the floor of rates that every business in the world needs to pay. And so all of the rates that everyone is paying have gone up by basically four or 5% in the last couple of years. So you have really high quality companies offering 10% plus yield and of course that is going to take on more risk than going to the Treasuries but it's also much higher year.
00:32:30.766 - 00:32:55.470, Speaker F: You're not talking about 10% plus. And in a world where the stock market is kind of questionable and you're not really sure is this going to be a good year or bad year, people are starting to reallocate their portfolios to thing like bonds then private credit. All of sudden A is be really attractive and you have people like KKR and Blackrocks. Everybody is really doubling down on private credit. Now. This is kind of like a golden period of private credit or the golden age. And so we think this is a great time to be offering private credit to people and we're going to still be doing it fully on chain.
00:32:55.470 - 00:33:42.580, Speaker F: We actually, I'd say different than a lot of other places. We want to be focusing actually kind of more away from the crypto native investors into a more mainstream investor. We're going to be trying to take advantage of things like layer twos and account abstraction and embedded wallets to make the experience really, really seamless. And we want to bring that kind of normal mainstream investor, have them barely even realize they're doing everything fully on chain in a self custodial manner, but get access to this deal that they can't get anywhere else. And so them, I think that's a good way to bring more people in because again, it's not this thing they can just go onto their Fidelity account and get it's something that's unique to what we're doing. And also in terms of investors, if we can take capital directly from investors anywhere in the world, there's all sorts of payment processor fees that don't have to take place on chain and then eventually we can get all these other benefits of interoperability and transparency and stuff that Robert's been talking about.
00:33:43.190 - 00:34:27.550, Speaker C: One actual other thing that I think might be worth mentioning to our listeners is the private credit market, say in 2022 and 2021, a lot of it was actually serviced by banks like Silicon Valley Bank. And I think once they kind of had their explosion in February, it became clear that a lot of these credit opportunities had to be funded by fully private entities versus pseudo private entities like FDI Insured Bank. And I think that has contributed in a way to the boom. I mean blake yeah, it seems like that has been one of the big drivers I've heard of.
00:34:27.700 - 00:35:11.594, Speaker F: So that boom is actually and that story you're bringing up of banks used to doing this lending and sort of receding away from it that's actually been going on since the financial crisis in 2008. After those new regulations came into place, banks were basically asked to hold on to more cash and more safe assets. And so if you look at their balance sheets, their balance sheets have actually shifted up about 20% in cash and their lending has kind of gone down, right? And they're just sort of flipping. And so that's like a huge amount of money. It's like over a trillion dollars worth of lending that was taking place ten years ago or 15 years ago and isn't now. And so private credit has been just continuing to fill the gap over the last 15 years. And so you have all these different private credit funds and stuff who kind of specialize in their different niches of, okay, I'm going to focus on Fintechs in this region.
00:35:11.594 - 00:35:31.238, Speaker F: Okay, I'm going to focus on trade finance in this region. And they really learn to understand that business and that industry and they learn specifics of what kind of stuff they need to put into their loan documents to make those as safe as possible. And that is where we've seen this just explosion of private credit over it's really last 15 years. It's not just the last two, but the last 2 may have accelerated it.
00:35:31.404 - 00:35:33.366, Speaker B: So, taking a step back, the real.
00:35:33.388 - 00:35:35.894, Speaker E: World asset story, when I hear from.
00:35:35.932 - 00:36:23.302, Speaker B: Large institutions, right, whether it's the blackrocks of the world, I mean, you can see in Larry Fink's annual letter, he talks about asset tokenization being a big story. You see it from Goldman Sachs, you see it from Wellington, you see it from a lot of these really large groups are looking very closely at the idea of bringing real world assets on chain. That said, it's taken a while and things haven't we're not seeing explosive growth. Things are growing and things maybe are going to start working, but we're waiting for that moment when this stuff really starts to kick into gear. If and when it does, and let's take it for granted for the moment that it does, what happens downstream when all of a sudden you have large private credit market on chain, when all of a sudden you have very large pools of treasuries on chain? What does that change? Besides the obvious thing of oh, interest rates on chain go up? What else changes?
00:36:23.356 - 00:36:24.310, Speaker E: Because of that?
00:36:24.460 - 00:37:06.866, Speaker F: I think all of a sudden you have interoperability of these assets. You have a lot more transparency which should be able to increase the accuracy of the pricing that can take place. Because historically if someone's holding on to a private credit asset that's in some random funds book that no one knows. And most of these funds, they're not even tech enabled by and large, right? It's not like they're not on chain. They're just not even on computers, right? They're usually holding documents in some custody partner that they work with or they're holding themselves. And so I think getting all this stuff on chain is going to drastically increase the amount of information we have about these loans to be able to see the payments coming back from the borrowers, right? And you say, okay, yeah, this thing's been paying back all the time. Loan documents can be pointed to through URLs that you can put on chain, that kind of thing.
00:37:06.866 - 00:37:38.014, Speaker F: Which should just, I think really help facilitate these marks. Now you said before, and I think it's true, it's not like this stuff is going to magically be liquid, right? And from private credit and real estate, all this stuff is very, very bespoke, right? Like even one house over in the same neighborhood is not the same house. You can't just assume it's the same pricing. But I do think as you bring more of this stuff on chain you can start having things that are probably built on top to help increase that liquidity. Like ratings agencies and things that are looking this stuff and be like, okay, this stuff, it's been underwritten by this team, they're pretty good. They have this long track record which we can see. This borrower also has a long track record.
00:37:38.014 - 00:38:48.914, Speaker F: It's other stuff, we can see all this stuff and I'm going to call this B grade whatever, right? And now if you can really bring all these different private assets and call it under one risk category, then I think you can actually really legitimately create a lot of liquidity. But I think it's going to bol because this is kind of like multi step process of we get the stuff on chain and then once it's on chain, then I think other people can probably build on top. You kind of raising things that can help increase the liquidity but also just nice stuff around, moving money around quicker if people actually send money from one thing to another. One thing that was interesting about a recent goldfinch loan, we did this callable structure with a company in Singapore called FAS and that callable structure is this thing where investors have the right to call back their capital whenever they want, know every quarter they have like a redemption, right, basically. And for a regular borrower that's a pretty annoying thing operationally to do if you have lots and lots of investors, right, because you'd have to have different bank account information from people in different parts of the world and how do you handle all that? Who's going to pay for it? But in blockchain world we tell them, hey look, it doesn't matter how many investors we end up getting like one payment to one smart contract every quarter. It's all you need to do. And operationally that's a much easier lift for them.
00:38:48.914 - 00:39:17.280, Speaker F: And that is I call a liquidity enhancing structure that is really only possible through something like the blockchain. And so I think you just get a lot of these nice little benefits that can add up over time. But I also generally view the blockchain as like this it's a social technology, right? Like it's more powerful the more people who believe in it and the more people who are using it. And so it's this slow kind of exponential thing until we actually start seeing a lot of people use it where that interoperability comes into play. So that's why I think it's surprising all of us at how long it's taking.
00:39:17.970 - 00:40:09.598, Speaker B: It seems like another big difference. So you mentioned digitizing a lot of these businesses, kind of pulling them forward into the 21st century, let's say same time making things more trustworthy, making things more transparent, making things always online and very easy to execute for just trusting the cash flows of these businesses that otherwise would be very difficult to underwrite. Another thing that seems to me to be a direct consequence of getting more real world assets on chain is a different class of consumer coming on chain than who's there today. Today most of the people who are on chain are speculators just by volume. Obviously there are some people who are on chain because they want to just hold some USDC and they want to have some safe assets or they want to hold some bitcoin and they're not really speculating per se. But a lot of the people who came on Chain over the last few years are basically there to gamble. And having a set of users who.
00:40:09.604 - 00:40:11.774, Speaker E: Are there to make more or less.
00:40:11.812 - 00:40:22.420, Speaker B: Sound financial decisions and basically save for the real world really changes the kinds of products that we can start offering on Chain and actually get adoption with. And how do you guys think about that?
00:40:23.430 - 00:40:54.714, Speaker F: I think 1000%, and this is a big reason as well as why we are trying to make this shift really increase the user experience so that we can go after this mainstream audience that you're talking about. Because the Djens who are on there today, they want ten to 15% like a day and fundamentally the product we're offering is ten to 15% a year, right? And so we just can't sell to those people and so we have to sell to a more mainstream investor who wants to make these sound financial decisions. As you were saying, we want to give them the opportunity to do so. We want to do it on chains. We want to be building this whole platform for the future where we see everything headed.
00:40:54.842 - 00:41:01.546, Speaker B: Robert, what's your take on that? What do you think changes when you start getting more kind of risk averse investors coming on chain?
00:41:01.738 - 00:42:14.342, Speaker D: Well, I think what winds up happening is it winds up being a more permanent overall financial marketplace when there's many different types of customers, many different types of investors, many different types of end users all looking for different things, right? Like the more use cases and the more sort of end users in one place, the better and the more things are just going to happen and the more connections get made and products evolve and the assets evolve as well. So I think increasing the diversity of end users is only going to be a good thing, right, because they'll stick around and do something different and they'll use another product and they'll put money somewhere else and they'll reinvest something and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah and it all compounds. And so the long term outcome is just going to be like, I think of like 15 years and I'm really bad at this because I used to think we'd have all the real world assets on chain right now, so I'd be totally wrong. But I think in like 15 years it'll just be like, oh, everything is here, right? It's just like Wall Street three. It's just like just where things operate. And they don't operate on the paper and pencil way anymore, they just operate here.
00:42:14.476 - 00:42:14.774, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:42:14.812 - 00:42:39.994, Speaker F: I think it'll decrease the volatility of the space substantially because as Robert saying, when you have this diversity of use cases and people doing it for different reasons, then okay, well, just because XYZ tokens aren't doing well anymore, it's risk off. That doesn't mean you leave crypto land you stay on because, oh, well, now I can get private credit, now I can get treasury yield, now I can hopefully eventually get public equities and things like that. I think it'll just really decrease the volatility, make it more of a real economy.
00:42:40.122 - 00:43:07.222, Speaker C: Yeah. I think to this point earlier about the type you're talking about treasuries of like, oh, why wouldn't I just leave crypto and go buy it? If the rebalancing cost is just so low to do it without leaving, then you won't leave. Right. And I think that gets to this point. Blake's me transaction costs for this stuff are not zero, especially for the kind of not Djen stuff, in the sense.
00:43:07.276 - 00:43:18.534, Speaker B: That in the back of my mind, I'm like, oh, that's also what casinos say of, like, cheap drinks to keep you in the casino for the real moneymakers, which is get you to buy JPEGs.
00:43:18.662 - 00:43:24.620, Speaker C: That's human nature, though. I think that make it more in your face.
00:43:25.070 - 00:43:30.666, Speaker B: Of course, Robert and Blake are the bartenders who are keeping everybody past midnight.
00:43:30.778 - 00:43:32.400, Speaker F: Yeah. I was going to say.
00:43:34.450 - 00:43:34.926, Speaker E: The two.
00:43:34.948 - 00:43:50.930, Speaker F: Approaches like Robert and what we're doing, they come together. They really are complementary in the sense that if we're bringing someone on to do private credit, some of their portfolio, they may want to say, I've got some dry powder. What do I do with this before the next investment? Well, maybe they're investing in know through superstate.
00:43:51.010 - 00:43:51.206, Speaker E: Right.
00:43:51.228 - 00:43:54.834, Speaker F: And that's a really good combo. Right. We want to be able to that's made in heaven.
00:43:54.882 - 00:43:55.880, Speaker D: Blake yeah.
00:43:57.610 - 00:44:00.282, Speaker B: So they're not buying any JPEGs is what you're telling me.
00:44:00.416 - 00:44:01.740, Speaker F: Well, not the.
00:44:03.790 - 00:44:22.270, Speaker C: Mean. To be fair, one of the funniest tweets I saw this week was someone complaining about how people aren't trying to acquire failed NFT projects and they have no exits. And it's like, what were you thinking? Obviously there's no exit. What are they buying? The discord?
00:44:23.570 - 00:44:27.278, Speaker B: You're talking about selling the issuers or selling the collections?
00:44:27.454 - 00:44:37.918, Speaker C: I think it's like the issuers technically had companies that receive the ETH or multi sigs that receive the ETH and they want to sell whatever they think they are.
00:44:38.024 - 00:44:41.750, Speaker D: The NFT holders do or the owners of the projects do.
00:44:41.820 - 00:44:49.510, Speaker C: Owners of the like there were just people lamenting, like, there's no M A for NFT projects. And I was like, what are you talking about?
00:44:49.660 - 00:45:02.158, Speaker D: So if somebody makes, like, sad apes right. And, like, obviously it's some knockoff and nobody wants it, the sad ape owner is looking for somebody to take over the sad ape project that has already fizzled out.
00:45:02.324 - 00:45:03.040, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:45:05.410 - 00:45:06.160, Speaker B: Wow.
00:45:07.090 - 00:45:07.840, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:45:08.610 - 00:45:24.830, Speaker B: Very weird industry. Just one more thing that I wanted to touch on. So you guys were talking about okay, we're starting with tokenized credit. Private credit or sorry, tokenized. Treasuries private credit. Maybe eventually we'll get to public equities. I was just thinking of Mirror.
00:45:24.830 - 00:46:05.582, Speaker B: So for those of you who don't know, mirror was one of the projects in the Terra ecosystem. It was basically, like, basically building perps on us. Treasuries and this was a meme for a long time. And something that we took a lot of interest in is this idea that, look, if you take these Delta One derivatives that people love in crypto and you just wrap them around traditional assets, you can basically create synthetic forms of just about anything as long as you have a price feed. And you can do it for bitcoin, obviously with a perp, but with a petrol swap. But you can do it for any asset so long as you have an index. And there was a moment when some of these things were getting some traction or when people were excited about synthetics, people were excited about mirror, and they all kind of fizzled out.
00:46:05.582 - 00:46:10.526, Speaker B: And it does seem like this is probably the best theory for why, which.
00:46:10.548 - 00:46:12.506, Speaker E: Is that there was nobody on Chain.
00:46:12.538 - 00:46:26.774, Speaker B: Who actually wanted to make sound financial decisions. And that basically the part of your portfolio that you were acting like an adult with. You were not bringing on chain, you were keeping that in your brokerage account or whatever. And the stuff you bring on Chain, you're like, hey yo, I'm here to gamble, I'm here to farm, I'm here to do whatever, but I'm not here.
00:46:26.812 - 00:46:30.614, Speaker E: To buy some Apple stock and hope.
00:46:30.652 - 00:46:34.602, Speaker B: That the sort of the I totally agree.
00:46:34.656 - 00:46:45.738, Speaker A: I think it's also sort of the same reason why we haven't seen like, on Chain index funds work. It's like no one's trying to diversify their portfolio on Chain, they're trying to go 100 x long pepe. It's just a very different sort of mindset.
00:46:45.834 - 00:46:49.146, Speaker D: They diversify with apes and maladys.
00:46:49.258 - 00:46:55.220, Speaker B: Right, true. Which actually is where that diversification actually may have worked out.
00:46:56.790 - 00:47:00.210, Speaker C: What is the 60 40 portfolio of NFTs.
00:47:02.870 - 00:47:04.370, Speaker D: Apes and maladys?
00:47:05.190 - 00:47:06.678, Speaker B: That is absolutely correct.
00:47:06.844 - 00:47:12.118, Speaker C: No, but what ratio? What ratio? No, you have to come up 60 40.
00:47:12.204 - 00:47:14.114, Speaker D: 60 ape 40 mulaney.
00:47:14.242 - 00:47:15.478, Speaker C: Okay, wow.
00:47:15.564 - 00:47:17.702, Speaker B: Yeah, you might be 80 20 the opposite direction now.
00:47:17.756 - 00:47:18.600, Speaker E: I don't know.
00:47:20.670 - 00:47:37.146, Speaker B: Yeah, auto rebalancing. Auto rebalancing. Okay. There's one more story I wanted to cover today. So there's a company called Arkham, which is kind of a blockchain intelligence company. They do kind of a bunch of data that you can see about what's happening on the blockchain. And so they had a token launch.
00:47:37.146 - 00:48:29.966, Speaker B: So they're launching a token, which I had not realized that they have a need for a token, but apparently they do. So they're launching a token, I think, on binance launchpad or something. And this token, well, first there was some kerfuffle because they have some referral program where you can post a link to like, hey, sign up for Arkham with my referral link. And this referral link was a base 64 encoded version of your email, like your raw email. So people could just read each other's emails from posting these referral links, which was hilarious. They eventually fixed it, but that's just funny. But the product itself, the product for which this token is being created is basically a kind of communal tagging system where you can I don't know what the token mechanics are, but more or less you stake something and you're like, this address corresponds to this real world person, and I'm staking this amount of risk on it.
00:48:29.966 - 00:48:40.478, Speaker B: And it's basically like a crowdsourced tagging. Who is who? How do real world identities correspond to on chain addresses system? And a lot of people got upset.
00:48:40.494 - 00:48:43.634, Speaker E: About this because they're like, hey, this.
00:48:43.672 - 00:49:20.446, Speaker B: Seems like basically a kind of incentivized de anonymization network. This is bad. This is going against the crypto ethos of allowing people to maintain their anonymity if they so choose. Curious to get thoughts from the panel on is this good, is this bad? Is this part of growing up as an industry that like, hey, I mean, obviously Etherscan has this tagging mechanism and there's nansen that has it's not as though these things don't exist somewhere, but it does seem to rug people the wrong way of like, hey, I'm just going to pay people. I'm just going to crowdsource it from people and pay anyone to claim that this person corresponds to this address. What do you guys think about this?
00:49:20.548 - 00:49:35.890, Speaker D: I just think it's a faulty mechanism. Like, what's stopping me from going out and getting a couple of tokens and saying that zero x 1234 is Haseeb? I don't care about losing or burning my tokens. Like, it's a troll against Haseeb.
00:49:36.630 - 00:49:39.326, Speaker C: Who would have thought the Oracle problem was hard to solve?
00:49:39.438 - 00:49:41.742, Speaker D: Yeah, who would have thought that this was a difficult thing?
00:49:41.816 - 00:49:50.714, Speaker B: I may have heard of this. I may have heard of this. Well, I'm kind of inventing the token mechanics. I don't actually know if this is how it works. This is how I assume it works. I can't imagine how else it would work.
00:49:50.752 - 00:49:54.502, Speaker F: But token registry thing, people are like, staking on these facts.
00:49:54.646 - 00:49:56.490, Speaker B: We do not speak of token registries.
00:49:57.230 - 00:50:02.970, Speaker A: This is like an auger throwback, really. It's like you stake the token, you have disputes, escalation game.
00:50:03.120 - 00:50:04.780, Speaker C: This is like true story.
00:50:07.070 - 00:50:34.194, Speaker B: Actually, you're completely right. Presumably it would be the same mechanic. Now, again, I have not actually read the thing, and we just heard about another podcast that was sued for not correctly reporting a story. So I'm going to caveat. What we say very clearly is that I have not read the token mechanics, so it could work in a totally different so please, Arkham, please don't sue us. Although I will also say it's a very shadowy name for a company that makes me afraid of losses.
00:50:34.242 - 00:50:39.386, Speaker F: It's still trust. I'll say that Arkham is the name of the insane asylum from Batman, isn't it?
00:50:39.408 - 00:50:42.838, Speaker B: The name of no, the Gotham is the name of the city, but Arkham.
00:50:42.854 - 00:50:44.410, Speaker F: Is the name of the insane asylum.
00:50:45.390 - 00:50:47.020, Speaker B: Yes. Yeah.
00:50:47.710 - 00:50:48.700, Speaker E: I don't know.
00:50:49.470 - 00:51:23.000, Speaker A: They issued a statement today or yesterday, and there was this other sort of funny meme running around where people are looking up the founder on LinkedIn, and he had his past history, and then he like one interest, like one thing that was interested in on LinkedIn, and it was the CIA. And then everyone in their statement today, they had a section that was like, are you like the FBI or the. CIA and they're like, no we are not, we are not associated with any law enforcement. And I'm like, I feel like your company is really not going well when you have to specify that in public.
00:51:24.090 - 00:51:25.446, Speaker F: You're not a government project.
00:51:25.548 - 00:51:31.146, Speaker B: Are you the cops? Wow, okay, you get flip it around.
00:51:31.168 - 00:51:32.954, Speaker F: Why are people having to ask?
00:51:33.152 - 00:51:50.606, Speaker B: Yeah, okay, well, interesting, I think we're all on board with like, we don't think this is going to work. Let's say there was a version of this that did work or that was a trustworthy repository of addresses. I mean, look, regardless of whether or not this Arkham system works, etherscan does.
00:51:50.628 - 00:51:53.386, Speaker E: This, Nansen does this, is this good.
00:51:53.508 - 00:51:59.490, Speaker B: To encourage this, to reinforce it? What do you guys think about these kind of address registries?
00:51:59.830 - 00:52:33.450, Speaker F: There's also Ethereum Attribution System EAS, which I believe a number of people I know for sure. Why, I'm not sure a large company is working on building something to help do their own attributions or attestations, sorry, attestations is the word. I mean, to be saying Ethereum Attestation System, that's like an open standard. I think a bunch of large companies are going to be doing that. Which sounds, I'd say better than any sort of token staking mechanism. Right. I honestly would probably just prefer to trust some large company who has a reputation at stake which is actually something really valuable for them rather than these tokens which will fluctuate in value wildly.
00:52:34.190 - 00:52:38.846, Speaker B: But that's a self attestation, right? That's like saying this is my, I'm coinbase, this is my address. Correct?
00:52:38.948 - 00:52:43.614, Speaker F: It would be like Coinbase saying this is this person's address or this person.
00:52:43.652 - 00:52:46.366, Speaker B: Has been KYC oh for third see?
00:52:46.388 - 00:52:52.690, Speaker F: Yeah, third party giving attestations about someone else. Which is what I assume Arkham was trying to do here. Like someone else's staking telling.
00:52:55.670 - 00:53:35.406, Speaker A: I understand some of the motivation. I think it's maybe not as nefarious as people assume. It is very laborious and manual to actually tag a bunch of the market maker wallets and some of the exchange wallets and you can do some basic heuristics to sort of identify them, but someone has to go there and go through all these things and it's not always going to be 100% accurate. And so I think part of their thinking and I think Arkham basically tries to compete with Nanson and sort of being this token on chain intelligence platform. Hey, what if we can bootstrap our own data set and instead I think it obviously can be used this way, but I think it's also been sort of presented as it's a doc to earn platform, which I think well, doesn't.
00:53:35.438 - 00:53:55.234, Speaker C: The white paper start off with the sentence, the inevitable end of blockchain is to have everyone doxxed or something? It has some ridiculous something that sounds like it's out of like Peter Thiel meets Batman fan fiction that, wow, that is pretty dark. The white paper is just so they're.
00:53:55.282 - 00:53:57.078, Speaker B: Really living up to the name.
00:53:57.244 - 00:54:05.770, Speaker C: It was just, like, written by someone who seems a bit, like, lacking any form of social empathy with any other human on the planet.
00:54:06.110 - 00:54:06.970, Speaker F: Ouch.
00:54:08.190 - 00:54:09.946, Speaker B: Too many years in Gotham City will.
00:54:09.968 - 00:54:13.582, Speaker E: Do that to you, man. It wears you down. Wow.
00:54:13.636 - 00:54:16.526, Speaker B: Okay. Robert, was there something you want to add?
00:54:16.708 - 00:54:25.380, Speaker D: I was just going to say they're clearly playing up that Dystopian fan fiction element. They're feeding off of that for their own brand and their own energy.
00:54:25.750 - 00:54:29.234, Speaker E: Yeah. Okay. Well, either way.
00:54:29.272 - 00:54:40.146, Speaker B: Well, let's hope that they manage to get this register. I mean, I don't actually know what I hope. I don't know if I want the registry to work or to not work here's.
00:54:40.178 - 00:54:43.490, Speaker C: The phrase de anonymization is destiny.
00:54:43.570 - 00:54:49.862, Speaker B: That was like when I saw a that's a very good tagline for the CIA.
00:54:50.006 - 00:54:50.700, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:54:51.310 - 00:55:06.446, Speaker C: It's like everything they write just seems to just be like, I could have asked Chat GPT to write, what would Peter Thiel say about blockchain data and monitoring people? And it would have come up with this.
00:55:06.548 - 00:55:27.262, Speaker B: I feel like DARPA must have been their lead investor or something. It's a little too on the nose. Anyway, all right, before we get sued, we have to wrap the show. To be clear, these are all we have no idea what's going on, so don't take anything seriously. Let's go ahead and wrap. Blake, thanks for coming on the show. It was great to hear about what's going on at Goldfinch.
00:55:27.262 - 00:55:42.230, Speaker B: Thanks, Mr. Wish you all the best. And, Robert, congrats on the launch of Superstate. Anybody who has money, put it in. This is not investment advice, but you should absolutely. Maybe if it's appropriate for your portfolio, you should buy tokenized treasuries.
00:55:42.730 - 00:55:47.880, Speaker C: I love the descending sequence of disclaimers. That was, like, the best part of that.
00:55:49.130 - 00:55:58.942, Speaker B: I'm getting better at this. I'm getting better at this. My ability to disclaim as something, as soon as I say it is. Being in this industry, you get on top of it.
00:55:58.996 - 00:55:59.262, Speaker E: Anyway.
00:55:59.316 - 00:56:06.890, Speaker B: All right, we got a wrap. Thank you, everybody. See you next week. Bye.
