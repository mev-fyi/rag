00:00:00.090 - 00:00:12.560, Speaker A: I mean, these are all fraudulent transfers, potentially while the debtor was insolvent, potentially while there was commingle of funds. So clearly all that money has to come back. I think that's pretty easy. The question is, like, what's it worth now? And who can actually pay it back?
00:00:16.370 - 00:00:17.086, Speaker B: Hi everyone.

00:01:25.788 - 00:01:28.274, Speaker C: One One Seven Partners. Welcome, Thomas.
00:01:28.402 - 00:01:29.942, Speaker D: Hey Laura, good to see you again.
00:01:30.076 - 00:01:32.886, Speaker C: This week, FTX sued Joseph Bankman and.
00:01:32.908 - 00:01:35.254, Speaker B: Barbara Freed, the parents of former FTX.
00:01:35.302 - 00:02:01.890, Speaker C: CEO Sam Bankman Fried, alleging that Bankman was intimately involved in a number of the allegedly fraudulent schemes, such as Silencing, someone who threatened to expose the alleged FTX fraud, the purchase of property in the Bahamas. Barbara Fried encouraged the use of straw donors as campaign finance laws or allegedly, and both were accused generally of either knowing or ignoring the red flags that FTX was involvement. Was this development surprising or expected?
00:02:02.630 - 00:02:15.186, Speaker A: Thanks for having me on, Laura. Good to see you as always. Was it surprising? No, I don't think it was that surprising. I think what was in the lawsuits in bankruptcy referred to as adversary proceeding. But what was seen in the adversary.
00:02:15.218 - 00:02:18.086, Speaker D: Proceeding was probably a bit shocking, the.
00:02:18.108 - 00:02:21.498, Speaker A: Actual details, but I think people knew that they were pretty involved and I.
00:02:21.504 - 00:02:22.998, Speaker D: Think that was some of the heat.
00:02:23.014 - 00:02:48.900, Speaker A: They were getting post him, getting karmic, complaining as them. Was that, why is he hanging out with his parents? Weren't they involved in a lot of parts of the business and people were saying things like that? I don't think it's that unexpected. People, I think, long knew that there were some real estate transactions where they were gifted or given some certain real estate in the Bahamas. But to see it all laid out in the complaint, or I should say in the adversary proceeding was interesting.
00:02:51.350 - 00:02:54.340, Speaker C: Which items in particular really struck you?
00:02:55.270 - 00:02:58.834, Speaker A: I guess just the involvement, like in the actual day to day stuff.
00:02:58.872 - 00:03:01.318, Speaker D: I mean, if you come from a.
00:03:01.324 - 00:03:06.454, Speaker A: Corporate background or were a tax lawyer, which his dad, I guess, was and.
00:03:06.492 - 00:03:07.080, Speaker D: Is.
00:03:09.150 - 00:03:24.166, Speaker A: That there wasn't more, I don't know, structure to the mean, you know, the dichotomy between what people saw pre petition, what John Reyes sort of said post petition and now some of the revelations coming out about the pre petition activity.
00:03:24.198 - 00:03:25.582, Speaker D: I mean, it's just kind of amazing.
00:03:25.636 - 00:04:15.630, Speaker A: To think about people that might have been a more of a corporate background saying, if the business was so profitable, why were you cutting corners? And to be fair to these guys, in the light of day, sunlight of bankruptcy court, which as people in bankruptcy say, like my parents would say, the last place you want to be as a criminal is in bankruptcy court because there's so much sunlight on everything. Everything gets scrutinized. And to be fair to people, sometimes the stuff gets overly scrutinized and they cherry pick stuff that went on. But it seems pretty damning, some of the stuff, and let's see what the responses will be. It's good for the estate and it's good for creditors because I'm sure they want to see sort of retribution. But in terms of recoveries, I don't think it's going to be incredibly meaningful. 1020, 30, 40, $50 million that's, I don't know, maybe two months of bankruptcy fees.
00:04:18.050 - 00:04:32.146, Speaker C: Earlier when we were talking about how some of the things are particularly damning if you were to kind of say, FTX will win in court for these reasons, which were the particular acts that you think probably will put things over.
00:04:32.168 - 00:04:53.322, Speaker A: The oh, yeah, I think almost all the stuff they'll win on the merits of the fraudulent conveyance. I mean, these are all fraudulent transfers, potentially while the debtor was insolvent, potentially while there was commingle of funds. So clearly all that money has to come back. I think that's pretty easy. The question is, like, what's it worth now and who can actually pay it back?
00:04:53.376 - 00:04:55.066, Speaker D: Like, if money was given to a.
00:04:55.088 - 00:05:20.706, Speaker A: Charity, can you actually go and get it back? Meaning, is it there? Has it been spent? Kind of stuff. And you can only squeeze whatever a rock so hard. So the question will be, what is the real estate in the Bahamas worth? The $10 million or whatever that was gifted to them, where did that money end up going? Can they trace it? So these things cost money and then to do? And then the question is, like, how much of an effort do you want to make? And of course, all that can be.
00:05:20.728 - 00:05:23.426, Speaker D: Stopped by a criminal investigation, which there.
00:05:23.448 - 00:05:53.242, Speaker A: Isn'T a complaint, but clearly some of the activity could be considered criminal. And I think I won't pretend to be a criminal lawyer or a lawyer at all, but when you're bringing lawsuits, basically these are kind of like preponderance of evidence standards versus higher standards you might have for criminal complaints. So it's easier for John Ray to stitch together some stuff they know and slap an AP and sue these guys, but it's a little harder from the criminal side.
00:05:53.296 - 00:05:55.986, Speaker D: But all of it just facially.
00:05:56.038 - 00:06:04.462, Speaker A: I mean, of course, as my lawyer likes to tell me, facts matter. Thomas so as more discovery happens and they take discovery, we'll see.
00:06:04.516 - 00:06:06.786, Speaker D: But on the face of mean, it.
00:06:06.808 - 00:06:11.186, Speaker A: Looks pretty obvious, this sort of slam dunk. There's a question is what they'll actually.
00:06:11.208 - 00:06:12.318, Speaker D: Be able to recover?
00:06:12.494 - 00:07:01.170, Speaker C: Yeah, I think one of the ones that stuck out at me simply because I could very easily imagine myself in a similar position with my own parents. And I could just picture what my mother would say. And it was when they purchased the Bahamas property and everything was just getting billed or allegedly in the complaint to FTX. And the parents didn't even make an attempt to pay to furnish their home themselves. And I could just imagine if something similar was happening with my mother, she would be like, Wait, is this okay that we're doing this? She would have so many questions about the money and what was okay, what was kosher, what was not. I could just practically hear her in my head. But at least from what the complaint described, it didn't feel at all like the parents had any of those qualms.
00:07:02.230 - 00:07:23.578, Speaker A: Yeah, he wasn't 100% owner of FTX, so it is bizarre that those red flags wouldn't have been or people wouldn't have been like, hey, I know that you think this is okay, but I don't. Like, someone would have said something. Maybe they thought it was a drop in the ocean. But if sex was so wildly profitable, and I don't mean it was so wildly profitable, they didn't need to cut in corners and have them picking up the checks. I mean, it would have been easy.
00:07:23.744 - 00:07:25.146, Speaker D: For Sam to just be like, no.
00:07:25.168 - 00:07:26.922, Speaker A: I'm picking this up personally, or something.
00:07:27.056 - 00:07:46.750, Speaker C: Well, one thing that I also noticed is that the document hedges its language, saying things like, quote, bankman and Freed either knew or ignored bright red flags, revealing that SBF and other insiders were orchestrating the again, you know, I saw later, again, it was like they either knew or blatantly.
00:07:47.970 - 00:07:58.774, Speaker A: So that's because the standard for these civil cases is much lower. If you were trying to criminally try them, you'd have to really show that they knew because they're going to say they didn't know. They didn't know.
00:07:58.812 - 00:07:59.206, Speaker D: Right.
00:07:59.308 - 00:08:08.122, Speaker A: But the standard for breach of fiduciary duty or kind of unjust enrichment, it's a much lower standard. All you have to basically show is.
00:08:08.176 - 00:08:10.010, Speaker D: A reasonable person should have known.
00:08:12.110 - 00:08:13.082, Speaker C: I see.
00:08:13.216 - 00:08:15.580, Speaker D: Yeah. That's why they keep saying that.
00:08:18.030 - 00:08:23.078, Speaker C: So basically, they don't know whether or not they knew, but it doesn't matter for what they're trying to do? Is that what you're saying?
00:08:23.264 - 00:08:26.394, Speaker A: I will respectfully say that I'm not a lawyer, but a stress investor.
00:08:26.442 - 00:08:29.566, Speaker D: And what people usually say is the.
00:08:29.588 - 00:08:40.626, Speaker A: Standard is usually what a reasonable person should have known, steps a reasonable person should have taken, best practices that a board should have taken. So like a board of director, if somebody runs off with money in a.
00:08:40.648 - 00:08:42.802, Speaker D: Company, they don't have to necessarily show.
00:08:42.856 - 00:09:11.754, Speaker A: That they knew the person stole the money, but did they take any steps a reasonable person would have taken to verify that the money was there, that the person wasn't misconducting with money or whatever. So it's this reasonable person standard that I think you trigger under Delaware and a lot of jurisdictions for breach of fiduciary duty or breach of loyalty, duty of care that you have mainly in the boardroom. But also I think as a C suite executive and it sounds like he was sort of melding between the two.
00:09:11.872 - 00:09:51.114, Speaker C: Okay, so basically yeah, they're just trying to meet that right. For their purposes, they don't need to go beyond and Barbara Freed, you know, also so as far as I understand from reading know, sam Binkman was definitely involved more in the day to know he was often listed with he, you know, could make executive decisions on his own. Know, one point saying, oh, I'm just going to make this decision without like, we don't need to involve him, that kind of thing. So Barbara Fried was not involved at that level. However, it did say that she was a key influence on the campaign donations and I wondered what your takeaway was in that regard in terms of her involvement there.
00:09:51.232 - 00:10:21.060, Speaker A: Campaign finance fraud. Yeah. Again, I don't have too much to say other than it's just bizarre that so many corners were cut in regards to stuff I don't have a real view on. Again, it helps them build a story that they know just slam dunk, take back any money that was taken out of the estate at any point in the last couple of years by Barbara and the husband, but.
00:10:22.870 - 00:10:23.506, Speaker D: I don't have.
00:10:23.528 - 00:10:25.346, Speaker A: A real view on that.
00:10:25.528 - 00:10:25.874, Speaker D: Okay.
00:10:25.912 - 00:10:40.140, Speaker C: Yeah. And as far as I understand, I don't think they're married, they're domestic partners, just to clarify. Yeah. All right, so in a moment we're going to talk about what the consequences could be know from this document. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make the show possible.

00:12:19.772 - 00:12:40.830, Speaker C: Overtimemarkets XYZ back to my conversation with Thomas. So you kind of alluded to this earlier and it's simply where your mind goes when you read the complaint, but it sounds like this is leading to a criminal case. Do you agree that that is so? And if so, when do you think we might see that, et cetera?
00:12:41.410 - 00:13:27.118, Speaker A: Of course, I don't focus on criminal stuff. I mean, I'm mainly focused on bankruptcy court stuff. Clearly, when you read it, it rises to the level with something that could be criminal. I mean, when people see this stuff, I mean, even take the complaint against Sam in the freezing of the Robinhood shares, which I guess were recently sold, I guess that's some news that was reported, I guess, two weeks ago. I mean, it's not actually such a great thing that they get criminally indicted or get a criminal complaint against them because it stops the lawsuit against them. And it also will deplete the assets that the estate will be able to get because basically they'll be fighting a criminal trial until the civil files tried. Any money they've got, they can use to defend themselves in the criminal case.
00:13:27.204 - 00:13:31.150, Speaker D: So it's clearly something they're looking into.
00:13:31.220 - 00:13:34.874, Speaker A: But as you can see as they're going down the rung of FTX insiders.
00:13:34.922 - 00:13:36.786, Speaker D: I think his mom and dad are.
00:13:36.808 - 00:13:45.026, Speaker A: Probably a little lower on the totem pole than the people they've been going after, but it's clearly something where they could face something. But these things take many know, I.
00:13:45.048 - 00:13:47.302, Speaker D: Think for criminal mean, they can be.
00:13:47.356 - 00:13:56.386, Speaker A: Years, years after the activity. So the civil again is faster, the bankruptcy is a lot faster. But that could know coming down the pike.
00:13:56.418 - 00:13:58.326, Speaker D: Yeah, for sure. Yeah.
00:13:58.428 - 00:14:33.390, Speaker C: Although, I mean, at least historically, the charges against Sam were, I think, sort of record breaking. I don't know if they're literally record breaking, but they were extremely fast. So many people commented on that at the time. Last year. One thing that I wanted to ask you about also was the parents released a statement to CoinDesk after this news of the lawsuit saying, quote, this is a dangerous attempt to intimidate Joe and Barbara and undermine the jury process just days before their child's trial begins. And I wondered what your thoughts were on that statement.
00:14:33.550 - 00:14:39.394, Speaker A: I mean, I don't want to curse on your pod. I don't think John Ray cares about Sam's criminal trial.
00:14:39.522 - 00:14:41.350, Speaker D: I don't think there's any orchestration.
00:14:42.570 - 00:14:47.846, Speaker A: He probably doesn't even know that the jury selection is going on. I mean, maybe he does, but it's.
00:14:47.878 - 00:14:49.626, Speaker D: Just not a so.
00:14:49.808 - 00:15:02.666, Speaker C: Okay, so basically, the FTX bankruptcy pursuit is just happening on its own timeline, and Sam's trial is happening on its own timeline, and the two are unrelated.
00:15:02.778 - 00:15:37.302, Speaker A: I'm sure that the investigators, whether it's the SEC or the DOJ, have requests for information subpoenas on the estate, which the estate has to meet. But for the most part, and I'm sure they work, they pass the information. But generally speaking, like, either the SEC, the DOJ, it's kind of a one way street. They request information on you, you give it to them. They don't really tell you what they're doing. And so I don't think John is in any way any sort of coordinated effort. I just think he's really focused on creditors creditor recoveries and prosecuting the file, know, going through all these things.
00:15:37.302 - 00:15:44.538, Speaker A: And he's got a bunch of stuff teed up. You've seen a few other adversary proceedings that have been filed, and he's going picking them off one by one and.
00:15:44.624 - 00:15:47.146, Speaker D: Sort of working the file, adjudicating the.
00:15:47.168 - 00:15:50.906, Speaker A: File, and just doing what he's supposed to be doing. So I really did think the timing.
00:15:50.938 - 00:15:54.894, Speaker D: Is maybe to them, it feels like.
00:15:54.932 - 00:15:58.254, Speaker A: It'S coordinated, but I guarantee you it's not.
00:15:58.372 - 00:16:22.150, Speaker C: And so earlier, when you were saying that the amounts that could be obtained by suing the parents are small compared to the around $8 billion that are owed to the creditors, what does that say to you, that this is where they're at right now? Does it say to you that they're kind of near the end of trying to get money back from people? What is the significance of that?
00:16:22.220 - 00:16:55.700, Speaker A: All the lawsuits we've seen are really fraudulent transfer lawsuits or fraudulent conveyance lawsuits. And I'll use the term because everybody uses it, but I hate it. Like within clawbacks, within bankruptcy, you have fraudulent transfers and you have preferences. They haven't started any real preferences. They've only filed fraudulent transfers, basically deals that were unfavorable to the estate. Now, maybe there's some other insiders, but most of those insiders have claims, and those lawsuits will really be about objecting to their claims as insiders that were unjust enrichments or something like that, those will probably be dealt with, the claim objections. So right now.
00:16:57.990 - 00:17:00.334, Speaker D: They filed on July.
00:17:00.382 - 00:17:35.902, Speaker A: 31 I did the date for you. They filed the draft plan, which they're trying to get done by next July 31, 2024. So that's where he's really headed, is the plan. And as part of that, he's filed all the lawsuits he wants to file for fraudulent conveyance fraudulent transfers. So basically bad deals that the estate did or somebody that took advantage of the estate or something that Sam did that was sort of like an insider deal. And they're going you are, you're right, they're kind of getting lower and lower down but they haven't really started if they're going to bring any sort of preferential payment stuff. And this is a hot topic, a lot of retail investors I'm sure worried about it.
00:17:35.902 - 00:17:58.434, Speaker A: But there are also a lot of large creditor counterparties. I will not name names but you know them like all the big firms in crypto that would have traded with FTX are going to have some preference exposure and the question is going to be that'll be the big next probably shoes to drop. Are those lawsuits, how are they going to be handled? Are they going to be settled early? Are they going to offset their claims?
00:17:58.562 - 00:18:03.302, Speaker D: I mean John I think has said publicly and he definitely said to me.
00:18:03.356 - 00:18:28.702, Speaker A: That he really wants to shrink the denominator to improve recoveries and I think he was referring to stuff like know, I think under the bankruptcy code he has to consider going after preferences. But I think as a starting matter those will probably be the next set of big lawsuits. So yes, short answer your question. Yes, I think he's sort of going down the rung of interesting fraudulent transfer cases to bring.
00:18:28.836 - 00:19:03.146, Speaker C: Okay. Yeah. And this lawsuit against the parents did also prompt Stanford University to say that it would return money that was donated to Know. The way that came up in the suit was that the suit alleged, quote, bankman was involved in these donations that did not benefit the FTX group and instead amounted to naked self dealing by Bankman who sought to curry favor with and enrich his employer at the Know. That was an additional amount of money that they were able to get. But you're not, it's not a large amount.
00:19:03.328 - 00:19:23.390, Speaker A: So many bizarre insider dealings from trying to buy people's claims. And not all bad, it's not like these people were bad but just weird back of the envelope like sure here's $10 million, yeah sure here's a million bucks type of transactions with no papering, no contract.
00:19:24.210 - 00:19:28.682, Speaker D: You have to question why did Sam do that?
00:19:28.836 - 00:19:34.882, Speaker A: I don't know that it was due, I mean whatever, we can't get into the psychology of his head and what he was thinking.
00:19:34.936 - 00:19:36.962, Speaker D: But some very bizarre stuff.
00:19:37.016 - 00:19:54.778, Speaker A: I mean employees with bonuses that they never had contracts, the bonuses were in crypto. There's no record of the bonus other than like whatever, a slack message or a telegram message. Just bizarre stuff that you would not normally see anyway.
00:19:54.864 - 00:20:16.970, Speaker C: Yeah. So speaking of clawbacks, I believe the lawyers are considering doing what are called retail clawbacks, meaning clawbacks from the people that are essentially also the creditors themselves. So explain a little bit more about that and whether or not you think that's likely to happen and how that will be decided?
00:20:17.130 - 00:20:17.466, Speaker D: Gosh.
00:20:17.498 - 00:20:38.390, Speaker A: Where do I start? We've talked about this one before, last time, but just to go into it and I saw that before I came on that biology had tweeted about clawbacks or preferences, which is pretty funny, made it all the way up the polo biology. But the idea of sorry, for the record, are there multiple biologies?
00:20:39.210 - 00:20:42.278, Speaker C: Well, not everybody is like super into crypto.
00:20:42.374 - 00:20:46.906, Speaker A: I know, I'm joking. I wouldn't even know how to say his last name. So I appreciate you saying it for me.
00:20:47.008 - 00:20:50.342, Speaker D: So on preferences, there's really no distinction.
00:20:50.406 - 00:21:06.434, Speaker A: Between a preference that belongs to a business or an individual. Of course it sort of tugs at the heartstrings a bit more if it's an individual who was just trading their account, they were just moving money around the way you would in your brokerage account or your bank account and you think, well hang on, wait, I got to pay that money back. I was lucky to get a little bit off. What do you mean I got to pay it back?
00:21:06.472 - 00:21:09.394, Speaker D: So there's that.
00:21:09.432 - 00:21:27.046, Speaker A: That comes into it when it's a retail person, probably more so than once an institution. But generally speaking, clawbacks or preferences under 546 section of the bankruptcy code, not that's important. The idea is within 90 days of bankruptcy you received a payment that was preferential in nature even if you didn't know it. You don't have to have knowledge because.
00:21:27.068 - 00:21:29.480, Speaker D: The idea is you got a payment.
00:21:30.890 - 00:21:40.806, Speaker A: That was preferential and so the other creditors are out because you took money out and so they're getting less because you basically took money out of a tub that wasn't full and so it's presumed that there was insolvent.
00:21:40.838 - 00:21:42.426, Speaker D: And so you have some of course.
00:21:42.448 - 00:22:07.300, Speaker A: Defenses to preferences and we can walk through those but of course most people are very scared, I think on the retail side of preferences, I think there are a lot of good defenses to preferences and again we can walk through them. But the estate did come out recently and say that they were kind of showing what the preference exposure looked like exposure, but their potential preferences they could go after. And it looks pretty ugly because.
00:22:09.030 - 00:22:09.346, Speaker D: A.
00:22:09.368 - 00:22:14.214, Speaker A: Few things, one, they showed that there's like $9 billion in the last 15 days. There isn't a lot of case law.
00:22:14.252 - 00:22:16.034, Speaker C: On that was removed from the exchange.
00:22:16.162 - 00:22:51.634, Speaker A: Right, it was removed from the exchange before the petition date. And there isn't a lot of case law on banks filing for bankruptcy because they can't since 1986, I think it might have even been earlier, but 1986 onward, they could not file for bankruptcy. There isn't a lot of case law. There is some case law before 1986 and there's some subsequent 19 six about extraordinary periods where you can't argue what's called ordinary course defense. And this is a big defense that a lot of people use in traditional bankruptcy and in the crypto bankruptcies around preferential payments that could be potentially clawed back. And I think creditors will make that. I think the terms of service are not going to stand up, but people will still try to argue that.
00:22:51.634 - 00:23:17.526, Speaker A: And there are some other defenses if you want to go into them. But basically the idea is if 9 billion went off the platform, that 9 billion could be clawed back lawsuit by lawsuit by lawsuit and you would have to pay that money in before your other claim. The remainder of your claimant that you have in the estate would be allowed and they have the power of offset. So let's say you have a million dollar claim and you took off a million dollars in the preference period, they can literally offset your claim with the preference.
00:23:17.638 - 00:23:21.002, Speaker D: So it's kind of on one level.
00:23:21.056 - 00:23:35.430, Speaker A: You think, oh, this is great, it's going to help recoveries, but it's kind of a bloody way to get there. But this is effectively what happened in Madoff and happens in all the big bankruptcies, which is they do look at clawbacks, the better your defense is, ordinary.
00:23:35.450 - 00:23:37.006, Speaker D: Course of business is probably the leading.
00:23:37.038 - 00:23:45.426, Speaker A: Defense, new value defense, meaning I deposited after I withdrew money, let's see if we can keep going. The ordinary course, new value.
00:23:45.608 - 00:23:48.418, Speaker D: And yeah, those are the big ones.
00:23:48.504 - 00:23:53.154, Speaker A: I think there might be one more, but then the other one that people are talking about is the safe harbor.
00:23:53.202 - 00:23:56.278, Speaker D: Which allows for, oh gosh, I don't.
00:23:56.284 - 00:24:17.418, Speaker A: Want to go into this. The transactions between financial intermediaries cannot be clawed back under a thing called 546 e. The bankruptcy code, this was put in during the 2005 updates to the bankruptcy code. And the idea is you don't want financial contagion. And so the way you prevent financial contagion is transactions between financial intermediaries cannot.
00:24:17.434 - 00:24:19.374, Speaker D: Be sort of clawed back, right?
00:24:19.412 - 00:24:40.280, Speaker A: So if you get a financial cris like 2008 or a bank run, you don't really want other banks having to pay other banks back if they all go under because it just creates contagion. What happens is everybody tries to suck money out of the system because they're worried about preferences. And I actually think it's important for the crypto ecosystem to probably argue for 5460 treatment, but no one's taking me up on that.
00:24:41.050 - 00:24:51.738, Speaker C: And just to clarify, an example of that on FTX would be what? Two trading firms that are trading on FTX, or like I don't even know.
00:24:51.744 - 00:25:00.934, Speaker D: If they, let's say a market banking firm, yeah, let's say another big financial.
00:25:00.982 - 00:25:33.720, Speaker A: Institution that people might have capital at that's in crypto is trading with FTX and they have balances on FTX. And let's say during the preference period they pulled off $20 million. And now if people think all of a sudden like, well hang on, these guys have a $20 million preference, I should pull my money from them, like, I don't know nexo or name your, I don't know, Kraken, I don't know, someone else is trading, or I should really pull my money. Or even if I'm an investor, like, let's say I'm an investor with a market making firm, and you're like, oh my gosh, they have a big preference, they go after them. I should really pull my money.
00:25:34.410 - 00:25:35.286, Speaker C: Oh, got it.
00:25:35.308 - 00:26:09.426, Speaker A: And so it creates contagion within the system, or that's what the thought is. And that's why 546 E exists. Generally, it's like if Fidelity is trading with TRO Price or things like that. So when you have all these Wall Street brokerage firms but it also applies to it says financial intermediary is what the code says. And of course this has been super heavily litigated, like all the way up to the Supreme Court a few times or many times what the definition of financial intermediary is and stuff like this. It's a very highly technical thing, but.
00:26:09.528 - 00:26:13.246, Speaker D: It is a potential defense, and we'll.
00:26:13.278 - 00:27:00.094, Speaker A: See how John and the guys at FTX go about arguing it. I think the judge people forget that the judge is going to be very sympathetic to the idea that if there was a bank run in the last 15 days that people got to pay that money back now, he might let it say, okay, ordinary course of defense applies to everything in October or whatever the other 60, 70 days. But in those last ten or 15 days when there was a huge bank run, I'm not allowing you to argue ordinary course defense. But now that defense is out, but now you have to argue new value. Well, people were just pulling money out, so new value isn't going to apply to a lot of those withdrawals because the deposits already happened. There's not going to be deposits. So then you're left with five, four to succeed, which is a very expensive proposition to be arguing.
00:27:00.222 - 00:27:03.858, Speaker D: So it could meaningfully help recoveries, but.
00:27:03.864 - 00:27:05.042, Speaker A: It'S also going to come off the.
00:27:05.096 - 00:27:07.970, Speaker D: Pound of flesh of other creditors.
00:27:08.630 - 00:27:28.106, Speaker C: Right. I mean, the way I look at that is that it's almost like the estate wants to socialize the losses amongst everybody. So in order to do that, they have to claw back the funds, create one big pool again, and then cut them all by the same percentage before paying everybody. You know, honestly, it's not that different.
00:27:28.128 - 00:27:29.980, Speaker A: From what they never did this.
00:27:30.350 - 00:27:33.710, Speaker C: Well, Mount Gogs didn't, but Bitfinex did something similar.
00:27:33.860 - 00:27:34.574, Speaker D: Oh, did they?
00:27:34.612 - 00:27:35.914, Speaker A: I didn't know that. That's smart.
00:27:35.962 - 00:27:36.558, Speaker D: Okay.
00:27:36.724 - 00:28:19.370, Speaker C: After their hack, yeah. But what they did was they introduced that token, which I think basically there were some different options on whether or not you took the token or you took cash, or you could trade the token, or you could just hold onto it and hope that the value of the token would eventually rise. And I think it was based on something like the revenues of the exchange. And so then. Eventually at a certain point when the revenues had come in enough, the exchange actually was able to buy everybody out who had any of those tokens left. So it doesn't sound like the state is going to do anything like that, but they will. Sounds like or at least they're considering doing the socializing of the losses.
00:28:19.890 - 00:28:23.840, Speaker A: Well, yeah, I think it's a nice.
00:28:24.370 - 00:28:29.034, Speaker D: Well, I would say for larger firms.
00:28:29.162 - 00:28:38.434, Speaker A: They'Re probably going to want settlements. Like if you name the who's who of crypto who are trading partners with FTX, I assume when they have 100.
00:28:38.472 - 00:28:41.042, Speaker D: Million dollar preference there's going to be.
00:28:41.096 - 00:28:45.726, Speaker A: Like, hey, let's not burn a ball in legal fees, let's figure out a solution.
00:28:45.838 - 00:28:46.930, Speaker D: But who knows.
00:28:47.670 - 00:28:55.718, Speaker A: Those are kind of lawsuits that will happen towards the end of the bankruptcy and they'll be going on for years and years and years. That's the kind of stuff that could be going on in ten years from now.
00:28:55.804 - 00:29:07.578, Speaker C: And so when would you like are you imagining that there will be a decision on whether or not to try to attempt the retail clawbacks at a certain point? Can you put a date on that?
00:29:07.744 - 00:29:23.706, Speaker A: Right, the debtor has two days from the petition to basically start filing them to bring causes of action as they're called under the bankruptcy code. What are going to be November soon and then it will not be November.
00:29:23.738 - 00:29:27.780, Speaker D: Now, but it'll be November 2024 is when they have to bring them by.
00:29:28.870 - 00:29:32.082, Speaker C: Okay, so if they're going to do that then we would see it before.
00:29:32.136 - 00:29:33.234, Speaker D: That at some point.
00:29:33.352 - 00:29:39.800, Speaker A: The way that code kind of works is like the debtor has the right but not the obligation to do a lot of stuff. This is one of those things.
00:29:40.250 - 00:29:40.854, Speaker D: Got it.
00:29:40.892 - 00:29:45.138, Speaker C: Well if you were to cause debt, what ODS would you give that they're.
00:29:45.154 - 00:29:46.680, Speaker D: Going to do it.
00:29:48.010 - 00:29:51.914, Speaker A: I think they kind of have to try it on.
00:29:52.032 - 00:29:59.786, Speaker D: I just don't know how successful they'll be. If I was in a firm and.
00:29:59.808 - 00:30:03.006, Speaker A: I had the financial wherewithal like I would totally fight this.
00:30:03.108 - 00:30:07.326, Speaker D: If I didn't, I would mitigate the.
00:30:07.348 - 00:30:23.134, Speaker A: Risk, maybe sell it to somebody non recourse someone to buy a claim and fight my preference or just be ready to fight it. But if it's like, hey, we're not in the business of fighting this stuff and once the market hears about this, it's not going to help our brand.
00:30:23.182 - 00:30:25.540, Speaker D: Equity, then you're going to want to deal with it.
00:30:27.030 - 00:30:34.226, Speaker A: And if you're a smaller retail trader, you don't have better ODS because you need to hire real counsel if it's like a million dollar plus preference.
00:30:34.258 - 00:30:36.306, Speaker D: But if it's a smaller preference, it's.
00:30:36.338 - 00:31:05.166, Speaker A: Hard for them to bring cases and actually collect. So what does someone say? Like possessions nine tenths of the law. It's kind of a joke. But also it's hard for them to collect a $200,000 preference from a retail client. So I don't want to get people spooked if they're a small retail client, even, like, someone with, like, a $20,000 preference. I mean, imagine how hard it is for the apparatus of John and $2,000 an hour lawyers to collect something like that.
00:31:05.268 - 00:31:07.306, Speaker D: Just very hard. Right?
00:31:07.428 - 00:31:15.006, Speaker C: Okay. Yeah. So it's probably only the bigger creditors that they would go after. All right, well, this has been very illuminating. Thank you so much for coming on Unchained.
00:31:15.118 - 00:31:16.046, Speaker D: Thanks, Laura.

00:31:56.390 - 00:33:08.486, Speaker E: Hello, and thanks for tuning into this week's Unchained weekly news recap. This is Michael Del Castillo, a Knight Badget fellow at Columbia University. This week, federal magistrate Judge Zia Faruki denied the US. Securities and Exchange Commission's request to inspect Binance US software, urging the regulatory body to narrow its demands for additional information. The SEC has been keen to scrutinize Binance US's relationship with crypto custodian Sefu, which, according to its own site, rebranded from Binance custody in February and is, quote, the only institutional custody partner of the Finance exchange, end quote. According to a statement from the company, safu takes its name from Finance's Secure Asset Fund for users, or Safu. Safu, an emergency insurance fund that CoinDesk last year reported had $700 million worth of BNB in one account now holding only $286,000,000 worth of BNB and $300 million worth of bitcoin in another account now holding $430,000,000 worth of bitcoin while the assets remain in the accounts previously associated with Finance's insurance fund.
00:33:08.486 - 00:34:02.940, Speaker E: A month after Cephu was rebranded, finance released a statement saying it would start using two different stablecoins. This is all to say that the SEC now has come to suspect that Binance US and Sefu might not be quite as, quote, separate as Sefu's press release sought to make it appear, accusing the Custodian of facilitating the movement of US customer funds abroad. Binance CEO Changpeng Czao denied the SEC's claims that Binance US used Sefu for handling customer assets. In a social media post, he wrote, quote, binance US does not use and has never used Sefu or Binance custody. You can't just make this stuff up. End quote. That said, the judge has encouraged both parties to cooperate and try to find a middle ground to move the case forward.
00:34:02.940 - 00:35:39.190, Speaker E: In a recent development that signals heightened scrutiny of the crypto industry, the head of the SEC's crypto assets and cyber unit, David Hirsch, announced that the agency is intensifying its focus on businesses operating similarly to industry giants like Coinbase and Binance. During Hirsch's address at a day long event in Chicago for both current and former SEC employees, he emphasized that the regulatory body is not limiting its investigations to prominent exchanges, but is extending its probes into intermediaries and decentralized finance products. Despite facing recent legal setbacks, including the previously mentioned denied request to access Binance US. Software and challenges in cases related to crypto investment firms, the SEC remains steadfast in its mission, hirsch affirmed, quote, we're going to continue to bring those charges, end quote, he said, indicating what appears to be the continuation of a steadfast approach to monitoring firms that potentially violate federal securities laws. However, Hirsch also acknowledged constraints on the agency, including its limited enforcement budget, which could hamper additional investigations against well funded exchanges embroiled in complex federal legal battles. In this week's episode of The Chopping Block, Zerox Labs founder Will Warren talked about the challenges smaller startups face in dealing with a lawsuit with legal fees amounting to large percentages of their capital raised. It remains to be seen whether small DeFi projects will be able to survive the US.
00:35:39.190 - 00:36:27.746, Speaker E: Regulatory onslaught, making matters potentially much worse for those in the crypto industry. Should any of these lightly funded startups lose their legal battles, it could set precedents that impact the rest of the industry. Meanwhile, in Washington, DC. U. S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a member of the Democratic Party, gained robust support for her Digital Asset Antimoney Laundering Act, a legislative effort initiated in July 2023 to curb illicit activities facilitated by cryptocurrencies. The bill, backed by a growing coalition of ten senators, all Democrats or caucused with the Democratic Party, aims to tighten regulatory loopholes and impose stringent know your customer and anti money laundering requirements on many participants in the crypto sector, including wallet providers and miners.
00:36:27.746 - 00:37:15.234, Speaker E: In a statement, Warren emphasized the urgency to halt criminal enterprises exploiting the digital asset ecosystem. In related news, New York's historically influential financial regulator, the same one behind the controversial Bit license proposed stricter guidelines for cryptocurrency listings focusing on technology, market and regulatory risk assessments. Contrary to Tether's previous claim that it would halt secured loans by the end of this year, the stablecoin issuer has continued to issue USDT denominated loans to its clients. The Wall Street Journal reports tether's latest quarterly financial update revealed a loan portfolio of $5.5 billion as of June 30. That's actually an increase from the $5.3 billion in the previous quarter.
00:37:15.234 - 00:38:18.326, Speaker E: Tether spokesperson Alex Welsh, in fact confirmed the new loans, stating they were issued to, quote, long standing clients, end quote, to prevent liquidity depletion or unfavorable collateral sales. Welsh added that Tether now aims to end its loans by next year. Welsh went on to defend Tether's actions, citing $3.3 billion in excess reserves and criticizing traditional financial institutions for not meeting crypto customer demand. The company's loan practices remain under scrutiny as its balance sheets lack transparency about which assets are being used as collateral to stabilize Tether's price. Ironically, though, more transparent stablecoin issuers like Circle behind the USDC stablecoin continue to see the market caps of their stable assets decline. The legal skirmish between Gemini Trust and the digital currency group DCG intensified this week as Gemini vehemently opposed DCG's recent recovery proposal for Genesis Global creditors.
00:38:18.326 - 00:39:28.590, Speaker E: In a filing on September 15, Gemini's legal team denounced the plan as a total mirage, accusing DCG of presenting, quote, contrived, misleading and inaccurate assertions, end quote to Genesis creditors. The proposal suggested a recovery rate of 70% to 90% for unsecured creditors. With Gemini earn users potentially seeing a 95% to 110% recovery, it'll be interesting to see how a more than 100% recovery could pan out. Gemini insists that the proposed recovery rates do not reflect the real value terms. The ongoing dispute, marked by allegations of fraud and legal entanglements sees both companies grappling with a lawsuit filed by the SEC earlier this year. The ethereum based decentralized Exchange protocol Balancer faced yet another security breach on Tuesday night and urged users to refrain from interacting with its website following an attack last month that led to $900,000 worth of losses at the time. Representatives of the platform on Tuesday tweeted a warning about a front end attack, which, at the time of the tweet, they wrote, was still being investigated.
00:39:28.590 - 00:40:38.578, Speaker E: Early reports from blockchain security firms indicate that approximately $238,000 in cryptocurrency might have been siphoned off following the previous attack. Users were advised to exercise caution as the website seemed to have suffered a redirect attack, tricking users into thinking they were using a real investor interface, when in fact they were willfully turning over their assets to the thieves following this attack, it looks like that warning might have been worth paying attention to. Hong Kong police intensified their investigation into the JPEGs crypto exchange, arresting six individuals, including crypto influencer Joseph Lam, alleging they misled the public regarding the exchange's licensing and other operational aspects. The crackdown reportedly follows over 1400 complaints made to local authorities and suspected involvement of assets worth approximately HK$1 billion, or about 128,000,000 U. S. Dollars. Meanwhile, the exchange faces a liquidity crisis with halted operations and skyrocketed withdrawal fees, which Jpex attributes to, quote, malicious end quote actions by third party market makers.
00:40:38.578 - 00:41:40.226, Speaker E: Of course, it's entirely possible that these were just investors making a better bet than the exchange could or wanted to handle. Japan securities and Futures Commission, or SFC, had previously flagged JPEGs for allegedly falsely claiming it had a valid license. The exchange, asserting its commitment to continue operations, is actively negotiating with market makers to resolve the cash flow shortage in the face of plummeting Bitcoin NFT sales and a broader asset class downturn. The creator of the Bitcoin Ordinals Protocol, Casey Rotomore, is advocating for a revamp of the current inscription numbering system that lets users draw or inscribe images and other data directly into the Bitcoin blockchain. In a post on the GitHub repository that houses the Ordinal's code base. The software engineer argued that the existing method has led to complex code and hindered progress. Initially, the numbering was designed to remain stable, meaning encryptions would retain their original numbers forever.
00:41:40.226 - 00:42:55.358, Speaker E: However, maintaining this stability has proven to be a significant challenge, especially with alterations to the inscription protocol. The current system assigns negative numbers to unrecognized encryptions, creating what Rotomore calls quote cursed end quote inscriptions that fail to indicate the order of creation and adding complexity and bugs to the system. Rotomore proposes integrating these cursed numbers into the main sequence and eliminating their use in URLs. This adjustment, he notes, would result in what he says are minimal changes, with new numbers differing from about by about 1% from the old ones. When Ordinals first launched this January, they were controversial for potentially bogging down bitcoin transaction volumes by creating traffic that some viewed as being not fundamental to Bitcoin's core value proposition, while others saw them as a crucial step to remaining competitive against the likes of Ethereum, which started to popularize NFTs as far back as 2015. Those concerns have waned of late, with Ordinal's volume down 97% between May and August, according to a DAP Radar report. As always, there's plenty going on in DFI and Dows.
00:42:55.358 - 00:44:09.290, Speaker E: Here's a quick roundup over 70% of Apecoin Dow members backed proposal AIP 297, coauthored by Animoco Brands chairman Yatsu to create a sister Dow and NFT community treasury for influential NFT acquisitions. Layer One blockchain network Kanto set it plans to transition to an Ethereum Layer Two, utilizing the Polygon chain development kit for a network emphasizing the integration of real world assets. The creators of layer Two network Optimism announced a $26 million AirDrop, distributing 19.4 million Op tokens to 31 870 addresses as part of their engagement and reward strategy. After much deliberation, the founder of F Two Pool, a crypto mining operating business, decided to refund 19.8 bitcoin to blockchain infrastructure firm Paxos after the firm inadvertently paid a whopping $520,000 fee on a relatively tiny $2,000 transaction. Mark Cuban, the American billionaire investor, reportedly lost $870,000 in a DFI related scam.
00:44:09.290 - 00:44:19.840, Speaker E: Looking for something more fun? Genesis is rebranding. You may wonder why. To what? Take a closer listen to stand up comedian Jenny Hogan's take on the whole matter.
00:44:20.290 - 00:44:52.230, Speaker F: Huge news genesis is changing its name to Exodus, or at least its mission. Last week, the company announced its plan to Sunset, a term definitely created by a person who has never looked at a sunset all its trading services worldwide. The sun comes back a few hours later. Spokesperson said that this decision was made voluntarily, which is very good because I cannot support non consensual sunsets. Genesis filed Chapter Eleven bankruptcy earlier this year, but at the time they thought that their parent company, DCG, would bail them out. But no, daddy's out of cash, too. This is literally the plot of Schitt's Creek.
00:44:52.230 - 00:45:08.714, Speaker F: Good news is that genesis has assured users that they'll be made nearly whole. The bad news is that they haven't specified what that means. Genesis owes its creditors nearly $3.5 billion. Some, such as the Winklevoss twins of Gemini, say that that is wholly insufficient. Okay, winklevy. Here's the rock.
00:45:08.714 - 00:45:20.020, Speaker F: Use your strong, growing arms to squeeze some water out of it. For any Genesis users out there, you have until Wednesday to finish up your trades. 48 hours is an eternity in crypto. There's still plenty of time to lose thousands of dollars.
