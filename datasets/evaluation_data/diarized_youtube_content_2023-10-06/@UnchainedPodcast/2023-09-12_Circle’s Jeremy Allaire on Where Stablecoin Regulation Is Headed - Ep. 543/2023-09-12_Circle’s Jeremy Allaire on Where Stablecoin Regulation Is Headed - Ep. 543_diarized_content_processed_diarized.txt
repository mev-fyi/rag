00:00:00.410 - 00:00:15.520, Speaker A: The Fed wants it. Treasury wants it, congress wants it, the White House wants it. It's a priority that has been set by the highest levels of the administration that we need to have dollar stablecoin regulation in the United States.

00:01:47.994 - 00:01:53.582, Speaker C: Today's guest is Jeremy Alair, co founder, chairman, and CEO of Circle. Welcome, Jeremy.
00:01:53.726 - 00:01:58.290, Speaker A: Thank you, Laura. It's really great to be back on the show and see you.
00:01:58.360 - 00:01:59.650, Speaker D: Thanks for having me.
00:01:59.800 - 00:02:22.170, Speaker C: Yeah, it's been a while. Not out of any desire to not talk to you because Circle has been making waves and one of the most recent bits of news is that you've dissolved the center consortium that was managing the development of USDC and Coinbase now has taken a stake in Circle. What was the impetus behind these moves?
00:02:22.910 - 00:03:16.458, Speaker A: Yeah, it's really exciting. There are a few pieces to this. I think the first is if you go back a number of years, we sort of invented USDC and kind of debuted it to the world just over five years ago. And when we created USDC, we had a vision for what a protocol could be for fiat tokens is what we called them. They weren't called stablecoins really broadly then, but some people did. But that could work on blockchains and that you could build something that would allow for kind of interoperable value exchange built on these open networks. We had a big set of ideas and we really thought about these kinds of protocols as things that would benefit from sort of having standards around them.
00:03:16.458 - 00:04:40.982, Speaker A: And it was really important to us when we got started that we could kind of develop those standards together with other industry leaders and kind of have sort of shared stake in the success of a protocol like USDC. We were very fortunate in 2018 to forge a partnership with Coinbase. It was a really important strategic partnership for both firms to drive USDC in the market. And as part of that, Circle was sort of issuing USDC. It was sort of we're the regulated electronic money transmission firm and issuing it, but we had a lot of ideas for how that could evolve over time. But also, most importantly, while there were regulations around what money transmission was and how a firm like Circle needed to operate, there were a lot of things about Stablecoins in particular that there weren't really regulations around, like how to hold the reserves, how to manage the security of the network itself, all these kind of governance issues, in a sense, that were needed, and how to deal with law enforcement interactions and other things. And so we created Center Consortium with this idea of kind of creating self governance around a stablecoin and published more and more of the policies of that and so on.
00:04:40.982 - 00:05:03.582, Speaker A: Now, what's happened in five years? A lot of things have happened. So one know, USDC went from nothing to being one of the most important digital currencies and digital assets in the world today. It went from very small to being a billion dollar plus revenue stream business today. But also, most critically, is really starting.
00:05:03.636 - 00:05:06.718, Speaker D: A few years ago, governments sort of.
00:05:06.724 - 00:06:04.080, Speaker A: Said, well, we're actually going to govern this. We see stablecoins as part of what I refer to as the prudential regulatory framework, meaning the regulatory framework that the central banks and the major regulators of payment systems wanted to have rules around. And that was really key. And so kind of coming back to the heart of your question, which is as governance goes from kind of a self governance model to a government governance model, the nature of this changed. And so, you know, working together with Coinbase, we looked at how do we make sure that Circle can continue to build and innovate and do what we need to do as the issuer and operator of this and do it in a way that is responsive to the regulations that are emerging all around the world on stablecoins and stablecoin issuers and make sure we can follow those guidelines now that there are rules that are kind of out there and also.
00:06:06.710 - 00:06:07.122, Speaker D: Continue.
00:06:07.176 - 00:06:23.926, Speaker A: To have really strong aligned economic incentives to make this as widely successful as possible. And so a mixture of things there in terms of them taking a stake in Circle circle kind of taking full on ownership over all of the development operations USDC, but also making sure that.
00:06:23.948 - 00:06:26.374, Speaker D: This can work in the context of.
00:06:26.412 - 00:06:27.958, Speaker A: All these new stablecoin laws that are.
00:06:27.964 - 00:06:30.786, Speaker D: Popping up around the you know, it's.
00:06:30.818 - 00:07:01.970, Speaker C: Funny, because when I saw the news, it sort of felt like the consortium model was sort of the crypto way of doing things. And that was appropriate for a time when yeah, USDC was smaller. This was something that was really kind of more focused on the crypto community. But of course, now the conversation has just changed so much, and we have regulators and lawmakers that are really looking at this know there's probably going to be legislation about. So, you know, it felt like, oh, they're moving to a model that can fit into existing regulations.
00:07:02.470 - 00:07:03.922, Speaker D: Yeah, big time.
00:07:04.056 - 00:07:27.766, Speaker C: Yeah. I mean, something else that was interesting, which I'm sure you saw, is that the news of this arrangement caused some speculation that Circle was setting itself up to be acquired by Coinbase. And I was wondering, as the CEO of Circle, which direction are you working toward when you're steering Circle to going public or to an acquisition by another company such as Coinbase?
00:07:27.878 - 00:07:28.346, Speaker D: Right.
00:07:28.448 - 00:08:07.030, Speaker A: We're definitely on the path to be an independent public company. We've had the benefit of having a number of strategic investors in the company over the years. More recently, BlackRock took a minority stake in the company as part of a broader strategic partnership between the firms. That was last year. Having a stake in a company can create really good product and value alignment, and that's really key and it's important. I want to make sure that Coinbase has a stake in our long term success in addition to being able to make money from USDC. I think that's like a win win, but as a company.
00:08:07.030 - 00:08:12.986, Speaker A: Just to be clear, it's our ten year anniversary, so it's a fun year for us.
00:08:13.088 - 00:08:14.054, Speaker C: Congratulations.
00:08:14.182 - 00:08:15.194, Speaker D: Thank you.
00:08:15.392 - 00:09:18.000, Speaker A: And I say this often, but when we founded the company ten years ago, I made it very clear to my investors and employees that this is a multidecade journey to really realize the vision of the company. And when you think about kind of where we are today, there's whatever, 100 and some billion stablecoins in circulation. Yes, there's a lot of volume of transactions that are happening, but this has barely begun to penetrate the financial system. And so there's just an enormous amount ahead and a general purpose protocol and utility for dollars on the internet. There's an enormous market to go after. There not just for the movement of money, but actually just having money represented and stored in this kind of form. There's $25 trillion of electronic dollars in the world across the different kind of formats of that.
00:09:18.000 - 00:10:06.880, Speaker A: We're really quite small. And frankly, the utility of programmable money and the utility of a frictionless medium of exchange that becomes possible like this, we're just beginning to see the value of that. And so I would just say for everyone out there, circle still, even though we're doing a lot of revenue and very profitable, we're an early stage company as far as I'm concerned. I view Circle as an early stage company right now, and I think when I think about what I'm trying to do and what we're trying to build. It's a multidecade kind of strategy, and I think I'm excited to see that through. And really to do that, I hope a very strong, independent, publicly traded company.
00:10:07.970 - 00:10:25.670, Speaker C: Well, one of the steps that's definitely going to take you out of the early stage development is that you recently announced that the largest e commerce and payments firm in Latin America, mercado libre, announced that it's going to adopt USDC. So tell us a little bit about that partnership and what impact you think it'll have on circle.
00:10:26.570 - 00:11:11.282, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, it's very exciting. It's a tremendous firm that has paved the way for kind of modern commerce. And they play a really big role in payments as well in Latin America. And it's part of a broader theme that we're seeing around the growth in sort of demand for digital dollars and demand for using those in markets where maybe local currencies aren't as exciting. And Latin America is definitely one of those places. But I think very specifically, the first phases of this are going live in specific countries in Latin America. Ultimately, we envision that this will be very broadly rolled out.
00:11:11.336 - 00:11:14.674, Speaker D: But I think it's important as we.
00:11:14.712 - 00:11:28.360, Speaker A: Look at sort of indicators of where we are in the adoption of stablecoins, that this is going from, oh, this is just used as something to trade on DeFi, or this is just used for arbitrage traders or whatever.
00:11:28.990 - 00:11:29.894, Speaker C: Speculation.
00:11:30.022 - 00:11:38.730, Speaker A: Yeah, speculation. To no, actually, this is something that is fundamentally providing dollar store of value.
00:11:38.800 - 00:11:41.198, Speaker D: To people who need it, providing a.
00:11:41.204 - 00:12:17.850, Speaker A: Very efficient cross border payment mechanism for people who need it. And these are major mainstream companies that serve hundreds of millions of users. So mercado libra has, I believe, around 200 million customers. And that's tremendous. And so we think about how do we grow the tam of wallets that can transact in USDC? And coinbase has over 100 million wallets that can transact in USDC. These kinds of partnerships really grow that. And there are many, many wallets that people use.
00:12:17.850 - 00:12:49.410, Speaker A: I think MetaMask has 30 million active users and they can all transact in USDC. And so as we see more and more wallets, these traditional kind of fintech commerce firms, digital wallets companies, and then all the new people building the next account abstraction, smart account wallet, that's going to be the killer app for making all this usable. As those things get built, it just creates more and more avenues for people to use USDC.
00:12:50.310 - 00:13:18.378, Speaker C: Yeah, and I want to talk about those tech developments, but before we move on, I just wanted to ask for the mercado libre. So obviously, let's say I'm in Chile and I'm going to buy something on mercado libre. It would show me the Chilean peso price. But then, in addition, would it have this price in USDC? Is the consumer also recognizing that their price could be denominated in dollars. Is that how that will work?
00:13:18.544 - 00:14:20.170, Speaker A: I don't actually have the details of the user experience, exactly how that is set up in front of me. What I do know is that they have a lot of demand from their customers to hold and transact in dollars. And so this is really a really powerful way to move more of the store of value that exists for their customers into digital dollars. And then obviously, once you have those, the usefulness of them both within their own platform. But the power of all this and the reason why stablecoins are interesting in some ways in the first place, and USDC specifically, is because of the reach, because of the interoperability. Like, I want to live in a world where I've got a digital wallet and I'm in the Philippines and I know someone in Brazil and I know someone wherever. And like, that's the power of crypto, right, open networks that you can transact over directly, peer to peer interoperably.
00:14:20.170 - 00:14:29.634, Speaker A: That's really the power. And so I think that's ultimately the big unlock that comes from a partnership with circle like this.
00:14:29.752 - 00:14:44.806, Speaker C: And you've tweeted that 70% of USDC usage is from out of the US. Is that one of the drivers that people simply want to keep their savings in US dollar denominated currency or what's driving that?
00:14:44.988 - 00:15:47.494, Speaker A: Yeah, well, it's a few things. I think the first is just the whole blockchain ecosystem, if you think about it, is highly global, right? We know this just in general, there's just huge amounts of the activity are in markets all over the world. And so to the degree that you need a trusted redeemable digital dollar, USDC is a great option. And so it sort of follows the overall growth of that international market as well. However, we've absolutely seen a major uptick in basically that demand for either store of value in dollars. And we've seen that in particular come from emerging markets. And so we've seen growth in emerging markets, latin America, Africa, Southeast Asia, other places like this, where we're seeing just so many startups that are launching things and building partnerships with those major companies, major global companies as well, that are actually embracing this as a way to settle transactions.
00:15:47.494 - 00:16:00.202, Speaker A: So that international dimension is very powerful. And I expect that to continue to be the know. I'm sure we'll get to this in the conversation, but this ties into why should the US government care about dollar coins?
00:16:00.266 - 00:16:03.198, Speaker D: Well, it turns out that it makes.
00:16:03.284 - 00:16:39.980, Speaker A: Digital dollars a powerful export product of the United States, that it enhances the soft power of the country and reinforces the economic interests of households, firms and the government itself. And so there's a strategic alignment of interests between the proliferation of dollar stablecoins, especially ones that are well regulated and really try and follow the law and supervised and national economic interest and foreign policy interest as well, which is for some controversial, but it is a fact.
00:16:40.990 - 00:16:41.354, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:16:41.392 - 00:16:58.530, Speaker C: And you're right, we will definitely unpack that because I know you probably have a lot more to say on that topic. But first, let's go back to the tech development circle. Just released a new programmable, web three wallet platform, that you believe will help businesses offer digital asset payments to customers. Tell us more about that.
00:16:58.680 - 00:17:30.618, Speaker A: Obviously, we're really well known for USDC and the stablecoin that we offer. On the other side of that, USDC itself is a protocol, right? It exists as a dollar protocol that any developer can build on and plug into. And that's happened, right, all across DeFi and wallets and custodians and all kinds of different products and services. They integrate to that protocol, and then they know, oh, I have a safe way for my users to store and transact and settle dollars.
00:17:30.784 - 00:17:32.846, Speaker D: So a lot of the success of.
00:17:32.868 - 00:17:45.458, Speaker A: USDC has really been built on working with developers and working with developers that are trying to create value, and they need a trusted kind of stable coin built into that.
00:17:45.544 - 00:17:46.786, Speaker D: But we see that we can do.
00:17:46.808 - 00:18:35.746, Speaker A: A lot more as a company. Last year, we did a multi hundred million dollar acquisition of a company called CYBAVO that had really, we thought, really outstanding technology for deploying on blockchains, managing and deploying smart contracts, handling wallets and wallet security and all these things. And we got really excited about this category that was not yet emerged, but I think is now emerging of like, web three services. And the analogy is, amazon built their own ecommerce infrastructure and they said, hey, what if we took the infrastructure that was behind that and we started to make that available to developers to build on top of? So web two developers could bring online an application really easily and that gave birth to amazon web services.
00:18:35.848 - 00:18:38.946, Speaker D: And so when you look at if.
00:18:38.968 - 00:19:26.798, Speaker A: You'Re a startup or you're a big company or whoever you are, and you're like, I want to build an app that integrates on top of blockchains. I want to not have to worry about managing the infrastructure of that and the security and the operations and the compliance, the really hard problems. And I want to just focus on delivering a delightful end user experience that is safe for the users and safe for me as a developer. That's a big need. And when we all talk about developers, there's lots of discussion about developers on blockchains and the developer ecosystems on blockchains. And that's a really important thing. As you know, USDC is rolling out on six more chains.
00:19:26.798 - 00:20:29.302, Speaker A: We could talk about that too. But the bottom line is the number of developers that are capable of easily building an app that integrates on blockchains and makes it safe for their users to hold, whether it's an NFT token or a stablecoin and making a payment. The number of developers that can do that today is tiny. There's like 100 million developers in the world that can write software, and there's about a half a million that are able to build on blockchains. And if we want to see Web Two go evolve into this new architecture, we have to dramatically change how easy it is for these developers to build, operate, and run these kinds of apps and services. So for us, we see that as a huge opportunity. It's super aligned with what we're doing with Stablecoins, because at the end of the day, whether it's a commerce app or a financial app or a consumer app or whatever it is, all those apps are going to need to use money and they're going to need to move money.
00:20:29.302 - 00:20:39.478, Speaker A: And we can make it super seamless and take advantage of breakthroughs that are happening in blockchain infrastructure and EVMs and other abstractions, which we can talk about here as well.
00:20:39.564 - 00:20:41.894, Speaker D: We can make that so simple that.
00:20:41.932 - 00:20:46.614, Speaker A: It just proliferates the number of useful apps, and we want to grow the number of useful apps.
00:20:46.742 - 00:20:47.946, Speaker D: And if we grow the number of.
00:20:47.968 - 00:21:16.386, Speaker A: Useful apps and they're plugged into our protocols like USDC, that grows the network and it grows the network utility. And if we can do that, that will generate a lot of value for us. And so this is a new revenue line. We're monetizing it like, AWS, it's like pay as you go. It's utility pricing. And if there's a hugely successful app, we can generate a lot of revenue, but it's very affordable. You can just get in and go.
00:21:16.386 - 00:21:52.960, Speaker A: And it's truly self service. And so it's actually going back to my own roots. Not a lot of people know, but I started my career building developer platforms, programming languages, some of the most popular web development tools ever in history. I was the creator of back in Web 10 and Web 20. And so I love these kinds of products. And I think it's a really important moment and I think it represents a shift in who circle is as well from sort of the stablecoin issuer to being more of a platform oriented business in this whole Web Three space.
00:21:53.650 - 00:22:20.934, Speaker C: I imagine it's probably a little bit more fun for you than the regulatory stuff. It's just my speculation, but I wanted to ask about the blockchains. You're adding six new ones, you said, and is that driven by demand that you're seeing like, developers on that side or DeFi builders are saying we need this, or is it you saying, we just want to make sure that if any of these take off that we're going to be there? How are you making those decisions?
00:22:21.062 - 00:22:34.490, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a little bit of both. There are obviously hundreds of blockchains out there, right? And we're not going to go and launch native USDC on hundreds of blockchains.
00:22:34.570 - 00:22:35.566, Speaker D: There are many of those that are.
00:22:35.588 - 00:22:57.250, Speaker A: There'S like a lot of dead chains, right? I'm not going to name names, but there's a long list and there's people like, I mean, how many new opstack, layer two s are launching? There's all these right, there's so much proliferation. What's clear to me is that right.
00:22:57.320 - 00:23:00.386, Speaker D: Now there's still a lot of ongoing.
00:23:00.418 - 00:23:46.034, Speaker A: Innovation happening in both layer one and layer two. Given what I've just described in terms of the actual number of apps and the actual number of users of those apps, we're still in the early stages of the maturation of that. But it's very likely that in the coming few years, you're going to start to see some power law curve type of adoption. And you'll see maybe there'll be five different layer ones and layer twos that take up whatever, 80% of the market. But right now, there is a lot of innovation and competition and there's like completely new architectures that are coming out and there's still really hard problems to solve around privacy, security, scalability. There's still hard problems to solve that haven't been solved. We want to be omnichan.
00:23:46.034 - 00:24:16.334, Speaker A: We want to make sure that if there is an infrastructure that has a strong technical innovation and has some amount of developer traction or we believe is going to have developer traction, we're going to work with that and do that. And so a lot of it reflects that. And we're not done right. We're going to continue to be omnichan and experiment with that as well. But at the same time, the other products that we're building are designed so.
00:24:16.372 - 00:24:19.086, Speaker D: That you could build an app that.
00:24:19.108 - 00:24:27.166, Speaker A: Is MultiChain as well. So our web three services and smart contract platform and so on will target multiple chains.
00:24:27.358 - 00:24:29.310, Speaker D: And then we're also trying to solve.
00:24:29.470 - 00:24:46.710, Speaker A: Interoperability issues as well, which is a huge issue that exists in a world where there are multiple layer ones and layer twos, and no one thinks that's going to end. We've really had a horrible, horrible way for people to move their dollars around, which is these bridges.
00:24:47.050 - 00:24:50.058, Speaker D: And you have all these bridges and.
00:24:50.144 - 00:25:00.918, Speaker A: The bridges, basically you'll lock the USDC and then wrap it, and then there's like a wrapped version of USDC that's moving on these bridges.
00:25:01.014 - 00:25:10.314, Speaker D: It's slow, it exposes these huge honey pots for hackers. And so many of the highest profile.
00:25:10.362 - 00:25:29.554, Speaker A: Hacks have been of bridges, basically where there's been know, the developers have a multi SIG and someone gets a key. I mean, it's awful. And we're talking about like a billion dollars. It's terrible. And USDC is in fact the most bridged asset in the whole ecosystem. USDC is the most bridged asset.
00:25:29.602 - 00:25:35.654, Speaker D: And so we built and launched a.
00:25:35.692 - 00:25:51.870, Speaker A: Cross chain transfer protocol for USDC that it's called CCTP. Basically allows a user or a developer building an app, but just say we'll call it a user to actually teleport USDC from one chain to another without.
00:25:51.940 - 00:25:55.374, Speaker D: A bridge, without locking these, without any.
00:25:55.412 - 00:26:55.854, Speaker A: Incremental fees, so you're not paying for a liquidity provider to make that transfer. And we're able to do that because we are the canonical mint of USDC. And what that means is if I have on on Arbitrum, and I want to send that USDC on Arbitrum to a wallet on base or optimism or on main net, like, I can teleport it directly and it will burn the USDC on that one side and it will mint the USDC on the other side. So it's faster, safer, and there's no capital inefficiency. And so it's a huge way to provide safe, interoperable digital dollars. And it is an abstraction that allows end users. If I'm an end user and you have a wallet and I have a wallet, I don't really want to care about what layer one or layer two you're on.
00:26:55.854 - 00:26:58.914, Speaker A: I just want to be like, I have USDC, I'm sending you this and you send it back.
00:26:58.952 - 00:27:02.670, Speaker D: It should just work and it should be safe.
00:27:02.830 - 00:27:40.794, Speaker A: And that's what this allows. So we're also, in addition to innovating and bringing USDC to chains, we're also a protocol developer and we're building new protocols that make it safer and easier for people to use these digital dollars on these networks as well. And so, yeah, we're excited. We launched these new chains, some of these new chains last week, and we launched more routes, as we call them, for CCTP as well, last week. And so it's all part of just making this the most useful, safest digital.
00:27:40.842 - 00:27:43.390, Speaker D: Dollar on blockchain networks.
00:27:44.050 - 00:28:02.280, Speaker C: So all of that is super interesting. Circle faced an existential moment earlier this year when $3.3 billion of its reserves were locked in Silicon Valley Bank, which then failed. Since that time, USTC has been losing market share against Tether. What has been your strategy to recover from that event?
00:28:02.650 - 00:28:06.342, Speaker D: Well, there's a bunch of pieces here. I think the first is just to.
00:28:06.476 - 00:28:18.486, Speaker A: Understand how our infrastructure works. And I think one of the key things that we do take a huge amount of pride in is the fact that we have the most transparent disclosures.
00:28:18.678 - 00:28:21.414, Speaker D: In terms of our market infrastructure.
00:28:21.542 - 00:29:07.850, Speaker A: So we disclose all the banks that we work with, we disclose the details on every single bond treasury bill that we hold down to the serial number down to the date. And we actually right now have about 94% of the reserves are held in an SEC registered and supervised structure called the Circle Reserve Fund that BlackRock manages. And you can go to, if you search for USDXX, the ticker, you can go and see within that on a daily basis every single thing there. So you can understand exactly what the safety of this is. And that is a compliant, registered infrastructure. There's no one else that has that in the market. And so we have a very, very high degree of safety and transparency that comes from that.
00:29:07.850 - 00:29:12.010, Speaker A: The second piece, though, is sort of just thinking about what happened.
00:29:12.160 - 00:29:15.322, Speaker D: I think there's some pretty dramatic things.
00:29:15.376 - 00:30:16.510, Speaker A: That happen to the whole industry and obviously, we were unique in that our own specific exposure in terms of a bank, a large publicly traded bank with $170,000,000,000 of assets over the course of a 48 hours period, went through an extraordinary run that had nothing to do with crypto. That was a run that happened when there were essentially disclosures that they had taken huge losses on their own balance sheet, and Goldman Sachs was unsuccessful raising money for them. And so I'm happy to kind of take you through kind of what happened there. But that was a shock that affected the entire US. Financial system. And we still have banks that are failing on a regular basis for similar reasons. But up until the day before the SVB bank failure, they were one of the very well rated a rated financial institutions.
00:30:16.510 - 00:30:25.022, Speaker A: And so it was a true shock. Other than certain hedge funds who had been shorting them, it was a huge shock. The other thing I would say is.
00:30:25.096 - 00:30:28.966, Speaker D: That we have always sought to keep.
00:30:29.068 - 00:30:46.330, Speaker A: Up leveling the market infrastructure that sits underneath USDC. And so that meant having more and more redundancies in terms of the banks that handle the transactions that allow USDC to flow. And just to put it in perspective.
00:30:47.470 - 00:30:50.334, Speaker D: In a matter of ten days, you.
00:30:50.372 - 00:31:24.790, Speaker A: Saw basically three bank failures happen. Two of those banks that failed or were seized were like the critical banking infrastructure for almost every firm in this entire industry. And so you literally had overnight, virtually overnight, you had 5000 plus companies around the world debanked. And there had been this growing pressure from US. Regulators on banks in general, and that is ongoing. But you literally had like 5000 plus companies debanked overnight.
00:31:25.130 - 00:31:27.014, Speaker C: But do you mean crypto companies or.
00:31:27.052 - 00:31:37.098, Speaker A: Just yeah, digital assets companies? Yes, crypto and digital assets companies that banked with companies like Silvergate and Signature, right? They were just boom, like, gone.
00:31:37.264 - 00:31:40.174, Speaker D: Now, we had been doing a number.
00:31:40.212 - 00:31:42.718, Speaker A: Of things prior to all this.
00:31:42.804 - 00:31:46.894, Speaker D: One was we put in place, we.
00:31:46.932 - 00:32:25.322, Speaker A: Created this Circle reserve fund, which we did in our strategic partnership with BlackRock. And we had effectively, by Q one of this year, we had moved over 80% of the reserves into that within the stablecoin space. For the first time ever, you had an SEC registered and supervised structure with all the protections that includes with daily transparency into the safety of that. And that's extraordinary. And again, there's a level of safety and transparency. Now, we also continued to maintain around.
00:32:25.376 - 00:32:29.434, Speaker D: 20% in cash so that we always.
00:32:29.472 - 00:32:34.734, Speaker A: Could meet whatever the most extreme amounts of daily liquidity needs that there could be.
00:32:34.932 - 00:32:37.406, Speaker D: Now, as you're aware, if you're in.
00:32:37.428 - 00:32:47.294, Speaker A: The digital asset industry or you're in the crypto industry, it's not like you can just go and open bank accounts with whoever you want to open bank accounts with. It's extremely difficult to get banks.
00:32:47.422 - 00:32:50.466, Speaker D: And so it's also extremely know a.
00:32:50.488 - 00:32:59.430, Speaker A: Company like Circle who's been compliant. From day one, does things the right way, super transparent, has all of this capability in terms of risk management.
00:33:00.170 - 00:33:01.510, Speaker D: It's not like we get to choose.
00:33:01.580 - 00:33:26.554, Speaker A: Hey, JP morgan, will you hold our reserves? It doesn't work that way. If you're Microsoft, yeah, you can decide which bank you want to put your cash assets in, but that freedom doesn't exist. However, we had been making huge strides in progressing our ability to use what are often called GSIBs globally Systemically important banks as the infrastructure behind USDC.
00:33:26.602 - 00:33:29.242, Speaker D: And in fact, we had just begun.
00:33:29.306 - 00:33:41.266, Speaker A: Doing that for cash for USDC literally in the week or two prior to the SVV collapse. And so we were actually very fortunate, even though all this stuff happened, we.
00:33:41.288 - 00:33:50.406, Speaker D: Were very, very fortunate that literally we were able to sweep everything into the.
00:33:50.428 - 00:33:52.246, Speaker A: Safest GSIB in the world.
00:33:52.428 - 00:33:53.558, Speaker D: And you can go and look at.
00:33:53.564 - 00:33:55.094, Speaker A: Our attestations now and you can look.
00:33:55.132 - 00:33:58.330, Speaker D: And see that, okay, all the cash.
00:33:58.400 - 00:34:08.794, Speaker A: Is with the safest, globally systemically important cash dollar cash custodian in the world and in this trusted reserve fund structure. And so on the other side of.
00:34:08.832 - 00:34:12.714, Speaker D: This, we literally have the safest, most.
00:34:12.752 - 00:34:42.614, Speaker A: Transparent digital dollar on the Internet today. There isn't something that has that level that's there. So in terms of what we're doing about it, we're just continuing to do what we have been doing, which is continue to up level the market infrastructure, to up level the transparency and the like. And the other thing I would say is the debanking that's taken place for this entire industry, the effects of that are still ongoing. I mean, it's become, as you probably are aware from many people that you talk to, it's become a major issue.
00:34:42.812 - 00:34:44.818, Speaker D: What we have been doing is we've.
00:34:44.834 - 00:35:00.522, Speaker A: Made a huge investment in basically building a global liquidity and settlement network for USDC. We're really excited about the progress we're making. We are bringing online banking partnerships in every major region of the world with.
00:35:00.576 - 00:35:04.046, Speaker D: High quality banks that will allow for.
00:35:04.068 - 00:35:31.026, Speaker A: The creation and redemption or the liquidity of USDC in those local markets as well. So you're not dependent on US. Banks for that. So we're making huge what I consider to be just like market infrastructure investments. And the only reason we can do all those and that banks will work with us is because we are a compliant, transparent, risk managed company like some of our competitors. No one knows anything about any of the banks, and they never have. And it's just a huge mystery.
00:35:31.026 - 00:35:54.222, Speaker A: And there's liquidity issues that exist, and it's not clear how you actually redeem that's. Terrifying. It's like terrifying. If we're talking about the future of the financial system, totally shadowy things that no one knows anything about other than public pronouncements, that's really tricky. So other things, though, look, bottom line.
00:35:54.276 - 00:35:59.150, Speaker D: Is we've been impacted by a perception.
00:35:59.650 - 00:36:11.282, Speaker A: That was really in the aftermath of this multifaceted banking cris in the US and the shuddering of banks in the US. And a wave of SEC lawsuits against almost every major US.
00:36:11.336 - 00:36:12.514, Speaker D: Crypto company.
00:36:12.712 - 00:36:19.526, Speaker A: Knock on wood, this huge set of things that happened over the course of, in a concentrated way over the course.
00:36:19.548 - 00:36:33.626, Speaker D: Of about eight weeks, and the rest of the world's reaction was it's not safe to be exposed to the United States. It's not safe to have money in.
00:36:33.648 - 00:36:41.566, Speaker A: An institution that is exposed to the US banking system. It's not safe to be working with firms that are under the supervision of.
00:36:41.588 - 00:36:43.246, Speaker D: Regulators in the United States.
00:36:43.428 - 00:36:44.762, Speaker A: It's actually not safe.
00:36:44.826 - 00:36:51.198, Speaker D: And so what we have seen is a flight from safety and that's been.
00:36:51.284 - 00:36:57.618, Speaker A: Pronounced like there's been a flight from safety and in fact other companies will tout like, we're not exposed to US.
00:36:57.784 - 00:36:58.498, Speaker D: Stuff.
00:36:58.664 - 00:37:27.466, Speaker A: And that's not tenable over the long run, right? That is not tenable over the long run. And if you're up close to these issues, actually there's tremendous progress being made. The Fed actually is coming out with a supervisory framework for banks that deal with crypto. There's clear rules that are merging around stablecoins. There's major financial institutions that are deepening what they're doing here. And so the opposite is ultimately true.
00:37:27.648 - 00:37:34.622, Speaker D: And I think that that flight to safety, that will ultimately be the case. The other thing to note, though, is.
00:37:34.676 - 00:37:37.182, Speaker A: It'S really important is we also have.
00:37:37.236 - 00:37:40.414, Speaker D: A cyclical business when interest rates were.
00:37:40.452 - 00:37:58.306, Speaker A: Zero and there's just massive amounts of capital flowing everywhere, including into crypto, that created an environment where if you had dollars, you could go and go after all kinds of investment and other activities in the blockchain ecosystem.
00:37:58.418 - 00:38:00.310, Speaker D: And so you saw this huge growth.
00:38:01.130 - 00:38:14.086, Speaker A: In stablecoins and we benefited from that. Now you've had these huge increases in rates in a speed that we just haven't seen in decades.
00:38:14.278 - 00:38:16.442, Speaker D: And so the inverse is the case, right?
00:38:16.496 - 00:38:27.034, Speaker A: If you're sitting on a dollar asset and you know, you can go and get five and a quarter percent somewhere.
00:38:27.082 - 00:38:30.094, Speaker D: Else, if you are a customer who.
00:38:30.132 - 00:38:54.038, Speaker A: Has access to the US banking system and the TradFi system, you're going to do that. It's just like obvious. And in fact, I have a chart, maybe I can send it for your show notes. But basically if you look at effectively like Stablecoin Supply, where it was in April of 2022, which is when the first rate hike happened, and then rate hikes, they're directly inversely correlated. But we're actually in this funny position.
00:38:54.124 - 00:38:57.570, Speaker D: Where coinbase and Circle have great banking.
00:38:57.650 - 00:39:41.910, Speaker A: Relatively speaking, and we actually provide a way to redeem one for one at no cost into banks. And so we have the TradFi layer and that's like part of why people love USDC and part of why they trust this product as well. But that also subjects to being kind of the off ramp as well. It's like, it's harder to off ramp out of certain other products, but it's actually quite easy to off ramp through USDC. So we've had that as an impact. But I would say the broader impact is truly macrocyclical, which is in a high rate environment. Yes, we're generating significant amounts of revenue and we just publicly disclosed our full year last year and our first half revenue and income and EBITDA.
00:39:41.910 - 00:39:47.586, Speaker A: And it's very significant. So despite our circulation issues, like, we're.
00:39:47.618 - 00:39:50.090, Speaker D: Seeing very high year over year growth.
00:39:50.830 - 00:39:55.882, Speaker A: And cash flow as well. But it is this macrocyclical piece.
00:39:55.936 - 00:39:58.106, Speaker D: And so I think I'm taking a.
00:39:58.128 - 00:40:00.074, Speaker A: Long term view on this, which is.
00:40:00.192 - 00:40:02.830, Speaker D: Build the best infrastructure, build the most.
00:40:02.900 - 00:40:31.346, Speaker A: Compliant regulated infrastructure, build the best banking infrastructure, the most transparency, do things the right way, make it work. Make it work for any company, any fintech, any fi, make that work. Build great things for developers, and the rest will follow. And the macrocyclical piece is going to be there. As interest rates come down, you get to a neutral interest rate environment, and then what people do with their dollars starts to shift.
00:40:31.458 - 00:40:41.286, Speaker D: It's worth noting, since interest rates started going up, banks have lost a trillion dollars of deposits. You can look at the chart that's.
00:40:41.318 - 00:40:57.578, Speaker A: This Federal Reserve data, the Fred database, you can look it up. From April of last year till now, banks have lost a trillion dollars of deposits. Money market funds have gained about $800 billion. And so it's the same phenomenon that's.
00:40:57.594 - 00:41:00.302, Speaker D: At work there as well. Yeah.
00:41:00.356 - 00:41:11.620, Speaker C: So in a moment, we're going to look at how regulation will impact circle and also the introduction of a stablecoin by PayPal. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make the show possible.

00:43:33.252 - 00:43:43.090, Speaker C: Conversation with Jeremy PayPal, recently introduced to Stablecoin, and they are a behemoth in terms of payments. How does Circle Antenna compete there?
00:43:43.240 - 00:44:29.090, Speaker A: I'd say a few things. I think, first of all, as the day they launched, I was, I think, quite complimentary and congratulatory to PayPal and Paxos because it's a good partnership for Paxos. And I think it's wonderful to see a major mainstream payment company embrace dollar stablecoins. And so we're excited about that. Just from the perspective of I think this is a very clear indicator that there's enough regulatory clarity in the world around Stablecoins that major companies are getting into this market. And as regulation comes into place, that's exactly what you want to see. You want to see an open, free, competitive market.
00:44:29.090 - 00:44:56.026, Speaker A: And as that regulation becomes available, there's a baseline of safety that's there as well for the market that everyone can depend on. And you'll see a lot more competition. So we fully expect to see more competition, not less competition, not just in the US. But around the world, because stablecoin laws are dropping. So, first of all, I think that's just, from an overall perspective, a positive thing. Now, in terms of how do we.
00:44:56.048 - 00:44:59.786, Speaker D: Compete, I focus less on sort of.
00:44:59.888 - 00:45:24.622, Speaker A: The competitor and more on what are the things that we do that we think are really valuable and important that people will depend on. And I think part of what has made USDC so successful is that we're a kind of market neutral infrastructure company, right? We're not competing for merchants. We're not competing for retail users. We don't have a consumer wallet.
00:45:24.766 - 00:45:28.358, Speaker D: We are purely a market neutral infrastructure company.
00:45:28.524 - 00:46:16.030, Speaker A: And we think about USDC as like a dollar utility for the Internet, and we want to work with tons of different companies to build on top of that. And I think that makes us unique. I think PayPal has a lot of great partners as well, but they have a franchise. They have a, you know, fees to merchants to collect payments using credit cards, and they have a franchise of end users. And so there are lots of people who would view that as competitive. And we've been able to build great partnerships with lots of firms who might view each other as competitive, right? Robinhood and Coinbase probably look at each other as competitive. We have a partnership with Block.
00:46:16.030 - 00:46:44.334, Speaker A: We have a partnership with Stripe. We have partnerships with Visa and Mastercard, with MoneyGram, with a lot of different firms that are depending on and using USDC in different ways. And it's, I think, our market neutral position that is really important. So I think that's going to continue to be important as this grows. And what's exciting to me when I look at where we were a few years ago compared to where we are now, it's obviously enormously different.
00:46:44.452 - 00:46:47.438, Speaker D: But even just like twelve months ago.
00:46:47.604 - 00:47:10.498, Speaker A: The range of mainstream companies that are engaging on this and who are working on things with USDC, it's totally night and day. And so I'm really excited. I'm really excited as we launch partnerships in the coming quarters because we're just sort of seeing like the Mercado Libre examples just is a great one, that's.
00:47:10.514 - 00:47:13.126, Speaker D: A company with 200 million users, PayPal has.
00:47:13.228 - 00:47:20.630, Speaker A: However, 100 million. Coinbase, a great partner of ours, has 100 million USDC supported in the finance wallet. They have 100 million users.
00:47:20.710 - 00:47:21.002, Speaker D: Right?
00:47:21.056 - 00:47:49.138, Speaker A: So we have reach, and we're continuing to add great partners that have reach. And that's what's important. What's the reach that's there? And then our strategy is really different. Like, we're building developer platforms, we're building infrastructure platforms, we're building protocol layers. And that's how we want to grow this. We feel good about our position. We think we can continue to be.
00:47:49.304 - 00:47:53.602, Speaker D: A very meaningful part of the market, but we welcome the competition as well.
00:47:53.736 - 00:48:17.930, Speaker C: All right, let's finally turn to regulation. In late July, a stablecoin bill that many had anticipated would receive bipartisan support instead moved out of committee in the House, supported only by Republicans. Around that time, you made some remarks to the House Financial Services Committee on ways that you thought this bill could be improved. Before we get to your specific suggestions, tell us what you like about the mean.
00:48:18.000 - 00:48:40.350, Speaker A: I think a couple things. First know, the bill did move out of committee with bipartisan support. It wasn't broad based. It was definitely with bipartisan support, but it didn't have ranking Member Waters on board. Right. There were five Democrats that voted alongside the Republicans to move it out of committee.
00:48:40.510 - 00:48:45.842, Speaker D: I think the bill accomplishes a lot.
00:48:45.976 - 00:48:55.494, Speaker A: And my view, I'm very up close to the issues here and very up close to the politics here as well, which is that what's really interesting is.
00:48:55.532 - 00:49:02.218, Speaker D: That this is a piece of legislation that everyone wants to get done.
00:49:02.384 - 00:49:17.470, Speaker A: The Fed wants it, treasury wants it, congress wants it. The White House wants it. It's a priority that has been set by the highest levels of the administration that we need to have dollar stablecoin regulation in the United States.
00:49:17.540 - 00:49:20.702, Speaker D: So it is a national priority and.
00:49:20.756 - 00:49:23.410, Speaker A: People are working hard to get that done.
00:49:23.560 - 00:49:24.786, Speaker D: And the US.
00:49:24.888 - 00:49:30.866, Speaker A: Just to remind people the US led the way globally to go to the.
00:49:30.888 - 00:49:34.002, Speaker D: G 20 and say, everyone here, everybody.
00:49:34.056 - 00:49:37.666, Speaker A: At this table, all of you guys and gals, all of you nations at.
00:49:37.688 - 00:49:41.670, Speaker D: The table, you need to have stablecoin regulation in place.
00:49:41.740 - 00:49:48.006, Speaker A: And they all agreed. We're all going to put stablecoin regulation in place. They agreed on the principles of it, and then they went off to their.
00:49:48.028 - 00:49:50.358, Speaker D: Governments to say, okay, let's go get it done.
00:49:50.524 - 00:49:58.858, Speaker A: Hong Kong's getting it done. Singapore is getting it done. Japan's already got it done. The EU's already got it done. The UK is about to get it done.
00:49:58.944 - 00:50:00.026, Speaker D: It's getting done.
00:50:00.128 - 00:50:01.902, Speaker A: So people are doing what they said they do.
00:50:01.956 - 00:50:08.526, Speaker D: The US has a little bit of a longer legislative process, but everyone wants.
00:50:08.548 - 00:50:26.050, Speaker A: To get it done, which is great. So the probability of there being stablecoin regulation is high. The specific bill that came out of committee, I don't think is the bill that will be signed into law because there are key things that are still.
00:50:26.120 - 00:50:29.766, Speaker D: Important to the administration and to the.
00:50:29.788 - 00:50:32.674, Speaker A: Fed that just haven't quite been resolved.
00:50:32.802 - 00:50:36.246, Speaker D: And so a lot of this has to do with how much of a.
00:50:36.268 - 00:50:48.086, Speaker A: Role does the Federal Reserve play in not just setting the standards? So right now, the bill that went out of committee, basically the Fed sets the floor. They say, here's all of the requirements.
00:50:48.278 - 00:50:49.850, Speaker D: And they define that.
00:50:50.000 - 00:51:54.622, Speaker A: But I think there's a debate over like, does the Fed get to veto who gets a stablecoin license or does the Fed have any specific supervision if it's a state, like New York State issues a stablecoin charter to someone, does the Fed have any joint or dual supervisory role? It's kind of technocratic, but it's actually really important stuff that has to do with states rights and federal rights and the balance of power and the like. But it's like down to those kinds of issues. But overall, what I like about it, to get back to your question, is it creates a clear pathway for bank and non bank stablecoin issuers. It creates a role for the states and the federal government. It sets a very clear and very high bar on the Prudential supervisory requirements. It's very specific about reserves, transparency, risk management, like all the things that are needed. And it effectively creates legal certainty that a dollar coin is a part of the global financial system.
00:51:54.622 - 00:51:56.082, Speaker A: It is a part of the US.
00:51:56.136 - 00:51:59.058, Speaker D: Dollar financial system, which will mean that.
00:51:59.224 - 00:52:44.446, Speaker A: Accountants know how to deal with this, whether you're a public company or private company, that financial institutions will be able to hold it just like cash or will it will unlock massive mainstream usage of this as that happens. So there's a lot to like about there's. You know, it'll be interesting to know we're just getting back into the congressional session. It'll be interesting to see how this moves in the Senate and as well through the House but we remain optimistic that the United States is going to ultimately do the right thing and preserve and protect the interest of the dollar on the Internet.
00:52:44.558 - 00:52:47.826, Speaker D: And as I've said many times, the.
00:52:47.848 - 00:53:08.614, Speaker A: Future of currency competition is technological competition. And it's technology on the Internet that is driving that. And it's a question of are you going to unleash open networks, free market competition, private sector innovation, private sector technical innovation, which is what the United States has historically done to compete. And that's why the American Internet and.
00:53:08.652 - 00:53:11.946, Speaker D: Technology universe is so strong and they.
00:53:11.968 - 00:53:21.610, Speaker A: Have to make that choice. Do you want to compete that way or follow the way of authoritarian regimes that are trying to build monopolistic systems over money?
00:53:21.760 - 00:53:42.386, Speaker C: Yeah, one thing that I noticed amongst your suggestions that especially piqued my interest was you made the request to revise the bill so that stablecoin issuers be allowed to access Federal Reserve account services. And I'm sure your experience with SVB informed that request. What's the reception been like to this idea?
00:53:42.568 - 00:54:15.270, Speaker A: So actually for years, well, prior to the most recent banking crisis, and really a fundamental premise of the company when we founded it ten years ago, is that we need to move to a full reserve banking system. And I think that's sort of implicit in some of the economic philosophy that undergirds even things like Bitcoin, like Austrian economic philosophy. You can't fractionally reserve bitcoin. I mean, you could do it like maybe Sam Bankman free did, but yeah.
00:54:15.440 - 00:54:16.960, Speaker C: Nobody do that, please.
00:54:17.730 - 00:55:17.870, Speaker A: If you have a database and you're telling people you have an IOU and you could do that, but at a physical level, bitcoin can't be fractionally reserved. Right. But the idea of a full reserve banking system is something that I've been passionate about for a very long time. And there's a similar economic philosophy that emerged after the Great Depression when bank failures cascaded across the United States. There was a big debate about, well, how do you deal with this, these banks that were all going under? And there were two options that were very seriously discussed. One is called the Chicago Plan, and that was a group of prominent economists, irving Fisher out of Chicago School, but many, many others that basically said we need to have a separation between the payment utility of money and lending, and we need to have full reserve money. And so it's still sovereign money, meaning it's still like a government obligation, but it's fully reserved.
00:55:17.870 - 00:55:37.026, Speaker A: And banks can't create money themselves. They can't fractionally reserve, they can lend, but only with money that's fully reserved. And that was a big argument. And the argument was that that would result in a safer financial system where there's less inherent risk and less tendency to boom and bust and would likely.
00:55:37.058 - 00:55:41.094, Speaker D: Lead to fewer recessions. Well, there was another view, which was.
00:55:41.132 - 00:56:30.618, Speaker A: Actually the view of the banks, which was, no, we want to be able to do fractional reserve, but let's just create an insurance pool. And we'll have an insurance pool and the insurance pool will basically we'll all chip in insurance and if one of us fails, then we can draw on their insurance and pay for the failures, but we get to do this risk taking stuff. And that was the formation of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the FDIC. I think commercial interest won out then and that's been revisited over and over throughout time. When the savings and loan crisis happened in the 1980s, again after the financial crisis, after 2008, that's when I took a real interest in all of this. It's what got me into crypto was how does this fractional reserve banking system really work? What is central bank money? How can we improve on this? That's what got me in all of this. Before I even knew about Bitcoin, it was sort of I was interested in all this.
00:56:30.618 - 00:57:07.730, Speaker A: So I've always wanted there to be a model for full reserve dollars. And I believe that if you have the technological superpowers of Blockchains and the internet and you have this incredible programmable money that moves at the velocity and speed and efficiency of the Internet, that the ideal underlying basis for that should be a full reserve money and that it should be government obligation money. So it should be either cash held at the Fed or kind of short term government obligations like treasury bills. And that if you had that, then.
00:57:07.800 - 00:57:10.534, Speaker D: Everyone would know this is as close.
00:57:10.572 - 00:57:28.522, Speaker A: To cash as possible. This is like the safest thing as possible and they'd be willing to use it very broadly as a medium of exchange. And that's really what we strive to and we're really close to that. The only thing is right now, the cash piece of what we have, we have to hold it in commercial banks. And I've always been nervous about that.
00:57:28.656 - 00:57:31.214, Speaker D: And that turned out to be something.
00:57:31.252 - 00:57:49.202, Speaker A: To be nervous about. And so now we are fortunate in that we're holding the cash almost entirely with one of the very safest, globally systemically important banks in the world, which means it kind of has a government backstop behind it. So we have still a very safe place.
00:57:49.256 - 00:57:52.386, Speaker D: But I do think the proper design.
00:57:52.488 - 00:58:02.870, Speaker A: On digital dollars and private sector intermediated digital dollars, which is what we're talking about here, is something where you can take advantage of that central bank facility.
00:58:03.610 - 00:58:10.460, Speaker C: But are you seeing that people on Capitol Hill agree that that would be a good step and something to put in this bill?
00:58:11.070 - 00:58:12.346, Speaker A: I don't think we're going to see.
00:58:12.368 - 00:58:13.386, Speaker D: That in this bill.
00:58:13.488 - 00:58:20.174, Speaker A: I think the bank lobby is quite seriously opposed to it. And so I don't think we'll see.
00:58:20.212 - 00:58:22.400, Speaker D: That in this bill.
00:58:22.850 - 00:58:43.940, Speaker A: I think the reserve requirements in terms of the assets, I think go a long way to ensuring that the reserve assets can be extraordinarily safe and you can kind of get to like 98% of the safety that you'd have. That may be a fight for another day.
00:58:44.790 - 00:59:11.870, Speaker C: Another suggestion you made was for the bill to define what would be a legitimate US dollar stablecoin versus what you called counterfeit ones. And honestly, some of your comments earlier where it felt like you were throwing shade at Tether without naming them, maybe what you were thinking about when you were talking about these quote, unquote counterfeit dollars. So how do you think this legitimate US dollar stable coin? What definition would you like to see there?
00:59:12.020 - 00:59:16.042, Speaker A: Well, I mean, I think to quote.
00:59:16.106 - 00:59:19.338, Speaker D: And literally quote Jay Powell, the chairman.
00:59:19.354 - 00:59:22.706, Speaker A: Of the Federal Reserve, his view is.
00:59:22.728 - 00:59:27.186, Speaker D: That stablecoins are dollar money creation and.
00:59:27.368 - 00:59:34.754, Speaker A: That is the responsibility of the federal government to define what is legitimate dollar money creation, what is actually considered a.
00:59:34.792 - 00:59:39.190, Speaker D: Dollar instrument in the global financial system.
00:59:39.340 - 00:59:45.586, Speaker A: And I think in particular, if it's something that is determined to be equivalent.
00:59:45.618 - 00:59:49.122, Speaker D: To cash, that from an accounting perspective.
00:59:49.186 - 00:59:57.638, Speaker A: From a balance sheet perspective that everyone understands that way there ought to be a very high bar. And if you're out there saying you're.
00:59:57.734 - 01:00:00.602, Speaker D: A dollar and you're not meeting the.
01:00:00.656 - 01:00:13.442, Speaker A: Standards and requirements of the law to be a digital dollar, then you shouldn't be able to be out there parading as one. And so that's, I think, more or less the view. And so my own view is that.
01:00:13.496 - 01:00:18.622, Speaker D: There need to be consistent prudential standards.
01:00:18.766 - 01:00:35.798, Speaker A: For these fiat stablecoins around the world. And I think you're seeing that, you're seeing that it's basically the central banks in all of these major G 20 jurisdictions. They're basically all coming to the same conclusion. And the law is basically quite similar.
01:00:35.964 - 01:00:41.546, Speaker D: In all these places. And so I think over time we.
01:00:41.568 - 01:01:03.402, Speaker A: Will certainly be in a world where if you're offering a digital currency, a fiat digital currency, you're going to have to be under this kind of robust regulatory regime or you're not going to be able to be used. So I think that that's sort of the direction of travel that's happening right now.
01:01:03.476 - 01:01:08.740, Speaker D: And it'll take two or three years to play out, but it seems pretty clear.
01:01:09.110 - 01:02:10.630, Speaker C: So as you've alluded to earlier in the conversation, there are all these discussions happening around the world and they're different in different places. Partially an analogy similar to what we saw with, for instance, Blockbuster or many of these previous kodak. There's all these previous companies we've seen with the Internet that just they were the dominant force in that industry. And because the upstarts had more motivation to find use in this new technology, they were able to take them out. And pretty you know, I hate to say it because I know a lot of lawmakers and regulators listen to the show, but sometimes when I'm covering this face, I feel like the same thing is happening with the US government and the US dollar. Hopefully, I'm wrong about, you know, obviously you are interfacing with these different jurisdictions. And one probably really notable country that has focused on blockchain technology and on central bank digital currency is China.
01:02:10.630 - 01:02:21.370, Speaker C: They've rolled out its digital yuan fairly quickly. And I just wondered what your thoughts were as you're seeing the contrast between these two governments and how they approach stablecoins and central bank digital currencies.
01:02:22.270 - 01:02:34.974, Speaker A: I think China does not have a specific regulatory position on still. They're not, to my knowledge, working on.
01:02:35.012 - 01:02:43.200, Speaker D: Specific new rules for stablecoin issuers in China. However, I wouldn't be surprised to see that happen.
01:02:43.650 - 01:02:51.234, Speaker A: I think know, if you look at the state of play, the priority in.
01:02:51.272 - 01:02:59.800, Speaker D: Most jurisdictions from the government is get stablecoin regulations in place as quickly as possible.
01:03:00.170 - 01:03:13.014, Speaker A: And so stablecoin rules for euro stablecoins are becoming model law and that'll be years before there's a digital euro from the ECB. Stablecoin rules in Japan have been effective.
01:03:13.062 - 01:03:16.154, Speaker D: Since this June, and it's not even.
01:03:16.192 - 01:03:26.382, Speaker A: Clear that there'll ever be a CBDC in Japan. And so the priority, including in the United States, I mean, the Fed has made it clear we are not working.
01:03:26.436 - 01:03:31.294, Speaker D: On a so the priority is there.
01:03:31.332 - 01:03:44.270, Speaker A: Is private sector digital currency initiatives. There needs to be safeguards and rules, and there needs to be a fair market for competition with technology, innovators banks, non banks, et cetera.
01:03:44.430 - 01:03:49.222, Speaker D: That's the priority because that is the here and now.
01:03:49.356 - 01:03:58.266, Speaker A: And so I think as that happens, as every major jurisdiction in the world is supervising private sector innovation in the.
01:03:58.288 - 01:04:05.034, Speaker D: Space, I think China will have no choice other than to also unleash their.
01:04:05.072 - 01:04:08.598, Speaker A: Own creative, technological competitive capabilities.
01:04:08.774 - 01:04:20.218, Speaker D: Now, it may be that an R B stablecoin, that's privately intermediated could actually be a more attractive instrument to businesses.
01:04:20.314 - 01:04:22.206, Speaker A: And others around the world than the.
01:04:22.228 - 01:04:24.546, Speaker D: Actual CBDC because you kind of want.
01:04:24.568 - 01:05:01.114, Speaker A: An air gap between you and the, you know, that's a real think. Does a big corporation that's settling transactions cross border with China? Do they want the government's systems reaching into their own technology environment? Probably not. And so private intermediation, it could be backed by a central bank digital currency. And that's kind of where I think over the very long run in the United States, we'll see we'll see upgrades.
01:05:01.162 - 01:05:07.854, Speaker D: To the wholesale kind of core technology infrastructure of the central bank, and then.
01:05:07.892 - 01:05:35.078, Speaker A: Private intermediation will integrate to that. But it'll principally be kind of stablecoins and the kind of rapid, constant innovation cycle that comes with open infrastructure and technology innovation that will kind of be what is, quote unquote, retail, what's touching businesses and end users directly. And I think my own belief is that something like that will probably emerge for China as well in the future.
01:05:35.244 - 01:05:45.660, Speaker C: And do you think that in the US. Those developments will happen quickly enough that the global reserve currency status of the US dollar will remain in place?
01:05:46.750 - 01:06:01.662, Speaker D: Well, I think the US. Needs. To be aggressively taking action right now and unleashing competitive digital dollars on the Internet is one of the best things that the US.
01:06:01.716 - 01:06:21.042, Speaker A: Could be doing right now. And I certainly have made that case in testimony, and I make that case in person to a lot of people in Washington. But it's a very clear thing that can be done, because then it's about you're fighting for the hearts and minds of users in the world, businesses, households.
01:06:21.106 - 01:06:24.086, Speaker D: Others that are making decisions as they.
01:06:24.108 - 01:06:26.550, Speaker A: Turn on their computer or their smartphone.
01:06:27.850 - 01:06:29.866, Speaker D: And I think the United States, I.
01:06:29.888 - 01:06:40.426, Speaker A: Think the dollar remains the most resilient, most attractive reserve currency in the world. It remains the safest asset in the world.
01:06:40.608 - 01:06:44.686, Speaker D: And I think that can certainly continue.
01:06:44.788 - 01:06:51.946, Speaker A: If the United States is willing to kind of get behind some of these transformations that are needed in the safety.
01:06:51.978 - 01:06:55.374, Speaker D: Of the dollar and the technological competitiveness of the dollar.
01:06:55.502 - 01:07:08.054, Speaker C: So aside from the suggestions that you made to the House bill on stablecoins earlier, are there any aspects of stablecoin regulation from other jurisdictions that you would like to see adopted in the US.
01:07:08.252 - 01:07:32.094, Speaker A: Well, so what I'm seeing in some places are proposals to have stablecoin issuers, have direct access to central bank clearing facilities. So, for example, I think that would be, as I've already recommended in the US. I think that would be a positive step. I think one of the things that you're seeing as well is, and this.
01:07:32.132 - 01:07:36.046, Speaker D: Is very new, there are provisions in.
01:07:36.068 - 01:07:48.546, Speaker A: Japan, for example, that are dealing with effectively various forms of reciprocity with kind of foreign issued stablecoins. And I think that's really important as well is that we can get to.
01:07:48.568 - 01:07:51.074, Speaker D: Kind of like for, like, treatment, so.
01:07:51.112 - 01:08:44.926, Speaker A: That if I'm a business or I'm in the capital markets in Japan, that the regulators in Japan will acknowledge something like USDC as an instrument in their markets, so long as there's regulatory equivalence in terms of the various safeguards that need to be in place. So I think that's something that we're seeing initial ideas around from other jurisdictions that's not explicitly addressed in the US. Stablecoin legislation right now. And it's a hard issue. There'll be iteration around this, but ultimately, because these are digital assets that this move on the Internet and can show up in any digital wallet, it's just where are the private keys? Who has them? I think the cross jurisdictional issues is an issue that has to be considered, and I'd like to see that considered.
01:08:44.958 - 01:08:46.754, Speaker D: More here in the US.
01:08:46.952 - 01:08:54.802, Speaker C: You've tweeted that crypto has the tools to unlock better KYC or know your customer processes for dealing with things like anti money laundering.
01:08:54.946 - 01:08:58.374, Speaker D: What did you mean by mean like.
01:08:58.412 - 01:09:02.314, Speaker A: Take take as an example, what was it?
01:09:02.512 - 01:09:05.660, Speaker D: There was just a huge breach of.
01:09:07.630 - 01:09:52.202, Speaker A: The company that was involved in safeguarding the customer information associated with the I don't know if it was the FTX bankruptcy or the BlockFi bankruptcy that was compromised, and all the KYC information was sort of made available publicly. Right. Well, how does that happen? Well, right now, if you're a financial institution, the way that the AML rules work and the way that the KYC rules work is that if you're interacting, you, the financial institution, are interacting with another financial institution, you have to exchange the personal information of your customers. Whether it's a person or a business, you have to exchange that information. So all these different financial institutions, whether.
01:09:52.256 - 01:09:56.134, Speaker D: They'Re a startup fintech or a giant.
01:09:56.182 - 01:10:21.314, Speaker A: Bank, or a broker dealer, or any market participant, you have this vast amounts of proliferation of your personal information. And so your PII is being broadcast over and over and over, and it's basically showing up in these honey pots everywhere. And so, yes, there are SoC standards and security standards and safeguarding standards, but.
01:10:21.352 - 01:10:23.282, Speaker D: At the end of the day, you.
01:10:23.336 - 01:10:37.222, Speaker A: As a person are having your personal information just blasted out everywhere. Well, crypto is I mean, obviously crypto is a loaded word, but it's cryptography. And there's innovations in cryptography that are.
01:10:37.276 - 01:10:41.530, Speaker D: Constantly happening that allow for proofs without.
01:10:41.600 - 01:10:51.158, Speaker A: Actually having to share the information. So zero knowledge proofs are like the most commonly referred to way to do that. But there's other types of cryptographic proofs.
01:10:51.174 - 01:10:53.290, Speaker D: Where you can have a proof that.
01:10:53.360 - 01:11:22.614, Speaker A: Shows up as, like, a certificate. It's a provable certificate that is like a credential. That credential then can be shown to someone, and that relying party can say, oh, you have a KYC credential. And that KYC credential was issued by a legitimate firm that has compliance with certain rigorous standards of knowing who their users are. And I'm able to rely on that, and I don't need you to give me all the person's information.
01:11:22.812 - 01:11:30.374, Speaker D: And so there's a way to basically make, using cryptographic proofs, using digital credentials.
01:11:30.422 - 01:11:50.906, Speaker A: These cryptographic credentials to allow people to more safely interact without giving up their private information. And it allows for things like selective disclosure as well, which is the most common example being, if my daughter walks into a bar, why is it that she has to legally give the bartender.
01:11:50.938 - 01:11:54.222, Speaker D: Her address and her name? Like, why?
01:11:54.276 - 01:11:55.626, Speaker A: That doesn't make any sense.
01:11:55.748 - 01:11:56.034, Speaker D: Right?
01:11:56.072 - 01:12:10.530, Speaker A: So why can't we just prove that we're of age? Why can't we present a credential from a digital wallet that proves that I'm of a certain age, and I've biometrically proven that I'm actually the holder of that? And so all this is crypto.
01:12:10.610 - 01:12:10.998, Speaker D: Right.
01:12:11.084 - 01:12:28.726, Speaker A: Crypto. I'm really excited about basically various types of the use of cryptographic credentials. NFTs zero knowledge proofs, this whole kind of collection of technologies that are totally becoming mainstream or have the potential to become mainstream.
01:12:28.918 - 01:12:32.382, Speaker D: We can do a better job at.
01:12:32.436 - 01:13:07.334, Speaker A: Proving identity without giving up our privacy. So we can have privacy preservation and proof of identity, and we can even have ways that financial institutions can exchange proofs without having to create these huge honeypots as well. So that will require that, say, the US treasury Department that sets the rules for kind of anti money laundering policy for financial institutions or the global body, the Financial Action Task Force Fatif, that sets the standards for what they require. It's sort of consortium of all the governments decide you do need to say.
01:13:07.372 - 01:13:12.022, Speaker D: Yeah, we want to enable safer, privacy.
01:13:12.086 - 01:13:20.940, Speaker A: Preserving, but still very rock solid identity checks and so there's a way to do it and leverage crypto to solve those problems.
01:13:21.250 - 01:13:40.434, Speaker C: All right, well, final question. You have made a number of points throughout the show about what you'd like to see from US regulation. But I just thought I would give you one last opportunity if there's any message specifically that you'd like to send to regulators and lawmakers, what would that be?
01:13:40.632 - 01:13:47.686, Speaker A: Look, I think there's a couple of things. I'll be a little bit of a broken record on the stablecoin issue, which.
01:13:47.708 - 01:13:49.718, Speaker D: Is just that we have a moment.
01:13:49.804 - 01:14:23.834, Speaker A: It's a here and now moment. There's a dollar competitiveness issue. There's a national competitiveness issue. There's a industry and market competitiveness issue. And while it's very easy to look at the people who've committed frauds or the companies that have run Ponzi schemes or the people who've been bad actors and say it's all crap, that is just not the case. We're right on the cusp of, I think, a very strong framework that would be very powerful for the US. The US dollar for industry competitiveness, et cetera.
01:14:23.834 - 01:14:27.602, Speaker A: So that I feel strongly about. The other thing I would say is.
01:14:27.656 - 01:14:31.506, Speaker D: That there really tends to be and.
01:14:31.528 - 01:14:32.962, Speaker A: This isn't just in the United States.
01:14:33.016 - 01:14:35.554, Speaker D: But it's everywhere in the world blockchain.
01:14:35.602 - 01:15:37.042, Speaker A: Technology is colored through the lens as a financial technology. And I think it's really important that policymakers understand that we're talking about general purpose Internet infrastructure, general purpose Internet computing infrastructure, data infrastructure. It's a really important general purpose infrastructure that's important to a huge array of industries and categories. And so how we treat that infrastructure, it needs to be independent of just saying this is a financial regulatory matter, because it's actually not. It's really about a next layer of the Internet and getting that right. And so I find sometimes that the policies that are being considered are kind of they're stovepiping everything or they're kind of marshaling everything into a financial regulatory lens that is not a good position. I don't think it's accurate.
01:15:37.042 - 01:15:42.006, Speaker A: And so I think it really just requires more and more understanding.
01:15:42.198 - 01:15:45.866, Speaker D: And so I would encourage policymakers and.
01:15:45.888 - 01:16:10.260, Speaker A: Their staff to really get a better understanding of let's just call it the computer science of this network technology and what that is, because that's really where so much value will come. And it's not just because someone's got an airdropped token or whatever the thing that people find problematic is.
01:16:11.590 - 01:16:17.800, Speaker C: All right, well, Jeremy, this has been such a pleasure where can people learn more about you and your work?
