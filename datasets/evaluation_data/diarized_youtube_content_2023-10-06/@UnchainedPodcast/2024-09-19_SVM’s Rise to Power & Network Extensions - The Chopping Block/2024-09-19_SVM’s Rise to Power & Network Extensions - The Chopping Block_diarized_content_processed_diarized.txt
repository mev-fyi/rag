00:00:00.680 - 00:00:29.817, Speaker A: We invented a lot of these ideas of co processors and roll ups and validiums and blah blah, blah. And the whole, we created this whole taxonomy. We analyzed the hell out of it for like five years because we staked our lives and our futures on this vision of the world coming true. And it sort of feels like, look, I understand that the EVM world and the SVM world have at times been adversarial, but it's like at least show enough respect to just call them roll ups if they're roll ups.
00:00:30.001 - 00:00:51.057, Speaker B: This reminds me of people in the late 90s, early 2000s who were like, Windows versus Mac were like, you know, a memory allocator in Windows would have a certain type of name and a memory allocator and a Mac would have a different type of name. And they were realistically the same thing, but because they called them different things, the two types of developers would like, fight.
00:00:51.121 - 00:00:51.937, Speaker C: Not a dividend.
00:00:52.041 - 00:00:53.201, Speaker B: It's a tale of two quant.
00:00:53.273 - 00:00:55.889, Speaker A: Now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet.
00:00:55.977 - 00:00:58.425, Speaker D: Generally speaking, airdrops are kind of pointless anyways.
00:00:58.585 - 00:01:01.297, Speaker A: I named trading firms who were very involved.
00:01:01.401 - 00:01:04.005, Speaker B: Alec Eth is the ultimate Ponzi Defi.
00:01:04.045 - 00:01:17.613, Speaker A: Protocols are the antidote to this problem. Hello everybody. Welcome to Chopping Block. Every couple of weeks the four of us get together and give the industry insider's perspective on the crypto topics of the day. So quick intros. First you got Tom the Defi maven and master of memes.
00:01:17.669 - 00:01:18.545, Speaker D: Hello everyone.
00:01:19.285 - 00:01:31.861, Speaker A: Next we've got Tarun. He's not here yet. He will be joining us later. But we're here in Singapore and everyone's kind of running around a little bit crazy. But he will be here shortly. He is the Gearbrain and grandpoo bot Comet. Today we've got special guest, the main man at Helios.
00:01:31.861 - 00:01:35.301, Speaker A: We have Mert. Mert Mumtaz I believe is your full name.
00:01:35.333 - 00:01:36.173, Speaker C: Yeah, close enough.
00:01:36.269 - 00:01:52.525, Speaker A: The alliteration is wonderful. And I'm a Steve Whoops, the head hype man at Dragonfly. We are early stage investors in crypto. But I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice, legal advice, or even life advice. Please see chopping block that XYZ for more disclosures. So we're here. Token 2049.
00:01:52.525 - 00:01:55.797, Speaker A: Mert, is this your first token 2049 or have you been before?
00:01:55.941 - 00:02:00.121, Speaker C: No, actually my first one was the biblical flood in Dubai. The.
00:02:00.193 - 00:02:02.129, Speaker A: Okay, but this is your first one in Singapore.
00:02:02.257 - 00:02:04.057, Speaker C: It's. It's actually my first time in Asia.
00:02:04.121 - 00:02:06.809, Speaker A: And Singapore first time in Asia. Period.
00:02:06.937 - 00:02:17.169, Speaker C: Yeah. So I mean, I was at Korea blockchain week and I came a little earlier just to make sure I adjust for jet lag by the time this one came around. But yeah, first time in Asia.
00:02:17.257 - 00:02:18.765, Speaker A: Wow. What do you have against Asia?
00:02:19.585 - 00:02:26.097, Speaker C: Just, I don't like spying too much, but now that I've been here, I did get food poisoning, so I have that again.
00:02:26.161 - 00:02:27.801, Speaker A: So now you're even more against Asia.
00:02:27.913 - 00:02:28.329, Speaker C: Actually.
00:02:28.417 - 00:02:31.629, Speaker A: Were you like in a meat, like in one of those open air meat markets? Like.
00:02:31.777 - 00:02:53.197, Speaker C: No, I just, I don't even know what I did. I just. Because I have like a swallowing problem. So I just really drink stuff and soup and alcohol. But apparently because you can't drink this hot water in Malaysia and people are basically like naval. He's like, yeah, like you just basically can't do anything or eat anything or that's been in contact with water. It's like, huh.
00:02:53.341 - 00:02:55.437, Speaker A: So you have food poisoning in Malaysia?
00:02:55.621 - 00:02:59.517, Speaker C: I'm speculating, but probably. Okay, that would line up.
00:02:59.621 - 00:03:01.093, Speaker A: That sounds like checks out.
00:03:01.149 - 00:03:01.573, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:03:01.669 - 00:03:02.945, Speaker A: What are you doing in Malaysia?
00:03:03.795 - 00:03:24.003, Speaker C: So Solana has this thing called Super Team, which is like a bunch of decentralized communities around, let's say the globe. And we did a Super Team Solana dinner in KL because you know, between Korea and Singapore there was this gap and everybody went to like Bali or Thailand. But I was like, I've never been to kl, so that seems interesting.
00:03:24.179 - 00:03:26.195, Speaker A: Okay. And do you regret it?
00:03:26.315 - 00:03:27.451, Speaker C: I actually like it.
00:03:27.483 - 00:03:30.091, Speaker A: Never coming back to Asia after this. Okay, got it.
00:03:30.283 - 00:03:42.853, Speaker C: I actually liked KL quite a bit. It's like very interesting mix of like Islamic art plus like Chinese arts and then like some griminess, but then like some modern buildings.
00:03:42.949 - 00:03:44.141, Speaker A: Yeah, it's pretty cool.
00:03:44.173 - 00:03:44.677, Speaker C: I like it.
00:03:44.741 - 00:03:54.397, Speaker A: It is cool. Okay. But never going back. It's all right. We don't have a Malaysian audience. They're not going to hear about this. Okay, well that's so first impressions of Singapore, I guess.
00:03:54.397 - 00:03:57.421, Speaker A: You first time here. What do you think so far?
00:03:57.613 - 00:04:15.157, Speaker C: Oh, I think it's super well designed. I've been, I've been a pretty big fanboy of Lee Kuan Yew, so I make quite a few memes about him. Oh, I think it's very well designed. I think like the one thing was the like no Zins or like no nicotine pouches into the country. And I was like, are you a consumer? Shit, yeah.
00:04:15.181 - 00:04:16.245, Speaker B: That's a deal breaker.
00:04:16.405 - 00:04:20.941, Speaker C: Yeah. I was like, you cannot do this during Solana's main event.
00:04:21.093 - 00:04:21.861, Speaker A: That is true.
00:04:21.933 - 00:04:30.665, Speaker C: Right. And. But it Turns out, and I'm not going to disclose them. People brought them in anyways. I was like, super scared. I was like, I'm gonna. Cause I think the propaganda is a little strong.
00:04:30.665 - 00:04:38.713, Speaker C: They're like, oh, you'll get caned or go to jail or like get fined like a billion dollars. And like, nobody checks anything. And so.
00:04:38.849 - 00:04:40.353, Speaker A: Not that you would rat them out on a show.
00:04:40.409 - 00:04:51.401, Speaker C: Yeah, I would not rat them out, but I've had a few meetings requests, and it'll be like, hi, Mert. One, I have ZINs two, can we meet to discuss something?
00:04:51.473 - 00:04:51.705, Speaker A: Wow.
00:04:51.745 - 00:04:52.625, Speaker C: So it's smart. BD.
00:04:52.665 - 00:04:56.525, Speaker A: So you really open yourself up to bribery, really, now that you're broadcasting all this?
00:04:56.665 - 00:04:57.013, Speaker C: Yes.
00:04:57.069 - 00:05:01.909, Speaker A: Okay, got it. All right, well, let's. Let's hope that Singaporean officials are not watching the chocolate.
00:05:01.957 - 00:05:18.021, Speaker D: I feel like that's how you know when you have good rule of law is like, people are so scared of even like the concept of breaking, you know, a minor law that they're like, I'm not. I'm not even going to try it. The gum, you know, it's not. It's not worth the time. Like, I feel like in the US it's like the opposite. People like, yeah, you know, fuck it, I'm going to jaywalk. You know, no one's going to tick at me.
00:05:18.021 - 00:05:18.625, Speaker D: And.
00:05:19.925 - 00:05:28.947, Speaker C: Well, I found an arbitrage, which is that. So nicotine pouch is illegal, gum is illegal, but nicotine gum is legal. So just went to the farm.
00:05:29.011 - 00:05:29.739, Speaker B: How does that work?
00:05:29.787 - 00:05:31.987, Speaker D: Yeah, what shouldn't it be extra illegal?
00:05:32.051 - 00:05:38.139, Speaker C: I feel like that's what I would have figured. But you must have some alternative to cigarettes.
00:05:38.187 - 00:05:50.947, Speaker A: To be clear, I don't believe gum is literally illegal. It's illegal to import gum, but having gum, Chewing gum is actually fine. The thing about gum being illegal was in the 90s or something in the early days of Singapore, but it's not literally true anymore.
00:05:51.011 - 00:06:07.013, Speaker D: I've even heard a lot of the stuff. It's lax. I mean, people, if you come in with like a vape from Malaysia, you're not going to get caned. It's. It's like no one is. They're looking for people who are like mass importing and selling these things, which is what is illegal. Not in a single individual bringing in a pack of gum.
00:06:07.069 - 00:06:09.845, Speaker A: But to be clear, if you bring any kind of hard drugs into Singapore.
00:06:09.925 - 00:06:10.613, Speaker D: Yeah, the hard drugs.
00:06:10.669 - 00:06:22.821, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Or even soft drugs. Any. Any kind of hardness of drug in Singapore is very, very. No, no, it's one of the. One of the most restrictive laws in the world of, like, fairly developed rich countries.
00:06:22.973 - 00:06:30.093, Speaker C: Yeah, And I think that's fair. It's just the nicotine stuff. It's like you already have nicotine gum, you have cigarettes. So can I just take, like.
00:06:30.269 - 00:06:43.145, Speaker A: I mean, look, we're addicted. It's not fair. How can you. Okay. It's tough. So this week, of course, is also Solana Breakpoint, which is the big flagship conference. I think it's happening Friday, Saturday, I believe.
00:06:43.145 - 00:06:48.345, Speaker A: What should people be looking out for with respect to Breakpoint this year? Obviously yourself.
00:06:48.645 - 00:07:09.305, Speaker C: Yeah. I think the biggest differences are there's no panels. So it's just going to be debates and five minute rapid fire kind of product keynotes and then a very few. Keynote or not keynote. Fireside chats. So me and Toly will be doing one to close out the first day and then Balaji and Raj are doing one to open it up.
00:07:10.805 - 00:07:12.225, Speaker A: How is that? No panels?
00:07:13.005 - 00:07:22.449, Speaker C: Yeah, I also was wondering this, but I think it's because, like, it's just two people having a chat as opposed to like, you know, five, six people.
00:07:22.497 - 00:07:23.057, Speaker A: Sure, sure.
00:07:23.121 - 00:07:25.105, Speaker D: They say two's a chat, three's a panel.
00:07:25.225 - 00:07:28.553, Speaker A: Okay, that's good.
00:07:28.569 - 00:07:53.635, Speaker C: And then. And then the other important thing. Yeah, the really important thing will be the Fire Dancer team. They're doing a few talks. Nobody has more than one speaking slot this year, except for Fire Dancer, who I believe have three. So Kevin Bowers, obviously the gigabrain behind Fire Dancer, will be doing a talk and I would recommend everybody check that out because, yeah, they're going to be. They've been doing some work.
00:07:53.795 - 00:08:12.267, Speaker A: Nice. Very interesting. So before we jump into Fire Dancer, because I do want to talk about Fire Dancer, I want to start with yourself. So I think everybody knows Mert largely as a sort of online attack dog. I think that's probably your first and foremost reputation. But you're also a founder. You run an infrastructure company on Solana.
00:08:12.267 - 00:08:22.365, Speaker A: Tell us about the company that you run and also how you came into the role as being the Solana attack dog. And also the second most famous bald man in crypto.
00:08:23.505 - 00:08:24.249, Speaker C: Are you the first?
00:08:24.297 - 00:08:25.365, Speaker A: No, no, I'm third.
00:08:27.305 - 00:08:36.489, Speaker C: Well, so I used to work at Coinbase. I was a tech lead for the platform or a part of the platform team called Ledger, which worked for the.
00:08:36.497 - 00:08:37.585, Speaker A: Most famous bald man in crypto.
00:08:37.625 - 00:08:41.169, Speaker C: Yes, yes. That's why I lost my hair. I actually had hair when I was in Coinbase.
00:08:41.257 - 00:08:41.673, Speaker A: Right.
00:08:41.769 - 00:08:48.563, Speaker C: There's an emoji, actually, because we work with Coinbase now and It's a. It's a murder emoji from Coinbase. And it's me with hair because I actually had it.
00:08:48.619 - 00:08:49.455, Speaker A: Oh, damn.
00:08:50.475 - 00:09:25.405, Speaker C: And so I was working there around 2021 and I was. We were supporting all the chains. So I used to do research into, like, even Polka Dot Avalanche, Solana, and, like, my background is in math, but also communications engineering. So, like signal satellites, stuff like that. And while looking at all the L1s and the different kind of white papers, Solana was actually structured or engineered more like a communication system more than others. And I thought that was, like, quite interesting. And there was a lot that you could actually apply.
00:09:25.405 - 00:09:50.481, Speaker C: And so I just started building stuff on my own. This is before, like, Solana had any Explorers or, like, zero analytics tools. And people would just say, like, bizarre shit on Twitter. Like, NFT influencers would say something like, oh, you know, the supply is running up quickly and stuff, but nobody would actually be able to check their claims. So I would write like, some scripts and be like, oh, actually you just minted all of it to yourself and then now you're trying to scam your users.
00:09:50.633 - 00:09:53.017, Speaker A: So this is like 2020, 2020.
00:09:53.081 - 00:10:12.597, Speaker C: Like right around Degenerate Apes Mint. Like when Solana really went from like 8 to like 46 and then just kept going up, it was around that time. And so I was always like, let's say I always had an attack dog mentality. I would just do it internally or, like, on more niche topics.
00:10:12.701 - 00:10:13.425, Speaker A: Okay.
00:10:14.645 - 00:10:59.081, Speaker C: And then while doing that, I basically was like, you know, there's a lot of problems building on Solana because I was building on it myself and I wanted to build these things for myself first. And then, you know, at the time, I was also super annoyed with the lack of real applications in crypto, which I'm still quite annoyed by. And I basically said to myself, like, okay, there's two paths here. I can go ahead and build on Ethereum today. And what I would need for success in that case would be the merge has to happen because it hadn't happened yet. 4844 needs to go live successfully. L2s need to get to stage two, and like, all these kind of conditionals need to happen.
00:10:59.081 - 00:11:44.453, Speaker C: And each time there's a conditional, you know, the probability of success, when you multiply them together, it decreases over time. Versus on Solana, it was like, okay, the chain mostly works. It's certainly not perfect, but if somebody can go and fix some of these very fixable problems, then I think we can get app developers to build Here right away. And so that was the thesis. And yes, just started building left Coinbase started Helios, recruited my university roommates, Liam and Nick to be my co founders. And at first we released something called human readable APIs on Solana because Solana is famously unreadable. And it was always like that.
00:11:44.453 - 00:12:25.423, Speaker C: And as we kept doing that, we noticed a lot of other problems in the stack. Like the RPCs kind of sucked, the indexing is too expensive, transactions don't land. Like archival sucks, all these things like scaling ZK compression. And we were actually like a relatively successful business at first. Like we made money, we were getting customers and growing relatively good or well over time. And then FTX happened and around that time I would already see people on the Internet, like Justin Bonds or something back when he hated Solana. Say like random, like false things.
00:12:25.423 - 00:12:51.215, Speaker C: Like Solana has a fraudulent design pattern because like you know who the block leader will be, therefore you can spam them and then stop the network. But then it's like most chains actually have a predictable block schedule. Right. Including Ethereum to actually, it was called Ethereum 2 at that point. Yeah. And like I would call these things out and then people would just like. But I would call them out because I'm just generally an angry person.
00:12:51.215 - 00:12:53.635, Speaker C: I would call them out pretty aggressive.
00:12:53.795 - 00:12:56.035, Speaker A: Where does that come from? Where does that come from? You think?
00:12:56.195 - 00:12:59.059, Speaker C: You know, I think it's genetics in a sense.
00:12:59.147 - 00:13:10.955, Speaker A: Okay, like turf. Because when I met you, you do not seem like an angry person. But I would say like the online Persona is super aggro. Where, like, how do you reconcile that in your mind?
00:13:11.035 - 00:13:35.435, Speaker C: Yeah. So it's. Here's how I think about it in person. People generally don't say ridiculous things, but on the Internet they say anything. And especially on crypto Twitter, some guy who trades some charts did like a poetry major will talk about poetry. Very specific Solana infrastructure stuff. And I'm like, what are you talking about? That's completely false.
00:13:35.435 - 00:13:41.343, Speaker C: It happens in person too. Most people don't catch me in person because it's not a very scalable media.
00:13:41.439 - 00:13:42.103, Speaker A: Sure.
00:13:42.279 - 00:14:23.187, Speaker C: But some guy was at Korea, blockchain, he was. What do you think about Solana being like an only meme coin chain? And I was like, like I was ready to like. So anyway, that's, that's. I had already been doing that for quite a bit and then FDX happened and I was actually happy that FTX happened in some sense because one of my main things with the chain was everybody hated because of FTX and spf, like, oh, that guy's like weird and stuff. Yeah, predatory. And my actual first thought, which was, I guess naive looking back, was great, now that the biggest predator is gone, so now there's no excuse to get.
00:14:23.291 - 00:14:26.115, Speaker A: Nothing in the way. Yeah, nobody will ever say a bad thing about Solana again.
00:14:26.155 - 00:14:50.795, Speaker C: Yeah. So. And then to my surprise, of course, everybody started shooting on it way more and then. But the thing that really got me was they started making comments on the chain itself, like the technical architecture and the scalability. And then they somehow like threaded like SBF in there and stuff. And I was like, that is not an argument. Like you're conflating a bunch of different things and this would happen every day.
00:14:50.795 - 00:15:40.629, Speaker C: And, you know, I had some knowledge about Solana and EVM chains and all these other things from my time at Coinbase, and I basically just said what I thought was correct. Sometimes it wasn't correct and I would learn from that. But most of the times when people talk about Solana, one thing that I've noticed is a lot of Salon people know much more about the EVM because EVM has been around for longer, has better documentation, frankly, and bigger ecosystem. But the counter is not true. Like a lot of people coming from EVM don't quite understand Salon ecosystem that well. And so being like one of the few people, and I'm not the only one that actually had a relatively well understanding of both and then combine that with being bald and angry, I think that's kind of what led to it.
00:15:40.717 - 00:16:09.217, Speaker A: Got it. One of the things that we've been discussing quite a bit and we've also talked about on the show in the past is the differential between the funding that has gone to the EVM ecosystem versus the SVM ecosystem. And it does feel like this year has very much been the year of svm. You know, we've seen the rise of, you know, ellipsis, Eclipse isn't there. I believe there's one more that's also SVM based. Of course there's. What's the.
00:16:09.217 - 00:16:27.469, Speaker A: What's the virtualized EVM on top of Solana? Neon. Neon. There's neon. So it just feel like the Solana ecosystem is growing and the, and the quantum of capital available in Solana ecosystem is growing. But it hasn't always been that way. Right. I think last year was probably kind of the valley of darkness for a lot of Solana developers.
00:16:27.469 - 00:16:54.105, Speaker A: Um, and then before that there was this almost FTX monoculture where s, you know, basically FTX and multicoin and then Horizon or Horizon it's called now Sino. Yeah, formally formally known as Sino. We're sort of funding all the projects in Solana. So from your perspective, and I know this, something that you've commented on in the past, how do you think about the availability of capital for Solana and SVM based founders relative to what it was like in the past?
00:16:55.015 - 00:17:08.255, Speaker C: So relatively relative to what it was in the past, I think it's better. Like when we first raised the seed round for Helios it was very difficult. This was when this was 2022. June.
00:17:08.415 - 00:17:11.755, Speaker A: June. So this is like post FT, post three eras collapsing.
00:17:12.295 - 00:17:16.447, Speaker C: I don't quite remember the framing of everything, but it was.
00:17:16.551 - 00:17:19.075, Speaker A: But Tara had already collapsed. Market was already coming down.
00:17:19.465 - 00:17:20.713, Speaker C: I think so yeah.
00:17:20.729 - 00:17:21.809, Speaker A: Because Terra collapsed in March.
00:17:21.897 - 00:18:00.675, Speaker C: March I think that that had happened. It was very hard for, for me to raise for Helios and everybody said no basically. And a lot of the things were like well the developers are on the EVM so like why would you make. And because we were also exclusively vertically on the Solana, we didn't, you know, play this game where we just go to different chains and then keep, you know, making marginal improvements but then the product suffers because you're focus is split. So everybody was super skeptical. Everybody passed except for like Reciprocal who co led the round with Chapter one. So it was pretty bad back then.
00:18:00.675 - 00:18:42.947, Speaker C: And then obviously after X happened that made even worse. A lot of my friends who were pretty smart people just could not raise. I had to like because I have a pretty good network let's say with within VCs and especially Solana and like people just couldn't raise, people were blowing up, etc. So it was pretty bad. Now it's certainly much better especially on the earlier stage stuff because I'm an angel now as well. So there's a lot of the amount of deal flow has increased quite a bit and it's also much more prod or consumer focused or like deep in focus or something like that. Not too many infra plays on Solana.
00:18:42.947 - 00:19:14.895, Speaker C: There are certainly some like the SVM stuff but for Salana, the L1 itself there's not too much infra and like you know, I think consumer startups in general are harder to fund because a lot less certainty around, you know, how this grows, the go to market and all this. Yeah, so I think that also plays a role. Like I don't think it's purely a Solana thing. I think it's also the class of applications being built on Solana. But yeah, it was, it was bad. Now it's. It's better, I would say though.
00:19:14.895 - 00:19:32.355, Speaker C: So we just did our third round. I don't think any team on Salon has actually done a third round. I think the only exceptions are Matchy and Phantom, but they're multi chain. But like a Solana specific team. I'm not sure. Maybe Jito might be another one.
00:19:32.515 - 00:19:48.217, Speaker A: Jito? I think they did two rounds and then they launched their token and then they might be doing another one. But I think a lot of the reason for that is that they just launch tokens and then of course, Jupiter never raised venture capital, I believe. Correct. So I think. Did Radium raise multiple rounds?
00:19:48.401 - 00:19:49.217, Speaker C: I don't even know.
00:19:49.321 - 00:19:50.445, Speaker D: It's Phoenix.
00:19:51.825 - 00:19:53.609, Speaker C: Yeah. So they did a Series A.
00:19:53.657 - 00:19:54.393, Speaker A: That's true. That's true.
00:19:54.409 - 00:19:54.609, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:19:54.657 - 00:20:09.875, Speaker D: But to your point, it's more. This is the way kind of capital markets are forming in crypto is like you do a seed, you do an A. If you have a token, you launch a token and then maybe do like a Treasury sale or something, versus many rounds of capital going into a team that's launching like a defi protocol or something.
00:20:09.955 - 00:20:59.149, Speaker A: Yeah, I think part of maybe what explains that as well, as you mentioned, there's not that much infrastructure being funded on Solana. In large part there's because Solana is the infrastructure. Right. Whereas with Ethereum you sort of need all these, you know, wings and kind of extra things built down the side to support what people actually want to do on chain. With Solana, the whole idea of Solana is that, okay, it's kind of a monolithic chain, you don't really need that many augmentations to it, although we'll talk about the concept of those augmentations. And as a result, I think it more tends to be infrastructure projects that one, are more capital intensive, they require a lot more funding and two, they tend to take longer to launch a token. Whereas a lot of the consumer apps or things like a Dex or something, you need 5 to 10 million to get it off the ground, launch it, and then generally it's token and then you sell tokens otc if you ever need it.
00:20:59.297 - 00:21:15.105, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, I think that's. That's correct. Yeah. But like the thing that's changed is during the first, let's say, or the past two years, it was. People just thought Solana was going to die. So I think VCs thought it'd be a very risky bet. Some were comfortable taking it, some weren't.
00:21:15.105 - 00:21:24.333, Speaker C: But I think now that's changed. Like, it's. It's quite clear that Solana is going to be very hard to kill at this point. Yeah. And so it's de. Risked it for a lot of people. Now.
00:21:24.333 - 00:21:40.065, Speaker C: There are still risks, I would say, for sure. But it's like if you're. Now there's like a hackathon, the radar hackathon. There's a few incubators on Solana. Some of the alliance teams are actually choosing Solana for some of the first times ever I've seen.
00:21:40.805 - 00:21:45.901, Speaker A: So some of the alliance teams. You mean alliance. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. The incubator.
00:21:46.013 - 00:21:54.815, Speaker C: Yeah. So it's certainly changed. It's still not like, perfect, but, like, I think you've probably heard of Ebola.
00:21:54.935 - 00:22:00.115, Speaker A: I have. We're very familiar with the concept. So do you define what Ebola means?
00:22:00.695 - 00:22:04.955, Speaker C: I think it stands for EVM logic.
00:22:05.895 - 00:22:09.647, Speaker A: EVM Bags over Logic Affliction.
00:22:09.751 - 00:22:10.511, Speaker C: Yes, yes, yes.
00:22:10.543 - 00:22:11.639, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:22:11.767 - 00:22:26.553, Speaker C: So I think that used to be pretty prevalent. I don't think it's that prevalent anymore. I could be wrong on this. Just based on my experience, funding teams myself, but also raising myself. Like, we had no shortage of interests, so.
00:22:26.609 - 00:22:32.609, Speaker A: Well, it's funny you mentioned that. So somebody from the Solana Foundation. Akshay. What's his name?
00:22:32.697 - 00:22:33.257, Speaker C: Yep, Akshay.
00:22:33.281 - 00:22:50.365, Speaker A: Akshay. Akshay. So Akshay from the. No, maybe it's not Akshay. No, sorry. It was somebody else from the Solana foundation sub tweeted this show. And basically, I think that's where they went public with the Ebola acronym, which I think was something that people in the Solana ecosystem knew, but it wasn't something that was aired publicly.
00:22:50.365 - 00:22:57.869, Speaker A: And they actually specifically call out Tom as being an example of somebody with Ebola. And so. Okay, what does Ebola mean?
00:22:57.917 - 00:23:01.733, Speaker D: I totally missed this. I feel like their efforts were wasted potentially a little.
00:23:01.829 - 00:23:37.925, Speaker A: So, anyway, so Ebola basically means that you are kind of. You have two heavy EVM bags and you are biased against Solana. And I think it was the show where we were talking about the delta of capital available in the Solana ecosystem versus the EVM ecosystem and whether it makes sense for an entrepreneur who's building a consumer app or whatever to like, build on base. Build on Arbitron, build on Solana, whatever. And so I think the Solana foundation at least feels like there's a lot of VCs who still have a very strong bias against Solana. And apparently they think we're in that club. Curious.
00:23:37.925 - 00:23:40.905, Speaker A: What? So you said that you think that that's less of a thing these days.
00:23:41.365 - 00:24:09.553, Speaker C: Yeah. I mean, I think that's probably not consensus view, but I do think it's like kind of overblown at this point. I think like infrastructure is just easier to fund and it makes like there's a lot of. Because, like, you know, I would say most VC investing, not all is relatively social in some sense. Like, oh, there's somebody leading that round. Hey, we've seen this before now, what happens if it's on this chain, etc. So it's easier to underwrite in a sense.
00:24:09.649 - 00:24:10.089, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:24:10.177 - 00:24:34.167, Speaker C: Whereas salon apps tend to be a bit crazier. Like Pump Fund, for example. It's like, what even is this? Like, I didn't, I didn't even know what it was. I wouldn't have funded it myself. So there's also that. But like if you, if you build a product and have customers and have some traction, like a VC at this point is not going to say no because you're building on an L1 I don't like in my view.
00:24:34.231 - 00:25:00.001, Speaker A: Yeah, well, so there is a little bit of history on this show in particular about Solana. Right. So we've had Anatolia on the show, we've had Lucas from GTO on the show and in the past. So if you go back probably like 2021, I think is when, you know, it was. We had the most critical episodes, I think of Solana back then, where that was when, you know, Solana fee markets were falling over. There was a lot of downtime. There was a lot of criticism back then.
00:25:00.001 - 00:25:36.591, Speaker A: And this was very much the FTX era of, you know, the block explorers were just, you know, really just unworkable, that you couldn't see contract code. There were no deterministic builds. There was a lot of stuff that we criticized Solana for very publicly. And I think a lot of that landed as seemingly with some of the foundation who now are, you know, not very happy that we have said a lot of things that are negative about Solana, but almost everything that. And then, you know, traditionally Tarun would be the pro Solana guy and I think he was, you know, they invested much earlier into, you know, they did the seed round of gto, they did a lot of early investments in. There was. There were some other decks on Adrift.
00:25:36.591 - 00:25:58.205, Speaker A: They did drift very early. And I, you know, my, my take is that almost all the criticisms that I levied against Solana in 2021, Solana addressed. Right. Pretty much everything that I just mentioned is fixed now. And, you know, Solana Has a real fee market. It's not all the way there, but it's, like, definitely way better than what it was in 2021. They're deterministic builds now.
00:25:58.205 - 00:26:33.431, Speaker A: You can actually see verified contracts on block explorers and, like, actually see the corresponding code. There's a lot more of the dominant applications on Solana are open source. In the past, it was, like, mostly closed source. There's just a lot of things that Solana has actually really improved to get to parity with what people generally expect from public blockchains. But I think the. And as a result, we've also spent a lot more time in this LAN ecosystem over the last two years, and we've made a lot more investments in that ecosystem now as an investor, you know, we invest a ton into non EVM ecosystems. We're big investors in, you know, near Aptos.
00:26:33.431 - 00:26:35.799, Speaker A: You know, we've done some. Oh, it's through here.
00:26:35.847 - 00:26:36.007, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:26:36.031 - 00:26:36.823, Speaker D: I was like, what do you.
00:26:36.919 - 00:26:38.639, Speaker A: Okay, wait, why is looking at. I don't know.
00:26:38.647 - 00:26:39.995, Speaker D: He's like, looking through the people.
00:26:40.415 - 00:26:42.119, Speaker A: Tarun, what are you doing, man? Come on.
00:26:42.247 - 00:26:44.399, Speaker B: They told me to wait until you gave me a signal.
00:26:44.447 - 00:27:06.889, Speaker A: Oh, no. Yeah, come. Come sit down. Come sit down. You came in at a perfect time. We were just talking about the history of being critical of Solana on the show, and we were talking about the concept of Ebola. You saw that tweet? Yeah, the Ebola tweet from the Solana foundation that was calling out the chopping block for being full of anti or bags.
00:27:07.017 - 00:27:12.153, Speaker B: Well, the first time I heard Ebola was from Lily. Yeah, I believe it was her.
00:27:12.249 - 00:27:52.775, Speaker A: Yeah, well, she was the one who coined the term, and I think maybe it was Jack from the Solana Foundation. It doesn't matter. But anyway, so, yeah, my claim is that Salon has actually really transformed a lot of the things that we criticize it for in 2020, or I criticize it for in 2021 and 2022, to the point where now, I think for you to not consider it a VC investment because they're building on Salon is just kind of insane. Right? It's very clearly, you know, the ecosystem of consumer, of Depin, obviously, of Meme Coins is, you know, a huge part of the activity, but just the raw amount of retail activity happening on Solana, it is very, very clearly the winner of 2024.
00:27:52.935 - 00:28:00.343, Speaker B: But by the way, are you. Are you being nice all of a sudden? Because you put the two bald guys on one side and it's like. It's like, no, he's not because you're.
00:28:00.359 - 00:28:09.863, Speaker A: Gonna take so long to be here. I didn't want to have him sitting alone on one side. I thought it would be kind of sad. So. No, that, that's not, that's not the idea. But anyway, wanted. Wanted to get your.
00:28:09.863 - 00:28:11.195, Speaker A: Your reaction to that.
00:28:11.655 - 00:28:34.065, Speaker C: Yeah, I think, yeah, it's. It's one of my favorite parts about Solana, which is like the culture, let's say, set at the top by Tolle is this engineering culture. And engineers criticize each other and the tech relentlessly and in public. Like, me and Tolle will debate in public. Him and Trent will debate in public. That's kind of just how we. It's like, what.
00:28:34.065 - 00:29:28.181, Speaker C: It's just how any engineering system works generally, especially open source stuff. Like, it's all debates. And that's kind of the reason why, like, during the FTX stuff, people were saying all these things like, oh, you know, it's an unscalable chain, it's doomed, whatever. And then we'd be like, well, actually we just added fee markets and stuff, so that's actually not a thing anymore. And so that's. I actually tweeted, I believe, two days ago, what I believe to be the most important part of any new ecosystem is kind of this culture of open critique and like actually trying to pursue some truth as opposed to trying to manufacture narratives that probably will die out in X months once the price starts doing different things. So I think fundamentally blockchains are distributed systems and the metal needs to work.
00:29:28.181 - 00:29:41.359, Speaker C: And the only way you're going to discover problems is first you have to be open to receiving critique, but then also being able to ship in a very timely manner to fix those things. That's my favorite part about Solana is just that culture.
00:29:41.447 - 00:29:42.071, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:29:42.223 - 00:29:56.583, Speaker C: Because there's. I mean, believe me, there's a lot of material there to hate on which I call them out. You know, people, you know, I'm an attack for Solana for sure. But I also, I would say I call out Solana more than basically anybody alive on how many things.
00:29:56.639 - 00:30:43.855, Speaker A: Yeah, this is absolutely true, and I give you a lot of respect for this, is that, you know, at a time when I remember this was like 2022, when everybody on Twitter was getting mad about Solana, labeling vote transactions as being part of tps, and it's like, oh, we have tens of Thousands or whatever, 50,000 TPS. You are one of the most fervent people within the Solana ecosystem being like, yeah, we should get this right, because we still have great performance. Right? There's nothing to be ashamed of what Solana's kind of on chain transaction load actually is. But now I think Solana has again moved past almost like a sort of youthful insecurity about just being saying, look, here's how the chain works. And it works, it works really well as long as you're willing to entertain those trade offs. But your intellectual honesty about it is something that I've always respected.
00:30:44.015 - 00:30:47.675, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. I mean it's not even. I just get annoyed.
00:30:48.735 - 00:30:50.999, Speaker A: Anger is the primary motivator across the board.
00:30:51.087 - 00:31:28.675, Speaker C: Some of these new data sites will say like, oh, Solana just hit a all time high in blockchain history for daily active addresses. And I was like, please shut the hell up like that. There's a completely useless thing. I was almost actually going to build a little cursor AI video like, okay, I'm just going to actually create all these addresses myself and inflate the metrics real time to show you how stupid this is. And so it still happens in all ecosystems. But I understand Solana the most myself. And so I think there's some moral obligation to criticize internally so that like you said, you do learn from it and improve and then get better over time.
00:31:29.215 - 00:32:27.299, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, that's one of the things that has been the most obvious looking from the outside is how quickly Solana has improved as an ecosystem over the last couple of years. And in a way, I think the separation from FTX was clearly very painful for people in the Solana ecosystem because it was such a massive distribution engine for Solana, for getting retail in the front door, for just supporting a lot of the ecosystem and funding a lot of the stuff that was happening in Solana. But it was also very much held back by the fact that, you know, there was this sort of overlord kind of, you know, hanging over the chain and once you become freedom that it's like, okay, well let's just start changing stuff and like making it, making it better and not worrying so much about appearances. I feel like there's, there's, there's something there and you know, something that you've mentioned many times on the show is that going through that really difficult period makes a culture and a community much more tightly bound together. Right. Where you see that there aren't a lot of ecosystems that really have community. Right.
00:32:27.299 - 00:32:38.815, Speaker A: They have hype, they have excitement, they have a brand, they even have people who've made money. But Solana really does have community. And community, it's one of those things very difficult to break once it's there.
00:32:39.915 - 00:33:29.335, Speaker C: Yeah. I mean, it's one of the things I noticed actually during the NNFT craze in 2021 where it was like, oh, we have the strongest community and stuff. And it's like a community isn't a set of people centered around making the price go higher to sell to another person. You can only gauge the strength when things are going the worst possible way they can go. And I mean FTX happened, but before then there was the outages and stuff and people still stuck around and so it was always like these kind of mini trials and battles which like, I think all major ecosystems need to have that to actually form a community. A lot of people now come up to me from other ecosystems like, you know, how'd you guys do at Solana? And it's like, well like manufacture a few black swans and then see people stick around. There's also some technical things saying there's a psyop.
00:33:30.315 - 00:33:32.579, Speaker A: Sam was never really pulling the strings.
00:33:32.707 - 00:33:53.953, Speaker C: That'd be. Yeah. No further comments. Well, and then I think there's some technical aspects to it as well. Like the decision to create a new VM that was not just the EVM makes it such that there's like higher switching costs, but then you also need to be actually interested in this tech to want to build there.
00:33:54.009 - 00:33:54.361, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:33:54.433 - 00:34:12.865, Speaker C: So like if Solana was like an EVM or something and FTX happened, then all these people can just redeploy on another EVM chain versus on Salana. It's like, okay, we already made this decision. We still think it works, the tech still works, but now there's this weird social phenomenon with like FTX and stuff and we can overcome that.
00:34:13.645 - 00:34:36.885, Speaker B: Well, how do you feel about the kind of influx of non Solana SVM platforms in general and whether they're roll ups, whether they're kind of like people trying to build other in general, the SVM moving outside of the main home. What sort of in your mind, kind of, how do you view that?
00:34:37.505 - 00:35:19.505, Speaker C: So I come at it from more of a developer perspective. It was actually on our pitch stack for Helios a round ago where it's like, okay, SVM stuff is going to happen and our infrastructure will be able to deploy on it because it's the same. That's how we kind of configured it. I think fundamentally it's just open source software and as a developer what you want is a thriving ecosystem of people contributing to the same tech stack. But also you don't want platform risk such that if you deployed on Solana but something happens to Solana, maybe they just start making all these weird changes. Maybe Firedance are totally flopped. All these different things.
00:35:19.505 - 00:36:12.659, Speaker C: You're still not all your chips are not in or exit not in one basket and you can redeploy on something in Atlas with ellipsis or another. Maybe you can do an STM app chain like Pithnet did, for example. They have their own SEM app chain. So I think from a, if you like, it's these roll ups and L2s and stuff are going to happen. App chains are going to happen regardless of what anybody wants to believe or what anybody wants to call them. And it's obviously better for Solana that they use SVM for this because they're going to use something anyway. So why not use the tech that's already native to Solana and then this won't happen all the time, but there'll be learnings from those that the Solana, the L1 can enshrine back into the core protocol, which has actually kind of happened in the past and then vice versa.
00:36:12.747 - 00:36:13.855, Speaker A: With respect to what?
00:36:14.795 - 00:36:33.839, Speaker C: So we obviously run infrastructure and we noticed some things with Eclipse's infrastructure, for example, about the fee markets and how the transaction queues and stuff. And we were able to identify those problems and then predict that they would happen during some larger traffic events.
00:36:33.967 - 00:36:35.191, Speaker A: On Mainnet or on Eclipse?
00:36:35.223 - 00:37:51.009, Speaker C: Yeah, on Eclipse, like Testnet. And then we were able to take those and be like, okay, here are some products that will probably be useful going forward, like better transaction fee APIs, transaction landing systems, et cetera. And so I think it is absolutely a net good for Solana because I think everybody kind of thinks about this in a weird way. But it's like if a business requires an integrated L1 to build their application, like let's say it's a defi app, they need like real time price discovery, they want composability within some other ecosystem teams. Then it's like okay, then build on the L1, but if it's like a game that doesn't need global state, maybe it's just some isolated state that just does not need to be on the L1. It's like they should just do whatever is best for their business because if they arbitrarily pick the L1 just because some people yelled at them, that's not going to be sustainable for the L1 anyways because those people will just move around over time. And so I think as a chain your goal is how do we identify the best use cases that actually need our Tech who are sticky users, which is why I came up with Only Possible on Solana.
00:37:51.009 - 00:38:04.849, Speaker C: It's like you should aggressively go after people who can only build things with this architecture that can't be easily copied anywhere else. Otherwise it's just a very short term game and there's no real moat or anything like that.
00:38:04.937 - 00:38:05.257, Speaker A: Sure.
00:38:05.321 - 00:38:24.931, Speaker B: So actually one related question. Do you think there will be in the next two years a exchange centralized exchange that does a base like roll up, but it's an SVM roll up because right now all of the exchange roll ups and app chains have been mainly evm. I mean BNB chain I guess is a weird one.
00:38:25.003 - 00:38:27.643, Speaker A: Historically the BNB chain is evm, but.
00:38:27.659 - 00:38:32.675, Speaker B: The original BNB Dex was Cosmos. I was counting that as like their first.
00:38:32.795 - 00:38:34.067, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, but that was not programmed.
00:38:34.091 - 00:38:35.347, Speaker B: They've had many chains, I guess.
00:38:35.411 - 00:38:36.115, Speaker A: Right, right, right.
00:38:36.195 - 00:38:40.973, Speaker B: But I guess my question to you is like, do you think you will. We will see that in the next two years.
00:38:41.029 - 00:38:44.665, Speaker C: Just a based SVM roll up that settles on.
00:38:44.965 - 00:38:47.477, Speaker B: Not necessarily based, like some centralized exchange.
00:38:47.581 - 00:38:51.837, Speaker A: Exchange sort of endorsed roll up like base that is SVM based.
00:38:51.981 - 00:39:50.755, Speaker C: Oh, I think it'll depend very much on the ecosystem tooling available. So I think one of the reasons why like the VM ones are so prevalent is because there's a lot of tooling like Conduit Caldera, Optimism Stack and all these kind of different things. I don't quite see Solana taking the Solana ecosystem taking the same path there. Like I think there's another one called Sue Network which is trying to do like svm but Optimism Stack or something like that, that could be interesting, but I just don't think the tooling is there. It would require a lot of custom stuff and the exchanges obviously just want security and peace of mind and like easiness and just take my money and then do the thing and then whatnot. So I actually doubt it. Unless like Helios were like, you know, Helios was like, okay, we'll just build this because there's a lot of demand for it or something.
00:39:51.375 - 00:39:57.395, Speaker B: I mean, I certainly asked you because I think if there was demand for it, the first person that someone would ask would be you.
00:39:57.695 - 00:40:10.755, Speaker C: Yeah. So Salon has this concept of SPE special Permissioned environments, which is kind of like this, but they are permissioned. And so we ran a few of those. Like there's some demand for it, but it's.
00:40:11.055 - 00:40:12.919, Speaker A: Is this like a subnet? What is it an spe?
00:40:13.047 - 00:40:18.071, Speaker C: You can probably think of it as a subnet. It's basically an L1, but it's this custom environment.
00:40:18.223 - 00:40:19.007, Speaker A: Got it.
00:40:19.151 - 00:40:20.799, Speaker C: Pithnet is another example.
00:40:20.967 - 00:40:26.745, Speaker A: Does it connect up in some kind of programmatic way to the main chain or is it just like this sort of isolated thing?
00:40:27.885 - 00:40:31.425, Speaker C: It's mostly isolated, but you can configure it however you want.
00:40:32.645 - 00:40:38.029, Speaker B: So you could import accounts from the main chain but not write to them, for instance.
00:40:38.197 - 00:41:00.935, Speaker C: Yeah, you could get creative with stuff like that. Solana's path, it seems to be maybe ephemeral rollups, just roll ups that are just around for some period of time. Do all the execution and then atomically just put it back to the. To the state. Like there's a team called Magic Block that's doing this light protocol and Helios were working on ZK compression.
00:41:01.015 - 00:41:01.575, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:41:01.695 - 00:41:10.275, Speaker C: So I don't think it'll look too skeuomorphic to what already exists today. And also there's just not that many exchanges, I don't think.
00:41:10.655 - 00:41:14.303, Speaker A: I think there's actually a lot, but not very many good ones.
00:41:14.399 - 00:41:34.897, Speaker C: Yeah, I think like Robinhood could be an interesting one that I've heard some, like, I've read some stuff on Twitter. It's like, well, you know, Coinbase and Base evm and then Robinhood is using like Arbitrum. But it's like if they really want a, you know, a different differentiation, maybe they should use an SVM rope or something and then it becomes a BD exercise.
00:41:35.001 - 00:41:35.241, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:41:35.273 - 00:41:41.193, Speaker C: And Solana's approach to BD is quite different, I would say, than like an optimism or like a polygon.
00:41:41.249 - 00:42:05.891, Speaker A: Sure. Okay. So speaking of L2s, I want to talk about this concept of network extensions. So this ended up becoming quite controversial. So just to give a little bit of backstory, I'd say historically a lot of the folks in the Solana ecosystem have been critical of rollups. And rollups are the primary layer 2 construction on Ethereum that's become very popular with things like Arbitrum, optimism and so on. And the claim has always been, well, roll ups.
00:42:05.891 - 00:42:23.515, Speaker A: They're kind of. It's only because Ethereum sucks that it needs roll ups and it can't scale and blah blah, blah. And so then of course there's been the rise of these roll up, like things that are either using SVM or that settle directly to Solana itself. And so Austin, who's I think the chief marketing officer or something.
00:42:23.555 - 00:42:24.523, Speaker C: Something, he's the head of strategy.
00:42:24.579 - 00:42:51.921, Speaker A: Head of strategy, of course, for the Solana foundation, came out and said, I think that maybe instead of thinking about L2s we should call the L2 like things on Solana network extensions. They're not roll ups, they're not L2s, they're network extensions. And this caused a lot of people in the Ethereum ecosystem to get really, really mad because they were like, no, no, no, no. These are called roll ups. We invented them. They're called L2s. You've been shitting on us for making these L2s for a really long time and now all of a sudden you're co opting them and giving them a new name.
00:42:51.921 - 00:43:20.755, Speaker A: So people got really upset about this. I think Anatoly came out and defended the concept of network extensions as being distinct from the ethereum concept of L2s. You came out against the meme, at least of calling them network extensions. I mostly just saw the drama. I don't actually understand why everyone's so mad, but I get the general vibe. What is your take on why you think this network extensions rebrand slash branding exercise is ill advised?
00:43:22.055 - 00:44:01.237, Speaker C: I think both kind of sides have a point to this, but I think the point of terminology or like semantics is to be very precise about what you're defining such that there's no ambiguity, such that when you say the name, you know what to think. Some of these network extension type things, RL2s, but a good amount of them are not L2. So for example, ZK compression on Solana is not an L2. It's much more like a stateless client architecture that Ethereum is going for. Or some of them are sovereign roll ups, some of them are like ephemeral roll ups, some of them aren't even remotely anything to do with a roll UP or an L2, but they just use that term for marketing.
00:44:01.301 - 00:44:01.789, Speaker A: Right.
00:44:01.917 - 00:44:33.937, Speaker C: And so the problem with the terminology in my view is it's too homogenized and it doesn't capture all the differences between these different things. So I get where they're coming from, where it's like, you know, this is not an L2, but you're calling it L2 just because you're used to your own ecosystems. Let's say problems in the terminology. And that's incorrect, but it's also incorrect to, you know, not call L2s that are actually Altoos, not L2s. Right. Like, so it's. These semantic battles always are weird to me.
00:44:33.937 - 00:45:06.315, Speaker C: Like when we launched ZK Compression, this was way before the network extension stuff. Like Adam Cochrane was like, oh, this is clearly a validium and stuff like that. And I was like, what the hell are you Talking about, I built this, it's not. And all these people will say, oh, Solana's just trying to backpedal here. And then I had to ask Vitalik and he's like, yeah, this seems like a stateless client architecture. And it's like, you know, unless the Pope says that, nobody believes you, basically. But it's, it's.
00:45:06.315 - 00:45:25.791, Speaker C: I. The naming is, I think, too homogenized for my liking. Like, it's too easy to get confused with these things. I mean, it's still not even clear what a roll up is on the Ethereum side from. Just if you talk to John Sharp about it and then like people will comment on John Singh and classic mistake.
00:45:25.823 - 00:45:27.407, Speaker A: Is ask John Sharp what a roll up is.
00:45:27.511 - 00:45:48.171, Speaker C: Always these things. And I'm like, the fundamental thing that matters is you need to communicate to the audience who's relevant what the properties of the system are with the name itself. Yeah, like when you say blockchain, you generally understand it's blocks chained together. Yeah, something like that. You see network extension, it's like, okay, I can kind of see where you're going. But it's very broad term.
00:45:48.243 - 00:45:58.751, Speaker A: Yeah. And so your criticism is the exactness and the clarity of the label itself. Tarun, what's your take on the network extensions?
00:45:58.903 - 00:46:34.571, Speaker B: I just don't think it makes that much sense. Also partially due to the clarity piece, but also partially due to the fact that you have restaking on Solana and the restaking services are called networks, but they're not full roll ups at all. Right. They provide a much smaller surface area, a much smaller amount of computation. And those things are also inevitably could fall under the same word network extension. Right. Because they are generating some amount of SVM transactions that mainnet verifies, but they're not themselves running the entire kind of arbitrary computation.
00:46:34.643 - 00:46:39.059, Speaker A: And so is Eclipse or Ellipsis. Are these also network extensions or. No?
00:46:39.187 - 00:46:40.683, Speaker B: Well, those are definitely roll offs.
00:46:40.699 - 00:46:42.691, Speaker C: Yes, those are 100% roll offs.
00:46:42.843 - 00:46:47.255, Speaker A: So they're not network extensions because they settle to Ethereum, they don't settle to Solana.
00:46:47.745 - 00:46:53.769, Speaker C: No, no, they're. Yeah, they're absolutely not. They have nothing to do with Solana except for the VM that they use.
00:46:53.817 - 00:46:55.641, Speaker A: Okay, so they're not considered network extensions.
00:46:55.753 - 00:46:57.097, Speaker C: I would not consider network extensions.
00:46:57.121 - 00:46:57.481, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree.
00:46:57.513 - 00:46:59.777, Speaker A: Okay, but would Austin consider the network extensions is the question.
00:46:59.881 - 00:47:00.569, Speaker C: I have no idea.
00:47:00.617 - 00:47:01.913, Speaker B: Okay, speak for Austin.
00:47:01.969 - 00:47:02.865, Speaker A: Okay, all right, all right.
00:47:02.945 - 00:47:43.175, Speaker C: What I would say though is there are some other weird constructions like magic blocks, like ephemeral roll ups, which like, for that Slot or something. Very briefly, they do these off chain processing and then commit it right back to the state and then pay the same fees. And so you're not actually taking anything away from the L1 really. And so that starts to get a little weird because that doesn't exist in other ecosystems, to my knowledge. And so that's, I think Tolle's argument, which is like, okay, that is kind of different. And so it's, you know, just, I mean, Truman is a math background too, but you just have to be very rigorous with the definitions otherwise everybody just starts getting super fucking confused or mad. Yeah.
00:47:43.295 - 00:47:45.367, Speaker A: Tom, what's your take on network extensions?
00:47:45.471 - 00:47:47.355, Speaker D: I generally probably don't know enough.
00:47:47.655 - 00:47:48.479, Speaker A: Okay.
00:47:48.647 - 00:47:50.367, Speaker D: So yeah, I don't have a strong opinion.
00:47:50.431 - 00:48:32.653, Speaker A: I mean, I can say it feels like clearly the reaction to the word network extensions is almost, I can see that the Ethereum community feels kind of invalidated. Is that like, okay, we invented a lot of these ideas of the co processors and roll ups and validiums and blah blah, blah. And the whole, we created this whole taxonomy, we analyzed the hell out of it for like five years because we staked our lives and our futures on this vision of the world coming true. And it, it sort of feels like, you know, look, I understand that, you know, the EVM world and the SVM world have at times been adversarial, but it's like at least show enough respect to just like call them roll ups if they're roll ups.
00:48:32.709 - 00:49:04.233, Speaker B: You know, this reminds me of like people in the late 90s, early 2000s who are like Windows versus Mac where like, you know, a memory allocator in Windows would have a certain type of name and a memory allocator and a Mac would have a different type of name. And they were realistically the same thing, but because they called them different things, the two types of developers would fight. And of course they didn't have a social network to fight. So it was more like at conferences they would yell at each other, total forums. But I think this is true in a lot of software.
00:49:04.289 - 00:49:22.087, Speaker A: 100%. 100%. But I think it's also the point that you two are making is a point about the clarity of a mathematical description of what is this mechanism doing. And in mathematics it is very, very important to attribute, you know, where did this idea originally come from? And be very, very clear about describing it.
00:49:22.271 - 00:49:29.671, Speaker B: To be fair though, there's a number of theorems in math where the name of the. They're named after people, but neither of them proved it.
00:49:29.823 - 00:49:48.117, Speaker A: Sure, okay. Fine, okay, yes, true. All right, fine. It's a complicated story sometimes, but in business, like you never name the thing after the original person came up with it. Right? So like there have been, you know, somebody comes up with a query language and somebody like basically copies it and calls it. No, this is Salesforce query dialect. And this one is.
00:49:48.117 - 00:49:51.125, Speaker A: Oh no, this is the, you know, I don't know if I get this.
00:49:51.165 - 00:49:54.557, Speaker B: Happened that happens like literally all these database companies always.
00:49:54.661 - 00:50:30.841, Speaker A: Which is, which is, I think, I think where a lot of this discrepancy comes from is that look, look, if you're building a business, of course you want to name the thing after yourself and give it some like mild inflection to like, well, our ecosystem is a little bit different, our needs a little bit different. So this is not SQL, this is BQL because, you know, whatever. And I feel like that's a little bit of what's happening with the network extensions concept, which is naturally because blockchain has both of those elements. Like as you mentioned, the high priests are essentially mathematicians, but then the rank and file are business people who are trying to run businesses. Essentially. It creates this dichotomy.
00:50:30.913 - 00:51:04.455, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean I think again both sides have points here. Like, I think, yeah, you're right, that like Ethereum did pioneer a good amount of the roll up stuff in scaling solutions and they're like, okay, give us some credit. But then Solana also wants the same thing which is like these are some things that we built here, like ZK compression, which actually does not exist there. And so it's unfair to us if you classify it as what you built because we actually built this. And so both sides have some good points. But then I think fundamentally it's just misses the whole point if we're just stuck doing semantics for too long.
00:51:04.535 - 00:51:41.997, Speaker A: That's right, that's right. So, okay, speaking of semantics, let's talk a little bit about so stepping outside of SVM scaling. So it's been widely understood at this point that Solana super, super high performance chain, it's where anybody who wants extremely high throughput is naturally going to pick Solana. But there's a new generation of blockchains that now have incorporated a lot of the learnings from the last four or five years, including from Solana. And many of them in some sense are a response to Solana. So in that group I put Monad, Mega Eth, the swe, Aptos as well as some of the new generation roll ups like Eclipse and Ellipsis and so on. What is your take.
00:51:41.997 - 00:51:52.545, Speaker A: And I know that you're also an investor in several of these. What is your take on how these things fit into the future of where high performance blockchains are going to go?
00:51:54.215 - 00:52:55.765, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean fundamentally, as I said earlier in the episode, I care about the problem of apps. How do we get app developers a platform such that they can actually bring their ideas to life and actually build stuff for crypto? So I think anybody who helps with that mission is a net good to the industry, provided that all the security and the risks and suffer very transparently laid out. Which is what I liked about Mega Eth, which is like they basically say, here's what we're going to do, here's how it works, here are the risks, et cetera, and that's it. And so that's a good approach in my view because I don't think every again, I don't think all use cases require this global state machine. I don't think everybody needs those properties. And so if you're okay with being in an L2 environment or something for your use case like a game, I think that totally makes sense. And then things like Monad and stuff, I think, yeah, I'm still curious to see how that'll play out.
00:52:55.765 - 00:53:31.859, Speaker C: That seems to be more like an EVM play where it's like a lot of people already have EVM apps. There's already a lot of good tooling around this. Can we tap into that network effect such that we can get those developers who didn't want to come to the SVM and actually get them to build on this new L1? I think that also makes sense. And I mean that team also used to do some stuff on Solana. So I think that's, that's a net good as well. And then, and then SUI is just doing it completely differently. Like they have a very different architecture in some regards and you know, they have an object based model, they have good numbers.
00:53:31.859 - 00:53:58.383, Speaker C: And then the question for them seems to be like, okay, can we actually get. Because like bootstrapping a new ecosystem is super difficult and it seems to be less of a technical thing, but more of a, you know, BD distribution ecosystem. That sort of challenge for them. And so I don't think there will be like it's basically impossible for there to be one or two chains that just do everything in my view.
00:53:58.479 - 00:53:59.115, Speaker A: Sure.
00:53:59.775 - 00:54:45.893, Speaker C: Not, not even from a technical perspective. Like I think totally could reasonably make the argument that you could support a good amount of activity once a certain threshold of scaling gets met on single L1, but I think it's the incentives of just businesses and economics and culture and all this that make it impossible for that vision to be a reality. I think everybody will want or I think some people will want like their custom app space, like sovereign roll ups or like app chains and stuff like that. Some people will want the generalized L1 that don't want to deal with all these because like the other ones already have a bunch of integrations with wallets and analytics indexes and all this stuff. They just don't want to bother with all that stuff. They just want to plug into something that works well.
00:54:45.909 - 00:54:59.053, Speaker A: To that end, do you think we're basically done on VMs? So we essentially have four, which is EVM, SVM, WASM and move. Do you think there's room for a fifth or do you think it's basically 20 years from now? What's that?
00:54:59.109 - 00:55:00.765, Speaker B: There's a lot of dead dead there.
00:55:00.845 - 00:55:15.135, Speaker A: Arbitrarily many dead ones. Yeah, correct. That never quite, you know, survived birthday is your take that you think in 20 years there's going to be four? Are there going to be two? Is there going to be just one in 20 years?
00:55:15.515 - 00:55:21.755, Speaker C: Oh man. I'm very not comfortable with predicting future stuff.
00:55:21.835 - 00:55:25.475, Speaker A: You're an angel investor now. You vote with your money.
00:55:25.555 - 00:55:56.913, Speaker C: Yeah, I wouldn't invest in it myself. I don't think it solves a meaningful enough problem today or even in five years or 10 years. That I think is actually a bottleneck. I think like for Solana the bottleneck is bandwidth and networking and stuff like that. Yeah, for other ecosystems it seems like maybe state growth and then for other ecosystems it seems to be not tech at all. And like Swede seems to be distribution of business bd. So it really depends on the problems it's saying exists and that it can solve better than anybody else.
00:55:56.913 - 00:56:00.225, Speaker C: And I don't see the VM as being the problem today.
00:56:00.345 - 00:56:13.225, Speaker A: Right. Tarun, what's your take on the vm? By the way, I should clarify, VM means virtual machine. It's basically the language that, essentially the programming environment or language that or sort of operating system that a blockchain runs on top of.
00:56:13.385 - 00:57:25.905, Speaker B: Yeah, I think one place I'd probably differ is I do think the MOVE ecosystem languages, their tooling is like much more premature. And I don't think it's just a pure business thing. I actually think it's hard to attract new developers. Everyone I feel like who's in the movie ecosystem loves the language. But then really there's no one building tooling they have this kind of tragedy of the commons problem, which you often times see in the beginning of a new language or new virtual machine, where there's a ton of people who really love the new language features and they'll write prototypes or proof of concepts or little kind of tiny projects, but nothing that's in production has maintenance, DevOps, whatever, updates, because the tooling to do that is annoying. And I actually think one thing that Solana got over the hump on was tooling and some of that tooling. Maybe there's still people fighting over whether to use Anchor or not, but some of that tooling, maybe not exactly the cutting edge of what people want, but they got to the point that I think onboarding a new developer is significantly easier.
00:57:25.905 - 00:58:18.857, Speaker B: The Nth developer, the cost of onboarding them is significantly less than the early ones. Whereas I'm not totally sure that's true for Move yet. It could change, right? I think the gap in terms of how you reason about programming a very secure contract between evm, where there's lots of ways you can shoot yourself in the foot, but there's a ton of established practices and tooling to make sure you don't shoot yourself with a foot gun svm, where because of the performance benefits and because it still mainly looks like normal rust, you're fine. You don't need to know that much more. If you've written in other programming languages. Move is more like, am I writing in Haskell? Right. I really do have to think a lot more about every time I instantiate an object where it's going.
00:58:18.857 - 00:58:58.245, Speaker B: And I think the overhead for a developer varies quite a bit from all these in these ecosystems. And it's really just about a, Is there a lot of tooling for making sure you don't shoot yourself by making a mistake? Remember, a lot of these applications will have hundreds of millions or billions of dollars in them, so you really have to be much more careful. And then B, I think. I think all three might survive, but there'll be some very fast decay where 50% is in the top, VM30 is in the second, and then after that you have the tail really small.
00:58:58.405 - 00:59:45.473, Speaker A: What's also interesting is that oftentimes there is some element of you stand on the shoulders of giants of the infrastructure that has come before you, of people who built there was way, way back in the day, it was Remix for the EVM and then it was Ganache, and then it was Foundry. And there is this sort of progression, but it's oftentimes just one project that ends up making the devex on a platform just really, really huge step function improvement. And it often feels like it's just, it's hard to find who that person is who is going to transform this developer ecosystem into just being really, really good and really just a pleasure for people to use. So that's one thing that's surprising. It's almost like a sort of strongman theory of how a developer environment or how a programming language ends up going from a toy to being.
00:59:45.489 - 01:00:16.427, Speaker B: Actually I also think that's going to change in the next one year in the sense the AI code tools are just so different now that people's learn the learning curve might be a lot smaller. So you could actually see all three of these ecosystems do really well if they happen to build the cursor for their language. That is really good that your marginal cost for the next developer is decreasing because I always think of these things as drawing a curve of the x axis.
01:00:16.531 - 01:01:00.559, Speaker A: That's a very interesting point. That's one of the things about Move is that you know, it's very easy to formally verify move code and now it's only useful if you actually do that, right? If you write Move code and you don't actually use all the advantages that Move confers on you, which naturally it has some just from the object model, but you sort of have to go the extra mile to actually get all the mileage out of what you're getting with Move. But if we get to a place where AI and basically these automated software engineering tools, Cursor obviously is a kind of nice first cut but probably over within the next five years going to see much more capable autonomous software creation tools and they might just make it that it's like okay, well to the extent that the EVM has these really nice affordances, they just matter a lot less because human beings are writing less of the code.
01:01:00.687 - 01:01:09.063, Speaker B: I also think we haven't had that many crypto people fine tune custom code models the way you have for all.
01:01:09.079 - 01:01:19.479, Speaker A: These other well, apptos actually has I think done. They did something with, I think with Microsoft where they fine tuned some kind of copilot type thing on aptos Move.
01:01:19.527 - 01:01:37.967, Speaker B: Maybe I've only really written, looked at and written EVM and SVM contracts and you can see which things it gets right and which things it completely gets wrong. And it does feel a lot worse than just general Rust or Python where the output you get is significantly better.
01:01:38.031 - 01:02:06.059, Speaker A: But I think that is a large part a function of the fact that the way in which these kind of software engineering stuff is working is very pattern matchy. And I think when we get more and more robust software engineering, O1 is a great example of being able to explore more of the state space of how you actually write a program and evaluate a program. I think it's going to be much more like you shove an entire language spec into the context window and it just figures out how to write the language.
01:02:06.147 - 01:02:34.601, Speaker B: Yeah. So I guess my answer to your question if we pop the stack back to iterations is I think we're at this very weird juncture where the notion of programming is changing so much that it may. There might actually be this phase transition where all of a sudden it's just as easy to write Move and whereas like six months ago was like impossible or like to do production stuff and that thing is the biggest unknown uncertainty to me.
01:02:34.673 - 01:02:35.433, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
01:02:35.449 - 01:03:18.955, Speaker C: I have a. I've been playing around with this quite a bit. I've been like live streaming some like what you can build with Cursor on Solana and built like three apps with it like a explorer, a price tracker, etc. And actually one of the realizations I had was I think the EVM has a huge advantage there because there's so much more open source material in existing material that the models can actually read off of. Versus on Solana it was still giving me relatively outdated docs for a bunch of the stuff and I would have to tell it to fix it, which you can do, right? Like if you have a spec you can just say here, read from this instead. But I think that small friction is. And I think Move will have it even worse because there's less open source stuff available.
01:03:18.955 - 01:03:50.509, Speaker C: I think that'll play a big role in my view. And so whoever can. And that's what teams like Helios basically. We actually just added an AI feature to the Explorer which is not released yet. You know, it took generalized AI to make Solana readable such that you can. Because it actually understands the Solana core docs pretty well when you, when you tell it how it works. And then you can kind of use that with, with like our existing documentation which is much more up to date than what Cursor has.
01:03:50.509 - 01:04:23.965, Speaker C: And then when you combine them, it actually becomes much easier to write Solana code. I think that's, you know, there's probably still like two to three years left to go until that stuff is more mature. But yeah, I do wonder how it'll evolve. Exactly. Because you also don't want to, you know, trust it too much for Things that hold funds in mainnet especially, you still need to get audits and stuff. So it's still unknown. But I think the EVM does have a good advantage from just having so much material and data that the models can leverage already.
01:04:24.395 - 01:04:51.945, Speaker B: Well, I think to your point about the O1 type of RL type models is inference time kind of updates is that you can generate code much more efficiently that you're testing against live and that means you need a smaller initial data set. Provided the initial data set is a good ground truth data set. Maybe if it's outdated, buy like X number of versions, it won't work.
01:04:52.025 - 01:04:52.289, Speaker A: Right.
01:04:52.337 - 01:05:05.265, Speaker B: But I do think, yeah, that could really change the game for these languages that don't have much source material. And so it's very hard to predict where that will go because that field has evolved so much in the last six months that it's like.
01:05:05.345 - 01:05:14.713, Speaker A: Yeah, but almost certainly software engineering is going to be the first thing to fall as these models get better and better and we just throw more and more compute time training material against them. Like.
01:05:14.769 - 01:05:18.525, Speaker B: Well, the O1 is not just compute time, it's architecture, you know.
01:05:18.605 - 01:05:22.797, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. We don't know exactly what it's doing. They haven't disclosed much, but some kind of Monte Carlo research.
01:05:22.861 - 01:06:12.585, Speaker B: A bunch of my old coworkers work on it and I will say that like it. It does seem like it's much more about the architecture than it is at all about compute. Right. Like I would argue that anthropic went the route of throw away more compute and synthetic data and OpenAI went down the route of treat it more like a game theory thing at inference time. And so my friend who works on team, his PhD was on building the first bot that beat humans at poker called Libertas and they took way more of a multi agent game approach than generate synthetic data approach. And so I think that's why you're starting to see the difference between claudin01. Sorry, it's a divergent for our audience.
01:06:12.625 - 01:06:31.113, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, a little bit sidetracked. So, okay, I want to bring it back to ground us in crypto a little bit more to close out the show. So one of the things that people have been commenting on crypto is a little bit of slump over the last month and we've seen volumes on chain start to retrace a little bit. Solana has been no exception to that.
01:06:31.249 - 01:06:33.825, Speaker B: And we've also went from highbrow to price talk.
01:06:33.905 - 01:07:02.059, Speaker A: That was a fast. We got to bring the audience back, we got to bring the audience back. So naturally, one of the projects that has been seeing a slump is Pump Fun, which of course has driven a lot of the on chain volumes in Solana this year. And so I want to bring back to a question. So we talked a little bit last show that we've seen the sentiment start to turn against Pump Fun in that once upon a time people were like, oh, pump fun is great. It's democratizing meme coins. This is awesome.
01:07:02.059 - 01:07:22.479, Speaker A: And now people are starting to say, well, but pump Fun, it's kind of extractive. Is this really good for crypto? Um, we, I, I remember we were on a panel together. I think first time I met you in person, we were on a panel together talking about meme coins. I think it was at the last token, 2049, and that was like peak meme coins in May, June, something like that. Yeah, it was sometime early summer.
01:07:22.527 - 01:07:23.967, Speaker C: Yeah, it was with Ansem and it was Ansem.
01:07:23.991 - 01:07:43.511, Speaker A: Yeah, Ansem was on stage and it was. We were all out of our element besides him. And so now that we are very kind of in the late part of the meme coin cycle, seemingly, what is your thoughts on our Meme Coins and. Or Pump Fun good for crypto? What would you say? You can be honest.
01:07:43.703 - 01:07:48.687, Speaker C: Good for crypto. Well, there's a debate about this at Breakpoint with Iggy.
01:07:48.791 - 01:07:49.543, Speaker A: Okay.
01:07:49.719 - 01:07:51.967, Speaker C: And Eric Wall. And Eric Wall. That'll be a good one.
01:07:52.071 - 01:07:53.111, Speaker A: I'm looking forward to that.
01:07:53.183 - 01:07:53.479, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:07:53.527 - 01:07:56.235, Speaker A: But we need, we need the MERT pregame.
01:07:57.735 - 01:08:24.985, Speaker C: It's. I think it's very hard again to homogenize the entire category is good or bad. I think certainly there's meme coins that could be good. Like, I think Bonk, for example, is a good meme coin in that they basically fund hackathons and it's basically a stealth startup that's funded by speculation and things like that. That being said, I think it's just about the only one that's good that I've seen.
01:08:25.065 - 01:08:27.805, Speaker A: I see. This is a very Vitalik esque take on meme coins.
01:08:29.975 - 01:09:02.821, Speaker C: The way I think about it, when people say like pump is extractive or it's killed meme coins and then, you know, like blur killed NFTs. It's like this demand for people doing this stuff existed. Like people wanted to launch coins and buy NFTs and sell. Like they wanted to do this and a business came to meet that demand and people were willing to pay money such that they can conduct these activities. So I don't think it's like it's killing anything. It's just making. It's meeting a demand that already exists in the market.
01:09:02.853 - 01:09:06.469, Speaker A: So you resist the idea that Pump Fund has agency in the meme coin cycle.
01:09:06.557 - 01:09:19.293, Speaker C: Oh, they certainly have agency, but I don't think like, I don't think they can like single handedly kill a category because the category is market driven. It's a market driven sector.
01:09:19.389 - 01:09:19.917, Speaker A: Sure, Right.
01:09:19.941 - 01:09:43.555, Speaker C: Like the market needs to collectively come to some decision or, you know, converge on something whether they think it's good, bad, which is reflected by the price, maybe, or the activity. Yeah, but I don't think, I think most of them are bad. Like, I think most of the meme coins are just useless in and obviously are clearly there to just replace some version of a casino.
01:09:44.455 - 01:09:45.903, Speaker A: But casinos are bad.
01:09:46.039 - 01:10:22.035, Speaker C: I don't think casinos are bad. And so my next point was going to be like, people want to speculate and gamble on these things and so now they have a tool to help them do that easier. There's people who don't want to do that thing, do those things and they shouldn't do those things. I don't trade meme coins myself, but I'm not going to tell you to not do it because I don't do it. If you want to do it, it's a permissionless system, Go do it. My problem with it is that when people say solana is only good for meme coins, it's like, no, it just turned out to be a place where you can just launch these coins and trade them the easiest. Right.
01:10:22.035 - 01:10:39.307, Speaker C: It's like we're not going to add extra friction just for ideological purposes. Like that's not going to. That would be an even worse look, in my view. Sure. So I don't think they're good or bad. I think there's clearly PMF for people who want to speculate and do these sorts of things and they should just be able to do whatever they want.
01:10:39.331 - 01:10:43.757, Speaker A: Like it sort of. It sounds like you're saying they're mostly bad, but then you ended it with they're neither good or bad.
01:10:43.931 - 01:10:58.377, Speaker C: I think individual coins launched are obviously like, if you have an uneducated user that is just like aping into it and they're like, oh, I want to get rich, whatever. It's like they'll learn their lesson. Right. Like you. This is a.
01:10:58.441 - 01:11:00.481, Speaker A: So you will lose money if you trade meme coins is what you're saying.
01:11:00.513 - 01:11:15.371, Speaker C: You will lose money if you trade meme coins and have no idea what you're doing. Some of these guys do make money, and it's like any other speculative kind of thing. I just feel very. I'm like, no one to tell people what they should be doing.
01:11:15.443 - 01:11:15.763, Speaker A: Okay.
01:11:15.819 - 01:11:22.907, Speaker C: So, like, I think they can be good. Like, in the case of Bonk, I think most often in practice, they have been bad.
01:11:22.971 - 01:11:23.499, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:11:23.627 - 01:11:33.851, Speaker C: But I think the entire category itself is just that it's a category. It's just meeting a demand that people have, and they're going to continue to do it no matter what anybody thinks.
01:11:33.923 - 01:11:34.575, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:11:35.635 - 01:11:54.019, Speaker C: I wouldn't say it's like extractive, though. The only extractive part of it, I would say, is the sandwich games kind of being played and stuff like that. That's obvious. But, you know, we're working to solve the MEB problems on Solana as well, so I don't know if that answers the question.
01:11:54.067 - 01:12:03.787, Speaker A: I mean, that's a good enough answer. Tom Mert raised the analogy between Blur and Pump Fun. What do you think of that connection? Because we've talked about that on the show as well.
01:12:03.811 - 01:12:04.019, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:12:04.067 - 01:12:11.515, Speaker D: I think there are markets where when you add, like, legibility and efficiency, it kind of kills it. It's like you turn on the lights at the club and it's like, all.
01:12:11.515 - 01:12:11.987, Speaker B: Right, this is a little.
01:12:12.011 - 01:12:12.867, Speaker C: This is a little sad now.
01:12:12.891 - 01:12:18.955, Speaker D: Or it's like how, like, weed's not cool anymore. You know, like, 20 years ago, it was like, it's a little edgy, a little cool, and now it's just like.
01:12:19.075 - 01:12:22.571, Speaker A: You can, like, weed still cool in Singapore. Oh, yeah, we're in Singapore.
01:12:22.763 - 01:12:55.061, Speaker D: But it's now. It's like, now it's like a little cringe. It's like, all right, it's not, you know, it's too legible. And I think, you know, Meme Coins are maybe in a similar bucket where trying to recreate this very organic thing that happened with kind of like airdrops in some ways, too, where it's like, there's a very cool, organic moment that happened, and then people basically just pummel it to death by trying to make these sort of games on top of it and think this is maybe kind of what's happening with Meme Coins right now, where people want to sort of have that organic spark that has happened in the past. And then it's like, you can't sort of force that. And then you just, I think, kind of kill the market.
01:12:55.153 - 01:12:56.853, Speaker A: You hear that, guys? Thomas is over.
01:12:56.909 - 01:12:57.237, Speaker D: Sorry.
01:12:57.301 - 01:13:09.597, Speaker A: That's it. All right. With that, we got a wrap, hopefully to see you guys at token 2049. And break point. I think, actually I was. I was at. I was at a dinner with Raj from Solana and he was like.
01:13:09.597 - 01:13:21.013, Speaker A: I told him, oh, yeah, I'm going to be in Singapore for token 2049. And he was like, you mean for Break Point? Yes, yes, yes, for Breakpoint. At Break Point as well. So that's it. We'll see all you guys next week. Thanks, everyone.
01:13:21.069 - 01:13:21.165, Speaker C: Yeah.
