00:00:00.330 - 00:00:02.474, Speaker A: Not a dividend, it's a tale of two quant.
00:00:02.522 - 00:00:05.162, Speaker B: Now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet.
00:00:05.226 - 00:00:07.722, Speaker C: Generally speaking, airdrops are kind of pointless anyways.
00:00:07.866 - 00:00:10.570, Speaker B: Unnamed trading firms who are very involved.
00:00:10.650 - 00:00:12.762, Speaker D: Alec ETH is the ultimate thumbnail.
00:00:12.826 - 00:00:15.840, Speaker E: DeFi protocols are the antidote to this problem.
00:00:18.630 - 00:00:44.514, Speaker B: Alright, hello everybody, welcome to the chopping block. Every couple weeks the four of us get together and give the industry insider's perspective on the crypto topics of the day. Me, we've got a special guest list today, let me start with intros. So first we've got Tom, the DeFi maven and master of Memes. Next up there's Robert, the crypto connoisseur and Captain of Compound. Then we've got Tarun, the gigabrain and grand Poohba at Gauntlet. And our special guest today we've got Balaji Srinivasan, the bitcoin brainiac.
00:00:44.514 - 00:01:09.526, Speaker B: And then myself, I'm Haseeb, the head hype man at Dragonfly. So I just want to say the four of us are early stage investors in crypto. But I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice, legal advice, or for that matter, political advice. Balaji, welcome to the show. It's been a while since I wanted to get you on here, but you told me the first time I invited you that you were busy writing a book and that you didn't want to deal with any media. I think it was July 4 that.
00:01:09.628 - 00:01:12.600, Speaker F: You finally released the book, right? Yeah, that's right.
00:01:13.690 - 00:01:23.322, Speaker B: How's that experience been now coming up for air after getting a book out, I know that that's probably a harrowing experience to get all the way to the finish line. How does it feel to be on the other side?
00:01:23.456 - 00:02:09.062, Speaker A: Yeah, no, it's good. Well, I mean, the thing is, I think of it as V one. I think of this normally an app is considered very dynamic and a book is considered static and it's shipped and I think there are multiple editions, second edition, third edition, et cetera. So in the same way, I think of this as v One of this book app and I'm planning on shipping actually much more. I may have 50% left to right, frankly, in some ways. And as I was discussing with you, taking a little bit of a distance from it, then coming back and rereading it and processing some of the early feedback and so on and so forth is very helpful because I'm going to factor it into a problem and solution. Kind of like a reframe and add way more flesh on the bones of certain things.
00:02:09.062 - 00:02:36.146, Speaker A: But yeah, it's good. I think the reception has been quite good. I think network state, if you just queried that in quotes, network state on Twitter has achieved memetic inception. So to know like it's out there. People are kind of thinking of this as a concept to denote something that people have talked about for a long time. So I think it's kind of right time, right place. This is honestly what I think all of this crazy D Five machinery will fund.
00:02:36.146 - 00:02:57.706, Speaker A: This is the actual productive asset at the end of the day in the air or on the ground, which is this will be the financing for startup societies. And the way I kind of think about it is I think I mentioned this analogy to you on the phone. You guys ever seen, like, a tornado whirling through the Midwest and it takes, like, a little house and goes, Whoosh. And it whirls it up into the air. You guys ever seen that?
00:02:57.728 - 00:02:58.058, Speaker F: Right?
00:02:58.144 - 00:03:50.026, Speaker A: So I often think of crypto as a space that's building the economy. Wall street first, main street last. So if you imagine that tornado whirling in reverse so you start in the air with a digital gold, and then you're building out this whole DFI Wall Street financial speculation economy, and now we're getting Web Three infrastructure. In the very last frame of the movie, it goes flick like this with the wrist and with these billions and billions of dollars in the cloud goes like this. And all the buildings build out on Main Street, right? Because those are actually all just fog of H of X for this massive composable infrastructure here. The financing is there. You can pull it in from around the world, and it's just like a few bucks to just go and print it out in physical space, right? And that is actually kind of how I think about this entire machine that we've built can actually now be pointed at financing things in the physical world.
00:03:50.026 - 00:03:55.062, Speaker A: And it's not like people talk about municipal bonds.
00:03:55.126 - 00:03:56.650, Speaker F: It's like municipal equity.
00:03:57.070 - 00:03:59.194, Speaker A: You just go like this, and then you build it.
00:03:59.232 - 00:03:59.482, Speaker F: Okay.
00:03:59.536 - 00:04:00.346, Speaker A: As much where, I can say.
00:04:00.368 - 00:04:13.082, Speaker B: But that's how the book is full of a lot of futuristic concepts. It's interesting, though, because you and I have had conversations over the years. Just right away background. I used to work for Biology back at 21, which became Earn.com, which got acquired by Coinbase.
00:04:13.146 - 00:04:15.134, Speaker A: Yeah, five years ago. Six years ago thereabouts.
00:04:15.182 - 00:04:36.066, Speaker B: Five years ago. That's right, five years ago. So I've heard so many of these concepts in kind of the early gestation of these ideas until they were formalized in this book, in a way, although you are obviously somebody who lives at the frontier intellectually. But writing a book is also a very old school way to express ideas.
00:04:36.098 - 00:04:37.962, Speaker F: So I have to ask, like, why.
00:04:38.016 - 00:04:42.682, Speaker B: Did you write a book, of all things, of all the futuristic, crazy things that you could have done?
00:04:42.736 - 00:04:46.682, Speaker F: Why a, you know, I'm pragmatic enough.
00:04:46.816 - 00:05:14.138, Speaker A: To make certain concessions to reality, or what have you actually think about Coinbase itself? When Coinbase first came out, the centralized exchanges first came out. I don't know if you guys remember this, but it was considered heresy to A, have password reset rather than fully custodial everything. B, this is bitcoin. Why are you doing bank integration?
00:05:14.254 - 00:05:14.822, Speaker F: Right?
00:05:14.956 - 00:05:49.454, Speaker A: C, this is bitcoin. Why are you buying with dollars for Fiat, right? And I think sometimes you have something which is like a bad hybrid of the old and the new, like enterprise. Blockchain is like a bad hybrid which had all the bad aspects of enterprise and all the technical complexity, social complexity of enterprise, the technical complexity of blockchain just didn't work. It didn't have the incentives, right. It was trying to do blockchains without tokens. But sometimes you have a good hybrid, a fertile hybrid, et cetera. And I kind of think that something like what I've done, we'll see if it works.
00:05:49.454 - 00:06:43.342, Speaker A: But in some ways, my biggest concession to the old world is just having an Amazon page for the book, right, that shows it's actually like a marked thing. It's like a timestamp release. It's not just a continuous flow of tweets for people have to put together. It's a shelling point for people to refer to. And now that is actually like an installed base where I can just push more and more and more and more content into and maybe that widens and it's like 700 pages and all kinds of crazy stuff in there by the end. But it's like, okay, just go to that and you'll download the whole thing, right? The 20 21, 20, 22, 20 23, 20 24 edition that can push 50 pages, 100 pages of update every year, right? So kind of thinking of a book as in the old school way, as a shelling point that you can refer people to, but having some hybrid with a new school concept of being able to update it. This is all kind of obvious stuff in a sense.
00:06:43.342 - 00:07:31.370, Speaker A: Like, even in the early 2010s or whatever, when the iPad first came out, al Gore actually was kind of a pioneer in this space. He actually leaving aside whatever else, I know people like don't like Al Gore, but I respect him, actually as a technologist, because he did like interactive book stuff and so on and so forth. You go back and look at what he did with an inconvenient had kind of he was kind of doing some interesting stuff with like it was like one of the first interactive, textbook like things and so on. It's actually still pretty fresh looking, but at the time it was just a little too early. It was ahead of its time. People weren't paying for content on the Internet, all that type of stuff. But I think it's actually worth revisiting that now that after COVID we've had the digital flipping where the Internet is first and the physical is now secondary.
00:07:31.450 - 00:07:31.902, Speaker F: Go ahead.
00:07:31.956 - 00:07:34.720, Speaker A: I want to give somebody else a mic. So I'll go on.
00:07:35.430 - 00:07:37.826, Speaker E: All right, I'll ask the first question here.
00:07:37.928 - 00:07:39.714, Speaker A: So based on that model you just.
00:07:39.752 - 00:08:16.640, Speaker E: Explained, one of the use cases I could see is you could possess an NFT that gives you access to all of the current editions that come out, and you could sell or transfer the NFT and there could be some market for it, but you could basically identify the ownership of the rights to all future editions in some very crypto native way. Have you thought about alternate models that go off of the web two Rails and come onto web3 Rails? Can people pay for the book in crypto? How do you track that ownership and those rights? Is it just Amazon as a platform? What's going through your head?
00:08:17.570 - 00:08:44.310, Speaker A: Great question. So we did issue like a commemorative NFT for the book, right. And that's kind of like a marker, right? Like basically you pay $10 for the book and we issue, I think, a pretty cool NFT. We did that through Openc and so on. But that was not meant to actually be a speculative asset. And I mean, maybe it could be or whatever, but it was not meant to be that. It was kind of just meant to be a marker.
00:08:46.090 - 00:08:47.666, Speaker B: Let me give a thought that I'm.
00:08:47.698 - 00:08:50.166, Speaker F: Having, which is that writing a book.
00:08:50.188 - 00:09:00.234, Speaker B: In some sense, so a lot of people in crypto are already familiar with your ideas. You make the rounds, obviously. You're a very well known thinker within the world of crypto. In a way, it seems to me.
00:09:00.272 - 00:09:03.318, Speaker F: Like writing a book, it's almost know.
00:09:03.424 - 00:09:12.442, Speaker B: Somebody who wrote one of the consensus protocols for somebody who worked on Casper and decided to write up an academic paper and submit it to an academic journal.
00:09:12.506 - 00:09:13.166, Speaker F: Right.
00:09:13.348 - 00:09:15.006, Speaker B: In a way, it's kind of crossing.
00:09:15.038 - 00:09:18.754, Speaker F: A chasm to a different kind of.
00:09:18.792 - 00:09:42.154, Speaker B: Audience and a different kind of status game that's very different from the one that gets played in the ethereum researching community. And so in that way, it's like, look, if you want to make your ideas legible to a broader audience outside of crypto and the people who are already fairly disposed to agree with you, then you need to make them legible in a format like a page, you know, clean table of contents and blah, blah, blah. Because otherwise you're speaking to people who.
00:09:42.192 - 00:09:44.220, Speaker F: Already broadly agree with you.
00:09:44.750 - 00:10:07.794, Speaker A: That's definitely part of it. But I think Robert's question was on crypto native mechanisms, but basically yeah, haseeb, I think I mean, the other thing is also thenworkstate.com, boom, you can just remember that, right. That is memorable, that fits in the head. Like, I can't read all of somebody's tweets. If you point me at their Twitter, I can read their most recent things and they're not going to be able to recapitulate everything that they said there.
00:10:07.832 - 00:10:08.274, Speaker F: Right.
00:10:08.392 - 00:10:38.154, Speaker A: And so this is sort of like the V three. Like v one is everybody writes books and they're disaggregated. V two is they have these tweets and they get upvoted or commented on and you have these kind of distilled nuggets. And the v three is a rebundling. And actually something I think is underrated that we're going to see a lot of is the rebundling of social content. Sort of like you go from albums to MP3 s to spotify playlists. The rebundling actually does add value.
00:10:38.154 - 00:11:26.266, Speaker A: You can see some examples of this, for example, with NIV Drawer's calendar, the Shrug calendar, I'm not sure if you guys have seen that right, is just taking Tweets, which are public and free, but putting them back together in a new and interesting way actually does add value. Many establishment periodicals, as you know, a lot of political coverage is effectively just like sports articles are recycles of the box score and financial articles are recycles of the ticker symbols. Many political articles are just wrappers around Tweets, right? And so the concept of kind of taking social content and then reaggregating an interesting way, I actually think we'll see much more of, especially as the back ends open up with crypto social media. But actually, Robert, to answer your question, and maybe this is like the next cycle or whatever of crypto, I have.
00:11:26.288 - 00:11:29.566, Speaker F: Always only been interested in crypto and.
00:11:29.588 - 00:11:44.450, Speaker A: Even software as a tool to advance us basically to get to the promised land of life extension and of advanced technology.
00:11:44.600 - 00:11:48.066, Speaker F: There's folks who love the charts and.
00:11:48.088 - 00:11:52.626, Speaker A: They love the finance aspect of it and so on. And I'm fine with that.
00:11:52.728 - 00:11:56.310, Speaker F: But I wanted to actually write this.
00:11:56.380 - 00:12:19.900, Speaker A: And then add crypto things if and when it made sense, to help people do things like ENS login for the book app of subsequent versions so you can save your space or there's things like that that we'll do. But I didn't want to start with having financial things driving it. I wanted to put them in if and when it made sense. And again, I'm not against other people.
00:12:20.510 - 00:12:22.266, Speaker F: Who love that stuff, right.
00:12:22.368 - 00:12:30.782, Speaker A: But I think of this very much as like a horse as opposed to or an engine, as opposed to the destination of the car or know okay, go ahead.
00:12:30.836 - 00:12:58.002, Speaker D: I had one quick question related to that. So the definition, the book is actually sort of this long compound sentence. And also you referenced the fact that Britannica also does the same kind of long compound sentence, which I thought was kind of funny. So of those kind of each clause, I guess there are two that are directly related to crypto, right? The integrated cryptocurrency and this notion of consensual government limited by social smart contract.
00:12:58.066 - 00:13:02.374, Speaker B: What actually Tarun, before we get to that question, can you just read that entire definition?
00:13:02.502 - 00:13:09.834, Speaker A: Well, read the short one first because I actually have the informal sentence. Read the informal sentence, so otherwise it seems like I'm totally unreasonable. See at the top?
00:13:09.872 - 00:13:11.642, Speaker D: Yeah, okay.
00:13:11.696 - 00:13:12.300, Speaker F: Yeah.
00:13:12.610 - 00:13:23.790, Speaker D: A network state is a highly aligned online community with capacity for collective action that crowdfunds territory around the world and eventually gains diplomatic recognition from preexisting.
00:13:23.870 - 00:14:02.554, Speaker A: It's a long sentence, but it parses and every adjective there. Let me just kind of analyze that. And the reason is you guys are all tweeters, and so you know that people will pick over every syllable or whatever. I know it's a syllable, but whatever. So a network state is a highly aligned online community, as opposed to typical online communities that have no alignment, okay, or very minimal alignment with a capacity for collective action. Again, that's a very high bar, right? Yeah. If you just go and most dows, most discords, it's like herding cats.
00:14:02.554 - 00:14:18.034, Speaker A: They're there for the airdrops and stuff. There's capacity for individual gain. That's what they care about. But not for collective action and sacrifice working towards something. One way I think about it, if you think about Twitter itself, imagine an NBA game where every player just saw.
00:14:18.072 - 00:14:21.618, Speaker F: Their own score, but there was no team score, right?
00:14:21.704 - 00:14:58.750, Speaker A: How many dunks, how many points, whatever. But there was no literally, the sum was not shown, right? That's what Twitter is, where everybody has their own stats, right? They have their own followers or likes or blah, blah, blah. But what they do not have is any team score for their ostensible faction, which means that you have soap opera like betrayals and all kinds of stupid stuff happening where people who think they're actually perhaps they made themselves think they're advancing some ideological cause. But the tribalism is in a very primitive way. It's not like the organized and systematic.
00:15:00.050 - 00:15:02.670, Speaker F: Tribalism of an actual team, right?
00:15:02.740 - 00:15:15.122, Speaker A: Where there's boundaries to the team, there's hierarchy, there's organization, there's division of labor. It is the sort of animalistic tribalism of like an informal group, right? It's not like a scalable sort of thing. It's not a group that goes out to win.
00:15:15.176 - 00:15:15.442, Speaker F: Right?
00:15:15.496 - 00:15:34.506, Speaker A: That's what I mean. A capacity for collective action like a startup is just completely different from a group of randos on Twitter. Then the crowdfunds territory around the world. Why do I include that? Well, the physicality look, I'm a huge digital person. I do think remote first, et cetera. But one of the concepts I talk about in the book, the least popular word in the world, but which I think is one of the most important words in the world.
00:15:34.528 - 00:15:38.234, Speaker F: You know what that is? Recentralization. Okay.
00:15:38.352 - 00:15:45.866, Speaker A: Why is decentralization ridiculously unpopular as a word? Because both centralization and decentralization proponents don't.
00:15:45.898 - 00:15:51.966, Speaker F: Like it in different ways, okay? Why? The centralization proponents will be like, what.
00:15:51.988 - 00:15:57.970, Speaker A: Do you mean, new boss? Same as the old boss, and so will the decentralization proponents. They'll both say that that's actually bad.
00:15:58.040 - 00:15:58.562, Speaker F: Right?
00:15:58.696 - 00:16:01.218, Speaker A: But if you actually look at it.
00:16:01.384 - 00:16:06.146, Speaker F: Recentralization, what that would mean is consensual.
00:16:06.258 - 00:16:47.778, Speaker A: Recentralization in the same way that you go album to MP3 to playlist, there's many more analogies that are like that, right? You have newspaper, you break it out into articles, you rebundle into a Twitter feed. When you actually look at what human behavior is, they want that legibility, they want that discoverability, they want some order reimposed on the chaos. But that initial order is actually not suitable for them. So you break and then you reassemble. And these are like historical cycles. That because the Internet we're just seeing happen much faster. And the thing is, the reason I say decentralization is an important word, is that aspect of crowdfunding territory around the world, we have now gone remote first, right?
00:16:47.864 - 00:16:48.354, Speaker F: All of us.
00:16:48.392 - 00:17:13.354, Speaker A: I don't even know where your locations are, but it's probably not the same room. It's probably five different cities, right? This is actually kind of our community, okay? But we could take pieces of this social graph and then actually have them. You could have crypto towns and villages. We have the resources now as a community to start doing this. And now everybody's got something in common. When you walk down the street, you know that person, right?
00:17:13.552 - 00:17:14.394, Speaker F: Wow.
00:17:14.592 - 00:17:37.714, Speaker A: Who could imagine what a concept, right? Like in an apartment building, imagine that you actually knew the person who was like 30ft this way and 30ft that way, and they weren't like a total cipher or anonymous person to you. The crowdfunding of a territory around the world is like one of the apotheosis of the capacity for collective action because you're not just upvoting something at the same time. You're crowdfunding something and you're collectively moving there.
00:17:37.752 - 00:17:37.954, Speaker F: Okay?
00:17:37.992 - 00:18:25.502, Speaker A: And the last bit eventually gains diplomatic recognition of pre existing states. So just know Clayton Christensen had this term disruptive innovation, and that got taken by people and they used it in a way know he didn't want. He wanted disruptive innovation be like a low end innovation that comes in and then it kind of goes to the high end, but people just use it as like something that comes in and just wins or whatever, right. Necessarily, it's how words work. If you want the specific definition of a network state, it's one that has diplomatic recognition. By this definition, nothing is yet a network state in this definition. The reason I use that is you might say, why would some crypto person who's all independent, blah, blah, blah, why would you want diplomatic recognition? Well, I argue it's actually very similar to the reason that you want to be able to trade cryptocurrency for fiat currency.
00:18:25.502 - 00:18:27.074, Speaker A: It is almost exactly the same.
00:18:27.112 - 00:18:32.786, Speaker F: In fact, it is the cryptocurrency fiat country interface, okay?
00:18:32.888 - 00:18:35.874, Speaker A: Diplomatic recognition is you've generated these new.
00:18:35.912 - 00:18:38.838, Speaker F: Cryptocurrencies for the old system to sort.
00:18:38.844 - 00:18:49.178, Speaker A: Of acknowledge they're legitimate is diplomatic recognition. Once you have that, actually lots of things become possible, deals become possible, other things. But another way of thinking about it is I know it's a funny way of putting it, but I put it.
00:18:49.184 - 00:18:49.930, Speaker F: In the book this way.
00:18:50.000 - 00:18:52.646, Speaker A: Diplomatic recognition is a non binding commitment.
00:18:52.678 - 00:18:54.874, Speaker F: To not invade, okay?
00:18:54.992 - 00:19:01.566, Speaker A: For example, like the US diplomatically recognized Iraq. That's why I say it's a non binding commitment to not invade. It did invade, okay?
00:19:01.668 - 00:19:02.126, Speaker F: Right.
00:19:02.228 - 00:19:37.702, Speaker A: But it's an international incident. Like you go and quote, invade a sovereign country, russia invades Ukraine. It's an international incident, right? By contrast, if it's just a bunch of guys on sea, land, or liverland, which is not diplomatically recognized by anybody, that is not a sovereign, and no other government will care. It is not a diplomatic instant. It's a bunch of delusional people on a barge or whatever, right? So their diplomatic defense is actually very low. And it's not just about you and what army, it's about you and what diplomacy. It's you and what nation, right? You and what country backing you.
00:19:37.702 - 00:19:40.010, Speaker A: A lot of libertarian types get this wrong.
00:19:40.160 - 00:19:43.082, Speaker F: And so just to say the reason.
00:19:43.136 - 00:20:04.698, Speaker A: That this definition is long, that lengthy one is meant to sort of preemptively address many different kinds of failure modes, things that people have tried and failed, things that people will throw at you and be like, ha, you're so impractical, you didn't think of this, did you? And all these different things that folks will throw. That's why the definition, the second definition is long. Okay, go ahead, it's yours.
00:20:04.874 - 00:20:57.038, Speaker B: Let me try to push up against some of the boundaries in this kind of core thesis you have. Okay, so one of the things that you mentioned so I'll just pick pieces of the long version, right? So a network state of the social network, moral innovation, a sense of national consciousness, a recognized founder capacity for collective action, an integrated cryptocurrency, a consensual government limited by social smart contract, an in person level of civility. Yes, I'm jumping around, I'm jumping around. I think most crypto people, if you just take the description thus far, they will nod their heads and say, oh yeah, this sounds a lot like crypto. All these things are clicking in my head. And then you say an archipelago of crowdfunded physical territories. And this is one of the central concepts in the network state that differentiates it from a lot of the people who talk about the radical concepts within crypto that enable different kinds of governance and blah, blah, blah.
00:20:57.038 - 00:21:02.594, Speaker B: So I guess the first way to push up against this concept is why.
00:21:02.632 - 00:21:04.546, Speaker F: Is it not enough to have a.
00:21:04.568 - 00:21:22.166, Speaker B: Community that is large, potent, ideologically aligned, and is still potentially in a position to present to nation states or to a nation state as a voting bloc, as a very strongly aligned group of people? Why do you need to go know? If I compare, for example, the Democratic.
00:21:22.198 - 00:21:28.586, Speaker F: Party as an institution, which is very powerful compared to the Panama, one of.
00:21:28.608 - 00:21:42.542, Speaker B: Them seems much more powerful to me than the other. Although one of them is diplomatically recognized, has land, et cetera. So how do you think about that? Why do you think there's such an important state transition that you need diplomatic recognition and crowdsourced land?
00:21:42.676 - 00:22:08.066, Speaker A: Well, so the Democrat Party is an interesting example because it does control territory, arguably, right? It can repaint streets. There are blue governors and stuff. They can do executive orders. There's more contestation within the US. State capacity has declined in many ways, but there certainly are times when political parties can animate and control state, control territory and whatnot.
00:22:08.178 - 00:22:10.634, Speaker F: But picture is worth a thousand words.
00:22:10.672 - 00:22:20.974, Speaker A: And so if you zoom in on this, right, I intentionally did a few different things with this. Basically, it's black and white. It is a lo fi mockup. Well, there you go.
00:22:21.012 - 00:22:21.406, Speaker F: Great.
00:22:21.508 - 00:23:07.062, Speaker A: So this is basically what I call the census dashboard of a network state. Now, do you guys know, I mentioned this in the book, but maybe we're aware of it or not. Do you know the census is actually called out specifically as something to do in the US constitution? The post office is in the constitution, the census is in the constitution. The thing about this visual here is you're seeing lots of nodes around the world. They are connected together via the Internet, and their cumulative population and income in real estate is quite substantial. And here's the thing, you can now start benchmarking something like this versus what we typically think of as a state, right? You think of the population of a country, you think of its annual tax revenue, and you think of its physical footprint.
00:23:07.206 - 00:23:10.234, Speaker F: Even if it's a distributed state, I.
00:23:10.272 - 00:23:17.774, Speaker A: Might say a decentralized state, okay. It has still got many of the aspects of we think of as a state. And if you actually go to, for.
00:23:17.812 - 00:23:19.658, Speaker F: Example, the map of Indonesia.
00:23:19.834 - 00:23:28.722, Speaker B: So to be clear, Balaji, what you're picturing here is almost like the predecessor to a network state where right now you basically have the network. Yeah, this is a network archipelago without the physical land.
00:23:28.776 - 00:23:34.306, Speaker A: Yeah, this is network archipelago. Network archipelago, right. And just like an archipelago, like, is an island kind of thing.
00:23:34.408 - 00:23:34.722, Speaker F: Okay?
00:23:34.776 - 00:23:46.054, Speaker A: So this is a map of Southeast Asia, okay. And you can see there's individual, I mean, they're all blue or whatever, but if you zoom in, like Indonesia, for example, if you looked at it from.
00:23:46.092 - 00:23:48.966, Speaker F: Space without knowing where the ethnic groups.
00:23:48.998 - 00:24:07.790, Speaker A: Are, you would not be able to guess the boundaries of, like, look at Brunei or look Malaysia, like the boundaries of it. There's like national boundaries. You see that boundary on the large island in the middle there? Indonesia is like a bunch of little.
00:24:07.860 - 00:24:10.910, Speaker F: Pieces of land separated by ocean, right?
00:24:11.060 - 00:24:12.306, Speaker A: What if there were little pieces of.
00:24:12.328 - 00:24:16.942, Speaker F: Land separated by internet? That's the concept of the network archipelago.
00:24:17.086 - 00:24:29.862, Speaker B: But at that point, still, people are landowners in their respective states, but they don't have any monopoly over violence, which is one of the prototypical features of actually having a state.
00:24:29.916 - 00:24:30.470, Speaker A: Sure.
00:24:30.620 - 00:24:35.430, Speaker B: Everybody in the network archipelago is still subject to the laws of the country they're in.
00:24:35.580 - 00:24:40.358, Speaker F: They might have collective bargaining power as a group, much like, I would argue.
00:24:40.454 - 00:24:48.326, Speaker B: Like another kind of civil society institution. But it's a civil society institution that effectively is multinational.
00:24:48.438 - 00:24:48.870, Speaker F: Yeah.
00:24:48.960 - 00:25:55.694, Speaker A: So the thing is that basically, I think there's many, many levels you can get to. And I actually identify four waypoints, okay? So those are startup society, network union, network archipelago, network state, okay? Startup society is just you're just one person with a dream, okay? It's like Zuck sitting at the laptop cracking his knuckles. One person, but you have ambitions of something bigger, okay? A network union is the second step. That's a digital collective capable of collective action, right? It's like a highly disciplined Dow, for example, but it's actually something that thinks of itself just even saying that they've got a sense of national consciousness or this sense of collectiveness. They don't have to necessarily become a state, just like not every small business has to go public or what have you. Many of them, in fact, will just stay as network unions. Guilds would be like this many NFT communities you can think of as being like this, okay? I think many pre existing subreddits could eventually become network union like, and I think the interface will determine the kinds of things network union can do.
00:25:55.694 - 00:26:06.994, Speaker A: But it's collective action. With a treasury, you can at a minimum, think of it as a Facebook group with a cryptocurrency linked together, and it's like a serious online community. It doesn't just do upvotes and stuff. It does collective actions, it has money, et cetera.
00:26:07.042 - 00:26:10.422, Speaker F: Okay? So the network union is a huge.
00:26:10.476 - 00:27:00.662, Speaker A: Step above a simple Facebook group because you can do things together, right? You can find somebody a job, you can crowdfund their business, you can promote their new project, blah, blah, blah. All those things you can do, okay? Then step three, network archipelago. Now you're crowdfunding territory. And importantly, by the way, and I include examples of this in the book as you sort of go up the ladder here, there's some kinds of collective societies that you can do with a purely digital only approach, okay? For example, I mentioned like the cancel proof culture. If you say the problem with society, and everybody has a concept of the problem with society, I call this the one commandment. What your differentiation is from society at large. If your visual of the problem with society is people get canceled, if that's the single biggest problem in your view.
00:27:00.716 - 00:27:02.866, Speaker F: To solve, you could build a network.
00:27:02.898 - 00:27:42.686, Speaker A: Union that is, for example, a guild of, let's say it's graphic designers, okay? And this guild, 99% of the time, they're just sharing figma files, they're talking with each other, tricks of the trade, blah, blah. 1% of the time somebody there is getting hit online, they pop in, they invoke Article Five. An attack on one is an attack on all. That's a NATO kind of thing. I think it's article Five, right? Basically, they invoke that attack on one is an attack on all. And this beehive of all the designers comes out and it's posting memes, how dare you, silver menace some right. Like, this is a Roman citizen.
00:27:42.718 - 00:27:43.874, Speaker F: How dare you attack them?
00:27:43.992 - 00:28:06.458, Speaker A: And that's just a value proposition right there. The cancellation insurance, in a sense, is built into the community kind of spirit. You're a dues paying member of this guild. It will defend you. And there's probably also, by the way, some rule of law around this, right? When you come in or that person comes in and says they've been attacked, then there's some adjudication process. Did you strike first?
00:28:06.544 - 00:28:06.986, Speaker F: Right?
00:28:07.088 - 00:29:12.130, Speaker A: Was it like, you say some stupid slur for no reason, and blah, blah, blah, right? And you have actually some written law as to what the penalty is crucially, by the way. If somebody said a stupid slur, then maybe the penalty is okay, you have to go and give $100. It's not the ruination of their life forever and ever. And so you can figure out what the scale of it is if it's, like, 15 years ago and it's being brought to the present day as if it's this thing, right? So that community, that digital network union, starts to reestablish law, written law, as opposed to an emotional Lord of the Fly style reaction where everything is based on the passions of the mob at that time versus being like, okay, did they do X? Then I look at the law and it says, if X, then Y, we agreed on it in the abstract. It's rule of law, not just how much do we dislike or like this person at this time, right? That's what rule of law means. It means you take away the passions of the mob, and you actually put that into some kind of code, right? So a network union actually already can do a lot of interesting things, just a purely digital thing. But why do you need the physical? Well, there's a lot of things.
00:29:12.130 - 00:29:29.170, Speaker A: I mean, we're still physical creatures, right? So I mentioned, for example, Keto Kosher as one example, and I've got like, dozens, dozens of more examples. I mentioned Digital Sabbath just to go through a few. These Keto Kosher would be network union that decides we want to basically try to eliminate sugar from the diet.
00:29:29.250 - 00:29:29.686, Speaker F: You know what?
00:29:29.708 - 00:30:03.854, Speaker A: You can do all kinds of willpower type stuff, atomic habits type stuff online, but, you know, it's actually way easier. You just want to make one decision to move to a community, okay? And then the healthy living is just taken for care for you, right? You might have to actually, literally drive a few miles to get out of that community and go back into the den of iniquity where high fructose corn syrup is mixed with everything, okay? Once you actually have some physical boundaries in this example, have you guys seen the obesity GIF, by the way?
00:30:03.972 - 00:30:06.818, Speaker F: The obesity epidemic GIF? No. Okay.
00:30:06.904 - 00:30:17.620, Speaker A: Most people haven't actually seen this, I realize. And once you see this, you're like, okay, actually this is like a way more serious problem than people even realized. Okay, so here you go. Wait, ready?
00:30:17.930 - 00:30:29.850, Speaker D: One quick question. Actually, what you described actually reminds me a lot of how the freemasons sort of like if they were in the Internet, are you saying the freemasons would be sort of the network union?
00:30:30.190 - 00:30:31.946, Speaker A: I was actually going to say that.
00:30:31.968 - 00:30:35.340, Speaker E: The Catholic Church is probably the first network state.
00:30:36.990 - 00:31:15.720, Speaker C: I was actually going to ask. I remember the Keto Kosher thing from the book, and you sort of talk about the fact that the most successful early US. Colonies were the religious ones, not the ones that were founded for just purely merchantile reasons. I'm curious what you think the first network state is going to be. Because a lot of the stuff I agree there's a fan base around it, there's a community, but people are not so high affinity, so fervent about it, right. Versus maybe something like religion or your ethnicity, which tends to be kind of where nation states come from. What do you think is the thing that people are going to be so passionate about as to go through all this energy uproot their lives to start this thing?
00:31:16.670 - 00:31:30.282, Speaker A: So the reason I mentioned keto is it actually is a pretty big thing. I mean, like our keto, without looking, how many people do you think are in our keto? Like the reddit subreddit for keto.
00:31:30.346 - 00:31:31.102, Speaker B: 10 million.
00:31:31.236 - 00:31:34.430, Speaker F: 5,000,003.2 million. Okay. All right.
00:31:34.500 - 00:31:37.200, Speaker A: Order, magnitude, that's kind of a lot of people.
00:31:37.730 - 00:31:38.094, Speaker F: Yeah.
00:31:38.132 - 00:31:42.734, Speaker C: I mean, definitely popular, but the level of passion around is what I'm curious about.
00:31:42.772 - 00:31:42.926, Speaker F: Right?
00:31:42.948 - 00:31:44.382, Speaker C: Like Roblox is huge.
00:31:44.516 - 00:31:44.766, Speaker F: Yeah.
00:31:44.788 - 00:31:46.978, Speaker A: So I want to argue this point with you, actually.
00:31:47.064 - 00:31:50.738, Speaker F: So first of all, look at this GIF, right?
00:31:50.824 - 00:32:04.962, Speaker A: I don't know if you guys have ever seen this GIF. This is the fattening of America. And actually the camera ends in like 2013 where it's already like this creeping epidemic. And you know how much fatter people have gotten since then? It's like insane.
00:32:05.026 - 00:32:05.446, Speaker F: Okay?
00:32:05.548 - 00:32:38.654, Speaker A: People actually think this might be partially like a virus or some pathogen, just like ulcers were caused by H. Pylori as sort of a cryptic pathogen for a long time. And maybe that's contributing to obesity or something is where the diet is adding to it or it's palatable snack food, who knows? Point is, people are really getting fat in the US. And around the world. This is like a big thing and that's upstream of diabetes and that's upstream know COVID mortality and blah, blah, blah. All these know aesthetics. Of course, all those things are kind of just downstream of being a fatso.
00:32:38.702 - 00:32:38.914, Speaker F: Right?
00:32:38.952 - 00:32:45.546, Speaker A: And I know because I was a fatso just like a few years ago or whatever, like haseeb been hitting the gym or whatever recently.
00:32:45.598 - 00:32:46.200, Speaker F: Right.
00:32:46.970 - 00:32:56.754, Speaker A: My point is basically that something like keto is actually totalizing why every single meal you need to be keto, every single thing you put in your mouth has to be keto.
00:32:56.802 - 00:32:57.158, Speaker F: Right?
00:32:57.244 - 00:33:26.978, Speaker A: It is actually something which passes Sergey Brin's toothbrush test of you need to use it twice a day. Moreover, it's not just something you need to use twice a day. You need the community to support you, because unless you are hunting and gathering everything yourself, you have to spend enormous effort. Does this have sugar in it? Does this have sugar in it? What you'd like to do is get collective benefit and essentially enforce a boundary around that community where the snack wells are stopped at the door. Like those things are introduced. It's literally like border control. Customs takes care of it for you.
00:33:26.978 - 00:33:27.950, Speaker A: That's scalable.
00:33:28.030 - 00:33:28.418, Speaker F: Right?
00:33:28.504 - 00:33:42.434, Speaker A: So I actually picked that for a reason, because it's actually something where, if you think about a big part of religion on a practical daily basis, it's dietary prohibitions. You can't drink alcohol. Kosher itself is obviously a religious thing, and so on and so forth.
00:33:42.482 - 00:33:42.838, Speaker F: Right.
00:33:42.924 - 00:34:07.386, Speaker A: And crucially, if you look at religion, it's down into the right many forms of traditional religion. You know what's up into the right is the AR keto community. So all of those things kind of net into something like this, these kinds of Internet movements that I think would be totalizing. And then once you get that one commandment of sugar bad, keto good, you actually get derivations. You guys know what a CGM is? Continuous glucose monitor.
00:34:07.578 - 00:34:34.098, Speaker B: Yeah, my wife has one. So continuous glucose monitor is one of these patches, generally, that you put on your body, and I think it's like bluetooth. You just scan it, and then you can basically read your glucose levels throughout the day. So something generally the diabetics historically have used, but now increasingly healthy people are just like, I want to know my glucose levels all day long. And so you can import them into app. You can analyze them. And so people get obsessed, and it's.
00:34:34.114 - 00:34:35.570, Speaker E: Much better than pricking your finger.
00:34:35.650 - 00:34:36.086, Speaker A: That's right.
00:34:36.108 - 00:34:36.920, Speaker B: Many times.
00:34:37.290 - 00:34:55.946, Speaker A: That's exactly right. And so the key thing about this, the reason I think this is you know how there's saying I think it's Dixon saying, like, what nerds do on the weekend, everybody else will do in ten years, right? Nerds are working on tech people, Palm Pilots, and then ten years later, everybody had an iPhone. 20 years later, everybody in the world has a smartphone.
00:34:55.978 - 00:34:56.366, Speaker F: Right?
00:34:56.468 - 00:35:05.718, Speaker A: So the CGM is really important because we know more about what's going on on the other side of the world, in Budapest or in Bangalore, than what's going on in our own bodies.
00:35:05.834 - 00:35:06.402, Speaker F: Okay?
00:35:06.536 - 00:35:20.738, Speaker A: Like, all of this machine learning type stuff should be trained on the most important measurements. Like the dashboard that you should be looking at every time you get up in the morning is not some stupid news article on something of no consequence to you, but what are your readouts?
00:35:20.834 - 00:35:21.480, Speaker F: Right.
00:35:21.850 - 00:35:58.306, Speaker A: That's actually the news you can use. That's the most important stuff you care most about, that nobody else cares about that as much as you do, right? This is in the same way that your corporate dashboard this is a broader concept, but I think the morning newspaper is being replaced by the morning dashboard that's actually, like the news is the worst thing you should be looking at in the morning, because that's like what everybody else cares about. The dashboard is what you care about. You are driving. It is the dashboard in your companies. It's on portfolio. It's all the things which have leverage next to them, and the most important of which is your body, right? So the CGM, I think, is a piece of that, where it's taking metrics off of you and then it's putting them there, and now you're actually seeing it.
00:35:58.306 - 00:36:38.510, Speaker A: You're tracking it across time. Why do I mention this? Because it's downstream of that Keto premise, right? Once you say that carbs bad, then you get to CGM good. Then you get to everybody universal CGM good. Then you get to, oh, now we can collect stats across the community, and so on and so forth. And this is an example of how, like, a moral innovation, when it goes to 100%, a derivation from it goes to 100%, a derivation of derivation goes to 100%, and so on. And you start actually building the technology to fit that moral innovation, right? Rather than being idiosyncratic. If you actually go back into history, this is very common, the relationship between moral progress and technological progress.
00:36:38.510 - 00:36:47.566, Speaker A: For example, once you can say that the earth goes around the sun rather than vice versa, you can get better star charts and eventually you can get satellites.
00:36:47.598 - 00:36:47.986, Speaker F: Okay?
00:36:48.088 - 00:36:56.738, Speaker A: Once you can say that, oh, actually, man and monkeys have a common ancestor that opens up in the fullness of time, evolutionary genetics.
00:36:56.914 - 00:37:05.734, Speaker B: Speaking of moral progress, because I think that's also a very important vector in this book that we haven't talked about. Yes, the network state is partially about.
00:37:05.852 - 00:37:07.846, Speaker F: A prediction about the way in which.
00:37:07.868 - 00:37:41.858, Speaker B: The future will unfurl and the way that different kinds of states will emerge. But it's also advocacy in some sense. And so a big part of the book is devoted toward your I think the way Vitalik describes it is your megapolitics, which is the encapsulation is this tripartite chart you have of NYT CCP, BTC. Describe for us briefly, what is this, I don't know what you call it. The trilemma between Nytcc tripolar triangle. Tripolar triangle. And incorporate into that.
00:37:41.858 - 00:37:45.298, Speaker B: Why is it not just that the network states will exist, but why it.
00:37:45.304 - 00:37:47.090, Speaker F: Is good the network states will exist?
00:37:47.670 - 00:38:04.694, Speaker A: Just to put a bow on your previous thing, you asked why physical. Now I'll just go to this just to put a bow. You asked why physical. Certain kinds of societal innovations can only be implemented physically, and then certain more kinds can only be implemented if you have legal or diplomatic recognition. So that's why physical. So rather than remaining fully digital.
00:38:04.742 - 00:38:05.050, Speaker F: Okay?
00:38:05.120 - 00:38:38.402, Speaker A: To come to this, basically, as I mentioned at the beginning, I'm going to factor this a little bit more into problem and solution, right? And like the book meaning want to factor it like this, where the problem is the state of the world as I see it, is we are headed for what I call American anarchy and Chinese control. And by American anarchy what I think is going to happen and what I sort of foresee and I put a bunch of evidence in the book. This is one of the things where I want to do the next version where I have like 200 references and all kinds of graphs and charts on this particular thing.
00:38:38.456 - 00:38:38.722, Speaker F: Okay?
00:38:38.776 - 00:38:48.534, Speaker A: But if you just bear with me, I kind of think that so I have to be political here because it's just going to be I mentioned this book, you just talking about large, okay, humans. You have to be political, okay?
00:38:48.652 - 00:38:49.430, Speaker F: It's in the book.
00:38:49.500 - 00:39:06.926, Speaker A: So if you think about what happened with, let's say, Occupy Wall Street in the early 2010s, people might have thought that the big left movement was going to be economic, but that was actually kind of like a head fake and actually it turned out to be cultural with what people now call wokeness. It's cancellation me too, BLM, all this.
00:39:06.948 - 00:39:07.902, Speaker F: Type of stuff, okay?
00:39:08.036 - 00:39:31.954, Speaker A: And with the right, if you looked at the last several years, you might think that the big right movement was going to be like culturally nationalist and so on. I'm not saying that's zero, but I actually think that's going to be, in the fullness of time, a head fake and the true energy is going to be economic right in the sense of ultra bitcoin maximalism, crypto anarchy, et cetera.
00:39:32.002 - 00:39:32.358, Speaker F: Okay?
00:39:32.444 - 00:39:56.554, Speaker A: And the reason for this is that so that head fake of faking economic left and actually going cultural left, faking cultural right and actually going economic right, I think that's an important thing where that last step? Economic right? The way I sort of think about it is you can look in lots and lots of republican primary and so on, you start to see them signaling maximalism, right? Bitcoin maximalism.
00:39:56.682 - 00:39:57.214, Speaker F: Why?
00:39:57.332 - 00:40:28.374, Speaker A: Because if wokeness is sort of like ultra democracy, maximalism is like ultra capitalism in a sense. And then woke capital is like wokeness plus a form of capitalism. And bitcoin maximalism is like capitalism plus with the pleb thing. It's like a form of ultra democracy, right? So both of them are these weird just to explain what I mean, the wokeness is like it's supposed to appeal to large movements of people. Then it captures institutions that has huge amounts of money. So it's like this democracy plus capitalism fusion. Bitcoin maximalism obviously started with a new form of capital with bitcoin itself.
00:40:28.374 - 00:40:42.698, Speaker A: But now recently, with the whole sort of pleb ideology it is, people who are watching this may know what that is. But it's like essentially, though it's usually not very phrased, very explicitly, all who hold bitcoin are equal. And because bitcoin is the best, they.
00:40:42.704 - 00:40:45.038, Speaker F: Are better than all who do not hold bitcoin, right?
00:40:45.124 - 00:41:24.758, Speaker A: That's roughly the pleb ideology. You're not supposed to ask how much bitcoin somebody had, how early they were, all of that. Now you're born again when you buy BTC and you have even $100 and you yell at people online, you're a pleb, you're a maximalist, okay? Now the thing about this is if you go and look at it, people use terms like immaculate conception for talking about the blockchain. They call it the genesis block. Satoshi is sort of treated like this Jesus figure in the same way that people have talked about wokeness as being like a Christian influence type of thing. Tom Holland's talked about this, noah Smith, Yarbin was one of the know, actually, john McWhorter has a whole book on this. Blah, blah.
00:41:24.758 - 00:42:07.702, Speaker A: A lot of people have talked about that, where you have aspects of like original sin and we'll all be damned if we do this, the elect, these kinds of premises. There's aspects of Christianity that have gone to maximalism. You see people, for example, they tweet the scene of Jesus throwing the money changers out of the temple. Damn, shitcoiners, throw them out, right? And so bits and pieces of this sort of Christian eschatology have sort of split and made their ways into wokeness and maximalism. And the Republican party doesn't have that. The Democrat party actually those are both actually downstream of these forces, right? These are forces that are like a fusion of democracy and capitalism plus pieces of Christianity that are lying around. Christianity itself.
00:42:07.702 - 00:42:22.634, Speaker A: People don't believe in it anymore, but it's like they're saying the God shaped hole, right? The ruins of Christianity that are current western civilization. Those myths stay around and they still have some purchase on people and they get reanimated in these forms.
00:42:22.682 - 00:42:23.230, Speaker F: Okay?
00:42:23.380 - 00:43:00.198, Speaker A: And I do think that maximalist versus woke is going to be like the new communist versus Nazi, except this time it's the left that's racially obsessed and the right that's economically obsessed. And that conflict, communist versus Nazi was Stalingrad in the 20th century. That was the most insane conflict of the early 20th century. And you saw that building over years, decades, that was just a smash. And that kind of determined the outcome in many ways of World War II. That was like the climactic conflict, right? I do think something like that is coming. I don't know exactly what form that takes.
00:43:00.198 - 00:43:26.562, Speaker A: I do think these are the two forces. I think it probably happens sometime around the time the US government is basically broke and has printed the money and it's coming for people's money. And so it's the conflict between the totally unstoppable force of the US government and the irresistible object of bitcoin and maximalism. And I can sort of see that coming like that's this sort of god or damarung, this ragnarok, this armageddon, whatever you want to call it. I do see that coming.
00:43:26.696 - 00:43:40.674, Speaker B: So it sounds like sure. So you're framing the power of basically bitcoin maximalism. I know that you are not a bitcoin maximalist and I don't think you're particularly sympathetic to bitcoin maximalism. What is the middle way that you are advocating?
00:43:40.722 - 00:43:44.360, Speaker F: That is not either of these polls, right?
00:43:46.570 - 00:44:17.794, Speaker A: I think of there as being three polls, right? So this is like a fourth. So the thing is that quote as a person of color and so there's aspects of wokeness that of course you want equal treatment under the law. That's why it's actually a very complicated thing to discuss it because there's a whole continuum of folks who have good intentions all the way over here, right? And then it gets to this insane point of just all the stuff we see online. But there's a kernel of like, yeah, of course you want equal treatment under the law.
00:44:17.832 - 00:44:18.174, Speaker F: Duh.
00:44:18.222 - 00:44:40.134, Speaker A: Right? That's just common sense and civil liberties and so on and so forth. But it gets distorted and inverted on the end over here into something that's like there's a huge difference between, for example, an economic progressive and a communist, between a conservative and a Nazi, between a liberal and a woke and between a libertarian and a maximalist.
00:44:40.182 - 00:44:40.730, Speaker F: Right?
00:44:40.880 - 00:45:07.138, Speaker A: Once you get to that corner, things that were previously premises like tolerance, for example, get inverted and turned into intolerance right. Or you go like in the libertarian corner and non aggression principle everybody can transact. Oh, actually, let's sick the SEC on these quote pointers or whatever, right? It starts to be something where the ideology gets curled and distorted on, you know, what people have talked about is so called horseshoe theory, you know, the.
00:45:07.144 - 00:45:14.222, Speaker E: Political compass and biology because this is a crypto show. Try to point out the overlap of the political compass and crypto.
00:45:14.286 - 00:45:18.214, Speaker B: Well, we are now a crypto politics crossover show, just so you know.
00:45:18.332 - 00:45:24.998, Speaker A: Well, that's the thing is the problem is you may not be interested in politics, but politics is interested in you.
00:45:25.084 - 00:45:25.880, Speaker B: Very true.
00:45:26.590 - 00:45:47.306, Speaker A: And I think it's Lenin saying, right? So this is the political Compass and there is a post here that she thought was actually pretty good, very roughly speaking. Top left communist, top right Nazi or nationalist or really you actually could argue top middle is Nazi, top right is like pinocchio.
00:45:47.338 - 00:45:47.486, Speaker F: Okay?
00:45:47.508 - 00:46:13.442, Speaker A: But let's say top left communist, top middle Nazi, top right like a pinocchet, bottom left woke, bottom right crypto, anarchist or maximalist. I'm talking about the corners, by the way, not the center, the very corners, okay? And what you kind of get is you have pathologies that when you push each to the corner, you get a pathology. For example, top right. Take for example, slavery. The top right slavery is slavery. Top left communism is slavery.
00:46:13.506 - 00:46:13.926, Speaker F: Okay?
00:46:14.028 - 00:46:18.066, Speaker A: Lower left drug addiction is slavery. Lower right debt is slavery.
00:46:18.178 - 00:46:18.550, Speaker F: Okay?
00:46:18.620 - 00:46:39.626, Speaker A: You can actually have bad versions of things where there's, like, drug addiction. You're no longer yourself. You're kind of enslaved to this drug dealer or what have you. When you go into the total liberty of the lower left, you can actually end up in a bad place. When you go to the, quote, communism, the workers paradise of the upper left. Well, the gulag, the White Sea, labor.
00:46:39.658 - 00:46:42.106, Speaker F: Canal, that wasn't the workers paradise.
00:46:42.138 - 00:47:06.194, Speaker A: They weren't getting any days off. Okay, so communism ends with slavery and of course, debt. You can do voluntary economic interactions between people and end up in something that's very similar to, like, debt slavery, right? And then, of course, the top right is the obvious one point is that there's, like, pathological cases where if you take some principle to its extremes, you end up in this anti human bad spot. You go off the map, right? And one thing that people have conceptualized.
00:47:06.242 - 00:47:08.854, Speaker F: A lot top left communist, top right.
00:47:08.892 - 00:47:23.454, Speaker A: Nazi, and then people will say, okay, those loop together and they become the same thing. And in fact, there's this great movie called The Soviet Story, which actually shows lots of communist and, you know, like posters and how they actually really resembled each other.
00:47:23.492 - 00:47:23.742, Speaker F: Why?
00:47:23.796 - 00:47:48.062, Speaker A: Because they were actually recruiting from the same population. Hitler's whole thing was that he wasn't just a nationalist, he was a National Socialist. He had, like, crossover appeal and tried to pull some of the disaffected, know, the National Socialist German Workers Party, he devoted two of the four words to that. And the know under Stalin went to Soviet nationalism. They appealed to the right. And they weren't just communists. They were like a fusion of leftism and rightism.
00:47:48.126 - 00:47:48.450, Speaker F: Okay?
00:47:48.520 - 00:47:55.686, Speaker A: So their propaganda, posters, all this type of stuff looked very similar. And so that's why people talk about so called horseshoe theory, where the far left and far right become the same.
00:47:55.788 - 00:47:57.498, Speaker F: But there are new things in the.
00:47:57.504 - 00:48:18.494, Speaker A: World and we're so vaccinated against, especially Nazism and fascism, but also communism to some extent. That what happens is you get a push in the other direction, right? It's like the Gerardian founding murder. You've got these total black holes that nobody wants to be a Nazi or a communist. And so well, those are bad. So what's good?
00:48:18.532 - 00:48:20.382, Speaker F: The total opposite of that, right?
00:48:20.436 - 00:48:31.614, Speaker A: The lower left corner is good. It's antifa because it's not fascist. And the lower right corner, you're probably seeing more and more folks call themselves, like, communism disrespecter or something like that on Twitter.
00:48:31.662 - 00:48:31.922, Speaker F: Why?
00:48:31.976 - 00:48:47.030, Speaker A: Because who would be a communist? Even the lower left, some of them will actually put a hammer in sickle, but most of them don't really, really endorse the gulag. Okay, so now what happens? There's actually a different kind of crossover, and that is not totalitarianism. It is anarchy.
00:48:47.530 - 00:48:48.038, Speaker F: Okay?
00:48:48.124 - 00:48:50.538, Speaker A: The lower left and lower right, where do they cross over.
00:48:50.624 - 00:48:53.206, Speaker F: Well, the woke says everyone is equal.
00:48:53.238 - 00:48:56.406, Speaker A: We are all equal. And the maximalists will say, you ain't.
00:48:56.438 - 00:48:57.402, Speaker F: The boss of me.
00:48:57.536 - 00:49:11.006, Speaker A: And you put those together. And even though those vectors, they've obviously got a left and a right flavor to them, vectors can cancel on some axes and some on other axes. And so these ideological vectors, while they cancel in some ways, they sum on.
00:49:11.028 - 00:49:13.090, Speaker F: One axis and that axis is anarchy.
00:49:13.590 - 00:49:38.714, Speaker A: It is the absence of legitimate leaders, it is the absence of legitimate hierarchies. America is both institutionally racist and it's irredeemably leftist, right? It's the deep state and it is the racist state, blah, blah, blah. And so you sum that up and what people can, quote, shake hands on is the complete illegitimacy of all institutions. And that leads you to American anarchy. That's the energy that I see, unfortunately. Okay, let me pause there.
00:49:38.752 - 00:49:39.498, Speaker F: Go ahead.
00:49:39.664 - 00:50:06.146, Speaker B: Okay, actually it's a good time to pause because we are running up on time and there is more that I want to talk let's, let's take that as a broad preview of the book. I would strongly recommend whether or not you agree with the vision that Balaji presents. It's one that you need to grapple with, especially if you're in this industry. So Balaji, what is the best way for people to find, read, consume the network state and what's coming up for the book?
00:50:06.248 - 00:50:06.658, Speaker F: Sure.
00:50:06.744 - 00:50:27.174, Speaker A: So find, read, Consume, go to thenetworkstate.com go and subscribe there. You will get notified as new versions and stuff come out. Or you can just go and refresh the site. We're going to do a hardcover, going to do an audible. I may be wrong on all of my stuff, by the way. Of course I could be wrong.
00:50:27.174 - 00:50:48.538, Speaker A: And one of the things I actually want to point out, take pains to point out is you do not need to agree with me on all or even most or any of this. You don't need to agree with me on problem, to agree on solution. For example, with, like, I think of network states and startup societies as a response to the chaos I see coming in America and the crackdown I see coming in China.
00:50:48.634 - 00:50:49.038, Speaker F: Okay?
00:50:49.124 - 00:50:54.402, Speaker A: I see both of these as bad things that are coming that will justify themselves with reference to each other.
00:50:54.536 - 00:50:55.220, Speaker F: Okay?
00:50:55.750 - 00:51:47.226, Speaker A: The disorder of America will be justified with, well, at least we aren't China. And China's massive digital totalitarianism crackdown that I see coming, which is, I mean, obvious, but it's actually becoming something where people are actually leaving China now because of it, right? That crackdown is something that will be justified as well. At least we aren't anarchic. Like where America is. Okay, that's a really terrible vice to be put in where that's the assumed you must be A or B. And so that other option know what is the other option? The decentralized center, right? People who actually group together with others of like mind where you can't just listen to a politician and just buy into what they're saying because their campaign promises are non binding, a startup society or network state. You can see how those campaign promises manifest in reality.
00:51:47.226 - 00:51:55.998, Speaker A: You can tour it, you can go there, you can see if it's Amenable, if it's worth a subscription, and if you don't like it, you can leave. And so it's disciplined by exit and by Pragmatism.
00:51:56.094 - 00:51:56.642, Speaker F: Okay.
00:51:56.776 - 00:52:19.898, Speaker A: And that, I think, is people becoming the change they want to see because people will disagree with this anarchy and control thing in many different and incompatible ways. But we can basically embrace what I think of as polystatism, not just polyneumism or polytheism. Okay, so answer is go to thenetworkstate.com get that. We will have an audible, we'll have a hardcover, we'll have more stuff all free.
00:52:19.984 - 00:52:20.714, Speaker F: Go check it out.
00:52:20.752 - 00:52:42.626, Speaker A: Oh, by the way, it is despite giving it away all free. Do you see my tweet on this where it's a Wall Street Journal bestseller even despite giving it away all free. I laughed when I saw that because I hadn't actually checked. And the NYT bestseller list, by the way, is fake. Did you guys know that the NYT bestseller list is fake? It's editorial content. The Wall Street Journal one is actually the one that's based on actual stats anyway, go ahead.
00:52:42.728 - 00:52:50.630, Speaker B: Okay, good to so, okay, we are technically a crypto show, and so I want to try to bring it back to crypto in the end.
00:52:50.700 - 00:52:53.894, Speaker F: So you are well known as being.
00:52:53.932 - 00:53:37.086, Speaker B: One of the, let's say one of the elder statesmen of the crypto community. Well, it's been a very interesting four years. You've been through an entire cycle now, and you've seen we've all seen an enormous amount of folly, a lot of irrational exuberance that has kind of fallen back to reality, but also a lot of experiments around governance, some in the spirit of some of the radical ideas that you describe in the Network State, and most of them have not succeeded. Even things like prediction markets, even things like the idea of creating coins that represent some kind of claim over some smaller group or some smaller nation, those have largely failed to hold root or really become big phenomena.
00:53:37.198 - 00:53:40.038, Speaker F: Where do you think people have gone wrong so far?
00:53:40.204 - 00:53:43.350, Speaker B: It seems that most of the things that have worked in crypto are basically.
00:53:43.420 - 00:53:46.214, Speaker F: Layer ones, very simple, DeFi, kind of.
00:53:46.252 - 00:54:02.666, Speaker B: Some of the stuff that you said early on, it's like, look, I like that it's there. It's not really my thing. That seems to be most of what's worked and then NFTs and gaming, this kind of stuff that's less about political organization and more about people just speculating, having fun, buying things that are cool. Why do you think that is?
00:54:02.688 - 00:54:04.320, Speaker F: And where do you think people have gone wrong?
00:54:04.770 - 00:54:08.846, Speaker B: What would be your recommendation to somebody who's hearing this message and says, okay.
00:54:08.868 - 00:54:09.790, Speaker F: I want to do better.
00:54:09.940 - 00:54:28.146, Speaker A: Let me talk about something that we've talked about ten years ago, even before crypto was even a thing, before we were through any public cycles or whatever, okay? There's an Amazon link that I put there. All viewers of this podcast should go and get this book and at least browse this, okay? It's an academic book by Carlota Perez.
00:54:28.178 - 00:54:32.966, Speaker F: Technological Revolutions and financial you this will.
00:54:32.988 - 00:55:32.474, Speaker A: Give you a different perspective because it goes through the past and it shows that almost every single whether you think about railroads, other aspects of the industrial revolution, there's like this very common thing. It looks like the gardener hype cycle, okay? It's almost like the way that humans innovate, okay? Technology trigger huge excitement, financial spike, all kinds of money goes in crash because most of those projects can't live up to where they're speculated to be and natural selection events. And then out of that rubble come like one Amazon and one Google and one Facebook or something like that that pay for all of the other stuff plus more. For example, the.com bubble is one that people know existed, but some of the folks here were around for that. I was pretty young at that time, but the.com bubble was like this.
00:55:32.474 - 00:55:56.578, Speaker A: It was bigger, arguably. I don't know if you actually look at the numbers in terms of relative percentage, but there was a site called Fuckedcompany.com that just documented all the stuff and everything was obviously moronic. Think about webvan. Ha ha, how stupid that was. There was this know people made fun of it. Lol you're going to get your groceries delivered at home? Cosmo oh yeah, you're going to just click a button and get something delivered to you in a big city.
00:55:56.578 - 00:56:24.538, Speaker A: How about the QCAT that was completely moronic that you were going to scan a barcode. No normal human being would ever do that. Of course, ten or 20 years later, we have Instacart and we have Uber Eats, and we have lots of QR code scanning stuff. But you needed a whole technology build out to get there. Almost every stupid concept during web 1.0 during that.com boom did eventually work five or ten or 15 or 20 years later.
00:56:24.538 - 00:56:59.606, Speaker A: But the only ones that survived and they did so with great resourcefulness were those that sort of were able to deal with this bandwidth constraint and suddenly capital constrained environment. Amazon, Yahoo, Google, it only accepted search queries and returned back. Blue know, Netflix did not allow streaming at that time. All those things were built for that environment and they managed to make it through the meteor event, okay? And so whether it's a.com bubble, whether it's railroads, this is just kind of how this stuff happens. And if you have the long lens on history, you're like, okay, I'm dispassionate about this now. I understand this is coming.
00:56:59.606 - 00:57:26.206, Speaker A: I have my emotions out of it and I know there will be a natural selection event. And let me just pick the winners that come out of this. Let me pause there then I can say, I do think there are some winners. By that, I would disagree with you that everything is not working. I think ENS is a huge hit, and that's being kind of quietly working. And that's a very important piece of infrastructure that's going to come. There's an article that we wrote, or actually that John Stokes wrote called The Billion User Table that's at thenetworkstate.com
00:57:26.206 - 00:57:51.622, Speaker A: that I think is good on that. I think all this DFI infrastructure, the composability, even if it was used for financial speculation, much like during the first dot bubble. During the first bubble, for example, eyeballs that was totally moronic. Obviously in retrospect, in the mid early 2000s, everybody knew eyeballs had been discredited, okay? Eyeballs are just meaning attention to your site. Obviously eyeballs aren't money.
00:57:51.676 - 00:57:52.374, Speaker F: Ha ha.
00:57:52.492 - 00:58:25.746, Speaker A: Stupid didn't have the epithet of tech bro or whatever then, but they would have used it like, these.com idiots are so stupid, blah blah. But do you know how eyeballs actually became valuable is once people realized it wasn't the same as just offline ads, where you show the same ad to everybody, but you had targeted ads, personalized ads, the entire Google machine that came out in 2004, it was like, oh, my God, I can't believe you can make so much money on the Internet. Even in 2002. You know, the New York Times Salzburger's disinformation agency ran about Google in 2002. You know what they printed? They said, Google's toughest searches for a business model.
00:58:25.848 - 00:58:26.498, Speaker F: Okay?
00:58:26.664 - 00:58:57.210, Speaker A: Now, they were still pattern matching all of the dot coms failing onto Google at that time. Google's toughest searches for a business model. And this was like the Sun Tzu thing where when you're strong, appear weak, and when you're weak, appear strong. Google wanted to appear weak because they didn't want Microsoft to hit them, okay? So they intentionally were like, oh yeah, we just got to figure out how to make money initiative later in their S one in 2004, when they were forced to disclose, they're making something like three Hyundai, four Hyundai just that year alone, okay? Google was just destroying it even in 2002. So their search wasn't for a business model.
00:58:57.280 - 00:58:58.346, Speaker F: Not at all. Right?
00:58:58.448 - 00:59:09.114, Speaker A: Point is, it took a long time for people to have the perceptions catching up with reality. Even in 2013, all right, there was an article that was published saying facebook.
00:59:09.162 - 00:59:11.918, Speaker F: Will never make a significant profit, okay?
00:59:12.004 - 00:59:28.760, Speaker A: 2013. And then what happens is it goes from, this will never work. All you guys are stupid and delusional. You're all losing money, et cetera. And there's like a tiny, tiny but where the messaging has to kind of pause and stop and then do you know what it's going to become?
00:59:29.370 - 00:59:32.822, Speaker F: Threat to democracy. Okay?
00:59:32.956 - 00:59:37.398, Speaker A: The next cycle is when crypto becomes a threat to democracy, quote, unquote in.
00:59:37.484 - 00:59:43.978, Speaker F: The distortion because it'll all work. Okay, we are up on time, but.
00:59:43.984 - 00:59:55.978, Speaker B: I want to ask you one final question to close this out. So today we have startup states. We don't yet have network archipelagos, we don't yet have network states. What is your over under median date? We see the first network archipelago.
00:59:55.994 - 00:59:57.680, Speaker F: And when do we see the first network state?
00:59:58.450 - 01:00:42.486, Speaker A: Arguably, you've got things that are pieces near this. I don't want to give a time frame. And the reason I don't well, let me put it like this, okay? I will give one kind of time frame, which is let's call it a goal but not a prediction, right? Because if you go to thenetworkstate.com Dashboard, well, so if you go to thenetworkstate.com Dashboard, this is like a tracker of startup societies and we actually have 23 of them that we're seeing already, okay? And they've actually raised a fair amount of venture capital collectively. It's about 180,000,000, 200 million collectively, which is more than people think, right? This space is happening. It is like crypto in 2013 from a venture capital standpoint in terms of how much has gone in.
01:00:42.528 - 01:00:43.118, Speaker F: Okay?
01:00:43.284 - 01:00:51.902, Speaker A: And so can we get from 20 something struct societies to 1000? I think we can. It's actually harder to go from zero to one than from 20 to 1000.
01:00:51.956 - 01:00:52.174, Speaker F: Right?
01:00:52.212 - 01:00:59.134, Speaker A: Like, we have to prove out the business model. Each of these have a very simple business model in theory, which is society.
01:00:59.182 - 01:01:00.610, Speaker F: As a service, right?
01:01:00.680 - 01:01:35.514, Speaker A: You just pay and you have a membership, right? That's a very well understood business model. It's like SaaS, okay? Arr, et cetera. And if that works, if we can get from 20 to 1000 sharp societies and so on over the next decade, I do think that if we can get to 1000 startup societies, we might be able to get the first diplomatically recognized network state in like ten years or so. But that's a goal, right? It's not a prediction. It's a goal just to give you some precedence for that. Why is that not completely crazy? Well, think about the TV and Co domains. Those are deals with Tuvalu and Columbia respectively.
01:01:35.514 - 01:01:38.462, Speaker A: Sovereigns do domain deals. They get hard cash for it.
01:01:38.516 - 01:01:39.166, Speaker F: Okay?
01:01:39.348 - 01:02:08.950, Speaker A: Look at the Wyoming dow law. That's effectively an interface between a sovereign and the ethereum network. Look at the El Salvador bitcoin law. Or the Central African Republic, that's an interface between a sovereign and the Bitcoin network, right? Between Wyoming and the ethereum network, between El Salvador and the Bitcoin network. So we have precedents for states sovereigns interacting with companies with currencies. Look at Nevada and Tesla's geiger factory. Look at Amazon HQ two.
01:02:09.020 - 01:02:09.458, Speaker F: Right?
01:02:09.564 - 01:02:40.974, Speaker A: We have started to see sovereigns ponying up to the negotiating table and doing deals because more and more individuals, more and more small groups are getting comparable to sovereigns, right? The level of power inequality in the world has actually been dropping the level of individual ability to accumulate capital has been rising and this is actually Back to the Future. The mid 20th century was actually aberrant in this fashion. So answer is, if we can get to a thousand subsidies, I think we can get a network state. And that's a goal.
01:02:41.022 - 01:02:43.410, Speaker F: It's a funnel, but let's see what happens.
01:02:43.560 - 01:03:02.342, Speaker E: So to close it out, balaji, we have the chopping block challenge for you. Are you ready for this? In exactly six words or less, tell us your favorite crypto asset and your least favorite crypto asset. You only have six words. You can think on it for a few seconds.
01:03:02.486 - 01:03:04.458, Speaker A: Bitcoin ethereum, 50 50.
01:03:04.624 - 01:03:05.766, Speaker F: Wait, which one's your favorite?
01:03:05.798 - 01:03:07.130, Speaker B: Which one's your least favorite?
01:03:08.510 - 01:03:10.320, Speaker F: Oh, that's what I just said, 50 50.
01:03:11.810 - 01:03:16.698, Speaker B: So you're splitting down the middle between bitcoin and each being your favorite?
01:03:16.874 - 01:03:30.750, Speaker A: No, what I mean is basically, like, so not financial advice, right? Like goes without saying, not financial advice, et cetera, but if gun to my head, someone is like, okay, what portfolio?
01:03:30.830 - 01:03:33.726, Speaker F: Blah blah, I'm like 50 50 bitcoin.
01:03:33.758 - 01:04:07.550, Speaker A: Ethereum is like it's not a bad bet. Okay, why? Because both those have massive communities. They're not going away. They have serious use cases. I think both Immutability and Programmability are obviously valuable, but they're also obviously difficult to have in the same chain. They're like, I don't know, the Twitter and Facebook of the space, the Microsoft and Apple of the space, whatever those are. There there's tons of other really great coins and stuff, whatever I could talk about, but I actually don't this thing is I am pro the space as a whole.
01:04:07.550 - 01:04:25.490, Speaker A: If you guys notice, I'm not like a crypto tribalist on Twitter or what have you. I'm pro the space as a whole. I'm pro individual founders and I'm pro entrepreneurs and I'm pro developers and engineers and individuals around the world who are using these platforms. And so I kind of don't want to quote, pick favorites or whatever.
01:04:25.560 - 01:04:25.890, Speaker F: Right?
01:04:25.960 - 01:04:38.566, Speaker A: And I also don't want people to be like, oh, my God, biology said to get this coin, blah blah, and it's now down 80%. Look, there's zero point in doing that. Could you possibly do better than that?
01:04:38.588 - 01:04:39.062, Speaker F: 50 50?
01:04:39.116 - 01:04:45.180, Speaker A: I think you absolutely could do. I think that's probably, like, a pretty good safe portfolio. I think so.
01:04:45.710 - 01:05:00.346, Speaker B: Well, baldur, we do have to wrap. That did not sound at all like investment advice, so thanks for sharing that with our listeners. At the end of the day, although I know that you're a controversial figure, I know some people love you, some people hate you. You're clearly one of the most, I.
01:05:00.368 - 01:05:02.740, Speaker A: Believe in the former category, I believe.
01:05:03.270 - 01:05:13.006, Speaker B: I haven't taken a tally, but I assume so. We thank you very much for coming on and anybody go read the network state. It's an important book. Thank you, Balaji, as always, for sharing your wisdom.
01:05:13.198 - 01:05:14.258, Speaker A: Thanks, everybody.
01:05:14.424 - 01:05:16.880, Speaker B: All right, that's a wrap. See you guys.
