00:03:17.310 - 00:03:36.146, Speaker A: Today's guests are Christophe Yensch, lefteris Carapetzis, and Griff Green, all formerly involved with Flocket and the Dow, which takes up two months of Ethereum's history and yet is about a full third of my book. Welcome Christophe, Levteris and griff thank you.
00:03:36.168 - 00:03:37.298, Speaker C: Hey, thanks for having us.
00:03:37.384 - 00:03:38.290, Speaker D: Hey, thanks.
00:03:38.440 - 00:04:11.294, Speaker A: So we are going to discuss what is easily the biggest event in the book and, in my opinion, in Ethereum's history, and that is the Dao attack on Ethereum and the Dao in general. And we will try to do our best not to give too many spoilers and stick to kind of more publicly known information. But for those of you who find this episode interesting, you should definitely check out my book, The Cryptopians, which came out last week. So first, let's start with each of you saying, thanks, Griff. Yes. Oh, yes. I also have my cut.
00:04:11.332 - 00:04:11.630, Speaker C: Yes.
00:04:11.700 - 00:04:37.620, Speaker A: Why don't we do an ad right now? So let's each of us go, or each of you go around and say what your involvement had been in Ethereum and what your involvement was in the Dow at the time that this event starts, which is kind of like late 2015, early 2016. And why don't we start with you, Christophe, because I think you're really the origin.
00:04:38.310 - 00:05:06.602, Speaker E: Well, the origin is the idea of the Dow was older than me. I mean, this is coming. Bitcoin is a dow in itself. Ethereum wrote a white paper, so maybe starting with the white paper by Vita League, which is like a prophecy, because most of it actually got fulfilled. So I read this in, I think, beginning 2014, I was doing my PhD in theoretical physics. I got totally sucked into it. And after the crowd sale, I started in the group with Kevin Wood and C team writing tests.
00:05:06.602 - 00:05:50.502, Speaker E: So I was full time on working with the Ethereum foundation, working actually closely with Jeffrey Wilker, Gavin Wood, and Vitaek. Buterin because they were both the heads of their clients, python Go and C and I would write tests that they always would sync with each other, always be true to the protocol, the protocol itself, written by Gavin in the yellow paper. That's why, per default, he was kind of right. And the other ones needed to check that they were also doing the right thing. So working for the foundation one and a half years and then leaving end of 2015 with my co founders, then my brother Simon Yench and Stefan Tor, we started Slocket. Long story short, we wanted to build, like, a decent sized sharing economy. We called it universal sharing network.
00:05:50.502 - 00:06:18.450, Speaker E: I actually think crypt came up with this term, I guess, or this was also the time crypt joined, like, beginning 2016, end of 2015. So then the idea, of course, was to do fundraising. We didn't want to go with VCs because we wanted to build a decentralized universal sharing network. We want to have lots of people access to it. And back then even token sales were pretty rare and new. There was, I think Auger did one pretty early. We had of course, the Ethereum crowd sale itself.
00:06:18.450 - 00:06:47.150, Speaker E: So we thought the best thing would be to raise from the community. But now with Ethereum being launched and we know the tech, we could do much better. So we said instead of just doing a simple token sale, let's give them more voting power. And then basically it evolved to let's just have the power over the money. We keep the money in the smart contract until we said let's do a full blown Dow, like fully decentralized, as it should be, with no compromises. This actually happened in the week of Defcon One. This decision was made one day before the talk.
00:06:47.150 - 00:07:07.842, Speaker E: So I changed my slides and then presented it. We got a lot of traction, a lot of interest. So I wrote the paper about the Dao, meaning how it should work, the smart contract, the first version. Then we got more people joining it. Since it was an open source project. Thefteris joined the company. Some people had some open source contribution, but not too many.
00:07:07.842 - 00:07:36.062, Speaker E: Then we got like the audit, we coded it. We don't want to get into all the details, but we know we launched. Not exactly relaunched, if you describe it in the book, how it happened, I committed the last commit and then made it public under version 1.0. This was like officially the last step from Slocket. Of course we were very involved in this lack community and hoped that people would launch it as they did. Got launched. You read in the book it raised lots of money, about $150,000,000.
00:07:36.062 - 00:07:41.614, Speaker E: Then the price of Ether went up at some point. It close to $250,000,000, but okay, now.
00:07:41.652 - 00:07:53.170, Speaker A: We'Re going too far in the future. No, it's okay. I think it's left Terrace next. Who joined? Do you want to go left Terrace?
00:07:53.670 - 00:08:46.062, Speaker D: I joined Ethereum back in 2014 along with Christian and worked on the Solidity team writing the Solidity compiler and the C plus plus client. I was hired by Iron Buchanan and I was working under Gavin and just worked on there until the launch of Ethereum. And right after DevCon One spared the book also we all were let go of our positions. And then I knew Christoph who was also working with us and he told me about this really cool new startup Slocket. And I had seen also the DevCon one presentation. I was like, Why not? That sounds like a cool thing to do. And joined Slocket in beginning of 2016 or end of 15, like somewhere there, I don't remember exactly where.
00:08:46.062 - 00:09:11.242, Speaker D: And then yeah, worked there. I actually find the coolest stuff that we did was before the like it's not mentioned at all, but we did all this universal setting planning, the Ethereum computer we were trying to create and went with Simon. So Christopher's brother and co founder of Slockit, and Stefan, of course, like to Barcelona.
00:09:11.306 - 00:09:12.522, Speaker C: Snappy. Ubuntu.
00:09:12.666 - 00:09:13.946, Speaker D: MWC.
00:09:14.138 - 00:09:15.840, Speaker E: Yes, the conference in.
00:09:19.090 - 00:10:05.310, Speaker D: Yeah, and there we got the Ubuntu guys all really excited about stuff and it was really cool. And there was no Dow mention almost at all there. We were just talking about the actual Ethereum computer that we wanted to create. So IoT devices that are well, controlling physical things and everything happens through the blockchain. Yeah, but then funding came up and then it was the Dow that traumatic experiences here. The moment I think about it, I stammer. But no, it was like as also presented in the DevCon One presentation, like wanted to get funding from the community, not from VCs.
00:10:05.310 - 00:10:15.170, Speaker D: So we started working on the Dao. And yeah, that's probably already towards the end of my involvement at Slogit. I don't need to go to the hack.
00:10:15.990 - 00:10:31.750, Speaker A: No, no, wait. There was one thing I felt that I wanted to mean. Christophe was saying that he thought that they had decided to do the Dow right before Defcon. But you're saying that you guys almost got the VC funding at the Mobile World Congress.
00:10:32.170 - 00:10:50.330, Speaker E: There was no funding there. The Dow was at least known in DevCon One. That's when I basically announced people do this. But we went, of course, to conferences is not for VC money. Just like to get the Ethereum computer, this IoT device, out to get people excited about connecting IoT devices to the blockchain. This is what Left Terrace did. There Ubuntu fault.
00:10:50.830 - 00:10:51.242, Speaker A: Okay.
00:10:51.296 - 00:10:51.466, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:10:51.488 - 00:11:33.020, Speaker D: So there were many people who really excited about the actual thing that we wanted to build. So the Dao was just a mechanism to get funding in a more cipher Funk way rather than just going the old VC way. But the thing that we wanted to build was completely different. And this is also why Christoph and Slokit appealed to me, because we were talking a lot also while we were working together about IoT, I was very much into low level stuff back then. And yeah, I really liked the idea and I got really excited and I thought that this Dao thing is just a distraction from what we actually wanted to do.
00:11:34.030 - 00:11:36.170, Speaker A: Okay, and Griff, what about you?
00:11:36.320 - 00:12:27.530, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, like they're saying we were a sharing economy company, so I came in way. I didn't know much about Ethereum beforehand. I actually had been in crypto for a while, but had heard Ethereum was vaporware and just didn't really think much of it. But then I was getting a master's degree, actually the first master's degree ever or any degree ever in digital currencies, which I collected a week after the Dow hack. It's kind of funny, but for my interest in crypto, I was really excited about Dows specifically interlacing with the sharing economy. And I wrote a white paper for one of my classes about a bike sharing economy and then I just was googling like sharing economy crypto or bitcoin probably at that time sharing economy bitcoin and slacket came up and it's like they're using Ethereum. That's crazy.
00:12:27.530 - 00:13:17.834, Speaker C: Whatever. But I'll DM them and I think I sent I don't know how many emails I sent to Christophe but many and thankfully know no one's going to read some random dude's white paper. But I took a video recording of me presenting the white paper for the you know, I'm pretty engaging to listen. So he was like, oh this guy's think I don't know what you were thinking Christopher, but you let me in. I was so excited and I was like I will work for free, just let me participate in this amazing thing. I can't believe you guys are doing exactly what I want to do. So I jumped in as I don't even know, I guess I was like an intern or something, right, and helped make the slack and coordinate the community around Slockit and that was really how I got in.
00:13:18.032 - 00:13:30.190, Speaker A: So you guys had this idea for this universal sharing economy that had these kind of like smart locks that would open with ethereum transactions. Is that like a good kind of general description?
00:13:31.170 - 00:13:36.094, Speaker E: This one? Oh wow. That's actually the one. That's the one from Defcon one.
00:13:36.292 - 00:13:40.260, Speaker A: Wow. And can you hold it up once more for a bit longer?
00:13:41.510 - 00:13:42.402, Speaker E: Can you see this?
00:13:42.456 - 00:14:14.560, Speaker A: Wow, it's a doorknob one. Okay, nice. That's so funny for people listening on audio. You might want to check out the video for that. And so then you had this idea to get funding from this Dow which would kind of I mean the way most people thought of it was that it was going to be this decentralized venture fund because there would be like proposals and then the community would vote on which ones they wanted to fund. So when you announced the Dow, what was the community's general response to the idea?
00:14:14.930 - 00:14:49.890, Speaker E: I would say very positive. In the beginning it was like really what always people wanted to do but also it was not thought of as a venture fund. Although of course, later on it became more this direction because people talked about it like it in the beginning. It was more like their company which would be behind a decentralized sharing economy or behind a universal sharing network and we would be one of many getting funded by it because we would build it and work for it. Let's say we would do like let's say bike locks or door locks. Then other company would do washing machines, whatever. So they could also go to this Dow and ask for funding because they want to connect some other stuff to the sharing economy.
00:14:49.890 - 00:15:17.570, Speaker E: But I was thinking at least more of this is the company which builds universal share network or companies maybe the wrong word. So more the organization which is doing this completely distributed and we would just be a service provider. But yes, the community was actually very interested in it. That's why we got like 5000 people on Slack. Within a couple of weeks at Defcon One, people got excited. They love to go to our booth and feel and touch kind of ethereum. I think it was more like for the first time people could touch ethereum in some way.
00:15:17.570 - 00:15:34.470, Speaker E: They could get a feeling of an airbnb was a big thing back then. Like it was really exciting to taking off and people learned how airbnb works and just this idea of I could pay kind of the door lock to open and people got really excited to see it firsthand. So that's I think, one reason we got such a positive feedback.
00:15:34.970 - 00:15:49.418, Speaker A: Yeah, actually I'm in an airbnb right now and I had trouble with the lock and it would have been really nice if I could have used a transaction on my phone to open it. But anyway and griff we're left Harris. Do you want to add anything to that?
00:15:49.584 - 00:16:35.242, Speaker C: I can just say 100% agree. The venture side of the Dow was kind of rewritten after the Dow hack and really during at the time of course, the Dow could do anything but I think we imagined that the main Dow would follow Slocket or like that was kind of the cultural thing that we expected. We had no idea. But the Dow had this feature where it would split. So you know, at least I thought other people might want to try other ventures but it probably end up splitting off into a separate Dow and siphoning some of the original funds. So it would have been a very fractal sort of VC fund if it went that direction. But we never know.
00:16:35.376 - 00:17:10.150, Speaker E: I think it came a bit when a lot of money came in in the beginning when we thought about 5 million. You cannot fund hundreds, hundreds of ventures with like 5 million or even ten. So it was like maybe five, maybe ten, maybe even 20 million. You could still use all of this for the universal share network for like let's say five companies building things around it. But when there was $150,000,000 in it then it really looked like a venture fund because this can fund so many things in the Ethereum world and people accepted this is like that decentralized venture fund for the Ethereum community funding everything in there. This was how it was after it received that much money but not before.
00:17:10.300 - 00:17:13.106, Speaker A: And why did you guys not cap the sale?
00:17:13.298 - 00:17:45.658, Speaker E: There were several reasons for this. I remember we had a discussion in Slack about this pros and cons. The pros, of course, security point of view. Like we don't need that much money. This was a pro. The con was, what if one big whale just gets all of it or 50 or 60% of it just very quickly? Because you saw those ICOs the big guys getting in very quickly. And this was one thing we were afraid of and that maybe some people want to get in and cannot get in, and maybe we feeled overconfident in the security of the dow that we didn't think of this kind of hack.
00:17:45.658 - 00:18:03.154, Speaker E: This is also why we tested that much and people could split off if they don't like it. So that in the end we decided to not do it because got things more complicated than it needs to be. Of course, in hint side from a security point of view, it would have been better if we would have done it, of course. But back at the time we decided.
00:18:03.202 - 00:18:16.300, Speaker A: Not to and just to go back to how popular the Dow became and how it raised so much money. Why do you think it raised that much money? Because it was a lot and Ethereum wasn't even that big at that time.
00:18:17.070 - 00:18:55.702, Speaker C: The split function, right. It felt like a risk free investment because you could always split your money out and it's kind of like what is now the rage quit mechanism in Mullockdows where it feels like well okay, I can put my money in but I have cryptographic security that I can pull my money out. So it felt like something to do and then of course once it cascaded and got so big people FOMOed in no know at the time we didn't understand it was this is long before all the ICOs and all that stuff. So that's my guess. What do you mean?
00:18:55.836 - 00:19:28.034, Speaker D: I credit Stefan for this. He was really good at what he did and we had let's say the cream of the crop of the Ethereum community back then as curator. So it really looked as if it's approved by everyone and everybody and it's the next big thing. This is how it looked like. And probably that alone should have pointed to us that it will get bigger than we expected. But nobody expected this much money. I don't think that Kristoff expected reading the book.
00:19:28.034 - 00:19:29.700, Speaker D: I don't think you expected that much.
00:19:31.030 - 00:19:52.890, Speaker E: Absolutely not. I also have to say in hindsight I was very naive at the time. I didn't make a big deal of those. Like Stefan, I think he understood a bit more what we were doing there because he was more like the marketing and community management. And so for me it was really we needed a list of creators who know what they were doing. So of course it would be nice if they're respected in the community. That's why I asked them.
00:19:52.890 - 00:20:10.030, Speaker E: But I didn't think of it as also a marketing thing. Like you have those names there. Stefan understood this very well and used this also and I can't blame him for this again, he did a great job. His job was to build a community and to get people excited about it, which he did way better than we expected. And the second thing.
00:20:10.100 - 00:20:10.382, Speaker D: Why?
00:20:10.436 - 00:20:56.606, Speaker E: I think that's what Crypt said. After, let's say the first ten or 15 million, it got attention and then people started to think of it as an investment fund. And so if all the companies building on Ethereum would be funded by the Dow, then this would be the perfect investment. If you just want to invest in the Ethereum ecosystem, but not the base layer on the application layer, it looked like created by those guys. Even though their job was not like to judge those projects, their job was actually to check the address, maybe an ID that everything is correct, but it looked like they would actually create and look at what's good, what's not, and all the applications would just get funding from there. So then from an investor point of view, I got one call from an Israeli guy, said we want to put in 20 million maybe, and if it's safe or not. I just said nothing.
00:20:56.606 - 00:21:22.838, Speaker E: Well, you have to decide on your own, you have to do a security audit. I can't tell you anything. But this was clearly a guy who thought about it from a purely investment perspective. Like, is this the way I can invest in the Ethereum application layer? That's how it became later on because it started like toasted first ten or 20 million and then as Griffith said, they FOMOed in because they maybe thought there's no other way to get into those application layer companies building because they would all get funded by the Dow. That could be one reason.
00:21:23.004 - 00:22:12.546, Speaker A: Yeah, that makes sense because I did realize in the course of my reporting that there were multiple companies that were looking to make proposals to the Dow and ultimately later they had ICOs. But at the time there were a lot of people that were like, oh, I'll go get funding from the Dow. One thing I want the listeners to know is that we have mentioned Stefan a few times. That's Stefan Tuol, who actually started in Ethereum as the well, I think he started kind of more as like community management and communications. And then later he was brought onto the management team as Chief communications Officer. And then you will read what happened in the book to him at the EF, at the Ethereum Foundation. And then later he ended up at Slockit as a co founder.
00:22:12.546 - 00:22:25.020, Speaker A: And again, he kind of had this sort of outward facing communications type role. So once you guys realized that it was going to be huge, how did you feel?
00:22:25.950 - 00:22:44.650, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I think I was the only one that was happy about it, honestly. Well, maybe Stefan too. Stefan was pretty happy about it. Everyone else, the developers were scared, like profanity insert profanity here. It was a really intense time, but I don't know. Christophe, I think you have to say how you felt.
00:22:44.810 - 00:23:05.894, Speaker E: Again, we did not expect anything like this at all. On the one side happy. Like, the plan worked. We actually got money because there was also a fear that maybe get just like, a couple of hundred thousand, and this was like, nothing. And we worked so much for it because from a financial point of view, we did not expect this taking so long. And also, Simon, he was using his credit cards to buy food for his family. He didn't get money for a long time.
00:23:05.894 - 00:23:24.298, Speaker E: We were so developers. We were naive, like always. Two weeks. You can build anything in two weeks. So we thought maybe end of December, January, we're getting the stuff out. And then, of course, it took longer and more legal work, and then it tracked on until April. And so we really needed funding, and we were totally stressed because we are working like crazy all those hours.
00:23:24.298 - 00:23:45.426, Speaker E: So we was like, Now I need a break. And this was not a like, this was just more exciting, more people asking me. I just needed a little break. And I was really scared about it. I mean, there's a photo of me with one guy in Berlin, EY Advisor, and he was, like, giving us, shaking hands, concreting us. I could not even be happy. Like, they were making dinner for us.
00:23:45.426 - 00:24:06.842, Speaker E: I was, just, leave me alone for a couple of weeks, because this is like I don't know where this will like, if there's so much money in it. I have no idea what this will become. And maybe I don't want to be associated with this anymore if they're just funding some crazy stuff, which I don't like. But I also didn't know. I could never, ever stop this. Even when I'm 80 or 90, this is true. On Ethereum, you'll always see this.
00:24:06.842 - 00:24:11.510, Speaker E: This will always be there, just not alive anymore. Not that much alive.
00:24:11.670 - 00:24:13.580, Speaker A: Love, Harris. Do you want to add on that?
00:24:15.630 - 00:24:56.682, Speaker D: Actually, for the entire duration, I think, of the race, I was not in Germany. I was at my parents'place in Greece, and they were also watching it and saying, oh, look at what our son is working on. It's gathering money. And it's like, yeah. And then he's like, oh, wait, isn't the lottery didn't you guys quote this? Are you sure that it's okay? And then I said, yeah, no worries. And then it started going 510, and then it went up, and I just didn't want to go back to Germany. I got similar stresses as Christophe, because it's actually quite simple as a developer, you just know that things can go wrong.
00:24:56.682 - 00:25:12.014, Speaker D: There is no such thing as bug free code. And yeah, it's just stressful to know that something that you worked on has gathered and is securing so much money and well, probably that stress had a reason to be there due to what happened.
00:25:12.212 - 00:25:56.958, Speaker A: Yeah, so let's talk about that, because before the actual hack, there were a lot of conversations online about how there were flaws in the Dow, nobody picked up on the ultimate exploit. But obviously there was a New York Times article of flaws that eman Gunseer, the Cornell professor pointed out, along with, I think it was like Dino Mark and I forget who else was on that paper, but in dino Mark used to work at Consensus. Oh, yeah. Vlad Zamfair. Yeah. Who worked doing ethereum research. But there were other things because I know you guys were looking at how to enable people to remove their money more quickly and kind of arguing about whether or not you should do that and things like that.
00:25:56.958 - 00:26:19.250, Speaker A: So at that time when people were pointing out the flaws, the sale was done. You knew you had rated. So by my calculation, the day that the sale ended it was 139,000,000. But then the price of ether was rising. So by the morning of the hack it was a quarter billion dollars. So while people were talking about all the flaws and then you're seeing the dollar value of it rise, what were your feelings during that period?
00:26:19.410 - 00:26:50.794, Speaker E: So I did take them seriously, but also, as I said, nobody pointed out the really bad flaws. Like you can take money from it or it was more game, theoretical things that you could, for example, disbiase towards. Yes and yes, those are true things, but they're usually not fair tell like, this is not like the end of it. It was more like, yes, it needs improvement. So sometimes they did write it in a manner it sounded like everything is going to end. The thing is like completely broken. And so that's why we defended it sometimes that, no, it's not completely broken, it needs improvement.
00:26:50.794 - 00:27:12.674, Speaker E: And then we started working on this Dow version two we made on GitHub. Like already created those issues. I started to writing code. We all know that Dow version two is not just a simple click and deploy. It needs to deploy and convince everybody to move there. And so that's why we also tried to work on what can we do, like as intermediate solutions. What we could do was working on the smart contract of the receiver of the funds.
00:27:12.674 - 00:27:44.302, Speaker E: So we made this like a small contract from which you can make proposals to receive money from the Dow, would hope that people would use it as a default. And there you could build in a bit more security things so that people could, for example, get their money back from there as well if they would voted for it. Things like this, like a daily payout, not all at once. So that's the kind of things you worked on. And since we were not scared for this thing, would lose all their money. It's just like, yes, needs improvement, we need a second version. And also because it got that big, we said let's create a security group.
00:27:44.302 - 00:28:35.300, Speaker E: You wrote about this in this book. We make a proposal and since it. Got that big and I was scared, I was like let's get like five of the top notch researchers and they are costing like 300 or $500 per hour if you're asking for those security audit companies they charge a lot. And so we said this is very expensive, we want to have 24/7 everybody like all the time watching the ether scan or something, what is happening? And so we made a proposal which was expensive and we wrote how the community reacted was not happy. So we said okay, we don't want this, we make a smaller one. Which of course just one guy, not that much security but we felt of course this was so new and so much waste this could maybe be attacked. So you wanted to do something also even though we thought none of the flaws mentioned were brutal, critical and would stop everything, just small things which needs improvement and that's what you tried to fix.
00:28:36.150 - 00:29:38.770, Speaker D: I felt a bit annoyed by all of this stuff because I'll be honest, I felt that people wanted to make themselves famous through associating with the Dow in a negative way. Like we had a lot of problems pointed out but these problems for example like the negative vote thing, the bias for voting yes I think or something like that DAOs still have this problem. I had not fight but argument with someone from the ENS Dao right now that a proposal was not going to pass because he was abstaining. And then he says oh yes, you are actually right. And then he voted no just to make the proposal pass even though he wanted to say that he didn't want to vote no so that he doesn't agree and he abstained and that with 3 hours for the proposal, basically it would make it not pass even though if he voted no, the proposal would pass. It's exactly that same thing and it still happens. So it's not as if the problems that were pointed out were serious.
00:29:38.770 - 00:29:48.780, Speaker D: Maybe the most serious one was something that was not found by any of them and it was the one that the withdrawal how was it called?
00:29:49.230 - 00:30:11.262, Speaker A: Yeah, the stalking withdrawals, which this is yeah, well, so we can talk about that later when we talk about my article revealing who we believe did attack the Dow. Okay, so why don't we do this? So we're going to take a commercial break to hear from the sponsors who make the show possible and afterward we will go into all things Dow attack.

00:32:29.462 - 00:32:48.050, Speaker A: Now@crossriver.com slash crypto back to my conversation with Christophe, Lefteris and Griff. All right, so let's talk about the did you why don't you each just tell us briefly how it is that you found out and how you felt at that think?
00:32:48.120 - 00:33:14.522, Speaker C: I think I was the first to find out. I want to say his name was Mo. Man, I can't even remember anymore. So long ago, I woke up and went to the slack because that's my know and just talking to the community and they're like, hey, something weird is know. Looks like the Ether scan maybe is broken or something. And then started looking into it. And then I started DMing everyone because it looked really bad.
00:33:14.522 - 00:33:33.166, Speaker C: And eventually got a hold of Simon, who's not in this call. And I was like, you got to find Christophe, go to his house, wake him up, because this is like 06:30 A.m. Or something. Yeah. And then we had to formulate a plan. I think I ended up getting a hold of Left Harris. I can't remember who got a hold.
00:33:33.188 - 00:33:39.394, Speaker D: Of you, left definitely you. I remember this call. It was you. It was early morning.
00:33:39.592 - 00:33:42.626, Speaker A: And how did you feel when you heard the news?
00:33:42.808 - 00:34:23.490, Speaker D: I just didn't believe first of all, I didn't believe what Griff was saying, so I wanted to verify it, and I verified that something is wrong by going to Etherscan. And then I felt really bad, and I just tried to realize what's happening. I think that my first reaction was to actually because it was maybe eight or nine so close to my like, I had to wake up. I had woken up. And then I probably started to try and understand and also talk with others. And Christoph, I think, and others in the chats about trying to figure out what the attack was and remake the contract, recreate the attack, basically to understand what's happening.
00:34:23.640 - 00:34:25.538, Speaker A: And Christophe, I think.
00:34:25.544 - 00:34:46.374, Speaker E: It was Friday morning, if I remember right. Yeah, my brother called my wife. She was waking me up because I was walking long. So I was sleeping a bit longer in the morning. And Simon was just saying, well, there's something strange happening. Just check on Esoscan. So when I went on Ether scan, you could see this very regular thing going out.
00:34:46.374 - 00:35:11.102, Speaker E: I could look like it was a split dow function called the beginning. I was saying, well, it's just a regular thing. People can call the split dow. It's just something for whatever reason, someone doing it in a very regular way. But looking deeper that having some kind of going through other contracts and going back then it seemed like, no, this is an hack. And then I really realized this is over. This was like game over for me because I know how less we could do.
00:35:11.102 - 00:35:37.378, Speaker E: I know that we had no power over the dow. We couldn't change the code, we couldn't do anything. So this was like the worst case scenario. I prepared in a way that people could split and get their money out. That's what the last test I did was always, if something is wrong, people can split and get their money out, or they can make a proposal and get their money out so the money can never get stuck. I was more worried about, but this money was flowing out of the system. I was then laying on my crown.
00:35:37.378 - 00:35:58.750, Speaker E: This is over. So then I really have to get all my stuff together again. I said, well, now let's fight back. I have to do what I got to do. So call Vita league. They called the Ethereum Foundation for help because I wanted to have as many people as possible looking at the code, seeing because I could not see directly what was happening. Like in the first, let's say 30 minutes or so, I did not detect what was happening.
00:35:58.750 - 00:36:31.574, Speaker E: And we started the call with the Ethereum Foundation. And this was a strange feeling because I haven't talked to them since a while. Hi, guys, I'm here again, and I'm really sorry. I think that's how I started. They didn't want to hear this. Like, okay, let's just dig in. What's happening here? Is anybody a clue? Just right into what can we do? And I think even this first call, we thought about all options and just like soft fork, something quick, like, can we somehow get the miners to not include transaction to the style, just to win some time? This was the first thought.
00:36:31.574 - 00:36:49.662, Speaker E: We need time to analyze this. That's why the soft fork was the first idea, I think. Hard fork. I don't know if it came up or not in the call, but soft fork first. Let's buy time. But we could not find it out in this call. After speaking to each other, sharing all the information, we got back to work and tried to figure it out.
00:36:49.662 - 00:36:57.342, Speaker E: What it was, I don't know exactly who found it out and reported it, I think was on some Skype or Slack channel. Someone who shared the details.
00:36:57.406 - 00:37:27.530, Speaker A: Yeah. And one thing I want to clarify for people. When you said that you couldn't fix it, it's because you would have needed to get the whole community to agree to this upgrade and then get everybody to migrate their know it's since it's decentralized. Also, you weren't in control of it. You couldn't just kind of be like, okay, we're going to fix this and redo it. It was live on Ethereum and it would have needed all the community support to change it. And frankly, the tooling is not what it is today.
00:37:27.530 - 00:37:57.060, Speaker A: So even though it was technically a Dow, there was literally no way for the token holders to really manage it, which is like another funny thing, but also cool to see how much progress has been made in DAOs. Okay, so this next part only involves Left Harris and Griff because I believe and Christophe, you can correct me if I'm wrong at this point, you just decided to focus on coding up a hard fork in case Ethereum decided to go that route was not this day.
00:37:57.430 - 00:38:16.698, Speaker E: It took a bit more time until this decision was made. I don't know, one or two weeks, not too long. But it didn't take too long for me to realize the hard fault would be the only clean solution, that everybody could get everything back, everything else should be tried. And then you take it over Left Harris and Griff because you focus on plan B. Yeah.
00:38:16.784 - 00:38:31.262, Speaker A: So during this part, Lectery and Griff were involved in trying to rescue the money. So talk a little bit about what that was like and what was going on in your mind while you were working on that or trying to work on that.
00:38:31.396 - 00:38:47.642, Speaker C: Well, it was definitely a team effort. Right. Like the night before the Dao, I was starting a blog post about Jordy Balina, who made liquid democracy for the Dao that I had already used, which we still don't have today on Ethereum anywhere as far as I can brain.
00:38:47.726 - 00:38:50.406, Speaker A: Which is like delegating votes, right?
00:38:50.588 - 00:38:59.154, Speaker C: Yeah. Liquid delegation. So you could delegate to someone who could delegate, who could delegate. And so there's one hop delegation on Ethereum, but I haven't seen too much liquid democracy.
00:38:59.282 - 00:39:07.050, Speaker D: But he had made the thing, right? He created this contract and it was there, but just never got used. You to the Dow?
00:39:07.630 - 00:39:09.578, Speaker C: I used it to vote on something.
00:39:09.744 - 00:39:17.838, Speaker A: Oh, wait, in the Dow, because I could have sworn he told me that he created it too late. So it actually didn't get implemented in.
00:39:17.844 - 00:40:01.050, Speaker C: The Dow it didn't get implemented in the Dow code as a default for voting everywhere. So then he re implemented it on top of Ethereum as separate contracts so that you could just send your Dow tokens to a contract. And then you'd get Dow vote tokens and then you'd use those Dow vote tokens to signal how your delegate should vote or kind of or your delegate would have to vote by a certain time. And then you could use your delegate Dow tokens to pull out your Dow tokens so his vote doesn't have your weight. If you disagree. It was a super cool thing and it worked. And so I was writing a blog post and then, of course, the next day well, that wasn't the priority, that blog post anymore.
00:40:01.050 - 00:40:07.854, Speaker C: But while Lefteris was figuring out how the hack happened I think you were first, Left. I can't remember.
00:40:08.052 - 00:40:16.530, Speaker D: Yeah. This is something that wasn't in the book. And I was like, oh, no, my moment of glory.
00:40:17.270 - 00:40:20.210, Speaker A: Well, you didn't tell me then because I didn't notice.
00:40:20.870 - 00:40:50.720, Speaker D: I don't remember. Actually, I tried to forget this stuff because I also was too scared about the implications, I think, that I haven't talked to anybody about this stuff until you contacted me. And the only reason why I think I talked to you is because a lot of time passed since then. But it was just that, as far as I recall, I had recreated the attack and had an attack contract ready on the same night. But we never used it at that day. We used it later.
00:40:51.090 - 00:40:54.878, Speaker C: Yeah. And Jordy had his own attack contract. Right.
00:40:55.044 - 00:41:03.518, Speaker D: This is in the book. So Jordy was also mentioned pretty well. There about that last 4 million.
00:41:03.684 - 00:41:12.820, Speaker A: Well, love, Harris. I don't know if I ever update the book in any way. I will try to put your moment of glory in there.
00:41:13.430 - 00:41:31.866, Speaker C: Yeah. We had figured out how the attack happened and then we kind of gathered other people who we trusted to figure out if we should make an attack because the hacker stole $50 million, but there's $100 million still sitting there.
00:41:31.888 - 00:41:32.218, Speaker D: Right.
00:41:32.304 - 00:41:55.970, Speaker C: And while the hacker was attacking, we didn't have it still, but then the attack just stopped and we didn't really know why. And then we figured out how to hack. And so then it was like, well, but there's no sense of urgency. The draining has stopped. So when do we attack? And this was like a big debate amongst, at that time, the Robin Hood group.
00:41:56.120 - 00:42:12.120, Speaker A: Yeah. Which people can definitely read about this in the book because this was fascinating to me and it still is part of kind of the philosophical question around what really even happened. So during this whole time, did you guys think that the Dow attacker was going to attack again?
00:42:12.650 - 00:42:55.782, Speaker D: I mean, nothing stopped him. Right. I think Griff, you maybe mentioned that he stopped because not mentioned, like theorized right? That maybe he stopped because if he took everything, then, like two months, but if he just took 30% of it and then maybe he can get away with it or something like that. Others theorize that maybe his contract got broken somehow. He had some kind of flow and then he just stopped. But as you also mentioned in the book, if I realized it in less than a day, then others can do that also. And once that's publicized, everybody can copycat the entire attack.
00:42:55.782 - 00:43:03.400, Speaker D: So then even if it's not the original hacker, someone else will perform an attack. It was just a matter of time.
00:43:03.850 - 00:43:26.318, Speaker A: So the next kind of month for you guys was very intense. Do you want to talk a little bit about what that was like during that period between and we didn't even really cover the initial rescue, so we can talk about the initial rescue. And just in general, what you were doing between then and the hard fork and what was going through your head and what your life was like.
00:43:26.484 - 00:43:57.218, Speaker C: It was dow wars. It was left at the beginning. Lef and Jordy were just practicing attacking it was like drills, like military drills. And they were going all day, all night, just practicing attacking the Dow. And I was going more from the social angle, gathering capital. Because to attack the Dow effectively, you needed a lot of money. And so it was like, on the social side, it was finding all of the curators, getting their private keys.
00:43:57.218 - 00:44:17.280, Speaker C: It's hard to get people's private keys. I can't believe they were handing them out. So we got their private keys. We're asking other people for Dow tokens and ether so that we can achieve the attacks in a faster way. And it was just kind of a waiting game until eventually someone actually started hacking. And that's when it was wild. It was really crazy.
00:44:17.280 - 00:45:11.674, Speaker C: People still have gas issues to this day, right? We were having gas issues. It felt like a military operation, but at the same time, we are not military people. We were just hackers trying to make it work. And then once we ended up rescuing the funds, then it was kind of just pushing for the hard fork as well as there ended up being eight, nine different hackers that all had money in it. So we had to figure out, how do we we didn't stop. It was just this constant, christophe is holding down the hard fork stuff. Let's figure out the hard fork will work, but what if it doesn't? And that was left Terrace and I and Jordy and the crew, because after we stole $100 million from the Dow, some people didn't want to be any part of it anymore.
00:45:11.674 - 00:45:27.442, Speaker C: So the Robin hood group became the white hat group. It's a much smaller group, and we just kept practicing, like, how are we going to hack the other hackers and how can we engineer a solution to get into the dark dow? Right. And I'm sure you talk about all this stuff in your book.
00:45:27.496 - 00:45:42.570, Speaker A: Yeah. And so for people, Dark Dow was the split dow or child dow, where the hacker had siphoned the funds, the 3.64 million ETH, the 31% of the ETH in the dow left terrace. What about you? What was your life like during this period?
00:45:43.070 - 00:46:00.400, Speaker D: Not fun, basically like this. Basically what? Described it very accurately since the night of the I think it was evening, right. The initial White Hat attack.
00:46:01.170 - 00:46:04.842, Speaker A: Yeah. Like Tuesday night around 07:00 p.m.. I think, if I remember correctly.
00:46:04.906 - 00:46:44.666, Speaker D: Yeah, like, you explained how it happened in the book. I don't know how much detail you want me to go. I think that it was mostly accurate that we also I think we shared the same private key and just had different people do the attacks, had scripts. So the initial attack was successful in taking everything out of the dow except for the last remaining in which Jordy had a different contract that he had made. And that was basically I remember it was different than mine, and it just didn't have the already made attack. So he just made it work and take the last 4 million. And from that point on, Griff had this amazing spreadsheet.
00:46:44.666 - 00:46:57.714, Speaker D: I still have a link to it, I think, where he organized everything very nicely. So I still think that this is a very nice I think you probably had access to it right? Because you use the same names that we used there in the book.
00:46:57.912 - 00:47:27.178, Speaker A: Yeah. I can't remember if I had access to the doc or if Griff gave me a screenshot of it, but I'm now actually listening to my own audiobook because I have never heard it all the way through. And earlier today I went through that section. I was narrating it to myself. And yeah, it's very intense because also, if I remember correctly, it was like, color coded. There are certain days where it's just like you can tell you guys were like, we have to do this thing right now. There's like a lot of exclamation points, too.
00:47:27.264 - 00:47:39.998, Speaker D: So basically Griff's job there was exactly like gathering before the initial attack, gather the funds to do the because this required a lot of ether and I.
00:47:40.004 - 00:47:42.990, Speaker C: Don'T remember no, mostly Dow tokens.
00:47:43.330 - 00:47:46.654, Speaker A: Yeah. No, it required was it Dow token?
00:47:46.702 - 00:47:48.878, Speaker E: Yeah, mostly dow Tokens.
00:47:49.054 - 00:47:49.394, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:47:49.432 - 00:47:51.090, Speaker A: Dow tokens to get ETH.
00:47:51.430 - 00:47:55.630, Speaker C: The more dow tokens you had, the more ether you could score out of the dow.
00:47:55.790 - 00:47:59.258, Speaker A: Exactly. Yeah. You were sending in dow tokens and getting out ETH.
00:47:59.294 - 00:48:40.738, Speaker D: Yeah, we had the whales that gave us Dow tokens and then just used them for draining. But also the fact that there were many copycats that indeed attacked at the same time as us, which is what caused us to actually take action. Finally, all those copycats got funds and they had to be followed. And it was people like Grief who organized. I think that Griffith organized the entire thing on the dates. So when did this guy attack? When is his two week period? How much do we have there? And he was basically counting like, do we have this press it that counts. How many tokens do we have in each darkdow? Which we basically followed all of them in the original chain at least.
00:48:40.904 - 00:49:23.646, Speaker A: Yeah, I think this was one of the hardest parts of the book for me to explain. There were just so many Dows and the money was kind of different types of money. Like, some of them were dark, meaning they looked nefarious, like people who had hacked for bad reasons. And then others were people, like trying to innocently take their money out and just be like, I'm done with the Dow. I had a very hard time explaining this because this got super complicated. But the point is it was much worse for you because you were trying to chase all that money. All right, so let's move ahead to the hard fork.
00:49:23.646 - 00:49:56.938, Speaker A: By the way, so we are going to skip over a very interesting side story with the Dow, which is kind of crazy and mind blowing. And if you have not read the book yet, just please read it because there is something really crazy and a nice little subplot going on here that is very mind blowing. All right, so you guys, hard fork. After the hard fork, did you expect Ethereum Classic to survive? And once you saw it did survive, how did you feel about that?
00:49:57.104 - 00:50:19.614, Speaker C: I in no way expected Ethereum Classic to survive. It didn't make any sense to me at the time. Now it makes more sense. But at the time it was like everybody who had Ether got etc. Why wouldn't they just sell it? There's no development going on on even. It took me a while to call, etc. I was pretty irreverent.
00:50:19.614 - 00:50:30.130, Speaker C: I was calling it dead, right? So you can use your dead ETH for nothing. Just sell so but I don't know, maybe other people had thoughts.
00:50:30.290 - 00:51:07.730, Speaker E: I also did not expect it at all because also we had hard forks before, also the Ethereum. And nobody did care about the minority chain mostly. There was a nice blog post by Vitalik recently about I cannot say this in English legitimacy to say is it legit or not? And Legit also came with Vita Lake, the Ethereum Foundation. Like the community in general. And it did feel all the time nobody wanted two chains. So meaning even though somewhere against the hard fork, they mostly said but I will follow whatever the maturity of the Ethereum community will do. That's what I felt before.
00:51:07.730 - 00:51:26.534, Speaker E: So meaning I did not expect at all that there was a large group would say I don't follow the maturity. I want to make this chain kind of work and support it and listing the coin. So I did not even think about selling because I did not think that someone would actually list it or it would continue to be mined. So I was totally surprised by it.
00:51:26.652 - 00:51:27.762, Speaker A: Love tariff.
00:51:27.906 - 00:52:02.100, Speaker D: I think that here I was very much, how do you say affected by Griff's comments, because I didn't know anything about what he called seed coins back then, or altcoins or I went with what he said and thought that there is no way. And I also didn't imagine that this could happen. And I just thought that this should not exist, this can't exist, it's a joke. And then it actually existed and stayed. But I didn't expect it. Let's just keep it short and say that I would not have expected Ethereum classic to survive it made. No.
00:52:03.110 - 00:52:14.150, Speaker A: So I know Christoph and Luftharis have read this part of the book and Griff hasn't because he just got the book yesterday. But now that you guys have read this part, do you guys have more understanding about why that happened? I'm just curious.
00:52:14.650 - 00:52:53.074, Speaker D: Even later, I kind of understood what happened. I mean, the things that you explain in there after the stuff with Switzerland, there are some things that are not in the book. I think that we were contacted by some of these people and I realized that there was a lot going on behind the scenes that I didn't know at the time. And if I had known those, I would have expected for it to stay, that there are powers that want it to stay because of financial reasons. But at the time, which time means first days after the hard fork. No, sorry. Listing off from polonix, that is what made it for me and everybody else.
00:52:53.074 - 00:53:08.998, Speaker D: I think the listing by Polonix meant that it survives. At the time I thought that no, this can't be serious and that it's a joke and the polonics makes a mistake and we can just get free money. But then I realized it a lot later.
00:53:09.164 - 00:53:52.550, Speaker E: Yeah, hint mean also when I read the book, I have been very naive and I have lived in this Ethereum bubble. So to say I was never like a hardcore bitcoiner, even though I love bitcoin still do. I never was so much engaged in this community. And so that's why at a time I didn't anticipate there was so much hate against Ethereum because they maybe missed out on the crowd sale or they just hated Ethereum because it had a pre mine, how they call it. So because of all those reasons, there was a lot of negative energy, also with a lot of money and also with a lot of influence on those exchanges and of course on the crypto community in general. And realizing now, of course, the power was there, the financial incentive was there. There was enough reason to hate Ethereum and to see this is a chance.
00:53:52.550 - 00:54:10.874, Speaker E: Like, also, especially the hard fork goes against Bitcoin philosophy a lot. So this was a lot of reason for them to stay on the other side. So it makes a lot of sense today. But again, I was in my little not crypto bubble, Ethereum bubble, and from that bubble, that bubble's point of view didn't make sense.
00:54:11.072 - 00:54:42.966, Speaker A: Yeah. And so for people like, Left Terrace was sort of referencing that subplot I mentioned. And you're right, I think shortly after this, he understood probably why it survived or why it would survive, but okay, so why don't we just quickly catch everybody up on what you've done since all these events in Ethereum just kind of the last few years. And if you could just talk about kind of how people in Ethereum treat you, or maybe they don't know that you were involved in this. I don't know, but I'm just curious to hear.
00:54:43.148 - 00:55:08.990, Speaker E: Well, I think the story starts really with defcon too. This was shortly after that, and I was really, really afraid of going there. Even on the airport. I was saying, what if just some crazy Chinese guy just on the street just punches me or whatever. I was really even afraid of physical violence against me. So I did not know what to expect when going there. That's also a thing.
00:55:08.990 - 00:55:31.190, Speaker E: You cannot read this in the book, but I think it's okay to say now I was not allowed to speak about the Tao. I wanted to speak about the Dao and I wanted to like what happened and how I feel about it if I wanted to talk about it. I was not getting a talk. So, like, Ming was really, really strict because of SEC. They feared that Ethereum would be connected to a Dao. This was like a forbidden topic. I was not allowed to mention it.
00:55:31.190 - 00:56:01.934, Speaker E: They were standing there with the trigger to shut me down and have a do because they didn't know if I would talk about was like that's why I had to talk about smart contract security. Which seems like a bit boring after the dow means. Sure, it's also related, but it would expect me to speak about what happened. But I was really not allowed to. So I made a more or less boring talk about smart contract security, like what we learned, what should be done in the future. But in the end, defcon 280 percent of the talks were about smart contract security. Like, this was every talk saying the same.
00:56:01.934 - 00:56:26.486, Speaker E: So in the end, yes, I at least said a little bit like, thank you very much for what you got. I'm sorry for what happened, kind of. And I tried to give a little bit of the emotion, which I actually felt all the time, what I really wanted to say. And I got a very positive feedback in doing Defcon. So many people came to. Me and said thank you and what you went through and very positive. I was very relieved to feel this way because it meant for me.
00:56:26.486 - 00:56:58.370, Speaker E: I can continue to be a part of this community. I can continue to work in this space. Of course there will be people who hate me for what happened, but the maturity of people understand and support me and this is like everything which came after it was more or less the same. Of course, the closer you get to the Dow from a timescale perspective, the more people remember me and about this. But now, six years later, if you go somewhere, people don't know about the Dow anymore. Maybe something happened like there. But only really people who were in the community at that time know my involvement or our involvement and know me.
00:56:58.370 - 00:57:19.370, Speaker E: So this kind of time forgives lots of things. So after like one year or two, it was not that big of an issue anymore. And I stayed in this ecosystem as an entrepreneur building Slockit and as we sold it. Now I'm building a venture studio with lots of projects in this direction. So that's future. But yes, I more or less stayed there as an entrepreneur and trying to build things on Ethereum.
00:57:20.110 - 00:57:45.742, Speaker D: I had similar feelings with Christophe. I was not welcome anymore in this because I had a part in the Dow. I didn't want to go to DevCon. Two, I was afraid for similar reasons, but also for reasons you have in the book. Violence and problems because of some characters. But there I felt so just talking to people. I just felt relieved.
00:57:45.742 - 00:58:15.514, Speaker D: Like completely relieved. There was not a single person who was aggressive. Everybody was saying you guys did great. And that's without anybody knowing what I did there. So this is something that actually has pissed me off to this day. At that point I decided that after leaving that subplot that I would never talk about what happened with the hack that I was not involved in. Even though some people mentioned my name, I never said that I did this.
00:58:15.514 - 00:58:38.002, Speaker D: And Griff, I had to ask him to not mention my name. And that's why I was not known to be much. The only thing is some reddit posts that some people assume that I am part of the Robinhound group. But I never actually said anything until basically you contacted me. Or maybe Matthew Lisink is the first guy that I talked to. But I think that we talked more than anything else. In more detail.
00:58:38.002 - 00:59:27.620, Speaker D: I mean, back in Devconto I felt just by mentioning that I worked in the Dao and that it like bad time. Everybody was just saying really good things. Nobody said oh, you like did something wrong or we hate you or anything like that. And something that I think that Christoph sometimes is a bit too psy. He didn't just get positive feedback. Probably this in the video but you will see that he got a standing ovation at the end of his DevCon Two talk. And it was a very emotional moment, I think, at least for me, because I was there in the crowd and it felt as if you can still be part of the community, because after living there, I really thought that after leaving that subplot, I thought that I would be out of crypto completely.
00:59:27.620 - 00:59:34.980, Speaker D: And Christophe's talk and the reaction to it and the experiences they had in Sanghai basically made me change my mind.
00:59:36.150 - 00:59:53.626, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah, I watched that video and I chronicle it in the book because also it was emotional, even just watching it for me. So, yeah, it was really lovely how people treated you afterward. I felt grip. Sorry, did you want to talk a little bit about what you had done since and how people treated you?
00:59:53.808 - 01:00:07.054, Speaker C: Sure. And Left Terrace is totally underselling his contributions, as always, to the space after he left from Raiden and all the BrainBot work and to starting Rokkey, which.
01:00:07.092 - 01:00:33.414, Speaker D: Is like, oh, yeah, I forgot to mention what I did since then. Yeah, sorry. Yeah, I joined BrainBot. We made a payment tunnel network layer, what they call now L2. But I left that position at some point. And then I started my own company, which is like a privacy preserving portfolio tracker and accounting tool for Ethereum and many other blockchains. And yeah, that's what I'm doing right now.
01:00:33.414 - 01:00:34.600, Speaker D: Like my own thing.
01:00:35.210 - 01:00:58.558, Speaker E: I want to add one small thing, which was a hard thing, is we kept the name Slocket and continue to do Slocket. This was like the decision, like, should we now say, well, this is over. After what happened, many people told us, burn down Slockit. You can create a new company if you want. You can even have the same co founders do even the same thing, but don't use Slockit anymore. That's like, over. And we make this decision to not do this, to stand with the name.
01:00:58.558 - 01:01:24.454, Speaker E: Even though the Dao happened and all of this stuff, even the co founders stayed together. You made right after the Dao decision, we did some consulting. I even saw Chris wearing a suit and going to us to a company in Berlin, just selling our time, basically. And Stefan Tual had a task to try to get an investment. And if he would not have gotten an investment, I think we would have shut it down maybe six or twelve months later.
01:01:24.652 - 01:02:04.094, Speaker C: Yeah, I think we all had it really easy. Honestly, I feel bad for Stefan Tuol. Like, Stefan really got the worst, and it's unjustified. I mean, I guess he kind of became the fall guy, which is just really sad. But he had already kind of had tenuous relationships with other people, and he did make huge mistakes at the end when everything was falling apart. So I think we all had it easy, especially me, because I was publicly known as part of the White Hat Group and left. Harris wasn't publicly known as the White Hat Group, and obviously Christoph wasn't so involved as a wise decision.
01:02:04.094 - 01:02:43.278, Speaker C: He has family and stuff. I don't have any of those know, so I can be a lot more risky. Yeah, so I had it really easy. There was lots of love being thrown my way and Jordy's way the whole time because we were publicly known as fighting day in and day out to save the Dow the best that we could. And Jordy and I actually continued to work together to start a few different orgs, went to DevCon Two and all that stuff. But I think it was after DevCon we started Giveth and we took a lot of the lessons from the Dao. We created a minime token contract that kind of took a lot of the learnings that we had and applied them.
01:02:43.278 - 01:03:32.462, Speaker C: Okay, if we want to create Dows for charity that could eventually even replace government services, then we're going to need secure, like people need to be running their own servers and stuff like that. So we found a DAP node and Jordy is now really focused on doing Zkevm, which is like a roll up that you can run smart contracts on. And I'm still focused on Giveth, and I've also spun out more technical token engineering focused solutions through the common stack. And so Giveth is like really pointed at nonprofits and the Common Stack is trying to take techniques of funding public goods using token engineering and apply it with the nerds of the nerds kind of applied research. And then we hope to pull that into Giveth. So that's what we're working on.
01:03:32.596 - 01:04:27.394, Speaker A: So a couple of things. So one thing I want to say is people should definitely read the book to find out about the Stefan Twelve situation that is chronicled kind of how people perceived him and what happened to him. But one thing that I have to say before I ask you guys the next question is just thank you so much for giving me so much of your time and energy to tell this story as accurately as I could. Because it was a lot of time that you guys gave me because obviously, just on a technical level, this was probably the hardest, for sure, part of the book that I had to describe for people. I mean, I'd been covering crypto for years at the point when I was reporting this and I had never come across a lot of the things that I was having to explain at this part in the book. So thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you for helping me with that because I just would not have been able to do it without your help. Okay.
01:04:27.394 - 01:05:08.590, Speaker A: So we went through this whole thing together, all these hours of interviews, and I was working on your story, and then the book was going to come out. And very late in the process, when kind of the book was basically done, suddenly there was this break that happened where my sources and I thought that we had figured out who was behind the Dow attack. So I reached out to you all about this and thank you for keeping that secret between then and when the book actually published because I know that's kind of a long time to keep a secret like that. So when I told you that I thought we had found the person and I presented the evidence, what were your thoughts and feelings?
01:05:09.250 - 01:05:48.618, Speaker D: Okay, let me start then. Yeah, I was surprised. I never expected to hear about Dow hacker. I just had given up completely on finding out who it is. To be honest, the saplot that you mentioned for me still is the most stressful part. I just thought, okay, the hacker did what he did. Okay, but to see the name that you gave there and to remember all our conversations, especially the conversations in Reddit that we had after the hack and during the Dao Wars, to actually think that I was talking to the guy who did the actual hack, pretending that he is trying to help us.
01:05:48.784 - 01:06:01.520, Speaker A: Oh wait, so that's what I didn't understand in the reddit messages with Toby. Is that what you're talking about? You thought that he was trying to help you? Oh, interesting. Because whatever the original post was, was not clear.
01:06:03.170 - 01:06:18.146, Speaker D: Yes, it was probably something about I don't remember exactly, but some of the attacks that we did and asked him to not go into details or I don't really remember because he deleted everything later and there is no links to the posts anymore.
01:06:18.338 - 01:06:39.034, Speaker A: Yeah, but actually, you know what? I came across something where I think this came out after my article came out. It was something about oh, actually I can't remember where I came across this. I think his idea was to break this split mechanism. I think that's what it was. I don't know how I figured this out. I can't remember. I've had the craziest week.
01:06:39.034 - 01:06:42.414, Speaker A: So at some point in the last few days I think I came across this.
01:06:42.612 - 01:07:21.658, Speaker D: But anyway, could be, but we were talking about something and he was giving hints out and he basically gave them to us. No, he gave them in public and I think I told him not to do that. And then the last message that I have from him, I think I don't even have it in the book was I'm sorry if I messed things up. And that's it in the conversation with the attacker or something like that. I'm sorry if I messed things up for you in Daws and something like that. It's crazy to actually think that this guy pretended to and he was talking about the hacking in the third person. Which of course if you don't want to say that you're the hacker, that's what you do, but yeah, I never expected this.
01:07:21.658 - 01:07:39.386, Speaker D: I would not have expected this because, I don't know, I really thought that the guy who was the hacker would have been like, precision strike, just do his thing, disappear, not stay. And I mean, as you wrote in the thing, he was trolling after he was being kind of an asshole.
01:07:39.418 - 01:07:39.614, Speaker A: Right.
01:07:39.652 - 01:07:53.970, Speaker D: So I really had the hacker, the original one, in a bit higher regard, kind of a guy who just did his thing, disappeared, and that's it. Like Satoshi. But you telling me who Satoshi is? Yeah. So that's how I felt.
01:07:54.550 - 01:08:20.140, Speaker C: Totally. I completely agree. I feel like it almost took away the mystery. That was almost kind of enjoyable to oh, no one knows who the Dow hacker is. It's really hard. I haven't looked at the evidence yet, like, in depth. I've been in Denver and doing my thing for the conference here, but it's really hard to prove unless he straight up says, oh, yeah, it was me.
01:08:20.140 - 01:09:04.202, Speaker C: I feel like there's still a chance that it could just be some mistake that he's being thrown under the bus. And I hope that's not the case, and it's probably not. I really trust you, Laura, and your ability to you wouldn't go out without a real person, but at the time when you told just, I don't know, it feels like I almost wish it were just always going to stay a mystery forever. I didn't have any interactions with Toby. Toby was more of a developer, and we really divided and conquered. I worked with the non development side, so I think Christoph had probably a lot more internal reactions with it.
01:09:04.336 - 01:09:32.786, Speaker E: Well, I was also absolutely surprised. I did not expect this to come at all because I know that many people tried to find him. You know, the book by Matt Leising who really tried to and so that's why I thought, this is over. There was someone who really, really tried and didn't find him. So over. For me, it was more after the Dao hack, I did actually never care about him at all. Like, even during the time before the hard fork, it was for me like, okay, someone did it.
01:09:32.786 - 01:10:10.862, Speaker E: I cannot understand why I don't know him. I know that if he is sophisticated enough, technically he can stay anonymous forever. There are not coins out there which give you the privacy you need, and there are some ways to somehow cash out without revealing your identity. For me, this was like, you'll never know him. Also, all the messages we got in between, like, between the hack and the hard fork, I never 100% trusted if they were either true or also this could could completely be played. Even if he would say, I will give you the money back, this could be just like an attempt of making us do no work for another week or so. So that's why I actually completely ignored him.
01:10:10.862 - 01:11:00.158, Speaker E: I never tried to go after him. But nevertheless, there were some people actually even before you, this was a couple of months or weeks after the Dow, even after the Hartford, which came to us and say they think they know who it is. And they gave us some information from, I think it was from Poloniax where they tried to find some return address or actually who gave the Ether to fund the attack. And they gave us some company names. They gave us even some persons who say they think this is the one. But since I have not seen the evidence myself, I actually said I cannot blame him, I cannot do anything because I don't know, that might be true, maybe not. And I had contact with some of those people and so I also tried to not blame them, to not say, are you the hacker? I just completely ignored it.
01:11:00.158 - 01:11:31.382, Speaker E: And now you say you have much more evidence and I have not seen it personally. But as Chris said, I trust you, that you have done your job. You would not go out with an actual name if you're not 100% sure. So I just hope that I hope it's true for you that you don't tell anything which is not right. Of course I hope for him just the best. I mean, I have no feelings whatsoever towards him and of course he did something which destroyed a lot. Sometimes I thought about what would happen if he wouldn't have done this and I don't know if something good would have happened.
01:11:31.382 - 01:11:53.326, Speaker E: I just don't know. Maybe, yes, it's got big, lots of money in it. Many people get funded by it. Yes. Could also go in a completely wrong direction and it could be like billions in it today and something I would hate all my life. That's why I somehow was also relieved that the story was over. So I tried to not like since this is out of my control, I basically said, well, nothing I can do.
01:11:53.326 - 01:11:59.202, Speaker E: I don't understand the background. So I didn't really try to find him or anything. But yes, I was very surprised that you found him.
01:11:59.256 - 01:12:08.162, Speaker C: Yeah. The best part is that the people who were originally accused of being the Dow hacker no longer are free of that stagnant.
01:12:08.306 - 01:12:23.766, Speaker D: There was one conference where Terrace never accused. That's the thing publicly. Haven't read about that part of the book yet. Probably in chapter nine, I guess. Do you mention anything about your interaction.
01:12:23.798 - 01:12:27.082, Speaker A: With one of the suspects? Yeah, I wrote about it.
01:12:27.216 - 01:12:56.446, Speaker D: I actually have very friendly relations with one of the co founders of the original company. And he talked to me and said, no, there is no way. Later we came to know each other after that stuff and I mean, the evidence that was shown to us was not really it was a circumstantial. Yeah, sure. But as for the particular hacker, for Toby that was named. I'm actually really curious about the technical details.
01:12:56.638 - 01:12:59.186, Speaker C: Yeah, it'd be so cool to see.
01:12:59.208 - 01:13:03.094, Speaker D: His contract, how you guys found it. Yeah, that would be really interesting.
01:13:03.212 - 01:13:32.394, Speaker E: And also I'm glad that back then we didn't make it public who we thought it was and also not going to them because those guys actually invited me to a hackathon. They met them in Berlin. I was politely declining and didn't want to interact with them too much. But I never accused them. And I'm very happy for this today that I didn't. So that's why I think also knowing there are even people accusing Stefan Tual and even us, because I think we know what this is about. So I'm kind of glad that we have this out, that we know who it is and who it wasn't.
01:13:32.394 - 01:13:34.782, Speaker E: I think the who it wasn't is actually even more important.
01:13:34.916 - 01:13:46.178, Speaker C: Yeah, definitely. There was this one time where Jordy left. Harris and I are talking to one of the Dow hacker suspects at a conference and it was very civil. But we all FCC, right?
01:13:46.264 - 01:13:48.366, Speaker D: It was FCC, the first one.
01:13:48.488 - 01:13:52.646, Speaker C: We all felt really awkward about it. But they're doing good work, that's the thing.
01:13:52.748 - 01:13:53.254, Speaker D: Okay.
01:13:53.372 - 01:14:29.362, Speaker C: And I feel like even with honestly, like yes, he destroyed a lot of things, but personally, I hope that nothing bad happens to him because of this. Because in the end, the only people who lost in the Dow were the speculators. As much of the chaos that was there, everyone who had Dow tokens got ETH back, plus etc. It's the only hack I know of where everyone made money except for Slaka, of course. We got really screwed, but everyone else really made out okay. So I guess I just hope that nothing bad happens. He doesn't go to jail or anything.
01:14:29.362 - 01:14:31.700, Speaker C: I don't think it's necessary at this point.
01:14:32.070 - 01:15:07.118, Speaker E: It's hard to understand how we felt back then in terms of the cultural thinking. We never thought about going to court or asking a lawyer or anyone like this. It was still kind of funny money in some way, even though it had a real exchange curse. So it's not as criminal as if someone would have stolen that much in dollar. That's how it felt. And you could also understand this position of code is law and this bitcoin kind of thinking and kind of even not seeing anything wrong with doing this. I can understand this way of thinking and I think no court, no lawyer, no normal guy out there can understand how we thought back then.
01:15:07.118 - 01:15:18.340, Speaker E: That's why I think it's very hard to judge him today. Especially also in the amount of money, because you cannot really see how we thought back then. The ideology, the digitalization, all of this.
01:15:19.030 - 01:15:33.750, Speaker D: I don't know about that, but I have a very different opinion there. I never was code is law guy. I never thought that and I still don't. And there is many instances of still of DeFi hacks.
01:15:34.090 - 01:15:38.994, Speaker E: He did something bad. What he did was bad. I just want to give this perspective.
01:15:39.042 - 01:16:09.394, Speaker D: How we yeah, yeah, sure, I get that. But even back then I remember I still have the Dow code is Law green t shirt that you gave me. This is my reminder of that time. I never believe code is law. As a developer that scares me. If my code would be just makes absolutely I find it nonsensical. I hate the term and there is people who are using it today, I don't know if you know, the index finance guy.
01:16:09.394 - 01:16:43.770, Speaker D: So people today who steal money from companies and try to use Code is Law and they are going to court right now in Canada somewhere. For example, for me it's a very personal thing after the Dao and I think that if this field wants to go forward, code can't be law. It's my personal opinion and I really hope that basically he gets what he deserves. I don't know what that means, but I am not a forgiving person. It's not in my nature. I'm sorry.
01:16:43.920 - 01:16:54.174, Speaker E: Well, he did take other people money and he did have the opportunity back then to give it back several times and he did not do this. This is I think the most serious part about it.
01:16:54.292 - 01:17:17.622, Speaker D: Yeah, he could have done so many I think that you also mentioned in the book, in the epilogue, like grief's opinion on that, at least according to the book, it says that he could have done so much good and had ample time, like from the time of the hack until the hard fork. So many times we tried to contact you said there were posts that know asking him to come forward but yeah.
01:17:17.756 - 01:17:22.538, Speaker C: He still can send the etc back to the withdraw know, he still wait.
01:17:22.704 - 01:17:26.826, Speaker A: There is no withdrawal contract on the Ethereum Classic chain so he'd have to.
01:17:26.848 - 01:17:32.110, Speaker C: Convert it to the white hats. We still have this etc contract.
01:17:33.810 - 01:17:34.126, Speaker D: He.
01:17:34.148 - 01:17:38.654, Speaker C: Could still deposit etc into it and then all the Dow token holders could get it back.
01:17:38.692 - 01:17:45.918, Speaker D: If anybody is listening from anybody, whoever had the Dow tokens guys, you have etc there, you can go take a.
01:17:45.924 - 01:17:47.698, Speaker C: Lot of money sitting there, it's a.
01:17:47.704 - 01:17:52.306, Speaker D: Lot of money and just go take it's there, it's waiting for you.
01:17:52.328 - 01:18:28.910, Speaker A: Yeah, and by the way, if you are one of those people, please do that because I think that Griff is keeping a lot of Dow tokens in order to do any rescues that he might need to do and he would like to sell those Dow tokens in order to actually use that money for something else. So go ahead and take your etc. Okay. And one last thing I want to clarify earlier, just from some of your comments. I'm not going to say that I 100% for sure know that it was Toby Honish. What I was saying is the evidence is very good, and I presented it all so I wouldn't present it if I didn't think it was very strong. And the other sources who worked with me on this, they also believe it's strong.
01:18:28.910 - 01:19:05.980, Speaker A: And Chain analysis takes credit for that step of the demixing, which obviously that's a very complicated thing to do, and that's their little secret sauce that they finally revealed to the world. But from all the people who worked with me on this, we feel that the evidence is good. Okay, so last bit. This is just a funny, silly question, but people have already been saying things to me like, who should play which characters in the movie? So, by the way, just so you know, there is no movie yet, but people are saying this to me. So if that were the case, who would you want to either play you or who do you think should play the other members of this group?
01:19:06.350 - 01:19:13.210, Speaker E: Someone suggested online, not me. I should be played by I hope I pronounced it right. Jake Gillenhall.
01:19:13.290 - 01:19:15.098, Speaker A: Jake Gyllenhaal. Gyllenhaal.
01:19:15.194 - 01:19:20.480, Speaker E: Yes. It's not me. It's someone else on Twitter who proposed this idea. So I'm fine with that.
01:19:22.450 - 01:19:23.606, Speaker A: Love tars.
01:19:23.738 - 01:19:36.478, Speaker D: Now I reveal my complete lack of knowledge about American film actors. I have absolutely no idea. I know the big names, but I know Brad Pitt. I know. Like Bruce Willis.
01:19:36.654 - 01:19:39.038, Speaker C: Tom Cruise left tom Cruise or something.
01:19:39.144 - 01:19:42.326, Speaker D: I don't know. No Tom Cruise.
01:19:42.428 - 01:19:46.310, Speaker A: No. But Tom Cruise is probably, what, like 20 years older than Left Terrace?
01:19:47.530 - 01:19:49.786, Speaker D: Tom Cruise from the 80s, maybe.
01:19:49.968 - 01:19:56.874, Speaker C: Exactly. The one in the underwear sliding on the ground. Risky business guy. That's who I think you got.
01:19:57.072 - 01:19:58.780, Speaker A: Okay, griff, what about you?
01:19:59.310 - 01:20:05.774, Speaker C: People used to say, I don't have a man bun now, but I used to have hair that was kind of like Ashton Kutcher. And people used to say it looked.
01:20:05.812 - 01:20:17.838, Speaker A: Like had a you wore a man bun during the time of the Doubt attack. Because I wrote that in the book. Yeah, okay. But we could do Ashton Kutcher with a man bun.
01:20:17.934 - 01:20:23.442, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. Throw him with a man bun. I think he'd get the right vibes, too.
01:20:23.576 - 01:20:47.580, Speaker A: Okay. All right, well, you guys, thank you all so much for coming on the show. I'm sorry for some of the traumatic memories that we had to dredge up here, but I think also it was kind of fun to reminisce. It's been a while now, almost six years. So, yeah, I hope this was not painful and maybe somewhat fun.
01:20:48.030 - 01:20:58.510, Speaker E: And let's also not forget about all the other people who are not here in the call, like Stefan, Toile, Yordi, and many others who have played such an important role here and did so many things which are very helpful and good.
01:20:58.660 - 01:21:03.826, Speaker C: And honestly, we're all so busy people. It was just really nice to be in the same room with you guys. It's been too long.
01:21:03.928 - 01:21:14.500, Speaker D: Likewise. Yeah, likewise. It's really nice to see the two of you here, see your faces. I haven't seen you in quite a long time.
01:21:14.970 - 01:21:17.750, Speaker C: Yeah, it's like a reunion of old war buddies.
01:21:21.930 - 01:21:25.346, Speaker A: Okay. All right. Well, thank you all for coming on Unchained.
