00:00:00.250 - 00:00:34.470, Speaker A: I also think the UX of Solana overall is just nicer. It's just an easier place to hang out and so, you know, the applications built on Solana just seem just a little bit easier. And so the comparison, it's like Android versus Apple. It's like Solana feels like Apple. It's a closed system but it's very slick, very good, will create great loyalty. Ethereum is much broad order, much more open in terms of other things that can be built on top of it. So do you expect one of them to become more dominant? It's too early to tell.
00:00:34.470 - 00:00:57.530, Speaker A: I mean I would remain that ETH remains dominant because there is always innovation going on in ETH. It's not like it's a dead chain. So I just assume that the amount of smart people in the entire ETH ecosystem will bring break through after breakthrough. But I just think there's a big catch up in valuation terms of the Solana network versus east network.
