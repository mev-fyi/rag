00:00:15.320 - 00:00:35.640, Speaker A: So welcome, everybody. Welcome to the chopping block. Every couple weeks, usually, the four of us now the three of us and a special guest get together and give the industry insiders perspective on the crypto topics of the day. So quick intros. I'm going to go around. First off, we have Tarun, the gigabrain and grandpubad gauntlet. We have Robert, the crypto connoisseur and captain of compound.
00:00:35.640 - 00:00:50.500, Speaker A: There's myself Haseeb. I'm the head man at Dragonfly. And we have today special guest, Kyle, managing partner in multicoin. I did not think of a clever I like the sultan of solana is another name we could give.
00:00:50.570 - 00:00:53.760, Speaker B: You're really going for all in overlap.
00:00:53.920 - 00:01:08.456, Speaker A: All right, so very quickly, the four of us are early stage investors in crypto, but I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice, legal advice, or even life advice. Kyle, how are you doing, sir? You're the only one of us in shorts. Clearly, you are the Austin native.
00:01:08.648 - 00:01:09.996, Speaker C: It is 100 degrees outside.
00:01:10.098 - 00:01:10.824, Speaker A: It is pretty warm.
00:01:10.872 - 00:01:18.720, Speaker C: It's pretty toasty. So I'm in shorts and flip flops. Welcome to Austin, guys. Great to have an event here. I like, I'm used to traveling for events. Welcome to Austin.
00:01:19.300 - 00:01:40.656, Speaker A: It's been insanely hot. Austin's great in winter. Yeah, it is interesting. So consensus is usually in New York, which in the summer is like it's fine because it's mostly indoors. Doing a conference where you have to walk long distances to different venues outside in 100 degree weather is a very interesting choice.
00:01:40.688 - 00:01:42.016, Speaker B: Texas ninja warrior.
00:01:42.128 - 00:01:42.980, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly.
00:01:43.130 - 00:01:46.008, Speaker C: They should have done it a month ago, but yeah, June was not a good call.
00:01:46.094 - 00:01:53.980, Speaker A: Yeah, fair enough. Fair enough. Well, I know this is your home turf. You were just telling me about how you take a lot of your calls inside your pool.
00:01:55.280 - 00:01:56.750, Speaker C: I mean, it's hot outside.
00:01:57.440 - 00:02:00.830, Speaker B: That's why your video is never on during zoom. I see.
00:02:03.600 - 00:02:12.560, Speaker A: Well, if you were wearing swim trunks as well, he might turn it on. I can tell that Austin's been very good to you. You look great.
00:02:12.630 - 00:02:18.512, Speaker C: Thank you. Have fun. Y'all look great. Shelves. Seattle's weather is looking good.
00:02:18.566 - 00:02:23.236, Speaker A: Yeah, it's all right. It's up and down. It's up and down. I've been traveling so much. Yeah.
00:02:23.258 - 00:02:25.076, Speaker B: I was like, do you even live know?
00:02:25.098 - 00:02:50.300, Speaker A: I know it's been a lot, but it feels good to finally be in summer where at least in a bear market, it can be warm. You at least get a little bit of life in you. If it's just, like, cold and the whole market's collapsing, it's a little rough to take. But you were just telling me that you feel like people are way too somber about what's going on in macro. Why do you feel that way?
00:02:50.370 - 00:03:26.440, Speaker C: Yeah, I looked at the last two recessions, 2000 and 2008. 2000 more tech localized. In 2000, the Internet didn't really work super well, and most people, like normal people, genuinely believed computers and tech and Internet was kind of like meh in 2022. There's actually zero people in the world who do not believe that software is eating the world. Like, actually every human in the world understands this now. And so that's a pretty important thing of just like, things will come back, at least in the context of tech. I'm not necessarily broader macro.
00:03:26.440 - 00:04:02.932, Speaker C: And then second major difference is like, in 2008, people were like, is my bank going to have money in it tomorrow? And that was like a real question that people asked. There's no existential questions here, so I don't know. There's real growth rates going to slow down by two or 3% for 18 months. Okay, sure, but that's not that bad in the grand scheme of things. Clearly, March 2020 was much a scarier time because we were just like, I don't know, are we all going to die? And that was a question that people were contemplating. But today it's just like growth rates are marginally slower for some period. I don't know, it just doesn't seem that big of a deal.
00:04:03.066 - 00:04:09.030, Speaker A: How do you feel about the long term impact of higher interest rates? Or do you think interest rates are not going to be maintained at a higher level?
00:04:09.400 - 00:04:54.656, Speaker C: I mean, look, we're at what, 4% now, which I guess relative to the last two years is high, but on a historical, on any 30 year chart, it's still quite low. Interest rates have been generally declining for the last 100 years. Thousand years, 1000 years. Right. I don't think that maybe we just had the inflection point, the pandemic was the inflection point in that or something, I don't know. But I generally think the reason that's the case is as you democratize access to finance and access to capital, the universe of capital to invest in things is growing, which means rates of return are declining and society needs to find more productive ways to put stuff to money to work. And the rate at which financial capital is being unlocked to invest in things is clearly still accelerating.
00:04:54.656 - 00:05:02.128, Speaker C: And crypto actually is accelerating. So, like, I generally think interest rates are still trending down in the medium to long term.
00:05:02.304 - 00:05:13.496, Speaker A: So you see pretty much all of this is like, hey, it's short term, it's transient. There's like this stuff going on in Ukraine, there's supply chain issues, there's China going offline. When all this is resolved, it's back on and the party's going to continue.
00:05:13.598 - 00:05:14.516, Speaker C: Party never stopped.
00:05:14.548 - 00:05:18.812, Speaker A: Party never stopped. If you just come back to Austin, you realize the party's been going on the whole time.
00:05:18.866 - 00:05:23.884, Speaker B: I was amazed at the sheer number of people at this thing compared to the last one I went to.
00:05:24.002 - 00:05:25.080, Speaker A: The last consensus.
00:05:25.160 - 00:05:25.596, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:05:25.698 - 00:05:27.564, Speaker A: How many people were at the last one?
00:05:27.762 - 00:05:30.960, Speaker B: Definitely not 16,000 or whatever the number that was claimed here.
00:05:31.030 - 00:05:33.968, Speaker A: Yeah, true. I mean, permissionless was like 8000, I think.
00:05:34.134 - 00:05:36.752, Speaker C: Was it? Yeah. That did not feel like that big of an event.
00:05:36.886 - 00:05:41.888, Speaker A: It was pretty big. I think so. And then East Denver was like 15,000, if I recall.
00:05:41.984 - 00:05:45.424, Speaker B: Right. Well, I mean, they did take three city blocks of lines.
00:05:45.472 - 00:05:46.740, Speaker A: I know, that was crazy.
00:05:46.810 - 00:05:49.270, Speaker C: The hotel lobby could hold like 300 people.
00:05:50.440 - 00:05:54.520, Speaker D: It's amazing that there's more people at this conference than there are D Five users.
00:05:56.940 - 00:06:00.040, Speaker A: That might be the reason why our portfolios are all down, unfortunately.
00:06:00.940 - 00:06:01.992, Speaker C: Robert, fix it, please.
00:06:02.046 - 00:06:11.628, Speaker B: Wait, I'm working on it. Only thing, crypto has the most product market fit for throwing events that may it might be the number one product.
00:06:11.714 - 00:06:42.436, Speaker A: You got to respect the people who like, look, bear market, bull market, they're always making money because they're throwing crypto parties. Yeah, and it's a good business. But speaking of which, I actually remember there were some folks during Permissionless, so permissionless. It was a crypto conference that took place the week after the terra collapse. And I remember obviously the whole world was like, oh, my God, what is going on? Crypto is ending. There were talks about people killing themselves and people losing tons of money and whatever. And so it was a really somber time.
00:06:42.436 - 00:07:10.672, Speaker A: And I remember Permissionless was just around the corner and I was slated to go and one of our portfolio companies was throwing a yacht party at Permissionless. And of course this stuff gets booked way in advance and you have to do a lot of setup. And so they were telling us, like, hey, guys, we'd love for you to come to our yacht party. And I was like, dudes, it's a bad time to throw a yacht party. A lot of people lost a lot of money. It's like kind of a somber time for the industry. Also, if the press sees this, they're going to have a field day with it.
00:07:10.672 - 00:07:17.090, Speaker A: So I can already see the headlines. And they were like, oh, yeah, see, that's a really good point. We'll make sure not to invite any press.
00:07:20.360 - 00:07:21.904, Speaker C: No one will post photos on Instagram.
00:07:21.952 - 00:07:35.320, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. And that's crypto in a nutshell. Which is why I respect the crypto party people, because they understand that that's the true ethos of crypto is just to have a good time nihilist wherever prices are going. Of a kind.
00:07:35.390 - 00:07:59.712, Speaker B: I'm just surprised we didn't see in the last cycle, we saw a lot of these kind of mainly useless tokens like brain trust. Not to single anyone that's really standing out, but they have some offline event or labor thing somehow tied and like crypto somehow even though the events keep going, there's no event token. No one has tried this crypto event.
00:07:59.766 - 00:08:00.352, Speaker A: People tried.
00:08:00.406 - 00:08:03.484, Speaker C: There's a desk token here proof of attendance.
00:08:03.612 - 00:08:06.332, Speaker D: Tokens are vaguely event tokens.
00:08:06.396 - 00:08:14.580, Speaker B: That's true, that's true. But they're not like these frenzy. Brain trust was a frenzy for a little while before it crashed to Earth, right?
00:08:14.650 - 00:08:19.808, Speaker A: Yeah, it hasn't been monetized so much. Poaps are a thing. But I don't feel like I don't.
00:08:19.824 - 00:08:21.668, Speaker B: Think Patricio would be happy if poaps.
00:08:21.684 - 00:08:27.144, Speaker C: Were monetized poaps soulbound. I assume they're soulbound or is that ERC not approved or EIP not approved yet?
00:08:27.182 - 00:08:38.456, Speaker B: No, not I think soulbound NFTs was a pretty poor choice of marketing personally. Also, I don't think the idea helps.
00:08:38.488 - 00:08:50.860, Speaker A: That very quickly define soulbound. So soulbound is an NFT that is basically not transferable. So you give it to someone and only that person can have it, they can't move it to another address. So why do you think soulbound NFTs are bad marketing?
00:08:51.020 - 00:09:14.724, Speaker B: Oh, I mean, you're just basically saying, like, hey, why don't we reinvent identity but call it soul bound, which to probably like a ton of religious people, feels like there's probably some religious person in the world who's like, that's a fucking attack on my religion because your soul should be free. Or there is enough people on this planet who believe in enough crazy shit that there's got to be.
00:09:14.762 - 00:09:33.356, Speaker A: I actually think it's great marketing because of the fact that we're all talking about it. There's a lot of blog posts Vitalik has written about that I've never talked about with anyone, but it feels like everybody wants to talk about Silver Band NFTs all of a sudden because they wrote this. But also, just like, the idea itself is clearly interesting to people, it's just.
00:09:33.378 - 00:09:46.032, Speaker C: Such a simple idea. Simplicity is good, but this is beyond. Of course there will be NFTs that are not revocable and not transferable and I don't know why that concept needed more explanation or thinking.
00:09:46.086 - 00:10:40.960, Speaker B: Well, I think they also have some voting component to it where it has some notion of quadratic voting built in, which I don't totally understand because there's not a fungible token attached to it, but it was like a way of like if you use them in conjunction with the fungible token, you could somehow get right. The main thing was like, to prevent civil attacks in these Gitcoin like systems, right? Yeah, because there's tons of that Gitcoin in general and so I think their application was for that, but then of course, it mainly was portrayed as like non transferable NFT. Well, yeah, no shit. Everyone who said the word did, which is like Bitcoin, Maxis and Microsoft, I don't know if you remember the did spec that was supposed to be the digital identity spec, which would write some amount of data to Bitcoin every hundred blocks. It's never happened. But that thing is a soul bound.
00:10:41.480 - 00:11:05.884, Speaker D: Well, I think people forget that addresses and private keys are transferable. We brought this up on the show like three or four episodes ago when we were talking about the Apecoin Land sale and people were buying other people's addresses in order to participate. Private keys are easily transferred. I think soul bound is a crazy term because it's not actually bound to an individual, it's bound to an address. And addresses are more transferable than people.
00:11:05.922 - 00:11:24.864, Speaker A: Think, true, that's true. At the same time, I don't know, I find it hard to get worked up over these things because I'm just like, look, if soulband NFTs are a good idea, someone will find an application for it and we'll all benefit from it. But probably we're not going to be calling it Soulbound NFTs. We'll just be like, oh, that thing that we all use.
00:11:24.982 - 00:11:33.572, Speaker B: I mean, I think the average user will see it from something like Gitcoin where it's like, how do you distribute funding in a way that's not whales taking advantage of it?
00:11:33.706 - 00:11:48.676, Speaker A: Right. But I think it's pretty clear that, look, if you're going to create an actual KYC solution, it should not be soul bound because people rotate addresses, right. Or people have multiple addresses or they have multi six or they have whatever, or they lose an address and then they're like, okay, well, I still exist even though I lost my address.
00:11:48.698 - 00:11:52.990, Speaker B: I think the argument is like, you have to build up reputation to that particular.
00:11:54.080 - 00:12:06.108, Speaker A: Right. But I think clearly, like, the right notion of identity, the notion of identity will be using in 15 years on chain, whatever the hell that looks like. Clearly we'll be able to survive losing a private key.
00:12:06.194 - 00:12:06.540, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:12:06.610 - 00:12:15.090, Speaker A: Right. So if your idea of a soul bound NFT or identity is that it is tied to one private key forever and you build it up over 15 years, that's just not going to work.
00:12:15.940 - 00:12:36.692, Speaker B: Yeah, that's true. I assume it's just going to be some weird Oracle service like C, Lance, something like CNN. So Sealance is this like Matthew Green, this cryptographer from like a it's like a Zkyc solution where people can verify some subset of facts.
00:12:36.756 - 00:12:37.860, Speaker A: They can selectively prove.
00:12:37.940 - 00:12:46.472, Speaker B: Yeah, they can selectively prove certain types of queries from off chain attesters like the DMV or something.
00:12:46.526 - 00:12:46.696, Speaker A: Right?
00:12:46.718 - 00:12:47.290, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:12:47.920 - 00:12:53.852, Speaker B: This type of stuff seems way more close to actual identity than any of these things.
00:12:53.906 - 00:13:16.916, Speaker A: Yeah, certainly. So, okay, I want to jump into the meat of things. So first off is that I've been informed that there is a long standing beef between Kyle and Robert. And I don't know the nature of this beef, but I'd love to uncover some of the pain that's been scabbed over.
00:13:17.018 - 00:13:22.132, Speaker C: When he mentioned to me before the show, I was like, what is he talking about? It took me like 3 seconds for it to even come.
00:13:22.266 - 00:13:24.356, Speaker A: Robert knew. Robert knew.
00:13:24.458 - 00:13:25.972, Speaker C: I mean, you want to take it away, Robert?
00:13:26.036 - 00:13:29.300, Speaker D: I feel like Haseeb is trying to create drama on the show to get like, clicks.
00:13:29.380 - 00:13:30.036, Speaker C: We need ratings.
00:13:30.068 - 00:13:31.000, Speaker B: We need ratings.
00:13:32.780 - 00:13:34.910, Speaker A: I can see the view count it is going through.
00:13:35.680 - 00:13:37.550, Speaker C: It is working in real time.
00:13:38.400 - 00:14:03.110, Speaker D: No, the only possible beef is that very early on in DeFi, when Compound was one of the very first apps, no one knew how the industry would unfold. No one knew what would work and what would not work and what the final form factor would be. In fact, we still don't know what the final form factor for DeFi is going to be and how it's going to work. But Multicoin had one or two ideas that Compound was not going to be how it works.
00:14:05.320 - 00:14:22.952, Speaker C: We invested in DeForest. Actually, I think it was like March 2020. It was very right around the time of Pandemic starting. And the DeForest team did. Fork compound V one. There was a bug that was exploited shortly thereafter based on some I forget, token contracts back ERC, seven.
00:14:23.006 - 00:14:25.000, Speaker D: Tokens are complex, right?
00:14:25.070 - 00:14:25.690, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:14:28.880 - 00:14:51.316, Speaker C: So we did fund them. Our thesis, we put it on our blog. It's still on our blog, so go check it out. Two years later. But basically it was like a Chinese super app was basically the thesis. And we had a view back then, and I still think we hold today that generally Americans will not build stuff that Chinese people interact with, and Chinese people will generally not build stuff that Americans will interact with. I think that's generally, consensus ish not strictly true, but generally true.
00:14:51.316 - 00:15:03.480, Speaker C: And so our view was like, these guys are going to go build stuff for Chinese. Retail obviously didn't work out super well. And Compound has thrived. And also there's like 50 compound forks now.
00:15:03.550 - 00:15:03.880, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:15:03.950 - 00:15:05.690, Speaker C: So you guys have great company. A month.
00:15:08.140 - 00:15:13.128, Speaker A: Okay, well, I guess you guys we started that was very sweet. I saw just a little spark of love.
00:15:13.214 - 00:15:14.904, Speaker D: There's always been some spark of love here.
00:15:14.942 - 00:15:24.460, Speaker C: There's always been. And I want to say it was probably nine months later or something, you and I started to re engage on Telegram or Twitter or like, it's fine now.
00:15:24.530 - 00:15:26.456, Speaker D: Crypto is a small space when you really boil.
00:15:26.488 - 00:15:32.204, Speaker A: It true, it's true. But I feel like, Kyle, you tend to have run ins at some point with almost everybody in crypto.
00:15:32.252 - 00:15:32.608, Speaker C: Everyone?
00:15:32.694 - 00:15:53.172, Speaker A: Yeah. There's like almost no way. I mean, you've been doing this so long that just a boomer now, I think all of us at this point. Yeah. Once you stop shaving for these things, that's how you know that. You're like last gen? Yeah, I'm like, Shit, I actually shaved this morning.
00:15:53.226 - 00:15:54.612, Speaker D: Are you zoomer, Jen? Which gen?
00:15:54.666 - 00:15:57.744, Speaker A: I guess I'm trying. I'm trying. That's why alpha gen alpha.
00:15:57.872 - 00:15:58.870, Speaker C: Make it there.
00:15:59.660 - 00:16:06.152, Speaker B: Do you agree or disagree with Flank statement fashion NFTs will be the future of fashion.
00:16:06.296 - 00:16:08.988, Speaker A: I don't even know what that means. I'm trying to parse that statement and.
00:16:08.994 - 00:16:23.280, Speaker B: It'S not I'm just telling you that there's so many people who are arguing that or like so many people. It's not so many people. It's some weird niche zoomer thing I see about their metaverse character having like.
00:16:23.350 - 00:16:26.256, Speaker A: I think it will be true to some extent. I think it'll be true to some.
00:16:26.278 - 00:16:30.496, Speaker B: Extent, but not I view the answer to this question as the categorical divide.
00:16:30.528 - 00:16:32.340, Speaker A: Between boomer and zoomer.
00:16:33.800 - 00:16:35.430, Speaker C: I like this litmus test.
00:16:38.600 - 00:16:56.052, Speaker A: We were supposed to get Anatole on the show, and Anatoly wasn't able to make it because he's in Korea doing stuff. So, Kyle, obviously you are the seed investor in Solana. You are known by many people as being the first investor to throw your weight and throw your no tattoo intellectual force.
00:16:56.116 - 00:16:59.068, Speaker C: No tattoo, yeah, that we can if.
00:16:59.074 - 00:17:14.908, Speaker A: You go to his pool parties, you get to see the tattoo, but otherwise we don't get to grace our viewers with that quite yet. So we naturally had, at various times on the show, we've been critical of Solana at times, occasionally, very rarely.
00:17:15.004 - 00:17:22.768, Speaker B: I, for the record, am the one who is always making sure that these kind of very X is always way better than Y.
00:17:22.854 - 00:18:05.776, Speaker A: Claims are hedged, to be clear, to be Solana. I think Solana is awesome. We've made a lot of investments on top of Solana, but I also think it's made a lot of mistakes that it's now paying for, and one of the obvious components of that. So I think we had Andre on, like, what was it a month ago? I think we had Andre on Andre, basically, he made some claim about Solana that Solana is not even a blockchain, it's just like a database and blah, blah, blah. And so we were like, okay, we should bring on somebody who's pro Solana to go and give the counterpoint. I don't necessarily need to respond to that because it's obviously kind of an outlandish claim, but in the last part of the storyline about Salana, so Salana obviously is down alongside everything else. It's down quite a lot.
00:18:05.776 - 00:18:12.148, Speaker A: From the peak, it's down like 30 something dollars now, and at the peak, it was like 240. So it's down, what, 80 plus percent.
00:18:12.234 - 00:18:13.268, Speaker D: In line with the market.
00:18:13.354 - 00:18:50.572, Speaker A: In line with the market. And most altel ones are also suffered roughly the same fade. The thing about Salana, though, is that it's had very, very spotty uptime. So this year alone, my understanding is that we've had twelve periods of downtime in this year, and it's June, so basically about twice a month. And the most recent downtimes, which is give the TLDR. There was basically a bug with what's called durable transactions on Solana. And so durable transaction is when normally on Solana, when you want to send a transaction, you don't use a nonce the way you use on Ethereum, which is like, this is my first transaction, this is my second transaction, this is my third transaction.
00:18:50.572 - 00:19:27.084, Speaker A: So that the blockchain knows, even if it gets it out of order, what order in which you intended to play these transactions. In Solana, what you do is you specify a particular block, and you can only sort of do that once. That's how you dedup transactions to make sure you don't get repeats. But if you're offline, if you're in cold storage and you're in a clean room, you don't know what the last block hash was. So you can't include a block hash. So Solana has a mechanism for you to do what are called durable nonces, which is a way for you to sign a transaction in a clean room, take it out even if you don't know what the state of the blockchain is. There's a bug in durable nonces which caused consensus failure in Solana and it went down for like 6 hours or something.
00:19:27.084 - 00:20:01.044, Speaker A: Solana's back up. They disabled this feature, but by disabling this feature, they plan to reinstate it once they do the next upgrade. But by disabling this feature that caused most of the custodians that actually hold Solana in cold storage and do this kind of clean room shit to be unable to move Solana anymore. So like Coinbase Custody, we got a notification that I ended up posting on Twitter that Coinbase Custody can't move Solana. They can take know Solana staked is still being staked, but they can't move it. So your Solana is now stuck. If it's in a custodian or a similar environment where you need durable transactions.
00:20:01.092 - 00:20:01.850, Speaker B: Is that.
00:20:05.660 - 00:20:20.492, Speaker A: Mean you can short so you can at least, if you feel like it's not blockchain for you, you can remove your exposure to it. But yeah, I'm curious to get your take on the situation about the stability of Salana that we've seen this year.
00:20:20.626 - 00:21:00.250, Speaker C: Yeah. So I'm going to zoom out and provide a different framework on how I think about this problem. So Bitcoin, the ideology that has driven Bitcoin for most of the last ten years has been fairly libertarian, digital gold, almost pseudo anarchy kind of a thing, right? And obviously there was the block size debate in 2016 17 and the obviously small blockers won and really strongly reaffirmed the very conservative roadmap change. Nothing, no hard forks, et cetera. Ethereum is not as extreme in that hard incentive beliefs as Bitcoin, but is directionally aligned with slow changes. Very slow. Don't break it.
00:21:00.250 - 00:21:54.970, Speaker C: I think actually the litmus test of the Ethereum ideology is assume all the core developers die today, every single one of them, everyone in the world, the system has to run in perpetuity. Right? And I think that's kind of the bar that they hold themselves to it every time they release an upgrade, they kind of operate with the same think. I think that's one of the core kind of ideological differences is like Solana's Worldview and Anatoly's Worldview is look, it's going to take us some number of years to get to where we want to go. Just get there as fast as humanly possible and make a bunch of mistakes along the way. It's fine, but don't assume that the entire engineering team will die in 24 hours. I think that's kind of product management ideology difference A, I think then B, it's kind of like diving down a little more narrowly is when we were I was obviously pretty close to the Solana team as they launched two years ago. And when we launched blockchain, the concern was no one will ever use this thing.
00:21:54.970 - 00:22:42.170, Speaker C: That was by far the most important concern. And when they launched it, there was a bunch of known stability problems and they worked through most of them. There's obviously still some other stuff they have to do, but once the blockchain was generally functioning, their priority of all of the people there was to drive usage and started working with the serum team and did a lot of DeFi stuff. The first few hackathons were all very DeFi oriented and building out whatever SPL stuff and whatever else they had to do. Then they turned their energy towards Metaplex and NFTs and did that spot on Metaplex. Then they did Solana pay? They have a couple of other cool new projects they're working on, but they've generally been expending their resources explicitly on trying to drive growth to get people to use the blockchain. Inevitably as you drive people to use the blockchain, they will use the blockchain and inevitably things break.
00:22:42.170 - 00:23:15.700, Speaker C: Generally in the history of software, every time you scale a system ten X, as a rule of thumb, something breaks somewhere, reads, writes, stability, whatever. Right? This is kind of like a known thing. So I think what you're seeing now is you're seeing the cost of the decisions that were made over the last several years, which was prioritized growth over known. But they knew they needed to do free markets. They didn't do them. The durable nonsting was known several weeks before it happened to fail like a few days ago. So these were known decisions that were made ahead of time.
00:23:15.700 - 00:23:16.464, Speaker C: Consciously.
00:23:16.512 - 00:23:23.560, Speaker A: Hold on, but I'm pretty sure that Anatoly has argued with me on Twitter that Solana should not have fee markets.
00:23:24.300 - 00:23:26.072, Speaker C: I mean, fee markets are shipping like.
00:23:26.126 - 00:23:38.072, Speaker A: Now know, I know because they faced a lot of criticism about the lack of but like for a long time this was an intentional design choice. It's not like, oh whoops, we forgot to fee.
00:23:38.216 - 00:23:41.100, Speaker C: Right? But like they change your mind. Like, okay, like we need that fee.
00:23:42.240 - 00:24:20.596, Speaker A: I mean, clearly Salon is adapting to the fact that, hey, we're seeing the way in which this thing is breaking at the margin. Yes, and we need to adapt around it. But correct the story that you're telling is one that, look, basically we move fast and break things. We're intentionally prioritizing adoption over stability. But it does seem to me like this also is not just a story about usage. It's definitely a story about usage in that there are a lot of blockchains that exist today that have hidden weaknesses that will only be exposed when they face really serious usage. And a lot of things are going to break when they receive the kind of load that Solana receives.
00:24:20.596 - 00:24:32.620, Speaker A: So I think that's definitely true and I take your point on that. But it also does seem true that Solana is probably breaking more than it should. Yes, that also seems true.
00:24:32.690 - 00:24:33.020, Speaker C: Yes.
00:24:33.090 - 00:24:41.664, Speaker A: And I'm curious, it seems like you agree with that. Yes. Why do you think that is?
00:24:41.782 - 00:25:21.756, Speaker C: Yeah, one element of problems emerging in downtime is usage grew and that caused you to have problems. But the related part of the in the point I was kind of getting at was like for the last two and a half years, the primary engineering resources have been there's a bunch of known things they want to do to improve stability and fees and whatever, and they just said, kick that can down the road. Spend energy on trying to drive growth. And so it's just been like a very conscious decision of focus on getting more people to use it instead of identify like going after known bugs. And quite frankly, I agree with that decision. I think that was absolutely the right decision. You can argue that today it maybe no longer is the right decision and that's a pretty reasonable debate to have.
00:25:21.756 - 00:25:36.460, Speaker C: Obviously you have to play out lots of counterfactuals of how the world works out and those are difficult to reason about. But certainly at least for the first 18, if not 24 months after the network launched, which the network is 26 months old, I think absolutely was the right decision to focus on growth.
00:25:36.540 - 00:25:37.744, Speaker A: I mean, it's clearly succeeded. Right?
00:25:37.782 - 00:25:38.224, Speaker C: Right.
00:25:38.342 - 00:25:44.688, Speaker A: Is obviously extremely valuable. Tons of people use it. It's one of the few things that people even know as layer one blockchains besides Ethereum.
00:25:44.784 - 00:26:00.804, Speaker C: Yeah. So again, this comes back to the core question actually. You kind of alluded to with Andre too, of like what's a blockchain? And again, if you assume the entire engineering team will die today and the system must run in perpetuity, if that's your definition of blockchain, then sLun is not a blockchain. But that's fine. That's just not a useful definition.
00:26:00.932 - 00:26:02.170, Speaker A: What do you mean by that?
00:26:03.020 - 00:26:13.176, Speaker C: Again, if Ethereum today, if the entire EF and core teams and all the teams around the EF assume all of them disappeared right now yeah. Ethereum in its current form will run probably in perpetuity.
00:26:13.208 - 00:26:18.700, Speaker A: Yeah, so I understand that point. I'm just saying why would you say that Solana is not a blockchain if the devs die?
00:26:19.280 - 00:26:25.504, Speaker C: There's a bunch of these things. The fee markets are not live yet. Right. There's a bunch of things that they know that they need to get working to scale this thing.
00:26:25.542 - 00:26:28.288, Speaker D: The blockchain will stop in like two weeks, whatever.
00:26:28.374 - 00:26:29.328, Speaker C: Something will go wrong.
00:26:29.414 - 00:26:29.836, Speaker A: I see.
00:26:29.878 - 00:26:45.796, Speaker C: And it will stop working. And I think that's okay, fix the ship. The corollary to Ethereum is like, okay, you have a thing that doesn't go down. But also it's been seven years and is the scaling stuff going to work? I don't know. So you'd have to take the other side of the same coin.
00:26:45.828 - 00:26:46.730, Speaker A: Right, right.
00:26:47.420 - 00:27:23.380, Speaker D: This is a trade off for almost every. Project in some form between the ability to evolve versus stability. And you see it with Solana, you see it with Compound, you see it with Bitcoin. Every different project ever makes some choice of where it wants to be on the pendulum. And sometimes it's the right call, sometimes it's the wrong call. I think compound doesn't move fast enough because it's more stable and more resilient than possibly the market should be. Solana is more flexible and we'll see what the right decisions are.
00:27:23.450 - 00:28:13.472, Speaker A: Yeah, look, I agree with the core point, which is that all this stuff is trade offs all the way down and there's no free lunch that you can get. You can make the best calculation that you can, but eventually you have to pay everything down, right? So you can cut some corners in order to get faster performance, better go to market, better growth, but you have to pay everything back at some point. The question is, what's the price when you have to pay it back? And when you become really big, of course the price becomes significant because when you're a small little blockchain, people don't really care. They don't really care if you're down. For you're one of the largest blockchains in existence, which Solana is today, of course it's disruptive to a lot of DeFi. There's a lot of TVL, there's a lot of oracles that go down, there's a lot of blah, blah. So the disruption becomes bigger.
00:28:13.472 - 00:29:02.740, Speaker A: And you're right, it is tricky. And we're not going to know for another three to four years what the record is going to show in retrospect. But one of the questions that we got on Twitter was actually asking about your investment into Aptos. So Aptos for just very quick TLDR. Aptos is one of the blockchain teams that spun out of the Slash, whatever teams, they're basically building the blockchain that Facebook was going to build, that was going to be called Libra took, the tech are improving it and they're going to launch their own layer one blockchain. It's intended to be very high performance, similar in principle at least, to Solana. So the kernel of the question was one, what motivated your investment into Aptos? But kind of the direction that I'd want to take it is, do you think the exact same things will happen to Aptos?
00:29:04.280 - 00:29:33.100, Speaker C: Cool. So I'll answer the latter first. Yes. Generally, Aptos has the luxury of like, they just had an enormous engineering team with effectively unlimited money for quite some time. That probably will be good for just fewer problems down the road. Solana before network launch, those guys are running out of like, we let us around to keep them alive. Obviously they didn't have that problem at Diem, so they have some luxuries there that are likely to pay dividends in the future.
00:29:33.100 - 00:30:08.964, Speaker C: Counterfactual cases of things not going down, but directionally, I'll make an extreme statement. Every single layer one or L2, without question, will go down substantially both on the writes and the reads over the next several years as they try and scale. Something will go wrong in the provers, something will go wrong in the sequencers. Like it won't just be even RPC layer. Every single one of these things is going to have very embarrassing face flops in some form or fashion. Totally agree, because scaling reads is one thing and that's kind of RPC side, but scaling all the writes is like a whole separate set of problems. That was question two.
00:30:08.964 - 00:31:09.656, Speaker C: Question one why do we invest in app this? The answer is like we like that it looks like salana. There's all this talk about modular blockchains and L1s and L two S. I don't think L two S have a place in the world and I think they will be used for some stuff. I am quite confident L two S are not the savior to everything and so generally I want to maximize throughput at layer one and then we'll see what level two stuff happens common A and then comment B on why we did aptis. I think one of the things that helps a lot be successful is that it has a unique programming model and has Rust, although knowing Rust alone is not enough to program in Solana. You need to learn the Solana account systems and data models and whatever. But one theory I have is that being an EVM chain is actually value destructive because people just copy paste code from Eflare one and paste it in new places and you don't get truly organic developer communities with real intellectual capital forming and building Solana.
00:31:09.656 - 00:31:36.180, Speaker C: You had to have that happen. And they took some set of opinions and trade offs and whatever, how the system does stuff and compute and whatever. And Move is taking a new set of differentiated opinions on how the core programming model should work. I actually don't know if those opinions are good or bad. I don't actually care. What I care is that they're different and they seem to prioritize safety in making it harder to write bad bugs. It's pretty clear that as crypto enters mainstream, more and more developers will be writing smart contract code.
00:31:36.180 - 00:32:02.700, Speaker C: A lot of those developers will be scared that they will write the bug, the line of code that causes a 500 million dollar thing to blow up. And no one wants to be that guy. And if there are people who credibly believe that this development environment is more likely to drive safer code, a lot of people will be attracted to that, even if the claim itself is actually somewhat dubious. And again, I'm not making particular claims about Move versus EVM versus, but like, they lean into it, they talk about it, there's a bunch of academics talk about it. I think the claims are generally accurate.
00:32:04.080 - 00:32:09.280, Speaker A: I remember you were one of the co authors on one of the Libra papers what's your take on the reviewers?
00:32:09.860 - 00:32:28.560, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think as a language, it's really well designed. I generally think, however, from my perspective, it's more like I think the language is great, but I don't see that as that much of a moat.
00:32:28.720 - 00:32:29.456, Speaker C: Perhaps.
00:32:29.568 - 00:33:07.136, Speaker B: I think in Solana's case, actually, there is more of the, as Antolio would say, chewing glass effect of, like, the account system's fucking hard to deal with. Like, oh, when I run a validator, I have to figure out how to do kernel bypass. There's all sorts of very annoying shit like that. Whereas I kind of feel like Move doesn't have as much of that. I feel like the place where you see that happening is Starkware. Starkware has one of the most hilarious programming languages because it doesn't have strings yet, so you can't even print a fucking error message. Think about that, right? You have to be really assembly guru who can't tell what the fuck's happening ever in order to really write stuff there.
00:33:07.136 - 00:33:47.224, Speaker B: And I think the ZK stuff will be a little closer in my mind to the Solana kind of ethos. I actually think Move is relatively easy to write code for. I do think people, though, in these kind of, like, overly typed systems, it's very hard to get. It will have a little bit of the, know, cadena, et cetera problem of, like, you're getting people to learn this sort of functional language. It has sort of weird semantics that don't match whatever your apparatus is around it, which is like, TypeScript or Python or whatever. Right. So in my mind, I guess that would be more my claim.
00:33:47.224 - 00:34:15.444, Speaker B: I think people like the challenge of Solana, whereas I feel like Move is, like, a very different subset of people who would find that challenging. And I don't think those people are very good at DevOps. And Salana really attracted these people who are like, I love 99% Uptime. I'm like, who the fuck are you people? I don't want to be on call 24 hours a day. I don't know why you do. I feel like Move is more like it's like the O'camel functional, very functional people. I do think there is, like, cultural differences.
00:34:15.444 - 00:34:18.632, Speaker B: I see at least that's just from.
00:34:18.686 - 00:34:31.176, Speaker D: The technical side, I like Ethereum because I don't think there should have to be DevOps for writing applications that live on a blockchain. I think when things are good enough, you don't have to worry about DevOps or uptime the layer.
00:34:31.208 - 00:34:33.080, Speaker B: One people do, though, geth developers.
00:34:33.160 - 00:34:34.076, Speaker D: Get developers do.
00:34:34.098 - 00:34:34.284, Speaker C: Right.
00:34:34.322 - 00:34:36.776, Speaker D: But like, the application layer separation of concerns.
00:34:36.888 - 00:34:52.420, Speaker B: Right, right. In Solana, though, in the beginning, until Anchor really started to mature, you basically didn't have that separation of concerns while you're testing. And I feel like that attracted a certain type, no matter what you can say it attracted the type of person who'd want to be a Geth developer.
00:34:54.120 - 00:35:00.132, Speaker A: There's a kind of masochism that sounds like, forms an early community, like people who go through some shit together.
00:35:00.266 - 00:35:29.296, Speaker C: You need something there for whatever it is. In the case of Solana, though, I don't think on a go forward basis. The core of it is the chewing glass thing, although Anatoly leads into it and I like it. I think what matters is it's a different development environment with some unique set of ideas and trade offs in the programming language and whatever. Like there's JavaScript people, there's Python people, there's C plus plus people, there's Rust people. Everyone gets trained on whatever they got trained on. They have some set of biases and beliefs in how they think computers should work.
00:35:29.296 - 00:35:48.550, Speaker C: There's interpreter code, native code, right? And so I think the idea of like, EVM homogeneity is that's the crazy idea, you just need to have some different new ideas and models and I think Move will be a pretty meaningful benefactor from like the world wants some degree of heterogeneity of just different stuff.
00:35:49.880 - 00:35:59.880, Speaker A: I think that's definitely true. And there are real trade offs to the obviously the EVM is it wasn't even designed by committee, it was designed by like, one crazy person on a bender.
00:36:01.660 - 00:36:04.620, Speaker B: One crazy person who disavowed his creation.
00:36:09.680 - 00:36:14.444, Speaker A: It's a complicated origin story for the biggest, smart contract platform, but it works.
00:36:14.482 - 00:36:35.140, Speaker D: And it's a shitty format. But like VHS versus Betamax, the best format doesn't always win. Yeah, and in a lot of ways I think EVM is winning in its own way because it's becoming a format that any blockchain can adopt to have an ecosystem basically out of the gate.
00:36:35.640 - 00:37:22.336, Speaker A: I 100% believe that. I would take the opposite of the claim that you made, which is that, look, the problem with launching a chain with an EVM is that people can just copy and paste stuff and they're all lazy and nobody reinvents anything. And that's why GitHub exists. It's that you can just copy and grab some other guy's thing and then put it on your thing and say like, great, I'm going to remix it and add something on top. That's like what created internet culture is the ability to do that, which was extremely difficult before the EV into the internet. Now, of course, that means that there's going to be a lot of lazy copies and a lot of lazy forks that don't do anything, just as there are thousands of forks of every major project that no one cares about and no one needs to care about. The waste bin can be infinitely big, which is the beauty of software, is that we're not taking up resources by trying to create another chain with another EVM instance that doesn't end up going anywhere.
00:37:22.336 - 00:37:59.520, Speaker A: Totally fine, no resources are wasted by doing that. But the one person who creates an amazing EVM chain that has some great novel idea in it, or some great application, can get a bunch of adoption, have a bunch of tooling, have the collective intelligence of everyone who's been working on the EVM to civilize this otherwise really awful virtual machine into something that feels usable and feels safe and feels predictable. That is really powerful. And it happened already to JavaScript, right? JavaScript is a horrendous language out of the box, but we've turned it into something like fairly civilized and fairly usable and really, really freaking performant.
00:38:00.100 - 00:38:04.224, Speaker B: There's so many functional programmers who are the type of people who love move.
00:38:04.262 - 00:38:10.164, Speaker A: Who are tisking at you let them tisk. I mean, it's the most popular language in the world.
00:38:10.362 - 00:38:23.510, Speaker B: I do agree though, with Kyle's point that people like the heterogeneity because somehow you want to developers love that, but I don't think users love that.
00:38:23.880 - 00:38:26.504, Speaker A: Of course. I mean, it's opaque to users want.
00:38:26.542 - 00:38:48.288, Speaker B: Their wallet experiences to be homogeneous. I actually think they don't like too many weird UX. And I don't know how to reconcile the user side with the dev side. The devs are the hipsters. The users are like, I don't know, mainstream. They're normally mainstream and they don't want to keep mixing UX. And I feel like ETH did set the standard for what the UX should look like.
00:38:48.288 - 00:38:52.960, Speaker B: So there is some weird thing that I can't kind of reconcile there personally.
00:38:53.460 - 00:39:25.556, Speaker A: Well, so, okay, let's shift subject. So there's been interesting development lately. Kyle, you were talking about that you don't believe L two S are going to be the savior. Well, so there was an L two savior moment last week. So optimism, which is right now in the spotlight because they're a L2, an optimistic roll up on ethereum that recently launched their token optimism op token. This token was supposed to get distributed to a bunch of early investors as well as partners. One of those partners was Winter Mute, which was a market maker.
00:39:25.556 - 00:39:56.224, Speaker A: And so the story goes that Winter Mute was supposed to receive 20 million Op tokens to market make and do stuff. And optimism was like, yo, here are your tokens. Winter Mute was like, cool, we got them. And it was supposed to be a Nosisafe, a multisig that was deployed onto optimism. However, Winchromute never deployed the multi SIG. They had the multi SIG on ethereum and they assumed that they could later deploy it to the same address on optimism. But it would be good that's the address and obviously nobody else can become our multi SIG.
00:39:56.224 - 00:40:42.864, Speaker A: Well, it turned out they were wrong. Somebody else could become their multisig. And in fact, that's what happened. An attacker deployed a contract to the address that was otherwise going to be the Gnosis safe for Optimism sorry, for Winter Mute and took their optimism tokens as well as a bunch of other random Gnosis safes that were also eligible to receive optism airdrops. The reason why this happened was because of some subtle things around Opcodes. And basically they didn't deploy their nosisafe in the way that they ought to have using a modern, using whatever, create two, which is a more deterministic way to deploy addresses that have the parameters in there so that you know who the owners are before you deploy it. The attacker was then pressured by a bunch of people of, like, hey, so they stole, like, 20 million, I think, in Op tokens.
00:40:42.864 - 00:40:46.816, Speaker A: And the attacker, apparently they sent a message to Vitalik.
00:40:46.928 - 00:40:52.292, Speaker B: Vitalik ETH is the ultimate Ponzi scheme. He gets, like, from every single attack.
00:40:52.346 - 00:41:23.724, Speaker A: That's right. So he sent a message to Vitalik in the little what's it called, the memo of the transaction, saying, like, hey, Vitalik, what do you think I should do? Or something like this. He was, like, asking Vitalik for advice on how to deal with this situation. So what he did, as presumably penance for his sins, is he sent 18 million Op back to Optimism to return the funds. He sent 1 million to Vitalik for who knows why? Maybe Vitalik will return it, maybe he won't. I'm not sure. And he kept 1 million for his trouble.
00:41:23.772 - 00:41:58.376, Speaker B: I mean, I think part of this was a little bit of, like, an Edge Lording move with the vitalik piece, because Vitalik's I wouldn't say he probably would disagree with this characterization, but I would say his L2 of choice, the one that's blessed by him based on amount of interaction and talk about it, is certainly optimism versus, say, arbitram. And I think the idea that this type of thing happened on the blessed so called L two, this was like a way of giving a middle finger.
00:41:58.568 - 00:41:59.692, Speaker A: That's definitely possible.
00:41:59.826 - 00:42:03.900, Speaker B: It feels like that. Like, even the note, the way it was written, was just, like, so trolling.
00:42:05.600 - 00:42:20.636, Speaker A: Yeah. We're seeing, though, I mean, we've talked about this before, like, this trend of people giving back hacks happens a lot. Something tells me it's not because of a guilty conscience that we keep seeing these hacks returned. I assume it's that there was no way for this guy to liquidate 20 million.
00:42:20.678 - 00:42:32.904, Speaker B: I mean, chain elsis is actually pretty so there was another attack last week, which is Osmosis had this huge bug. They got the Valdator to actually halt the chain, and it still halted until they fixed this thing.
00:42:33.102 - 00:42:36.312, Speaker A: They had an event here as well. They were like, partying while the chain was down.
00:42:36.366 - 00:42:39.272, Speaker B: I mean, like you said, you are one chain down.
00:42:39.326 - 00:42:41.444, Speaker C: Party up that's crypto.
00:42:41.492 - 00:42:44.060, Speaker A: Yeah. Finally we can relax. Great.
00:42:44.130 - 00:42:51.128, Speaker B: But in general, I think they already rescheduled everything I spoke at this conference.
00:42:51.304 - 00:42:56.632, Speaker A: Wait, you were there? What was the vibe at the optimist at the Osmosis conference?
00:42:56.776 - 00:42:59.490, Speaker B: Not somber, not happy.
00:43:00.100 - 00:43:01.296, Speaker C: There was no one busy in the.
00:43:01.318 - 00:43:03.376, Speaker A: Back room being like, Yo, we're turning it back on.
00:43:03.398 - 00:43:05.952, Speaker C: Don't worry, don't invite the press. You're good?
00:43:06.006 - 00:43:25.850, Speaker B: Yeah. There you go. No, I think that the main thing is the person who did that wrote this tweet apologizing publicly, and I was like, wow, did the team convince you to do this? Because it was a validator who was publicly known and they didn't have anywhere to go, so it was pretty easy to see.
00:43:26.460 - 00:43:28.648, Speaker D: They turned $200 into 2 million.
00:43:28.734 - 00:43:35.033, Speaker B: I think they ended up doing five. I think someone wrote the description of the attack as 200 to two. But the transactions, I think they actually got five.
00:43:35.033 - 00:43:36.124, Speaker A: 5 million.
00:43:36.242 - 00:43:58.160, Speaker B: Yeah, but then they wrote this thing, which was like the most hilarious thing you can read on Twitter. It was like, we are so sorry we did this because we really wanted to take care of our families, but sometimes we have temporary lapses and good judgment. And I was like, that's amazing. I'm never going to say I have bad judgment anymore. I'm just going to say only have temporary lapses of good judgment.
00:43:58.660 - 00:44:03.060, Speaker C: I was just drunk one night. I broke the whole chain.
00:44:03.800 - 00:44:05.780, Speaker A: I broke the chain thinking of my family.
00:44:05.930 - 00:44:15.208, Speaker B: But at Osmosis conference, I did learn a lot, which is chain analysis. Response time is like under an hour to find on some of these things.
00:44:15.294 - 00:44:17.368, Speaker A: When you say their response time to do what?
00:44:17.454 - 00:44:21.988, Speaker B: Oh, you tell them there is like an attacker. You show the addresses and they fan.
00:44:22.004 - 00:44:23.496, Speaker A: This out to all the exchanges or what.
00:44:23.598 - 00:44:24.650, Speaker B: Oh, as in.
00:44:26.380 - 00:44:27.272, Speaker A: They just track the flow.
00:44:27.336 - 00:44:29.324, Speaker B: Track the flow fund and have some idea.
00:44:29.362 - 00:44:32.028, Speaker A: I mean, it couldn't have moved that far, right?
00:44:32.194 - 00:45:01.172, Speaker B: Well, you have IBC, so you could technically have gone somewhere else. You could have gone to Evmos, then to ETH. That would been now that Luna is gone, there's no way back to ETH other than through. But yeah, so I thought that was kind of an interesting thing. And so I think it is actually just like the chain analyses are way better than people realize, right? That's like the majority of it. And then it's like, oh, it's a known person. So then they get a threatening email.
00:45:01.226 - 00:45:12.404, Speaker A: That's like with the Osmosis one. It doesn't surprise me that, look, you're doing this in plain sight. Everyone knows who you are. You run a business, you're part of the community. Where are you going to go on Osmosis to hide?
00:45:12.452 - 00:45:19.884, Speaker C: It's pretty stupid. You should have said, hey Sonny, we found the bug, please pay me $100,000. Bug bounty. What are you doing? This was clearly the right way to handle this.
00:45:19.922 - 00:45:24.430, Speaker A: Look, yeah, I'm sure he has a big family.
00:45:26.320 - 00:45:30.908, Speaker B: And many lapses, but at.
00:45:30.914 - 00:45:47.952, Speaker A: Least in optimism, it seems like optimism, it's like fairly liquid on chain. You could just sell it, turn it to ether and then go take it tornado or whatever. There's ways to get rid of it, I'd assume. So I was surprised that they gave back what was I guess worth like because $2. Optimism token.
00:45:48.016 - 00:45:50.036, Speaker D: I think it's like $0.80 now.
00:45:50.218 - 00:45:54.604, Speaker A: Okay, never mind. All right, I guess I give that back to disclosure.
00:45:54.672 - 00:45:56.730, Speaker B: Optimism investors. Okay, there you go.
00:45:57.180 - 00:46:12.600, Speaker A: So, yeah, it's $0.80. So that would be what, like 15 million, 14 million, whatever, something like that, they give back. So, yeah, it seems surprising to me, which tells me that maybe I don't know if it's honor or if it's just like they're not financially motivated to that degree.
00:46:12.680 - 00:46:35.156, Speaker C: Yeah, my sense is someone had the stats on this, but something like, I think 20, maybe 40% of all the ETH in tornado is known to be stolen funds. It's like a huge percentage. And so I think a lot of people are thinking, like, tornado is not going to help me because just assume everything's going to get blacklisted out. Like, yeah, that's a high enough percentage. That how much plausible an Ibul do you have? It's like one third chance. I don't know, it's like, well, you.
00:46:35.178 - 00:46:37.344, Speaker A: Could always be a beta tester for Aztec whenever they launch.
00:46:37.392 - 00:46:39.588, Speaker C: Whenever they launch. They just launched something like a day.
00:46:39.674 - 00:46:41.380, Speaker A: No, no, they unlaunched.
00:46:41.540 - 00:46:42.760, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's next week.
00:46:42.830 - 00:46:44.468, Speaker A: Yeah, they unlaunched.
00:46:44.644 - 00:46:46.088, Speaker D: Is that a phrase now?
00:46:46.254 - 00:46:50.760, Speaker C: Unlaunch launch conference. You can also have an unlaunch.
00:46:51.420 - 00:47:20.048, Speaker B: I think unlaunch protocol would be hilarious. I guess it deprecates your already running protocol in emergency. Well, all right, but also one other thing about this is I think this does to our earlier conversation about non native, non standardized languages. Even in EVM land where things are standardized, you can't even get cross chain. I'm counting it L2 to layer one consistency. Correct. Because the execution environments differ.
00:47:20.048 - 00:47:55.612, Speaker B: And so you get this kind of weird thing where, yeah, technically they're supposed to be running the same execution environment, but the data availability is different and the transfer notions are somewhat different. And I only think that's harder in a world of many languages. So that would be my bullcase for one language winning them all is like if in the one language winning them all case, you still can't get consistency perfectly. How do you hope in language translation? Because that is a really hard problem in sort of computer science in general.
00:47:55.666 - 00:48:22.390, Speaker A: No, it's definitely true. It's definitely true. But I mean, look, even if there are multiple languages, there aren't going to be that many. So I can believe that. Look, there will be three or four, maybe five, but I doubt there are going to be twelve major languages that define the major blockchains of the day. So one way or another, even if you have to deal with pairwise translation, it's not going to be that many that you have to fundamentally solve. So I think it's doable in the long run, but there's a lot of wood to chop to get there.
00:48:22.390 - 00:49:04.592, Speaker A: Okay, so the last thing I wanted to discuss today so our favorite topic on the chopping block is regulation, as we all know. And so there was a big bill that was dropped just a couple days ago by Cynthia Loomis and Kirsten Gillibrand, and it's kind of a landmark bill we haven't really seen a lot of legible proposals for legislation in the US. That actually fully define a framework under which digital assets can be regulated. And that's what this is. And it's also bipartisan, which is pretty unique because usually crypto is like, oh, the right thinks this, left thinks this, blah, blah, blah, and you can never really get anywhere. So I'll give you guys a highlight. I assume we were at consensus when a lot of this dropped, so I have to imagine most of us haven't gotten super deep.
00:49:04.592 - 00:49:15.540, Speaker A: But here are the highlights. First, sales of crypto that are less than $200 are tax free. So finally, you can use your bitcoin to buy coffee.
00:49:15.620 - 00:49:20.328, Speaker B: So bullish, tornado, cash, people who are pulling out, like, very tiny amounts of money.
00:49:20.494 - 00:49:23.156, Speaker A: Who's doing that? Can you even do that with gas fees?
00:49:23.188 - 00:49:23.476, Speaker C: Gas?
00:49:23.508 - 00:49:33.630, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, the tornado deployed elsewhere. I guess if you look at the buckets you have that you can deposit, people oftentimes do, like multi withdraw at really small size.
00:49:34.160 - 00:49:37.730, Speaker D: I assume the people using tornado are not the people worried about the tax.
00:49:38.420 - 00:50:17.580, Speaker A: Something tells me they're probably they're probably tax loss harvesting is what they're so there's a de minimis exemption for taxes. CFTC will be the primary regulator of crypto spot markets, which is pretty good, which is great. I mean, Gensler obviously doesn't like us, so CFTC is a lot better. Crypto securities and commodities would be more clearly defined, which would put most crypto assets as commodities. So crypto securities are things that pay a dividend or are more like equity like or they whatever. Most L One tokens would be very clearly crypto commodities and crypto commodities would be regulated by the CFTC.
00:50:19.120 - 00:50:25.464, Speaker B: Arguably, though, the L One token is putting off yield is paying dividends. Well, it's complicated for an epoch.
00:50:25.512 - 00:50:32.604, Speaker A: It's definitely a complicated bathroom reading the bill. Yeah, but they don't pay dividends. They don't pay dividends. What? L1 pays dividends.
00:50:32.652 - 00:50:37.664, Speaker B: Well, staking yield looks staking looks like that. No, you're also locked up. You're also paid later.
00:50:37.782 - 00:51:01.176, Speaker A: No, I mean, look, you can get paid yield for doing work for anything, right? You can get paid yield for dollars. That doesn't make it that's not getting paid dividends. Dividends in and of itself eats does not generate dividends. You can enter into a relationship with the protocol for which the protocol will pay you. That is definitely different than different when.
00:51:01.278 - 00:51:09.064, Speaker B: The underlying asset in the case of proof of work stuff is energy compute power versus like, oh, I'm providing more of the asset.
00:51:09.192 - 00:51:10.412, Speaker C: I agree. The party line.
00:51:10.466 - 00:51:15.708, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm just saying, like, objectively, I think you're wrong.
00:51:15.874 - 00:51:36.528, Speaker D: I agree. Here's why it's not a dividend. It would be a dividend if all ether holders got more correct. Because even in proof of stake, you might only have 90% participation or 50% participation. The returns are not going to everybody. The returns are going to the active network validators not a dividend.
00:51:36.704 - 00:51:38.068, Speaker A: Exactly. Here we go.
00:51:38.074 - 00:51:39.060, Speaker B: Not a dividend.
00:51:40.140 - 00:51:40.616, Speaker C: We're team.
00:51:40.638 - 00:51:44.740, Speaker A: Not a dividend. Yeah, you guys can go hang out with Gensler, ether commodities.
00:51:44.900 - 00:51:45.930, Speaker C: I'm on your team.
00:51:50.220 - 00:51:51.624, Speaker A: All right, great. Fine.
00:51:51.742 - 00:51:52.440, Speaker C: All right.
00:51:52.590 - 00:52:38.024, Speaker A: Also, you guys remember we had that episode with Coinbase where Coinbase was like, hey guys, in one of our disclosures we're going to say that in bankruptcy, blah blah blah. People freaked out. They were like, oh my God, if Coinbase goes bankrupt all of your money is gone. So there was a clarification that that's not true and customer deposits are not reachable in a bankruptcy by creditors. And for companies that raise money in digital asset sales, those companies would be required to do bi annual disclosures about the teams track record, what's going on, what the progress is. And these would have to be filed regularly by anybody who raises money in the US. And that actually seemed pretty reasonable to me.
00:52:38.024 - 00:52:51.148, Speaker A: That seemed like, yeah, that actually seems like what we should be doing as an industry now. Masari is kind of like one of the places where that sort of thing happens, but having it be some kind of public database seems honestly pretty great.
00:52:51.314 - 00:52:53.720, Speaker B: I don't know how many times have you used Edgar?
00:52:53.880 - 00:52:55.352, Speaker A: I've never used Edgar.
00:52:55.416 - 00:52:58.124, Speaker B: One of the world's worst databases I've ever used.
00:52:58.242 - 00:53:04.848, Speaker A: Look, it doesn't have to be Edgar. It can be on chain or something. I'm fine with the those are the.
00:53:04.854 - 00:53:07.868, Speaker B: High level wait, there's also the Dow thing, right? Where Dows?
00:53:07.964 - 00:53:16.580, Speaker A: No, it was more that if you want to get favorable tracks treatment you have to incorporate in something. But if you're a Dow and if you don't want that you don't have to do that.
00:53:16.650 - 00:53:40.492, Speaker D: There's also the staking yield tax policy. So for proof of stake systems like Ether there was that unsettled legal question where somebody sued the IRS tezos people, right? Yeah, actually the bill as I understand it, says you're taxed when you sell it, not when you receive it.
00:53:40.626 - 00:54:08.084, Speaker A: Yeah, there's a huge bill. There was a bunch of other pieces in there. There was something else also about the crypto broker stuff that was introduced in the previous legislation that can be clarified in this bill. There's a lot to it, but that's the high level stuff and so it would create a ton of clarity where currently there's obviously a ton of ambiguity and you've got a lot of regulators fighting for territory. What do you guys think about the broad shape of the bill? And I guess the other question is how long do you think okay, well.
00:54:08.122 - 00:54:50.836, Speaker D: My personal view is that it's fantastic because it addresses some of the longest standing open questions in crypto. I don't expect the bill to just pass in its current form, but as the starting point for a conversation at the legislative level, I think it's the best possible starting point. I'm sure like all legislation that's going to get compromised. To death. Crazy things are going to be added, removed, tweaked. If it goes through, it's not going to look anything like it is proposed today, being proposed by some of the more friendliest members of Congress, but seeing that it's a bipartisan bill is extremely promising. Right now.
00:54:50.836 - 00:55:42.580, Speaker D: Crypto has generally had republican support, but seeing a democratic co sponsor who's going to bring other democrats in I think is extremely positive for the space. And the fact that you see both sides trying to create proactive legislation to answer all these open questions and all these open questions are the root of why the SEC is focused on enforcement and know anything else. I think it's incredibly you know, I think it'll take a year to two years for something like this to pass, potentially. I don't think it's like the immediate agenda of the administration. There's really hot burning fires that are taking people's time and attention. But if this is where the legislation that will occur starts from, I think we should all be excited.
00:55:43.000 - 00:55:47.680, Speaker A: So what's your over under on how long it takes for this thing to work through the machine?
00:55:47.840 - 00:55:53.476, Speaker D: So I'm not a political expert. We have consultants who tell us we.
00:55:53.498 - 00:55:56.564, Speaker B: Also forgot to add nothing we say is political advice.
00:55:56.612 - 00:55:58.260, Speaker D: Yeah, nothing we say is political advice.
00:55:58.340 - 00:56:00.360, Speaker C: I was hoping to dish out some political advice today.
00:56:00.430 - 00:56:02.260, Speaker A: Okay, Kyle, what is your political advice?
00:56:02.340 - 00:56:04.170, Speaker C: Apparently I'm not allowed to share.
00:56:04.860 - 00:56:07.428, Speaker A: Nothing he says is political advice. You're the guest.
00:56:07.444 - 00:56:08.652, Speaker D: You're allowed to say anything you want.
00:56:08.706 - 00:56:09.656, Speaker A: We're limited.
00:56:09.768 - 00:56:13.416, Speaker C: What is political advice? How do you act on political advice? Can I just tell people where they should vote?
00:56:13.448 - 00:56:16.104, Speaker A: You just tell them run for office. I mean, that's political advice.
00:56:16.232 - 00:56:18.832, Speaker C: Political advice. Exercise your first amendment rights. Go run for office.
00:56:18.886 - 00:56:21.936, Speaker A: Beautiful. Okay, so we have no idea how.
00:56:21.958 - 00:56:27.520, Speaker D: Long if I have to put an over under out there, I'd say it's like 15 months.
00:56:27.670 - 00:56:31.004, Speaker A: 15 months? So you think next fall is when we see something?
00:56:31.062 - 00:56:39.028, Speaker B: Come on, this is fucking crypto. You're telling me we're not going to make a prediction market for this? This is what the game was made for.
00:56:39.194 - 00:56:41.530, Speaker A: There will be at some point, but.
00:56:41.900 - 00:57:17.512, Speaker D: I think the midterms this year are going to shed a lot of light on how it know. I think frankly, November is only five months away now and the composition of both the House and senate is going to change potentially significantly. And I think the prospects for any crypto legislation are going to change dramatically based on the outcome in think, you know, whether this is right or wrong. I think if the Republicans pick up a lot of seats, you might see the timeline for crypto legislation pulled forward, something that does have generally bipartisan support that won't get vetoed.
00:57:17.676 - 00:57:37.130, Speaker A: It's funny. Last summer I thought the most important thing that was going to be affecting crypto prices was regulation. And now I'm like, I don't know, it almost feels like it doesn't matter. PPI relative to macro. Yeah, exactly. It feels like the only thing that matters is macro and regulation is like I'll be fine.
00:57:38.860 - 00:57:58.930, Speaker C: We spent a fair bit of time trying to think through this, actually. I don't think regulation will move prices meaningfully there's, broadly speaking, three things that can happen. The worst thing that can happen is try and ban crypto in whatever form possible. Delist everything other than bitcoin and doge. And litecoin is kind of like the most extreme version of that. Right?
00:58:00.340 - 00:58:02.130, Speaker B: Got delisted, by the way, this week.
00:58:03.940 - 00:58:04.592, Speaker A: Why so?
00:58:04.646 - 00:58:26.280, Speaker C: Because they add us in private. Apparently the Charlie Lee only two years late. Oh my God. Anywho, so that's like one extreme and this is just us centric. I'm not commenting elsewhere. That's one thing that could happen. I think everyone kind of agrees that's like a sub 1% probability, like super unlikely.
00:58:26.280 - 00:59:29.340, Speaker C: The other extreme is nothing happens. So basically the status quo just perpetuates indefinitely of like are they securities? Are they not? There's this whole song and dance with the foundations and the teams are mostly in the and like there's no disclosures and just kind of like everyone just kind of keeps operating and I think the market generally works, there's like abuses and problems, but the market as a whole functions. And the third option is like something in the middle. And this bill from Senator Alumnus and from Senator Gillibrand is pretty squarely, right? And they're trying to say, look, we need some disclosures. Let's not make this going out IPO public process with Dodd Frank and whatever all those other rules are that public companies have to go through. Let's reduce disclosure requirements, let these teams actually function and operate where you can have a twelve person team that can have a public token and be okay and make some sensible rules around staking gains and diminished transactions. There's really not a fourth option.
00:59:29.340 - 01:00:16.990, Speaker C: And if you think about the probability extremes of the two on either end, those also seem like one of them seems extremely unlikely. The other one possibly can happen just as a function of inertia and status quo bias. But I just generally don't think that getting disclosure requirements that are reasonable and not too onerous, why is that bad? Now, there's a case that the disclosure requirements are atrocious and screw up everything up, but I actually don't really think that's the case. I think the higher probability outcome is they're just stupid. Like I don't know. Should compound labs report the same thing as Solana labs? Is the same thing as audience? Is the same thing as labs? Probably not, but they'll be forced to conform to some common standard. Loosely it'll be annoying and kind of silly, but that's not that big of a deal.
01:00:17.600 - 01:00:38.236, Speaker D: I mean, the biggest question is will the projects that are 6 hours old conform to the same standards and all the things that get created over a weekend that come out of left field versus everything you just named are generally venture backed, larger established systems.
01:00:38.268 - 01:01:14.876, Speaker A: Well, the thing that's also scary about crypto is that a lot of times things that happened over a weekend end up getting hundreds of millions of dollars and become larger than things that were made two years ago. So that's the thing about crypto is that because it's all software, you've got these crazy power laws that kick into place and exponential growth in short amounts of time and it's very hard to build a very clear regulatory regime around something that behaves that way. So look, I respect the attempt at trying to come up with a framework and I'm sure it's going to get bastardized and corrupted over the next couple of years as people play political games with trying to figure out how this.
01:01:14.898 - 01:01:19.724, Speaker B: Better lobby, auditors or crypto people like Ernst and Yacht.
01:01:19.772 - 01:01:28.080, Speaker A: I've heard that actually the crypto lobbies are really bad. I don't have any particular insight into this, but I've heard this a couple of times now.
01:01:28.230 - 01:02:12.240, Speaker C: I have some insight here and the realtor test here will be November 2022 elections midterms. There is a growing belief in DC that crypto money is big, like much bigger than previously thought. There's a few packs out there now disclosure, multicoin does donate to some of those we have donated personally. I've done it personally to Senator alumnus, Senator Gillibrand and there's a chance that you see some really big crypto dollars hit midterms and if that happens, then I think DC will actually become a lot more pro crypto friendly.
01:02:12.660 - 01:02:37.480, Speaker A: Here's the claim that I've heard, the claim that I've heard, and again I can't confirm because I don't know a damn thing about how all this stuff works from inside Washington. But what I've heard is that crypto people basically think that Washington is pay to play and it's like the efficacy of your dollars depends a lot on how well you actually understand how the system works. And crypto people have a lot of money and very little understanding of how the system works.
01:02:37.550 - 01:02:37.976, Speaker C: That's true.
01:02:37.998 - 01:02:44.580, Speaker B: Tech was like that. You remember when everyone used to make fun of tech companies for just like being bad at lobbying?
01:02:44.660 - 01:02:46.268, Speaker A: Absolutely. I'm sure there's a learning curve, I'm.
01:02:46.274 - 01:02:47.276, Speaker C: Sure there's a learning curve but I.
01:02:47.298 - 01:02:55.624, Speaker B: Feel like tech was not committed to throwing money at it. As much like crypto people, the velocity of the capital flows way faster.
01:02:55.672 - 01:03:35.580, Speaker C: I think you're also implying too much homogeneity among crypto people. I think there is a new class of extremely sophisticated actor. I'll just ping FTX because Sam is in front of Congress like, I don't know, every two months now and they're talking about the CFTC, about derivatives and all these like they fairly obviously have an extremely sophisticated nuanced, multi year plan with contingencies left, right and right center for everything you can imagine. And they're obviously playing the game at many levels. I'm not as close with coinbase, but I would assume coinbase is playing a similar game. I can't really speak for any other firms, but that's happening and it's happening. I think what will become apparent, although it's not yet apparent at very large dollar scale.
01:03:36.080 - 01:04:12.936, Speaker A: Look, I believe it and I've been advocating for a year ago that people are way underspending on lobbying and getting some political representation in DC. It's taken a while. Obviously crypto is scary. So first approximation before this stuff is popular and seems kind of normal and your kids are using it, it's really scary to have a bunch know, silicon valley people with a bunch of money show up and say hey, we want to get the laws changed. Generally that doesn't tend to reflect well look, I don't know a damn thing about any of this. So I assume that this stuff will get better as people learn and they spend money and they figure out what is actually efficacious and what's not.
01:04:12.958 - 01:04:20.520, Speaker B: I mean the real question to me though is how much of a negative impact was Luna and terra on the overall?
01:04:21.420 - 01:04:24.520, Speaker A: We do have a rule that every episode we have to talk about terra.
01:04:25.760 - 01:04:33.852, Speaker B: The way I think about it is how much money did you have to spend to make x units of impact in whatever political metric you care?
01:04:33.906 - 01:04:34.424, Speaker C: Positive impact?
01:04:34.472 - 01:04:42.976, Speaker B: Positive political impact pre terra and post terra. And what's the ratio? Like, how much has changed? I actually think it has changed at least like five x.
01:04:43.158 - 01:04:43.968, Speaker C: Five x?
01:04:44.054 - 01:04:44.912, Speaker B: I think. Five x.
01:04:44.966 - 01:04:49.840, Speaker A: So you think that a dollar spent before terra was five x more impactful than a dollar spent after terra?
01:04:50.280 - 01:04:56.836, Speaker C: I would hope that the brush is not that broad, that like stablecoin things are conflated with securities things.
01:04:56.938 - 01:05:00.950, Speaker B: Have you ever talked to yeah, I guess you have.
01:05:02.360 - 01:05:04.004, Speaker A: He's a proud sponsor of a couple.
01:05:04.122 - 01:05:13.124, Speaker C: I have donated to senator Lomas and Gilbrand. I am optimistic that they will not be all the baby will not be thrown out with bathwater.
01:05:13.252 - 01:05:16.716, Speaker B: The whole Elizabeth Warren suing pool together are like her.
01:05:16.818 - 01:05:18.172, Speaker A: Wait, suing pool together?
01:05:18.306 - 01:05:19.304, Speaker C: One of her cronies?
01:05:19.432 - 01:05:23.068, Speaker B: Yeah, someone who in her administration or whatever, her office.
01:05:23.154 - 01:05:23.884, Speaker A: Oh, I see.
01:05:24.002 - 01:05:28.956, Speaker C: By the way, you should donate. The guy is doing a public fundraiser. I bought one of his NFTs.
01:05:28.988 - 01:05:29.570, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:05:32.420 - 01:05:37.020, Speaker D: The money goes to the pool together company who's defending the lawsuits?
01:05:37.100 - 01:05:37.730, Speaker C: Yes.
01:05:38.360 - 01:05:39.408, Speaker A: Protect DeFi?
01:05:39.504 - 01:05:40.150, Speaker C: Yes.
01:05:40.920 - 01:06:05.704, Speaker B: But I just generally think the baby goes out with the bathwater because the thing governments care about is mainly money laundering and because they've done the reductio at absurdum to that NFTs. They don't give a shit about NFTs. They only care about anything that looks like money laundering, which is stable coins and base protocol coins. They somehow maybe they'll separate them.
01:06:05.822 - 01:06:11.292, Speaker C: Luna just destroyed value. They didn't help people. When the value goes to zero, you can't launder it anymore. It's worth nothing.
01:06:11.346 - 01:06:24.368, Speaker A: That is true. That's true. We were talking about this earlier is that I don't think that anybody on Capitol Hill has any idea what the hell layer one is, much less that luna has anything to do with layer one.
01:06:24.374 - 01:06:31.300, Speaker B: I think Kyle said the same thing to me, but I just generally think I'm trying to just estimate this ratio, this damage ratio.
01:06:31.640 - 01:07:01.064, Speaker A: I think the primary victims of the program that is now facing crypto is going to be on DeFi stable coins. I think that's pretty clear. Right. That's the word cloud at the center of what Terra was about. And so I think it's going to be a rough year for those parties, and I think they're likely to whatever degree this regulation or this legislation gets altered before it ends up getting passed. Almost certainly it's going to find some way to flagellate anybody who's doing something that looks more like Terra.
01:07:01.112 - 01:07:06.956, Speaker B: Also, do you think fractionalized NFTs survive the do you think they'll they're so.
01:07:06.978 - 01:07:08.288, Speaker A: Small that nobody's going to I don't.
01:07:08.294 - 01:07:12.880, Speaker B: Know, though the CFTC loves talking about them, given how do they yes, a lot.
01:07:13.030 - 01:07:17.948, Speaker C: The total market cap of fractalized NFTs like including doge. Okay.
01:07:18.134 - 01:07:19.380, Speaker B: Including doge.
01:07:21.320 - 01:07:25.316, Speaker D: It's small, but it's one of these.
01:07:25.338 - 01:07:27.312, Speaker B: Things that regulators are like, glommed onto.
01:07:27.376 - 01:07:28.324, Speaker A: Because they understand it.
01:07:28.362 - 01:07:28.516, Speaker C: Right.
01:07:28.538 - 01:07:38.948, Speaker A: It's one of the few things NFTs they can understand. It's like, oh, you have this big thing that you put into little pieces and it's like I remember that securitized it.
01:07:39.114 - 01:07:40.020, Speaker D: We know that word.
01:07:40.090 - 01:07:48.972, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. I heard bad things happen when that's when we did that. So anyway all right, gents, well, we're up on time. Thank you so much, Kyle, for coming and hanging out with us.
01:07:49.026 - 01:07:50.008, Speaker C: Thanks y'all, for visiting.
01:07:50.104 - 01:07:55.400, Speaker A: Yeah, this has been amazing. Signing off, everybody. Peace out. Bye.
