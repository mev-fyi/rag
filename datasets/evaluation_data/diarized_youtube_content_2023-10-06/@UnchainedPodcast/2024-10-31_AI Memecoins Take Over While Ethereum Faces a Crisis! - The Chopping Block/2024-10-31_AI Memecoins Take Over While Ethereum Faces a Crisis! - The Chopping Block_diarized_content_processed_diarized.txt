00:00:00.280 - 00:00:05.945, Speaker A: You can pull a carriage with two horses, but can you pull a carriage with 10, 24 chickens?
00:00:06.105 - 00:00:07.033, Speaker B: Not a dividend.
00:00:07.129 - 00:00:08.305, Speaker A: It's a tale of two kwon.
00:00:08.385 - 00:00:11.009, Speaker C: Now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet.
00:00:11.097 - 00:00:13.545, Speaker D: Generally speaking, airdrops are kind of pointless anyways.
00:00:13.705 - 00:00:16.645, Speaker C: Unnamed trading firms who are very involved.
00:00:16.985 - 00:00:21.725, Speaker B: Eth is the ultimate defi Protocols are the antidote to this problem.
00:00:22.225 - 00:00:34.557, Speaker A: Hi everyone. Welcome to chopping block. Every couple of weeks the four of us get together and give the industry insiders perspective on the crypto topics of the day. We have Tom the defi maven and master of memes.
00:00:34.741 - 00:00:36.225, Speaker B: How do you do my friends?
00:00:36.925 - 00:00:45.485, Speaker A: We have Robert the crypto connoisseur and czar of superstate gm. We have Tarun the Gigabrain and Garen Poobah at Gauntlet.
00:00:45.645 - 00:00:46.385, Speaker C: Yo.
00:00:46.925 - 00:01:12.987, Speaker A: And we have me, Haseeb, head hype man at Dragonfly. We are early stage investors in crypto. But I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice, legal advice or even life advice. Please, please see choppingblock XYZ for more disclosures. And first off, I want to say to our audio only listeners, this might sound very confusing and the only thing I will tell you is please go watch the video even if it's just for 30 seconds because it'll make more.
00:01:13.051 - 00:01:17.723, Speaker C: Very important this week to catch the visuals for our special Halloween episode.
00:01:17.899 - 00:01:46.419, Speaker A: And bitcoin this week is almost its all time high. I guess it's excited for the end of election season the way that many of us are excited to be bored of having to not look at, you know, crazy news every day. But with that, I'll hand it over to our nor our green haired friend. By the way, if you're watching note, look at the signs behind me. They represent Haseeb's true inner self.
00:01:46.507 - 00:02:11.775, Speaker C: Okay, thank you, thank you, thank you. Well, yeah, we thought we'd mix it up today and you know, as, as Tarun, I'm going to take over moderating. It is Halloween. We wanted to make things a little bit fun for you guys but there's as always, a lot of news. Also, I cannot actually read any of the notes of these glasses. So I'm going to do the grandma move here. So there are a few stories that we wanted to get through in the spirit of Halloween scariness and weirdness.
00:02:11.775 - 00:02:21.975, Speaker C: The first thing is the rise of goat token. So first thing I should ask anybody here invested in Go Token, do any of you guys own any AI Meme coins?
00:02:22.465 - 00:02:33.881, Speaker B: I have an allergy to investing in what Goat is derived from. And so I saw this and I did not want to participate an allergy.
00:02:33.913 - 00:02:35.313, Speaker C: In what goats are derived from.
00:02:35.369 - 00:02:36.485, Speaker D: Oh, goatseed.
00:02:36.825 - 00:02:39.169, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Like the origin of this.
00:02:39.217 - 00:02:40.481, Speaker D: You're not supposed to Google it.
00:02:40.633 - 00:02:41.673, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:02:41.769 - 00:02:42.073, Speaker B: Don't.
00:02:42.129 - 00:02:43.177, Speaker C: Don't Google it.
00:02:43.281 - 00:02:43.969, Speaker B: Don't.
00:02:44.137 - 00:02:44.529, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:02:44.577 - 00:02:55.857, Speaker A: I mean, but I would say I had the opposite reaction. I was like, wow, Mark Andreessen is shilling a shitter. Let's go. I think I bought like a hundred dollars. It was not like a.
00:02:55.961 - 00:02:57.305, Speaker C: You did? Okay.
00:02:57.345 - 00:02:59.805, Speaker B: Wow, that's like 50,000 now.
00:03:01.065 - 00:03:03.529, Speaker A: No, I bought a little later. I think it's like 8,000.
00:03:03.617 - 00:03:09.041, Speaker C: But wow. Very uncharacteristic of you as a top tier VC to be going all in on a vc.
00:03:09.073 - 00:03:32.061, Speaker A: I was just looking at Mark Andreessen writing about this, and then I was reading the replies, and I saw these, like, normal AI people going crazy and, like, yelling at him. And I was like. And I saw the crypto people being like, this is the singularity. And I was like, okay, this is the first time that AI people have paid attention at all to anything in crypto. And that when I saw that, I was like, aha. This is. This is.
00:03:32.061 - 00:03:35.317, Speaker A: This is worth the hundred dollar lottery ticket.
00:03:35.501 - 00:03:40.669, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I get that. I just think, you know, the singularity is just. It's mathematically impossible.
00:03:40.717 - 00:03:40.853, Speaker B: Right.
00:03:40.869 - 00:03:41.985, Speaker C: It's a very imprecise.
00:03:44.365 - 00:04:00.293, Speaker A: I'm not saying I have any rational thing. That's why I was kind of like, I had a Solana wallet that had a hundred dollars in it. And I was like, I forgot. I. You know, I was like, why not? Yeah, it was. It was totally just like reading that. I was like, all of these people are delirious.
00:04:00.293 - 00:04:04.853, Speaker A: Like, the AI people being like, this is not a real agent. It's like, yeah, no shit, sure.
00:04:04.989 - 00:04:27.035, Speaker C: Okay, so let's, let's. Let's give a little bit of backstory of what exactly is goat. First, we'll start with the. The forewarning. You know, do not look up goatee if you don't know what it is. But this is a 90s meme that I heard Laura Shin describe it very elegantly as a man spreading his butt cheeks. I think that's a very generous way of describing what Goatse is.
00:04:27.035 - 00:04:53.409, Speaker C: It's one of those memes that actually, it's sort of like if you were coming of age in the early Internet. We talked on the last show about IBAM's world, part of that generation of Internet culture and Internet humor that has evolved in so many directions since then. But. But. So there was an AI that was created by this gentleman by the name of Andy Iyer, who is kind of a. I wouldn't call him an AI researcher. He's sort of like an AI performance artist or something.
00:04:53.409 - 00:05:37.455, Speaker C: You know, I don't know. He's one of these people experimenting with AI to create different kinds of art or performance art or something. And so one thing that he did was he trained an AI model to basically one. I think it was a llama fine tune that he generated based on the conversations that two instances of Claude generated by just talking to each other and rambling for hours and hours in a discord. And by fine tuning a model on this set of conversations. These models came up with this thing called the Goatse Gospel, which is some kind of weird pseudo religion they invented oriented around this meme. And so this model that he generated has its own Twitter account called Truth Terminal.
00:05:37.455 - 00:06:32.999, Speaker C: And Truth Terminal just tweeted out random crap to random people on the Internet. And Marc Andreessen, the founder of A16Z, was very entertained by this, as he tends to be entertained by things on Twitter, and sent $50,000 in Bitcoin to this account. And so this sort of started this awareness of, oh, hey, this account has a crypto wallet and it has the ability to do stuff in crypto. So somebody created a meme coin on pump fun called Goat, which stands for Goetzeus Maximus, which is this, you know, corresponds to this religion that this Truth Terminal account created or implied that it wanted to create, and sent a bunch of the tokens to this account. And within a couple of weeks, this thing has become one of the hottest meme coins in existence. It's traded up to a high of $850 million market cap. And the tokens owned by this AI are worth more than $10 million.
00:06:32.999 - 00:07:12.739, Speaker C: And people are now saying that there's a new renaissance of meme coins that are AI generated meme coins. So we now have another one. There's a couple more. There's a platform called Virtuals, which is used to launch these on chain agents that's also created its own meme coin. And for whatever reason, the meta has moved here of these agents that are interacting with Twitter and dynamically representing some meme coin in the process. Now, all that being said, it's important to realize, like, what is and isn't really happening. And there was some controversy happening over the weekend about, oh, is this really being controlled by a person? So the reality is agents on Chain are Not actually autonomous enough to be able to manage crypto or trade or anything like this.
00:07:12.739 - 00:07:40.751, Speaker C: And the creator of the account has made very clear he is actually controlling which tweets go on the timeline and which ones don't because occasionally there's like racist stuff on there. There's just like random nonsense that is not a good idea to tweet. And so he is filtering the account. He's also made clear that he is controlling the wallet. And people started speculating that, oh, he's going to, he's, you know, he's going to steal the money for himself. And so he created a trust such that. Or he said he was going to create a trust so that the wallet is only used for the, you know, blah, blah, blah.
00:07:40.751 - 00:08:10.511, Speaker C: There's all this weirdness. And the meme coin also took a nosedive over the weekend because the account started making typos and people thought, oh my God, that means it's a human. It's not really an AI and AI would never make typos, which is not true. So anyway, a lot of. I've seen so much of my timeline get taken over by these AI meme coins. Curious to get you guys read. Do you think this is the newest thing happening? Is this the future where we're going to be trading meme coins created by our AI overlords? Because if so, that would be truly scary and Halloween worthy.
00:08:10.623 - 00:08:45.687, Speaker B: First of all, the meme coin is not created by the AI overlord, okay? The, the meme coin is created by some dude who made the meme coin and then tried to convince the AI to adopt it. So this, this feels a little bit like stagecraft in a lot of ways. And you know, I, I feel like the narrative of like these are AI coins is kind of like nonsense. It's like someone using open AI, like chat GPT to shill a coin that someone else made. You know, it's not that impressive to me.
00:08:45.791 - 00:09:27.273, Speaker D: I'll be excited when the AIs are starting to diversify their assets into real world assets on chain and earn some tokenized treasury yield. But I agree, it's actually, I think, very analogous to kind of a lot of the crypto AI projects and that it's a lot of like vaporware, smoke and mirrors, kind of Potemkin Village ish kind of stuff going on. So I agree, I think giving these things the label agent is also, I think, a bit of a stretch. But people like the narrative and it's a good meme and I think that is, you know, mostly why this Stuff has been doing well versus some, you know, bigger meta shift or so.
00:09:27.289 - 00:09:29.525, Speaker C: Robert, you don't think this is a glimpse into the future?
00:09:31.505 - 00:09:32.289, Speaker D: Asking me or.
00:09:32.337 - 00:09:34.577, Speaker C: That's you, that's you. I'm asking Robert.
00:09:34.681 - 00:09:40.365, Speaker D: No, we're. No, I'm pretty skeptical. But you never know. Things might change in the future.
00:09:40.785 - 00:10:06.719, Speaker A: I'm not going to lie. Most of the meme coin stuff, I completely didn't really participate, but I just happened. Like I said, I happen to have this wallet and I was reading this Marc Andreessen thing and I was like, mark Andreessen is implicitly marketing a meme coin. This is insane. Like, this hundred dollars that I forgot about. There's no, no other way to spend it. You know, it was like a total joke, like a fluke.
00:10:06.719 - 00:10:20.081, Speaker A: I just like happened to be holding a phone that had the hundred dollars and I happened to be reading that and I was like, you know what? Yeah, it was just like a momentary lapse in judgment. Although I guess it wasn't lapsed in hindsight.
00:10:20.233 - 00:10:22.925, Speaker B: Are you now a financial nihilist?
00:10:25.305 - 00:10:38.089, Speaker A: No, I just feel like, you know, I just went to the casino and, you know, normally I don't play anything at the casino, but somehow I decided to play baccarat and I was just like, I had one too many drinks and I played one round of baccarat.
00:10:38.137 - 00:10:38.275, Speaker B: That.
00:10:38.305 - 00:10:39.943, Speaker A: That's like basically what happened.
00:10:40.119 - 00:10:49.295, Speaker C: This sounds like you're defending your actions in a deposition. You're like, the phone was just there. You know, I found the money. I didn't know what I was doing. It was all a moment of excess.
00:10:49.415 - 00:10:59.831, Speaker B: Yeah. We're going to find out that he actually is the one who was partially responsible for creating this coin. And this is like the COVID Like, oh, I bought $100 worth by accident.
00:11:00.023 - 00:11:01.743, Speaker C: That would make sense. Yeah.
00:11:01.839 - 00:11:50.379, Speaker A: No, no, no, no, no. I wish I was both smart and stupid enough at the same time to have pulled that off. But I think the thing that was interesting to me about it was the narrative itself will create the real thing. People are all making these actual agents that are doing these actions. Brian Armstrong and Coinbase are really pushing the Coinbase API for agents and modifying it so LLMs can call directly into it and you can write cursor code that calls their APIs directly. So I actually think the reason that this is interesting is not that it itself is the correct thing, but it's inspiring people to make all this other infrastructure so that the thing that it claims will happen.
00:11:50.467 - 00:12:13.537, Speaker C: Yeah, I do think there are these kinds of self fulfilling Prophecies and technology where something is just so fun and so cool that we want it to be true and then we do everything that we need to in order to make it true. I think this might be one of those moments at the same. And. And there have been early shoots of like, what was that? What was that? AI influencer that I was a 16Z backed. That was like, oh, Brad.
00:12:13.601 - 00:12:14.593, Speaker D: Little Michaela.
00:12:14.729 - 00:12:16.769, Speaker C: Yeah, little Michaela. That's right. That's right.
00:12:16.937 - 00:12:24.441, Speaker D: And there been a Trevor McFaddress is now working on. Was it virtuals or Luna. Yes, or one of them.
00:12:24.473 - 00:12:25.009, Speaker C: Oh, is that right?
00:12:25.057 - 00:12:25.473, Speaker A: One of them.
00:12:25.489 - 00:12:42.131, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I see, I see. Okay. Yeah, so I mean, it's a. It's a. This is an idea that's been circulating for a long time. There's also that. There's that Japanese pop star that's purely VTUBE creation that doesn't, you know, what's her name? Oh, there you go.
00:12:42.131 - 00:12:46.043, Speaker C: Okay, I know this is on tap. Yeah, this is.
00:12:46.059 - 00:12:46.971, Speaker D: This is me as Robert.
00:12:47.003 - 00:12:50.563, Speaker C: As a. Yeah, Robert. Wow. I'm surprised you're into this stuff. It's really surprising.
00:12:50.739 - 00:12:52.547, Speaker A: Robert took a time machine back to.
00:12:52.651 - 00:13:04.623, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, as a dad, I thought you'd be too busy to keep up with this stuff, but that's impressive while running multiple companies. Wow. Very cool. So, okay, so this idea has been in the air for a long time.
00:13:04.759 - 00:13:15.111, Speaker A: And actually the first time I ever heard such an idea was I was in China and Robert was at the same actually at your event, Dragonfly event 2019.
00:13:15.223 - 00:13:16.343, Speaker C: It was your event.
00:13:16.519 - 00:13:44.601, Speaker A: Yes, yes, but the Dragonfly event in China in 2019. And, uh, Olaf, the founder of Polychain, large fund in the space, was just telling me his dream for crypto was that the richest entity on earth would be a broken Tesla. That once it was broken, it's like AI was like, well, shit, I need to make money somehow. I can't. Can't make money being a autonomous vehicle. So, yeah, so I'm going to just trade crypto until I do. And like this.
00:13:44.601 - 00:14:13.073, Speaker A: That was another reason I thought this was funny. It just reminded me so much of that story because it's like, okay, fine, there's no, not the broken Tesla part, but there's the. The autonomous thing, but the funny part. And I agree with like, Ilya from Near, who we've had on the show before, who had a good point, which is like this notion of the AI agent trading new trading assets is like not new. Right. Like, that's literally every HFT firm right. Like that's what I was doing 10 years ago.
00:14:13.073 - 00:14:32.397, Speaker A: I think the thing that's new and interesting is the creation of new assets, because governments restrict new asset creation strictly. That's why TRADFI is boring and not fun. Right. It's like you, you, you have a fixed set of assets. You spend 5 million years trying to get a new one approved, and then maybe you get lucky and. And you know, it gets approved. Right.
00:14:32.397 - 00:15:09.773, Speaker A: I do an API call and it's like, oh, I got 500 new assets. In fact, a fun statistic I heard today was that there were 40,000 new assets issued on Solana yesterday, which is wild. So my point is, the interesting thing about crypto is that this new asset creation thing is because of the lack of censorship, resistance and permissionlessness and all this type of nice stuff and the API ability of it. You can actually imagine the AI making all these assets, which is a totally different story than the AI trading, just trading. Because that's kind of boring. That's like what everyone already does.
00:15:09.909 - 00:15:23.285, Speaker B: Well, I think any AI could be taught to go to Pump fun and generate 10,000 different images and 10,000 different names, like, quite easily, but you can't.
00:15:23.325 - 00:15:26.565, Speaker A: But my point is, in Tradify, you can't do that. That's like a modality that doesn't exist.
00:15:26.605 - 00:15:42.675, Speaker C: Yeah, I don't think that matters so much. I think the thing that does matter, you can say that Solana created 40,000 assets yesterday, but it didn't really. Right. I mean, there's just 40,000 token contracts, but there's only maybe 10 of those that are actually assets by any meaningful definition.
00:15:43.375 - 00:15:49.327, Speaker A: My point though is the point of crypto is that anyone can make the asset. Right?
00:15:49.511 - 00:15:55.367, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, that's fine. That's not the scarce resource. The scarce resource is not SPL token contract.
00:15:55.431 - 00:16:02.435, Speaker A: It's not about scarce resource. It's about the microstructure difference. Right? Like in trad, all the trades concentrate.
00:16:02.775 - 00:16:22.291, Speaker C: Yeah, I don't buy this. I don't buy this. I think the scarce resource that is ultimately now being dominated by these AI meme coins and by these AIs is character attention. And why attention? The answer is through character. Like Truth Terminal is interesting. It says weird, interesting stuff. Now, part of that is the curation of the creator.
00:16:22.291 - 00:16:57.157, Speaker C: We know that now that he's intentionally curating what we're seeing in order to make it maximally interesting. It responds to people in comments, right? It has conversations with people. That is fundamentally new. There's never been a meme coin that talked back to you. And that's part of what makes it so compelling. If you think about it, there kind of have been in that when everyone was trading every single Andre Kronje coin that 5 seconds before it actually launched. Part of what was so interesting is, okay, you talk to the dev, the dev says this and that, and that's part of the game of what makes this thing so compelling.
00:16:57.157 - 00:17:24.307, Speaker C: That's part of why celeb coins are so fun, is that, yeah, the celeb coin talks back to you. Now you've got this AI that talks back to you. That, first of all, is more clever than most of the celebrities, right? Like, I mean, just the way that it writes and, you know, it's literally got the world's intelligence compressed into itself. And, you know, it's obviously superhuman with respect to its verbal intelligence in most senses. So it's just actually really funny. Like, you go read its tweets and like, this is funnier than most meme coin devs. So.
00:17:24.307 - 00:17:46.951, Speaker C: So I think that's the thing that's really new. And now this idea of, okay, you trade. So an AI launches a coin and everyone trades or speculates on the coin. I've actually seen a bunch of startups pitch that idea. It's actually a bunch of people have tried to do that and it doesn't work because no one wants to trade. Just, oh, here's some LLM agent and you can trade its coin. There's a bunch of projects that I know that have tried this and it hasn't worked.
00:17:46.951 - 00:18:23.267, Speaker C: The reason why Truth Terminal tried this is a Truth Terminal is just really charismatic. It's actually funny. It's actually kind of breaking through this noise, this attention game, which is what every meme coin is ultimately competing on. And so I think we are at, in some sense, like a local maximum, that there's a lot of novelty and excitement around the fact that these AIs are actually funny now. And if you did this in GPT3 land, the AIs wouldn't be funny. They would just be kind of incoherent and they just wouldn't be able to keep pace with what's happening in Crypto. But I think the novelty of that will probably wear off within, call it six months would be my guess of, oh, okay.
00:18:23.267 - 00:18:48.783, Speaker C: This AI is really clever and it's like talking back and it's like talking shit and it's got, you know, it's, it's, it's, you know, has all these like, really kind of esoteric, not safe for Work callbacks that it's making and stuff. But once there's like, you know, 50 of those that have a bunch of followers on Twitter, then it's like kind of like, okay, now there's like, okay, it was kind of cool when someone made the first 10K pfp, but now this is like the 40th one. And like, come on, let's, let's try something new.
00:18:48.919 - 00:18:55.823, Speaker B: Well, here, here's my prediction of the AI coins in the future. So for any token, there's really like.
00:18:55.999 - 00:18:58.715, Speaker C: A. I'm trying to get my head.
00:18:59.495 - 00:20:14.541, Speaker B: There's really a spectrum. There's really a spectrum between meme value and work value. Work being what it produces, what goes into it, the hard science, whatever, right? And the AI coins are starting off purely on the meme side. I think what will work long term are the AI coins on the work side that are doing something, whether it's, you know, being funny and getting tips online and it turns into something, you know, or if it's like, you know, solving problems for people or like, you know, automating Ubers, you know, and getting paid a cut of each of it and then tokenizing it, like, work AI will take over over time. And like, crypto wallets are the easiest way for actual AI agents to spend capital and earn capital. And so eventually, you know, when we get out of the easy mode meme based value world into the hard work based value world, AI coins will work and there'll be lots of them and they'll have actual value and sustainability and all these things. But until then, I think we're stuck with this sort of like lowest hanging fruit, which is its value comes from people laughing at the fact that there's a new asset.
00:20:14.653 - 00:20:35.843, Speaker C: Totally. And it's. I mean, it reminds you a little bit. Do you guys remember that NFT collection of. There was this. There was this like Indonesian guy who took a bunch of selfies and turned them into NFTs and it like, went super viral and these NFTs started trading for thousands of dollars. It feels a little bit like that where the Internet, like decided to adopt this weird story.
00:20:35.843 - 00:21:12.595, Speaker C: And it's hilarious that we all collectively agree that this is the thing that we're all going to make worth a lot of money. But I think the rule of thumb in my mind is that when it's a story that it's attached to like a sort of temporal event, that means almost by definition it's going to be transient and it'll be hot for like a few months and then the Attention will wane and people will move on to something else. When there's no story is when there's the real potential for longevity. Right? So like, think about, you know, what's the story around, you know, whiff, or what's the story around Bitcoin for that matter? There's not really a story. It's just like, it's just a meme. That's it. It's just a picture of a dog.
00:21:12.595 - 00:21:50.869, Speaker C: And if you like that, buy the token. And I think in a way, like goat is very tethered to this guy, this AI, this Twitter account, Marc Andreessen being, you know, all these things kind of have to keep happening for the locus of attention to remain on this token. And if it loses that to something else, I think it's hard for there to really be a sustained ecosystem around this thing. That's my intuition. That said, I'm not a meme coin trader. As an industry analyst and as a creative gauntlet, I'm just here to whoever pays me more, I will say that you'll live forever.
00:21:51.037 - 00:22:12.607, Speaker A: I think I agree with you. The attention aspect is important. But I do think unlike social networks, like all of the dreams that people ever sold you on web 3 type of stuff of like owning your own content or whatever, this is actually much closer than all the hundreds of millions of dollars spent on dog shit consumer crypto companies. I will say that.
00:22:12.671 - 00:22:14.767, Speaker C: How is this like owning your own content?
00:22:14.831 - 00:22:39.555, Speaker A: Well, I just mean this is closer to the vision that they had. Right? Because it's like this thing that has this content, how the quality of the content is generating is causing the asset to be worth more. So people who are following it have this reflexive cycle. And in some ways, like all of the attempts at doing that in the past did not, did not, did not have end up having this feedback loop work. Right. It like worked for a few cycles and then it died it, period off. Right.
00:22:39.855 - 00:22:42.835, Speaker C: And I think I see Robert making a skeptical face.
00:22:43.535 - 00:22:44.591, Speaker B: No, that's.
00:22:44.743 - 00:22:50.341, Speaker C: Wait, sorry, Tom. Excuse me. Excuse me. I was saying, Robert, I think it's.
00:22:50.453 - 00:23:33.953, Speaker D: I mean, I guess in some ways it's also a little bit about. It kind of reminds me of teams who get very clever and very cute with their tokenomics around. Oh, here's how the token is going to accrue value and here's how this whole system is going to sort of function. I feel like on average just outperform teams that have a good product and then the token is adjacent to it in some ways. And okay, people know that this thing is valuable and then the token is associated with it and that's going to be it versus, oh, we're going to like micro engineer how this token is associated with the content. So I guess in one hand I see that, but I also feel like it's just a very different kind of model than kind of like a, oh, you can, you know, trade this post or, you know, trade this creator coin or something like that.
00:23:34.089 - 00:23:35.377, Speaker C: And Tom, what would you say?
00:23:35.521 - 00:23:51.095, Speaker B: I would say that eventually there's going to be a million creator coins and the lines between the people and the not people and the androids and anime people, they're all going to blur into one and we're not going to know the difference.
00:23:51.255 - 00:24:27.783, Speaker C: Okay, fair enough. Well, speaking of losing grip on reality, we're about a week away from the election and everything now has reached a fever pitch. It's looking right now in prediction markets that it's going to be roughly 2/3 to 1/3 probability of Trump versus Kamala. But there's still, of course, very, very wide error bars in the polling. And so, you know, we're not going to know. It could end up being a landslide in either direction. That being said, with respect to crypto Trump, of course, who's been the famously pro crypto candidate, he launched his token sale just a couple of weeks ago for World Liberty Finance.
00:24:27.783 - 00:25:09.629, Speaker C: So World Liberty Finance, of course, Trump is affiliated with World Liberty Finance, but there are other founders who are directly responsible for the day to day, particularly the folks who previously founded DOE Finance. So the World Liberty Finance token sale was aiming to raise $300 million at a $1.5 billion valuation. And they were targeting, they were only allowed to be investable for accredited investors in the US and the token itself was non transferable. So out of this target of raising $300 million, they were able to raise 14 million 1, 4. They raised less than 5% of their target. It was kind of a resounding failure.
00:25:09.629 - 00:25:36.605, Speaker C: And as a result, I've seen just a lot of people kind of saying like, okay, great, looks like crypto market is rationalized and we're no longer in the kind of ICO era of just, you know, just rampant stupidity with respect to token projects that are going nowhere. At the same time I saw a lot of people saying like, well, no, this is because it was only available to credit investors. The website was going down. You there was. Because the token's non transferable. That's the problem. Otherwise this thing would have sold out in a hot second.
00:25:36.605 - 00:25:53.017, Speaker C: How do you guys reflect on the failure of World Liberty finance. We just say tentative failure with respect to their fundraising goals. And what it means is Trump potentially going to lose interest in crypto if he hasn't been able to make a bunch of money off of it?
00:25:53.081 - 00:26:19.615, Speaker B: Well, I'll say this as the master of memes. I don't think this project was memed into existence correctly. And I think that this is a problem in that the true master of memes, Trump, was detached from the actual launch and operation of this project and was left to subordinates who don't carry the same mastery of the meme hood.
00:26:20.075 - 00:26:23.075, Speaker D: Robert, I concur with your review of.
00:26:23.975 - 00:26:24.815, Speaker C: Excuse me.
00:26:24.935 - 00:26:31.367, Speaker D: I mean, Tom. Yeah, I don't know if you saw the World Liberty people are really bad.
00:26:31.431 - 00:26:33.235, Speaker A: Trouble listening to this audio.
00:26:33.895 - 00:26:34.359, Speaker D: Sorry.
00:26:34.407 - 00:26:35.715, Speaker C: It's fine, it's fine.
00:26:37.455 - 00:26:56.817, Speaker D: Yeah, it was really bad. I, yeah. Also don't buy the sort of website accredited issues. I just don't think there was like a reason to get involved. There was never really comparing compelling narrative other than it's mildly Trump affiliated but also not explicitly Trump affiliated. And there's not really a good vision. There was not.
00:26:56.817 - 00:27:14.513, Speaker D: There weren't good memes around. It was actually kind of cringy. It was also very on the fringe of crypto. I feel like, like there was not strong endorsement or sort of strong buy in from people who are already in the space. It just felt like this sort of outsider kind of movement. So the whole thing doesn't. I mean, that said, I think if.
00:27:14.529 - 00:27:16.187, Speaker C: Trump, they did get all the advisors.
00:27:16.361 - 00:27:37.343, Speaker D: Yeah. But it was sort of a haphazard like, oh, every week there was some new advisor and okay, great. So it just felt like they came out of the gate really slow. But I was going to say if Trump wins, who knows, the thing could sell out. I don't know what the time limit is for the sale, but it's still going. So if it's still going post election, maybe people want to buy some financial.
00:27:37.399 - 00:27:48.419, Speaker A: Tokens for any, any form of evidence. I think like DJ T is up like almost 2.5x this in. In like the last month or something.
00:27:48.587 - 00:27:51.067, Speaker B: Because that's the true Meme Coin associated.
00:27:51.091 - 00:27:56.347, Speaker A: That's the real Meme coin. Yeah. Like I feel like DJT is the real Meme coin, not the stock. Not.
00:27:56.411 - 00:27:56.939, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:27:57.067 - 00:28:00.315, Speaker D: How are the Trump NFT trading cards doing? I haven't checked.
00:28:00.435 - 00:28:05.211, Speaker B: You know, I got an email today for another NFT Trump collectible.
00:28:05.403 - 00:28:07.187, Speaker C: That's right. Because you're on the mailing list.
00:28:07.251 - 00:28:07.451, Speaker D: Yes.
00:28:07.483 - 00:28:16.119, Speaker C: Yes. Because you bought the first One. That's right. I forgot. Yeah. Interesting. No, this reminds me a lot of a famous bond sale that happened in the late 90s.
00:28:16.119 - 00:28:50.529, Speaker C: It's actually in every financial engineering textbook, it turns out. Yeah. If you're not actually tying the financial performance of this asset to the person in question, the reality is that this token was not going to unlock before the election. So if it's not unlockable and you can't actually see the price go up because you know the sale is extended period of time. I think just tactically that was enough to make it a mistake, which is that that's what people want. People want like I buy Trump. Trump do well number go up and like that's fundamentally what you're selling.
00:28:50.529 - 00:29:03.631, Speaker C: And if you're not actually encapsulating that in the financial characteristics of the product you're selling, then it's like you're selling the wrong thing. You know, you're like trying to sell Trump steaks and instead they're, you know, steak knives or something, you know, just like the wrong thing.
00:29:03.753 - 00:29:27.995, Speaker A: At the risk of alienating people, but probably no one who listens to this podcast. The World Liberty financial launch had urban vibes. You know, where it's like, it's like really far right fringe. No one wants to buy it. It like didn't have like financial performance. Like Urbit was always like getting shield by this like alt right, very, you know, demographic.
00:29:28.035 - 00:29:31.867, Speaker C: I don't think the alt right was shilling World Liberty finance. I don't think anybody was shilling it.
00:29:32.011 - 00:29:32.867, Speaker B: Nobody was.
00:29:32.971 - 00:29:36.643, Speaker A: Yeah, they're in lie about that. Okay, maybe you're right. Maybe it was.
00:29:36.659 - 00:29:43.843, Speaker C: No, there were op eds of like, oh, Trump is making a mistake. You know, people should like pull it. People should get in his ear and tell him not to do this.
00:29:43.979 - 00:29:49.419, Speaker A: But, but I think, I think urban was the same way. It was like attract. Attracting a non existent demographic. Right.
00:29:49.467 - 00:29:52.667, Speaker C: Like people telling urban people like don't do this is bad for your career.
00:29:52.731 - 00:30:04.845, Speaker B: No, but I agree with Haseeb here in that there is no target demographic to fit with the marketing. Who's going to get really hyped about a fork of Doe finance?
00:30:04.925 - 00:30:08.045, Speaker C: Well, they said that they're going to do some kind of stablecoin thing.
00:30:08.205 - 00:30:10.773, Speaker B: Yes. Because everybody has to launch a stablecoin.
00:30:10.829 - 00:30:18.549, Speaker C: But that, but is that just like a go gho fork or does anyone know what they're. Have they given any detail? I'm assuming that.
00:30:18.637 - 00:30:24.185, Speaker B: I think they're trying to pump the ICO with new ideas.
00:30:24.545 - 00:30:40.969, Speaker C: Yeah. Yeah. Well, this thing Seems pretty dead on arrival, unfortunately. But we'll see. We'll check back in post election. If Trump does end up winning, then maybe there'll be some life in this thing. But otherwise it looks like this thing is a pretty big failure.
00:30:40.969 - 00:30:55.637, Speaker C: And supposedly, or my understanding was that Trump or the Trump family or Trump entity gets the proceeds past like 30 million or something and they didn't hit the hurdle. So Trump gets nothing from this failed sale.
00:30:55.701 - 00:30:58.585, Speaker B: Basically, Barron's four wallets will remain empty.
00:30:59.525 - 00:31:00.093, Speaker C: Very sad.
00:31:00.149 - 00:31:02.865, Speaker A: They will be Baron. Baron's wallets will be Baron.
00:31:04.365 - 00:31:06.597, Speaker C: Wow. Wow. Incredible.
00:31:06.661 - 00:31:08.185, Speaker A: That was a Haseeb level joke.
00:31:08.485 - 00:31:18.025, Speaker C: You're on it. You're on it. That was good. Great one, I would not think for a seem to be fast enough to come up with that. Yeah, only three. Nice. Yeah, exactly.
00:31:18.025 - 00:31:40.405, Speaker C: That's a very tarun. That's a very Tarun joke. Okay, last story, I guess one that we have been coming up against again and again is malaise in the Ethereum camp. So Ethereum down bad. Everything in this market, well, not everything. Bitcoin right now is at like 70 north of 70k. Markets are feeling very flush on the backs of potentially seeing a Trump win.
00:31:40.405 - 00:32:17.675, Speaker C: And of course that would likely be bullish for crypto assets across the board. But Ethereum has been lagging. So Ethereum, relative to the other majors, has been probably the weakest among everything that you see in the top 10. And Vitalik has been recently back in Twitter. After having been in hiding on Farcaster for a very long time, he's now back on Twitter, in the fray, kind of going at people. And he's released a long set of blog posts describing the Ethereum roadmap and also in public, starting to more often defend the Ethereum roadmap against some of the detractors. So the standard critique of Ethereum right now has been Ethereum doesn't really have a North Star.
00:32:17.675 - 00:32:56.041, Speaker C: It's kind of, you know, this highfalutin. Okay. We have seven different stages of scaling, you know, the surge, the splurge, the verge, the merge, whatever. And people are like, I don't really get it right. What's the, what's the simple story? The simple story for Solana is, you know, number go up, Solana go fast. And people are really pushing for Ethereum to one, simplify the story and defend the story in public, and second, to try to regain some of the mantle by not allowing so much of this financial activity on the Ethereum ecosystem being sucked up by the L2s and come back more so to the L1. So curious what you guys see.
00:32:56.041 - 00:33:11.249, Speaker C: Do you guys feel like this gambit is working? Is Vitalik's reengagement in the public sphere starting to reignite some of that energy around Ethereum? Or do you feel like this is the last gasps and you know, Ethereum is just losing the narrative war and it's not going to change?
00:33:11.337 - 00:33:44.333, Speaker B: Well, I don't have an opinion so much as I'd like to read one tweet that I found quite appealing and interesting by an account named Molly. 1st time BTC hit 70k eth 4k. 2nd time BTC hit 70k eth 3.9k. 3rd time BTC hit 70k ETH 3.3k. Now BTC hit a 70k for 4th time eth 2.5k. It's almost a haiku of crypto.
00:33:44.429 - 00:33:46.661, Speaker C: Beautiful. Almost like it was written by an AI.
00:33:46.773 - 00:34:03.725, Speaker A: Well, I thought Kobe's tweet of both Bitcoin and Ethereum are $2,000 from their all time high was pretty funny. Like, I mean, obviously that was like last night or whatever, but I thought that was pretty good.
00:34:03.885 - 00:34:06.813, Speaker C: Okay, Robert, what's your take?
00:34:06.949 - 00:35:13.031, Speaker D: I mean, I think, I think people are sort of seeing this as like wartime Vitalik. I think we're not there yet, but I think, you know, like all the sort of quality of life stuff that people are talking about for Ethereum Mainnet actually seem great, right? Like basic stuff like EIP 7701, 7702 things that make the chain more usable for your average person to actually get them to do things. I agree that right now the narrative is very confusing. You tell people use Ethereum and so yeah, I didn't actually mean Ethereum, I meant an EVM chain, an EVM roll up that is on Ethereum or oh, you are on one roll up, you have to go to another roll up. I do think the roadmap to a certain extent does address this and there's a vision for how this all kind of comes together. But that doesn't really resonate with people who are potentially buying ETH or using eth. And so I think a lot of it is just a narrative battle and Ethereum just doesn't have the kind of same, I feel like, momentum or sort of wartime mentality as I think other chains or other sort of ecosystems.
00:35:13.031 - 00:35:19.315, Speaker D: It's much more of a kumbaya. Let's all do some research and talk about our cypherpunk vision together.
00:35:19.815 - 00:35:25.795, Speaker C: Yeah. Haseeb, do you think that Vitalik has the capacity to be a wartime CEO.
00:35:26.815 - 00:36:18.423, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean I do think the ticker is Eth tweet became quite shared and memed. I think the kind of interesting thing to me about it is there is a sense in which the L2s themselves, I think because of how much they've spent time warring with each other, have sort of made Ethereum. It feels in some sometimes like they've made Ethereum collateral damage in the process. Not, not just from like, hey, there's less economic value or fees. I actually don't think that's the thing that's driving it, but I think like the way they're like fighting over each other kind of almost emphasizes the flaws in Ethereum more. Right. Like each roll up being like, you don't have my feature, this sucks.
00:36:18.423 - 00:36:58.225, Speaker A: Kind of like just to an outsider who it's their first time looking at crypto, if they just read crypto Twitter for like an hour, they're just going to be like, wow. Only these Ethereum roll ups are saying things that are also built on Ethereum suck. So there's this kind of Spider man meme problem where everyone is pointing at each other instead of trying to understand the global problem, which I feel like is a thing. I think you often see a lot of other communities point out about Ethereum. Ethereum is like, there's kind of this like incoherence in that way. But I do think, you know, from a technical level, I thought Vitalik's posts were really good. Right.
00:36:58.225 - 00:37:37.803, Speaker A: One thing about them that you have to respect and I think people on Twitter don't have the attention. Attention span to respect is that Vitalik spends a lot of time going through the trade offs of each of these decisions and like really laying out like here's the dialectic of like, if we did this, this happens. If we do this, this happens. And here's the reason we should do one, one of the two things. And I think that type of stuff to Tom's point is just like, is that discernible to the person average net new eth buyer? Not really. Right. Like they, they have the, they have the literacy of wanting to buy goat without reading about the story.
00:37:37.803 - 00:37:41.205, Speaker A: Like me when I just was like, oh wow. Mark Andreessen.
00:37:41.245 - 00:37:56.237, Speaker C: Well, hold on. I want to defend the people who are, you know, getting excited about the ticker is eth like you to be a good leader, you need both the micro and the macro. And it's not enough to have ownership over the details. You also need to be able to sell the big vision.
00:37:56.301 - 00:38:04.117, Speaker A: I think Vitalik actually does a good job. I think the roll up founders do a much less good job, let's put it that way. And I think in order to sell.
00:38:04.141 - 00:38:06.419, Speaker C: The vision, I feel like it's the other way around.
00:38:06.597 - 00:38:14.911, Speaker A: I think to sell the vision of Ethereum at large, you need the consortium, because they are a consortium effectively. Right?
00:38:15.063 - 00:39:02.711, Speaker C: Kind of. I'm sort of like, look, if you're Vitalik, you're not allowed to say, well, the roll up people are not really in synchrony with me. And therefore I'm just going to focus on the technical roadmap and just keep repeating the seven stage diagram until people get it, you know, like that. That does feel to me like the wrong answer. Now I do think, I do think Vitalik has heard the message and it feels like he is adapting his own messaging. And it is a little disheartening to see people treating Vitalik like he runs a meme coin and like, you can tell, like the verbiage of the ticker is eth and you know, eth is good or whatever. Like, this is like people are getting excited when he talks like it's a meme coin, which is obviously the wrong quantum of capital that you need in order to move something.
00:39:02.711 - 00:40:06.229, Speaker C: Like Ether is not getting meme coin traders on Ethereum or on Twitter excited. You need a lot more than that in order to get Ethereum pumping blood through its veins again. But it does feel like having that kind of muscular leadership and vision and also acknowledging that, hey, Ethereum is behind the ball. And we kind of do need to step up our storytelling and our evangelizing beyond just to the cypherpunk base and beyond just to the technical kind of inner circle of Ethereum, right? If you read through a lot of this stuff, it's well written, it's coherent, it's cohesive, it's an explainer, right? It's like it's very much in line with his explainers about, well, here's how ZK works, here's how diagonalization works, here's how Starks work, here's how whatever, um, which feels like the wrong, the wrong Vitalik that we need right now, you know, or that Ethereum needs right now. Ethereum needs a Vitalik that is more like the proselytizer who showed up in 2014.
00:40:06.357 - 00:40:59.185, Speaker A: But I guess my point for the roll up piece that I'm trying to make is like, when imagine I'm a consumer app that has a verticalized interface like Poly Market or like something like, imagine there's a Poly Market app. Right? That was just on a roll up on one of these rolls. There's a sense in which the roll ups themselves are constantly fudding each other for like, your roll up sucks. And this doesn't work to the point that the end consumer, who doesn't give a shit about the technical stuff and will never look at that stuff, they'll never read the Vitalik post, they're never going to even look at it. They just had a Binance account and they were like, okay, now I'm going to withdraw because I want to use this app. That marginal new user gets these infinite number of conflicting signals about which roll up to go to. Why should I use this app? What should I go to? And I feel like that actually is the hard part.
00:40:59.185 - 00:41:46.109, Speaker A: Like this onboarding problem for Net New versus Solana, it's just like, oh, just go to this one thing. There's one app, go to Phantom effectively. And I feel like that fragmentation and then also them saying everything is bad about each other makes it so confusing for a new user. And to me, that's the thing that I don't know how you fix. In kind of the Ethereum world, there's this kind of famous phrase in distributed programming of why it's hard, which is you can pull a carriage with two horses, but can you pull a carriage with 10, 24 chickens? And in some way, somehow the roll ups trying to pull the whole ecosystem feels a little bit like the ladder more than the former. Sometimes not always right, but sometimes it has that, that candor.
00:41:46.197 - 00:42:03.389, Speaker C: Wow, Haseeb, that was a really deep metaphor. Very, very typical of your wisdom on the show. I'm very impressed. Great. Well, with that we're going to wrap. Hope you all have a very good Halloween and we'll be back next week for some election craziness.
00:42:03.557 - 00:42:07.705, Speaker A: Don't forget, Haseeb is really Superman under the covers.
00:42:08.525 - 00:42:13.865, Speaker C: Yes, he is. Yes, he is. All right, thanks everyone. We'll be back next week. Dianara, see y'all.
