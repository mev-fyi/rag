00:00:00.170 - 00:00:40.340, Speaker A: Mean, I think obviously the situation is not ideal, and I wish that this didn't happen. I do think it's important that users funds are protected at the actual l one, and in a perfect world this wouldn't happen. But I think that given the situation, for better or worse, Salana has gotten very good at these restarts. And I think if you were to look at another network with similar decentralization characteristics as Salana, where you have hundreds of validators or thousands of validators, I think a five hour restart is pretty good. I don't know how an ethereum or these other l ones would handle a similar situation.
