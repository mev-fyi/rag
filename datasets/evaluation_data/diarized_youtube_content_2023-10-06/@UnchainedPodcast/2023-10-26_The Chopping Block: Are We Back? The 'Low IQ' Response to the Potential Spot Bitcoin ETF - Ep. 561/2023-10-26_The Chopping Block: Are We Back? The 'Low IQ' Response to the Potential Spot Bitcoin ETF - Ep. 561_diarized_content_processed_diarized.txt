00:00:00.090 - 00:00:19.210, Speaker A: I don't want to say we're back or we're so back, but as an industry, I think there's a little bit of animal spirits that are creeping into all the conversations, and I think it's energizing for investors, for founders, for speculators, for media. There's some mojo coming back. Not a dividend.
00:00:19.290 - 00:00:20.522, Speaker B: It's a tale of two quan.
00:00:20.586 - 00:00:23.242, Speaker C: Now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet.
00:00:23.306 - 00:00:25.794, Speaker D: Generally speaking, airdrops are kind of pointless anyways.
00:00:25.922 - 00:00:28.658, Speaker C: Unnamed trading firms who are very involved.
00:00:28.754 - 00:00:31.298, Speaker B: Alec ETH is the ultimate Defi.
00:00:31.314 - 00:00:33.880, Speaker A: Protocols are the antidote to this problem.
00:00:34.410 - 00:00:45.030, Speaker C: Hello, everybody. Welcome to the chopping block. Every couple weeks, the four of us get together and give the industry insiders perspective on the crypto topics of the day. So quick intros. First, you've got Tom, the Defi maven and master of memes.
00:00:45.190 - 00:00:45.898, Speaker A: Hi.
00:00:46.064 - 00:00:47.900, Speaker D: That's all I got. I don't know.
00:00:50.350 - 00:01:16.126, Speaker C: Everybody. We decided to start doing this thing. When we do the intro, everyone says something, and that was all that Tom's got is high. So it's a good way to inaugurate this new GM, Robert cryptoconissur and the czar of Superstate GM, everybody. Then we've got Tarun, the gigabrain, and grandpuba at Gauntlet Eridosh. And I'm Haseeb, the head hype man at Dragonfly. We are the early stage investors, and we are early stage investors in crypto.
00:01:16.126 - 00:01:17.278, Speaker C: But I want to caveat that nothing.
00:01:17.304 - 00:01:20.530, Speaker B: We say here, haseeb, you're giving yourself an update.
00:01:20.690 - 00:01:21.880, Speaker C: It's a bull market.
00:01:22.410 - 00:01:29.054, Speaker B: One of the big fund partners take kind of leaves, and all of a sudden now Haseeb's like, I'm the partner.
00:01:29.202 - 00:01:41.798, Speaker C: Look, I'm feeling giddy, okay? Numbers up again. Bitcoin's doing well. Suddenly, all of a sudden, we're cool kids again. And I'm feeling it. I'm feeling excited. Let me finish the disclosures. Let me finish the disclosures.
00:01:41.798 - 00:01:59.234, Speaker C: Nothing we say here is investment advice, legal advice, or even life advice. Please see chopping blocks at XYZ for more disclosures. Okay, so in case you haven't noticed, bitcoin is up. Bitcoin touched $35,000 yesterday. We're taping this as of Tuesday. I'm sure bitcoin is probably at 60K plus by the time you're listening to this. No.
00:01:59.234 - 00:02:38.842, Speaker C: So bitcoin is up over 100% this year so far, despite the fact that a lot of people have been dooming and glooming for most of this year. Now, why exactly did bitcoin go up so much? Nobody really quite knows. It's kind of said that, well, maybe it's some ETF excitement. Although the ETF has already been kind of barreling toward launch. There was a story yesterday that BlackRock, which is supposed to be launching their iShares bitcoin trust, finally got a QSIP and a ticker, and that ticker was listed on DTCC as IBTC. And this seemed to get the whole Internet excited that this was all imminent and it was about to happen. And then, boom, markets just kind of went vertical.
00:02:38.842 - 00:02:55.490, Speaker C: So it's been an interesting day. Normally, my Twitter feed is a lot of people talking about intents and kind of complaining about why there's no product market fit in crypto. And for the first time in a while, my feed was just people celebrating. Guys, how does it feel to finally be in a real industry?
00:02:56.230 - 00:03:14.746, Speaker A: Know, I don't want to say we're back or we're so back, but as an industry, I think there's a little bit of animal spirits that are creeping into all the conversations, and I think it's energizing for investors, for founders, for speculators, for media. There's some mojo coming back.
00:03:14.848 - 00:03:38.286, Speaker D: I think you have to issue an apology to the cointelegraph intern from last week who got roasted for the false. I mean, if you. If you do think the ETF is sort of the source of news, there was also the double fake out, right, where it's like ticker got listed on DTCC, then it got removed, and then it was just re added like an hour or two ago. And so I don't think anyone really knows what's going on. It's all been kind of silly.
00:03:38.398 - 00:04:09.398, Speaker C: Well, the reason why the ticker matters is that supposedly this is one of the final steps before an ETF actually gets listed, or it shows that Blackrock's like, yo, this ETF is ready to go. Just give us the word and then we're going to get it live. It, I think, made people feel like it's real. And to be clear, this is happening amidst a backdrop where equities are getting killed across the board. And so there was a period of time when bitcoin was basically trading in line with equities. And every day you saw whatever the Nasdaq was doing was what bitcoin was doing. Now, a lot of that was mostly due to macro.
00:04:09.398 - 00:04:33.940, Speaker C: I think it was rather than being tied to equities, it was more tied to interest rates. But interest rates have been kind of actually sitting, actually pretty negative for a while. We've seen the story of higher for longer, which is that interest rates are not going to come down quite as soon as people thought. But crypto has been pretty resilient, and I think it shows a real decoupling between equities and crypto, which is good. That's part of the story that people have been wanting to tell about crypto for a long time.
00:04:34.390 - 00:05:06.830, Speaker B: I think there was an article yesterday or two days ago that we had the highest amount of capital flight from China ever from their chinese equities market. I think it was like $75 billion. I forget if it was this year. I think it was this year annualized. So if there's that much capital sitting out there, it has to go somewhere. And I feel like crypto is probably the easiest thing for foreign assets leaving China to go to. Maybe it's a little too simplistic of a theory.
00:05:08.130 - 00:05:12.922, Speaker C: The timing of it does not line up right. Like, clearly this is a US regulation driven.
00:05:13.066 - 00:05:23.620, Speaker B: No, I agree. I agree. But that money has to get reinvested and they need any news to go. I feel like I'm not convinced. It's like american dollars that push this.
00:05:24.630 - 00:05:25.794, Speaker A: I'm convinced.
00:05:25.922 - 00:05:27.170, Speaker C: Robert, why are you convinced?
00:05:27.250 - 00:06:20.998, Speaker A: Well, I'm convinced because so much of it is tied on a temporal basis to the Blackrock bitcoin ETF news. And whether it's like fact or causation or correlation or biases, everyone I've been hearing from on crypto, Twitter, in telegram groups, everybody is pointing towards the Blackrock ETF as their motivation for logging bitcoin. And so even if there are other ancillary flows, bitcoin is directly causing people that you see on the Internet to respond with not even necessarily correct assumptions, but to say, well, Blackrock ETF is going to be approved. They're the biggest asset manager on earth. Bitcoin is worth less than a trillion. They manage close to $10 trillion. Bitcoin go up.
00:06:20.998 - 00:06:28.226, Speaker A: And it's the low IQ response, but there's so many people making that response.
00:06:28.418 - 00:06:43.382, Speaker C: Okay, let's take a step back. Robert, can you explain for the audience, first of all, what exactly is an ETF? We've been talking about this story for a long time, but we never actually really explained what an ETF is and why it matters that supposedly Blackrock is going to make one for bitcoin.
00:06:43.526 - 00:07:15.874, Speaker A: So that's a great question. So I'll try to summarize what an ETF is. So an ETF is an open ended investment vehicle. It's not a closed ended vehicle that raises capital and then invests that fixed amount of capital. It has a flexible amount of capital that it invests. And the way it works is an ETF has a benchmark or a basket of what it's trying to buy, which is generally disclosed in the name of the fund and the prospectus. In this case, if we're using the Blackrock bitcoin ETF as an example, its goal is to buy bitcoin.
00:07:15.874 - 00:08:25.370, Speaker A: And when people want this asset, they can buy it, whether it's going to be on fidelity or E trade or Robinhood or wherever they're able to access investments from a brokerage account. When they buy this ETF, it puts upward pressure or market forces on the ETF itself. And what happens is shares of the ETF are created and destroyed based on market demand. Every ETF has an authorized participant, or multiple authorized participants that effectuate the process of making new shares or redeeming shares of the fund. And what happens is, when the price of the fund gets a little tiny bit over the fair value of what it's supposed to be, these authorized participants go out and make more shares of the fund. And they do this by, in the case of a bitcoin ETF, buying bitcoin, stuffing into the fund, and getting new shares, which they then provide to the market itself. And so using this structure, a fund is able to very easily take in as much new demand as it can as people are able to invest in it, without having to launch another fund or increase an investment mandate.
00:08:25.370 - 00:09:01.882, Speaker A: It can scale from zero to infinite, essentially very smoothly and very elastically. And it's an important thing to note that ETFs are a relatively modern financial instrument. They didn't really exist until the mid 90s. They only exist because the SEC was willing to work with industry participants and create new investment vehicles. But it's a relatively new structure, and it's conquered everything. Over the last 20 years, ETFs went from like an experiment to being a market dominating instrument. And so they've won the market because they're so flexible and they work so well.
00:09:01.882 - 00:09:43.698, Speaker A: And so the public's perception of a bitcoin ETF is that whatever amount of demand exists out there, that's not currently flowing into bitcoin, because most people don't know how to sign up for Coinbase, and they don't know how to buy bitcoin directly, or they're already set up with Robinhood and E trade and Vanguard and the things they already use that. There's all of this latent demand that just the bar is still a little bit too high. And once there's an ETF, it's easy enough for the broad public to move their capital into it. And indirectly, every dollar they move in winds up buying a dollar of bitcoin. And so the expectations are, it's lowering the bar, it's making it easier. More capital is going to flow in, and that's going to lead to price appreciation.
00:09:43.874 - 00:10:21.262, Speaker C: So, okay, we've talked before about that story, which is, okay, the bar is being lowered. It's easier to buy it in your Schwab account or whatever. Of course, many of these brokers already offer buying bitcoin. It's not easy, necessarily, but fidelity has it and you can buy it in. There's a bunch of folks who have partnerships with Coinbase, so you can buy through Coinbase or whatever, things like this. It seems to me like the bigger story is more around institutions for us. We speak to a lot of institutions, and when we say institutions, we mean like family offices, endowments, these kinds of organizations.
00:10:21.262 - 00:11:03.834, Speaker C: They have a really easy time buying bitcoin if they buy it in an ETF, because ETFs, everything they buy is through ETFs, right? For example, you want to buy gold. How do you buy gold? The way you buy gold is you buy through the ishares gold. ETF, that is the most liquid form of gold in the world is the gold ETF. And so people are kind of analogizing that. Okay, well, if everybody in the world is buying their gold this way, and gold is gold, bitcoin is trying to replace gold in some sense. Maybe this is the way that we're going to see bitcoin become institutionalized in the way in which eventually central banks or whatever are going to buy it is not by buying spot bitcoin and having ledgers in a vault somewhere. They're going to do it by buying ETFs the way that they buy all these other financial assets.
00:11:03.834 - 00:11:12.418, Speaker C: That's the story. And I find that story to be plausible. The question really is, how big of a deal actually is this in the long run?
00:11:12.504 - 00:12:05.762, Speaker A: Well, I would posit that it's less a big deal than gold simply because what an ETF allows you to do is buy essentially an infinite amount of the asset. Not infinite, but a crazy large amount of the asset with the same amount of difficulty as buying a small amount of the asset. Now, gold is something where even buying a small amount of gold and storing it is really difficult and really cumbersome. Prior to there being an ETF. Like if you, prior to ETFs, wanted to go out and invest in gold, oftentimes people were investing in gold miners because that was the easiest asset to gain exposure to them. An ETF makes you able to have the ability to drop as much capital as you want into gold at the click of a button into gold itself, and not like some adjacent investment that's correlated to it. And right now you can drop a huge amount of money into bitcoin with a click that isn't as profound of a change.
00:12:05.762 - 00:12:34.766, Speaker A: Whereas gold, just the storage difficulty and costs and cumbersomeness of the physical commodity that takes up meat space was difficult. And one of the biggest advantages of bitcoin that everybody has been trumpeting for the last ten plus years is that it's not heavy, it doesn't take up any space. And moving a million dollars of bitcoin is the same difficulty as moving a dollar of bitcoin. So I don't think the impact will be as big, but I still think.
00:12:34.788 - 00:12:57.842, Speaker C: It'S going to be big. Yeah. And it is also true that, look, as much as we all think of Coinbase and these other organizations as being very trustworthy institutions from the perspective of very, very large financial. Know, if you're a sovereign wealth fund, if you're a central bank, if you're even just like a very large foundation or endowment, you don't think of Coinbase as a big trustworthy counterparty. You think of Coinbase as like, what, $10 billion?
00:12:57.896 - 00:13:09.670, Speaker B: Yeah, but the irony is that a lot of the ETFs are custodying at Coinbase. So you're sort of implicitly doing the same thing, even though you might not be realizing it. Mr. 30 IQ ETF purchaser.
00:13:11.450 - 00:13:32.350, Speaker C: But the reality is like, look, once Blackrock is on board, it's sort of like you got the full faith and credit of Blackrock, which is how much assets they manage, like in the trillions. They're the largest asset manager in the world. Right? And so it's kind of like, look, if Coinbase's custody business goes under, like, Blackrock is going to figure it out, that's kind of more or less what you're assuming.
00:13:32.850 - 00:13:43.460, Speaker B: Liability shield insurance stuff. But there is still some irony that the person who didn't buy is like, implicitly kind of taking Coinbase's services so they might as well.
00:13:43.990 - 00:14:07.366, Speaker C: A lot of the advantage of this is not the actual underlying mechanics, but rather that you don't have to bring any of the stuff up to your investment committee. So when you're like, hey, we should go buy some bitcoin. No one ever has to mention the word Coinbase. No one ever has to mention anything but Blackrock and ETF. And yes or no, and boom. And that, I think, is what actually does grease a lot of the wheels of how bitcoin ends up on more institutional balance sheets.
00:14:07.478 - 00:15:11.742, Speaker A: Although very sophisticated market participants will understand the nuance of each ETF, what the small edge case risks are, and how to price it differently to physical as well as other ETFs. I mean, the same thing happens in gold and other assets, where there's multiple ways to gain exposure to one underlying asset. The most sophisticated hedge funds out there will be like ripping apart these documents to figure out exactly how they work and why they work, and being able to put on trades accordingly. One thing we haven't talked about, which I actually think is worth mentioning, is that one of the other advantages of ETFs is that you can have derivative instruments tied to them. So an ETF could have a whole slew of options that trade on top of the ETF. And so what this will unlock is just new ways for people to have complex positions built on top of bitcoin that they might not already have access to. And so I do think some people are going to say, well, what is the extreme edge case put worth on a bitcoin ETF that might represent the custody risk inherent in it, and be able to price this out in really interesting ways?
00:15:11.876 - 00:15:25.730, Speaker C: It's very true. Right now, if you want bitcoin options, you kind of have to go to Derbit and Derbit. Obviously, in crypto land, we're fine with Derbit. But if you want to get institutional capital buying and selling bitcoin options, it's not going to happen on Derbit, most likely.
00:15:25.890 - 00:15:39.350, Speaker B: I'm just not that convinced that the lit market derivatives are going to be better than the non KYC market derivatives or like approximately non KYC, because not now. Yeah, I just kind of feel like.
00:15:39.420 - 00:15:43.514, Speaker C: Crypto has been in five years. I draw the line out particularly good.
00:15:43.552 - 00:16:17.898, Speaker B: At building its own derivatives markets elsewhere. Right. This is why I feel like the gold ETF comparison is kind of like useless. Because as someone who used to trade commodity futures, I will say that I generally view the products in traditional finance as shittier than crypto in a lot of ways. Ux wise, dealing with the fucking clearing agent, the CME tells you that they're changing an order type and you can't argue with them. I honestly think the derivatives market is actually worse in the traditional world. And from what you can do with it manner.
00:16:17.898 - 00:16:36.090, Speaker B: So I kind of feel like we're going to just get boring vanilla stuff. Like, look at the CME bitcoin product. They don't even have a good enough strip of options on futures to make a vix on it correctly. The entire thing is kind of useless. It looks like a kind of shit version of everything we see in Defi.
00:16:36.590 - 00:16:45.360, Speaker A: But that's why a spot ETF is more exciting is that the CME futures are not that liquid. There's not even liquidity between calendar months at.
00:16:47.170 - 00:17:23.100, Speaker B: This will. I think this will fix that, right? This is like some duct tape around a shit sandwich. That is the current US regulated crypto stuff. But I don't think this is going to be some grandiose thing. Now, will the ETF mean that there's going to be more people in their retirement accounts trusting it? I think this is more about the branding aspect of people being like, oh, this is way more legit than it is about market efficiency. I honestly feel like the crypto markets themselves advance themselves a lot faster than most things in traditional. I would argue that most people who leave traditional finance for crypto leave for that reason.
00:17:23.100 - 00:17:25.610, Speaker B: They kind of can see that in it.
00:17:25.680 - 00:17:36.202, Speaker A: Yeah, because crypto leapfrogs all of the tech of the last generation, and now it's like everyone's excited that it's going back to the last generation of tech with exposure to a crypto asset.
00:17:36.266 - 00:18:11.994, Speaker C: Well, they're going to coexist, right? Like, there's going to be the global unregulated market for a long, long, long time. I don't think even in five years this global overseas market is going to go away, but it's going to coexist with this regulated onshore market that's very clean and spic and span, and yes, it's kind of old and janky, but if you're like, look, I need to hedge this weird risk that I can't hedge through the CME. If you're smart enough and you have enough tentacles overseas, you can find a way to go on binance or darebit or whatever the future, whatever the last survivor of the Wild west is going to be, and go hedge your risk over there instead.
00:18:12.192 - 00:18:42.798, Speaker B: I think the more interesting thing to me is going to be the fact that the capital flows in crypto tend to have this domino effect. It's like bitcoin goes up old school. Bitcoin holders start selling and buying other assets, maybe ETH, maybe Seoul, whatever. And then those have a much higher run because there's a little lower liquidity and there's this trickle down, kind of like pachinko like thing going on. You know, that game, that's not pachinko.
00:18:42.814 - 00:18:44.260, Speaker C: On the screen real quick for the.
00:18:44.630 - 00:19:09.194, Speaker B: This is kind of how things move. Whereas in the traditional markets, oftentimes what happens is adds or removes from an ETF. So, like, let's say I'm trading a biotech ETF. If the biotech index person removes a particular name, then a ton of people who are tracking the ETF or have to hold the ETF have suddenly sell a ton of that.
00:19:09.232 - 00:19:09.434, Speaker C: Right.
00:19:09.472 - 00:19:24.686, Speaker B: And a lot of the liquidity games in equities really depend on the fact that there's so much of this passive capital that people are sort of tracking, and that completely changes the inflows and outflows. But in crypto, it's kind of different.
00:19:24.788 - 00:19:25.054, Speaker C: Right.
00:19:25.092 - 00:19:39.906, Speaker B: It's like this pachinko thing. And I think that's sort of why I'm not sure how much the ETF influences the grand scheme of market structure. I think it just helps some grandmothers ensure that their 401K is slightly more crypto heavy.
00:19:40.098 - 00:19:43.030, Speaker C: Well, some grandmas and some pension funds. I think it's a little bit of both.
00:19:43.100 - 00:19:48.306, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, those are related very indirectly.
00:19:48.338 - 00:20:21.506, Speaker C: Yes. Or I guess, Richard, directly. Okay, so TLDR number went up. Everyone happy? Let's hope it keeps going up, because just for some very quick numbers, for those of you who are playing at home, bitcoin right now is up about 100% on the year. The Nasdaq, by comparison, is up about 35% on the year. So bitcoin has pretty dramatically outperformed the stock market, even despite the fact that the tech sector, on the whole, and the Nasdaq is very tech heavy, has been doing well. Bitcoin has just been crushing for the year, and, of course, ETH not far behind.
00:20:21.506 - 00:21:25.750, Speaker C: Now, on the other hand, there have been some negative stories going around in the news. So, of course, there's a big conflict that is brewing in the Middle east between Israel and Hamas. And there was a story that took place recently from the Wall Street Journal talking about how Hamas had received, supposedly a bunch of donations in the form of crypto. And this led Elizabeth Warren, a US democratic senator who's known as being very far left in the US, to announce that she was going to try to galvanize her anti crypto army, as she has previously called it, to try to get a new law passed to crack down on terrorist financing and illicit uses of crypto. Now, the problem with this story is that despite the fact that the Wall Street Journal published this story claiming that 90 million plus dollars of cryptocurrency were received by Hamas, this turned out to be incorrect. Actually, there was a story that was put out by chainalysis, which is the leading company that works with law enforcement and government agencies to try to track down the flow of funds in crypto. They're basically more or less the world experts at this stuff.
00:21:25.750 - 00:22:11.080, Speaker C: They published an analysis that showed, this is totally wrong. This was the wrong way to read what was actually happening on the chain. Looking at the events on chain, which everybody can go see for themselves what the Wall Street Journal used as evidence, which is the beautiful thing about blockchain, is that you can just go look at it yourself and see, ah, here's the sleuthing they did. And actually they sort of misread the chain of transactions. And in reality, the amount of capital you should be attributing to Hamas is $450,000, not 90 million. Wall Street Journal has not published a retraction, but everybody on crypto, Twitter is mad at them because they seem to be giving fodder to people who are now spreading this story that crypto is once again being used to do bad things in the broader world. Any thoughts, reflections on this whole hamas crypto stuff?
00:22:11.850 - 00:23:00.994, Speaker A: Well, my reflections are really quite simple. For those of us that have been in the industry for a long time, for law enforcement that's been working in the industry a long time, there's a public understanding that crypto is just bad for illicit financing because it's so transparent. Circuit 2011 2012, when nobody knew how to do all of this stuff. Yeah, everyone assumed that crypto was for bad actors and bad things, and that narrative has stuck. But to everybody that's evolved from the 2011 2012 era, we know just fundamentally how bad of a tool it is for illegal finance, for certain other things, it's the only payment rails, like where people are. What was that phrase? Where they're, like, locking the computers. Ransomware.
00:23:01.042 - 00:23:01.506, Speaker C: Ransomware.
00:23:01.538 - 00:23:02.594, Speaker A: Ransomware. Ransomware.
00:23:02.642 - 00:23:07.650, Speaker C: There you go. All right, grandpa.
00:23:07.730 - 00:23:10.174, Speaker A: Yeah, locking the computers when they're ran.
00:23:10.322 - 00:23:14.634, Speaker B: I feel like you should write ransomware for babies with that one.
00:23:14.832 - 00:23:15.642, Speaker C: Oh, good.
00:23:15.776 - 00:23:39.438, Speaker A: For things like ransomware, where there's no traditional payment rails available at all to ask for ransom. Yeah, like, they use crypto, but all the crypto they use is radically transparent in where it's going, how it's being used, and it's able to be tracked. Crypto is not great at illegal finance. Hamas recognizes it, too. They put out statements previously saying, don't send us crypto. It's too easily tracked and seized.
00:23:39.614 - 00:23:48.582, Speaker B: I mean, Israel just asked finance to freeze all their assets of finance, and that happened almost like on October eigth. Within 24 hours.
00:23:48.716 - 00:24:46.230, Speaker A: Absolutely. And so the frustrating thing is to see misinformation that becomes the basis for more misinformation in this negative feedback loop, because the Wall Street Journal runs an incorrect story. I've now seen so many stories that cite the Wall Street Journal article as fact, which now there's not one story that's misinformation. There's 50 stories that are based on an incorrect publication, and we're winding up in a position where there's a factually incorrect narrative that's spreading. And this is just really frustrating to see as an industry participant, because there's such an understanding within the administration about combating misinformation in other sectors and in other places online where there's an embrace, very clearly, of misinformation that's happening with reporting regarding the use of crypto in terrorist financing. And that's frustrating.
00:24:46.650 - 00:25:09.214, Speaker C: I mean, look for the Elizabeth Warren camp. This has always been her calling card, is that crypto is evil. Technology generally is evil. Big. Somehow both big tech companies are evil, and crypto just trying to disrupt traditional companies as evil. Basically, everything that is not, I don't know, small business financing or her particular constituents is evil. So I don't think that she cares whether or not this story is true.
00:25:09.214 - 00:26:01.262, Speaker C: It's, like, emotionally true. And I think that's the basis for them kind of taking this moment to grandstand and say, oh, look how crypto is so evil, and it's doing all these terrible things. I totally agree with you, Robert. This story, the sense that people have that crypto is mostly used by thugs and terrorists and bad guys has really, it's incredibly sticky story, despite the fact that the facts on the ground have changed. And you go talk to FBI agents, you talk to prosecutors, you talk to all these people, and they're like, yeah, using crypto for crime today is stupid. It is not a good idea, because literally, that means there is a public record that stays around forever, that if you ever mess up once, we can find it and we can track it down, or we can make it impossible for you to cash out that money, which does not apply to almost any other form of currency. Most other times, if you get your money out and you do your getaway, you have the money, it's done.
00:26:01.262 - 00:26:37.254, Speaker C: Unless they catch you, it's game over. And crypto is the one thing that we're still discovering. I mean, that's why you have something like Zach XpT who's going out discovering all these frauds and scams. There is no such thing as that for the normal world. There's nobody who's just sort of looking around on the Internet and being like, ah, I can tell that this person is stealing money from their customers and something. It's only possible because it is so easy to divine these things by looking at the actual record on the blockchain. So, yeah, it is frustrating to see, but in a sense also unsurprising that this is know political actors are using the present moment to their advantages.
00:26:37.254 - 00:26:40.026, Speaker C: Tom, you got a hot take? I don't have a hot take.
00:26:40.048 - 00:27:00.158, Speaker D: I mean, I think it was exactly what Robert said. Like Hamas himself said, hey, don't set us crypto. And actually the crypto contributions have fallen off massively in the past, like two years. So basically nothing. All this stuff is kind of very heavily backdated or backweighted anyway. So, yeah, I mean, it just feels like people tell the story that they want to tell independent of the facts.
00:27:00.334 - 00:27:16.534, Speaker B: Yeah, I do feel like the US political class's ability to be so illiterate about both AI and crypto is one of the most fascinating things I've ever observed. It's like actually kind of shocking. I mean, the EU seems pretty illiterate about AI, of course.
00:27:16.572 - 00:27:19.562, Speaker C: Is there any political class that's good at these things?
00:27:19.696 - 00:27:22.460, Speaker B: I feel like you go to Asia, it's totally different, right?
00:27:24.670 - 00:27:25.482, Speaker C: Much better.
00:27:25.616 - 00:27:39.658, Speaker B: At least like Singapore, India, at least there's like a light bulb going on in people's brain. Everywhere else, it's like, oh, we elect 90 year olds who have like two functioning neurons and maybe sometimes zero because they keep freezing on TV.
00:27:39.754 - 00:27:48.580, Speaker A: I mean, yes, but even like a couple of years ago, the japanese minister of technology had never used a computer and refused to use a computer. And that was a big story.
00:27:49.110 - 00:27:50.498, Speaker B: That does sound great.
00:27:50.584 - 00:28:31.566, Speaker C: That's nuts. That's pretty legit. Wow. Yeah, look, I kind of. Yes, maybe. I think also at the same time, you have a lot of push within the administration to try to crack down on privacy. There was a story a little bit earlier about Finsen creating a new designation for mixers and basically trying to rope in a lot of other categories of things in DeFi or just normal type of wallet behavior, such as, for example, anonymizing your address after sending something to a fresh address them considering that to be mixing activity, which is kind of crazy, right? Obviously, that's just a baseline of good opSec, which there's no nefarious reason behind doing that.
00:28:31.566 - 00:29:12.762, Speaker C: It's just wanting to make sure that it's not very easy to track down what you're doing just for your own financial privacy reasons, not because you're trying to obfuscate or create some big anonymity set for yourself. And so at the same time, there is this very intentional seeming understanding from the administration about what they're doing and how they're targeting different. They're trying to sort of crack at the or chip at, I should say, the boundaries of how we think about the industry and where the regulatory surface area should lie. So I think it's kind of both in some sense. Yes, there's enormous ignorance, but there's also very clear and tactical strategy behind trying to erode at the legal and regulatory boundaries of what we're doing in crypto.
00:29:12.906 - 00:29:17.310, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, if you take the kind of like 500,000 foot view.
00:29:17.380 - 00:29:17.614, Speaker C: Right.
00:29:17.652 - 00:29:49.126, Speaker B: Like crypto is trying to disrupt some notion of societal trust, and obviously that's going to bristle certain feathers of people who are gatekeepers of societal trust. But at the same time, I don't even think the gatekeepers understand the power they have and don't have, which is even more embarrassing to me. They kind of just try to, I feel like they don't even understand the powers of this Elizabeth Warren thing. They don't even understand the idea that you can freeze most of those assets that they're adding up.
00:29:49.148 - 00:29:49.334, Speaker C: Right.
00:29:49.372 - 00:30:22.418, Speaker B: They're just like, oh, we added up number, number, big post number to Wall Street Journal. Wall Street Journal. Dumb. They write it. I'm just trying to give you the very simplified view of this, but it's just kind of like, it feels like that's the entire brain process, and it doesn't even feel like it's bothering to be even slightly more strategic. You would think that if they want to do an attack that, yes, this is successful, but that they could have added a little more defense mechanism into the evidence and there was like, none. I don't know.
00:30:22.418 - 00:31:13.566, Speaker B: It strikes me as just misguided. I think the other thing that's kind of interesting that I've observed about Congress is there's like this cadre of slash law professors who are all super modern monetary theory stands, who are the ones who are pushing the anti crypto stuff with legislators and people in Congress. And I feel like those people are just mad that MMT didn't. Right. Like, I feel like, the soft landing stuff is kind of an indictment. A little bit of some of their initial thoughts of, like, we can keep printing forever. So there's this very funny cultural overlap I've observed between those who are writing these half baked crypto things and those who are of that ilk.
00:31:13.566 - 00:31:31.270, Speaker B: And all of them are a bit airheady to me. I feel like there's a little bit of bombastic retort with little bite if you start asking, like, 20 questions. And maybe that's sort of where I stand on this. That's not really a spicy take. That was just a rant.
00:31:32.250 - 00:31:35.930, Speaker C: Well, the one thing that people love about the show is that we're politics.
00:31:36.270 - 00:31:36.778, Speaker B: Yes.
00:31:36.864 - 00:31:38.598, Speaker C: That's especially american politics.
00:31:38.614 - 00:31:43.114, Speaker B: Everyone on crypto Twitter is just like an expert in a new field every few weeks. Right?
00:31:43.312 - 00:31:46.160, Speaker A: Every week there's a new topic that we're all experts in.
00:31:47.570 - 00:32:23.270, Speaker C: I've been. I've been in a lot of telegram groups that became experts on the Middle east pretty much overnight, which was very impressive because it takes a lot of knowledge to know a lot about the history there. But anyway, to not embarrass ourselves any further, I think we're going to keep this show short today because it's a bull market and we're all celebrating. We could use a win. I will just say one thing. A lot of people on crypto Twitter have been very excited about this account that's been getting a lot of attention, named Gort, g w a r t. It's been roasting a lot of people on crypto Twitter, a lot of VCs, a lot of founders.
00:32:23.350 - 00:32:26.874, Speaker B: I mean, I've been roasted by Gort for months at this point.
00:32:26.992 - 00:32:35.034, Speaker C: Well, that's funny you say that, because we did just get confirmation that actually Tarun is. We didn't get confirmation.
00:32:35.082 - 00:32:37.486, Speaker A: We got strong evidence that we got.
00:32:37.508 - 00:32:40.074, Speaker C: A very strong tell that Tarun is Gort.
00:32:40.122 - 00:32:43.150, Speaker B: I hear that the Wall Street Journal is trying to hire Haseeb.
00:32:45.890 - 00:32:56.098, Speaker C: Well, I'm known for my journalistic excellence, so that's very thoughtful of them. So anyway, you heard of your first. Tarun is gwart. Go ahead and shout that from the rooftops. No, it is true. It is true. Look at that.
00:32:56.098 - 00:32:57.240, Speaker C: Look. He's trying to.
00:32:58.810 - 00:33:12.618, Speaker B: I think if I were actually funny on the Internet, then you could maybe plausibly make a case for that. But Gort is a little bit too clever in a way that I don't even aspire to be because I feel like it would be painful to be.
00:33:12.624 - 00:33:24.358, Speaker C: That good at the humility. The humility you see it's coming off him. He's trying to throw us off the scent. But America, not America, I guess. What? Internet. Internet. You decide whether you case.
00:33:24.384 - 00:33:30.560, Speaker B: I'm excited for the Twitter army to be on your case after this episode comes out being like, no, you're wrong.
00:33:31.170 - 00:33:33.146, Speaker C: All right, present all your evidence.
00:33:33.258 - 00:33:34.942, Speaker A: Present all the evidence on Twitter.
00:33:35.006 - 00:33:40.978, Speaker C: All right. If you feel like we've gotten this one wrong, write in. We'll present the results next time.
00:33:41.064 - 00:34:12.138, Speaker B: Also, as someone who, unfortunately for this quarter, has been going to a conference every other week, I will say one thing we haven't covered a lot of, mainly because of SBF and legal stuff and boring stuff is technical content or things of that nature. So if you are listening and there's anything you want us to feature, you know how we had like an MeV episode earlier this year? Probably need another sort of roll up episode. Anything you want of that form, definitely write to us.
00:34:12.224 - 00:34:20.286, Speaker C: Yeah, we're going to need an intellectual palate cleanser. Thankfully, it's a week off from. Wait, Robert, how did you create those fireworks? What was that?
00:34:20.388 - 00:34:32.738, Speaker A: So somehow my computer, if you make hand motions, sometimes it turns into, like. I honestly can't explain it. If you're watching the episode on YouTube, you'll see this. It's actually quite embarrassing. If you're just listening in, you have no idea what just happened.
00:34:32.904 - 00:34:43.526, Speaker C: That's some real granddad stuff. I love that. That's awesome. My computer broke. Yeah, my computer just started doing it. I don't know. Let's call best buy, see if they can come look at it.
00:34:43.526 - 00:34:54.418, Speaker C: That's great. Also, can we get a dolly of somebody locking a computer? Like, just like a criminal coming in and locking computers? I feel like that's also. Yeah, we're going to need that. We're going to need that as a ransomware illustration.
00:34:54.514 - 00:35:00.734, Speaker B: Well, I just like the idea of computer security for babies. And it's like, ransomware locks on either.
00:35:00.932 - 00:35:11.294, Speaker C: That's great. I love that. That's good. We're going to have to get that for crypto cybersecurity at some point. Maybe we can get certic to do it. Rob, I feel like that'd be perfect. Anyway.
00:35:11.294 - 00:35:15.740, Speaker C: All right, we're going to go ahead and wrap. Thank you, everybody. We'll be back next week. Yeah.
