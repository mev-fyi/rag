00:00:00.170 - 00:00:30.310, Speaker A: I'm pro bitcoin. I get attacked by the bitcoiners as being into I'm actually pro bitcoin. I try to be pro bitcoin in the book, but bitcoin has one use case. It's sort of a digital store of value. Like, my goal here is to build a new wave of Internet services that replace a lot of the big Internet companies and do a lot of different things. And so I just view it as you need. We need to have more projects, doing more things, and doing it in a way that has proper funding.

00:01:15.646 - 00:01:17.102, Speaker A: Thanks for having me, Laura.
00:01:17.246 - 00:01:22.306, Speaker B: The day this podcast airs, your book, read, write, own comes out. Congratulations.
00:01:22.418 - 00:01:25.830, Speaker A: Thank you, thank you. It's been a long time in the works and I'm excited.
00:01:26.330 - 00:01:31.850, Speaker B: You've been a vc for eleven years and this is your first book. So what inspired you to write it?
00:01:31.920 - 00:02:50.082, Speaker A: Yeah, I blogged for years, like 2000 and I think eight through 13 era, and I've always liked writing and have been now in the kind of crypto space for about ten years. I find that what we're working on sort of blockchains and crypto, I believe is a very misunderstood topic. It's partly misunderstood due to faults of our own meaning the industry. There's a lot of focus in the industry on trading and speculation, and of course there are these giant catastrophes like FTX. We were not investors in FTX, but regardless, having these kinds of things happen in the industry sort of sullies the image. I believe there's another side to all of this, and this is the side that I think I work on and a lot of friends of mine work on, which is what I would describe as sort of the productive use cases for blockchains and tokens and a way in which they can, as I argue in my book, make the Internet a place that works better on behalf of users and creators and software developers and the people that use the Internet, and kind of returns the Internet to a lot of its original ideals from the 1990s. I felt like that message was not getting through.
00:02:50.082 - 00:04:16.858, Speaker A: And I had tried, like a lot of people in industry, I had gone out and written blog posts and podcasts and spoken to lots of people, and in that process, felt that it's just simply a story that needed a longer treatment and specifically needed to bring in some context from the history of the Internet, explain a little bit of the inner workings of how this technology works, and then really dive deeply into different practical applications that affect people's lives. And I found that ultimately, I concluded that the only way to really do that was in the form of a book and something. My book is 230 pages in the main text, something that was not a super long book, but enough that it really gave the full context. The other thing I would say is that, and I'm sure we'll talk about it, there's a lot of active policy discussions going on around crypto and regulation, and I have spent a lot of time in the last couple of years with lawmakers and policymakers. And in every meeting, the question is at the end, what book should I read? And there are a lot of great books, including your book. There's great books on sort of the history of Ethereum and Coinbase and bitcoin. But I didn't feel like there was sort of a 2024 kind of, what are the societal benefits of this technology? Written in a way that didn't presuppose any background in the Internet or blockchains.
00:04:16.858 - 00:04:42.566, Speaker A: Right. You could sort of take an average citizen and average. Someone told me to write a book for sort of a smart high school student when I started writing, which was advice that stuck with me. Don't assume any background knowledge. Avoid jargon. Explain things sort of from first principles. I didn't feel like there was a book that sort of explained all that and why the technology can benefit society and therefore shouldn't be just sort of banned and regulated away.
00:04:42.566 - 00:05:14.354, Speaker A: There is a positive aspect to it. And so I felt there was a need for that. The downturn happened. I started writing it after things like a lot of the kind of blow ups of, I guess, what it was, a 2021 and 22, or, I think, early 2022. And for me also, it was sort of a personal mission in that I wanted to, I think it was Richard Feynman or somebody who said, if you can't explain something to. I forget what it was a ten year old, you don't really understand it or something. Some famous science quote like this.
00:05:14.354 - 00:06:06.350, Speaker A: And I felt like, look, if I really believe that blockchains are critical for creating a better Internet, I should be able to really kind of write that out and explain it in detail in a way that doesn't presuppose anything. A lot of times in the space, people will use these words like decentralization as an example. I think the word might be in the book, but it's certainly not. I don't rely on that word. I really go into the specifics. Right. And I felt like that was part of what I challenged myself with personally, is really show this in detail, how this has positive effects on people and how you can create Internet services that are kind of more democratically controlled, where the money and the power and all the sort of important things flow to the participants of the network and not just these big centralized intermediaries.
00:06:06.350 - 00:06:39.546, Speaker A: And so for me, it was also kind of just frankly a personal challenge just to really kind of go and work out all these ideas. I thought naively it would take me like a few months, and then of course, it took me at least well over a year of a lot of work. And I had a bunch of really talented people also help me out and give me detailed feedback and other things. But in the end, I don't know. You've written books, so I think, you know. But it was in the end kind of a gratifying process and I'm excited to get it out.
00:06:39.728 - 00:07:12.422, Speaker B: Yeah. And one thing I want listeners to know is that when I read it, I thought, oh, maybe I'll send this to my mom. Because I was really struck by just how simple and accessible a lot of these descriptions were. And even for myself, especially in the earlier parts of the book, I was learning things, which goes to show that, because obviously crypto came later in the Internet and I was not this earlier. So I do definitely think it's worth checking out for.
00:07:12.556 - 00:07:39.358, Speaker A: Thank you. Thank you. That's music to my ears because that is what I want it to be. It's a successful book. And also, by the way, I'll mention it's broken into both chapters, but also three to four page kind of blog posts, like chunks. And specifically to your point, what I was kind of imagining was that if you're like you and you've done crypto, maybe the Internet history stuff would be more interesting. And then there's a lot of people that know Internet like veterans like me, Internet veterans who know the Internet history.
00:07:39.358 - 00:08:20.410, Speaker A: But maybe don't know the blockchain stuff. And then the sort of third part of the book where I go into more specific, like how to do token designs, some applications there. I'm kind of distilling, I think, the best knowledge of a bunch of smart entrepreneurs that I work with. And so I'm hoping even for entrepreneurs like cutting edge entrepreneurs, some of that, I'm not saying it'll be brand new, but I hope that the way I present it is helpful and novel. That's kind of how I was thinking about it. For some people, hopefully the whole thing will be new and interesting, like kind of for the general reader. But then even for folks like you, I'm hoping there'll be parts.
00:08:20.410 - 00:08:24.590, Speaker A: What you just said is music to my ears. Thank you. That's exactly my goal.
00:08:25.330 - 00:08:39.970, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, let's talk about that beginning part, because you start the book by outlining a number of problems with the current Internet. I don't even want to name examples because I just want you to lay out what it is that you're trying to tackle with crypto.
00:08:41.190 - 00:09:21.502, Speaker A: I fell in love with the Internet in the late ninety s and have now spent my entire 25 year career working on the Internet. And I was in an academic program at one point and actually philosophy phd program and dropped out and did the Internet. I did that because I don't see myself as someone who necessarily would have gone and even business if it hadn't been for the Internet, to me was this amazing thing. It was this idea that you'd link all the computers in the world and you would do it in a way where there was no intermediary, there was no company that controlled it. It was a community owned network. Right? This is how the early Internet worked. And this had to do, and I outlined a little bit in the book, but this had to do with the origins of it coming from academia and government.
00:09:21.502 - 00:10:27.570, Speaker A: And there were a whole bunch of good things that happened that led to the sort of open, democratically controlled system. And then that led to because, as I argue in the book, because of the incentives it created, because it was open and there were no intermediaries, it created a very strong incentive for people to create websites and other kinds of Internet services. And that's why you had this golden period from the late ninety s to the early 2000s where you had Facebook and YouTube and Amazon and Google and all these amazing Internet services that was created partly because of this. It was this open, democratic system where if you created a website, if you were Jeff Bezos or Larry Page, and you created Google or Amazon, you owned it like it was your property, and you didn't have anyone sitting in between you and your audience, right? They have a direct relationship with their audience. And then what happened in the sort of mid to late 2000s, going up to this decade, rather, the had the rise. You had a set of about roughly five companies that started to sort of consolidate more and more control. And I rattle off some of these stats in the book, but the top 1% of social networks control 99% of the traffic, 99% of the revenue.
00:10:27.570 - 00:10:56.590, Speaker A: Similar stats for search. The top five tech companies now account for 50% of the Nasdaq market capitalization, which has doubled. Their shares doubled in the last decade. And so where I think we're potentially headed is for an Internet that looks a lot more like kind of old broadcast tv, where you had ABC, CBS and NBC, and you have sort of three channels. And I think that's going to be a bad thing for the world. I think it's bad for society. I think it's bad for entrepreneurs, because it's much harder to kind of start a new company.
00:10:56.590 - 00:11:52.926, Speaker A: I think it's bad for influencers and creators, because if you're a TikTok influencer or Instagram influencer, people go to those services to see the people who are on them, the other users. They don't go to see TikTok's content, they go to see other users. And yet those other users get very poor economics, as I walk through in detail in the book. So I think a consolidated Internet around three to five companies, let's call it, is a bad thing for a whole bunch of reasons, by the way, it's a bad thing for venture capital. I mean, people ask me sometimes, is this some kind of altruistic message? I work in a business that depends on startups existing, and that depends on having a dynamic, innovative, open Internet in many ways. So we see this at the firm as long term, kind of a very important precondition for having a vibrant startup ecosystem, is having an open. And look, I think all the trends are headed that way.
00:11:52.926 - 00:12:34.222, Speaker A: Maybe you could sort of slow it down with regulation. We've seen the FTC and others get more involved in blocking acquisitions and things. I see that as mostly a sideshow. It's not changing the core dynamics of companies like Facebook and Apple and Amazon and Google getting stronger and stronger. And so to me, blockchains offer one of the only credible counterweights to that sort of consolidation and centralization movement. And specifically, blockchains allow you to create new Internet services that can be anything from social networks to games to financial services to, you name it. And I have a bunch of chapters where I go through those specifically in the book.
00:12:34.222 - 00:13:48.866, Speaker A: But you can create new Internet services that have a lot of the properties of the early Internet where people can, software developers, creators, entrepreneurs, can build direct relationship with their audiences, where no intermediary is standing in the middle controlling things, where users and developers and creators and all the participants of the network are empowered both in terms of how the network is controlled, the digital service is controlled, but also how the economics work. Right. And so I see blockchains as a new building material that allow us to create a new wave of digital services that have much better properties for the participants of the network and return us in many ways to what the intention of the, I see the intention of the Internet in the sort of the ideals of the Internet. I think blockchains can help return us to those ideals. And that's why I'm so excited about it, that's why I work on it. And I ask myself, this last downturn was brutal and all the bad things that happened, I asked myself, probably like a lot of people do, I believe in this, is it worth it? And can I prove it to myself by writing it down in a book in detail? And I came away, I think, with sort of reinvigorated and feeling like this is more important than ever. Things like artificial intelligence.
00:13:48.866 - 00:14:36.870, Speaker A: I'm very pro AI, as I hope comes through in the book. I generally believe in technology has a positive influence, but I think AI will reinforce these centralizing forces. AI rewards companies with large stores of data and capital and compute. Meta just announced that they have 350,000 h, it's 10 billion of gpus. Now, meta, to their credit, is making a lot of that open source, but you're going to see a lot of these companies, these big companies, get stronger and stronger with these AI systems. And so what is the counterbalancing force? Like? We need something as a counterweight, and I believe it's the crypto blockchain movement is the main credible counterweight. Not only is it important, but I think it's sort of an urgent thing that needs to be worked on right away.
00:14:36.870 - 00:14:55.370, Speaker A: And we need to specifically on the policy side, design policies that stop the bad stuff, of course, and put guardrails around it and avoid another FTX, but also allow for the productive use cases of blockchains, which is what I try to outline in the book.
00:14:55.520 - 00:15:13.502, Speaker B: Yeah, and I definitely want to ask you really specific questions about things like that. But before we dive into some of the more detailed issues around blockchains, I do want to ask you about your explanations or descriptions of blockchains. I was very impressed by these in the book.
00:15:13.556 - 00:15:14.514, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:15:14.712 - 00:15:27.240, Speaker B: It was just so clear, and it's something that fascinates me generally, probably because of the type of role that I have. But when you talk to a layperson, how do you explain what a blockchain is?
00:15:27.690 - 00:16:09.250, Speaker A: Yeah, I think the first thing is, I guess I say a few. The way I describe it is a little bit different than most people in the industry. So, first of all, I don't really like when people describe blockchains as ledgers. And it's not because they aren't ledgers, it's because they're more than ledgers. I think it understates the power of them. And I like to refer to them as computers. And by a computer, I'm going by the kind of original Alan Turing, his famous description in his undecidability paper, which is a state machine, which is something that sort of both can store information and then act on that information, right? And so has both kind of storage and programs that can modify that storage.
00:16:09.250 - 00:16:26.662, Speaker A: That's at its heart what your Mac is, what an iPhone is. That is what a computer is, right. It's something that store information and then manipulate that information in some way. And a blockchain, like Ethereum, is very much that. It's a computer. You can write code for it. It can store things.
00:16:26.662 - 00:17:21.254, Speaker A: It's a computer that is owned by nobody and accessible to everybody, right? It's open, it's transparent. Contrary to a lot of the kind of fud you hear about blockchains being for hiding stuff, it's exactly the opposite of that. As I'm sure you know, Laura, they're actually horrible at hiding stuff. They're incredibly public. But to me, kind of the key idea is that with any other type of computer, I can make promises to you. Like I can put up a server and I can say I'm going to create digital money on my website, on Chris's website. Or Google can put up a server and say they're going to have Google Coin or something like this, and they're going to put in some legal agreement or something else, some commitment that they'll only ever be 21 million coins, okay? In the end, because of the way those on a typical computer, in the end, they can just change their mind.
00:17:21.254 - 00:18:07.778, Speaker A: They can just say, you know what? I'm going to make them 22 million coins or I'm going to change my terms of service. Or you sign up for a social network and they have a privacy policy, they can just change their mind. Like any digital service you use today is ultimately controlled by a person and a company, and then ultimately a person, the CEO of that company or the manager of that service, and they can just change whatever they want. The old saying is a cloud is just another word for someone else's computer. And it is like, you don't control these things, you have no rights. All of the typical services you use on a daily basis, Instagram, TikTok, et cetera, in the end, whoever just runs those servers has the power. Blockchains invert that relationship between sort of who has the software and the hardware.
00:18:07.778 - 00:18:40.420, Speaker A: So typically, whoever controls the physical machine controls the software that runs on it. That's how corporate servers work. Blockchains invert that relationship. The software is in charge of the hardware. So I upload software to the Ethereum computer. Yes, there are people known as validators who run the physical code, but the way that blockchains are designed, the core design feature, right, is those validators. Outside of extreme situations where you have what's called a 51% attack, outside of those situations, those validators can't undermine the code.
00:18:40.420 - 00:19:05.626, Speaker A: Whatever code is written will continue to run as designed in perpetuity. And that means you can write code that makes commitments. You can write code that says, if this user owns this NFT, they get to fully control it in perpetuity. You can say in this, you can do bitcoin. Bitcoin commits. There will only ever be 21 million coins. It doesn't matter.
00:19:05.626 - 00:19:25.694, Speaker A: Ultimately, bitcoin runs on physical computers. In bitcoin's case, it's called miners bitcoin. The code is running on those computers, but the people running the code can't subvert the rules of the system. Outside of the extreme collusion, 51% attacks. In the normal course of events, they cannot subvert that. There are other rules. Bitcoin promises, bitcoin makes.
00:19:25.694 - 00:20:30.642, Speaker A: Bitcoin makes the promise that you can't double spend a bitcoin, right? That a single bitcoin can only be spent once. If you could double spend it, it would lose its value. And so it makes all of these commitments that are preconditions for having a digital currency. And then something like Ethereum came along, right? And it generalized this and said, anyone can write code, and that code can also make commitments. And now we have entrepreneurs and independent developers who are exploring that design space and writing interesting code that's where nfts came from. Nfts, the standard has only been formalized for four years. It was a new idea that, well, now that you can have fungible tokens, what about non fungible tokens? And that's very early in the development of nfts, of people saying, well, what can you do with this? And you can have an NFT that represents an avatar, like the kind of board ape style, or you can have one that represents a piece of art, or you can have one that represents a sword in a video game, or you can have one that represents an identifier on a social media website, or you can have one that represents a deed, a physical, offline deed, right? It's a unit of encapsulation of ownership.
00:20:30.642 - 00:20:59.706, Speaker A: But that unit of encapsulation of ownership could not exist if you didn't have a computer that could make those strong commitments, right? Because if Google said you own this thing on Google servers, they could just change their mind. And they have, by the way, many, many times I have that in the book. They've had 300 something services that they've decided to shut down. They could just have Google Coin and just one day stop serving it. They can change their terms of service. Corporate commitments just can't be relied on. They simply can't.
00:20:59.706 - 00:21:38.730, Speaker A: They ultimately have a fiduciary duty. So I think of this blockchains as having this very powerful new feature through inverting the power relationship between software and hardware, putting the software in charge, then in turn enabling the ability to make these commitments about the future. And those commitments can span a range of areas. They can be financial commitments like kind of as described in bitcoin. They can be commitments to software developers. So this is a thing that if you're not a software developer, you don't know. But there was a long period where social networks like Facebook and Twitter promised open API access to developers.
00:21:38.730 - 00:22:15.410, Speaker A: This was like late two thousand s and startups were built on them. And there was a whole wave of innovation of people kind of building on top of these things and then they just all kind of whimsically, capriciously decided to remove or deprecate their APIs, killing off a whole cohort of startups. Blockchains. Because you can make commitments, one of the commitments blockchains can make is to developers, they can say, hey, we're going to have open API access. And by the way, we can't change it. We're committed. Therefore you can build on solid ground, right? You're not building on quicksand you're building your business on solid ground.
00:22:15.410 - 00:23:07.334, Speaker A: Think about how important property rights are in the real world. The reason that I'm in New York right now, that a small business will feel good about building their restaurant or kind of developing their restaurant on the street, is the commitments around them. They know the sidewalk is open, they know the road is open, they have a legal agreement with their landlord, or maybe they own it. And all of those commitments say, you know what, now I feel good investing. There's lots and lots of data from economists that show that countries where there's weaker property rights, there's less investment. That's because people don't have confidence that they can make long term commitments. Right? So this is a precondition for a lot of different kinds of entrepreneurship and development, is giving people sort of really strong property rights, and that's one way to think about what blockchains do.
00:23:07.532 - 00:23:48.710, Speaker B: So, interesting. I did not expect you to go in that direction, but yeah, I might try that. So one thing that I did want to ask you about in the book, because obviously all these systems have coins. You use an analogy around faucets and sinks to describe tokenomics, but I'm sure you're well aware, and this even came up in your earlier description of some of the criticisms of the web two space. But there are a lot of people in crypto who are critical of what they call vc coins. One of the memes around this actually uses an image of a faucet where the vcs get most of the flow. There's just drops left for retail.
00:23:48.710 - 00:24:04.890, Speaker B: So with these critics calling out a 16s involvement in funding new projects and receiving some percentage of the tokens, how do you address those criticisms, especially when they say what you and the founders are doing is dumping on retail?
00:24:06.110 - 00:24:44.534, Speaker A: None of these criticisms I've seen are actually based on any facts. So they're all just these sort of vague insinuations. The actual facts of the situation is if you look at all of the projects that were involved, first of all, the first thing people will say is that we own too much and control these projects. It's just simply like, certainly I think the norm in the industry now is like a vc lead will own something like 3% of the tokens. And if you just go, look, a lot of this stuff is public information. Certainly almost every project we're involved with, we own sub 5%. Second of all, I think even the smart critics will say that a 16 z holds these things for a very long time.
00:24:44.534 - 00:25:11.098, Speaker A: So the stat that we have is that of the token holdings. Since life to date, in the crypto funds, we have sold 6% of our token holdings. Just to give you a sense of the fact that how long term we are. Look, there's a well known kind of thing in venture capital of what's called the J curve. The J curve is sort of, you start off a fund, and then it sort of drops in value, and then it goes up. And if you're successful, it takes a very long time. Our funds are structured.
00:25:11.098 - 00:25:38.550, Speaker A: We don't have hedge funds in our crypto funds, we have venture funds. Venture funds mean that essentially, it's a different sort of economics, where it's a much more long term holding. And our base period for our venture funds is ten years. And that base, meaning lps, just expect they won't get money back for ten years. And by the way, many of our funds are extended longer than that. So it's just not empirically true. I've never seen anyone make that claim with any data, and it doesn't match the data.
00:25:38.550 - 00:25:52.266, Speaker A: And so I don't know. I think this is just something people say to, and maybe there are vcs out there who do that, and I don't know, because of some of this stuff, I don't have access to all the data for other people, but with respect to us, it's just simply not true.
00:25:52.448 - 00:25:56.590, Speaker B: And for the 6% that you have sold, what were those circumstances?
00:25:56.930 - 00:26:22.246, Speaker A: Well, generally, the way I think about it is, at some point, we do need to return money to our lps. At some point, they want money back. And so we're now, I think, six or seven years into our crypto funds. And so at some point, and generally, the way we look at it is at some point, at different times, we'll do kind of strips of just like selling a little bit of liquidity across different things.
00:26:22.428 - 00:26:30.150, Speaker B: And you mentioned 3%. Is that what you think the ideal percentage is for a vc to receive?
00:26:30.490 - 00:27:25.606, Speaker A: Okay, just to give you quick history of venture capital, in the old days, put aside crypto, just old style. Like when I raised money for my first company in 2004, I think the norm in the vc industry, this is not crypto, obviously, 2004, I think vcs would often own 25% of a company, and then fast forward again, not crypto. That number probably has just steadily declined to well below 15, if not 10%. This is in traditional venture capital. And that just has to do with dynamics of, like, entrepreneurs sort of, there's more capital out there, the entrepreneurs have more negotiating leverage in crypto. I think the numbers were already cut in half for a bunch of reasons. Look, part of the reason is that in any wells designed blockchain project, they're going to give at least 50% of the tokens to the community through various incentive programs, airdrops.
00:27:25.606 - 00:28:21.206, Speaker A: And so already the numbers are lower, and then there's a lot of competition, there's a lot of investors out there, and so that gives the entrepreneurs leverage. And so that number, I'm basing this on anecdotes and not data, what I'm saying right now, but I'm pretty sure that number has cut in half the average ownership of a lead vc in a token project, and I'm pretty sure it's around. I mean, I know today, like, 3% is like a pretty decent number for a vc to get, and it's been sort of steadily going down. So I just don't think that criticism is based on data. I'd love to see people's data when they make that claim, because it's not consistent with what I've been seeing, by the way, the other thing is, with these systems like Uniswap, I think Uniswap is one of our higher. That was an investment we made in, I think it was 2018 or 19. We led the series A of Uniswap.
00:28:21.206 - 00:29:00.130, Speaker A: I think that's one of our higher ownership of like 6% or something. I don't actually know the number. I think it might something around there. But in all those cases, also, we have a delegate program where we commit to delegating half of our votes to our college students and other delegates that we have. So that's just another way to kind of decentralize, control and things. But look, I think the important thing I talk about this in the book is, let's compare this to the alternative. Which is the alternative is you have these big companies who control most of the Internet, where it's controlled by one person or maybe a ten person board, and it's all opaque and it's all behind the scenes.
00:29:00.130 - 00:29:15.354, Speaker A: So the idea that now having a community control with a few institutions owning 3% is somehow worse is just, to me, it's just losing perspective on the topic. Right. Which is a dramatic improvement in terms of making these systems more democratic and more community owned.
00:29:15.482 - 00:29:27.750, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think on the other side, they would say that there isn't just one other alternative. They would say, oh, bitcoin, or any of the quote unquote fair launch coins like bitcoin.
00:29:27.930 - 00:29:58.118, Speaker A: I'm pro bitcoin. I get attacked by the bitcoiners as being anti. I'm actually pro bitcoin. I try to be pro bitcoin in the book, but bitcoin has one use case. It's sort of a digital store of value. My goal here is to build a new wave of Internet services that replace a lot of the big Internet companies and do a lot of different things. And so I just view it as we need to have more projects, doing more things, and doing it in a way that has proper funding.
00:29:58.118 - 00:30:27.058, Speaker A: And sometimes that proper funding, like a useful way to raise that money, is to have vcs involved. It's just the reality. It'd be nice if you could build the next YouTube and Twitter and everything else in a totally bootstrap way. I've seen no evidence it's ever happened. It's literally never happened in 30 years of the Internet. I actually walk through all these examples of people trying to do it, and at some point, if it's not working over and over and over, maybe you should try something else. And venture capital, people like to criticize it and it's an easy punching bag.
00:30:27.058 - 00:31:15.758, Speaker A: But the reality is venture capital is the model that has created the vast majority of successful Internet services. At some point, I guess the question I would have is, do you want to start winning? Is bitcoin winning against PayPal and Square cash and all these other services as a payment network? Is lightning winning? I think bitcoin is doing well as a digital gold store value. I think on the payment side it's still very early. We have some investments there, likespark David Marcus, and I hope it does well. But ultimately I view myself and our firm as pragmatist. We want these things to be successful and there's sometimes in these things, there's a balance between having these ideals around fair launch and everything else, and winning.
00:31:15.854 - 00:32:10.370, Speaker B: So in a moment we're going to talk more about tokenomics and token distribution. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible. Defi just got way easier with Vaultcraft, a blockchain infrastructure for building, deploying and monetizing non custodial yield strategies in a few clicks. Forget spending months of R D capital and human resources when you can now instantly launch your crypto fund with Vaultcraft on any EVM chain, from wallets and institutional service providers to non defi dgens, Vaultcraft supercharges your crypto assets by enabling instant cross chain yield strategies that you can deploy in 1 minute. Now anyone can supercharge their crypto portfolios with custom tailored defi strategies. Join Vaultcraft's referral program, unite with the community, and supercharge your crypto details on Vaultcraft. IO back to my conversation with Chris.
00:32:10.370 - 00:32:36.878, Speaker B: And so just in that vein of talking about how to distribute the tokens, I noticed that when you describe blockchain networks, you did mention that one of the downsides of them could be plutocracy, in which big token holders have too much power. How do you think about designing governance and these systems so that crypto networks don't end up with that?
00:32:36.964 - 00:33:42.142, Speaker A: Yeah, so I have a chapter on network governance, and it's interesting, I rewrote that chapter many times because I started off wanting to sort of give an answer to network governance, but then decided that, you know what? I just don't actually have an answer. What I do believe is that blockchains now allow network governance to be moved into the rich design space of software. You can now use software to design new governance systems. That's what a blockchain allows. And I think that is a notable improvement over just giving all the power to a CEO of Facebook or Twitter or, you know, in the case of things like web and email, where you have this, I think those are great, but you just haven't had any other kind of community owned systems that have succeeded in the last 30 years. So to me, the idea that you can now design governance systems for networks is an important breakthrough. The specific designs that are the best, I try to walk through some examples of what I think are some interesting ones, but the truth is, I think it's still evolving.
00:33:42.142 - 00:34:40.870, Speaker A: But to give you an example, I think originally we had sort of two broad schools of thought on blockchain network governance, right? One was the off chain governance of something like Ethereum, where it's done much more in the sort of old style open source governance, where essentially the software developers quote unquote, vote by deciding what to upgrade to make. Right? So if you propose a fork or a change, and this is how bitcoin works, the software developers kind of are effectively voting by deciding which side of the fork to take. The other form of governance that we've seen initially is the fully on chain governance, and this is things like compound and uniswap. And then within on chain governance, we've had kind of strong on chain governance, which is like compound, which would be let you propose full code change, any arbitrary code change, you can propose it and people vote on it on chain through token votes. And then you have things like uniswap, which is much more constrained. You can't change the code, but you can vote on the funding. So it's also this question of what you can vote on.
00:34:40.870 - 00:35:07.374, Speaker A: And then you have, I think, really interesting experiments, like optimism, where you have a sort of bicameral system. So you have a kind of Senate and house, if you will. And so the Senate kind of keeps check on the House. So the House is sort of the token votes, but you make sure they aren't doing things that are, for example, plutocratic and self interested. So you have this sort of override safety valve. I think that's a really promising experiment as an example that's going reasonably well. But I think these are complex problems.
00:35:07.374 - 00:36:11.374, Speaker A: We have a guy, Andy hall, as a professor at Stanford, who's a governance political science expert who works on our team, and he's excited about this area because it's like this whole new kind of way to study governance. And look, the, and what he would say is, the reality is we haven't figured out governance in the offline world. Like, how's that going? It's just complex. It's people, it's messy. But the claim I would support, and I do argue in the book, is that it's a lot better than just having these kind of little dictatorships, which is what we have today with these social networks and other digital services, where just like, the person who runs it wakes up one day and decides to demote a certain type of post or a certain type of user, and they have full power. I don't think that's a good way to control these systems, which have become Twitter, Facebook, these PayPal, all of these digital services we use are now, they control global economics, politics, culture. These are very important systems.
00:36:11.374 - 00:36:34.380, Speaker A: And I think we kind of backed into this system where they're controlled by a few people who may or may not have society's broader interests in mind. And I don't think that's the right way to control digital services. I don't think the blockchain space has figured out all the answers, but I do think it's a very interesting new set of tools to address these questions.
00:36:35.710 - 00:36:53.680, Speaker B: This isn't necessarily about distribution specifically, but there's another issue that crypto projects have seen, which is that sometimes speculators have gotten in early, driven the price up in a bubble, which then causes a crash. It kind of kills the project. So what do you think is the best way to prevent that kind of.
00:36:55.090 - 00:37:29.434, Speaker A: Look, I'm, I talk about a little bit in the book. I think time horizons are a very important thing. As I was just talking about with venture capital, I, along with all of Silicon Valley, is in the know tech business, right? So there's no illusions about that. But generally, I think Silicon Valley works pretty well because it's profit driven, but it's long term profit driven. Right. If you join a startup, you usually have to go through a five to ten year process and build something of value before you make money off of it. Right.
00:37:29.434 - 00:37:50.018, Speaker A: And the same with venture capital. I think people would be surprised at how long the average holding period in venture capital firms across the industry is. It's really long. I think it's longer than this, probably, based on the data I've seen. But it's seven to eight years before a typical fund even breaks even, let alone makes profit. Right. Seven to eight years.
00:37:50.018 - 00:38:16.026, Speaker A: And that's sort of just typical around the industry. And I think it's, look, if you're doing it, I've known people that work at startups, it's like, gosh, I'd like to go and have buy a house and do all this stuff, and people have to wait, but it ends up aligning incentives very well between the company and the broader societal interests. Right. Because you can't hype something up for eight years. Like, you have to actually go build something useful. Right. I think that kind of stuff.
00:38:16.026 - 00:39:26.270, Speaker A: Look, and if you look at some of the draft proposals that came out of the house financial services committee, like, important ideas in there are enforced lockups, and I think I'm very supportive of those ideas. I think one of the main things that could be done to tamp down speculation would be longer time horizons enforced through policy. For example, maybe users earn tokens through airdrops, but they can't sell them for some period of time or until some milestones are hit or some other kind of thing to severely dampen the kind of speculative side of things. But I also think there's an interesting. Sorry if one thing I could add is I think there's also a lot of projects exploring what I would call kind of financial dampening, which is you've heard about points as an example, which are non transferable tokens. There's a bunch of people. I think in some ways one of the lessons is that from the speculative side of crypto, I call it the casino in the book, from the kind of casino side, which I think has hurt the space and given it a bad image and also hurt a lot of consumers.
00:39:26.270 - 00:39:54.780, Speaker A: I think essentially that one of the key lessons is that in some ways, tokens are too powerful, like the financial aspects just overwhelm everything else. You try to create a game and you want people to play the game, but everyone just ends up getting obsessed with the tokens. So one of the things points do is it sort of says, look, these are not as power like you're dampening it, right? You're sort of saying, hey, these are just transferable points. Maybe someday they'll be non transferable or something else, but you're sort of putting the focus back on the utility and not just on the financial aspects, because it's just the financial aspect just kind of overwhelms everything.
00:39:55.470 - 00:40:05.034, Speaker B: So while we're on the subject of points, is there anything else about them that you want to add in terms of how you find them useful or when you think they should be used versus when they should not?
00:40:05.152 - 00:40:52.042, Speaker A: Yeah, well, this is one of these things where I think people are using the word whenever you have new tech words, people use it in different ways and maybe not always in the same way. So I'm not even sure when people say points what they're referring to, because people can mean different things. I think that the idea of non transferability of tokens is interesting, especially just because there's a lot of legal uncertainty right now around these things. And so by making points tokens non transferable, it just makes it impossible for people to trade and to lose money and to have all those kinds of issues. And so I think that's one reason people are exploring it. And I think it's good to see people sort of running experiments and things. But it's still very early.
00:40:52.042 - 00:40:57.790, Speaker A: I mean, even the word points is like, I think a month old or something. So we don't really know where all of it's headed.
00:40:58.770 - 00:41:30.306, Speaker B: So to go back to your comments about the casino, bitcoin etfs were finally approved and launched in the US. And as we're all very well aware, that only happened because the SEC was forced to do it. And it probably should have happened sooner, or would have if bitcoin and crypto hadn't become politicized. I've even heard Gary Gensler actually talk about crypto and use the word casino to describe. I wondered what your thoughts were on why it is that crypto has become politicized. I don't know if you've seen that in previous eras of tech that you've worked on.
00:41:30.428 - 00:42:03.986, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a great question. I think there's different ways to look at it. One is just maybe the world is different now and everything is politicized. I mean, you saw this during COVID When Covid started, I naively thought, okay, this will finally be an issue that brings a country together. And the fact that whether to wear a mask or not became a political issue I think just probably says something about the current climate we live in. I think the fact that whether you have the crypto has. I think that's one way to look at it.
00:42:03.986 - 00:42:29.670, Speaker A: We kind of live in an era where for whatever reason, everything seems to become politicized. And that's happened with crypto. I think part of it is the origins. The fact that crypto started with bitcoin and started with kind of like a lot of them were libertarian and kind of coded right. And that made people like Elizabeth Warren on the left and others sort of see it as the enemy. I think that blockchain is a software construction. It's politically neutral.
00:42:29.670 - 00:42:58.870, Speaker A: And a lot of the use cases, I think could be described as left. Some of them. A lot of them could be described as right in the same way that social media could be used in either direction. So I think that it's very much politically neutral and it would be great to kind of. If we could lessen the politicization of it. I don't know if that's possible, but it certainly has happened. That's politicized and I think that's driving a lot of the policy now, unfortunately.
00:42:58.870 - 00:43:47.554, Speaker A: But we're also seeing, I think a lot of moderate Democrats are much more open minded about it. I think it was six Democrats voted for the McHenry bill as an example. I think we'll see more of like. And I hope that as people kind of hopefully we can get the right messages out and help people understand the possibilities of the technology and sort of broaden, make the movement more inclusive, bring more people into it. That potentially I hope that over time we can change that perception. Open source software is an interesting analog. Where it began as actually a left wing political movement from the sort of a socialist movement, anti copyright, and for a long time the sort of ignored as this fringe kind of left wing thing.
00:43:47.554 - 00:44:09.194, Speaker A: And then it kind of morphed into a much more pragmatic movement with things like Linux. And so my hope is that that same thing can happen with blockchains, is that yes, it had these kind of political origins, but over time people sort of view it more pragmatically as just another tool, another way to build that. But that obviously is not where we are today. And that would take time.
00:44:09.392 - 00:44:33.460, Speaker B: And I also wanted to ask about the description that you had of how proprietary networks like Twitter and Facebook ended up beating out some of these other more open protocols like RSS. And one of the reasons that you gave for it was because Twitter and Facebook could raise venture funding and a 16 z itself invested in Facebook. So I was curious for how either you or the firm view that investment now.
00:44:33.990 - 00:45:34.710, Speaker A: Well, I'll speak for myself, which is I felt like I went through a journey where I was obviously a little bit part of web one but then really part of web two and sort of the entrepreneur and then became an investor working on that. I became disillusioned with how that was going about when I got into 2013 or so, when I got into this space, into crypto. And that was around, as I document the book, when sort of RSS and these other open social networking systems were failing or losing ground to these centralized systems like Facebook. And look, and that was after late two thousand s, it looked like, well, Facebook will be a new platform and Twitter will be a new platform, but they'll uphold all the principles of the early Internet. By 2013, that was clear that wasn't happening, right. And this was going to be a very different world, at least for myself. That's when I started to become disillusioned with this system and started to look for alternatives.
00:45:34.710 - 00:46:05.598, Speaker A: And for me, that was sort of the striking thing about blockchains. And so I think people say that sometimes like, oh, it's hypocritical. You were part of the web. Two mark entrieson's involved in Facebook is still on the board of Facebook. To me, it's consistent to have believed in something and supported it, and then to, as you see it, going off the rails to support things that might fix it. Right. And that's how I view my own journey.
00:46:05.598 - 00:47:05.154, Speaker A: And as I mentioned earlier, I just don't think venture capital is going to have a bright future if we don't have a dynamic Internet that's accessible and open to startups. Another very important issue that we're very involved with that's not crypto is open source software in general, open source AI, which I think is the next policy threat. Right? I mean, we already saw with the executive order from the Biden administration what looks like essentially effectively a ban on open source software, know, having to quote register frontier models and all these other kinds of things that just simply couldn't happen with open source software. And so I just think there's a bunch of forces that are effectively going to sort of make the playing field, make it impossible to have a level playing field for startups. No one I know who was involved in the web two era up until 2013, had any idea this is where things would end up. So I think it's just been a big surprise. And some people seem happy with it.
00:47:05.154 - 00:47:49.874, Speaker A: Other people, like me and others at my firm, are not happy with how things ended up and want to try to improve it. But I think it surprised a lot of people for sure, because, look, I mean, even the most optimistic, if you told the most optimistic tech person in 2007 that we'd have a social network that's worth whatever meta is worth now, $700 billion, they would have thought you were insane. If you told them that the five biggest companies, including meta, were 50% of Nasdaq's market capitalization, they would have thought you were insane. Like, nobody predicted this level of consolidation that I know of. And so it just ended up very different than people thought it would. At least people I knew thought it would. And then that forces you to reckon with that, and you either decide it's good or not good.
00:47:49.874 - 00:47:56.578, Speaker A: I decided it's not good, and I want to work on systems that try to move things the other way.
00:47:56.744 - 00:48:13.900, Speaker B: Yeah. And I find it interesting also, because I realized your investment in Coinbase was in 2013. It was the timing lines up there. So, speaking of Facebook. Facebook tried to move in the direction of crypto with its Libra project. Eventually it had to abandon that. And 816 Z was one of the members.
00:48:13.900 - 00:48:16.970, Speaker B: What were your takeaways from that whole debacle?
00:48:19.710 - 00:48:46.510, Speaker A: We were on the. Whatever it was. The consortium? Yeah, something like that. Like, we weren't insider, so I don't know the whole thing. But my impression was it was just all heavy pressure from policymakers and regulators to shut it down. There has been. And look, with all these companies that have other lines of business, it's one thing for a crypto company to get pressured from the government, but if you're Facebook and you've got these $150,000,000,000 of revenue streams from all these different businesses, and they're under various.
00:48:46.510 - 00:49:17.934, Speaker A: I'm sure they're under thousands of various pressures and regulatory pressure. I think in the end, that was just the. Also, if you remember that, I forgot who it was. A senator sent a public letter to stripe, and I think it was PayPal and a bunch of other members of the consortium telling them if they don't drop out, they're essentially going, like, threaten the rest of their business. Right. And so you can't expect a stripe or PayPal to risk their core business for what they view as an experiment. Right.
00:49:18.132 - 00:49:26.830, Speaker B: But what's your takeaway in terms of how you think about how to launch other things you're working on or how to advise?
00:49:26.910 - 00:49:55.834, Speaker A: Well, I think we need to figure out the policy side. I think we need to have rules that are set and fair and protect consumers, but also allow for responsible innovation, which we don't have today. And that was one of the challenges Facebook had. It just simply know we just didn't have, like, there wasn't enough space there for them to like. I think part of it, too, was the public messaging. I mean, if you look at a lot of the political discussion around it, it was like Facebook's trying to create their own money system. Right.
00:49:55.834 - 00:50:18.850, Speaker A: Of course they weren't. They were trying to create a payment system. It's very different than creating. They weren't trying to compete with the US dollar. And so a lot of the messaging got complicated. So my takeaway, look, I think part of my takeaway is we just need to have smart policy around all of these new tech issues, crypto, AI, everything else, if we're going to have the kind of innovation we want. So a lot of it was just policy related.
00:50:18.850 - 00:50:40.986, Speaker A: I don't like, I think they tried very hard. They did a good job. Look, a lot of the tech itself was all done in open on GitHub, and the team spun out and did Aptos and Sui. And so the code lives on. And I think to Facebook's credit, same with what they're doing with AI and llama. They were very open source oriented. So that's nice.
00:50:40.986 - 00:50:47.660, Speaker A: So, like, all that investment in very interesting technology lives on through the open source code.
00:50:48.350 - 00:50:59.614, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, when you said they weren't trying to build a competitor to the US dollar, I think even if they weren't trying, it probably would have on some level. So that's probably what policymakers were calling out.
00:50:59.652 - 00:51:13.630, Speaker A: Yeah. And it was right around, I think Facebook was getting a lot of heat at the time, just generally. Right. And so for the social media stuff. So I don't have, I don't know, I'm not privy to the internal workings of Facebook, but it may have just been too much, too much political drama.
00:51:13.790 - 00:51:29.290, Speaker B: Yeah. So speaking of drama, Crypto had a terrible 2022, as you mentioned earlier. Terra Luna, three AC, Celsius, FTX, et cetera. What are the lessons that you learned from that year? Or what are the lessons you think the crypto community should have learned from that year?
00:51:29.440 - 00:52:07.746, Speaker A: Yeah. If you remember that whole kind of cycle, as I recall, maybe I'm forgetting the days. But I think it began in summer 2020 with the launch of the so called DFI summer. And then that was sort of, I think, when compound and uniswap launched, or at least started to grow. And then we had top shot, like nfts toward the end of the year. And I felt like for that first year, I was really encouraged because it felt like there was a lot of product innovation and people were focused kind of more on the products. And it was like, top shot was, hey, this is cool thing.
00:52:07.746 - 00:52:49.730, Speaker A: You can collect these basketball cards. And then at some point, I don't remember the exact dates, but it was like, probably in 2021. It felt like, to me, it turned and it became, as you were describing earlier, less about the products and just all about the kind of know and the kind of heroes on Twitter, crypto, Twitter, instead of them being product innovators, they were like three arrows and like. So it not only became more about money, but the personalities became money personalities. And I felt like that. And then, of course, fast forward. And there were these disasters, and I think I forget the order, but it was like three arrows and Terra and of course, FTX.
00:52:49.730 - 00:53:37.694, Speaker A: And so, for mean, I think the lessons are many fold, but one of them is we need regulation and we need clear regulation. So I'll just say I was on the board of Coinbase for years, and it was with great frustration at Coinbase that Coinbase has been, for example, had KYC since the beginning, contrary to some of the insinuations, otherwise, they've always been very compliant and spent a lot of money on regulation. Meanwhile, they had competitors who were offshore, including FTX, including Binance, who ignored a lot of those things. And it was always very frustrating at Coinbase because they felt like they were doing all these things and complying and yet losing significant market share. Right. I think at its peak, binance, I mean, I don't know. You probably know better.
00:53:37.694 - 00:54:28.514, Speaker A: I think Coinbase got down to, like 5% market share, and all the market share was getting taken by FTX and finance. I can't tell you how many times I heard from people in the venture community, oh, wow, FTX has got a new. They're so much better than Coinbase. You guys have the losing company. And so it was very, like, why is that? Because it takes seven years to build a case against binance. Because we don't have black and white rules around crypto, and therefore everything is going to court, like with the Coinbase case, and it's going to take five years to settle. And so we have this extremely slow moving system where there's going to be many, many long court battles when if you had just, like, a law passed and you had very clear rules, it would be black and white, and if somebody is outside of the lines, you can go enforce it immediately and you could shut this stuff down.
00:54:28.514 - 00:55:13.770, Speaker A: So I think a lot of this was a policy thing, like having clear rules and then enforced rules that you don't have to go to court for five years over to enforce would help everybody. Okay? So I think that was part of the problem. I think part of the problem came from the crypto world. I don't want to take the responsibility off the crypto world, which is just this focus on kind of trading and speculation and crypto, Twitter. I think the design of these systems, as I was sort of mentioning earlier, there's just too much focus on money and tokens and not enough on utility and other kinds of things. So it was a series of failures, and it was a failure, and it was disappointing outcome. I don't think that means that we should throw the baby out with the bathwater and give up on blockchains and tokens.
00:55:13.770 - 00:55:39.782, Speaker A: I think that, as I've mentioned before, very important technology, the technology itself is not. Technology often arrives with various historical events and cultures and other kinds of things, but we need to separate that from the technology itself. And that's what I try to do in my book. I try to look at the technology objectively. Here's what's good about it. Here's what's bad about it. And if we had a proactive, smart policy, we try to maximize the good and minimize the bad.
00:55:39.782 - 00:56:13.874, Speaker A: You can use a hammer to build a house or to destroy a house. You can use nitrogen as fertilizer for explosives. Like, all technology has a good side and a bad side. And the job of investors like me, of entrepreneurs, of policymakers, of society at large, is to think about systems for maximizing the good and minimizing the bad. Right? And I think that was the major lesson coming out of that, is, like, we need to go collectively. I hope and figure that out. And by writing a book, what I'm hoping to do is take the debate out of kind of the Twitter dunking and ad hominem and all the things that go on of people name calling.
00:56:13.874 - 00:56:54.830, Speaker A: And I'm trying to say, here's my view. I put it out in 230 pages in detail. If someone's going to critique it, my plan is, if anyone does a good faith critique, like long form critique, I will respond to it in good faith. I want to elevate the debate to a smart discussion and not just like people name calling. And I think all of these tech policy things should be sort of new tech AI too. How do we balance AI, which is clearly an amazing technology, and we should embrace with the livelihoods of creative people that it might replace. We need to have these discussions right, and we need to move these discussions out of this realm of name calling and dunking.
00:56:54.830 - 00:57:02.546, Speaker A: These need to be like serious long form discussions in my view, and I'm trying to contribute my part to it with the book.
00:57:02.728 - 00:57:09.314, Speaker B: Yeah, speaking of the dunking it, one of the examples that I thought of was the have fun staying poor from Doe Kwan.
00:57:09.362 - 00:57:42.910, Speaker A: I think that's a terrible message. Is that what you're talking? I think that's one of the things that the crypto people do that makes them disliked, is that they say things like have fun staying poor and a bunch of other things, which is just not inclusive. I don't know, it's just not like we should be thinking about how do we use this technology to improve people's lives and improve the Internet and be inclusive. It's by definition that's exclusive speech. If you want to grow the movement, you need to be inclusive.
00:57:43.810 - 00:57:55.426, Speaker B: Yeah, it comes from ego. So it looks like we're on the verge of another bull run, at least in my opinion. If you agree with that, what do you think this bull market will be about?
00:57:55.608 - 00:58:18.618, Speaker A: Yeah, so I don't know. Try not to. As I mentioned earlier, we're in the venture business, so we're long term. So we don't try to time markets or anything like that. But I think the good news is right now, infrastructure wise, we've made a lot of progress. It's always, for me, always slower than I'd like because I'm impatient about it. But the ethereum l two stuff is real and I think we're getting very close.
00:58:18.618 - 00:59:01.510, Speaker A: I kind of measure it against when will we have kind of feature parity with web two systems where you can just go on, click a few buttons, not pay high gas fees or ideally any gas fees, and do something right and just have it be a really clean user experience. And I think we're very close to that. And in fact, some people have that today we have, I'll just give an example, like an investment in a company called Blackbird that's doing kind of restaurant related NFT stuff created by the founder of Eater.com and Resi, like an experienced restaurant person. And it's a web two kind of like. It's like a very clean experience. I think we're seeing more and more of that.
00:59:01.510 - 00:59:33.902, Speaker A: I think we're seeing more a whole bunch of. So I think on the infrastructure layer, things have gotten much, much better. There's also, of course, as I mentioned, alternative l ones like Aptos and Sui and Avalanche and near and a bunch of others. And I think the l two stuff has gone well. And then on the application side, there's just a lot of really talented entrepreneurs. We've got a bunch of people making games and social networks. It's early, but I think, for example, Farcaster Dan Romero is a good example where I think it's a really interesting design of a decentralized social network on a blockchain.
00:59:33.902 - 01:00:21.006, Speaker A: And it's very early in terms of users, but he's got a nice early community going, and the technology is evolving well. And there's probably in our portfolio 20 to 30 applications like that, whether they be games or idea. I'm really excited about is this kind of collaborative storytelling, which is, I talk about in the book, which is an idea that you can get a community of people together and they can create narrative universes like Harry Potter and Star wars and get rewarded financially for their contributions. There's just a whole series of interesting kind of applications getting built. Ever mind? Like, I was there for the early iPhone application wave, and what happened is you had like a 13 year period of people trying to create smartphones. The iPhone came out 2007. Smartphone innovation in Silicon Valley probably began 15 years before the iPhone.
01:00:21.006 - 01:00:57.710, Speaker A: Like General Magic. There were a bunch of people trying to create smartphones in the iPhone came out. It was finally like, nailed the infrastructure, nailed the phone, and then there was like a year of flashlight apps. And then about a year later, you started to see entrepreneurs entering. And I was actually an active investor at that point. And if you look at the data, it was between 2009 and eleven, almost all the top apps were started, meaning Uber, Snap, Instagram, they were all that kind of, that range. And so at some point, you hit this kind of, like, sweet spot in any kind of computing evolution.
01:00:57.710 - 01:01:22.194, Speaker A: And I don't think we're there yet. We have not had our iPhone moment. I don't believe in crypto, but I do think that a lot of signs point to it being in the near future, I hope AI, by the way, I love this sort of new revisionist history that it was this overnight success. The first neural network paper was 1943. Okay. It was 80 years to chat GBT. There was a many, many summers and winters of AI.
01:01:22.194 - 01:02:00.340, Speaker A: In fact, if you go read about it, there was a whole AI investment, quote, bubble in the thought that was the right time. I sold it to eBay in 2011. Retrospect, I was, whatever, over a decade too early. What ended up making AI happen? A lot of really smart people, algorithms, et cetera. But fundamentally it was gpus got better and better, and gpus got better because of video games. So I think that's AI is a great lesson both in how long these things can take, but also in how circuitous the routes can be. Sometimes video games led to AGI might be the headline 100 years from now or something.
01:02:00.340 - 01:02:41.694, Speaker A: So my point just being like, that's how these things evolve. I don't think we've had our kind of chat, GPT or iPhone moment yet. And I also have found in my own career, it's easier to predict the direction of things and it's much harder to predict the timing. So I hesitate to give you timing predictions because I'll probably be wrong. But I do think that a lot of signs point to us being relatively, I'm hoping, relatively close to some kind of really breakthrough and more useful applications. And I think when that happens, that will really dramatically change the perception of the space because people will start to be able to directly experience. It's one thing to talk about these ideas, as I do in the book, but it's another thing to experience them.
01:02:41.694 - 01:02:58.670, Speaker A: And I think that will be a really important moment when we finally have applications that hundreds of millions of people are using on a daily basis, and then they can understand that this is much more than just about kind of casino speculation. And there are really productive use cases.
01:02:58.830 - 01:03:15.900, Speaker B: Yeah, and I actually do want to ask you about a few different applications. But first, I have just a few quick questions about infrastructure related things. I'm sure you've heard this common debate in crypto now about modular versus monolithic blockchains. Obviously, this is Ethereum versus Solana. I mean, I wondered what your take was on that.
01:03:17.870 - 01:03:59.778, Speaker A: That. By the way, that's an old debate in computing. So this goes back to Unix versus Microsoft, right? So Unix would be a modular system, and Microsoft was a monolithic system. Our view has been, we're excited about Solana, and I think there's a lot of interesting positive signs there. And I think the technology is very interesting. I guess I view it as different applications require different architectures and different sort of use cases. So, like, if you're building, for example, one of the benefits of a monolithic architecture is you have all the different applications built on that on Salana can fully interact with each other and be fully composable and be like Lego bricks.
01:03:59.778 - 01:05:07.200, Speaker A: Whereas if you have a whole bunch of different l two s on ethereum, maybe you have to need bridges and it's clumsier to get across. But at the same time, if you're building a video game and it's a more siloed experience and doesn't have to interact with other video games, and you just want it to be incredibly fast and cheap, you might want to build a l two, like an op stack fork. On ethereum, for example, if you're somebody else and you're building an NFT project that interacts with other applications, or financial service that interacts with other financial services, the monolithic architecture might be preferable. So I view it as like there's a trade off space and it depends on this is, by the way, the same is true in infrastructure software, not outside of crypto, is that you end up having different architectures work for different applications. Right. So I see as the same thing here. I think it's great that we have so many strong technologists who are building kind of the best monolithic and the best modular architecture, and that those exist and are available for application developers to build on top.
01:05:07.200 - 01:05:23.982, Speaker A: And I think there can be multiple successful architectures. Ultimately it's going to be driven by applications. I mean, the real thing now is we need those applications to get built out and grow. So that in turn helps develop these blockchains.
01:05:24.126 - 01:05:29.894, Speaker B: And if you were to pick which applications you thought would work better on which system, what would you say?
01:05:30.012 - 01:06:12.420, Speaker A: I think there's different trade offs. Modular is better for atomic composability, like for just having things, services that interact with each other and call functions. And I'm getting a little bit technical, but like call functions, sort of synchronous function calls. I think a lot of financial services apps want that kind of stuff. As an example, I think probably games work better in modular. I know I'm involved with a few games and their model is free to play, and they want to have 100 million people, many of whom aren't paying for it. They have to have incredibly low gas fees and incredibly low latency, and so they just want to roll their own chains and do it that way.
01:06:12.420 - 01:06:27.302, Speaker A: So I think games might be one where you're going more modular as an example. So I don't know, I think we'll just have to see it play out. But I think it's good that application developers have a lot of choices and.
01:06:27.356 - 01:06:33.980, Speaker B: Restaking on ethereum is going to be rolled out this year with Eigen layer. What do you think of Eigen layer and what impact do you think it'll have on?
01:06:35.630 - 01:07:33.834, Speaker A: Like, I think there's just so most, there are many of these, but I think it's a very interesting intellectual, intellectually is a very interesting idea, and it's very important because it unlocks a bunch of new design possibilities, because you can do, like, I just give you an example. One idea people have been talking about is how do you build kind of distributed AI systems on top of blockchains? And one of the challenges with building a distributed AI system is you want to have a way to verify. Like, if I go and say I send a job out to a bunch of computers to do some AI task, and they send me results, like, how do I know they didn't send me back garbage? How do I validate what they did? And that was actually correct. Right. And today, to do something like that, you'd have to build your own l one from scratch. You'd have to go build your own l one. And that kind of think of what Filecoin did or something like this.
01:07:33.834 - 01:08:32.414, Speaker A: They had built their own l one, and then they have to go recruit a network of validators, and those validators are going to then go. And it's like starting from scratch, right? So what's really interesting about restaking is that you don't have to start from scratch. You can write some code that says, here's my code for doing AI algorithmic validation, but I'm going to piggyback off of this existing infrastructure of the Ethereum validator community, which is this rich, diverse, decentralized community. So it's a really interesting way to allow for many more sophisticated blockchain designs that don't have to start from scratch, because starting from scratch with a new community is just a very hard kind of marketing problem. I don't know, I think just, it's another testament to when you have open permissionless systems anyone can build on, you just get all these kind of cool new ideas. I think until Eigen layer, at least to my knowledge, no one had thought of that. It's just like a brand new idea.
01:08:32.414 - 01:08:49.010, Speaker A: Maybe there's some precursor to it that I don't know of. It just shows you kind of when you have these open permissionless systems that you get all sorts of unexpected kind of new breakthroughs. Right. Which is just sort of a broader testament to why we're believers in open innovation.
01:08:49.170 - 01:09:13.078, Speaker B: Yeah, honestly, it makes me think that we might see even more of a flourishing of an ecosystem on Ethereum. So in terms of applications, a lot of people see social fi as an area. Right, for blockchain based apps to take off. What do you think of social fi apps? Or. Sorry, what do you think a social fi app would have to do differently to compete with existing social media platforms?
01:09:13.174 - 01:09:18.960, Speaker A: You say social fi, are you referring to, like, friendtech, or are you referring to. Because I see it as like there's sort of. Is that what you mean, or do you mean.
01:09:19.410 - 01:09:25.066, Speaker B: Well, yeah, it could be just any sort of decentralized social network?
01:09:25.178 - 01:10:15.482, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, to me there's different types. There's ones that are kind of more finance oriented, like front tech, and then there's ones that are less financial, that are more sort of like traditional social networks, like Farcaster. Yeah, I guess I'd say a couple of things. I think one very powerful force in technology is the power of software developers. I think that this is a point I try to build, sort of show in my book. But open source software, I think would surprise a lot of people is something on the order of high 90% of software in production in the world is open source software, which is software created by Ragtag communities on the Internet, which is kind of shocking that Linux is by far the dominant operating system in the world and there's no company behind it.
01:10:15.482 - 01:11:06.946, Speaker A: People that are outside of technology are sometimes surprised to learn that. And so the power of developers kind of coming together and building stuff is a very powerful thing. Bill Joy, the co founder of Sun Microsystems, had a famous saying that no matter how many smart people work for you, most of the smart people don't work for you. Or I'm butchering the statement, but most of the smart people work for somebody else, meaning it's always more powerful to get a developer movement to help you build something than it is to try to just get employees to help you build something. Right. And we've seen this again and again through the history of technology. So I think one of the powerful things with blockchain based social networks, social fis, are calling it, is this idea that you can build kind of a core protocol and an incentive system for developers to come and build on it, and they can build out new clients and analytic tools and distribution tools and build a rich ecosystem around it.
01:11:06.946 - 01:12:08.310, Speaker A: For those who are around doing Internet entrepreneurship in the 2007 to nine range, they'll remember there was this huge developer ecosystem on Twitter. There was a vc firm started to literally invest in Twitter startups like that's how big of an ecosystem it was that I think that if we can get that force going of like you build these open kind of public goods, these open protocols, and then we get lots of developers building on them in the way they do with open source software. You could mean why does open source software win in the end? It's not out of like because people like, oh, I want to pick open source software to be a better person. It's because it's better software. Because when you get Linux is a better operating system than windows, it's more secure, it's more modular, it is more reliable. There's a whole bunch of reasons it's better and it's better because it's open and the developers are better and it's a movement. And I think the same forces that have driven open source software, that drove the open Internet that we've seen throughout the history of computing can also drive a new wave of social networks that are open and permissionless and community owned.
01:12:08.310 - 01:12:18.840, Speaker A: I don't know, that's a very important force that I'm excited about. And projects like Farcaster are trying to lean into that and experiment with that.
01:12:19.210 - 01:12:22.950, Speaker B: Because all the users are elsewhere already. So how do they attract?
01:12:23.110 - 01:12:45.278, Speaker A: Yeah, well, I think that in terms of go to market you're saying. Yeah, I think that's an interesting question. I think that a couple of things. One is most social networks are kind of two sided markets. Now I'm putting on my web two hat, by the way, I'm not my web three hat. So I'm giving you sort of best practice advice from the web two stuff. One is that most social networks are two sided markets.
01:12:45.278 - 01:13:31.886, Speaker A: So you think about YouTube, you have the creators, you have the viewers, and Twitter, you have sort of the power influencers and you have the more passive readers. And so a lot of building a new social network is about getting those kind of influential creator people either to switch or the new ones who pop up as they always are as the world evolves to join that network. Right. Often that happens in weird niches, right? Like you think about twitch and know maybe it's some technical think, you know, Farcaster is hoping to get like a lot of the crypto community as example. They already have a lot of the Ethereum community and kind of grow out from there. And then as crypto grows, maybe grow with it and then maybe leapfrog into other adjacent areas of technology. I'm not speaking for Farcaster here.
01:13:31.886 - 01:14:00.358, Speaker A: I'm just speculating on how one might do that. I think you have to look at this in the long hawk of Internet history. Maybe it sounds hyperbolic to say it, but, I mean, we're 30 years into the Internet, and it seems like the Internet should be as important as one of the great inventions of all time. I think. I don't think it's hyperbolic to say that. I think there's lots of room for in the long arc of history for new systems to develop. And when YouTube started, it was funny.
01:14:00.358 - 01:14:46.326, Speaker A: I remember this 2005, they had competitors. The main competitors were these companies like Brightcove, which actually, funny enough, was like, jeremy Alair, who's now circle. And I'm not criticizing Bright cove, I was a fan of theirs, but there was sort of these competitors who were taking, like, CBS and NFL content and putting on the Internet. And YouTube said, you know what? We're just going to make a website where anyone can upload content. And so they were basically making a bet that there would be a new wave of people that come on the Internet that aren't popular today, that become popular through social video. And of course, they ended up being, you know, you have YouTube influencers who know more followers than the NFL and CBI or whatever. I mean, it's just massively popular that didn't exist at the time.
01:14:46.326 - 01:15:07.770, Speaker A: So I think that's the other thing to think about with these new technology movements is that a lot of times, the audience and the creators and all the users will be, many of them will be just people who are only now coming onto the Internet or only now becoming influential on the Internet. Right. I mean, you're trying to build these things for the long term and for future people and future ways of growth.
01:15:07.930 - 01:15:29.590, Speaker B: All right, so I know we're running along, but I have just two last questions. There's been a battle waged in the crypto community over creator royalties in the last couple of years, and creators have kind of largely lost that battle, with royalties not being supported when they were originally touted as a way for them yet to solve a problem. So I was wondering what your thought was on how those should be handled.
01:15:30.330 - 01:16:08.526, Speaker A: Yeah, I think creator royalties are very important, and I think that there are various. They were an important part of why NFTs appeal to creators. And so I think of it as sort of non negotiable. We need to figure out the right way to bring them back. There are technical nuances. So, for example, if you enforce everything on chain, it makes it hard for a user to move between one of their own wallets to another. We have a research team, now led by Tim Roughgarden.
01:16:08.526 - 01:16:32.874, Speaker A: He's a professor at Columbia. And actually one of our team has, a number of members of our team have been working on this problem and plan to publish. Everything they do is open source, and they'll just publish it. It'll just going to be sort of a public good. So we're working on a bunch of stuff there. So to me, it's kind of annoying that this became an issue. It feels like a own goal by the crypto community scoring on itself here.
01:16:32.874 - 01:17:25.910, Speaker A: That I don't know. I don't know why. It's unfortunate to me that people decided to build systems that fork around creator royalties, but I think that there are ways to bring them back, and I think they will be brought back, and I think they're essential. I think that people that are trying to work around them are being short sighted because it's long term. The only way to really grow the NFT movement is going to be to ensure that creators are paid royalties. By the way, it may not be the optimal system is per trade, it may be other systems. There's other proposals, like where you do it with other kind of systems that maybe encourage different behaviors, but there needs to be a recurring revenue stream to creators, because that's really, to me, one of the fundamental new promises of web three is that unlike web two, creators will get paid properly.
01:17:25.910 - 01:17:27.610, Speaker A: I see that as non negotiable.
01:17:28.030 - 01:17:31.642, Speaker B: Wow. Okay, so you agree with me because I agreed it was short term thinking.
01:17:31.696 - 01:17:33.360, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's very short term thinking.
01:17:34.050 - 01:17:51.858, Speaker B: So, last question. I know you're a fan of Carlotta Perez's book, Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital, and in it, she describes that when technologies become entrenched, that their downsides become apparent. So I wonder if crypto succeeds in the way you are betting it will, what downsides do you think will become apparent over time?
01:17:52.024 - 01:18:43.634, Speaker A: Well, I think, and I tried to be open minded about this in my book. In the book, I deliberately bring in what I think of as the smartest objections. So as an example, in the take rate section, I bring in, like, moxie. Marlon Spike had this critique of systems like Opensea and just generally blockchain based systems and saying, essentially, there was a risk of what he called decentralization, I think, which is essentially, you start off decentralized and it's all these great things, but then over time, people will end up aggregating around these centralized hubs. And so I tried to kind of steal man in the book the best objections, including his, and I think I'd like to think, I hope I did characterize his argument in a fair way. And I say in the book, instead of saying he's wrong, I said that's a really good objection, but I think that there are design lessons that we can take away from it. Right.
01:18:43.634 - 01:19:08.234, Speaker A: And if you design these systems correctly, you can eliminate or mitigate those risks. So I don't think it's a fatal objection, but I think it's a very forward looking one that leads us to design lessons. And I think I did this throughout the book where it's sort of, here are the like with governance. I don't say this is a panacea. This is raw. This is some beautiful utopia. I just think this is an important new tool that we can now explore this.
01:19:08.234 - 01:19:42.614, Speaker A: And here are some of the interesting directions we can go. And here are some of the risks, by the way, with tokens and financial centers. I have a lot of sections of the book talking about the risks of it, saying that we don't want, I have a whole section on regulation. I'm arguing for smart regulation, just to be clear. So I try to take kind of a balanced view on it. And I do think, look, I think a lot of this stuff can be, if you think it through ahead of time and you design the systems in a smart way with those risks in mind, you can do a lot to mitigate them. And we now have, look, we have a lot more history of the Internet now than we ever did.
01:19:42.614 - 01:20:24.420, Speaker A: Like when we started the web, two thing, it was ten years of history. We have 30 years of history. We've seen a lot of experiments, and I think we can learn a lot from that. So I think really the question is, do we want to? To me, we have enough history. We have enough ideas, we have enough tools. The really big question is, are we going to get together, we, the world, the community, the policymakers, and actually have a constructive conversation about how do we enable responsible innovation and how do we design better systems, or are we going to just sort of have a food fight and throw stuff at each other? And I'm hoping that we could do the former. And that's what I'm trying to do a small part of with my book.
01:20:25.750 - 01:20:32.054, Speaker B: All right, well, this has been an amazing conversation. Thanks so much. Where can people learn more about you and the book?
