But also sometimes if you don't have, let's say, the best product in the market, users are free to leave and go elsewhere. We saw that in defi summer a couple of years ago when these new projects were coming out, just incentivizing users with their token on a streaming basis or investing basis, and now it's rotated to points or a combination of both. And so I think this trend will continue as long as there are still new projects and forks popping up in the industry as they have really no other way to attract users unless they have a superior product. So the real winner in this space will have a, a good product and be a good user retention program, whether that be through token incentives and or points that can be utilized in some shape or fashion on the platform itself.
