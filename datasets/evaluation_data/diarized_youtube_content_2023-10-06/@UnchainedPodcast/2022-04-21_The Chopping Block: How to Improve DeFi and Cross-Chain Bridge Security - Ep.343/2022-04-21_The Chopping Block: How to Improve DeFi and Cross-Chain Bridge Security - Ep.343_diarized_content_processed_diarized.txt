00:00:02.490 - 00:00:22.000, Speaker A: Hey, everybody, welcome to the chopping block. Every four weeks, the few of us get together and give the industry insiders perspectives on the crypto topics of the day. So quick intros. First off, we have tom DeFi, maven and master of memes. Next we have tarun, the gigabrain and grandpuba at gauntlet. Then we have laura. She is the CEO of the show.
00:00:22.000 - 00:00:24.158, Speaker A: How? She asked me to intro her.
00:00:24.244 - 00:00:27.446, Speaker B: Oh, please, you just called me that and you said I'm looking for I.
00:00:27.468 - 00:00:32.038, Speaker A: Asked you how you wanted to be intro and you said the CEO of the show. So I said, fine, okay.
00:00:32.124 - 00:00:36.662, Speaker B: Actually just called me that. And before you said you were looking for a way to intro me, and I said, just call me that then.
00:00:36.716 - 00:00:56.814, Speaker A: Fair enough. Fair enough. Okay. So she is the CEO of the show, and she is chief journalist on the chopping block. And then myself haseeb head hype man at dragonfly. So all four of us, or, sorry, three of us are early stage investors in crypto. But I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice, life advice, or legal advice for that matter.
00:00:56.814 - 00:01:16.482, Speaker A: So this is our first show that we're doing in person. It's honestly kind of weird because every show in the past that we've done up till now has been over zoom, and now all of a sudden we're sitting here in this hot studio in manhattan, and it's suddenly breaking the fourth wall a little bit compared to how we usually do things.
00:01:16.536 - 00:01:23.654, Speaker B: And it's also weird because it's like so close. We're still kind of in COVID, but everybody's super sick of COVID Yeah, they.
00:01:23.692 - 00:01:48.682, Speaker A: Just lifted the mask mandates. Now you don't have to wear a mask in uber. You have to wear a mask in a plane. Nobody in the subway is wearing masks, so it's very different environment. I just came from Singapore, which is the exact opposite, where people are still extremely technically, the mask mandate in Singapore is lifted, but almost everyone there is still wearing masks, even outside, which is bizarre because it's extremely hot in Singapore. It's like super humid.
00:01:48.746 - 00:01:49.982, Speaker B: Probably not going to catch COVID outside.
00:01:50.036 - 00:01:59.314, Speaker A: I'm just going to tell you just I think it's a cultural thing. If you go in singapore and you're walking around outside, the only people you see not wearing masks are the white.
00:01:59.352 - 00:02:03.070, Speaker C: People, all of the locals, not crypto libertarian.
00:02:03.230 - 00:02:25.990, Speaker A: There aren't that many. There aren't that many. Well, most of the crypto people in Singapore are asian, and so they bring the asian energy of like, okay, follow the rules at least within your normal day to day life in your alter ego, you break all the rules and then you run an unlicensed exchange or whatever. So, yeah, it's interesting. How has been the book tour?
00:02:26.150 - 00:02:54.686, Speaker B: Oh, my god. Amazing. Yeah, I've been putting out these shows every week, twice a week, and doing it for years, and I don't get a lot of feedback. And so doing these book events has been just so lovely. People come up to me and they're like, oh, I work in crypto because of you. Or someone came up and was like, I'm your number one fan. And later his friend also saw me and his friend was like, he puts you up there with Vitalik.
00:02:54.686 - 00:02:56.258, Speaker B: And I was like, oh my wow.
00:02:56.344 - 00:02:57.026, Speaker A: Wow.
00:02:57.208 - 00:03:16.026, Speaker B: I had a group of four college friends. They all listen to me. I've had whole families. The whole family listens to me. There was like a person, he was like, oh, I got my wife into your show and now she works with blockchain technology. She added it to what she was doing with government. And there have been so many stories like that.
00:03:16.026 - 00:03:35.682, Speaker B: I mean, there was somebody, she read my book so closely that she would ask me these very detailed questions about a book and I was like, whoa, you studied this thing? So the whole thing, honestly, it's just been amazing. I sold out the first event to New York, which they were turning people away. I didn't expect that. I have a ton of fans in Utah. Big surprise for me.
00:03:35.736 - 00:03:38.978, Speaker A: Wow. Feel like a crypto rock star now.
00:03:39.144 - 00:03:51.830, Speaker B: Yeah, there's been so many just delightful things. Everybody who came, thank you. Because it's just been like, yeah, so lovely, pretty much. And yeah, really, really unexpected.
00:03:52.730 - 00:03:55.026, Speaker D: How do you feel about the reviews? How do you feel about the reception.
00:03:55.058 - 00:03:56.070, Speaker C: Overall on the book?
00:03:56.140 - 00:04:22.854, Speaker B: Really good. Yeah, I feel good. Yeah, I've worked on this for years and honestly, I'm just grateful that people are even reading it. You know what I mean? There's a lot of content out there now. A lot of things compete for people's attention. And the fact that people I'm taking the time to read my 400 page book, all of its Footnotes. By the way, if you're a crypto OG, you can totally geek out in the footnotes.
00:04:22.854 - 00:05:00.860, Speaker B: They're very fun. Lots of blockchain transactions and wayback machine and things and social media posts, whatever. But yeah, the fact that they're doing that and sometimes they're screenshotting things that they're just interested or surprised by, I don't know. A lot of people have been buying bulk orders as well for their whole company or their whole Dow. Yes. I've been doing a bunch of kind of events for companies where if you buy a certain number, then I'll do a virtual event for you, or even something in person. There's been a lot of that.
00:05:00.860 - 00:05:37.526, Speaker B: There was one last week where actually what happened was it was just a conference. I gave a speech and then one of the companies had bought the book to give away and so there was like this signing line and the signing line was huge. And I had to stay for 2 hours signing all these books I couldn't even finish because I had this other appointment. I did not imagine it was going to take that long. And people wanted selfies with me. And it was interesting because most of the events, everybody already knows me and it's already like a fan of my show or whatever. But here, a lot of people didn't know me already, but just from the one talk I gave, they loved that talk.
00:05:37.526 - 00:06:01.070, Speaker B: So they were already fans from that. They were like, we loved your speech. Anyway, I could go on on and and on, but the whole thing has just been like a dream and just so lovely. I'm basically savoring every moment of it because I'm going to have to get back to work because I have a lot of other projects coming. And so it's just like, I'm going to enjoy this time because pretty soon I'm going to be hitting the ground running again.
00:06:01.220 - 00:06:45.326, Speaker A: Because I know you and you're a grinder, right? You're a workhorse. You've been putting out content consistently for years, and I know you've been grinding on this book for a long time. And so I know that feeling of like, you're just working, you're putting out stuff, you're being consistent, and then eventually you come up for error and you realize like, oh wow, all this stuff. Like someone was actually consuming it all that time and they really like me now. It's often hard for that to land, especially in the era of post COVID and living in crypto, which is all online all the time. And there's so many elements of it that feel impersonal until you finally make contact. You show up at an event and people are like, you changed my life, and now I went into the industry because of you.
00:06:45.326 - 00:06:46.554, Speaker A: And it's like, holy crap.
00:06:46.682 - 00:07:06.226, Speaker B: Yeah, I've had so many people say that to me over the years. It's really surprising. I remember when it started happening back in I guess it was 2017, and just being like, oh, weird. But now it's like having so much I'm like, oh, it's kind of crazy. I'm just putting stuff out there and it gets people interested and then they want to work in it and it's cool.
00:07:06.408 - 00:07:25.802, Speaker A: It's super cool. Yeah, well, we are super proud of you. And seeing all of the incredible reception that your book has gotten has been just awesome to see. And I'm glad that you're savoring it because I know it's hard sometimes to actually really feel the success that you've had and so it's awesome to go in person and feel that.
00:07:25.936 - 00:07:47.490, Speaker B: Yeah. No, I know. I definitely did not expect even a fraction of what it's been, frankly. So, yeah, I'm very grateful for all of it. And honestly, I think the other thing I'm really glad about know, we were a little bit nervous about the Dow attacker reveal. So the fact that went so well and nobody know. Forbes was not the first place I pitched it.
00:07:47.490 - 00:08:56.322, Speaker B: I pitched it to multiple outlets and some of the other outlets were like, oh, what if this is like when Newsweek tried to reveal who Satoshi Nagamoto was? And I was know, because it's like a weird thing when you pitch it. I couldn't reveal who it was because then if they wanted to, they could steal that and then front run me, essentially, because there's a long lead time between when I had the information, when the Book was going to come out, and so some places just backed off and they were like, what if you're wrong? And it was like because I couldn't reveal all the evidence, but I just knew there's a difference between the kind of evidence I have and what's previously been done around Satoshi. But anyway, so, you know, my Forbes editors, they know me and whatever, and we have a very good working relationship, and frankly, we just love working together. So it all worked out super well, but it was definitely kind of like a dicey thing. And so the fact that that reveal went well and people are accepting kind of I've literally not seen a single person been like, you were wrong. Let's just put it this way. Journalists, when they're revealing that kind of thing in the crypto community, they don't generally get that reception.
00:08:56.322 - 00:08:59.270, Speaker B: So I'm very glad that it worked out well.
00:08:59.340 - 00:09:11.586, Speaker D: It's like the convex bug disclosure from last week. And really the solution there is to have them add you as an editor to these publications and then you can reveal it yourself. I think that's the solution.
00:09:11.718 - 00:09:18.458, Speaker C: Or we have zero knowledge proof. Yeah, that would be great stuff. That's really more the ten year version.
00:09:18.474 - 00:09:19.978, Speaker A: Of ten years reveal.
00:09:20.074 - 00:09:21.326, Speaker B: I agree, certainly.
00:09:21.508 - 00:10:24.286, Speaker A: Well, so speaking of big reveals, actually one of the interesting stories of the week that kind of goes into I guess it'll be the next chapter of the addendum to the next version of the book. So last week or two weeks ago, last episode, we talked a lot about the Axio Infinity hack, and we talked a lot of shit about I talked a lot of shit I don't want to put it on you guys about the Irresponsibility of the Sky Mavis team for their OpSec and allowing this hack to take place. So in the last week, we've learned something about who the attacker was, and we learned it actually in a very indirect way. So what happened was the OFAC list, which is a list of basically sanctioned entities, or in the case of crypto, addresses that you're not allowed to send money to, otherwise you're in violation of sanctions. They added to this list for a group called the Lazarus Group, which is associated with North Korea. So it's a hacking group that basically is, I guess, a part of the North Korean government or associated with the North Korean state. And they're very notorious.
00:10:24.286 - 00:11:03.822, Speaker A: They've engaged in a lot of different attacks. And one of the addresses that was added to the sanctions for the Lazarus group was the one that was also used in the Axe Infinity hack, which implies that it was North Korea that attacked Axe Infinity, which is kind of wild, because if you look at the previous instances, I mean, we're looking at the ten T or what is ten X? The ten x guy. Most of the previous hacks that we've seen in crypto have been crypto insiders. Or like, in my mind, I always imagine that it's like some Eastern European teenager living in their basement just like, just reads random transactions on Ether scan all day. But it turns out that, okay, North Korea is getting in the game because of the amount of money.
00:11:03.876 - 00:11:28.550, Speaker B: I don't know if you know, like, pretty much all those South Korean exchange hacks, they were all like Lazarus, right? Yeah, because I actually did an episode, I forget what year that was. Was it 2018 or something? But I had two North Korean experts that talked about why North Korea is interested in crypto and stuff. So it's actually been going on for a while, but before it was, like I said, centralized exchanges in scary.
00:11:29.070 - 00:11:47.882, Speaker C: Do you remember that around the time the Virgil Griffith thing first happened, there were these rumors that the big LPs on Uniswap were like Lazarus group. This was like a very popular conspiracy theory as to who was minting most of the early dai.
00:11:48.026 - 00:11:51.530, Speaker B: Wow, was that ever confirmed?
00:11:51.690 - 00:12:15.320, Speaker C: No, there were some addresses that happened to be depositing into some of the South Korean exchanges around the time of the hacks, but that was very circumstantial. It was a little bit too much of a just so story. But what I meant by that is saying North Koreans aren't crypto insiders might be the wrong I feel like they actually have been around.
00:12:15.850 - 00:12:53.182, Speaker A: They've definitely been around. They've definitely been around. But I think to me it's a good reminder. So one, it means that at least for me, it makes me more inclined to back off a little bit from how much I was blaming Sky Mavis. Although, I mean, clearly they messed up in a pretty significant way, but it's pretty hard to defend against nation state level attackers. And obviously the Lazarus group is really good at what they do and it just kind of means that everything in crypto now is under the same level of bombardment and attack as the most valuable kind of state level targets as well. And so it's scary.
00:12:53.182 - 00:13:06.680, Speaker A: It's a good thing to keep in mind that the standard of security that you need to have in order to withstand all the pressure that DeFi protocols and on chain applications have today is orders of magnitude. What it was just two or three years.
00:13:08.730 - 00:13:23.142, Speaker B: Not to I'm not passing judgment on the Sky Mavis team, but I don't know if I'd back up on your judgment, frankly. I guess because the way that the security setup was, it wasn't truly decentralized.
00:13:23.286 - 00:13:55.634, Speaker A: It wasn't. But Robert made the point in our last episode that look, these were probably not all these were probably all different servers that the attacker was able to move laterally through within their network and then they were also able to find another bug and sort of daisy chain this attack with this other thing that had the super. Like it was actually a pretty complicated attack and I would assume that Robert was probably right that not all these addresses or sorry, not all these private keys existed on a single machine and so they probably infiltrated the entire network.
00:13:55.682 - 00:13:57.670, Speaker C: Well, a lot of it was phishing, right?
00:13:57.820 - 00:14:01.402, Speaker A: Well, they got in initially through phishing, but we don't really know exactly what.
00:14:01.456 - 00:14:14.746, Speaker C: By the way, I think probably everyone who is in crypto has received one of those. I probably get like five a week of these. Like, hey Chris at a 16 z.com shared Google Doc with you, but then.
00:14:14.768 - 00:14:20.906, Speaker A: You about stable coins. Yeah, we get that like twice a month. It's just like phishing attack related to stablecoins.
00:14:20.938 - 00:14:22.622, Speaker B: Yeah, I get them too.
00:14:22.676 - 00:14:30.046, Speaker D: The solution is just archive all your email every day, just get out, clear out the inbox and if someone wants, they'll message you on Telegram. And that's the solution.
00:14:30.158 - 00:14:38.866, Speaker C: Yeah, the Telegram spam has been increasing too. I'm wondering if there's going to start being more like spear phishing type things in Telegram. So be careful.
00:14:38.978 - 00:15:25.682, Speaker B: Yeah, but I just wanted to say I actually feel that this particular hack was similar more to a centralized exchange because of the setup. It wasn't like a normal DeFi hack, it wasn't like an economic hack. It wasn't one that kind of exploited a vulnerability in the smart contract. It was really more like a centralized setup that they were able to exploit similar to the way that they had done with the South Korean exchanges. I don't know if that necessarily means that North Korean hackers can hack DeFi contracts the way that you were kind of implying earlier. I just feel like it's what I was saying before. It's similar to a centralized exchange, but also the security setup for a centralized exchanges, that's pretty standard.
00:15:25.682 - 00:15:48.774, Speaker B: I don't know it's about standard, but it's been around for a long time because centralized exchange hacks have happened for years. Right. So I feel like it's easier to do security for that kind of setup than it is for a DeFi smart contract. And that's why I feel like the Sky Mavis team kind of is they screwed up because this is something that probably most people would know how to prevent, whereas a DeFi thing I think is harder to prevent.
00:15:48.822 - 00:16:13.794, Speaker C: One thing though is they're kind of in this worst of both world scenario because decentralized exchange at least benefits a little bit from security via like everyone can't see the code for their actual internal processes and multi SIG and manage key management. Whereas the Sky Mavis thing was almost like overly transparent in the sense that you could see it because yes and no.
00:16:13.832 - 00:16:38.710, Speaker A: I mean the fact that four of the nine keys were held by them was actually not that's true. You had known that you would have been like what the what? But they obscured that. Right? Nobody knew until the actual compromise. Like when you had to explain how did you guys get popped? And the answer was that well, we actually had four keys and it's like what? It's kind of the inverse of it's like insecurity which you obscured.
00:16:38.790 - 00:16:49.578, Speaker D: Yeah, but I think to Laura's point, these are more sort of social engineering style attacks which I think they probably have more experience with rather than exploiting super obscure bugs know solidity.
00:16:49.754 - 00:17:37.246, Speaker A: Yes, clearly it was not like a super know there's some corner case of solidity or like know VM hack or something but at the same it's it's also pretty hard to defend against these at scale. Eventually bridges are like exchanges because you have to have a hot wallet, you have to continually be finding things and moving money around and so it is actually really hard to secure that. But look, I mean I don't back off entirely from saying that Skymaker screwed up. Like obviously having four of the nine keys controlled by a single party is absolutely ridiculous. But yeah, I don't know that anybody is able to fully resist. I mean we just saw a recent hack of what was it? Okta that recently got hacked. Oh yeah story which is like an authentication company that you could basically think.
00:17:37.268 - 00:17:46.254, Speaker C: Of them as like multi sigs for normies. That's what octa's business is. It's like effectively normies. I mean they just like do that.
00:17:46.452 - 00:17:48.482, Speaker B: That seems like that would be a big business.
00:17:48.616 - 00:17:51.042, Speaker C: It is. I mean they are the business. They're a huge company.
00:17:51.096 - 00:17:52.162, Speaker A: $30 billion company.
00:17:52.216 - 00:18:15.050, Speaker C: Yeah, they're big okay. But in a world where crypto actually succeeds, basically multisig should basically replace Okta. Okta as a company might be gone or they'll just be a front end to a bunch of like I'm trying to give you paint you the idealistic future. I'm not saying it's likely. Oh good.
00:18:15.120 - 00:18:30.430, Speaker B: No but actually it's interesting that you mentioned that because when I was in Miami, somebody actually told me about their idea about this and it was actually really interesting but then I don't know, then I kind of was poking some holes at it. But anyway, the point is I think a lot of people are noodling on sure, for sure.
00:18:30.500 - 00:18:57.558, Speaker C: I mean Nosys obviously has the advantage but I think especially on Solana, there's a lot of teams that are trying to effectively do treasury multisig type of stuff that will be kind of are out and out soon. So I think people want to really do it. It's hard for me to imagine like Fortune 500 buying this whereas like Okta literally has every Fortune 500 company using them that's like, sort of the difference.
00:18:57.644 - 00:19:01.100, Speaker A: As a frame of reference. They're a coinbase sized company, okay?
00:19:02.190 - 00:19:05.578, Speaker C: And every big company uses them. So they are a single point of.
00:19:05.584 - 00:19:09.626, Speaker B: Failure, though, because of that when I used to work at CBS I'm sure.
00:19:09.648 - 00:19:13.214, Speaker A: You have I'm sure you have. A lot of places in the Internet use optin you don't even know.
00:19:13.332 - 00:19:13.950, Speaker B: Okay?
00:19:14.100 - 00:19:55.450, Speaker C: Do you mind if we detour for a tiny second about the one other technical hack identified this week, which was actually quite scary, which is, like, for a certain particular zero knowledge proof implementation, almost all the implementations had this sort of one crucial piece implemented incorrectly. And there was this 20 minutes period where I was trying to look through the Manero code to see if the Manero code did it the same way, because obviously, Live network a lot of money, versus most of the other ones are, like, layer twos or antenna. Not totally live, but effectively a very high level description of what this attack.
00:19:55.520 - 00:19:57.420, Speaker B: Is, is what can you name the project?
00:19:57.870 - 00:20:47.306, Speaker C: So Trail of Bits basically showed that Plank, which is this zero knowledge proof algorithm. The paper for it actually had a bug in what they wrote in the algorithm, in the math. But then everyone implementing it was just like, basically implementing the paper directly. So they basically copied it line by line, and it turned out the piece that they used, they copied incorrectly from the bulletproof implementation, which is in partially in Monero and other places. So Plonk is implementing a bunch of places like Aztec, I think, maybe loop ring, not Starkware, because Starquare is completely different. And then a bunch of the Snark implementations on different layer ones. What the one Tezos is using? Yeah, the one the polygon ones.
00:20:47.306 - 00:21:00.094, Speaker C: So just to give a high level understanding of what this bug is, it's not super complicated when you describe it in terms of sort of high level.
00:21:00.132 - 00:21:03.550, Speaker A: Description of a zero knowledge proof, you're on the spot. Now go.
00:21:03.620 - 00:21:35.686, Speaker C: Highest level description of a zero knowledge proof. I own some object, and you want to know if I have it. So what you do is you ask me a series of yes or no questions. You say, hey, is it golden? And I say yes or no. You say, hey, is it spherical? And I say, yes or no, and then you say, hey, is it bigger than this room? You say yes or no. And so after a sequence of those questions, you can be convinced I have it without actually knowing enough about the object. That's like the very I think that's five year old understandable explanation.
00:21:35.686 - 00:21:36.534, Speaker C: Was there a knowledge proof?
00:21:36.582 - 00:21:37.082, Speaker A: Sure.
00:21:37.216 - 00:22:14.226, Speaker C: And the problem with that is it's very interactive. So you have to communicate a lot. Like, I have to keep asking you these questions. I have to wait until you get a response. And so there's this thing called a Fiat shamir heuristic, which is basically instead of me giving you this back and forth, which is hard to manipulate but very slow, I actually give you a sequence of questions all at once, but they're randomized, and you have to prove that you answer them in a random order. And so I give you some random number, and then you give me back the answer in the correct random order. And that's like as if that'd be kind of the same as if I asked you those questions randomly.
00:22:14.226 - 00:22:32.030, Speaker C: The problem is, if you don't see the randomness to that correctly, it becomes like this deterministic list, and you get the same exact ordering every time. And that was basically at a very high level what the bug is. So then people then can memorize the answer and then always answer the same question back, effectively.
00:22:35.250 - 00:22:40.542, Speaker A: Nine out of ten, suddenly I understand zero knowledge proofs. It all clicked for me right there.
00:22:40.676 - 00:22:47.934, Speaker C: But the idea with that is you only have to send all the questions at once. I sent you the test. I'm not doing it interactively.
00:22:47.982 - 00:23:35.434, Speaker A: Yeah. So I think the takeaway from this was that actually, as you mentioned, it was a mistake in these papers that were all kind of copying each other, and nobody actually understood the particular mistake in the Fiat shamir part of the paper. And so they were kind of like, okay, well, you proved this part, you proved this part, you added this thing onto the end of it, but somewhere up the chain, somebody should have understood. They're like, hey, you have to be very careful in how you use the Fiat shamir heuristic and that sort of got lost in translation. And then the engineers who are actually implementing the stuff, they're not cryptographers for the most part. They're like security engineers or cryptographic engineers, but they're not themselves the people who are deriving this stuff in the first place. And so it's a good reminder that although we talk about this a lot with respect to layer two, is how layer two eventually is going to replace everything because it's so secure.
00:23:35.434 - 00:23:58.966, Speaker A: It's got the same trust model as layer one. That's only true if the engineering is, like, completely sound. And everything we know about engineering tells us that there is no engineering that is completely sound. There will always be bugs. There will always be mistakes. And you see it even in the history of, like, Zcash, which has had a history of these kinds of cryptographic errors that were not even the original paper. Actually, the paper was found, but somebody messed up somewhere down the road.
00:23:58.966 - 00:24:15.040, Speaker A: There's basically the equivalent of like a transcription error that just gets amplified down the road and then pretty soon it's like, hey, although the paper was right because the paper can be proved in this closed form way, the stuff that we're doing that kind of works around the paper to make it implementable ends up having a bug in it.
00:24:15.490 - 00:24:36.174, Speaker D: It is funny. I feel like when I first got into crypto, people were obsessed with consensus level attacks, 51% attacks. That was always a discussion of like, wow, is someone going to prevent a 51% attack on this network? And we basically never see 51% attacks, only on kind of like the tiniest shittiest network. And if anything, it's all these other types of attacks that have really proliferated, which, again, is not really solved with a layer two, necessarily.
00:24:36.302 - 00:25:37.686, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, one thing I'd say is my co author Guillermo always likes to say the only real proof is actually being implemented and running in Live. And one of the other things about my personal distaste, I think for a lot of the zero knowledge proof papers is they're written in the proofs and the algorithms are written in this way, where it's like here is a model of the adversary, and here's a model of the user, and here's an algorithm of how they interact with each other. But the way you analyze how they interact with each other is kind of like piecemeal. You kind of are like this little way of me sending you a challenge, gives you you report with this type of reply. And when you prove things like that, instead of trying to prove broader properties A, your proofs are all very case based. So you have, like 500 cases, and it's very hard to actually check every single one. As a reader, as a reader, when you're reading a math paper, you should be reading it.
00:25:37.686 - 00:25:56.110, Speaker C: And when you get stuck, you go try to redeve something and verify the things. But the problem with these proofs have a million sub cases is like, no one's going to verify the 128 sub cases, right? You try to spot check, and that's effectively, for better or worse. That's what peer review does too, for these papers.
00:25:57.490 - 00:26:10.622, Speaker B: Just so I understand what that is. That means when you're creating it, people don't go through and test all the things that have already been written about how to implement it. They're just like testing specific, sort of like a random check at an airport.
00:26:10.686 - 00:26:45.550, Speaker C: So when you write a math proof, you say, like, okay, I'm assuming A, and then there's some property A implies B, and then B implies C, and then C implies D. But the problem is you can also have not linear proofs where you say, I assume property A. Property A implies properties B, one b, two b, three dot dot, dot b 128. And then you have to look through all those cases separately. And the reader usually that's not considered like, an elegant math proof. It's usually considered, like, ugly when you have a lot of cases and people just won't read all 128 unless they're formally verified.
00:26:46.130 - 00:27:06.034, Speaker A: It's kind of like, imagine that you were proofreading someone else's book and they had like 500 citations. You're like, I'm not going to read if you have. One citation for the core thing. If you have 500, I'll check a few of them. But I don't know, no matter how good of an editor you are, unless you're like, I don't know, you're working in a sweatshop, you're not literally going to check every single citation because you.
00:27:06.072 - 00:27:20.006, Speaker B: Yeah, that's not how it works in book publishing. But anyway but this actually leads me to because the copy editor proofreader or whatever, they will read everything and check everything. Not that I've done this job before.
00:27:20.188 - 00:27:21.938, Speaker A: They're much more rigorous than the mathematician.
00:27:21.954 - 00:27:25.382, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, trust me, peer review is a very broken process. You don't have to tell me.
00:27:25.516 - 00:28:05.894, Speaker B: But I do have a question because this is something that I was wondering about in general, about the DeFi and everything. So do you remember back when this is a long time ago, but was it called imBTC when they did that? Like er seven? Yeah. Okay, so just to catch people up in case they didn't follow this, there was like this exploit that happened and people were like, what were they thinking? Because the exploit was known already. It had been known for like a month or something. And then they implemented in this way where everybody knew that it would be vulnerable. And so it was just like, this is such a stupid mistake. But I did have a question because now that I'm seeing all these hacks, for those of you who've been on my show, you might know that I have this checklist that I do before I record.
00:28:05.894 - 00:28:29.966, Speaker B: And sometimes people are like, oh, it's like a really good list. And I'm like, oh, you're listening to a list of all the mistakes I've ever made on the show. But it made me wonder, for DeFi and stuff, is there a place where people are kind of collating all these different errors and where people can kind of look up like, oh, okay, so I'm about to implement such and such. What are the known vulnerabilities? Like, if I mistakenly implement it this way or that way? Are people doing that?
00:28:29.988 - 00:29:15.520, Speaker C: Because if not, there are these collections of them. But the problem is that there's a lot of translation error that can happen where you might write in your code base, you might write like A equals one, I equals seven. And you always use that convention. But in someone else's code they write baby equals one and Iota equals seven. And then you have to go through and translate and you rename the functions. No one is consistently naming things, right? There's not like a single the language is the same, but the choice of sort of dialect of each programmer is actually quite different, which leads to these kind of divergences between a specification and the real thing. It's actually very hard to keep them one to one.
00:29:15.970 - 00:29:16.766, Speaker B: Okay.
00:29:16.948 - 00:29:54.386, Speaker D: Also to Tarin's point about nonlinear math proofs and these weird combinatorial kind of issues, when many different factors, interact with many different factors, I remember, in the Imbdc thing. So Imbdc is sort of like a competitor to WBDC. It uses ERC seven Seven, which is sort of a different version of ERC 20 that adds some extra functions and stuff like that. And then there was Deforce, which DeForest was just like a pure fork of compound V Two, which is a money market protocol. And so in isolation, these things are fine, right? Like a fork of compound will be head the same as compound. There's nothing inherently wrong with seven seven seven or the limitation. But when you put these two things together, well, it wasn't really built for this and that sort of introduced the bug.
00:29:54.386 - 00:30:04.922, Speaker D: And so it's like if you're not thinking of all these different you have many, many different dimensions that these things are intersecting on, and one bad intersection can sort of cause a terrible cascade.
00:30:05.066 - 00:30:05.710, Speaker B: Right.
00:30:05.860 - 00:30:12.654, Speaker C: And automatically checking these things may have more cases than the number of particles in the universe. So you're not going to be doing it.
00:30:12.852 - 00:30:43.754, Speaker A: Yeah. And that's the thing, right. We do have static analysis tools that will automatically run over code bases. But to your point, it's like backwards looking, right? It's like the last hack is the thing that you're able to check for, and the new hack or the generative interaction of multiple different potential bugs. There's so many ways in which things can interact in a way you didn't predict before, that if you deeply understand how all these things work and how they interconnect with each other, well, that's just being a super experienced security engineer. That's what a security engineer is for.
00:30:43.792 - 00:30:54.240, Speaker B: Yeah. I have another idea. I think Sam's Son should kind of put his learnings into a course and then train people to do what he does. Is that like a crazy idea?
00:30:55.570 - 00:31:07.170, Speaker A: Is it consensus diligence that has, like, a big repository of all these security stuff? So there are things like that that do exist, that people do learn from. And there's a ethereum security bootcamp, I think, called Securium.
00:31:08.230 - 00:31:10.222, Speaker B: Are they any good one in Amsterdam?
00:31:10.286 - 00:31:22.018, Speaker A: I've heard they're pretty good. But the reality is learning to be a security engineer is just actually really hard because it's like learning to be a great editor, right. You can read a book on, like, here were the big mistakes that previously.
00:31:22.034 - 00:31:27.174, Speaker C: I mean, a lot of it's just like sitting and monitoring things and finding stuff and then like no, but also.
00:31:27.212 - 00:31:40.474, Speaker B: I think you have to think very creatively. Samsung must have some good imaginative tools in his brain to combine all that, to see things that other people cannot see. I bet he has a very creative mind.
00:31:40.592 - 00:32:16.520, Speaker A: Well, the other thing that is, it's very different to be an attacker versus a defender, right. The kinds of people who are very good, it's called sort of Red Team. Red Team is like the people who go in and try to attack protocols and break them. The kinds of people who do that are not necessarily the best security engineers. To be a security engineer, you also be thinking about how to solve application level problems and make sure that, okay, we're going to build this thing in a secure way. But we also got to make sure that it works, that it's performant, that the UX is good, and you have to balance all those things together in order to build a protocol. Well, and of course, with most of these protocols, we see it because we're VCs and so we're backing a lot of these guys.
00:32:16.520 - 00:32:24.006, Speaker A: There are very few security engineers who have meaningful experience doing security on solidity.
00:32:24.118 - 00:32:31.926, Speaker C: Maybe more kind of trite way of putting it is like an attacker only needs a proof of existence. They need just like one counterexample.
00:32:32.038 - 00:32:32.314, Speaker A: Right.
00:32:32.352 - 00:32:40.318, Speaker C: But a builder and security engineer need to be for all they need to consider for all cases. Clearly, one is way less work than the other.
00:32:40.404 - 00:32:41.086, Speaker B: Right.
00:32:41.268 - 00:32:51.026, Speaker C: And that ends up being the biggest problem. It's like the combinatorial search space for the builder is just so much bigger than the attacker. The attacker just only needs like, one.
00:32:51.208 - 00:32:52.606, Speaker B: Entry point for their builders.
00:32:52.638 - 00:32:54.420, Speaker D: There's so many more attackers than there are.
00:32:54.790 - 00:32:55.570, Speaker A: Totally.
00:32:55.990 - 00:32:59.926, Speaker C: Well, the attackers are better funded after they win.
00:32:59.948 - 00:33:00.946, Speaker A: They are even better funded.
00:33:00.978 - 00:33:01.560, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:33:02.490 - 00:33:11.046, Speaker A: The way to imagine it is like, if to be a security engineer in crypto is like, you're a goalie, like soccer, football, I don't know where your.
00:33:11.068 - 00:33:13.674, Speaker B: Audience yeah, but you have to work 24 7365.
00:33:13.712 - 00:33:18.406, Speaker A: Yeah, but everybody on the field is trying to get the ball and they all have their own balls.
00:33:18.438 - 00:33:18.922, Speaker D: Right?
00:33:19.056 - 00:33:22.246, Speaker A: All these different balls are all kicking in. You're constantly trying to catch things.
00:33:22.288 - 00:33:22.638, Speaker B: Right.
00:33:22.724 - 00:33:26.174, Speaker A: And if one person gets the ball in the money.
00:33:26.372 - 00:33:32.560, Speaker B: Right, but I didn't see like, I think this was about Beanstalk. Some security for auditing firm was perfect.
00:33:34.530 - 00:33:35.642, Speaker C: You are the CEO.
00:33:35.706 - 00:33:39.280, Speaker A: You are clearly the CEO of the show. He's telling the thing, I was trying to move on.
00:33:39.910 - 00:33:43.074, Speaker B: I was like, where did I read this? Okay, so you put it in the notes. Yes.
00:33:43.112 - 00:34:15.934, Speaker A: So let me give you the brief debrief on Beanstalk. So Beanstalk got hacked this week for 180,000,000, which makes them the fifth largest DFI hack in history. So it's been a pretty bad month for on chain hacks. We had the number one hack with Axe Infinity and then number five with Beanstalk. So the attack was actually pretty wild. And so I was looking into this yesterday, trying to understand exactly what happened. So the attacker made off with 80 million, meaning that 100 million of it was just, I guess, lost or uncleared in LPPs or something.
00:34:15.972 - 00:34:18.654, Speaker B: But also they donated it or something, right?
00:34:18.772 - 00:34:37.282, Speaker A: No. Okay, so let me explain what happened. The thing about Beanstalk so Beanstalk is a stablecoin. It was like getting a lot of hype on I remember you guys were talking about a while back. So it's like a stablecoin protocol. And the governance in Beanstalk was designed to be able to protect against drive by governance attacks. Right.
00:34:37.282 - 00:34:39.554, Speaker A: And the way that it does that is governance attack.
00:34:39.592 - 00:34:42.450, Speaker C: Now, that's the first time I've heard that, and I love that phrase.
00:34:42.530 - 00:35:11.326, Speaker A: Well, so the idea is that when you put up a governance proposal, the governance proposal has to be live for at least 24 hours before it can be voted on. And then if you cross some threshold of voting, then it gets implemented. So what the attacker did so they needed some lead time because this is a governance based attack, which is crazy. We haven't seen a lot of these right now. Normally, if you just put up a governance based attack that says, send me all the money, and then you take a bunch of tokens and you vote on yourself getting all the money, obviously no one's going to vote on that. They're going to be like, who the hell is this guy? And I'm going to kick you out. Right.
00:35:11.326 - 00:35:47.878, Speaker A: So what they did, they did two things simultaneously. So first is they put in two proposals almost exactly the same time. So first they put in this thing that was like their governance proposal called Bips, like Bitcoin, but it's for Beanstock. So they did BIP 18. BIP 18 was send all the money to the attacker, and then they sent in BIP 19, but they changed the name of it to BIP 18 to make it seem like it was a name collision. And that's what they put up on the governance forum. And BIP 19, which they called BIP 18, was, let's donate two hundred and fifty k to Ukraine because Ukraine is having a really tough time and it's so great, we want to support Ukraine.
00:35:47.878 - 00:36:22.214, Speaker A: And so both of these governance proposals would lie for 24 hours, but no one noticed the real BIP 18, which was send all the money to the attacker. And after 24 hours passed, these things were up for a vote. And what the attacker did so this was the big mistake that Beanstalk had in their governance, is that they did not make it resistant to flash loans. So somebody who flash loaned the token was able to vote in governance and use that to cross the threshold to implement a protocol change. So the attacker was able to flash loan a huge amount of the governance token, instantaneously vote on the proposal, pass.
00:36:22.252 - 00:36:25.906, Speaker C: It, receive the right before it ended. Right before the vote ended.
00:36:25.938 - 00:36:28.934, Speaker A: Oh, wait, did they have the borrow live?
00:36:29.132 - 00:36:33.322, Speaker C: No, I think they put the proposal up and then the flash loan was later.
00:36:33.376 - 00:36:33.642, Speaker D: Right.
00:36:33.696 - 00:36:36.006, Speaker A: Oh, I see. Yeah, they took the flash loan and then voted.
00:36:36.038 - 00:36:37.814, Speaker C: Flash loan was like, right before it ended.
00:36:37.862 - 00:36:54.214, Speaker A: I see. Right before the period ended. Yeah. So they flash loaned a crapload of tokens voted for their proposal right before the proposal window was about to end, which passed the proposal, which transferred all the funds into the attacker's wallet. And they made off like thieves and dumped all the tokens and washed it into tornadoes.
00:36:54.282 - 00:37:20.726, Speaker C: The Ukraine wallet still got the also, there was some very clever low level bit twiddling to make the payment to themselves, not look like the payment to themselves. They routed it to another function call. So if you wanted to inspect it, you would actually have to go through a few layers before you realize there was a transfer call. It was like they were like making it look like it was doing some very kind of complicated what did it.
00:37:20.748 - 00:37:21.878, Speaker A: Look like it was doing?
00:37:22.044 - 00:37:32.006, Speaker C: It looked like it was like doing some function to compute what the new interest rate should be or something. And it was named like that. And then at the bottom, this person was actually quite clever.
00:37:32.198 - 00:37:33.902, Speaker A: It was a very sophisticated attack.
00:37:34.036 - 00:37:59.330, Speaker C: I mean, the thing I personally enjoyed about it was there were like all these people who are just like, oh yeah, I made like $5 million in b. And I'm like, I can't read their paper without even being able to analyze it. Forget about their code. Their code reads like nonsense because they just name everything after a farm animal. And as I'm reading the code, it's like pig herd.
00:38:00.390 - 00:38:04.854, Speaker A: It's very reminiscent of Maker better.
00:38:05.052 - 00:38:10.166, Speaker C: Because the problem is the Maker words. Very few of them were English words or like right.
00:38:10.348 - 00:38:28.234, Speaker A: So for people who don't know, this is a very famous thing that everybody in smart contract world picks on Makerdow for. So MakerDAO has all these weird words that they invented for concepts inside of their smart contracts that nobody other than the Maker team. There's like, there's vats and there's jars and there's tubs.
00:38:28.362 - 00:38:31.082, Speaker C: Yeah, but flap, flip flop.
00:38:31.226 - 00:38:32.222, Speaker D: There are real words.
00:38:32.276 - 00:38:33.806, Speaker A: But yes, they are real words.
00:38:33.908 - 00:38:36.174, Speaker C: The reasoning behind it, though, is it.
00:38:36.212 - 00:39:01.866, Speaker D: Forces engineers to build to spec, right? When you have common English variable names, it's like, oh, well, this is the interest rate and this is whatever. And you sort of create shortcuts in your mind of, oh, that's what this variable means. That's what this function means. As opposed to we're going to sort of create this abstract spec for what the protocol is going to do. And you build it this way and then we check to make sure it was built this way versus like humans sort of playing tricks on themselves.
00:39:01.968 - 00:39:07.114, Speaker A: I understand the logic, but it is very annoying, incredibly impenetrable because the fact.
00:39:07.152 - 00:39:14.546, Speaker C: That I actually think their design is way better than the bean thing was like, I remember looking at it like, you know what? I'm not going to analyze it.
00:39:14.548 - 00:39:21.034, Speaker D: It's like a Senor shares coin, but with like two extra coins. There's like multiple levels of expansion and contract.
00:39:21.082 - 00:39:22.270, Speaker C: It's very weird.
00:39:22.690 - 00:39:27.698, Speaker D: But yeah, someone actually made, like, a translated version of the MakerDAO code base at some point that actually had the.
00:39:27.704 - 00:39:47.062, Speaker C: Real variable names in Vandesan. Yeah, yeah, he made it. But I will say I just enjoy the shot before to, mainly because the only other Tarun and Twitter who is in crypto Twitter was the biggest bean Shill, and now he hasn't tweeted for three days.
00:39:47.116 - 00:39:52.714, Speaker A: And I'm like, yes, you need to tag him. You need to tag him on this episode. Wow.
00:39:52.912 - 00:40:03.422, Speaker C: His name is Rune on fat rune. He was really shilling on crypto Twitter. Well, I feel like crypto Twitter people always tweet him.
00:40:03.476 - 00:40:40.406, Speaker A: I see the biggest haseeb actually, this is related story. So the biggest Haseeb is the CEO of Ifani, which is like a phone him, you know? So, like, I remember I met him in a cafe a long time ago because he was like, you're the other Haseeb, I need to meet you. And I'm like, okay, I don't have the same need, but it sounds like you really want this is very important to you. And so we met up, and he was working on Lendroid at that time, which was like a big ICO at that time. And he was like, I have the Twitter screen name Haseeb. I'm like, I know, I know you do. He's like, yeah, it's really important to me.
00:40:40.406 - 00:41:01.902, Speaker A: And I was like, I can tell. And he's like, But I don't have haseeb.com. It's like some doctor in the UK and I'm trying to get him to sell it to me. Can you help me? And I'm like, no, I don't know. I don't like, no, I don't I feel no affiliation despite the real he's definitely he's crushing me right now, so I got to play catch up.
00:41:01.956 - 00:41:02.702, Speaker B: He's crushing you?
00:41:02.756 - 00:41:02.974, Speaker A: How?
00:41:03.012 - 00:41:03.600, Speaker B: So?
00:41:05.970 - 00:41:08.674, Speaker A: He's got to see the Twitter handle. I'm playing from behind.
00:41:08.792 - 00:41:11.090, Speaker B: Well, I think you have more followers.
00:41:12.630 - 00:41:19.510, Speaker A: Actually, I don't think that's true. I think he has more followers than me. Yeah, exactly. I'm eclipsed in every way by the other Haseeb. It hurts.
00:41:19.850 - 00:41:25.526, Speaker C: This other Rune has been on a very fast growth path because of the word cell.
00:41:25.708 - 00:41:29.622, Speaker A: That's true. Yes, that's right. He's the inventor of the word cell shape rotating thing.
00:41:29.676 - 00:41:30.866, Speaker B: I think that's so stupid.
00:41:30.978 - 00:41:32.150, Speaker A: You think it's so stupid?
00:41:32.230 - 00:41:32.554, Speaker B: I do.
00:41:32.592 - 00:41:33.306, Speaker A: Okay, let's talk about it.
00:41:33.328 - 00:41:36.874, Speaker C: People love false dichotomies. Humans are just, like, easily bandied into.
00:41:36.912 - 00:41:41.854, Speaker A: Just believing it's not a false dichotomy. It's two axes. Yeah.
00:41:41.972 - 00:41:49.550, Speaker C: A boolean predicate whose probability of success is one half plus epsilon, where epsilon is ten to minus 80th is not very useful.
00:41:50.130 - 00:41:51.342, Speaker B: Okay, I didn't understand.
00:41:51.476 - 00:41:52.062, Speaker A: Whatever.
00:41:52.196 - 00:42:08.002, Speaker B: I don't like simplistic things like that. Things like that. And I also don't like it that it somehow immediately portrayed journalists in some negative way. And I was just like, oh, this is like part of the whole, whatever, Silicon Valley like bashing of journalists. And I was like, oh, this is okay.
00:42:08.056 - 00:42:16.070, Speaker A: Let's so you're in a very interesting position because you obviously have been a journalist, but then you're covering crypto, Twitter.
00:42:17.130 - 00:42:17.874, Speaker B: I am a journalist.
00:42:17.922 - 00:42:23.610, Speaker A: You are a journalist. You are a journalist. Well, I mean, I think what you do now is like much more than just journalism.
00:42:23.950 - 00:42:25.290, Speaker B: Oh, really? How so?
00:42:25.360 - 00:42:32.422, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I think it's like you're more like a like you've kind of taken on a broader role.
00:42:32.486 - 00:42:38.922, Speaker B: I think you have well, I mean, I get interviewed by the press, but like yeah, I mean, I still consider myself a reporter.
00:42:38.986 - 00:42:56.366, Speaker A: Fair enough. Okay, well, you consider yourself reporter. I don't think of you as a reporter. I don't think of you as a reporter, but I think most people think of you as just like because you're not affiliated with the brand. I feel like it's very rare for reporters to not have their own I feel like all these guys are going, like, crypto.
00:42:56.398 - 00:43:01.366, Speaker D: Louis Thoreau, you're documenting all the weird shit that happens in crypto, but you're amongst exactly.
00:43:01.468 - 00:43:21.222, Speaker A: Exactly. You're one of the people you're not like, I'm from Forbes. Like, hello, tell me all your secrets, and then I'll write about relationship. It's a different relationship with what you're covering than I think for almost any reporter.
00:43:21.286 - 00:43:47.762, Speaker B: Well, I mean, I feel like my understanding of crypto is probably beyond that of a normal reporter, but the way I conduct my work, I still think of as journalism. And I'm not doing any differently from how I did it at Forbes, except that, yeah, I probably go deeper into it than you would for the Forbes audience. But people often do think of me as being in crypto. I do not think of myself as being in crypto. I think that I am as close to being in crypto as you can be without actually being in it.
00:43:47.816 - 00:43:49.890, Speaker A: What does it mean to not be in crypto?
00:43:50.050 - 00:44:01.980, Speaker B: Well, because I'm a journalist covering it. If you guys are all like, the players playing the game, I'm the referee where I'm kind of in the game, but not in the game. I'm not supposed to affect play.
00:44:03.230 - 00:44:09.418, Speaker C: But you did. You said people were convinced by you to join and change their life.
00:44:09.504 - 00:44:11.882, Speaker B: Oh, well, yeah, you're playing the game.
00:44:11.936 - 00:44:14.542, Speaker A: I mean, you might think you're not playing the game, but you're part of the game.
00:44:14.596 - 00:44:17.758, Speaker C: You're a referee wearing you're like in.
00:44:17.764 - 00:44:23.520, Speaker A: The WWE, when the referee tears a shirt off and starts beating people in the ring, you're in the game.
00:44:24.070 - 00:44:29.374, Speaker B: I don't think of myself that way. Do you think that I'm influencing events in crypto?
00:44:29.502 - 00:44:30.082, Speaker A: 100%.
00:44:30.136 - 00:44:31.490, Speaker C: I mean, the Dow hack.
00:44:34.550 - 00:44:39.220, Speaker B: That'S a normal journalistic thing to do. Like, you find out who did this thing.
00:44:39.750 - 00:44:43.010, Speaker A: People on crypto, Twitter who are, like, calling each other out and getting into fights.
00:44:43.090 - 00:44:55.180, Speaker C: I would say journalists in crypto have not had as much success at doing it. Right. Like, the Satoshi thing is a great example of so I don't know if you're successful at it. I think it somehow does impact the market.
00:44:55.790 - 00:45:00.026, Speaker B: Oh, interesting. But I don't think revealing who the Dow hacker was affected the market at all.
00:45:00.128 - 00:45:12.430, Speaker C: Well, not in the sense that it impacted prices immediately, but impacted how people's perception of certain projects was right and certain people at different times maybe impact their future.
00:45:12.500 - 00:45:31.218, Speaker D: I think maybe part of it too is frankly I feel like the bar is very low for cryptojournalism in general. There's maybe five cryptojournalists I think of who are smart and competent at their jobs and obviously you are one of them and so it's like thank God we have Laura to actually cover the industry well, because otherwise I'm serious.
00:45:31.314 - 00:46:13.154, Speaker B: No, yeah, but I wouldn't be too hard on journalists for getting things wrong because this is like the basic thing about journalism. I've had people like my mom for instance, she was a pharmacist, she's retired and she couldn't understand what I did because she learned this body of knowledge and then she applies it every day. Right. And my job is I'm supposed to take things I don't necessarily know and learn them fast and learn them well enough to explain them to other people and it's a skill. It's not like having the knowledge, it's a skill. So it's more about being able to learn quickly and then being able to explain things well. Yeah, in that regard I don't feel like I'm a crypto person anyway, whatever.
00:46:13.154 - 00:47:01.522, Speaker B: You get what I'm saying, you guys have the knowledge. I don't think of myself as a crypto person. I can learn things and whatever but I'm not in there doing it. Yeah, people often come to me and it's weird sometimes people act like they think that I know everything in crypto and I'm like, no, I'm behind all my sources. My sources are the people who really know what's going on and I have to do my best to eke it all out of them but I basically harass them a lot to get that information. But if you were to ask me right now to do something in DeFi or on ethereum or whatever, it would take me like, I don't know, like 5 hours people would lose all respect for me. They would be like oh, we thought she knew what she was doing in crypto but clearly she doesn't because I spend all my time creating content, I don't spend all my time actually using this stuff.
00:47:01.522 - 00:47:06.530, Speaker B: Whatever I call people up and I want them to tell me things. So it's just different.
00:47:06.680 - 00:47:13.058, Speaker C: You would also be surprised at how many professional investors in this industry have themselves never used crypto.
00:47:13.234 - 00:47:18.770, Speaker B: Oh yeah, no, that actually doesn't surprise me because I actually think journalism and VC are not that different.
00:47:18.860 - 00:47:25.980, Speaker C: Yeah, it is true that a lot of the early TechCrunch writers became like venture investors very soon after.
00:47:26.350 - 00:48:15.242, Speaker B: But TechCrunch is like, I think especially chummy with the industry it covers in a way that the Wall Street Journal is not. TechCrunch is like a kind of a different animal than other media. But anyway okay, but we never got to my audit point about the Beanstalk thing. So can we talk about that? Oh, let's talk about it, yeah, because somebody tweeted about the Beanstalk thing and they were an auditing company. They were like, this is why we only pay ourselves by the number of vulnerabilities that we identify. So they were saying we get paid by every time we find a vulnerability when we audit something, we earn money from that. But they were saying that other companies just charge by project or whatever and so there's no incentive for them to actually find things that went wrong because they're going to make the same amount of money no matter what.
00:48:15.242 - 00:48:18.794, Speaker B: So this company was saying like, we're incentivized. I don't remember.
00:48:18.992 - 00:48:22.300, Speaker D: Wasn't it you that put it in the other ones?
00:48:22.830 - 00:48:23.874, Speaker A: Was it Pexhield?
00:48:23.942 - 00:48:24.830, Speaker B: Pecshield?
00:48:25.330 - 00:48:26.478, Speaker A: I don't think we linked to it.
00:48:26.564 - 00:48:26.910, Speaker B: Okay.
00:48:26.980 - 00:49:10.874, Speaker C: I think there is this other problem though, that happens because if you actually look at different audit reports, different auditors will consider different types of things. Vulnerabilities. There's no standards for what a just the basics of what a low, medium and high vulnerability are. Every auditor makes ones that are different and obviously biased towards the things they're better at. I feel like you're going to have this good heart law type of thing if you make that the thing. Everyone's just going to optimize for the low vulnerability ones that everyone has by accident, which are actually gas saving things. It'll have this good heart type of thing of like the metric you use will suddenly get like, well, there's never.
00:49:10.912 - 00:49:45.938, Speaker A: I mean, that's true no matter what you do though. So I can believe that it would be better. But at the same time, it's a good question of what are you actually buying when you buy an audit. And the reality is that, okay, one thing you're buying is like, okay, if there's an obvious vulnerability, we want you to write it up and explain it to us. But a lot of what you're buying when you're buying an audit is you're buying like a stamp of approval of basically a trusted third party saying like, you are good and is safe to use you right now. The vulnerability here in Beanstalk, the core of the vulnerability was really that you did not have to lock up funds in order to vote. That was the core vulnerability.
00:49:45.938 - 00:49:54.294, Speaker A: And that allowed a flash loan to go in and participate in this vote, which is like, if you remember, Makerdow had the scare a long time ago. Remember who it was who published a Brandon Curtis.
00:49:54.342 - 00:49:56.220, Speaker D: It was B protocol that did it.
00:49:57.870 - 00:49:59.114, Speaker A: Oh, is that right?
00:49:59.312 - 00:50:02.940, Speaker D: Everyone's like, what the fuck? They're like, yeah, one thing to go through. And they're like.
00:50:05.230 - 00:50:21.650, Speaker A: So Makerdow had this big scare that all of Maker could have been turned off or know, some horrible thing could have happened through a flash loan. And so Naker was the first one to say, okay, we're going to make it so that you cannot flash loan governance. But there's a very basic vulnerability that beanstalk could have done to mitigate the whole thing.
00:50:21.720 - 00:50:35.970, Speaker D: The other very basic issue is they don't have a delay between when a proposal is passed and when it's actually implemented. So something like compound, even if a malicious proposal goes through, there's a 48 hours delay between before it actually goes live and someone like Zero X and most other protocols.
00:50:36.050 - 00:50:44.982, Speaker C: Well, they did have a time lock. The problem is their timelock had some sort of like the two proposal thing actually messed up their timelock execution.
00:50:45.046 - 00:50:45.706, Speaker A: Oh, really?
00:50:45.808 - 00:50:57.166, Speaker C: God no. It's a little bit more subtle. Unfortunately, the person who did this did notice a lot of kind of nuance about the time.
00:50:57.268 - 00:51:06.962, Speaker D: I'm curious about that because I know there's obviously delay between when a proposal goes live when it can be voted. But even again, for compound, even if something gets approved, it doesn't actually go live for another 48 hours.
00:51:07.016 - 00:51:28.826, Speaker C: Yeah. So the problem here is that when you have two proposals that are proposed at roughly the same time, you have this problem where the time lock only really applies to one if you don't set it up correctly. And so a lot of places will just be like, you can only have one proposal live at a time, or they have to be staged in some way. Whereas the Beanstalk thing did not have that.
00:51:28.848 - 00:51:29.434, Speaker D: I see.
00:51:29.552 - 00:51:31.398, Speaker A: Did they roll their own governance?
00:51:31.574 - 00:51:34.234, Speaker C: No, everyone just modifies compound, like pretty.
00:51:34.272 - 00:51:36.726, Speaker A: Much, but they didn't include those parts.
00:51:36.838 - 00:51:37.594, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:51:37.792 - 00:51:50.990, Speaker B: So in general, after these, how did they turn it into real money? We've seen that a lot of exchanges or whatever will kind of blacklist the addresses, but are people actually getting money out of it?
00:51:51.060 - 00:51:52.538, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, it depends.
00:51:52.634 - 00:52:08.438, Speaker D: Sometimes it is very hard to liquidate, like if you have a stable coin and you can't get across the bridge. But in this scenario, they just put a bunch of ethan like tornado cash and then depending on the size of the anonymity pool for the asset also that you're hacking, you may or may not be able to anonymize it effectively. But I think for this amount it.
00:52:08.444 - 00:52:09.750, Speaker A: Shouldn'T be like too difficult.
00:52:09.820 - 00:52:12.360, Speaker D: Depending on how long they wait and how long they are.
00:52:12.810 - 00:52:18.802, Speaker C: It is significantly easier for bitcoin, though, I will say just like the volume.
00:52:18.866 - 00:52:23.660, Speaker B: Of just like wasabi, which now we all know you can demix that.
00:52:24.030 - 00:52:27.014, Speaker C: Yeah, you can demix it with a lot of resources.
00:52:27.062 - 00:52:27.226, Speaker A: Right.
00:52:27.248 - 00:52:37.760, Speaker C: So the question is, is someone willing to pay that much to demix for like an 80 million hack? It might actually not be like you might not get someone who's wait, hold on.
00:52:39.410 - 00:52:50.674, Speaker A: Do we. All agree that you can just dmix wasabi transactions now, because I registered I think when we originally talked about this, I was like, I'm skeptical of this.
00:52:50.792 - 00:53:18.922, Speaker B: Yeah, that reminds me. I know we'll discuss this another time because there's a video I will somehow have to find this in my Twitter mentions that I did mean to watch where someone made some video where they analyzed kind of like what happened with the Dow hacker and what happened with that Dmixing. And it was like a Twitter handle where I was like, oh, this person would definitely know. And I meant to watch it. I never got to watch it, so let me do that.
00:53:18.976 - 00:53:19.242, Speaker A: Okay.
00:53:19.296 - 00:53:22.090, Speaker B: I've had such a whirlwind. Two months or whatever.
00:53:22.240 - 00:53:23.286, Speaker A: To be continued.
00:53:23.398 - 00:53:27.200, Speaker C: Yeah, but at least there's some partial information. That's right.
00:53:28.050 - 00:53:31.550, Speaker A: If you messed up kind of post mixing, I can totally understand that there.
00:53:31.620 - 00:53:49.798, Speaker C: I just think the bitcoin mixing services have way more liquidity. And also the tornado withdrawal sizes are like they don't have enough. Yeah, they don't have enough, like ten mil a day. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. I agree that 80 mil could get out, but if it was like the Ronan hacker would be didn't they just.
00:53:49.804 - 00:53:53.394, Speaker A: Like, mass sell on curve and just turn being into USD?
00:53:53.442 - 00:53:54.550, Speaker B: So then how much do they get?
00:53:54.620 - 00:53:55.558, Speaker A: 80 million.
00:53:55.724 - 00:54:06.220, Speaker B: Wow. Okay. So then that answers my question, because the question I was going to ask is, I thought that a lot of these people couldn't even cash out because.
00:54:06.990 - 00:54:10.282, Speaker A: Turning it into a different asset is one thing, cashing out is another thing.
00:54:10.336 - 00:54:13.882, Speaker C: Yeah. Do you mean like getting into dollars in a bank account?
00:54:14.016 - 00:54:17.678, Speaker B: Well, just getting away with something where they can actually make money from it.
00:54:17.764 - 00:54:27.214, Speaker D: However you get clean, know you can sell it and report it as income. I think the IRS is very explicit that you don't care if you're committing crimes as long as you, like, declare.
00:54:27.262 - 00:54:28.946, Speaker C: Income and pay taxes on it.
00:54:29.128 - 00:54:35.774, Speaker B: Oh, my God. These hackers are paying money on their other income.
00:54:35.822 - 00:54:38.526, Speaker D: I mean, if they don't want to get caught by the IRS, they should be paying taxes.
00:54:38.558 - 00:54:40.502, Speaker A: That's how they got Al Capone, right? Yeah.
00:54:40.556 - 00:54:40.870, Speaker B: Wow.
00:54:40.940 - 00:54:44.310, Speaker A: Yeah. It's fine to do crime as long as you pay your taxes.
00:54:45.530 - 00:54:59.126, Speaker B: Well, but the reason I was asking was because I was wondering, some of these bounties are somewhat generous. I don't remember which one it was, but one of them was like, roughly 2 million or something. And I was like, oh, well, if they can't really cash out, then it's.
00:54:59.158 - 00:55:01.740, Speaker A: Better if they can cash out once.
00:55:02.910 - 00:55:12.094, Speaker D: Clearly try to renegotiate. And they said, hey, send us back 70. You can keep eight for yourself, and we won't go after you. Won't look after you. It'll be done.
00:55:12.212 - 00:55:12.880, Speaker B: Right.
00:55:16.870 - 00:55:22.258, Speaker C: I do think it's still a little hard to sell all of it at once.
00:55:22.424 - 00:55:23.538, Speaker D: Not at once.
00:55:23.704 - 00:55:41.290, Speaker C: I feel like usually what people do is they really lower your collateral and then they start just like collecting kind of like earning spread and via perps and things. Like Buybit used to be kind of the exchange that the hackers all go to because they never KYC now. Yeah, they used to just never KYC.
00:55:42.190 - 00:55:45.946, Speaker A: There's still a few non KYC exchanges, but most of them don't do that much.
00:55:45.968 - 00:55:46.694, Speaker C: There's just no volume.
00:55:46.742 - 00:55:47.002, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:55:47.056 - 00:55:48.618, Speaker C: You can't really get out there.
00:55:48.704 - 00:55:49.242, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:55:49.376 - 00:55:53.680, Speaker C: Also, a lot of banks won't like ACH won't wire to them and stuff.
00:55:55.250 - 00:55:58.480, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, I have to assume most of these attackers are not American anyway.
00:55:58.930 - 00:56:01.920, Speaker C: But they still may want to wire to a real bank account.
00:56:02.370 - 00:56:02.782, Speaker A: Yes.
00:56:02.836 - 00:56:09.330, Speaker C: Because we're not in a world where everyone's using stable coins yet for yeah.
00:56:09.400 - 00:56:12.802, Speaker A: At that size, it becomes difficult. But look, if you're North Korea, then.
00:56:12.856 - 00:56:14.594, Speaker C: If you're North Korea, it's fine, right? Yeah.
00:56:14.712 - 00:56:18.862, Speaker B: Obviously if you're North Korea, then you're not going to pursue a bounty.
00:56:19.006 - 00:56:52.958, Speaker A: Probably not. Probably not. Okay. The last piece of news that I want to discuss was so a lot of what I feel like I was getting on Twitter and a lot of chatter from people was about the merge being delayed. And I feel like this is like the biggest non story of all the stories this week that somehow everybody was talking about this. And I was like, how on earth do you think that the Ethereum Foundation was going to hit this deadline of all the deadlines they've missed in their entire lifetime? Clearly they're awful at software estimation and we should just bake that in to the numbers that goes. But somehow nobody was doing that.
00:56:53.044 - 00:57:03.422, Speaker B: It's probably because there's been so many delays that it just feels like at some point it's going to happen. And so, yeah, when people were saying June and they were saying it for kind of a long time, but you're right. I had Tim Baco on my show.
00:57:03.476 - 00:57:05.126, Speaker A: Last I listened to.
00:57:05.188 - 00:57:05.606, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:57:05.708 - 00:57:10.678, Speaker A: I thought it was again, like very non answer. Like, oh, we're not good at estimating. I'm like, yeah, we know. We know you're not good.
00:57:10.764 - 00:57:24.822, Speaker B: But I can't remember if this was in the recording or not, if he just said it before, but he was just like, I'm surprised that people are all up in arms about this because he was like, I kind of offhandedly said June and it wasn't like a fixed thing, but everybody had it as a fixed deadline.
00:57:24.966 - 00:57:30.060, Speaker A: It's exactly the problem with the Ethereum Foundation. They're like, well, we just say things. Why would anyone care what we say?
00:57:32.690 - 00:57:50.958, Speaker C: I also think a good if someone wants a little data science project to DOX a lot of the development correlate the commit times to the hackathons and you'll see this, like it looks like a heartbeat. It's like that's why they have to have a hackathon every month. Because otherwise nothing like really nothing totally.
00:57:50.974 - 00:57:51.794, Speaker B: Going to check that out.
00:57:51.832 - 00:58:48.660, Speaker C: Yeah. There's like a lot of weird correlation with the hackathons. But one thing I would say is I think that the longer that's delayed, the weirder or worse it is for ETH security, because the sheer dominance of staking derivatives at this point and the percentage of the network that's sitting waiting in the one way contract. And having staked ETH being levered kind of just means that there's just going to be this huge amount of sell pressure as soon as the network goes live. Because there are all these people who've locked up capital for alias. Sure they're earning some interest on their staked eat somewhere, but it's not like a lot and there's just an enormous amount of capital locked up that's just waiting for it to come out on the other side. And all those people have to sell at some point, right? Especially if they're funds, they're going to get capital calls, et cetera, right? I don't know how many funds are going to return.
00:58:50.950 - 00:59:11.146, Speaker A: I disagree with that because we don't know how much is going to come in the other way once the opportunity cost of staking goes way down because of the fact that you can actually go two way, I think you'll see a lot of capital. Like, look, I'm not going to risk going into proof of stake when I don't know that proof of stake will ever actually be that two way street. And even when the proof of stake merge happens, it's what like another upgrade until people can actually actually withdraw.
00:59:11.258 - 00:59:56.266, Speaker C: But I just mean the people who are going into lido there are people raising funds that literally are just taking like 5% fees just to put you into lido. Yeah, it's the same as these people raising funds to go into anchor. So there's these people who are raising funds where they're basically charging people 5% to take stablecoin to take dollars and they convert to UST and then they put it into anchor, get 20% giving you back them. There's a ton of people doing the same exact thing for Lido and they're all doing the levered lido. So to give some context, if you have a bunch of ETH, you want to lock it into the bridge contract so you're validating the beacon chain. You can earn interest on your ethereum but you can't really get it out. So you've locked it up and you're earning interest but you can't actually remove it.
00:59:56.266 - 01:00:24.306, Speaker C: Staking derivatives allow you to pool ETH with other people's ETH. And then there'll be validators that go earn that yield. And then there's sort of this IOU called staked ETH that you get. And staked ETH is extremely liquid and in every DeFi protocol. So you could effectively treat it like ETH and it stays pegged, actually weirdly stays pegged because theoretically it should actually be worth more. But everyone is discounting exactly by the rewards, which is like a very funny fact. It's sort of like a weird anomaly in some ways.
01:00:24.306 - 01:01:07.954, Speaker C: Like, other Staking derivatives don't have this property and so people have this staked ETH, but it's all an IOU for the real ETH, right? And they can't actually get back their real ETH. And if people are raising these funds where they're like, hey, we'll go do the whole staking thing for you, and it's like some institution that bought a bunch of ETH and they're like, we'll take 5%, you get the remaining. Those funds eventually have to close out, right? Are they going to return staked ETH to the if that happens, then everyone who gets the staked teeth is going to just sell for real eventually, right? So there's some kind of the longer this takes, the more the crazy levered behavior we're seeing. We're seeing people lever up on stake teeth like crazy.
01:01:08.072 - 01:01:11.906, Speaker D: Actually, Babylon Finance released something this week where, I mean, this is your whole.
01:01:11.928 - 01:01:15.426, Speaker C: Thing around basically automate the strategy of.
01:01:15.448 - 01:01:27.542, Speaker D: Putting on staked ETH, borrowing ETH, turning into staked ETH, putting it back, and just like levering up. And they're estimating like 810 percent using this strategy. But the question is just like, when do we see eat interest rates go up to sort of compensate and exactly pull in the market?
01:01:27.596 - 01:01:47.274, Speaker C: And this whole ultrasound money thing only works when this type of levered game is not happening. Everyone wants anchor yields. Like Dough has basically made it so that everyone has to be chasing 20%. And everyone in East Land thinks that's not true, but when you look at what's happening with staked ETH, it's like, oh yeah, everyone is literally just trying to chase dough.
01:01:47.322 - 01:01:53.680, Speaker D: Yeah, this is why the Fed's hiking rates, they're like, we got to match Anchor right now. Competitive out there.
01:01:55.010 - 01:02:13.158, Speaker C: Yeah, I just wanted to point that out. There's like something weird on the financial side that I feel like the developers don't seem to give a shit about because everyone in ETH, every ETH developer I talked to is like, staking derivatives are dumb, they'll never survive. And it's like, well, actually there's such a huge portion of ETH in there now that it's a little bit not true.
01:02:13.324 - 01:02:14.280, Speaker A: That's fair.
01:02:14.810 - 01:02:25.130, Speaker B: So I know this is like a slight detour and we don't have to address it right now, but I am curious what you think of the whole Anchor thing because I had Kevin Zhou on my podcast.
01:02:26.270 - 01:02:30.886, Speaker C: I love that clip you had. The Twitter clip of his thing was excellent for Anchor.
01:02:30.918 - 01:02:45.730, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, because he thinks it's not going to pan out and it's definitely just going to go south at some point. So I was just curious what you guys thought because if you follow that holding on Twitter, there's very polarized views on either side.
01:02:45.800 - 01:03:19.366, Speaker A: Yes, well, first caveat, we're investors in Anchor, so we invested in early round. What's our view? I don't know. I guess I'd say that Anchor did modify the protocol so that the interest rate can actually move over time. So it can now adjust compared to what it was before, which is like this flat 20%, but it's over much. I think it's like once a month it can calibrate by, like, a percent and a half or something like that. So it can't actually respond that quickly or in real time, I guess. It's, like, closer to the Fed, I guess, and then kind of very staggered moves.
01:03:19.366 - 01:03:42.846, Speaker A: By and large, I think the biggest risk is not actually to anchor itself, but more to Terra, although they're both obviously very interlinked. At the end of the day, all these algorithmic stablecoins have to get exogenous usage. Otherwise it just doesn't work. And so the mean Kevin was sort of pointing, like, look, there's no exogenous usage for this, which mean I mostly agree. So the answer is that they got to get exogenous usage, otherwise the thing's.
01:03:42.878 - 01:04:31.300, Speaker C: Going to break, I think. Another interesting thing that scares me more about it, and this is not necessarily a knock on UST. This is more a knock on the type of people who are putting ridiculous amounts of money into anchor is, like, a lot of the dumber, TradFi people that I know who are, like, don't probably couldn't tell you what a hash function is. They don't know what an address is. They're the ones who are really aping into this stuff and putting in, like, $100 million into these anchor funds, and they don't know anything about crypto. They're just, like, someone told them 20% on cash. And so that scares me because I'm like, wow, it's like this psychology people who don't even know what they're investing in is always like that to me, feels very big.
01:04:31.300 - 01:04:33.918, Speaker C: Something about that's, like, scary.
01:04:34.014 - 01:04:41.958, Speaker D: Going back to the crypto journalism stuff we were talking about earlier, there were, like, two profiles on Doe out this week and on Muna specifically. I think there was, like, one in.
01:04:41.964 - 01:04:44.614, Speaker C: Bloomberg and one in the Journal, and.
01:04:44.652 - 01:05:09.440, Speaker D: I just feel like it's a testament to crypto journalism. Where have you been for the past year? This has been a thing for the past year, like the Luna UST rise. And it's like, oh, now that it's at, whatever, $10 billion or whatever, it's like, oh, what's going on with Luna? What's going on with anchor? I'm like what? And anyway, there was a lot of concern about the whole Anchor UST situation.
01:05:09.810 - 01:05:17.634, Speaker B: But I just have to say that's the nature of our job is, like, news has to happen, and then we write about it. So it's always after the fact. But anyway, keep going.
01:05:17.672 - 01:05:40.686, Speaker C: I think the one thing I do really appreciate, I think long term for UST, from a developer standpoint, if they can get to it, is actually building good, smart contracts on Cosmos that can interact with all the other Cosmos chains. And if they do that, I think the usage will come. I actually am more bullish on the Cosmos app chain world for certain types of applications.
01:05:40.818 - 01:05:44.186, Speaker A: I mean, the problem is that USD supply is so big, right?
01:05:44.208 - 01:05:50.346, Speaker C: Well, the USD supply is big because they're these random private equity unwinding that.
01:05:50.368 - 01:06:12.386, Speaker A: Is going to be an absolute nightmare. Right. They're at that size now, kind of like when you grow your government too big, you have to find some use for them. Otherwise it's going to be extremely painful to get rid of people. And same thing for companies. Right, but governments are the most obvious example because they tend to get bloated and then not contract one way. Ratchet exactly.
01:06:12.386 - 01:06:30.982, Speaker A: And the problem with UST is kind of similar. It's very difficult to drain UST and say, okay, this thing got a little out of hand. Let's kind of wind things down a little bit. And it's so sensitive to deleveraging that it's just very hard to do it. The answer has to be you have to find the growth to justify your current supply.
01:06:31.046 - 01:06:34.940, Speaker D: Yeah, they need to QT they need to start winding it down.
01:06:35.550 - 01:06:41.718, Speaker A: Yeah, that's probably I didn't know that much about these Ted funds and these Anchor.
01:06:41.814 - 01:06:51.582, Speaker C: Yeah, no, there's just people marketing these vehicles. They're like, oh, you can't get 15% on anywhere else in your dollars. Just give us dollars. We're only putting in dollars.
01:06:51.636 - 01:06:52.266, Speaker A: That's ridiculous.
01:06:52.298 - 01:06:53.402, Speaker B: Yeah, no, that is scary.
01:06:53.466 - 01:07:12.450, Speaker A: And it's funny because so many of the pitches that we get are like, oh, you can use Anchor to bank the Unbanked. You can go start a neo bank in Africa or in Indonesia or whatever and you can give them 20% interest. It'll be so great. Everybody will sign up for this. And the story from Anchor from the beginning has been like anybody can go get interest on get yield on stables.
01:07:12.530 - 01:07:20.118, Speaker C: I mean, the difference between the outcomes, I think for Terra and Sello are that Sello tried to go for the banking, the Unbanked narrative.
01:07:20.214 - 01:07:21.820, Speaker A: I mean, they're converging now.
01:07:24.430 - 01:07:29.334, Speaker C: People with money next thing. And clearly that did have a cycle.
01:07:29.382 - 01:08:06.470, Speaker D: I mean, it's funny because there was so many of these crypto backed neo banks out there that are basically trying to do this, hey, give us dollars you put in the compound or Ave or something else, like not necessarily Anchor specifically. And they've had a lot of trouble growing and people have sort of thoughts as to why that is. Are they not spending enough on acquisition or whatever. But one of thesis and sort of what I've heard from some of these companies is like it's really hard to advertise. We'll give you 8% on your dollars, don't ask questions. And people think it's inherently a scam. So it's very funny to me that at least anecdotally from them retail is very skeptical of the 8% yield.
01:08:06.810 - 01:08:09.482, Speaker A: Institutions are like sign me up, that sounds great.
01:08:09.536 - 01:08:14.220, Speaker C: I'm sure there's not a bell curve meme. I think that's what you need for this.
01:08:16.110 - 01:08:19.770, Speaker A: Yeah, middle of the bell curve is where you die. It's unfortunate.
01:08:20.910 - 01:08:35.440, Speaker B: I don't know if this is, like, taking us too far off talking, and also I didn't know what the time is, but I feel like just to go back to your cosmos comment, I feel like I hear a lot of chatter about cosmos but not about polkadot, and I just wondered for a reason. Yeah, explain that to me.
01:08:36.470 - 01:08:37.394, Speaker A: Do you want to explain?
01:08:37.512 - 01:09:35.250, Speaker C: I don't know if there's, like, a pretty strong reason other than cosmos was able to bootstrap a lot of liquidity. It's just easier to get started writing cosmos app chains, and once osmosis became kind of like the connector. So the cosmos model, I would say the initial weak part, in my opinion, obviously extreme cosmos fans will probably maybe disagree, is that the atom coin has pretty much no usage. There's no reason to actually go to the hub, which is, like, the main place that atom is staked. And instead, it would be much better if you had something like a dex that was sort of, like, secured, a dex chain that was secured because then everyone has to go through there and it kind of can kind of have this virtuous cycle. And so osmosis did that, and that kind of bootstrapped everything in cosmos because everyone in cosmosland was running their own app chains. No one was using IBC.
01:09:35.250 - 01:10:04.262, Speaker C: But then the killer app for IBC was really DEXs and being able to go between these chains and have liquidity on different chains. And I think the UX on cosmos chains, the wallets are really magnificent. I think probably the best acquisition in crypto in the last two years was the osmosis team buying kepler, which is the main wallet and is probably the best wallet in crypto. Better than phantom, better than MetaMask. It is the best UX, period.
01:10:04.326 - 01:10:06.254, Speaker B: Wow. I'll have to try it.
01:10:06.292 - 01:10:06.846, Speaker C: You should try it.
01:10:06.868 - 01:10:11.518, Speaker A: Yeah. There's about to be a new record for best acquisition. That news will probably come out soon.
01:10:11.604 - 01:10:22.398, Speaker C: Well, I think that the price that the osmos that that was the best acquisition. They literally made the whole ecosystem. It went from a billion dollars to 17 billion because of that wallet.
01:10:22.494 - 01:10:23.090, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:10:23.240 - 01:10:25.474, Speaker C: And they paid a very tiny amount, relatively speaking.
01:10:25.512 - 01:10:25.714, Speaker A: Right.
01:10:25.752 - 01:10:27.326, Speaker B: And then what about polka dot?
01:10:27.438 - 01:10:34.162, Speaker A: I think the thing about polka dot, polka dot, I don't think it's about wallets. I think it's a more fundamental strategic mistake.
01:10:34.226 - 01:10:35.718, Speaker C: Substrate is hard to use.
01:10:35.884 - 01:11:11.502, Speaker A: So there's a bunch of stuff about the actual tech stack and also about kind of how top down polkadot has always felt relative to cosmos, which has always been kind of more bottoms up. Cosmos also much older caveat. We're early investors in cosmos as well. But the big thing that I think polkadot messed up is the parachain model and the parachain auctions. Right. So polkadot decided that in order to use polkadot instead of, like on cosmos, where it's much more open ended and you find your place in the Cosmos ecosystem and you carve out your own niche. The idea for polkadot is like, hey, if you want to use polkadot, you need to sign up for this auction.
01:11:11.502 - 01:11:44.526, Speaker A: You need to pay a bunch of money or stake a bunch of assets and compete in this big pageant of who's going to win the next auction. Oh, it's going to be this guy or that guy. And so projects have to raise a crapload of money to pay it to polkadot or raise debt and wait a very, very long time until they get actually integrated and win the auction. Now, if you're an entrepreneur, you're like, okay, I could go to any chain. I can build anywhere because I'm an awesome entrepreneur and I'm in very low supply because there aren't a lot of great entrepreneurs. You say, okay, well, I could go to Solana, where they'll pay me a lot of money. I could go to Avalanche, where they'll pay me a lot of money.
01:11:44.526 - 01:11:51.582, Speaker A: I could go to Polygon where they'll pay me a lot of money. I could go to Cosmos where I could build Bottoms up and do whatever. I go to polkadot and pay them a lot of money.
01:11:51.716 - 01:11:52.400, Speaker B: Right.
01:11:53.570 - 01:12:09.098, Speaker A: Why are you asking people to pay you money when everyone else understands the transaction goes the other way? You need to attract developers, not charge developers. And polkadot just has well, in order to be sustainable, we got to charge people. Otherwise, what's the point of dot?
01:12:09.294 - 01:12:14.610, Speaker D: It's great for Dot, bad for polkadot. And Cosmos is like, great for Cosmos, but terrible for Adam.
01:12:14.770 - 01:12:16.630, Speaker C: Adam is dogecoin.
01:12:17.610 - 01:12:18.310, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:12:18.460 - 01:12:28.902, Speaker C: Honestly, it truly doesn't really have much of a make. They basically try to copy osmosis, build a decks, build a bridge, all this stuff, but they just kind of missed out on liquidity.
01:12:28.966 - 01:12:42.270, Speaker D: I'm curious, actually, to get your thoughts on no, there's like a new Cosmos proposal right now to basically allow people to use existing Cosmos validators so sort of bootstrap their own validator set, which is sort of more polkadot like. What do you think of that?
01:12:42.420 - 01:13:43.230, Speaker C: I think the liquid staking is effectively the easiest way to do that. And that's why I think you're seeing a lot of these chains have these staking derivatives where basically I can pay validators validating another chain in this other chain's coin, which is basically a version of the polkadot crowd loan, except because there's so much liquidity on Cosmos, it's actually easier to bootstrap because it basically will feel like widow to the end user. But I actually think the polkadot crowd loan model is actually very elegant. The problem is it's, like, impossible to bootstrap for this reason. Who wants to pay to use it to start and they have this thing called a crowd loan where basically you pay some portion of your token supply upfront and then people basically fund your wi u with dots. But then again, the dot holder base is not that diversified, so you don't really it's like I think if there were more dot holders who were not super close to the original team, you might have seen more crowd loans.
01:13:43.310 - 01:13:50.438, Speaker B: No, but the flaws that you're describing, now that I know more about Gavin from writing my book, they sort of make sense to me, actually.
01:13:50.524 - 01:13:51.480, Speaker A: What do you mean?
01:13:52.090 - 01:13:56.434, Speaker D: I was going to say you're the Gavin expert here, so you should be telling us about Polkadot.
01:13:56.562 - 01:14:01.702, Speaker B: Well, but from your read of the like, do you agree that it sort of makes sense for his personality?
01:14:01.766 - 01:14:02.134, Speaker D: Totally.
01:14:02.182 - 01:14:02.506, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah.
01:14:02.528 - 01:14:06.140, Speaker D: It's like kind of megalomaniac style. Like, everything has to go through.
01:14:09.470 - 01:14:12.474, Speaker A: So this is the cryptopians. Yeah, it was pretty interesting.
01:14:12.512 - 01:14:27.680, Speaker D: I think there's always these cult of personalities around early crypto people, or crypto people in general. I know a lot of people cite their investment thesis for Polkadot being, oh, well, Gavin, what is the CTO of Ethereum? I'm like, yeah, but what do you know about Gavin beyond what about.
01:14:30.050 - 01:14:48.858, Speaker B: Guys today? I was at the dentist, and when he found out what I did, he engaged me in this kind of long conversation about crypto. And at a certain point, he was like, well, what about Cardano, as he called it? And I was like, oh my God. And then I said to him, I was like, you should read my book. I was like, if you're interested in this, you should read my book. But no, I mean sounds like the.
01:14:48.864 - 01:14:54.620, Speaker A: Worst dentist appointment ever. If my dentist started talking about Cardano, I would not come back.
01:14:55.070 - 01:14:58.650, Speaker C: Dentists are exactly the demographic that Cardano.
01:14:59.790 - 01:15:04.970, Speaker A: The average user of Cardano is a dentist. No average owner user.
01:15:05.410 - 01:15:18.418, Speaker C: Yeah, it's getting some stuff. It is the thing that Nomad is bridging to. They have an EVM chain which is generating almost all the transactions. It's like none of the Cardano native apps are running.
01:15:18.504 - 01:15:18.754, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:15:18.792 - 01:15:20.046, Speaker B: Wow, that's hilarious.
01:15:20.158 - 01:15:24.546, Speaker A: Gavin does have a lot in common with Dom from definitive. I feel like it's very yes.
01:15:24.648 - 01:15:30.786, Speaker B: Oh, my God, that is such a good call. I never thought of so I mean, that's the thing.
01:15:30.808 - 01:15:34.178, Speaker A: It's like everything in crypto that works has been very grassroots.
01:15:34.354 - 01:15:34.838, Speaker B: Right?
01:15:34.924 - 01:15:41.050, Speaker A: Well, that's not true. That's not true. Not everything. Most things in crypto, well, bitcoin Ethereum. Yeah.
01:15:41.120 - 01:15:43.254, Speaker C: Solana probably is like biggest exception.
01:15:43.302 - 01:15:49.974, Speaker A: Solana, I think Avalanche is also less grassroots. I think Terra obviously, Terra is like the least grassroots.
01:15:50.022 - 01:15:52.540, Speaker B: Yeah. But I consider all of those, like, new and not.
