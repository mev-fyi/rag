00:00:00.280 - 00:00:32.130, Speaker A: I don't think we're going to see the same level of selling in Ethi that we saw for GPTC. So Ethi and Grayscale are working on their mini Ethereum trust, which it basically is going to spin out 10% of ETH into this trust. We don't have the fees yet. It's going to be really low. And I think it could happen right around when these things actually launch. So it could be coming next week, because basically they have a record date for when these things would be spun off as of today or sometime this week. So it looks like they're going to launch their ETh mini trust and they learn from the mistakes of GBTC.
