And, you know, whether it's, like, fact or, you know, causation or correlation or biases, everyone I've been hearing from on crypto, Twitter, in telegram groups like everybody, is pointing towards the black rock ETF as their motivation for logging bitcoin. And so even if there are other ancillary flows, bitcoin is directly causing people that you see on the Internet to respond with not even necessarily correct assumptions, but to say, well, BlackRock ETF is going to be approved. They're the biggest asset manager on Earth. Bitcoin's worth less than a trillion, and they manage close to $10 trillion. Bitcoin go up, and it's the low IQ response. But there's so many people making.
