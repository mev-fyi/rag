00:00:00.160 - 00:00:02.354, Speaker A: We're just waiting for your second podcast.
00:00:03.214 - 00:00:04.782, Speaker B: My second podcast? What does that mean?
00:00:04.798 - 00:00:08.950, Speaker A: What's that? Yeah, the one focused on prison reform.
00:00:09.102 - 00:00:17.654, Speaker B: Criminal justice reform. Yeah, yeah, that's right. That's right. We'll do the after hours. If you stick around after the show, I'll do a extra segment on that. Anyway, call it the prison block.
00:00:17.814 - 00:00:18.358, Speaker A: All right.
00:00:18.446 - 00:00:19.278, Speaker B: The prison block.
00:00:19.366 - 00:00:20.074, Speaker C: Oh.
00:00:22.374 - 00:00:23.398, Speaker B: Not a dividend.
00:00:23.486 - 00:00:24.606, Speaker A: It's a tale of Tuqwan.
00:00:24.670 - 00:00:27.374, Speaker B: Now. Your losses are on someone else's balance sheet.
00:00:27.454 - 00:00:29.878, Speaker D: Generally speaking, air drops are kind of pointless anyways.
00:00:30.046 - 00:00:32.822, Speaker B: I named trading firms who are very involved.
00:00:32.918 - 00:00:35.470, Speaker A: Alec ETH is the ultimate Defi.
00:00:35.502 - 00:00:37.994, Speaker C: Protocols are the antidote to this problem.
00:00:38.654 - 00:00:48.514, Speaker B: Hello, everybody. Welcome to the chopping block. Every couple weeks, the four of us get together and give the industry insiders perspective on the crypto topics of the day. So quick intros. First, you got Tom, the Defi maven and master of memes.
00:00:48.854 - 00:00:49.834, Speaker A: Hello, everyone.
00:00:50.814 - 00:00:53.990, Speaker B: Next, we've got Robert, the crypto connoisseur and czar of Superstate.
00:00:54.142 - 00:00:55.154, Speaker C: Aloha.
00:00:55.734 - 00:00:58.994, Speaker B: And we've got Tarun, the Giga brain and grand poobah at gauntlet.
00:00:59.814 - 00:01:02.194, Speaker A: Yo, my intro was sniped.
00:01:03.414 - 00:01:05.750, Speaker B: It was sniped. Oh, you're the aloha.
00:01:05.902 - 00:01:07.142, Speaker A: I usually say aloha.
00:01:07.238 - 00:01:13.606, Speaker B: Oh, damn. Okay. All right. Nicely done, nicely done. You could see the head hype man at Dragonfly. No good, guys. No front running on the show.
00:01:13.606 - 00:01:37.602, Speaker B: Come on, let's keep it clean. We are early stage investors in crypto, but I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice, legal advice, or even life advice. Please see chopping block that XYZ for more disclosures. So, boys, we got another week of the crypto bull market. Today was notable, and we'll be talking about this a lot today. It was the launch of a token called Athena, which we've talked about on the show previously. I think we had a bit of a snip back and forth about it.
00:01:37.602 - 00:02:03.580, Speaker B: Dragonfly, we are big investors in Athena. We led their seed round. We also invested a ton of their series a, so we own a lot of this token. Token has come out at a crazy high price. But those of you who are not in the know, you may have seen Arthur Hayes going out, talking about how amazing Athena is. Athena has grown to, what are they sitting like? 1.5 billion of the token circulating, or, sorry, of the stable coin that's circulating valuation?
00:02:03.652 - 00:02:05.324, Speaker D: Synthetic dollar. Not a staple.
00:02:05.364 - 00:02:07.092, Speaker B: Synthetic. I'm sorry. Synthetic dollar. Sorry.
00:02:07.148 - 00:02:07.460, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:02:07.532 - 00:02:08.548, Speaker C: You should know.
00:02:08.716 - 00:02:09.500, Speaker B: I should know, yeah.
00:02:09.532 - 00:02:15.308, Speaker A: I mean, of all things, of all things to mess up after that debate last time.
00:02:15.436 - 00:02:35.094, Speaker B: I'm moving. I'm moving quick through the notes. I'm moving quick to the notes. Okay, so, anyway, uh, it's sitting right now at, uh, something like 12 billion fully diluted valuation. Billion dollars was airdrop today, I think. Robert, you said you were a proud recipient, uh, of the airdrop this morning, uh, for at least a couple hours. Um, but, uh, there's been a lot of drama about Athena.
00:02:35.094 - 00:03:04.856, Speaker B: So, although its token has launched today, uh, there's a big fight taking place in defi that is being called a defi civil war over Athena. So let's talk a little bit about what's going on. Um, it's. There's a lot of details here about what's exactly happening, and so I thought, Robert, you might be the best person to kind of parse and explain the story, but. So it starts with Makerdao integrating Athena, and we talked a little bit about this last time, and now it's extending into Ave having a response to what's happening at Maker. So, Robert, can you walk us through what happened exactly with Athena?
00:03:05.000 - 00:03:05.256, Speaker A: Sure.
00:03:05.280 - 00:03:18.366, Speaker C: So I'll try to take this from, like, a 90,000 foot view, and you guys can all jump in with more details and facts and your understanding of the situation. So one of the things that Athena has done successfully is, by the way.
00:03:18.390 - 00:03:22.194, Speaker B: Let'S also start with a recap of what is Athena for the uninformed.
00:03:22.614 - 00:03:22.974, Speaker A: Sure.
00:03:23.014 - 00:03:24.034, Speaker C: That's all on you.
00:03:24.414 - 00:03:44.754, Speaker B: Okay, so, Athena. Athena. The simplest way to understand Athena is that it's a tokenized cash and carry trade. The idea is you take ether, you hold ether on spot, and then you short the futures or the perpetual swaps. This is known as a cash and carry trade. Basically means you're delta neutral. So you're, in theory, not taking price risk, you're only taking counterparty risk.
00:03:44.754 - 00:04:09.106, Speaker B: And there's obviously a couple of other risks that are in the interim of where you find liquidity and how you rebalance across different markets. But more or less, that's the idea. It's a tokenized cash and carry trade. So you can deposit, instead of holding ether, they hold staked ether, and so they give the cash and carry trade yield, as well as the staked ether yield. And some of this yield goes into an insurance pool. But that's more or less how it works. It's a token.
00:04:09.106 - 00:04:13.704, Speaker B: You can buy it to essentially get the yield from that tokenized cash and carry trade.
00:04:14.244 - 00:05:21.848, Speaker C: Okay, so given that there's a synthetic dollar, not a stable coin, as some would say that Athena created. What they've done is they've been incentivizing people to mint, hold, and defy these USD tokens in various different DeFi protocols. So there have been a couple major, like, early incentives that ran for the first airdrop campaign, including curve, pendle, morpho, gearbox, things like this. And it was incredibly successful. So what people did was they minted tons of USD, they used it in these respective protocols, and they got points, shards, tokens, whatever you want to call them, in Athena's airdrop. And they were heavily incentivized to use these friendly peer DeFi protocols because they super juiced the incentives to use these protocols. So if you used curve, you got like 15 times as many tokens as if you just held USD.
00:05:21.848 - 00:06:32.384, Speaker C: So what's happened today is they airdropped the token. Everybody. The Internet celebrated, and then they began season two, so to speak, of their airdrop campaign. And Makerdao as a part of this, you know, like all of the 36 hours ago or 24 hours ago at this point, announced that they were going to be massively increasing the use of UsTE and staked USD in Morfo to borrow Dai. And I'll unpack the exact mechanics here for anyone who's already confused, because there's too many things flying across. But Morpho allows different teams to create white labeled single asset borrowing pools. Makerdao has these borrowing pools that they've created where users can use USDe as collateral, where s USD is collateral and borrow daisy and the Makerdao ecosystem slash dao protocol mints, those dai for users to borrow.
00:06:32.384 - 00:07:04.398, Speaker C: So they're basically acting like a central bank or a commercial bank when they're doing lending, which increases the money supply. Makerdao is minting new Dai for people to borrow through Morpho. So it's collateralized by people's Athena assets. And Makerdao is letting people borrow die indirectly through Morpho. And over the last couple of days was, this was very successful. There was an upper bound of $100 million of die that could be borrowed because of the incentives that Athena laid out. This flew off the shelves.
00:07:04.398 - 00:07:35.566, Speaker C: Everybody pumped as much Athena coins as they could into morpho, borrowed. All the die out. And interest rates in Morpho have been like anywhere from like 30% to 80% to borrow dai. If youre Makerdao, this is a wonderful thing. People are literally paying maker Dow 80% to borrow Dai collateralized by a synthetic dollar, which is generally pretty stable. And so for Makerdao this has been so far. Its a very short period of time.
00:07:35.566 - 00:08:17.756, Speaker C: Theres a lot of risks. Its hard to say whether its sustainable all these things. Dot, dot, dot, Makerdao has benefited tremendously from this. And it looks like an incredible new revenue stream for Makerdao. And so Makerdao put out a proposal today to raise the limit to a billion dollars, starting with only $600 million of actual DAI issuance, but allowing there to be a billion dollars of dai minted for people to borrow using Athena synthetic dollar collateral. And this immediately set off a lot of debate on the Internet. There's a lot of folks who were pro Makerdao on this.
00:08:17.756 - 00:09:22.334, Speaker C: They think it's like the greatest thing for Makerdao possible. If people are going to borrow a billion dollars from Makerdao at 30% to 80% interest rates, Makerdao is going to make a lot of money. And then there's a counter reaction from other protocols that feel left out or feel, you know, neglected or it's hard to describe. But, you know, this immediately set off a chain reaction, specifically with the Aave protocol that began the process to delist die, citing the fact that they believe that Dai, because of this billion dollar mint, was too risky for Ave to support as collateral, as well as the announced interest in delisting the asset entirely. And so this is a huge event to occur in the span of a day. Crypto, Twitter has been abuzz talking about what this means, why it's happening, where everyone goes from here, and it's setting off fireworks. And so we'd love to hear from you all.
00:09:22.334 - 00:09:24.778, Speaker C: What do you think of these fireworks?
00:09:24.946 - 00:10:32.284, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, sure, I think there's a very frank discussion, and I think the Makerdao forums actually a pretty good recap of the risks involved with Athena that have been, I think, discussed kind of ad nauseam at this point. I think the point that I think Mark Zeller from Aave was making, too, is more around kind of the way in which this happened and the speed. It's one thing to add a new collateral type that is maybe a different risk profile than other types of collateral, but it's the fact that it's happening so quickly and also, I mean, this happened right after the huge maker interest rate hike. And so it feels like maker is moving very quickly. And I think Aave feels, hey, maybe there's more risk accruing here than we're comfortable underwriting. I do think there's also probably this, like, additional subtext of, you know, Aave is obviously also trying to get go its own stablecoin off the ground and bigger. And so effectively sort of subsidizing dai on AAve through the merit program is sort of counterproductive to the growth of go.
00:10:32.284 - 00:10:55.210, Speaker D: And then obviously, there's this other sort of subtext here, which is like, Gauntlet obviously recently broke up with Aave, but then Gauntlet also has pools on morphe blue, different product, and sort of a different. Not exactly directly competitive, but it feels like there's sort of different factions of the Defi ecosystem right now taking a different line, a different sort of perspective on what's happening.
00:10:55.362 - 00:11:01.694, Speaker B: So, Tarun, you were called out. You were also very critical of Athena in the previous show. What's your take on this whole drama?
00:11:02.554 - 00:11:16.778, Speaker A: I mean, I don't think I change any views I have on the risk. I generally think the insurance fund's still underfunded, but I do think that the, uh. You know, now that I'm, uh. Maybe.
00:11:16.826 - 00:11:18.106, Speaker B: Maybe, maybe can.
00:11:18.210 - 00:11:36.666, Speaker A: Can say somewhat more, uh, things on the aave side, I would say that it's kind of irrational to be like, we're going to remove all of Dai, while also listing SUSD, amongst other thing. Like, there's. There's a whole. They're susde. Sorry. Uh, it's so. It's.
00:11:36.666 - 00:12:00.622, Speaker A: It's like, there's definitely a lot of beef between Ave and Morpho. I think it's. The French Defi community seems to have no ability to have any pleasantries with each other. They all just are, like, fucking have daggers out to stab each other, every single one of them. And that's my historical interactions with that entire french defi community somehow, is. There's. There's a lot of beef.
00:12:00.622 - 00:12:18.224, Speaker A: There's just a lot of. I don't. I don't know exactly why it is. It seems very unique to them. If I were to write an anthropology of Defi, I think they would get a chapter. If it was like Les Mis, where there's like a chapter for, like, every little subculture involved, they could. They definitely get their own.
00:12:18.224 - 00:12:58.664, Speaker A: So there's a lot of beef there. If you look at the merit program that was mentioned, it purposely singles out Morpho and Spark, which is sort of a makerdao subdao, which was an aave fork. There's been a lot of beef in the forums between maker and aave for a while. Obviously, go has had tremendous problems with its peg. So there's always been some kind of people feeling bad about that. But I would say the beef aspect, the personal beef aspect is actually the thing shining through here, not some rational risk making procedure. And that personally.
00:13:00.754 - 00:13:03.254, Speaker B: You think the riskiness of this is not a big deal.
00:13:03.714 - 00:14:20.634, Speaker A: Well, no, no. I still think Athena still has these risks, but I think the idea of, like, suddenly listing SUSD and then saying Dai is going LTV is going to zero. Now, obviously, the LTV liquidation threshold difference is something worth keeping in mind, but not worth bringing up on the show, but the idea that it's somehow worth going to zero, but you're listening to the same thing and doing. There's a lot of inconsistencies. It's certainly not coming from a rigorous sense. And, you know, I would not necessarily say the counterpart involved as being particularly rational in Zeller, but, you know, not that that's been historically forever, but I would say that, yeah, like, sure, there is definitely increased risk if you're like, there's a systematically lowering in some manner that's consistent with how much you're increasing it with SVSD, you would make much more sense than doing the zero, the removing it from merit. So merit is the thing, again, to ensure that no TVL goes to Morpho, there's a bunch of extra protocol rewards that get paid to users who don't use other lending protocols.
00:14:20.634 - 00:14:35.014, Speaker A: And I would say that, yeah, don't underestimate how much beef can be a driver of these things, regardless of how much people sugarcoat their public writings.
00:14:35.354 - 00:15:27.460, Speaker B: Yeah, I would say, Tarun, you're being surprisingly subtle in your responses here, but I guess, let me say a couple of things that this whole situation has made me think. So. One is that with respect to Makerdao, this is what many people have always wanted Makerdao to start doing, which is take advantage of the fact that you are the central bank of crypto, and that should afford you the right to monetize the fact that you're the central bank of crypto, especially in a bull market. And this is kind of what that looks like, which is, look, we have the ability to basically be the most trusted collateral anywhere in the world, and we can effectively transform low quality collateral into high quality collateral. Right. Like, not everybody is ready to take, um, you know, a synthetic dollar as a form of payment or whatever. But if you can collateral, if you can basically put that down as collateral and borrow die.
00:15:27.460 - 00:15:42.456, Speaker B: Amazing. That is a basically, you know, transforming less liquid, less accepted collateral into more liquid, more accepted collateral. And you should get paid for that. And that's what maker is doing. They're saying, how much can I get paid? Oh, wow. I can get paid, you know, 60% annualized and get points and get this and get that.
00:15:42.540 - 00:15:42.776, Speaker A: Awesome.
00:15:42.800 - 00:16:18.364, Speaker B: I'm going to go do that. So I think that's part of the reason why on a day when the market is actually down across the board, maker's up. Despite the fact that today is the day that this civil war, quote, unquote, has begun, and Avi's talking about delisting maker, it's not the principal reason why maker is maker. So that's one thing, is I think it's a step in the right direction for Maker. Now, we talked last time about the whole end game plan and all the other stuff that they're doing, which, whatever the market seems to enjoy the direction that maker is taking on that side, but just from the pure fundamentals of being more aggressive on interest rates and being more opportunistic.
00:16:18.524 - 00:16:18.916, Speaker A: Right.
00:16:18.980 - 00:16:38.824, Speaker B: The idea for makerdao is that the only reason why you should be taking more risk is if there's commensurate reward. And in this case, like you said, Robert, making 60% annualized, that's a pretty great reward. That sounds like worth taking some instrumental or some, some incremental, idiosyncratic risk. Yeah. Through. Yes, holding a tokenized cash and carry trade.
00:16:40.124 - 00:17:00.140, Speaker A: The other thing I think that crypto Twitter clearly didn't bother reading. You know, the makerdao posts was. It's not like they're just like, putting everything all at once. Right? They're, they're, they're doing it kind of incrementally and, like, everyone treated it as if it was this. No, no, it. I agree that it's like, it's, it's a ten x step. Right.
00:17:00.140 - 00:17:01.748, Speaker A: So it's like, kind of large.
00:17:01.836 - 00:17:06.028, Speaker B: Well, they're starting with, they do have the ability to go up to a. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:17:06.116 - 00:17:20.464, Speaker A: But they have, like, thresholds. They're being much more rational than, like, we're just going to delist. Right. I think, like, one side is at least reading numbers, the other side is reading their social media or something.
00:17:21.484 - 00:17:39.644, Speaker B: Well, I think Evgeny from Wintermute had a good take where he, like you were saying, tarun. So it was like, in his timeline, right above was stani celebrating like, oh, yeah, we finally integrated UsDe. And that's great. Let's have this go through. And the next line, it's like, okay, we're gonna do this. Die. Die is trash.
00:17:39.644 - 00:17:45.312, Speaker B: So it is a bit of an overreaction, I think, to say the least. But I guess what it also underscores.
00:17:45.328 - 00:18:25.170, Speaker A: For me, I remember, don't forget. One other thing that's a historical thing to remember is the makerdao lending facility, the D three M. It initially was really, the majority of it was really used in Aave for a long time, and there was disputes over that historically of like, how that allocation happened. And I think the DeFi protocols may be memoryless yield emitting objects, but people in DeFi governance do not have, unfortunately, are not memoryless markers.
00:18:25.202 - 00:18:29.302, Speaker B: They are very not memorable, unfortunately. That's right. That's right. No, it's a little bit of an.
00:18:29.358 - 00:19:01.242, Speaker A: E three M stuff was very, you know, back when Defi was much smaller, it was very, very contentious, and everyone was trying to get some allocation to their protocol. I don't know if you remember all the YouTube videos of people going into the maker chats trying to pitch getting an allocation. So there's a lot of stuff hidden in this, probably not even that interesting in some ways, because it's, again, just people who have personal beef with each other. But don't underestimate that.
00:19:01.378 - 00:19:41.014, Speaker B: The interesting dynamic, right. The interesting dynamic here is that I remember we were talking before about sushi, I think, previous show. And one of the things that sushi did that a lot of other protocols didn't do was they kind of went horizontal, or you could say they verticalized. I don't know how you want to call it, but let's say verticalized is they basically launched many different applications within the same brand. And everyone was kind of wondering, I remember we were talking about at that time of like, oh, why isn't uniswap doing this? Why aren't other people launching a bunch of stuff? And eventually they did, but many, many years later. And I think in the early days of Defi, there was this kind of kumbaya energy that people kind of assumed, like, oh, you know, we're all part of the same movement. Everything's open source.
00:19:41.014 - 00:20:15.898, Speaker B: Like, we're all going to be friends, and we're now seeing like, look, when you do verticalize and you decide like, hey, you know what? Facebook's going to have an identity solution, but Google's also going to have one. And then we're going to have a marketplace, but you're also going to have a marketplace. We're gonna have a mapping service, but so is apple. And, and you start realizing that, like, actually we are now competing in more and more dimensions. And this, um, sort of patina of, oh, we're all friends and everyone, we're all in it for the love and, you know, whatever you know, it's all positive sum. Um, it starts to go away at a certain scale and at a certain kind of breadth of different functions that you're doing.
00:20:15.946 - 00:20:18.514, Speaker A: A certain amount of yield at size.
00:20:18.674 - 00:20:24.014, Speaker B: A certain amount of yield, niceties go away, a certain intensity of the bull market. And yes, the nice thing is going.
00:20:24.054 - 00:20:36.154, Speaker A: To be finance, though. This is not just true in crypto. Yeah, I think, like, a lot of early finance things, like, always have this, like, it's a club, and then once someone starts making money, it turns into knife fight.
00:20:37.614 - 00:21:03.062, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that is, that is a large part of it, right? Like, is that there's only so much, you know, Morpho is obviously growing and getting a lot of attention, and that that's causing knives to come out. Usde is growing, causing knives to come out. And not everybody can win to the same amount in a bull market like this. And I think that my guess would be that's driving a lot of it. No one will ever admit that that's what's driving it. Right. And maybe no one even feels like that's what's driving it.
00:21:03.062 - 00:21:28.724, Speaker B: Maybe their lived experience is like, no, no, no, it's this, this slight is the thing that's causing me to do this, and they just lost my trust and blah, blah, blah. And I don't doubt it, but I think the, under the shakespearean drama of it, I think it really does just come down to incentives and the fact that we're not in defi summer anymore. And there's not just this, like, well, every time the Defi meme gets bigger, all tokens are worth more. I think the market is really being much more discriminating.
00:21:29.424 - 00:22:22.654, Speaker A: And there have been very few people who have successfully gone horizontal in multiple categories while also maintaining the same market share across categories. Right. And I think the problem is the expectation when you're successful in one category and have market share x is that, oh, like, obviously, as a founder, you have to have the delusion, which is a fair delusion, otherwise you wouldn't even try doing it. They're like, oh, it's going to be easy to just expand to this and create the same market share, create the same effect. And that's just not, these things are all, they have microstructure nuances that market participant nuances, math nuances, and like, I think if you maybe didn't, you got market share for all the reasons that weren't the, like the subset. And then you move to another thing where, like, all the market share comes from exactly the reasons you're bad at or the things you're not good at. You know, you're.
00:22:22.654 - 00:22:41.734, Speaker A: You may set yourself up expectation wise in a way that doesn't work. You know, like, I feel like it does. Remind me about the early social. No, no, I'm just giving a general. I gave you a general statement about arbitrary. Arbitrary sector growth. Not necessarily any particular products that are being named.
00:22:41.734 - 00:23:18.804, Speaker A: I just am pointing out that there's this expectation mismatch that happens, and it reminds me a little bit, although maybe the stakes are a lot lower, not a lot lower, but definitely lower, of the early social network days, when it was everyone and their mom who had a random tech company would either quit and start a social network, or it was. Google tried to make you remember that abhorrent circles thing. They made that, like, social network like no one used. There was kind of this, like, same Google. Right. That was. I just remember the circles, Google.
00:23:18.804 - 00:24:00.034, Speaker A: But, but like. But, like, there was this whole thing, whereas, like, all these people were like, oh, Facebook had this success, we're gonna try to get into it. And then, like, all of them, like, none of them were able to meet their expectations. And I will say one of the things that you have to give Zak Gelato credit for is he's one of the few people who can actually say he expanded into new verticals within social and kept his market share at the same amount, which is astonishing. That's extremely hard to do, and I think in crypto, that's even way harder to do because the barriers to entry are so much lower in terms of building a network effect or losing a network effect.
00:24:01.654 - 00:24:45.646, Speaker B: Yeah, very true. I mean, that's one of the things I think that Makerdao has done right, which is staying pretty compact and just being really, really good at the thing that they do, and that builds trust. And ultimately, for a Defi central bank, that's the number one thing that matters, that people trust you. And I think, look, I do agree directionally with some of the concerns of, you know, saying, hey, this is kind of a big growth in the total exposure to Athena, and maybe they should have tempered it a little bit more, gone a little bit slower, maybe even in absolute terms. I think if you read the governance thread, I think they make a good point that, like, look, the risk of loss is actually pretty low. And, like, you know, if you model out how much you lose, like, this is not going to be 100% wipeout situation. This is like, oh, maybe 20%, 15%.
00:24:45.646 - 00:25:27.378, Speaker B: And so there's a lot of situations where actually the risk level for the reward you're getting is pretty reasonable. But I think the optics of it matter just as much as the reality of it matters. And so optically, I think maybe they should have been able to foresee that, hey, this would have caused people to be a bit jumpy, especially after the sudden rake hike. But overall, I think regardless of how we got here, it seems like we probably would have ended in the same place, which is that it feels like battle lines have been drawn. And, you know, it sort of seems like the market is also reflecting maker doesn't need to be or, sorry, Dai doesn't need to be an aave for Dai to be die. Otherwise, of course, you'd see the market respond.
00:25:27.426 - 00:25:51.876, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I mean, I'm going to be honest. If I was someone who was like personally very interested in ever making an algorithmic stablecoin, which I find scary, that's like the worst product. It's the most levy synthetic dollar. No, no, that's a hedgehog. Let's be real. But, but, but the, the, I'm talking about real algorithmic stable coin like maker. Uh oh.
00:25:51.900 - 00:25:52.704, Speaker B: Okay.
00:25:54.444 - 00:26:37.138, Speaker A: I think, I don't know why you would want to fight in the maker battlefield. I think you're better off trying to go to like SVM or move or somewhere where there just isn't any and there's a ton of collateral earning no yield. Like, why, why try to, like, I feel, I feel like that's the thing I don't understand about these expansion things, is like everyone wants to expand in like the same field, but there's all these fields with tons of collateral that is sitting there either staked or like not doing anything. And like, yeah, this is like a good liquidity transformation type of story. And it's just like mind boggling to me. We haven't seen like maker and other ecosystems yet. Like, I think what is the collateral.
00:26:37.186 - 00:26:39.654, Speaker B: Ratio you would set for geo bowdoin?
00:26:40.074 - 00:27:10.174, Speaker A: Who care? But who cares? On, like sweer, right? Yeah, on SWI or. On SWI or Aptos at two x, people would still do it because they're sitting on a ton of stake apdos or Sui and the market caps are sufficiently high, like on the l one s. It actually does make sense. And yet instead we see like 500 clones on EVM chains instead of. I've never understood this dynamic of the wanting to stay in the same ecosystem because I actually think you run into this problem we're talking about.
00:27:10.514 - 00:28:10.674, Speaker D: Yeah, I think weirdly, the threat to dealist Dai also underscores the strength of morpho in comparison. And that you have these sort of one time deploy no governance isolated lending pools that can't be delisted once they're live. It's like a uniswap pool, and you just use it forever to worry about someone coming in and revoking your access to borrow. I think going back to what you were saying around these sort of vertical integrations, I think one thing, actually, I think that maker has done well, which has kind of gotten under appreciated, is spitting out their products to sort of stand on their own merit and have their own brands and summer and spark, and they're largely pretty successful, and they haven't tried to make it all the maker ecosystem, and it's all sort of the same team doing the same things. It's these, you have dedicated individual teams working as individual products within individual brands, even though they're obviously all sort of tied back to make her and die in some way.
00:28:11.134 - 00:28:20.366, Speaker B: Cool. All right. I think we've probably lost a lot of the audience with this very deep dive into defi squabbles. So let's move on to more.
00:28:20.390 - 00:28:40.660, Speaker A: This is going to be the type of audience episode we get a lot of angry tweets or Farcaster casts, actually. I've noticed engagement, by the way. Something funny to know. I get way more engagement on Farcaster about people casting, about chopping block episodes. It's actually astonishing that the three of you have such low far caster followings. I don't have any.
00:28:40.692 - 00:28:42.292, Speaker B: I've yet to sign up. I'm not even on.
00:28:42.348 - 00:28:46.304, Speaker A: That's what I'm saying. But there are, there are a lot of listeners on Farcaster.
00:28:47.324 - 00:28:49.892, Speaker B: Uh, Tom, are you, are you live on Farcaster again?
00:28:50.068 - 00:28:55.664, Speaker D: I am on Farcaster, although I'm, uh, consuming. I am not casting very frequently.
00:28:56.284 - 00:28:58.308, Speaker A: I like to call it being a leech.
00:28:58.476 - 00:28:59.264, Speaker B: Okay.
00:29:00.484 - 00:29:02.844, Speaker A: That's like the old school, you know, like.
00:29:03.004 - 00:29:50.298, Speaker B: Yeah, that's like the Bittorrent terminology. Yeah, exactly. Okay. All right, well, speaking of being a leech, let's talk about the SPF case. So SPF was just sentenced. Very magical moment where SPF's mother, who, those of you maybe read some of the books, you might recall his mother is a philosopher who was, I guess, famous at Stanford for her endorsement of utilitarianism, which surprised me, figures prominently in the story of SPF. So she wrote in a note to the judge, which was roundly criticized by many people, she wrote that SPF never intended to commit harm and that he was an awkward math nerd.
00:29:50.298 - 00:30:19.632, Speaker B: Who loved video game and animals, so tried to portray him as being a very altruistic person. It talked about how the fact that he was still vegan in prison, which shows his moral commitment, and he lost 30 pounds and didn't even complain to any of the prison guards about losing weight. So this didn't fly particularly well with the judge. The judge in sentencing said Sam never showed a word of remorse. He knew it was wrong. He knew it was criminal. He regrets that he made a very bad bet about the likelihood of getting caught.
00:30:19.632 - 00:30:49.582, Speaker B: There is a risk that this man will be in a position to do something really bad in the future. And it's not a trivial risk. The judgment has to accurately reflect the seriousness of the crime, and this was a very serious crime. So he says that the 105 years that were recommended by the probation department and by the prosecutor, 40, 50 years, was more than necessary. He says the judge continued, I am not diminishing the harm, the brazenness of his actions, his exceptional flexibility with the truth, his apparent lack of any remorse. I want to add one further thought. I did not think it a fruitful use of time to spell out every lie.
00:30:49.582 - 00:31:22.794, Speaker B: When not lying, he was evasive, hairsplitting, trying to get the prosecutors to rephrase questions for him. I've been doing this job for close to 30 years. I've never seen a performance like that. He ended up sentencing SPF to 25 years in prison because it is a federal sentence, the overwhelming likelihood you'll serve at least 80% of that time. So almost certainly at least 20 years that he'll be serving in prison, assuming that there's no appeal. So what are you guys thoughts on the sentence as we're finally kind of at the end of the line? Just for comparison, for those sentences for white collar crimes? So I believe.
00:31:25.934 - 00:31:26.286, Speaker A: Shoot.
00:31:26.310 - 00:31:27.534, Speaker B: Who's the Ponzi skin guy?
00:31:27.694 - 00:31:28.766, Speaker C: Bernie Madoff.
00:31:28.910 - 00:31:44.994, Speaker B: Bernie Madoff. Bernie Madoff got 140 years. Jordan Belfort served 22 months for. He's the wolf of Wall Street. Guy Boesky served three years for insider trading. Elizabeth Holmes, ascendance to eleven years for her fraud. What do you guys think? SPF, 25 years?
00:31:45.734 - 00:32:18.282, Speaker C: I would say in all, just on a relative basis, it seems generally correct when you frame it against, like, Jordan Belfort and these people that were committing lots of scams and lots of fraud, getting very light sentences going up to Bernie Madoff, who vaporized $60 billion of money that didn't belong to him, getting the rest of his life in prison, Elizabeth Holmes did about, what was it like $8 billion of fraud, right?
00:32:18.338 - 00:32:20.882, Speaker B: Depends on how you count. I mean, the company was worth 8 billion.
00:32:20.938 - 00:32:37.174, Speaker C: 8 billion, yeah, fine. She made a fake $8 billion in market cap. SPF made a fake $35 billion in market cap of his company. You know, I view him as being roughly four times as bad as her. That's maybe there.
00:32:38.234 - 00:32:38.682, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:32:38.738 - 00:32:42.810, Speaker C: You know, and so, you know, I think there are, like, diminishing marginal returns.
00:32:42.842 - 00:32:49.194, Speaker B: What do you, what do you make of the fact that there now looks like there's going to be a full recovery of FTX assets? Do you think that should change? Speaker one?
00:32:49.194 - 00:33:41.280, Speaker C: No, I think, you know, the prosecution actually phrased us incredibly well in some of the summary I read, which is, you know, if you steal a bunch of money from people, take it to Vegas, and you happen to win and then pay them back, you still stole their money and you still committed a crime. It doesn't matter, you know, what the outcome of the crime is. It matters the process that you went and you mugged them, you took their money, and yes, you might have happened to get lucky. It wouldn't be worse of a crime, necessarily, if you went to Vegas, lost all the money and they had less recovery. Like, the recovery amount doesn't really change the nature of the fact that he very purposefully stole billions of dollars for his uses. And, like, it's nice, it's good for the victims that they are getting a recovery. And I make sure everyone hears this.
00:33:41.280 - 00:33:46.656, Speaker C: A recovery of a very low value of crypto assets.
00:33:46.840 - 00:33:48.524, Speaker A: Yeah, that you're.
00:33:50.464 - 00:34:03.048, Speaker C: Like, every time anyone says they're getting a full recovery, like, you need to remind yourself they're getting their 2022 value of bitcoin and crypto back, which was at the end, all were at the lows, and they were.
00:34:03.136 - 00:34:04.684, Speaker B: Low because of the.
00:34:05.784 - 00:34:21.164, Speaker C: Exactly. So they are not feeling like they're made whole. Like, anyone who lost a bitcoin and FTX is getting back, like, the equivalent of, like, 0.3 bitcoin. Like, they don't feel whole. And everybody on FTX was using crypto, so everyone is a loser. Still.
00:34:21.164 - 00:34:55.364, Speaker C: It doesn't matter that, like, you talk about it in dollarized, like, as of when FTX failed, like, they get that amount of money back. Like, no one feels happy getting back, you know, $17,000 per bitcoin or whatever it was. So people aren't made whole. That's yet another sleight of hand from the defense and from SBF and his team. Like, I think the sentence is generally fair. You know, I think he's one of the biggest criminals in the history of finance. He's definitely the biggest criminal in the history of our industry.
00:34:55.364 - 00:35:03.064, Speaker C: And, you know, we won't be seeing him for some time. I am afraid he's going to launch some shitcoin in, like, 20 years.
00:35:05.124 - 00:35:19.228, Speaker B: That would be very. I think if he did, he would probably deserve some reward for being that committed, that 20 years later he launches a meme coin. I would buy it. Tarun, what's your take on the sentence?
00:35:19.396 - 00:36:06.632, Speaker A: I think an interesting thing is everyone I know who had money at FTX, who significant amounts of money, save a million or more, 10 million or more, something like that. I think the trial was way too light and, like, he should have gotten max sentence. Everyone who I know who's, like, works at anthropic, EA sympathizer thinks it was too harsh and should have been five years. And the funny thing is, the average of the two, like, if I average the two estimates and, like, comes out to the 25. So that's just my sort of statistical thing that says, like, hey, it seems like it's fair. Like, if you sample enough people, it seems as a bimodal distribution where the people who put 25 are the ones who just don't care that much. And the people who care.
00:36:06.632 - 00:36:30.972, Speaker A: But think about all the defenses, arguments, think it's five, and everyone else thinks it's like, 45 or 50. I don't know. I found that kind of a weird idiosyncrasy that I observed. But, you know, I agree with the judge. I mean, I also think, like, how this is, like, the one, the most erratic court performances in history. I feel. I feel like we got some.
00:36:30.972 - 00:36:58.814, Speaker A: We should all feel a little bit thankful that we got both performance art and a court judgment at the same time. You don't get that very often because, yeah, Sam had no, literally no remorse. I remember reading the testimony during sentencing, and he didn't say sorry once. He didn't even, like, really say, like, oh, I lost. Just kind of like, I made a bad bet. He kept saying that. And, like, the one time you probably should learn how to just say sorry.
00:36:58.814 - 00:37:10.182, Speaker A: You know, it's like, you know, it's like, I remember all those memes right after FTX came out, which would, like, deepfakes of him saying, I'm sorry. And it's like, yeah, they're all deepfakes. He would never have said that.
00:37:10.318 - 00:37:13.514, Speaker D: Yeah, I think the generals. I thought he alluded to the fact that.
00:37:13.864 - 00:37:17.964, Speaker C: No, he said, like, I was the CEO, and therefore I'm like, yeah.
00:37:20.944 - 00:37:22.920, Speaker A: Fucking sorry, right?
00:37:22.952 - 00:37:23.352, Speaker C: He never.
00:37:23.408 - 00:37:27.992, Speaker A: He never said, like, hey, to my victims. I apologize.
00:37:28.088 - 00:37:33.524, Speaker C: I stole $10 billion from you and did wild stuff with, like, you know.
00:37:34.984 - 00:37:55.654, Speaker A: What he never said at sentencing. At least it's already done. You should, like, you even, like, game, theoretically. I'm like, this is like a stupid move to not do that. But, you know, I think he just has. He really does have no remorse. Like, that sentencing testimony made me just feel like this is a person who's bitter and has no.
00:37:55.774 - 00:38:11.196, Speaker B: Okay, okay, okay. Look, I'm going to read because I actually don't think this is true. I'm going to read. This is from ABC News. These are just some quotes that it kind of peppers throughout this article. So he says, I've heard and seen the despair, frustration, and sense of betrayal from thousands of customers. They deserve to be paid in full at the current price.
00:38:11.196 - 00:38:27.212, Speaker B: That could have happened, and it could. It should happen today. It's excruciating to see them waiting day after day. He felt the pain from co workers as he threw away what they poured their lives into, as their funding turned into nothing but reputational damage. I'm haunted every day by what was lost. I never intended to hurt anyone or take anyone's money, but I was a CEO. I was responsible for what happened to the company.
00:38:27.212 - 00:38:30.076, Speaker B: And if you're responsible, it doesn't matter why it goes bad. I give anything.
00:38:30.100 - 00:38:47.254, Speaker A: But that's different than just saying, like, I'm really sorry. I'm sorry. That's so different emotionally than saying, I'm sorry. Literally. That sounds like chat. GPT is like, how do I write a press release of, like, I fucked up? Like, it literally does not. It doesn't have any emotion in it whatsoever.
00:38:47.254 - 00:38:52.586, Speaker A: And this is a sentencing hearing. Like, that's the only fucking time you're supposed to do that. Yeah.
00:38:52.650 - 00:39:48.034, Speaker D: The judge also mentioned that he, like, perjured himself several times while he was on the stand. So, like, kind of goes back to the idea that just was never able to be straight and own up to it. And I think even, yeah, like, focusing on the loss of his colleagues careers, you know, it's like a big distraction from kind of the core issue here. The letter that his mom wrote was also very telling in some ways of, like, how he was brought up and, like, his mom's sort of molding of him. And it's all about, like, how good Sam is. And the closing line is pretty clutch. I hope for his sake and the sake of the world that he is given that chance to do something useful and so not only are you saving Sam, but you're saving the world by giving him more lenient sentence.
00:39:48.034 - 00:40:02.824, Speaker D: And so, yeah, I just kind of feels like his ego has been built up so much. I think not in a way that maybe comes out explicitly, but in terms of how he thinks about himself and his actions in the world and.
00:40:05.164 - 00:40:05.468, Speaker C: Sort.
00:40:05.476 - 00:40:11.584, Speaker D: Of acting without regard for others around him, even if that isn't something that he would explicitly say.
00:40:12.044 - 00:40:14.004, Speaker B: I'm definitely the odd duck out here.
00:40:14.084 - 00:40:20.504, Speaker A: In that you are also self described EA person here. So let's.
00:40:21.284 - 00:40:51.794, Speaker B: But, I mean, I didn't really have a relationship with Sam, but I guess what I would say is that I think the punishment for Sam has kind of already happened. Hes probably one of the most hated people in America. He has lost all his money. Hes lost his entire reputation. He can never be a company CEO again. More or less. Obviously, the civil charges against him by the SEC are also going to be, would otherwise be significant if had they decided to go through with them, which I assume theyre not, given that hes going to be in prison.
00:40:51.794 - 00:41:00.564, Speaker B: But it just feels like on top of all of that, like locking somebody in a cage for 25 years and he'll be 50 when he gets out.
00:41:02.024 - 00:41:02.728, Speaker A: I don't know.
00:41:02.816 - 00:41:38.792, Speaker B: I don't believe in retributive justice or punitive justice in that kind of way that just kind of locking away somebody and then feeding them through the state. And now he's on all of our dime now because he can't do anything. He can't be productive. He can't make any rights wrong, make any wrongs right. He's just kind of useless. But he still lives on in prison for the next 20 years. And I just kind of feel like, I don't know that, you know, I don't know that it matters so much that the recovery, you know, whatever, the solana went up and anthropic turned out to be a good bet and blah, blah, blah, you know, whatever.
00:41:38.792 - 00:42:11.736, Speaker B: I sort of don't take that into too much consideration, although I think it matters somewhat. But it is a kind of moral luck, essentially, of whether or not you're crazy. Vegas bets turned out to win or lose. But it does seem like it should matter to some degree when you look at the comps, which is the most vc possible thing to say. But if you just look at the examples of Elizabeth Holmes or Boesky or Jordan Belfort, it's just like 25 years. Yeah, the numbers are really big because obviously 25 billion or whatever. Sorry, not 25 10 billion of money that was ostensibly lost because of SPF.
00:42:11.850 - 00:42:12.140, Speaker A: Stolen.
00:42:12.172 - 00:42:14.028, Speaker B: The reason why the numbers are big. Sorry.
00:42:14.156 - 00:42:17.064, Speaker C: Stolen money that is stolen, not lost, stolen.
00:42:17.364 - 00:42:23.068, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. See, again, this is where you're like, there's, you know, to be clear, I.
00:42:23.076 - 00:42:46.888, Speaker B: Mean, but that's true for all little, too. No, no, no. That's true for all these people is that they all committed some kind of crime against people who, you know, whose money, to whom they had no right. But, like, the reason why the numbers are so big for SPF was because crypto is crazy. You know, like, crypto was just a crazy enough industry that it was willing to give $10 billion hyped up on.
00:42:46.936 - 00:43:00.444, Speaker A: I think if he had remorse and. And was an empathetic character in any way, shape or form and then also didn't just, like, lie all the time, he would have got sentenced. That's much more commensurate with the others.
00:43:00.784 - 00:43:01.464, Speaker B: I don't think.
00:43:01.544 - 00:43:05.188, Speaker A: He just did everything possible to shoot himself in the foot. Yeah.
00:43:05.236 - 00:43:16.940, Speaker B: Look, I agree with you that he does not. He's not a sympathetic defendant in any way. He does not play well in front of a judge. But I think that probably would have changed 25 to 20. There's no way, given the severity.
00:43:16.972 - 00:43:23.028, Speaker A: No, I think it would have. I think it would have been like closer to ten to 15. I think ten to 15 if he was a better speaker.
00:43:23.036 - 00:43:44.374, Speaker B: Two, I think the numbers are too big. I think, like, the sentencing guidelines for a crime this, this big just make it almost impossible for a judge to give lower than 20 years. Like, people were. People were projecting. It might be like 50 years. It might be basically life in prison, which, you know, like, look, if you. If you get out at 50, you know, imagine how much society has moved in by the time it's.
00:43:44.374 - 00:43:47.238, Speaker B: It's fucking 2050, you know?
00:43:47.406 - 00:43:47.886, Speaker A: I don't know.
00:43:47.910 - 00:43:53.766, Speaker B: I mean, I just think, like, it's. There's. There's no real winner in this. Like, I think, like, it's not, like, it's not like the people in the recovery.
00:43:53.870 - 00:44:04.484, Speaker A: I feel like you're another 15. Your sort of criticisms are more the criticism of, like, the criminal justice system in the US. They're not necessarily.
00:44:04.904 - 00:44:08.520, Speaker B: It's not really specific to Sam. It's not really about, like, nonviolent, but.
00:44:08.592 - 00:44:29.504, Speaker A: Conditional on being in that environment. In those environments and agreeing to those rules. It's very hard to say that he got, he got the wrong end of sick. Now the rules he's playing by, you can dispute. That's sort of more in the vein of the arguments you're making, but I don't think that conditional on accepting those rules that, like, this was so out of whack.
00:44:29.844 - 00:44:47.724, Speaker D: Yeah, I think it's also, again, it's an optics thing, too. It's Elizabeth Holmes, defrauded investors. They're professional investors. They should have done more diligence than they were supposed to, but that's on them. They fucked up. That was their job to do that. People had their life savings in FTX.
00:44:47.724 - 00:45:09.272, Speaker D: Maybe they shouldn't have, but they did. There are several suicides attributable to people who lost their money in FTX, defrauding everyday mom and pop investors, people who are just trying to trade some crypto or buy a banana. I think it's just a very different case, and obviously, optically, that affects sentencing.
00:45:09.368 - 00:45:16.344, Speaker B: Yeah, you're right. I just don't know that putting somebody in a cage for 20 years does anything to remedy any of that.
00:45:16.384 - 00:45:19.048, Speaker A: But that's a criticism of the system.
00:45:19.136 - 00:45:24.292, Speaker B: That's not a criticism, I'm criticizing the system. Then you're saying that you criticize the system.
00:45:24.298 - 00:45:25.244, Speaker A: Okay, that's fine.
00:45:26.574 - 00:45:32.234, Speaker B: This is like one of the longest sentences for a white collar crime, I think, like, ever.
00:45:32.814 - 00:45:35.030, Speaker C: Well, Bernie Madoff was iron.
00:45:35.062 - 00:45:47.714, Speaker B: Yes. I mean, Bernie Madoff is perhaps the outlier that we're comparing it to, which is also on a very different scale. And over many, many more years, Bernie Madoff was like, his entire life was running this Ponzi scheme.
00:45:48.094 - 00:45:52.194, Speaker A: Arguably, the fact that he did so much in such a short time is worse.
00:45:53.014 - 00:45:54.126, Speaker C: SPF ruined.
00:45:54.190 - 00:46:12.514, Speaker B: But it's like. It's a function of how crazy crypto is. Right? Like, how many normal people otherwise, like, sort of psychologically normal people presented with that dilemma would have also done maybe not exactly what Sam did, but something also fucked up. Right? Like, my point is that, anyway, whatever, I don't want to die.
00:46:12.934 - 00:46:14.990, Speaker A: Sam Bruins, you have died.
00:46:15.182 - 00:46:17.102, Speaker B: Okay. He did, he did.
00:46:17.238 - 00:46:17.774, Speaker A: I agree.
00:46:17.854 - 00:46:25.158, Speaker C: So many lives. Okay. And his sentence is less than, like, the average, like, drug dealer who gets picked up with, like, a bad.
00:46:25.206 - 00:46:25.942, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly.
00:46:25.998 - 00:46:26.670, Speaker C: Okay.
00:46:26.822 - 00:46:32.198, Speaker B: Which is. Which is its own kind of horrible and absolute ridiculous. And like that, in which the US is also an ally.
00:46:32.286 - 00:46:34.394, Speaker A: System criticism. This is a system.
00:46:35.814 - 00:46:38.486, Speaker B: We can criticize the system. It's a podcast.
00:46:38.670 - 00:46:40.822, Speaker A: Sure, sure. But conditional on that system.
00:46:40.958 - 00:46:49.824, Speaker B: The question is, look, conditional on the system. Conditional on the system. I think clearly, if you include in the system sentencing guidelines, then it's clearly fair.
00:46:49.974 - 00:46:50.500, Speaker A: Right?
00:46:50.612 - 00:47:22.454, Speaker B: Sentencing guidelines are very strict around the total amount of economic harm. And this is something that. Who was it? Shkreli. Shkreli was talking about this, about how there's almost no way that he could get below 20 years just because of sentencing guidelines, which are more or less mandatory. If they give him less than that, I think he can get appealed or something. So, yeah, it does seem like there's no way that Sam was gonna get any better than at least 20 years. So 25 years seems like probably middle of the road for what you would expect for Sam to get.
00:47:22.454 - 00:47:39.570, Speaker B: I just object, in general, to, like, these gigantic sentences because, you know, I don't know, like, make him. Make him go work for charity for the rest of his life and pay back the victims. Right. Make him do something. But why would you say, instead, all the american people will pay for his vegan meals for the next 25 years? Yeah.
00:47:39.602 - 00:47:42.306, Speaker C: Make him launch tokens on Solana until he can.
00:47:42.370 - 00:48:01.076, Speaker A: Yeah, I just think. I just. I just think, look, look, if you want to have a podcast where we talk about, you know, prison abolition and. Or bring back indentures, reforming the. Reforming the prison system, that's fine. I just don't think the rest of the crypto podcast is really meant. We're just trying to assess the.
00:48:01.076 - 00:48:08.984, Speaker A: On the system we're in, and I think, you know, most people would agree that this was not an unfair sentencing.
00:48:09.444 - 00:48:15.004, Speaker B: Yeah, look, I. What I would say if, you know, again, not conditional system that we're in, I would say ten years, probably.
00:48:15.044 - 00:48:37.148, Speaker A: Okay, great. But I don't know how much a crypto podcast is going. You know, we'd have to shift our narrative. We're going to start talking about that. And I say this as someone who. Who spends a lot of time donating to nonprofits that try to help people coming out of prison, help them with their parole type of stuff. And, like, for people who are privileged, I can.
00:48:37.148 - 00:48:45.374, Speaker A: And I. Dude, I tell you, like, volunteering at that stuff. I agree with you philosophically, but I don't think that this podcast is the place for it.
00:48:45.714 - 00:49:13.714, Speaker B: Okay, I will just share two cent since you mentioned that. I used to volunteer at this thing called the last mile in SF, which teaches inmates how to code. And, like, literally, if you are. If you are in San Quentin prison, you cannot get unfettered Internet access. What we had to do is we had to download an offline version of GitHub so that people could have access to, like, actual code that they could interact with and search through in order to learn how to code. Like, it's. Prison is just this horrific, stultifying environment for people that.
00:49:13.714 - 00:49:39.082, Speaker B: I just think the way the US does prison is insane, and I think it's horrible for people, and we pay for it with tax. Anyway, whatever. All right, I'm not going to rant. Let's move on. Last story, which I think is interesting. Speaking of prison, there was a hack that took place last week on blast, and this hack was speculated perhaps to have been done by North Korea, which, of course, is, you know, active attack. Pretty good guess by protocols.
00:49:39.082 - 00:49:53.306, Speaker B: Pretty good guess. There's some reason to think that perhaps what happened there was this protocol called Munchables. I don't know, maybe protocol is a strong word. There was an application called Munchables on blast. There were smart contracts. There were smart contracts. Okay, that's even better.
00:49:53.306 - 00:50:15.158, Speaker B: Let's upgrade. That's. Yeah, you could. You could send your money to a place, to a multi sig under the name of Munchables. And apparently they hired a developer who may have been a sleeper agent, sort of fake developer who was actually a plan from North Korea. Now, there's speculation. We don't know whether or not this is what happened, but Zack XPT, who's a well known on chain sleuth, was speculating this may have been what took place for this thing called munchables.
00:50:15.158 - 00:50:45.378, Speaker B: There's a $62 million that was basically hacked, and that was floating around blast and everyone. It was kind of a code red moment. Now, all ended well. The money was returned, and ultimately, everybody, presumably, was made whole, and the attackers did not get away with it. And it's speculated this may be because blast, of course, right now their bridge is relatively centralized. It's not fully automated quite yet, because, of course, if you remember, blast has this native yield. You deposit ether.
00:50:45.378 - 00:51:34.256, Speaker B: They put it into Lido, and there's all this fanciness that's going on in the backend. It was possible, in principle, for them to be able to block withdrawals from the bridge or even do a rollback of the L2 in order to undo the hack. And there was a big debate taking place online, which, thankfully, never actually got down to the wire. But there was this big debate of whether or not blast should, in principle, roll back the chain and or, you know, prevent withdrawals in order to stop this north korean hacker from divesting their 62 million that they stole. And so this. This led to a big online mudslinging conversation. Didn't end up mattering, or at least ostensibly, we didn't end up having to have that conversation, although maybe it was pulled as a negotiating card with the attacker? We don't know, but I wanted to ask the question because the twitter conversation stopped.
00:51:34.256 - 00:51:43.576, Speaker B: But I don't think, I thought it was so fascinating that I wanted to hear your guys take on this question. Let's say we rewind the clock back about a week. In the middle of the hack should blast.
00:51:43.640 - 00:51:46.112, Speaker A: I think we recorded in the middle of the hack.
00:51:46.288 - 00:51:58.130, Speaker B: That's right. That's right. You brought it up right at the end of the show. Right at the end of the show. We talked about it. Uh, but we ended up missing the, the midst of the drama. So, curious to get your take, Robert, what do you think? Should blast have done a rollback and or block the attacker?
00:51:58.242 - 00:52:42.640, Speaker C: Well, yeah, it's a great question. I mean, the reality is, for the time being, blast is completely, 100%, makes no illusions to the fact that it is centralized. It is not at all a decentralized l two yet. One of the advantages of that is that while under complete, centralized control, they can make changes, especially changes that are in the best interest of the users. And I think it just starts with a very simple question. Would a rollback be in the best interest of the users, or would blocking the attackers funds and then redistributing back to the users be in the best interest of the users? The answer is yes. Like, it seems very obvious to me.
00:52:42.640 - 00:53:38.678, Speaker C: The only downside, the only argument against it, is one in which the public at large would say, oh, but bless is completely centralized. Like, yes, they are. Like, all the arguments I saw for why they shouldn't do that, it was like, you know, oh, this just proves that blast is, like, not a true l two or, like, it just proves that, like, it doesn't matter. Like, this isn't ethereum. Back in the day when they had to make the hard decision to fork and move past the dow, like the original, like, hard fork decision. Like Ethereum and blast are radically different platforms and radically different systems, and one was designed to be decentralized, and one was not designed to be decentralized. So why even try to map the analogy to historical patterns like the DAo and just try to embrace the features of what it is?
00:53:38.766 - 00:54:08.854, Speaker B: All right, so let me steel man. Let me steel man that side just so that you have a counterparty to play devil's advocate against. So the steel man of the don't fork is, okay, one, if you fork now, you are setting a precedent that we will fork when bad things happen on this chain. And it's going to be a long time before this thing is fully decentralized. And if we do this one, we are weighing in on something that we don't know the answer to, of who exactly is these attacker, and blah, blah, blah. But second is that it's setting a. It's setting.
00:54:08.854 - 00:54:23.970, Speaker B: It's also implicitly giving us liability, because if we are blocking this attack, what about all the attacks that we don't block? What about all the little tiny hacks that people will then come and say, hey, you blocked the north korean attack, but you didn't block my hack of, like, a million dollars or $2 million.
00:54:24.162 - 00:54:24.514, Speaker A: Are.
00:54:24.554 - 00:54:55.486, Speaker B: Are you now liable to block every attack? And if not, like, is it wise to be creating this precedent that, look, if your protocol gets hacked, like, you as a user, you're responsible for making sure that you don't put your money into random devs who are, you know, doing whatever random nonsense. Uh, if the protocol is intentionally going out compromising its own, uh, uh, its own, uh, not the values that currently are ensconced in the protocol yet, because they're not. But that's. That's the protocol that we're aspiring to be is one that is fully decentralized and where we don't have this escape hatch that we can pull anytime we.
00:54:55.510 - 00:54:57.118, Speaker C: Want to, I don't think blast is.
00:54:57.166 - 00:54:59.782, Speaker B: A kind of moral hazard. All right, a couple points.
00:54:59.838 - 00:55:19.430, Speaker C: One, I don't think blast is trying to be this, like, radically decentralized platform. Two, we have a historical context for this. Binance and BSc. Whenever there was issues they could block, whenever there was hacks they could unhack, whenever there was stolen funds they could unsteal. Did it? Did they get it right 100% of the time?
00:55:19.502 - 00:55:19.734, Speaker B: No.
00:55:19.774 - 00:56:11.486, Speaker C: I'm sure there was all sorts of, like, heinous crimes on binance smart chain and, like, hacks that, like, they didn't fix, but whenever they had an opportunity to fix a large hack, they get it. And the user base, on the whole, was, like, incredibly happy that they did, and, like, legitimately. Pineapple smart chain is probably more decentralized and probably a more robust system than blast is, and they still did everything in their power to prevent users from being screwed over. Right. And that was one of the biggest selling points for a very long time of binance smart chain, which was the worst landmines. They were able to, like, fix the damage from and prevent users from getting royally screwed in the name of, like, aspirational decentralization. And so I think it's a good model when done correctly.
00:56:11.486 - 00:56:43.536, Speaker C: And I think if you set the expectations correctly, everybody's happy. I, you know, I vaguely recall CZ being on Twitter being like, hey, we fixed this one. Like, good job, everyone. We're not sure we can get them all, but when we can intervene to save users, we will. And that's a really good framework for people on a pretty centralized chain. And I think if the attitude is we will do our best when we can and we won't get them all, but if we can fix users, that's a good thing and there's no reason not to.
00:56:43.720 - 00:57:34.314, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm trying to remember exactly which BNB chain hack that was that found this extremely nuanced threshold signature bug that was common to a bunch of cosmos chains and then they reverted it after that one was the ultimate example. I think it was 2022. It was right before we talked about it on the show. I think it was right before FTX, like September, October. But I think the differences with BNB chain BSD, you kind of had say what you want about the legality of binance, but arguably binance has so much hold over its users because it's actually like, they like the platform and they trust it to do certain things. I just don't think you have the same level of trust here in the operator bridge. Kind of complex, right? Yeah, but it's clearly not the same.
00:57:34.434 - 00:57:54.514, Speaker C: Listen, the people that are using blast and the people that are using binance smart chain are not smart contracts. Code is law. Individual evangelists, they are retail that are clicking buttons on a website and they probably don't have any idea how it works under the hood and they don't really care about philosophical arguments.
00:57:54.814 - 00:58:04.136, Speaker A: Yeah, no, no, I'm just saying like the blast team has to be able to provide the same level of customer support as binance. For this analogy to work, they should.
00:58:04.270 - 00:58:07.264, Speaker B: So are you net. Net, are you saying, yes, rollback, no, rollback?
00:58:08.244 - 00:58:34.024, Speaker A: I think like the problem for them is they're in this muddled middle. If they were a centralized exchange, who is sponsoring it? They do rollback. No one's even going to blink an eye. Right. But the fact that they're not makes it in this, put it in this weird. And the fact that they're not. And Vitalik is constantly like dunking on them in his blog posts and paradigm has to change these tweets that say, you know, backed and what, I don't know, I forget what the meme is like and backed but not endorsed or whatever.
00:58:34.024 - 00:58:57.284, Speaker A: Like there is a re, it's very different than binance rolling back and it's like a, it's a different, it's a different type of. You have to be a lot more, you know, you be more brand conscious and I don't, I think they're kind of slash and burn and they kind of don't have the same user trust. Let's say that that's. I'm not saying it's not possible, I'm just saying that the world that let's.
00:58:57.444 - 00:59:04.044, Speaker B: Big moment. Yeah. Binary. Yes or no? Do you roll back or no, you roll back. Okay, cut.
00:59:04.464 - 00:59:09.808, Speaker A: All right, Tom, I think especially when you're doxed enough and have a lot of people in the US, it's very hard.
00:59:09.856 - 00:59:13.324, Speaker B: They're not docs, though, right? The multi sig? I think the multi sig is not docs.
00:59:13.664 - 00:59:15.564, Speaker A: Yeah, but I feel like it's.
00:59:16.064 - 00:59:20.008, Speaker D: Yeah, I think they got criticism for that after the original announcement.
00:59:20.056 - 00:59:24.584, Speaker A: Yeah, I think. I think it's not, they're not that. It's not that hard to find. Let's put that.
00:59:24.624 - 00:59:41.870, Speaker D: I think it, in some ways, it kind of goes back to the ave maker morpho kind of idea. And that's. There is a school of thought, which I think I agree with sometimes, that no governance is the best governance. And I think in blast kits, they don't even have fraud proofs. Right. It's literally just. They dump the call data on chain.
00:59:41.870 - 00:59:59.658, Speaker D: And so if you don't want to have this onus on you, then you have to find a way to throw away the keys and make sure that there is no onus, that you can't possibly do a rollback, that the whole thing just sort of functions without you. And I think until you're at that point, like, there is that obligation.
00:59:59.706 - 00:59:59.842, Speaker A: Right.
00:59:59.858 - 01:00:16.506, Speaker D: Like, if you have the button and people are screaming at you to press it, you have to press it. And so I think maybe this also just underscores for all teams thinking about how to basically find a way to throw away that button and make sure the system is not relying on them.
01:00:16.610 - 01:00:26.144, Speaker B: Yeah, I completely agree. I probably feel much less emotional about it than maybe most people.
01:00:27.284 - 01:00:27.660, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:00:27.692 - 01:00:31.836, Speaker C: I think in a way, having.
01:00:31.980 - 01:01:18.414, Speaker B: I think you described it well as like, having the button. The button is there, like, the reason why we have these admin keys is for bugs, for like, you know, things that some coding error that ends up actually affecting the protocol. Having $62 million stolen by North Korea is just as bad as any other bug that might get introduced at a protocol level. So if you want to save your ass and also save crypto, more or less, it's kind of on you to help do the good work of making sure that North Korea can't monetize these attacks. And so I think the answer just really, really easy is that, yes, it does open a can of worms, and that can of worms is going to get opened anyway because you don't have fraud proofs and you're not fully decentralized yet. And that's true for most of the optimistic roll ups today, is that they're not all the way. What is it, level two or level three roll ups? I forget what the level is.
01:01:18.414 - 01:01:49.370, Speaker B: They're not all the way to the higher levels of roll up ness, in which case you kind of have to accept that you're not there, and there's no point in playing make believe. Just do the right thing, and that probably means block the bridge, or in the worst case, roll back the chain. I'm very against rollbacks. I think they're just incredibly messy, and Defi is so complicated now that literally rolling back is just borderline impossible. Like, you're going to undo too many things. Yeah, but. But blocking the bridge.
01:01:49.370 - 01:01:58.850, Speaker B: I mean, the fact that there's no privacy pools or anything on blast should make it, I think, relatively straightforward. And I assume that's why the hacker gave back all the money, was that they were.
01:01:58.882 - 01:02:20.520, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm just the reason that. My only point was, I think, like, if you have some credibility with your users, it's much easier to just be, like, roll back. No one cares. You don't have to second guess it. You don't have the army getting angry at you on the Internet. Right. Like, how many people were actually angry about the BSC rollbacks? I'm willing to say zero.
01:02:20.520 - 01:02:40.076, Speaker A: Yeah. Vitalik isn't writing blog posts about how BSC is, like, is, like, a bad l two. Right? Like. But obviously, there's every fucking blog post. If it's possible, there's a dig at blast. And like I said, the blast investors are also kind of, like, shirking. So it's like, okay, well, that's a very different game.
01:02:40.076 - 01:02:41.108, Speaker A: Right? That's, like, a very.
01:02:41.196 - 01:02:45.260, Speaker B: There was a day when people were firing a lot of pot shots at BSC, but I think at this point.
01:02:45.292 - 01:02:47.924, Speaker A: BSc totally differently screamed everybody. They were.
01:02:47.964 - 01:02:49.436, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, no, granted.
01:02:49.620 - 01:02:54.396, Speaker A: But they weren't. They didn't care about the rollback thing. They're like, binance rolls back anytime, right?
01:02:54.460 - 01:02:54.636, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:02:54.660 - 01:03:07.644, Speaker C: This is part of the funds are Safu meme is that finance protected its users. They didn't give a shit about, like, what led to the situation they were like, if we can get our users money back, we will. And everyone liked them for. It's a good framework.
01:03:07.944 - 01:03:52.026, Speaker A: This gets back to one thing you said, haseeb, before. Probably we have to end, which is every new cycle, there's a new exchange modality that attracts the new assets. The old exchanges are too slow or too regulated or too lazy or whatever the reason is. But in the same way that Solana is the new exchange for meme coins or the exchange for meme coins, at this point, the l two s themselves are basically exchange custodians in some weird way until they're actually decentralized, right? They, they are exchange custodians exchange slash custodian. Like, they have some weird middle, middle ground of those things. And I think it. I think they're going to learn this very hard lesson, which is like, well, they don't have the gravitas of binance in that, in this scenario.
01:03:52.026 - 01:03:54.522, Speaker A: So it's good. It's a trickier situation.
01:03:54.698 - 01:04:01.804, Speaker B: But I want to also grant that there's a continuum here, right? Not all l two s are in the same bucket. You know, you have, like, for sure, for sure.
01:04:03.064 - 01:04:05.800, Speaker A: Like blind, like arbitrage being a great example.
01:04:05.872 - 01:04:21.832, Speaker B: Arbitrum is arbitrum farther along, and then you've got the ZK rollups, which are even farther along, you know, having live validity proofs and having a lot of stuff on chain that, you know, time locks and all this stuff. So there, there. I think there's a, there's a range, you know, and I think there's. I don't think it's quite.
01:04:21.888 - 01:04:34.532, Speaker A: But I don't think roll up developers felt feel this thing that they're running an exchange. But like, to your point, they are kind of running an exchange, right? Like inevitably in the early days, inevitably.
01:04:34.588 - 01:05:09.640, Speaker B: In the early days, inevitably. And I think, like part of, and to be fair to blast, blast is brand new. You know, they just launched like less than a month ago. So it's no surprise that with all the changes they made that they're still on training wheels and they still have, you know, like, this is only an interesting question because of the timing. If this was, you know, a year in the future and, you know, blast integrates fraud proofs that they upstream from opistack or pull downstream, I guess. But it wouldn't be as interesting of a question because the answer would be like, obviously no, it would just be a complete nightmare to try to do that. But we're in this unique gestation period where the answer could be yes.
01:05:09.640 - 01:05:25.032, Speaker B: And I think we pretty much all in agreement. The answer is probably yes. So anyway, all right, we got a wrap. We back next time with more contentious me making apologetics for criminals. Till next time.
01:05:25.128 - 01:05:28.284, Speaker A: See, everybody, we're just waiting for your second podcast.
01:05:29.144 - 01:05:30.696, Speaker B: My second podcast? What does that mean?
01:05:30.720 - 01:05:36.128, Speaker A: What's that? Yeah, the one focused on prison reform, criminal justice reform.
01:05:36.176 - 01:05:45.232, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, that's right. That's right. We'll do the after hours. If you stick around after the show, we'll do a extra segment on that anyway, the prison block.
01:05:45.328 - 01:05:46.044, Speaker C: Oh.
01:05:48.864 - 01:05:49.704, Speaker B: All right. Wow.
