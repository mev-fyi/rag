00:00:00.240 - 00:00:47.148, Speaker A: I've definitely been surprised by the amount of product market fit we pad because when we launched, there were no chains at all that had the ability to support data blobs. This was before EIP 444. So once the SC launch, there was this extremely pressing need in the industry that we just needed a place for these roll ups to post data blobs cheaply. And so now we've seen kind of like an influx of, of roll ups post the date at Celestia. There's something like 20 RP stack chains posting the data Celestia right now and many more in the pipeline. So there's this kind of like extreme, kind of like product market fit. And so I think that's going well, especially with, like, I always kind of envisioned two years ago that or even three years ago.
00:00:47.148 - 00:00:58.620, Speaker A: My vision when I created Celestia was that one day you'll be able to go on some website and you'll be able to click a button and immediately launch a roll up, your own roll up.
