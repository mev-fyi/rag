00:00:06.730 - 00:00:56.670, Speaker A: Thanks for tuning in to this week's news. Recap. Ronan will be reimbursing users eight days after losing $600 million to the largest exploit in DFI history, sky Mavis announced plans to reimburse all affected Ronan network bridge users. Sky Mavis will be raising $150,000,000 in a funding round led by Finance, with participation from Animoca Brands, A 16 Z and others. That $150,000,000 in cash, along with balance sheet funds already owned by Sky Mavis, will replace the 173, 600 Ether and 25.5 million USDC that was drained from the Ronan Bridge last week in a social engineering attack that saw four of Sky Mavis run Validators and a third party Validator run by Axidao compromised.
00:00:57.170 - 00:00:58.782, Speaker B: The news comes just a few months.
00:00:58.836 - 00:01:08.786, Speaker A: After the Wormhole Bridge announced a similar reimbursement funding round from Jump Crypto following a 300 million dollar exploit. In the aftermath, Ronan Bridge will be.
00:01:08.808 - 00:01:11.746, Speaker B: Upgrading its security, which previously relied on.
00:01:11.768 - 00:02:07.330, Speaker A: Only five out of nine validator confirmations for a transaction to go through. According to a Sky Mavis blog post, the new validator group will be up to 21 Validators in the next three months, split amongst various stakeholders. Rather than just Sky Mavis, Ronan Bridge, which was shut down in the aftermath of last week's hack, will go live after a round of upgrades and audits that could take weeks. Meanwhile, Binance will be supporting ETH withdrawals and deposits from Ronan. Interestingly, the 56,000 ETH drained from Axidao will not be fully reimbursed by Finance or Sky Mavis's balance sheet. Instead, Sky Mavis explained the 56,000 ETH compromised from the Axidao treasury will remain undercollateralized as Sky Mavis works with law enforcement to recover the funds. If the funds are not fully recovered within two years, the Axidao will vote on next steps for the treasury.
00:02:07.330 - 00:02:14.114, Speaker A: In related news, the Ronan Bridge hacker was active this week, moving roughly $7 million through the coin mixer.
00:02:14.162 - 00:02:18.678, Speaker B: Tornado cash stablecoins are coming to bitcoin.
00:02:18.854 - 00:03:09.130, Speaker A: Lightning Labs, a Lightning network developer, announced a new protocol this week dubbed Taro, which aims to make bitcoin's L2 solution a multiasset network, as explained by Lightning Labs CEO Elizabeth Stark in a blog post. In essence, Taro's purpose is to Bitcoinize the dollar, Stark wrote. With Tarot, developers will be able to issue assets on the bitcoin blockchain and then move them onto Lightning for speed and scalability, making use of bitcoin liquidity to ensure interoperability between assets. Notably, according to Stark, Terra will also allow assets like stablecoins to route through the bitcoin network via Lightning. Interestingly, Terra was only recently made possible by bitcoin's taproot upgrade, which made significant improvements to contracting security and efficiency for the chain.
00:03:09.470 - 00:03:12.666, Speaker B: Fun fact the launch of Tarot was.
00:03:12.688 - 00:03:58.038, Speaker A: On April 5, aka Satoshi's birthday, the same day that Roosevelt ordered US citizens to return gold worth more than $100 for Fiat in 1933. Major raises was the theme of the week. Crypto funding continued its rampant pace this week in conjunction with a Tarot announcement, lightning Labs raised $70 million in a Series B funding round led by Valor Equity Partners and Bailey Gifford. Other participants included Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev, crypto Infrastructure firm NYDIG and Brevin Howard. Lightning Labs did not disclose the valuation. Finance US raised a 200 million dollar funding round at a valuation of $4.5 billion, pre money.
00:03:58.038 - 00:04:42.920, Speaker A: The block reports that a binance US spokesperson revealed that the exchange wants to raise more in the coming months and plans to go public in the next two to three years. Near Protocol announced a second nine digit raise in under three months on Wednesday. The protocol is bringing in $350,000,000 in a round led by Tiger Global to decentralize the near ecosystem. Near foundation announced a $150,000,000 raise in mid January to support DFI development. Disclosure Near Protocol is a previous sponsor of this podcast. Boba Network, An Ethereum scaling solution, secured $45 million in a Series A, giving the protocol a unicorn valuation of $1.5 billion.
00:04:42.920 - 00:05:34.562, Speaker A: Blockchain security firm Certic announced an $88 million funding round that saw participation from traditional behemoths like Tiger Global, Goldman Sachs and Sequoia Capital. Certic is now valued at $2 billion. Crypto payments firm Wire was acquired by Bolt in a deal valued at roughly $1.5 billion, reports the block. The UK plans to be a global crypto leader On Tuesday, Rishi Sunak, the UK's chancellor, laid out plans to make the UK a global crypto asset technology hub. The UK is set to make moves to regulate coins, introduce an infrastructure sandbox for crypto firms to experiment, establish a crypto asset engagement group and explore UK crypto taxes. Notably, the UK announced that the Royal Mint would be creating an NFT project this summer.
00:05:34.562 - 00:05:53.040, Speaker A: It's my ambition to make the UK a global hub for crypto asset technology, said Sunak. Somewhat contradictorily, the news comes as the UK's Financial Conduct Authority is reluctant to give firms such as Blockchain.com antimoney laundering licenses, leading many firms to pull out of the crypto asset licensing process.
00:05:54.210 - 00:05:58.186, Speaker B: Another Week Another multimillion dollar hack, Inverse.
00:05:58.218 - 00:06:47.150, Speaker A: Finance, an Ethereum lending protocol, lost $15 million to an exploit this week, making it the 34th largest hack in the DFI space. According to rect. The manipulation was not a flash loan attack and was unrelated to Inverse's smart contract or front end code, wrote the team. Instead, the hack involved a capital intensive manipulation of the inverprice Oracle on SushiSwap. Once the Oracle was tricked into showing a fraudulently high price for inv, the hacker was able to borrow $15.6 million worth of Dola, WBTC and WiFi. For those of you who missed out on this week's episode of The Chopping Block, I recommend listening, as Tarun Chitra and Tom Schmidt do a great job of explaining how the price manipulation worked and how the hacker pulled it off in a single block.
00:06:47.150 - 00:07:59.062, Speaker A: The Inverse Finance team has committed to reimbursing all affected users and is currently trying to figure out the most efficient way to repay users without affecting the peg of dola inverse finance's algorithmic stablecoin. The headline for this section could have been about a multibillion dollar hack. According to Open Zeppelin, the security firm uncovered and resolved a bug on convex finance that could have resulted in a $15 billion rug pool due to how Convex's multisig was configured. Again, for more information, watch this week's episode of The Chopping Block, which talks about how OpenZeppelin forced convex finance to add members to its multi SIG before revealing the critical bug. The SEC approved a new bitcoin ETF. But the US securities and Exchange Commission approved a new bitcoin futures ETF from NYSE, Arca and Tucrium on Wednesday, as reported by CoinDesk. Bloomberg's senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas called it a good sign regarding the approval of a spot bitcoin ETF because previous bitcoin futures ETFs were approved under the Investment Company Act of 1940.
00:07:59.062 - 00:09:10.570, Speaker A: While the Nic, Arca and Tucrium ETF is the first bitcoin futures ETF to gain approval from the SEC under the securities act of 1933, this is a market change. According to an early January thread from Bloomberg's James Seifert, the approval of an ETF under the 1933 act would hinder some of the SEC's arguments against spot bitcoin ETFs due to CME futures not being of significant size, subject to manipulation, et cetera. Interestingly, Seifert notes that the pricing methodology for futures and spot bitcoin ETFs will be the same, meaning the futures the SEC has approved are based on the pricing from exchanges that they say are subject to manipulation. In related SEC crypto news, SEC Chair Gary Gensler called for further SEC oversight on stablecoins in a speech on April 4. The three largest stablecoins were created by trading or lending platforms themselves, and US. Retail investors have no direct right of redemption for the two largest stablecoins by market capitalization. There are conflicts of interest and market integrity questions that would benefit from more oversight, said Gensler.
00:09:10.570 - 00:10:05.674, Speaker A: During the same speech, Gensler revealed that the SEC is working with the CFTC to potentially split duties regarding crypto purview. I've asked staff to work with the Commodities Future Trading Commission on how we jointly might address such platforms that might trade both crypto based security tokens and some commodity tokens, said Gensler. FTX US CEO Brian Harrison told the Decrypt Daily Podcast that the exchange is holding back from listing assets due to regulatory uncertainty regarding crypto tokens and securities law, which is spearheaded by the SEC. FTX US only supports 27 assets in comparison to FTX's 322. According to new guidelines, the SEC wants crypto exchanges to treat customer crypto holdings as liabilities on their balance sheet. In related news, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen made her first speech about digital assets.
00:10:05.722 - 00:10:12.094, Speaker B: On Thursday, in which he called Crypto Transformative bitcoin 2022.
00:10:12.292 - 00:11:03.354, Speaker A: Bitcoin's annual conference in Miami took place this week. In an on brand move, the festivities were kicked off with Miami Mayor Francis Suarez unveiling an eleven foot, 3000 pound laser eyed robot bull statue. The event featured speakers such as peter thiel, Jordan Peterson and Jack Mallors. However, one prominent speaker, El Salvador's President Naim Bukele, canceled his appearance at the event due to unforeseen circumstances in his home country. On Thursday, Bitcoin 2022 experienced its first big announcement when Robin Hood chief product officer, Aparna. Chenna Pragada told the audience that the trading platform had activated crypto wallet functionality for 2 million customers. Users will now be able to send BTC, ETH and Doge to selfcustidied wallets.
00:11:03.354 - 00:12:08.870, Speaker A: Robinhood will also add support for Lightning Network. In other Bitcoin news, two of the most prominent SATS stackers did what they do best this week they bought more Bitcoin. On April 5, MacroStrategy, the subsidiary of MicroStrategy, purchased an additional 4167 BTC, or $190,000,000 worth. And on the 6th, Luna Foundation guard added roughly 5040 BTC, or $231,000,000 to its $1 billion plus stack. In related Terra news, TerraForm Labs announced a 100 million dollar token swap of Luna to AVAX on Thursday between TerraForm and Avalanche Foundation. Time for fun Bits a novel Dow experiment tweet Dow caught my attention this week due to a fun twist on NFT utility. The Dow sold a batch of 1000 NFTs, each depicting the iconic Twitter egg, giving holders the ability to tweet once per day from the official Tweet Dow Twitter account with absolutely no restrictions.
00:12:08.870 - 00:12:40.730, Speaker A: As this is crypto Twitter, the content is still a bit unhinged, but somewhat humorous. The NFTs for those interested are selling for a floor price of zero 3119 ETH. For those who need a smile, I would recommend giving Tweet Dow's feed a scroll. It's quite funny.
