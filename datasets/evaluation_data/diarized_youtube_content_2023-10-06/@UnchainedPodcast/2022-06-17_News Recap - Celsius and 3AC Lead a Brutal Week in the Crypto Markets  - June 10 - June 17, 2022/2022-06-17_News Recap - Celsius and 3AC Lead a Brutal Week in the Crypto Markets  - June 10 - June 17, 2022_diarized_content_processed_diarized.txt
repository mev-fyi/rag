00:00:05.690 - 00:01:03.230, Speaker A: Thanks for tuning in to this week's news. Recap. BlockFi liquidates three AC as contagion spreads to Finblocks There was so much news regarding Celsius and Three Arrows that a few items didn't make it into the interview portion of the podcast that bear mentioning. First, the Financial Times reported that Blockfly liquidated Three Arrows after it failed to meet margin calls on its Bitcoin loans with additional collateral this weekend. Yuri Mushkin, BlockFi's chief risk officer, told the Ft that the company quote can confirm that we exercised our best business judgment recently with a large client that failed to meet its obligations. We believe we were one of the first to take action with this counterparty. Additionally, Finblocks, a crypto yield and staking platform, announced a $500 daily withdrawal limit and a $1500 maximum monthly withdrawal limit for all users on Wednesday in light of a highly volatile market.
00:01:03.230 - 00:02:04.482, Speaker A: As of press time, they have yet to release a schedule on when withdrawals might return to normalcy. Notably, Three Arrows Capital is an investor and one of eight partners that previously helped Finblocks generate yield, according to a statement released by Finblox on Twitter. In Finblocks's Twitter bio, the company urges customers to sign up and buy and earn up to 90%. APY on Your crypto Coinbase reduces its workforce by 18% Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the US, laid off 18% of its workforce this week. The firm announced the move on Tuesday, with roughly 1100 employees receiving the bad news via their personal email, as Coinbase decided to immediately cut off all affected staff from the company's systems. In a blog post, CEO Brian Armstrong cited an upcoming crypto winter and an overhring spree as the two main reasons for the layoffs. Coinbase was not the only major crypto company to shrink its workforce this week.
00:02:04.482 - 00:02:51.950, Speaker A: Crypto.com Disclosure A sponsor trimmed its headcount by 5% over the weekend after laying off 260 employees, and crypto lending platform BlockFi plans to reduce its workforce by 20%, according to CEO Zach Prince on Twitter. It's not all bad news for those looking for a job in Web Three. For example, FTX CEO Sam Thinkman Fried says his firm is looking to grow from 300 to 400 people in the next year. Crypto Exchange Kraken Disclosure a former sponsor is also looking to fill over 500 open positions. Finance is also in the hiring game, with CEO Changpeng Zhao tweeting in a thinly veiled shot at Coinbase and Crypto.com that the Exchange is hiring for over 2000 positions.
00:02:51.950 - 00:03:31.454, Speaker A: It was not easy saying no to Super Bowl ads, stadium naming rights, large sponsor deals a few months ago, but we did. Today we are hiring for 2000 open positions for Finance, Zhao wrote. The last time prices were this low. Data from Coin market cap shows that this week the total cryptocurrency market cap fell below $1 trillion for the first time since January 2021, marking a precipitous fall from its alltime high of $2.9 trillion in November. 2021. Bitcoin is currently trading at 22 $480, its lowest since December 2020.
00:03:31.454 - 00:04:08.026, Speaker A: Ethereum has also crashed substantially. ETH is trading at one $220, its lowest since January 2021. ETH has also had a particularly brutal last few months, falling 16.8%, 29.2% and 36.8% over April, May and June, respectively, according to data from Crypto Rank, as currently constituted out of the top 100 coins by market capitalization, only one token bitfinex's, Leo, is up year to date. On the flip side, 23 tokens are down more than 80% year to date.
00:04:08.026 - 00:05:08.746, Speaker A: Kraken CEO gets political, invites unhappy employees to leave. The New York Times reported that Kraken CEO Jesse Powell sparked an internal culture war at the Crypto exchange. Powell has allegedly led company wide discussions on topics like the usage of preferred pronouns when using the N word is okay and whether Kraken employees should be able to arm themselves. Powell, an early bitcoiner with roots as far back as Mount Gox, was cited as describing American women as brainwashed on the company slack. In addition, Kraken also published a company wide culture document alongside a Jet Ski program because they want people who are leaving to feel like they are hopping on a Jet Ski and heading happily to their next adventure. That allows anyone who disagrees with the company to leave with four months pay on Twitter. In a preemptive defensive thread before the New York Times article was published, Powell said that roughly 20 employees out of 3200 are not on board with Kraken's culture.
00:05:08.746 - 00:05:51.914, Speaker A: Based on Kraken executive Christina Yee's reported words via Slack, this culture will not change anytime soon. CEO, company and culture are not going to change in a meaningful way, she wrote. If someone strongly dislikes or hates working here, or thinks those here are hateful or have poor character, work somewhere that doesn't disgust you. The SEC is investigating insider trading at crypto exchanges. According to Fox Business, the US. Securities and Exchange Commission launched an inquiry into whether crypto exchanges have proper safeguards in place to prevent insider trading on their platforms. Fox reports that the SEC has sent a letter to one of the major crypto exchanges requesting information on its current insider trading safeguards.
00:05:51.914 - 00:07:01.022, Speaker A: The SEC did not immediately respond to Fox's request to comment. Coin center is Suing the IRS here's why Coin Center has filed a lawsuit against the Treasury Department arguing that a crypto tax reporting requirement from last year's infrastructure bill is unconstitutional. The requirement, called 60 50 I, which goes into effect in 2024, and which some of you may recall was covered on Unchained last fall, would require US. Taxpayers to report the Social Security numbers and other personal information of anyone who sends them more than $10,000 in cryptocurrency. This is problematic, as Coinsnder explains in its lawsuit, because the reporting mandate would force Americans using cryptocurrency to share intrusive details about themselves, both with each other and with the federal government. Coincenter argues that such detailed reporting could have a negative impact on transactional privacy in the US. The reports would give the government an unprecedented level of detail about transactions within a realm where users have taken a series of steps to protect their transactional privacy, they conclude.
00:07:01.022 - 00:08:19.910, Speaker A: In practice, the amendment's reporting mandate would often be impossible to comply with because its terms do not coherently map onto the nature of the technology that it regulates. Major Wallets Patch Vulnerability Before anything goes Wrong MetaMask and Phantom, along with other browser based Wallets, disclosed a recently patched security vulnerability that was fixed without any attackers taking advantage of it. According to MetaMask, the vulnerability did not affect the majority of users. In essence, the bug put a user's secret recovery phrase at risk within a device's storage under certain circumstances, such as if the user used a hard drive without encryption. Both MetaMask and Phantom thanked Hallborn Security, a crypto cybersecurity firm, for originally discovering the vulnerability in September 2021. Web Two plus Web Three equals Web Five block through Crypto subsidiary TBD announced an early stage initiative called Web Five on Friday. The goal, according to promotional slides made available online, is to build a decentralized web development ecosystem that does not necessarily involve renting storage space from blockchain protocols.
00:08:19.910 - 00:09:17.738, Speaker A: The initiative has apparently been named Web Five to reflect that it is a combination of Web 20 and Web Three principles and technologies. Jack Dorsey, CEO of Block and Web Three Skeptic, said on Twitter that he believes Web Five will likely be our most important contribution to the Internet. He also added Snarkily, Rip, Web, three VCs. While the new project was announced last Friday, there is no official release date. Terraclone USDD is struggling Tron's algorithmic Stablecoin USDD broke its Peg with the dollar this week. Data from Coin Gecko shows that the token has traded between ninety six cents and ninety nine cents since Sunday afternoon Eastern Time. In response to the depegging event, Tron Dow Reserve, a foundation set up to ensure that USDD maintains its Peg, deployed over $2 billion to restore the Peg on Monday.
00:09:17.738 - 00:09:56.326, Speaker A: The Dow also spent $220,000,000 on purchasing more TRX on Wednesday, causing the price of TRX to jump 25% plus. Despite the announcements, USDD has not yet managed to reach $1 again. That being said, based on his website, it appears that Tron Dow Reserve has a bit more funding left to try to maintain Usdd's Peg. The organization claims to have over $2.3 billion in reserves left. A new stablecoin enters the market Circle announced the launch of Eurocoin this week. A fully reserved Euro backed stablecoin.
00:09:56.326 - 00:10:44.090, Speaker A: The token will become available on June 30 and will operate under the same full reserve model that Circle uses for USDC.
