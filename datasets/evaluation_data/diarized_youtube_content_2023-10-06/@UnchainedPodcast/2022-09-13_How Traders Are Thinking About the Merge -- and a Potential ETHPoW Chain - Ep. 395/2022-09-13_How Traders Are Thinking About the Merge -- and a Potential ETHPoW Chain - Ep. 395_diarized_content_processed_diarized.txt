00:00:00.570 - 00:00:42.650, Speaker A: Hey, everyone. The merge is upon us. After this show is published, Ethereum's merge, which will transition the blockchain to proof of stake, will likely happen within about two days. Earlier this summer, Kevin Zo of Galwa Capital raised the ire of many people in Ethereum when he talked about the likelihood that an Ethereum proof of work chain would come out of the fork. And in recent weeks, it does look like there's a movement behind this so called Ethereum proof of work or ETH POW fork. Though how successful or how smooth it will be is anyone's guess. In this episode, Kevin and Evgeny Guyvoy of Wintermute, a large market maker in crypto, discussed different ways the merge could play out.
00:00:42.650 - 00:01:14.786, Speaker A: Honestly, they said so many things that surprised me, and we got to cover everything from the potential ETH POW chain to Bitcoin to ETH itself to DeFi. We talked about NFTs and more. Litecoin dogecoin and Shib even got a mention. I hope you find this episode as thought provoking as I did, and also that you have a happy merge week. When I catch you Friday, we should be in an Ethereum proof of stake world. Enjoy the show. Hi, everyone.

00:02:50.318 - 00:02:51.650, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks for having us.
00:02:51.720 - 00:02:53.186, Speaker C: Yeah, nice to meet you.
00:02:53.288 - 00:03:23.850, Speaker A: So, as we just mentioned, Ethereum's long awaited merge will arrive very soon, most likely a day or two after this podcast comes out. Probably the only other Ethereum hard fork that was as closely watched as this one was the Dow hard fork back in 2016. Kevin, your views on the merge are somewhat known, but let's have you give a short recap of what you think will happen at a high level for people who either missed your earlier interview with me or haven't seen your tweets. What do you think will happen at the time of the merge?
00:03:24.010 - 00:04:30.286, Speaker B: Yeah, happy to talk about that a little bit. So I think just overall really sort of the contention that I have right now is that it could be a lot messier than I think a lot of people expect and I just kind of wanted to surface that with the community. And I think for the most part a lot of these kinds of scenarios have already kind of been playing out in the market when the futures curve backwardated a lot less now than before. And I think that there's a lot of risks that are surrounding possible technical failures on the merge. Other kinds of weird griefing attacks by maybe certain actors within the space, whether that be like maybe some kind of third fork or exchanges behaving badly now, I think for any single one of these things, the probability I think is very low. But I think when you add all of it together, at least at the time it seemed like that, I think that that wasn't really being priced in properly. And I think since then, the markets kind of played out st ETH and ETH widened, that spread widened.
00:04:30.286 - 00:04:51.654, Speaker B: The futures went backwardated. And then since then, it's actually come in a bit the other direction. So it's interesting to see the market dynamics there. But I think overall not everybody I think is so sure now. I think that the merge is going to do what it's supposed to do and I think at least having a little bit of that uncertainty in the air I think is healthy for the space.
00:04:51.772 - 00:04:56.860, Speaker A: Evgeny, as a crypto market maker, how are you looking at the merge? What do you think will happen at that time?
00:04:57.390 - 00:06:24.450, Speaker C: Yeah, so for us as a market maker, it's a pretty interesting event, obviously and even more interesting given how deep we are in DeFi in general, not just on ethereum but all kinds of L, two S and all kinds of scalability solutions like whatever you call it. And so for us it's like three problems we had to solve. So first we needed to make sure that we don't miss something and lose a lot of money, which is probably the main thing for any trading shock in this space. And it has to do with replay tax, it has to do with in general where we store our ERC, 20 assets and how we store them and what can potentially happen upgrading our Gnosis saves for example, all those small and big things. Second is basically any kinds of opportunities and that's primarily, I would say on proof of work chain part like well, the one that supposedly will fork effectively, however you call it. And in the most basic sense, it's basically once the merge happens or once the fork happens, actually try to sell all the assets which we think will be worth zero primarily stable coins into the ethereum proof of work and basically trying to get a lot of free of this new Ethereum. And the third bit is it has to do with our DeFi operations.
00:06:24.450 - 00:07:15.506, Speaker C: It's actually understanding how mev space, like how block building space will change post merge. And that's actually also a really interesting topic and that's what we are primarily looking at now because a lot of those issues that we initially identified over the last couple of months, they kind of subsided. Some of them are still there but we don't really see as many issues that can lose us money, namely like none. I would say opportunities wise, I don't really think it's going to be amazing opportunity in general. I think a lot of it, just like Kevin said, a lot of it played out in the futures market over the last couple of months. Already in stake these. So it's all about if you can be the fastest during the first couple of blocks when they're going to be like a lot of mess potentially.
00:07:15.506 - 00:07:29.930, Speaker C: And also how do you manage your inventory on all kinds of centralized exchanges which will close down or shut down all the deposits and withdrawals for quite some time? I can imagine, but that's kind of like normal stuff for us. That's our bread and butter.
00:07:30.370 - 00:08:19.194, Speaker A: Okay, so yeah, let's dive more into this proof of work fork because I see so much chatter about this. Obviously it's funny because I do think the longer term impact really will be around ETH. But at this moment in time, this is what a lot of people seem focused on. Interestingly, or maybe not surprisingly actually, I see a number of developers that are deriding this potential ETH proof of work chain. In particular. They're sort of making fun of the team for not having yet for instance, switch the chain ID or leaving it missing or basically telling them that they're trying to change it the wrong way. They're implying that these developers don't even know how to change it as evgeny alluded to.
00:08:19.194 - 00:09:13.646, Speaker A: Some people are saying the chain probably won't even be ready until sometime after the merge. So it'll basically be a fork of the fork, which is fascinating. Or I'm not sure exactly how this works, but obviously then on the other hand, we have traders like yourselves or other community members who are writing up whole newsletters and blog posts and tweet threads on how to trade this ETH proof of workfork. So again, I flash back to what happened to the Dow where it basically seems like the developers see things one way they see back then they saw the Ethereum classic chain as not being useful. The traders were like, hey, that's free money. So I was just curious for your take, given all these technical issues that the ETH proof of work team seems to be having, do you expect that chain to emerge right at the time of the merge or afterward? And how do you expect any technical difficulties to affect how it plays out?
00:09:13.828 - 00:10:05.482, Speaker B: Yes, for us, I think we've heard all sorts of different opinions about this. Whether it'll be on time or not, we're trying to prepare for any situation. Certainly if the fork is on time, there's probably going to be a lot more trading opportunities. And I think it's also because of these kinds of revelations about the chain ID or about whether or not it's going to be ready on time, which is why kind of the futures base is closed in. And maybe this is also why a lot of people are right now dumping their Ethpal ahead of time. So I think generally, there's been a couple of things that I think the Ethpow community did that I think was not strategically advantageous to them. So I think things like, for example, beyond just the repeal of 1559, this idea of creating a multi SIG to fund development, I think it's a bit double edged.
00:10:05.482 - 00:10:49.910, Speaker B: I personally think that it's not the best idea. It's sort of like you're introducing this kind of layer of centralization on that chain, and there's like a small group that's in charge of some kind of dev treasury. I think it would have been better for them to play more along the lines of ideological purity, especially given the tornado cash revelations. But at the same time, I understand why they're doing that, and it's because they don't really have an Ethereum foundation on their side to go back development and bring new apps to the chain, that sort of thing. So I think it's a really tough situation for them. I don't think it was a good idea to introduce any whiff of corruption or that it being a money grab. I mean, everybody already thinks that it's a money grab.
00:10:49.910 - 00:11:15.298, Speaker B: So to introduce more of that where people can point fingers and people can accuse them of doing that even more, I think that that's not the PR that they need. But I think all those things taken into consideration, I think the market is already reflecting these kinds of new expectations. I think Polo yesterday traded down to like, 1.8% from, like, roughly it was hovering around, like three, three and a half percent.
00:11:15.464 - 00:11:19.782, Speaker A: You're talking about the ETH proof of work IOUs on. Okay, yeah.
00:11:19.916 - 00:11:52.750, Speaker B: So I think that's already come in quite a bit. So we'll see where the market places things. Certainly the size that's being traded on bitfinex's chain split tokens and on polo with their split tokens is very shallow. So there's not that much price discovery. And there could still be really large players, obviously, ethereum foundation, a lot of large whales that haven't dumped yet. But who do want to dump, but the size is just too big. So I think we really need to see all of that kind of play out and wash out, I think within the first week or two, maybe even quicker than that.
00:11:52.750 - 00:12:21.526, Speaker B: And then afterwards, then we can come to some kind of equilibrium price, at least in the short term for Ethpow. And then what happens in the long term really depends. I think the POS guys think that it bleeds out to zero. That's probably very likely. Also, there's also possibilities of it just randomly pumping for other reasons. They do some kind of deal with some group or POS completely fails for reasons unrelated to POW. So there's all sorts of it can go anywhere from there.
00:12:21.526 - 00:12:44.410, Speaker B: And I think it's really we're just trying to figure out what should we do before the merge, what should we do during the merge and immediately right after it in the next few blocks? And then what should we do maybe about a week or two out? And then from there we don't really care too much because I think for these longer time frames, it's just not as interesting as sort of like the mechanics of trading these kinds of special sits and one off situations.
00:12:44.570 - 00:13:19.914, Speaker A: Okay, one thing I want to clarify is just when you talked about repealing 1559, it's because that drastically reduced what the miners were earning. So by repealing it, then they would sort of boost how much they're earning because that was burning part of the fees. But then I wanted to ask you so explain how this works for the Ethpow tokens that are available on some of these exchanges. So for people that are trading these, does this mean that the exchange will just give them whatever the same number of actual Ethpound tokens are that are available after this new chain survives or how does that work?
00:13:20.032 - 00:13:52.680, Speaker B: I imagine that's the case. I don't have any special insight there. I imagine that there must be some exchange out there, maybe one of the smaller ones that just completely messes it up and continues to accept deposits of Ethpow as if there were ETH POS. I mean, there's all sorts of weird edge cases and I wouldn't put it past somebody to mess up somewhere. But according to plan though, it would be that each token becomes two tokens. Exchanges would give it to their customers based on right before the snapshot what the ownership split looked.
00:13:54.970 - 00:14:12.330, Speaker A: Are you how are you thinking about obviously Kevin just mentioned that there's potential for it to be live later than the actual merge. What are you sort of either betting on or how are you thinking about this uncertainty?
00:14:12.490 - 00:15:27.140, Speaker C: Yeah, I guess what they communicate so far is it will be almost exactly at the merge, which will make things quite fun for a lot of people and quite difficult for a lot of people as well. I think ultimately that's most likely that would happen actually because they're just looking at the way you did mention a few developers having problems with them on Esports side. And I've seen Coinbase has been very happy with them as well, I think today about not pushing through the chain ID or something, which obviously is a prerequisite for replay tax being potentially possible. So they have like a week and they still need to deliver on a lot of things. So I think the right play for them would be actually to maybe delay it and get it done properly. I didn't argue. To me the most curious thing is why wouldn't they just launch a new chain altogether without inheriting all the ethereum mass? And by mass I mean like all the smart contracts, basically the whole ethereum state.
00:15:27.140 - 00:15:40.440, Speaker C: That to me is the thing I just don't understand. Why not just spin off another ethereum classic, give yourself some tokens and go with it, just like so many chains that we launched over the last couple of years.
00:15:40.890 - 00:15:54.986, Speaker A: All right, so out of curiosity, what would you both expect the value to be of these ETH POW tokens afterward? Is it going to be less than 2% of the current value of ETH as the IOUs on these exchanges seem to be indicating?
00:15:55.178 - 00:16:36.010, Speaker B: I think in my opinion right now I'm going to go with the market. And I think that let's say after the first period of like pandemonium and dumping, I think it maybe just equilibrates to about maybe 2%. That would be my guess. But for myself personally, I'm not that interested in buying at fair value or at least short term fair value. I think I might be lightly bid at like one to one and a half percent and then much stronger bid, I think between half a percent and 1%. And that's not to forecast anything about the super long term future but that's kind of levels that I'd be interested in maybe taking a swing at it.
00:16:36.160 - 00:16:39.290, Speaker A: Wait, and when you say that, you mean before the fork?
00:16:40.110 - 00:17:16.022, Speaker B: I meant like after the fork. So like after this initial period of DeFi pandemonium mostly on the POW side but maybe a tiny bit on the POS side. And then once that period ends and then everybody who wants to have dumped POW has dumped it, then I think some kind of natural short term equilibrium price maybe around 2% seems pretty fair. Obviously it could just be wrong. Could just be way higher than that, could be way lower than that. I don't know. But that's kind of what my expectations are just as comparables with etc and things that had happened before.
00:17:16.022 - 00:17:23.978, Speaker B: Other types of forks that have forked off of other tokens. There's not too much to go off of, but that would be sort of finger in the air kind of guesswork there.
00:17:24.144 - 00:17:41.438, Speaker A: So this is fascinating to me because from the way you're talking and maybe I'm wrong, it sounds like you're not interested in buying those ETH POW tokens before the merge until after people begin to dump them once the chain goes live. Is that what you're implying there?
00:17:41.604 - 00:18:01.000, Speaker B: That's generally my thought, but I think if it dumped ahead of time to a low enough level, I would still be interested in buying it. It's just that I don't want to get in front of other people's selling. Even if I wanted to buy it, I'd rather buy it at a cheaper price rather than a more expensive price. So I'm fine to wait for everybody else to go first on.
00:18:02.250 - 00:18:31.710, Speaker A: You know, I'm not a trader, but given everything that you've said earlier, I find that surprising. I would have thought that you were looking to dump in the first few blocks. But while we're talking about that, for both of you, what do you think will happen in the first few blocks? Like I saw, Dan Robinson of Paradigm appears to be figuring this out as well. You asked on Twitter, if the ETH POW fork happens, what will the first few blocks be like? Give me your opinion for both of you.
00:18:31.780 - 00:19:04.230, Speaker B: Maybe we can ask you, if any first. But I just want to clarify one thing, which is that what I was saying about these sort of price levels I'd be willing to buy. It's not related to stuff that we're going to be doing, like on chain and maybe doing some mev to race for certain blocks and to dump certain types of Ethpow, ERC 20s for other Ethpow, ERC 20s or Ethpow itself. That's like a different set of strategies. I meant more for in the midterm where I saw fair value. That's sort of what I meant.
00:19:04.310 - 00:19:08.540, Speaker A: All right, so first few blocks on the Eavespower Fork, what do you guys think?
00:19:09.070 - 00:20:10.330, Speaker C: If it happens like it happens so far and basically they don't freeze up all AMMS, for example, like they wanted to do? I think it's quite possible that a few people will rush and try to sell all the value less assets. Let's call it like this. I think it will take a few more blocks than just first couple of blocks, because I think those first few blocks will be very busy and I think we'll see a lot of competition. This competition will be even more interesting because we wouldn't see normal players like Flashbots, for example, helping out. We wouldn't see a lot of this infra that will suddenly just stop working on proof of work. So people will have to go back to the old ways, figuring out how to actually submit it, how to pay miners properly to do all this stuff, and I don't think a lot of companies can actually figure it out properly. It's quite possible proof of work devs will not do something properly as well, and that actually will be delayed.
00:20:10.330 - 00:20:43.498, Speaker C: So I think this pandemonium will continue for way more than two blocks. Actually, also important part is let's say you have USDC on proof of work. You can only sell your USDC. So if you had, let's say, 100 million USDC and you want to dump it into proof of work ethereum, okay, that's all you can do. But you cannot sell somebody else's USDC and they can still do it a bit later. For example, for really big payment pools which still might have opportunity like this later on.
00:20:43.584 - 00:21:22.886, Speaker B: Yeah, I definitely agree. And maybe to add on to that, I think that you're already starting to see some of this being reflected on the sort of like foreign lending pools where Ave compound oiler, they're all coming out with different statements about what they're going to do. They're all going to treat things a little bit differently. Now, some of it is just that people want the fork token. That's why they're borrowing ETH. And ETH borrow rates are going high. But I think also some of it is that people want to pre collateralize their DeFi debt in a lot of these stable coins which cannot be duplicated across two chains, right? So a lot of people already kind of setting up for this kind of stuff.
00:21:22.886 - 00:22:32.318, Speaker B: I would also say that there are some relative value trades. So let's say that there's like the first period where everybody just dumps everything for Ethpow on the Ethpow chain, but then maybe later, once everything has already kind of been dumped to all these ERC 20s have been dumped to nearly zero. Now, maybe there's some kind of interesting plays that you can do between the ERC 20s, right? Like for example, if I asked you, do you think that CRV one or uni one? Or like, let's say CRV POW or uni POW has more value? At some point both are dumped so low that both are kind of like free options or very cheap options. But even then, between them you can make certain arguments about why one I won't say what I think there, but why one might be worth more than the other, right? So once all the 8th POW has been taken out of the system, people are just kind of waiting for the exchanges to open up deposits to go and sell it. I guess some people would hold onto it just to be fair. Then what's left to do on chain? Maybe there's like a second period after the initial pandemonium, which is like a reshuffling of the relative values of all of these coins. I think.
00:22:32.318 - 00:23:12.726, Speaker B: I did a poll and most people thought that as a ratio of the POW version to the POS version, they thought that Shib would be worth the most, right, compared to some of these other coins. I have some differences of opinion there, but it's possible at least with Shib, it's just not a very fancy token. There's not a lot of knock on effects with DeFi. So it's possible. Maybe they're right about that. Right? But at know, it gives us some things to play around with. While after the initial wave of everything being traded into Ethpow on the POW.
00:23:12.758 - 00:23:57.058, Speaker A: Chain, this is interesting because I'm just realizing that I had never thought about what kind of token ship was, but I'm just realizing it's an ERC 20. So we've been referring to this throughout, but let's just dive into this a little bit further. What have you been seeing people do or are doing in advance to either obtain this AirDrop or trade it? In some ways, some of the things we've been talking about have been the RC 20s. I've seen people talking about moving money from layer twos, moving them from centralized exchanges. You were talking about the futures and how those have traded. What are some of the kind of bigger signals that you've seen in terms of how the market is thinking about this fork?
00:23:57.154 - 00:24:56.120, Speaker B: So I think maybe just answer it in two different ways. The first thing is about whether or not the people preparing for this stuff have a lot of risk appetite or not, right? So if you don't have much risk appetite, probably the safest thing to do, just to dodge as much chaos as possible is to pull all of your assets from the L two S, pull all of your assets out of DFI, whether that's in an AMM or in a lending pool, and kind of like, not have to deal with it. Right. That would be the safest thing to do. Now, I do imagine that that will happen, at least to some degree, in that on chain liquidity will get a bit more shallow. And if that does happen, then there's also all sorts of knock on effects, right? It means that as liquidity gets thinner, then liquidations become more likely. And as long as there is enough fall just naturally induced by the merge, right? So it doesn't even have to do with Ethpal forking, but just from ethereum itself.
00:24:56.120 - 00:25:41.100, Speaker B: On the proof of stake side, if the merge is successful or it's a failure, there could still be a lot of vol, right? Because even on success, some people say, oh, this is a sell to news event. Some people say, oh, now more money is going to pile in, right? So there's going to be a lot of disagreement in the market and I think vol itself will be a bit on the higher side. And this can just cause normal day to day vault maybe won't cause that much in liquidations because it's less and liquidity is bigger and thicker there. But now with liquidity shallowing out and vault increasing, we can see all sorts of things, we can see all sorts of assets, trade really far away from kind of short term fair value. That's I think something to keep in mind.
00:25:42.590 - 00:26:29.960, Speaker C: And the curious thing is you also have the whole macro on top of it, which is still pretty big thing in crypto. So to me the most challenging bit was like it's close to impossible to separate the price of Ethereum as it moves on the merge news from well, all the macro stuff that's happening outside. And so I mean, ethereum can go up 50% or can go down 50% for all kinds of reasons post merge, from that perspective, I think people will get liquidated anyway. It's already their destiny because the Volatility will be really massive either way and maybe it will all cancel out and it will stay like this, maybe it will go up, maybe it will go down, I don't know. But it's going to be very volatile in general.
00:26:30.570 - 00:28:08.246, Speaker B: Yeah, and maybe just to also add to that too some of the other things that I've heard people doing in preparation for the merge. And I don't want to say exactly what we're doing, but some of the things that I've heard, it's like some people think that it makes a lot of sense to borrow up as much ETH as possible and collateralize it with stablecoins just for kind of like this fork value. But other people are saying, well, maybe doing the opposite is better where I'm just lending ETH because the borrow rates are so high, I'm getting compensated a lot just by lending people who want to make this play my ETH, right? And then it goes into how are Compound and Ave going to handle it? Ave is saying that they're just maybe going to pause borrowing lending. Compound is saying why don't we make the maximum interest rate? Maybe I got them confused, but one of them is saying maybe make the maximum interest rate 1000% annualize instead of capping at like 100% for example, right? And then Euler Finance is saying maybe the best course of action is just to do nothing and let things play out. Really hard to say. At least now it does seem like the East POW team is saying that they are not going to freeze things on the DeFi side on their chain. Which I actually think that's actually a pretty good idea because even though they have to go through all of this crazy pandemonium and a lot of liquidations, it's better to kind of rip the band aid off, right? Because you still have the same problem even if you freeze things, because what are you going to do? You're just going to put into withdrawal only mode forever or at some point you're going to reactivate it.
00:28:08.246 - 00:28:31.418, Speaker B: I mean, you're just kind of postponing the problem. I think it's better just to flush everything out as quickly as possible. And if they do think that there is some hope that it works out in the long run, they might as well just get beyond this chapter first. And the miners have to take maybe some losses early on just to mine it, but at least you can kind of get over the hump beforehand.
00:28:31.594 - 00:29:03.962, Speaker C: But they wouldn't take. Any losses. Right, because well, it's actually in their favor to allow this because then people will actually do stuff on proof of work chain. Like if you freeze everything, what are people going to do anyway? Where is it going to make their fees? But now they suddenly have people competing for those executions, paying a lot of that's how they can actually make a lot of ease proof of work for themselves and increase this war chest for later on. So to me that makes perfect sense. Sure.
00:29:04.016 - 00:29:40.578, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's definitely possible. Yeah, I think what I meant by taking losses is that I imagine that maybe some of them were also maybe financing the development of Ethpow. Maybe they're like taking losses in the sense that they actually do believe that their chain will be worth maybe not that much, but more than what the market is showing at 2% right now. Right. So for them it's like they would maybe mine at a loss given the current price and then try and hold it to maybe 4% or 6% or something like that. Right, but I agree, I mean I think in some ways it is more beneficial to them in that there's a lot of activity. I think it's a bit compounded.
00:29:40.578 - 00:30:02.982, Speaker B: I don't think it's obvious whether or not they have to do a little bit of loss leading or whether it's still just like over on that positive. Because even if they freeze it eventually when they unfreeze it, they still get that activity later. Right, so it's like probably it's worth more now than later but it also depends on their own expectations of how they're going to do. Right.
00:30:03.136 - 00:30:22.318, Speaker A: And how are you seeing DeFi users trying to play this? Like, I don't know if you've been watching any of those movements, but do you see that there's certain movements in DeFi where it looks like those people are trying to get the tokens or jump them or whatever on the Ethpal chain when that emerges?
00:30:22.494 - 00:30:41.420, Speaker B: Well, I mean, I think until the fork, it's hard to say what people will do because they can't really do it right now. The only thing that they can do right now is split their ETH and pre sell ETH POW. But for all the on chain stuff and all the know, we just kind of have to wait and see, I figure.
00:30:41.870 - 00:30:54.862, Speaker A: Okay, but you're not seeing any movements like for instance, liquidity pools drying up or just a lot more being created or anything like that, that would indicate there are certain ways people are trying to play that.
00:30:54.996 - 00:31:09.300, Speaker B: What I would say is we've noticed some things I don't want to say exactly. We're so close to the merge, maybe we can I'm happy to always come back on later after the fact to talk about.
00:31:12.710 - 00:31:44.926, Speaker A: Well, you know, this actually leads me to another question that I had for you, which was that as we mentioned earlier, for the Dow hard fork. It was just totally different. Like the community was totally blindsided by the Ethereum Classic chain. And the fact that now you have been so open about this, like you even mentioned that you feel that now the community seems very well prepared for this. But I was just wondering why were you so open about it? Because didn't that sort of cut into any potential profit you might have made from doing these trades in a more kind of like stealth way?
00:31:45.108 - 00:31:45.454, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:31:45.492 - 00:32:20.070, Speaker B: So I want to say that there are a lot of trades that I'd never talked about that we did make. One involving Litecoin actually using that as a hedge. But it's a separate thing. And there's also, I think, a lot of more sort of mechanical plays that I didn't really talk about. The reason that I did talk about a couple of plays right. So two are kind of the same, which is like the st ETH basis widening, the spread widening and then the backwardated futures basis. That was because I think overall I thought that the risk of the merge were greater than zero.
00:32:20.070 - 00:33:12.842, Speaker B: Meaning that initially when I was first talking about it, it seemed like nobody even believed that there would be an Ethpal, right? And then now I think more the consensus has shifted to there will be eventually it'll be worth zero, but there will be at least some ETH pal and at least it'll have some short term value. Right? So I think part of it is just doing a little bit of sort of like raising the alarm that it's a bit alarming that nobody is even talking about this. And the second thing is that I don't think that we as a firm could take up all of the value there on that trade. Right. There's a lot smaller trades where it's sort of like I need to be a little bit more careful about because there's not that much money to be made anyway. Right. So it's not really great to share, I think, for this one, I don't think we could have absorbed everything ourselves, so it wasn't very costly for us to talk about it.
00:33:12.842 - 00:34:10.458, Speaker B: So that's like the first class. And then the second one was about just shorting ETH against Bitcoin and basically we shorted it for about two weeks or so. And that was just because we thought that ETH really just kind of were over their skis a little bit in terms of just how bullish they were about ETH. I later thought that maybe Doge would have been a better hedge than Bitcoin because I also have some concerns about the Gox coins being released. I mean, it really is just a bad time for Bitcoin, right? Like, on one hand, the government wants to regulate from, in an ESG way, the mining stuff and then ETH is going through this merge narrative and then on top of that, the Gox coins are getting released. Right. So Idiosyncratically, normally we like using Bitcoin as a beta hedge to the crypto space, but I think this time around, maybe Litecoin would have been better or Dogecoin would have been better, even though there's all sorts of idiosyncratic behavior there too.
00:34:10.458 - 00:34:42.166, Speaker B: So for that trade, we also closed it out after two weeks. And I also thought that that was something that we couldn't take all of the alpha ourselves. And I thought it was relevant to also say that it's not just about Ethpow. Right? Like, the fact that Ethpal will exist I thought was not being properly priced in by the market. People should know. But also, I think the fact that everybody's super bullish into the merge I thought was also a little bit scary. And I think it's a lot healthier now, which is why I actually closed out the position.
00:34:42.166 - 00:35:12.958, Speaker B: It's because at least people are talking about that it is possible that the merge is not ultra bullish for Ether. Right. And I think really, I just wanted that kind of concession. Right? It could still be. But I think if all of the chatter on Twitter and the entire narrative is like, 99% of people are talking about how this is just going to be up, only that is very dangerous. And it's a little bit reminiscent in flavor to the narrative surrounding Luna. And I don't want to make it sound like Etha is anything close to Luna.
00:35:12.958 - 00:35:31.670, Speaker B: I mean, Luna is like, infinitely worse, right? But at least this kind of groupthink and consensus like this monoculture of Only feels very dangerous. And obviously ETH is less reflexive and less bad than Luna overall, but still, it had a similar flavor, and I thought that was dangerous.
00:35:32.410 - 00:36:09.358, Speaker A: Yeah, a lot of insight there, which I agree, and that's why I run the kind of show that isn't just pro any particular coin in this space. But anyway, okay, so there's a lot still that I feel like I was trying to ask you guys that we didn't get to unpack. We're going to unpack that also talk about things like replay protection or replay attacks and then go into ETH. Itself, because that is the major asset that will be affected by the merge.

So we've referred to these things a few times now, but I just want to make sure we explain this to people. So, Kevin, you mentioned the Steeth price widening, I guess, in relation to ETH. Can you just talk about what you saw there and what that indicates about how people are thinking about the merge?
00:38:38.014 - 00:39:19.982, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think that spreads actually come in a little bit. We still do have that position on, but the original idea on why it would widen is that what's the difference between St ETH and ETH, right? One is that St ETH gets some kind of staking yield, two, it's more illiquid, and then three, it's not going to get the proof of work fork, right. So those are like the three main differences right now. On the proof of work side, that's just whatever the value of the proof of work chain is, right, which is the market is saying like 1.8% or whatever it is today. I haven't looked. And then on the sort of yield versus illiquidity side, I was pricing that roughly at like 2%.
00:39:19.982 - 00:39:32.674, Speaker B: So I think St e should be like the sum of 2% and whatever the ETH POW fork is worth. Right. And that was kind of my baseline mental model of what the fair value of St e is.
00:39:32.792 - 00:39:42.146, Speaker A: Evgeny, do you want to talk about what you were seeing with the futures market and what that indicated about how people were thinking about trading the ultimately.
00:39:42.338 - 00:40:31.698, Speaker C: Just like Kevin said, the markets are pretty efficient. Like state ease discount reflected the futures markets and what we see is interest on average. It's also highly correlated on that. We even seen people smashing the funds on perpetuals even though it doesn't make as much sense because it obviously can change significantly more and will much closer to the merge. So it's just stuff that happens in a trading world that must happen. So it's not esoteric by any means, it just must happen. I think with staked Ethereum there was a bit of effect on top of it that there are other stake products and there is often a relative value play buying some of them.
00:40:31.698 - 00:41:12.674, Speaker C: Another of them like Coinbase just released their stake product as well. So there are quite a lot of plays that can be done with it. And I think also one thing that I wanted to touch upon is this idea I find really interesting. This idea that okay, let's say it's 2%, let's say proof of work Ethereum is 2%. I don't think it's such a big deal to a degree primarily because I don't think there is a bit in all this like okay, there is a bit of a bit. I don't know, maybe Kevin will beat like 0.5%, winter Mute will beat like zero point 25% because why not? Some other people will bid as well.
00:41:12.674 - 00:41:50.222, Speaker C: But ultimately all of us are doing it for really short term and at some point if it goes to 10%, that's where you will see Serum Foundation selling, that's where you will see a lot of exchanges selling. That's where you will see a lot of market makers selling. So currently there is a massive and visible offer which will not disappear primarily because it just doesn't make sense for most people to sell 2%. It's just not worth it. It's almost a free option you get it cost you 2%. But the upside is bizarre. So it just makes sense to wait it out.
00:41:50.222 - 00:42:28.700, Speaker C: And it's especially true for all this CRV one or uni one tokens which are also kevin asked me can I show him an offer? It doesn't really make sense for us to sell them at ten basis points or five basis points because okay, if they can't go to 1% of uni because some people think they have value for whatever reason, that's the money we can potentially make. And so it really doesn't make sense to sell your assets like basis point on the dollar. It just makes sense to wait. But it also creates this fake illusion of something having value which it actually.
00:42:29.470 - 00:43:22.110, Speaker B: So you know, I think I mostly agree with what yvgene said but I would have a different opinion about what constitutes something having value. As we've seen just in the past two days, luna classic pumped like crazy. I would certainly say that this chain has virtually no value overnight. It kind of just pumped like 100%. And now Luna too basically Luna itself is pumping that also doesn't have too much right. And then just in the history of crypto, how much value is there in a lot of these coins? Right? I think a lot of it is just kind of like belief in a thing, like in a GameStop kind of way, right. And I think a lot of it is also pulling very speculative future worlds to the present.
00:43:22.110 - 00:44:12.450, Speaker B: Right? It's sort of like, let's say almost all the value of Ethpow. Is now maybe contingent on ETH POS completely and utterly failing and then them having a really strong narrative or maybe not even that strong, but much stronger than now kind of narrative. Right. If the chance of ETH POS completely failing is like, let's say and I'm talking about like catastrophic problems, not like minor bugs and they'll probably have minor bugs, it'll all be fine, right? But really just like it just doesn't work. They have to roll back the chain or there's really critical consensus failures or some kind of double spin or the network itself completely forks and requires meat space coordination to resolve properly. Maybe that's like around, let's say 3%. And then if that happens, then let's say the narrative for Ethpal.
00:44:12.450 - 00:44:55.318, Speaker B: Improves. Like, let's say five X, right? So that's a road for them to get to some kind of meaningful percent, at least in the medium term. Because when all is said and done and after Ethpow. Has been completely hollowed out, it's basically like how ETH. Is today. Right? And I think that they can make that as a much more convincing argument if the narrative all of a sudden shifts to that. The Ethereum Foundation for eight years have been building this thing and in the end, when they delivered, it didn't work, right? If the narrative really because when people get pissed on Twitter, they get really pissed and when the mob gets awoken, they bring out the torches.
00:44:55.318 - 00:45:34.870, Speaker B: So we've seen former sort of like leaders of projects have their entire community turn on them and kind of get burned at the stake and crucified. I would not put it past that to happen in ETH. If something really bad happened, right? Not some kind of minor problems. So I do see that first that this is kind of a massive call option on possibly something like that happening. And then the second is that if we actually look at what it is, it's basically unforked ETH. And how it works today, but where a lot of stuff has to get dumped and liquidated and hollowed out. So kind of like what you were saying, Evgeny.
00:45:34.870 - 00:46:16.846, Speaker B: It's Like Starting a new chain, but there's no Kind of foundation treasury. And you have to deal with a lot of Pain in the short term, but it's kind of like A vampire attack, because you put the coins into the hands of the People who were using the Product in exactly the types of ways that they Were using It before. And they get exactly the kind of, ERC, twenty s that they had before. Right. And I don't even think it's particularly bad for the Ethereum Foundation in that it's almost kind of like an insurance policy, right. In case things are catastrophic, then there is something there. Now, obviously, I think they would just roll back the chain.
00:46:16.846 - 00:46:34.618, Speaker B: I'm not actually particularly worried about, let's say, St ETH in the long run. Right. There could be some liquidations in the short run because we've already seen social consensus work with in that Keith kind of beat out, etc. Right. Like ideological purity didn't matter that much. Social consensus mattered more, devs mattered more. Right.
00:46:34.618 - 00:47:10.162, Speaker B: So their strongest and most true believers are the ones that have st e. They're not going to let those guys take losses on their bags if something that's really bad happens and they're going to bail them out. Right. And I think at this point it's a lot less bad than I think, the ETH classic days, because the first kind of change to code is like not law is much more boolean, I think, than the second one because it's already been done in the past and I think it makes sense for them to do that. If I was them, I would definitely do that. Right. So I think there's a lot of these kinds of considerations.
00:47:10.306 - 00:47:58.994, Speaker A: I have to say. I think the main way that I would differ from you on that is the percentage at which you think there will be a spectacular failure. So we'll see what happens. They've had so many successful tests and they have multiple clients, so we'll see. But one thing I did want to ask you before we get into things around just ETH itself, so we talked about how there might be replay attacks. Can you just talk a little bit about so if there are people out there who are thinking about trading this, what are you seeing that they're maybe doing to either protect themselves because at this moment, it looks quite likely that there will be. Given that this Eve POW team hasn't really done the necessary technical work to split the chains.
00:47:58.994 - 00:48:06.246, Speaker A: So are you seeing people protect themselves in one way or another or how are you guys doing it?
00:48:06.348 - 00:49:30.654, Speaker C: Well, just like with the Dow of work, the main players who can be affected by it a lot are exchanges and I think they are prepared for it. Well, all the big, all like tier one, tier two ones, I would say are definitely prepared for it and they will simply not going to well, they will be very careful with their withdrawal functions basically simply because of that. But another one, and it's a really interesting one aspect of ripple attacks that we looked on our side is basically related to basically all the spenddemonium that will happen on proof of work chain. And basically what can potentially happen is, let's say I have 100 million USDC. I sell it all on the east proof of work and go and sell it on poloniax later on. Great, maybe I'll make like a few hundred k, who knows? But what happens if the chain ID is the same and replace attacks are possible? Is somebody can like, if I have the same state on proof of stake chain, somebody can replace that and screw me over big time because I will suddenly sell 100 million of real USDC against ethereum proof of stake. And then suddenly I'm doing like a really bad trade potentially for me because I'm doing something really big that will potentially move the price and that can be scary.
00:49:30.702 - 00:49:51.980, Speaker A: Can I just ask you, I don't understand your example because Circle or USDC already came out and said that they're not going to support the east proof of work chain because obviously, since it's backed by real assets, you can't just magically suddenly double all those. So were you just making that up as an example or I didn't understand how this could be an example.
00:49:52.510 - 00:50:16.958, Speaker C: So if I do this transaction on proof of work, trying to basically get this free ethereum proof of work from my valueless USDC, this transaction will have transaction hash and everything. So somebody can use the same transaction and replay it on proof of stake chain and execute exactly the same transaction.
00:50:17.134 - 00:50:21.060, Speaker A: Right? Yeah, because there's no replay protection. Oh, I get what you're saying.
00:50:24.310 - 00:51:11.060, Speaker C: Profiting from it is kind of more difficult. But you can screw a lot of people potentially, and let's say I sell 100 million of uniswap, for example, into proof of work. That will move uniswap price a lot. And you can position yourself on the other side buying this uniswap really cheap on proof of stake, for example. So that can be like one fun thing to do, and it can be one fun thing that people can on one hand try to profit from or if they're really malicious just trying to bankrupt big trading companies, for example. So for us, it was one of those, like, what can go really wrong if this stuff happens and you can protect yourself against it, but it's quite a fun one.
00:51:11.590 - 00:51:14.980, Speaker A: How are you protecting yourself against it?
00:51:15.830 - 00:51:51.760, Speaker C: Well, the most easy way to protect yourself is not to do this transaction on proof of work chain in the first place. That's probably the easiest. Well, because then there is nothing to replay other ways is because it's a state, right? So the state should be the same. So basically, if you during the first block, you move all your USDC from one of wallet to another, and then during the second block, you sell this USDC on proof of work chain, nobody can replay it because you don't have any USDC on proof of stake anymore. So that's like another way you can do it and protect yourself.
00:51:52.470 - 00:51:55.650, Speaker A: And would this apply also to NFTs?
00:51:58.150 - 00:51:59.922, Speaker C: It can apply to anything, really?
00:51:59.976 - 00:52:20.280, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, because like OpenSea said, they wouldn't support the ETH proof of work chain. You just imagine there might be some people who in the NFT world, they may not know what a replay attack is. Hopefully they'll figure it out and not do anything that would cause them problems.
00:52:20.670 - 00:52:21.082, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:52:21.136 - 00:52:48.930, Speaker B: And maybe just to also add to that, there's a way of splitting your coins pre fork too. Like there are certain contracts out there they haven't been audited. I'm not vouching that they work or not, but basically they figured out a way that on chain, you can detect which chain you're on and for each side of the two split coins to be only valid on, it's basically a contract that allows you to split your coins beforehand.
00:52:49.430 - 00:53:25.514, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah. And I just want to make clear, nothing we're saying in the episode is advice for anyone, financial or trading investment advice for anyone. Okay. So we've been talking so much about the potential trading of the proof of workfork and meanwhile, ETH really is the asset that will probably be most affected by let's, you know, zoom out and let's talk just generally about what's going to be happening here. Kevin, you have actually talked about how you are long you believe in ETH. I think that's why a lot of people were not really happy with your comments.
00:53:25.514 - 00:53:42.290, Speaker A: But why don't we just sort of talk generally about what kind of price action do you see run emerge? What do you think will happen in terms of potential issues around selling the news? And then long term, where do you think the price of ETH will go because of this news event, assuming it's successful?
00:53:42.630 - 00:54:31.026, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think it depends on a couple of things and I just want to clarify. Yeah, so I do hold a little bit ETH myself that's just been there for a long time. But that being said, there have been periods that as a firm, we have both been long ETH and we've also been short ETH and also most of the time just flat ETH. So I just wanted to clarify that overall, if the merge is successful, I think that initially, probably just from the hype and just from the celebration, probably a little bit more money is going to pile in. But I think right now, anybody who really likes ETH is already kind of in ETH. I find there to be very few people kind of like on the sidelines that are kind of neutral about this and want to see how it plays out and then to go along. I think for the most part, people even on the fence have mostly bought into the narrative and then there's like a set of detractors who will just never buy this thing no matter what happens.
00:54:31.026 - 00:55:28.790, Speaker B: So I think really the lines are kind of drawn already there and I don't really see the price getting bought up to really crazy heights. Now there are some counterarguments to this. Like for example that the inflation supply issuance is going to get reduced by a lot 99%, 90% and that will help things on the supply kind of overhang side. But I think a lot of price action is mostly driven by demand anyway. So really the question is who are going to be the new buyers? We know that there's a lot of people who are kind of like it depends on the demographic of true believers and who can be converted to be a true believer after the merge is successful versus how much mercenary capital was piling into the long merge trade to begin with, who will then look to exit for new opportunities in whatever the new narrative is. So if the former is greater then the price should go up. If the latter is greater then the price should go down.
00:55:28.790 - 00:55:33.942, Speaker B: That would be what my guess is on whether this is a sell the news event or not.
00:55:34.076 - 00:55:36.722, Speaker A: Evgeny, what do you I mean it's.
00:55:36.786 - 00:56:12.142, Speaker C: In general quite interesting that we are both here because our firms are both trading, but we're kind of doing very different things in a way. Because if you listen to Kevin, it's long, ethereum, short, dogecoin, all those kind of plays. While for us it's much more on the automation side. Just making sure that we can just provide markets continuously throughout the day. We typically don't hold long term views on things. We do hold some tokens as part of our venture portfolio. We do hold some tokens like Ethereum and Bitcoin as part of our treasury.
00:56:12.142 - 00:57:05.486, Speaker C: Effectively. It's not something that can ever make us go bankrupt or even jeopardize our operations but it's something we felt was the right thing to do. Although it didn't really work out last nine months or so. But we have okay, but I think for us the interest in senna is just how to react to different things as they happen. So we are much more preparing. We are not really positioning ourselves to go Long East or Shorties or doing things like this but we are thinking, okay, how us and our algorithms will react to certain things. And for example, one thing that we've been debating internally is are we going to be looking at proof of work Ethereum price? And what we kind of decided is not really because first of all nobody can say what Ethereum theoretical price is at any moment because it's just so many variables.
00:57:05.486 - 00:57:46.610, Speaker C: But if proof of work goes to 10% of ease it's not going to be a selling signal for us, for Ethereum because we do see proof of work as much more of a meme coins than anything else at this stage. And I mean the trade that we would be doing with it is we'd be looking at it trading against Ethereum Classic for example, or maybe against some other chains. But in terms of positioning it would be wait and see. But. Position ourselves for massive volatility, basically for the first few months. And just like I mentioned, focus on how the Mev game will change provided that the merge happened successfully.
00:57:47.750 - 00:58:23.690, Speaker B: Yeah, and maybe I could just add something to that. I think a lot of what I've been talking about recently has been more about sort of these long, short trades, mostly hedged, some directional, sort of like mid frequency, maybe fundamental type plays. That's actually mostly not what we do. Actually. We actually also do quite a bit of algo trading, and not to the extent that Winter Mute does. I mean, I know that Winter Mute is one of the big behemoths in algo trading across DFI and CFI. I think you guys have like two of the top 30 accounts on FTX in volume.
00:58:23.690 - 00:58:56.726, Speaker B: For us. We're much smaller. We're at maybe about top 80 right now on FTX. But we also do have a lot of stuff where we're also doing market making. We're also doing a little bit of HFT trading. But I figure that's not going to be as interesting for the topic at hand. So I wanted to sort of just talk about things maybe that are more relevant to the viewers and things that they might want to think about and not financial advice, but maybe some things that might impact them and that they would think about.
00:58:56.726 - 00:59:03.660, Speaker B: But I'm also happy to also talk about order book dynamics and Q positions and tick sizes and that sort of thing too.
00:59:04.110 - 00:59:37.990, Speaker A: We're going to take it in a different direction because we're sort of running out of time. And I did want to ask, we kind of talked about the narrative around Bitcoin and how there's a lot of news that has been challenging for Bitcoin recently. But in addition, ETH's issuance will go way down after the merge. It may even become deflationary. So how do you think this affects the narrative around Bitcoin, which traditionally has been thought of as digital gold? It has this digital scarcity. And so if ETH is even more deflationary, how does that affect.
00:59:42.010 - 01:00:26.162, Speaker B: To say I wanted to draw the Luna classic example, but I'm not sure what side this supports. Right, so, like, on one hand, Lunacy basically is introducing an on chain transaction tax, right? Making it actually deflationary. And I made the joke on Twitter that, oh, ludacy must now be ultrasound money. Well, obviously the point that I was trying to make is that just because something's deflationary doesn't make it sound right. Like, if you tack on like, a 1.5% transaction tax on Lunacy, does it really make it that much better? I mean, this thing is kind of garbage, right? But that being said, what the market said is that it really liked it and actually Lunacy just pumped on that news. Right.
01:00:26.162 - 01:00:41.210, Speaker B: I don't know how much of that is sustaining. I think it's fallen off a bit since then. But the market really liked that news the idea of just like imposing a 1.5% transaction tax on chain. Right. So on one hand, I do feel like fundamentally this makes no sense. You can't just move around some numbers.
01:00:41.210 - 01:01:20.710, Speaker B: Just because something is deflationary doesn't mean that especially something that is so in crypto in general, that is so demand driven doesn't just make it pump in price. But on the other hand, the market is actually saying, well, maybe just this cosmetic change is actually really good for the price. So I actually have very mixed feelings about it. I think before the whole Lunacy pump, I was thinking, well, I think maybe it goes up a little bit because of the supply effect, but maybe not too much. But now maybe I'm kind of revising my opinion. Now just given what's happening with Lunacy and Luna really hard to say. I'm constantly kind of reevaluating what the market is telling me.
01:01:20.710 - 01:01:31.562, Speaker B: Whether I think that's sensible or not doesn't matter as much. I think it's more about what does the market believe and I need to figure out how it's thinking about things.
01:01:31.616 - 01:01:38.970, Speaker A: Right, but how do you think this will affect bitcoin? Do you think that the price will be boosted to the detriment of bitcoin?
01:01:39.390 - 01:02:17.522, Speaker B: I think at this point there's not that many new people to be won over. From the bitcoin camp to the ETH camp, the camps are basically set. I don't think there's many people on the fence and things have already gotten very polarized. So I don't think that it's to the detriment of bitcoin per se in the short term. In the long term it could be, I think just as a competitor to bitcoin, but I would still say that right now the thing that probably impacts bitcoin the most is its own idiosyncratic events, right. So things like the Gox coin overhang, right. If that wasn't there, then I think that's a much bigger primary effect than what's going on with ethereum.
01:02:17.522 - 01:02:44.382, Speaker B: But I do think in the long term, especially in maybe like a bull market or a couple of cycles down the line, they're going to have to battle. Right. Once everybody has adopted crypto, then along the borders, there's a lot more fighting for territory. Right. And this is sort of why bear markets are very PvP, because everybody sees the pie shrinking and there's no way to get a bigger pie. So everybody tries to take everybody else's pie. Right.
01:02:44.382 - 01:03:07.634, Speaker B: But in a bull market that's not the case. The pie itself is growing. Generally there's less infighting, everything grows, but eventually it grows to a point. Right. In the success case of crypto that there's full adoption, worldwide adoption, and at that point, finally the lines are drawn and then there has to be a lot of this kind of competition. So that's kind of how I see things in the different timeframes.
01:03:07.762 - 01:03:10.838, Speaker A: Evgeny, what about you? What do you think about how this affects bitcoin?
01:03:11.014 - 01:03:35.682, Speaker C: I would say very similar. I don't see people switching from bitcoin to Ethereum. It's more like the narrative can change so much that the future people will more likely buy Ethereums and bitcoin. So it's more about that. It's about all the new people that will eventually buy one another, because you cannot buy both. You need to make a choice. Or maybe they'll buy Solana or maybe they buy something else that is not issued yet.
01:03:35.682 - 01:04:22.046, Speaker C: So it's all about this. But I don't think Ethereum will replace bitcoin completely. I think they're still playing very different use cases because bitcoin is all about the most basic blockchain algorithms there is, which works, which is, well, arguably the most decentralized cryptocurrency out there compared to pretty much everything else. And it works, right? So many external shocks, like banning bitcoin mining in one country another, like all kinds of things, it still works. People are still buying it. And yes, we can have mongox, we can have, I don't know, Sailor being liquidated because of that. There can be a lot of fun events happening.
01:04:22.046 - 01:04:56.618, Speaker C: But ultimately, I think it has a brand. It is the first cryptocurrency that was and just because of that, I think it will have pretty consistent value. And as for Ethereum, it's just different because it's this virtual machine, it has DeFi in it. I don't really understand, like well, I guess for me personally, I don't understand why people think Ethereum can be such a great store of value. It's more like oil to me, I guess, however cliche as it sounds. So it's like oil to bitcoin gold. I guess.
01:04:56.704 - 01:05:00.330, Speaker B: I just want to say I completely agree with Genny's sentiments there.
01:05:00.400 - 01:05:45.050, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah. Arthur Hayes was saying similar things when I interviewed him recently. And last question I wanted to ask about this news that the White House recently said they're concerned about the environmental impact of proof of work mining. And I wondered again how you thought this could affect that kind of I don't want to call it a competition because I agree with you that bitcoin and Ether are actually just different things with different purposes. But obviously, as you said, people will come into the space, especially newbies, they're going to be kind of looking at them maybe more just like as investments or whatever. And so I wondered how you felt that the change in the Ethereum consensus algorithm towards something that's more environmentally friendly would affect, again, the narratives between these two coins.
01:05:46.030 - 01:06:59.220, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think it really depends on how the ETH people want to play it and whether or not they're going to take this as an opportunity to try and take market share from bitcoin. Because I do think that the narrative on this favors them pretty strongly with obviously proof of stake requiring a lot less energy, especially during a time where energy there's energy issues around the world. And you can make a case that maybe that energy would be quote unquote, better spent on heating homes and growing food or whatever, all these other things, right? So I think the ball is in their court on what they want to do. I don't particularly mind the moral argument. Like if they were to say that ESG is just better for the planet, it's good overall. I think what I don't particularly like is if they would try, and I always consider a lot of the disputes within crypto to be like family affairs, right? Like for the most part we all disagree with each other, but at the end of the day we're all like crypto heads together, right, against the outside world, against fiat money, that sort of thing. So I think that overall I've supported Tornado Cash and the developments that are going on there.
01:06:59.220 - 01:07:44.302, Speaker B: I think that whether or not ETH is a security, I don't think that the bitcoiner should go down that road. Right? And I also don't think that the Ethereum guy should go down the road of trying to have state actors enforce against proof of work. I think the best situation is just have an open market, have everybody just fight on an equal playing field and then may the best coin win. I think you can make moral arguments. I don't even mind Ethereum guys doing that. I think it's another thing to kind of have like an appeal to a great authority with a monopoly on violence to try and enforce against your competition and to try and limit the scope of their competition. I think that would be less healthy for the space in the long run.
01:07:44.302 - 01:08:38.770, Speaker B: And I think that it's important that at a time like now that at least there is some level of camaraderie within the crypto space. Which is also why I think tactically for the ETH guys, it's better for them to focus on the Tech thesis and then subvert Bitcoin on the money thesis much later, rather than fighting Bitcoin on the money thesis while already having won the Tech thesis, causing a lot of reaction from the Bitcoin maximalists to then go attack Ethereum. I think it's a lot better to have some kind of truce there so that a greater war can be fought and then later on can deal with that issue. I mean, Ethereum can always make the argument that US equities are in total worth more than gold, right, than the market cap of gold. I think that is a perfectly fair argument to make. If they want to say they want to have US. Equities plus the market capitalization of gold, I think that that is fair.
01:08:38.770 - 01:08:41.780, Speaker B: But I don't think that that's tactically correct.
01:08:42.470 - 01:08:44.606, Speaker A: Interesting. Kenny?
01:08:44.718 - 01:09:49.634, Speaker C: Yeah, look, I'm pretty much 100% agree. One thing I guess I want to say for the yeah, I mean, it's totally political what's going on and it's just part of continuation of this ESG narrative that has been there for quite some years now. I'm personally hoping for the record that this ESG narrative will wither and die, because I think the way it's implemented, the way it's affecting how people invest their money in mid space, I think it's very stupid. There are way more smarter ways how you can affect the change on this environment and everything, and banning bitcoin is not the way to approach it. Banning bitcoin is not going to make our planet greener. If you think about it properly, you'll understand that. So I think I fully agree that as crypto community, we should go get together and just not use those kind of occasions to destroy our opponents.
01:09:49.634 - 01:09:51.180, Speaker C: It's like, very simple.
01:09:52.030 - 01:10:08.560, Speaker A: Okay, well, this has been a fascinating note to end this conversation on, given that I do think certain members of the Ethereum community would say that you're fomenting chaos for them. But anyway, before we go, where can people learn more about each of you and your work?
01:10:09.650 - 01:10:13.550, Speaker B: I'm on Twitter at Galwa underscore capital.
01:10:13.890 - 01:10:25.394, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm on Twitter as well. It's my first name, last name Yevgeni Gayway, and that's mostly when I'm writing stuff. I sometimes write articles, but it's not as frequent as I would like to.
01:10:25.592 - 01:10:36.870, Speaker A: All right, well, this has been so fun. We will see what happens next week. I'm definitely excited for the merge. Thank you again. It's been a pleasure having you both on Unchained.
