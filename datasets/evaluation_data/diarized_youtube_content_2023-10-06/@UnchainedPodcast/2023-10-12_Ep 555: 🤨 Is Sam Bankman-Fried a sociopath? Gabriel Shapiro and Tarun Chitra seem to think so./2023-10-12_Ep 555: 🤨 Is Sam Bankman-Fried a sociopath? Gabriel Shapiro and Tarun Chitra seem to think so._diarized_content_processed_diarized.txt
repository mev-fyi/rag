00:00:00.090 - 00:00:44.740, Speaker A: I just think he was a sociopath, quite honestly. I mean, that's Martin Scarelli's take, for what it's worth. Who, you may argue, takes one to. No, but he sort of read Michael Lewis's book and distilled the important parts of it, but interprets the facts very differently from Michael Lewis and essentially says, yeah, we're dealing with almost like a natural born criminal sociopath here. He just happened to focus his efforts on crypto, and I think the trial is sort of bearing that out. So far, the defense is not really finding much to really hang their hat on here, at least as they're limited to merely cross examining witnesses and so forth. We'll see how they do when they present their case.
