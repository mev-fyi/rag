00:00:02.010 - 00:00:05.230, Speaker A: Yeah, I can see the countdown. Very professional.
00:00:06.210 - 00:00:31.490, Speaker B: Hi, y'all, laura here. We're trying something new at Unchained. We'll be doing live streams every other week of a new show called the Chopping Block between four crypto investors. Haseeb Qureshi and Tom Schmidt, managing partners at Dragonfly Cup. Sorry. May, managing Partners at Dragonfly Capital. And Robert Leshner and Tarun Chitra, managing Partners at Robot Ventures.
00:00:31.490 - 00:01:12.210, Speaker B: In each episode, Haseeb, Tom, Robert and Tarun will discuss recent events in crypto. We will also release these conversations on the podcast so you can always tune in later. But the live streams will be the earliest you can catch the shows. And in general, the videos will have all the visual content, whereas the podcasts will obviously only be audio. I've already watched a few of their discussions and they're fun. Plus, they give you a wealth of insight into the many happenings in the space. I just wanted to pop in why, number one, there's a live stream going on and number two, why I am not a part of it.
00:01:12.210 - 00:01:16.630, Speaker B: So with that done, now I will turn it over to Haseeb.
00:01:17.370 - 00:01:41.258, Speaker A: Thanks, Laura. And thanks for chaperoning making sure that we're behaving ourselves. Have a great without further ado, let's kick off the show. So, hey, everybody, welcome to the chopping block. Every couple of weeks, the four of us get together and we give an industry insider's perspective on the crypto topics of the day. So, quick round of intros. I'll start with Tom.
00:01:41.258 - 00:01:44.938, Speaker A: Tom is the DeFi maven and the master of memes. Whoa.
00:01:45.114 - 00:01:46.270, Speaker C: Did you just jiggle?
00:01:46.770 - 00:01:49.582, Speaker D: No, there's a little power surge over here. So sorry about that.
00:01:49.636 - 00:01:50.190, Speaker A: Wow.
00:01:50.340 - 00:01:52.750, Speaker E: You say his name and the DeFi.
00:01:53.410 - 00:01:54.750, Speaker D: It was intentional.
00:01:55.750 - 00:02:12.326, Speaker A: You got your own light show going on over there. Then we've got Robert, cryptoconnosur and captain of compound. Robert is also, for whatever reason, he's hanging out in a little girl's bedroom for reasons that he cannot fully explain. Where I podcast. What's that?
00:02:12.508 - 00:02:15.526, Speaker E: It's where I podcast it.
00:02:15.628 - 00:02:35.690, Speaker A: That's your studio. That's your studio. And then we've got Tarun, the gigabrain and grand Poohba at Gauntlet. And lastly, there is myself, Haseeb. I am chief hype man at Dragonfly. So the four of us are early stage investors in crypto. But I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice or legal advice or even life advice.
00:02:35.690 - 00:02:50.734, Speaker A: So taking everything you hear here with a grain of salt because it's crypto and you should do your own research. How is everybody doing today? Also, Tom, you just got back from Taiwan. How is it being back in America after spending all of COVID in Taiwan?
00:02:50.862 - 00:03:12.634, Speaker D: Yeah, it's been mixed, I would say. I obviously like the COVID situation a bit better in Taiwan, but it's nice being back, know, seeing my friends and family and eating Mexican food and I'm feeling, this is not my office, but I got the very patriotic poster in the background. So people always ask me about that. It's Bruce Springsteen. So anyway, it's good to be nice.
00:03:12.752 - 00:03:16.170, Speaker A: Nice. And overall, verdict on Taiwan?
00:03:17.550 - 00:03:33.102, Speaker D: Taiwan a little bit over a year. Yeah, taiwan number one. It's number one for a reason. Yeah, it's awesome. There's a great crypto scene there and it's really blossoming. A lot of cool new projects coming out and a lot of great entrepreneurs and people are just really great. Food is amazing.
00:03:33.102 - 00:03:40.178, Speaker D: It's beautiful. I have nothing but good things to say. I really miss Taiwan. I'm hopefully going to go back next year as nice.
00:03:40.344 - 00:03:45.010, Speaker A: Nice. And overall, guys, how's been your holidays?
00:03:46.390 - 00:03:56.150, Speaker E: Well, new year's is in two days and I'm about to get away for a very short r and r and so we'll see soon. But happy new year to everybody in advance.
00:03:57.610 - 00:03:58.022, Speaker A: Nice.
00:03:58.076 - 00:03:58.294, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:03:58.332 - 00:04:00.200, Speaker C: Everyone I know has COVID. So.
00:04:04.430 - 00:04:33.058, Speaker A: Honestly, so I could not get a booster because all of the places that give booster shots here are super backed up. So I am kind of terrified of omicron. I actually took a flight a few days ago and I did not get sick. I think maybe I'm asymptomatic, but at this point I think so many people I know have omicron or recently got omicron that it just feels to me like everybody is going to get this thing. It's just like going to be the end.
00:04:33.224 - 00:04:35.170, Speaker C: This is going to be how it ends.
00:04:35.510 - 00:04:39.160, Speaker A: It might well be. It might well be. That's how it seems right now.
00:04:40.330 - 00:05:19.970, Speaker E: Here's my dark contrarian take on COVID and then we can go straight into the crypto stuff. I think that COVID in a twisted way, is actually pro crypto. And it goes to the argument that I think a lot of people are losing faith in governments based on the response or miss response to COVID in general. And distrust in governments equals a search for alternate approaches, whether it's monetary systems or government forms of communication and consensus. And I think long term, this will be one major footnote in the history of why crypto succeeded.
00:05:21.990 - 00:05:57.070, Speaker A: I could see that. I remember early when COVID first started being it was really not obvious at that time how COVID was going to affect crypto. And in retrospect, I feel like maybe it shouldn't have been should have been obvious that crypto, that everybody being at home and just being really antsy and bored and going half crazy was going to cause a lot of was going to be very bullish for everything going on in crypto. But I totally agree with you that in retrospect, so many of the trends that COVID kicked off have been really, really good for the adoption and the growth of the crypto industry.
00:05:57.650 - 00:06:20.520, Speaker D: Yeah, even just living online, being digital, right. The fact that fundraising and team building and everything that we do now is happening remotely was not a given three or four years ago. Certainly some people were pushing for remote work and remote investment, but people used to fly to the Bay Area to do all their fundraising grounds, and it was weird to have a remote team. And now that's almost kind of becoming more the.
00:06:22.810 - 00:06:35.770, Speaker C: You'Ll you may you may always see me say this on Twitter, but I am so happy that Crypto and COVID killed San Francisco. One, two, sucker punch.
00:06:36.510 - 00:06:37.674, Speaker D: It was great.
00:06:37.872 - 00:07:24.534, Speaker A: It's true. I mean, we recently did our team offsite for Dragonfly, and it used to be that, like, 30% to 40% of all of our entrepreneurs were in the Bay Area. And during our offsite, we invited a bunch of entrepreneurs there. And we're now down to like, less than 10% of all of our founders are in the Bay. And I just don't know that it's going to come back. So it does feel like the world has fundamentally changed and the allocation of capital has fundamentally changed. And I don't think it's going to revert now that all of that intellectual capital, all of that sort of movement freedom, and the inability to extract rents from forcing everybody to be in the same place and pay the same landlords and pay the same coffee shops and pay the same taxes, all that is kind of gone now.
00:07:24.534 - 00:07:44.878, Speaker A: And so many I mean, even out of York, like, I just heard that there's a lot of folks leaving New York now and going to Miami for similar lesions. People have realized, like, okay, the Bit license and the New York State tax is just like so onerous, as long as we have the Crypto people together, we don't really need all the other stuff that is bundled with living in New York. I don't know.
00:07:44.884 - 00:08:01.042, Speaker C: To have you been to Miami and found anyone who isn't an investor in Crypto? Where's Waldo? Their office is in New York. They have an office in Soho?
00:08:01.106 - 00:08:01.720, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:08:02.330 - 00:08:04.146, Speaker A: Oh, I thought they got up and moved.
00:08:04.178 - 00:08:17.034, Speaker C: There's like 30 people in that office. No, he's traveling a lot, but he might be the exception. What I'm saying is I see that maybe, like, the investor or the CEO is moving to Miami, but the teams are not.
00:08:17.152 - 00:08:17.530, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:08:17.600 - 00:08:20.890, Speaker A: My bet was that the first go ahead, Tom. Go ahead.
00:08:21.040 - 00:08:41.970, Speaker D: I feel like that is the trend, is it's not like, oh, Austin and Miami are killing san Francisco, New York, it's like no one founder is in the Bay and then there's like engine lead in New York, and then they have a designer in Europe and then they have a data person in Asia and it's kind of like that. That's the sort of profile of team that I see these days. Not like everybody's in Miami. Miami is the new San Francisco.
00:08:43.830 - 00:08:57.190, Speaker A: Yeah. No, that sounds mean. Miami just has such a different vibe than either New York or Francisco. Like, you import people into Miami. You don't hire people from Miami, generally speaking, if you're a tech founder.
00:08:58.670 - 00:09:06.330, Speaker C: A hot take I will have is that I think Magic Leap failed because they were based outside of Miami Burn.
00:09:10.750 - 00:09:51.402, Speaker A: I don't know enough about Magic Leap to be able to weigh in there, but okay, fair enough. All right, so let's get into the meat of it, guys. So I wanted to take this semi inaugural episode to look back on all the craziness that's happened this year, because as we've been talking about, it's been a totally bizarre and wild 2021. So I wanted to look back at biggest wins, biggest losses, biggest lessons from 2021. So without further ado, let's get into it. The way we're going to do this is we're going to announce the particular topic, competitions like biggest Winner, Biggest Loser, et cetera. And we're going to each go around and explain our choice because a lot of people in the audience might not know what we're even talking about.
00:09:51.402 - 00:10:02.720, Speaker A: So we'll explain our choice in just a few sentences, and then we'll go around and each share. So we'll start with biggest Winner. Who wants to go first? Biggest winner of 2021?
00:10:03.490 - 00:11:12.946, Speaker D: I'll go first. I think when we were doing your reflection for this, I think one thing that's always difficult in crypto is to not just choose, okay, what asset went up the most in price and what went down the most in price? Because that's obviously a part of it, but it's also part of the story of product adoption, right? And what actually success looks like for some of these products and these protocols. And so for me, biggest winner in 21 was alternative L ones or different smart contract platforms to Ethereum. So obviously people are super excited about Salana and Avalanche and Luna and those really seem to be doing well in the market, but also just in terms of developer adoption. But I even think about stuff like BSc, which kind of kicked off the year as sort of this whole alternative EVM chain sort of Mania kicked off, or Polygon or even Phantom or even increasingly we see different exchanges developing their own chains and things like that. And so I think 2020 was, I think, all about Ethereum and DFI Summer, and everything was happening on Ethereum, and this year, obviously, stuff was happening on Ethereum, but increasingly it was happening on alternative L Ones. And so that's kind of been the story in my mind over the past year or so.
00:11:12.946 - 00:11:19.430, Speaker D: It's just been increasing adoption and traction and also price has been part of the story for these other smart contract platforms.
00:11:23.180 - 00:11:36.780, Speaker A: That's a good point. I think you covered a lot of ground there, actually, in all the no, there's just some overlap, I think, in some other people's answers, too. Tarun, Robert, you guys want to go next?
00:11:36.930 - 00:12:33.564, Speaker E: I'll go next. I think the biggest winner is actually publicly traded crypto things. I think there's two great examples of things that really did not exist in the public eye a year ago, but came into the public eye this year. So Coinbase and MicroStrategy, I think both have come to the forefront as publicly traded crypto companies that in their own ways are acting as huge legitimizing factors for the space that are creating a lot of awareness from investors that weren't as aware of crypto financial markets previously. But I think those two in some ways are the biggest winners and create sort of a winning halo for the rest of the ecosystem. I think they're going to set the groundwork for a lot of public companies to follow. And if you ask me twelve months ago, are there going to be lots of public crypto companies, I would have said no, not really.
00:12:33.564 - 00:13:05.544, Speaker E: They're going to stay private for a really long time. You're going to see a lot of crypto existing truly only in private markets. But if you ask me now at the end of 2021, I think the answer is yeah, I anticipate next year, the year after, the year after, there to be a lot more publicly traded on equity exchanges, not on crypto exchanges. Publicly traded crypto based businesses that are real. We had Long Island Iced Tea Blockchain or whatever years ago, but they were jokes. Right now we're starting to see Overstock.com.
00:13:05.662 - 00:13:06.970, Speaker C: Was a real business.
00:13:07.340 - 00:13:16.110, Speaker E: True, but I think this is the year that the public equity markets won by having two flag bearers for the asset class.
00:13:17.840 - 00:13:29.356, Speaker D: Where do you think that's going to come from? Do you think it's going to be more like existing public companies adopting crypto, like Block or Square, or do you think it's going to be companies going public? Do you think we're going to see like spot ETFs?
00:13:29.548 - 00:14:18.064, Speaker E: Yeah, and this also goes to having at least futures based ETFs in public markets. I didn't want to include that because I think it's more negative than positive, at least a lot of people's minds. But I think we're going to see more exchanges go public over time. There's a lot of really solid domestic and international exchanges that I think have an opportunity to go public over the next two years. I think we're going to start seeing Custodians going public over the next two years and I think we're just going to see a lot of crypto native businesses becoming publicly traded instead of existing publicly traded things, adopting crypto. Although Visa was a big player this year, that's already like an extremely large, well known publicly traded company that very seriously has been going into crypto. Obviously Facebook slash Meta has been dabbling for years and years and years but never really went live.
00:14:18.064 - 00:14:23.810, Speaker E: And so I think we're going to see a lot more crypto native businesses go public over the next two years.
00:14:26.350 - 00:14:40.478, Speaker A: Fair enough. Yeah. I think in very Robert fashion, it's like you're the only one advocating for the TradFi companies. The rest of us are picking like random meme coins. Tarun, what was your pick?
00:14:40.644 - 00:15:39.806, Speaker C: Yeah, so I didn't have one pick I wanted to actually give like a category kind of three things that broadly were like the biggest winners in their category and they're not comparable in some sense, but I guess I have a little tiny different take on the Alt l one season. I actually think that there's this class of Alt L ones that did do well and there's a whole slew of ones that were quite disappointing relative to what they were billed as in 2017 and 18 and maybe in 19. So I think the ones that really stood out, the interesting thing to me was the layer one with the hardest developer onboarding process period really one which was Solana, I think. Obviously AVAX and Luna had crazy good times too, but Solana was really out of the dark. I mean, in my mind it was always extremely hard to write smart contracts.
00:15:39.838 - 00:15:40.580, Speaker E: For them.
00:15:42.390 - 00:16:38.630, Speaker C: But they sort of willed their way into kind of winning the all l One war. The other two I want to mention were of course openc. I mean, they obviously had kind of this record breaking year. Maybe they'll be I know it's not exactly Robert's TradFi public company pick, but they could be very easily, in my know, one of these public company, you know you're not successful. I feel like at an equity business in crypto if you don't have tons of haters and the fact that they've had been vampire attacked should already tell you that vampire attack refers to basically people dropping a token to your users to try to get them to move to a new platform. And the last one I wanted to say was Widow. So Staking derivatives were a theoretical murmur in 2019.
00:16:38.630 - 00:16:56.220, Speaker C: There were some academic papers written 2020, but in 2021 we got a ridiculous percentage of Ethereum and now Salana in different Staking derivatives. And I think that is going to be a really big market over the next five to ten years.
00:16:58.210 - 00:17:38.458, Speaker A: Nice. Those are great choices. Well, so I'll wrap things up on biggest wasn't I was a little too non committal and so I gave my answer as a tie between Dogecoin as being one of the biggest winners. Originally I had Elon Musk and I was like, well, he's won on too many other things. So I'll just put Dogecoin instead as being the biggest winner in his stead. And I mean, Dogecoin kind of came out of almost nowhere. I guess it's always been around it's always kind of been a thing, but just the absolute staggering levels of demand and excitement around Dogecoin just blew my mind.
00:17:38.458 - 00:18:24.790, Speaker A: And probably like the one breakout crypto story of the year. If there's one from a mainstream perspective, it's probably Dogecoin. Which is bizarre to say because of course it's not the largest by market cap, but it does feel like it was like the word cloud of crypto this year. I feel like Dogecoin was the biggest and then second on winners for the year I put Kyle Simone. So not everyone might know who Kyle Simone is, but he is one of the co founders and managing partners of Multicoin Capital, which led the Seed Round and led the Series A of Solana. And so he is now a very, very wealthy man. And I understand that he now does all of his conference call ins from his Lamborghini.
00:18:24.790 - 00:19:11.430, Speaker A: And it's funny because one of the things I'm going to talk about later is about EOS. And he was somebody who the entire crypto community, not the entire, but many people in the crypto community, basically shit on in 2018 and 2019, particularly for his call on EOS and claiming that he thought EOS was going to be really successful. It was going to be this super high performance layer one, it was going make these tradeoffs around being less decentralized in order to get better performance. And EOS didn't really become that, but he took a bet on Solana saying, no, okay, maybe EOS wasn't it, but Solana is going to be it. And turned out he absolutely nailed it. And Solana has been a smashing success and kudos to him for sticking it out and believing in his thesis.
00:19:12.970 - 00:19:14.390, Speaker D: Everyone needs a redemption.
00:19:17.470 - 00:19:22.220, Speaker A: Pound for pound. By far the most successful investor of 2021.
00:19:22.990 - 00:19:35.566, Speaker C: I heard someone claim that the Salana Seed Round is the highest IRR investment in venture history. I don't know if that I haven't checked that number, but it could very well be.
00:19:35.748 - 00:19:54.518, Speaker A: Yeah, that sounds right. Okay, so that's biggest winner, let's move on. Next up we have best mechanism. So this was requested by Tarun. And so I thought, all right, why not? Let's throw it on there. Best Mechanism, tarun, given that it's your category, why don't you take it away?
00:19:54.684 - 00:19:55.174, Speaker D: For sure.
00:19:55.212 - 00:21:13.418, Speaker C: Yeah. So I think there was a very weird website that showed up in about March or April, late March, early April 2020, which used a lot of Greek language and linguistic, loose linguistic technique. And it was completely written about the temples in Greece and different types of goddesses and gods were associated to the pieces of this protocol. But this protocol turned out in spite of the fact that the docs were kind of impossible to read, and in spite of the fact that it seemed like it was a scam, it turned out to be one of the most successful and most copied and forked smart contracts on ethereum based chains. A sort of rough quick analysis that I did showed uniswap V. Two is the most copied contract, most forked and redeployed contract, and then synthetics minter contract is number two. Now I'm ignoring things like open zeppelin's, like safe math and stuff because those get inlined and there's all sorts of technical details.
00:21:13.418 - 00:22:17.442, Speaker C: This is more for fully deployed contracts. And number three is O, which is this protocol. And it really took me at least three or four months to wrap my head around why this thing was able to grow and get forked so much. But you can basically think of it as our first step towards a system where a protocol manages its own liquidity by issuing debt like instruments to people. And it was a smashing success. I mean, there have been probably tens of billions of dollars in the Ohm contract on multiple chains and so I think they deserve best mechanism. I'm working on trying to analyze it formally because I think there is something a lot deeper there that is a good lesson for people because I think there are a lot of other mechanisms are extremely you would think like fixed interest rate loans that maybe would catch on, but none of them have been able to.
00:22:17.442 - 00:22:21.860, Speaker C: And part of it has to do with sort of some of the things that are hidden within home.
00:22:23.750 - 00:22:24.446, Speaker E: Good mechanism.
00:22:24.478 - 00:22:25.570, Speaker A: Sounds like a detective.
00:22:26.470 - 00:22:30.146, Speaker C: Yes, yes. I of course HF deep inside Olympus.
00:22:30.178 - 00:22:33.334, Speaker A: Dow, there is a secret that we're going that's awesome. I like that.
00:22:33.372 - 00:22:36.870, Speaker E: The hiddens of the Temple. The hidden Secrets of the Temple.
00:22:37.030 - 00:23:00.186, Speaker A: Yeah, it feels like a Dan Brown feels like a Dan Brown novel somewhere in there. I like it. Okay, I'll go ahead. Best mechanism? I chose ESD. So actually I just looked up the price last year. Well, no, so it was last year, but it collapsed this year and then redefined itself. So it was actually collapsing right on jan one is when it slipped below ninety cents.
00:23:00.186 - 00:23:42.702, Speaker A: And so I was like, okay, you know what, I'm going to count that as this year. So for those who don't know, ESD stands for empty set dollar. And basically it's probably beyond the scope of this podcast for me to explain how ESD worked, but suffice it to say it was absolutely batshit crazy. It was a stable coin that is kind of sort of stable only if you squint and really believe in it. And that's ESD, it was not stable at all, but in a way it was a predecessor, I feel like, to om, and kind of inspired more of the modifications around what a stablecoin can be and what it even means to be a stablecoin. Like for example, the notion that you can call something a stablecoin and not have it be worth a dollar. I feel like ESD invented that.
00:23:42.702 - 00:24:25.450, Speaker A: And so I think Ohm owes a big tribute to ESD for the idea of yo, we can just call this thing a stablecoin even when it's not stable and not worth a dollar, but it kind of aspires in some loose way to be worth a dollar. I thought it was great and I think it also a big part of mechanisms in crypto is teaching, and I feel like ESD was probably one of the most teachable moments of 2021, is teaching people that hoping that something is true is not sufficient for actually making it true. And that mechanism design really matters. And so I feel like ESD, I think actually internally at Dragonfly, for us, it was one of these moments where a lot of people at the firm learned how much mechanism design matters.
00:24:27.630 - 00:25:13.382, Speaker D: As one of the people at Dragonfly who is into ESD, I will say I think the spiritual successor to ESD is actually axie infinity. Because the lesson here is that if the mechanism sucks, it doesn't matter as long as you get enough people to believe in it and then you have an amazing workshop that you can use to build something better down the road. And I don't know if they actually executed super well on it, on the idea, but they did sort of generate this idea that you can sort of hype first and build later. And I think that's honestly kind of like what we're seeing now, like Olympus is now doing V Two axes working, reworking the game. You can sort of build a community and then get this war chest and then back into something good as opposed to nailing something off the bat and being sort of perfectionist at V One launch.
00:25:13.526 - 00:25:18.080, Speaker A: Well, to be clear, ESD right now I'm just looking at it, has a $2.6 million market cap.
00:25:19.090 - 00:25:28.560, Speaker D: Yes, I think there was a concept and there was an idea and there was an execution on the idea, but the concept is what happened.
00:25:29.810 - 00:25:33.090, Speaker A: Fair enough. Tom, what's your pick best mechanism?
00:25:33.590 - 00:26:08.510, Speaker D: I forgot we were doing this category, but I'm going to go ahead and say Univ Three. I feel like Univ Three was hyped and rumored and people all these sort of ideas floating around or like what it could possibly be. And I feel like it actually kind of blew everybody's expectations out of the water. There was a lot of FUD and a lot of concern and a lot of criticisms when I think it first came out. But I think as always, you can just look at the market and look at the data and see what works and what doesn't work. And just empirically Univ Three is crushing it. Uniswap is like running away with the Dex market, especially the AMM market.
00:26:08.510 - 00:27:00.058, Speaker D: And certainly there's some concerns around LP profitability, but I think if anything, it sort of created this amazing ecosystem around Uniswap around what can we do with this new tool? There's teams that are using Univ Three positions to represent options so you can get different that's like primitive and brahma that do basically like options type payoffs, but with LP positions or people adding automated vault managers. And so I think this will just continue to pay dividends in future years as we see people build ecosystems and get really creative on top of Univ Three, in addition to just providing sort of the bare essentials of being a really great AMM and providing really deep liquidity on chain. So I think Univ Three, the team really crushed it and I think we've just seen it just do extremely well in the market as well. So that's going to be my pick, solid and Robert.
00:27:00.234 - 00:28:28.294, Speaker E: So I'm going to go with maybe more controversial, but I think in my mind, the clear winner mechanism design for 2021, which I think is Convex finance. This dovetails with, I think, last year's best mechanism, which is V tokens or locking up tokens to vote in a protocol which is coming back into vogue very quickly this year and next year, I'd say. But the two of these go hand in hand really well as a combined mechanism. So Curve is a very simple trading protocol and they have a governance token that you can stake for some amount of time to change, really, like how the liquidity of the different markets evolves, what are the incentives to each market, therefore, how large is each market? How liquid is each market? Convex basically takes advantage of this mechanism design. You could say it's cannibalizing it, or it's parasitic, or it's completely symbiotic or it's completely value accretive to it, but what it does is it allows people to exert more control over Curve's ecosystem. And what's incredible about this is this Symbiotic relationship has created a massive amount of value for Convex as well as Curve. Convex today, this is the freak stat, which I don't think people appreciate.
00:28:28.294 - 00:29:02.114, Speaker E: Convex today has a higher floating market cap than Curve does as a tool built on top of it, which is wild. And it's been, I think, one of the most successful things at creating an exuberance and new experimentation from dozens of other protocols that are now playing in this ecosystem, playing in the, quote, curve wars through Convex. It's starting to integrate with lots of other protocols in interesting ways. I think Convex number one mechanism of.
00:29:02.152 - 00:29:10.934, Speaker C: 2021 yeah, on the Chat, someone thought I said Ohm is number three. I meant Ohm is definitely number one.
00:29:10.972 - 00:29:13.846, Speaker E: In my he said, Ohm is three, comma three.
00:29:13.948 - 00:29:16.150, Speaker A: That's what he said. Exactly.
00:29:16.300 - 00:29:29.280, Speaker C: But I want to give an honorable mention to point Abracadabra slash MIM, which is basically doing what Convex did to many other ecosystems at this point.
00:29:31.650 - 00:29:44.260, Speaker A: Okay, let's move on. I'm realizing that we're going to have to move a little bit faster to get through all these because we picked a ton. Okay, we're moving on to Biggest Loser now. Biggest loser of 2021, tom Go.
00:29:45.030 - 00:30:11.402, Speaker D: This is going to be controversial. I have bitcoin. Bitcoin, I feel like, has really just fallen out of the conversation. Like, new people I talk to interested in crypto we're about to aren't asking about bitcoin. New investors aren't asking about bitcoin. From a price action perspective, it has really just done super poorly. I think year to date, it's done reasonably well because it started so low, but in a few weeks time, it'll basically be flat year over year.
00:30:11.402 - 00:30:53.640, Speaker D: And so I think there's just so much enthusiasm has left from Bitcoin and it kind. Of has to struggle to sort of figure out a narrative to define itself now, because I think now it actually has competition, right? Like, for the past ten years or whatever, everything else was kind of vaporware. Nothing else, really. Like, you can make promises, you could sort of make narratives around things they were working on, but bitcoin was bitcoin, and it had the legacy and it had sort of the understanding now sort of talk about this later. There are really compelling alternative narratives to the bitcoin narrative, and there's a lot more, just frankly, like, things to do that are a lot more encompassing than sound money. And I think that has kind of sucked a lot of the air out of the room for bitcoin sales.
00:30:57.390 - 00:31:00.422, Speaker A: That's a bold but very reasonable choice.
00:31:00.566 - 00:31:01.286, Speaker E: Bold choice.
00:31:01.318 - 00:31:09.294, Speaker C: Tom, I only have one tiny question, which was lightning or bitcoin in your mind?
00:31:09.492 - 00:31:34.040, Speaker D: So this is actually what's weird. Lightning is actually doing really well. I don't know if you've looked at lightning channel capacity in bitcoin terms, but it's gone crazy over the past six months. So the thing that I never thought would happen is happening, which is like, bitcoin has not done well, and lightning is doing super well. So it's a very strange sort of world that we're living in right now. But, yeah.
00:31:36.820 - 00:31:41.792, Speaker A: Seems like el salvador has actually been and strike in particular has actually been a big catalyst for that.
00:31:41.926 - 00:31:43.650, Speaker D: Yeah, that's what it seems like.
00:31:44.180 - 00:31:47.120, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay. Robert biggest loser.
00:31:47.280 - 00:32:51.928, Speaker E: So this is an esoteric one, but I think the grayscale arbitrage trade, which was at the heart of a lot of activity in the crypto markets in general, it drove huge flows of capital for years and years and years, was the biggest loser this year. So to walk people through what happened and why this is important, there used to be a trust called the grayscale bitcoin trust, and this thing for years traded at a premium to the value of the bitcoin that it held because there was really no good way for a lot of people to buy bitcoin. They weren't going on coinbase and buying bitcoin. They were, like, sitting on their e trade, and they were like, how do I get bitcoin? Let me buy the only product that's available through my brokerage account, which was like, this publicly traded trust. And for that reason, the trust always traded more than the value of the bitcoin inside. Well, this year, it flipped from a premium to a discount, and now it trades at a fraction of the value of the bitcoin that it holds. And this thing has like $15 billion of bitcoin in it.
00:32:51.928 - 00:33:42.644, Speaker E: And so for years, hedge funds were feasting on this mechanism. They were basically like subscribing, creating new shares of the bitcoin trust and then selling it to retail at a premium, taking their money back and doing it again. It drove huge amounts of borrowing demand for bitcoin and stablecoins and all of these different things so that you could do this trade. At the end of the day, it's one of the primary causes of what was a lot of the borrowing demand in the ecosystem. Well, this year it flipped to a negative and it stayed negative for the entire year. The discount gets worse and worse and worse, and all of the different traders that were participating in this trade and had been doing so successfully for years, all got smoked on this. And it changed, I think, a lot of the flows of the capital markets of crypto in ways that people notice and in ways that people don't notice.
00:33:42.644 - 00:33:50.120, Speaker E: But underneath the surface, I think this was the biggest event of 2021 for the crypto native institutions.
00:33:51.260 - 00:33:57.000, Speaker A: Yeah, notoriously, a lot of blockfly's business was built on the GBTC trade.
00:33:57.440 - 00:33:59.740, Speaker E: The majority, almost their whole business.
00:33:59.890 - 00:34:26.004, Speaker A: Right, exactly. When that trade blew up, I mean, thankfully, they've managed to diversify into other sources of revenue, but that was a lot of why they could offer really high rates, is that they were able to make it up on the other side through doing the GBTC trade. And it also reflects very much in interest rates. As you pointed out, the net that you can make on your crypto is just down a lot more when the trade stopped. Right.
00:34:26.042 - 00:34:34.120, Speaker E: When people ask, why does crypto do what it does? This is one of the big drivers of what happened everywhere else in the crypto markets. Was this trade?
00:34:34.860 - 00:34:39.850, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a great answer. Very inside baseball, but I loved it. Yeah.
00:34:40.540 - 00:34:42.830, Speaker E: Hopefully someone listening learned one thing new.
00:34:44.000 - 00:34:50.268, Speaker A: Learned one thing that they couldn't trade on. That's exactly what the show is about, telling you things you can't make money on.
00:34:50.434 - 00:35:19.876, Speaker E: Well, actually, now you actually can make money on this. So if you're naturally long bitcoin and you expect that one day the trust is going to get converted to an ETF, which Grayscale has been publicly saying they want to do, you can sell your Bitcoin for, let's say, $46,000, and you can buy Bitcoin for the equivalent of like $38,000 in this trust and have more Bitcoin.
00:35:19.988 - 00:35:21.448, Speaker A: Wait, is discount that high?
00:35:21.534 - 00:35:23.896, Speaker E: Yeah, it's like 20%. I can give you the exact number.
00:35:23.918 - 00:35:24.200, Speaker A: Wow.
00:35:24.270 - 00:35:36.700, Speaker E: Huge. Right? And so you can basically rotate out a physical bitcoin into trust bitcoin, and when it becomes an ETF or is more freely convertible, you'll have more Bitcoin.
00:35:38.240 - 00:35:40.104, Speaker A: Not many people super, not investment advice.
00:35:40.152 - 00:35:51.920, Speaker E: But not investment advice, obviously. But if you feel like becoming extremely sophisticated on how some of these basis trades work, someone's loss is someone else's gain.
00:35:54.180 - 00:36:18.104, Speaker A: Groovy. Okay, well, my answer is a lot less sophisticated. I said biggest loser this year was EOS BlockOne. EOS, I alluded to them earlier as the original darling of multicoin. There's Dan Larimer's. It was his magnum opus, I believe was the way he described it. Unfortunately, EOS being the solana before Solana, it didn't really quite work.
00:36:18.104 - 00:37:18.030, Speaker A: It was super janky. The economics were a complete mess and it eventually got abandoned by Block One. In that block One kind of went off to do Bullish Exchange, which is this big crazy exchange that was capitalized with a bunch of the bitcoin on EOS's balance sheet and they just kind of were hanging out. I don't really know what they were doing, but eventually what happened relatively recently is that so EOS contains in it a perpetual block reward for Block One as kind of like a thank you and a kiss on the cheek from the EOS community, thank you for birthing us, father. And recently EOS decided to fork out the block reward to Block One because they felt that they had been abandoned and that Block One was no longer holding up their end of the bargain and instead was off doing all this financial engineering with Bullish Exchange and voice and whatever else they're doing. And so Block One, to be clear, still very, very rich. They own a crapload of bitcoin worth, I think like 2 billion or something, some crazy amount of money.
00:37:18.030 - 00:37:27.730, Speaker A: But I'd say biggest loser this year. Feels to me like EOS one of the only layer ones that feels like somehow managed to avoid all of the lift on layer ones this year.
00:37:32.260 - 00:37:48.476, Speaker C: I have a very esoteric one, so I apologize, but please, perfect form the number two NFT platform in March 2021. What do you think it was after open foundation number two by volume?
00:37:48.528 - 00:37:50.484, Speaker A: Nifty Gateway. Oh, nifty gateway.
00:37:50.532 - 00:38:46.356, Speaker C: There was Nifty Gateway, but there was actually nifty had the big bump in April, May, I think, in March it was openc. And then Hen, which was this openc on Tezos, it was 98% of Tezos activity for a couple of days. But the interesting thing about Hen was it attracted a completely different type of artists that you had in Ethereum. So Hen was really focused on generative art and on chain art. So the NFT would change itself every time it got transferred or there'd be something kind of more game like. And they were really at the vanguard of this. And then their founder Rage, quit earlier this summer and abandoned all these artists and a lot of money that was owed was stuck in the contracts and it was a huge nightmare.
00:38:46.356 - 00:39:10.000, Speaker C: And so now it's sort of being revived by the community, but it was kind of a big blow up for the generative art world. I think actually one of the catalysts for moving to Solana and Matic for a lot of NFTs was actually Hen dying because Hen was really a big source of alternative NFT volume.
00:39:13.620 - 00:39:15.280, Speaker D: That's a very esoteric one.
00:39:15.430 - 00:39:21.030, Speaker A: Yeah, that is very esoteric. But Hen is coming back a lot, right? I heard that the volumes are actually quite good.
00:39:22.360 - 00:39:47.230, Speaker C: I mean, the community is trying to take the brand back for look, other people that you've heard of who have more marketing behind them, like Zora and foundation and stuff have less volume than hen often. So it's worth considering that they're like kind of this weird dark horse that artists like a lot more. They invented this green NFT thing.
00:39:51.280 - 00:40:19.400, Speaker D: Like kind of seeded all these blockchain, has this terrible carbon footprint discussion to push tezos and green NFTs, which is annoying because then it just becomes this cloud they have to discuss over every other blockchain. But I guess that's how they carve out their niche, right? Why else would you mint an NFT on tezos versus ethereum? It's like well, it's like proof of stake. So therefore it's green, I guess. But even that idea has to be sort of forced and created.
00:40:21.980 - 00:41:07.328, Speaker A: Enough. Let's move on to biggest surprise. So I'll go ahead and start on biggest surprise. So biggest surprise of 2021 for me was the rise of the one bit pools on Uniswap V three. So this was something that I always thought fundamentally about Uniswap that uniswap. So I'm not going to try to explain Uniswap very briefly, but with the Uniswap V Three, you had this ability for different uniswap pools to charge different prices that basically get collected as a fee for the LPs. And my assumption had always been that by the nature of Uniswap, they're not going to be able to charge super, super tight fees, super small fees for most of these markets because uniswap just doesn't have enough fine grained ability to price things really effectively.
00:41:07.328 - 00:41:36.124, Speaker A: It's just too gas inefficient just the natural nature of AMMS that you need some significant fees to charge in order for the whole thing to work. And one bit pools have emerged now on Uniswap V three. They were voted in. I think originally it was like five bit was the smallest fee range, and they upgraded it to now have one bit pools. And they're now doing an insane amount of volume. So I think it's both on stables and also isn't it also on ETH or something?
00:41:36.242 - 00:41:51.140, Speaker D: I think it is, but I'll look at the site right now, I think it's mostly still just stables. But that kind of makes sense, right? I think it would still be very hard for them to be profitable on your non stable pairs.
00:41:52.280 - 00:41:59.892, Speaker A: There was another dominant one bit pool. Maybe it's actually come down a lot because people realize they can make money on it. Okay, but then the five bit USDC ETH pool.
00:41:59.956 - 00:42:00.376, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:42:00.478 - 00:42:09.240, Speaker A: I also found that quite surprising that five bits was like a really stable five. If you look at volume outperformed five.
00:42:09.310 - 00:42:13.000, Speaker E: Bips USDC 30 basis points on the fees you earned.
00:42:13.500 - 00:42:14.344, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:42:14.542 - 00:42:17.116, Speaker A: Crazy. Absolutely crazy.
00:42:17.218 - 00:42:17.628, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:42:17.714 - 00:42:31.856, Speaker A: So that really blew me away. I found that that was definitely not what I anticipated was going to happen with the advent of Unity V three. But Unity v Three really proved everybody wrong. So incredible stuff. Yeah.
00:42:31.878 - 00:42:32.930, Speaker D: That's a good one.
00:42:34.680 - 00:42:36.070, Speaker A: Rob, you want to go?
00:42:36.520 - 00:42:38.196, Speaker E: Which category are we on?
00:42:38.298 - 00:42:43.060, Speaker A: Biggest surprise. Biggest surprise. I think biggest surprise was this topic.
00:42:44.680 - 00:43:03.516, Speaker E: I was researching one bit pools. I was on uniswap info. The biggest surprise that I had was actually an NFT land. And there was a couple of surprises. One is that Beeple 5000 Days sold for $69 million. And it feels like 20 years ago. Doesn't feel like 2020 1.
00:43:03.516 - 00:43:14.044, Speaker E: Second is board apes flipped punks. Huge surprise. I never would have thought that even a couple of months ago. Right? Huge surprise.
00:43:14.172 - 00:43:17.596, Speaker A: I think the floor flipped. Not the aggregate.
00:43:17.708 - 00:43:49.444, Speaker E: Right, yeah. We're not talking aliens know some names, but the floor, which most users consider to be the primary price because for most people, that's the on ramp to the asset. Right. So the floor, which is what most people would use to get into the NFT, flipped. Huge surprise. Mostly due to two extremely different approaches to IP. And if you count people, it's like a third approach to IP, but Apes versus CryptoPunks really, I think, explain for people two different approaches.
00:43:49.444 - 00:44:45.390, Speaker E: One is a very corporate approach. We'll call it crypto punks. And one is more of a bottom up approach, which is Apes still with, like a top down creation of new assets and community building, but one in which it feels like top down versus bottom up. And I think it was a primary driver about why this year saw apes exceed Punks, which I never would have thought at the beginning of the year, I never would have thought that Larvae Labs would have been restrictive. Of IP and tried to monetize it for themselves. While apes would give IP rights to their owners and users as well as lots and lots of airdrops of new assets to their owners to make it feel like owning it had, like, IP plus plus. But in terms of the outcome of these two strategies, I was surprised by the fact that it worked so effectively to take what was the bitcoin of NFTs and have the ethereum of NFTs flip it.
00:44:45.840 - 00:45:20.680, Speaker D: I very much agree with you. It's surprising and not something I would have anticipated. But I don't think it's because of the IP thing. I think it's just purely like a art and sort of like, what vein of culture have you tapped into Larvae Labs? And I think CryptoPunks just don't have that sort of mainstream accessibility. And we've seen, obviously, some artist agencies are pushing apes through their celebrities. So athletes, a lot of entertainers getting into apes. And that sort of becomes a sort of memetic desire thing on top of everything you mentioned around, just like, engaging more with the community.
00:45:20.680 - 00:45:30.164, Speaker D: Larva Labs is like this orphaned child or crypto punks, like this orphan child that Larva labs just doesn't really want to deal with, it seems like. But yeah, boo.
00:45:30.212 - 00:45:31.764, Speaker E: Larva labs, boo.
00:45:31.892 - 00:45:56.530, Speaker D: Yeah. So, yeah, I agree with you. Very surprising. But I think the IP thing again is like it's an esoteric take. It's like crypto people care about that. But I think if you go to the board ape meetup in New York, people are like they just think it's cool. The artwork is maybe more accessible or more interesting or more varied and for whatever reason there's probably some random processes to making it more accessible to people.
00:45:59.960 - 00:46:01.528, Speaker A: Drew, you want to go up next.
00:46:01.694 - 00:47:21.280, Speaker C: Biggest yeah I think that my biggest surprise was sort of the Luna burn, how effective that was and how Luna just soluna AVAX contingent really sort of bloomed. But Luna grew in a very different way than Solana and Avalanche. Avalanche and Solana really grew from a ton of yield farms which are basically places where people could put up assets and earn sort of percentage ownership and new smart contracts that are being built as protocols. Luna has very few DeFi protocols on it. There's very little app activity outside of the main payment transfer and crucially their staking derivative so their Staking derivative drives like 60% to 80% of the volume demand for the stablecoin that is native to Luna's platform. UST and Luna had a bunch of apps earlier in the year that had a ton of success and then that kind of got crimped by regulatory stuff like Mirror. So I don't know if you guys remember this, but all the DEXs front ends, like the official ones, removed mirror and, uma because of the sort of regulatory stuff around Synthetics.
00:47:21.280 - 00:48:10.160, Speaker C: But in spite of that luna building these staking derivatives and building this kind of sort of almost a little bit like an Ohm style liquidity mechanic for borrowing against your stake really was able to bootstrap like crazy. And then they did this burn where they burned a gigantic portion of the supply and historically when chains have done this like Stellar did this burn where they burned 50% of the lumen supply did not do anything right. The Luna burn is the exact opposite. Both of them have astronomical names but that's the only thing they have in common. So I think that's like a really interesting thing of how staking derivatives can actually bootstrap. Staking derivatives combined with a burn can like five x your market cap on a big cap coin.
00:48:10.500 - 00:48:22.196, Speaker A: Yeah, no, a pretty incredible success story for token economics, being able to really drive the value of a token. Tom biggest surprise, I guess, sort of.
00:48:22.218 - 00:49:21.690, Speaker D: Going along with Robert. Just like the NFT renaissance, I think, the DFI kind of wave and DFI summer 2020. We kind of felt that it was coming for a while and we sort of saw this gradual buildup of projects that were building in the space and developing, and it sort of felt like there was a trajectory behind it. I was looking back before this show like, okay, what were people predicting in 2021 and what did people miss? And basically, obviously people have been excited about NFTs for a while, myself included, and sort of investing in the NFT space, but no one was really like there was no NFT section of people's 2021 predictions. It was like, oh, NFTs are a thing. Maybe people will be injured in digital art next year. And so if you're like, the NFT renaissance and specifically the different waves of it, I think just caught me by surprise, and I think caught a lot of people by surprise, like, how mainstream it was.
00:49:21.690 - 00:50:01.204, Speaker D: It's kind of a weird idea, and I feel like it's kind of nerdy, but there was sort of that wave in march that was all celebrity driven, like nifty gateway, like grimes, NFTs. And that was when it was on SNL. And I was like, okay, I kind of get that celebrities want to sell digital representations of themselves. That makes sense. But the fact that all these crypto native PFP things have gone so popular, I just would not have predicted. It's kind of crazy to me that there's people on TikTok explaining how to set up MetaMask and switch it over to Polygon, and people are really, really getting in the weeds with it, and it's very mainstream. So I never would have predicted that.
00:50:01.204 - 00:50:10.360, Speaker D: I think I thought it would have been kind of Nifty Gateway style forever. But yeah, it turns out there's your 2021 surprise.
00:50:11.260 - 00:50:34.690, Speaker A: Crypto comes at you fast, man. Things change sooner than you think they can. Okay, we're running low on time, so we're going to skip forward to best meme. So what was the best meme moment of 2021? Tom, can you throw these up on the screen? Because I think we're going to need so, Rob, why don't you go first?
00:50:35.060 - 00:50:38.752, Speaker E: Rob, are you muted important award category right here?
00:50:38.806 - 00:50:42.930, Speaker A: This is obviously the most important. This is one we're going to make a trophy for.
00:50:44.740 - 00:50:46.032, Speaker E: Great meme. I love this meme.
00:50:46.096 - 00:50:47.652, Speaker A: I feel like we need an NFT of this.
00:50:47.786 - 00:50:48.470, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:50:48.920 - 00:51:21.432, Speaker A: Okay, so I'll go ahead and go first. So my pick for best meme was the SPF sam Bankman fried the shoes that he was wearing at the Capitol hearing. I thought this was absolutely amazing, and I still remember this. So this is just the look of somebody who they have so much money that nothing matters anymore. That is how you tie your shoe when you don't care what anybody thinks, other than that you don't want them to shut down. Crypto. Those are the shoes of a superhero.
00:51:21.576 - 00:52:17.890, Speaker D: Yeah, it's very on brand. All right, Tom, what's you I interpreted this very differently. My top meme for 2021 was Web Three. I think the rebranding of crypto and cryptocurrency to Web Three sort of inadvertently has been super genius, for whatever reason, that has sort of made it click for people, and now it feels a little weird to tell people I work in crypto or I'm a crypto investor. I think that kind of almost has like a little bit of a strange or negative connotation. But you tell people you work in web3, it's maybe a little bit pretentious, but I feel like it sort of made the entire value prop and the entire ethos of the whole space click a little bit more for mainstream even like sort of web two normal tech type people. So that's my vote for best meme, actually, is like Web Three sort of almost sort of supplanting crypto as how people refer to everything that's going on in the space.
00:52:20.100 - 00:52:37.100, Speaker A: That's a good choice. I've also noticed that Web Three has become much more highbrow, I feel like, than crypto. Crypto sounds like you're trying to get rich quick. It sounds like, whatever. Whereas Web Three is like, no, you're trying to remake the web and this new kind of enlightened, more socialist image.
00:52:37.280 - 00:52:38.010, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:52:39.980 - 00:52:48.904, Speaker C: There'S nothing better than venture capitalists saying they're socialists thanks to Web Three. That's the ultimate 3D chess escher impossible staircase move.
00:52:49.022 - 00:53:02.928, Speaker D: It's true. It's a little bit more inclusive, right? It's like, you get the NFTs, you get the file sharing, you get the decentralized Twitter. It's weird to call filecoin like cryptocurrency. It's like, well, kind of, but also kind of not really.
00:53:03.094 - 00:53:07.808, Speaker A: Yeah, I feel like AOC does not like crypto, but she does like Web Three.
00:53:07.974 - 00:53:08.690, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:53:10.660 - 00:53:13.120, Speaker A: It expands the tent pole, allows us to bring in more.
00:53:13.190 - 00:53:54.952, Speaker C: So actually, I just have a question. Avenues, right? I always just thought Gavin Wood came up with it for describing polka dot, but never marketed it that way because it's the Web Three Foundation. Right. They actually had the term way back, five years ago. Five years ago. But someone then, and I suspect it's a 16 z plus a couple of other people who are doing more like lobbying stuff in Congress, but someone revitalized it and ripped out the polka dot part and said everything else, like NFTs equals web3, not polka dot. And I thought that was also there's some interesting dynamic there of how did that transition happen? Because polka dot has had that name forever.
00:53:54.952 - 00:54:09.780, Speaker C: And they were hitting the circuit really hard, being like, this is the new Internet. This is decentralized web in the bottom of the bear market. And no one gave a shit. Like, literally zero people gave a shit about that narrative then, and somehow now NFT has made it like, tangible.
00:54:12.360 - 00:54:29.450, Speaker A: Couldn't tell you. Couldn't tell you. But I'd love to see some sleuthing on where exactly the Web Three term got popularized from a 16 z four characters. That's the answer probably true. Tarun, what's your pick?
00:54:31.680 - 00:54:50.530, Speaker C: In my camaraderie with the Omis, it's three three, but I think the best moment for three three was when Grimes, after the Elon Musk separation thing and Elon Musk was like, NFT suck. She just posted this tweet three three. And I thought that was the meme of the year for me.
00:54:54.020 - 00:54:55.236, Speaker A: What about you? Yeah.
00:54:55.258 - 00:55:49.636, Speaker E: I'm going to go with the real counterculture picks right here. I think. All the dog coins not dogecoin, but all of the fly by night. Like, pop up for a week. Dogs, named after Elon Musk, named after some other Meme. The recursivity of these memes with the dog coins has gotten so deep that I think they win just in terms of total amount of energy captured by the retail public. These worthless, pointless dog offshoot of dog offshoot of dog coins, I think won just based on their prevalence and the amount of market cap that they created off of absolutely nothing but meme this year, like the fact that Shiba is floki and all of these things are what they are.
00:55:49.636 - 00:55:59.590, Speaker E: I hate it. I think it's dark. It's depressing. It goes against everything I like and believe in in Crypto. But the crazy ass dog coins, I think, were the best meme this year.
00:56:02.220 - 00:56:19.004, Speaker A: Solid Choice. Okay, in the very short time we have left, let's do rapid fire. 2022 Predictions So I'll go first. I'll just listen through my predictions for 2022. One. The GameFly bubble pops. Two, we get a D five bull market again.
00:56:19.122 - 00:56:19.500, Speaker E: Three.
00:56:19.570 - 00:56:38.070, Speaker A: I think we're going to see synthetic assets actually start to work in D. Five. For those who don't know, synthetic assets are assets that track the price of some underlying real asset. Like the S and P 500 or something like that. And then lastly, I think we're going to get a spot bitcoin ETF. Those are my predictions for 2022.
00:56:38.440 - 00:57:12.072, Speaker D: Tom, what do you I got dow. Boom. I think Constitution Dow was just the beginning. I think people are going to figure out how to make crowdfunding and dows work well and make it work super simply. And we're going to see Dows go out and doing more real world things and buying stuff. So that's going to be a thing. I think crypto native gaming is going to kind of replace GameFi like kind of stuff like Dark Forest where it's like you're using a blockchain to do game mechanics and PvP and you're playing something through a smart contract as opposed to just taking items and put them on a blockchain.
00:57:12.072 - 00:57:30.260, Speaker D: I think we're going to see more stuff like that. And I think identity a lot of teams working on different ways to sort of now that people are actually doing things on chain those real economies and people trading NFTs finding ways to sort of tie identity into what you're actually doing on chain. So I think that's going to be more of a thing going forward in 2022 and beyond.
00:57:31.640 - 00:57:33.712, Speaker A: Okay. Tarun Predictions.
00:57:33.856 - 00:57:56.664, Speaker C: Yes. So to Tom's point on Dows, I think Dow's purchases will get wilder than they were this year. Tom, Robert and I are in. Pleaser. Dow. And it's kind of crazy that that was March where we were trying to negotiate, buying Wu Tang from the government. But I think it's going to be like, ten times crazier.
00:57:56.664 - 00:58:42.676, Speaker C: Like a sports team, maybe a tiny nation. That one might be a little bit harder, but I think there's going to be some very crazy purchases over the next twelve months by collective units. And I think privacy preserving layer twos are going to have a moment because I think bootstrapping, something like tornado chain is kind of hard, getting a lot of liquidity, getting kind of the mechanism working. And there is clearly a demand for tornado on ETH, so I think that there will be demand for such solutions, but I think it'll be easier to do it as a privacy preserving layer two. And there's a bridge from multiple chains to it. And things like Aztec and stuff have been making some crazy strides. Very impressive.
00:58:42.676 - 00:58:54.140, Speaker C: On the ZK side, I think that was like the biggest surprise for me, how far Aztec has gotten. I think there's going to be a hundred million dollar plus hack on soloon Avex. I'm just calling that as the one.
00:58:54.290 - 00:59:01.484, Speaker E: Solavx Solun Avex at the application layer or at the protocol Solun AVAX Solunavax.
00:59:01.532 - 00:59:10.756, Speaker C: Yes. Which sounds like a really bad, poorly made COVID vaccine, but that's true.
00:59:10.858 - 00:59:13.008, Speaker A: We should call it SLA. I feel like that's a good acronym.
00:59:13.024 - 00:59:47.772, Speaker C: We got to start popularizing, I think on the application layer, I think we're overdue for some big hacks there. There's just too much money sitting in these unaudited yield farms on those that can't last forever. NFT Finance is going to have its moment. People borrowing against their NFTs, getting leverage on their NFTs. I think fractional, obviously having such a big year was the first part of that, but that is going to expand into other types of financial products. And I think blockchain gaming, thumbs down most GameFi. I don't think you survive.
00:59:47.772 - 01:00:00.880, Speaker C: Sorry. I think there will be games that are made. I just don't think they're going to be this like SoftBank throws $2 billion at something and it becomes popular.
01:00:01.040 - 01:00:10.820, Speaker A: Shots fired by SoftBank. If you're out there, please sponsor our show. All right, Robert. Last word. 2022 predictions.
01:00:10.980 - 01:00:48.848, Speaker E: So I think 2022 is the year that we get crypto native legislation in the United States, where we have two houses of Congress and an executive branch that ratify legislation around. Crypto. Doesn't mean it's going to be huge, doesn't mean it's going to create clarity in all different ways, but I think we're going to get real crypto legislation in 2022. I think that we've reached the boiling point. I think there's starting to be an awareness, I think there's starting to be a conversation entering the national stage where I think 2022 is the year that we start to see some real legislation.
01:00:49.024 - 01:00:52.580, Speaker A: And you think the legislation is going to be good or bad or neutral?
01:00:52.920 - 01:00:56.512, Speaker E: Could be either, could be both. But obviously I'm hopeful that it's.
01:00:56.576 - 01:01:01.988, Speaker A: Come on, Robert, this is 22 predictions. Yeah, good, bad or neutral that there's.
01:01:02.004 - 01:01:03.240, Speaker E: Going to be legislation.
01:01:05.900 - 01:01:17.272, Speaker A: All right, you're not. Invited back to the next one Robert can't fire. I think that's true. It is a dow. We got to put up to a vote. Yeah. All right.
01:01:17.272 - 01:01:32.930, Speaker A: Well, guys, this was a lot of fun. Thank you to Laura for having us. And thank you, all of you, for listening. I think that's it for us. You'll see us in the new year in 2022 and we look forward to degenning with the rest of you, but thanks for having us.
01:01:33.700 - 01:01:36.220, Speaker C: Saluna back, everyone. Salon.
