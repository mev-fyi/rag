00:00:00.640 - 00:00:26.777, Speaker A: The more people in this ecosystem, the more it'll really do is make more liquidity for the ETFs. And liquidity again is big fish bait. You know, the more liquid things are, the more you'll get big tuna and shark and whales. They won't bite on some, you know, bs, little etf. They need to see like giant liquidity because they don't want anyone to know they're there. They also don't want to move the market. So this is the real benefit of all this.
00:00:26.777 - 00:00:52.255, Speaker A: It just creates an ecosystem that comes back to the ETF in the form of more liquidity and like I said, optionality on how to express your views. So over the years, ETFs that have a lot of options have built a moat around them and continue to be the most liquid of their class. So for example, GLD. There's cheaper gold ETFs, but GLD still trades the most. And a big part of that is because it has all the options tied to it and the options market is huge.
