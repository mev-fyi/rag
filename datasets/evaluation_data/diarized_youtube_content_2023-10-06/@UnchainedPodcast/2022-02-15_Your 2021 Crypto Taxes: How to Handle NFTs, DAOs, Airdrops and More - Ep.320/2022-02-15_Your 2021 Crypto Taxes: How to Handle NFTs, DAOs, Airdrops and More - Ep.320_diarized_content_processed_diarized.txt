00:04:01.808 - 00:04:02.902, Speaker C: Good afternoon.
00:04:03.046 - 00:04:04.620, Speaker D: Yeah, thanks for having us.
00:04:05.070 - 00:04:12.880, Speaker A: Can you each briefly describe your background and how you came to know this area of crypto taxes? Shehan, why don't we start with you?
00:04:13.650 - 00:04:17.614, Speaker D: Sure. So I've been a CPA ever since.
00:04:17.652 - 00:04:20.346, Speaker E: I started my career, got into crypto.
00:04:20.378 - 00:04:32.194, Speaker D: Around 2016 2017 time period, and then joined Cointrecker in the early days as the head of tax. Reggie kind of started building the software there. Yeah, so that's a little bit about.
00:04:32.232 - 00:04:35.858, Speaker E: My background and John, I have a.
00:04:35.864 - 00:05:07.310, Speaker C: Long history of government service in tax controversy, representing the IRS in court and then district court and tax court. I also served as an executive at the IRS and I first got introduced to digital assets in cryptocurrency back when the IRS was issuing a John Doe summons to Coinbase, and I was supervising the agents that were involved with that. I then continued on with some of the IRS enforcement programs around digital assets before coming to RSM.
00:05:08.050 - 00:05:18.660, Speaker A: Great. All right, so let's start our discussion with a quick overview of crypto taxes. Let's first start with the main taxable events. What are those?
00:05:19.190 - 00:05:51.306, Speaker D: Sure, I'll go ahead. So, cryptocurrencies are treated as property according to the IRS notice, that 20, 14, 21. So that treatment results in your different types of taxable event when you do different, different things. So let me break down the five different types of events that could lead to a taxable event. So number one, just cashing out crypto pretty self explanatory. You could have bitcoin, you're cashing it out, you got to pay capital gain taxes. Number two is when you trade one cryptocurrency to another.
00:05:51.306 - 00:06:00.058, Speaker D: So you could be going from ethereum to bitcoin or bitcoin to litecoin. You don't necessarily have to realize any cash, but the property treatment gives rise.
00:06:00.074 - 00:06:01.280, Speaker E: To a taxable event.
00:06:01.810 - 00:06:28.374, Speaker D: Number three is when you spend cryptocurrencies to buy a good or service. You could be buying a subscription or you could be buying a Tesla that triggers a taxable event. Number four is when you earn cryptocurrencies. There are so many ways that you can earn cryptocurrencies. It could be through wages, interest income, mining income, staking income, which is somewhat arguable. We'll get into that in later. So whenever you earn cryptocurrency, that triggers a taxable event.
00:06:28.374 - 00:06:43.134, Speaker D: And then the last one is when you go through a hard fork and receiving a new type of cryptocurrency or you're getting airdropped, a new type of token that triggers a taxable event. So those are the five situations that you need to remember. If you go through any of those.
00:06:43.172 - 00:06:46.142, Speaker E: Situations, you could have a taxable or.
00:06:46.196 - 00:06:49.230, Speaker D: Reportable thing to that you need to report on your taxes.
00:06:50.210 - 00:06:58.130, Speaker A: And John, do you want to expound on how those different events are taxed and how people should think about their tax rates?
00:06:59.110 - 00:07:38.880, Speaker C: Sure. Generally, in some of the events that Xian described, when you cash out or when you exchange cryptocurrency, that's when you exchange property. When you could exchange property, you sell property. You exchange one piece of property for another piece of property, which would be barter. Generally, if it's property that you've held, that you've acquired and held and sold, that would be taxed as a capital gain. If it's property that you earn, like income or proceeds, then that's taxed as ordinary income. Sheehan also talked about that.
00:07:38.880 - 00:07:55.438, Speaker C: Some of the questions that are unclear involve certain kinds of coins, what they call staking. Is that created, are you creating property or are you earning property through your work? So generally though, it's a capital treatment.
00:07:55.614 - 00:08:23.790, Speaker A: Okay, yeah, we will definitely discuss staking in more depth later on in this episode. But first, let's talk about kind of some of the things that will probably be top of mind for crypto people for this year's tax season. And I personally think that this discussion probably will start with NFTs. So let's give an overview of how NFTs are taxed and we can look at both how they're taxed for creators as well as buyers.
00:08:25.410 - 00:08:26.062, Speaker C: Sure.
00:08:26.196 - 00:09:06.438, Speaker D: 2021 I think it was the year of the NFTs. If anybody asked me what was the hottest topic, it wasn't Bitcoin, it wasn't DFI, it was NFDS. Those people who made money through NFDS and also who lost money through NFDS are going through the tax filing season right now. So it's really important for them to know what needs to be reported and how to get those numbers. So speaking of NFT taxes, there are two ways that you can interact with NFTs. One, as a trader, you can just flip NFTs and make money. The other way is, as a creator, you can create NFTs and put it on marketplaces like OpenSea, so people can buy it and you can earn royalties.
00:09:06.438 - 00:09:47.398, Speaker D: So let me kind of walk through NFT trader taxes. So NFTs are very similar to cryptocurrencies, at least in terms of when it comes to tax implications. So you have a purchase price, you have a sales price, fancy terms, cost basis, and the sales proceeds. If you make a profit, those profits are subject to capital gain taxes similar to any other cryptocurrency. So pretty clear that area. And obviously if you bought an NFT and that NFT lost in value and then you're disposing that NFT at a loss, you're also eligible to get that capital loss. So that's how NFT taxes work.
00:09:47.398 - 00:10:34.178, Speaker D: At a high level for creators. One thing to notice that some of these NFTs are based on artwork like Board, Ape Yard Club, and there are so many other projects. So those artwork based NFDS could be treated as a collectible under the IRS tax code. And if they're deemed as collectible, those collectible gains, that's subject to a higher long term capital gains up to 28%, versus the highest capital gain tax rate, which is 20%. That's applicable to regular crypto, coins and stocks. So something to keep in mind if you're specifically dealing with art based NFTs. So yeah, in a nutshell, that's how NFD taxes work for traders and for creators.
00:10:34.178 - 00:11:11.282, Speaker D: Obviously you can hire some people and create, I don't know, certain types of images within a certain characteristic. It could be thousand of certain type of character. And you can put it on sale for places like OpenSea and super rare. If you're a creator, every time you sell those NFTs, that triggers a taxable event for you. And the amount of taxes, amount of income you need to report is the market value that you receive at the time you're selling that NFT to somebody. And that could also be subject to.
00:11:11.336 - 00:11:15.086, Speaker E: Self employment taxes, which is another layer.
00:11:15.118 - 00:11:31.514, Speaker D: Of taxes you need to pay if you're in the business of if you're a creator, if you're a full time creator, you got to pay income taxes and also self employment taxes because that's your trade of business. Again. So you get income, you report income. And obviously if you have any business related expenses, you get to use those.
00:11:31.552 - 00:11:35.174, Speaker E: Expenses to offset your income in some cases.
00:11:35.222 - 00:11:37.514, Speaker D: You could also get royalty income when.
00:11:37.552 - 00:11:40.730, Speaker E: That NFD gets traded in the secondary market.
00:11:40.800 - 00:12:15.938, Speaker D: And that also constitutes income to you at the time you receive those royalty rewards. So the trick for both creators and the traders is that kind of capturing those income events and converting those tokens into the market value every time you receive them, and figure out your capital gains that you need to pay taxes on, which is a very cumbersome task. But if you went through the NFD, that saga in 2021. I don't think it's a saga, I think it's going to continue to happen. Make sure you have good record so you can compile your capital gains and capital losses.
00:12:16.114 - 00:12:38.830, Speaker A: So one issue related to NFTs that I wanted to discuss was people are also using them as kind of like tickets almost to get into Dows or for access to chat groups or whatever it might be. Are those pretty much taxed the same way as you just outlined? Or because they have a different usage, are they taxed any differently?
00:12:39.410 - 00:13:02.514, Speaker D: So I think you're talking about using your NFT to authenticate into some type of platform or get access to some type of thing. I don't see that creating a taxable event. I mean, obviously you're using an asset that you have to access something valuable, you're not disposing of that asset. You still loan it so it shouldn't.
00:13:02.562 - 00:13:09.660, Speaker A: Create a taxable and but what if they sell, like for friends with benefits? Yeah, if they sell their.
00:13:12.030 - 00:13:50.994, Speaker C: I agree with Sheen that the initial purchase of the NFT and the use to get into an event, then I agree that wouldn't be a taxable event. However, if the event turns out to be a historic occasion that ten years later maybe has a value in and of itself as a memento of that event or a separate, then it might fall into the collectibility realm where if you just sold it, that looks more like it's a collectible that something is sold. But even then, if there's no history, it would be a sale or exchange of the NFT.
00:13:51.122 - 00:14:02.700, Speaker A: Okay, but also for something like friends with benefits, where I'm just trying to because a part of me is like, wait, do they burn those? But I don't think they do. I think people just buy and sell them.
00:14:03.150 - 00:14:19.550, Speaker C: If it's something like a club or membership club, then I think those have value and you sell those, you would deduct your basis. You would deduct your basis in those. But then those could be taxable on a resale.
00:14:20.050 - 00:14:31.490, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah. Which is because the price of those has definitely fluctuated. So people weren't buying and selling them for the same price. Okay, so it sounds like then they are taxed.
00:14:32.070 - 00:14:56.474, Speaker D: If anybody's using an NFD as a ticket, like in simple example, and you're waiting out of the stadium and you're buying a ticket for $100 and selling it for $200, it is a taxable event because you're profiting from that thing. So if we apply the same scenario into NFDS and if people are flipping NFD tickets or access to some type of event, technically it's a taxable event.
00:14:56.672 - 00:15:35.350, Speaker A: Okay. Just want to understand about the collectible issue. It sounds like different NFTs would be treated differently depending on the nature of that. Obviously, everybody when they think about NFTs goes first to JPEGs or Art, but obviously there's things like domain names or now music or I mean, there's just a huge variety. So how would the IRS think about what is a collectible? Or how would you determine it when you go to pay your taxes or your accountant or whoever?
00:15:36.090 - 00:16:25.270, Speaker C: I would want to see more of a history of a market for collectible. I don't think, given that there isn't a lot of guidance on point, I'm not really sure that the IRS will want to wade into the collectibility. Whether something is a collectible so early on in the life of an NFT. I'm not to say that that won't change later on or that there won't be more specific guidance out there, but I think at this point that if a taxpayer records a reasonable purchase price, records their basis, and recognizes the income, if it is sold or traded, that I think that they're probably in a pretty sound position and the iOS won't start looking at a collectible determination.
00:16:26.250 - 00:16:30.730, Speaker A: So you would actually think that that's kind of a less likely scenario?
00:16:31.550 - 00:16:57.778, Speaker C: I do. I think really, until NFTs are older, till there's a history of them almost like artwork, like a provenance that you can see the history of the sales, that people are doing this as an appreciation or a collectible versus now I think the market's just too early. They're more like an investment at this point in time.
00:16:57.944 - 00:17:16.390, Speaker A: And then just to go back, I wanted to make sure I understood. And shehan, you may have misspoke because you were saying that even though it seems like the collectible thing isn't an issue for now, did you say that even the long term capital gain on that would be 28%, or did you mean short term?
00:17:17.130 - 00:18:09.766, Speaker D: So just to add to what joan mentioned, IRS has not issued any NFD specific tax guidance, but there are court sections that define what a collectible is, and that code section is very broad. It says any type of artwork or any type of music and et cetera could be treated as a collectible. So some conservative taxpayers, they have started creating some of these art based NFTs as collectible just to be on the safe side. But I completely agree with what john mentioned. Iris hasn't said anything. If you're reporting something, even if it's not treated as a collectible, that would be the better way to go about things. Coming back to your question, laura, so if it is deemed as a collectible, then your long term capital gain tax rate goes from 20% to 28% if you're a high net worth individual.
00:18:09.766 - 00:18:34.740, Speaker D: So the idea is that IRS came up with this in a collectible tax code section in the 90s. So the idea is that if you have collectible gains, you're considered to be like a super high net worth individual. So I guess it's reasonable to have them subject to a higher tax rate, like 8% higher tax rate than regular stocks and crypto coins are subject to. So that's where the tax rate differ comes from.
00:18:35.350 - 00:18:52.230, Speaker A: Okay. And then for people who have been trading exchanges, I know the forms that they might have gotten over the years may have changed for this year. What forms could people expect to get and how would they then use those forms?
00:18:52.650 - 00:19:27.422, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, even this year, we see different types of forms issued by different exchanges and wallets. Ten, nine, and miscellaneous is a pretty common form that you're going to see if you staked or earned some type of reward inside any of these exchanges, and if your reward income was more than $600 in a given year. So you're going to get that form, and that form typically goes on the schedule, one that considered other income. Another form that we see that has caused a lot of confusion is the form 1009K, which reports your gross proceeds.
00:19:27.486 - 00:19:31.170, Speaker E: Every month and it doesn't report your cost basis.
00:19:31.830 - 00:20:12.206, Speaker D: And as soon as the taxpayer gets they're like, okay, these numbers are wrong. These numbers are highly inflated and naturally they blame at the exchange. But the reality is that the form 1009K doesn't have any place to report the cost basis. So the exchanges are doing what they're supposed to do under the 1009K reporting rule, then your job is to kind of figure out the cost basis and pay the taxes on your actual net capital gains and or claim like a net loss. So something to keep in mind. So just because you get a 1009K doesn't mean that you had to pay taxes on that entire gross amount. As soon as you add the cost basis, your tax liability is going to go down a lot.
00:20:12.206 - 00:20:15.794, Speaker D: Another form we see today in some.
00:20:15.832 - 00:20:19.714, Speaker E: Exchanges, they issue form 1099 B's that.
00:20:19.752 - 00:21:06.494, Speaker D: Has a lot of valuable information for the taxpayer. It has your purchase date for your coins sold date for your coins purchase price, and in some cases the cost basis as well. If you get a form ten, nine and B, that's a very friendly form to you. If the form is complete and if you believe the numbers look right, your job is to just put that information from that form to schedule D and the form 89 49 of the tax agent. And if you're using like a DIY software, it's just an easy way to kind of file your taxes. Now that said, there could be some 1099 B's you're going to be receiving this tax season with missing cost basis. We can talk about why some exchanges cannot figure out the cost basis because how the space works.
00:21:06.494 - 00:21:42.574, Speaker D: But if it says missing cost basis or zero cost phases, you got to find out the cost basis. If you do not find the cost basis, you're going to be paying more taxes on that gross amount because you're not accounting for how much you paid for that coin. So just to summarize, you're going to see 1099 miscellaneous, 1099 K's, 1099 B's, and then finally this is not a tax form, but some exchange is going to issue like a transaction history report, mainly the overseas funds so you can go to their tax center, just download all the transactions you did throughout the year. So that's another type of I guess.
00:21:42.612 - 00:21:45.198, Speaker E: A form that you can expect and.
00:21:45.204 - 00:21:49.946, Speaker D: Then finally no forms at all, right? If you trade it in MetaMask, there's.
00:21:49.978 - 00:21:51.950, Speaker E: Nothing for you to download.
00:21:53.010 - 00:21:56.050, Speaker D: So those are the variations that you can expect this tax season.
00:21:56.390 - 00:22:59.910, Speaker C: I hope someday that the IRS will prescribe a 1099 for digital assets so that it will be a lot easier for taxpayers. And I think she and went through the list of forms, I think when I was at the IRS, we recognize that there's imperfections in the way that the forms report now that they don't prescribe basis. I think the 1099K is probably the least accurate of the ones your 1099 B, if you've sold on one exchange, will be the most accurate. As Shannon said, that the most important thing for the taxpayer to do is to do their best to report the income and their basis as accurately as possible. And if it doesn't exactly match up with what's on the form and your 1099K will never show basis, that's okay. If you have your downloads, if you have your other records to substantiate, that because there's not exactly a one to one match, that's okay. You can still accurately or do your best effort to report the liability.
00:23:00.650 - 00:23:27.230, Speaker A: As you mentioned, there's a whole plethora of different forms that people might get, and in some situations they may not even get a form. So would you recommend that people and obviously well, nothing that we say in the show is advice for any particular person, but how should people decide which type of accountant to use, if one at all? I don't know if tax software is good enough, but how should people think about this decision?
00:23:28.530 - 00:24:15.406, Speaker D: Yeah, I think first of all, I think you're going to need some type of tax software tool because this software tool help you kind of reconcile all your activity across multiple wallets and exchanges, unless you're just using one exchange, which is not the case. A typical crypto user have two to three exchanges. They have transfers in and out. They have coins purchased at different time periods at different prices. So reconciling this activity manually or even using an accountant is virtually impossible. So just know that there are tax software that's going to help you kind of reconcile your entire tax profile so you need that. And then the second, you can use a DIY software like TurboTax in conjunction with one of these tax software, or you can use like a dedicated and.
00:24:15.428 - 00:24:18.858, Speaker E: Accountant to help you file your taxes.
00:24:19.034 - 00:24:41.506, Speaker D: So do not expect your accountant or accounting firm to kind of do these reconciliations. It's impossible, especially if you're a complicated taxpayer. So just know that they're tax software and after you connect everything to a tax software, you can either use a DIY tool or dedicated crypto specialized accountant to file and be compliant with your taxes.
00:24:41.698 - 00:25:04.590, Speaker C: Yeah, I would say especially if you have a complicated situation, accounting firm is at RSM. We're able to help out in very complicated situations. Sometimes it might take an expert to help you reconcile the data you get, especially if you're trading in multiple exchanges or in multiple protocols.
00:25:05.970 - 00:25:31.270, Speaker A: All right, so obviously the other big hot topic from 2021 that involved crypto taxes was the provision from the infrastructure bill that addressed this issue. And it's sort of unclear what the outcome of that was. So can you outline what it is that people need to know about what happened there and what they should do for this year's? Taxes and also, I guess probably future taxes.
00:25:31.690 - 00:25:32.150, Speaker C: Sure.
00:25:32.220 - 00:25:38.600, Speaker D: So the infrastructure bill passed and it had some language that's affecting the crypto community.
00:25:39.130 - 00:25:41.100, Speaker E: I think the main one is that.
00:25:41.630 - 00:26:15.026, Speaker D: The infrastructure bill is mandating cryptocurrency exchanges to issue 1009 B's for the 2023 tax year and onwards. So I'm sure you guys have seen the form 1009 B. This is the form that you get if you trade stocks and securities in a brokerage, like in a Robin Hood or Tdmitrade. So at the end of the year you get this form. It has your sales price, it has your cost basis, your job is to just put those numbers into tax return and you're done. But in the crypto space it doesn't happen. So infrastructure bill is trying to change that.
00:26:15.026 - 00:26:28.230, Speaker D: From the taxpayers point of view, it's actually actually a good thing because if you're just using just one centralized exchange starting 2024 tax season onwards, you're going to get that nice form ten nine.
00:26:28.300 - 00:26:31.482, Speaker E: B and hopefully that has your correct.
00:26:31.536 - 00:27:07.662, Speaker D: Sales price and the correct cost basis. And your tax compliance is going to be super easy assuming you're just using just one cryptocurrency exchange. But in most cases that won't be the case due to the nature of this space. For example, let's think about stocks. In stocks, every stock that you need to buy is in just one brokerage. I don't need to go from Robinhood to TDM trade or I don't need to transfer anything in between brokerages. The other thing is that the stocks don't allow you to buy another type of stock using another type of stock.
00:27:07.662 - 00:28:05.014, Speaker D: For example, if I want to buy Apple and I have Google, I cannot exchange my Google to Apple directly. I got to come into cash and then buy the second stock. But in the crypto it's a reverse of what I said. You see a lot of transfers and people have multiple wallets and exchanges because this exchange offers you higher staking reward. Or this exchange has this coin and 90% majority of the crypto transaction we see today, they are crypto to crypto trades. So when you have these complex transfers going in and out and when you see these token to token transfers, especially between centralized and DFI exchanges, it's good that these centralized exchanges are required to form ten, nine NVS. But capturing the cost basis is going to be nearly impossible in many cases, especially if you're dealing with DFI, which you cannot enforce these rules in a DFI environment because these are protocols, right? There's no teams or anything like that.
00:28:05.014 - 00:28:53.046, Speaker D: So in that case you're going to see a 1009 B, but the cost base is going to be either missing or inaccurate. The other situation where that the 1009 B is going to be incorrect would be if you're self custodying your asset. A lot of people are self custodying their asset for privacy and security reasons. So imagine I have my bitcoin in my ledger wallet, I transfer it to say, Coinbase and I sell it for 50,000. Coinbase would issue me a 50,000 sale, proceed one and but it wouldn't know my cost basis. So there are so many areas where that 1099 B regime could fail in the crypto space. But in my opinion, it's good that the regulators are thinking about it.
00:28:53.046 - 00:29:06.090, Speaker D: And especially if you're just doing crypto exchanges in just one exchanges, 1009 B is going to help people with tax funding obligations, but just don't blindly rely on 1009 NBS. That's my advice.
00:29:06.430 - 00:29:53.274, Speaker C: I agree with Sheen. I think the IRS will use this opportunity in the infrastructure bill probably again to issue a different kind of form at 1099 for digital assets. That will be a little more specific. The infrastructure bill does provide for reporting. If you stay on the major exchanges, they will report transfers to the IRS. So in a lot of ways that will be beneficial to taxpayers, they will see that you transferred from one exchange to another and they will have a record of the acquisition. And the basis where there will be gaps is when you move to where there isn't a third party, where it's a decentralized, as sheehan said, really decentralized exchanges is where there will be a problem.
00:29:53.274 - 00:30:15.086, Speaker C: Or if you transfer money off of the exchange into a cold wallet or your own storage, then the IRS will lose visibility into that. The chance of getting misreported proceeds that don't match up to your basis will increase. So there are limitations. I think though, that the infrastructure bill will help improve the accuracy of the reporting.
00:30:15.278 - 00:30:22.450, Speaker A: And what about businesses that transact in crypto? Are there any particular forms that they might need to file?
00:30:22.950 - 00:31:16.050, Speaker D: Yeah, so there's another provision in the infrastructure bill, code section 60 50 I. So that's mandating businesses who are accepting cryptocurrencies in exchange of $10,000 to file this form called form 8300. Essentially like, let's say I'm going to go to a dealership, I want to buy a car and instead of giving that person $50,000, I'm just sending one bitcoin which is worth $50,000. So now that business is required to file form 8300, disclosing my identity, who I got paid from, my Social Security and the reasons for the transaction, et cetera. It doesn't involve any taxes. It's more about disclosure. So infrastructure bill, actually that form 8300 existed for cash transactions.
00:31:16.050 - 00:31:20.070, Speaker D: Infrastructure bill expanded that into digital assets as well.
00:31:20.220 - 00:31:21.240, Speaker A: And john?
00:31:21.770 - 00:32:16.274, Speaker C: Yeah, I was just going to say the 8300 that part of the law is driven by the Treasury's Financial Enforcement Center. And I think the challenge will be for businesses because I know a lot of businesses are worried about the burden of filing multiple forms. It's not uncommon to receive have activity greater than $10,000. So the challenge will be to get the regulators to try and mimic the regulations to as much as possible to cash. Right now if you receive. Payment in a check that's traceable, you don't file the form. So hopefully we will kind of reach a reporting situation where it mimics cash as much as possible and not just every single transaction of greater than $10,000 in virtual currency.
00:32:16.402 - 00:32:35.470, Speaker A: Yeah, and I know there was concern that this would affect individuals who made trades of more than $10,000 worth, which I think happens pretty often in crypto. So does it look like individuals will have to report on personal identifying information of their transaction partners?
00:32:36.210 - 00:33:07.318, Speaker D: To my knowledge, Laura, this format 300 is applicable only to trado businesses. So you had to be in a business of doing something. And what is a trado business is a matter of facts and circumstances. There's no like a bright line rule or anything like that. So I think the confusion came from what about some of these staking pool providers and et cetera? Those could be treated as a trade of business. Again, depending on the facts and circumstances how involved there is it really a.
00:33:07.324 - 00:33:10.102, Speaker E: Trade of business or something else, but.
00:33:10.156 - 00:33:14.970, Speaker D: It doesn't apply to individual participants. It's for trade of businesses.
00:33:15.630 - 00:33:23.920, Speaker A: All right, so in a moment we're going to talk more about specific scenarios involving crypto transactions. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible.

00:36:55.190 - 00:37:23.606, Speaker A: Back to my conversation with Sheehan and John. So as at the time of this recording, there was a very big tax topic that everyone was discussing recently, and that was a case involving Joshua and Jessica Jarrett. Can one of you recap that case and the kind of the recent development I don't know if outcome is quite the right word and then talk about what that means for crypto investors who participate in Staking.
00:37:23.798 - 00:37:28.582, Speaker D: Sure. So, Jarrett's, there are a couple from Tennessee.
00:37:28.726 - 00:37:33.086, Speaker E: They were staking Tasers during 2019, and.
00:37:33.108 - 00:37:42.106, Speaker D: They received roughly $9,000 worth of Tasing rewards. And then they reported that Staking Rewards as income at the time they received.
00:37:42.138 - 00:37:45.460, Speaker E: It in their 2019 tax return.
00:37:45.830 - 00:37:49.954, Speaker D: And then 2020, they amended the tax.
00:37:49.992 - 00:37:54.114, Speaker E: Return, saying that Staking Rewards should not.
00:37:54.152 - 00:38:09.238, Speaker D: Be taxed at the time of the receipt because Staking Reward is a newly created property. So their argument was that if you're an author and if you're creating a new book and actually, Laura, you had your newly created book recently at the.
00:38:09.244 - 00:38:12.060, Speaker A: Time of this recording, it'll be coming out one week later.
00:38:12.670 - 00:38:13.626, Speaker E: Okay, great.
00:38:13.728 - 00:38:47.134, Speaker D: So you didn't have to pay taxes at the time you're done authoring the book. You pay taxes when you sell your book on Amazon or and when you receive the cash. That's a valid argument. And if you look at the other areas of taxation, imagine that you're like a miner that's actually mining for gold or mineral or something like that. You don't pay taxes at the time you take your resources out of the ground. You pay taxes at the time you sell those newly created property at the market. Same thing goes with farmers.
00:38:47.134 - 00:38:52.630, Speaker D: You don't pay taxes at the time you see your crops coming out of the ground. You pay taxes at the time you.
00:38:52.700 - 00:38:56.262, Speaker E: Take the harvest and go sell it in the market.
00:38:56.316 - 00:38:58.220, Speaker D: So they had the same argument about.
00:38:58.750 - 00:39:06.182, Speaker E: Staking Rewards, and then around 2021, IRS.
00:39:06.326 - 00:39:43.298, Speaker D: Said, okay, it's fine. You're right. We're going to refund you that whatever the excess taxes they had to pay because they reported that staking rewards at the time they received it. Interestingly, Jared said, no, I don't want to accept the refund. I actually want to know the reason why you are issuing me a refund. So Jared wanted to have the refund, the reason for the refund, because if they can get a reason from the IRS, that can set procedure for other stakers. As you know, the proof of stake has become so popular lately.
00:39:43.298 - 00:40:15.200, Speaker D: So that's where we are today. So the latest news in that case was that Jared declined to accept the refund. They're taking this to the court so they can figure out the exact reason, and that reason is going to be super valuable for other stakers to rely on. So that's the case, the case is not finalized yet. And IRS didn't issue any staking specific tax guns or anything like that because that's what you see a lot of people are talking about. But it's a very interesting development in this space.
00:40:15.730 - 00:40:41.670, Speaker C: Yeah, I would just say I agree with Sheen at one point, though, that was part of the problem. The IRS didn't say, you're right, Jarrett's. The IRS just said, here's your money, Jarrett's. Now let's just call it a day and move on. And the Jarrett's are like, well, what about next year? So it'll be interesting to follow, to watch, and to see if we can get more specific guidance.
00:40:41.830 - 00:40:45.020, Speaker A: John and what's your take on why they didn't provide a reason?
00:40:46.430 - 00:41:52.062, Speaker C: I really don't know. I just know that when I was litigating cases, I would like something more to rely on than like A-Q-A or question and answer from the IRS. I think federal judges, they look to the regulations, they look to the law. And really kind of the strongest point that the IRS has out there now is a question pertaining to mining that was issued back in 2014. And I just know that if I went into federal court and I gave the judge a question and answer from the IRS that wasn't a regulation, they would look a scance upon that, I think. So I'm not exactly sure why they didn't give an answer, but it really is reflective. I think that the guidance isn't very strong, leaves a possibility, an opening for the taxpayers to take a position that staking income is created property and it's not recognized until you actually sell or exchange it.
00:41:52.062 - 00:41:55.598, Speaker C: Just like when you sell your book or when you sell your crops.
00:41:55.774 - 00:42:10.840, Speaker A: And so, as we said earlier, nothing in this show is tax advice. But for all the different people who did earn stinking income this year, how would you expect most of them or their accountants to decide how to handle this?
00:42:11.290 - 00:42:54.622, Speaker D: I see taxpayers, some taxpayers are conservative, so they are still fine reporting income at the time they receive it, and then they will recognize income when they later sell it. Honestly, it's a matter of timing. Because let me give you an example, because when I say it's a matter of timing, the people wouldn't understand. So let's say you receive like a Taser's reward today, which is for $2, and then you decide to go on the conservative route and you report that $2 today at the time you receive it. And then later you're selling it for $20. And when you sell it for $20, you would report $18 worth of capital gains because you established a cost basis by reporting that $2 worth of income. So that's a conservative route.
00:42:54.622 - 00:43:36.494, Speaker D: And that's what a lot of people have been doing up until this case. Now, in case if you want to be, I don't want to say aggressive, I want to say non conservative. And follow the Jared's case, you could decide not to report any income at the time you receive that Taser's reward in my case. So you received $2 worth of Tasers reward, but you decide not to report any income. So zero income and a couple of years later, you would sell that Tasers for $20. In that case, you would report $20 worth of capital gains. So if you compare the two transactions, you would end up recognizing the same amount of income subject to taxes.
00:43:36.494 - 00:43:56.246, Speaker D: But it's just a matter of timing. In the conservative one, you report a little bit of income today, and then you defer that other income to later. In the non conservative way. You don't pay taxes today whatsoever, but it doesn't mean that you're completely immune from taxation. You got to pay taxes for the entire amount when you later sell it.
00:43:56.428 - 00:44:14.080, Speaker C: I don't mean to interrupt you, Shane, but I would say that when you sold it, if you didn't recognize gain upon receipt, then it would be ordinary gain. It would be ordinary income if your sales were later on, if you treated it as created property.
00:44:15.570 - 00:44:37.122, Speaker D: Makes sense. So those are the two approach that I see like a lot of people are taking. And I've also seen from some of my accounting colleagues that they're getting requests from taxpayers asking can they amend the return based on the case law. Because typically you can only amend up to the past three years and request a refund.
00:44:37.266 - 00:44:40.566, Speaker E: So it's also a timing thing, right?
00:44:40.588 - 00:45:14.830, Speaker D: Because if you have been proof of stake earning rewards for a while now, the small window that you have to amend the return and get back the refund is closing. So that's another thing the accountants are dealing with. I would say talk to your accountant and see if it's worth amending the return. For example, if it costs you $1,000 to amend the return and your refund is going to be $800, it doesn't make any sense because you're going to be@a.net loss position. So talk to an accountant. Amending is a somewhat complex process.
00:45:14.830 - 00:45:16.338, Speaker D: I would not encourage you to do.
00:45:16.344 - 00:45:18.258, Speaker E: It on your own, talk to an.
00:45:18.264 - 00:45:21.746, Speaker D: Accountant, weigh the pros and cons and see what's right for you.
00:45:21.928 - 00:45:37.510, Speaker A: All right, so let's also now talk about tokens that get Rebased. And what that means would be tokens where the circulating supply of those tokens is changed. How should people who own such tokens calculate their taxes?
00:45:38.170 - 00:45:57.086, Speaker D: I think the right answer is nobody knows. And I would love to get Joan's thoughts as well. IRS hasn't issued any guidance on this. Again, whenever there's gray areas and in the crypto space, there's so many gray areas, I like to take two know conservative position is to report income at.
00:45:57.108 - 00:45:58.640, Speaker E: The time you're receiving it.
00:45:59.490 - 00:46:32.874, Speaker D: Income under the IRS code, it's covered by section 61. It's a very broad code section. So unless something is specifically excluded from that, it's typically or it's safe to say that's income. I know it's not super taxpayer friendly, but that's how it is. So if you're going through that super conservative route, I don't want to get into any type of even like a remote travel from the IRS. I will report those Rebasing tokens at the time you receive it, establish the cost basis, and when you later sell it, you would have a capital gain or capital loss event. Again, it's a timing difference.
00:46:32.874 - 00:46:43.318, Speaker D: And if you want to kind of rely on this Jared's case, because most of these Rebasing tokens are based on some type of staking type of mechanism, you could decide not to report any.
00:46:43.344 - 00:46:46.474, Speaker E: Income and then recognize the full gain.
00:46:46.522 - 00:46:53.120, Speaker D: When you later sell those Rebasing tokens into cash or another type of token. So those are the two approaches that I would take.
00:46:53.910 - 00:47:54.340, Speaker C: I would agree. I think you would definitely want to talk to an accountant, especially based upon the protocol of the case and some of the Rebasing tokens, the amount, the fluctuation, the Rebasing can incur quite rapidly. I want to say that the answer can't be you have to do it every single time that there is a Rebase, but we don't really know for certain. I think you'd need to talk to an accountant to examine the protocol of these actual token. But kind of what sheehan describes is if there isn't a lack of guidance and if the taxpayer takes a reasonable and consistent position, I think then the taxpayer is probably in a safe place on an auditor or clearly in a safe place for any kind of accuracy related penalties. As long as if they do what's practical, what's reasonable, and they're consistent, you can't take one position on one year and then take an inconsistent position or a different position on another year.
00:47:55.030 - 00:48:23.280, Speaker A: Okay. And there were a couple of other big events. One was that this past year there were a few different groups that received airdrops, and there are slightly different types of airdrops from years past. One was for users of Ethereum name service, and the other was for users of OpenSea. How would those airdrops be taxed for the different groups affected by those?
00:48:23.810 - 00:48:47.986, Speaker D: I actually tweeted about this as well, but just to kind of keep it at a high level. So the way that we're seeing airdrops are happening today, in my opinion, has changed a lot. If you compare it to past three, four years, I remember back in 2016, 2017, you would set up some type of wallet and next day you open up your wallet and your balance has increased because of an AirDrop.
00:48:48.018 - 00:48:56.006, Speaker E: So it just gets credit automatically. But 2020 and even 2021, the way.
00:48:56.028 - 00:49:36.354, Speaker D: That these protocols conduct these airdrops have changed a lot. So typically they announce and then you got to go to a dedicated website and pay some gas or some type of fee and claim the AirDrop. So the question is, when is it taxed? Is it at the time you have the knowledge of the AirDrop or is it at the time you actually claim the AirDrop? The answer it depends. It depends. Again, there's no exact rules that have been issued by the IRS on the airdrops. Some people believe that the 2019 24 revenue ruling issued by the IRS address airdrops. I don't believe so.
00:49:36.354 - 00:50:09.150, Speaker D: If you read the revenue ruling, they're talking about an AirDrop that happens after a hard folk. So the wording there is a little bit confusing because airdrops and hard folks are two mutually exclusive things. Airdrops don't happen after a hard folk. Obviously. Yes, you get free coins, but that's not an AirDrop. Now, that said, some of the concept that we mentioned in that revenue ruling is important for us to kind of form an opinion on how these new types of airdrops should be taxed. So just kind of by relying on.
00:50:09.220 - 00:50:14.334, Speaker E: IRS's logic, if it's a claimable AirDrop.
00:50:14.462 - 00:50:20.446, Speaker D: It should be taxed, in my opinion, at the time you claim it. Because when you claim it, you gain.
00:50:20.478 - 00:50:23.940, Speaker E: Dominion and control over the asset and.
00:50:24.310 - 00:50:40.538, Speaker D: You claim it and you report income equivalent to the market price at the time you claim it. And that's a taxable event for you. And if you decide not to claim it, then you don't have a taxable event and you let it expire. And that's completely fine too. I'm pretty sure there's so many people.
00:50:40.624 - 00:50:44.854, Speaker E: Who didn't claim these things because they had no knowledge.
00:50:44.902 - 00:50:54.160, Speaker D: And if we keep saying that, okay, you got a tax AirDrop at the time you receive it, what about the people who don't even know about it? It just doesn't make any sense.
00:50:55.570 - 00:51:32.570, Speaker C: I've also seen people claim them, but because they're so new, because they're almost impossible to value, that they give a minimal value at the time of receipt, recognizing that if they later sell it, they have little or no basis would they actually sell it and they will recognize the gain. So I think that's also another reasonable position. If it's a brand new coin that many of them just go valueless very quickly anyways, just assign it a minimal value upon receipt.
00:51:33.230 - 00:51:45.840, Speaker A: So due to high gas fees this past year, there were also a lot of people that were transacting on L2s, moving money there. How are those transactions taxed, if at all?
00:51:46.210 - 00:52:23.530, Speaker D: Yeah, so if we strictly follow the IRS rules again, I would love to hear Joan's opinion here as well. You're spending gas fee, meaning you're disposing of a property, in this case, ethereum. Disposing of a property creates a taxable event. So each time we paid gas fees, you're disposing of an ethereum. And if that ethereum has appreciated in value, that gas fee creates a capital gain. And if that ethereum or a small portion of ethereum has depreciated in value, that gas fee creates a capital loss. So that's how I would approach gas fees.
00:52:23.950 - 00:52:42.830, Speaker C: I would agree that if you pay your gas fees with a coin, that is a disposition of the coin, and it can create a gain or a loss, the proceeds from that transaction, though the actual fee itself, you may be able to capitalize into the acquired coin as a cost of the transaction.
00:52:43.590 - 00:53:07.190, Speaker A: All right. And then there was another big phenomenon this year. It really started the year prior, but I guess we could say earlier it might have been limited to other geographies. There are a lot of people playing play to earn games such as Axio Infinity. And for those players, how would their earnings or losses be taxed?
00:53:08.170 - 00:53:41.294, Speaker D: Again, I would rely on the section 61 of the IRS code. I encourage everybody to just Google section 61 and see what it says. Section 61 defines gross income. Again, it's a very broad code section. Anything that you receive is generally treated as income otherwise, unless it's otherwise specifically excluded from that code section. So if you're playing a game and if you're earning something, if you rely on the general tax principle that constitutes a taxable income. Now there's an argument.
00:53:41.294 - 00:54:21.486, Speaker D: I mean, is it newly created property, right? If it's newly created property, you can take two positions. So generally speaking, if you want to be conservative, I would report those new tokens that you receive when you win something or when you achieve certain milestones as income. Again, going with the conservative approach, that establishes your cost basis and when you later sell it, that creates a capital gain. Or you can take that other approach, okay, these are newly created tokens and I want to kind of rely on this Jared's case and not going to report anything at the time I receive it. I'm going to pick up that entire income when you later sell it. So those are the two ways that I would approach that question.
00:54:21.668 - 00:54:35.886, Speaker C: I think the second point is a variation of the Jarrett's argument that if it's in the game, the coins earned in the game are created property. And until it actually leaves the game or leaves the protocol that it's not taxable.
00:54:35.998 - 00:54:56.620, Speaker A: Okay, so because we're kind of running out of time, I'm going to do lightning rounds. So I'll just ask one of you to discuss each of the next scenarios. When people have bought or sold virtual land in different virtual realities, how are those transactions taxed? And John, do you want to take this one?
00:54:57.070 - 00:55:05.550, Speaker C: Sure. Virtual land is not real property. Virtual land is personal property and it's taxed like any other token.
00:55:06.130 - 00:55:16.350, Speaker A: Okay. And for when people wrap tokens such as wrapping bitcoin on ethereum or wrapping ETH on solana, how would those transactions be taxed?
00:55:16.430 - 00:55:57.662, Speaker D: Sheehan I hate to give this answer, but it depends. If you're going from bitcoin to wrap bitcoin, it's more likely, it's very likely that it's not a taxable event because an exchange has a knocker. In order for an exchange to happen under the IRS regulations, your tax ownership need to go from you to another person. If I'm giving one bitcoin to the wrap protocol, if I'm receiving wrap bitcoin, I haven't exchanged anything. I'm in the same economic position as I was earlier. So in that case, that's not a taxable event, but there could be other wrapping situations that could trigger a taxable event. So I'm not going to go into that because everything it's different.
00:55:57.662 - 00:55:59.550, Speaker D: So we got to talk to economists.
00:56:00.130 - 00:56:06.142, Speaker A: Okay, and so for people who use credit cards that give crypto rewards, how are those taxed?
00:56:06.206 - 00:56:25.586, Speaker C: John I think for the most part that they're treated as rebates from purchases just like your cash back on your current cards. So those aren't considered taxable because it's really just a reduction in purchase price that's borne by the card issuer or the vendor.
00:56:25.778 - 00:56:34.134, Speaker A: But then is that income, though? Because if you receive crypto, is it like so when you receive the crypto.
00:56:34.182 - 00:56:44.538, Speaker C: It would be a rebate. If you then later sell it, then it would be a taxable sale and you would not have had any basis in that coin that you sold.
00:56:44.634 - 00:56:58.482, Speaker A: Oh, got it. Okay, in general, what problems would you say crypto people face each year when they go to pay their taxes? Like, what are some of the kind of trends that you like common pitfalls that you see?
00:56:58.536 - 00:57:01.666, Speaker E: Sheehan yeah, I think a lot of.
00:57:01.688 - 00:57:26.634, Speaker D: People, they don't even know where to start. I think that's the common pitfall and common thing that we see. A lot of people are getting different types of tax room, the exchanges and some exchanges are not providing any tax forms and people get confused. Okay, what should I rely on type of thing. I would say those are the main things. Last but not least, just kind of blindly relying on tax forms issued by the exchanges. I wouldn't do that.
00:57:26.634 - 00:57:53.730, Speaker D: Just make sure they look right to you because by the way, don't blame of the exchanges and exchanges are doing the best they can. If they don't do that, they're going to get penalized as well and just know that they're working with limited information that they have because they only have access to what you're doing inside that exchange. So just don't blindly rely on any of the 1099, just make sure you reconcile them and talk to an accountant. Use a crypto tax software tool to get to the truth.
00:57:54.070 - 00:58:02.470, Speaker A: And John, what are some ways that people can save on their taxes, particularly if they are heavy crypto users?
00:58:03.210 - 00:58:47.910, Speaker C: If they're heavy crypto users, I would encourage people to use a lot of the available software that are out there. They enable you to right now crypto, since it's specific, you can specify if you want to sell high basis assets or low basis assets. You have a lot of flexibility on which lots you want to sell when you use the software and some of them even allow you to program in. I want to sell high this week, I want to sell low next week. In that case, that's perfectly fine as long as you don't sell the same lot twice. So I would encourage people that are heavy users of crypto to use a software program to help track basis.
00:58:48.410 - 00:58:57.334, Speaker A: And what about wash sales in crypto and other ways of tax loss harvesting? What would you recommend know?
00:58:57.372 - 00:59:42.310, Speaker C: I know she has written a lot about that there are no provisions involving wash sales. I'm a little concerned with sales that happen instantaneously that the IRS might take the position that the sale they could ignore the economic substance of that transaction. I would prefer to see a little period of time between a buy and a sell before you harvest your tax losses because then it looks more like a realistic that they are two independent transactions. So that is true that there is no wash sale rule but a danger of the IRS ignoring the economic substance of your transaction if it happens instantaneously.
00:59:43.290 - 01:00:10.000, Speaker A: Okay, so in general, I have done a show on crypto taxes pretty much every year for the last, I think like I'm not sure, four or five years, I don't remember how many years. But the point is that it's definitely an evolving space. So going forward, how would you and both of you now can answer this, how would you expect that crypto taxes will evolve in the future?
01:00:11.010 - 01:00:57.354, Speaker D: Let me start here. I guess I think the taxes need to be rethought in a decentralized role. I actually tweeted about that, Laura, I think you shared that. I think the world is moving from an account based financial system to a wallet based financial system. So in an account based financial system, which is the one that we are living today, if you want to start your financial journey, you would go to Robinhoods or Coinbase of the world. You set up an account using a username and a password and your account is tied to your actual real world identity to this process called KYC know your customers. So you have the exchanges, you have you, and then you have the IRS, the exchanges or the brokerages, they work as a third party information report to the IRS.
01:00:57.354 - 01:01:41.802, Speaker D: And that's why you get these form 1099. So whenever you get a form 1099, that information has already been reported to the IRS by the intermediary, the third party, in this case the exchange. Now the tax works in that type of environment because of that third party information system, right? Because you get triggered to file taxes when you get some type of tax form. That's a simple story. Now that's in an account based system, so the tax compliance is very high when you get that tax form because there's a third party to kind of see your transaction, report it to the IRS, which imposes taxes. Now we are seeing more and more protocols and founders. They're building stuff on Web Three which is based on wallets.
01:01:41.802 - 01:02:41.002, Speaker D: Like, take a look at platforms like Wallets OpenSea. Like you can sign up for OpenSea using a pseudo anonymous wallet and you are interacting directly with other people. And then the OpenSea as a protocol kind of facilitate that transaction. But they're not a third party that knows who you are or they don't do any type of KYC because of how the Web Three functions. So in that type of environment, this whole 1009 Nt third party information reporting system breaks because you're literally doing transaction peer to peer, facilitated by some type of protocol, but not an intermediary in that type of environment. So we really had to set the right incentives for people to pay taxes. Regulators had to be very creative when it comes to figuring out even taxable events and not only coming up with new regulations, but just to make sure that those are enforceable in that type of pseudo anonymous environment.
01:02:41.002 - 01:02:51.250, Speaker D: So I would say the next several years we're going to see a lot of people talking about this issue and hopefully we can find out a solution that's beneficial for everybody.
01:02:51.400 - 01:02:55.460, Speaker A: And John, with your years of experience with the IRS, do you think that's possible?
01:02:56.150 - 01:03:17.210, Speaker C: I think it will take a lot of cooperation or a lot of work with developers in the industry. The issue really with the wallet based taxes is not third party reporting. So the answer won't be third party reporting. The answer will be proper development of protocols to help taxpayers that use wallet based systems to actually report their tax liability.
01:03:18.670 - 01:03:24.320, Speaker A: Okay, right. I mean, that's the thing. I feel like it's a little bit more like an honor system.
01:03:24.770 - 01:04:13.334, Speaker C: It is an honor system. But if it's a true independent wallet based system, maybe pseudo anonymous, but I think eventually the taxpayers, if they might need to leave the system, they would need to convert to fiat. I think taxpayers run the risk of assuming just because I'm operating in a DeFi environment in a wallet based. Environment, that there's no third party reporting, that I don't need to report my gains and losses from that. Eventually, those assets need to be converted. Those assets are exchanged. Eventually there's something that could trigger a recognition or an audit.
01:04:13.462 - 01:04:50.970, Speaker A: Yeah, I think the other thing I wonder about is as the industry moves more toward privacy, what that is really going to mean, because then I think it will be even. Um, but I think that's a bit further down the road, we'll see. One other thing I wanted to mention was I happened to notice that the IRS posted a job, or it might have been like a contractor position, and essentially they were looking for someone who could exploit develop exploits for crypto wallets for seizure. Can you talk a little bit more about what you think that might mean and what the IRS is looking to do with this posting?
01:04:51.550 - 01:05:39.030, Speaker C: I don't know for certain, but just based upon what I've read publicly in other instances, is that the IRS will aggressively seize assets for a taxpayer, a recalcitrant taxpayer, and that could involve a cold wallet, that could involve investigatory techniques. So the IRS will use other means to actually seize property of taxpayer's property, especially if they believe the taxpayer is attempting to move the property outside of the reach or to hide it. So I think the IRS recognizes some of the limitations of third party reporting and is not going to rely solely on that to enforce the tax laws.
01:05:39.610 - 01:05:52.400, Speaker A: All right, to wrap up, is there anything else that either of you feel that crypto people need to know about paying their taxes this year, or did we manage to cover all the important issues?
01:05:53.570 - 01:06:09.490, Speaker C: I think, again, make your best efforts. Use the information you have, and when you're stuck, consult someone and an accountant and that you'll be well positioned should you be audited by the IRS.
01:06:10.790 - 01:06:14.418, Speaker A: All right. Okay. And Shehan, is there anything else that.
01:06:14.424 - 01:06:23.654, Speaker D: You wanted to lastly, I know taxes suck. Unfortunately, we had to report them and.
01:06:23.692 - 01:06:26.374, Speaker E: Pay your fair share of taxes at the same time.
01:06:26.412 - 01:06:47.966, Speaker D: Just know that there are so many legal ways that you can save your tax bills, like taxless harvesting, getting a loan against money, and earning credit card rewards and et cetera. So just use the tax code to your advantage going forward. Don't think about taxes only at the tax time. Think about taxes throughout the year. That's the way to minimize your tax bill.
01:06:48.148 - 01:06:52.400, Speaker A: Okay, great. Where can people learn more about each of you and your work?
01:06:53.350 - 01:07:02.260, Speaker D: I'm pretty active on Twitter. My handle is at the cryptocpa. You can find me writing on the Cointrecker IO blog and Forbes as well.
01:07:03.030 - 01:07:12.754, Speaker C: And we're at rsmus.com. We have an excellent digital asset practice and we're know can help any taxpayers with their liabilities.
