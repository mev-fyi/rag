00:01:40.590 - 00:01:49.360, Speaker B: Hey, Laura. It's great to be back. Thank you very much for having me on, and I am so excited to read your book.
00:01:50.770 - 00:01:51.918, Speaker A: I think this is going to be.
00:01:51.924 - 00:02:14.120, Speaker B: The defining story of how Ethereum has unfolded, and I imagine it was probably really difficult to edit with just all of the crazy stories that have unfolded. And so I can't wait to read it. I know it's been a long time coming, and we're grateful for the contributions that you continue to make for our space.
00:02:14.810 - 00:02:52.638, Speaker A: Thanks, Ryan. Yeah, people will see the book starts with a list of characters because, yes, when you are describing decentralized worlds, there's a lot of people to keep track of. But people who know nothing about crypto and who've read it have told me, yes, they are able to follow. And through various quizzes I've given them, yes, I realized, okay, they really did learn stuff. So it's pretty cool to see. Anyway. Okay, you recently spent $29 million, which is the highest amount of money ever paid for a single NFT on Human One by Mike Winkleman.
00:02:52.638 - 00:03:07.240, Speaker A: By the way, you guys, I've barely slept and so has Ryan. So I think this is going to be a very fun conversation. Mike Winkleman is beeple. Most people know. Tell us why it is that you decided to bid on Human One and how you came to own it.
00:03:07.790 - 00:03:57.702, Speaker B: So I've been developing a relationship with Mike ever since I bought the Dick milking factory back in the spring. And what deeply resonated with me with respect to Human One is the fact that it's this evolving piece which will fundamentally change the relationship between collector and artist over many, many years. This piece will evolve, and he'll continue to add to it over time. So when I looked at it, I thought, this isn't one piece. This is actually many pieces. And sort of looked at it, I guess, in a different way than that. And I don't think the world fundamentally understood how many pieces this will be or just how big this project will be.
00:03:57.702 - 00:04:10.250, Speaker B: And I thought that was really interesting, and I could embark on this multi year journey with my good friend who I just really like, and we get along really then.
00:04:10.320 - 00:04:16.206, Speaker A: Actually, before you keep going on, can you just describe the artwork for listeners since not everybody has seen it?
00:04:16.388 - 00:05:15.570, Speaker B: Sure. Well, I certainly would encourage everyone to take a look at a YouTube video of just Human One, all caps, one spelt on e. But essentially, it's a sculpture that is rotating sort of in this very methodical way. And today, within the sculpture is a 3D moving image of an explorer. I would say it sort of looks kind of like an astronaut right now, but one would refer to them as an explorer that's slowly traversing different digital lands. And the important thing here is that this is a meditation on mankind's first steps into the metaverse. And we're all confronted with this conversation of our dual identities that we all now have between our digital identity and our real world identity.
00:05:15.570 - 00:05:36.406, Speaker B: Human One is the first metaverse native, which then invokes this conversation and this set of questions that I think is very timely and poignant for society right now. And I thought that the piece is important in that regard, and so how.
00:05:36.428 - 00:05:46.570, Speaker A: Did you come to acquire it? And I interrupted you. So, yeah, I don't know if there was more that you wanted to say earlier, too, about how it was evolving and your relationship with Mike Et.
00:05:47.150 - 00:07:39.694, Speaker B: Know, talking back and forth with Know, I knew that this was something that was really special, that had come together relatively quickly, but he felt like was a seminal piece in his own career. And it's really important to note that Mike has deeply impacted the arc and trajectory of digital art along his entire career before, when he was doing sort of concert videos and music videos and really experimenting to the everydays, which has become this global movement. And that commitment, just that stoic commitment of creating art every single day, honing and mastering your craft, I think, is a really pure story that people really resonate with. You could tell in talking with him that this piece marked a really significant step change in his own career, and that when you talk to him about it, you can see that he's deeply committed, that this is like another commitment on the lines of the everydays where he's going to continue to update and evolve this piece and collaborate with others. And I felt like I wanted to take a real swing at owning this piece as I've sort of matured in my own collection. Over the course of the last two years, I've migrated away from kind of, like many different experimental purchases to a few purchases of higher quality, more sort of historical importance that I can have kind of a deeper relationship with. And this was an absolutely perfect one.
00:07:39.694 - 00:08:11.240, Speaker B: So I didn't think I was going to get it. Chrissy's, I don't think, thought that I was going to be the winner. I think I was able to capture a fleeting moment in time before very well capitalized traditional art patrons enter in the space and have the confidence in themselves to make a bid like this. I think in a future moment, a piece like this would not be available to a collector like myself at this kind of price point.
00:08:12.650 - 00:08:24.880, Speaker A: And why do you say that? What kind of is happening in the market now? And where do you think it's going? And just out of curiosity, how is it that Christie's even gave you the impression they thought you wouldn't get it?
00:08:26.370 - 00:09:39.650, Speaker B: Well, they admitted to me after the fact, so they just straight out said that, yeah, we're not expecting you to win and for you to win at that price, because Mike had spent a bunch of time with sort of your very famous who's who canon of traditional art patrons. And one would have expected that they would come to the mat on that night and be biding really hard, but it wasn't the case. The bid, to my understanding, landed between myself and another crypto native. And so we're seeing this moment where traditional art patrons are not really yet taking the deep dive. Like, I would say, everybody's top five or top seven most important pieces of digital art, or NFTs, are not owned by traditional art collections. They are taking a standoffish approach at this point, but inevitably, they will have to enter. It'll be a question of their own survival.
00:09:39.650 - 00:10:31.670, Speaker B: They're not going to be able to poo poo this for that long. And so I expect this to evolve very quickly. And that's why I think that over the next year, certainly, definitely too, you'll see more acceptance among traditional art patrons and traditional art institutions. This piece has been the first piece that has created a conversation with sort of leading art institutions around the world that want to display an important piece of digital art that kind of represents their own first foray into the metaverse. As I've seen these conversations come up with human one, I'm optimistic that we are moving in the right direction and quicker than traditional art would usually move in a new direction.
00:10:32.090 - 00:11:05.070, Speaker A: Super interesting. So we're going to have to talk a little bit more about that because I have questions. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible. Did you know that exchanges take up to a 25% cut on your staking rewards? But you don't need an exchange to stake.

So you were just at Art Basel Miami, and you were talking about how, you know, the traditional art world maybe is sort of coming around. And I was curious, kind of like what you saw there, what your take is now on how the traditional art world is looking at NFTs and how that's know.
00:12:02.632 - 00:13:36.082, Speaker B: I think Miami is a microcosm for how the art world is treating NFTs, where within the Miami Fair, there is almost nothing with respect to digital art and NFTs. There was one booth that was sort of dedicated to traditional art and NFTs. Whereas all of the buzz, all of the energy that was happening in the city around the week were around the NFT drops, like the Rafique Annadel piece on the beach yesterday evening or Beeple's work or just other digital artists doing drops like, for example, Christie's and OpenSea doing the Mad Dog Jones drop later. This so everyone's talking about digital art and NFTs, whereas the sort of powers to be who curated the core event are almost like missing the opportunity to integrate it into the core of the event. I think it was a bit of a missed opportunity in that regard. And again, they'll have to evolve very quickly because it will matter for art buddies to continue to enjoy the lead or the premier position that it has. It will not be the premier art fair on the planet in five years if they don't get serious about digital art very quickly.
00:13:36.082 - 00:14:09.980, Speaker B: And so it was an interesting thing to see that unfold in that way with the outside being the thing that everybody was talking about and the inside being this kind of sort of stodgy outdone, not that newer, innovative event. There's nothing new in the affair in Miami that you wouldn't have saw in 2019. Right. Everything new and fresh and interesting was happening outside, which is related to NFTs and digital art.
00:14:10.750 - 00:14:53.660, Speaker A: Well, so people in the NFT world themselves have even, like, Beeple, mike said this himself that he agrees that NFTs are in a bubble, and that pretty much all not all, but the vast majority of the NFTs being sold will someday be worthless. He's said this. So how do you kind of reconcile that view that he has? Along with I'm sure you're well aware, a lot of traditional artists or art collectors have looked at NFTs and said, oh, I don't see anything of value. So in a way, they sort of agree. And yet it seems like you don't see those two viewpoints as being the same. So can you talk about that a little bit?
00:14:54.430 - 00:15:40.786, Speaker B: Definitely. So anytime that we've seen really compelling new technologies being applied to a market, you get this sort of gartner hype cycle EB and flow to it. And this happened with ICOs, and now it's happening with NFTs, where you'll have this run. And yes, 90 plus percent of what's created in the run up will prove to be worthless over time. But let's not miss the forest for the trees here. And remember that the 10% that does survive will go on to be incredibly valuable assets, will be incredibly important pieces of infrastructure and technology in our society. And so this will happen with NFTs.
00:15:40.786 - 00:16:51.600, Speaker B: It probably happens sometime in the next twelve to 18 months, where a lot of your ten k PFP projects and, and different sort of lower quality pieces of art will prove to be relatively worthless. But there will be that upper crust that will survive, that will flourish, and that will do really well. This is true of the artists and this is true of the art across a range of different categories. And so I'm very optimistic that even though we're going to see this flush out of lower quality, that that's just the natural ebb and flow of technology applied to markets. And that's okay, we embrace that. And beyond that, you're also going to see other art categories picking up the slack such that the general market is expanding. So I think 2022 is going to be a great year for music, NFTs and spatial AR VR NFTs, and thinking about art in this more interactive way.
00:16:51.600 - 00:17:01.970, Speaker B: And so the pie will grow even though we're sort of culling as we yeah, yeah.
00:17:02.040 - 00:17:21.674, Speaker A: And I think I'm just trying to remember somebody else on my show made a similar sentiment, and it might have been Devin Finzer of OpenSea, the CEO. I'll have to check. Yes, I mean, I think that's true know crypto in general, and then how.
00:17:21.712 - 00:18:27.326, Speaker B: I navigate this moving forward is the same way that I've used since I've come into collecting, which is I use this concept that I call proof of artwork. And proof of artwork draws on a sort of baseline concept around proof of work. That the baseline lowest possible value of a proof of work network is the total sum of the capex and opex that has brought the code base and the network or the ledger to that moment. Right. And so all of the investment that has gone into that to that moment is your baseline minimum cost. And when I look at a piece of digital art, I ask myself how much training and artistic merit and time and collaboration and just effort and human resources have gone into the creation of this work. What that does is give me a baseline of like, okay, this is at least worth this.
00:18:27.326 - 00:19:28.050, Speaker B: And then I can kind of reason for how I should think about value with that piece. What that does is it causes me to miss out on some of your more cheeky pieces, like the Pack Pixel or like an X copy would not be a thing that I resonate with, but it leaves me with a portfolio of really high quality digital art that's very technically sophisticated and future forward. Things like Brandon Dahl's work or Rafique Anadel's work or Mike Beeple's work, where I can see and feel and understand very intuitively the amount of time and effort and resources that went into creating that piece of digital art. And so I just try to stay true to that north and know that things will kind of work themselves out if I've got that kind of baseline covered in this concept of proof of artwork.
00:19:29.750 - 00:20:26.706, Speaker A: One thing I wanted to ask you to talk about a little bit more was your personal relationship with Mikebeople. You were talking about how this artwork will change over time and how, I mean, you guys are kind of like essentially friends. And I guess I was just thinking what's fascinating to me is so in a way, you're going to be able to most likely influence the development of your own of this artwork that you own. I think that would be my guess. And it's just kind of interesting because it just made me think that a long time ago, kind of when there were things like Patrons of the Arts and not like we don't have that today, but just kind of in that more old model, you might be seen as something like that, but probably the relationship was quite different. And so I'm just kind of curious how you view that relationship now in the context of I mean, I think.
00:20:26.808 - 00:21:18.340, Speaker B: This is a really fun part of it that we get to collaborate in this regard. And I want to make it clear that it's not going to be like me calling up Mike and being like, hey, it's my birthday. Put a birthday hat on the guy or can you make it look more like me? Or something like that. It's not going to be like that. Part of our relationship is really good because I have a deep sort of reverence and respect for the stoic path that he's walked to become the standard bearer of digital art. At the same time, it is really interesting to be able to jam in ideas and talk about different things. And I flew down there to Charleston earlier this week and was completely I'm still taken aback and have goosebumps thinking about this.
00:21:18.340 - 00:22:31.742, Speaker B: So Mike was like, yeah, come down to the studio. And I was thinking I'd go down there and be know, a big garage and he's got some screens and stuff that he does his art on and that's kind of the end of it. And he does these really interesting physical pieces where I think really he and Rafiq are the leaders in this kind of relationship between the physical and the digital piece. So he does physicals for all of his digital piece, which, again, just sort of deepen the relationship that he has with his collectors. I get down there and it's not a studio, it's a full on sprawling campus. And he has a whole bunch of aerospace engineers working for him and different artists on this massive sort of warehouse that has all these offices and rooms and different things and different people doing different things. It honestly seemed like this crazy mix of Warhol studio with Bell Labs where they've got like 3D printers and laser cutters and they're just doing these wild things.
00:22:31.742 - 00:23:45.698, Speaker B: That completely blew my mind. And so when you get this sense of just how much they're willing to push the envelope and move things forward and his brother Scott is a really brilliant engineer and very fundamental to the whole team. It's funny, it takes a community. And when I think about this rationally at this point in retrospect, very clearly it couldn't be all one guy doing all this stuff. It's all one guy doing the pure digital digital pieces, but all of the support around him, like 3D printing these collector pieces and experimenting with doing these large scale, real world manifestations of what was otherwise a surreal looking digital piece, it's pretty remarkable. I think Charleston is going to be this hotbed of innovation in the space as he continues to bring in artists around him. What's going on down there in Charleston is something very unique and very special.
00:23:45.698 - 00:24:21.566, Speaker B: So I'm just glad to be a witness to it and be a part of it. And I'm just glad that we get along. So we he grew up in Wisconsin. It's not that far from where I grew up in Canada. We're about six months difference in age. And so from the moment we started chatting with each other, especially because I had bought something comical and interesting like the Dick Milking factory, we just kind of hit it off as fast friends and just like shit, talk and swear and stuff like that with each other. A huge part.
00:24:21.566 - 00:24:53.580, Speaker B: This sounds kind of flippant and cheeky, but it's not. A huge part of the reason why I bought the piece is because I was like, well, I get to buy this relationship with this amazing human being who I want to be around for the next 2030 years, this thing will pay for itself in belly laughs with my friends many times over. So that feels like a better investment than some faceless person.
00:24:54.350 - 00:25:21.300, Speaker A: I just want to give listeners context. You spent more than $500,000 on that. I mean, your your the cost of belly laughs for you is different than for other people, I just needed to point out. But okay, we don't need to dissect that more than we just did. But I did want to ask you before we go, where do you think NFTs will go over the next year or so?
00:25:21.750 - 00:26:11.550, Speaker B: Well, as I mentioned, I think we're going to see a washout and a sort of migration to quality. And that's why I spend more time on kind of like single pieces that I'm more excited about than collecting a piece a day or ten pieces a week or something like that. But nonetheless, the pie will expand because new categories are emerging, like Spatial VR NFTs, which we're really excited about. More things in play to earn gaming will emerge. Photography NFTs are starting to have a bit of a moment. Music NFTs are going to be massive. Music NFTs music, to my knowledge, is the largest category of art, so it'll make sense that music NFTs are also the largest category of NFTs.
00:26:11.550 - 00:26:44.640, Speaker B: Over time, I would think, let's see Wu Tang kind of tried it sort of pre having the technology to do it as a one of one, but I think other artists will follow suit in that regard over time. And so while there will be pain over the next year, certainly maybe in the visual art NFT space, that's just the natural EB and flows of markets, and we should be used to that in our community by now.
00:26:46.130 - 00:26:51.790, Speaker A: All right, well, we will have to see how it all plays out. Thank you so much for coming on Unconfirmed.
00:26:52.210 - 00:26:53.550, Speaker B: Thank you, Laura.

Before we dive in, I just wanted to urge you to check out four articles that I published this week on Medium. I wrote about the Graph Protocol, which is basically a decentralized Google, as well as why one of its potential competitors decided to instead help support the graph and become one of its core dev teams. On Facebook Bulletin, I explain the tokenomics of both bitcoin and ethereum. If you need a refresher on how to value BTC or ETH or know a friend that is just falling down the crypto rabbit hole. Go check out these primers on my bulletin page.
00:28:05.382 - 00:29:09.990, Speaker A: All four links will be in the show. Notes for this episode first story a Badger dow hack left one user -906 BTC badger dow a DFI protocol built to provide yield on bitcoin fell victim to an attack on Wednesday night. Badger dow tweeted badger has received reports of unauthorized withdrawals of user funds. As Badger engineers investigate this, all smart contracts have been paused to prevent further withdrawals. According to Pexhield, the total loss is over $120,000,000. Based on Pexield data, it appears roughly 85% of the $120,000,000 came from four large bitcoin addresses, which lost 906, 491, 203, and 184 BTC, respectively, equating to losses approximating $51 million as of press time Thursday afternoon. The cause of the exploit has yet to be confirmed.
00:29:09.990 - 00:30:00.650, Speaker A: However, Tritium or Tritium or some pronunciation like that, a badge core contributor speculated in the discord that it could be a front end issue with the Badger.com user interface. Tritium wrote There is no problem with the smart contracts. It looks like a bunch of users had approvals set for the exploit addresses, allowing them to operate on their vault funds, and that was exploited. Once we noticed, we froze all the vaults so nothing can move, and are trying to figure out where the approvals came from, how many people have them, and what next steps are. Such an attack, which targets the front end of Badger Dao rather than the decentralized protocol itself, raises many questions, which a Badger Dao Discord member named Saiguy laid out in the main Discord chat. This hack has really opened up a can of worms for questions for me.
00:30:00.650 - 00:31:23.942, Speaker A: One, how can we make sure what we approve in MetaMask is legit? Two, how can funds be moved even with a rogue approval from a ledger secured wallet? E g if I swap a coin on uniswap, I must manually hit the buttons on my ledger twice once for the approval and once for the actual swap. How is this hack possible? Three, how the heck does a front end attack happen? Does this mean he hacked the server and uploaded a modified contract so when users click claim, they get his? While Badger devs have yet to release any answers to the above questions, egrel capital's CryptoCap VC pointed out on Twitter that front end exploits can be avoided through proper MetaMask approval hygiene. Practicing proper wallet approval techniques can save users from giving DeFi unlimited allowances on certain tokens, a feature deployed by DApps where users only have to approve the wallet DAP connection once rather than for every token deposit. While convenient, this setup leaves users'funds at risk, as hackers have shown the ability to drain users'wallets giving unlimited allowance to DeFi protocols. To allow this, CryptoCap VC explained, don't trust the site's UI. Take the address manually from the MetaMask data and look at that contract on Etherscan, she added, Never approve more than you plan to use. You can always approve more in the future.
00:31:23.942 - 00:32:44.074, Speaker A: Yes, it costs a few more dollars, so it's psychological help once you will get rugged square Rebrands to Block Square, the Jack Dorsey led payments firm is rebranding its corporate identity to Block, according to a press release on Wednesday. Since launching in 2009, Square has expanded its scope to include a variety of crypto linked services, including Square Crypto, a Square offshoot focused on Bitcoin development Cash App, a mobile payment service turned Bitcoin Exchange Title, a music streaming service with NFT aspirations, and TBD 5456-6975, a yet to be built decentralized crypto exchange. In addition to building out services for crypto assets, Square also purchased roughly $170,000,000 of VTC back in February. The rebrand acknowledges that Square is no longer just a payments company specializing in commerce, solutions, software and banking services for seller businesses, says the company. We built a Square brand for our seller business, which is where it belongs, said Jack Dorsey, co founder and CEO of Block. Block is a new name, but our purpose of economic empowerment remains the same, much like how Facebook's rebrand to Meta did not alter the name of Facebook, the social media app. Disclosure I write a newsletter for Facebook meta.
00:32:44.074 - 00:33:43.726, Speaker A: Block explained that its name change only distinguishes the corporate identity from the other parts of the company, like Square Cash App, Title and TBD 5456-6975, and each of those entities will keep its name. Square Crypto, however, is rebranding to spiral, a term the company thinks reflects on the nature of Bitcoin as it continues to grow like a spiral from a single point, encompassing more and more space until it touches everything. The news comes just on the heels of Block CEO Jack Dorsey. Stepping down from the CEO position at Twitter, the social media app he co founded in June, Dorsey famously explained, If I were not at Square or Twitter, I'd be working on Bitcoin. If it needed more help than Square and Twitter, I will leave them for Bitcoin, Dorsey told the crowd at Bitcoin 2021. With his time at Twitter over and Square's rebrand a Block, it appears that Dorsey is making his summer statement reality. Metaverse land is going vast.
00:33:43.726 - 00:34:40.806, Speaker A: Metaverse real estate is getting hot. Data from DAP Radar shows that out of the top ten most expensive land purchases on the Sandbox, a virtual metaverse game, eight of them happened within the last two weeks, with each plot of land selling between $81,000 and $191,000 on decentraland.
