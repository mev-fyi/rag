00:01:40.950 - 00:02:00.930, Speaker C: Today's topic is crypto taxes, and hopefully this episode will help the audience through what is likely one of the more challenging parts of their interest in crypto. Here to discuss are Shihan Chandrasekhara, head of Tax Strategy at CoinTracker, and Lawrence Vlatkin, VP of Tax at Coinbase. Welcome, Sheehan and Lawrence.
00:02:01.270 - 00:02:03.026, Speaker D: Pleasure. Thank you for having us.
00:02:03.128 - 00:02:04.530, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks for having us.
00:02:04.680 - 00:02:40.682, Speaker C: Heads up, everyone. This show is all about crypto taxes. However, the interview is meant for informational purposes only. Nothing mentioned in this show should be construed as financial or tax advice. Please consult a tax professional about your own personal situation. I've been doing a tax episode every year about this time for quite a while, and I should say that, of course, as usual, we will be focusing on paying taxes in the US. Sorry for international listeners, but this is just the majority of the audience, so that makes sense, given that my audience likely knows at least some of the basics.
00:02:40.682 - 00:02:49.870, Speaker C: Maybe let's just start with some of the new things at an overview level. Sheehan, can you start us off with what's new this year when it comes to reporting crypto transactions?
00:02:50.030 - 00:02:50.722, Speaker D: Yeah, sure.
00:02:50.776 - 00:03:22.554, Speaker A: So 2022 was a tough year for the industry. Now we are in the tax season. There are some minor updates that you need to think about when filing your taxes. First of all, that infamous crypto question has been updated by the IRS. We first saw that appearing on the 2019 tax return. It went into 2020, 2021, and now we are seeing a much more expanded version of the 2022 tax form. So make sure you answer that question correctly.
00:03:22.682 - 00:03:24.494, Speaker C: And what is that question now?
00:03:24.612 - 00:04:19.674, Speaker A: The 2022 question is at any time during 2022, did you receive, sell, exchange, gift or otherwise dispose of a digital asset? So the major update for 2022 is that in the previous years the question was referring to virtual currencies. In 2020 they have changed the term to capture digital assets, which is a much more broader interpretation. So therefore, clearly things like NFDS or anything that's in the blockchain that's considered a cryptographically secured asset, if you interacted with them, you will most likely have to check yes for that question. So that's one of the major updates. Other than that, there were a couple of Chief Council memorandums that was issued in the last couple of weeks. We can kind of go into that in details in the coming minutes. But the major update is the question has been updated.
00:04:19.674 - 00:04:21.386, Speaker A: Make sure you answer that question correctly.
00:04:21.418 - 00:04:53.482, Speaker D: Going forward, just to add to what Han said. There's also, I think some I don't think there's necessarily more clarity, but there's more focus on Staking and what Staking represents and whether it's taxable. The service itself has added Staking to the question and also put it on its website for the first time. So I would say there's probably just a renewed interest. People in this audience might have heard of the Jared case, I think Shahan referred to it last year, a question about timing of inclusion. And so we can talk a little bit about that and how that was resolved. But I think Staking itself is front and center.
00:04:53.482 - 00:05:00.906, Speaker D: The ETH merge from last fall, September. I think all that has played a very important role and dynamic role in 2022.
00:05:01.088 - 00:05:34.262, Speaker C: Great, yeah, we'll dive into the details on a number of those issues later in the episode, but why don't we now just lay the groundwork for some people? Obviously lots of meaty things to cover for 2022, including bankruptcies and ecosystem collapses, but let's just make sure people understand the general basics around how crypto is taxed in the US. As far as I understand, there's one foundational concept that people need to grasp, which is capital gains tax. Lawrence, can you describe which types of crypto transactions are taxed under this fashion and how capital gains tax works?
00:05:34.396 - 00:06:31.526, Speaker D: So capital gains tax is really sort of a mechanism for taxing disposition of property and crypto is viewed as property. That's one of the few things the government told us is way back in 2014 in a notice. So when you buy, sell, or trade or exchange crypto, whether in any particular form, tokens, Bitcoin, ETH, NFTs, you're going to trigger what we call a capital transaction and that will generate capital gains or capital losses. Most people think of it in the form of securities. So when the buy, sell, holder trades, stocks or bonds, when you trade those, then that triggers also capital gains or losses. The capital gain system within the US stands apart from the regular system, what we should call ordinary income, which is wage income. So you can also do crypto transit, you might be paid in crypto, that's a very different concept, still triggers income, but it doesn't necessarily trigger capital gain income.
00:06:31.526 - 00:07:20.300, Speaker D: Capital gain income is taxed at a different rate, it's netted. So capital gains for stuff to be netted against capital losses, that's going to create an issue from what you raised earlier about the treatment of losses, which unfortunately has created more issues in 2022 than in prior years. We can talk a little bit about that because the answer for losses is a little bit, I think less beneficial, could be less palatable for most people, but it's a separate mechanism of tracking, calculating. You net all that out, when you end up with net capital gain, you pay tax at a maximum rate, typically in the US of 20%. If you're an individual, you might be subject to net investment addition, there's a surplus tax, supplemental tax that's applicable, but it's less than the ordinary income rates, which are usually for at least high income individuals in the 30s. So it's a separate parallel system.
00:07:20.750 - 00:07:29.750, Speaker C: So there's another way that crypto transactions can be taxed, which is as income. What types of transactions or events would you say are taxable as income?
00:07:29.910 - 00:08:05.122, Speaker D: So wages. So you might receive crypto in the form of wages. Actually the way the government treats that is you receive wages, then you purchase crypto. So it's not quite the same way. But if you receive compensation in the form of crypto, then that's also going to trigger you will be subject to income tax. Staking is also yield rewards. Other parts of the ecosystem that trigger what we call ordinary income, that is actually taxable as well, but it's not taxable at capital gains rates, it's taxable as ordinary income and that's taxable at a higher rate for most high net individuals and Sihan.
00:08:05.186 - 00:08:07.480, Speaker C: Would you have anything to add on that?
00:08:07.930 - 00:08:45.166, Speaker A: Again, just to summarize like here, especially if you're brand new to crypto, just remember these five situations, and if you fall into these five situations, you could have a taxable event and a liability. So number one, just cashing out crypto. Pretty self explanatory. If you have bitcoin, you sold it and made a profit, you gotta file taxes. Number two is crypto to crypto trades. Even though you're not necessarily realizing cash in hand, you still have to pay taxes if you're making a gain. The third situation is when you spend cryptocurrency or an NFT to buy a good service, that triggers a disposition event and you might have a taxable liability there.
00:08:45.166 - 00:09:29.182, Speaker A: Number four is when you earn crypto that also triggers a taxable event. That's what Lawrence just described. You can earn cryptocurrencies to wagers staking income, mining income, yield interest type products and et cetera. And the final bucket where you could be subject to taxes would be airdrops and hard forks airdrops happen frequently in the industry. I'm not sure if we had any significant hard fork events last year. Maybe we can talk about ethereum merge in the coming minutes. So, yeah, so if you have those five situations, you will likely have a tax liability and you will also have to file additional forms to report your information to the IRS and pay the taxes.
00:09:29.326 - 00:09:34.210, Speaker C: All right. And then let's quickly clarify which types of crypto activity are not taxable.
00:09:34.710 - 00:10:15.074, Speaker D: Hoddling the mere purchase of crypto and holding it in your wallet. The transfer of crypto from one wallet to another wallet is another good example of things that people might do that is non taxable. Anything that does not what I call monetize or create something different is going to be non taxable. Soft fork. So the ETH merge, I think, is also viewed by most people as a non taxable event because it was just essentially the change in the code, underlying code. It went from proof of work, of course, to proof of stake, but it was essentially the same token. So just the reformulation of that token itself is what we view as a non taxable event.
00:10:15.074 - 00:10:19.780, Speaker D: So those are probably the best examples, I think, of what people might be doing.
00:10:20.230 - 00:10:22.850, Speaker C: And what about receiving crypto as a gift?
00:10:23.430 - 00:10:48.470, Speaker D: So a gift is generally not, the gift is usually taxable on a donor. So there are limitations just in terms of how gift taxes again, it's another system of tax that's apart from the income tax system. If you exceed a gift tax exemption, then that might be subject to gift tax, but that's applicable to the donor. The donor does not pay tax. It's a gift. So it's not considered income in the traditional sense. And you actually receive it with what we call a carryover basis.
00:10:48.470 - 00:11:01.294, Speaker D: So you receive the same basis that the donor had in the asset beforehand. So any built in gain associated with that is going to be taxable to you, the donor, when you dispose of that asset as well.
00:11:01.492 - 00:11:11.410, Speaker C: And just in general, what behaviors would you advise crypto people to adopt when it comes to transacting, to make tax time easier?
00:11:11.830 - 00:11:48.442, Speaker D: To make tax time easier, I would say keep track of your assets, keep track of basis, evaluate what you've actually purchased and sold. You can try to trigger gains or losses to net so that you end up in a better position overall within your tax. If you've done this, if you do this before the end of the calendar year. So it's essentially sort of to recognize what assets you've had, gains and losses. If you have built in gains, maybe you have losses that you can trigger. The rules for crypto are a little bit more generous in terms of what we call washed sales. So you can actually trigger even if you want to hold onto the asset.
00:11:48.442 - 00:12:40.046, Speaker D: It's not true for the regular financial services world. TradFi but most people believe that wash sales don't apply to crypto. So you could actually trigger a loss to offset gains. So you net out essentially at zero, so you're not taxable on those even if you purchase that asset again afterwards, as long as there's a meaningful change overall in terms just the time they're both separate transactions. So it's really just calibrating your gains and losses so that you can effectively manage them as effectively as possible while keeping track of those assets. What was your basis? That's probably one of the hardest parts because unless you're transacting only on one exchange and coinbase, we'd love for you to do everything in the coinbase ecosystem, so we'll track that for you. But if you're doing other things within DeFi or transferring it to your wallet or doing things elsewhere, no one's going to keep track of that better than you do.
00:12:40.046 - 00:12:48.146, Speaker D: And you have to essentially still have to report gains or losses even if that is not reported on a particular exchange or given to you as a transactional report.
00:12:48.328 - 00:13:12.810, Speaker C: All right, and obviously this is a new and emerging area and the tax system is sort of or the tax code is sort of applying kind of existing situations on a crypto. So are the processes around reporting crypto codified to the part where it's obvious which forms you're using to report different activities? And if so, what are those forms?
00:13:13.310 - 00:14:12.010, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess at the individual level, the forms that you need to file are very clear. Let me kind of walk you through some of the forms we spoke about that crypto question on the front and center of the 1040. So the 1040 is like the form that you file to report not only your crypto but all of your taxable income and expenses. So 1040 is one form 89 49 and Schedule D are most commonly used forms, especially if you have capital gains and losses coming from crypto disposal and crypto. And also NFTs, schedule one is another frequently used form. There's a line, Z where you can report other income coming from staking income, mining income that you do as a hobby, or any type of other miscellaneous types of income that you earn in the crypto space. And there could be other forms like Schedule C, for example, if you have like, a mining operation that you're running as a trade of business so you can report that income and also claim some of the expenses.
00:14:12.010 - 00:14:29.620, Speaker A: Those are the main forms. Just to summarize, the 1040, form 89 49 and Schedule D to report your capital gains and losses, schedule One to report your other income items. And Schedule C, if you have like a trade of business where you do a mining or even could be a staking operation as well.
00:14:30.310 - 00:14:42.790, Speaker C: All right, and then last question before we dive into some of the crazy events from last year and how those apply to crypto taxes, what are typical mistakes you see that crypto people make when it comes to their taxes.
00:14:43.290 - 00:15:41.414, Speaker A: I think Lawrence mentioned this briefly. If you're dealing with a stockbroker or like an employer, people are used to getting some type of tax form that summarizes your income gains and losses and they're kind of used to kind of looking at that form and reporting that on the form 1040 and you're done with your tax work. Unfortunately, in the crypto world, it doesn't happen. So the burden of kind of reconciling your transactions across multiple wallets and exchanges fall on you. One of the big pitfalls that we see in the space is that you're in the tax season and you don't know how much gains or losses you made during the year. So not tracking that cost basis could be time consuming, especially if you had to do it right now in a quick period of time. So just know that there are certain crypto tax software that you can use to kind of mitigate that and you can kind of automatically calculate the gains and losses.
00:15:41.414 - 00:16:22.402, Speaker A: So not tracking your basis and computing your gains and losses is one of the biggest pitfalls that we see. I would say the other misconception that some folks in this space have is that they think that crypto is anonymous, therefore it's completely invisible to regulators. Unfortunately, that's not the case. There are a lot of ways that the IRS knows that you have something to do with crypto. It could happen through these 1099 reportings that exchanges do. Like for example, if you receive some type of 1099 form, that means your activity has already been reported to the IRS by that broker. So if you do not report that amount on your tax return, there will be a notice.
00:16:22.402 - 00:17:04.638, Speaker A: IRS also uses these subpoenas to exchanges and if your name and information get leaked as a result of these subpoenas, then they can audit you and see if you really reported those amounts. Another way regulators know about your crypto is by using some of these software like chain analysis cybertrades, they can essentially go through the blockchain activity and assign real world identities to anonymous transactions and wallets. So just don't think that crypto is anonymous. I mean it's publicly available on the blockchain and it's visible to the regulators. So make sure that you report your activity to the IRS and other regulators.
00:17:04.734 - 00:17:51.170, Speaker D: In fact, I would reinforce that. So the IRS, if it's focused resources on anything in crypto in the last few years it's been on enforcement. So it is quite concerned that there's underreporting related to crypto. So resulting in the question that we discussed earlier. A lot of focus on John Doe summons which Shahan referred to, and the mistake that I think most people make, something that surprising to me, but if you don't receive a form and that form is put in your shoebox and then given to your accountant, let's say in March or April. If you don't receive a 1099, you think, Well, I didn't earn anything, nothing happened, so therefore I don't have to report it. But the form is nothing more than just a mechanism for providing information to you and to the government.
00:17:51.170 - 00:18:36.466, Speaker D: So there's a matching system associated with that, but it's really just informational so that you can then file your tax return. And the fact that we don't really have a 1099 mechanism yet for crypto, we're expecting it most likely sometime this year to be introduced in the next year or so. You most likely including, if you're a customer of Coinbase, you're not going to receive a 1099 B, which is the most typical form, but it doesn't mean that you're not subject to tax. So you should remember, as Shahan just, I think, made very clear, if you have income, then you should still report that income. And don't assume the IRS won't know about you because they have tried other mechanisms and have focused enormously on trying to find out where people are and whether they're reporting income or not.
00:18:36.648 - 00:19:03.190, Speaker C: All right, so now we're going to get into the meaty bit of the show. One of the sad things is, I noticed from the script last year that the first major new trend whose tax implications we discussed was NFTs, but this year it's going to be bankruptcies. So for people who have become creditors in one of the many bankruptcies or liquidation proceedings, what do they need to know when it comes to their taxes?
00:19:03.350 - 00:19:51.418, Speaker D: Oh, boy, this one's going to be a hard one because I think this is where the rules are very strict and they're going to be somewhat painful. So losses in the tax, the tax system is essentially predicated on recognition events and a bankruptcy in and of itself is not a recognition event. So you might have lost a substantial amount of money in Voyager, Celsius, Genesis, FTX, and yet you may still not be able to recognize a loss associated with that. So you're kind of stuck with where you are itself. Now, if you have built in losses for crypto assets as well, that itself is also not a taxable event. So Bitcoin dropped from 60,000 to let's say 18,000 at one point, now 20. So you have a built in loss associated with that.
00:19:51.418 - 00:20:33.314, Speaker D: Until you sell it or dispose it of it, it doesn't create a taxable transaction. So let's separate those two transactions in and of themselves. So if you do something, if you recognize a loss because you sell or trade it, let's say on Coinbase or an exchange that is a taxable transaction, that will trigger a loss. That loss, if you're an individual, is limited unless you have capital gains to $3,000 can be carried forward. But it's essentially a very small number that you can then use. Which is why, as we discussed earlier, one of the benefits of managing your portfolio is you might be able to balance those losses against gains, because we manage losses against gains. But both of those depend on recognition events.
00:20:33.314 - 00:21:25.202, Speaker D: The IRS itself released a Chief Counsel Advisory Memorandum just actually about a month or so ago on the very point of what built in losses represent, whether crypto is a security, whether you can take we call it worthless securities, worthless stock deduction. You cannot I mean, I think they've made that very clear. You can take a general capital loss if you trigger a loss, but you can't treat as a worthless stock deduction, which is another available avenue that may have been applicable to crypto. Now, when it comes to bankruptcy, that's not, as I said before, a recognition of that. So it really creates, I think it will create a lot of anxiety for people about what to do, whether they can do anything. Now there is a theft loss deduction that you can take. This was used in the Madoff scandal.
00:21:25.202 - 00:22:06.994, Speaker D: So in the Madoff scandal, the IRS actually provided pretty beneficial and favorable guidance on how to take theft losses associated with the Ponzi scheme of Bernie Madoff. And to the extent that you think that there has been theft, for example, with FTX or another platform, you think that you've been misled, your money was absconded with, it was taken away, your assets, you gave it and thought they were custody, and then they weren't. They were used for other purposes. You might be able to benefit from a theft loss. Now, this is a little complicated because there are very strict rules of how to claim this. It has to be engaged for profit. So you have to purchase your crypto for profit.
00:22:06.994 - 00:22:46.350, Speaker D: The theft itself has to be a genuine theft. Bankruptcy is not theft, so I think let's make that clear. But if the bankruptcy is the result of theft, then you might be able to argue that there was theft. And as I said, I would really love the IRS to provide guidance on just as they did with Bernie Madoff because of the number of people involved. If the IRS felt if we have a broad enough number of people who are implicated by this, I think something along those lines would be quite helpful overall in providing some support for what I just described. But you can read the guide. The Bernie Madoff Ponzi guidance is still out there, so it's still applicable.
00:22:46.350 - 00:23:07.190, Speaker D: It's not like that's disappeared. So you can still rely on the overall contours and that involved, when to recognize it, how to document it, how to report it. But a theft loss might be available. Other than that, you just simply have the recognition event, as I described earlier, which is that you have to sell the asset, have to do something with it, and therefore trigger an actual loss.
00:23:07.550 - 00:23:38.980, Speaker C: And just so I understand this part that you're saying about theft, that would mostly apply, I guess, to customers of ftx.com, which technically was restricted from I'm not sure exactly how to define it's like Americans, but I'm sure there's probably Americans with corporations elsewhere or something that participated on ftx.com. So maybe some group like that. Because do you think the theft provision would apply to customers of FTX US?
00:23:40.230 - 00:24:05.050, Speaker D: Again, it's very fact. You know FTX us also isn't bankruptcy. We're not entirely certain about how assets were commingled with itself. You know, we've heard what SBF has said about whether those assets can be the liabilities can be satisfied, but I think it's relatively unclear. We might still have U. S. Participants on the foreign exchange based in the Bahamas, so that might be applicable as well.
00:24:05.050 - 00:24:38.034, Speaker D: There are other examples of misleading statements that have been made elsewhere within the crypto economy. Either with I don't want to name names, but know there's other examples where people would argue probably that there is misleading, they've been misled, their assets haven't been used in the way they thought they were being used. They can't withdraw them. They thought they were just making deposits. They were statements made about whether it was FDIC insured and it wasn't FDIC insured. And so when those entities went into bankruptcy, the claim is that there was fraud being committed. Once you have fraud, I think again, fraud is not theft.
00:24:38.034 - 00:25:04.654, Speaker D: Bankruptcy is not theft. I'm simply positing a possibility for someone. Otherwise, I just think we have a very unsatisfactory answer for most people, which is you can do nothing. You can sit and wait. Which is, I don't think, a very helpful answer. But if you want to explore the contours of theft, I just think there is sort of this avenue that was provided, I think, very favorably by the IRS in 2008, 2009.
00:25:04.852 - 00:25:38.910, Speaker C: Okay, so just to spell it out for people, it sounds like you're saying potentially people might work with a tax professional to find a way to argue that the madeoff guidance applies to things that occurred with Celsius or Voyager or Genesis. There are so many bankruptcies, I'm wondering if I'm missing one. But three AC, it sounds like that's what you're saying. It depends on your situation. You'd want to talk to a tax professional who knows the made off guidance. Okay. And she Honda.
00:25:38.910 - 00:25:40.778, Speaker C: What do you want to add on that?
00:25:40.864 - 00:26:26.358, Speaker A: Just to add, like if you're curious, when we say burning bed of guidance, we refer to Revenue procedure 2000 and 920. So you can actually Google it and it's an easy to read PDF. It clearly lays out what you need to meet to claim a deduction as a ponzi loss. Take a look at that PDF, talk to your tax advisor and see if you're eligible to take a deduction under that promotion. And also ask your tax advisor if it even makes sense for you to kind of explore that avenue. Sometimes those deductions could be limited by other court section of your tax profile. So it's not even worth considering some of this deduction because it could get disallowed by other things.
00:26:26.358 - 00:27:05.570, Speaker A: And then the second thing to consider is that is it even worth kind of claiming some of this deduction and opening your tax return to other audit, risk and et cetera. So that's where you kind of need to know your specific fact patterns and your overall tax profile and also work with a good tax advisor so you can kind of leverage that promption adjustment before kind of jumping into saying that, oh, I want to take a deduction or write off. I mean, write offs. They also commit certain risks. So make sure you work with a qualified advisor before looking into these deductions because these are somewhat sophisticated deductions at write ops.
00:27:05.990 - 00:27:19.240, Speaker C: Okay? And I might have misspoke earlier because I just realized that Genesis bankruptcy wasn't filed until 2023. So for those taxpayers, is it that bankruptcy doesn't affect their 2022 taxes at all?
00:27:20.330 - 00:28:08.134, Speaker D: Again, a bankruptcy itself is not a definite, is not a taxable event, so you'd have to have a loss. So you'd have to have something that was triggered through a transaction. The transaction could be you disposed of, I sold my crypto or my interest in whatever I invested in Genesis to, let's say, Shahan or whatever. So I think that, again, that's sort of the defining feature for when you can actually claim a loss. So you have to have a taxable event at that point. You can then recognize whether you get a capital loss or not and are able to use it and netted against capital gains. If you're going to try to make the argument, as I said earlier, that there's been theft involved, that actually can arise even if you don't have a tax book, because that depends not on what you do, but rather what the recipient did.
00:28:08.134 - 00:28:30.990, Speaker D: They stole your assets. They did something other than what they said they were going to do with them and what they represented that they would. So that could happen even prior to bankruptcy. Again, this is proof, so it's fairly complicated. You'd have to have documentation. If you had proof or some evidence that was satisfactory to the government, then you might be able to make the argument that it's theft.
00:28:31.810 - 00:28:40.482, Speaker C: All right, so in a moment we're going to talk about other kinds of losses in crypto. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible become.

00:31:31.310 - 00:31:58.370, Speaker C: Back to my conversation with Shehan and Lawrence. Another one of the huge events in crypto this past year was the collapse of Terra Luna. How are people who were invested in a coin that went to zero or close to it going to be taxed? Can they deduct that loss? Does it depend on whether they sold? Or what do you do in that case where the value of what you own just simply plummeted to almost nothing?
00:31:58.520 - 00:32:36.878, Speaker D: So again, this is going to be unsatisfactory because it's not really dissimilar from what we just described with bankruptcy. So the mere reduction in value of a crypto asset is not a taxable event. And the government, as I said, has made that clear in a recent Chief Council Advisory Memorandum. And they actually use an example very similar to what you just described terra Luna. They described an asset, a crypto asset that diminished a value to something nominal even though it might still be traded. It was essentially nominal in scope and what certainly didn't represent what purported to be. And they concluded then, A, it wasn't a security.
00:32:36.878 - 00:33:25.470, Speaker D: Crypto is not a security under the Inter Revenue Code, under the definitions of the code. So you can't claim a worthless securities or stock deduction, which is what's available. So you have to sort of depend on the original loss characterization that, as I said, requires a transaction. So if it's still publicly traded and you dispose of it, you will trigger a capital loss. If I sell that, even if I transfer it to Shahan and he pays me whatever nominal value there is for that, that would trigger a loss as well. Again, based on those loss limitations that we described earlier, which are for most people pretty unsatisfactory as well, they're limited losses, naked losses, capital losses in that parallel capital gains and loss system are deductible only to the extent of $3,000 they're carried forward. So you can use them in future years, but that's not a very substantial amount.
00:33:25.470 - 00:33:57.190, Speaker D: Maybe it depends on your facts and circumstances, obviously, but that's effectively limited. However, as I said, if you have other capital gains that you triggered, that's why it's very useful to go through your portfolio and see what you can trigger at the end of November, December, and figure where you want to be and whether there are things you can do affirmatively to balance out those two them. And if you triggered a capital loss, you weren't able to use it for 2022 tax year, you can still do that for 2023 and then use it for 2023. Yeah.
00:33:57.260 - 00:34:43.030, Speaker A: Again, just to add more color on what Lawrence mentioned. So if you read the IRS tax code, if you want to have a capital loss, there must be a salo exchange of one asset with another asset. So again, you could have coins or even NFTs in your wallet that have effectively gone to zero. And you might be thinking, okay, how can I write this out? Because I don't want to do any activity. And in most cases, some of these coins don't even have any liquid markets that you can find easily. So you might be thinking, okay, I want to take this as a write off to reduce my taxable income. Now, the memorandum that was issued by the IRS clarified that you can only take a capital loss if you have a salo exchange.
00:34:43.030 - 00:35:42.010, Speaker A: So my advice to you is that if you have coins or NFCs that have gone to near zero values, find a market or somebody unrelated party to dispose of that asset and get something back. It could even be like one dollars. But that establishes that capital loss that's allowed by the IRS versus kind of going into taking the deduction as a worthless security deduction or kind of abandoning it. Again, these are somewhat sophisticated deductions. Whenever you go into taking deductions or losses kind of other than capital losses, which are very frequent, then your return and your tax profile kind of get surfaced among other tax return that the IRS receives, because these are very niche type of deductions. So again, if you have this situation, I highly recommend you talking to a tax advisor because they can look at your risk profile and your entire tax profile and guide you the right way to take the deduction.
00:35:42.350 - 00:36:12.978, Speaker D: Another comment I would make is that you really only have the capital loss mechanism and the disposition or taxable exchange that Shahan described. There is a loss provision in the code, but essentially it was eviscerated in the text in 2017. And so there is no availability for general losses within our existing system right now. It's deferred until although it was limited by you could put it on miscellaneous expense that's no longer available, at least through 2026.
00:36:13.144 - 00:36:39.130, Speaker C: All right. And because this is crypto, I also have to ask, how would someone who was the victim of a scam or rug pull apply that to their, say, you know, I'm sure you guys probably follow Zach XBT. There's a number of these rug pulls, especially with NFTs. So if people put their money into something for the promise of something that wasn't delivered, then what can they do with that on their taxes?
00:36:39.870 - 00:37:29.370, Speaker D: Well, I think, again, that raises the question of whether that's theft. So the only thing you really can do is, if you feel that you've been subject to theft, you might be able to take a theft loss deduction along with the parameters that we just described in the more probably elaborate mechanisms. There may be somewhat more sophisticated mechanisms, but scams are scams, so essentially they result in the same they arise from the same criminal activity, which is effectively someone has stolen your money. What do you do? You argue that you had a theft loss. If you had the asset for profit, you might be able to argue along the lines of the Ponzi scheme guidance that you had a theft and therefore can take a theft. Loss deduction, which is not only available and not treated as capital, which is beneficial, it's just more readily once you're able to claim it actually is a more useful deduction even than a capital loss deduction.
00:37:30.350 - 00:37:41.998, Speaker C: Okay, but it sounds like obviously it would just depend on the facts of what happened. It sounds like that's not just something anybody can claim. They would have to argue for it. Is that correct?
00:37:42.164 - 00:38:16.170, Speaker D: Yeah. So I think the sad part of all this is that the rules are actually pretty clear. So losses are very limited in our system of taxation in terms of their usability to offset income. And so either you have a capital loss, which depends on actually having a closed transaction, such as a sale or exchange or disposition, or you can potentially, in these more extreme cases, argue that there was theft. So there's a theft loss deduction. That is, if you can make the case for it can be very beneficial. Beyond that, you're pretty much out of luck.
00:38:16.170 - 00:38:46.760, Speaker D: It's like bankruptcy, losing money. The tax system is based on income. It's not necessarily based on loss, at least for individuals. Like, if we're talking about businesses and we're talking about netting income for profits. It's a very different set of facts and different animal. But if we're talking about individuals who are just investing for profit, the system is, unless you have capital gains to offset that, you're not going to be able to use your capital losses. Unless you have a theft loss, you're not really going to have that available to you, unfortunately, just the way the system is built.
00:38:47.370 - 00:39:11.740, Speaker C: And in a similar vein, how should people handle it? If they had crypto in, say, a DeFi protocol, or in a cross chain bridge that either got hacked or as happened with Mango Markets, the markets were manipulated and then drained. How would that fall? How would the tax code apply in that situation?
00:39:13.230 - 00:39:40.900, Speaker D: So that's an interesting one, because I think with DeFi protocols, what people don't realize and this is just a trap for the unwary, perhaps when you enter into a DeFi protocol and you've pooled or you've done something on the DeFi itself, you might have actually triggered a taxable transaction. Mostly, I think, in the prior world, at least prior to losses, other than the facts you just described, people probably didn't realize that they might have actually triggered gains at that point. Because I think once you commingle, you put it on.
