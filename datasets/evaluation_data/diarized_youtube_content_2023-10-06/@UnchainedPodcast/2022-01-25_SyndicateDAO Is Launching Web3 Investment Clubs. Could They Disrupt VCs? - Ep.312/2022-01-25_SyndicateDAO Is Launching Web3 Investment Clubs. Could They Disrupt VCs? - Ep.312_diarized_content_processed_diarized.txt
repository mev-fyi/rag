Willie said Deeply researched, this book is an important body of work and must read for the inside story of Ethereum, complete with all of its grit and drama. If you have not yet pre ordered your copy of The Cryptopians, then head to th that's Bit ly Cryptopians to preorder your copy today. Again, the link to preorder is bitly cryptopians. Additionally, I'll be doing a Facebook Live AMA tomorrow. Wednesday, January 26, the 8th anniversary of Vitalik, Buterin presenting Ethereum for the first time at the North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami. The AMA will be about my book, which is about Ethereum and the 2017 ICO Craze, but you can also ask questions about recent crypto news.

00:03:13.630 - 00:03:14.860, Speaker B: Good to be here.
00:03:15.230 - 00:03:17.450, Speaker C: Yeah, great to be here, Laura.
00:03:17.950 - 00:03:24.540, Speaker A: You two have an announcement that is dropping the day this podcast comes out. Tell us what your news is.
00:03:25.310 - 00:03:25.746, Speaker B: Yep.
00:03:25.798 - 00:05:28.918, Speaker C: So today we announced that we launched our first mainstream product on top of Syndicate protocol in public beta. And that product is what we call Web Three investment clubs. And what it does is it allows any group of people, typically their friends, groups of angel investors or Web Three communities, to come to our protocol and easily launch an investing dow as a Web Three investment club on syndicate in a single ethereum transaction for just the cost of gas. It effectively transforms any ethereum wallet, whether it's a multi SIG or a MetaMask or a ledger, into a powerful investing dow and imbues that wallet with all of these really powerful capabilities to invest together as an investment club completely on chain with no back end. And what that means is it allows these clubs and groups of people, basically, to turn a lot of these group chats that people are in already today where they're groups of friends and they're like, buying NFTs or maybe they're investing in different projects in the web3 space or even investing in startups off chain into equities and things like that and turn that thing into an on chain club as easily as a group chat. And so we'll get into a lot of the details around the protocol and the application and program that we've been developing with a bunch of partners over the last number of months. But what we're really excited about is how this tool really begins to democratize investing to people that and groups of people who may not have been able to access these tools or afford these tools traditionally because these tools have been very difficult, very expensive and very slow to kind of be able to use.
00:05:28.918 - 00:06:01.520, Speaker C: And we make that ten to 100 x easier and also embed into the tool and snap into the tool various partners and various even tools that we built on the legal side that enable these investment clubs to maintain their investment club status legally and compliantly, so that they have the peace of mind to ensure that they're using these investing dows in the right way for themselves. Their DAOs. And their members.
00:06:02.790 - 00:06:32.010, Speaker A: I love this. I find this such a fascinating new product. So for listeners who are listening on the podcast that was Ian talking just to help differentiate the voices and I did want to, you know, just stepping like investment club isn't a common term, at least it's not one that I've really used much. So regardless of kind of like the web3 component and your product, just what is an investment club generally?
00:06:32.590 - 00:07:37.806, Speaker C: So it's really interesting because investment clubs as a concept have been around for thousands of years. The earliest example of an investment club in recorded history was in 1898 in Texas during the wild west, probably in some saloon or something like that. But the reality is these investment clubs have existed ever since then in the real world, actually before web3, even before web two. In the real world, typically what these things look like are groups of people in oftentimes local towns. They get together at a community center or a restaurant, they meet up, they're oftentimes friends and community members. They'll talk about traditionally, oftentimes like different stocks that they're looking to invest in together. They'll make kind of purchases together, club and pool their capital together to reduce transaction costs, spread out risks, learn together, win together basically.
00:07:37.806 - 00:09:02.454, Speaker C: And what's fascinating is that has existed in the meat space in a non digital way and a non internet native way for hundreds of years, but it hasn't been modernized for the Internet. And it certainly hasn't been modernized. For Web Three, especially as obviously web3 has created all these new assets that are native to the internet and live on the Internet. And so what we've done here with our first product on top of our protocol is modernize investment clubs for web Three, where they natively, can live well, be created, be run and natively live on the internet where these assets are being created and live as well. Now what's interesting in addition to this though obviously, is we've built these kind of like web Three native tools, which is specifically like a dow technology to invest natively together as a group of friends on the internet in web Three today on Ethereum and other chains in the future. But in addition to that, we've taken the time to snap in. For example, like we teamed up with Latham Walk Ins to generate open source legal agreements for web3 investment clubs on syndicate where people can generate these legal documents automatically using our tool, sign them with their web wallet to provide them with those additional kind of guarantees in the real world legally.
00:09:02.454 - 00:09:38.390, Speaker C: And then the second thing is we've also partnered with this fintech from the web, two world called Doula, where they're teaming up with us so that any investing dow on syndicate or any investment club on syndicate can get legal entities in Delaware and Wyoming. They can make state filings, they can get Eins, they can get fiat bank accounts, and they can also file taxes and issue k ones. And so they can do everything basically in the real world that a traditional investment club would be able to do. But they're now natively run in web Three using our infrastructure.
00:09:39.610 - 00:09:53.100, Speaker A: Wow, it's so fascinating. So let's walk through a hypothetical process of people forming one of the web3 investment clubs. Will, do you want to take this one?
00:09:53.630 - 00:10:50.490, Speaker B: Yeah, happy to. So typically these investment clubs will start with either a thesis or a community. So existing Dow communities will want to spin up clubs so that they can invest together or someone might have a certain thesis like on chain NFTs are the future and we'll spin up a club related to that. And then from that point they can go to syndicate and set up their investment club in literally 45 seconds. And with that one on change transaction, they have their club ready to go and they can send a link to anyone in their community who they want to be able to deposit. They just send it via private messages and group chats and they are up and running. So we took a Web Two process where these investment clubs in the web Two World were very time consuming to set up and run.
00:10:50.490 - 00:11:01.870, Speaker B: And we made it in the Web Three World take under a minute to set up and run, which is just a huge leap forward in the accessibility of these investment clubs.
00:11:02.770 - 00:11:26.230, Speaker A: And when you were talking about setting this up, so how is it all structured? Is it like there's? I'm assuming so this web address, is it a multi SIG? And then when you were talking about the chat and everything, is that built in? Do you have like a chat platform so all the investment club communications are on one platform or how is all that structured?
00:11:26.730 - 00:12:31.550, Speaker B: So we allow you to turn any wallet into an investment club and depending on the size of the investment club and the security requirements of the Dao, they'll use different options. If they're looking to join really fast moving NFT Mints, they probably want to use a hardware wallet. For example, if they're looking to make private investment into a Token, they'll probably want to use a multi SEG if they're dealing with larger amounts so clubs can choose the wallet that's the right fit for them and we can convert that wallet into an investing club. Right now the tools that they use are the tools they're already using to organize their communities. So we're compatible with any tooling that they may be using, whether that's Token gated discords for chat or a snapshot for governance. In the long term, we are definitely thinking about how to build stronger communities and we do have a community product for membership NFTs that allows people to form a community and easily administer it. But a lot of that is coming after the core investment club launch.
00:12:32.530 - 00:12:52.980, Speaker A: And so who can participate? Obviously in the US we have accredited investor rules, but from your documentation it looks like non accredited investors can participate but know probably, I guess they're limited in what they can invest in. Can you just talk a little bit about that?
00:12:54.070 - 00:14:31.570, Speaker C: Yeah, so we've been doing a lot of work on this over the last number of months because what we think is really important is that tools like what syndicate is building and others for DAOs to really move forward as a technology. In particular, in the case of the application that we're launching with investment clubs, they need to guide users and provide users with the right tools to protect themselves, their members and their Dows. Right? And so we've invested a ton of time internally as well as working with a bunch of external partners, as we mentioned, to get this really right. And so with investment clubs it's really interesting because there's a web page on the SEC's website where you can read up about how they look at investment clubs. Investment clubs generally are not regulated by the SEC, provided that they meet certain guidelines. For example, fewer than 100 members, no public solicitation, there's no investment advisor, no performance fees or carried interest. And also everyone must participate as members of the investment club in decisions, right? And so those sorts of things have been actually designed into the tool that we've built and also the kind of adjacent tools like the legal document tools and other things that we've snapped into it, to allow people to run their investment clubs and help them run their investment clubs as compliantly as possible.
00:14:31.570 - 00:16:04.590, Speaker C: Now, with respect to what these investment clubs can invest in, that's a really interesting thing because that is actually determined by whether or not accredited or unaccredited people can invest in that asset that they're purchasing or investing in. So for example, an investment club is investing in a startup and like it's equity, like in an early stage kind of venture round or something, right? Startups often for those capital raises will require that the investors are accredited. And if that thing that is invested into it is a vehicle, like let's say an investment club, then that startup will often require that that investment club is an accredited vehicle. Which means that that investment club and all of its members need to be accredited investors. And so for certain types of things like that, there are those accreditation requirements and that is something that the creators and members of investment clubs need to decide and follow for themselves when using these tools and also creating investment clubs of their own, whether in the traditional world or on Web Three using syndicate. That said, however, there are a number of assets where people can buy that without being accredited. A good example of this would be like Bitcoin and Ethereum, right? I mean, people can go to Coinbase and buy that very easily.
00:16:04.590 - 00:17:32.638, Speaker C: And so investment clubs that are formed to invest in assets where you don't have to be accredited, maybe they're buying an NFT that they really love, like from an artist or something. Or they're a community of people that are trying to support certain creators or certain projects in Web Three where they allow people to invest in those assets or even like an investment club. We see some of these on the platform today where they're actually not investing for profit, but they're actually almost using it like a grant vehicle of some kind to support the development of a certain community. Those types of investment clubs can have unaccredited people as part of those. And so obviously it's like we provide in our tool a number of protections and also related tools and services or partner services from teams that we partner with to help them with that. But provided that they've done their diligence and figured out what they're able to do and what they're not able to do, yeah, this tool is available to people who are not necessarily accredited if the club can invest in those assets. And that's incredibly democratizing and empowering for communities that need it the most, we believe so we're really excited about that.
00:17:32.804 - 00:17:59.400, Speaker A: And I did happen to notice in a wiki that you wrote up about your investment clubs that you referred to these clubs where they'll need to have all accredited members if they want to invest, for instance, in startup equity. And then you wrote, we are working hard to change this so that more people can have the same access and opportunity. So please stay tuned for updates. Can you give a hint as to what that's about?
00:18:00.650 - 00:19:07.802, Speaker C: Sure. Yeah. So we are on this long term mission to try to democratize the tools to invest to as many people as carefully, thoughtfully and legally and compliantly as possible, because this gets to the mission. A bit of syndicate. But when you look at Web Three and the power of Web Three, right, the technologies in these networks are really incredible in terms of the ability to decentralize and democratize, access these powerful kind of systems to more people around the world. And that's fundamentally a good thing, right. But the capabilities to invest and the capital that invests in Web Three today is still kind of skeomorphic with the traditional world, right? The tools and the infrastructure to invest in Web Three natively in a network native way, in a community driven way, has not yet, in our opinion, gotten to the point where it's truly network native with Web Three.
00:19:07.802 - 00:19:34.062, Speaker C: And that's what we're trying to do because we want more people to participate in the development of Web Three, the investing in Web Three, the wealth building that results from investing in Web Three. And frankly, if Web Three is the new Internet and it's rebuilding our world, we need more people to participate in the building of this world. Because what gets invested in shapes how that world gets built. By whom? For whom?
00:19:34.126 - 00:19:34.770, Speaker B: Et.
00:19:36.810 - 00:19:41.480, Speaker A: Are you doing lobbying with the SEC? You know what I'm saying?
00:19:42.570 - 00:20:42.794, Speaker C: No. So we are working with existing regulation, right? I mean, good example is the investment club product, right? We are following by the book, like what's within sort of the regulation to be able to introduce a tool that is Web Three native, but also helps users of that tool maintain compliance. And maybe to get specifically to your question, right, the law is very complicated when it comes to investing. There's lots of different structures beyond investment clubs, obviously, which are not even technically regulated by the SEC. There's things like three C one funds, there's 506 B funds, there's 506 C funds, et cetera. And even other thing variations within that. And what we are working through very diligently is identifying existing legal frameworks where they similarly to investment clubs, can be modernized for Web Three.
00:20:42.794 - 00:21:15.602, Speaker C: And what we're finding is that we believe it is possible to create these tools that enable these investing dows on syndicate to follow existing regulations and compliance, but introduce Web Three native capabilities to them that thoughtfully enable more people to be a part of these systems. And how exactly that works is really nuanced. But that's what we're trying to figure out bit by bit.
00:21:15.736 - 00:21:57.380, Speaker A: Right. It reminds me of how, for instance, Stacks did an ICO, but it was within the regulation a crowdfunding rule. So it's like kind of fitting it into existing laws. So you kind of touched briefly on some of these other things, but I just want to dive into them a little further. You talked about how these investing dows or investment clubs can obtain legal entities and I just wondered if you could talk a little bit about why it is that some of them might want to do that. And then also you talked about how it'll enable them to handle their taxes, which is pretty interesting. So if you could talk about those two things.
00:21:58.870 - 00:23:00.950, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean what we're finding is, again, this user behavior around people pooling capital together with friends, often people that have known each other for a while and live in these group chats or discord channels that's been happening, especially with the rise of these NFTs and things like crowd buying in. Web Three has become kind of a more common user behavior and pattern. What we're also finding though is two things. What they're doing right now is they're kind of just throwing into a multi SIG or a wallet that someone's running. There's no kind of tooling on top of that that makes that easier, more powerful. Like for example, with investing dows on syndicate, they have this really robust dashboard that shows and visualizes assets in real time, like NFTs, Tokens and even startups that they invest in. So it becomes this portfolio management system on top of a wallet.
00:23:00.950 - 00:23:26.526, Speaker C: So they're oftentimes just doing this kind of manually and they're also tracking all of this stuff on a spreadsheet like a Google sheet. Right. And it's very manual. It's very kind of like labor intensive. Lots of times there's like errors or just inconsistencies because data isn't updated. Right. And so basically, syndicate in a certain way offloads all of that onto the smart contract in our application.
00:23:26.526 - 00:24:29.220, Speaker C: And on top of that, which is not what a lot of dows these group chats are thinking about, but the ones that get more serious and they want to follow things by the book and not worry about certain things like do I need to pay taxes and how do I do that easily and compliantly. That's where this fintech partnership with Doula comes in, where they can help dows on syndicate do all of that really easily and affordably annually. So they just kind of get those services. They just provide the information, file the taxes, get the K ones, which all members need of an investment club to be able to file that with their taxes every year. And it gives them that peace of mind which we're finding a lot of these investment clubs actually do want and we think might be one of the key limiters for adoption of investing dows or investment clubs in Web three, because people are just kind of worried and don't want to deal with all this stuff that they don't know.
00:24:29.990 - 00:24:47.480, Speaker A: Yeah. I feel like at the end of every year, or at the beginning of every year, there are jokes in crypto about all the crazy things people did with their money the previous year and how their accountants are going to have a headache. So the investment club members will get a token. What is that going to be used for?
00:24:48.110 - 00:24:48.570, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:24:48.640 - 00:25:10.638, Speaker B: So the Token itself, broadly speaking, represents the cap table of the investment club. So it represents the ownership shares similar to Balogy's mirror table mirror shares that he described in a recent post that on chain cap table we've had has existed since the beginning of syndicate and we've been working on the product for the past year.
00:25:10.724 - 00:25:15.060, Speaker A: Yeah, and just define the mirror tables and mirror shares for people who didn't read his post.
00:25:15.430 - 00:26:12.242, Speaker B: Yes, happy to. So cap tables are traditionally managed via centralized services and you're dependent entirely on that centralized service to define who owns what. And that's a single source of failure. So if there's any inconsistency in the data, any difference in what was promised versus what was given, you're dependent entirely on that centralized service to make it right or not. And there's many cases where things go wrong. For example, for startup employees, there's so many cases of people being promised, for example, one equity price and ending up paying a much higher price just due to some nuances of how the stock grants worked and being out, like many, many thousands of dollars of differences. And that's because it's a centralized service that's not available to all members and not transparent to all members.
00:26:12.242 - 00:27:04.350, Speaker B: But by moving the cap table, essentially the ownership stakes on chain, that is now, not only can all members verify their stakes, it can also be guaranteed in the smart contract that, for example, distributions of profits will be given out according to the ownership shares on chain. Not only is this more trustworthy, this is also far easier to manage. We talk with groups where they sometimes spend multiple days just sending wire transfers, because every single wire transfer they send, they have to go through the bank's verification process. So they'll have to do that 80 or 90 times. Separate phone calls with the bank, oftentimes like ten to 15 minutes per phone call with syndicate. Because we've already moved the ownership stakes on chain, when it comes time to give up profits, you just say the profits are being given out according to the ownership stakes. Never claim it in the smart contract.
00:27:04.350 - 00:27:29.690, Speaker B: So we take a process that can literally take days to coordinate for tracking deposits in and distributions out and make it fully automated and fully removing that centralized party that you had to trust, saving managers a ton of time and giving members a lot of confidence in the fact that they will receive what they've been promised.
00:27:30.030 - 00:27:55.534, Speaker A: And then before you go on back to the Tokens, I did want to ask, so you're calling them mirror tables and mirror shares, but is that because you still are managing them originally in some kind of off chain service that is run by a centralized company? Or is it all just being run in the smart contract and you're just using Word, mirror table and mirror shares even though it's not actually mirroring something that's off chain?
00:27:55.662 - 00:28:18.342, Speaker B: Yeah, we're fully living in the future, so it's fully on chain. We don't need to mirror it. A lot of people have been asking us about mirror tables and mirror shares and we're able to show them, oh, you actually don't even need to mirror it. You can go directly on chain and directly live in the future. You don't need that bridge anymore. You can several ties to the antiquated past if you want to. And one thing we're so excited about is this relates to your question of the Token.
00:28:18.342 - 00:29:18.458, Speaker B: So underneath the hood, syndicates are ERC twenty S to represent the ownership shares, which means now they're composable with every other tool in the ecosystem that you might want to use. So for example, the ownership shares can be plugged into snapshot for governance. So now communities can make determinations based on their holdings. You could even provide another startup that's getting launched, could provide exclusive access or airdrops to investors in a highly related syndicate. Imagine for example, a new fintech startup saying, I want to offer my investment to all the early investors in stripe. They could do that with syndicate automatically. So under the hood, by moving your cap table on chain, your ownership shares on chain, what you get is the ability to compose this with the entire rest of the ecosystem.
00:29:18.458 - 00:29:50.330, Speaker B: So we unlock the full power of composability because these shares are ERC 20s. That being said, it's of course up to the managers to remain compliant. So we keep transferability disabled by default as one example to ensure that the investment clubs are compliant. But the composability of unlock is really phenomenal and essentially it gives these ownership stakes superpowers to access the rest of the ecosystem.
00:29:51.150 - 00:30:06.638, Speaker A: Okay, so the reason the Tokens are non transferable is to prevent issues around, I don't know, just anything involving probably illicit activity of some sort or like anti money laundering or stuff like that. Is that the reason for that?
00:30:06.724 - 00:30:49.750, Speaker B: It's related to the investment club regulations. The investment clubs can't have more than 99 members and they also can't have passive holders. Everyone must actively participate. So if you transfer these to say, a smart contract that's fully autonomous. It's not clear how that smart contract can actively participate. We make it easy for users to remain compliant, so we keep that disabled by default. If they work with their own lawyers and their lawyers determine what they can and can't do, then of course they're welcome to use the protocol in the way that they've been advised, but we make it easy to remain compliant so we provide a happy path to ensure that the investment clubs are set up correctly.
00:30:49.910 - 00:31:04.846, Speaker C: Yeah. Investment club regulation, like membership interests can't be traded and stuff, like on secondary markets. And so that's a big part of ensuring that this tool is helping people maintain that status.
00:31:05.038 - 00:31:24.070, Speaker A: Okay, but since there's like a limit of 99 members, let's say the three of us are in some investment club that already has 99 members and somebody leaves, a new person could join the investment club. Is that right? And they would just get a new, ERC, 20 token.
00:31:24.650 - 00:32:08.690, Speaker C: Yeah. Typically what happens, what we're seeing is a lot of these investment clubs, they organize themselves as different seasons. So they'll have like, season one, season two, season three, and the membership in each season will change. Actually, every season, some people will kind of continue, but then they'll introduce some new members and some old members will kind of not be a part of it. We're finding that that's actually like the very common pattern with investment clubs, with syndicate. But yes, could someone leave an investment club for whatever reason and whatnot? Yeah. And then at that point, someone else could be admitted.
00:32:09.530 - 00:32:36.542, Speaker A: All right, so in a moment we're going to talk more about the backstory behind this. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible.

00:35:07.570 - 00:35:14.126, Speaker B: Ian, you want to go for it? We've been talking about this for the last four years, so we've been thinking.
00:35:14.148 - 00:35:22.642, Speaker A: About it for a long time. Maybe why don't we do this? Because I was going to ask you next how you two met and started working together, but maybe that's a better way to start off.
00:35:22.696 - 00:36:40.454, Speaker C: Yeah, so Will and I met when we were both at IDEO's Crypto Team in 2018. This was the beginning of 2018, and back then it was a world of difference in the crypto space. It was just on the back of kind of the ICO boom and then crash, right? And it was kind of actually like the beginning of the crypto bear market. What was interesting, in particular with respect to investing at that time in crypto, was the ICO wave, in my mind at least, really introduced this fully democratized, decentralized, and permissionless model for investing. Now, obviously, there were a lot of things about it that were not good, specifically from like a regulation perspective. But what happened, interestingly enough, right, like in 2018, was that the pendulum swung really hard the opposite direction, and it kind of decentralized around the Saft model, which persisted for over a year after that. And what I thought was kind of always weird about that was, well, wait a minute, these technologies that are being developed are intended to be owned in a network native way by the community of users.
00:36:40.454 - 00:36:45.962, Speaker C: Why is it that the capital that invests in these network technologies are not also network native?
00:36:46.026 - 00:36:46.640, Speaker B: Right.
00:36:47.010 - 00:37:36.960, Speaker C: And so that kind of question was something that Will and I started researching at the time when we met. We also did a deep dive into decentralized social networks back in 2018 and what the future applications of those might be. And the conclusion of that, which we ended up designing this pseudonymous, decentralized social network in early 2018, was that the primary application of there were two major insights. The primary application of a decentralized social network was actually for the purpose of decentralized testing and democratizing investing. And we looked at that and we were like, that's kind of interesting. Why is that the case? The second insight, though, from that work was that the infrastructure was not ready and the market wasn't ready for that idea. DeFi wasn't really like a thing.
00:37:36.960 - 00:38:27.678, Speaker C: There were a number of primitives that didn't exist that Syndicate or an idea like it needed before that would be possible. And so once we came to that kind of assessment, will and I said, well, let's go work on some other stuff. Will went to another startup to focus on a number of things, including decentralized identity. I continued in the DFI space and with IDEO continuing to invest and incubate startups, and in 2020, we started seeing these primitives get landed in DFI that really started to harden. Right. And Will and I took a look at them and sort of said, wait a minute. If you take some of these primitives and you kind of mash them together, and then you mash them with the decentralized social network that we had conceived four years ago, we now think Syndicate is possible.
00:38:27.678 - 00:38:45.140, Speaker C: And that's when we started working on the architecture for it in late 2020. We arrived upon something that we thought would work, and then we formally set up the company and went full time into it in early 2021. So it's been about a year since we started working on it.
00:38:48.010 - 00:38:52.742, Speaker A: You mean working on the investment club Web Three investment club idea?
00:38:52.876 - 00:39:24.050, Speaker C: No, on Syndicate in general. As a company, we have a much broader kind of ambition and roadmap from a protocol and product perspective than investment clubs. But investment clubs are the first tool on top of the protocol that we're opening in public beta that we've been incubating in private beta with over a dozen communities over the last six months. And in the coming months, we'll be releasing more and more infrastructure and tools for Web Three native investing in Dows.
00:39:24.390 - 00:39:28.450, Speaker A: So is that kind of what the main mission is of Syndicate Dow?
00:39:28.790 - 00:40:00.780, Speaker B: Yeah, we're definitely laser focused on investing Dows as a company. We believe that investing Dows are the future, and we think that it's really important to get it right. So that's where all of our effort is around. That being said, every Dow that manages assets in some capacity is an investing Dow. So Dows that are holding their native token or Dows that are holding stablecoin reserves are implicitly investing Dows. So we have a very specific focus, but a very broad market available to us.
00:40:01.550 - 00:40:10.640, Speaker A: And so the name is Syndicate Dow. But you called yourselves a company, so it's a centralized company that is called A.
00:40:12.050 - 00:40:58.030, Speaker B: So we essentially have, in the long term, plans to become a Dow right now. We help people set up Dows. We do want to be a Dow ourselves, and that's certainly something that we spend a lot of time thinking about. The Syndicate does intend to launch a dow at some point, and we intend to grow into that. The thing that we saw starting in running dows ourselves was that getting the initial state of the dow right is incredibly important because once you launch a dow, it's very, very difficult to change. We are going to be very deliberate and very careful and very intentional about how we set up our Dao, because we want to make sure that we do right by the whole community of Syndicate users.
00:40:58.450 - 00:41:21.750, Speaker C: Syndicate is the development company that is building this infrastructure. As Will mentioned, we intend for our technologies to be decentralized and community owned, hope to one day launch our own dow. Also, some people refer to DAOs on syndicate as syndicate dows. So it's a little confusing, but it also sometimes works really well, I guess.
00:41:21.900 - 00:41:32.198, Speaker A: Are those like syndicates on angel list? Is that kind of basically just like a proto version of the web3 investment clubs?
00:41:32.374 - 00:42:09.480, Speaker C: I think that some people do sometimes look at us and think of us as maybe like a web3 native version of different tools that Angelist also provides. Will should definitely go into this, but I think that's kind of maybe a more near term analogy and skiomorphic analogy, but we're trying to really build like web3 native infrastructure for both investing and dows generally. I think kind of the way we think about syndicate is a lot different. Will, you should share your vision on this.
00:42:10.090 - 00:43:25.818, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. So by making web3 native investment clubs, we think that the investments that these clubs make and how they operate will look dramatically different than what came before. One analogy we use a lot internally is that the disruption of investment clubs to venture capital will be similar to the disruption of YouTube to the film and media industry, where YouTube and syndicate both are cases where you dramatically lower the cost of setting these things up, lower the difficulty, so it's much, much faster to do so and increase the distribution. Instead of in the web two world, these investment clubs were often in person meetings and town halls. Now it's taking place in discord and telegram in the web3 world, likewise with YouTube, instead of reaching audiences via cable, via television and networks and film distributors, you're now able to go directly to your audience as well. On a global scale, it's hard to say how the world will be different given how no one can anticipate what changes will come about from this kind of product. But we do think that the investing dows at syndicate will look very different than the traditional investing dows.
00:43:25.818 - 00:43:44.898, Speaker B: They will be much more community driven, they will be much more open, they'll be much more accessible, and the types of investments they make will look very different. So it's something that we're excited about. It's one of those known unknowns. We have no idea what the future will look like, but we do know that it will be very different.
00:43:45.064 - 00:44:59.194, Speaker C: A good example is that of the dozen or so groups that we've announced launching and that have been helping us build this investment club product, over 50% of them are investing dow and investment clubs on syndicate that are women led or all women dows. And these dows are bringing more women and other population communities that traditionally haven't participated at the same scale in web3, into web3 and into investing in web3. And that's really amazing. And we love that we can support missions like that because that really aligns with kind of like what we're hoping syndicate will do long term at a global scale. Another example is know, we have two dows, one called Maury Music Dao, and then another is Dao Jones. And both of those are actually led by communities of creators in the NFT, and in Maury's case specifically the music NFT space. So it's a bunch of music NFT collectors, creators, technologists that are coming together very passionately as a club to invest in more NFT creators right, and investing in their own community.
00:44:59.194 - 00:45:10.798, Speaker C: And we think that that's one of the most amazing things is that this tool is a community driven tool for communities to invest oftentimes in their community, to develop and to help grow it.
00:45:10.884 - 00:45:11.520, Speaker B: And.
00:45:13.490 - 00:45:20.350, Speaker C: Bring it more and more into web3. So we're really excited about seeing that already on syndicate.
00:45:20.510 - 00:45:34.440, Speaker A: And I wanted to ask about that fact you mentioned about how about 50% of the groups that are already working with you in their investment clubs or investing devs about how they're led by women. Why do you think that is?
00:45:34.810 - 00:46:47.546, Speaker C: That's a good question. Part of it is we are sharing and communicating a mission of democratization and empowerment for communities and we're showing it right at all levels of our company and the product. We have a lot of really incredible women leaders at syndicate and we're hiring more by the day. But also in terms of the partners that we work with and look for, we're really looking for especially during the private beta phase where we've been incubating this for six plus months. We've been looking for really values aligned, mission aligned, long term partners to work with who are going on this journey together with us to make a difference using these technologies in the world for people and society. And so I think that has attracted certain types of communities and people to come to us organically and we're meeting more every day actually as we share more about what we're doing. And honestly, it wasn't like intentional.
00:46:47.546 - 00:47:15.446, Speaker C: We just kept working, finding new partners to work with. And as we got ready for launch, we got everyone together and it was like, oh my God, 50% of these groups that we were working with are either all women or women led and it's really cool to see that. And we hope to work with as many communities as possible who honestly deserve access to these kinds of tools and opportunities. So that's a big part of why we're doing what we're doing.
00:47:15.628 - 00:47:58.574, Speaker A: I love it. I find that so fascinating. And yeah, I'll try to reach out to some of them to ask them some questions. I actually wanted to go back to what we were discussing about how you guys think that Dows will be as disruptive to VC as YouTube was to film and television. So hilariously. While I was doing the research for this, I saw this CoinDesk article with the headline, will Dows Replace Crypto Venture Capital? And I couldn't help but notice syndicate has received $20 million in series A funding from Andreessen Horowitz, IDEO, Collab Ventures, coinbase Ventures, variant coin funds, scalar Capital. I mean, these are all VCs.
00:47:58.574 - 00:48:06.678, Speaker A: So why do you think that they're interested in investing in you if this is going to be disruptive to them?
00:48:06.844 - 00:48:18.602, Speaker C: Okay, so I'll maybe take that one. As a former and still disclosure, I'm still a venture partner at Ido, but I was one of the co managing partners of that crypto fund for four years.
00:48:18.656 - 00:48:18.826, Speaker B: Right.
00:48:18.848 - 00:50:06.410, Speaker C: And know come from that space, I think a few things about guess, you know, to address one of just kind of those things. Specifically, what we are doing here is actually trying to attempt to solve a really massive, difficult, complex, seemingly intractable problem in society around inequality of access to investing opportunities at scale globally that, in our opinion, is driving inequal opportunities and inequality in many different ways, right? And so to do that, it's not sufficient, in our opinion, to create a smart contract, deploy it, and kind of hope that it goes well. We are in this for the long term and we're going to do this the right way as long as it takes to do it well and do it right. So to do that, we need a lot of patient capital. We need values aligned partners who can help us and actually bring not only capital, but actually really important capabilities and expertise and networks to this project to make it as successful as possible. So partnering, for example, with Ido, which is actually where Will and I met, and we incubated this thing, but also partnering with teams like Andreessen, who have been incredible in terms of helping us think through all the legal and regulatory considerations when designing this protocol and product and stuff to get it right. But we've also brought probably more than any other crypto project at this point in time, more than 300 founders, builders, creatives people in our community, other investors into this project.
00:50:06.410 - 00:51:09.842, Speaker C: Like we have the head of the financial inclusion at the Gates Foundation, who is also a part of this, and many others like them that are contributing to this. This is going to be a long term effort to do this. And the conversation was very interesting right when we were talking to a lot of these VCs, like, are they aligned with us or do they not see what we see? And I think that honestly, if you've been in this space long enough, you know that the writing is on the wall. You know that the traditional models for investing today in web3 are SKU morphic to web3 and the native model for investing in web3 in our opinion. And I think our investors who decided to come on this journey with us also realize that the native model is very likely a dow model. And so what does that mean? It means that it's inevitable and rather than kind of hide from that, let's just go for it together. Right.
00:51:09.842 - 00:52:11.718, Speaker C: And do it right and do it together. And so is it going to completely disrupt venture capital? Will should definitely comment on this because maybe he'll have a different and spicier take. But maybe I'm a little traditional in the sense that I think that it will disrupt and transform venture capital, but that doesn't mean that certain players or especially forward thinking ones won't be able to successfully transform and transition to this new model. And I think that a lot of the groups that have come on this journey so far and many more that will come along the way, they're going to actively kind of work on that. And there are a number that we're already working with that are planning to do that in the same way that web two VCs are now transitioning to become like crypto or web3 VCs. I think the next logical step is that web3 VCs will actually become investing dows in some way, shape or form in the next five to ten years.
00:52:11.884 - 00:52:51.634, Speaker A: Yeah. And before Will gives his two cent on this, because we keep using this word and I'm not sure everybody will know what it is. Qmorphic and feel free to correct my definition here, but I guess it's like applying kind of like the way things were done before just to this new technology, whereas something that's more native to it would not be schemorphic. It's not like you're imitating, it's like something schemorphic is. When the Internet was first created and I used to do this because I used to work at publications like Newsweek.com and the Wallstreetjournal.com and New York Times.com,
00:52:51.634 - 00:53:02.230, Speaker A: you would just put the publication on the web. And so that's kind of like an example of something that's schemorphic. But I don't know if you have a better definition before.
00:53:02.380 - 00:53:52.214, Speaker C: No, that's right, yeah. SKU Morphic would be like, let's put a venture fund on the blockchain, right. And these things and to be honest, that is going to happen. So SKU Morphism, it has a purpose as far as transitioning to the more web3 native world. But even when you take, for example, an investment club and then put it as a dow on chain, on ethereum, even though that is in some ways skyomorphic. Right. What Will was mentioning about how the infrastructure underneath that, that powers it on Syndicate and how it's composable with web3 that starts to unlock these web3 native capabilities, like out of the box that you wouldn't have if you just left that thing on web two.
00:53:52.214 - 00:54:03.100, Speaker C: And that's a big part of how these skuomorphic models are actually going to likely seamlessly transition or more seamlessly transition to web3 native models in the future.
00:54:03.790 - 00:54:07.500, Speaker A: Okay, so, yeah, well, do you want to give your take on.
00:54:09.710 - 00:55:15.486, Speaker B: Some of our investors, when investing in us, literally said to us, I know I'm putting myself out of business, but having a stake in the future is so important that I am going to fund this anyway? But that being said, people still go to movie theaters. It's just that movie theaters are a ton less important than they were before. What we've already been seeing in the venture capital space is the commodification of capital. So if all money is the same and you're given the choice between a fund that's offering you a million dollars or 99 values, aligned crypto, users, operators, angels, I think that that choice becomes very obvious. The way venture capital firms have been competing has been to develop more and more services around, recruiting, legal compliance, things along those lines. And that has value, I think that will always have value. I think that if Syndicate is successful, the VC funds that add value will still survive, just like really nice movie theaters still survive.
00:55:15.486 - 00:55:49.370, Speaker B: But it won't be the only channel for getting money, and it will be a most capital, we believe, will be raised via investing Dows. And then you'll fill out your round with a few traditional VC funds for the services they provide. So instead of a case where the majority is from VC funds and a small amount is from angels and users and operators, where you believe that model will flip, where the majority of it is from the users and partners that you work with, and then a small amount is from traditional funds.
00:55:50.190 - 00:56:04.910, Speaker A: I wonder if the reason that Andreessen is raising this $4.5 billion fund now is to just sort of get in while it's good. And then if they see the writing on the wall, they may know in the future, they may not be able to have such big funds.
00:56:04.990 - 00:56:34.940, Speaker B: But anyway, I don't have any information their future plans, but I do have to say that Andreessen is an extremely long term aligned partner. That's one thing that I think traditional funds will use to compete is that if the funds are long term partners and they stick with you for a long time, that is also a value add in a space where so many people are thinking short term. And Andreessen is one of those people for sure, as is all the investors on our cap table. We chose them for that.
00:56:36.270 - 00:57:06.260, Speaker A: I mean, clearly, the list is definitely all people who are all in on this space. So, Will, I did want to ask you also about this kind of like, other thing you've got going. You've had quite the ride as the creator of Adventure Gold, which is part of the Loot system, and I was wondering if you had any takeaways from that experience. You might want to kind of give the audience a little bit of background because it's really interesting, and explain how you think it might be relevant to Dows and investment clubs as well.
00:57:06.630 - 00:57:24.790, Speaker B: Absolutely. Yeah. The Loot ecosystem and Adventure Gold is definitely an example of the future that we're already living in. The future is already here. It's just not evenly distributed, and Loot is one of those features. I recently wrote a history of Adventure Gold that people can find on my Twitter at willpapper.
00:57:24.870 - 00:57:27.340, Speaker A: Yeah, but can you just kind of recap it a little?
00:57:27.710 - 00:57:58.066, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. So to give some background, adventure Gold is an in game currency of the Loot ecosystem. So Loot is an on chain, essentially RPG game, where at a time when so many NFT projects were promising these super unrealistic roadmaps, we're going to have a full game built in three months, et cetera, et cetera. Loot was here's. A bunch of items you could use in a future game. That's it. And it was the role of the community to add those primitives.
00:57:58.066 - 00:58:45.886, Speaker B: Some people added in characters, some people added in land, I added in an in game currency. And Adventure Gold definitely exceeded my wildest expectations. I wrote it in 4 hours at an airport, and I'm just so grateful for the community adoption that it's received. I think that one of the most important takeaways from Adventure Gold is the importance of one of the really best aspects of it is the importance of widespread distribution. Because it was a fair launch, I gave every single token away to the Loot community. I didn't reserve any for myself. I had Loot, sure, but I didn't reserve any special portion.
00:58:45.886 - 00:59:40.134, Speaker B: And I had an infinitesmal portion of the supply because it was so widely community owned. There are so many people helping out with Adventure Gold or integrating it into what they've built, and that is really incredible that by giving it away, people find it useful and people start to start to contribute back to the ecosystem. So that's one really important. Takeaway the second one. And yeah, I've talked about this one in the past, but it's definitely worth emphasizing for anyone thinking about launching a dow is once your tokenomics are set, they're really difficult to change. So make sure that you get the tokenomics right up front. With Adventure Gold, I gave it all away where every Loot holder could claim I had no idea how big it would get, so I didn't have any long term vesting built in.
00:59:40.134 - 01:00:32.582, Speaker B: For example, if I'd known how big it would get, I would have added that in, and now we are adding that in later on. The community members are building out code for that right now, but if had it done from the beginning, I think that would have been significantly more helpful. So the biggest thing that we help dows with at Syndicate, one is defining their community and their purpose, and they should have an extremely specific and clear purpose. So in this case, the purpose for Adventure Gold is an in game currency, and the community is the loot ecosystem that's very, very clearly defined. The second thing we do is we help them define the initial tokenomics, and that varies a ton based on the goals of every community. But the initial tokenomics, once launched, are really hard to change. So we help dows a lot with getting it right and giving them flexibility to adapt down the road.
01:00:32.582 - 01:01:11.730, Speaker B: And we have upcoming community products, not part of the investment club launch, but already available in private beta, that work to create a set of best practices around community building and tokenomics for DAOs. So we definitely see our role in the space at Syndicate as setting the standard. Adventure Gold was a personal project. It wasn't really the syndicate, but many of what I saw from it and many of the lessons I learned apply really well to it. And I've written quite a bit on the history of Adventure Gold and the composability. So anyone who wants to dive in, I've worked to make those lessons as accessible as possible to anyone considering starting a dow.
01:01:12.630 - 01:01:24.120, Speaker A: All right, so you kind of hinted at some of the other stuff you're working on. I don't know if you want to give even more of a preview, but just in general, where do you think dows will go in 2022?
01:01:25.050 - 01:02:24.342, Speaker B: Yeah. So there are two sides of the Syndicate, the investment process and the community. The investment process is what we've been laser focused on for the past year, creating just a fantastic end to end experience for setting up and managing investment clubs. And we're really happy with the results of that. 2022 is when we're thinking a lot about community. How do we help these dow communities build really, really strong ecosystems? How do we help them grow, how do we help them adapt over time? We already have a membership NFT product launched that can upgrade over time as community members, make more contributions that can then give them all sorts of really interesting perks and bonuses to recognize them for their contributions. And we're also thinking a lot about how to build a community around Syndicate as well, a community of developers and an ecosystem of people who can take part in building on top of Syndicate's protocol as infrastructure.
01:02:24.342 - 01:02:35.982, Speaker B: So that's a lot of what we're thinking about for 2022. And all of that is already in testing. It's already built, it's just not rolled out publicly quite yet.
01:02:36.116 - 01:02:37.680, Speaker A: Ian did you want to add?
01:02:39.010 - 01:03:55.970, Speaker C: I mean, I think a couple things from a market perspective. So I'll kind of mention two trends that we think are really interesting now with infrastructure like syndicate that's rolling out, right? One is what happens in a world where there are hundreds of thousands or millions or tens of millions of investing dows. The investing world has been, as Will mentioned, in this multidecade transformation towards more and more commoditization, but also decentralization even before web3, like with Angela syndicates and rolling funds and all these things, right? I mean, that's a part of this kind of broader historical arc. And Dows, we think, are just going to take that to the logical extreme. And so in this world where there's millions of these things out there, but not only millions of investing dows, but the fact that they're programmable and they're composable with one another like syndicate dows on syndicate protocol are composable. With each other that's going to enable really incredible things, possibilities that you just do not see in web two, where dows can actually start to coordinate with each other. Programmatically on web3 networks.
01:03:55.970 - 01:05:06.430, Speaker C: So that's kind of like one area of research that we think is really promising. The other area that I think is just as interesting is Will was kind of alluding to us. What is an investing Dow, really? And what is even investing really? Is investing specifically meaning like the investment of money and financial capital? Or can investing actually be broadened to mean investing time, talent, energy, resources, attention, those kinds of things. And in that context, you can actually open up the design possibilities and design space for what investing means and therefore what an investing dow is and can become. So a good example is like we've been working with this dow called Vector Dow that is launched on syndicate. Vector Dow is a group of designers in the web3 space that work with different web3 projects. And it's a club of people kind of, but they're not investing capital, they're investing time and talent.
01:05:06.430 - 01:05:44.460, Speaker C: And that is really exciting to us because you were asking earlier, how are we going to increase access and participation given in existing structures? We think that there's something really big there where people who there are people who can invest capital, but there are also people who can contribute time and talent. And there will be models dow native and web3 models where those two things, capital and labor, can come together and lots more to come on that front. But that should give you a sense for how big potential I think syndicate could tap into in the years ahead.
01:05:45.630 - 01:06:01.600, Speaker A: Wow. I love it. That's very fascinating. I cannot wait to hear more about that. All right, you guys, this has been such a great conversation. I've just really enjoyed it. Where can people learn more about each of you and your work?
