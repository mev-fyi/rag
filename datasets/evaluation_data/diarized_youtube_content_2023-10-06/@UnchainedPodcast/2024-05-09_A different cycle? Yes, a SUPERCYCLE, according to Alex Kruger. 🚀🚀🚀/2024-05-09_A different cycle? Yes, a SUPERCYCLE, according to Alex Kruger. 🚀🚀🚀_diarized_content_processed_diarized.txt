00:00:00.280 - 00:00:30.916, Speaker A: I think it's a different kind of cycle, to be honest. I'm on the super cycle boat, so people like to hate about that. But it just makes sense. On one hand, the thing is, on the macro side of things, on macroeconomics, the global economy is what you could call early stage. And you could see this by basically industrials and manufacturing for the first time in years. And it just started a few months ago, starting to grow. And not just grow it.
00:00:30.916 - 00:00:50.924, Speaker A: This is happening across the world. It's not just the US. And you can also see this in basically the price of copper ramping up. So this is on the econ side of things is early cycle on the risk asset side of things. We got ahead of ourselves, as we always do, depending.
00:00:50.964 - 00:00:51.668, Speaker UNK: On how you define.
00:00:51.716 - 00:00:52.476, Speaker A: Super cycles.
00:00:52.540 - 00:00:53.244, Speaker UNK: Whether or not I agree.
00:00:53.284 - 00:00:59.164, Speaker A: With you, but I think you're bang on with the commodity cycle.
