Within Monad we always talked about in the early days that the community is the product. From the perspective of the community team, the goal is to deliver a really high quality product, a community that people want to spend time in. And when you have product market fit, when people consistently come back and spend a lot of time consuming the product by hanging out in the discord and consuming the memes and producing memes and appreciating other people's memes and creating more obscure mashups of memes from that and developing their own style. I think the thing that is very cool about community as well is that the community curates the content so it's highly decentralized. The objective is just whatever the community starts to appreciate, which actually can become a really good flywheel because then it solves for higher quality contributions and gives people something to drive for, which is making things that other people like, and then it's just judged by the community.
