00:00:00.410 - 00:00:25.478, Speaker A: I don't know. No, that's what they chose to highlight out of all of it. I still think it's a really good time to build an exchange, to be honest. Are you building an exchange? Not at the moment. Simply because it takes a lot of focus and I have a lot of other things to focus on. Primarily in the core business of intermit. It's just I cannot afford to lose this focus at the moment.
00:00:25.478 - 00:01:42.138, Speaker A: Maybe in two, three months time maybe, but currently I just don't have mental capacity. And frankly, like the team building exchange is such a massive undertaking that yeah, I just cannot take it lightly. If you ever do it hypothetically, if you were to build an Exchange, what would be different about it versus existing incumbent? Be? I think this exchange, if you were to build an Exchange, it would be much more similar to CME than to Coinbase. I think it would be focused much more on the matching engine and basically like the central clearing part, basically stripping away all kycml for retail people. Stripping away managing leverage, stripping away all the horrible things about running your own centralized exchange in crypto and just making it much more seme like and basically focusing on one hand, kind of like what SBF tried to do with FTX. Like making this central clearing run a very efficient cross margining, kind of like engine and on the other hand, kind of like improvement on CME side. It would be basically running on a stable coins instead of fiat, so that you can do settlement cycles faster.
00:01:42.138 - 00:01:48.720, Speaker A: And if you can do settlement cycles faster, you effectively can extend more leverage to the clearing members. As a result.
00:01:49.410 - 00:02:02.820, Speaker B: Have you considered hiring 20 kids, feeding them a bunch of speed and sending them to an island? Letting probably bank? Yeah, they probably built something with that. No, not in the cards. Okay.
00:02:05.270 - 00:02:50.082, Speaker A: One big change for us. Over the last year or so, we started slowly incubating those products inside Ventralmu like we did Bebop, which was just our play on RFQ. Well, you had Lawrence the other day who is building Wildcat. So we started Debbie into building products and slowly moving into becoming product company. And basically what I learned is it's a very different gig, like building a trading companies, especially if you just train on centralized exchanges. It's kind of straightforward, like all you need is former traders and then as it becomes more complex, you give them more support with back office operations and everything else and better developers and everything. That's great.
00:02:50.082 - 00:03:12.040, Speaker A: But ultimately product is very different because as a trained company, you don't have customers. Like it's very easy, right? You just need to build quick algos or smart algos? As a product company, you actually need to think about a lot more things and that's what I'm kind of learning for myself. And Exchange is like ultimate boss to conquer because there is just so much to be built.
00:03:12.990 - 00:03:52.150, Speaker B: Well, so speaking of product companies, let's get into the news of the week. So Coinbase has launched of course, this product that's getting all this attention now, which is Base, their L Two. Now Base, I think last week we talked about how Base had a developer mode that was initially getting some traction, getting some meme coins and rug pulls and all sorts of crypto chicanery. But finally this week, I believe as of August 9, base finally launched their main net. Basically meaning that now there's a nice little interface and you can jump across the bridge and start playing around. On top of Base, a bunch of protocols have been deployed there. So compound uniswap ave, a lot of the big protocols are now living on Base.
00:03:52.150 - 00:04:23.054, Speaker B: The Base numbers actually look pretty strong. So the TVL on Base is about 230,000,000 as of right now, which makes it the number five L Two by TVL behind dYdX and then dYdX behind ZK Sync. Their daily active users seem to be or daily active addresses I should say seem to be around 100K. They were growing quite a bit and now it seems like they've mostly stabilized. Although who knows, there obviously could be a surge of activity. But as of right now it doesn't seem like it's going vertical from there. The transactions per second is around seven.
00:04:23.054 - 00:04:34.330, Speaker B: Now that's not like peak throughput that's like the sustained throughput that it has over the course of the day, which is again, it's pretty high. If there was a while actually I think yesterday it was actually higher than both Arbitram One and Optimum.
