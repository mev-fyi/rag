00:00:00.330 - 00:00:27.954, Speaker A: Huge news day for coinbase. Yesterday, they put out a report with their Q Four earnings, which exceeded analyst expectations. Although in this day and age, for crypto companies to beat expectations, it's enough to just publish a report. Not a substac, not a tweet thread a report. They also only lost $2.46 per share, and they were expected to lose a lot more. Crypto, where you exceed expectations by losing less than people think you will put that on a bumper sticker.
00:00:27.954 - 00:00:59.370, Speaker A: That's not the end of Coinbase's news. Today, they announced that they're launching Base, a L2 network to attract new crypto users to build DApps on the blockchain. For those who don't know, DApps are decentralized apps, like when everyone at the table orders their own appetizer. I think it's appropriate that Base derives its name from Coinbase minus the Coin, like in today's day and age. No honest crypto company actually wants to promise that there be Coins involved. I just hope it turns out better than Coinbase's NFT platform, which has seen so little activity that it makes even the boredest of board apes look very, very busy.
