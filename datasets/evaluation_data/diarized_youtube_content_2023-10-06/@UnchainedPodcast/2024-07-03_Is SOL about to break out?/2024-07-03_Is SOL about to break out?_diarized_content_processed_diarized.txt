And the fact that they're putting wood behind the arrow of being first to market with trying to get a Solana spot ETF approved, I mean it feels again like, I hate to say it, it seems like Solana is the obvious choice. And to your point, like you've got institutional shops like Galaxy and others that are of who have likely made significant amounts of money off of Ethereum. Finally kind of coming around to the idea that hey, like this, this chain isn't going away. There's a lot of activity on it. It's fundamentally different in the way that it's designed and the types of use cases are very, very different than what you would end up with. Something on Ethereum or even, you know, bitcoin with bitcoins L2s as well.
00:00:45.604 - 00:00:59.260, Speaker A: And I think that's also evident from folks like GCR. I mean the post that GCR put out Washington, if a spot ETF gets approved, there's an 8.9 x potential increase in Solana's price.
