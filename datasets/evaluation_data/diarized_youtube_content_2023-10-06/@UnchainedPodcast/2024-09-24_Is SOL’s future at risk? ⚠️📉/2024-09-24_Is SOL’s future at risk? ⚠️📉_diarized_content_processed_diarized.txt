00:00:00.360 - 00:00:49.232, Speaker A: I think Solana's price got I think the pop dot fund mania really hurt Solana's price meaningfully. And it makes complete intuitive sense why that would be the case and the relationship between the rise of pump fund mania and Solana's price. So that seems like relatively straightforward to me. And the other thing I'll just say about about Solana's kind of price action is I have this view that the the FTX estate sold like 42 million units of lock Solana. I think they sold like 20 million around 60 bucks and 20 million around 100 bucks. And there's some of that that's been unlocking linearly. And then there's this big cliff in March 2025.
00:00:49.232 - 00:00:58.845, Speaker A: I think it's a 25% cliff, I think, in March of 2025. And that is a huge AM.
