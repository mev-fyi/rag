00:01:10.790 - 00:01:14.942, Speaker B: Today's guest is Dan Finlay, co founder at MetaMask. Welcome, Dan.
00:01:15.086 - 00:01:17.010, Speaker C: Hey, thanks for having me on, Laura.
00:01:17.170 - 00:01:20.422, Speaker A: MetaMask just passed a big milestone 5.
00:01:20.476 - 00:01:23.350, Speaker B: Million monthly active users. Congratulations.
00:01:23.770 - 00:01:29.190, Speaker C: Yeah, thanks. It's been a long road and we're really, really proud and excited to have hit this milestone.
00:01:29.530 - 00:01:49.978, Speaker B: Yeah, it is quite a milestone. For an online wallet is something that requires a learning curve for people. So the fact that there are that many people who've done that, that is pretty amazing. One other thing that I found really fascinating about this milestone is that it wasn't that long ago, just in October, that MetaMask crossed 1 million monthly active users.
00:01:50.074 - 00:01:52.074, Speaker A: So how do you think you quintupled.
00:01:52.122 - 00:01:54.626, Speaker B: Your active user base within the last seven months?
00:01:54.808 - 00:03:25.678, Speaker C: Well, I definitely think that there's been a combination of a few factors all coming together. Of course, everybody knows that NFTs have been a really big cultural event, and so NFT participation, I think, brought a lot of people in. I think it was a use case that people it was simple enough that it was engaging and it was fun and you didn't have to read a white paper to appreciate some art. And then at the same time, we're seeing the rise and emergence of a lot of Ethereum compatible other blockchains side chains and layer two networks coming about and that's really increasing the scalability of the entire platform. So while during last summer DeFi was having a really hot moment, the DeFi trading boom was clearly driven by a much smaller number of users that were getting really into liquidity providing and derivatives trading and investing and lending in ways that it was very capital intensive so they could justify really high transaction fees. But that was also kind of ensuring that a long tail of users were not going to come in during that time. But having a use case that's as accessible as NFTs at the same time as we had scalability solutions starting to come online I think was a really perfect storm for a lot of people to get an opportunity to get into it, have it affordable enough, even have a way that anybody could start making money.
00:03:25.678 - 00:03:37.234, Speaker C: NFTs as a way for artists to make money immediately. Now it's not just people programming solidity who are doing token sales. You've got just artists with a following. Yeah.
00:03:37.272 - 00:03:46.454, Speaker B: And what are some examples of the scaling solutions or products and services that you feel like have lowered gas fees enough to draw on many more people?
00:03:46.652 - 00:04:22.880, Speaker C: Well, obviously there are some kind of, let's say more centralized side chains, but there's also varying degrees of ones. So things like Matic and things like XDI are still strong and we're really looking forward to optimism and ZK sync and eventually we are very eager to support more Stark and Snark based scaling solutions like Starkware Two. But yeah, those ones, things like Matic and XDI have definitely been providing a lot of platforms so far.
00:04:23.330 - 00:04:44.200, Speaker B: Yeah. And Matic, I guess now goes by polygon. Before we dive even further into all this, let's just make sure that for any listeners who aren't familiar that they understand what MetaMask is. Can you just describe what MetaMask is and what it does?
00:04:44.970 - 00:05:22.500, Speaker C: Sure. MetaMask started as a browser extension. Now it's also a mobile wallet that let you connect to applications that might have some amount of their logic that lives on a blockchain. And that part of the logic is usually the value sensitive part. So it could be like a Token or it could be an NFT or it could be your voting rights in an organization. And so MetaMask is the thing that lets a user hold their own keys, which means they're really kind of personally in control of their accounts and now they're able to engage with these decentralized applications that just weren't even a category five years ago.
00:05:23.110 - 00:05:41.610, Speaker B: Yeah, it's quite similar to my Ether wallet or my Crypto for people who are familiar. But yeah, the fact of it starting as a web extension, I think is sort of how I always think of it. And so what kind of users does MetaMask typically attract?
00:05:42.030 - 00:06:43.414, Speaker C: We actually have a very diverse kind of user base both across use cases and across demographics. We actually just completed a partnership with this organization called Emerging Impact where they did a bunch of user research where they interviewed something like 300 people around the world. They were doing a lot in Indonesia and Nigeria and in South America because we've been seeing that, for example, what is it? India and Indonesia both broke into the top five countries, but we haven't really been doing any outreach there. So we wanted to better understand what's driving this in Indonesia. And actually, we have a seminar coming up on May 5 and you can find that on our Twitter, where we're going to be sharing a lot of that research and talking about the use cases that people in emerging markets are finding for MetaMask. A lot of it was just having access to funds that they had control over. There's different situations where people don't have access to banking where that's valuable.
00:06:43.414 - 00:07:36.926, Speaker C: But even aside from the emerging markets thing, obviously DeFi was a big thing in the summer and that continues to be a big thing. NFTs are a thing, they continue to be a big thing. There are people trying out lots of new organizations and Dows and I like seeing all these experiments. I got into this largely because I think our society has a lot of trust problems and I don't have a magic wand for a solution, but I thought we needed a platform where we could iterate on creative solutions. And I think that's part of why it's powerful and I think that's part of why it's hard to pin down the use case because I think we have a lot of things we're trying to work through and that requires a lot of iteration and experimentation. So I don't think we can really pin down a single use case as dominant. Oh, and not to mention gaming, like there's whole category of gaming where the collectibles are portable between games and auction formats and stuff.
00:07:36.926 - 00:07:54.690, Speaker C: So yeah, it's spread around a lot and it is often surprising us. It's not all stuff that we anticipated on and we've really worked hard to make sure that our wallet is kind of general purpose enough that it can serve this kind of constantly evolving set of use cases rather than just try to pin down a particular customer segment.
00:07:55.110 - 00:08:46.350, Speaker B: Yeah, and for listeners who are interested, I did interview Robbie Ferguson of Immutable X recently, or Immutable, and they launched a layer two solution called Immutable X. And I also interviewed Marguerite de Curcell of Neon District Blockade Games and both of them are in that blockchain gaming. Know, just out of curiosity, when you talked about how you haven't done marketing for MetaMask in the developing world and yet enough people are using it there that now some countries like India and Indonesia are in the top five of users. I mean, granted, of course, India is the second most populated country in the world and Indonesia is the fourth most populated. But I was curious, did you find out how it was that those users had found out about MetaMask?
00:08:46.510 - 00:09:34.660, Speaker C: Yeah, if I had to put a blanket trend on it, it's people introducing each other. It's not about, I don't know, a central exchange or somebody going through and hawking it to everybody. There's usually somebody who's an early adopter in a community who's doing the research and they may have gotten into it early and they may have had some success and right around now their friends are asking them how to get involved too. And so I think we're seeing a lot of kind of grassroots education and I think that that's great. And I think we're going to continue trying to target the grassroots kind of virality approach. I don't think we will ever be able to serve people as well as they'll be able to serve each other. So as much as we can just facilitate that kind of activity, I think is the best thing a crypto wallet like us can aspire to.
00:09:35.190 - 00:09:46.200, Speaker B: And did you see if there was a difference in the type of usage in the developing world versus in the more developed? Or is it what you were saying about just accessing their funds that they control?
00:09:47.290 - 00:10:19.140, Speaker C: Yeah, the use cases weren't as different as a lot of people thought they would be. So one of the things that I think was interesting is a lot of people have a narrative like, oh, in developing nations, they just want stable currencies. Like, if they just got access to Dai, they'd be happy or something like that. But what we saw is people are happy to invest in crypto. They're here for the gains too. So they're not trying to just ape into things. They're trying to do their research and understand things, but they're trying to make informed decisions and educate each other and read up.
00:10:19.140 - 00:10:54.560, Speaker C: I really do think there's kind of this booming enthusiasm to learn more, make better informed decisions. There was a lot of peer to peer educating about avoiding Scams and Fishers, and I think that was a really good, healthy sign. We know Fishers are a serious problem and Fishers know that crypto users, you've got money that's yours and it's digital. It's a ripe place to deceive people. But fortunately, I think that there's also a bit of a grassroots immune system kicking into gear too. And it was really great to see that also happening.
00:10:55.250 - 00:11:10.740, Speaker B: Yeah, clearly some of the echoes of 2017 are reverberating out into 2021. All right, so in a moment we're going to discuss some of the new features and services of MetaMask. But first, quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible.

00:12:11.130 - 00:12:26.682, Speaker B: Back to my conversation with Sand Finlay. One of the newer features that MetaMask adopted was swaps in October 2020. Tell us how that works and what the user uptake has been and what people have been using swaps for. Cool.
00:12:26.736 - 00:13:17.130, Speaker C: So swaps is a tool that we added to the wallet that helps users discover what's likely the best trade they can make at any given time, given an asset pair they're trying to exchange. So we scan liquidity sources from a wide variety of DEXes and Dex aggregators. And what we found is oftentimes we're able to find, depending on the pair and the depth that the person's trying to trade, we're often able to find a particular trade route that the user wouldn't think of on their own and then let them make that trade on their own. We are taking a small fee on that and it's meant that we've had our first revenue stream and that's been really valuable because we've been able to staff up and actually start improving the wallet in ways that we have been a bit more constrained to previously.
00:13:17.550 - 00:13:23.790, Speaker B: And MetaMask has been around since May 2016. What have been the pivotal moments for gaining new users?
00:13:24.210 - 00:14:06.570, Speaker C: Yeah, well, I think it all started with a couple tutorials about how to build an application for Ethereum and how to connect it to MetaMask. There were obviously a lot of experiments, people trying to figure out the best use cases. I think that games started really paving a lot of ground for user experience and watching transactions a little better. When people started doing lending for the first time, I think the lending protocols started breaking way to the idea that you can deposit one token and get another one. So you kind of started to get the beginning of derivatives trading. I continuously love all the work on contract accounts. They're coming a long way.
00:14:06.570 - 00:14:47.270, Speaker C: A lot of the proliferation of NFTs this year, which has been a lot of the success, is the fact that there's like five viable NFT platforms, all in hot competition and they're competing for artists interest in distribution. And I think that plays a major role in this particular run, for sure. And DEXs, of course, automated market makers and stuff, having one click trading has been huge and we wouldn't have been able to create our swaps product if there hadn't been such a rich ecosystem of DEXes for us to draw on. It's the kind of product we couldn't have launched on our own. It's like the culmination of a lot of other people helping.
00:14:47.630 - 00:15:34.198, Speaker B: Yeah, it's pretty meta actually, because sorry, not to make a funny pun on your name, but because if you're not only aggregating the different DEXes, but then even the Dex aggregators, I can't think of an equivalent because it's not quite Kayak, but whatever's above Kayak. So anyway, I found that interesting and I just wanted to ask also because NFTs are drawing in quite a different crowd from the typical crypto crowd and I wondered for that crowd, have you noticed any particular challenges with them in using MetaMask? And if so, how are you either modifying the wallet in order to accommodate them, or how are you trying to get the word out about educating them about how to use it?
00:15:34.364 - 00:16:44.262, Speaker C: Yeah, so some of the two biggest short term problems that we're working hard on addressing right now are about scalability, so making it easier and easier to use ethereum compatible chains and layer twos, and then just security. Because while users have been able to wield private keys safely, new users are the most vulnerable. And so we're really kind of redoubling and redoubling our efforts to improve our onboarding education, improving in app education, just really trying to protect users from Fishers as much as possible. The Fishers are very alive, and they're coming, after all, crypto users. I know it sometimes foresees as just a private key based account issue, but if you ever have control of funds that are digital, people will try to trick you into sending them to you. So I think this is like a critical moment for the Internet to start growing up about how people discover information. A lot of the problems stem from people searching Google for support, just things as simple as that, the habituation towards the search engine.
00:16:44.262 - 00:17:05.250, Speaker C: So we're fighting a big battle, but I think it's the right fight. And I think in the long term, if we're going to have digital currency, we need people finding the trustworthy paths of getting information for what they're investing in and how they're handling it. So that's one of our big fights this quarter. Fishers, we're coming for you. I hope you've enjoyed the ride.
00:17:06.230 - 00:17:11.480, Speaker B: But when you say that, is it just about the information? Are you also changing the wallet in some way?
00:17:12.730 - 00:17:46.770, Speaker C: Yeah. No. I mean, we've been doing a lot of different research on ways of changing the wallet in variety of ways. So we're both, of course, doing some improved education. We are also continuing our extensibility project, which is going to let us integrate more and more account types. So we are interested in facilitating, let's say, multifactor type accounts. But partly because there are different kinds of cryptography for different protocols and different scaling solutions, there isn't exactly a one size fits all solution to those problems.
00:17:46.770 - 00:18:10.300, Speaker C: So we're working hard to be a kind of wallet that can let users opt into the types of risks that they want to take. So there's a longer story we're doing this year, which is we are working on this extensibility system that we hope will let users lock down their accounts even more. But it still always starts with education and making sure users aren't trusting the wrong people.
00:18:10.990 - 00:18:31.790, Speaker B: And for listeners, just a multi SIG wallet is, of course, one where it requires multiple signatures. For instance, two out of three or three out of five. But is multifactor just like with any web service where it's like a password and a code sent to your phone or a password and a UB key or something. Is that what you mean by that? Multifactor?
00:18:32.450 - 00:18:59.960, Speaker C: Yeah. And the cool thing about encrypto is because they're just cryptographic keys, you can kind of choose your own multifactor solution. You can pick what devices you want. We start with the user having full control, but they can distribute it in whatever way they want. Unlike traditional two factor where you are still just validating your identity to a particular server, there's still kind of a single source of truth there.
00:19:00.330 - 00:19:09.114, Speaker B: And so earlier you mentioned that swaps have brought in revenue for the first time for you. Can you give us any figures on how much you are pulling in?
00:19:09.312 - 00:19:42.054, Speaker C: So we did publish a dashboard. I don't have it right now, but we surpassed a total of $2 billion swapped. So that's not revenue, but that's how much has been traded. The math isn't totally trivial to get our revenue because we have made some partnerships with DEXes so that we're not adding a fee to them. But yeah, it's been substantial for the size of team that we are. It's been very encouraging and very motivating. And so we're just going to be doing more.
00:19:42.252 - 00:19:47.974, Speaker B: And so other than some of the other improvements that you discussed, what else are you going to do next?
00:19:48.012 - 00:20:36.246, Speaker C: With MetaMask, we're going to be doing quite a bit the tip of the iceberg. So, I mean, we're working obviously on layer two and I talked a little bit about that. The first phase of that is just making it easy to add and switch between different ledgers. We are also working on a lot of kind of deep user experience challenges. So we have staffed up and added a lot of designers to our team. We've been doing a lot of design research and we're working on making sure that not only are we adding all these additional ledgers, but we're making sure that the wallet continues to be coherent and even dare say simple in the context of what's under the hood, an increasingly complicated situation. I think we're going to be an increasingly MultiChain wallet this year.
00:20:36.246 - 00:21:34.874, Speaker C: And we've got a couple kinds of new variants of the products coming out this year that are going to let us iterate and experiment even faster, which I think is going to be really great because this ecosystem has no end to its appetite for experimentation. So I think we're going to be creating a pipeline where we can validate proposals, experiment with them and implement them in the wallet a lot faster. So I think we're going to be kicking in a lot of faster innovation, a lot of that in service of our extensibility system. Our extensibility system is going to let eventually anyone add new blockchains to the wallet, even ones we didn't design to, and new account types and like multi sigs contract accounts and voting rights in an organization, et cetera. Hardware, wallets. The list is really long. So yeah, that's kind of what's going on for us.
00:21:34.874 - 00:22:05.730, Speaker C: It's actually quite a long roadmap. I hope I didn't summarize it too pitifully. We're really excited about it. We think that we're going to help turn what's today a kind of rudimentary cryptographic way of interacting with applications and we're going to establish kind of the new way of engaging with untrusted second parties. Our goal is, look, we're going to decentralize digital authority and we want to be the wallet that people use to make deals.
00:22:06.070 - 00:22:23.820, Speaker B: And two last quick questions. So you've been using this word extensibility and from the way you're using it, I'm guessing it's kind of like allowing the user to customize to turn it into a multi SIG if they want, or to just add more security. Is that what you mean by that?
00:22:24.350 - 00:23:03.926, Speaker C: Yeah, the same way the ethereum blockchain is interesting because people can deploy new contracts to it. We want our wallet to be the kind of thing where you can deploy new features into it. It's kind of like your own personal blockchain you could think of it as except it has hooks where it could potentially enhance your user experience. It could maybe add extra security indications when you're interacting with things. It could even include your friends recommendations of things you're interacting with. I think that it's really going to be the beginning of a whole new chapter. Extensibility at the blockchain layer is really valuable but it just hasn't really been accessible to the end user yet.
00:23:03.926 - 00:23:28.506, Speaker C: There's still like every time a new contract comes out, you're waiting for this long pipeline of people to make an interface for it and then make a wallet integration for it and so on and so forth. We're going to just shorten that bridge and so the pipeline from innovation to your hands as any user is going to get really short and I think we're going to enter a time of very exciting and interesting creativity.
00:23:28.698 - 00:23:34.880, Speaker B: Sounds super interesting. And then when you said you were going to add other blockchains, which do you think are at the top of the list?
00:23:35.410 - 00:23:54.402, Speaker C: Through Extensibility we should be able to support any blockchain. We are working with a variety of different groups. We're working with groups to make sure that we're covering a general use case. Yeah, I don't know if we have any arrangements or commitments yet. We have been working with Filecoin that's totally public. We've got a filecoin. Beta.
00:23:54.402 - 00:24:34.100, Speaker C: So there's a beta version of MetaMask that developers can download today that supports Filecoin. So that's a good example of one. If you had Filecoin in your crypto wallet that can connect to applications, then that means you could upload things and pay for things to get persistently hosted in a decentralized network from your wallet. Or you could commit to hosting something for someone else and then writing contracts that relate to file presence, et cetera. It kind of opens up another dimension to smart contracts and the more other purpose driven blockchains we add, I think they'll really have compounding effects in the way that they interact with each other.
00:24:34.790 - 00:24:46.374, Speaker B: Well, this is just super fascinating, and I'm so glad that we checked in with you and I look forward to hearing what you guys are up to next. So thank you so much for coming on. Unconfirmed cool.
00:24:46.412 - 00:24:47.782, Speaker C: Thanks so much for having me.

Thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap. First headline bitcoin institutional adoption strengthens as bitcoin ETF is delayed Sources tell CoinDesk that J. B.
00:25:46.746 - 00:26:21.960, Speaker A: Morgan Chase will be offering an actively managed bitcoin fund to certain clients as soon as this summer, marking an about phase for the company led by CEO Jamie Dimon, who infamously called bitcoin a fraud back in 2017. NYDIG, a bitcoincentric investment firm, will serve as the fund's custody provider. Asian video game publisher Nexon, a publicly traded company, announced the purchase of roughly $100 million worth of bitcoin. The allocation represents about 2% of its total cash and cash equivalents as of December 2020.
00:26:23.050 - 00:26:23.766, Speaker B: The US.
00:26:23.868 - 00:27:07.174, Speaker A: Securities and exchange commission delayed its ruling on van X bitcoin ETF application, extending the original 45 day decision window to 90 days. The new deadline is set for June 17, though it could be further delayed to encompass 240 days. The extension should not come as a surprise. The securities regulator has delayed other bitcoin ETF proposals, each ending in rejection. Next headline tesla sold 10% of its bitcoin position. A Q one earnings report showed that Tesla generated $100 million in income from the sale of bitcoin, helping boost profits to a quarterly record high to start 2021. The electric vehicle company's original purchase of $1.5
00:27:07.174 - 00:27:43.070, Speaker A: billion in bitcoin is currently valued at $2.48 billion. Even with the sale, barstool CEO Dave Portnoy acting as a stand in for crypto, day traders and people who don't know how to hoddle tweeted at musk. So am I understanding this correctly? Elon musk buys bitcoin, then he pumps it, it goes up, then he dumps it and makes a fortune? Listen, I own one bitcoin, but bitcoin is exactly who we thought it was. Just don't be last one. Hoddling the bag. Musk responded, no, you do not.
00:27:43.070 - 00:28:44.370, Speaker A: I have not sold any of my bitcoin. Tesla sold 10% of its holdings, essentially to prove liquidity of bitcoin as an alternative to holding cash on balance sheet. Bloomberg columnist Matt Levine noted that Tesla's chief financial officer, Zachary Kirkhorn, discussed bitcoin liquidity a lot on the call. As Levine put it, quote Tesla decided to put a chunk of its corporate cash into bitcoin and I guess needed to make sure that its money wasn't trapped a reasonable concern. He then brought up the accounting rules that can be a negative for companies holding bitcoin on their balance sheets, he says, quote when your bitcoins go up, you don't book a gain, but when they go down, you do book a loss.
