00:00:00.330 - 00:00:02.474, Speaker A: Not a dividend, it's a tale of two quan.
00:00:02.522 - 00:00:05.162, Speaker B: Now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet.
00:00:05.226 - 00:00:07.722, Speaker C: Generally speaking, airdrops are kind of pointless anyways.
00:00:07.866 - 00:00:10.618, Speaker B: Unnamed trading firms who are very involved.
00:00:10.714 - 00:00:12.782, Speaker D: Alec ETH is the ultimate on this.
00:00:12.836 - 00:00:15.840, Speaker E: DeFi protocols are the antidote to this problem.
00:00:16.690 - 00:00:29.314, Speaker B: Okay, great. Alright, let's go ahead and do this. Hello everybody. Welcome to the chopping block. Every couple weeks, the four of us get together and give the industry insider's perspective on the crypto topics of today. So quick intros. First you've got Tom, the DeFi maven and Master of Memes.
00:00:29.314 - 00:00:43.718, Speaker B: Next we've got Robert, the crypto connoisseur and Captain of Compound. Then we've got Tarun the gigabrain and grand Poohba at Gauntlet. And then today we've got a special guest, Jake Trevinsky, jurist prudential juggernaut at the Blockchain Association. And then you've got myself. I'm haseeb the head hat man at.
00:00:43.724 - 00:00:48.280, Speaker D: Dragonfly Jurisprudential juggernaut, that's your best one.
00:00:48.890 - 00:00:52.862, Speaker A: I really like that. Was wondering what I was going to get and I'm very pleased. So thanks for that.
00:00:52.916 - 00:01:23.778, Speaker B: Well, let me read the disclaimer. We are early stage investors in crypto, but I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice, legal advice, or even life advice. Please see Chopping block XYZ for more disclosures. Jake, it has been a pretty awful week and I'm really glad that you are here to talk us through it. Let's jump into it because I think there's a lot that we're going to be discussing today. So let me first start with a broad summary and then we're going to go through these individual case cases one at a time to get a better understanding of them. So it was yesterday, so today we're live streaming this on Tuesday, June 6.
00:01:23.778 - 00:02:42.400, Speaker B: Yesterday the SEC dropped a mammoth lawsuit against finance, basically claiming that Binance was engaged in a web of deception to evade US laws, particularly calling out Binance US as well as other stuff that was going on on Binance Global, which we were already aware of from the CFTC lawsuit. So that was yesterday, and yesterday it ended up spooking markets and causing a lot of concernation about okay, crap, this happened to Binance. What does this mean for the rest of the industry? As well as of course, Coinbase? Well today we just saw the lawsuit drop for Coinbase basically mirroring a lot of the claims that were made against Binance, stating that Coinbase running an unregistered exchange clearing agency and broker doing what it's stuff they're not supposed to be doing without appropriate registrations and licenses. And then lastly, they also stated that I think it's upwards of twelve tokens that they've stated over the last two days are securities. Among those tokens include salana, cardano, near, protocol, axio, infinity, mana. Basically, at this point, almost everything in the top ten, besides Bitcoin, ether, particular stable coins, including Tether and USCC have not been labeled securities and dogecoin and litecoin are the only things in the top ten that have not been labeled securities as of the last two days. So this is a massive shot across the bow by the SEC.
00:02:42.400 - 00:03:03.750, Speaker B: Obviously they were telegraphing some of this before, but at this point we have the full frontal assault on the crypto industry. And just today, in a statement on CNBC, Genzer stated the following sentence we don't need more digital currency. We already have digital currency. It's called the US dollar, it's called the euro, it's called the yen. They're all digital now. And then. Lastly, he said crypto is built a field.
00:03:03.750 - 00:03:30.670, Speaker B: Crypto is a field built on non compliance with US securities laws. So let's start with the Binance case, because that's where we were yesterday, because it's the mediat one and it's the one that also is most constant claims of fraud. So the claim is not just that, hey, Binance is running an unregistered exchange. Binance is doing all sorts of unsavory and illegal things. Jake, are you able to kind of walk us through what were the most important pieces from this lawsuit that the CFTC filed against Binance yesterday?
00:03:31.090 - 00:04:10.682, Speaker A: Yeah, happy to do that. I guess I'll start with my disclaimer, which is I'm a lawyer, but I'm not your lawyer, and nothing I say here is intended as legal advice. So if you have any questions about your own legal plans, definitely go get your own lawyer. And don't do or not do anything just because I say so here. I guess let me start with some sort of high level takes on what the SEC did yesterday with Binance and then we can get into some of the details if you want. I think from a high level, as a matter of law, there wasn't a lot that we saw in the complaint yesterday that was a surprise. There were a couple things from, I would say, a policy perspective and a factual perspective, that we learned about how the SEC is approaching crypto and also about what was going on at Binance and especially Binance US.
00:04:10.682 - 00:04:49.046, Speaker A: That was a bit new, but from a legal perspective, we already knew basically everything the SEC said in the complaints yesterday against Binance. We knew that the SEC thinks that basically every single token in existence other than Bitcoin is a security. And they named yet another group of tokens in the complaint that they said are securities. We knew that they thought that staking programs, programs that offer some yield to users, are securities. We saw that in a settlement the SEC entered with Kraken a couple of months ago. So we see that again in the Binance complaint. We see, I think, somewhat oddly, that the SEC thinks that BUSD a stablecoin, is also a security.
00:04:49.046 - 00:05:48.454, Speaker A: We found that out when Paxos revealed that they had gotten a Wells notice with that allegation. And yet again, we see in this complaint against Binance that the SEC claims that BUSD is indeed a security. So we didn't really learn a whole lot new about the SEC's theories on the application of the securities laws to crypto that are relevant for the broader industry. I think the two things that we did learn that are quite new are number one, the SEC, as a matter of policy, has decided that they're not playing around anymore, right? They are not trying to regulate this industry by enforcement, which is what they've seemed to be doing for the last, I would say, four or five years. They're trying to ban this industry by enforcement. They are not trying to leave any room for there to be a crypto exchange like Binance or like Coinbase that can offer services to US persons outside of trading Bitcoin and maybe trading Ether, although that's sort of up in the air as well. So I think that the gloves are off, so to speak, and the SEC has decided that they really are coming after the whole industry.
00:05:48.454 - 00:06:36.742, Speaker A: A sad situation, but I think pretty clear. And the statements that Chair Gensler made on TV that you mentioned, I think go to show that exact same thing. The second thing that we learned is really very specific to Binance, and frankly, it's reminiscent in some ways of the allegations that we heard against FTX. And I'll stop here for a moment just to say these are allegations, they are not proven. They're just things that the SEC thinks are true, that they were willing to write down in a complaint to file in federal court. But always we should presume innocence, and Binance will certainly show up to have its day in court to contest those allegations. But we saw allegations in that complaint of things like Binance claiming that there was standards to prevent market manipulation on Binance US that actually did not exist.
00:06:36.742 - 00:07:22.678, Speaker A: That was the nature of the fraud claim that was made, that they were potentially engaged in watch trading through a related market making firm that CZ was operating. That sort of seems a little bit like Alameda, that the alleged distinction between binance.com the international entity and binance US, which was supposedly being run totally separately, was actually under CZ's control, much like we heard that FTX US. Was potentially being controlled in some way by Sam Bankman fried and also that it's not totally clear where customers'assets are, which really is, I think, a pretty significant issue. So there's sort of a mix of these outlandish legal theories that the SEC has been advancing in the context of Binance with some potentially really serious stuff that I think is worth exploring further.
00:07:22.774 - 00:08:01.078, Speaker B: So it feels to me like there's a lot of stuff in here that is old news. We learned a lot of this from the CFTC lawsuit against Binance a while back. And so the SEC kind of retreading and giving some more evidence, some more testimony from individual officers at Binance that corroborate some of these things. The big things that were surprising to me so one was just the amount of wash trading on Binance US that was surprising to me. Binance US was posting like moderately good volumes, but not know when you go in Coin market cap and you see the fake exchanges, that number two exchange is like, MEXC, and it says it does 3 billion in volume a day. You're like, that's not true. Obviously not.
00:08:01.078 - 00:08:14.118, Speaker B: Binance US was never posting those kinds of volumes. I was like, okay, if you're going to wash trade, why not wash trade your way to unseat Coinbase? But I guess, I don't know, they were reasonable about it, which I guess is good. The other thing, I mean, I don't.
00:08:14.134 - 00:08:17.798, Speaker D: Think anybody reasonably sized wash trading.
00:08:17.974 - 00:08:19.414, Speaker B: I thought it was very reasonably sized.
00:08:19.462 - 00:08:22.170, Speaker D: Not to bring back the 2021 meme.
00:08:25.650 - 00:08:43.970, Speaker B: I feel like I was not surprised that CZ still wielded all this control over finance US. I feel like anybody who knows CZ or how he operates would not have been surprised by that. And the fact that all these executives kept leaving, I don't think anybody who really understood what was going on there had an idea that they were totally separated.
00:08:44.470 - 00:09:15.454, Speaker C: Well, speaking of officers that kept leaving, I think when the CFTC complaint came out, they had screenshots or records of CZS or some internal signal chat, and people were like, how did they get these? Because presumably they did not break signal. And in this complaint, they say two former CEOs of Binance or Bam Trading were cooperating. And so presumably that was kind of how this whole thing came to light, or how a lot of those internal chats came to the SEC.
00:09:15.652 - 00:09:50.714, Speaker B: Yeah, I'd want to see the timestamps. Because some of that stuff was clearly before they entered the US. Market because they were talking because this is like the Tai Chi plan, which was basically this was leaked, like in 2020, I think, through CNBC, which was Binance's plan to basically create binance us as sort of this buffer. State to prevent them from sort of distract and prevent the SEC and other US agencies from going after finance directly but instead using it as a sort of corporate shield from any kind of US enforcement against the main binance.com. Obviously, once that leaks, it looks really bad for you.
00:09:50.832 - 00:09:54.460, Speaker D: We did solve the mystery of where Catherine Coley disappeared, right?
00:09:57.870 - 00:10:02.634, Speaker B: We don't know where to we do know who she was talking no, I.
00:10:02.672 - 00:10:06.174, Speaker D: Think I think she's back. So it's like totally it seems like.
00:10:06.212 - 00:10:07.840, Speaker B: She'S definitely glad to hear that.
00:10:08.610 - 00:10:16.466, Speaker D: Well, there were all these theories, right, on the internet. People were just like, she disappeared, no one has seen her in months, type of thing.
00:10:16.648 - 00:10:44.620, Speaker B: It's good to know that this strategy of hiring very respectable and government facing folks who are white and basically using them as puppets doesn't work. It totally doesn't work. And in this case, I'm sure CZ regrets having put any of these people in charge of Binance US because obviously they're the people who are feeding all this information to the SEC and I'm sure they're probably cooperating with the GOJ as well in whatever investigation they're know.
00:10:44.990 - 00:10:58.240, Speaker D: A thing of speculation that I always think about is like, what do you think the interview process was for that? Like, can you imagine the interviews dates after it got to have had some very funny questions.
00:11:01.730 - 00:11:40.362, Speaker B: I feel bad for both of them because I can imagine it looked like an amazing job. Binance, the dominant exchange in the world, is looking to go clean and launch something in the know. Everybody has whatever pet complaint about Coinbase, and so it's like, oh, I can be at the helm of this and we're going to create the most regulated exchange and blah, blah, blah. And I'm sure CZ told them all the right things until it's actually time to show up for work and it's like, hey, you don't have control over anything. You don't have the wallets, you don't have any of the software, you can't even directly interact with customer accounts. The level of control that Binance.com is alleged to have held over Binance US operations is just crazy.
00:11:40.362 - 00:11:43.018, Speaker B: Like, basically they had control over almost nothing.
00:11:43.184 - 00:12:24.730, Speaker A: This is sort of an important point, though, and not just for Catherine Coley and for Brian Brooks, who the complaint says Bam CEO A and Bam CEO B. Like, we don't know who these people are. Which is always a bit amusing, but I think this is an important point that from the outside there is nothing wrong with this type of corporate structure where you say, I'm going to have an offshore exchange in some jurisdiction which will offer services only to non US. Persons in compliance with all of the jurisdictions where I offer those services, and then I will have a separate US. Entity that will only serve US. Persons and will only provide the services that are allowed under US law. There is nothing wrong with that at all and I wouldn't blame anyone for sort of looking at that and being enticed by it, by that job opportunity.
00:12:24.730 - 00:12:54.190, Speaker A: The problem is when it's a sham, and I think that's sort of how the complaint reads, is that this wasn't a legitimate effort to set up a separate, compliant US exchange. It was more focused on just extracting more value from the US markets and you can get away with that for a while, but always there are going to be those chats, right? And that, for me as a lawyer, is the most shocking part. But I never get past how shocking it is to see what people are willing to put down in writing and then that gets into the hands of investigators and it gets into a federal complaint and then we all get to read it while eating popcorn.
00:12:54.270 - 00:13:12.186, Speaker B: Yeah. So the key money shot was there was a line from a former CCO that says, I think it's something along the lines of Bro. We're running a Effing unlicensed securities exchange, which is a very bad word to have entered into the record when you're fighting the SEC from, I think the.
00:13:12.208 - 00:13:16.138, Speaker A: Chief compliance officer, too. Yeah, quite bad.
00:13:16.224 - 00:13:30.240, Speaker D: I think the other thing that's kind of funny is, have these people not read any books about the financial crisis? I feel like the famous thing is that Jamie Dimon only writes like two word emails or whatever since 2008.
00:13:30.610 - 00:13:54.706, Speaker B: Yeah, it does seem like there's not a lot of text of CZ specifically. It seems like CZ like a lot of these are recollections of conversations they had. So it does seem like CZ probably does have reasonably good sort of OpSec where there's very little written communication with him. It's just, okay, I had a conversation with him and here's what he said. So it's very mob boss vibes from CZ. I think he plays a role.
00:13:54.738 - 00:14:05.850, Speaker D: Well, a question from our listeners, because I was watching this since we're live streaming and we have a chat box. Is Gemini next or is Gemini just too small to fail?
00:14:08.270 - 00:14:55.834, Speaker B: Yeah, look, it's very clear that the SEC is going after the biggest players, right? Basically, we have first Binance, the largest exchange in the world by far, and then Coinbase, the largest public company in crypto, and the largest US exchange by far. Like Jake said, they're trying to make examples in the industry. They clearly don't have the resources to go after everybody because you can see both of these lawsuits, which, by the way, I read in its entirety last night, the 130 pages, and then I read a good chunk of the 70 plus page Coinbase lawsuit this morning. These are large documents with a lot of investigation behind them. And so the SEC doesn't they can't really go after everybody, but they can go after the big guys and say, ha, look, you're on notice. If you keep doing this stuff, you're next.
00:14:55.952 - 00:15:50.538, Speaker A: Yeah. And I don't know what's going to happen to Gemini or anyone else, but this is a pretty typical pattern for enforcement at an agency like this. They start with the low hanging fruit, right? They start by going after the people who lack resources to defend themselves, who have so clearly violated the law that they're going to score a win and they're going to get either a judge to write an order or they're going to get a settlement that sets forth the law in a way that is favorable to them. Then they take that order or that settlement agreement and they work their way up the chain. And I think that's exactly what they've done over the last few years with Crypto, right? You can go even all the way back to the Ether Delta settlement back in 2018, where the SEC says Ether Delta is an exchange. It's trading tokens that are securities they wouldn't identify at that time, which tokens were securities, but then they move forward and they go after more brokers and more exchanges. They went after Beeksy and then they went after Bittrex, and now here we are with Coinbase and Binance, the two, by far largest exchanges in the world.
00:15:50.538 - 00:16:10.020, Speaker A: I'm not sure what they get by then. Allocating more resources to work their way back down the list. But I sort of feel like one big thing we have to watch now is where does the SEC allocate resources next? These are going to be two very huge cases and they are an agency with limited resources. So I think it's a big question how much do they have left and who else would they go after next?
00:16:10.710 - 00:16:57.940, Speaker B: One interesting thing you saw from Binance. So they merely hit back with a I don't know, kind of an empty statement, I felt like, of just, Ah, screw you. Like, why are you trying to destroy crypto? And then CZ on Twitter, I think has been trying to take a book from Brian Armstrong and just being kind of swinging at the SEC, just kind of antagonistic and almost like slightly populist in his response, where at one point last night he tweeted, who protects you more, Binance or the SEC? And just posted a Twitter poll. I don't know. I question the wisdom of this strategy, but obviously I'm not a lawyer. Jake, what is your take on what CZ is doing and how this is going to play in the scuffle that's to come?
00:16:58.390 - 00:17:28.074, Speaker A: I confess that I'm not sure what his strategy is. I think it could be, like you said, trying to take some cues from Coinbase. I'm not sure it sort of comes across that way. I think Coinbase deserves an extraordinary amount of credit. I think they are in a position, and have been for quite a while, that is extremely unique. It's hard to imagine any other publicly listed American company in such an open and public battle with a regulator that asserts jurisdiction over them and not shying away from that fight. Right.
00:17:28.074 - 00:18:09.206, Speaker A: The fact that we knew any of this before the enforcement action was filed is pretty unique on its own. That Coinbase had been so aggressive in seeking clarity from the SEC, submitting a petition for rulemaking, being very public about the meetings that they had publishing the Wells response that they filed, making that video that Brian and Paul Greywall their CLO made, which I thought was pretty amazing, a ten minute video sort of throwing the gauntlet down to the SEC. We probably knew that this was coming by the time that video came out. And I think, honestly, that is them writing a brand new playbook for how to handle a situation like I from what I'm seeing from binance, it doesn't really strike me as similar so far. So I'm not really sure what the communication strategy is there.
00:18:09.308 - 00:18:49.630, Speaker B: Yeah, the reality is that unfortunately, Binance has very few allies in the US. Right? So Binance US as we can see, their volumes were inflated because it's watch trading. So they never really had the market share that they apparently were advertising that they had. And beyond that, it hasn't been successful in the US. Obviously the founder CZ is a Canadian Chinese guy who lives in Abu Dhabi as far as we know. And so there's I think very little, going to be very little sympathy for a similar type of feeling of like hey, you didn't give us the rules, you didn't blah blah blah. And of course, relative to Coinbase, Coinbase did not have any allegations of fraud or kind of gross misconduct in the way that we're seeing here for Binance.
00:18:49.630 - 00:19:40.326, Speaker B: So it's just a different ballgame. And I don't think the same kind of reaction is going to play the same way, certainly not to the American public, but not in a court of law either. So one of the things that is also interesting so yesterday when we saw this lawsuit come down, markets just dumped. So there was a very very rapid, just instinctive reaction from the market of like oh God, it's finally here, all these crypto assets are going to be rendered illegal because the SEC is named all these things as to be securities and the biggest exchange in the world is now under fire. And maybe this is the beginning of the end. That said, the outflows from finance have actually been pretty muted over the last 24 hours. I think Nanson reported something around the order of a billion and a half that flew out of Binance.com
00:19:40.326 - 00:20:35.574, Speaker B: and a smaller number that in the hundreds of few hundred million I think that came out of Finance US, which are relatively small fractions of the capital that's in there. Which I think means right now I don't know quite how to interpret that, but my assumption is that even insofar as Genzler is trying to paint this as ah, is finance not FTX 2.0 and he's drawing all these insinuations like oh look, he also has this lack of separation between the market maker and the exchange. There's also the commingling of assets and there are all these things that people are trying to draw this line between FTX and Binance. I don't think the market is convinced by it. That seems to be what they're telling us by the and the second thing of course, that there's nowhere else to go, right? So, okay, yeah, Binance is guilty of securities violations and running an unregistered exchange and blah blah blah. But so is everybody, right? Where are you going to go that's not violating securities laws or is running an unlicensed exchange? Whatever.
00:20:35.574 - 00:20:49.354, Speaker B: So I don't know. What do you guys think about why it is that we're not seeing an exodus out of Binance compared to what it seems like the SEC wants us to think, which is that hey, this thing is taking time bomb, get your money out as fast as you can.
00:20:49.472 - 00:21:33.546, Speaker E: Well, not to defend Binance as an exchange. You know, these are allegations that I think will play out over years. This is not, I think, to the average user and existential risk to Binance, the exchange, whether it's Binance, US or Binance.com International that is a catalyst for removing their assets from the platform. FTX was truly an insolvent house of cards, black hole of fraud where all the assets were gone. But I don't think anyone suspects and nor has it been alleged that that's the case with Binance. And so I think to the average user on crypto, Twitter or wherever, it doesn't have the same sense of, you.
00:21:33.568 - 00:21:36.534, Speaker B: Know, it's just another day as usual.
00:21:36.582 - 00:21:58.882, Speaker E: I mean, coinbase came out. Know, for them specifically, it's business as usual. And I think Binance has basically indicated the same. It's business as usual. And so to a know, they're not going to pay as much attention to a court case and what the implications are over the next three years as the exchanges are. Because to them it doesn't really matter. As long as the exchange is still up, it's okay.
00:21:58.882 - 00:22:21.690, Speaker E: And I don't think obviously have been some actions where the SEC has tried to get a temporary emergency order against Binance, but even that is actually to protect the users and preserve their assets and make sure they're accounted for, not to put the exchange in a position where the money is mysteriously gone. And so I think that's why we haven't seen a market exodus from either.
00:22:21.760 - 00:22:24.378, Speaker B: Exchange that makes sense.
00:22:24.464 - 00:23:05.000, Speaker D: I also think the person who's taking over for most of the operational stuff at Binance, richard Tang is his name. He's the former head of the Abu Dhabi equivalent of the SEC. And I think like yeah, but he also worked if I remember correctly, he worked for the Abu Dhabi sort of regulator. I kind of feel like everyone in the Middle East and Asia doesn't really like the TLDR is. I don't think there and I think that's a large portion of the customer base. I don't think that's zero. And I think people in South America, the Middle East, Asia don't really care, right? They're like, fine, the US is doing this, but doesn't really affect us.
00:23:05.610 - 00:24:12.158, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't know that they don't care, but I think they certainly care less than the US does. Because I think if you're in Latin or I mean, look, I don't know that much about Latin, so let me just with a broad brush say that in Lat Am, you probably trust Binance more than you trust the second largest exchange that's local. Because even insofar as Binance doesn't have perfect controls or maybe there's some commingling or there's some of this, some of that, they trust that Binance is a large, profitable institution that has a very strong track record of not being hacked, not defrauding people, not stealing money. Now look at obviously they do some shady stuff as we're uncovering, but on balance, the average exchange that's going to pop up in Brazil or Argentina or something, there's a very good chance that they're likely to just be insolvent within a couple of years, which is something that I think right now. As you said, Robert, many people are not really concerned that's what's going to happen to Binance. They may be concerned that Binance is not following the laws and that they're not properly securing assets in a way that is befitting of a multi billion dollar institution. But nobody's worried that Binance isn't good for it.
00:24:12.158 - 00:24:15.054, Speaker B: Nobody's worried that Binance doesn't have the money. Yeah.
00:24:15.172 - 00:24:25.886, Speaker D: Also, you are right, I got wrong. He was actually the head regulatory officer for in Singapore, not at the main exchanges.
00:24:25.918 - 00:24:26.018, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:24:26.024 - 00:24:45.350, Speaker D: And it was good. My point is, he seems to basically I don't know if you've read some of his articles or writing and stuff, but he seems to be more very much like, hey, we're going to be compliant in the other jurisdictions and kind of ignoring the US purposely in all communication.
00:24:45.930 - 00:25:23.666, Speaker B: Yeah. I think appointing Richard Tang as sort of they didn't quite say he's the new CEO. They sort of said he's sort of being groomed in a very senior position, kind of insinuating that he's next in line behind CZ. This feels like a way of calming everybody that like, hey, if CZ gets too hot, we've got a plan ready to kind of move CZ over and this guy steps in and there's going to be no disruption to our operations even if something, God forbid, were to happen to CZ. So I think the very, very good strategy by Binance, I think it's probably why markets didn't tank more than they did yesterday, was them naming Richard Tang in this article the same day that the lawsuit dropped. I thought that was very shrewd of them.
00:25:23.768 - 00:25:47.494, Speaker E: Well, I was going to say I think it's very easy to say, like, oh, there's bad news relating to an exchange, crypto must drop just to throw a thought experiment out there. If there were no exchanges at all, right, let's say every exchange disappeared from the face of the earth, what would the value of bitcoin be tomorrow, assuming every exchange just ceased to operate instantaneously?
00:25:47.542 - 00:25:47.754, Speaker A: Right.
00:25:47.792 - 00:25:49.146, Speaker E: Is it zero? No.
00:25:49.328 - 00:25:51.486, Speaker B: Right. Is it more than it was the.
00:25:51.508 - 00:25:56.074, Speaker E: Day before because it's scarce and hard to acquire?
00:25:56.202 - 00:26:07.570, Speaker D: But the beauty of crypto assets, unlike normal assets, is there's some sort of, like, Heisenberg principle. You can't actually shrink all the exchanges to zero because you can always start a new one.
00:26:07.640 - 00:26:07.874, Speaker B: Right.
00:26:07.912 - 00:26:25.414, Speaker D: You can't do that with equities because the custodians are restricted, but you definitely can with self custody assets. So the idea that you can shrink it to zero and then also hope the market goes to zero, there's like some minimum you can do for both of them. And I think that. That's kind of like the beauty of crypto is you can't kill it the.
00:26:25.452 - 00:26:28.294, Speaker B: Same way, but you can make the price go down by a lot.
00:26:28.332 - 00:26:32.460, Speaker D: You can certainly yeah, I agree, but I don't think it goes anywhere near.
00:26:32.830 - 00:26:57.630, Speaker B: It definitely doesn't go to zero. There's some local Bitcoins guy somewhere who's always going to be trading Bitcoin for fiat. So that's for sure. Okay, let's move on from the Binance story and I want to talk about Coinbase. So yesterday the whole world was reeling. Markets were in the toilet after the Binance lawsuit was unveiled. And then basically overnight we got the news that the SEC was unveiling a lawsuit against Coinbase.
00:26:57.630 - 00:27:32.414, Speaker B: Roughly the same arguments. So unregistered broker dealer assets are securities, staking as a service is unregistered security program, blah, blah, blah. And they also insinuated at the margin that maybe there's something also going on with Coinbase Wallet. They were kind of circumspect about how and why Coinbase Wallet, which is a noncustodial kind of MetaMask competitor type thing, in what way that seems to cause any kind of liability on their part. And there were also ten states that also issued. They coordinated for this basically mostly on staking. And I think that the different states asked for different things.
00:27:32.414 - 00:28:09.446, Speaker B: One of them, I think Alabama was like a show cause order basically saying, explain to us why we shouldn't send you a cease and desist. And then California, I think, just sent them a cease and desist and said, stop offering unregistered securities in California. So weirdly today. So this morning Coinbase was down. I mean, Coinbase was down a lot yesterday after the Coinbase stock was down a lot yesterday after the Binance thing was unveiled. They were down again this morning after this SEC lawsuit was unveiled and markets were also down. And then over the last 6 hours, markets have just been grinding upwards to the point where now Bitcoin is higher than it was before the Binance lawsuit dropped.
00:28:09.446 - 00:28:42.498, Speaker B: So I am really struggling to understand what happened there and why it is suddenly I feel like maybe some explanation is that we ripped the Band Aid off. We sort of knew that this was coming. We knew that there was going to be a lawsuit because the Wells notice against Coinbase. And now that we see it, it's kind of like, oh, okay, this isn't that bad, or this is like, there's nothing in here that surprised us. Yeah, okay. A bunch of these things were named as securities by the SEC, but Gensler's already said that he thinks everything in crypto is a security. So we just is yeah, this is consistent with what he's been saying.
00:28:42.498 - 00:28:53.398, Speaker B: And I guess everyone noticed that everyone else didn't run away. So maybe it's kind of like a emperor has no clothes thing. Everyone was worried everyone else would sell and then when no one else sells, everyone's like, all right, okay, never mind.
00:28:53.484 - 00:28:55.074, Speaker E: Here's my second contrarian.
00:28:55.122 - 00:28:57.320, Speaker B: Take on this in a go for it.
00:28:57.630 - 00:29:17.866, Speaker E: The actions are so bold and likely so wrong in some cases and it's going to be an accelerant and expedite the passes of legislation in the US that actually creates the long term solution and creates rules for the industry.
00:29:17.978 - 00:29:18.398, Speaker B: Right.
00:29:18.484 - 00:29:42.790, Speaker E: It's such a forcing action that's been taken this week to bring charges against both Binance and Coinbase that it's more likely we get to the end state of actually having legislative definitions for this stuff, such as we're seeing with the market structure bill. And I'm sure Jake knows way more about this than you know. These are the things that are going to actually bring the solution to bear.
00:29:43.290 - 00:29:55.226, Speaker C: Yeah. If anything, I thought the Coinbase one was kind of boring. It was a lot of copy paste from Binance and Kraken and these arguments just I think that the wallet thing was honestly the only interesting part.
00:29:55.328 - 00:29:55.594, Speaker A: Also.
00:29:55.632 - 00:30:42.170, Speaker C: I mean, the fact that after the Kraken settlement, coinbase came out saying, hey, here's why our staking is different and then of course they get wrapped up in this as well. I think the other bit that people have kind of been discussing or this sort of question is like, well, why did the SEC let Coinbase go public if they thought they were running an unregistered securities exchange? BD, et cetera. And I think the counterargument is, well, it's all about risk disclosures. Anything can reasonably go public as long as there's appropriate reporting and disclosures. But a lot of these assets that they're describing were listed on Coinbase at the time it went public. So it's not like, oh, later on they circumvented or had some sort of went rogue and added these assets that SEC deemed securities. That was the case at the time it went public.
00:30:42.170 - 00:30:45.100, Speaker C: So it does seem a little silly in some ways.
00:30:45.470 - 00:31:26.658, Speaker A: I totally agree with all of you. So I think first of all, absolutely yes, this will accelerate legislation and we can talk more about the legislation that's moving through the House right now. I think it's really exciting and I do think the SEC has just lost so much credibility through this approach that it's just clear to people that this is not going to work and we don't actually want to ban crypto in the United States. Right. Just because Chair Gensler wants to does not mean that is the prevailing view of most policymakers. And I do think the fact that they've decided, know, like I said before, sort of throw down the gauntlet and say we're not trying to regulate this industry, we're trying to kill this industry, I think that's going to really increase the impetus for legislation. I also do think that this is a bit of a nothing burger.
00:31:26.658 - 00:32:15.478, Speaker A: I totally agree with Tom. I read the Binance complaint yesterday and I was like, hey, this is a little bit spicy. And then I read Coinbase today and I was like, okay, this is basically just the Binance complaint without any of the interesting things. It's just a pure regulatory violation. And I will tell you in the last maybe six months or know, I get a lot of questions from people about what's going to happen in crypto policy, what's going to happen in regulation, what are the scariest things out there? And the two things that always come up are the Ripple case, right? If Ripple loses and XRP is deemed a security is at the end of crypto in the United States. And second, what's going to happen to Coinbase? And I think a lot of people really believed there was going to be a day where the SEC was going to show up and say, coinbase is illegal now. And then Coinbase would shut down all of its order books and we would all pack our bags and go back to Tradfly or something like that.
00:32:15.478 - 00:32:50.706, Speaker A: And I think people were sort of shocked to see that this is business as usual until this case gets resolved. And this case is not going to get resolved for the next, I would say at least two or three years, maybe much, much longer than that. And even if it does get resolved, let's say the SEC wins a judgment that says some number of these tokens are securities. Coinbase the next day can delist those tokens and continue operating its exchange without having to register. So I think it's clear to people that this is not a path where we're going to get clarity. I think that's going to happen in Congress and there's going to be a lot more focus on that going forward.
00:32:50.888 - 00:33:23.534, Speaker B: Some of the claims. So it's important that you point that out that unlike Binance, there was no restraining order or injunction against Coinbase. This was just like a normal lawsuit. The three major violations are running an unlicensed exchange, not having a broker dealer, engaging in broker dealer activities without a broker dealer license, and then being a clearing agency. Can you explain what those three things are and how you acquire those things in order to be doing what the SEC says they're doing in a licensed and compliant way?
00:33:23.732 - 00:33:45.742, Speaker A: Yes. So, okay, let's think about the traditional securities markets under the federal securities laws. In a traditional securities market, you have three different entities that perform three different services in the market. You have the exchange. The exchange brings together the buyers and the sellers of the securities. It's the marketplace where the trades happen. Then you have the broker.
00:33:45.742 - 00:34:14.350, Speaker A: The broker represents a customer. It's the broker's job to take orders from the customer and then bring those orders to the exchange. And then third, you have the clearinghouse. The job of the clearinghouse is basically to execute the trades to settle the trades. Often the clearinghouse is also the custodian for those assets. Right. So in securities markets that's the DTCC, the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, that basically has custody of every single stock that you can imagine in the world in crypto.
00:34:14.770 - 00:34:26.130, Speaker B: If I can analogize real quick for the Dgens out there in DeFi land, uniswap is an exchange, MetaMask is a broker and Ethereum is the clearing.
00:34:27.990 - 00:34:28.734, Speaker A: Perfect analogy.
00:34:28.782 - 00:34:30.222, Speaker B: That's what they do differently. Go ahead, Jake.
00:34:30.286 - 00:35:07.930, Speaker A: Exactly right. Perfect analogy. And this is the problem with registering anything in crypto as any of these types of traditional categories of registrants under the SEC. It's just not how the technology works. So the SEC shows up and basically says, well, Coinbase is a securities exchange. It is creating secondary markets for assets that are securities but Coinbase has not registered and it is performing the service of all three of these separate entities in one and that is not permissible. This is why Coinbase and all of the rest of the industry for so long has gone to the SEC to say, look, you keep saying to us, come in and register.
00:35:07.930 - 00:35:56.030, Speaker A: Tell us how we can do that given that there is no clearinghouse. The clearing operation is done by the blockchain. That's literally what the blockchain is for and we don't have brokers who bring orders to the exchange. Customers just have their funds in custody with us and then they are trading on our order books. Is there some way that we can adjust the securities laws to address your very valid regulatory concerns? Right. This is not to say the securities laws have no place in crypto, but is there a way we can address those concerns without just having to become a traditional securities exchange and say that tokens, just like stocks can only trade in this very highly restricted and frankly, pretty uninteresting environment? And the SEC's answer has basically been no, we're not going to help you figure out how to register, we just don't like crypto. And we're going to file this enforcement action against you.
00:35:56.030 - 00:35:57.600, Speaker A: That's what's happening this week.
00:35:58.450 - 00:36:01.534, Speaker B: Got it? I cut you off. You wanted to say something?
00:36:01.652 - 00:36:45.034, Speaker D: No worries. Yeah, I just actually more had a question about the SEC selection of particular assets, at least for Solana and Polygon. They actually went into some detail as to why, right? Like they had tweets from Solana and from Polygon that were like price related and they had spending certain funds on things related to exchange listings and stuff like that. So they had a bunch of detail but for some of them they didn't give any. And then there were some very large market cap coins that definitely didn't make it on the list whereas some smaller ones did. So I'm just kind of curious what do you think the I saw all the speculation that it was literally they just took a screenshot and whichever ones.
00:36:45.072 - 00:36:55.886, Speaker B: That showed, that's what it looked like. Really? It looks like they went on page one of Coin market cap and they were like what can we get our hands on easily? That is probably going to be easy to demonstrate that they're team tokens and.
00:36:55.908 - 00:37:06.740, Speaker D: It'S they, but they spent a lot of time on Solana and Polygon. It's very clear that Solana seems to have the highest risk in the sense of they spent like four pages on it.
00:37:07.590 - 00:37:22.506, Speaker B: The argument against Solana was not super strong. Most of the statements from the team are about technology. There were other ones where it's like, okay, the team is talking about the price. And with Algorand they put the algorithm put on like the people who did the ICO no all this stuff.
00:37:22.608 - 00:37:25.706, Speaker D: But my point is they had a lot of that.
00:37:25.808 - 00:37:26.122, Speaker B: Right.
00:37:26.176 - 00:37:32.618, Speaker D: So I'm just kind of yeah, I don't know how to interpret that.
00:37:32.784 - 00:37:54.286, Speaker B: Their selection trading volume. I think it's a function of trading volume. Right. Like Salana just trades so much that they probably were like, look, what are the assets that do the most volume? If we really want to kneecap the industry and say, like, look, you need to delist stuff, they want you to delist almost everything so they're not going to go after some small ball. Oh, you listed this little random but like polkadot avalanche.
00:37:54.318 - 00:38:16.058, Speaker D: There are a lot of large caps that were sort of allied that are traded on Coinbase. So I'm like I was just like to me that was sort of like did they have good legal strategy or was this yeah, it was like one of these things where I can't figure out why. So yeah. Jake, do you have any idea of what the process was?
00:38:16.224 - 00:38:36.898, Speaker A: I have literally no idea. It does not make any sense to me at all. I think I'm going to speculate wildly. It could just be they've had a lot of conversations with a lot of people in industry. Maybe there have been investigations. These are the people they didn't like and they wanted to send a message to them. Like, I wouldn't put it past the enforcement division to be operating that way.
00:38:36.898 - 00:39:39.910, Speaker A: I think that the challenge here is that it used to be, and it should be, that if an enforcement division at a regulatory agency wants to accuse someone of breaking the law, they actually accuse that person of breaking the law and bring an action against that person so they can come defend themselves. Right. So who has the best information and the best understanding of whether Solana could have been sold pursuant to an investment contract at some time? Solana Labs probably has that, but Solana Labs is not a party to the Coinbase action and cannot, as a matter of law, intervene in the case to defend itself. And this has sort of been the SEC's tactic for a long time, regulating by enforcement, but by enforcement against parties who don't even have the opportunity to defend themselves. I would tell you that I think it's possible that itself is a violation of the Administrative Procedures Act. And that's something that we're thinking about at the Blockchain Association whether there's some way that we can get in and say, look, this isn't just unfair and unjust, it's actually contrary to federal law for the SEC to be acting this way, but otherwise, I have no idea. Your guess is as good as mine.
00:39:40.490 - 00:39:50.090, Speaker D: So actually, how does that type of action against the SEC? Would Coinbase be the one making such an accusation or who kind of countersues?
00:39:52.030 - 00:39:56.794, Speaker A: Really good question. Don't want to give you or anyone else legal advice here's the best that I can say.
00:39:56.832 - 00:39:59.580, Speaker D: Sorry. Yeah, I'm not trying to ask.
00:40:01.390 - 00:40:03.710, Speaker E: I'm giving you math advice in exchange.
00:40:05.250 - 00:40:16.018, Speaker D: I'm just kind of more curious what the process is. If an agency does an action that is viewed as not according to law, how does that get enforced? In some ways?
00:40:16.184 - 00:40:16.514, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:40:16.552 - 00:41:31.286, Speaker A: So what you need is you need a party that has standing, meaning the party has been injured in some way and the injury is traceable to the action by the defendant here at the SEC. And then that party has to go to court and then file a claim under some federal law that it says that action that caused them injury has violated. And in this case, I think it's entirely reasonable to think not legal advice, that maybe one of those projects that was involved in creating one of those tokens or some other company that maybe sees some harm to their business or to their reputation might be able to go to court and bring that type of action. This is actually something that a trade association is uniquely positioned to do because we, the Blockchain Association, have something called associational standing. This is now me teaching a law school course, which means we can bring lawsuits on behalf of our members without them individually having to be involved. So for that reason and for a bunch of others, this is something that we've been thinking about because our view is we can't just be sitting ducks waiting for Chair Gensler to pick his next target and then hope that it goes okay. We need to be offensive, and we need to start bringing our own lawsuits on fact patterns we like on issues we like in courts where the law is the way that we believe it is.
00:41:31.286 - 00:41:37.738, Speaker A: And that's different in different places in the country. So this is something that you should expect to see and hear about more from us as time goes on.
00:41:37.904 - 00:41:45.086, Speaker D: Also, as you pointed out, they have a finite set of resources, so you can denial of service attack the fact.
00:41:45.108 - 00:41:51.454, Speaker B: That your cardano bags went down. You might have standing to go and sue the SEC for making you mean.
00:41:51.492 - 00:41:53.626, Speaker D: My parents my parents cardano?
00:41:53.738 - 00:42:15.270, Speaker B: Your parents cardano. Okay. Sorry. Excuse me. Okay, we got the coinbase suit. It seems like markets are shrugging it off. One thing that's very interesting to me about all the tokens that they're going after, I remember it was I think last month that there was the Grayscale Filecoin Trust that they wanted to launch and the SEC told them, hey, no, we think is a security.
00:42:15.270 - 00:42:44.142, Speaker B: And that caused a bunch of folks to start delisting or stop trading FalcoIn. Now basically the industry is on notice that everything is a security. And my assumption is going to be that we're just going to see non compliance at this point. Is that just like, look, come on, if you name one thing at a time, maybe I'm going to go in there and give you, okay, maybe Filecoin is a security. I haven't looked into it. Fine. But if you tell me literally everything is a security, I'm like, look at this.
00:42:44.142 - 00:43:21.370, Speaker B: Like, I don't have a business if you tell me everything is security, right, I'm not just going to trade bitcoin. So it does feel like in a way, the SEC is kind of shooting itself in the foot if they want compliance from the industry. Because at this point everybody's just going to take the Coinbase tack, which is, okay, prove it. Prove it in a court of law. Like, I'm not going to delist this thing. If you tell me everything needs to get delisted, then that's like more than half my business is everything besides bitcoin and ether. So at that point, you're giving kind of the economic reality of the industry no choice but to basically embrace non compliance because of the extent to which you're trying to blacklist everything that people want to trade.
00:43:23.150 - 00:44:00.834, Speaker A: Spot on. And I don't mean to talk so much, but I think you're totally right about that. I think one really interesting and maybe sad part of that story is what happened to Ripple and to XRP, right? Think and say whatever you want about XRP, but in December 2020, ripple was targeted with an enforcement action. The action said XRP was and still is a security and instantly every single exchange in the United States delisted XRP. Right? This became very controversial and I think the reason they did that right, was exactly what you said it was. The SEC has spoken. They are saying that for us to be in compliance, we cannot trade this asset.
00:44:00.834 - 00:44:47.890, Speaker A: We are going to cooperate and voluntarily comply with that instruction from the SEC, even though it would have been better to find out about it through some other way than in a federal complaint. We're going to sort of play along with the SEC. That is not how the industry is viewing the SEC today and hasn't been for a really long time. I think that started actually with the SEC's case against Ishan Wahi, who was the individual accused of insider trading at Coinbase. And in the Wahi case, the SEC identified nine different tokens that it said were securities and also said that they were trading on Coinbase. Right? Essentially accusing Coinbase of exactly what they finally put in their enforcement action today and nobody delisted those tokens, including Coinbase. I think maybe three of the nine were delisted from Coinbase.
00:44:47.890 - 00:45:11.758, Speaker A: And that was, I think, the moment that the industry sent the message to the SEC, we just don't take you seriously anymore. We don't think that we are going to get any credit from voluntarily delisting assets. And we understand that really what you want is for us to delist for Coinbase. They have 240 assets. The SEC wants 239 of them. Everything but bitcoin delisted. And that's just not a way to have a functioning business in the United States.
00:45:11.758 - 00:45:22.100, Speaker A: So I do think we're in this position, right? It's not just the SEC saying we want to kill this industry. It's also the industry saying, look, if you're going to treat us that way, then we're going to act the same way toward you.
00:45:23.270 - 00:46:15.874, Speaker B: So one of the things that I thought was interesting I tweeted about this a little bit earlier was our old friend EOS, if you remember EOS, crazy ICO. I think we talked about it on the show last week. They ended up getting a lawsuit from the SEC back in 2019, and they settled that lawsuit for, I think, $25 million ish something in that ballpark. And as a result of that lawsuit, block one, the issuer of EOS did not register EOS as a security. EOS continued to trade, and that seemed to be some kind of admission from the SEC that EOS may have been a security when they were doing the ICO, like, there were some security issuance type properties of the thing. But basically at the time that they reached the settlement, that was no longer necessary. And so the SEC did not ask them to register and basically said, great, it's a closed case.
00:46:15.874 - 00:47:03.890, Speaker B: It seems very strange, then, that if EOS, which is a layer one blockchain, which does all the same bells and whistles, all the stuff they were describing about why Solana is a joint profit making enterprise, because Solana burns fees or Solana is a layer one that has this much TPS and blah, blah, blah. And they talked about the technical properties. All those things are obviously also true of EOS. So if EOS is not a security, then on what basis are all of these other L ones securities? Salana ada near atom. Why are all of these securities when EOS is not? I know that there's no what about that guy? That's not a legal defense, I guess, is it? That's not a legal defense, right? You can't just say, like, well, that guy, you treated them differently. Okay, I'm getting a shaking of the head. What?
00:47:03.960 - 00:47:12.550, Speaker D: Yeah. I love the idea of a court system where you do that, though, you know, where you can enable that on a blockchain?
00:47:13.770 - 00:47:14.674, Speaker E: Aragon Court.
00:47:14.722 - 00:47:22.006, Speaker B: That's where baby, that's where you can finally point at somebody else, say, what about that guy? And that's a robust legal defense.
00:47:22.198 - 00:48:17.674, Speaker E: Well, there is an opportunity to clarify all of this, right? Like, you're basically saying, hey, in EOS, the initial sale of the token was an investment contract between the organization selling the tokens and the people buying the tokens from the organization. But the tokens then were not securities. Right. This is obviously a big conversation item in Ripple and in other circumstances, but the potential answer is also sitting in front of us. And I don't want to keep on trying to get Jake to drive back to the Market Structure Bill that's proposed, but there are solutions that are being discussed to actually answer these exact type of questions and to create clarity for everybody about how things work, how they should operate and what the framework is to regulate. So, you know, Jake, was there anything in the Market Structure Bill that actually would have answered haseeb's exact let's so.
00:48:17.712 - 00:49:06.714, Speaker A: Let me give you my quick EOS take and then let's talk about the Market Structure bill. I think what's important about EOS is it was a different SEC that made that decision, right? That was Chair Clayton's SEC, and Chair Clayton's SEC, which we all complained about nonstop back then, was basically like crypto. Not on my watch. We're not going to do anything to help this market, but we're also not going to get blamed for doing anything crazy. And that's why I think in the EO settlement, you saw them sort of split the baby, right? It was like, yeah, there was a securities violation here, but once the network was fully functional, we'll draw a line and we'll say the ERC 20 token was a security, but we're going to let the people who are doing the work on that blockchain continue doing their work. We don't see any of that from Chair Gensler's SEC, right? Because his take is not on my watch. His take is on my watch.
00:49:06.714 - 00:49:44.982, Speaker A: I will destroy everything in this industry. And that's why you see something like, honestly, if I was Filecoin, I would be most upset about this because they, if you remember, did a Saft and they did it exactly right. Unlike many other projects, they did the saft and then they said, we are literally not releasing this token until our work is totally done, whereas so many other people did the saft and five minutes later, with no functioning network whatsoever, distributed the token. And I think if you're filecoin, you're looking at how everyone else has been treated and then getting Filecoin listed in these complaints and you're pretty upset. So that's my point there. The Market Structure Bill is super important for the following reason. It solves all of these problems.
00:49:44.982 - 00:50:05.694, Speaker A: Okay? Now, the bill is very early. It came out on Friday. I still have not had a chance to read through the whole thing. It's probably going to take a long time to weave its way through Congress. I think it's going to take a long time to get into its final form. But the idea is to come up with a registration and compliance regime that actually works for crypto. Right.
00:50:05.694 - 00:51:06.474, Speaker A: The one thing that the SEC has refused to do all along. So what it does, at least in its initial form, is it creates a framework where you can create a token, distribute that token both to insiders, you could say, to investors and to team members, to employees, to founders, to affiliates. And people like that have reasonable restrictions on those tokens, but also be able to create public markets for secondary trading of those tokens before you have achieved some magical sufficient, decentralization test that none of us even understand. After years of thinking about this, and that is the right way for us to solve these problems, where again, you address these very valid concerns of maybe the creator of this token has privileged access to special information that the purchasers of the token should also have before they decide to make an investment decision. Right. That's a very reasonable purpose of the securities laws. If you're not an anarchist, I say that with no judgment.
00:51:06.474 - 00:51:54.580, Speaker A: But if you're not an anarchist, that's like a pretty reasonable regulatory goal to achieve. Or for these secondary markets, the bill sets forth a registration framework for someone like Coinbase that says, look, we're going to address these very real concerns about market integrity. We don't want you, Coinbase, operating an affiliated market maker where you are watch trading on your exchange and you're not doing any market surveillance to make sure there's not other types of manipulation happening on the platform that you are providing to US. Persons. But we're going to do that in a context where you actually can register and you don't have to just abandon the benefits of decentralization in the underlying technology that you're building on. So I think this is the beginning of a probably fairly long process that will ultimately yield something that works for the industry here in the US.
00:51:55.750 - 00:52:17.654, Speaker D: Actually. Maybe just like a timeline wise, if you had to speculate on how long the bill would take from now to ever passing in some form versus the time the entire court case would take between Coinbase and Know Tortoise and the hairstyle, which one makes it to the finish line?
00:52:17.852 - 00:52:39.386, Speaker A: A great question. I'm going to say the market structure bill. Maybe I'm just being optimistic, but that's my hope. I would say the Coinbase case takes three years at least in the District Court. I would hope that by the end of the next Congress, we've got market structure legislation in place. I think it's a heavy lift right now. It's a very serious effort.
00:52:39.386 - 00:53:11.082, Speaker A: There are two separate committees in the House that are working jointly on this. That's very rare. And we may be heading toward a markup this summer, meaning they're going to make revisions and then vote this thing out of committee and get it to the floor of the House. It could pass the floor of. The House. The challenge in this Congress will be that the House is controlled by Republicans and the Senate is controlled by Democrats, and it's very hard to get those two chambers to work together on anything. And unfortunately, Senate Democrats have a much more skeptical view of crypto in general.
00:53:11.082 - 00:53:39.666, Speaker A: So if this does get voted out of the House but predominantly supported by Republicans without a lot of Democratic involvement, you could imagine it just sort of sitting around in the Senate until the end of this Congress, and then we have a presidential election and a whole new Congress, and who knows what could happen in 2025. So that's sort of what we're looking at. Fingers crossed that we can get this over the finish line, this Congress before 2025, but it wouldn't totally shock me if we're still talking about this two.
00:53:39.688 - 00:54:14.480, Speaker B: Or three years from now. Robert, you made the point earlier that all this stuff that's going down now of the SEC, going after Coinbase and going after Finance, it does galvanize people about crypto in a way that I think they previously were probably more aloof. Jake, do you think it's not likely that that's going to change the calculus? I mean, I think what you described was roughly what I heard about the bill last week is that, yeah, it's nice. Obviously, the crypto industry likes it. It's much more amenable than anything else we've had on the floor. That's realistic. But Congress is Congress, and nothing is going to get done anytime soon.
00:54:14.480 - 00:54:17.360, Speaker B: Does it not seem like maybe this changes that?
00:54:18.050 - 00:54:54.566, Speaker A: I think this changes that, and I think it changes it on the Democratic side. So we've been seeing over the course of the last year or so a lot more resistance, especially to the SEC and to Chair Gensler. We've seen a bunch of Democratic representatives and some Senators coming out to question whether the way that Chair Gensler is operating is really the right way. Representative Richie Torres is one example. He's on the House Financial Services Committee. He's taking a leading role in pushing this forward. He's been very, I would say outspoken in challenging Chair Gensler, even though Chair Gensler was appointed by a president of his own party.
00:54:54.566 - 00:55:19.620, Speaker A: And I think that shows that it's not just the industry that's unhappy with the SEC and everyone else loves what they're doing. There's a lot of skepticism about the SEC driving innovation out of the country, especially when you look at Europe and you see Europe moving forward with comprehensive regulation. No American likes to look at Europe and say, they're doing this better than us and we're going to lose out to them. So I think there are a bunch of reasons why this is going to get very serious very fast.
00:55:20.470 - 00:55:49.980, Speaker B: I do hate to appeal to Twitter, but one thing that was very clear for anybody who's on Twitter was that no matter what Twitter account you were looking at, this was incredibly unpopular by the SEC. And almost all of the energy was rallying behind Binance yesterday and then Coinbase today as feeling that this is just an unjust way to treat a company that everyone recognizes is doing something genuinely new and difficult in an environment that's hard to know what you're supposed to be doing when there's so little clarity afforded to companies in the US.
00:55:50.850 - 00:56:06.290, Speaker E: Well, it's because it's very clear that they're not trying to bring them within a regulatory perimeter. They're trying to murder them outside of the perimeter. And to anyone who's observing this, that doesn't seem like the correct approach.
00:56:06.630 - 00:56:21.506, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay, so let's zoom out. So I think we've built a pretty good understanding of what the facts are in front of us. What happens now? So we're in this new world. The SEC has thrown down the gauntlet. Binance is on notice. Coinbase is on notice.
00:56:21.506 - 00:56:38.460, Speaker B: Obviously, Binance has this whole process playing out that will happen in the courts. Coinbase is going to take years. What does this change? What does this change about how crypto is done in the US? Does this mean that things are going to go overseas? Are people still going to be able to found companies here? Are token projects still going to launch here? What do you guys think happens now?
00:56:39.390 - 00:56:48.362, Speaker D: First question, who is the next on the assassination list? You know, the meme with the Grim Reaper going to each like, who is the third door?
00:56:48.426 - 00:56:51.018, Speaker B: And I think I kind of don't.
00:56:51.034 - 00:56:52.234, Speaker E: Think there will be a third door.
00:56:52.282 - 00:56:53.294, Speaker B: I feel like they're going to have their hands.
00:56:53.332 - 00:57:00.114, Speaker D: If the third door is uniswap, then you know the answer to your questions. That's my thought.
00:57:00.232 - 00:57:02.740, Speaker B: DeFi is the one thing that they have not gone after yet.
00:57:03.350 - 00:57:06.660, Speaker D: If the third door is someone like that, then that's your answer.
00:57:07.670 - 00:57:22.794, Speaker A: That would surprise me. They are going after DeFi. They're just not doing it in enforcement. They're doing it in rulemaking, which is a whole other conversation. But they basically have this proposal that's pending. They issued it last, I want to say last February. They just reopened it maybe two months ago.
00:57:22.794 - 00:57:54.350, Speaker A: That expands the definition of an exchange under the federal securities laws to capture basically everything under the sun. And that would certainly capture DeFi. And I feel like that's how the SEC is trying to go after DeFi. Honestly, I don't think that there's a third coming from the SEC. If there's anything else, I would say it's the third case against Binance. And we didn't talk about this too much, but the CFTC started this. There was a lot of content in the CFTC complaint against Binance about terrorist financing and sanctions violations.
00:57:54.350 - 00:58:12.540, Speaker A: That stuff doesn't just disappear because we stopped talking about it for a few weeks. And I think the SEC complaint may just be leading to something more serious and maybe criminal. So I don't know anything that you guys don't know. I'm totally speculating here. But I think if we're going to have another big news day where we talk about a federal court filing, that would be sort of what I'm looking for.
00:58:12.910 - 00:58:17.994, Speaker D: The joy of this podcast is it's all about speculating in some sense 100%.
00:58:18.112 - 00:58:32.030, Speaker B: We are the speculative podcast in the spirit of not giving legal advice, which we also don't do on this podcast. If you were talking to an entrepreneur who's starting at the foot of the mountain today and thinking about what they want to do, what would you tell them about what they can and can't do in America?
00:58:33.570 - 00:59:21.006, Speaker A: I would tell them that I need an engagement letter that has my fee schedule set forth. No, look, I think what I would say in general is you have to understand that if you're going to do business in this industry in the US, you are putting yourself in a position where odds are you know that the regulators do not agree with you and you have to have the stomach for that. Right? There's nothing wrong with that. There's nothing wrong with saying you have a better view of the law than a particular unelected bureaucrat who happens to be in leadership at an agency today. But you do have to have sort of the guts to do that. And you also like any startup founder who sort of is willing to chew glass and run through 1000 people telling them that what they think is never going to work and that they're crazy. You sort of have to do that.
00:59:21.006 - 01:00:11.706, Speaker A: But you have to do it from a legal and regulatory perspective. You just have to be extra careful, because you have to take these things extremely seriously, and you have to find extremely good lawyers who can help you understand. Where can you, in good faith run your business in the US. And where do you have good faith disputes with regulators where you believe strongly that if you end up in court, you are going to win? And then you have to feel confident in those decisions? If you don't have sort of the guts to do that, then I think being in crypto in the US. Is going to be pretty hard, because you're going to hear from a lot of people. You're going to read, matt Levine every once in a while, who's going to say that everything in crypto is securities fraud and you've just got to be sort of ready to go through that. That said, I would tell people again, not giving advice, but I do not think that you want to just flee the United States because currently the policy picture is a bit challenging.
01:00:11.706 - 01:00:40.874, Speaker A: I think if you want to launch a successful product or service in 2023, you want access to the US markets. And you are more likely to get that in a more meaningful way if you stay here. And you again position yourself as a good actor, doing this in good faith in compliance with federal and state law, to the extent that you can be and trust that you will be able to work it out rather than just trying to run an offshore operation instead. At least that's what I tell people.
01:00:41.072 - 01:01:38.198, Speaker E: But that's what Coinbase was, right? Like Coinbase, from the perspective of an outsider, is doing everything in as much good faith as possible. They were building in this industry four administrations ago where all of this was nascent and it's evolved into this system we have today starting from almost nothing. And they consistently tried to operate with the best of intentions towards their users, towards government, towards the system as a whole. And unfortunately, they're on the losing end of a regulator saying that their business can't exist anymore if the court were to side with them. And that's a good actor being targeted. Binance, for what it's worth, I don't think is as good of an actor. We go back to who delisted Ripple.
01:01:38.198 - 01:01:57.410, Speaker E: Coinbase. Delisted ripple. I don't think Binance did right. I think Ripple still trades on right. Coinbase has always tried to play by the rules as they understood them. They've always asked for clarification on the rules. And being the good and honest actor in this case, I don't think has worked for them.
01:01:57.560 - 01:02:53.540, Speaker B: With all that being said, Robert, I mean, Coinbase is still worth $12 billion. So it's not it's not as though Coinbase has flushed down the toilet as a result of this. I mean, they're down maybe 15% their stock price since this stuff dropped in the SEC, but it's kind of traded in the same range roughly that it's traded over the last six months. So I don't think that this is a death knell for Coinbase. Although it's possible that if this case works out against Coinbase in the worst way, that this could be beginning the end for Coinbase. But it's very clear, as we were alluding to earlier, right now the market is not really giving credit to the SEC that they're going to prevail on ostensibly what they want, which is for Coinbase to shrivel up and die and go away or only be a bitcoin brokerage. Basically it seems like the vision that they have for Coinbase, it doesn't seem the market believes that because if it did, this thing would not be worth $12 billion today.
01:02:54.230 - 01:03:02.360, Speaker E: I hear that and it's still an incredibly valuable and incredibly important company. And I think that's why they are going to be a catalyst for.
01:03:04.250 - 01:03:04.614, Speaker B: All.
01:03:04.652 - 01:03:29.294, Speaker E: Of American legislative and regulatory policy to figure this out. Because they're the biggest exchange in America with the best of intentions, and they've essentially been put into the position of being the one at you know I think it's going to be good for everybody long term, but we'll see.
01:03:29.412 - 01:03:29.934, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:03:30.052 - 01:03:49.506, Speaker D: Actually, are there any other examples of, say in maybe a different regulatory portion of the law where a regulator tried to kill an industry leader who followed rules and the industry moved offshore completely. Because I could imagine there must be.
01:03:49.528 - 01:03:59.826, Speaker B: Some sort of historical type market, and I feel like a bunch of financial markets have moved offshore. I mean, the Euro dollar market is kind of the same story, but Eurodollar.
01:03:59.858 - 01:04:30.494, Speaker D: Kind of came back because the futures are all traded here. So eurodollar is funny. It started outside and the US was like, we're not going to let these fucking Europeans own this thing, so we're bringing it back. No, no, I mean, there's literally a quote from a CFTC commissioner about this a long time ago. But I guess my point is more just like that's like sort of a weirder case. I'm just more curious if there's some commodity that's ever been like, the US. Was like, we don't want like, shale gas.
01:04:30.494 - 01:04:42.086, Speaker D: You could have imagined that it could have gone the route of like, hey, it gets kicked out. But I'm sure there must be something. And I'd love to find an example and just compare the historical see if.
01:04:42.108 - 01:05:06.078, Speaker B: There'S at Tarun, if you know of a good example of something that was pushed out of the US. Because of regulation. We're running up on time, Jake. I just want to end with one more question. One of the things that I think a lot of people are banking on is that so right now, as you mentioned, there's basically two years left in this administration. Very likely there's going to be an election. We don't know right now.
01:05:06.078 - 01:05:42.230, Speaker B: It's a toss up, roughly 50 50 if it's going to be Democrat, Republican. There's been a lot of discussion about Chair Gensler's term. I don't totally understand how completely it works because commissioners my understanding is that commissioners have six year terms at the Gensler. Chair Gensler has said that or it's been leaked, I don't know exactly that he wants to go for Treasury Secretary of the treasury as opposed to Chair of the SEC. How does it work? Does he continue at the SEC even if there's a new administration? Does he roll out? Does he become a commissioner instead of the chairman? How does it work in a new presidency?
01:05:42.730 - 01:06:27.986, Speaker A: So you're right that there's a actually, I think it's a five year term, but then they can extend it after the five years up to maybe another twelve or 18 months. So I think, yeah, the maximum is something like six or six and a half years. He took his position in 2021. I think that means technically he could be with us past 2026. That said, often when there is a presidential transition, even if President Biden is reelected, there's always a transition before the next term begins where the cabinet positions, and then also usually leadership of the agencies gets revisited. And there's one theory which is, like you said, Chair Gensler has been doing this because he wants to be Treasury Secretary. I don't know he's ever said that, but that's certainly the view of basically everybody in DC.
01:06:27.986 - 01:07:13.538, Speaker A: Is that's really what he's looking for and that he's not going to get that from President Biden, which might mean that in the transition, he decides, I've made my mark. I don't really want to stick around to lose all these cases that I brought. I already got on squawkbox when I filed the complaint, which was really what I wanted. And I'm going to go do something else until the next President shows up who might want to appoint me to the position that I really want. So I would think that maybe in 2025, chair Gensler moves out and we get somebody new. Whether that's someone better, who knows? We all said that anyone other than Chair Clayton would be such an improvement and here we are. What would we give to get back Jay Clayton as chair of the SEC? So hard to count on us just sort of surviving and outliving Chair Gensler.
01:07:13.538 - 01:07:17.640, Speaker A: But, I mean, eventually his reign of terror will be over and we'll have somebody else in leadership there.
01:07:19.450 - 01:07:22.402, Speaker D: Okay, that was not exactly the most reassuring.
01:07:22.546 - 01:07:41.262, Speaker B: Yeah. Relatively small consolation, but whatever. I'll take anything I can get right now. All right. I got to find me some sugar free Red Bull to get me through. Yeah, we'll see if we can get that sponsorship lined up, but for now, I think we have to sign off. Thanks, everybody, and we'll be back next week.
01:07:41.262 - 01:07:41.870, Speaker B: Thanks for everything.
01:07:41.940 - 01:07:42.878, Speaker E: Thanks, everyone, through all this.
01:07:42.884 - 01:07:43.726, Speaker D: Jake, thanks for coming on.
01:07:43.748 - 01:07:45.020, Speaker A: Jake thank you.
