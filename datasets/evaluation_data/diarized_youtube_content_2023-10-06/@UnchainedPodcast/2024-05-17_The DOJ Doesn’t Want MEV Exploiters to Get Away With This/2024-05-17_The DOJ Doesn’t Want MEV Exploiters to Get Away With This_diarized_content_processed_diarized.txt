00:00:00.160 - 00:00:12.794, Speaker A: You know, I don't think it's as simple as saying all sandwiching is like toxic and, you know, crypto will be better, you know, if sandwiching was made illegal by the governments or something.

00:01:30.314 - 00:01:34.402, Speaker B: Is Evan Zinneman, founder and principal at Trailbreak. Welcome, Evan.
00:01:34.578 - 00:01:35.802, Speaker A: Thanks for having me, Laura.
00:01:35.938 - 00:01:53.354, Speaker B: On Wednesday, the Department of Justice incited two brothers, Anton Pereira Bueno and James Pereira Bueno, in the first case of its kind involving an MEV exploit. Let's first make sure people understand what the alleged crime was and MeV. So can you explain what happened?
00:01:53.514 - 00:02:26.844, Speaker A: Sure, yeah. So the indictment that came out Wednesday the 15th brought a couple charges that are most relevant to MeV. Those are the charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, as well as an actual charge of wire fraud. There's also charges related to money laundering, which kind of deal with what the brothers did after they had, you know, conducted this MEV exploit, which, you know, those are separate charges with, you know, separate facts. But maybe we'll just focus on the, the wire fraud and the conspiracy.
00:02:27.544 - 00:02:37.924, Speaker B: Okay, so, but explain kind of like what happened. They essentially kind of like tricked some transactions into doing what?
00:02:38.704 - 00:04:07.734, Speaker A: Oh, sure, absolutely. So the, you know, just a, maybe a brief primer on the way that block building works in Ethereum presently. So, you know, contrary to something like a proof of work system like bitcoin or early Ethereum, where miners were responsible for putting blocks together and also attesting to their validity and putting them on chain, and all in a centralized manner. The current way that Ethereum blocks are built is a kind of by committee due to this transaction chain that's broadly known as proposer builder separation and is implemented currently through a marketplace developed by flashpots called Net Boost. And in that marketplace, that Mevboost marketplace, there are various actors. There are actors called searchers, there are actors called builders relays, and ultimately the validators at the end of the transaction chain. In this exploit, the relay, which is the actor, just before the validator proposer was, there was elements of the code on which the relay relies and runs that was effectively exploited, hacked, similar to any other kind of zero day exploits in finding ways to manipulate and use code contrary to the developer's intentions.
00:04:07.734 - 00:06:19.366, Speaker A: So in this exploit, the relay was manipulated. One of the many relays in the flashbots marketplace was manipulated in order to reveal information about the ordering of certain transactions in a particular block. And the early revelation of that information that usually the relay keeps private until the block is immediately posted to the chain that revealed information allowed these brothers to see that there was effectively an arbitrage opportunity. And because they had earlier in their steve planted what the indictment refers to as a lore transaction in order to entice certain MEV searchers to bundle that lore transaction with transactions of their own to create a potentially lucrative arbitrage opportunity for the searchers, the brothers were able to see that proposed arbitrage opportunity replace their, what's called a lore transaction in the indictments with a separate transaction. I know this is a bit complicated, but effectively, what ended up happening was that the. The victim, the searchers that were exploited here, they purchased something like $25 million of a certain cryptocurrency and then were not able to sell it, because effectively, by manipulating the ordering of the transactions revealed by the relay, the brothers were able to allegedly jump in front of the ultimate proposed sell transaction by the victims. So the victims ended up with a bunch of crypto that they didn't necessarily want and the liquidity pool that they were hoping to trade into to realize the arbitrage opportunity was drained by the defendants in the case.
00:06:19.366 - 00:06:36.164, Speaker A: And, you know, that ultimately, that exploits, that devising of this scheme in order to effectively perpetuate a fraud is what's been charged as both conspiracy to commit wire fraud as well as actual wire fraud.
00:06:36.744 - 00:07:10.558, Speaker B: Yeah, and it has echoes of the Avi Eisenberg mango markets case because of the way that they sort of use these illiquid crypto tokens as part of their scheme. And Defi, one thing before we keep chatting is we've been saying MeV or MEV, but there's different types and there's different subcategories. So why don't we sort of define the different ones? Because I do believe there's a spectrum in terms of what's acceptable versus what's not.
00:07:10.726 - 00:08:41.940, Speaker A: Yeah, sure. And this is something that I think the industry struggles or, you know, has struggled and probably still struggles to deal with and how to define what MEV is, because there are certain programmatic trading strategies that some might call me the loop into this broader bucket of MEV that are actually probably beneficial or even system critical for, you know, ethereum and other similar blockchain systems. These are just basic arbitrage and liquidation transactions, which arbitrage in its most beneficial form, keeps prices tightly correlated across different markets, which is good for market efficiency. And liquidations are useful to clear bad debt from liquidity protocols. And these things keep blockchain systems operating smoothly and efficiently. In contrast, there are more predatory actions that are seen as MEv that really just serve to enrich the MeV divisor, the MEV extractor, at the detriment of either a particular trader or a particular market, like a liquidity pool. And the most maybe paradigmatic example of toxic MEV is known as the Sandwich attack.
00:08:41.940 - 00:10:01.408, Speaker A: And, you know, effectively what is what. The scheme that was devised in the present indictment is kind of a sandwich attack that was hidden from the market up until they manipulated the relay at the last second. And I'm happy to give a brief summation of a sandwich attack, which is. It's called a sandwich attack because the attacker puts a transaction right in front of a targeted transaction right after it performing a sandwich. The front run transaction artificially, you know, it boasts the directionality of a certain trade before the targeted transaction. So say the targeted transaction was a buy, then the transaction inserted right before it would also be a buy, thus inflating the market, giving the targeted transaction a worse fill because the price is higher than they thought it was going to be. And then immediately after that inflation by the front run transaction, the inflation by the natural mechanism of the targeted transaction, you have a doubly inflated market.
00:10:01.408 - 00:10:36.264, Speaker A: Finally, the last piece of the sandwich is to sell into that artificially inflated market. The tokens that you bought with your front run transaction, you gain a bit of profit from doing that that you wouldn't otherwise, because the market has been inflated in order to allow you to realize that gain. That's kind of the prototypical example of a sandwich attack, which is a very classic example of what people call toxic meV. And that's analogous to what happened here in the indictment.
00:10:36.844 - 00:11:39.134, Speaker B: So what's interesting, though, is that people noted that the Department of Justice didn't appear to. It's sort of similar to the SPF case, where even though it happens in this environment that's high tech and blockchain and crypto, that the core crimes really more are about fraudulent behavior. So tricking this relay to prematurely release the private transaction information, someone else pointed out the fact that they were also running their own validator while also extracting meV, which I guess typically there's sort of like a separation between those roles. But the last thing I would say is I was pretty surprised and impressed by how savvy and knowledgeable the DOJ is about MeV and the workings of Ethereum. But my question, I guess, would be just, this is probably going to go to trial, and I don't know if you have an opinion on how that might go.
00:11:39.904 - 00:12:21.786, Speaker A: You know, I would defer to my friends and colleagues in the space who are actual litigators. I'm a corporate attorney. I just happen to read the docs. So I wouldn't go as far as to forecast what may happen here. But you are right, Laura, that just as with Sam Bankman Freed and the FDX collapse, this is seemingly a charge of what could be seen as a vanilla fraud. I mean, you can, you can commit fraud with a blockchain, you can commit fraud with a piece of paper. You can commit fraud, you know, with carrier pigeons, it's just a matter of lying to people and abusing the trust relationship that you.
00:12:21.786 - 00:13:36.738, Speaker A: That you have with them. Right. So it's in that way. This is, it doesn't, it doesn't seem like something that has, in and of itself, broader implications for, for crypto architectures, for MeV as a practice. We talked, you mentioned earlier that this has shades of the Avi Eisenberg case, but it is notable that in the Avi Eisenberg case, he was charged, among other things, with market manipulation, where he was artificially cornering a market on a centralized exchange in order to manipulate an oracle and thus conduct an attack on the mango market's liquidation models. And here they didn't seek to charge the brothers with any sort of market manipulation scheme fraud on the market. These things, which are very interesting questions, as they pertain to MeV more broadly, and there's been some great scholarship exploring how a case might fall with respect to charges of market manipulation, insider trading.
00:13:36.738 - 00:14:39.720, Speaker A: These things that people have thought about with respect to NBV and the practice of sandwiching, but aren't at issue in the present case, haven't been charged by the DOJ here. They really were. They're just pursuing a a fraud case that just involves lying to people and gaining a monetary gain that you wouldn't otherwise without those fraudulent misrepresentations. They didn't charge for market manipulation here. They didn't charge anything under any of the hacking statutes which you see in other kinds of non crypto, zero day exploit cases. It is interesting to note the prosecutorial discretion here in just choosing to pursue a vanilla wire fraud case that, as you say, could be extracted from the technology being used, and just looking at the behavior of lying and gaining from lying.
00:14:39.912 - 00:14:40.280, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:14:40.312 - 00:14:41.520, Speaker C: So in a moment we're going to.
00:14:41.552 - 00:14:46.324, Speaker B: Discuss the wider implications of this case. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible.

00:15:59.960 - 00:16:55.782, Speaker B: To my conversation with Evan. So as we were just saying, you know, these are kind of traditional fraud charges that's happening in this environment of mev. But as we've mentioned, there is kind of this wider question about the exploitation of mev and just how kosher it is. And I don't know if people remember that back in the day there was a time when MeV was kind of like a prohibited, like exploiting. It was a prohibited thing and it was very taboo to try to do that. And then all of a sudden things flipped and suddenly it was like, we're just going to allow everybody to exploit it and have rules around it. And, you know, there are people who've pointed out that I think either the same or very similar behaviors are illegal and tradfi.
00:16:55.782 - 00:17:24.324, Speaker B: And this particular case apparently prompted one anonymous researcher to say, quote, it's a little hard to sympathize with MeV bots and block builders getting fucked over by block proposers in the exact same way they are fucking over end users. So I don't know what your opinion is on, like, do you think that this is the government saying that they will never consider exploitation of MEV under the rules as something illegal or. Yeah. What are your thoughts on that?
00:17:24.624 - 00:18:19.454, Speaker A: I think just in the present case, they just haven't reached these issues. And also it bears noting that this is just an indictment. You know, this is just charges being levied by the southern district of New York, you know, by, you know, the attorneys bringing, bringing case on behalf of the DOJ. So it's really just the government's position. It still needs to go to trial. It needs to, you know, a court needs to actually have a verdict on the case. And it's totally possible, given the facts here, that the court may not need to reach anything that has kind of binding presidential effect on, you know, Mev as a practice or crypto systems in general, just because you could say, hey, they hacked this, this code manipulated trick and relay into revealing things, and that constitutes fraud.
00:18:19.454 - 00:19:14.478, Speaker A: And you need not explore the issues more deeply. But to your points previously, I think that there's still so much to explore. I think there isn't enough research, I think, to really conclusively come to a decision about, like, whether MeV is good or bad in general. You know, as I noted before, there are certain things that people call me, like arbitrage and liquidation, backlining effectively, that, you know, I personally consider like, critical to the way that cryptosystems work. If you didn't have arbitrage keeping prices correlated, you wouldn't have efficient markets. If you didn't have bad debt cleared from liquidity protocols, then you just have the systems would break. So there are certain things that I think are kind of necessary for the way that crypto works.
00:19:14.478 - 00:20:51.062, Speaker A: But when you look at even things like sandwiching, there are people that are way smarter than me that have written extensively, including Tarun Chitro, who, who have written extensively about whether MEV as a practice, even though it does harm the individual sandwich trader, may have broader market efficiency benefits or other benefits, like encouraging more people to stake into a system, thus increasing the economic security of the system, because they want to enjoy in the benefits of. Of MEV extraction, that these benefits, if they can be quantifiable, if they can be compared to other unquantifiable metrics, maybe those market wide efficiency benefits outweigh one person getting worse fill on a particular trade. So there's interesting questions there that I think are informative of what policies should be pursued by governments seeking to either regulate or legislate around these issues. Because I don't think it's as simple as saying all sandwiching is, like, toxic, and crypto will be better if sandwiching was made illegal by the governments or something. It sure seems to me that the immediate effects of sandwiching is harmful. People are getting worse still. Liquidity pools are being drained in arguably an artificial manner.
00:20:51.062 - 00:21:09.194, Speaker A: But there seems to be these broader considerations that, again, people that are brilliant people are writing very seriously about this. So I, you know, I just have to take them seriously in good faith that there's. There's more to explore here than just me be equals bad and screwing over people.
00:21:09.734 - 00:21:35.726, Speaker B: One thing I wanted to ask about is something that you mentioned in our pre interview chat, which was that you said that you weren't aware of people who participate in this block building process having typical terms of service or privacy policies or just anything like that. But is there anything in this case that indicates either they should, or if so, what that would look like, or what are your thoughts on that?
00:21:35.910 - 00:23:03.450, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't know. It's interesting because I'm exploring this with clients of mine in a different context about how if you have a system where there aren't traditional uis, graphical user interfaces, things where, you know, websites where those terms of service would be hosted and assented to, how can you assure that people that are interacting with each other have agreed to certain terms of conduct and. And how would you have a breach there? So there's, you know, I'm working on trying to design with another client of mine, you know, a command line interface, effectively what we call in, in the law, click wrap agreements. You know, these agreements that you have to say affirmatively that you assents to in order to proceed with what you're doing. And, you know, I'm mindful of the fact that trying to do those things in something like the block building space may be difficult due to latency concerns. I mean, how do you ensure that people are sensitive to these things, but also not losing their place in line? So there's difficulty in design there, but hopefully those things are surmountable, because here I'm aware of general terms of service that have been proffered by the developers of the open source code that people then take and instantiate in running the infrastructure themselves. You're actually running into a relay or running a builder.
00:23:03.450 - 00:24:21.200, Speaker A: Flashbots has terms of service that say, hey, this is open source code, and these are the terms of using it. But that's not the same thing as, say, the ultrasound relay having its own terms of service that a builder or a validator assents to in interacting with these people in this kind of permissionless marketplace that is known as mavlips. So, in setting those understandings, you could set forth terms that, right, as of now, there's more ambiguity as to whether certain duties between people were created between, you know, infrastructure providers were created. And if you don't know whether one actor has a duty to another to not do something, then it's harder to say, well, you're in your breach of your responsibilities to me. You've harmed me in a way that's unlawful or unjust. And so, like, setting forth those things, I think, is something interesting. I'm not, you know, personally aware of any infrastructure providers that do have those kind of, you know, command line terms of service, but it's something I'm interested in exploring, you know, both in this block building concept as well as in other concepts like, you know, other infrastructure that.
00:24:21.200 - 00:24:23.844, Speaker A: That I'm working on with other clients.
00:24:24.584 - 00:24:54.534, Speaker B: Well, one thing I did want to ask you is, I know you did work earlier on MeV and the OFAC situation, obviously, which those tornado catch sanctions happened right before the merge, which was just something that really highlighted risk to those MEV participants. So do you have any thoughts now that you are seeing this case on how that might look or if there's anything that they should be doing?
00:24:54.954 - 00:27:09.004, Speaker A: I wrote this big paper, like, a year ago about the tornado cache sanctions and kind of the broader implications and context in which those things came about, because I was concerned that without exploring those things in the context of how blockbuilding actually works, the fact that there's this value being extracted from users and ultimately being redirected to these people that sit in privileged positions, that without that context, people may be acting under assumptions about their broader liability. And when I was, you know, the thing I was particularly writing about is like sanctions law, which when you're touching the national security apparatus and the laws that attain to that, you have at worst, very severe punishments that include, like, the loss of your liberty, which are not necessarily present outside of fraud in the financial markets. Like, you're not going to prison for section five securities violation. It's not a crime. It's a civil infraction. So the stakes are much higher in the sanctions environments, the national security environments, other things like anti money laundering, all these things that kind of concern the broader security of the United States and its partners and allies. And so I was writing about it in that context, but just in exploring these things, I was just seeing that these elements of Meb were just kind of, it didnt seem like people had them top of minds when they were thinking about the way that the law applies to this infrastructure, because it's, you know, before a lot of this stuff became, you know, everyone that's on a dex is more or less aware, if you're, if you're crypto native, about slippage and what slippage implicates with respect to, you know, how MeV is extracted.
00:27:09.004 - 00:28:55.358, Speaker A: You know, as you were saying, a lot of these things were just, you had to be very inside baseball to know that these things were even happening, much less they were happening to you. And so I think that in the years since I was writing about the sanctioning stuff, that awareness has spread not only throughout the user base of crypto natives on Ethereum, but also you're just seeing it more and more throughout the regulators who are paying attention in this space, whether it's the DOJ, with their very, you know, very good, comprehensive description of the way that flashbots works in this indictment. Or, you know, I heard in this past November, I think the beginning of November, I heard from one of the lobbying groups in, in DC that the SEC was holding, I think, its first internal hearings on MeV. And this was this past November. So, you know, I don't know personally what's, what's happened since then, but that's, you know, evidence that the financial regulators are paying more attention to this. You see it in, there was a report by International securities board, or body, called IascO, where they were speaking a lot about finding, you know, ways to regulate these markets and finding actors that are in control, like the intermediary actors that are in control, and finding ways to regulate these, these actors. And I forget if they specifically mentioned MeV in their reports, but a lot of the kind of bullet points that they were running down about, like, people being in control of these systems really reflected back on my exploration of the locuses of control in these systems as it pertains to the sanctions compliance.
00:28:55.358 - 00:29:55.734, Speaker A: And so I think there's just a. A broader exploration about whether these actors are, you know, completely separated from the system. And if they're not really separated from the system, if they're integral to the system, are they, you know, purely neutral market actors, or are they acting in some self interested way that you either implicates, as I was writing about previously sanctioned stuff, or as we were just kind of mentioning, that kind of self interested acting could implicate things like whether they're subject to market manipulation charges. And there's a ton of nuance around the law of market manipulation, which, if we have any time. Happy to talk about it. Otherwise, I can definitely refer the audience to some great academic writing on the topic.
00:29:56.194 - 00:30:04.414, Speaker B: Well, why don't you go ahead and do that? Because we are actually, over time. So if you have particular things you think they should look up, we can put them in the show notes.
00:30:04.994 - 00:30:38.044, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I have a friend of mine, Mikolai Barchenowitz, out of the University of Surrey, has written multiple very comprehensive studies of sandwiching as it pertains to us law, particularly market manipulation. Yeah. Happy to put a link to that particular paper in the notes. And he and his co authors have written. There's great stuff that he's kind of a leading academic in my mind, on these issues of mev and the law. And I think a lot of these things.
00:30:38.044 - 00:31:12.184, Speaker A: I mean, he's the only guy that I've seen write so comprehensively about them. And so he's like, he's just exploring them in the abstract. So we haven't even gotten to the place where there's facts on the ground charges being filed either by the government or in private lawsuits. So there's so much. We're still very early, I think, in the figuring out the way that things lie here, both on whether things are illegal or the policy implications of whether we should abide these things or not.
00:31:12.874 - 00:31:20.466, Speaker B: All right, well, we will point to those in the show notes, but, Evan, this was super interesting. Thank you so much for coming on unchained.
00:31:20.650 - 00:31:22.154, Speaker A: Thanks, Laura. Appreciate it.

Tornado cash developer sentenced to 64 months in prison for money laundering a dutch court has convicted Alexei Purcev, a developer, of tornado cash, for laundering $2.2
00:32:52.828 - 00:33:30.794, Speaker D: billion through the crypto mixer platform. Pertsev, a 31 year old Russian living in the Netherlands, received a sentence of five years and four months. The court ruled that Tornado Cash was primarily a tool for criminals facilitating illicit activities. Judge Henrietka Slar said of Tornado cache that the criminal user is fully facilitated. Pertsev's defense argued that as an open source developer, he couldn't control how Tornado cash was used. However, this argument was rejected. The verdict is expected to significantly impact the development of privacy focused defi tools, creating a chilling effect on open source projects.
00:33:30.794 - 00:34:43.650, Speaker D: Tornado cash was sanctioned by the US treasury in August 2022 for its role in laundering funds stolen by north korean hackers. On Thursday, Pertsev appealed his conviction, seeking to challenge the guilty verdict and potentially serve his sentence at home during the appeal process. Senate votes to overturn SEC's crypto accounting rule the US Senate voted on Thursday to overturn the SEC's staff accounting bulletin 121, which sets accounting standards for firms that custody cryptocurrency. This decision follows a similar vote in the House, but the latest resolution is expected to be vetoed by President Joe Biden. SAB 121, introduced in 2022, mandates that firms holding crypto must list customer holdings as liabilities. Critics argue that this rule could hinder banks from managing digital assets. The White House maintains that rescinding the bulletin would destabilize financial markets, the blockchain association wrote on the threat of a presidential veto denies the fact that there is a growing awareness among the voting public, particularly young people, that crypto is something our elected officials should care about.
00:34:43.650 - 00:35:52.564, Speaker D: President Biden's veto would require a two thirds majority in both chambers to be overridden, a challenging feat given the current vote counts. Wisconsin makes historic bitcoin ETF investment the state of Wisconsin Investment Board has made a groundbreaking purchase of nearly $100 million worth of Blackrock spot bitcoin ETF in the first quarter of the year. This acquisition of 94,562 shares marks the first instance of a state level institution publicly declaring such a significant investment in bitcoin ETF's.
