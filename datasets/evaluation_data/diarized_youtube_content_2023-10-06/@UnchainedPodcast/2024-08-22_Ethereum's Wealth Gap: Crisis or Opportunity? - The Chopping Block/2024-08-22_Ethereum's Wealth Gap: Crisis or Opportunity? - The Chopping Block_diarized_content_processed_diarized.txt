00:00:00.560 - 00:00:24.885, Speaker A: I'd say it is more like Ethereum is the United States. Because ethereum still has $60 billion of TVL, has way more capital than any other chain has. In terms of the dollar amount of economic activity on Ethereum, it is still bigger. Now that doesn't necessarily mean that there's more users. There's obviously fewer users, but those users are very, very wealthy. Right? The US has 4% of the world population. There's not a lot of Americans in the world.
00:00:24.885 - 00:00:55.005, Speaker A: But the overwhelming just mass of wealth in the US is so big that's concentrated in a relatively small number of people. That feels more appropriate to me. That's not dc, right? DC is a decision making apparatus for the us, right? It's like the brain essentially, or the brainstem that connects up to this gigantic body. That's not Ethereum. Ethereum doesn't make decisions for the L2s and it has no governance control. Right. If anything, OP is DC for the ones that are part of the super chain.
00:00:55.705 - 00:01:01.193, Speaker B: So Ethereum has Dutch disease, but for Ether, it's just not a dividend.
00:01:01.289 - 00:01:02.481, Speaker C: It's a tale of two quant.
00:01:02.553 - 00:01:05.169, Speaker A: Now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet.
00:01:05.257 - 00:01:07.729, Speaker B: Generally speaking, airdrops are kind of pointless anyways.
00:01:07.897 - 00:01:10.593, Speaker A: Unnamed trading firms who are very involved.
00:01:10.689 - 00:01:13.721, Speaker C: Alec Eth is the ultimate defi protocols.
00:01:13.753 - 00:01:15.885, Speaker D: Are the antidote to this problem.
00:01:17.795 - 00:01:27.723, Speaker A: Hello everybody. Welcome to the chopping block. Every couple weeks the four of us get together and give the industry insiders perspective on the crypto topics of the day. So quick intros. First we got Tom, the defi maven and master of memes.
00:01:27.899 - 00:01:28.935, Speaker B: Hello everyone.
00:01:29.875 - 00:01:38.935, Speaker A: Next we've got Robert the crypto connoisseur and czar of superstate GM everybody. And we've got Tarun, the Giga brain and Grand Poobah at Gauntlet.
00:01:39.315 - 00:01:40.135, Speaker C: Yo.
00:01:40.995 - 00:01:58.875, Speaker A: And finally I'm Haseeb, the head hype man at Dragonfly. We are early stage investors in crypto. But I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice, legal advice or even life advice. Please see Chopping Block XYZ for more disclosures. So I think it's been relatively quiet week for once. We've got nothing that much going on. There's a lot of political pageantry.
00:01:58.875 - 00:02:36.605, Speaker A: DNC is happening at the Democratic National Convention. So there's a lot of just, you know, kind of trotting out the Democratic ticket and the crypto otherwise has been pretty muted. Doesn't feel like there's been a lot of big moves lately and we're kind of in a low volatility period. Now, one of the things that has been getting people more excited these days has been the increasing focus on prediction markets. And Poly Market in particular, of course being the biggest one of them. We're seeing more and more news coverage that involves mentioning Poly Market as a primary venue on which to look at the real time prices of these things. We just said they were on cnbc.
00:02:36.605 - 00:03:18.751, Speaker A: They were, they were mentioned people talking about, oh, you should look at Poly Market. It's like the biggest market for betting. And it seems like maybe they're, they're ahead of the curve on some of these things. And on Twitter you see a lot of conversation about the fact that most of the models. So if you look at, for example, Nate, Nate Silver, who is the very well known modelist for, for the polls, he right now has the race in pretty close to a dead heat. But he has Kamala having a slight advantage over Trump. And a polymarket also reflected that there was roughly a call it 53 to 47 kind of margin between Trump and Harris that has now flipped for the first time in a while.
00:03:18.751 - 00:03:43.427, Speaker A: Trump now has a slight advantage over Kamala and this has now for whatever reason, Twitter is freaking out like crazy over very small changes in margin like who's slightly ahead. It's like, oh, Trump's going to win because now he's 51 and 49 instead of know 49, 51 the other way. I don't know why people care this much, but there's just a lot of testosterone it seems like is riding on who is slightly ahead in the polls.
00:03:43.531 - 00:04:08.155, Speaker D: Yeah, I think it's because people, and I think you're guilty of this just now confuse polls and a prediction market. Odds of winning an election. Polls are generally razor thin. Right. If you look at like general election polls of what is going to be the popular vote, it's never really going to deviate beyond roughly 50. 50. So if it was 55, 45, the race would be completely over.
00:04:08.155 - 00:04:37.297, Speaker D: A prediction market is a forecast of the outcome of an election and can swing wildly. 55, 45, sure. 50, 50, sure. 45, 55, sure. And I think a lot of people confuse the two. And so a lot of people are using these two things interchangeably. One is the probability of a certain outcome and the other is a whole of a very evenly divided United States of America with two parties that are of equal size that generally are 50, 50.
00:04:37.297 - 00:05:11.315, Speaker D: And so I think there's a little bit of confusion there at the root of why people are like overreacting to a poly market market going from like 48, 52 to 50. 50. Right. Assuming that this means there's been a major shift in national sentiment, when in reality it could be a microscopic shift in polling or platform or reactions or just the flow of technical funds of more sellers than buyers or more buyers and sellers or whatever. So I think there's confusion as to why people overemphasize prediction markets.
00:05:11.775 - 00:05:36.693, Speaker A: Well, the other thing, I think prediction markets, by their nature, they incorporate more factors than some of these static models. So I think one of the things that's been driving Trump's outperformance in the prediction markets in the last couple of days has been increasing reports that RFK is going to drop out. And like, there is. So if you look at the prediction market for RFK dropping out, you can actually kind of measure this in real time because the prediction market for RFK dropping out is now at like 65%. 70.
00:05:36.801 - 00:05:38.897, Speaker D: Before it was 70.
00:05:39.001 - 00:05:40.281, Speaker A: Okay. As of this show.
00:05:40.393 - 00:05:45.165, Speaker C: Well, because, because Nicole Shanahan went and said like, hey, we might drop out also.
00:05:45.905 - 00:05:47.369, Speaker A: Okay, well, that's, that's pretty good.
00:05:47.457 - 00:05:53.165, Speaker B: And also there's a rumor that he's also going to endorse Trump. I think that's also part of, or one of one of the markets for it.
00:05:53.265 - 00:06:24.415, Speaker C: That was something she also. Pulling away. She also said. Yeah, something she also said. So I feel, I feel like that, that killed me, the market. One other thing I think that's worth pointing out. When you mentioned the crypto Twitter thing, I think there's kind of this non monotone effect for gamblers where, you know, if I, if I ask a gambler, I give you a roulette wheel where you have a 20% chance of winning versus 80% chance of winning.
00:06:24.415 - 00:07:00.151, Speaker C: Which one do you. They'll say 80. But if I ask them if they want something that's 47% or 49%, they may actually say 47 because they like the variance more versus being very close to. There's a very weird psychological effect. So there's a funny study that people have done on roulette wheels of choosing the correct number of whatever. I don't know what the name of the socket is in a roulette board wheel. And then they did a bunch of these like behavioral economics things where they like got a bunch of gamblers and non gamblers to play roulette.
00:07:00.151 - 00:07:10.983, Speaker C: And then like they found very distinctive differences near 50%. And I feel like crypto Twitter is all gamblers. So they're like, you know, they're susceptible to the size.
00:07:11.039 - 00:07:14.955, Speaker A: It sounds like a very overreaching conclusion from a study that probably.
00:07:15.375 - 00:07:28.903, Speaker C: I just think you're pointing this asymmetry right, where they're like 5347, comma, oh, polymarket is wrong. Like, everything is broken. 5149. Trump. Everything is great. Like, bet it all on the house. You know, like that.
00:07:28.903 - 00:07:32.515, Speaker C: It has that flavor of these old behavioral economics things.
00:07:33.535 - 00:07:58.736, Speaker A: I think it's more that people do not understand probabilities. Right? So, like, they think that 53:47 is like, oh, Trump's going to win. It'd be weird if he didn't win. Like, even, you know, the famous. The Hillary vs Trump election, when, you know, Nate Silver gave the odds for Trump to win at 30%. And people now still hound Nate Silver over the fact that he, you know, oh, I can't believe that Trump was. Yeah, 30%.
00:07:58.736 - 00:08:03.425, Speaker A: Things happen 30% of the time. It's extremely common for 30% events to happen.
00:08:04.165 - 00:08:23.501, Speaker C: One other thing is, is Nate Silver, actually, since you brought him up, his new. You know, I was maybe. I feel like 2020 to 2022. Nate Silver is a little insufferable, but his 2024 self, I think he. Or 23, end of 23, I guess now that he's. He's. He's embraced the gamblers.
00:08:23.501 - 00:08:34.253, Speaker C: Is. Is. Is really good. So he has this. This. This book, I forget what it's called, has a green cover that has the. That basically divides people into two camps.
00:08:34.253 - 00:08:45.903, Speaker C: And there's a little profile of SBF in there also, which is. There's the. The river, which is like, people who. The river. Yeah. Who are the gamblers. And then the Village, which is like the.
00:08:45.903 - 00:09:29.731, Speaker C: Like, I went to Harvard and got an MBA and I could work in government, whatever. Like, I go to Supreme Court. And the idea that the interface between the two of them is, you know, one of them believes only the polls and, like, is only focused on, like, exact features, which is the Village. And then the river is like, the only thing that matters is the ability to continue gambling. And I feel like his framework for this does really feel like it. It feels a lot like this whole discussion of the poly market versus kind of polling like, like, like almost to the. Like, I feel like he's had the lived experience of starting in the Village and then, like, you know, and being on the pole side and then kind of like finding his way downriver.
00:09:29.731 - 00:09:30.579, Speaker C: Literally.
00:09:30.747 - 00:09:58.459, Speaker A: Yeah. So the Village is people who, like, defer to authority. They want to see very Legible mechanisms that give them a worldview and kind of inform their perspective. Whereas the river sounds like they're the gamblers, they're the business people, they're the folks who are kind of out there and they're much more willing to rely on markets and uncertainty and probability. Is that, is that a good description of the framework? Okay, so I mean there's, there's a.
00:09:58.467 - 00:10:16.965, Speaker C: Little more, there's a little more to it in that like the river has this idea. There is a nihilism aspect. Like when we talk about financial nihilism. There's sense in which the river's view is that it's very myopic. Like it's like a one shot game, like, oh, okay, I gotta bet it all now and if it doesn't work, it doesn't work.
00:10:17.045 - 00:10:22.945, Speaker A: Right. So the river is not just thinking probabilistically, they're also kind of degenerate a little bit.
00:10:23.445 - 00:10:32.347, Speaker C: They believe in their ability to manage their own risk at all times. So whereas the village is like, no, no, no, we must follow the rules, you know, like if that makes sense.
00:10:32.371 - 00:10:38.563, Speaker A: Like, okay, so there's journalism kind of axis here as well between the two. I see.
00:10:38.739 - 00:10:48.615, Speaker C: Yeah. And I think he makes, he also makes a juxtaposition between like VC versus private equity, where private equity is kind of the village and VC is more of the river.
00:10:49.475 - 00:10:50.775, Speaker A: But really, why?
00:10:51.515 - 00:11:04.205, Speaker C: Well, because I guess in the sense like private equity is everything about modeling out everything. Like, oh, I need a particular cap rate in IRR for me to even make an investment versus VC is like vibes based risk taking.
00:11:05.945 - 00:11:07.513, Speaker D: I agree with the analogy.
00:11:07.689 - 00:11:16.145, Speaker C: No, I think it's a good book. My point is, a lot of the discussion we were having reminds me just of the. I'm still reading it, but it's great.
00:11:16.265 - 00:11:58.159, Speaker B: I mean there's also obviously this. My, my intuition is basically, you know, people in crypto, people are trading on Poly Market skew more right wing, they're mostly more young men. And obviously crypto has sort of this right wing element right now. And so I think, you know, I want to sort of have this vision that, yes, like, you know, the Poly Market traders are pure capitalists, market minded, always correct. But in reality it's like, okay, when Trump's winning on Poly Market, yes, we should listen to Poly Market. And that's always correct and the polls are wrong. And then like Trump was going down a week or two ago and they're like, oh, well, the Democrats are manipulating Poly Market to create news cycles.
00:11:58.159 - 00:12:16.735, Speaker B: The whole thread about it Is like, isn't that the whole point of the prediction market that you can place money? Like, if you think, you know, Trump is underpricing, you should be buying more Trump. And so it's like, I don't know, a little bit of, I think also just this, maybe just more human nature of people want to be with their tribe and have, have it reflect with their own beliefs.
00:12:16.815 - 00:12:38.561, Speaker A: Yeah. I find this juxtaposition interesting. It also, of course, it. Anytime somebody writes a book that says, okay, there are two types of people, obviously, it's like, one type is better than the other type. And, like, you should want to be the river type, which I, I'm very clearly part of the river. But it, I don't think he's written.
00:12:38.673 - 00:12:44.329, Speaker C: I don't think he's written it like that, though, because he's, he started in the village, and then he just kind of went to the river and then he came.
00:12:44.377 - 00:12:47.045, Speaker A: So it's like his own personal transformation is realized.
00:12:48.265 - 00:12:56.095, Speaker C: I think that's actually, at least you get the dialectic. It's not just like, oh, this is good, this is evil. Like, you know, I, I feel like, Right, right, right.
00:12:56.135 - 00:13:02.335, Speaker A: One, one, one evolves from the village to become part of the river and go. To take more risk and then maybe.
00:13:02.375 - 00:13:04.983, Speaker C: Go backwards because it's too crazy. Yeah.
00:13:04.999 - 00:13:09.155, Speaker D: I was thinking people go from the river to the village when they retire.
00:13:09.455 - 00:13:14.503, Speaker C: You know, I, I, I, I, I'm not, I still have to read more of the book, so I, I haven't, I haven't finished it. So.
00:13:14.639 - 00:13:17.279, Speaker D: Okay, finish the book. Next week on the chopping block, we.
00:13:17.287 - 00:13:20.207, Speaker C: Will revisit book club. Chopping block Book club. We're gonna.
00:13:20.231 - 00:13:40.449, Speaker A: This is a good idea. So, so let me, let me, let me maybe bring this framework in and see if we can bring, you know, sort of superimpose this onto crypto, I guess there are elements of crypto that are more village and that are more river. Right. So, like, pump fun, pure river. Pure river. Something like coinbase Village. Right.
00:13:40.449 - 00:13:44.485, Speaker A: CS village. Yeah. Is it. What, what makes it halfway?
00:13:45.265 - 00:13:53.019, Speaker D: I mean, I feel like. And again, there's a spectrum here, so maybe it's like three quarters of the way to village, you know, 25%.
00:13:53.067 - 00:13:55.535, Speaker A: All right, so fine. So super state is like, full village.
00:13:56.035 - 00:13:57.779, Speaker D: Yeah, it's very villagey.
00:13:57.947 - 00:14:40.195, Speaker A: Okay. Very villagey. And I guess maybe this is one way to articulate the two different forces that are pulling crypto in different directions. Right. One force is, hey, let's embrace the kind of full, you know, be your own bank Fully libertarian vision of, you know, caveat, EMP tour, everybody just be out there for yourself and try to make things work with full self custody. And then there's the other vision which is oh, let's like bring crypto into the financial system, let's make it more legible, let's make it more regulated, let's make it safer for people to use, let's put it in these nice easy to understand structures. So it, I, I guess this is one way that you can conceive of these things.
00:14:40.195 - 00:15:07.585, Speaker A: But it does feel to me like again it's kind of collapsing a lot of different dimensions into one framework, which I guess any framework does that. But I guess the question I have that maybe we can answer next week once you read the actual book is what is his claim that okay, given that you have this framework, here's how you should treat these two tribes differently or here's how you should navigate between those two tribes. Thanks. You don't know the answer to that.
00:15:07.885 - 00:15:34.905, Speaker C: I, yeah, I, not until next. Yeah, I, like I'm, I'm kind of still early. I, I just, I, I just the reason I brought it up is like it just feels very relevant to as like a framework for thinking about this precise polymarketverse poll thing. Cause it really feels like, and like it's coming from this person who started on the poll side and then kind of moved and around between the two and I, I feel like it, it's clearly the right thing. Like it's like the right thing for the zeitgeist right now.
00:15:35.305 - 00:15:45.857, Speaker A: So. Okay, so interesting. We've also seen the launch of a lot of folks trying to create new prediction markets in response to polychain into Poly Market. I keep calling it polychrome.
00:15:45.961 - 00:15:48.565, Speaker D: You know, there's too many things that start with the world.
00:15:49.505 - 00:15:53.365, Speaker C: Olaf, all I have to tell you is you gave Haseeb the best brainworm ever.
00:15:53.785 - 00:16:39.881, Speaker A: Olaf's getting a lot of free marketing on the show, I'll tell him that much. Anyway, so one example is Drift market. Drift market created a drift market Drift protocol created a prediction market called BET. They currently have about, I guess $300,000 live on the US prediction market. We've got a bunch of other ones that I know of that are just, you know, different people trying to launch this thing and get it live. We talked last time about some experimentation about trying to create for example, more capital efficient prediction market such that the money that's being bet can be put into tokenized treasuries or can sometimes, you know, get yield to ameliorate some of the opportunity costs of that capital. Anything else you guys are seeing in terms of innovations or new ideas that people are trying in some of these newer prediction markets.
00:16:39.993 - 00:17:23.151, Speaker D: Here's the one thing I'll say, and I will pre disclose, that we are investors in Drift and Poly Market, and we'll probably be investors in more prediction market platforms in the future. Right. I think liquidity is incredibly hard to get when it comes to prediction markets. And the difference between a prediction market with a lot of liquidity and a prediction market with medium or low liquidity is night and day. And I think one of the reasons why Polymarket so far has been successful is that it's liquid enough for people to take it seriously as a tool for observing reality. And I don't think you can have 10 winners here. I really don't.
00:17:23.151 - 00:17:54.015, Speaker D: I think at the end of the day, liquidity will centralize onto whichever platform wins. And I don't think there's room for 10 prediction markets unless one of them is hyper niche, where it's like, oh, it's a science prediction market or something, or Hollywood prediction market. I think in general, it's going to be really hard for new entrants. Um, and, you know, I think that goes to some of the success that Polychain has had, which is they want Polymarket.
00:17:54.395 - 00:17:55.615, Speaker A: Polymarket.
00:17:56.435 - 00:17:59.171, Speaker D: See, I. I've never made that mistake. It's only because we're talking.
00:17:59.203 - 00:18:03.107, Speaker A: Yeah, I. They're very close.
00:18:03.251 - 00:18:15.019, Speaker C: Olaf, you've created the greatest name ever. That's. That's all I got to tell you in crypto, I feel like people miss a Polychain for anything that has Poly in front, no matter what it is all the time. Polyhedron, Polymath.
00:18:15.107 - 00:18:16.251, Speaker B: It was like Polybase.
00:18:16.403 - 00:18:16.931, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:18:17.043 - 00:18:20.975, Speaker D: Pollyanna the other year, you know, And I called it a Polychain.
00:18:21.995 - 00:18:22.827, Speaker C: There you go.
00:18:22.931 - 00:18:24.947, Speaker A: Polycule. Polycule, yeah.
00:18:24.971 - 00:18:26.723, Speaker D: SPF was going to the Polychain.
00:18:26.819 - 00:18:28.699, Speaker A: That's a tough one. That's a tough one.
00:18:28.867 - 00:18:32.099, Speaker C: But. But any. Anyway, sorry not to interrupt. That was funny.
00:18:32.147 - 00:18:32.283, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:18:32.299 - 00:18:52.753, Speaker D: Not to get distracted, but, you know, I think it demonstrates a lot of, like, the hard work that's gone into Poly Market to actually build liquidity. Because, like, the reason why it's exciting and it's getting talked about is because this is the first election cycle that there's real size betting on these markets. In prior cycles, it was like $19,000 on intraday.
00:18:52.809 - 00:18:53.529, Speaker A: Like, who cares?
00:18:53.577 - 00:19:22.295, Speaker D: Like, it's not relevant. Like, it's too illiquid, it's too manipulatable. Maybe it's completely accurate and does reflect the honest odds, but like it was of insignificant size. And so I think Poly Market has been the first to succeed and I don't think there's room for a lot of competitive prediction markets that fragment liquidity. There's not that many people who are speculating on this stuff. In general you can bring incentives, but.
00:19:22.635 - 00:20:01.097, Speaker C: I mainly agree with that. I think the drift market is kind of interesting because especially at a time where like there's a lot of capital outflows from Meme Coins that is on chain already a natural place for that capital to go without going across a bridge. And especially because some of these users are like, well Phantom is. I traded Meme Coins on Phantom, right? Like they don't even view Solana as the place they're trading. They're like the wallet is the, is the thing they're trading on and having something native for that. I actually think there's a ton of reasons that liquidity might not have migrated. So it makes a ton of sense in that case, especially because it's.
00:20:01.097 - 00:20:21.329, Speaker C: You already have a product that's live and has liquidity. I think bootstrapping from nothing is really hard. I think someone who already has another product that offers some sort of differentiated way user base yield and liquidity can attract a different area. And I think that's like the only nuance I'd add is like yeah, I.
00:20:21.337 - 00:20:29.593, Speaker B: Believe the FTX election market was bigger than poly market in 2020. Right. Because they also had a US election perps market.
00:20:29.649 - 00:20:34.977, Speaker C: Do you remember that Trump win resolved positively though in 2020 for a tiny.
00:20:35.001 - 00:20:36.145, Speaker B: Bit of time on FTX.
00:20:36.265 - 00:20:47.393, Speaker C: Oh really? There was like, there was like one of these crazy, crazy bugs where they like they resolved it incorrectly first. And so I'm trying to break remember.
00:20:47.449 - 00:20:50.685, Speaker A: This was bigger than Polymarket in by what metric?
00:20:51.905 - 00:20:55.125, Speaker B: I'm guessing open interest. I saw this cited recently.
00:20:57.105 - 00:21:01.281, Speaker A: I did not remember this. Maybe I just. Memory hold that. That's crazy.
00:21:01.313 - 00:21:30.295, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, there was also like, there was like a bunch of problems with how the market resolved too. Which I, you know, I guess in hindsight you can just be like, oh, Alameda fucked over people or something. But there was like there in fact actually I think when, when FTX and Alameda went bankrupt, one of the main things on the balance sheet was like the Trump lose token. So they somehow like did not kind of resolve the market. So I'm not sure the volume there was totally organic. Also there's like those numbers could have been.
00:21:30.335 - 00:21:34.495, Speaker A: Wait, wait, hold on. Hold on, what does that mean? Yeah, they had the trump loose token.
00:21:34.535 - 00:21:44.463, Speaker C: Was. Should have own it should. They should have just resolved and converted to stable coins. Right. But for some reason they didn't. It's like it was in the, you.
00:21:44.479 - 00:21:48.687, Speaker D: Know, it was in the mislabeled cash account. Negative $8 billion.
00:21:48.791 - 00:21:49.895, Speaker C: Yeah, it, it, it was.
00:21:49.935 - 00:21:54.355, Speaker A: So, so, but this is like a claim against themselves that they have on their b.
00:21:55.255 - 00:22:01.455, Speaker C: But they, I guess they're counting it as an asset. I don't know. There was some sort of bizarro accounting going up.
00:22:01.495 - 00:22:04.231, Speaker A: How does that even work? That's insane.
00:22:04.383 - 00:22:15.235, Speaker C: I guess my main point is I don't know how much I would trust those volume numbers, whereas I feel almost 100% certainty in the poly market numbers. So I don't know how much I want to compare that.
00:22:16.735 - 00:22:42.545, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah, all right. I guess when you have coked up accountant or like coked up interns doing your accounting, it's probably not necessarily the best way to do apples to apples comparison, but. Okay. All right. So another story that I think is increasingly interesting. You're kind of looking at a little bit of what's happening in the, the meme coin ecosystem and the rise of Solana.
00:22:42.545 - 00:23:17.327, Speaker A: That's really been one of the big stories this year. On the other side, of course, you have Ethereum. Ethereum has been kind of languishing. Price has not been super strong. Despite the launch of the Ethereum etf. Many folks in the Ethereum ecosystem are now soul searching a little bit and trying to think about, hey, what are we doing wrong? That Ethereum is not doing as well as we might have imagined it would in the light of being the second ETF to launch. And so there's been kind of a tide shift within Ethereum that more and more people are talking about Ethereum L1 optimizations, meaning that they're thinking about how can we improve the underlying base chain itself.
00:23:17.327 - 00:23:58.575, Speaker A: Where before last year most of the conversation was about how do we optimize the L2s and move a lot of the focus away from Ethereum layer 1. So just some kind of interesting notes in this conversation. One is that increasingly we've seen since the rise since the launch of Denkun on chain, fees are very low. We've also of course seen the DA or the data availability fees have also become very, very low. So L2s are not paying that much in fees anymore. So the overall fee spend on Ethereum is very, very low. We've seen Solana massively outpacing Ethereum fees Lately, in large part because of all of the pump fun meme coin volume that's been driving a huge amount of demand there.
00:23:58.575 - 00:24:42.795, Speaker A: It seems like a lot of this has been a response really to Solana. So there's talk now about pre confirmations, which would basically give users the ability to know very quickly whether or not their transactions are getting included. Talk about of course increasing the gas limit, so allowing more throughput, potentially lowering the block times, as well as even going so far as to this multi proposer thing that allows you to have multiple leaders at the same time being able to include transactions simultaneously. So it feels like all of a sudden this conversation has gotten very vibrant where before it didn't really seem like people were seriously considering doing a lot of alterations to the Ethereum roadmap. How do you guys interpret this moment? How realistic do you think any of these changes are and which of them are you excited about, if any?
00:24:44.015 - 00:26:12.073, Speaker C: So I think an interesting, yeah, I would say certainly a lot of it comes from Solana. I think certainly people are spending a lot of time analyzing usage of the L1 and obviously looking at the base fee. Even if you don't see anything else, it's obviously clear that the Blob market kind of cannibalized the main market. You can argue that that's sort of a good thing in the long run in that hey, Ethereum proposers aren't taking away all of the application revenue, which was sort of the dream of this type of stuff. But it does also just mean that there's sort of Ethereum, the asset has sort of, it can be viewed very differently in terms of like long term accrual. I think the interesting thing is there was a lot of denial I feel like about maybe like six months ago about the idea that hey, maybe we still need to make L1 updates and not just updates to off chain infrastructure around the L1, so meaning MEV auctions and things of that nature. And in fact there were a lot of things that were, you know, I think when Eigenlayer actually first started, one of the ways Sriram, the founder of Eigenlayer would describe it is hey, it's a way to test out adaptations to the L1 via restaking applications and then once you get them mature and they work, you can upstream them into the protocol.
00:26:12.073 - 00:27:08.465, Speaker C: Right? Like things like dank sharding, things like these kind of complicated operations. The idea is like you would be able to test on three staking with a smaller validator set, but still using sort of mainnet stake and then eventually you could upstream them. So there was already kind of this thing of like, hey, Maybe we, maybe L1 changes are hard, we should move them, we should do them kind of slightly away, somewhere in between a testnet and the real thing first before they're upstreamed. And then I think there was kind of this, I don't know how else to put it then like attention siphoning that happened from the L1s, L2s, sorry, where everything moved to the L2s and then it really just became this kind of thing of like, hey, more chains means more utility, right? And so far we haven't quite seen that. Right. Like the end user is probably not getting more utility for more chains unless they're an intent solver or MEV searcher. Like in some ways they're the biggest beneficiaries.
00:27:08.465 - 00:27:13.381, Speaker C: But you know, before you go on.
00:27:13.413 - 00:27:27.611, Speaker A: Let me ask you this. Do you think Ethereum made a mistake in pursuing dank sharding and cordoning off blob storage to be separate from the main execution engine? You think that was a mistake?
00:27:27.763 - 00:28:15.181, Speaker C: I don't think it was a mistake for Ethereum, the technology as a technology, I think it actually did need to separate and move to multidimensional resources. That's true for Solana too. Having to change how the fee markets work based on resource usage, having to kind of change what the relative read and write fees are, things like that. That's kind of common to both of them. I think the main thing is that a lot of the Benefits of the L2 roadmap only really make sense when you have good interoperability. Otherwise you're just kind of like on the one isolated chain forever. And if it doesn't have all the features of mainnet or all the assets of mainnet, then you know, you have to somehow move.
00:28:15.181 - 00:29:51.907, Speaker C: And I think this realization that shared sequencing is actually quite difficult or like has a lot of extra overhead that might not get you all the way to, you know, Solana level ux as well as the realization that hey, if we actually made blocks faster or had multiple proposers, we are able to offer sort of more native interop where you know, like the roll ups could, you know, the valid, you know, the whole base roll up movement is built around the idea that the validators themselves provide Interop. That's like sort of the 10,000 foot version. Now please don't assail me anyone who is fighting in Ether research about the definitions but you know, I just, I'm trying to make a user friendly definition and on the other hand, you have a lot of people who are like, we're going to build our own custom interop between our roll up stack, you know, like the OP stack has their own interop arbitrum roll ups have their own interop. And there's just so much, there's almost this abundance of choice aspect that is like not only hard for users but just like hard for developers to figure out where to point their, you know, where they should spend time. And I think improving the L1 does decrease that overhead, which is sort of where we are right now. I just think it's still, you know, I think it, it's a good admission that, you know, I think, yeah, other chains have made some decisions in this direction that really benefited their usage. And you know, it's always good to see Ethereum try to play catch up.
00:29:51.907 - 00:30:37.015, Speaker C: Like the state that as someone who's been in Ethereum land for a while that I feel like you really don't want to get to is you really don't want to get to the Bitcoin development state where basically things just get voted down because there's a sclerosis to change, not because of usage or the chain itself, but because the oldest whales just don't want to change anything and the miners don't change. It's like kind of this very tragedy of the commons type of thing where the. Net beneficiaries are the oldest holders and the new users don't get any, you know, kind of share it sort of feudalism. And so I think like in order to avoid this like perpetual feudalism, you really do need to improve your base chain continually.
00:30:37.915 - 00:30:42.495, Speaker A: Tom, what's your take here and also what do you think is a likely outcome of this conversation?
00:30:42.995 - 00:31:11.433, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree with some of that. I think obviously the interop bit is part of it. I also think the landscape looked different a year ago where it felt like the number of L2s was just continually up into the right and it's like great. Well we bring down our basically per roll up revenue but we make it up on volume by having a zillion L2s. And that's how it works. And I think in practice that hasn't really worked out really. Concentration is focused on a smaller number of L2s and a lot of them are just dead in some respects.
00:31:11.433 - 00:31:51.897, Speaker B: It reminds me of the conversation around housing, where you want housing to be both an asset and something that people have to live in. And these two are conflicted where you want eth, maybe number go up because that's where your security comes from. But you also want a ton of people to be able to use eth. And the way Ethereum planned to solve this was, well, we make up fees at scale through all these L2s. And so I think the move to Blob storage was sort of necessary. Like, you kind of have to cannibalize yourself if you want this thing to be usable. But now the downside is you sort of see what happens to existing homeowners and that, well, this is no longer as attractive of an asset.
00:31:51.897 - 00:32:12.525, Speaker B: So I don't know. I think, yeah, there obviously can be some improvements made to the Core L1, but it's almost kind of more of like a vision thing of like, well, what is this going to be used for? Is it going to be used for execution? Is it going to be just for da. I think kind of splitting the baby right now feels like a weird in between, which is kind of what we're seeing.
00:32:13.755 - 00:33:02.343, Speaker A: I, I actually, I really like this analogy with real estate because, you know, very often there, there are many countries that their real estate market ends up becoming a huge part of their economy, which is usually a sign that like there's either underbuilding or overbuilding. Right. Usually that's a sign of something, something's going wrong if you're investing a huge amount of your capital into real estate. And there, there's a sort of sense in which, like, okay, that's true for Ethereum, but what, what really is the North Star for Ethereum or for any blockchain? I think it has to be some sense of gdp, of just the total amount of economic activity happening on this chain. And if you constrain the amount of block space, it's like, okay, well now housing costs are really high basically, and people are spending a lot on housing. And there, there's like some housing, there's a land tax, basically a real estate tax, and that's how the country monetizes. I don't know.
00:33:02.343 - 00:33:07.651, Speaker A: These are very obviously kind of. I've sort of brutalized some of the language here, but whatever, you'll let me get away with it.
00:33:07.783 - 00:33:12.907, Speaker C: Um, and hey, I said feudalism earlier. So we're, we're on the right path.
00:33:13.011 - 00:33:34.581, Speaker A: Sure, yeah, yeah, we're all, we're all kind of really stretching these analogies to try to capture some, the same, the same fundamental idea. Um, but it does seem like, okay, there was this housing shortage on Ethereum. There wasn't enough space for everybody. We built a separate space that, you know, it's just like super Efficient. And everybody's kind of in these skyscrapers that are just packed to the brim with people. And now that is massively lower cost. That's great.
00:33:34.581 - 00:34:23.061, Speaker A: Now there's a shortage in tax revenue for Ethereum and everybody's now hemming and hawing and saying, oh my God, what's gone wrong? And in a sense, this is the perfect response, which is, we gotta increase demand, we gotta make more people want to live here, right? Like, oh, we're not making it up on the real estate taxes anymore. So we could either one, introduce new taxes, which is not really super possible for something like Ethereum. I mean, I guess you could just increase the price of opcodes, but that's kind of gross as a way to try to solve this problem. And so the much better way is like, oh, we just got to make more people want to do stuff, not necessarily to live here, but to do stuff in Ethereum. And that feels to me like, yes, that is the correct response to this problem. Not to sort of go back and say, aha, we've made a mistake, we should like go back and try to restrict the housing supply again.
00:34:23.173 - 00:34:34.267, Speaker D: Yeah, I agree with Haseeb. Like, the goal for any platform should be to get as much activity on top of the platform as possible and nothing else matters, right?
00:34:34.371 - 00:35:13.246, Speaker A: So now my trepidation here, and we've had this conversation before, is that I don't know that Ethereum will do any of these things, right? These are all great conversations and obviously everybody loves arguing about it on Twitter. But the Ethereum foundation, or not the foundation, let's say the Ethereum Protocol's reputation for actually shipping big upgrades is so bad and they're so slow and so late and so just like everything gets. Decisions get made by committee. And these are, these are. Some of these, some of these upgrades are just massive decisions. Some of them are relatively straightforward of, you know, increase the block time or decrease the block time or, you know, change the gas limit. Those sound great.
00:35:13.246 - 00:35:23.095, Speaker A: Yeah, those can be done, you know, in a weekend if the political will is there. But some of these other ones sound, you know, very unlikely to happen from my perspective.
00:35:23.635 - 00:36:28.345, Speaker C: I think, like, there's something you have to admire about Ethereum, though, in one way, which is in a normal company you would not like, you know, imagine if aws, you know, when AWS started, right? Like, there are all these companies that built on it, a lot of those companies that built on it, built all these features that were like, we're a database built on top of aws. And Next week they are like here's redshift on aws. You don't need to use these companies that built on top of us where they like, you know, the platform cannibalize the customer and there's something admirable or different in some ways of like the opposite happening where the customer is sort of cannibalizing the platform, which is the customer. Here is the L2S. If you, if you follow the, if you believe in the kind of view that like hey, the value of Ethereum Mainet is to be da data availability for the roll ups or to be coordination cost for the roll ups. There's sort of this sense in which it did do the opposite of cloud computing. It's just that there is still a sense in which Amazon that, that, that analogy again, these are all strained analogies.
00:36:28.345 - 00:37:06.749, Speaker C: So I know I'm going to get pilloried on Twitter already just from making them, so I'm disclaiming that. But like, you know, Amazon's biggest issue wasn't actually necessarily competing with the users of Amazon. The biggest issue over time was that like they had to compete with Azure and from Microsoft and Google and whatever and their market share went down. Right. And I think that's sort of the argument for why the L1 should improve because it needs to compete with the equivalent opposition, so to speak. Right. And I think the cloud computing wars are like kind of give you an idea of how to think about those.
00:37:06.749 - 00:37:52.685, Speaker C: Especially when you think of like the idea that decentralization and censorship resistance are features that people are differentiating themselves on, on the spectrum. But UX is still potentially the most important feature and somehow like, you know, you're always kind of juggling those three and in kind of different proportions. And I think the Ethereum community has made certain decisions and you know, I hope that they continue to not be like Bitcoin where they're willing to eat their crow. Right. Like the fact that the sharding roadmap went away despite it being like touted for years. I think like it's a sign that at least there's some maturity that people can eventually change. Now the question is will they change fast enough? And that's, that's to Haseeb's point, not, not obvious.
00:37:53.065 - 00:38:01.639, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean why do you say that that's a sign of maturity? That seems to me more like a sign of sclerotic kind of like things are just too broken over there.
00:38:01.777 - 00:38:24.883, Speaker C: Well, no, no, I, look, I said it's eventually consistent. I didn't say it was Inconsistent, you know, like they eventually found the right answer. But the timescales are the relevant part when you have platform competition, if you think about it like cloud computing. Right. So you always have to juggle a lot of different metaphors in your head. I feel like when reasoning about this industry, like you have to have these economic metaphors of countries and nation states and whatever.
00:38:24.939 - 00:38:26.019, Speaker A: Yeah, well, there's also.
00:38:26.067 - 00:38:27.655, Speaker C: And then you also have to juggle these.
00:38:28.665 - 00:39:20.930, Speaker A: Yeah. There's also the Khalsamani argument that analogies are evil and they will force you to think stupidly and make bad decisions. And this also comes back to an age old debate within crypto that we've also talked about on the show, which Kalsamani also very much believes in, which is, are L2s cannibalistic to Ethereum? It does feel like now there is an increasing sense of dread within the Ethereum ecosystem that maybe actually it was true that the roll ups were cannibalistic. Maybe not in an obvious way or in the way that people were initially anticipating, but in that they sort of fragment the UX and create this. They just, they sort of created a trap that Ethereum kind of walked into. I, you know, I, I've always been skeptical of this story. I do think that at the end of the day, anything that you do that, you know, it's L2S, I sort of think of as like these almost vassal states that, you know, if there's another country out there that's using the U.S.
00:39:20.930 - 00:39:28.355, Speaker A: dollar and is under the U.S. sort of influence, both politically and economically, then ultimately it's good for the us.
00:39:29.255 - 00:39:31.591, Speaker C: But wait, can I, Can I. There is a question.
00:39:31.783 - 00:39:32.951, Speaker A: Yeah, go for it.
00:39:33.143 - 00:39:53.409, Speaker C: So like, you know, I've seen people actually debate this, the notion you're saying on Twitter, and I'm kind of curious what you think about the opposite side, which is the L2s are the US states and Ethereum is DC or like, you know, versus like. Oh, the L2s are like a country that's using the dollar. You know, like, I don't, I don't know how to think about the delineation.
00:39:53.577 - 00:40:19.329, Speaker D: I think of it as like countries using the dollar because they can stop using the dollar if they want to. Right. Like in a lot of cases they're using it because it's mutually beneficial. It's easy. It gets them into a secure and stable place right out of the gate. Right. There's so many reasons why they do it, but they don't have to stay built on Ethereum.
00:40:19.329 - 00:40:34.809, Speaker D: Right. Whether it's like in terms of their message, whether it's posting data to Ethereum for security, whether it's doing whatever, it's like they're temporarily allies and for almost all of them they're allies. And for most of them they'll stay allies in a sense, but not.
00:40:34.857 - 00:40:37.445, Speaker C: What do you think about the Texas secession movement?
00:40:37.825 - 00:40:38.833, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.
00:40:38.969 - 00:40:55.573, Speaker A: It's worth making the point. No, it's worth making the point that there's two things that tie most of these roll ups to Ethereum. Right. Which is one, they're posting onto Ethereum. They have the data availability and the bridging, but also they use Ether as the native asset. And it seems increasingly like the second factor is actually more important than the first one. Right.
00:40:55.573 - 00:41:11.893, Speaker A: It's sort of like they're using the US dollar as their currency which expands the reach and the total GDP that in which the US dollar is circulating, that seems to be more significant than obviously the DA fees that they're paying now are basically going to zero. Assuming that.
00:41:11.949 - 00:41:15.211, Speaker C: So you're saying they're Puerto Rico, you're saying they're Puerto Rican.
00:41:15.323 - 00:41:27.547, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I think that's a good way to put it. Or you know, just any other, I mean that's, that's explicitly U.S. territory. Right. But there's a bunch of other countries that use the US dollar that are fully dollarized but you know, are not explicitly under the domain of US government.
00:41:27.691 - 00:41:33.043, Speaker C: In this analogy is Solana. Singapore then is like who, what is Solana in this country?
00:41:33.099 - 00:42:16.715, Speaker A: I think Solana is an entirely other superpower. Yeah, I mean it's like, you know, it's like China that, it's the Soviet Union, China, whatever. I mean obviously these have a negative valence which I don't think is what I mean to say with respect to the eu. Let's say the eu, India, yeah, It's one of the ones that doesn't have the same level of approprium attached to it. But this question of like, okay, what is Ethereum then? Is Ethereum DC or is Ethereum the United States and these are all external countries. I'd say it is more like Ethereum is the United States because Ethereum still has whatever it is, $60 billion of TVL still has way more capital than any other chain has. In terms of the dollar amount of economic activity on Ethereum, it is still bigger.
00:42:16.715 - 00:42:48.285, Speaker A: Now that doesn't necessarily mean that there's more users, there's obviously fewer users, but those users are very, very wealthy. Right. The US has 4% of the world Population. There's not a lot of Americans in the world, but the overwhelming just mass of wealth in the US is so big that's concentrated in a relatively small number of people. That feels more appropriate to me. That's not dc, right? DC is a decision making apparatus for the us Right. It's like the brain essentially, or the brainstem that connects up to this gigantic body.
00:42:48.285 - 00:42:57.809, Speaker A: That's not Ethereum. Ethereum doesn't make decisions for the L2s and it has no governance control. Right. If anything, OP is DC for the ones that are part of the super chain.
00:42:57.897 - 00:42:58.645, Speaker D: Agreed.
00:42:59.345 - 00:43:05.161, Speaker B: So Ethereum has Dutch disease, but for Ether it's just, you know, this currency is so great.
00:43:05.193 - 00:43:06.889, Speaker C: That's kind of funny. That's funny. That's funny.
00:43:06.977 - 00:43:08.297, Speaker A: That's an interesting way to think about it.
00:43:08.321 - 00:43:10.185, Speaker C: That's interesting way to think about it.
00:43:10.645 - 00:43:14.425, Speaker A: Yeah, maybe so. Sorry Todd, do you want to define Dutch disease?
00:43:14.845 - 00:43:43.075, Speaker B: Yeah. Dutch disease is this phenomenon where a country becomes so, or a industry in a country becomes so dominant that they sort of rest on laurels, become totally, you know, dependent on this particular industry. Usually oil is very common and then obviously it sort of discourages investment in other industries. And so when you know, oil goes down or there's an issue with that, then you're kind of screwed. And so, you know, maybe there's a similar analogy with, with Ethereum.
00:43:43.235 - 00:44:18.797, Speaker A: Yeah. So maybe it, it, it has become a little bit of a resource curse for Ethereum that Ether is so valuable. That has, has led to this under investment in Ethereum itself as opposed to just the advancement of Ether as an asset. But of course the foundation doesn't really do that. I mean the, I mean foundation is weird in a lot of ways, so maybe that's not the, the relevant locus. But yeah, it's interesting. And, and I, I guess, let me, let me just real quick going around the horn, what do you think is the probability, or let me ask you this, what do you think is the most likely change that happens to Ethereum within.
00:44:18.797 - 00:44:22.941, Speaker A: Call it the next six months. Robert, what do you think is most likely change?
00:44:23.013 - 00:44:30.205, Speaker D: Oh, six, Six months is a very short time frame. Like Ethereum doesn't move in six months. Ethereum moves in three years. Right.
00:44:30.245 - 00:44:32.425, Speaker A: I think it's possible that some of these things can happen.
00:44:32.945 - 00:44:34.041, Speaker D: Okay, my wager.
00:44:34.153 - 00:44:34.921, Speaker A: Controversial.
00:44:34.993 - 00:44:36.925, Speaker D: I'm sorry, Nothing major happens.
00:44:37.265 - 00:44:39.685, Speaker A: Nothing major. Okay, Tarun, what do you say? Six months?
00:44:40.465 - 00:45:17.925, Speaker C: I think Vitalik has said a bunch of times he's much more open to faster block times and node operators are sort of more open to it. I think there's an interesting question of like, now that there's multiple clients, can you actually guarantee the same quality of service across all of them at the same latency? And I. Sure, there's testing, a lot of testing the nuance to this, to be totally honest, but I think it's. That is the simplest thing because technically, code wise, it's a very simple change. So you know, I think if the testing is successful for that, like, like barring no change, which is obviously the highest probability event, I think the second highest is.
00:45:17.965 - 00:45:21.221, Speaker A: I think you think it's more likely that nothing changes in six months.
00:45:21.413 - 00:45:38.157, Speaker C: Six months. Okay, let's see. Where's six months post devcon? Okay. No, I think something will change by DEF con. I think there will be at least. Okay, I take it back. There's probably a gas change, like a resource pricing change or a block time change, because those are like I'm changing a parameter.
00:45:38.157 - 00:45:44.629, Speaker C: Those aren't like I'm changing the main code very much. That I believe could happen.
00:45:44.757 - 00:45:46.025, Speaker A: Tom, what would you say?
00:45:46.925 - 00:46:14.505, Speaker B: I have no idea. I mean, it seems like there's some political momentum behind mcp, but I don't think that really meaningfully changes. Kind of like the L1 experience for most people. It's kind of more like a MEV mitigation, decentralization kind of thing. So I don't know, I think, yeah, maybe you'll mess with the block time or the gas limit a little bit. But again, that doesn't I think really meaningfully change the experience of doing execution on the L1.
00:46:14.845 - 00:46:28.505, Speaker C: Oh, actually I take it back. There's one other one I was going to add, which is the withdrawal from staking directly, which is the EIP that I feel like will much more likely to get. Get through. So there's a bunch of EIPs to like allow users to exit.
00:46:29.405 - 00:46:30.581, Speaker A: That's pretty minor. I don't know.
00:46:30.613 - 00:46:32.505, Speaker C: But that's a change. You said a change.
00:46:33.165 - 00:47:37.951, Speaker A: Yeah, but like one of the changes we're talking about, not like just a change, but okay, but fine. I would say, I think it's actually quite likely that Ethereum will both increase the gas limit and decrease the block time within six months. I think. I think Ethereum is starting to really feel the pressure in a way that I think it wasn't before. And it does feel like there's this sense that we have that like the Ethereum foundation or the Ethereum Intelligentsia is like this, you know, like the Senate that just is above all worldly concerns and doesn't care about price and doesn't care about sentiment and it's just trying to build this World War three engine thing and World War three resistant engineering. And I think we are waking up a little bit to reality of. With Solana breathing down its neck, I think Ethereum is going to start just doing things that it's like, okay, yeah, this is kind of bad for home stakers and maybe this is like slightly less decentralization with respect to the total amount of, you know, node providers and clients that can operate at speed and they'll say fuck it, like let's just, let's just do it and start eroding a little bit.
00:47:37.951 - 00:47:50.367, Speaker A: I think some of this puritanical devotion to prioritizing home stakers above everything, but I guess we'll see. I guess we'll see. Let's check back in six months from now is, what is that February, like end of Feb?
00:47:50.431 - 00:47:51.647, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:47:51.671 - 00:47:59.519, Speaker A: Okay, we'll check back in end of Feb and see. Yeah, let's check back in a Feb and see if there have been any major changes that have been introduced to Ethereum.
00:47:59.647 - 00:48:02.635, Speaker D: The next chopping block case of Red Bull challenge.
00:48:03.055 - 00:48:03.631, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:48:03.743 - 00:48:05.455, Speaker A: Should we put a case of Red Bull on it?
00:48:05.535 - 00:48:06.199, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah.
00:48:06.287 - 00:48:10.847, Speaker A: Wait, do we all have different, do we all make different predictions? I guess we did. Yeah. Yeah.
00:48:11.031 - 00:48:11.903, Speaker D: I said nothing.
00:48:11.959 - 00:48:16.055, Speaker A: All right, so you said nothing. Tarun, you said, you said three things.
00:48:16.135 - 00:48:17.435, Speaker D: You said gas fees.
00:48:17.815 - 00:48:21.551, Speaker C: I said basically either gas fees or lower block time. One of the two of those.
00:48:21.663 - 00:48:25.559, Speaker A: Okay, so exclusively mutually exclusive. One of the two?
00:48:25.687 - 00:48:27.335, Speaker C: Yeah, one of the two. I don't think one of the.
00:48:27.375 - 00:48:31.135, Speaker A: You think one of the two will happen? Okay. Tom, you also seem to think nothing will happen.
00:48:31.175 - 00:48:36.251, Speaker B: Basically gas limit maybe. I mean it seems like pretty not controversial gas limit for some.
00:48:36.443 - 00:48:41.507, Speaker A: Okay. You can only. Gas limit. Okay. I think both, I think they'll both do gas limit and block time.
00:48:41.571 - 00:48:41.851, Speaker B: All right.
00:48:41.883 - 00:48:44.295, Speaker D: We have, we have a good collection of wagers.
00:48:44.595 - 00:48:50.939, Speaker A: Okay, excellent. All right, there's a case of Red Bull riding on it. We'll check back in at the end of February.
00:48:51.067 - 00:49:04.379, Speaker C: The irony is that. The irony. The irony is that this is such an unfair contest because like to everyone else there's basically zero utility whether they win or not. But to me there's zero utility if I lose, but quite a high utility if I win.
00:49:04.427 - 00:49:05.539, Speaker A: So listen to.
00:49:05.627 - 00:49:08.215, Speaker D: I will share my sugar free Red Bull with you.
00:49:09.275 - 00:49:11.483, Speaker A: Oh, that's very sweet. That's very sweet.
00:49:11.619 - 00:49:12.147, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:49:12.211 - 00:49:20.895, Speaker A: Well, it's got to be. You can't pre commit that otherwise Otherwise, that's, you know, sure. You gotta. You gotta at least give some uncertainty about where the Red Bull's going. Otherwise the bet's no fun.
00:49:21.435 - 00:49:23.451, Speaker D: Okay, well, we'll settle this in February, whenever.
00:49:23.483 - 00:49:25.935, Speaker A: Yeah, we'll see. We'll see. We'll see how it feels. If you.
00:49:26.465 - 00:49:30.969, Speaker C: We're gonna play some roulette. We're gonna play some roulette on every can. It's like.
00:49:31.097 - 00:49:33.353, Speaker A: Okay, perfect. Perfect.
00:49:33.409 - 00:49:35.245, Speaker D: 47, 49.
00:49:35.905 - 00:49:44.825, Speaker A: Nice. Nice. However, that was. Yes. With that, we got a wrap. Thanks, everybody. We'll be back next week.
