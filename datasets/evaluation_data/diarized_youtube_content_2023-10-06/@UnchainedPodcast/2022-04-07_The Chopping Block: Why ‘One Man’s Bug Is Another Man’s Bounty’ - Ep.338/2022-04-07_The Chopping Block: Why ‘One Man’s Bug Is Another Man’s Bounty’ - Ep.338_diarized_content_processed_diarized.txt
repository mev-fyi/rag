00:00:02.570 - 00:00:22.074, Speaker A: Hey, everybody. Welcome to the chopping block. Every couple weeks, the four of us get together and give the industry insiders perspective on the crypto topics of the day. So, quick intros. First we got Tom, the DeFi maven and master of memes. Next up, we've got Robert, crypto connoisseur and Captain of Compound. Third, we've got Tarun the Gigabrain and Grand Poobot Gauntlet.
00:00:22.074 - 00:00:47.654, Speaker A: He is going to be showing up in a second. And then myself, elf I'm haseeb I'm head Hype man at Dragonfly. So the four of us are early stage investors in crypto. But I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice or legal advice or even life advice. So it's been a little bit of a slow week in Crypto land, or slow couple of weeks, I would say. It seems like most of the news this week has been around hacks and things breaking, which is only the biggest.
00:00:47.702 - 00:00:50.838, Speaker B: Hack of all time. Other than that, it's been pretty chill.
00:00:51.014 - 00:00:57.726, Speaker A: That's true. That's true. It's funny how just the passage of a few days makes things seem really whatever. Yeah.
00:00:57.748 - 00:00:59.550, Speaker C: It's like years ago in crypto.
00:01:00.050 - 00:01:15.054, Speaker A: Exactly. I no longer even feel it. The night that I saw that Ronan hack took place, I was just like, oh, my God, this is the worst nightmare for anybody in the crypto industry. And then two days later, I was like, oh, never mind. No one cares.
00:01:15.182 - 00:01:18.930, Speaker C: Well, that's because you didn't have any of your own funds in the Ronan Bridge.
00:01:19.090 - 00:01:53.050, Speaker A: That is true. That is true very much by choice. I did not get my funds in the Ronan Bridge. Okay, let's maybe just go through the news. For those who are not aware, what was this? This was March 29. This is a little bit over a week ago as of the time we're recording this, that the Ronan Bridge was hacked for a little bit over $600 million worth of ether and stablecoins. So the TLDR on how this thing got hacked is that basically, the Ronin Bridge was secured by a multisig that nominally had nine addresses in the multi SIG.
00:01:53.050 - 00:02:40.074, Speaker A: However, four of those addresses were controlled by accounts owned by the Axie Infinity team or the Sky Mavis team, which is the developer of Axie Infinity. And so what ended up happening was that, reading between the lines, there was some kind of social engineering attack on some of the members who had access to the multisig at Axie Infinity. And there was also a bug from a previous program that Skymavis was running that gave them access to another one of the multisig account holders. So basically, it was effectively five of nine controlled by one party. And so when that compromise took place, they were able to sign any basically able to forge a signature, or not really even forge, just actually create a signature that allowed them to say, yes, this is a valid withdrawal. Go ahead and send this money over. The bridge.
00:02:40.074 - 00:03:24.538, Speaker A: And so using this, the attacker was able to move an enormous amount of Ether and USDC, and also supposedly this hack took place six days before the bridge was actually shut down. And although users noticed that, hey guys, there's something weird going on. What are these big giant withdrawals? The team was, no, no, it's fine, we're looking into it's, no big deal. And then later it was kind of effectively all but confirmed that, yes, this was a massive compromise. The Ether was missing and they needed to shut down the bridge and somehow remunerate the victims. So the Axio Infinity team has pledged that they are going to remunerate the victims. There was actually a big update to the game that was supposed to go live recently and that's gotten pushed back now because everyone's been hacked.
00:03:24.538 - 00:03:44.900, Speaker A: So it's a bad look for Axio Infinity. They cleaned up the multi SIG. They have more actually decentralized parties on the multi SIG at this point, but it doesn't look good. So, yeah. Tom Robert, perspectives on the largest hack in on chain history?
00:03:45.430 - 00:04:22.190, Speaker B: Yeah, I think you mentioned it and I thought it's very funny that normally something happens and I feel like within the hour all of crypto Twitter is talking about it, but this took place on the 23rd and the news kind of broke on the 29th. And crypto Cobain Kobe on Twitter noticed this and said that he took out an AXS short. But in the time between when he took out the short and when it was noticed and made popular on crypto Twitter, AXS actually went up a lot. And so he was liquidated on the short when we tried to sort of trade on the news. So markets aren't always super efficient in crypto, unfortunately.
00:04:23.010 - 00:05:21.074, Speaker C: I was disappointed by this hack. Cross chain bridges are extremely complicated. This has been the basis of a lot of the different hacks and vulnerabilities over the last year. My expectation is that as more l ones besides Ethereum become popular and more bridges exist between Ethereum and other blockchains, that the bridges are going to be the most likely place where funds get lost, simply because they oftentimes deal with more complex systems than a simple smart contract. So it took people a couple of years to get good and putting that in air quotes is never good. But skilled at hacking solidity, it was a relatively simple surface area for people to learn how to write solidity safely. A bunch of auditors learned how to check for the most common patterns of risk and over time, we started seeing basic solidity attacks go down.
00:05:21.074 - 00:05:53.806, Speaker C: MultiChain bridges are significantly more complex systems that use multiple different platforms, multiple different languages, multiple different security parameters. They blend things from centralized to decentralized. We've seen some of the biggest attacks and hacks here. I think it's going to continue to be the number one weak point for crypto ecosystems. And if you're a user. I think you want to be especially cautious about cross chain bridges until they've really stood the test of time and have an extremely indie effect.
00:05:53.988 - 00:06:44.110, Speaker A: Well, so you say that bridges keep getting hacked and Bridging is extremely hard. That's generally true, although this was not a okay, there's an enormous complexity of Bridging, and that's why they got hacked. They got hacked for the most mundane possible reason in crypto, which is that they clicked on some dumb link, they got compromised, and the quote unquote, multisig was actually basically a one of one. And this is like the most basic kind of attack in crypto for which, to my mind, there's no excuse. I would not put this in the same category as the wormhole hack or what's it called, MultiChain, what used to be polynetwork. This was the most basic failure of OpSec that you could possibly have in crypto, and also it was just handled in an incredibly amateurish way of like, deny, deny, deny, and then six days later, okay, fine, yes, we got hacked for an enormous and massive amount of money.
00:06:44.260 - 00:06:53.006, Speaker C: Well, I'll posit how many users you included, me included, before this hack knew the structure by which the funds in.
00:06:53.028 - 00:06:54.690, Speaker D: The bridge were secured.
00:06:55.350 - 00:07:00.702, Speaker A: I didn't know, but I'm not an axe player, so I had no interest in knowing.
00:07:00.846 - 00:07:03.314, Speaker C: Right? I mean, how many people do you think even asked?
00:07:03.432 - 00:07:26.274, Speaker A: Right, yes, no, granted, granted. But I think there's a view in crypto that it's the responsibility of the user to diligence all the software that they use and blah, blah, blah. Right. Forever. This has kind of been the core story about, okay, verify, don't trust everything is open source. Not everything, but most things are open source. So you should be able to figure this out yourself, read the smart contracts, blah, blah, blah.
00:07:26.274 - 00:08:00.738, Speaker A: Now, in reality, especially in the world, as crypto is going mainstream, this is a pipe dream, right? There's no way that we can expect normal users, especially the users of something like Axie Infinity, to go in and read the bridge contract and understand what the hell it's doing. And of course, even if you read the bridge contract, you don't know who the signers are on the multi sigs. They're just a bunch of addresses, right? So you don't know that they're all controlled by one party. So it is the responsibility of Skymavis to figure this shit out. And look, if you are using a multi SIG for a bridge, okay, fine, I understand. Bridges are hard. Maybe a multi SIG is a good enough stopgap in the interim, right? Like even right know, look at Stargate.
00:08:00.738 - 00:08:33.646, Speaker A: Stargate is right now signing all their Oracle reads with just a multi SIG. Getting the full decentralized nirvana vision of how to build cross chain Bridging is awesome. I'm all for it, but it's going to take a while. And I get that this was a very, very basic failure that I think there is really no good excuse for and it falls in the same category of people who get their apes hacked. That was the level of incompetence that Skymavis exhibited in this hack. So I think they deserve the appropriate that they're getting right now. It just ends up making the industry look really bad.
00:08:33.646 - 00:09:02.522, Speaker A: Really? If this was some mastermind type thing, I think the Wormhole hack is a good example of, look, this was an incredibly complex hack and it was hard to catch. Right. It was a genuine edge case. This is like the main thing that happens is like, look, if you control access to a multisig that has billions of dollars in it, don't click random links and make sure that all the multi SIG holders are different people. That is your main job if you're managing huge amounts of money.
00:09:02.656 - 00:09:30.078, Speaker C: Yeah, I think in this case, though, to be a little bit more nuanced, it's probably not a multi SIG with people holding private keys and signing them directly. I assume it was all server based, where they had, let's say, four different computers with identical code, each independently signing messages. It probably was less about humans and more about keys on identical servers being compromised because humans were silly. Right, and made mistakes.
00:09:30.254 - 00:10:16.074, Speaker B: Yeah, I think they mentioned that they left a whitelisting function in to call directly into one of their nodes, probably one of the signing nodes that's like, yeah, you don't want to do that. I do also wonder sort of the implications for maybe the market more broadly. I think there's sort of a L two versus L1 bearable thesis where it's like L two S are supposed to be this nirvana of super cheap transactions and everything just sort of happens within the same ecosystem. And that's kind of been, I think, foiled by the growth of these other chains and really cheap, fast bridges. And it's like, well, why am I going to use optimism when I can just bridge avalanche and it's way, way cheaper and faster and the bridge is sufficiently good so I don't have to worry about sort of network security or whatever. It's fine. Well, sometimes it's not fine.
00:10:16.074 - 00:10:41.340, Speaker B: And so I wonder if this is going to embolden people who are now maybe looking more to build on an L two instead of building on one of these cheaper, faster, up and coming L1s. Because maybe that assumption that, hey, the bridge is going to be secure and fine is not necessarily there. I agree. Maybe Ronan is not really emblematic of broader bridge building security, but I mean, Wormhole also was a massive hack and that's straight smart contract issue.
00:10:41.710 - 00:11:19.846, Speaker A: Yeah, I would say that I think this may be the first, it may be the beginning of us starting to people starting to really feel like, hey, multisigs aren't that secure. We've kind of gotten used to this idea that like, hey, multisigs are just kind of a fine stop gap. And there's no real difference between a multisig and some kind of full decentralized security solution because of course, centralized security solutions can also get hacked. And you mentioned L2. Of course. There was very famously, the $2 million bug bounty that was paid for that optimism paid out, what was the name? Soric discovering a vulnerability that allowed unlimited minting of ether, which you could use to drain all of optimism. Right.
00:11:19.846 - 00:12:00.002, Speaker A: So the reality is that all this stuff is friggin hard. All this stuff has massive surface area for bugs. I think the reason why people default to multisigs is that at least it's a security model and surface area that we know and has been very battle tested. Right. No one's worried about Gnosis safes getting compromised. Then the compromise just moves a layer up to like, can you actually manage that Gnosisafe in your own security surface area effectively? And here actually it's one of the reasons why I like the avalanche bridge. Because the avalanche bridge they basically use Intel SGX to ensure that the bridge operators are actually running according to a certain program.
00:12:00.002 - 00:13:03.222, Speaker A: Such that even if they were compromised, you can't break into the assuming that you don't have a compromise for SGX, you can't break into the machine and cause it to do stuff that it's not supposed to be doing. And ostensibly, if that works, and that setup is running correctly, which I think is a lot easier to do than a L2 or optimistic roll up or even the near bridge, which is used as sort of an optimistic design, the Rainbow bridge is more complex and it's got more surface area to it. So I think in the short term, my expectation is that bridges are going to try to find relatively simple ways, but lowering kind of the human error component to make sure that Bridging remains secure in the long run. We do have to find decentralized solutions to this stuff that doesn't rely on, hey, these like, seven people I know I can trust. If you know which of the seven people there are out there to try to go attack, you'll find them and you'll be able to attack them the way that you would think. Sky Mavis, it's like, okay, maybe some of the other multi stakeholders might be attacked, but Sky Mavis, like, they have the most incentive in the world to keep this thing secure and it was them who got popped. Yeah.
00:13:03.276 - 00:13:23.390, Speaker C: In terms of practical impacts of this, I mean, I forget who originally posited this. I think it might have been vitalik, but it's a pretty logical concept, which is wrapped assets that are bridged from another chain should be worth less than native assets. So Ether on avalanche, no matter how good the bridge is, should be worth less than ether on ethereum.
00:13:24.610 - 00:13:29.322, Speaker A: No, that doesn't make any sense. Wouldn't that apply to like, tether? Should be worth less than a dollar?
00:13:29.466 - 00:14:01.302, Speaker C: Not necessarily. But the concept being that if you have an asset on another blockchain, it actually has the bridge risk that the native asset just doesn't. Right. Fundamentally. And if you always treat them as being worth the same, at some point that's fine, but at some point it goes to zero type events. Right. I think this theory of risk arbitrage doesn't exist yet and users always treat them as exactly the same asset on different chains.
00:14:01.302 - 00:14:15.070, Speaker C: But I think over time some extremely sophisticated market behavior will emerge to value them differently, as it should, because they are and should be worth something different than the bridged versus unbridged version.
00:14:15.490 - 00:14:43.666, Speaker A: I understand the shape of your argument, obviously, but the reality is more complex because one, of course, Bridging stuff has a pretty tight arbitrage loop. So it's very easy to go and ARB something that is a bridged asset assuming that the bridges are pretty liquid and pretty fast. Second, if your argument were true, it should apply to Tether, it should apply to USDC, it should apply to anything that can't trade above the peg but can certainly trade below the peg as Tether has historically. And same with Dai. Right. Like Dai. Dai is also trade above the peg.
00:14:43.666 - 00:14:46.402, Speaker A: But Tether should never trade above the peg, presumably.
00:14:46.546 - 00:15:01.020, Speaker C: Absolutely. It should potentially trade based on the bridge risk being able to bridge back to the asset. Right. If you completely have no issues bridging back to a US dollar, then they should trade the you know, you have the risk that you're not able to bridge back.
00:15:01.390 - 00:15:02.602, Speaker D: It's not the same.
00:15:02.736 - 00:15:13.360, Speaker A: Which means that in good times and at equilibrium, assuming the bridge is fairly stable most of the time, although a bridged asset always has more risk, I think most likely it'll trade at par.
00:15:13.730 - 00:15:19.086, Speaker C: Somebody's not being compensated for risk then. Right. So then the question is who's not being properly compensated.
00:15:19.118 - 00:15:42.010, Speaker A: Yes. Although another way to look at it is that there may be a premium to like, look, if you're on avalanche, it's like, look, I really want ether here. I'm willing actually to pay a premium that may offset the risk premium that the bridger is taking. True. So it's know, importing dollars in other countries sometimes trade for more than they trade in the US. Even though it's complicated to import them.
00:15:42.160 - 00:15:44.860, Speaker C: Yeah, but those dollars oftentimes don't go to zero.
00:15:45.870 - 00:16:13.950, Speaker D: I think one thing we actually have to think about in these bridges is that, first of all, we kind of have this notion of native bridges versus non native bridges, of bridges that are like promissory notes on native tokens on another asset and bridges that are promissory notes on a local asset. So, like, if I have ETH and I went through wormhole right, I get a promissory note of wormhole ETH. But wormhole ETH is actually a promise on another chain.
00:16:14.030 - 00:16:14.274, Speaker A: Right?
00:16:14.312 - 00:17:06.446, Speaker D: It's a promise on the source chain versus something like wormhole synapse. Synapse a little bit more complicated, but like, let's say wormhole or sorry, layer zero. Layer zero is really a promissory note on your local chain, right? In some sense the problem is most users do not know anything about distributed systems. They're not thinking about source, destination, whether I have a future or a promise. So the number one thing I want to tell every listener who doesn't know anything about computer science but who is like oh, I have like $10 million bridge or cost 20 assets on ten different chains. Read the Wikipedia page for futures and promises in distributed systems. Because at the end of the day, the choice of bridge is a choice of a future promise system in distributed systems.
00:17:06.446 - 00:18:22.650, Speaker D: And you will not get if you don't understand what that thing is and how the notion of I'm holding something that's promising me something in the future versus something that's promising me something now versus something that's promising me something at the intermediate time. If you don't understand that dynamic, you don't really understand the asset that you own, right? You have a mental model that might be it is the thing that I think it is right now, but it might not be right, it might be only that thing at some future time or at some event happening. And the number one thing I think I've learned after watching all these bridge things is that people have not internalized a lot of basic terminology from distributed systems and mapped up to financial assets of the idea that hey. This thing that I think is one to one is actually a future plus a swap plus an option, and it may actually go to zero because the future might collapse at the same time as the option at the same time as a swap. And that's a very important thing to remember. I guess maybe I just wanted to summarize kind of the conversation I heard in kind of more concise terminology of like highly recommend reading what the concept of future and the promise is in distributed systems.
00:18:23.250 - 00:18:40.414, Speaker B: I think that's a very cogent point. But I think probably the people who are bridging are more enticed with getting 1500 APY on burrito finance versus considering the relationship that they have with their bridges. So maybe a point to haseeb's point on risk previous.
00:18:40.542 - 00:19:43.906, Speaker D: Well, the reason I say this is like, you know the website L two Beats which shows you a list of all the L two s and it gives you the security assumptions and it lets you have a little comparison matrix of this comparison matrix for the bridges and the notion of what assets are synthetic and not. And also more importantly for the end user, which assets are redeemable now? Which assets are redeemable only if I cross the bridge, which assets give me some other kind of guarantee. And I think the L2 community obviously may be to some extent overextending on this. They have focused on education in this frame, and everyone in the bridge side has just been like, yolo, it's the same thing. Like, we don't give a shit. We're just going to pretend, we're going to tell you you borrowed ETH on Salana and it's east, so your yield is yield. But I actually think there's a huge gap in the community of making L two beat for synthetics on bridges and that, I hope bridge beat.
00:19:44.098 - 00:19:44.786, Speaker A: Bridge beat.
00:19:44.818 - 00:19:47.558, Speaker D: I don't know what the name is, but yeah, the same.
00:19:47.724 - 00:20:16.510, Speaker A: We'll fund it, you build it, we'll fund it. I completely agree with that. And I think the bridges right now and you see this, the big war right now in bridges is between layer zero and axilar. And I think they're both in the position where they're trying to tell the story. I guess there's also synapse and multi chain. Obviously, they're trying to tell the story that Bridging is going to be super easy. It's just going to be like you click a button and it's like on the Internet, you don't care what domain you're sending your next request to.
00:20:16.510 - 00:21:06.066, Speaker A: And in the same way in Bridging and Blockchains, you will just click a button and you don't have to care about the details of how your transaction is getting routed and where the funds are going and whatever. And to your point, Tarun, it's not like the Internet because assets have to be sitting somewhere at rest. And when assets are sitting somewhere custodied on some particular chain, that means that now you have some kind of claim on an asset that exists somewhere else. And that claim, the way in which that claim is redeemed depends on the details of what exactly was wrapped, when and how exactly it gets redeemed, and if there has to be a swap in order to actually get the thing on the other side. It and so it's complicated and you got to know the details. And it's going to be a while until we actually are able to until it becomes more transparent to them what the Bridging experience is going to look like when we do have robust cross chain solutions. Today, I think what we most have.
00:21:06.088 - 00:21:57.650, Speaker D: Is beta software and not to kind of shield an abstract concept that perhaps all parties in this Zoom are invested in kind of looking forward to. But the notion of a cross chain block Explorer is quite different than the notion of a local chain Block Explorer and actually conveying to the end user what a cross chain transaction looks like will look different than Etherscan. And I think that's something that we have to actually internalize, that the UX for the end user will not be Etherscan. It will be like a very different looking thing for how we search through blockchains and how we organize blockchain and that will kind of whatever UX is, ether Scan 2.0 is like the difference between Gopher and Netscape.
00:21:58.470 - 00:22:24.074, Speaker A: Okay, well it turns out that Ronan was not the only hack or not the only very significant hack that took place during the last two weeks. We just recently saw another massive hack, well, actually a couple of them. So one we saw a massive hack in a protocol called Inverse Finance. They were hacked for $156,000,000 through an Oracle manipulation attack. Tom, you were explaining this one to me earlier, do you want to give the TLDR on how this happened?
00:22:24.272 - 00:22:28.618, Speaker B: Yeah, just to be clear, it's actually 15.6 million. I think a decimal got moved there.
00:22:28.704 - 00:22:31.854, Speaker A: Oh, whoops, sorry. 15.6 million? Yes.
00:22:31.892 - 00:22:32.814, Speaker B: Not as bad.
00:22:32.932 - 00:22:35.200, Speaker D: What's the decimal point between friends?
00:22:35.890 - 00:22:37.310, Speaker B: Yeah, I say that all the time.
00:22:37.380 - 00:22:39.566, Speaker A: There's no decimals on the blockchain, man.
00:22:39.748 - 00:22:49.170, Speaker D: Yeah, everything is fixed point, so who cares? I'm kidding, I'm kidding. Please do not ever assign me that. I understand what the shift operator?
00:22:49.670 - 00:24:03.542, Speaker B: So Inverse is a lending protocol on Ethereum and obviously I don't have to tell, we have the lending daddy in this call. A key part of a lending protocol is knowing how to mark assets, right? So you have to know how much is this worth? Am I properly collateralized? What is the value of my debt? What is the value of my collateral? A lot of teams will use an off chain Oracle system run their own, like with Maker, but a lot of teams will use a T Wop. So they'll look at an AMM and take a T Wop over the AMM and use that as their which allows you to support a lot of different assets. In theory it's more robust, et cetera, et cetera. Inverse was using a T Wop on SushiSwap for a couple of different tokens. The problem is that they were only doing a T Wop on one block, so basically they were looking at the previous block that was being traded and using that to mark the value of the assets in the next block. So Burt Miller from Flashbots actually had a really good rundown of this on Twitter and you basically call it one of the most sophisticated mev aware attacks that he's seen recently, where basically the attacker used a private mempool to insert its bundle, its bundle mind, that actually performed the attack.
00:24:03.542 - 00:24:40.230, Speaker B: So Arbitrage bots couldn't therefore capture its Oracle manipulation in the same block. So basically they push up the price of a bunch of these different assets in one block and they were able to borrow a bunch against it so way more than they would normally be able to. Again, normally this is not a big deal because on an AMM you can then just trade down and arbitrage against the value of overpriced asset. But because they got this transaction privately mined, no one was able to see it. And also because it's a one block T WAP, basically there was no opportunity for that lending market to recorrect its price. So a very very clever attack, and like you said, one of the most mev aware attacks that he'd seen recently.
00:24:40.570 - 00:24:42.360, Speaker A: Lending. Daddy, what's your take?
00:24:43.050 - 00:25:36.390, Speaker C: Nobody should use a price feed based on one block of prices. One block or zero blocks? Zero blocks or one block are both extremely bad, right? There used to be a whole lot of attacks because people were using the current price. Not even one block old TWAP, they were using, what's the current price? And that was like, the first wave of price feed based disruptions. A T wop of one block is no better, right? A T wop of 1 minute might not be better or even, like, five minutes, right? So it's extremely complex. This is one of the reasons why, if you are borrowing against assets, the protocol has to assume that prices might be a little bit stale or a little bit out of date, because this is a huge opportunity for risk.
00:25:36.730 - 00:26:33.050, Speaker A: So dumb choices, bad parameters. Then there was another Cybersecurity story that came out yesterday, which is that So OpenZeppelin, which was running an audit on behalf of Coinbase for Convex Finance, found that there was a way for the convex, I guess Admin and or multisig holders to basically rug the entire protocol and essentially drain all the funds in the protocol using a fairly complex chain of operations within the protocol. That is not supposed to be the case. Even if you have the admin keys, you're not supposed to be able to take money out of the protocol. But Admin keys were capable of performing this attack. Now, it was an interesting story, actually, because the question is, okay, if you know that there's a way that billions of dollars in 15 billion in this case, if you know, there's a way that billions of dollars of capital can be extracted from a protocol, but it can't be done by anybody. It can only be done by the admin.
00:26:33.050 - 00:27:16.370, Speaker A: How do you do responsible disclosure for a situation like that? And the answer that OpenZeppelin ended up coming to was that they approached the team and they told them, hey, guys, we found a very severe vulnerability that allows the Admins to drain all the capital in the protocol. But we can't tell you because, look, we love you guys, and I believe that you're in it for the right reasons. But look, there's $15 billion. We can't mess around here. So in order for us to disclose this vulnerability to, you have to add more people to the multisig so that when we disclose it, we are confident that you can't get a plurality of the multisig to sign off on any type of attack. And so Convex Finance did that. They added more people to the multisig and then OpenZeppelin disclosed, and then they fixed the bug.
00:27:16.370 - 00:27:35.440, Speaker A: So a very, very interesting almost like James Bond esque series of maneuvers that had to be done here to make sure that everything could be. Rescued without the bomb going off. So I thought this is an interesting one, but it's just another continuation in the through line of this week, which has been that smart contracts are hard and people keep messing them up.
00:27:35.890 - 00:28:05.510, Speaker B: I'm kind of surprised that Convex has not migrated to a fully on chain governance system. Like I think in the early days of protocols, it's pretty natural for the core team to retain a multi, SIG over contract upgrades and then basically respect the votes of token holders. And so there's a sort of task agreement there and obviously for a treasury, a lot of teams use a multisig, but there's sort of less of a risk with that. But this seems like they had upgrade abilities on a two or three multisig for a protocol with 15 billion TVL, which is which is kind of insane.
00:28:06.010 - 00:29:09.770, Speaker D: I think the story of Convex is also warranted here where it was built around the Curve finance contract and they kind of built this allocation tool that is actually a lot super complex, I think. I know there's this general movement of like, hey, we want the Ve model everywhere. Unlike Tom, I'm not saying any value judgment on whether it's good or bad. I know Tom has very strong opinions on this, as we've seen on Twitter. Ignoring the value judgment on that the code is actually extremely hard to reason. Know there's like a way of abstracting the Ve model to something simple, but the way it's actually written is much more complicated than the Curve code, which is extremely simple in a lot of ways, minus, of course, sort of like how do you compute the invariant gradient to something. So I actually think there's like, this weird thing of, like, convex is actually a little like it was made as a way to kind of boost Kerr.
00:29:09.770 - 00:29:45.240, Speaker D: And then I suspect, based on the Code commit history, a lot of the early developers do not work on it anymore. And people are very afraid to transition because there's not a very good developer ecosystem around it. And you can just go look at the code commit history. And there's a lot of inconsistencies there in a weird way that if I were them, I would be very afraid of transitioning to governance. The alpha leak in this entire industry is read the GitHub, right? And the Convex GitHub tells a very interesting story.
00:29:45.850 - 00:29:50.086, Speaker C: What's the 92nd TLDR interesting story to.
00:29:50.108 - 00:30:31.590, Speaker D: Leak all the alpha, I think interesting story is very clear that the Curve development team and the Convex development team were very closely tied for a long enough time period. Obviously Convex built everything around Curve, but there was a point at which they clearly diverged and it wasn't clear who the sides of the divergent sides were. And then the side that was maintaining Convex sort of seems to have disappeared. And there have been some community PRS, but there hasn't been a lot of the main developer core contributing as much. There have definitely been some patches, but in a way that I think transitioning to governance would be hard if they weren't more involved.
00:30:32.330 - 00:31:18.034, Speaker A: That's interesting. I haven't spent enough time thinking about that, so I'm glad you brought that up. Tarun is the idea that transitioning over into governance, into fully on chain governance, requires some confidence and stability in the underlying code, right? It's not just a matter of, okay, we're not iterating as much or we're not as startupy anymore and we kind of got product market fit and now it's time to hand things over to onchain governance. It is also confidence that we're not very likely to come across a bug that needs to get fixed overnight. We've got some good understanding about how to change the code and actually review code updates that happen via governance. And we're pretty confident that we're not going to accidentally pass through governance something that's just going to explode the entire protocol. And if you don't have that, then it's kind of hard.
00:31:18.034 - 00:32:05.650, Speaker A: It's almost know transitioning a project when Facebook develops some open source thing and then they're like, great, now let's put it into some, let's create some foundation around it or whatever and just spin it out into that thing. And that thing can run it from now on or hand it over to one of these kind of open source cemeteries where projects stop getting innovated on. I guess it's sort of equivalent for protocols is that you can only really fully move something out of the hands of the Core team when you're confident enough that it can live on without the loving hands and the upbringing that you need in the early days to have a secure enough code base. And if you never get there, you never actually get to that point where people are confident in how to change it and how to steward it, then it might never cross that chasm.
00:32:06.710 - 00:32:40.254, Speaker D: There's sort of a latency thing, right, of like when you go to full governance. Governance is not instant the way your multisig is, right? There's some latency of describing the problem, convincing the community, doing the vote. And the question is, do you think the high severity bugs in your code base can be corrected at that latency? They're not like something that needs to be corrected faster than that. And if you don't have the confidence for that, it can be extremely difficult, I think, community wise, to do such a thing.
00:32:40.452 - 00:33:14.010, Speaker B: I think there are ways that had training wheels, right? There are projects that have an admin emergency stop, which makes sense, like, hey, there's a vulnerability. No more deposits, no withdrawals. Like we're going to swap out the contract through governance versus just winging it and throwing it in the wild. But one man's bug is another man's bounty. And so true that, yes, something like that might be difficult to get through governance, but there's a reason why you want something like that to get through governance. Because the flip side is that you wield an incredible amount of power to be able to upgrade an implementation contract like that.
00:33:14.160 - 00:34:10.026, Speaker D: Yeah, two comparisons, right? The Convex contract is like very fresh contract written by this initial set of developers, but they don't rest on any other code base in some way. And so it's like a very new code base and then they're not super active and it's not clear that they built enough resilience around it. On the other hand, Terra's code base, if you look at the commits to Terra, there are extremely small number of developers who have committed to Terra's fork and tenderness. But yet, because the Cosmos ecosystem has an insanely large number of developers that they're constantly upstreaming updates from, you can actually believe that their ecosystem is sort of implied. A developer ecosystem is actually bigger than what their code base says. Convex is much more weird. It's really standing on its own.
00:34:10.026 - 00:34:53.450, Speaker D: And most people who copy it are people who for instance, Tribeca Dao has basically reimplemented Convex in Solana. Well, that's not a very good comparison, right? It's not like the tribeca dao developers. Let's say there was like a big emergency, convex could actually go fix it because they're not writing this weird combination of viper and solidity. And so there's kind of this kind of very boring people involved thing that I think one has to consider when fully decentralizing. In a lot of ways, it's really important to have developer community that understands intimately what's happening. That's just my opinion. Again, other people may think it's safer otherwise.
00:34:54.670 - 00:35:28.622, Speaker A: Fair points all around. And if anything, this week is a good reminder of why this stuff matters. And we've seen a number of big failures and actually not last of which, there's another story that we wanted to cover this week of this stablecoin that we don't talk about very much, called USDN. So people have probably seen that there's a smart contract platform called Waves that's been pumping a lot over the last few weeks, specifically after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Well, it pumped a lot and then it pumped not so much. And so Waves is a smart contract blockchain. It's been around forever.
00:35:28.622 - 00:36:23.126, Speaker A: I've only ever known it as like the Russia smart contract chain. I haven't known a whole lot about Waves besides that, but so Waves has a project on it called Neutrino, which is a stablecoin somewhat similar to Terra, but it's got different mechanics. I don't actually understand all the details about how Neutrino works, but basically it's supposed to trade for a dollar because it's stablecoin. So a bunch of drama erupted over this last week of the founder of Waves accusing Alameda, whom they paid FTI. Alameda is the market making arm associated with FTX. The founder of Waves accused Alameda of despite the fact that FTX took like a million and a half integration fee to get waves and their ecosystem integrated into FTX. Alameda went and supposedly shorted an enormous amount of USDN to try to break the peg or something along those lines or collect a huge funding rate.
00:36:23.126 - 00:36:51.840, Speaker A: I don't know. There's a big argument on Twitter about why exactly they were doing this, but supposedly the founder claims that because of that, neutrino is now trading below the peg and there's a bunch of fingers getting pointed in every direction. It's kind of like the spiderman meme. And Neutrino is now as of right now, they're trading at something like $0.88. So it is trading very comfortably below the peg and does not seem to be moving very much from there. So maybe it's stable at $0.88. I'm not sure.
00:36:51.840 - 00:37:01.540, Speaker A: So we were talking before we began recording. We were like, I bet Tarun knows how this thing works. So, Tarun, do you know how this thing works? And can you explain this to us?
00:37:01.910 - 00:37:26.300, Speaker D: I don't, but there is someone at my work who runs a liquidator and who is explaining a very rough estimate of it, and I can give you the analogy, which is it's Titan plus Terra. So it has sort of like a very lossy stablecoin, like ESC adjusting the inflation curve mechanism, but then.
00:37:28.030 - 00:37:28.650, Speaker A: It gets.
00:37:28.720 - 00:38:06.354, Speaker D: More tight under big price drops. But the problem is that the oracle to the price drops is actually not that great because it mainly includes the on chain liquidity and their weights are not kind of super good for that, which is apparently a great thing for people running liquidators. That's the only thing I know. So that is basically all I know. So I apologize. I really tried to read their docs once, and I really felt like I was getting a lecture on something I didn't understand. And I somehow was like, this has got to be a scam.
00:38:06.354 - 00:38:11.686, Speaker D: And this is like a year and a half ago. And so then I never looked into it again.
00:38:11.868 - 00:38:30.078, Speaker A: That is generally the worst sign for a white paper. When you're reading it and you feel like you're being lectured to and you feel like it's like, wait, where are all these terms coming from? I've never heard, why are you making up a new word for this? That is kind of the worst feeling. Although you must be very used to that, giving you read math papers all the time. And I feel like that's like, how every math paper?
00:38:30.164 - 00:39:09.114, Speaker D: But I feel like the problem with crypto, these stablecoin papers in particular, is everyone who's doing it. Okay, here's my theory. Anyone who makes a new stablecoin, especially non collateralized stablecoins, is a certain type of Theodore Kaczynski. They're kind of like a little bit crazy in a certain way where they're like, I am going to reinvent every fucking thing in finance, and it's going to be exactly this way, and I'm going to make everything. And they have this kind of like crazed look in their face. And it's not like their words are any different. Their words are also equally as crazy.
00:39:09.114 - 00:39:19.680, Speaker D: They kind of have this kind of psychopath tendency because it's like to believe you're going to do this also without collateral. Collateralized systems I'm ignoring. Right?
00:39:20.130 - 00:39:20.542, Speaker A: Sure.
00:39:20.596 - 00:40:12.990, Speaker D: Collateralized systems much more naturally, naturally, purely Algo Stablecoins. The people who found these things oftentimes, number one thing I've learned, they do not look at history. They do not say, like, oh, what are the attempts that have happened before me? They're just, no, no, I'm going to invent the greatest thing because I'm God's gift to Earth, and I'm this genius who knows what's how, and they never look at history. And this neutrino thing was like, exactly to the T, this thing of like, oh, yeah, well, the central bank works this way, insert things that partially are true, partially not true, but we're being suppressed by the political forces X. And so here is how we get around them by this kind of very simple, like, PID controller. That's usually the pitch and neutrino was that except more political.
00:40:13.730 - 00:40:33.878, Speaker A: And every major stablecoin, especially to your point, the senior shares type models, they pretty much always have a section in there about, okay, what's going to happen after the dollar collapses? And how are we going to become you always need a section for what happens after the dollar collapses because obviously that's the most important thing I need.
00:40:33.884 - 00:40:52.080, Speaker D: To know when I'm investing crypto papers. Very few are as political as the Bitcoin White paper and algorithmic stablecoins. Those are the two that for no reason will invoke political fortitude. It's like proof of political might that's like what they want to do to you when you're reading them.
00:40:52.690 - 00:40:57.466, Speaker A: I think the Bitcoin paper is actually surprisingly sober. Like, it's actually not very political.
00:40:57.658 - 00:41:02.590, Speaker D: Well, I guess I'm including all the forum posts in my interpretation.
00:41:03.330 - 00:41:42.042, Speaker C: Here's a shameless plug for the Bitcoin waypaper. If you haven't read it in the last, like, 24 months, go back and read it. It's delightful because it takes extremely big things that people spend years debating, like proof of work. And it's like, oh, no, it uses proof of work and with an increasing difficulty, and it's like two sentences. The white paper is so succinct in terms of simplifying extremely big things into a two sentence, like, oh, no, it uses proof of work, and the difficulty increases as a function of the last difficulty. And you're like, that's the entire explanation of proof of work in the Bitcoin White paper. It's crazy.
00:41:42.042 - 00:41:45.390, Speaker C: It's so simple, and it's not political, I agree.
00:41:45.460 - 00:42:15.638, Speaker D: But I guess generally you read a layer one paper, like a smart contract language paper. It's like, here is the future of computation, right? And then you read a paper about a DeFi protocol. It's like, here's why Goldman Sachs sucks at doing this thing. But then you read the Algo Stablecoin papers and it's like, wow, you have to have a certain type of crazy to write that. There's just no way around it. It's built into them. Who else would write that?
00:42:15.804 - 00:42:28.586, Speaker A: I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it started with Basis, and I think Basis kind of like I don't know if anybody here has read the Basis white pair. Basis was basically it was not the inventor of senior shares. Senior shares was invented, like, I think in 2014 or something by I think.
00:42:28.608 - 00:42:34.518, Speaker D: It was Robert Sam's Bit shares which failed. Don't forget Bitch Shares, R-I-P. Well, Bitch.
00:42:34.534 - 00:42:37.722, Speaker A: Shares was not senior shares, but they.
00:42:37.776 - 00:42:44.058, Speaker D: Added senior and shares late at the end to try to capture the like, while they were crashing. It didn't work.
00:42:44.244 - 00:42:46.562, Speaker A: Right. I didn't know that. It's okay.
00:42:46.616 - 00:42:49.698, Speaker D: The founders all founded EOS, so they're fine.
00:42:49.864 - 00:43:06.438, Speaker A: They're fine. They're doing well. They're all doing well. But I think it started with Basis. Basis that kind of taught people, like, look, if you want to do an algo stablecoin, you got to just be maximally crazy. You cannot pull any stock. I'm going to completely reinvent money.
00:43:06.438 - 00:43:20.640, Speaker A: The dollar is going to disappear because of how awesome my stablecoin is, and eventually this will just eat the world, and everyone will use this. And I remember the back tests. I don't know if you guys saw did you guys invest in Basis back in the day?
00:43:21.010 - 00:43:24.334, Speaker C: I didn't, but I remember all of my friends did.
00:43:24.532 - 00:43:24.990, Speaker A: Okay.
00:43:25.060 - 00:43:30.480, Speaker D: Yeah, I did not, in spite of being friends with Natter for ten years.
00:43:32.050 - 00:43:34.134, Speaker A: Interesting. That's cold.
00:43:34.282 - 00:43:47.038, Speaker D: No, I love Natter. The sales pitch was crazy. I was I what world am like, I had to just be like, I need more drugs if I'm going to believe this pitch.
00:43:47.134 - 00:44:34.754, Speaker A: Yeah. To be clear, I love Natter. I thought Basis had a ton of problems, and we saw in practice that it obviously did, because everything that tried to implement Basis failed and broke pretty quickly. But I love Natter, but I remember when I read the back test, so this was early days of crypto, and so anything that you wrote that was technical, people just immediately believed. And so he wrote this. They did these simulations that basically showed that Basis the question was always like, okay, the senior shares model is it not just going to break in times of high volatility. And they were like, all right, we're going to do these simulations that proves during the Mexican peso cris, the ruble crisis, the Civil war, we're going to take all this economic data, and we're going to run simulations that proves that Basis works even during the worst possible periods in history.
00:44:34.754 - 00:44:44.978, Speaker A: And I'm like, I don't believe you. I do not believe you. I believe you did something that shows a program that says something. I don't believe you that Basis would work in any of those circumstances.
00:44:45.154 - 00:44:51.820, Speaker C: Yeah, the real world, when you have a bunch of Djens with their money in something, it won't perform like you think.
00:44:52.190 - 00:45:08.190, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm working on a pet theory around these Senorige models around I mean, obviously the issue is always like, at some point the price of the share component starts going down. There's like a crisis of confidence around the system and that inevitably sort of leads to this collapse.
00:45:08.690 - 00:45:09.726, Speaker A: But if you look at the ones.
00:45:09.748 - 00:45:47.446, Speaker B: That have been moderately successful so far, it's Terra and it's waves neutrino. I think that's in part because the shares component is this yield generating share in a proof of stake blockchain. And so there's something going on here where it's like, well, this can't be worth nothing because I'm getting 15% a year staking my Luna or staking my neutrino. And so it's like some sort of mental shift and like, oh, there's some fundamental value here versus, like, this is just some coin that they minted. Fuck this. This whole thing is going to zero. Which tends to be sort of the end state for all these Senorge models.
00:45:47.638 - 00:46:07.090, Speaker A: Well, it's also there's some exogenous demand. Right? So for Terra, terra has the Senor shares type model, but people want Terra for other reasons beyond just the stable. I mean, presumably people want Terra for reasons other than the stablecoin, which is why it has at least some nominal diversification of the value of the share token.
00:46:07.670 - 00:46:09.090, Speaker D: You mean anchor?
00:46:09.910 - 00:46:20.278, Speaker A: Yes. Obviously a lot of it is anchor. A lot of the UST demand, lunar demand is anchor, but in principle, at least, it's at least nominally better.
00:46:20.444 - 00:47:00.546, Speaker D: And I think that was the key to actually being a layer one stablecoin that sello missed that basis, missed a lot of the people who were kind of trying to go for that model hoped that the organic demand would be payments. Right. The dream of stablecoins was always payments, but it was wrong. You can't really bootstrap stablecoins off payments. You have to bootstrap def off lending and more complicated things because at the end of the day, the dumb users are not the first users and it's impossible to bootstrap at that point. Right. And speaking of stablecoin, we're going to see a bitcoin stablecoin soon, according to the news today.
00:47:00.728 - 00:47:02.162, Speaker A: Wait, which news is this?
00:47:02.296 - 00:47:03.970, Speaker B: It's lightning. Labs.
00:47:04.630 - 00:47:11.926, Speaker A: Oh, I did not see this. Someone want to explain this? I just woke up. It's morning here in Singapore in our last five minutes.
00:47:12.108 - 00:47:14.370, Speaker C: What's happening with a bitcoin stablecoin?
00:47:14.530 - 00:47:22.006, Speaker D: Well, Lightning Labs raised like $70 million for a sort of bitcoin token standard and bitcoin stablecoin.
00:47:22.198 - 00:47:28.330, Speaker B: I thought it was just stablecoins on bitcoin through Lightning. Is it actually a bitcoin backed stablecoin?
00:47:29.950 - 00:48:01.094, Speaker D: It's not clearly bitcoin backed. I think the main thing is they have a sort of modification of this token standard that people had been trying to build on top of Lightning. I'm sure I'm offending some pure bitcoiners on when I call it a token standard, but there is an overlay network that you can transfer value of assets that are not directly pegged to bitcoin. Sorry. Hopefully that's the politically correct definition of a token in that corner of the universe. They want to actually build a low variance asset for it.
00:48:01.212 - 00:48:07.110, Speaker B: It's like the Winnie the Pooh meme. It's like the low class of stablecoin. You got the high class, the low variance assets.
00:48:10.750 - 00:48:15.740, Speaker D: I'm just parroting what I've read. I want to offend no one.
00:48:17.070 - 00:48:46.290, Speaker A: Well, you failed at offending no one for sure. Yeah. It's interesting how incredibly political stablecoins have become. They used to be a pretty boring and unobjectionable part of crypto, and now it turns out they're the most exciting part of crypto. Just real quick, last piece of news, which is kind of crypto adjacent, but I'm going to count it as crypto. Elon Musk was just announced as having taken a massive stake in Twitter. He was secretly buying up Twitter equity over the last couple of months.
00:48:46.290 - 00:49:04.220, Speaker A: He now owns 9.2% of the overall share of Twitter. He makes it the single largest shareholder in Twitter, and he was just appointed today to the Twitter Board of Directors. So Elon Musk is now going to be influencing stuff happening at Twitter. How do we feel about this, everybody?
00:49:05.390 - 00:49:20.320, Speaker D: One of the greatest SEC filings in history. It is like the shortest thing ever. It's like SEC. Elon Musk has joined the board of Twitter. He agrees not to own 14.9%. The end. Amazing.
00:49:20.320 - 00:49:23.070, Speaker D: Edgar edgar has been blessed.
00:49:25.190 - 00:49:28.260, Speaker B: I was actually wondering about that. Why is it 14.9%?
00:49:28.950 - 00:49:44.520, Speaker C: If I had to guess, in the corporate radar, eighty S or whatever they said, oh, only 15% has all sort of different things. They said, well, it can't be. 1514.9 is where the limit is.
00:49:45.690 - 00:49:49.946, Speaker D: That sounds exactly like probably the right answer.
00:49:50.128 - 00:49:50.860, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:49:51.950 - 00:50:02.842, Speaker B: I feel like Elon is living the Web three dream. The largest users of the protocol are governing the protocol in a very clunky, backwards way. But this is the way it should be.
00:50:02.976 - 00:50:03.850, Speaker A: I think it's great.
00:50:03.920 - 00:50:08.170, Speaker C: I actually think we're going to see a lot more crypto native features come to Twitter. That's my prediction.
00:50:08.330 - 00:50:15.620, Speaker D: I mean, we already saw it with Jax getting kicked out, like, almost literally the next two days after he left.
00:50:15.990 - 00:50:23.410, Speaker A: Well, let's see if maybe SPF is going to know. I don't know. What could he buy? Foursquare?
00:50:23.990 - 00:50:32.694, Speaker D: Well, the ESPN part of the world is weird because every sports person is making an NFT platform right now.
00:50:32.812 - 00:50:33.430, Speaker A: It's true.
00:50:33.500 - 00:50:37.000, Speaker D: So I don't know what the economics are.
00:50:38.490 - 00:50:49.002, Speaker A: Yeah, the unfortunate reality is that actually, SBF doesn't need to buy anything because everyone's already going all in on crypto. So things will just kind of happen whether or not crypto people buy a stake in them.
00:50:49.136 - 00:51:13.154, Speaker D: One last news item. Is the FTX investing in IEX thing a proof Boys was wrong, which I'm personally, having worked in the industry, I feel vindicated a little bit. But the second thing is that FTX buying IEX tells you a little bit of a signal that stocks and crypto are going to converge to the same thing. Five years.
00:51:13.192 - 00:51:17.750, Speaker A: Well, they bought a stake in didn't they? Didn't they didn't buy IX, did they?
00:51:17.820 - 00:51:51.786, Speaker D: No, but it seems like it's the type of thing where they need ATS licenses, and they want to do FTX us doing stock trading, and they want stock and crypto trading. Same place. You don't notice the difference. And IEX is like the weakest dog at the it's like the half mute missing one leg. Dog has 2% market share on a good day. Not exactly the sharpest tool at the shed on the equities markets. And equities markets are razor thin margins.
00:51:51.786 - 00:52:05.926, Speaker D: Right. And they were already kind of struggling. So it was a very pointed move to people in the HFT world. We were all just like, all my group cats woke up being like, stocks and equities are the same in five years.
00:52:06.108 - 00:52:16.370, Speaker A: Wow, that's a bold vision. That's exciting. I have a sneaking suspicion that it may be it's kind of like when sequoia and paradigm invested into sitsec.
00:52:16.450 - 00:52:21.814, Speaker D: No, sitsec in particular. Sitsec. Not the rest of Citadel.
00:52:21.862 - 00:52:22.554, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly.
00:52:22.672 - 00:52:27.146, Speaker D: No, just the HFT part. Pun is going to be CEO. Not even Ken Griffin. That's crazy.
00:52:27.248 - 00:52:27.622, Speaker A: Pun.
00:52:27.686 - 00:52:30.842, Speaker D: Who's this stats PhD guy?
00:52:30.976 - 00:52:31.494, Speaker A: Professor.
00:52:31.542 - 00:53:04.360, Speaker D: Former professor. He was the one who was like, going on CNN. I was like, what the fuck? I can't believe that guy is going on CNN to represent very it's a weird, like, let's just say the trading world is getting blown up by crypto. And the IEX thing to me was more of a signal than Fidel because it was like, the big dog. Crypto exchanges want to compete with US equities exchanges, and they could. The fact that they could is crazy. Two years ago, you would never have thought that.
00:53:04.360 - 00:53:07.062, Speaker D: One year ago, you would never have thought that.
00:53:07.196 - 00:53:30.830, Speaker A: Well, speaking of crypto blowing up, actually, last thing, Tarun, last time we announced the news of Gauntlet becoming a unicorn. And so now that you're actually here and are willing to grace us with your presence, we wanted to congratulate you on the amazing progress that Gauntlet has made. Would you like to give us a word in your acceptance speech of your unicorn status?
00:53:31.890 - 00:53:44.740, Speaker D: Given that award shows have not had a great couple weeks, as we all know, all I have to say is I hope I have better colored hair next time I'm on the show.
00:53:45.110 - 00:53:50.438, Speaker A: Yeah, what's going on, man? Are you going clean now? Now that you've made a big no.
00:53:50.524 - 00:53:58.646, Speaker D: It'S just that I got to redye my hair. I've been lazy, so I promise the viewers something better soon.
00:53:58.828 - 00:54:01.480, Speaker A: Yeah, can we do like, an on chain vote for this?
00:54:02.430 - 00:54:09.066, Speaker D: Actually, that's great. That's great. One of you can start a poll and I will go do okay, okay.
00:54:09.168 - 00:54:11.098, Speaker C: I'm starting a poll right now.
00:54:11.264 - 00:54:25.522, Speaker A: All right. For the at home listeners on the podcast side, Tarun's Hair right now is jet black. Come join to robert Leschner is going to be launching the poll. Come and vote on what Tarun's Hair is going to be next time he hops on the show.
00:54:25.656 - 00:54:27.010, Speaker C: What are the choices?
00:54:27.510 - 00:54:29.102, Speaker B: Oh, he's got a few highlights.
00:54:29.246 - 00:54:35.154, Speaker A: He's fading. Yeah. Okay. I'd say at least Magenta needs to be on there.
00:54:35.272 - 00:54:36.370, Speaker C: Magenta.
00:54:36.710 - 00:54:37.650, Speaker A: What else?
00:54:37.800 - 00:54:39.780, Speaker C: Green, obviously.
00:54:40.230 - 00:54:45.880, Speaker A: Green. Green's a classic. What else? Two more white.
00:54:46.570 - 00:54:48.520, Speaker B: Yeah, just go bleach it.
00:54:49.050 - 00:54:49.446, Speaker A: All right.
00:54:49.468 - 00:54:51.258, Speaker C: I'm putting that as an option, but.
00:54:51.424 - 00:54:53.974, Speaker B: I don't know, it's non binding.
00:54:54.102 - 00:54:54.762, Speaker A: All right.
00:54:54.896 - 00:54:56.198, Speaker B: It's a one on one multi segment.
00:54:56.214 - 00:54:57.510, Speaker C: I need one more choice.
00:54:57.670 - 00:54:58.982, Speaker A: Result. One more choice.
00:54:59.126 - 00:55:01.082, Speaker C: Throon what do we have?
00:55:01.216 - 00:55:05.710, Speaker D: I was going to just go green because I always do green, but blue.
00:55:06.130 - 00:55:08.334, Speaker A: Yeah, let's do blue. Let's throw blue in there.
00:55:08.532 - 00:55:25.298, Speaker D: It really depends. It's like I've gone to the same hairstylist for twelve years and I only go the same person, and whatever she says does kind of dominate. So just understand that there's not a final poll that people okay, well, let's.
00:55:25.314 - 00:55:27.830, Speaker C: End the show here. But I'm going to put up this poll imminently.
00:55:28.330 - 00:55:35.030, Speaker A: That sounds good. All right, thanks everybody. In a couple of weeks we'll check back in and see how Trun's Hair is doing. See everyone.
00:55:35.100 - 00:55:35.798, Speaker D: Thanks again.
00:55:35.884 - 00:55:36.340, Speaker A: Thanks everyone.
