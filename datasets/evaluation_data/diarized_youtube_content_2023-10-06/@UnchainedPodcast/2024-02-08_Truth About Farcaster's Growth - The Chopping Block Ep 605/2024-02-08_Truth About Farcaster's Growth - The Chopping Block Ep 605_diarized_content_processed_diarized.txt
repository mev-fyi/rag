00:00:00.250 - 00:00:07.098, Speaker A: Frames launched. I don't know if I have ever seen a community so excited about a new feature.
00:00:07.194 - 00:00:08.090, Speaker B: Not a dividend.
00:00:08.170 - 00:00:09.402, Speaker C: It's a tale of two Quan.
00:00:09.466 - 00:00:12.074, Speaker B: Now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet.
00:00:12.122 - 00:00:14.682, Speaker C: Generally speaking, airdrops are kind of pointless anyways.
00:00:14.826 - 00:00:17.498, Speaker B: Unnamed trading firms who are very involved.
00:00:17.594 - 00:00:19.710, Speaker C: Alec ETH is the ultimate on this.
00:00:19.780 - 00:00:22.720, Speaker D: Defi protocols are the antidote to this problem.
00:00:24.530 - 00:00:41.210, Speaker B: Hello, everybody. Welcome to the chopping block. Every couple of weeks, the four of us get together and give the industry insider's perspective on the crypto topics of the day. So quick intros. First, we've got Robert, the cryptocurrency and czar of Superstate GM, everybody. Next we've got Tarun the gigabrain and grand Poohba at Gauntlet.
00:00:41.550 - 00:00:42.570, Speaker C: Aloha.
00:00:43.310 - 00:00:47.980, Speaker B: And special guest today we have Ted farcaster, fangirl number one.
00:00:48.990 - 00:00:49.930, Speaker A: Jim.
00:00:50.910 - 00:01:11.742, Speaker B: And I am seeb, the head hype man at Dragonfly. So we are early stage investors in crypto, but I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice, legal advice, or even life advice. Please see chopping block XYZ for more disclosures. Ted, welcome to the show. We are very excited to have you on because today is the episode and we wanted to get on somebody. Sorry, go ahead, Robert.
00:01:11.806 - 00:01:13.860, Speaker D: No, I was just giving hype to the.
00:01:17.430 - 00:01:36.090, Speaker B: Wanted. We wanted to bring on. So for the Farcaster episode, because Farcaster is a social media app, for those who don't know, it's kind of a Twitter decentralized Twitter clone, I guess. Clone, let's call it a clone. It's a protocol. It's not itself, the interface, it's a protocol. And many people can build interfaces on top of the Farcaster protocol.
00:01:36.090 - 00:01:53.630, Speaker B: We wanted to bring on somebody who is a power user of Farcaster who could kind of talk about it from the inside perspective. And my understanding is that you are a big Farcaster superfan booster. Talk to us about your experience of Farcaster, how you came across it and what you do on there.
00:01:53.700 - 00:02:12.758, Speaker A: Good question. I am a Farcaster power user. I feel like it's part of my personality now. And even my Twitter username, my Twitter display name is actually like Ted on Farcaster. And I've been doing that since before. It was cool, but I actually got onto Farcaster. I think it was November 2021.
00:02:12.758 - 00:02:21.334, Speaker A: So it's been a while. I was connected to Dan for some job advice. I was like, oh, I'm thinking about going like, full time into crypto. What do you think?
00:02:21.372 - 00:02:24.534, Speaker B: And got connected, Dan being Dan Romero, the founder of Farcaster.
00:02:24.582 - 00:02:45.970, Speaker A: Yep. Dan Romero, founder of Farcaster, co founder is Varun. They worked together at Coinbase, and he was like, of course, gave great, great advice and kind of changed the trajectory of my life that way. But then also was like, oh, I have this social media, decentralized social app. If you want to try it out. It's called Farcaster. I'll send you, like, an invite code.
00:02:45.970 - 00:03:03.730, Speaker A: And this was in November 2021. I wasn't really on Twitter that much at all. I was more of, like, Instagram. That's where my friends were. So I hopped on Twitter, and I think, Tarun, you were there already. I think you were an early user. You might have churned.
00:03:03.810 - 00:03:23.950, Speaker C: Yeah. I will say one thing is, as much as you can dislike Twitter, every time you try a new thing, trying to compete with Twitter, it's just hard to get the stickiness. But I have to say, super hard. Ted was one of the people who convinced me to continue trying to push on Farcaster.
00:03:25.090 - 00:03:28.174, Speaker B: What did early Farcaster feel like? What was like the 20?
00:03:28.372 - 00:03:28.830, Speaker A: Okay.
00:03:28.900 - 00:03:29.134, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:03:29.172 - 00:03:53.494, Speaker A: It's like this funny trope right now where everyone's like, we're so early. We're so early. And I was chatting and was like, I remember back when you couldn't delete your casts, it was very early. You didn't know who was liking your cast. You didn't know who was deleting or who was like, you couldn't delete your cast. I remember before that, I was like, oh, I got a like on my cast. Like, I didn't know who liked it.
00:03:53.494 - 00:04:22.910, Speaker A: I was so excited. Every cast I was doing, I was getting a like. Turns out it was just like, just Dan liking my cast, but it was super quiet. I think the first cast I ever did, in retrospect, is kind of cringe. I was like, hey, looking for some new web three resources. What direction can you point me in? And I was on a platform full of crypto oGs who were like, what do you mean? You're starting to learn about it. So it was relatively quiet.
00:04:23.970 - 00:04:29.778, Speaker B: So what was the vibe, though? What was the thing driving the community at that time? What were people talking about?
00:04:29.944 - 00:05:05.342, Speaker A: It was very technical. Lots of founders on there. And then, I think into 2022, more and more people started onboarding, and I think people began to find, like, a community. And so it was one place where I could ask a question and then get responses back. And so you were having this mix of very technical conversations, like, rooted in EVM and developer conversations. But then you were also having intellectual discussions as well, because the signal to noise ratio was so good and better than you could find anywhere else. So that was just like, one thing to me was like, okay, great.
00:05:05.342 - 00:05:52.762, Speaker A: I could try doing this on Twitter, but I wouldn't be able to have conversations. Or I could try doing it on Farcaster and actually get good feedback and develop connections with people that I wouldn't get to do anywhere else. And so I think that one of the memes, or like, I guess it's a feature and a bug, it depends on who you ask, is that Farcaster is so nice, is what people say. And I think it just comes down to early farcaster community when it was like less than 1000 users, even less than 10,000, it was like how you would treat your neighbor and how you would treat people that you would see in person and interact with, even if you didn't agree with them or disagree with them. So that was the vibe. And then also, everyone was very bullish in general. So there were no grifters.
00:05:52.762 - 00:06:43.818, Speaker A: There were zero grifters. If you were bullish on crypto, generally in the bear market, you stuck around. Everyone was there. Where I felt like on Twitter, it was very superficial. Yeah, exactly. And for me, as somebody who was really rolling up my sleeves and trying to understand the crypto ecosystem, having come in in 2020 instead of most of those people were 2014, 2015, I basically had the steepest learning curve that I was able to tackle because I was surrounded by some of the greatest, most authentic, just very experienced and knowledgeable people who had been working in crypto for a long time. And they were incredibly welcoming to those of us who didn't have the same background.
00:06:43.818 - 00:07:14.760, Speaker A: And so I think also you'll meet a lot of people on Farcaster early days who weren't working in crypto, but all of a sudden have a completely different perspective on crypto because their access point were a high concentration of really incredible builders. So that's what I would say early vibes were, but it was quiet and it wasn't as spicy as Twitter whatsoever. I still spent some time there on Instagram. Yeah, there wasn't too much going on.
00:07:15.770 - 00:08:18.410, Speaker C: I would give my view was like, I kind of felt like it had this. The difference between crypto and web three is very much delineated between Twitter and Farcaster. I feel like toward the end of 2021, at the peak of the NFT bull market, there was sort of people who were like, I really like NFTs, but I don't like the Suzu tweeting about buying every art box thing type of thing. And all those people moved to Farcaster. And in some ways, I call it the TED said feature or bug, but the cult of toxic positivity sort of definitely exists within Farcaster. But interestingly enough, if you just look at the actual users compared to some of the other Twitter spinoffs like Blue sky and things like that, it had really good retention of its users because it really focused on this one user group of people who like things on chain but aren't just traders.
00:08:19.070 - 00:08:19.820, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:08:20.190 - 00:08:54.390, Speaker C: I think the interesting thing about how they've had this huge growth in the last few weeks, which is why we're talking about it, is they added an extensibility layer for programming your posts, and you can have games in your posts, you can have meme coins in your posts. And that sort of brought some of the crypto Twitter energy over in the sense of, which is why I guess you're getting spammed right now. And it's crazy. So maybe do you want to walk us through what frames are and if you were to Eli five frames?
00:08:54.810 - 00:09:23.038, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a great point. Yeah. So also, I think to your point of it being a community and anti spammy was that it was also permissioned. At that point, anybody couldn't just sign up. They had to basically DM the founders to get an invite to come on. And then this is a kudos to the team, is that they are maniacal about getting user feedback. So that kind of sets the stage to where we are today.
00:09:23.038 - 00:10:29.494, Speaker A: I think it was like two weeks ago. It feels like a year ago at this point, is that they launched Forecaster frames, which basically allow any developer, as Trin pointed out, to create an app that sits within the warpcast. I don't think it's on the protocol level, forecaster, but you can create an app the same way that Facebook had Farmville, those Buzzfeed quizzes that you could do within the Facebook app, or that Twitter, before it, used to have APIs with the polls, et cetera. So any developer can ultimately build a frame which is an app. Like, I even built it, and I'm not super technical to be able to accomplish whatever they want for me. I'm like, from a potential and utility of kind of, why does decentralized social matter or why does blockchain add value to kind of social networks? Is like, the potential is pretty insane if you think about it from an e commerce perspective. So you can basically just port around your social identity from one place to the next.
00:10:29.494 - 00:11:09.460, Speaker A: If you're doing event RSVP and the event ticket is an NFT. Very easy to be able to start layering on top of that. And then from a distribution, I'm forgetting who it was. But paragraph, if you guys are familiar with paragraph, kind of like a medium or a substac, kind of like web three version of it, can do, like subscribe right in a frame now where you don't have to link out to a paragraph newsletter in order to subscribe. It's just like the subscribe button within a cast. Somebody did Girl Scout cookie orders through a frame, which is also wild. You're like, wait, what? I can order Girl Scout cookies using my.
00:11:09.460 - 00:12:06.270, Speaker A: It's kind of like what Instagram shopping was, but no one's really been able to reimagine or revolutionize it in web three socials so far. And then to kind of like, those, to me are the inspiring, like, okay, this is utility. This is where you really start to get at the front of consumer crypto. And then also what you can do, and this is kind of like, if you hear me on warp cast right now, I'm kind of like being a little bit melodramatic about it, is that it's also because it's completely permissionless. Anybody can create a frame to do whatever they want to do. So what we've seen is this wild proliferation of recast and like this in order to be able to get a free mint. And so you'll see tons of people creating a free mint that ultimately it's an airdrop, right? Or you get the play this game and they make a really fun game, which I'm all for, fun on chain.
00:12:06.270 - 00:12:43.710, Speaker A: But then it's like, oh, you'll get this dgen. You'll get a degen token as a result. And so that is really exciting. And then kind of like this whole dgen token thing goes back to the original, is that when the forecaster community was like, 500 of us, there's this one crypto native artist, oxen, who at the time was just, like, doing farcaster stuff. He was like, this is really hard to make it as an artist, but I'm going to take a bet on the farcaster community, and they've treated me well, and I'm invested in them. And he's been grinding at this for, like, two years. And now he got involved with the dgen token.
00:12:43.710 - 00:13:02.840, Speaker A: All of a sudden, the dgen token is now tied somehow to his NFTs, and that's skyrocketing as well. And so when people see this opportunity to a you have a degen token that is skyrocketing in price. I think it might have dropped. Then you kind of attract everybody.
00:13:06.090 - 00:14:03.526, Speaker C: I think definitely the ability to insert memecoin into anything within the protocol is the number one reason I think you've seen this crazy growth, because there was sort of this huge airdrop sort of know, in the same way, like Jito kind of catalyzed all this stuff. This huge airdrop happened and everyone all of a sudden was like, oh, this is the easiest way to get distribution for a meme coin. Now, the interesting thing to me is, unlike when Facebook had apps or Twitter had apps, you can't really shut down this can't, you can't really shut down any of these apps. It is really, truly, the hub operators are validating this and making it kind of the state changes for it. There's no sort of like centralized company can say, stop this thing right now. So I think it will be kind of interesting as a distribution mechanism to a bunch of users who already know how to use crypto. They have a wallet and they're using this thing not just like, I own this NFT and it gets me into discord.
00:14:03.526 - 00:14:18.560, Speaker C: It really is like they are making content and kind of will this network effect be a good distribution mechanism? Like people keep distributing tokens or NFTs this way, or will it kind of turn into a new type of application?
00:14:20.210 - 00:15:00.170, Speaker B: Tarun, if I'm understanding correctly, with frames, right, so you're in Farcaster, you have your farcaster key with a frame. Basically what it does, if I'm understanding correctly, is you sign a or you derive a second key with your actual ethereum or forecaster key or whatever. So you can't actually spend money or do economic transactions in a frame. Basically, you can only sign something which is relatively inert, so you can't actually end up getting scammed or hacked or whatever using a frame. Is that correct?
00:15:00.320 - 00:15:32.550, Speaker A: Yes. But they did just allow you to now link out. So, for instance, Brandon Chow B Chow on it created a generative art mint where you can generate the art, and then when you're ready to mint whatever version you've gotten, it says ready to mint, and it will pop up a window that warns you like, hey, you are now leaving and will bring you to the page. However, on recent developer calls, it sounds like in frame transactions may be on the roadmap.
00:15:33.450 - 00:15:43.146, Speaker B: So how is that not like a massive security risk of having people clicking a button and being like, great, now you just paid some random dude all.
00:15:43.168 - 00:15:46.890, Speaker A: Your USDC I think that's a great question for Varun.
00:15:50.510 - 00:15:53.760, Speaker B: It seems like a very bad behavior to encourage in people.
00:15:54.290 - 00:15:59.822, Speaker C: Let's put this way, this week is about the users of Farcast. I think we'll have.
00:15:59.876 - 00:16:07.150, Speaker B: Okay, got it. All right, we'll get into that. We'll get into that, we'll get into that. Okay. Speaking of the users.
00:16:07.310 - 00:16:07.778, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:16:07.864 - 00:16:46.762, Speaker B: Okay, cool. We'll try to get some of the Farcaster founders on the show, maybe next week just for a sense of scale then. So Farcaster has grown from about 2000 roughly daily actives. It's ballooned within the last few days to something about 30,000 daily actives. So it's grown 15 x in just a few days now. In absolute terms, for a social network that's still pretty small, it's still like a very kind of fledgling network from social media perspective. But with this massive influx of users, what are these new users like? How has that changed the vibe of the network to 15 x overnight?
00:16:46.906 - 00:16:52.990, Speaker C: Haseeb is asking if there's a vibe session, which I'd say, or just a vibe shift.
00:16:55.250 - 00:17:33.578, Speaker A: Whenever new people enter a space, there's always a vibe shift. So I think there's multiple vibe shifts that have happened. And the first one was when frames launched. I don't know if I have ever seen a community so excited about a new feature ever. So they've been announced, like releasing new features. And I think any dev or builder who's listening to this, who is building on Farcaster, it isn't necessarily easy, right? Like balance between centralized kind of client on top of it and whatnot. And so when they released and distribution is the hardest thing, I think that's what we're all talking about here, is distribution.
00:17:33.578 - 00:18:24.430, Speaker A: And so when all of a sudden you have frames, the entire developer ecosystem was, I've never seen them so excited. There was a hackathon that weekend that was like in New York City, 40 people showed up, variant helped fund. It was incredible. And so that was like the first vibe ship was basically allowing, I would almost call it like a gift that the team gave to all the developers being like, hey, we know it's really hard to build your own client outside of forecaster, so here test and build and experiment within it or warp cast. So that was a vibe shift number one. And that's what really took off. Then I think really smart business move was when this started taking off, obviously some of the more spammy, or let's say very crypto Twitter esque tactics started emerging on frames.
00:18:24.430 - 00:18:57.442, Speaker A: There was a good business decision in that the team was like, okay, we have a lot of interest right now. Everyone's talking about frames. It's kind of trending on Twitter. Why don't we remove the payment wall to create an account? And we're just going to allow free sign ups, right? And so usually it's $7, something like that, to sign up. And I think that great business model, but kind of realizing, okay, a big blocker is a payment, it's $7 to.
00:18:57.516 - 00:18:59.930, Speaker B: Whom to sign up. That was a decentralized network.
00:19:04.110 - 00:19:34.606, Speaker A: I think I didn't have to pay because I was an early user. I got grandfathered in the first year. But you pay a protocol fee, I'm pretty sure, because they set up your custody address that holds your farcaster ID. And then there's also storage. I pay for storage because I care about my task. And then there's also a small gas fee that's covered as well. I don't know all the economics.
00:19:34.718 - 00:19:45.874, Speaker B: Are you like prepaying your storage rent or something? Who gets the $7 and how do you pay it? Do you pay it in dollars? Do you pay it in ETH, USBC or ETH?
00:19:45.922 - 00:19:47.158, Speaker C: I think you can do both.
00:19:47.324 - 00:19:48.600, Speaker D: Rune, do you pay?
00:19:48.970 - 00:20:42.954, Speaker C: Yeah, I think I paid when I created. So basically, the main philosophy of Farcaster, which I think as a design philosophy for software, is quite different than some of the other social networks have been attempted, is that only the ID component of the identity and the profile is stored on chain. So almost like using your ens, there's a sort of portable ID, then there's sort of an overlay network of these people who are running hubs. And you can almost think of like your on chain signing acts as an oauth to the overlay network. And once you get to the overlay network, which could be much more centralized or a small number of nodes or whatever, then those people are offering storage, making sure the state is synced and things like that. So it's sort of almost like two networks, one that has maximum decentralization as expensive and you have to pay for for the ID part, and then one.
00:20:42.992 - 00:20:50.266, Speaker B: That'S much less and that's more federated mastodon style. Like the actual content.
00:20:50.448 - 00:20:58.142, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. But it is one network. But you could make your own hub and fork if you want. So you could do the mastodon thing if you wanted.
00:20:58.276 - 00:21:03.280, Speaker B: I see, okay, so you pay, you pay to get the ID?
00:21:03.730 - 00:21:05.326, Speaker C: Yeah, less.
00:21:05.508 - 00:21:08.930, Speaker A: Okay, and then I pay for storage.
00:21:10.310 - 00:21:14.370, Speaker D: And it's storage of the content that you're creating. But not of anyone else's.
00:21:15.830 - 00:21:35.820, Speaker B: Right. Okay, interesting. Okay. So among the members of the show, so obviously, Tarun, I think also Tom, has been an early farcaster user. Robert and I are not. So we are the two boomers on the show who are not on. Why? I mean, especially given now Farcaster is kind of blowing up.
00:21:35.820 - 00:21:39.046, Speaker B: I'll ask you first, why are you not on Farcaster?
00:21:39.158 - 00:21:40.826, Speaker D: Well, before the show started, I asked.
00:21:40.848 - 00:21:45.550, Speaker C: To, by the way, that's a cheap cop out. You're just asking him first so you can copy his answers.
00:21:45.970 - 00:21:51.258, Speaker B: That is correct. That is correct. Yeah, well, I made the first move, the first mover advantage.
00:21:51.434 - 00:21:57.342, Speaker D: I'll be honest, I'm not a ultra early adopter. I'm like second wave.
00:21:57.486 - 00:22:08.342, Speaker B: That is not true. What are you talking about? You are totally an early adopter. Every time some random NFT or game launches, Robert's always like, hey, are you guys doing this random fucking djing thing that I just learned about?
00:22:08.476 - 00:22:20.786, Speaker A: Well, also, Robert, how often are you cast? I call it casting. Wow. I'm so Farcaster native, I don't even call it, like, tweeting. Like, how often are you posting on Twitter?
00:22:20.978 - 00:22:22.520, Speaker D: Once every couple.
00:22:25.210 - 00:22:40.670, Speaker A: You guys, if I had to make an answer for why you're not on Farcaster, it's probably because literally, up until right now, it was like less than 100,000 people who were on the platform when. Robert, I'm pretty sure you have more than 100,000 followers on Twitter a lot.
00:22:40.740 - 00:22:41.134, Speaker B: I do.
00:22:41.172 - 00:22:47.060, Speaker D: Which is a gravity to keeping me on that platform versus starting at zero again.
00:22:47.590 - 00:22:59.560, Speaker A: Exactly. And I think Tarun even came out and was like, the only reason I'm here is because Ted has told me to come here. So it's hard. Right.
00:23:00.090 - 00:23:19.674, Speaker C: I was honest about it, but then I started doing this thing where I started using my farcaster to write things that I didn't mind totally being public, but I didn't want telling the entire world immediately. And then I got in trouble for some of those, and some Twitter armies came after me. So I like the idea.
00:23:19.792 - 00:23:21.020, Speaker B: Came after you for your.
00:23:21.950 - 00:23:32.160, Speaker C: Yes, yes. My farcaster posts, the content shall not be named. You can go find it on the.
00:23:34.850 - 00:24:00.294, Speaker A: Like. Yeah. If Robert's like, hey, I have, like, I get access to what I want to access on my following already on Twitter. I understand why he might not want to pop over to warp cast or farcast or any client there. Right? Why put in the. So that's, that's like one reason. And then also it's like the switching costs is hard.
00:24:00.294 - 00:24:40.314, Speaker A: And I don't think, even for Warpcast, isn't my only social media. I think Turin said this at the beginning. When you're using social media and when we're so used to it nowadays, it's hard to form a new habit unless there's something about it that keeps pulling you back. And for me, that is a sense of community and the opportunity to be intellectually curious. And I think it's funny. Turns like, oh, the Twitter army came for me. I'm like, I have a channel on Warpcast that is exclusively for controversial topics and conversations where no one is ever going to come for me, no matter how politically incorrect an opinion.
00:24:40.314 - 00:25:48.726, Speaker A: And that's okay. And so for me, that's what my, so what is, and that's what my purpose is, in addition to kind of my larger beliefs about decentralized social, et cetera. But again, there's an activation energy, and then there's the distribution problem, which again, we were going back to vibe shift by allowing anybody to sign up for free as long as they have, I think, a phone number, and the phone number was really key to reduce more spam than what might be there. The forecaster team basically just scaled protocol by an insane amount, kind of pressure testing it, and then also because it's still relatively small, and I think this is the issue with threads or blue sky, mastodon, whatever, is that it's still, like, only 100,000 users. They are still very close to the users themselves and already know our pain points. So from a spam perspective, within one day, channel spam was pretty much addressed really quickly. Within two days, your main feed spam completely addressed.
00:25:48.726 - 00:26:22.150, Speaker A: And now today, they've completely solved some of the notification spam as well. So back to the point of they're kind of showing like, yes, this can be permissionless. And here are different ways in which we can, let's say, incentivize new behaviors that are way past the point of designing a solution for on other social media networks. And personally, that I think, like lens or mastodon or threads less so because it's tied to your Instagram identity, have kind of like dropped the ball on.
00:26:22.300 - 00:26:25.398, Speaker D: Can I interject one very elementary question?
00:26:25.564 - 00:26:26.326, Speaker A: Yes.
00:26:26.508 - 00:26:29.778, Speaker D: What is the difference between warp Caster and Farcaster?
00:26:29.874 - 00:26:54.306, Speaker A: Farcaster is the client and warp cast is the other way around. Yeah, I was like, so ten steps ahead of what I was saying. Farcaster is the protocol, and then Warpcast is the client on top of it. Same way that email is a protocol and Gmail or Yahoo Mail are the clients on top of it. That is the easiest way to describe it, I believe.
00:26:54.408 - 00:27:18.162, Speaker B: So warpcast is like by far the dominant client, and that's the one that the team itself, like the original founding team, maintains. Right. So bitcloud is kind of one of the, bitcloud is sort of more of a predecessor of friendtech. Let's say it's kind of more financialized than forecaster, which explicitly is kind of more pure social and less doesn't really have a financial.
00:27:18.226 - 00:27:20.178, Speaker C: But frames allow financialization.
00:27:20.274 - 00:27:24.678, Speaker B: Yes. In a kind of roundabout. I can vertical drop everywhere, nowhere near as intrinsic.
00:27:24.774 - 00:27:26.202, Speaker C: Yes, I can vertical drop you.
00:27:26.256 - 00:27:26.714, Speaker B: You can do that?
00:27:26.752 - 00:27:32.298, Speaker C: No, I get you to sign something with your public key, and now I know you're active.
00:27:32.394 - 00:27:35.854, Speaker B: Right. Well, with this delegated key. Right. Like not your actual ethereum key without.
00:27:35.892 - 00:27:37.870, Speaker C: But I can find the mapping.
00:27:39.410 - 00:27:40.158, Speaker B: Okay.
00:27:40.324 - 00:27:47.870, Speaker C: Yeah. The reason all the crypto degen traders joined Warpcast is because it started happening.
00:27:47.940 - 00:28:20.294, Speaker B: Yeah. They want those airdrops. Right. Okay. So it feels like there's two things happening here that I guess I'm curious about and want to poke at, and maybe we'll come back to this when we bring on one of the co founders. So the first thing is that it seems like a lot of what this big, massive growth on Farcaster has been airdrop farmers, is that a lot of people realize that now, especially the early addresses, like the first generation of Farcaster users are prime airdrop material. They're getting lots and lots of airdrops for just meme coins and random crazy whatever shit.
00:28:20.294 - 00:29:05.770, Speaker B: And so it feels a little bit like Celestia in that people realize that, okay, this set of token holders or this set of users is just going to be getting this whole cycle of airdrops. And so get on there so you can get all your airdrops, and the earlier the better, and just have some engagement so that you're airdrop ready. So this seems like one thing that's happening. I don't know how much of the behavior of the new influx of users is this, as opposed to people who actually want to hang out and join a community, but it seems like there's a lot of financially motivated people who are, yo, I'm here for the airdrop. So that seems like one thing that's happening, and not literally the farcaster airdrop, but as Tarun mentioned, all the other meme coins and other random dog shape.
00:29:07.630 - 00:29:56.118, Speaker C: The idea that frames make it easy. One thing people promised in 2021, which I always at that time thought was a little preposterous, but people were really like, oh, look, we have these high value NFT collections. We basically have free customer lists of who we should sell to, right? Like the Cole Christie's Yuga Labs diamond thing, right? Sorry, was it a punk? I know Leshner knows more about this type of stuff than I do, but whatever. The whole Tiffany's gave me that little logo, the little pendant, whatever, and you had to have it to buy. Like, everyone always talked about the customer being easier to find with NFTs, right? Like, they own this thing, they're part of this community. Like, oh, you should be able to market to them, whatever. That always seemed a little bit crazy because a lot of those people were purely speculating.
00:29:56.118 - 00:30:21.086, Speaker C: But I think the interesting thing about farcasters, it started explicitly non financial, opposite of frontech, opposite of bitcloud, and then added this thing where you can write your own code that does enough, just barely enough on chain activity in terms of a signature, that you make it easy to do these kind of like airdrops for social things. And that seems more likely like a target. You could almost use that for marketing.
00:30:21.278 - 00:31:04.030, Speaker A: If it takes you. What's his name, Antonio's spindle did a whole blog post on how you can be thinking about frames in terms of most. They also have a frames dashboard that you can go through and see how many people have liked this? How many people have recasted this, you can go through. And you're right, people are using this as a marketing mechanism in a way. But then, to your point, it has introduced this financialization. If you look at some of the frames, and this was my plight, I'm like, I really care about these utility frames and more. So, like, okay, how can we bring this into.
00:31:04.030 - 00:31:13.746, Speaker A: I guess it's like the more of the web three vision. Most of them are like dgen machines, literally. It's like a slot machine frame where you pull the slot and you end up.
00:31:13.768 - 00:31:33.482, Speaker C: I mean, it is. Crypto is really oroboros, right? It's like every cycle there's another dice, Satoshi dice that comes out in some form. There's like an ether roll that comes out. All these gambling games, if you give enough programmability, they immediately show up, which is like, that's crazy, right?
00:31:33.616 - 00:32:08.290, Speaker A: And I think the important distinction, too. And why, again, let's say all of the users who just came on are only there for the airdrop. We've all seen this happen. Airdrop farmers come, and then they go, right? They don't stick around unless they think there's something worth sticking around for. And some of them may all that to say also with the growth, I think really Twitter celebrities, I don't know what else to call them, have also joined Farcaster. Like, oh, wow, this is actually really interesting. And they're staying now or returning, whereas they wouldn't before.
00:32:08.290 - 00:33:03.042, Speaker A: I remember I used to be like, oh, there's like a churned user. And the Farcaster team would tell me and they would be like, no, there's no such thing as churned users. It's just a potential user. It's a potential recapture, which I think was smart to say. But going back to the design of it, again, I think the difference between friendtech or like Bitcloud is who was the team behind creating that financialization, and it was the team who was developing everything. And I think what the Farcaster team has done really intentionally and really well was that they always designed from a place of kind of like permissionless and also avoiding the fact that they don't talk about a token ever. You will see them say repeatedly, we have no plans to launch a token.
00:33:03.042 - 00:34:19.326, Speaker A: So like they kind of remove a lot of the financialization in which you can then start to get at like, okay, why are people actually coming to use this if we're removing a lot of the financial incentives there, even their own internal peer to peer payment, is the concept of, it's this thing called a warp, where the way it started is they started dishing out warps as a reward if you were posting good content, if you invited users that converted, if you led a channel. So they were using warps as like a reward mechanism, and you're like, oh, that sounds a little bit like points. And the difference is that warps are actually not at all like points because you can't move them out of the app. So basically you can either buy sounds like points to me, but you buy warps, like 100 warps is one dollars, you can decide to buy it or you get gifted it. And the way that warps are used is really only two ways, is a, you can gift them to another user. So if people, let's say, comment really thoughtful things on some of my content, I will gift them warps as like a thank you. It's like a nice gift and you can send a note with it.
00:34:19.326 - 00:35:02.486, Speaker A: And then the other way you use them is that warps can be used to mint NFTs. So like purely utility. So like, oh, use 500 warps to mint this NFT or use 800 warps to sign up for this other forecaster app instead of having to pay the sign up fee. And so there's no speculation with it, there's no price discovery. It's always 100 warps is one dollars. And that is what it is. And so I think the team taking a very intentional approach about that and being like, we're not going to design a kind of decentralized social network around financialization and speculation has a led them to take a step back.
00:35:02.486 - 00:35:41.018, Speaker A: And even right now, they're not focused on frames or building different frames. The developers are doing all of that on their own, like the builder ecosystem. They're focused on how do we address the spam issue, how do we continue to grow, how do we fix notifications for people, et cetera. And I think that's why a lot of people have stuck around and continued to be here despite the influx of spam, because there's this huge sense of trust for the team to continue building in a way that's like purely value add for the user in a way that's not financially motivated. That was a long no.
00:35:41.184 - 00:35:49.820, Speaker B: I think it's a very good insight about what makes farcaster so different from a lot of the other experiments in decentralized social.
00:35:50.290 - 00:36:31.050, Speaker C: Well, I also think oftentimes on this podcast, we talk about things from the lens of the people building them or the financial lens or what have you. But I do feel like there are very few products in crypto where I could actually be like, hey, I want to hear from a super user that really loves the thing and could give you. And I feel like this is one of the only products where you can say that. Maybe sometimes people would say some of the defi stuff for people who live off of that, they will be like, but they don't have the attachment in the same way. It's like a totally different experience. And what other consumer crypto thing has superfans?
00:36:31.550 - 00:36:50.382, Speaker A: I mean, the super fandom is crazy. Well, first off, it started small. We would host Farcaster meetups and Internet strangers. I don't know, I was on the Internet a lot growing up, but I never met people from the Internet. And now I would say, I consider.
00:36:50.436 - 00:36:52.638, Speaker C: That is what your parents tell you not to do, right?
00:36:52.724 - 00:36:53.360, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:36:54.850 - 00:36:56.480, Speaker C: They used to tell you not to.
00:36:57.190 - 00:37:31.802, Speaker A: Everyone tells you not to do it. And now I would consider some of my best friends today, people who I met from forecaster who've just like, I've continued to see or continued to build friendship with, which is super nuts. But the thing that is the most nuts is last year there was like a far conference, or Farcon is what we call it. Completely decentralized. The Farcaster team had no involvement in planning it, doing anything. It was like fully grassroots, and 100 people showed up. And then this year, someone was like, oh, I want to do it in LA, Ted, help me out.
00:37:31.802 - 00:38:42.382, Speaker A: And so I just kind of, like, raised my hand and said I would do it. There are 600 applications that already came in of people who are willing to fly all the way to LA, pay a $200 ticket price and hang out for, like, five days with other forecasters exclusively. And we understand when we think about ETH Denver today, yeah, it's huge. But what was it back in 2018? I don't know, but the fact that this small ecosystem has people, the reason I was on Farcaster and the herb cast in the first place when tour and messaged me was because I was responding to all these requests of people being like, can I come? Can I get on the list months in advance? It's not until May, and people are losing it. And so there is, I don't want to call, like, a cult following, but I think it's managed to bring together builders, consumers, and just like a really interesting dynamic mix of people. Also, with the introduction, I think you called it at the beginning, you were like, oh, it's like Twitter. I think a year ago was exclusively a Twitter comparison.
00:38:42.382 - 00:39:11.686, Speaker A: And now I would say it's a mix of Twitter and Reddit because they have channels. So think of channels as subreddits. And so the best way I can describe this in terms of who's on this platform and how is it interesting and dynamic and different is that there's a food channel. Like, everyone loves cooking, whatever. Not everyone, but people like food. And then all of a sudden, this guy Giuseppe starts posting photos of different things he's doing. He's going to the farmers market, et cetera.
00:39:11.686 - 00:40:00.730, Speaker A: And we ask him, we're like, oh, you seem to cook a lot. What do you do? Ends up he was a chef at a Michelin store restaurant in Napa and is a professional chef and has worked everywhere. And now he kind of like, you get access to someone who you'd never have access like that before. And so the food community is really strong on warp cast right now due to this channel where you're able to go and then find people who you instantly have a connection or shared interest with and communicate about that specific shared interest. So the discoverability helps with channels. And I think the way you can do it is find your community in a way in which you go to channels and there's an channel. So think about all those people who never would have hung out otherwise are now like, okay, let's talk about things.
00:40:00.730 - 00:40:06.970, Speaker A: And there's a book club that we do potluck now. And so it did start as a Twitter.
00:40:07.050 - 00:40:11.934, Speaker C: It is a real community, unlike a lot of crypto communities with.
00:40:12.052 - 00:40:42.154, Speaker B: That's the thing that really jumps out of me about Farcaster, and I think it's true of lens as well, is that these two communities, they really have a soul at the center of it. And that's actually quite rare in crypto. A lot of the things decentralized social is very, very old. I think the first thing that I can remember, what was the thing that Justin sun acquired, Victorrent. What was it called? No, it was one of the many things he acquired. No, the one that tried to kick him out. Like they try to steam or steam it.
00:40:42.154 - 00:41:25.442, Speaker B: Steam it, steam it, steam it, steam it. So steam it is like super og decentralized social. It was one of the ones where if you get upvoted a lot, you get paid in Steam tokens and you can make money by being very social. And then, of course, there's bitcloud and bitcloud, which has become diesel, and there's a bunch of friend tech. Obviously, there have been many different plays at trying to create these decentralized social that integrate money in some way. I think the difficulty that most of these platforms run into is that they tend not to have a soul. That's the best way I can describe it, is like, it's hard to kind of put into, well, you can talk about the incentives and the race to the bottom and blah, blah, blah.
00:41:25.442 - 00:41:36.140, Speaker B: But I think the easiest way to encapsulate that is that there is not this beating heart at the center of just people who are in it for the love of the game, who are just like, I just want to build an awesome community.
00:41:37.790 - 00:42:24.266, Speaker C: I think there's definitely some truth to that for both lens and Farcaster. I think they've just attracted two very different types of initial users. Farcaster's initial users are like, they remind me. It reminds me so, like 15 years ago, I remember I was like a very early user of quora and I did the same thing you're talking about where after a year I started going to meetups and meeting people and whatever, and it was like, oh, there was this level of curiosity in the early stage of popper and people weren't afraid of asking questions and looking dumb in public. And I think Farcaster has that, whereas I feel like lens is going more for the vibes type of play. It's like a totally different type of person. But they both are.
00:42:24.266 - 00:42:28.010, Speaker C: Yeah, like you said, both seem to care a lot about their community.
00:42:28.160 - 00:43:04.406, Speaker A: Yeah, it's interesting. I'd love to hear your perspective on lens because I think lens, again, I have a big distribution. I don't know what my follower count is, but I have a good distribution platform on Forecaster. But everyone says lens is a great platform for distribution, for content. So there's tons of interesting apps built on top of it, et cetera. They really built it on like, oh, this is where creators can monetize in a way. And so I went to that platform and it just wasn't for me.
00:43:04.406 - 00:43:47.400, Speaker A: I couldn't get it. It was kind of clunky. And I was like, why do I have to make a transaction every time I want to post something? Whereas for me, I value as a user, and again, I approach all crypto consumer applications just as consumer applications. That's always what I approach it as. And I'm like, is this a good consumer app? How does this compare? I kind of try to remove the crypto from it, and I care about dialogue and connection, and that's what Farcaster's value proposition to me was. Whereas lens was like, we can help our creators monetize. And I was like, well, I don't consider myself a creator, so that actually doesn't appeal to me.
00:43:47.400 - 00:44:40.182, Speaker A: And I think if you think about social media generally, if you look across platforms, only 1% of users are actually creating content, 9% of users are engaging with that content. And then 90% of users, the remaining 90%, are just lurking. Right? Think about how many Reddit lurkers you know. And so I don't know how much value proposition of like, oh, we allow creators to monetize. That speaks to a very small slice of everybody who's using social media, where if you're like, hey, do you care about building community or meeting like minded people or kind of like participating in a new social media? Whatever the value proposition is to you, that to me about Farcaster, that's actually the soul I think you're getting at. Whereas with lens, again, I don't know what. I don't know because I'm not on it.
00:44:40.316 - 00:44:43.320, Speaker B: Okay, yeah, let's not talk shit about lens without anybody.
00:44:44.730 - 00:44:46.806, Speaker A: I can't comment on it because I know it's fine.
00:44:46.828 - 00:44:50.278, Speaker B: I mean, your team farcaster, embrace that?
00:44:50.444 - 00:44:57.866, Speaker C: Yeah, Lens also just, they have an equally passionate community. They actually, the interesting thing is, like, Farcaster seems way more us centric and.
00:44:57.888 - 00:45:10.554, Speaker B: Lens is like, yeah, that's the way. Overwhelming impression. Yeah. Farcaster is like very know, that's, that's like my California. California.
00:45:10.602 - 00:45:22.718, Speaker A: Let's say like lens has the coolest branding. At East Denver last year, like Lens's swag, I was like, I want that. Forecaster is never going to do that unless me and some of the designers.
00:45:22.814 - 00:45:28.102, Speaker C: I just meant the users. The users are kind of. The users are like, yeah.
00:45:28.156 - 00:45:52.166, Speaker B: It's also like disproportionately like smart developer, engineer, the early user base. Whereas I feel like for lens, it was more kind of more global, more just like anyone who's excited about crypto, decentralization, decentralized social. That's my impression. But again, I have a very low resolution picture.
00:45:52.358 - 00:46:09.390, Speaker C: I have a question for you. So if we maybe make this posit, this kind of statement that unlike social networks in web two, maybe web three social networks are inherently more regionalized, potentially. How come we haven't seen like an east asian web three social network?
00:46:09.470 - 00:46:12.420, Speaker A: Dude, farcaster right now is east asian social.
00:46:15.270 - 00:46:20.862, Speaker B: I'm sure the new generation of airdrop farmers. Yeah, 100% users.
00:46:20.926 - 00:46:43.854, Speaker A: That's where they're coming from. And yeah, I think it's interesting because, I don't know, you have to go into the channels and these are being. It's a social media platform. Unless it's like an Instagram, where it's purely aesthetic and visual. The first language that you're building in is English. Right. Most of the developers or most of the builders are building in English, and it's a text based platform up front.
00:46:43.854 - 00:47:09.906, Speaker A: So I think it is going to be a little bit regionalized. I do think with channels that are country specific, you can kind of start to build more of a community on a platform that way. But again, I don't have an answer. But I do know that if you look at the hub distribution, and again, hubs are like the data validators, they're very global. It's not just like only the US where the hubs are operating.
00:47:10.018 - 00:47:58.450, Speaker B: Sure. Yeah. If you look at sort of web two social networks, like normal social networks, it's very clear that social networks have regionalized to a large extent, although there are obviously Facebook is massive, and some of these Instagram whatever, they're obviously very international. But then you have things like Vcontacta in Russia, you have WeChat and a bunch of other platforms in China. So it is not the case that it's totally uniform. But you do have these super platforms, and obviously anybody's in anglophone market is going to be using the anglophone products, which is largely Facebook and Instagram and so on. I don't think we've seen the same level of regionalization in crypto, in large part because crypto is largely anglophone outside of China.
00:47:58.450 - 00:48:08.498, Speaker B: If you want to use crypto products, because a lot of crypto is about making money. And if you want to make money, you got to be early. And if you want to be early, you got to speak English, unfortunately, or you got to be.
00:48:08.524 - 00:48:15.254, Speaker C: Wait a minute. I don't know. I understand what that agree with that last statement.
00:48:15.302 - 00:48:21.866, Speaker B: No, it's just the case that a lot of this content does not get translated into others. I don't know.
00:48:21.888 - 00:48:25.146, Speaker C: Justin's on this crypto trader, defi Farmer, and I will tell.
00:48:25.168 - 00:48:29.098, Speaker B: Yes, he speaks English. What are you talking about? Yeah, he speaks English.
00:48:29.194 - 00:48:34.206, Speaker C: But my point is, team who does it does not really speak great mean.
00:48:34.228 - 00:48:48.450, Speaker B: That's. But like. But the point is, know, if you're trading crypto in mean, you're at least translating stuff that's in English. You're on Twitter, because that's where a lot of the news happens. That's where a lot of the most important information is getting disseminated.
00:48:49.930 - 00:48:52.354, Speaker D: For the record, Google Chrome will translate.
00:48:52.402 - 00:48:53.590, Speaker C: Pretty much any web page.
00:48:53.660 - 00:49:07.654, Speaker B: Yeah. To be clear, it's not that hard to translate stuff. But the reality is, if you're going into a lot of these markets where English is not the primary language, most of crypto content is in English. And so it just is this strong force.
00:49:07.702 - 00:49:23.350, Speaker C: So this gets back to my question of like, will there be, let's say, chinese, just standard. There be. What other country is like the easiest, let's say Indonesia.
00:49:23.450 - 00:49:24.414, Speaker A: Easy. Singapore.
00:49:24.462 - 00:49:24.926, Speaker B: Indonesia.
00:49:24.958 - 00:49:28.626, Speaker C: Yeah, sure, sure. Indonesia. Because you want English speaking.
00:49:28.728 - 00:49:37.026, Speaker B: Yeah. Are you asking will there be a separate hub for Indonesia, or will there be a totally separate network for.
00:49:37.128 - 00:49:48.082, Speaker C: Well, no, I mean, it might be a separate network that is part of the Farcastern network. Right. Like, someone forks a hub and they regionalize a hub and some of the content gets crossed.
00:49:48.146 - 00:49:52.330, Speaker B: I guess I don't totally understand what the difference is between a hub and.
00:49:52.480 - 00:49:59.482, Speaker A: Okay, a hub is just like, breaks down. A hub is like what keeps the protocol running. So I don't know enough about.
00:49:59.536 - 00:50:03.414, Speaker B: That's just like a server that's just like a data center, someone hosting data.
00:50:03.552 - 00:50:06.154, Speaker A: It's all the underlying infrastructure.
00:50:06.282 - 00:50:09.134, Speaker B: It's just going to lower latency for somebody who's in.
00:50:09.332 - 00:51:03.150, Speaker A: No, no, I think it's like, for instance, warpcast. This is like what we're talking about decentralized social. You know, like, when Instagram goes down, everyone's like, on Twitter being like, is Instagram down? Is Instagram down? And you don't have anything. The thing with yesterday, recently, with all this influx of users, Warpcast has had a hard time validating their data and retrieving their data from the hubs, meaning Warpcast has gone down. And if that happened to a web two social app, you can't do anything. You just wait for the centralized team to put it back up. What the beauty of Farcaster is, because it's a decentralized network, there's another client that's not workcast called Supercast, where if you went and logged on to supercast with your account, so, like, you have the same again, you create your forecaster ID, you log in there.
00:51:03.150 - 00:51:27.510, Speaker A: Even though Warpcast is down, you can still log in and see all the same content in real time, because supercast is pulling the same data from those hubs. And so that's the beauty, and that's the true decentralization in effect of Farcaster, is that even though the major client is down, you're still able to go and access all of the data that's in the network.
00:51:29.930 - 00:51:46.414, Speaker B: But what would be the point of having a hub in a different geography? Because the hub is just a place where they're storing data, but they're not localizing, they're not doing anything that's going to be transparent to the user. The user is just like, wow, my data is somewhere in Farcaster. I don't really know where it is.
00:51:46.452 - 00:52:11.574, Speaker A: I don't think there's necessarily a point. That's a great question, and I don't know if there's a point. You're like, oh, what's the value proposition? I don't think it's necessary, but I do think if you look at a map, I just think it speaks to the decentralization and the globalization of it, when you see that hubs are everywhere and not just confined to one country. So again, it's not a necessity. But to answer your question, I have.
00:52:11.612 - 00:52:42.270, Speaker C: An idea for why you would want separate hubs. Which is, suppose each of the Farcaster say zones. I'll call them a zone. Let's just suppose that they have some way of communicating with each other. Like Mastodon, they each generated fees of some form. So, like, frames, maybe generated fees that remitted. And you may want to actually allocate different amounts of capital that, say, backing these hubs to different regions.
00:52:42.270 - 00:52:49.810, Speaker C: The indonesian fork is generating a certain amount of fees and maybe people are staking eventually to run hubs.
00:52:50.310 - 00:52:52.354, Speaker A: Yeah, you could imagine that.
00:52:52.392 - 00:52:53.650, Speaker C: Something like that.
00:52:53.800 - 00:53:38.206, Speaker A: Yeah. There is a company called Nanar. It's kind of like Neymar, but they basically have created a way to make running hubs a business. And so what they do is that a developer can pay them like $9 a month and basically they get access to all of the hubs because each hub gets like an API. So it makes it easy to be able to call and return all the data from the network. And so they've been able to scale it. And I think Tarun, to your point is like, oh, why is it important if other countries have it? You can imagine if Nanar is running 90% of the hubs, that makes you question like, okay, what if Nanar decides to be a bad actor? They won't.
00:53:38.206 - 00:54:08.278, Speaker A: I trust them. But I think that's a good point. And of course they're making fees somehow from the developers paying them. But I think to go back is because again, I just described, anyone can build a client on top of it. Nothing is stopping Indonesia, like, let's say a fun, smart social entrepreneur in Indonesia from building a social media app on top of Farcaster. So someone can do that and all indonesian users.
00:54:08.374 - 00:54:38.070, Speaker B: That makes me, let me ask you guys this, taking a step back from Farcaster and all the details, because I want to get back to this thing about kind of social media habits because I think that's part of the story about Farcaster. Decentralized social is like changing people's relationship with social media socially and culturally. That's the big vision, right? That's what a lot of people get excited about with decentralized social. Let me ask you this real quick. How many of you guys use threads?
00:54:39.450 - 00:54:42.360, Speaker D: I used it the day it came out, and I don't think since.
00:54:44.170 - 00:54:44.920, Speaker A: People.
00:54:45.290 - 00:55:01.898, Speaker C: I go on it once a week mainly go on thread still. No, I don't produce content because it's a lot of my friends who are like, I went to high school with or college with, who are boring as shit and have families in the suburbs, and they are.
00:55:01.984 - 00:55:03.506, Speaker B: Why do you keep going on thread?
00:55:03.558 - 00:55:21.730, Speaker C: Because they actually write more content than their Instagram is like too curated. And it's actually an interesting way to see people from high school for me, because to them, it's their first ever text based social network that they've started using. Yeah, but it's a niche reason.
00:55:21.880 - 00:56:01.962, Speaker A: I think if threads was in the Instagram app, I would use it way more. But I don't use it and I don't really post any content there. But I think, again, this speaks to the reason to ruin your on it is because the people that you grew up with and know are there, right? It goes back to like, oh, these are my people. This is my, like, I'm interested in what they're doing and they're not posting on Instagram, but I care about what they're posting. So I just think that's interesting. And I also agree that Instagram has everyone thinking about curated feeds and what should I appear to look like versus.
00:56:02.106 - 00:56:45.918, Speaker C: Exactly, I think threads. Newsfeed also is clearly gated in. The algorithm is clearly about only showing you content that you're going to agree with, whereas Twitter is only showing you content you disagree with. Its engagement model is like that. And the problem is you have what I call the cult of toxic positivity effect of like, oh, you only see these things where everyone is wag meing themselves. But the other thing is Facebook as a company, I guess, culturally doesn't understand how to make an algorithm that isn't, like, isn't tuned to only show you this little walled garden that you want to see yourself in. And I think text based stuff doesn't work that way.
00:56:45.918 - 00:56:47.726, Speaker C: You kind of can't do that the.
00:56:47.748 - 00:56:51.306, Speaker B: Way Instagram is pretty boring. Yeah, it's pretty boring.
00:56:51.338 - 00:57:05.860, Speaker C: Just read content on thread is such dog shit because of this. Because you write one word and you'll only see that content, it doesn't give you any opposing content. And in some sense, their curation is their problem to me.
00:57:06.550 - 00:57:25.786, Speaker B: Yeah, people often go on criticism of social media is about echo chambers. But in a way, an echo chamber maybe is healthier than just reading. There's an echo chamber in the sense that you're reading only content that you agree with or only content from your side. That's actually pretty boring because, like, oh, yeah, I agree with that. I agree with that.
00:57:25.808 - 00:57:26.394, Speaker A: I agree with that.
00:57:26.432 - 00:57:48.946, Speaker B: Right. But actually, you'd need something to push back against in order to actually feel like, oh, shit, okay, this thing surprised me. This thing pisses me off. You feel some kind of engagement. So I never used threads at all, and I was horrified that I might actually have to try it if enough people were, like, leaving Twitter, as I.
00:57:48.968 - 00:58:05.910, Speaker C: Was kind of like, all these brands that pay influencers have threads where they talk about their influence, and Facebook's clearly learning their newsfeed is horrible. All it does is fucking show you repurposed ads.
00:58:08.990 - 00:58:22.278, Speaker B: Point. The point of this was not for us. To dunk on threads. I just wanted to bring it back to talk about social more broadly. No, it's fine. Very strong feelings. Very strong feelings about threads.
00:58:22.278 - 00:58:41.330, Speaker B: I did not realize what I was tapping into here, but I guess the thing that I wanted to try to explore is, like, your relationship with new social networks. That was kind of the thing that I was trying to get at. Linda, friend of the show, has been trying to get me on threads forever.
00:58:42.070 - 00:58:43.490, Speaker C: No, on threads.
00:58:45.670 - 00:58:52.980, Speaker B: Sorry. I'm moving slow. I'm moving slow. Sorry. Let me take a second. Let me take a second. You guys are riling me up.
00:58:52.980 - 00:59:20.762, Speaker B: She was trying to get me on Farcaster for a long time, and obviously, Linda, she's dedicated herself. She's trying to build a startup on top of, so she's, she's very engaged in the community. She's been trying to get me on Farcaster for quite a while. I guess I'm somewhat like Robert, although Robert thinks he's more like Robert than he actually is. I think Robert's actually a super elite adopter of stuff. I'm very much a late adopter in that, and it's part of the reason why I'm a terrible VC when it comes to social or consumer.
00:59:20.826 - 00:59:28.158, Speaker C: This is why you're in crypto, because you're such a late adopter. You can't be bottom decile if you're in crypto.
00:59:28.334 - 00:59:34.894, Speaker B: I'm definitely bottom quartile on consumer. Right? I'm definitely bottom quartile on consumer. Okay, for consumer.
00:59:34.942 - 00:59:36.020, Speaker C: Maybe I buy that.
00:59:36.390 - 01:00:05.600, Speaker B: Yeah, for consumer. I don't like using new products. Right. It's just not my thing. And the thing is, when I was younger, it was very different. I think when I was in my early 20s or even when I was a teenager, I loved being part of communities and being super active and engaged and meeting new people and friends and content and blah, blah, blah. What you guys are describing is exactly what I would be spending all my time on if I was, like, 19 years old, stuck in Texas on the Internet, like, way too much.
01:00:05.600 - 01:00:51.760, Speaker B: That was like, my upbringing was joining these small communities and being contributing and trying to be a part of a new vibe. Now I'm like, fucking old and boring, and I'm just like, I see Twitter as this big gladiatorial, just, like fucking war zone. And anytime I post anything on there, I was like, great, I'm ready to fight. Let's go. And the idea of this kumbaya, wonderful place where everyone's nice, I'm like, oh, what's the point? Of that. So I think if Farcaster really gets to a scale where I'm like, okay, in order for me to continue to have to be a part of the conversation, I need to be on Farcaster. That would be the thing that would get me to go there.
01:00:51.760 - 01:00:54.990, Speaker B: But, yeah, I think I'll.
01:00:55.650 - 01:00:59.050, Speaker A: More controversy, more confrontation, more differing.
01:00:59.130 - 01:01:09.650, Speaker B: Yeah, it's like if I felt like the most important conversation is happening there and I'm missing it on Twitter. Twitter is just like the unwashed masses of just djens and, I don't know, nft flippers, if that's what it's.
01:01:10.070 - 01:01:15.540, Speaker C: And journalists, I mean, Twitter really started from journalists. And I feel like that's still its main.
01:01:16.070 - 01:01:55.538, Speaker A: Like, personally, I agree with, like, right now, I would say Farcaster is operating much more like a social network than social media. And I think a lot of the confrontation that you're like, oh, this is really interesting, and I want the spice and I want to go to war and I want to fight for my ideas. That happens a lot once we get to social media scale. And going back to what do I feel about Web two? Social is that there's no platform that does both. So Snapchat, Gen Z is using Snapchat like no other because it's a messaging platform for them. They've used it exclusively for messaging. That is a social network that is not social media.
01:01:55.538 - 01:02:57.150, Speaker A: Whereas Instagram, all of that advertising, all of that kind of BS, that's purely social media. Now, I think some of the messaging and stories is more social network. So I hear you. And I think wherecast is right now, it's still in the social network phase, and it will not hit social media phase until it does have a million active users. Right? Otherwise, it doesn't make sense for any news platform, et cetera, to go there. That being said, I think it's worthwhile right now to start building your audience there and at least having an account and doing that because, of course, I'm on the show because I'm a super user and a super fan is like, I fundamentally believe that the team can scale it to be a million active users, 100 million active users, and it will get there. But I agree, until it's at that level, it's not a social media platform where you're going to be finding the latest and greatest news.
01:02:57.150 - 01:03:07.926, Speaker A: When OpenAI happened, everyone was just taking screenshots from Twitter and posting screenshots on Forecaster. Granted, I liked my conversations more on Farcaster, but yeah.
01:03:08.108 - 01:03:20.714, Speaker C: So I think a funny thing, know, given the success of the Trump NFTs. I can imagine that there'll be a Fox News airdrop on Farcaster of what?
01:03:20.912 - 01:03:22.540, Speaker B: What? Why?
01:03:23.410 - 01:03:35.858, Speaker C: Just because I think this idea that frames our platform can't kick you out. You can airdrop anyone, and if you're shameless enough, you'll do it. I could see that combo happening.
01:03:35.944 - 01:03:41.490, Speaker B: Sorry. And you're saying that Fox News is going to airdrop tokens to users.
01:03:41.830 - 01:03:45.300, Speaker C: That's a sign of success. If Farcaster makes it, that's going to happen.
01:03:46.790 - 01:03:53.814, Speaker B: All right. I don't know how you got from where you started in that sentence to where you ended, but I'll take that as a, I guess what I'm saying.
01:03:53.852 - 01:04:02.634, Speaker C: Is media, if I think about the Facebook versing of Fight. So that's sort of the first platform deplatforming of a similar thing.
01:04:02.672 - 01:04:02.826, Speaker B: Right?
01:04:02.848 - 01:04:33.202, Speaker C: Like Facebook had this application layer, the biggest application on there started making a bunch of money. Facebook was like, fuck you, we're going to restrict your thing. And then they had to come to some agreement here. You don't really have that. And I think if you think about the media in general, their number one complaint and why they're suing open AI and whatever is like, oh, they want some remuneration for this content they're creating somehow indirectly. Well, guess what? This is a great way to get it for them. So that's where I got to the understand.
01:04:33.336 - 01:04:43.926, Speaker B: I still don't understand what you're saying, but okay, we're at time, so we have to wrap. But Ted, I'm very on Twitter or.
01:04:43.948 - 01:04:46.470, Speaker C: Farcaster to roast your prediction.
01:04:47.050 - 01:04:50.786, Speaker B: Okay. All right, great. If they understand what you just predicted, they might be able to.
01:04:50.828 - 01:05:16.942, Speaker A: No, I actually think you're right, but I don't think people who it's happening to will think of it as I got an airdrop from Fox News. I think they'll think, oh, I got a membership perk from Fox News. I think in the way that Warpcast is being built in Farcaster, that it will just be the same web, two language, but behind kind of the scenes, it's the quote unquote airdrop. Right.
01:05:17.076 - 01:05:41.378, Speaker B: Well, we'll see next time. Hopefully we're going to have one of the co founders of Forecaster to come on the show. And so we'll be able to go a little more deep into the weeds and maybe even some of the philosophy behind why building decentralized social. But it's a really big topic and we're really glad to have your perspective. Ted, as an early supporter, a super fan, a super user. Super user. Where can people find you? On Farcaster at Ted.
01:05:41.554 - 01:05:42.358, Speaker A: That's that.
01:05:42.444 - 01:05:42.998, Speaker B: Oh, easy.
01:05:43.084 - 01:05:46.214, Speaker C: Also, Farcon invites went out today.
01:05:46.332 - 01:05:51.246, Speaker A: Yeah, all the Farcon invites went out today. All those 500 plus people. But it's in LA.
01:05:51.348 - 01:05:57.758, Speaker B: If you want to join those 500 people, hit up at Ted on Farcaster. Ted, thanks for joining us.
01:05:57.844 - 01:05:58.558, Speaker A: Thanks, guys.
01:05:58.644 - 01:05:59.850, Speaker B: Next week. Bye.
