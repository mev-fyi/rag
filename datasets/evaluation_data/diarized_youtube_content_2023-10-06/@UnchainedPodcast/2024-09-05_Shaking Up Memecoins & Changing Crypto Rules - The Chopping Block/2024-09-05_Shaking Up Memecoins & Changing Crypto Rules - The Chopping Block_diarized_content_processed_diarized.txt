00:00:00.240 - 00:00:32.312, Speaker A: I think one beautiful thing about crypto is you can actually have the game change at the same time as the players change the strategy. So it's like, imagine playing chess, and as you're playing chess, somehow you can remove one piece from the board, and now, all of a sudden, there's a hole on the board and you have to avoid that piece. And a lot of financial applications are inherently like this. Whenever there's a regime shift in finance, that's the same thing as someone poking a hole in the chessboard and saying, oh, you can't use that spot anymore.
00:00:32.416 - 00:00:33.368, Speaker B: Not a dividend.
00:00:33.464 - 00:00:34.552, Speaker A: It's a tale of Tuqwan.
00:00:34.616 - 00:00:37.320, Speaker C: Now. Your losses are on someone else's balance sheet.
00:00:37.400 - 00:00:39.840, Speaker B: Generally speaking, airdrops are kind of pointless anyways.
00:00:40.000 - 00:00:42.792, Speaker C: I named trading firms who were very involved.
00:00:42.896 - 00:00:45.416, Speaker A: Alec eth is the ultimate defi.
00:00:45.448 - 00:00:58.814, Speaker C: Protocols are the antidote to this problem. Hello, everybody. Welcome to the chopping block. Every couple of weeks, the three of us get together and give the industry insiders perspective on the crypto topics of the day. So, quick intro. So you got Tom, the defi maven and master of memes.
00:00:58.982 - 00:00:59.890, Speaker B: Hello, everyone.
00:01:01.030 - 00:01:08.166, Speaker C: Fortunately, Robert could not make it today. He had a family emergency. So we've got Tarun, the cube brain, and grand poo bot gauntlet.
00:01:08.358 - 00:01:10.890, Speaker A: I'm only here because of the emergency. Amazing.
00:01:13.110 - 00:01:24.198, Speaker C: I received the head hike man of Dragonfly. Tarun, you've got to be both the giga brain as well as the crypto connoisseur today, okay? So we're going to need you to bring the. Bring the thunder. With respect to meme coins and nfts.
00:01:24.294 - 00:01:39.600, Speaker A: As we saw last week, I think the main thing is there's two things that will get me to stare at the ceiling, and those two things are Rwas that aren't just government bonds or cash. And regulation.
00:01:40.380 - 00:01:45.892, Speaker C: Well, this is perfect. This is the regulation super episode we're going to be talking about. Only regulation today.
00:01:46.036 - 00:01:49.156, Speaker A: Also, I hope my ceiling has something interesting on it.
00:01:49.268 - 00:01:51.956, Speaker C: Well, your mic is affixed to the ceiling, it looks like, so I think you're.
00:01:51.988 - 00:01:54.100, Speaker A: There you go. I can stare at. Stare at the boom.
00:01:54.140 - 00:02:21.100, Speaker C: All right, so we are early stage investors in crypto, but I want to caveat that nothing we say here is an investment. Investment advice, legal advice, or even life advice. Please see chopping blocks at XYZ for more disclosures. So, it's been a choppy couple of weeks. Markets seem to be quite, quite bored. Going sideways, slash slightly down. There hasn't been a lot of energy in the markets, except around one story which is animating the crypto world right now of a little protocol called World Liberty Financial.
00:02:21.100 - 00:03:24.044, Speaker C: So world Liberty Financial is notable for being in some way associated with Donald Trump, the republican nominee and former president. Apparently, it's his family who's involved, apparently Barron Trump, as well as Donald Trump junior, who are involved in this project in ways that are not yet fully disclosed. But apparently, despite the fact that, or other than the fact that Donald Trump has retweeted world Liberty financial, and there's been some just general teasing of what the project does other than it's related to DeFi and of course, the hashtag be defiant, Coindesk picked up a scoop about world Liberty Financial that involved a leaked white paper. Apparently, what we know so far is that the team behind world Liberty Financial is building something that is an aave fork based on a protocol called Doe Finance. D o U G h, dough, as in bread dough. Now, Doe finance apparently was originally hacked for $2 million, but the code for Doe Financial is one for one. The same code as is in the leaked codebase for world Liberty Financial, as well as parts of the same team.
00:03:24.044 - 00:03:38.692, Speaker C: So it seems that the DoE finance team is now partnering up with the family of Donald Trump, apparently in the white paper, which has also been leaked. Barron Trump, who is the, I think, teenage son, is he a teenager?
00:03:38.836 - 00:03:40.716, Speaker B: He's 1818.
00:03:40.788 - 00:04:00.590, Speaker C: Okay, so the 18 year old son of Donald Trump is listed on the white paper as a DeFi visionary. The governance token for world Liberty Financial will be non transferable, so you will not be able to sell this token. So it's really a pure governance token. Actually, it's kind of very earnest of them to create what would be hilarious.
00:04:01.530 - 00:04:10.390, Speaker A: What would be hilarious is if it had some way of taking an oracle that only allowed it to be transferable if Trump wins.
00:04:13.250 - 00:04:23.479, Speaker C: So it's like Schrodinger's security. Okay. Yeah. Okay, nice. Interesting. So, yeah, thoughts on world Liberty financial? Also, have any of you guys gotten a pitch?
00:04:24.419 - 00:04:35.955, Speaker B: I have heard this news, actually, from pretty, I would say reputable or, like, investors that I think are good in crypto, kind of before this news came out.
00:04:35.987 - 00:04:41.843, Speaker A: So after the news came out. After the news came out, you don't think they're good?
00:04:42.011 - 00:04:42.675, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, no.
00:04:42.707 - 00:04:43.519, Speaker C: Now they're done.
00:04:44.339 - 00:05:19.782, Speaker B: No, no. They were approached to be advisors or whatever, and I think they turned it down, which is probably wise, um, because, I mean, the details of it do not sound super compelling. I think even the front end, there's a leaked screenshot. It's the same thing as Doe finance, but just, they change the colors. So, on the one hand, you know, it's good that they were trying to hit up people and get good people that I think are advisors on the project. But, yeah, I don't really know what the sort of grand scheme or idea here is. Initially, there was a rumor that it was gonna be something real estate related.
00:05:19.782 - 00:05:42.410, Speaker B: That doesn't seem likely now. I don't know. It's very confusing. I think there have probably been better ways to work with crypto, and I feel like Trump was on a very good tear to the crypto community in terms of saying the right things and appealing to the things that people want. In terms of policy, this feels like a total left turn.
00:05:43.710 - 00:06:09.260, Speaker A: I think it's kind of funny. It's like, if we take Trump's crypto trajectory, it's like, three months ago, we heard free Ross and bitcoin policy. This month, we hear, uh, an Ave fork, uh, like, world finance, and, uh, you know, what am I supposed to expect in three months? Like, a Solana fork, uh, a roll up.
00:06:09.380 - 00:06:11.964, Speaker C: That sounds way too hard for the Trump family.
00:06:12.052 - 00:06:27.200, Speaker A: I know, but it's like. It's, like, funny because it's, like speed running crypto over the last five years in, like, three months. Right. To go. I. Again, I hear, Tom, I have no. What's the end game of Doe, or, sorry, of world finance? Like, it feel, it just.
00:06:27.280 - 00:06:31.456, Speaker C: We should all just call it Doe finance. I feel like that's a. It's a beautiful nickname.
00:06:31.568 - 00:07:11.042, Speaker A: Honestly, every time I say doe finance, I just think about all of those, like, basis forks that were actually made by Doe Kwan. Do you remember those, like, basis cash? Yeah, yeah, but. But, yeah, there's just, like, some. Something weird about this. Like, why. What benefit does Trump get from doing? I mean, there's. I just don't really get the benefit to Trump DJT or Barron, because, like, what are they expecting this to be? Like, selling another NFT and, like, this token will, like, be a low market cap shitter or something, you know? Like, I think.
00:07:11.042 - 00:07:23.646, Speaker A: Feels like it's like a meme coin with ten more steps. You know what I mean? Like, it doesn't. Like, what unique assets can I borrow, use as collateral? And Doe finance, like, the entire thing is kind of bizarre to me.
00:07:23.678 - 00:08:00.158, Speaker C: Like, so, yeah, it's interesting you asked that question of, like, okay, why? What is Trump's motivation for doing this? I asked the same question to myself about his NFT collection, and clearly, I think if you're Trump, you're just out for any million, incrementally, that you can use to. This has been a strategy for a very long time. He's a celebrity. Celebrities say yes to brand deals, and they find ways to gradually monetize their name and likeness. And an NFT is just another mechanism by which to do that. So I think for Trump, for Trump personally, I think that's the way that he thinks about it, is that he's.
00:08:00.174 - 00:08:05.822, Speaker A: Not thinking about crypto, but a meme coin would have been more effective.
00:08:05.926 - 00:08:30.206, Speaker C: Well, the point that I'm gonna make is that I think for, for Barron or for Donald Trump Junior, I think the equation is very different is that when you are the son or the, you know, the child of a very, very wealthy person, what you are trying to do is not so much make money so much as buy legitimacy. Right. Or create legitimacy for yourself. And so I have to imagine that a lot of what has brought them here is not this idea of like, oh, I can make a quick, why.
00:08:30.238 - 00:08:34.462, Speaker A: Is being like, the 500th ave for a form of legitimacy?
00:08:34.526 - 00:08:54.594, Speaker C: Well, I don't think they necessarily understand that more like, okay, I want to be a crypto entrepreneur. Crypto is cool and high status, and my dad is saying it's a big deal. And, you know, it's like a, it's one of these hot things everyone knows about. And I. There are these guys I met who can teach me how to make a protocol, and I'll be a real entrepreneur, and I'll create and defy. Sounds really cool. Like, I don't know.
00:08:54.594 - 00:09:02.402, Speaker C: I have to assume that for Baron that this sounds like starting a startup, you know, like, with. I have to imagine.
00:09:02.466 - 00:09:34.150, Speaker A: I mean, I feel like the name is really the thing they're selling to their daddy, or is like, the idea that, like, look, look, look, we made a bank, and it's called World Finance institute or whatever, like Internet. Yeah, because it sounds like an evil, fake villain bank from the 1980s that, like, Pablo Escobar would, like, deposit. Yeah. It doesn't even sound like a real thing. Like, I feel like it's basically a meme coin with more steps and could get back again because Joe finance was hacked.
00:09:34.750 - 00:10:10.526, Speaker B: That's true. It is in some ways similar to the truth social spac thing where you get DJT, the ticker, and it's trading at billions of dollars for this product that no one really uses. But it's a meme stock, and so it's maybe profitable in that way. And I don't know, it's also some person that you get a connection to has your ear. And I mean, it's like the guys who made Doe finance are the ones who are telling you its a good idea. Its not like theyre listening to the consensus of crypto Twitter. And so yeah, some guy tells you its a good idea and he had something in the past.
00:10:10.526 - 00:10:15.650, Speaker B: Yeah, lets roll it. I dont know. It just seemed very random.
00:10:16.630 - 00:11:00.572, Speaker C: I mean, the more time that ive spent over the last three, four years seeing a lot of these celebrities and how they interface with crypto, it feels very similar to this. Wherever they know a dude and it's always a dude. And that one dude like has some glancing connections in the crypto universe, but they're, they're pretty thin. And that dude is like, oh, you know, if you create an NFT, if you create a metaverse drop, if you do a partnership with, you know, blah, blah, blah, token, it's like the new hot thing. You can get your whatever. And they generally are not plugged into like this sort of the inner ring of crypto. It's always like some random person on the outer ring who ends up bringing like ushering them into crypto and giving them the idea of what to do.
00:11:00.572 - 00:11:56.270, Speaker C: Which is why you see so many of these celebrities have very hit or miss initial ideas about how to interface with crypto. And I have to imagine that it's probably very similar. What happened here is that Baron just knew somebody who was connected to doe finance and this Doe finance person was like, oh, you know, if I, I bet if I convince Barron to become part of this crypto project or reboot of Doe finance, then we'll really take off and we'll make him a co founder and we'll put him on the white paper and get access to his dad. So I don't know. This really smells like that to me, which is, I think a lot of people are trying to draw the agency from Trump, and I think that's probably a mistake. I think it's probably more somebody went in through Barron and this is a lot more analogous to like, I don't know, Katy Perry signing off to an NFT drop or some crypto protocol than, than thinking about Donald Trump deciding to be a party to some, to some, something in crypto.
00:11:56.570 - 00:12:15.164, Speaker A: I agree. But it's also weird because he's tweeting about it and I feel like the DeFi stuff is the type of stuff genther wants to talk about and go after. And it doesn't really make sense to me. Why not just go to the meme coin? It just seems so much cleaner overall.
00:12:15.292 - 00:12:43.740, Speaker C: I think that's a very crypto perception that, like, the meme coin is cleaner, right from the outside. Building a DeFi protocol sounds like a real business. Sounds like a job. It's like, oh, it's so good. Baron is like starting a company and he's writing code, he's got a white paper. It sounds, in a way, this is like, reflective of the difference between the NFT, like, previous cycles. People talk about how this cycle feels kind of nihilistic or kind of barren because of the meme coin stuff.
00:12:43.740 - 00:13:15.280, Speaker C: And it's all very know, all this financial nihilism, this is part and parcel of that, right? Is that it might be underneath all of the artifice, it might be just as much of a kind of shallow, bullshit enterprise to create an aave fork from a hacked code base that's branded with Donald Trump's family, but it at least has the veneer of being a real thing. And in polite company, Baron can go around and be like, oh, no, I'm a founder. I started a company that does a blah, blah, blah.
00:13:15.320 - 00:13:19.980, Speaker A: Iggy Azalea describes herself as a founder of mother.
00:13:21.200 - 00:13:26.992, Speaker C: You know, for all I know, she is. We're not going to court that. We're not going to mess with that.
00:13:27.016 - 00:13:45.570, Speaker A: Bees nest, because I'm just, I'm just saying. I am just saying I don't think the meme coin is that different, especially when it's a fork of a protocol that was hacked very recently, not that long ago. And it's the 500th Ave fork. It doesn't have any unique assets and unique.
00:13:45.690 - 00:13:57.786, Speaker C: Well, we don't know that yet. Hey, we don't know that yet. We don't know that yet. Governance not transferable. That's the first 1st sign of innovation that we've seen in this space for a while. Okay, so that's true, you know. Yeah, let's wait and see.
00:13:57.786 - 00:14:03.870, Speaker C: Give them, hey, the rule in venture give founders the benefit of the doubt. I'm going to give Baron the benefit of the doubt here.
00:14:05.820 - 00:14:09.316, Speaker A: All right, well, you and me differ in our. In our tolerance.
00:14:09.388 - 00:14:12.060, Speaker C: That's funny. Usually you're the charitable one. That's.
00:14:12.180 - 00:14:32.740, Speaker A: I agree, but this just seems like a low effort rug pull, you know, like, it just, like, reminds me of all of the BSc rug pull. Copy pasta lending forks of 2021. It just like, it really just looks like that. So it's kind of, like, hard to say anything positive or feel anything positive about it.
00:14:33.040 - 00:14:50.016, Speaker B: It is weird. Like, in terms of being off meta that we didn't see any celebrity defy forks in 2020 or 2021. It was all nfts. You know, there was not a ghizelia swap or something or anything that I can think of.
00:14:50.208 - 00:14:58.736, Speaker A: Gazelle thwop. Honestly, if she's listening to this, I actually think she should do that. That would actually work for a mother.
00:14:58.928 - 00:15:00.260, Speaker C: Why would that work?
00:15:00.830 - 00:15:11.966, Speaker A: We're back. There have been a bunch of recent amms that take extra fees that have come out. I'm trying to remember which kind of a little bit like the friendtech one.
00:15:11.998 - 00:15:13.410, Speaker C: The friends one? Yeah.
00:15:15.230 - 00:15:38.110, Speaker A: And I kind of feel like there's this first party amm thing, and because she has a brand and her meme coin is reasonably well distributed, there's probably some way of actually taking advantage of the mother order flow that she kind of can uniquely drive. So I don't know. I don't know. Iggy Azalea doing a DeFi lending protocol makes 500 times more sense than Baron.
00:15:39.010 - 00:15:39.990, Speaker C: Fair enough.
00:15:40.570 - 00:15:43.470, Speaker A: Iggy, don't forget I set it here first.
00:15:43.810 - 00:16:34.478, Speaker C: Okay, nice. Speaking of extracting fees, another story that's been catalyzing a lot of discussion on Twitter has been the story that Pump fund has just passed $100 million in revenue in 217 days since its launch, making it the fastest crypto app to ever hit $100 million in revenue behind Athena, convex pancake swap and Aerodrome we've seen. Although Pump Fund has hit. So pump fund, for those who don't know, is a meme coin launchpad on Solana. It is by far the biggest, and it has galvanized a lot of the meme coin activity that is taking place on Solana these days. However, we've seen a pullback in the total amount of trading volume and activity on Solana. So we've seen monthly non vote transactions for Solana go from the month of July was the year to date high, which was 1.3
00:16:34.478 - 00:17:01.140, Speaker C: billion non vote transactions. That's come down to about 480 million. So over 60% decrease in the total amount of transactions. We've also seen a decrease in the amount of meme coin trading volume happening on Solana. So it seems like might be a seasonal pullback, might be something broader about the market cycle. There was also some news that came out about an analysis of how many folks are making money trading meme coins that are directly launched on pump. Fun.
00:17:01.140 - 00:17:48.844, Speaker C: And there was a great set of stats that show just the degree to which I think Twitter might give you a bent or a distorted view of what's actually happening with respect to people trading meme coins. Just to rattle off some of these stats, if you've made over a million dollars trading pump fund tokens, you are a top 70 trader, which is 0.2 basis points of all wallets. If you've made over $100,000, you're in the top 900 traders, which is a top three basis points of all wallets. If you've made over $10,000, you're in the top 12,000 wallets, which is 47 basis points. And if you've made over $1,000, you're in the top 76,000, which is the top 3% all wallets. So more than 60% of all wallets have lost money trading meme coins so far.
00:17:48.844 - 00:18:31.400, Speaker C: So I want to stop there and just get us to reflect a little bit. So we started talking about meme coins. Must have been like January or December last year that we started talking about the meme coin rally, and we've reflected at various times about how sustainable we think the meme coin rally is. The interesting thing I have seen is that the meme coin sentiment on Twitter toward pump fund seems to have resoundingly turned negative seemingly over the last month or so, whereas I saw in March, April, it seemed like a lot of the sentiment was really positive, that pump dot fund fun was a good thing and we should have more things like this and that this is improving the crypto space. What are your guys thoughts on pump dot fund, the meme coin cycle, and where we are in the overall lifecycle of these things?
00:18:33.900 - 00:18:35.680, Speaker B: I feel like Tarun is the expert here.
00:18:35.990 - 00:18:36.890, Speaker A: I know about.
00:18:37.990 - 00:18:40.694, Speaker C: Well, you're the connoisseur of crypto today, so I feel like you got to worry about that.
00:18:40.742 - 00:19:36.114, Speaker A: I don't know about expert, but I will say I didn't mention pump fun on this show before anyone else in this show even knew what it was. I think this is kind of a natural cycle. Also, overall crypto volumes have been kind of weird. The market has just been overall weird, partially because I think the equities market is also in this bizarre rebalancing thing where all the big stocks are selling off and all the russell is rallying and stuff. So it feels like a there's not as much like new capital flow into crypto right now. Even though stablecoins sort of hit an all time high, it doesn't feel like there's new capital flow going into volatile assets. And yeah, I think people are probably just like, there's only so much again, you know, I think maybe I said this last time, but if you have a casino where the players win 10% of the time, they obviously eventually all leave.
00:19:36.114 - 00:20:13.058, Speaker A: If you have a casino where players win 25% of the time, they obviously all leave. But people learn this lesson and start increasing the mechanism until you get to 46 or whatever. There's some kind of empirical threshold at which people don't leave when the edge is close enough to 50%. And I kind of think meme coins will evolve to something like that. Like inevitably, I think it will. They'll kind of converge into like casino territory. Now, maybe because they have this sort of collectible community aspect, which maybe they can do it at like a lower VG.
00:20:13.058 - 00:20:15.790, Speaker A: Like maybe 40% of people make money.
00:20:16.370 - 00:20:18.910, Speaker C: But to your point, will converge to that.
00:20:20.390 - 00:21:13.338, Speaker A: I mean, people are going to keep trying the genius out of the bottle. People like this style of launch and burning the keys and locking the LP and all, you know, like all of that stuff seems to be part of the mechanics. Like a video game almost, that people like that video game. So I think people are just going to improve that and they're just going to change the payoff structure and it's going to become closer to what sort of like the long run equilibria for pure speculation. And that people have observed. Now, like I said, there could be some reason it's, it deviates a bit from, you know, roulette or, you know, any of the casino games that are like far from 50 50 or far from par and don't require skill. But my suspicion is, like, those games are that way.
00:21:13.338 - 00:21:49.622, Speaker A: Cause, like, human nature has, like, tried games that are more sharky and less sharky. And then we evolved to, oh, the ones that survived hundreds of years are these ones that are right around that threshold for the non skill. I'm not talking about poker. I'm really talking about the pure non skill gambling games. And it just seems like that that's been like an evolutionary thing to get to that number. Now, I'm not saying there's a theoretical justification that it's exactly for, because it's really a behavioral psychology thing of how much pain are people willing to tolerate on average, over a large distribution of people.
00:21:49.806 - 00:22:26.484, Speaker C: I think I disagree with this because meme coins gambling on skill games is inherently unstable. Gambling on pure games of chance is very stable. I think you can just say, okay, the odds are 46%, pull the slot machine, play roulette, whatever it is, and you can kind of winnow to that point of the Laffer curve that maximizes revenue and maximize retention or whatever it is. But for games with skill, it's very difficult to control that because it's PvP. Right. People are just kind of sharking each other and gobbling up each other. And you can't really stop the over harvesting because of the fact that it's person on person.
00:22:26.484 - 00:22:42.112, Speaker C: And no single person is internalizing the health of the overall ecosystem. Only the house is doing that. And the house is pumped out. Fun. But the house can't stop people from launching, getting a new coin to launch, pumping it on social media and then dumping it into the pump. And this is kind of the thing that people are pointing to, which is.
00:22:42.136 - 00:22:56.536, Speaker A: Not that I agree, but I sort of view it as like this type of thing where it's a thing. A meme coin is like a game of skill. A game that starts as a game of skill in the beginning for the creator, and then it devolves into pure noise trading. Right.
00:22:56.568 - 00:23:09.762, Speaker C: I think that's only true if it hits escape velocity, right. But that's like dogecoin, that's Shiba. That's like some of these things that are so. But that's not what we mean when we're talking about the, like the low captions kind of. Yeah, exactly. Low cap shitters. Right.
00:23:09.762 - 00:23:37.962, Speaker C: So this is a very high velocity game. It's one that benefits being an insider. And I think the skillset of this game has changed over time. But it's very reminiscent of what NFTs were like, where nfTs, there were new launches every single day, there were new mints every day. And in the early days, it was really about curating taste and having some insight into where fashion is going. And then by the late cycle of nfTs, it was really about being an insider, knowing the whales, knowing the kind of group buying mechanics and stuff like that.
00:23:37.986 - 00:23:45.174, Speaker A: But I think the difference for NFT is just like, the liquidity premium is much higher because of, like, choice.
00:23:45.222 - 00:23:55.678, Speaker C: It was a worse vehicle, right? Like all things, it was a worst vehicle for us to play this game. But the mechanics of the game feel very similar to me. Now, that being said, I'm not a meme coin trader or an FTP, but.
00:23:55.694 - 00:24:42.100, Speaker A: My point is, I guess my point is, I'm not saying that, like, the exact same mechanic will continue forever. I'm saying, like, people will take this and like, gradient descent on it, right? They'll like, do add a little tiny, different lockup schedule, different. Some extra lottery type of thing, some inflation curve that goes to zero randomly. There's all sorts of things you can do that turn it more into fairer, but, oh, you have to lock up capital for longer type of things. And I feel like people just then it becomes closer to these rollbit casino game type of things. And I don't world in which people don't experiment with that. It just seems like that's, that's the point of crypto is like, hey, I can actually make that game with ten lines of code versus in the real world.
00:24:42.100 - 00:25:26.330, Speaker A: It's actually annoying to actually construct that game in terms of making a device or making a game that does that. I think the beauty of crypto is that you can experiment and incrementally improve that. And I don't doubt that whether it's pump fund or whether it's someone else, people will find some new mechanic that brings a vague up so that you don't have as much of a. Whatever mechanic you add leads to fewer losers, and we get closer to the. I'm not saying it will be the same again. The casino phenomenology is empirically. Well, I'm comparing all these samples from casino games, which are inherently in some ways less flexible because I can't resell my roulette position, but I can definitely resell my meme coin position.
00:25:26.330 - 00:25:52.870, Speaker A: Like, imagine if you could play roulette, and as it was turning, you, like, suddenly got scared, and you're like, I want to dump all my roulette position. Right? Like, there is some nuance to the reason that the different. It's a different beast. But I think that there is some truth to this human nature thing. Like, if you lose too much, everyone leaves, right? Like, you do really have to get closer to fair for people to keep playing.
00:25:53.040 - 00:26:45.710, Speaker B: There's a good section in the new nate silver book about slot machine design, and they talk a little about this, where basically people like it more and spit nefarious, but they play more on slot machines when that brownian motion plays out with more smaller payouts, even if the overall ev is the same. So instead of, hey, the 1000th person get some crazy payout, everyone else gets zero. It's like, well, more frequently, some double digit percentage, you get a little bit of a payout, and most of the time at zero, there's a single digit percentage a little bit more. And so it sort of goads you into playing more. And so obviously, there's a whole design system around this. And right now, to your point around the vig, it feels like sort of max extraction. It feels like you're just buying a lottery ticket, and there isn't really that sort of mini payout.
00:26:45.710 - 00:26:55.396, Speaker B: So maybe there's something where it's like, oh, some of these house winnings this $100 million goes into occasionally buying some of the token or doing a drop.
00:26:55.428 - 00:27:36.988, Speaker A: Or something, or you get inflation randomly given out. Yeah. My point is there are little mechanics you can add that can make this converge to that. And I actually think a cool thing you can do in crypto. And look, I'm not here to try to be like, oh, this is revolutionizing humanity or some bullshit that some AI startup would tell you. I'm just simply saying this is human nature so someone will try this, which is, I actually think the interesting thing about things like slot machines is they're fixed strategy. It's like a strategy ahead of time that the machine takes in its randomness and what distribution.
00:27:36.988 - 00:28:04.570, Speaker A: It's sampling and whatever. But you don't have to have fixed randomness in crypto. I can adjust the rules of the slot machine dynamically as people and train a model that is based on how people are interacting. I'm actually going to make the vig shrink and grow dynamically based on we got to this market cap. So now do this other strategy. I think there'll be these adaptive agent slot machines. Meme coins will evolve to that.
00:28:04.710 - 00:28:16.430, Speaker C: If the, if the theory here is that, okay, meme coins are basically a fancy skin over a slot machine. And to the extent they diverge from slot machines because they become these, like PvP, well, they're more dynamic.
00:28:17.610 - 00:28:22.370, Speaker A: They're like group slot machines. Right? Like influencer output probabilities.
00:28:22.490 - 00:28:36.108, Speaker C: So it's like, yeah, but wouldn't that imply that like, okay, well, these things are kind of diverging because they're not stable and they result in like this kind of over harvesting behavior. And so really, like they're kind of best when they divert back to a slot machine.
00:28:36.164 - 00:28:38.320, Speaker A: You could imagine the slot machine thesis.
00:28:38.660 - 00:28:45.436, Speaker C: Yeah, but shouldn't the thesis be then like, okay, well, slot machines are already gradient descented to be this like perfect apotheosis?
00:28:45.548 - 00:29:11.070, Speaker A: No, no, they're gradient descent under the assumption of static strategy. Like it's burned into the machine. There's a fixed strategy. It's not dynamically adjusting based on multiple people interacting with it. The multi agent nature and the fact that it has to have an upfront strategy that it can't change is different than the meme coin mechanics where you could add all of this stuff and it could dynamically adjust.
00:29:12.450 - 00:30:06.898, Speaker C: Let me take a step back. Let me take a step back because I'm not trying to get into the mechanics of how you optimally harvest or don't over harvest people who are playing this game. The question I'm asking is more a phenomenological one, which is, okay, you're a user trading meme coins. What do you feel like you're doing? What makes it fun? What makes it attractive? I think the answer is that you think you can make money. Memes are funny. It's interesting to find memes that you think you're spotting early that you're going to make money from. And my claim is that at a certain point, this perception that people have, that they have alpha in this game, that they can make money in this game starts to degrade and they no longer really believe that they can make money doing this in the same way that people love trading stocks because you meet some random person who's a day trader and they think they're like, oh, I know, I just think about Apple and see their products and watch commercials and I'm going to trade based on that and my perception of how this thing is going to play out.
00:30:06.898 - 00:30:19.346, Speaker C: And of course, people who do that just, they're just basically noise traders, right? It's just completely random whether they're going up or down. Now with meme coins, it's not like that, right? With meme coins it's not just, you're not just noise.
00:30:19.418 - 00:30:23.770, Speaker A: Tell everyone who bought icon enterprises that for the dividend.
00:30:24.350 - 00:30:25.350, Speaker C: Okay, fine.
00:30:25.430 - 00:31:03.472, Speaker A: I don't know if you know about the collapse, icon, the sec going after him. So basically icon kind of ran what I would call something that looks like a meme coin Femi Ponzi scheme, which is he promised 15% dividend, dividend yield on his stock. Very speaking of a crypto thing, very low float, high FTV. I think the ratio is like 100 plus. And he was obviously the largest owner and he just kept borrowing against his stock to pay out the 15% dividend. Or eventually thats what happened. For a while there were cash flow generating companies, but a bunch of them failed in the pandemic.
00:31:03.472 - 00:31:23.432, Speaker A: And so then he started doing this thing where he borrow against the shares, take the cash, pay the float, and then eventually that kind of thing eventually blew up and know people are shorter to death. And now the SEC is going after him as of last week. And I think like that's, that's sort of the thing, the thing here.
00:31:23.536 - 00:31:25.952, Speaker C: So there's some adverse selection as well in the stock market.
00:31:26.016 - 00:31:48.700, Speaker A: I'm just saying I don't think, I don't think it's for free lunch, like, like yes, there are things where. Where, you know, there's a real dividend yield and it will continue forever or whatever, but just look at all these people having Nvidia earnings, lunch parties and, like, you know, like, in Manhattan, which is, like, crazy, you know, like, that feels a little bit like almost as meme coin thing. It's like I was there first.
00:31:48.820 - 00:31:53.220, Speaker C: You know, I don't think that's like me. No, no. That is absolutely not like meme coins.
00:31:53.300 - 00:31:57.372, Speaker A: That Nvidia are the most successful meme asset in history.
00:31:57.516 - 00:32:09.380, Speaker C: No, no, no. I think maybe something like Tesla is more of a meme asset where it's, like, very, very heavily retail held. But Nvidia is Nvidia now enormous revenue. No, no, it's enormous.
00:32:09.420 - 00:32:10.860, Speaker A: No, it does, it's huge.
00:32:10.900 - 00:32:12.360, Speaker C: On institutional balance, it does have.
00:32:12.400 - 00:32:22.960, Speaker A: It does have huge revenues, but the way it's trading is, like, unreal. It, like, looks for f four. That size is unreal. I think today it lost three or four x what Solana's market cap is.
00:32:23.040 - 00:32:45.254, Speaker C: Yeah, it lost 10%. Yeah, yeah, exactly. That's right. It's a huge swing today. Coming back to my point, and I think, let me just land the plane real quick, is, I think the phenomenology of meme coins is that people think they're making money if they no longer think they're making money. Meme coins are not actually that fun as, like, just a slot machine with more. More, you know, stuff you have to do to pull the slot machine.
00:32:45.254 - 00:32:53.582, Speaker C: And it's not as fast as a slot machine. Right. Because the meme coins, they go up and down, but they don't go up and down nearly as fast as you can control yourself if you are controlling the slot machine.
00:32:53.686 - 00:33:12.060, Speaker A: I think the point of the dynamic nature of the system is that people will be. Will play around with it and try to engineer it so that it has a longer half life. Right. Like, you add all these mechanics so that, like, it's fun for a longer time. It's almost like these, like, Asia, all these, like, games.
00:33:12.680 - 00:33:15.380, Speaker C: The question is, who's going to make that happen? Pump fun.
00:33:16.040 - 00:33:21.528, Speaker A: Them. One of those 50 team fund. 50 other teams that are trying to do this. New entrepreneurs.
00:33:21.624 - 00:33:21.952, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:33:22.016 - 00:33:26.980, Speaker A: There's a million people doing this who are raising money, too, in case you're. You haven't seen.
00:33:28.840 - 00:33:34.488, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm just, I'm just skeptical that, like, when you have this group dynamic that anybody can play. Like, there's no single person who's.
00:33:34.544 - 00:33:52.244, Speaker A: It's almost like making video games. It's like think about the asian video games, especially these really popular games in China, where theyll get 100 million users for three months, theyll have a huge amount of revenue, and then theyll go to zero. It feels like thats a natural evolution of this type of thing.
00:33:52.372 - 00:34:21.014, Speaker C: Okay, take poker as an example. So I was a poker player, so I understand this analogy very well. Meme coins are kind of like poker in that its PvP and the house is taking a rake, right? So pump fund makes money on every single shitter that launches. And right now, the Dex fees go to radium, but they could internalize those and have their own Dex fee, right? So it really becomes kind of like a poker, a casino hosting poker games. So they make money no matter who wins. How, exactly. So you can dynamically adjust the rake.
00:34:21.014 - 00:34:42.216, Speaker C: You can say, okay, when not a lot of people are playing, we're going to make the rake lower. When a lot of people are playing and volatility is really high, we're going to make the rank higher. But you can't stop the fact that, like, you know what you might want in a poker? Like, the casino might want the best players at the table to go easy on the worst players at the table. So the bad players at the table stay for longer and they continue playing. Right. But the casino can't, can't stop the good players from doing that.
00:34:42.368 - 00:35:00.256, Speaker A: And you know how they can do that, though? You know how they can do that is they can change the game. They can, you can have to play different variations of poker based on the players that are playing. You can play different games. And my point is, the meme coins are moving in that direction where you're like, you're kind of playing a different game based on who's showing up.
00:35:00.288 - 00:35:03.428, Speaker C: And what's the different, what do you mean by different game? What does a different game mean for meme?
00:35:03.524 - 00:35:44.220, Speaker A: The different game in this case is like, oh, like if you lock up or stake, you get some random reward. Or if you do this action, you get, you know, like, people are trying to add all these, like, half defi, half casino things to meme coins. And I'm telling you, this innovation is happening. There's no, the genie is out of the bottle. Everyone is like, I see pumped up fun. No, but like, a lot of, a lot of, there are a lot of people who just basically started by just being like, we're making pumped up on clone Ln X, right? Like on or whatever, right? And those people are all promising all these new mechanics. And my point is, I think someone will find a slightly different variant of this in the same way that, like, there were.
00:35:44.220 - 00:36:23.570, Speaker A: There were sort of meme coin like things for many years in crypto that just never took off because, like, they didn't get the right lockup mechanic at launch and whatever. Right. Like, I think there's going to inevitably be innovation in this. Now, again, I'm not going to try to be like any of these Silicon Valley asshole people who'll be like, oh, yes, this is great for humanity because we've made AI agents useful somehow. No, this is literally just to make the people play games longer. But it's not so different than optimization for ads in some way of, what am I trying to do? I want retention for my users. And I think the game mechanics that have the highest retention will.
00:36:23.570 - 00:36:51.392, Speaker A: Will be the ones that survive. But I think the difference between this and the casinos, you can change the mechanics dynamically based on how things are traded. That's the beauty of crypto. I can program those update rules in a way that I can't change the poker rules and still get people showing up, if that makes sense. That's where I think the analogy breaks. It's not like I can dynamically update the rules of the game. Like I'm changing the game as well.
00:36:51.576 - 00:37:32.444, Speaker C: Yeah. So I understand the concept, and I reserve judgment that if somebody finds some of these mechanics that can dynamically change the extractiveness of a meme coin such that retail is better protected or sort of, the fish are not over harvested to the same degree. That's really interesting, and I'm curious to see how that plays out. I think where we started this whole meme coin cycle, we had a conversation very similar to this. And at that time, I posited that I didn't think meme coins were a stable. Like, this meme coin carousel is not a stable equilibrium, and it has to eventually stop because of this PvP nature of it. In the same way, I think you see the same thing in poker, is that poker.
00:37:32.444 - 00:37:39.308, Speaker C: Poker has shrunk over time. It's actually become smaller and smaller just because the fact that poker players are getting, well, poker and solved amateurism and.
00:37:39.324 - 00:37:40.320, Speaker A: All this other stuff.
00:37:40.660 - 00:38:05.364, Speaker C: Yeah, but even before that, even before that, the trend line was the same regardless. Before we had, you know, true, you know, game theory, optimal solutions to poker was just that people kept getting better and better, and the delta between the sophisticated players and the fish got bigger and bigger over time, and it never reverses. Right. And a lot of what keeps the ecosystem going is the bad players attract the better players. And you sort of have this pyramid, this sort of, you know, food pyramid that. That defines.
00:38:05.492 - 00:38:33.178, Speaker A: All I will tell you is, is when I was working in market making, that was literally all you talk about. Right? Like, you're always trying to measure, like, who's the trader, who, like, who has no edge so that you can adjust your order book placement so that they face adverse selection. I don't think that. I think that's, like, an inherent thing that will happen. I think the question is, how close to 50 50 do you get? How close? Like, you know, if you can get, like, you know, the perfectly fair thing is 50 50. Right.
00:38:33.274 - 00:38:47.538, Speaker C: But in trading. Right. The point is, in trading, in market making. Market making is profitable even if there's no, you know, sort of. You don't need fish or, like, you know, bad trading firms in order for market make profitable because noise, mental activity.
00:38:47.594 - 00:38:48.370, Speaker A: You do need noise.
00:38:48.410 - 00:38:49.162, Speaker C: Yes, you do need noise.
00:38:49.226 - 00:38:52.670, Speaker A: Too many market makers. Well, what are the noise chairs? Yeah, fish.
00:38:53.210 - 00:38:58.922, Speaker C: Well, they know they're not fish. They're like, they're not necessarily could be. They're just. They can be fish, right? But they don't have to be fish.
00:38:59.106 - 00:39:09.998, Speaker A: I mean, sure. Like, if it's a t wop algorithm that adds noise, that's still a fish. Like, you're. You're. You're scraping yield from them, that there is fundamentally some sense in which there has to be.
00:39:10.174 - 00:39:17.078, Speaker C: They're getting value on the other side is my point. Right. There's nobody who's net negative in terms of value. That doesn't have to be.
00:39:17.174 - 00:39:23.250, Speaker A: But my point is, imagine if the meme coin had some real dividend yield. It wasn't just like.
00:39:25.510 - 00:39:38.548, Speaker B: I think it's too early to say meme coin trading is a game of skill or game of chance. We have a very small sample size of profitable traders. It's like saying these are the professional slot players. You don't really have to, you know.
00:39:38.724 - 00:39:46.640, Speaker A: We should try to get Nate Silver as a guest to ask him to grill him on where he puts meme coins on that spectrum.
00:39:47.300 - 00:39:54.404, Speaker C: Well, we do know. I mean, we can tell very easily. Just do a cohort analysis, look at the meme coin traders on a weekly basis, and see how often they're up.
00:39:54.572 - 00:40:40.720, Speaker A: Sure. But I guess, like, the question of whether it will evolve to that, right? Because, like, we're basically trying to ask this more epistemological question of, like, can you even design this? Does there exist a game that is sustainable but has, like, you know, it doesn't have this kind of like pure the win rate, the loss rate of like a meme coin. Right. And it's like, it seems kind of inevitable to me. You'll find those in the same way that they're like all these dead casino games that, like, people don't play anymore because they were like, too one sided. How is that not going to happen here, too? Someone's going to improve it, and the market knows there's a lot of money if you can improve it. Now, there's been proof of concept, so there's going to be a ton of shots taken on goal on this.
00:40:40.720 - 00:40:44.000, Speaker A: And there already are a lot of entrepreneurs doing this.
00:40:46.220 - 00:41:10.012, Speaker C: Well, we should also be clear. We should also be clear. I think it's worth reiterating this, that the low liquidity shitters that people are trading on Solana is a relatively small part of the meme coin market. Most of the meme coin market is doge and Shiba and Bonk and Wif and. Yeah, exactly. And most of these are traded on centralized exchanges, they're not traded on chain. And they do much more volume than what you see.
00:41:10.012 - 00:41:39.542, Speaker C: Making 100 million over the course of a year for pump fund is nothing compared to what binance is making now. Of course, most of binance is not meme coins, but still. So I want to clarify that that part of the meme coin market is very real and very sustainable and doesn't have any of the problems that we're pointing to with respect to this meme coins showing up overnight. So what I'm not predicting is that meme coins will go away. I think that's definitely not true. But I think the velocity with which we're seeing meme coins and meme coin trading as a pastime, I think there.
00:41:39.566 - 00:41:45.222, Speaker A: Will be some new mechanic will inevitably happen for launching these, and then you.
00:41:45.246 - 00:41:50.040, Speaker B: Will have this whiff was once a low cap shitter. You don't know if.
00:41:50.420 - 00:42:29.026, Speaker C: Yes, yes, it was, it was. But the question is, like, what was happening with nfts, right? I think it's pretty clear that what was happening with nfts and what was happening with what's happening now with meme coins is isomorphic. It's just a different mechanism to trade the same thing or to play the same game, but with a different mechanism. I should say I agree with you that underlying the underlying shape is probably not going to change. The veneer that we put over it is probably going to change. But I think there's a natural life cycle to these games. And it feels like the meme coin trading game is getting later in the life cycle.
00:42:29.026 - 00:42:40.410, Speaker C: I don't think it's near the end. I think it's going to be a while before we're done done in the way that we're now done with NFT mints. But it feels like we're probably, let's say three fourths in to that game would be my guess.
00:42:40.570 - 00:42:51.794, Speaker A: Yeah. Look, I'm not trying to disagree that there might be a half life for this current version of this, but I'm just saying I'm sure there will be another one. There's nothing.
00:42:51.842 - 00:43:15.748, Speaker C: Yeah, I agree with that. I agree with that. I agree with that. And I think the reason why there will be another one is that there'll be a new set of people who get super rich, who don't actually have a lot of skill in the beginning. The people who end up buying dog coins super, super early are just people who like, ah, I like dog coins. And they're nothing but these extremely strategic, extremely smart, extremely capitalistic people who end up coming into the late cycle. We're now in the late part of the meme coin cycle.
00:43:15.748 - 00:43:36.788, Speaker C: And the people who are making money now are just like the guy Sahil, who watched all these celebrity coins. It's those kinds of people who are overwhelmingly profiting in the late part of the cycle. And that's when you get all this discontent, and you get all this malaise, and you get all this sense that, oh, now that pumped up fund has made 100 million instead of 50 million.
00:43:36.844 - 00:44:23.554, Speaker A: Now it's extremely to your point earlier, just like I feel like you're drawing this dichotomy between stocks and this as not having these credit cycles. But I think the meme coin and NfT thing just remind me of classic credit bubble cycles, where whoever was the first one to get the most leverage and bet it all on one thing without much skill, but they happen to grow that way, is then able to reinvest that 20 times, and then it causes all these other people to follow, and then it becomes more sophisticated. But then, oh, oops, there's not much liquidity. The story of the financial crisis is a great version of this. And I feel like there's always these kind of cyclic bubbles. It's just that in crypto they have this very short half life.
00:44:23.722 - 00:44:35.010, Speaker C: I agree. Yeah, agree. There are bubbles everywhere. The question is, like, how foreseeable is it that this bubble will eventually blow up? And I think the.
00:44:35.170 - 00:44:40.870, Speaker A: I think the second thing guarantees you that every bubble eventually blows up. The question is.
00:44:42.810 - 00:44:43.786, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, okay, fine.
00:44:43.858 - 00:44:48.762, Speaker A: Well, no, I mean, hey, could be longer. Could be much longer, you know?
00:44:48.826 - 00:45:02.462, Speaker C: Exactly. So, okay, how foreseeable within some time span that this thing will blow up, right? So, like, okay, the credit bubble and, like, the real estate bubble, one could have seen, like, maybe they will blow up at some point, but obviously a lot of people actually, maybe.
00:45:02.526 - 00:45:16.406, Speaker A: Here's a thought expert. 20 years, who's the person who you would say blew up or lost the most in NFT? Like, they, like, put a ton of capital and then, like, I guess, funds that bought loot.
00:45:16.478 - 00:45:21.150, Speaker C: Yeah, starry night. There are adventure funds that bought loot, if you guys remember that one.
00:45:21.230 - 00:45:32.670, Speaker A: But all the ones that did that doesn't matter. Like, I'm. I'm just more like, who. The one I'm talking about. Like the whole. Yeah, yeah. Like, like, starry night is a potentially a good one.
00:45:32.670 - 00:45:44.482, Speaker A: So then I have a similar question for you about meme coins. Who is going to be the person who is stuck holding the too much, like they, like, over levered themselves and, like, they're kind of.
00:45:44.506 - 00:46:22.316, Speaker C: That's the thing is, I actually, I don't. Here's part of the reason why I recoil so much from meme coins is that I. But I think all those funds are going to see it coming and I think they're going to get out of meme coins before the cycle really comes to a true close. Like, I think for NFTs, I think a lot of the funds actually did end up holding. Like, they. I think a lot of them still have their fucking loot or whatever. But I think for meme coins, I think there's just a lot more open eyes about what's really going on here and the extent to which this is a, you know, deep secular change in the overall financial firmament.
00:46:22.428 - 00:46:33.924, Speaker B: I don't know. There's a lot of, you know, VC thought leadership posts about how, you know, meme coins are building communities and it's like, you know, the new and a new form of capital formation.
00:46:34.012 - 00:46:54.436, Speaker A: And I'm like, you're not reading that now. You have a lot of haters on forecaster for your commentary on meme coins. And in particular, they are venture fund gps. So, like, I highly recommend you check that out. But there are no, no, there is. There are the. There are the apologists.
00:46:54.436 - 00:47:02.420, Speaker A: And I would say that in the same way, I'm sure someone is sitting on a lot of something like Degen and is like, oops, I don't know.
00:47:02.460 - 00:47:05.060, Speaker C: How's he. How's DJ doing? How's DJ doing? I actually have no idea.
00:47:05.100 - 00:47:25.250, Speaker A: It's a great question. I haven't even looked. I honestly, I stopped my farcaster, stopped getting spammed with all this, like, 5 million people being like, are you selective? I try to use it a few times a week, but it's not like Twitter. Yeah, I guess Degen from the peak. Peak was like $0.05. It's now like 0.3 cents.
00:47:25.550 - 00:47:29.990, Speaker C: 0.3. So it's down. What would that make it, 96?
00:47:30.150 - 00:47:30.850, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:47:31.430 - 00:47:43.274, Speaker C: Okay. It's down 96%. I don't know. It kind of sounds like I'm right about this, at least. Although I know one confirmation got in very, very cheap, so maybe they're still in the money.
00:47:43.402 - 00:47:49.538, Speaker A: Look, I'm just pointing out that, like, hey, look, there's this. There's kind of. Someone is holding. Someone is holding.
00:47:49.594 - 00:47:52.850, Speaker C: This is not a good vindication for your point, but. Okay, I'll take.
00:47:52.890 - 00:48:18.342, Speaker A: No, no, I'm just saying that every credit bubble, there is a. You know, there is someone who is the kind of stuck with over leverage slash can't get out of assets. Right. And, like, I'm kind of curious who the meme coin equivalent will be because the meme coins are kind of funny. They had this, like, very credit bubble like behavior, but they had no credit. There was no direct leverage in them. Okay.
00:48:18.342 - 00:48:52.806, Speaker A: People might have been barring against Sol and taking leverage on Sol, but there wasn't direct leverage. But the leverage came from the fact that the number of assets just grew faster than the amount of capital. And it sort of felt like there was this money creation event that's a little bit like the money multiplier effect you get with leverage. And so I feel like that's an actually interesting thing that people. I don't. It's kind of a weird credit bubble, whereas with nfTs, I feel like people were actually taking real leverage. Genesis was lending against crypto punks and shit, so it's like people were actually getting real leverage.
00:48:52.806 - 00:48:54.086, Speaker A: But the meme coin stuff didn't.
00:48:54.158 - 00:48:56.250, Speaker B: Interest rates were 0%, so.
00:48:57.830 - 00:49:02.038, Speaker A: But also, like, lenders were taking nfcs as collateral left and right all the way.
00:49:02.094 - 00:49:06.894, Speaker C: Ironically, like, doge is better collateral than any NFT ever was. Right? Doge?
00:49:06.942 - 00:49:07.566, Speaker A: For sure. For sure.
00:49:07.598 - 00:49:08.430, Speaker C: Remarkably strong.
00:49:08.510 - 00:49:28.460, Speaker A: The thing is, and this is something I remember someone was saying to me once, was like, there's some tax advantage to barring against NFT versus barring against liquid token in terms of, like, how you compute your basis. And I didn't really understand this, but, like, of course, this person blew up. So I think that's kind of funny.
00:49:28.500 - 00:49:39.570, Speaker C: Yes, yes. I understand why. Because if you buy an NFT early, you don't, you can't, you don't market to the floor price. That's like not a thing. You market to the last sale and the last sale was like, you bought it super, super early.
00:49:39.650 - 00:50:07.940, Speaker A: Yeah, there's something very weird about something marking, but like, okay, well, clearly all those people who thought they were really smart doing that all blew up because, like none of them could figure out correctly make loans. Yeah, but my point is the NFT thing had this leverage, credit cycle, financial crisis bubble type thing, but the meme coin thing really didn't. So it's like whoever is the dead body, like, had to have uniquely found a way to commit seppuku. It was like a unique form of death.
00:50:08.060 - 00:50:22.812, Speaker C: Right. Well, the thing also about the NFT market, or, sorry, the meme coin market, is that there are so many more people playing the meme coin game with very small amounts of money. That was just not possible with the NFT market. Right. The NFT market, the cost to play was just so high.
00:50:22.956 - 00:50:46.502, Speaker A: A comparison that I haven't seen and would love to actually either see or do is like comparing the total number of NFT collections and mints to the total number of meme coins and getting an idea of money velocity for both of them or something. Because I feel like my intuition, which could be wrong, is that there actually were way more meme coins than NFT.
00:50:46.566 - 00:50:50.570, Speaker C: Collections, undoubtedly, because it only requires one.
00:50:51.750 - 00:50:53.770, Speaker A: How much more? How much more?
00:50:55.770 - 00:51:22.690, Speaker C: I mean, almost certainly many, many more traders for meme coins than nfts. I think if you look at the stats on Opensea, what's it like, a million total people who've ever traded nfts? Something like that. I think that's rough order of magnitude. Whereas for meme coins, it's almost certainly more than 30 million, I would guess, and I mean, including centralized venues, I'd guess on chain, probably on the order of five to 10 million, be my guess. I don't know, I'm just kind of throwing a number in the air, I think.
00:51:22.770 - 00:51:32.630, Speaker B: Isn't dogecoin like the second most profitable currency on Robinhood for their crypto product? Yeah, so it's like.
00:51:33.370 - 00:51:45.634, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, so, okay, we're running up on time. I took some questions from Twitter to see what people wanted us to talk about, and I think having.
00:51:45.682 - 00:51:47.506, Speaker A: We're going to do rapid fire. Rapid fire.
00:51:47.578 - 00:52:03.430, Speaker C: No, no, no. I just want to do one because I think it's apropos of us spending a lot of time talking about pump fun, because I think pump fun and meme coins in general, they give people kind of fatigue about the cycle and about the kind of cynicism and lack of morale that we're seeing.
00:52:04.650 - 00:52:10.986, Speaker A: I think there's a spectrum of opinions, but I do think the loudest voices on crypto Twitter are like that.
00:52:11.058 - 00:52:37.070, Speaker C: Yes. And so one of the questions we got actually, from intern at Monad was, what is something that you're looking forward to in crypto over the next couple of years? And I think it's also important on the show that we try to also give the other side of what's happening in crypto, which is that it's not all this kind of nihilistic, short termist gambling, but there's a lot of important stuff happening in the space. So I want to end the show on that note, and we'll go around real quick, something you're looking forward to in the next couple of years. Tom, we'll start with you.
00:52:37.690 - 00:53:24.742, Speaker B: I'm going to try to pick something that isn't obvious, because I feel like people always say stable coins or something when they say this. I've been really pilled on ZK TL's over the past few months. I've been playing around with TL's notary and stuff, and it's super cool, I think in part because it fits this. ZK TL's lets you verify components of a web response which uses TL's and then take that proof on chain. So, for example, there's a product, ZKP two P, which lets you prove that you paid someone on Venmo to do sort of this decentralized on ramping, off ramping kind of thing. Super cool. The thing here that I like is, I think right now, when you talk about applications and crypto vis a vis web two, it's always, well, web two company is going to do everything on chain or they're going to move everything on chain.
00:53:24.742 - 00:53:55.650, Speaker B: I'm like, I don't think that's going to happen. That seems very unrealistic. Or two, we're going to build Airbnb on chain. I also think that's very unrealistic. I think these models, ZK TL's, allows you to busy bridge the two of allowing crypto to interact with the web in some way, but doing it in a way that is bootstrapping or sort of glomming onto the stuff that's already happening on the Internet. And so I think that's super cool, and it's obviously still in development, but I've been really excited about some of the applications that are building in that space.
00:53:57.710 - 00:53:59.650, Speaker C: Cool. Tarun, what's yours?
00:54:00.870 - 00:55:30.534, Speaker A: I think mine probably is, you know, a kind of expansion on the theme I was saying earlier, which is like, despite that application being for meme coins, although I think that for all the people who've raised money for doing all this agent stuff in crypto, like that is actually a viable business versus whatever highfalutin thing 90% of people say. But I do actually think this idea of like, crypto systems provide you a, a common substrate, b, I can verify, everyone can verify some subset of facts as the same, and c, you can kind of have dynamic rules that can get updated by the collective interacting with it. And so the idea of these systems where in the normal world, especially the normal financial world, the rules of the game are static, but the players can have dynamic strategies. I think one beautiful thing about crypto is you can actually have the game change at the same time as the players change their strategy. So it's like imagine playing chess, and as you're playing chess, somehow you can remove one piece from the board and now all of a sudden there's a hole on the board and you have to avoid that piece. And a lot of financial applications are inherently like this. Whenever there's a regime shift in finance, that's the same thing as someone poking a hole in the chessboard and saying, oh, you can't use that spot anymore.
00:55:30.552 - 00:55:31.150, Speaker C: Anymore.
00:55:33.010 - 00:56:54.996, Speaker A: But I think that the idea that the contracts themselves are smarter and can adjust the rules dynamically, we're starting to get there. And some of it is zkat co processing type of stuff. Some of it is things like restaking, where you can do off chain stuff and prove it correctly, which is a way of doing that. This general idea of these dynamic games, where not only are the players changing their strategies, but the board is changing, is actually really interesting to me, and I feel like you can't really do that in other parts of society very well. The idea of the rules changing due to how the players are interacting in the centralized setting, no centralized nd would ever really let you do that. They want to choose the rules for their game. It's a very abstract answer, but the reason I bring it up is a lot of these things that actually grow in terms of usage in crypto have this structure, whether it's meme coins, whether it's nfts, whether it's some of the kind of like how certain l one ecosystems are able to bootstrap themselves.
00:56:54.996 - 00:57:27.462, Speaker A: That's sort of, again, this kind of multiplayer game where, like, the rules are changing based on what contracts enter the ecosystem. There's sort of this, if you take that lens of viewing the world, there's clearly a lot of cooperation problems that can be solved if you can automate that. That part of, like, the rules changing. Right. Right now we're in the part of crypto that's like, I write the smart contract and that's like a fixed strategy. It's like the slot machine that doesn't change its rules. And of course, you can have oracles and stuff that give you input that let you change the rules a little bit.
00:57:27.462 - 00:57:40.250, Speaker A: But I think with a lot of the advanced cryptography, a lot of things like re staking, you can now have the rules change and be very confident in the safety of that. And that is a very new set of interactions that you can have.
00:57:40.550 - 00:58:43.920, Speaker C: Okay, well, my answer to this question, I think, is a little more basic than for both of you. I'm reminded of this something that I can't remember. There are some physicists who said in the early 20th century that quantum physics was a 21st century science that fell by accident into the 20th century. And in a way it was sort of too early for the ideas of quantum mechanics to be fully understood and incorporated into physics. And I feel in some way the same is kind of true of blockchains, is that blockchain was invented in 2008, but in a way, 2008 was too early for all the things that needed to come together for blockchains to get fully integrated into society. And part of it, of course, is, I think, the rise of the changing in attitudes towards governments and geopolitics. Part of it is also the fact that digital natives are now becoming more and more a part of the seats of power within society and the spenders in the world.
00:58:43.920 - 00:59:06.052, Speaker C: The world is becoming more interconnected. And of course, we just saw very recently coinbase demonstrate this thing about AI's paying other AI's using crypto. We're going to move increasingly over the next couple of decades toward a world that's intermediate more and more by AI's and less by human beings. And paper currency is going to become kind of outdated and irrelevant to the way that most economically, hey, the US.
00:59:06.116 - 00:59:09.652, Speaker A: Is talking about getting rid of the penny, which is a big deal.
00:59:09.716 - 00:59:51.522, Speaker C: Yes, that's right, that's right. And of course, India has completely moved away from cash. So I think in a way, the thing that makes me bullish and the thing that I'm most excited about is not any particular technology. I think almost everything in crypto, the meme coins aside, I've been kind of bearish on meme coins, but almost everything in crypto I'm by and large bullish on. And I do think is going to happen in one form or another. But I think the biggest thing that makes it all happen is just time. It's just like people who are old and resistant to the ideas behind crypto and grew up in a very different kind of world than the world in which crypto matters, just kind of aging out and losing relevance and losing the ability to veto this stuff.
00:59:51.522 - 01:00:53.960, Speaker C: And the people who are younger and are gaining in power for them, crypto just being kind of obviously or something that they have much more curiosity and openness about. And those people, the longer you wait, the more and more they're going to sit in the centers of power and they're going to be able to make the decisions that, okay, yes, Blackrock says yes, and Goldman Sachs says yes, but Vanguard says no. And eventually someone's going to step into the helm at Vanguard and say, actually, yeah, of course, crypto should be part of this financial platform. And the same with JP Morgan and the same with more and more of the centers of power are going to, in almost a very boring kind of way, just dutifully step aside and say, ah, yes, of course, crypto should be incorporated into the overall economy. And that's one of the reasons why I think, as a venture capitalist, less than as a trader. As a trader, you got to know when that's going to happen. And I can see why there's a lot of anxiety about, oh, well, is it going to happen this year? Is it going to happen tomorrow? Is it going to happen this month? But as a venture capitalist, the question I have to answer is, is that going to happen over the next five to ten years? And I think the answer that we've seen this year is very obviously, yes.
01:00:53.960 - 01:01:07.140, Speaker C: We're seeing it happen right in front of us with regulation and the political attitudes in the US. And whatever you think about Trump versus Kamala, it's very clear that both sides have moved closer to the crypto side. Over the last year.
01:01:08.800 - 01:01:23.128, Speaker A: How many candidates who were funded by their shake were. It was like some very high number, right? Like of, like the number of candidates that won their primaries or whatever who.
01:01:23.144 - 01:01:24.216, Speaker C: Were funded by fair shake.
01:01:24.328 - 01:01:36.328, Speaker A: Yeah, I saw some number today that was like in the thirties out of 42 or something like that. So it's like, it was, like, at least, like, 70, 75%. So, like, I feel like that, you.
01:01:36.344 - 01:01:52.610, Speaker C: Know, that's definitely a lot of work. That's. Yeah. And keep up the good work, everybody. You know, Coinbase ripple, everybody who's donating to fresh pack z. Kudos to you guys for helping push all this forward. Anyway, all right, we're up on time.
01:01:52.610 - 01:02:08.350, Speaker C: We got to wrap, but we'll be back next week, hopefully. I think actually next week we'll be doing a show or. No, no. Week after next, we'll be doing shows live from Token 2049. So for those of you who are in Singapore, please come join us. Or if you're not planning to come to Singapore, you should come out. It's gonna be a lot of fun.
01:02:08.350 - 01:02:09.930, Speaker C: Until then.
