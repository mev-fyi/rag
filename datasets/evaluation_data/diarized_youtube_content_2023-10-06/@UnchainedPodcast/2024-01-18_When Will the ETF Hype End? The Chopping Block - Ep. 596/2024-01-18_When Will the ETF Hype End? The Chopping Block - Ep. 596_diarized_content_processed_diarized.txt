00:00:00.810 - 00:00:06.094, Speaker A: You think people in suits aren't also shill bags? Is this what you're telling going on?
00:00:06.132 - 00:00:10.906, Speaker B: Blackrock is like bullposting for boomers. Like, it's literally the functional equipment.
00:00:11.098 - 00:00:17.326, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. It's the Bill Ackman Carl icon version, you know, of like, of being right.
00:00:17.348 - 00:00:19.850, Speaker C: It's their crypto Twitter, not a dividend.
00:00:19.930 - 00:00:21.114, Speaker A: It's a tale of two quan.
00:00:21.162 - 00:00:23.802, Speaker D: Now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet.
00:00:23.866 - 00:00:26.258, Speaker B: Generally speaking, airdrops. Kind of pointless anyways.
00:00:26.354 - 00:00:29.218, Speaker D: Some unnamed trading firms who are very involved.
00:00:29.314 - 00:00:31.906, Speaker A: Alec ETH is the ultimate Defi.
00:00:31.938 - 00:00:34.440, Speaker C: Protocols are the antidote to this problem.
00:00:36.490 - 00:00:46.902, Speaker D: Hello, everybody. Welcome to the chopping block. Every couple weeks, the four of us get together and give the industry insider's perspective on the crypto topics of the day. So quick intros. First, you got Tom, the defi maven and master of memes.
00:00:47.046 - 00:00:48.140, Speaker A: Hello, everyone.
00:00:48.910 - 00:00:58.270, Speaker D: Next we've got Robert, the crypto connoisseur and czar of superstate GM, everybody. Next we've got Tarun the gigabrain and grandpuba at Gauntlet.
00:00:59.890 - 00:01:00.602, Speaker A: Aloha.
00:01:00.666 - 00:01:26.550, Speaker D: And finally, I'm Haseeb, the head hype man at Dragonfly. So we are early stage investors in crypto, but I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice, legal advice, or even life advice. Please see choppingblock XYZ for more disclosures. So, guys, so excited to talk more about the ETFs. We were just bitching backstage about how bored we are of the ETF story. But how are you guys feeling about ETFs?
00:01:27.210 - 00:02:15.062, Speaker C: I mean, I think everybody is in the ETF hangover at this point where there was so much attention, so much focus. It's been roughly a week since, not even a week since they've gone live. It's been really two trading days last week and one trading day this week, which we don't have the data for because data comes out in slow, inefficient, traditional market ways. After hours, I feel like we're all in the hangover period. The data I'm sure we're going to go into, it's somewhat exciting. It's most exciting on a relative basis between different competitive ETFs and between grayscale and the rest of the market. So I'm excited to dig in so we can put the story to bed and never talk about it ever again.
00:02:15.196 - 00:02:41.210, Speaker D: Hopefully never talk about it again, but we'll see if that plays out. So, okay, high level stats. So, obviously, the primary interesting thing was that it ended up being a sell the news event which is more or less what a lot of people were predicting. I think we were alluding to that on the show. That's more or less what happened. Bitcoin slumped 3%, I think, after all of this. But I think the trading in the volume was roughly, I think, in line with expectations.
00:02:41.210 - 00:03:23.526, Speaker D: These things traded quite a lot, especially relative to most ETF launches. And the big winners and losers were basically, depending on how you measure it. So grayscale, as expected, had net outflows. Obviously, they're the only one that could really have net outflows at their scale. That said, of course, their aum is 26 and a half billion, and the net outflows were about 500 to 600 million that exited from GBDC, which is a lot less than what I was expecting. That said, it is only the first three trading days, so there may be more time for people to end up realizing their grayscale and getting out of something. Getting out of grayscale, given the fees, are an order of magnitude higher than any of the other vehicles.
00:03:23.526 - 00:03:55.202, Speaker D: But right now, actually, they're holding on to most of their assets. So actually it looks like if this continues, it may end up being an amazing business for grayscale to hold onto their bitcoin trust. And they've had much more volume than anybody else. So their total volume over the last three days has been, is that 5.1 billion in trading volume for the Grayscale BTC Trust. The next biggest by volume is the iShares Blackrock Trust, which is 2 billion for their ETF, and then fidelity at 1.5 billion.
00:03:55.202 - 00:04:24.180, Speaker D: And then it kind of falls off from there for assets, for net assets. Like who actually is custodying and charging fees on bitcoin right now? GBDC number one at 26 and a half billion. Then there's Blackrock at 500 million, way smaller, obviously. Then fidelity at 427,000,000, then bitwise at 225,000,000. And then it kind of falls off from there. So that's how the horse race is looking. Any surprises in there? Anything that jumped out at you guys?
00:04:25.990 - 00:04:48.438, Speaker A: You talked about the wrong winner in this whole scenario, by the way, completely ignored the real winner, which is Jane street, which is Jane street, like 100%, being the authorized participant on everyone. Also, just the fact that you have fucking authorized participants is how boring tradfi is. I have to have a whitelist always. What a boring.
00:04:48.534 - 00:04:50.330, Speaker D: Kind of like an NFT whitelist.
00:04:51.710 - 00:04:53.450, Speaker A: It's an NFT whitelist.
00:04:54.110 - 00:04:54.666, Speaker D: Exactly.
00:04:54.768 - 00:04:59.260, Speaker B: They're like keepers. That's why our approved keepers, it's the same thing.
00:04:59.890 - 00:05:00.640, Speaker D: No.
00:05:02.530 - 00:05:07.520, Speaker A: It is true, but I think there are protocols that don't have that.
00:05:08.690 - 00:05:31.430, Speaker D: Maybe there's a dumb question, but presume there's some set of people who are authorized participants. Generally, why do the ETFs have this whitelist of, like, we have two authorized participants as opposed to everybody who is sufficiently sophisticated and is a general kind of person of interest cannot just be like, yo, I'm going to do some stuff for your ETF.
00:05:33.530 - 00:06:03.040, Speaker C: Here's my only half educated answer. It's because it's as few as necessary to just ensure that somebody is able to go through the arbitrage process while minimizing paperwork and complexity that comes from having many participants. Because the process of the relationship between the ETF itself and the authorized participant, there's a lot of tech integration and stuff.
00:06:04.930 - 00:06:11.970, Speaker B: Like, there's a lot of tech integration here. If they're getting fucking Aum a day after what tech, they have to email.
00:06:12.040 - 00:06:15.220, Speaker C: Someone and say, please credit my shares to this account.
00:06:15.930 - 00:06:18.898, Speaker B: I thought they were faxing them. Maybe carrier pigeons.
00:06:18.994 - 00:06:23.138, Speaker D: Yeah, there's really no APIs for this. That is insane.
00:06:23.314 - 00:07:03.246, Speaker A: Well, I actually think one thing to keep in mind is for some types of ETFs, there are actually more stringent requirements for APs. So I don't know the exact history of exactly why in the 80s that equity APs versus commodity APs differed. But commodity APs, you actually have to prove that you can, in the worst case, take delivery. Not for every commodity commodities that require. No, the AP is dealing with the cash, but they also have to guarantee that they can trade in the real spot market if they can. With the bitcoin. There's like some requirement.
00:07:03.246 - 00:07:05.006, Speaker A: No, not with bitcoin. Not with bitcoin.
00:07:05.038 - 00:07:05.186, Speaker D: No.
00:07:05.208 - 00:07:29.494, Speaker A: I'm just saying for commodity ETFs in general, usually there's this argument that the AP needs to also be able to trade the spot metals market and take receipt. And so then they were like, okay, we don't want people who are like trading this thing, but then can't clear, and then the market has trouble clearing because there's some historical reason for that. But if I remember, there's a lot more regulation.
00:07:29.622 - 00:07:39.374, Speaker D: So if an authorized participant is like, yo, I'm going to take delivery of this, and they suck at it. It's kind of like, who cares? That's your fault. That's like your problem, not the ETF's problem.
00:07:39.492 - 00:07:55.762, Speaker A: But no, then the ETF might not be tracking its index. Tracking its index price correctly. Right. They really want that. They don't care. About anything else. And they have a lot of rules for who actually can do both sides in certain markets.
00:07:55.826 - 00:08:09.340, Speaker C: You're saying if there's a copper ETF that holds spot copper in warehouses somewhere, the authorized participants have to be able to take delivery of copper on their own?
00:08:12.270 - 00:08:15.130, Speaker A: In the worst case, yeah. They have to be set up to do that.
00:08:15.200 - 00:08:16.380, Speaker D: Right. Okay.
00:08:16.750 - 00:08:21.930, Speaker A: I think this is like a relevant to the bitcoin.
00:08:22.270 - 00:08:47.874, Speaker D: All right, fine. Okay, let's move on. All right, so bitcoin ETFs, hopefully this is the last time we're going to talk about this. If you care about this, I'm sure there's other podcasts for you related to the ETF. So I think Larry Fink has just been bullposting nonstop on CNBC about how crypto is the future and tokenization is the future. Apparently, bitcoin is no different from gold. He said on January Twelveth, and he's talking about how tokenization is the next generation of securities.
00:08:48.002 - 00:08:48.614, Speaker C: Oh, I agree.
00:08:48.652 - 00:09:07.754, Speaker D: I guess it was a good ETF launch. I don't know what the like. To be clear, I more or less agree with him, but I don't know. Kind of surprising to see Larry Fink going out and talking like Suzu all of a. What's, what's the vibe from your guys perspective on what's happening here?
00:09:07.952 - 00:09:13.454, Speaker A: You think people in suits aren't also shill bags? Is this what you're telling going on?
00:09:13.492 - 00:09:18.266, Speaker B: Blackrock is like bullposting for boomers. It's literally the functional equipment.
00:09:18.458 - 00:09:24.718, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. It's the Bill Ackman Carl icon version of being right.
00:09:24.724 - 00:09:25.870, Speaker C: It's their crypto.
00:09:26.690 - 00:09:27.582, Speaker D: Yeah, exactly.
00:09:27.716 - 00:09:34.482, Speaker A: Yeah. Although Bill Ackman has clearly moved from CNBC to Twitter now.
00:09:34.616 - 00:09:55.290, Speaker D: True. That's true. He's playing a different game now. Yeah, I don't know. But Larry Fink has been kind of alluding to the fact that he thinks ether ETF is going to launch this year. So TLDR, we will definitely be talking about more ETF stuff later this year. It seems like right now a lot of people are speculating that it's going to happen mid year, sometime in the summer.
00:09:55.290 - 00:10:04.110, Speaker D: May seems to be the time. I don't know. Robert, as the resident ETF expert, what's your view on ether ETF and likelihoods there?
00:10:04.260 - 00:11:20.326, Speaker C: Well, I think the important thing is to understand why people think it's going to happen in May. And the reason why people think it's going to happen in May at this point is because the applications by Blackrock and others for ether ETFs have a final decision date in May, and everyone thinks it's going to follow the exact same pattern of the bitcoin ETFs, where when it finally gets to Blackrock's ETF, the SEC is obviously going to prove it. Because what's Blackrock's record? What is it, like 850 to one or something like that, between getting an ETF approved versus rejected. And it'd be unreasonable for the SEC to reject so many ETFs again without having a good differentiated rationale for why they would even be rejected in the first place. Because if you look at the underlying thought process, well, they approved ether futures ETFs in the same way that they approved bitcoin futures ETFs. And then based on the court decision in grayscale versus SEC, they had to acknowledge that there isn't enough of a difference between futures and spot as the underlying. And if they've already gone and approved futures, they may as well approve spot as well.
00:11:20.326 - 00:11:51.006, Speaker C: And so there's a couple of different small leaps of logic, but very basic, obvious ones that, well, if there's an ether futures ETF that's already live, and there's all of these ether spot applications all coming due in May, that's when it's going to go live. No one can confirm it, no one can guarantee it. But if you're a betting person, a lot of people are now betting on this as being this sort of like, straightforward, it's going to happen event, and that's going to be the timeframe of it.
00:11:51.108 - 00:12:13.234, Speaker A: Thing I was going to try to say is like, if you read Gary's whiny letter, though, he's like, we'll never. It makes it sound like the opposite, right? It's like, wow, we didn't want to approve this. This doesn't have my approval. Okay, why did you vote for it, but then immediately goes after everything else? So do you really think ethers futures ETF is possible given that type of language?
00:12:13.282 - 00:12:13.880, Speaker D: Yes.
00:12:14.650 - 00:12:53.538, Speaker C: If you look at his statements after he gets on TV, after the approval, he was basically saying, this is an ETF. That's a cash ETF. That's cabin to exposure to one commodity asset, and it's wrapped in a nice security form. And so what's there really to be afraid of? At the end of the day was basically the statement. And after the bitcoin spot ETF has gone live, we have seen significantly less volatility in bitcoin. We haven't really seen any market dislocations or abnormalities. It almost seems like a boring morning after.
00:12:53.538 - 00:13:07.206, Speaker C: And if you look at how boring the post ETF launch is, I think it should be a relief to the SEC and to market participants that this is not as exciting as people thought.
00:13:07.228 - 00:13:07.786, Speaker B: It was going to be.
00:13:07.808 - 00:13:13.260, Speaker C: It was more a political process to reject it and then eventually approve it.
00:13:14.910 - 00:14:08.140, Speaker D: Yeah, I think the other side of that too, is that ether's future ETF is regulated by the now, obviously, Gary Genzler has been very evasive on answering the question to anybody who asks, is ether a security? But through his behavior, we can kind of see that he's actually conceded the ground. Because if the ether futures, if ether is a security, then ether futures are also securities, and therefore they should be regulated not by the CFTC, but by the SEC. And the fact that the SEC was like, yeah, it's fine. We don't need to regulate that. And they gave the jurisdiction to the CFTC, basically means that they've already conceded that, hey, this thing does not need to be under our kind of regulatory thumb. And so I think it's hard now for them to undo that decision, even though, yes, they've not publicly said that, hey, ether is not a security.
00:14:10.130 - 00:14:27.346, Speaker A: But to be fair, hasn't there always been the like, hey, proof of stake is not the like. I do remember there were all these SEC proclamations around. That's what I'm saying. I don't know how those, to be.
00:14:27.368 - 00:14:58.540, Speaker D: Clear, those were very vague statements. And I think most of that, what that is referring to is like staking intermediaries. I think people saw the very broad language and were like, oh my God, he thinks proof of stake is a security, which is like, not at all. He did not literally say that. And the pattern of enforcement has been very, very clear. They're going after staking intermediaries when they claim that Seoul, right? Like Kraken, like Coinbase. When they say that Sol is security or near is security, or this is security, that is security.
00:14:58.540 - 00:15:21.330, Speaker D: The argument made is, well, look, they do proof of stake, therefore it's a security. Not once has he ever levied that argument against an asset. It's always about issuance, and here there's a team and blah, blah, blah. So I think that's a misreading of what the SEC has claimed. They were very vague, but obviously staking does not. That's such a tortured argument that staking would make something a security. And that's not what the SEC has literally claimed.
00:15:24.000 - 00:15:25.870, Speaker A: Okay, well, that's good to know because.
00:15:26.340 - 00:15:44.224, Speaker D: It'S a meme that has gotten very popular on crypto Twitter. That somehow Gary Gensler thinks that staking makes you a security, which is just not true. So anyway, cool. So other news. Circle has filed confidentially filed for an IPO. Well, I guess not that confidential.
00:15:44.272 - 00:15:45.780, Speaker C: Congratulations, Circle.
00:15:46.680 - 00:15:59.176, Speaker D: Well, they haven't ipoed yet. Right. And obviously it is kind of an icy IPO environment. And it also has been, as we've. I think we talked about this in our end of year episode. It's been a relatively rough year for Circle. Well, 2023 was.
00:15:59.176 - 00:16:19.016, Speaker D: So USDC market share has gotten hit pretty bad. I think it's gone down from 55 billion at the peak now to like 25 billion. And at the same time, interest rates are projected to compress. Right. So, like, the ten year is down, five years down. So the expectation is that interest rates are going to decline this year. We're going to start seeing rate cuts.
00:16:19.016 - 00:16:30.820, Speaker D: And that means that it's a big blow to the business model of all the stablecoins. So if interest rates go towards 2%, two and a half percent, that's basically chopping your revenue in half on a going forward basis.
00:16:33.800 - 00:17:00.030, Speaker C: It's not chopping in half the revenue of Blackrock, who is managing all the assets behind USDC. They're going to make their 20 basis points regardless of how much circle makes, which is when we go back to why is Larry Fink so excited about crypto all of a sudden? It's yet another arrow in the quiver of why Larry is so excited about crypto is because he's going to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of usdc growth, especially in a lower rate.
00:17:02.560 - 00:17:12.400, Speaker D: Very true, very true. So anyway, USDC going public, how do you guys think this is going to be received in financial markets?
00:17:14.980 - 00:17:31.312, Speaker C: I think terribly terrible. And I'll just say that now, simply because Coinbase was so poorly received by the public markets, because the public market said, oh, crypto is volatile, it has cycles, the revenue is not predictable.
00:17:31.376 - 00:17:37.012, Speaker D: It's all based on when Coinbase came out, when it actually did IPO. It was a blockbuster IPO.
00:17:37.076 - 00:17:59.528, Speaker C: I know. And then after that, as the market direct. Yes. And after that, as the crypto market itself cooled, the public markets did not treat Coinbase very well at all. I mean, Coinbase went from $300 to in the 30s with the three handle. Right. Because of the volatile nature of its revenue and income.
00:17:59.528 - 00:19:03.700, Speaker C: And I have a feeling that USDC will be and circle will be treated the same way, which is that the market's not going to appreciate the fact that there's cycles and that the stablecoin float grows and shrinks sometimes, and rates go up and down sometimes. I think they're going to see potentially a decreasing revenue story because the total supply of USDC is going down and interest rates are going down and get really afraid. And I personally think circle should have gone public a year ago when the numbers were way bigger. I mean, they tried going public maybe two years ago now through a SPAC, which didn't occur. And so I think the timing of this is a little bit late for circle. And I think that they're going to get perceived negatively in the public markets because it's a declining chart. And even though people in our corner of the world say, well, it's declining now, but just wait another three years, like rocket ship.
00:19:03.700 - 00:19:13.140, Speaker C: I think public markets have less crypto familiarity and just won't vibe with that, so to speak. So I think it's going to be a cool reception.
00:19:13.720 - 00:19:46.508, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm inclined to agree. There was actually a pretty decent thread talking about how a lot of these equities that are sort of pseudo crypto exposure, kind of pre ETF, like Coinbase or microstrategy, basically all the premium is totally compressed with the launch of the ETFs. And I think with Coinbase you could tell a story around, oh, you're buying sort of proxy crypto exposure. You're getting some convexity to public markets, which kind of goes both ways, but market goes back up. Coinbase does well with circles. It's a tougher story, right, because it's like interest rates go down. Well, that's also circle's revenue.
00:19:46.508 - 00:20:01.910, Speaker B: And we haven't even seen a clear story that that would even lead to more issuance. So it's like you're not buying sort of pass through exposure to bitcoin, which you might not even want anymore because you have the BTF. What are you really buying with this business unless you think there's some totally new third category that they're building out?
00:20:02.520 - 00:20:30.592, Speaker D: Well, I mean, people have seen. Here's my bullcase for circle. So one is that, okay, right now, circle is $25 billion, roughly, of USDC, currently at 5% interest rates. I'm sure they're paying a little bit to Blackrock and all these other people in the middle, but more or less 5%. That's like over a billion dollars in revenue per year. That should be basically all margin, right? Their fixed costs are pretty minimal for managing a gigantic stablecoin. So I think that is a really attractive business.
00:20:30.592 - 00:21:08.044, Speaker D: Super high margin. It's very, very predictable relative to Coinbase. Which is extremely volatile with crypto markets. And so it's much easier to forecast their revenue, which I think Wall street is going to like that. The second thing is that everyone knows that stablecoin regulation is coming. And to the extent that stablecoin regulation does arrive, it's very likely in my mind to favor circle over Tether, which are basically the only two stablecoin issuers who matter at this point. And I think it's very likely if you see regulation that basically says you need a banking charter to issue a US dollar stablecoin, that circle gets one, and tether, it's like, oh, I don't know, we don't quite trust you.
00:21:08.044 - 00:21:54.036, Speaker D: And they basically kind of get regulated out of existence potentially, if that happens. Third, okay, so there's a strong regulatory story there, I think, that is relatively foreseeable. And then third is just this perception that stablecoins are growing, which, okay, maybe they didn't grow too much in the last couple of years, but obviously it was a pretty choppy environment for a lot of reasons. But I think most people would expect that, especially if you see stablecoin regulation, stablecoin issuance is going to grow significantly over the next few years, and circle is going to benefit from that just as much as anybody else is. So I think most people project that stablecoins are not going to sit around at the order of magnitude of 100 billion of stablecoins. What is it, like 130, 40 total stablecoins? Something like that. I don't think most people think it's going to be sideways.
00:21:54.036 - 00:22:07.820, Speaker D: So yes, interest rates are going to chop in half, but I think most people predict that stable coins are going to grow by more than two x over the period of time while rates are getting cut. There's my bullcase for circle.
00:22:08.160 - 00:22:43.690, Speaker B: Yeah, I would agree with you. I think if they ran the company more like tether, like, in some ways they are kind of the coinbase of stablecoins, where they're doing things the right Silicon Valley, us regulated way, but they're in Boston. The downside is like, the actual employee costs are massive, right? Like tether made, what, like almost $200 million per employee. Super bare bones operation. Coinbase circles did a bunch of layoffs. They have a very large staff, so they're actually not extremely profitable. Even though you're right on paper, hey, running a stablecoin business is actually like a great business.
00:22:43.690 - 00:22:54.220, Speaker B: But I hear you on the regulatory bit. But the flip side is FTX was able to acquire a shitty bank and get a bank charter I don't see why tether wouldn't be able to. But maybe that's thinking too optimistically.
00:22:55.280 - 00:23:02.960, Speaker D: Isn't it a different charter or something? There's like some weird thing that they want for stable coin issuers. Is it just, you own a bank charter?
00:23:03.460 - 00:23:04.064, Speaker B: I don't know.
00:23:04.102 - 00:23:07.696, Speaker D: In the bill, does anyone know? Good question.
00:23:07.798 - 00:23:11.268, Speaker C: We will have Jeremy on a future show to talk about it.
00:23:11.354 - 00:23:11.604, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:23:11.642 - 00:23:14.208, Speaker B: No shame. We do love circle.
00:23:14.384 - 00:23:16.630, Speaker D: Yeah, that's right. Yeah. No, Jeremy's the man.
00:23:18.040 - 00:23:53.372, Speaker A: Yeah. I would also put myself in the. I don't think it will perform super well, not because of all the things you said, but I actually feel like because it's so easy to underwrite in terms of pricing it, it will get valued like a REIT or a bond fund, and it won't get this extravagant pe ratio type of thing. It won't be treated as a tech company, it'll be treated like a REIT, almost. Right. Which has no premium right now in the current market. So I just kind of feel like people might just view it as a bond.
00:23:53.436 - 00:24:02.740, Speaker D: I don't know if that's true. Stablecoins are one of the only things that tradfi. People who like crypto are like, look, I don't know about all this crypto stuff, but, like, dollars on a blockchain.
00:24:04.920 - 00:24:37.116, Speaker A: I totally get what you're saying, but I just feel like people will look at the cash flows of this, and then they'll look at the cash flows of a reit and they'll say it reminds them of it, or it reminds them of a bond fund. It's this kind of paradox people always talk about, which is like, invest in a company with no revenue, but a story people will give valuation X. Invest in a company that has story adjacent to that one and has a ton of revenue, it gets a valuation less than X.
00:24:37.138 - 00:24:37.276, Speaker D: Right.
00:24:37.298 - 00:25:19.852, Speaker A: Like, you can always dream of this kind of like, oh, anything could happen once it doesn't have revenue, but once it's locked in the cage, it becomes a lot harder. And in particular, public markets very rarely are, I think, as egregious as crypto, let's say, with the narrative running ahead of the usage or fees or revenue. And I think in this case, they're just literally going to be like, okay, this is kind of a bond fund. It has this cash flow analysis that looks like a very boring company that won't get a P. Very high. And I think that's the problem. To me, it's not a problem.
00:25:19.852 - 00:25:27.560, Speaker A: It's really amazing. They're able to hopefully have this liquidity. I just am saying I think it looks too much like what a spreadsheet monkey.
00:25:27.640 - 00:25:47.190, Speaker C: Here is my non financial advice for Jeremy. If there was a USDC equity token and it was airdropped to everyone who's ever used USDC, I guarantee you the market cap on that token would be like four X. What it would be as a.
00:25:49.400 - 00:26:02.570, Speaker A: My favorite, favorite tweet today was someone pointing out that the market cap of bonk on Salana is greater than spirit airlines after the antitrust decision killed their market cap.
00:26:05.020 - 00:26:07.240, Speaker D: Okay. Unfortunate.
00:26:09.100 - 00:26:12.152, Speaker B: The crypto markets are very good, effectively.
00:26:12.216 - 00:26:14.556, Speaker D: Yeah, that's right. As we've learned very well over the.
00:26:14.578 - 00:26:41.510, Speaker A: Last few years, let me tell you. Yeah, the utility of bonk is clearly, clearly higher than that of spirit airlines. But I just am trying to say, I think there is this tradfi problem, which is like, if you look to tradfi, good luck with your multiple. It needs to look like foreign or like a little bit. And circle's business doesn't kind of look foreign. No, it sounds dumb, but it's just true. People want some.
00:26:41.510 - 00:26:44.544, Speaker A: Imagine there's nothing imagined.
00:26:44.592 - 00:26:46.688, Speaker D: Yeah. If you look foreign, you get a better rate.
00:26:46.794 - 00:26:53.016, Speaker B: You can stake your USDC and run a. I think that. And then you get yield or something.
00:26:53.038 - 00:26:53.336, Speaker D: I don't know.
00:26:53.358 - 00:26:54.828, Speaker B: You tell a story.
00:26:54.914 - 00:27:00.552, Speaker C: I'm all about that. Oh, Jeremy, if you're listening, we need that USDC staking to run the validator for USDC.
00:27:00.616 - 00:27:04.444, Speaker A: USDC roll up. USDC roll up.
00:27:04.482 - 00:27:08.130, Speaker B: Post the data on Celestia. I think that is how you get 200.
00:27:09.380 - 00:27:20.204, Speaker D: We got it. I feel like we're about to get, like, hard retweeted by USTC bull. You know that guy's Tarun?
00:27:20.252 - 00:27:21.520, Speaker C: I thought that's his alt.
00:27:22.340 - 00:27:23.740, Speaker D: Tarun has a lot of alts.
00:27:23.900 - 00:27:51.004, Speaker A: Yeah, he has, like, 32. I don't have any alts because I don't like giving myself schizophrenia. I think people who have alts, when you meet them in person, A, there's always the like, is anyone looking while I'm using my phone? And then there's the b, like them worried about someone who has figured it out. And then it's like, I feel like there's just so much.
00:27:51.202 - 00:27:57.950, Speaker C: Well, this is why we had gort on the show last episode, so that people would no longer speculate that it was Tarun or myself or anyone else.
00:27:58.640 - 00:28:06.640, Speaker D: It did kind of sound like Tarun, to be honest. Actually, if I think about it just, like, with a little twang, I feel like, yeah, that could have been Tarune with a voice changer.
00:28:07.620 - 00:28:10.704, Speaker A: AI make it hard for me to prove that.
00:28:10.742 - 00:29:01.264, Speaker D: That's true. That's true. So speaking of USCC, there was also some news this week about tether. There was a UN report about tether talking about, I think it was the casino underground banking report, which claimed that tether is used for a lot of Southeast Asia based human trafficking and pig butchering scams. So actually I'm in Singapore right now, and I was hearing a lot of people talk about these southeast asian slavery fraud farms where basically they will enslave people, like literally kidnap and enslave them and get them to work in these fraud compounds. And basically they're not allowed to go home until they work off their whatever, slavery debt or something. And a lot of what they are doing is crypto romance scams.
00:29:01.264 - 00:29:48.240, Speaker D: So they are just sitting there all day messaging people on telegram or whatever. When you get a WhatsApp message, it's like, hi, pick me up at four. And you're just like, what's going on? These are people who are basically trying to get you into some kind of romance scam. They'll eventually tell you, hey, I'm whatever, some beautiful woman from such and such place, or maybe men too, I don't know. And I'm very successful, and I made a lot of money through crypto, and I love yield farming, and there's this great yield farm that you should try and they get you to send money, and this is a huge thing and they make a lot of money doing it. And apparently the most common asset they use is tether. And so the un called out tether for being used, I guess, in these kind of scams.
00:29:48.240 - 00:30:32.720, Speaker D: I don't know that there's really that much that tether can do about this kind of thing. It seems like, okay, well, if it's not tether, it's going to be bitcoin or ether or whatever, if anything, tether, it's probably better they're using tether because it can actually get frozen relative to other assets. But then on the other side, the other story about Tether was that Howard Lutnick, who is the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, was on, I guess he was on CNBC the other day, and he basically said like, yeah, Tether has all the money. We saw it, we managed a lot of their money and it's all there. So tough shit. Tether truth ers. So, yeah, any reflections on tether slavery? Fraud rings, reactions.
00:30:34.660 - 00:31:00.180, Speaker B: Love to see Tether truth ers eat it. That's great. I don't know. I mean, I do wonder at a certain point, I feel like you have to put an expiry on your predictions or your doom saying. And I feel like tether truth errs have gotten a free ride basically since 2017 on talking shit about tether. And I feel like some way to put a stake in the ground as to when you think the tether fraud will be revealed. Otherwise you just sound insane.
00:31:00.180 - 00:31:09.420, Speaker B: It's like 911 truth. It's been 20 years. You haven't come up with any great fraud evidence yet. It just feels like these people shouldn't be able to get a free ride.
00:31:12.400 - 00:31:40.964, Speaker A: In terms of the southeast asian money laundering stuff, like the laoshian and cambodian borders are, I guess, the most famous places for where these things are because people are like, I guess like chinese mobsters or something somehow control these brothels. Whatever. It's in the other FTX book. Number go down or whatever the other one. Zeke Fox. Number go up. Number go up.
00:31:41.002 - 00:31:41.590, Speaker D: Sorry.
00:31:42.140 - 00:31:47.480, Speaker A: He spends a book. He has a chapter covering this. Sorry, I should have.
00:31:47.630 - 00:31:53.130, Speaker D: Whatever the spoiler is, that number go down after. Number go up. That's the spoiler anyway.
00:31:55.180 - 00:32:24.468, Speaker A: But I think the thing about this type of stuff is if you look at it historically, it was kind of just done in USD before. Actually, people didn't even want to use rumin before it. So it's almost like it's more in the open when it's done in tether. So I don't know. Obviously it's really bad and it's ethically malicious and stuff, but I actually think it's probably more transparent that it's happening than it was when it was done in cash.
00:32:24.554 - 00:32:27.396, Speaker D: Yeah. To be clear, part of the story was that.
00:32:27.418 - 00:32:28.692, Speaker A: I'm not trying to say there's any.
00:32:28.746 - 00:32:36.376, Speaker D: Yeah. Part of the story was that tether and OKX both collaborated to freeze 225,000,000 that was connected to one of these.
00:32:36.478 - 00:32:39.576, Speaker A: I don't think you could have done that. I don't think you could have done that.
00:32:39.598 - 00:32:45.960, Speaker B: Nigerian prince email scans. Wire me a money. Doing it for a very long time. Yeah. Gift cards.
00:32:46.040 - 00:32:47.004, Speaker D: Send me a gift card.
00:32:47.042 - 00:32:50.380, Speaker A: Send me a gift card. Was surprisingly effective.
00:32:51.680 - 00:32:58.030, Speaker B: It's the IRS. You owe back taxes. You need. Send me $100 Amazon gift card. It's a thing.
00:32:58.880 - 00:33:00.332, Speaker D: I did not know this. Wow.
00:33:00.386 - 00:33:16.576, Speaker A: No, it's a very. Well, don't you remember all those, like, bitcoin gift card companies for a while? I mean, that whole market was bootstrapped off. The fact that people were, like, trading gift cards and some of the gift card demand was certainly illicit.
00:33:16.688 - 00:33:26.680, Speaker D: Yeah, that's so bizarre. I've never seen that, like, gift card scams of, like, I don't know how you would convince somebody that you're a very important person and you need Amazon gift cards.
00:33:27.980 - 00:33:28.916, Speaker A: You work with the tools.
00:33:28.948 - 00:33:30.056, Speaker B: You're know.
00:33:30.158 - 00:33:55.760, Speaker D: Yeah, fair enough. Exactly. Well, USDT, I guess, is a boon to both, to pig butcherers, which is the name, know these people who do these kind of romance scam type things. And then it's also a boon to law enforcement. So obviously, both sides are turbocharged, I think, in this new stablecoin future that we all live, so. Okay. Next up on news.
00:33:55.760 - 00:34:22.552, Speaker D: So Vivek Ramaswamy, friend of the podcast, who we had on an episode not too long ago talking about his campaign, has unfortunately dropped out of the race. Well, fortunately. Unfortunately, depending on how you feel, he's dropped out of the race. I think Iowa primaries did not go his way. He was a pretty distant fourth behind Trump, of course, who swept the primaries and then. What's her names? Nikki Haley. What's his face?
00:34:22.606 - 00:34:23.700, Speaker B: Ron Desantis.
00:34:23.860 - 00:34:25.876, Speaker D: Big face. Yeah. Ron Desantis.
00:34:26.068 - 00:34:27.848, Speaker B: Meatball Ron, they call him.
00:34:28.014 - 00:34:32.920, Speaker D: He has a big face. Do you not believe he has a big face? I feel like his face is, like, very large and flat.
00:34:33.000 - 00:34:35.068, Speaker A: I don't think I even thought about that.
00:34:35.234 - 00:34:38.488, Speaker B: That's why they call him meatball Ron. Yeah, it's a meatball round.
00:34:38.584 - 00:34:40.476, Speaker A: I had to really think about what.
00:34:40.498 - 00:34:43.260, Speaker C: He'S meatball Ron.
00:34:45.460 - 00:34:49.700, Speaker D: Because of the shape of his face, or is there a meatball anecdote about him?
00:34:49.850 - 00:34:53.140, Speaker B: It doesn't matter, I think, but I suspect it just looks.
00:34:53.210 - 00:34:53.910, Speaker D: Hey, wait.
00:34:56.600 - 00:35:40.176, Speaker A: Since it's a podcast about news speculation, I would love to talk about Vivek. Almost immediately after dropping out, went to endorse Trump and went to New Hampshire to go be on stage. Let's suppose he is a cabinet member or VP or whatever. Where do you think he ends up slotting up if, say, he's like, joins because he folded? This feels like a thing in poker. He's folded and was like, hey, I'm just going to team up with them.
00:35:40.198 - 00:35:54.950, Speaker D: Oh, totally. Yeah, he folded his hand and then he's going to sit beside the chip leader and be like, oh, yeah, it would be amazing if he were the VP pick, but there's almost no way he's going to be like, I think Trump.
00:35:55.500 - 00:36:02.056, Speaker A: I feel like VP is pretty useless. I would rather it just be like, secretary of mean.
00:36:02.078 - 00:36:31.248, Speaker D: I don't think you'd be Treasury. I think if he were VP, because Trump has so few actual opinions on policy, I think basically Vivek would set policy and Trump would just be like, cool, yeah, that sounds great. Let's go on. Actually be. I think you basically get Vivek policies and Trump rhetoric. If Vivek were VP, but I think there's almost no way he's going to be VP. He probably gets some kind of cabinet thing, and it's probably not going to be super interesting, like FDA or something.
00:36:31.414 - 00:36:33.741, Speaker B: I was going to say, remember when Trump won in 2016?
00:36:33.741 - 00:36:33.856, Speaker D: And.
00:36:33.888 - 00:36:48.948, Speaker B: And there was a brief moment where people were like, oh, biology is going to run the FDA. And I feel like this is like a very kind of perverted spiritual successor where it's like, it's not quite biology, but got a little bit of that, got the biotech thing. It's not really 2016 anymore, but it's.
00:36:48.964 - 00:36:52.232, Speaker A: Like, well, biology hates America. As you can tell.
00:36:52.286 - 00:36:53.188, Speaker B: He didn't get to run the FDA.
00:36:53.204 - 00:37:19.596, Speaker D: I don't think he was. Well, he was planning to basically dismantle the FDA. And I think if you remember when the idea of him becoming head of the FDA was floated, he immediately deleted all of his Twitter history. And the only tweet he had left was. It was some tweet of like, don't argue to build the future. And it was basically like, okay, I got to flush out all my tweets where I'm like, abolish the FDA. FDA is bullshit.
00:37:19.596 - 00:37:47.692, Speaker D: FDA is a piece of shit. Because I think if he were to actually become head of the FDA, that would be his goal. And I suspect the same would be true for were, but it would be more above board, I think, for Ramaswamy than for Balaji, because I think he's been more outspoken in that regard. So it'd be interesting. I mean, the one thing is clear is that if Ramaswami has influence in a trump presidency, I think that would be very good for crypto. That's pretty clear. Trump.
00:37:47.692 - 00:37:52.892, Speaker D: It's hard for me to tell, actually, how a Trump presidency would go for crypto right now.
00:37:53.026 - 00:37:58.780, Speaker A: You're telling me those NFTs he sold on Polygon aren't the real deal?
00:37:58.850 - 00:38:03.090, Speaker D: I don't know that he even knows about them. That's the thing. It's hard for me to tell.
00:38:04.500 - 00:38:11.860, Speaker A: I would love a debate host to ask Trump if he has ever used a wallet and or what RPC.
00:38:14.760 - 00:38:27.112, Speaker B: I think the NFT holders also get, like, a lunch or something, or like, one person gets a lunch with trump. So he must have some awareness of the trading cards. The trading card. Like. But yeah, I don't think he's ever.
00:38:27.166 - 00:38:33.032, Speaker D: Maybe just told them they're trading cards. It's possible they understand what are.
00:38:33.086 - 00:38:39.696, Speaker C: No, no, I've watched the video. He goes like, buy my trump nfts. They're amazing. He knows they're nfts.
00:38:39.748 - 00:38:40.300, Speaker D: Really?
00:38:40.450 - 00:38:40.764, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:38:40.802 - 00:38:43.832, Speaker D: You watched the video. Did you buy any trump nfts?
00:38:43.976 - 00:38:45.550, Speaker C: I can't talk about that.
00:38:46.480 - 00:38:49.184, Speaker D: Okay. No, sorry. No financial advice on the show.
00:38:49.302 - 00:38:54.048, Speaker A: Wow. That was the first time you've done that in a while because remember, I.
00:38:54.054 - 00:38:57.360, Speaker C: Bought, and I'm embarrassed to admit this to trump NFts.
00:38:58.260 - 00:39:02.428, Speaker D: Which ones did you buy? Can we see? Couldn't.
00:39:02.524 - 00:39:06.900, Speaker C: You didn't know what you were getting? It was like a blind know. You purchase an NFT and then it gets.
00:39:06.970 - 00:39:13.288, Speaker D: Oh, you minted. Okay. I didn't buy in secondary market. I did not. What were they? What were they? What were they?
00:39:13.454 - 00:39:18.890, Speaker C: One where he's throwing money in the air. It's like raining money around him.
00:39:20.940 - 00:39:23.288, Speaker D: Okay, great. What's the second one?
00:39:23.454 - 00:39:24.216, Speaker C: I forget the other.
00:39:24.238 - 00:39:24.936, Speaker D: I think it was just like, him.
00:39:24.958 - 00:39:28.008, Speaker C: Wearing, like, construction hard hat or something. It was really boring.
00:39:28.184 - 00:39:36.764, Speaker D: A construction hard hat. Okay. Wow, this is very exciting. Do you still hold them or do you sell them?
00:39:36.962 - 00:39:38.430, Speaker C: I hold one.
00:39:39.120 - 00:39:40.456, Speaker D: So you're a believer.
00:39:40.648 - 00:39:42.910, Speaker C: Yeah, you got to hold them.
00:39:43.700 - 00:39:48.752, Speaker D: Okay, which one? I assume you kept the hard hat because that's the one you keep, right?
00:39:48.886 - 00:39:55.908, Speaker C: No, I think I sold the hard hat for roughly what I bought it for, and I kept the money in the air making reading Trump because I.
00:39:55.914 - 00:40:00.020, Speaker D: Think that was slightly more like a zombie.
00:40:01.320 - 00:40:02.676, Speaker B: Got. You got the rare Trump?
00:40:02.778 - 00:40:03.672, Speaker C: I got the rare Trump.
00:40:03.726 - 00:40:09.928, Speaker D: You never let go of those. Yeah. You got the rare? Yeah. Hold on. Exciting. Damn. Wow.
00:40:09.928 - 00:40:10.584, Speaker D: I know.
00:40:10.622 - 00:40:13.816, Speaker C: That was my dirty do.
00:40:13.838 - 00:40:31.856, Speaker D: So you. Okay, so Trump did the commercial for the NFT. So I guess he does know what NFTs are. And Milani, of course, did nfts as well. So it's like runs of the family. So, yeah, I don't know. But then he's also been on record, at least in his last administration, saying that bitcoin is bad and evil and he doesn't trust it.
00:40:31.856 - 00:40:58.484, Speaker D: And something, something and just a general just trust of new things, I think seems pretty central to his character. So that said, he's incredibly commercial, and if crypto people pay him, I'm sure he'll be like, great. I love crypto. Crypto is wonderful. So I don't know. But right now, prediction markets are putting Trump as the frontrunner. He's edged out now over Biden.
00:40:58.484 - 00:41:29.350, Speaker D: I think if you go to my favorite site, electionbettingods.com, which aggregates a bunch of markets, including Betfair polymarket, which is a crypto prediction market, he is right now sitting at 43.2% to win the presidency, Biden at 32.6. So right now, there's not a huge edge, but significant edge to Republicans potentially win. But of course, we're quite a ways out. So there are a lot's going to change between now and then. Anyway.
00:41:29.350 - 00:41:39.830, Speaker D: I don't know. Those are kind of all the interesting stories. Anything else that you guys want to chat about before we wrap for the week?
00:41:43.080 - 00:41:44.310, Speaker C: This might be what.
00:41:45.640 - 00:41:53.850, Speaker D: Yeah, we were just lamenting that what we're actually excited about. And I was saying that there's not a ton that I'm excited about right now. What are you guys excited about?
00:41:55.260 - 00:41:57.370, Speaker C: Tweet at us. Talk to us.
00:41:59.660 - 00:42:04.108, Speaker D: No, I was asking the audience. I was asking the three of you.
00:42:04.194 - 00:42:06.728, Speaker C: I thought you were speaking to the audience directly.
00:42:06.904 - 00:42:28.550, Speaker D: No, what are you guys excited about? I asked this question to the audience. There were a few topics that people wanted us to talk about, but we want to do separate shows for them. So we're probably going to do a show on parallel evms. We're going to definitely do a show on modularity. There are a few other things that people were clamoring about. What about the three of you? What are you guys excited about this year or right now?
00:42:29.640 - 00:42:44.004, Speaker A: I want some more. Given that now the Solana phone has reanimated, emerged, I want more of those like banana phone Solana phone memes. Like the ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring Solana.
00:42:44.132 - 00:42:45.208, Speaker D: That's what you're excited about?
00:42:45.294 - 00:42:46.792, Speaker A: A bunch, when it first came?
00:42:46.926 - 00:42:47.368, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:42:47.454 - 00:43:01.008, Speaker A: I thought that was hilarious. I'm excited to see more of the banana phone Solana phone memes because now there are going to be more, as we learned. Also talk about a recovery. Right? Weren't they going to stop, if I remember correctly, and then all of a.
00:43:01.014 - 00:43:06.012, Speaker C: Sudden it was bonk bonk that brought back Solana phone bonk.
00:43:06.156 - 00:43:08.140, Speaker A: And then the chain of airdrops.
00:43:08.220 - 00:43:43.310, Speaker C: And the chain of airdrops. So what happened was the Solana phone was not popular. There was a huge amount of unsold inventory. And then as bonk and other things started airdropping tokens to these phones, it really went nuts. Once the value of the bonk that was airdropped to each Solana phone exceeded the cost of the phone, and then people were just buying them not only for the arbitrage, because you could buy the phone for less than the crypto on the phone, but based on the expectation of future airdrops. And then every single Solana phone sold out instantly. And now Salana phones back.
00:43:44.320 - 00:44:04.772, Speaker D: Well, the Salona phones on secondary markets are going for, they retail for $1,000 and they're going on secondary markets on eBay for like 3000. So just the value of all those airdrops and the bonk and all that other shit on the phone is worth way more than the actual phone. But the new phone is supposed to be half the price. So the new phone is projected to be 450, I believe.
00:44:04.826 - 00:44:05.572, Speaker B: 450?
00:44:05.706 - 00:44:06.004, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:44:06.042 - 00:44:13.270, Speaker B: They're taking orders. They got to be learned too. There's a referral system. I imagine there's going to be points involved at some point.
00:44:14.760 - 00:44:15.280, Speaker D: Sick.
00:44:15.360 - 00:44:16.730, Speaker B: Juicy at this point.
00:44:17.580 - 00:44:24.652, Speaker D: Nice. There's going to be yield farming. It'll be great. Multi sig. Yeah.
00:44:24.706 - 00:44:31.068, Speaker C: No one is going to claim that a phone is a security just because how could think.
00:44:31.154 - 00:44:43.420, Speaker A: I think the ultimate growth plan is figure out how to get this sold at Costco because have you guys seen all the stuff about the gold sales at Costco?
00:44:43.500 - 00:44:43.984, Speaker D: What?
00:44:44.102 - 00:45:07.768, Speaker A: Unreal. Costco started selling gold just directly and there was some quarter recently it made up like 10% of revenue. They're selling so much gold to people and I think Costco is like the right distribution channel for this type of product. I could be wrong on that percentage, but it was like the Bloomberg article was amazing on this.
00:45:07.934 - 00:45:10.600, Speaker B: It sold $100 million in gold last quarter.
00:45:11.660 - 00:45:12.072, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:45:12.126 - 00:45:13.976, Speaker A: Are they selling like gold bars or.
00:45:13.998 - 00:45:15.260, Speaker D: What are they selling? Yeah.
00:45:15.410 - 00:45:16.984, Speaker B: 1Oz gold bars.
00:45:17.032 - 00:45:17.630, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:45:18.640 - 00:45:20.236, Speaker C: Do they buy the gold back?
00:45:20.338 - 00:45:25.704, Speaker A: It's like as much as cash apps, bitcoin, it's like similar order magnitude.
00:45:25.752 - 00:45:29.640, Speaker D: So it's like, what is the margin that Costco takes on selling gold?
00:45:29.800 - 00:45:31.084, Speaker C: I mean, not right.
00:45:31.122 - 00:45:31.864, Speaker B: It's wholesale.
00:45:31.912 - 00:45:32.076, Speaker C: Sure.
00:45:32.098 - 00:45:32.552, Speaker A: It's high.
00:45:32.626 - 00:45:41.076, Speaker B: They monetize the membership and that's why people want to buy their gold. You're getting great execution, but I think.
00:45:41.098 - 00:45:46.368, Speaker A: This is great for the Solana phone because Costco's not paying for their drops.
00:45:46.464 - 00:45:46.820, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:45:46.890 - 00:46:04.472, Speaker C: Here's the question. Will Costco buy the gold back? So can you speculate using Costco where you basically buy gold through Costco like an amm? Yeah. Hold it and then sell it back to Costco? Or is it like a one way flow where they're just letting people buy gold?
00:46:04.536 - 00:46:09.100, Speaker B: You can probably return it and you can use it to hedge. Right. Buy a bunch of gold.
00:46:15.280 - 00:46:33.620, Speaker A: I'm just saying. I'm just saying. I think the Solana phone at Costco, because Anatoly is like Costco dad. They could literally make, like the Costco dad memes, and that shit would sell kind of. I kind of think that's the demographic. That's where you got to go. You got to sell the Salana phone at Costco.
00:46:33.620 - 00:46:37.140, Speaker A: That's my hot hack.
00:46:42.600 - 00:46:46.040, Speaker D: This is why Tarun does governance simulations and not growth hacking.
00:46:47.180 - 00:47:01.128, Speaker A: Yeah, whatever. But I do think this $100 million of gold thing was crazy because all these people I knew who were like, oh, bitcoin is so dumb. Then later told me they bought gold at Costco. And I was like, interesting. This is like a funny.
00:47:01.224 - 00:47:06.220, Speaker D: Okay, tell me, who is the demographic of people, you know who are buying gold at Costco?
00:47:10.580 - 00:47:11.810, Speaker A: Indian people.
00:47:13.460 - 00:47:19.364, Speaker D: Indian people are buying gold all the time. So I feel like that's just like a convenience thing. It's just like the closest place, but.
00:47:19.402 - 00:47:24.192, Speaker A: In particular, this fact that there's no cheaper.
00:47:24.256 - 00:47:27.030, Speaker D: Okay, yeah, that's interesting.
00:47:28.440 - 00:47:34.384, Speaker A: But my point is, the Solana phone being this airdrop thing, I feel like this is the. There's so much meme.
00:47:34.432 - 00:47:37.880, Speaker C: Did they buy the gold, though, with an eye towards, like, selling it or flipping?
00:47:39.020 - 00:47:49.660, Speaker D: I'm going to cut the Costco gold thing because this is not about crypto in any way. Robert, what are you excited about? What are you excited about? In excited.
00:47:50.080 - 00:47:51.708, Speaker A: You're not cutting this from the.
00:47:51.794 - 00:47:55.100, Speaker D: No, I'm not cutting from the edit. I'm just cutting this thread. I'm cutting this thread.
00:47:58.340 - 00:48:04.690, Speaker C: One is restaking and two are the myriad different point systems turning into.
00:48:07.540 - 00:48:14.244, Speaker D: Okay, straightforward. Tom, what are you excited about, by the way?
00:48:14.362 - 00:48:19.600, Speaker A: I'm secondly excited about those. I think there's going to be more AVss than there will be roll ups.
00:48:19.680 - 00:48:22.484, Speaker D: It'll be more AVs, yeah.
00:48:22.522 - 00:48:26.260, Speaker C: More picks and shovels than end users.
00:48:27.480 - 00:48:56.444, Speaker A: Well, it's more that, like, I think roll up liquidity fragmentation naturally will lead to some amount of consolidation. The UX is going to be worse and things like that. So there's some carrying capacity on roll ups. But I do think things that need security, whether it's Oracle's weird new cryptographic mechanisms, bootstrapping, all these identity things, I think there's a possibility there's more of those than the set of roll ups. Conditional and liquidity fragmentation.
00:48:56.492 - 00:49:05.830, Speaker D: And for the record, an AVs is something that uses restaking to get its security. That's what an ABS is. Okay, Tom, what are you excited about?
00:49:07.480 - 00:49:39.840, Speaker B: I'm going to sound kind of boring, but actually do too. I do think the tether story is pretty compelling. I think even I'm totally blanking. Oh, Howard Ludnik, when he was on CNBC, he was talking about the fact that, yeah, Americans don't really need stablecoins. Maybe they really want stablecoins. But he's like, yeah, if you live in Turkey, if you live in Argentina, if you live in Venezuela, this is a godsend. And this is like an incredible product.
00:49:39.840 - 00:50:29.870, Speaker B: And so I think overall, it just tells this great story about crypto. It's not really the story that maybe Satoshi wanted or people kind of envisioned, but is this kind of delivering raw, pragmatic utility to people and making their lives better? And I think that's a great story, and I think it's a great stepping stone towards building something better. It's sort of like, shoot, what's the phrase? Worse is better. This is kind of the same kind of philosophy of like, it's a very pragmatic approach to getting this in the hands of people versus bickering about where your roll up is going to post its data. This is actually just kind of delivering on the promise. So I really love the story about it and obviously more being built on there in 2024. And the flip side of this is, I love the crypto casino stuff.
00:50:29.870 - 00:51:03.140, Speaker B: I just think it's so interesting that this has been something that people have been trying to do, and then they've had sort of blips shining through of minor successes throughout the entire history of crypto. And now we're kind of starting to see this thing actually take flight and real traction and real volumes going through these things. Again, I think this is hopefully a stepping stone towards a more open, transparent, fair igaming environment. But it feels like, hey, there's at least something here and people are building and something that people want to use, and that's sort of a great first step towards building sort of that ideal outcome.
00:51:03.300 - 00:51:06.330, Speaker C: What's the number one success story right now?
00:51:07.500 - 00:51:33.700, Speaker B: Well, it depends. I mean, arguably, you'll be staked if you consider it sort of a crypto casino, because I think they do take some crypto deposits. They're gigantic. Like, I think several billion dollars in gross revenue. But rollbit is pretty solid. Stake or shuffle is pretty solid. So there are some decent players, but it feels like we're kind of in the maybe like, Bitfinex Bidmex era of this genre, and we're kind of waiting to see how this thing matures.
00:51:35.640 - 00:51:43.632, Speaker A: What does it need to grow technology or legal clarity or better stable coins that can't rug get rugged.
00:51:43.776 - 00:51:45.610, Speaker B: Wait, better stable coins that can't go.
00:51:48.460 - 00:51:57.304, Speaker A: Do they have to only use tether? Because I feel like for a lot of these casinos, they basically can't use. Some of USCC is probably.
00:51:57.342 - 00:51:59.624, Speaker B: I think some of them do use USDC because they're all licensed.
00:51:59.672 - 00:51:59.884, Speaker D: Right.
00:51:59.922 - 00:52:03.676, Speaker B: This is not truly USCC terms of.
00:52:03.698 - 00:52:11.752, Speaker D: Service, which we've talked about on the show a long time ago. I'm pretty sure that USDC terms of service restrict gambling.
00:52:11.896 - 00:52:14.084, Speaker B: Oh, really? Okay, maybe I'mistaken.
00:52:14.232 - 00:52:23.168, Speaker D: There's like, all this weird stuff that USDC has, like, this long terms of service that's like, no debt settlement, no this, no that. And one of them, I'm pretty sure is gambling.
00:52:23.344 - 00:52:24.070, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:52:25.400 - 00:53:02.352, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm not quite sure. Then I think a lot of these have different flavors. Some of them are truly appealed to crypto people, and that is obviously a somewhat limited segment. Maybe that will grow over time or maybe can go mainstream from there. Some of them Drake live streams for stake, and so it's obviously hyper mainstream. I'm hoping there's something in between of having sort of the nice ux that people like of a mainstream application, but maybe using crypto under the hood, or also, frankly, like, not relying on totally opaque, centralized games to actually run the business logic. I'm hoping there's a little bit more transparency around that at some point.
00:53:02.352 - 00:53:12.630, Speaker B: Or the really is moving to like, a non custodial model will be nice, but right mean, it's kind of like the market is speaking and people are okay with kind of the situation as is.
00:53:16.120 - 00:53:18.900, Speaker A: I mean, Drake has inspired meme coins.
00:53:19.480 - 00:53:20.388, Speaker B: That's true.
00:53:20.554 - 00:53:22.820, Speaker A: We've come full circle. We've come full circle.
00:53:22.900 - 00:53:26.488, Speaker B: That's true. I saw some Anita Max win stickers on the street the other day.
00:53:26.574 - 00:53:27.624, Speaker A: That's exactly.
00:53:27.822 - 00:53:30.040, Speaker B: Yeah, things move faster.
00:53:32.860 - 00:53:37.020, Speaker A: I feel like the casinos are missing out on the meme coins.
00:53:38.800 - 00:54:12.536, Speaker D: Yeah. Okay, so sorry just to follow up here, because I wanted to make sure that I was getting this right, fact checking myself here on Circle's terms of service, because I just like to remind myself and everyone here how this works. So there are certain things called prohibited transactions. In Circle's terms of service, they include anybody who's in a restricted territory, which I think is like, sanctioned countries. So you're not allowed to hold USCC. You cannot use USCC to buy any weapons, including firearms, ammunition, knives. No.
00:54:12.536 - 00:54:24.340, Speaker D: Controlled substances, including narcotics, prescription drugs. If you have a prescription, you're not allowed to use it with USDC related paraphernalia. Steroids, blah, blah, blah.
00:54:24.420 - 00:54:32.984, Speaker A: Just imagining all those guys at Equinox who are just like, oh man, I need my fix. And like, I can't send USDC gambling.
00:54:33.032 - 00:54:48.848, Speaker D: Activities, including but not limited to, sports betting, casino games, horse racing, dog racing. Dog racing games may be classified as gambling, I. E. Poker, or other activities, unless they are authorized by the jurisdiction in which the user is based, as well as the jurisdiction which transaction takes place and provide any such activities comply with all applicable law.
00:54:48.934 - 00:54:52.530, Speaker B: Okay, well, that's why they have hamster racing to get around the US.
00:54:55.080 - 00:54:58.580, Speaker C: Okay, so horses are prohibited. Hamsters are allowed.
00:55:00.280 - 00:55:02.480, Speaker D: They're not explicitly disallowed. I'll say that.
00:55:02.490 - 00:55:03.210, Speaker C: Got it.
00:55:03.820 - 00:55:20.632, Speaker D: No money laundering, surprise prize. No ponzi schemes, pyramid schemes or MLMs. No goods or services that infringe on copyright. So apparently you can't spend USDC to buy. What is it? Obama, Sonic, enu ten, or whatever. Apparently that's not allowed.
00:55:20.776 - 00:55:26.860, Speaker A: Probably even Anita Maxwin. I don't even know if there must be someone who.
00:55:27.010 - 00:55:37.200, Speaker D: No credit repair services or other services that present consumer protection risks. No court order payments, no structured settlements. No tax payments or tax settlements.
00:55:38.660 - 00:55:40.236, Speaker C: No counterfeit goods tax payments?
00:55:40.268 - 00:55:40.848, Speaker D: What?
00:55:41.014 - 00:55:41.916, Speaker B: No tax payments?
00:55:41.948 - 00:55:47.072, Speaker D: Yeah, no tax payments. No court order payments, structured settlements, tax payments, or tax settlements.
00:55:47.216 - 00:55:53.220, Speaker C: I feel like the US government would be super excited if people would pay their taxes in USDC.
00:55:53.900 - 00:55:55.304, Speaker D: Why would they want that?
00:55:55.422 - 00:55:57.560, Speaker C: I don't know. It would arrive instantly.
00:55:59.020 - 00:56:00.008, Speaker B: Yeah, why not?
00:56:00.094 - 00:56:04.024, Speaker A: All the benefits of not having to wait for the mean.
00:56:04.062 - 00:56:08.172, Speaker D: I don't think they want. Well, you can't pay your taxes in treasuries either, can you?
00:56:08.306 - 00:56:13.660, Speaker C: You should be able to do that too. But that's a complex back end process, and who knows how to do it?
00:56:13.730 - 00:56:23.170, Speaker D: USDC. USDC is effectively private money, right? So obviously they don't want you paying in some weird. I mean, whatever, it doesn't matter.
00:56:24.500 - 00:56:31.072, Speaker A: It is true that 99.99% of the usage of USDC probably falls into one of those.
00:56:31.126 - 00:56:32.192, Speaker D: I think so. Right? Yeah.
00:56:32.246 - 00:56:32.732, Speaker A: Hilarious.
00:56:32.796 - 00:56:34.448, Speaker D: And then the last category.
00:56:34.544 - 00:56:37.456, Speaker A: What the fuck do people use USDC for? That doesn't.
00:56:37.568 - 00:56:48.504, Speaker D: The last category is any other matters, goods or services. From time to time, we communicate to you that are unacceptable. Basically. By the way, you can't do this, so fuck you.
00:56:48.542 - 00:56:51.544, Speaker C: Has circle ever enforced that? Ever?
00:56:51.742 - 00:57:19.836, Speaker D: That's the thing. I'm sure they haven't. Right? This is all written by lawyers, so I doubt they've ever enforced any of these things. But technically, FYI, Circle has the most restrictive terms of service of any stable coin that I've seen, and it largely is unchanged from the last time I remember this, which was like two years ago. This basically looks the same. So, yeah, circle is actually the most restrictive by terms of service, which is probably why it's not used in exchanges.
00:57:19.868 - 00:57:22.210, Speaker C: Does tether even have a terms of service?
00:57:23.140 - 00:57:27.328, Speaker D: I'm sure they do. I'm sure they all do. But tether, here's a question near as enumerative.
00:57:27.424 - 00:57:35.080, Speaker C: This is very philosophical. You can obviously be a tether user without Heather ever having seen a terms of service from tether.
00:57:36.620 - 00:57:45.220, Speaker B: It's true for USDC too, right? Someone says USDC? Yeah, unless it's on chain somewhere. I don't know if they put this in their smart claim.
00:57:45.300 - 00:58:18.596, Speaker D: They claim that you abide by these terms of service if you hold the token. So it's kind of sure. Obviously these things have never been tried in court, and I'm sure they would not hold up, because receiving USDC in a wallet, by no means. Anyway. It's almost like, oh, you installed our video game, therefore you are bound by our terms of service, even though you never signed anything or even acknowledged it. Courts have largely viewed that as being non binding and kind of bullshit. I assume the same would probably be true of a stablecoin that just like, arise in your wallet and you're, you know, I'm not.
00:58:18.618 - 00:58:25.510, Speaker B: Pound by shuffle does support USDC. So if any circle lawyers are listening to the go, you can go shut them.
00:58:27.420 - 00:58:42.604, Speaker D: Goodness. Well, no, because it says gambling if it's not allowed in the jurisdiction and by the user, and blah, blah, blah, blah. So if shuffle is compliant, then it's fine. But for Rollbid, it might not be if Rollbid is not compliant, which I might understand. That's kind of curious there.
00:58:42.722 - 00:59:28.060, Speaker C: So let me disclose after reading the source code, there are some terms in the USDC contract code themselves, which I can summarize very quickly. It simply just says, Copyright Center 2018 permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files to deal in the software without restriction, including without limitation, the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and or sell copies of the software, and to permit persons to whom the software is furnished to do so subject to the following conditions. And then there's like no conditions. So the only terms in the actual USDC token contract themselves say go wild.
00:59:29.680 - 00:59:36.648, Speaker B: Apparently you're also not allowed to hold USTC if you're under 18. So I'm sorry to all the miners that are also listening to this podcast.
00:59:36.824 - 00:59:41.692, Speaker D: But miners with an o. Miners, not minor. With.
00:59:41.746 - 00:59:49.276, Speaker A: Yeah, those crypto miners. Crypto miners, not crypto miners. I feel like that's a great shirt to wear to conference.
00:59:49.308 - 00:59:51.196, Speaker D: That does not sound like a good shirt to wear at a conference.
00:59:51.228 - 00:59:53.072, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't know if I would be pro.
00:59:53.126 - 01:00:00.372, Speaker D: Yeah, I would not encourage you. I would very strongly not encourage you to put that on a shirt and arrive at a crypto conference. You will probably get kicked out.
01:00:00.426 - 01:00:06.650, Speaker A: I said crypto minors, not crypto minors. Maybe I should have got the ordering correct.
01:00:07.740 - 01:00:15.370, Speaker D: I think either way, I would discourage you from making that shirt and distributing that shirt out of concern for you as a.
01:00:18.140 - 01:00:20.408, Speaker A: Well, you know, don't use USDC if.
01:00:20.414 - 01:00:27.388, Speaker D: You'Re under eight k. That's right. This is why Tarun is not your growth hacker, but is your governance. Your governance advisor.
01:00:27.444 - 01:00:28.050, Speaker C: It.
01:00:33.220 - 01:00:34.690, Speaker A: There's different types of.
01:00:35.300 - 01:00:46.460, Speaker D: Good. All right, great. Okay, I think with that, we're ready to sign off. Thank you, everybody, and we'll be back next week. Bye.
