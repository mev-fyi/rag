00:00:00.560 - 00:00:11.465, Speaker A: Hi, my name is Veronica Irwin and I am the regulatory reporter at Unchained. And I'm here with Anjan Vinod who is a principal at the venture capital firm Parify. How are you?
00:00:11.625 - 00:00:14.245, Speaker B: Good. Great to be here. Thanks for having me on.
00:00:14.705 - 00:00:29.415, Speaker A: Parify Capital is the single largest investor in the polygon based prediction market polymarket. And so I thought you would be a perfect person to talk to about after this election, how accurate polymarket really was.
00:00:30.275 - 00:00:45.935, Speaker B: Great. Yeah. Excited to excited to have this conversation. And I just want to say upfront that like you mentioned, we're investors in Polymarket and of course any of my views today are just expressed on my own, that my personal views, not the views of Parify.
00:00:46.275 - 00:01:14.915, Speaker A: Got it, got it. Well, thank you for doing this with me. Just to start, this won't be the focus of our interview, but it does kind of feel like something I should acknowledge. It is something that the federal government has been particularly concerned about just after the election. Now that we know at least what the presidency and what the presidency is and who controls the Senate, did Poly Market have any impact on the way that people voted?
00:01:16.215 - 00:02:05.609, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's a, it's a super important question. I think you could take the more quantitative data approach where, you know, I haven't seen quantitative data or evidence that says Poly Market impacted this many votes or had this much impact on a specific state or whatever it may be. But was it part of the political zeitgeist? And political conversation was the center of a lot of the political discussions, whether it was media covering who was expected to win, traditional media like the New York Times covering it all over social media. Absolutely. So I think it's difficult to say to what extent if any Poly Market impacted any voters directly. But I think the most important takeaway was that it did provide the voter base with a new information source. You have traditionally just have polls.
00:02:05.609 - 00:02:47.181, Speaker B: Now you have polls, you had Poly Market, you had social media. So it now is another tool for the voter base to use to understand what's going on with the election and how they should potentially position themselves. And one point I'll add to that is a week before the election, Trump was around 67, 68% on Poly Market. And then as more data came in, the market moved closer to, I think closer to 55, 45. So essentially it's a coin flip at that point. So if you're watching Poly Market and you were in a swing state like Pennsylvania, maybe you would look at that and say, hey, wait a second. Similar to the polls, this is very close.
00:02:47.181 - 00:03:01.205, Speaker B: I need to go out and vote. So I think if anything, because of the gap that closed close to the election, I think it just continued to show heading into election how close the market and the broader voter base saw the election.
00:03:02.345 - 00:03:45.747, Speaker A: And I should say for viewers, depending on who you are, that question might, for me might sound crazy, especially if you're deep in crypto. Crypto has been pretty supportive of Poly Market across the board and dismissive, I guess, of the concerns. But I feel like I do need to raise it just because if you've been reading Unchained, we've been following the lawsuit between the CFTC and Polymarket competitor Kalshi pretty closely. And that is core to the CFTC argument for why they say Kalshi should not be allowed to host election markets in the United States. They basically make this claim that prediction markets could harm election integrity. It seems like it's a two part claim. One of it is.
00:03:45.747 - 00:05:11.175, Speaker A: One part of it is that if it looks like one candidate is seriously going to win by a large margin, that might encourage people to maybe, you know, stand this one out, not vote in the election. It could give that candidate some more momentum and get more people to, to volunteer, for example. And then the second part of that, which obviously we can't even evaluate now, is that if you had one candidate that looked like they were definitely going to win the election, in this case it was Donald Trump and then Donald Trump did not win, that the Poly Market odds that were in his favor could have been used as, I guess, a tool for like an election lie to say, to say that, hey, I should have won, look at what the odds were saying obviously we can't evaluate that now. And for what it's worth, I talked to several pollsters as well as other type of election prediction people ahead of the election, like historian Alan Lichtman, who, you know, basically looks at historical data points to predict who's going to win in the presidential election. And all of them pretty much said that when it comes to the affecting how people vote question, it's kind of a moot point. It could encourage some Democrats to stay out and it could also have encouraged some Republicans to stay out if it looked like it was a definite win for Donald Trump ahead of time. So just wanted to get that out of the way.
00:05:11.175 - 00:05:39.555, Speaker A: I think another thing that we need to talk about obviously is that Polymarket, like you said, it was at like 68% Donald Trump leading up to the election. It showed a much more favorable, I suppose, percentage for Donald Trump than polls, which had this as like a coin flip, had it as super neck and neck. Why is that? What is different about what prediction markets evaluate? Like poly market versus pulse.
00:05:40.175 - 00:06:11.603, Speaker B: Sure. So prediction markets and polls are. They're apples and oranges. So it's super important to understand the nuances and the difference between the two. So if you look at a poll, for example, which have been around for decades, you're taking as a pollster, you're taking a random selection of voters. Could be a couple of hundred few thousand voters, could be in a swing state like Pennsylvania. And then you're serving those voters based on their political beliefs, who they're going to vote for, et cetera.
00:06:11.603 - 00:07:09.435, Speaker B: And then you tally up all those votes, you hope there isn't sampling bias, and then you put out your poll along with some type of margin of error. And hey, here are the results of my poll. That is very different than, let's say, a prediction market, which is measuring the probability or the odds of a certain event occurring. So if there are, you know, 10 polls, high quality, reputable polls that say, hey, a candidate's expected to have 60% of the votes, or our polls say candidate A has 60%, well, then if all those polls are reputable, the prediction market may actually be 80, 90, 95% in terms of the probability of winning. So the prediction market, you know, is probably taking in polling data. It's looking at sentiment data. People may have proprietary data sets, they may be on the ground in these swing states to understand what the real time odds are and facing bets in real time.
00:07:09.435 - 00:07:16.227, Speaker B: But the core difference between a poll and a prediction market is participants actually have skin in the game.
00:07:16.331 - 00:07:16.595, Speaker C: Right?
00:07:16.635 - 00:07:52.141, Speaker B: So if you're right about who is going to win the election in a prediction market, you stand to benefit dramatically. Like Theo, the French trader who won massively after Trump won the election. So, one, you're going to be very thoughtful and careful about where you put your money versus a poll. If you're wrong as a pulser, if there's sampling bias, if there's response bias, meaning you're not able to contact a lot of people and you only collect information from the people who get back to you, well, there really isn't. You don't lose anything. There's no skin in the game for that. And then there's of course, selection bias.
00:07:52.141 - 00:08:31.345, Speaker B: With polls, right, who you choose in that part in that participation base may be very much skewed or biased. So prediction markets tend to abstract that away and just allow the market to come together and figure out if there's a mispricing based on proprietary data, say, data sets, polling sentiment, whatever it may be. So there is definitely a link between the two in terms of polling. Data may influence how the market may view the outcome of a certain event. But you can't compare and say that, hey, polls are at 50, 50. Why is Poly Market at 65, 45? They're two different things, and that's a very important nuance to understand.
00:08:32.085 - 00:09:07.435, Speaker A: I don't know about you, but I personally know several people that bet on prediction markets in the opposite direction from how they were personally voting. It's not necessarily like you bet on who you want to win. You bet on who you think is going to win. I guess, like one, just to play devil's advocate, like, one thing that I've seen online is that there's a. There's a selection bias, maybe with who participates in polymarket as well, just because it is on Polygon. So it's a, you know, it's based on blockchain. And maybe that attracts crypto folks to participate more than people that are not interested in cryptocurrency.
00:09:07.435 - 00:09:30.715, Speaker A: Also, just by its very nature, you kind of have to have money to spend. If you want to bet in a prediction market, you are gambling. So obviously you have some extra money that you think is worth placing a bet with. How does that affect Poly Market? And is there any world where that impacts the percentages that you see?
00:09:31.175 - 00:09:41.167, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think you have to believe in just the concept that there are economically rational individuals where if something is massively mispriced.
00:09:41.271 - 00:09:41.559, Speaker C: Right.
00:09:41.607 - 00:10:20.689, Speaker B: If people are overbidding on Trump odds well before the election, which at one point may have happened. That's why you saw a correction right before the election and went from 67 down to down to 55. Well, there are economically rational people who will look at that and say, wait a second, there's a great opportunity to step in, make money. Let's take the other side of that. So are there enough people in crypto? And keep in mind, polymarket wasn't the only one moving in this fashion. There were other markets out there, Web two, offshore, et cetera, that were also moving in this fashion. There would be an arbitrage if just polymarket was an outlier and moved all the way onto one side and everything else was in a corner.
00:10:20.689 - 00:10:48.973, Speaker B: Well, someone would arbitrage that. But the fact that many times Poly Market may be moving and the rest of the market would catch up or they would be pretty much in line is an indication that there are people arbitraging the different markets and there is people taking the other side if things seem. Things seem mispriced. And what's interesting about the proprietary data sets that you can get in a market approach is Theo, the French trader, actually paid and commissioned to have his own poles.
00:10:49.099 - 00:10:49.457, Speaker C: Right.
00:10:49.521 - 00:10:51.161, Speaker B: To capitalize on the neighbor effect.
00:10:51.233 - 00:10:51.465, Speaker C: Right.
00:10:51.505 - 00:11:21.195, Speaker B: So, you know, he asked to pollster, don't ask the voter who you're going to vote for. Ask who do you think your neighbor will vote for? And indirectly you get to the same result as, hey, who do you think will win the election to what you were saying earlier? So he actually commissioned his own polls and that allowed him to get much better insights than the market. And he noticed a big gap between these polls that were using the neighbor approach of, hey, who do you think your neighbor will vote for versus who do you think the traditional polling approach of who will you vote for?
00:11:21.275 - 00:11:21.491, Speaker C: Right.
00:11:21.523 - 00:11:33.295, Speaker B: He noticed the gap and so he capitalized on that and used that as one of his insights or pieces of alpha. So there are ways for the market to suss out and figure out where there are misprices.
00:11:34.395 - 00:12:11.975, Speaker A: I did not see that. That is fascinating. That's really smart. I guess another thing that I would raise is just the transaction volume that we saw in polymarket was massive. And so I look at that and I almost wonder if that makes any kind of question about sampling a little bit moot or maybe more moot, just because it's not like you had a small sample of people participating. Do you know off the top of your head what the transaction volume ultimately was on the presidential election contract?
00:12:12.675 - 00:12:41.687, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think at the time of closing thing, it was on the UI play market. I think it was about 3.6, 3.7 billion in volume in just that one market. And there are several markets like the popular vote market or who's going to win a specific swing state market. But yeah, all in all, I mean, volume market crossed well over a billion in October. November alone in terms of trading volume was well north of 600 million.
00:12:41.687 - 00:13:19.475, Speaker B: They had more than 150,000 monthly active traders. And obviously the day of the election, there was a lot of volume on the platform. And something that I think is less discussed is most people using polymarket aren't actually traders, right? They're just people opening up the app or the website and just checking the odds in real time. So polymarket jumped to the number two app in the world for people to just download and track the odds in real time. So that's another powerful use case of Polymarket where actually most people using quote unquote, the platform may never actually make a trade or touch any money, but are just consumers of the information as a new source of media or a new form of media.
00:13:19.935 - 00:13:56.135, Speaker A: Totally. I mean, you've seen it used by all sorts of news outlets. It's in the Bloomberg terminal now. Just because it's another data point that measures something different than what we're looking at in the polls. Yeah, it's fascinating. Now that the election is over, there has been some speculation, admittedly I wrote about it myself, just on whether the transaction volume is going to dip in a significant way. Polymarket obviously attracted a ton of attention this year for its election products related to the election that we had on Tuesday.
00:13:56.135 - 00:14:12.745, Speaker A: What are you guys expecting as investors in Polymarket for how many of those users are going to stick around and bet on other types of contracts or how much it's going to drop off until maybe the next presidential election?
00:14:13.525 - 00:14:56.291, Speaker B: Yeah, so I'm expecting a drop off in open interest and volumes right after the election. You're starting to see that over the past 24 hours in terms of the volume and open interest, and that's actually not surprising at all. We were very much expecting that Polymarket essentially built the entire platform and made the direction of the product to make this the most liquid place to bet on the election. So basically the team has been heads down building in that direction for the past more than two years. So it's been very intentional about making this platform about the elections. But the reason that approach was so powerful is now the genie's out of the bottle and now you can take the same structure, use case, take all the validation.
00:14:56.363 - 00:14:56.595, Speaker C: Right.
00:14:56.635 - 00:15:07.633, Speaker B: I mean, Holly Market essentially called the election 5, 10, 12 hours before some media outlets. They called the election in some ways in terms of Republican versus Democrat on October 25th.
00:15:07.729 - 00:15:07.937, Speaker C: Right.
00:15:07.961 - 00:15:21.097, Speaker B: It's the same exact map as you see post, post election, in terms of which states are red, which states are blue. So this concept isn't going away. I think Polymarket is just getting started and now it's figuring out what are the other verticals that they can apply this to.
00:15:21.201 - 00:15:21.441, Speaker C: Right.
00:15:21.473 - 00:15:23.737, Speaker B: So maybe they continue down on politics.
00:15:23.801 - 00:15:24.049, Speaker C: Right.
00:15:24.097 - 00:15:37.027, Speaker B: So who will Trump appoint in his Cabinet? You know, what type of policy decisions will Trump and Congress make? You have the Senate and House races and the midterms as well. So there is still a massive political angle. But then think about sports.
00:15:37.091 - 00:15:37.291, Speaker A: Right?
00:15:37.323 - 00:16:12.265, Speaker B: Polymarket's already very active in sports. The super bowl market is doing quite well. So you have a number of sports related markets that I think will continue to grow. And one big catalyst that the team recently announced, but I think was missed by a lot of people was buried in one of their videos, is create your own market. Where they will allow in the future more people to create their own market. So whether if you're an expert in a certain sport or a certain vertical, you can create your own market. So as the number of markets increases, think about what that could do in terms of the topic areas and focuses that Polymarket could focus on.
00:16:12.265 - 00:16:34.655, Speaker B: Because the team can only focus on so many areas. There's so many other sports, whether it's cricket in India or politics in Asia, whatever it may be. There's a thousand different use cases and verticals the team can't cover by themselves. So that's the next iteration, I think, of the platform, which is moving into new verticals like sports. Create your own market and then just continuing to make the product experience better.
00:16:35.755 - 00:16:45.535, Speaker A: I know there's also been some talk about transaction fees appearing on polymarket. Is there anything that you can say about that?
00:16:46.205 - 00:16:51.109, Speaker B: Yeah, I would. Yeah, I would probably defer to the team to comment on that.
00:16:51.237 - 00:16:51.805, Speaker A: Okay.
00:16:51.925 - 00:16:54.709, Speaker B: On just anything related to transaction fees and revenue.
00:16:54.877 - 00:17:01.745, Speaker A: Okay. Okay. I know that's key to the business model here and obviously the return for investors like yourself, so I have to ask.
00:17:02.525 - 00:17:03.061, Speaker B: That's fair.
00:17:03.093 - 00:17:03.237, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:17:03.261 - 00:17:04.445, Speaker B: And that's a fair question.
00:17:04.605 - 00:17:09.825, Speaker A: Okay. Well, thank you so much for chatting with me. I think we can stop it there.
00:17:10.125 - 00:17:11.645, Speaker B: Okay, awesome. Thanks, Veronica.
