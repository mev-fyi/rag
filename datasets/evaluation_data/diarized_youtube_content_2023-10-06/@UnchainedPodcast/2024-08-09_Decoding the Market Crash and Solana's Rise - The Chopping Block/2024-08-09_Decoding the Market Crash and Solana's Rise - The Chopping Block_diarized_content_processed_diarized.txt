00:00:00.160 - 00:00:11.070, Speaker A: The newer entrants are realizing they need to learn things from Solana, which I think was like, just a. You know, you would be outcast to say that six months ago.
00:00:11.150 - 00:00:32.264, Speaker B: To be clear, I think everything I'm saying is not supposed to be a judge of the quality of, like, Solana products or builders or the chain. Actually, we have some in our portfolio. They're fantastic. You know, nothing but respect. It's more of like a capital markets comment. It's like, would you want to go public in China or do you want to go public in the US? Well, there's a reason why ADR's exist and cdrs don't exist.
00:00:32.432 - 00:00:43.360, Speaker A: Sure. Although I think the problem with the roll up marketing is like, hey, you can join the US, but you have to start your own state. And starting your own state's a lot more work than building a building in Tokyo.
00:00:43.440 - 00:00:44.328, Speaker C: Not a dividend.
00:00:44.424 - 00:00:45.944, Speaker A: It's a tale of Tukwan now.
00:00:46.032 - 00:00:48.280, Speaker D: Your losses are on someone else's balance sheet.
00:00:48.360 - 00:00:50.824, Speaker B: Generally speaking, airdrops are kind of pointless anyways.
00:00:50.992 - 00:00:53.768, Speaker D: Unnamed trading firms who are very involved.
00:00:53.864 - 00:00:54.384, Speaker B: I like that.
00:00:54.432 - 00:00:55.856, Speaker A: ETH is the ultimate policy.
00:00:55.968 - 00:00:58.920, Speaker C: Defi protocols are the antidote to this problem.
00:00:59.820 - 00:01:08.924, Speaker D: Hello, everybody. Welcome to the chopping block. Every couple of weeks, four of us get together and give the industry insider's perspective on the crypto topics of the day. So quick intros. First, we got Tom, the Defi maven and master of memes.
00:01:08.972 - 00:01:09.812, Speaker B: Hello, everyone.
00:01:09.996 - 00:01:16.780, Speaker D: Next we got Robert, the crypto connoisseur and tsar of superstate Aloha. And we've got Tarun, the giga brain and grand poobah at Gauntlet.
00:01:16.860 - 00:01:17.840, Speaker A: Namaste.
00:01:18.140 - 00:01:41.936, Speaker D: Finally, I'm Haseeb, the head hype man of Dragonfly. So we're ost investors in crypto, but I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice, legal advice, or even life advice. Please see chopping block XYZ for more disclosures. So we are together in town for SBC. Used to be called the Stanford Blockchain conference. They rebranded because they moved to New York. So they have to call it the science of blockchain conference, which might be the cringiest rebrand I have seen in a long time.
00:01:41.968 - 00:01:43.240, Speaker C: In my head, it's still Stanford.
00:01:43.320 - 00:01:47.864, Speaker D: I know. I'm embarrassed to tell people I'm at the science of blockchain.
00:01:47.912 - 00:01:56.600, Speaker C: I didn't even know they rebranded it. I actually told a friend, I'm like, oh, I'm going to the Stanford blockchain conference at Columbia. And I was like, yes, that's confusing.
00:01:56.720 - 00:02:07.100, Speaker A: But the other funny thing is, all the workshops just were like, we are science of X. So it's like science of proof, science of Mev. I'm like, oh, my God, that's even more cringe.
00:02:07.440 - 00:02:10.176, Speaker C: Better than the Stanford of XYZ.
00:02:10.368 - 00:02:29.022, Speaker A: Yeah, well, I had some incendiary tweets that I got a lot of flame for, where I made fun of San Francisco in very direct terms and said, the loss of this conference is a very clear sign that crypto will never have a home in.
00:02:29.206 - 00:02:32.974, Speaker D: Why did they give up? Why did they give up the Stanford blushing conference?
00:02:33.022 - 00:02:40.758, Speaker A: I think Cornell Pink is. Cornell and Columbia are pain. I don't think it's just moving here permanently. I think it's just moving between institutions.
00:02:40.894 - 00:02:42.182, Speaker D: Oh, so it's going to rotate back.
00:02:42.206 - 00:02:43.214, Speaker A: It's going to rotate back.
00:02:43.302 - 00:02:43.862, Speaker D: Oh, I see.
00:02:43.926 - 00:03:16.096, Speaker A: I think it's just more. They wanted to. Well, it's also like the researchers, there's not that many researchers left in Stanford. There are some in Berkeley, but I feel like there are way more people in Cornell and Columbia and Princeton now. And whereas, like, pre pandemic, there were way more in Stanford. And a lot of the kind of, especially on the zero knowledge proof side and the advanced cryptography side, a lot of the PhD students started companies, and those companies are all here. No one in their right mind would start a crypto company in San Francisco nowadays.
00:03:16.096 - 00:03:38.298, Speaker A: There are a few really good examples. Like, Solana still has a big officer, succinct, but, like, once you go after that, it drops off really quickly. And I think in the US, you just don't see that many new crypto companies in the Bay Area. Also, there's this thing where you're, like, always competing with AI for talent, and it's like, no one wants to work in crypto there.
00:03:38.474 - 00:03:42.506, Speaker D: It's true. Crypto is kind of cringe in the Bay Area right now. But I do think.
00:03:42.538 - 00:03:43.858, Speaker C: I wouldn't call it cringe.
00:03:43.954 - 00:03:45.322, Speaker A: I think it's kind of cringe in the Bay Area.
00:03:45.386 - 00:03:45.986, Speaker D: In the Bay Area.
00:03:46.058 - 00:03:50.710, Speaker A: Bay Area. Everyone there is like, I don't even tell. I just tell people I work in cyber security.
00:03:52.210 - 00:03:53.250, Speaker C: I guess that's accurate.
00:03:53.290 - 00:03:53.938, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:03:54.114 - 00:03:55.602, Speaker A: All right. That's brutal.
00:03:55.706 - 00:04:29.268, Speaker D: That's brutal. Okay, well, speaking of cringe, we have just had a very big market crash and then kind of pseudo rebound. So for those of you who are paying attention, we had one of the worst days in market action for a couple years, and actually the worst day for the Nikkei in like, 30 years or something since October 1987. So basically, I'll give you the kind of play by play of what happened then. We'll talk through some of the details. So it all starts with the bank of Japan. The bank of Japan last week on Wednesday raised interest rates after 17 years of holding their rates at zero.
00:04:29.268 - 00:04:59.060, Speaker D: They raised their rates by 25 basis points. So from zero to 0.25 basis points. So it's like what you would normally think of as a very, very tiny raise in interest rates. But most people were expecting the bank of Japan to basically keep their interest rates at zero forever. So now, just to set context for those of you who don't necessarily follow the financial alchemy here, all the other central banks have raised their interest rates dramatically over the last couple of years. But bank of Japan was the one odd duck out that kept their interest rates at rock bottom rates.
00:04:59.060 - 00:05:21.020, Speaker D: You can think about that. As everybody else is saying, if you want to borrow money from me, you have to pay me a lot of interest. The bank of Japan is just this big. I like to analogize to defi. Imagine there's one defi protocol that is just offering you, you can borrow from me for free. This is free money. If you just want to do anything with it, whatever the hell you want, here's free money.
00:05:21.020 - 00:06:06.188, Speaker D: The bank of Japan has been doing this for a very long time. People got really levered on what's called the carry trade, which is borrowing from the bank of Japan and then going and investing it into other assets. And when the bank of Japan raised rates, this blew up a bunch of these carry trades and forced people to have to go and unwind those carry trades. Payback the yen, which drove the value of the yen up and caused massive drop in the japanese stock market, as well as a big pump in the price of yen, as well as a massive drop in the S and P. So we had -3% Nasdaq drop, 3.4% on Monday. And the crypto market clocked off at along the same time, the biggest sell off in almost a year, losing about $500 billion in market capitalization in a single day.
00:06:06.188 - 00:06:58.472, Speaker D: So, absolutely seismic event in the crypto market. And many people speculate that what was going on is that this may have been due to somebody who was caught in the yen carry trade, who was forced to liquidate their crypto holdings. And of course, we see, looking on chain that jump or address associated with jump, seem to have been selling off huge amounts, like almost a billion dollars worth of crypto assets that were sold off from addresses associated with jump. So by Tuesday, markets seem to be stabilizing somewhat, and now it seems like there's a little bit of calm, even though the carry trade is not fully unwound, it seems like there's another probably 30, 40% of this carry trade, but hopefully the rest of that unwinds in a more orderly way. But we've sort of bottomed, it seems bitcoin went all the way down to, like, 49k. Now it's back up to 55 ish. But we've seen a lot of blood in the streets and a lot of chaos in markets, and alts are just generally down about 30% of the week.
00:06:58.472 - 00:07:07.040, Speaker D: So just want to real quick get observations. What do you see, what worked well? What went poorly? What were you seeing in terms of reactions to what was happening over the weekend?
00:07:07.340 - 00:07:29.516, Speaker B: I think a lot of people were getting flashbacks to black Thursday Covid crash. Last time we saw that much volatility, or vix, spiked above, like 60 in a single day. And for crypto, it was especially traumatic. But I think sounds like a broken record. But this time around, everything worked pretty well. There were no broken liquidations. The chain got a little bit congested, but for the most part, still function.
00:07:29.516 - 00:07:40.570, Speaker B: Exchanges seem to be working fine. I think obviously, other than the drop in prices, it's not the core plumbing of the market broke in any way, which is good to see.
00:07:40.910 - 00:08:17.536, Speaker A: I think we saw a lot of record volumes on chain. Within Defi, there are at least four protocols that had a billion dollars of volume that had never touched that amount on chain. And I think the fact that Dexdenne market share has just been going up, even for perpetuals lately, is a pretty good sign that people are actually getting a lot more comfortable using on chain and self custody stuff. It's also interesting that the majority of the volume happened on Solana by, like, a long shot. If you compare Solana to everywhere else on the day, it was.
00:08:17.688 - 00:08:39.080, Speaker C: I think that goes to latency issues. I mean, Ethereum had gas prices go up to, like, 700 g way, which was, you know, which is a lot. I mean, like, basic transactions to, like, send ether, let alone, like, interact with a complex protocol. We're getting, like, you know, $10, right? So it's like gas prices went up, where for most users, it becomes completely unusable economically.
00:08:39.200 - 00:08:44.000, Speaker D: Well, wasn't most of the volume on, like, hyper liquid UiDX sort of blew past everybody else in terms of the volumes?
00:08:44.080 - 00:09:37.488, Speaker A: Yeah, they did, but I would say that they're not like their own chains in some ways, are they? Not even sorry, sorry, sorry. They are their own chains, but they're kind of like they live in isolation, right? Yeah, they kind of live, they're almost like centralized exchanges in that sense. They're not like. Whereas in Solana, you saw tons of crazy unwinds of people closing out loans, atomically hedging them. A lot of the kind of liquidity profile for the market, making pools like the JLP style pools, which also you saw with the hyper liquid pools, were actually printing a lot of money for the LP's. It was actually a very solid day for a lot of people in Defi who are not directional traders, who are just liquidity priors, because you just had a full u turn, almost depending on the timing that you enter the market. So I think it was just a very resounding success story.
00:09:37.488 - 00:09:44.620, Speaker A: And it was probably the most crazy on chain activity we've seen that had had no real crazy issues.
00:09:45.970 - 00:10:10.482, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, compared to the last 20% days, it was uneventful. Right. It was eventful from an asset price perspective. It was completely uneventful from what else happened within the ecosystem. Cryptocurrency exchanges were up. Defi worked the entire time. There was very few headlines besides price go down a lot.
00:10:10.666 - 00:10:13.538, Speaker A: Well, there were headlines of tradfi stuff not working.
00:10:13.594 - 00:10:14.098, Speaker D: Yes.
00:10:14.234 - 00:10:15.738, Speaker A: Which is actually worth pointing out.
00:10:15.794 - 00:10:21.698, Speaker C: Brokerages were down, so you couldn't trade a bitcoin or ether ETF, but you could trade real crypto.
00:10:21.794 - 00:10:34.226, Speaker A: Okay, so here's a question. Do you think there are any people who are trading bitcoin or ether ETF's who were like, hey, maybe I want to actually just go buy spot now? Well, do you think there were? I mean, probably not.
00:10:34.258 - 00:10:39.394, Speaker D: I think it's more like we wanted to sell spot because they couldn't panic sell the ETF.
00:10:39.482 - 00:11:12.098, Speaker C: Well, I will admit to some personal activity, which is somewhat interesting. Right when all this was going down, it was like, whatever night this was, Tuesday night, I guess gas prices were like 600, 700 on chain. I wanted to trade a little bit personally. I was like, oh, gas prices are through the roof. I dont really have any assets on Solana. I actually traded a CME ether future as the there is no gas prices here. I can just do it activity right away.
00:11:12.098 - 00:11:24.110, Speaker C: And I was like, oh, I like bought an ether future. And it was the first time I'd ever bought an ether future. But I was like, huh, you know what? Let me actually think about, and try the tradfi products here.
00:11:25.330 - 00:11:26.750, Speaker A: You've come full circle.
00:11:27.810 - 00:11:36.310, Speaker C: I know, I know. I wonder how many of our listeners have ever traded an ether future on the CME, but I actually bought some the extra tradfi way.
00:11:37.340 - 00:12:24.928, Speaker D: Interesting. Yeah, yeah. It does seem like this was very good vindication of crypto rails working well in a time of distress. I think the point that you made about, okay, you've got the hyper liquids and the DyDXs that kind of live on their own chains in some way. This was also a vindication of that choice, which is that, I mean, I wasn't trading on DYDX, but I have to assume that DyDx and hyper liquid fees are probably working in an orderly way. And it's a good point in favor of this kind of chain isolation, that when stuff gets really crazy and everybody wants to trade on Ethereum, it's nice to be like, well, you just bridge in once, then you can do all your trading there, and it's not being beset by all the noisy neighbors of everybody who's trying to liquidate things and get out of things and move assets around and so on. So that is one of the virtue.
00:12:24.928 - 00:12:31.400, Speaker D: People talk a lot of shit about the fragmentation in the EVM or Ethereum ecosystem. And obviously these things.
00:12:31.440 - 00:12:35.144, Speaker A: Well, I think the fragmentation for spot is very different than the fragmentation for derivatives.
00:12:35.192 - 00:13:13.102, Speaker D: Right, naturally, naturally. But that is one of the virtues, is that even if you have a spot market that sits on arbitrum, for example, and arbitrum is insulated from ETH mainnet, that works your benefit when gas prices spike to 700, 800 way. Yeah, it can go both ways. Take a look at where we are now. Price are down quite a lot. One of the things that we've seen, interestingly, is that we had meme coins take a really steep nosedive. I saw just absolute tears in people and just complete capitulation with respect to meme coins and a lot of the darlings of the cycle.
00:13:13.102 - 00:13:48.680, Speaker D: And then as the market starts to turn Monday, Tuesday, and then certainly today, you've seen a lot of that just completely retrace where the meme coins are now bounding up again. They're probably the highest forming assets today, as well as Solana really outperforming a lot of the field. So whenever we see this kind of big correction in markets, very often I feel like markets use that. Oftentimes prices can be kind of sticky. And when prices get unstuck and everybody kind of goes back and says, okay, I need to go and rebuy my positions. And, hey, it turned out it wasn't really, it wasn't idiosyncratic. To crypto.
00:13:48.680 - 00:14:03.714, Speaker D: So there's no reason why I shouldn't own the same amount of this that I did a week ago. But people realize, like, hey, why did I own so much of x and why not more of y? So how do you guys expect this to play out in terms of repricing as people are buying back into the market?
00:14:03.802 - 00:14:27.876, Speaker C: Well, heres my quick take. This event wasnt idiosyncratic to crypto itself. Crypto was impacted by the yen carry trade unwinding. But almost everything else has actually rebounded quicker than bitcoin. Bitcoin is still at 54, 55k. Right. Let's sold off tremendously.
00:14:27.876 - 00:14:34.868, Speaker C: Ether is still at 23 50 zone. Sold off tremendously. The Nikkei. It's back.
00:14:34.964 - 00:14:38.324, Speaker A: I think it's up. It's up weekly. It's up. Technically.
00:14:38.412 - 00:14:47.842, Speaker C: Yeah. It's up technically. I mean, last Friday was a huge sell off in the Nikkei, but it's for the most part back to pre cali trade unwinding.
00:14:47.996 - 00:14:50.118, Speaker D: Is that right? Is that in yen terms or in dollar terms?
00:14:50.214 - 00:14:51.654, Speaker C: Yeah, great question. I think yen.
00:14:51.702 - 00:14:51.878, Speaker D: Okay.
00:14:51.894 - 00:14:53.694, Speaker B: I think the bog also backed off the rate.
00:14:53.742 - 00:14:55.750, Speaker A: Yeah. They basically said they're not.
00:14:55.790 - 00:15:25.036, Speaker C: Right. So if all of this came from and originated from the yen carry trade unwinding or partially unwinding, because really it's been building up over 35 years, I believe. 38 years or so, all the asset prices in Japan that would have been the most close to the nucleus of this have returned pretty much to where they were. But crypto is still down tremendously, and equity markets have. We'll call it halfway in. The US rebounded. Right.
00:15:25.068 - 00:15:25.548, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:15:25.684 - 00:15:37.120, Speaker C: And so while the event wasn't, you know, idiosyncratic to crypto, in some ways, the impact of it has been. And that crypto is still lagging behind everything else as a response to this event.
00:15:37.500 - 00:15:40.014, Speaker D: Right. And why do you think that is?
00:15:40.212 - 00:15:47.114, Speaker C: It's a great question. I don't know if I could answer this, you know, I'd find other ways to make a lot of money, but I can't explain crypto.
00:15:47.202 - 00:15:52.546, Speaker B: I was talking last night at dinner. There's this paper that came out. It was like, Austin Adams and I think two other authors.
00:15:52.618 - 00:15:53.258, Speaker A: The one that got.
00:15:53.314 - 00:15:54.034, Speaker B: You didn't like it.
00:15:54.082 - 00:15:55.642, Speaker A: The one that got made fun of a lot.
00:15:55.706 - 00:15:56.410, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:15:56.450 - 00:16:01.314, Speaker A: Well, I thought by your colleague. Your colleague had a tweet that went viral, I think, making fun of it.
00:16:01.362 - 00:16:02.210, Speaker B: Wait, which tweet?
00:16:02.290 - 00:16:10.674, Speaker A: Sanat's tweet of crossing out the paper. And it was like the transition jump. That was like a funny tweet.
00:16:10.722 - 00:16:23.918, Speaker B: People were blaming initially, you know, a lot of the price action started on Sunday. People were like, oh, jump is dumping. And they've been doing it for a few days. But I'm like, grand scheme of things, it's like not that much volume or not that much relative to the overall volume of the crypto.
00:16:23.934 - 00:16:26.142, Speaker C: It's not 10 trillion of yen carry trades on.
00:16:26.206 - 00:16:49.562, Speaker B: Yes, but the paper busy makes the claim that, hey, it's like roughly 50% sort of idiosyncratic demand for crypto assets and then like 25% macro, 25% sort of risk asset appetite, which maybe the answer is, hey, we sort of saw those last two factors in play over the past few days. But the crypto demand is still sort of this open question, which is maybe why you haven't seen the rebound.
00:16:49.666 - 00:16:59.710, Speaker D: I think that's generally right. That if you look at the way in which the us stock market has recovered, it hasn't recovered uniformly in the way that it was before the crash. In that. Well, crash is strong word correction.
00:17:00.130 - 00:17:03.642, Speaker C: I think it was a crash. If something goes down 20% in a.
00:17:03.706 - 00:17:05.058, Speaker D: The stock market didn't go down 20%.
00:17:05.114 - 00:17:06.242, Speaker C: No, crypto crashed.
00:17:06.266 - 00:17:13.895, Speaker D: Crypto did. Crypto did. Yeah, I. But in the stock market, what you see is that there's been largely rotation outside of the hot AI names and a lot of the big tech companies.
00:17:13.927 - 00:17:18.543, Speaker A: I mean, actually, magnificent seven looks like crypto, it hasn't rebounded. Sorry. That was.
00:17:18.591 - 00:17:35.048, Speaker D: Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Yeah. So the stock market on the whole has rebounded. But actually, if you look at it like the Nasdaq has done mediocre and the Dow Jones has done really well, basically tells you, oh, industrials are doing really well and the tech stuff is like kind of being rotated out of. So now that being said, that's been.
00:17:35.064 - 00:17:38.808, Speaker A: Going on for a few weeks, though, like the russell has been like mooning comparatively.
00:17:38.904 - 00:17:45.872, Speaker D: Right. So I think what you should. All eyes, I think right now are on the Fed to see what is the Fed going to do. There's a.
00:17:45.976 - 00:17:47.080, Speaker C: They're going to cut interest rates.
00:17:47.120 - 00:17:52.992, Speaker D: Well, they're going to cut interest rates almost certainly. Right. The market is pricing in more than 100% chance of a rate cut. I don't know quite how that works.
00:17:53.016 - 00:17:56.040, Speaker C: But it's because rate cuts when it comes to, like, fed fund futures.
00:17:56.080 - 00:17:56.352, Speaker D: Right, right.
00:17:56.376 - 00:18:02.544, Speaker C: Which is how people, like, interpolate a probability. It's based on the expectations of a 25% cut.
00:18:02.632 - 00:18:03.120, Speaker D: Right.
00:18:03.240 - 00:18:10.966, Speaker C: So when people are like, oh, it's 150% probability of a cut. That means the market is pricing in the expectation that there's one and a.
00:18:10.968 - 00:18:12.216, Speaker D: Half 37 rate cut.
00:18:12.248 - 00:18:24.464, Speaker C: Yeah, but the probability is never actually over 100%. And the, the Wall street firms have their own models to actually figure out the implied probabilities. But it's one of the paradoxes that happens very quickly when there's more than one rate cut expected.
00:18:24.592 - 00:18:55.490, Speaker D: Right. So there was talk a few days ago about potentially having an emergency rate cut. Now that talk has been nullified. I dont think thats on the table. But very likely in September, markets are betting very, very likely theres going to be a 50 bp break cut as opposed to just the previous expected 25 bit rate cut. If that happens, I think thats going to juice a lot of the demand for risk assets once again. But the market is still, whats the word is the cat dead or alive right now with respect to how risky, its a bit of a Schrodinger's market right now.
00:18:55.490 - 00:18:57.658, Speaker D: Exactly. So we'll see how that plays out.
00:18:57.714 - 00:19:12.562, Speaker A: Well, it is funny the timing of that cut around the election. Right. I feel like that to me is the more interesting thing of like there's some politics behind whether they, I feel like if it's too aggressive, it will like look like they're helping one side versus the other.
00:19:12.626 - 00:19:13.298, Speaker D: I think at this point at least.
00:19:13.314 - 00:19:15.194, Speaker A: That'S, I feel like people love going.
00:19:15.202 - 00:19:15.978, Speaker D: To look like that.
00:19:16.074 - 00:19:28.966, Speaker C: Yeah. The counterpoint is, I don't know what percent of Americans are following the magnitude of Fed cuts. I think they're following the prices like at the pump and like in the grocery stores, which are not going to respond at all in any short.
00:19:29.038 - 00:19:30.158, Speaker D: They're also following the stock market.
00:19:30.214 - 00:19:49.590, Speaker B: They're looking at their 401 ks. Yeah, but I mean, also the Fed is one of the last big central banks to have not cut yet. And so I think you can say that it's political, but it's also somewhat maybe just coincidental timing that, hey, we're seeing inflation measures go down.
00:19:49.710 - 00:19:58.090, Speaker A: I feel like Powell would have made it easier or the Fed in general would have made it easier on themselves if they spread the cuts. So then they would not be like.
00:19:58.130 - 00:20:18.242, Speaker C: Accused of always, but they always overshoot. Like the Fed, no matter who the chair is, has this incredible ability in almost every economic cycle to wait too long and to overshoot things. It's amazing because like to the outside world, you're like, God, the Fed so bad at their job. Like they always wait, but I wait.
00:20:18.386 - 00:20:52.520, Speaker A: It's kind of hard. I feel like, I know that important of a seat, but I think a very funny thing. I was, like, listening to some interview with this person who studies a lot of the Fed meeting notes. Linguistics and what words are said the most. And apparently Powell's favorite phrase, which is always, by far the highest frequency, is leading and lagging indicators. It's very clear they're thinking about the fact that they're always lagging, but they're kind of like, yeah, too afraid to kind of jump into it.
00:20:52.600 - 00:21:05.416, Speaker C: Ideally, the Fed would have gotten us to, like, 4% interest rates, like, four months ago, and, like, that would feel like an actual natural equilibrium. It's just that, like, they've undershot the mark.
00:21:05.608 - 00:21:09.248, Speaker D: I feel like this is also just. Committees in general tend to have this behavior.
00:21:09.304 - 00:21:10.384, Speaker C: I mean, or dows.
00:21:10.472 - 00:21:17.970, Speaker D: Yeah, exactly. I was going to say, like, what do you think about dow rate governance? Is it that different? Do you feel like rate governance is ahead of the curve ever?
00:21:18.080 - 00:21:21.670, Speaker C: No, it's always behind the curve. They're always reactive.
00:21:21.790 - 00:21:39.158, Speaker D: Exactly, exactly. So I don't think that's unique among any institution that's governed by a bunch of people putting their hands on a big Ouija board and moving around. Well, we have to move together, and the only time you're gonna agree is when the last person's mind changes. And then it's like, okay, now we have consensus to actually go change the rate.
00:21:39.254 - 00:21:43.902, Speaker C: I've never actually used a Ouija board, so the analogy is a little bit lost on me.
00:21:43.926 - 00:21:47.678, Speaker D: But I. I have never actually used it either. But I remember those commercials very strongly.
00:21:47.734 - 00:21:49.010, Speaker C: Have you used a Ouija board?
00:21:49.520 - 00:21:50.320, Speaker B: Ouija board.
00:21:50.440 - 00:21:52.872, Speaker A: I remember, yeah, the commercials, but I never really.
00:21:52.976 - 00:22:21.464, Speaker D: For those who don't know what a Ouija board is. So Ouija board was a game in the nineties. Game is a strong word, baby. It's a fortune telling device. Yeah, it's a fortune telling device where basically you'd have, like, a sheet of paper with a bunch of letters on it, and everybody would put their hands on, like, a magnifying glass. And through the power of magic, of spooky something, it would write something out through people's collective holding this thing. And so now it's kind of an analogy for, you know, group action group.
00:22:21.512 - 00:22:29.864, Speaker B: I used to have a Ouija board mouse pad, which felt a little bit more appropriate. As you're moving the mouse, it's letting the spirits guide you. Yeah, yeah.
00:22:29.912 - 00:22:30.688, Speaker D: Okay. All right.
00:22:30.704 - 00:22:34.472, Speaker C: Well, but everyone had to pretend that the spirit was moving them. Right. That was the whole.
00:22:34.536 - 00:22:39.384, Speaker D: I think that's the idea, well, everyone is sort of suspects that it's happening, but then, like, you know, you sort of pretend.
00:22:39.552 - 00:22:47.842, Speaker A: I never really understood what I assumed that the thing that they're holding had some randomness in it. Like, it, like, jitter, mechanical.
00:22:47.946 - 00:22:51.866, Speaker D: How much jitter can you put to move, like, five kids hands together?
00:22:51.978 - 00:22:55.346, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't think that's. I never really understood the ads. I just looked at them.
00:22:55.378 - 00:23:00.922, Speaker C: So next episode on the chopping block, we're gonna have a Ouija board, and we're gonna make token symbols.
00:23:00.986 - 00:23:06.274, Speaker D: That's right. That's right. Collectively, because Marin. What's her name? Crypto Marin. She's out of the game now.
00:23:06.402 - 00:23:08.402, Speaker A: She has. I haven't heard that name in forever.
00:23:08.466 - 00:23:14.400, Speaker D: Yeah, she stopped doing a prediction. So we gotta step in. It's like a niche that we need to get into.
00:23:15.860 - 00:23:25.480, Speaker A: I feel like an AI astrologer is probably good enough. Right? Just, like, fine tune a model. Fine tune a model on some prices, price, news articles.
00:23:25.780 - 00:23:26.404, Speaker C: Moving on.
00:23:26.452 - 00:23:37.666, Speaker D: Yeah. Okay. Moving on. Moving on. All right, so we've been speaking some about the intersection of politics and the Fed. There's a lot now at the intersection of politics and crypto. So first is.
00:23:37.666 - 00:24:28.318, Speaker D: So, of course, Kamala Harris, presumptive or now the democratic nominee, she has picked a running mate, but we still haven't gotten a lot of clarity around Kamala's policies of how she's going to be treating crypto. Now, we started to get the very first indications that we talked about a little bit on the last show that she has reached out to some of the crypto folks that I think Rokhana has been intermediating and putting together these groups with some of the crypto lobbyists and industry leaders. So that's supposed to be happening later this week. So I don't think we've heard back yet on how that second round of talks is going, but we can see that she's engaging. And we've also seen from the other side that a group of, so one, we have David Plouffe, who's a former Obama advisor, was also on finance, that guy's global advisory board. So he's very much in the crypto mix. He is joining the Harris's campaign as a senior advisor.
00:24:28.318 - 00:24:38.230, Speaker D: And then we have a new group called Crypto for Harris, which includes Sheila Warren, Amanda Wicked, as well as Mark Cuban. Scaramucci. Scaramucci.
00:24:38.270 - 00:24:40.686, Speaker A: Wow, wow, wow. That's a big. That's a big U turn.
00:24:40.798 - 00:24:44.150, Speaker D: Do you not hear his trump?
00:24:44.230 - 00:24:45.710, Speaker C: Yeah, he's very pro.
00:24:45.870 - 00:24:50.078, Speaker A: I should ask him about this. I got stuck on a bus sitting next to him for a few hours.
00:24:50.174 - 00:24:53.886, Speaker C: No, he's an outspoken Democrat who's also extremely outspoken pro crypto.
00:24:53.918 - 00:24:54.478, Speaker A: I didn't realize.
00:24:54.534 - 00:24:56.246, Speaker D: Well, he's a now Democrat.
00:24:56.278 - 00:24:56.662, Speaker A: Right.
00:24:56.766 - 00:24:57.382, Speaker D: Anti trumper.
00:24:57.406 - 00:25:02.596, Speaker A: He's an anti. Okay. I just thought he was, like, independent after kind of leaving the administration.
00:25:02.748 - 00:25:05.300, Speaker D: You can't really be independent in this kind of environment.
00:25:05.460 - 00:25:17.924, Speaker A: Yeah. Also, one very funny fact that I was, like, listening to some news about was Tim Walz, who's the vice presidential nominee. He did his financial disclosure and owns, like, the least amount.
00:25:17.972 - 00:25:18.836, Speaker C: No stock as a teacher.
00:25:18.868 - 00:25:21.836, Speaker A: Like, no stocks, no bonds, nothing. Like only this. 400.
00:25:21.868 - 00:25:22.788, Speaker C: No funding or something.
00:25:22.844 - 00:25:23.372, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:25:23.516 - 00:25:24.980, Speaker D: Wow. Okay.
00:25:25.060 - 00:25:27.600, Speaker A: So I feel like he's going to have literally zero.
00:25:28.580 - 00:25:33.080, Speaker D: Yeah. That doesn't bode amazingly because all the reporting says he's, like, very folksy, right.
00:25:33.120 - 00:25:34.216, Speaker A: Down to earth school teacher.
00:25:34.288 - 00:25:35.696, Speaker D: The school teacher. Yeah. Okay.
00:25:35.768 - 00:25:36.712, Speaker C: Or was a school.
00:25:36.816 - 00:25:37.304, Speaker B: Sorry, sir.
00:25:37.352 - 00:25:37.560, Speaker D: Right.
00:25:37.600 - 00:25:38.544, Speaker C: He's a politician.
00:25:38.632 - 00:25:43.352, Speaker D: Very, very, very blue collar. He's kind of like the Biden to Kamala.
00:25:43.456 - 00:25:49.640, Speaker A: I was sort of surprised, to be honest. They didn't go with the Pennsylvania governor because, like, I feel like Pennsylvania moves the needle.
00:25:49.680 - 00:26:03.844, Speaker D: Oh, let's not turn this into, like, politics quarterback show. Cause I think we're gonna lose our audience. They already get mad at how much we talk about politics. We are, just to be clear, if everybody's watching, we are going to continue talking about politics, but we will try to moderate the amount of non crypto.
00:26:03.972 - 00:26:06.388, Speaker C: Politics that we're going to keep it focused on crypto.
00:26:06.444 - 00:26:11.812, Speaker D: Yeah, we're going to try to keep it focused on crypto. But to be clear, this is going to be the political year for crypto.
00:26:11.956 - 00:26:18.680, Speaker C: And later this year, we're actually thinking about having a crypto special for election.
00:26:19.380 - 00:26:38.766, Speaker D: That's cooking. We got something cooking for. It's going to be explosive. So I'm excited for it. Okay, so then what about on the republican side? Trump just this morning sent out a tweet that surprised everybody. He said, we are about to shake up the crypto world with something huge. Decentralized finance is the future.
00:26:38.766 - 00:26:40.294, Speaker D: Don't get left behind.
00:26:40.382 - 00:26:44.918, Speaker B: Donald Trump junior junior. Donald Trump junior young Trump's and Eric Trump.
00:26:45.054 - 00:26:48.454, Speaker A: Also, they had some hashtag with Defi in it.
00:26:48.502 - 00:26:51.870, Speaker D: Be defiant, be defiant, be defiant, be defiant. Yeah, yeah.
00:26:51.950 - 00:26:55.038, Speaker B: Also, who's using hashtags? It was fucking 2024.
00:26:55.134 - 00:26:57.886, Speaker C: When you have, like, an agency writing your tweet, that's.
00:26:57.918 - 00:26:58.750, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:26:58.830 - 00:26:59.870, Speaker C: Throw hashtags in there.
00:26:59.910 - 00:27:00.638, Speaker D: That's true.
00:27:00.774 - 00:27:02.822, Speaker A: What agency do you think wrote that tweet?
00:27:02.926 - 00:27:10.254, Speaker C: I bet they hired some bad firm that's doing this crypto partnership and setting it all up and writing tweets.
00:27:10.342 - 00:27:16.250, Speaker A: But I actually think hashtags are an interesting thing in that they're clearly going for an older demographic.
00:27:16.590 - 00:27:21.710, Speaker C: If you're using clicked, the be defiant hashtag yet, just see if anyone else.
00:27:22.010 - 00:27:24.346, Speaker D: There's no way. There's absolutely no way.
00:27:24.458 - 00:27:26.354, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm gonna start using it on every tweet.
00:27:26.402 - 00:27:53.388, Speaker D: Yeah, we can try to make it a thing. Hashtag. Hashtag be defiant. That's very sweet. So anyway, we've got now increasing sense that whatever administration is coming in, there's gonna be some moderation on crypto policy, and it's probably gonna be that good. But there's still the civil war going on right now within crypto about. On the one side, you've got the Ryan selkuses of the world who basically say, look, the Democrats betrayed us.
00:27:53.388 - 00:28:28.628, Speaker D: We have to go republican or die all the way and embrace the side that is giving you a path to life. And then you've got the moderates, people who say, well, why not play both sides and allow everybody to appeal to us and be good? In either case, it's a probability game, and you want to play the probabilities, and then you've got the people who say, look, Trump existential threat, crypto is not the only thing that matters. And for other social policy reasons, you should only go with Democrats. So it does seem like relative to any other election I've seen, this has been the most that I've seen crypto get political.
00:28:28.764 - 00:28:33.964, Speaker A: Well, the Elizabeth Warren prediction market letter this week. Yeah, that was also.
00:28:34.092 - 00:28:37.236, Speaker C: We can talk about that on the show. Yeah, that's a good topic.
00:28:37.308 - 00:28:45.592, Speaker D: Yeah. Yeah. But what's your guys sense of, like, this internal civil war thing that seems like it's starting to materialize within crypto?
00:28:45.736 - 00:29:12.250, Speaker C: Well, I think, and I'm going to be broadly generalizing here, and I'm not an insider and I don't actually know, and it's all speculation. Here's my personal take on the situation. The Harris campaign knows that politics is an issue, but doesn't know what their stance should be at. They know that a very large audience is screaming about it and that it's not black and white.
00:29:12.790 - 00:29:16.206, Speaker A: Well, a very large audience that also funded the largest super PAC.
00:29:16.278 - 00:29:50.840, Speaker C: That also funded the largest super PAC and continues to take down anti crypto candidates in the House and Senate. Right. Like, just last night, Corey Bush, who's anti crypto lost her primary. One of the major reasons being she's anti crypto and the crypto audience came out strongly in support of her opponent. And so clearly the pro crypto money and voters are aligning very quickly. And so it has to be an issue. But I don't think there's any indications on what their policy platform will be yet.
00:29:50.840 - 00:30:00.960, Speaker C: It's very clear what Trump says. It's we need to embrace bitcoin and defi now. And Defi now.
00:30:01.260 - 00:30:01.988, Speaker D: Be defiant.
00:30:02.044 - 00:30:15.604, Speaker C: Be defiant. Hashtag B. Define. But these are things that are historically antagonistic to the left wing. Right. Bitcoin energy usage has been a constant topic of conversation. A lot of people have come out.
00:30:15.772 - 00:30:22.356, Speaker A: Luckily, AI's energy usage has been 25 times higher than crypto usage. And now it's pivoted, of course.
00:30:22.428 - 00:31:07.784, Speaker C: But there's a lot of old tropes about crypto forged years ago before anyone was really paying that much attention about, oh, crypto is bad for the environment. Right? Like uninformed takes, but crypto is bad for the environment. So we have to be against and all these things. It's going to be hard to reconcile what they've heard previously with what they want to be able to say now because large swaths of the Democratic Party have been anti crypto for the wrong reasons. And so to reconcile where they've been to where they want to go is complex and it's not easy. And I don't know what their positions are going to be, but they're not going to parrot Trump and take the same views. I think they'll probably come out with some views that are, like, we're pro innovation and, like, pro new technologies and, like, leave it at that.
00:31:07.952 - 00:31:20.976, Speaker D: I think this America China thing is also going to play very well in this cycle as being a reason why, hey, we have to keep crypto in America. We can't lose the fight to China. That plays well on the republican side and on the democrat side, increasingly.
00:31:21.048 - 00:31:21.304, Speaker C: Right.
00:31:21.352 - 00:32:07.214, Speaker D: So this is like the bipartisan issue. And I think there was a letter that was sent from a bunch of rising Democrats in the party to, I think it was Takamala basically saying, like, hey, let's make this part of the democratic platform to be pro crypto. And I think a lot of these folks who, I think people realize these are going to be the rising stars and the folks in 1015 years who are going to take up more and more of the space in the Democratic Party, they realize that for their constituents, crypto is important because they're young and it's like, okay, democrats, you want to keep winning, you have to have some appeal to young people. And for them, it's just much more salient of an issue than for folks who are in places where the average age is just going to be much higher for their constituents.
00:32:07.342 - 00:32:21.292, Speaker B: I get that there's some delicateness to threading this needle of transitioning from where they were in the past to maybe where they want to be. But this seems like the mathematic still does not make sense to be anti crypto, right? On the one hand, you have no.
00:32:21.356 - 00:32:22.720, Speaker C: The math is horrible.
00:32:23.380 - 00:32:54.870, Speaker B: It seems like it should be so obvious. It doesn't have to be all the way towards, let's have strategic bitcoin reserving. Maybe that's even going too far. But it's like, if you're pro deficit spending, if you're pro sort of wealth, pro youth, you would think that inherently you should want to therefore have this pro crypto platform in addition to all the other benefits that we've seen and all the influence that we've seen in this election. So it's weird to me that, I don't know, it still feels like kind of this arduous, drawn out process for something that should be very simple math.
00:32:55.030 - 00:33:36.006, Speaker D: I think there's a little bit of preference falsification that when we saw the fit 21 vote, people sort of realized, like, look, I don't really feel strongly about this, but it seems like there's a partisan issue, and I got a signal allegiance to it, sort of became right left coded crypto in the US. And so you're like, okay, now that it's coded, I kind of got to do my thing. But once people are like, okay, well, now my constituents are watching because it's election year, so people actually care what I do. And this is well founded. Research shows that politicians tend to vote more in line with their electorate in election years. And outside election years, they tend to vote more, quote unquote, politically, meaning, like, forging alliances and doing quid pro quos and this kind of thing. Because people just pay more attention in election year because, oh, you're up for review.
00:33:36.006 - 00:33:55.282, Speaker D: Let me go see what you've been doing for me lately. And so on some level, it's not surprising that you see behavior shift. But I think also there's a little bit of, I think, some degree of preference falsification, but also just another degree of, like, these things were always not that strong. Right? Like, a lot of people were just like, look, I don't know that much about crypto and, like, well, it's also very regional.
00:33:55.386 - 00:34:17.610, Speaker A: Like, I think that's another part of it for the Democrat. Like, I think for Republicans, it's almost kind of uniformly across the country. They have, like, very similar views on crypto. They don't like because they're kind of more flat. Whereas with the Democrats, you have certain particular regions that seem to have much more anti crypto. Massachusetts, excuse me, being one of them.
00:34:18.110 - 00:34:20.870, Speaker C: That's just because it's Elizabeth Warren's.
00:34:21.030 - 00:34:33.894, Speaker A: But I actually think I remember that map of the Coinbase survey of people in crypto. And there were definitely the states that had the highest variance were definitely certain blue states, like the Northeast.
00:34:33.942 - 00:34:46.430, Speaker D: Mazda is famously very conservative, kind of, you know, it's like everything closes at like eleven or something. And just like, there's like, liquor laws are very restrictive. It's like, you know, it's got this kind of association.
00:34:46.730 - 00:35:01.962, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, there's definitely. I definitely. So, so, like, I think that the Republicans just don't really care about that at all. Even the new school or old school Republicans are just like, whatever. Money is money. But I definitely get that feeling. The Democrats are very much not like.
00:35:01.962 - 00:35:09.330, Speaker A: And it's regional. So, like, I think there's, in California, the California Democrats probably will instantly jump as we're seeing.
00:35:09.450 - 00:35:12.154, Speaker C: Kamala is technically a California Democrat.
00:35:12.322 - 00:35:14.190, Speaker A: True, true.
00:35:14.810 - 00:35:31.250, Speaker D: Yeah. And that is really the curveball in all this, is that she. I mean, she might not be herself technical, but she understands the politics of technology very well. She's very connected with a lot of the folks who are plugged into that space. As much as you might want to abandon them, they are right now our connective tissue to.
00:35:31.330 - 00:35:39.216, Speaker A: Well, the other thing I find funny about the current kind of environment, it's like the AI lobby seems to be so much less effective than the crypto lobby.
00:35:39.288 - 00:35:42.088, Speaker D: They're brand new. We were like, we were not very effective four years ago.
00:35:42.264 - 00:35:55.384, Speaker A: No, it's true. But they're not really brand new because, like, they really are extensions of, like, the big tech companies. And, like. And especially because of all the crazy laws you're seeing. It's kind of interesting to look at the compare and contrast of the two.
00:35:55.472 - 00:36:12.392, Speaker B: Yeah. I think even in what, Europe, there was some, like, AI bill pass. Now, like the author of it was like, oh, yeah, actually, maybe that was bad. Like, maybe. Maybe that was, you know, it was like the California airbag where it's like, oh, above us. Like models that are computed with above a certain number of gigaflops, it's like, what the fuck kind of regulation is that?
00:36:12.416 - 00:36:14.544, Speaker C: Like, that's so expanding math.
00:36:14.632 - 00:36:17.280, Speaker B: Yeah, but, yeah, it's like, oh, you can't use this much compute to like.
00:36:17.320 - 00:36:20.064, Speaker A: Well, no, they also were like, you can't use floating point.
00:36:20.152 - 00:36:20.984, Speaker B: Yes. Yeah, yeah.
00:36:21.072 - 00:36:25.016, Speaker A: So it's like, oh, well, but I could do fix everything in fixed point. All right, who cares? I can get it right.
00:36:25.048 - 00:36:25.648, Speaker C: Fixed point.
00:36:25.744 - 00:36:34.474, Speaker A: It was like so stupid. Like, the regulation was clearly written by people who had never actually compiled a model.
00:36:34.522 - 00:36:39.470, Speaker C: Well, it's written by staffers with varying degrees of knowledge. Right.
00:36:40.090 - 00:36:41.658, Speaker D: Some of all law, I mean, which.
00:36:41.674 - 00:36:53.234, Speaker C: Is true of all law in like every country in every jurisdiction, right. It's like, yeah, whoever wrote it probably doesn't know the nuances of like computation and like floating point. You know, math.
00:36:53.282 - 00:36:55.922, Speaker A: But they chose a very random set of thresholds.
00:36:55.986 - 00:36:57.018, Speaker C: I know it's arbitrary.
00:36:57.074 - 00:36:58.394, Speaker A: Yeah. Which was like, why?
00:36:58.442 - 00:37:06.162, Speaker C: They probably asked an expert for advice and they said, oh, you know, here's some levers you could pull hypothetically. And they just picked a few and were like, that's the bill.
00:37:06.226 - 00:37:24.762, Speaker D: Right, right. But I mean, the law is full of thresholds, right? There's like above this amount of money, you have to register with the SEC. Above this amount of this, you have to do that. So the point of it, obviously, is that they want startups to be beneath it and big companies be above it. Did they pick the right threshold? Obviously, many people don't think so, but regardless, AI lobbyists. And it's the right threshold.
00:37:24.786 - 00:37:31.426, Speaker C: Not to pound on this dead horse, but it's the right threshold. Maybe for now, but it won't be in two years. The technology advance is so exponential.
00:37:31.458 - 00:37:38.694, Speaker D: And unlike with smart contracts, we don't have auto increment incrementing laws. So we can't just put like a pid in there or something and get it.
00:37:38.742 - 00:37:52.750, Speaker C: Yeah, and every time you try to pass a law with this like auto incrementing thing, like, you always get the number wrong. So even if you're like, oh, with 2% increases per year, it's fine if inflation is 2% or whatever, but like when it changes high or low, you're all sudden off base.
00:37:52.830 - 00:38:10.048, Speaker D: Yeah, it is surprising how infrequently even like relatively basic solutions. Okay, so we'll just like, pegs is a CPI, they just don't do that. They will be like, oh, yeah, 2% a year, it goes up by 2% a year. Or like, oh, every year it goes up, but you have to re appropriate. And then there's another fight, and then.
00:38:10.064 - 00:38:14.416, Speaker A: There'S a whole lot of people fight over the CPI calculation, though. So I feel like that's the real reason.
00:38:14.448 - 00:38:29.150, Speaker D: It's just like you'll fight no matter what the fight is. But like, is that really not better than just, okay, well, minimum wage is x and we have to like fight every single year to change it. Like that seems like obviously the worst solution of all is just make it a constant.
00:38:29.530 - 00:38:31.790, Speaker C: Yeah, I don't know.
00:38:32.410 - 00:38:42.050, Speaker A: I could see the CPI, the CPI calculation is something people fight about. And you could imagine that the fight over how, what the weights are for every year is exactly the same as the fight, right?
00:38:42.090 - 00:39:17.600, Speaker D: Granted, granted, yes. But my point is that like, you know, let, don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good, you know, but that just happens all too often in politics. So anyway, all right, switching subjects a little bit. So the other big story going on has been, of course, the rise of polymarket, the prediction market into which, full disclosure, we are all investors. Polymarket has just surpassed a billion dollars in total trading volume as of July 30. More than one third of the volume was brought about by bets made in July alone. So it has just been a meteoric rise in the total amount of betting taking place on polymarket.
00:39:17.600 - 00:39:22.446, Speaker D: And at the same time, as you were mentioning, I love the idea of.
00:39:22.478 - 00:39:24.134, Speaker A: Olaf as a bookie, though.
00:39:24.302 - 00:40:10.024, Speaker D: Polychain trading on liquidity on there, they did lead the seed round, so I wouldn't surprise me. So anyway, Elizabeth Warren sent a letter to CFTC chair Roston Benham calling for the banning of political event betting contracts, which of course would encompass prediction markets. The quote from this letter to the CFTC saying, hey, these things should be banned. Actually, I should be clear. They're already banned. Basically, they're already banned, but they want to be extra banned. So there was basically a kind of redoubling of, hey, these little no action letters you've given out and these little carve outs for like, oh, predicted and this and that, let's slap all of them down, take away all of their little sort of sandboxes in which we've allowed them to proliferate.
00:40:10.024 - 00:40:26.602, Speaker D: And the line here from the letter is allowing billionaires to wager extraordinary bets while simultaneously contributing to a specific candidate or party and political insiders to bet on elections. Using non public information will further degrade public trust in the electoral process. Thoughts?
00:40:26.706 - 00:40:28.746, Speaker C: I don't know any billionaires who are.
00:40:28.898 - 00:40:50.266, Speaker A: Yeah, you have to be so far out in the risk spectrum that I don't think you're. This idea is her usual bluster. I mean, I actually was wondering, I wanted to go see, I meant to do this, but I wanted to look at what her reelection probabilities on polymarket right now, because, like, maybe she doesn't like seeing her number.
00:40:50.338 - 00:40:51.162, Speaker C: I'm gonna look it up.
00:40:51.266 - 00:40:54.590, Speaker D: Okay. Yeah, look it up. Look it up. I'm gonna look at Warren's odds on Polymorph.
00:40:54.930 - 00:41:01.870, Speaker A: Because I bet you if it's like really low, because, you know, the Djen's like purposely making it low. She hates looking at it.
00:41:02.370 - 00:41:06.290, Speaker D: I don't, I mean, that's not, that's not gonna work. But on the Djen side.
00:41:06.370 - 00:41:10.110, Speaker A: I know, I know. But I wonder if that's enough to get her to write the letter.
00:41:10.550 - 00:41:26.590, Speaker D: I think there is. I mean, well, to be clear, I think, like, this is all very reflexive and like, I, we were writing something about prediction markets for our LP newsletter for, you know, the end of the quarter, and I was reading about a lot of the history of prediction markets and 97% odds.
00:41:26.630 - 00:41:28.014, Speaker A: 97, 97.
00:41:28.182 - 00:41:29.126, Speaker C: 97%.
00:41:29.198 - 00:41:31.610, Speaker D: She has nothing to love the prediction. Yeah, yeah.
00:41:32.630 - 00:41:34.806, Speaker C: She should be tweeting out like, the polymarket.
00:41:34.838 - 00:41:38.290, Speaker D: Yeah. Just like Trump. Just like, look at this. I'm crushing my.
00:41:38.330 - 00:41:39.642, Speaker C: Yeah, 97. I'm going to win.
00:41:39.706 - 00:42:19.570, Speaker D: Yeah. Yeah. No, it's interesting because, like, this idea that prediction markets are corrosive to democracy was not always believed. Right? So if you look at the history of prediction markets, people have been betting on elections in the US basically since like the early 18 hundreds. And if you look at the late 18 hundreds and early 19 hundreds, betting markets were actually crescendoing. I think it culminated in the election of 1916, in which over $130 million in modern day dollars was bet on that election. And around that time, in the early early 20th century, the New York Times would print the prevailing odds in the paper every single day.
00:42:19.570 - 00:43:03.772, Speaker D: There was a great quote that I read from the study that was showing one showing that the prediction markets were actually, this is before the rise of scientific polling. The prediction markets were actually massively out predicting the primitive polls that they had at that time that they were using. So they were much more effective than any other method of actually predicting the odds. And there was a great piece in the New York Times in, I think it was 1920, where basically the New York Times was explaining to their audience that Wall street is known for being unemotional and being able to bet on the correct odds of something happening. And the reason why you should expect the odds to always be correct is that if somebody were trying to push the odds in one direction, the cold, calculating Wall street people would push it back into the normal line. Just like soccer.
00:43:03.796 - 00:43:03.908, Speaker A: Right?
00:43:03.924 - 00:43:24.108, Speaker D: Which is obviously correct. Right? But this idea that, well, no, no, no. If you allow there to be betting markets on elections, that's going to corrupt the process. And it cause, like, people to throw elections and do all this other crazy nonsense. That idea started in roughly the thirties with prohibition and just a general kind of moral environment of, oh, you know, sinful.
00:43:24.164 - 00:43:28.932, Speaker A: Well, the crash, the crash in 1929 in between probably influenced that.
00:43:29.036 - 00:43:36.580, Speaker D: Maybe it's something to do with it, but, like, there's actually never been any evidence from any us election that prediction markets or betting markets.
00:43:36.700 - 00:44:22.334, Speaker A: I think the interesting thing that people seem to underweight about prediction markets is like, I don't know where the fuck the money in a super PAC is being spent realistically. Right? Like, they have to disclose it. They disclose some of it in chunks of, tell you everything. The prediction market, at least I'm looking at, like, every single transaction, I can, like, see. I can actually see where the money is going, which I actually think is almost better transparency wise, if you care about that, versus kind of like the minimal accounting requirements of some of these other entities. Because, like, okay, well, if I'm going to be funding this thing, and you could imagine that candidates were. A funny thing would be imagine if the candidates were like, liquidity providers to their own market, and then depending on the size, they get, split the fees.
00:44:22.334 - 00:44:24.850, Speaker A: And that was their. That was their funding.
00:44:25.430 - 00:44:35.654, Speaker B: We were making a joke earlier that that was going to be the Trump defi announcement. Trump eats staking derivative and you give the yield to the Trump campaign.
00:44:35.782 - 00:44:36.550, Speaker C: That would be a fun idea.
00:44:36.590 - 00:44:40.334, Speaker A: Trump, if you get that idea from me, you owe me some royalties.
00:44:40.422 - 00:44:41.006, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:44:41.158 - 00:44:42.806, Speaker C: You have to name it after Toronto.
00:44:42.918 - 00:44:43.610, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:44:44.190 - 00:45:01.434, Speaker B: I do think really the reason why different types of futures contracts have gotten banned in the US, it's because of market manipulation or risk for market manipulation. Like onion markets, very famously in the US, because someone cornered the market at some point and basically manipulated it. Hollywood as well.
00:45:01.522 - 00:45:02.970, Speaker C: Bring back the unbobby markets.
00:45:03.050 - 00:45:05.010, Speaker B: Yeah, bring back onion. Where are my.
00:45:05.090 - 00:45:07.042, Speaker C: I want to speculate on onion futures.
00:45:07.146 - 00:45:08.866, Speaker B: I feel bad for the onion farmers.
00:45:09.018 - 00:45:11.466, Speaker D: Yeah, defense.
00:45:11.618 - 00:45:19.840, Speaker B: Yeah. But, yeah, I think until something like that acutely, very happens, it feels very far fetched that somebody would.
00:45:20.000 - 00:45:28.216, Speaker D: It's a lot like the bans on short selling, right? When the market's going down. Like, the first thing that a lot of countries will do is ban short selling, which is obviously stupid and doesn't work.
00:45:28.288 - 00:45:30.416, Speaker C: And, like, it's counterproductive, in fact.
00:45:30.488 - 00:45:31.000, Speaker D: Yes.
00:45:31.120 - 00:45:38.512, Speaker C: Because if you're not able to short something, the price becomes more untethered from reality right in one direction.
00:45:38.576 - 00:45:39.408, Speaker D: It hurts liquidity.
00:45:39.504 - 00:45:56.220, Speaker C: It hurts liquidity, exactly. You might think it's productive, but it's anti productive. It's just like everyone thinks that tariffs are good for an economy. It's like, no, tariffs are not. It's like all these things that seem directionally correct after you break them down are directionally incorrect.
00:45:56.600 - 00:46:09.426, Speaker D: I would say it's more like price controls on a currency. Price controls. It's like, oh, you can only exchange the bolivar to the dollar at this rate. And it's like, well, we're going to go trade it at the real rate over here. While you're not looking at most, artificial.
00:46:09.458 - 00:46:13.826, Speaker C: Controls on anything that deviate from the free market are inefficient in some capacity.
00:46:13.898 - 00:46:41.100, Speaker D: Right. And somewhere it's kind of like pushing on these, like, air pockets. Like, you push it over here and it pops over here. Right. At the end of the day, if people want to either bet on an election or hedge their risk, which is tied to an election, which, like, if you think about it, one of the most momentous markets anywhere in the world, actually. There's a. There's a very famous paper, I think, from, like, 15 years ago called many people in America like to lament that there's so much money in politics and that it's a very corrupting force.
00:46:41.100 - 00:47:19.728, Speaker D: And this great paper which asked the question of why is there so little money in politics? Because if you think about it, right, like, the amount of money, we're talking about, the fair shake pack, right? The fairshake pack, biggest super PAC today, $200 million out of which only 40 million has been spent, which is, in absolute terms, not a lot of money. Given the size of the crypto market and the size of crypto economy, why on that level, it's like, why is there so little being spent when we spend so much money on so much stupider stuff? And this question of how politics is going to shake out for crypto is so momentous to the industry, right? Like, the amount of money that is the amount of market cap, the ev of the election, the ev of it.
00:47:19.744 - 00:47:24.608, Speaker C: Is way bigger, is somewhere along the lines of, like, $2 trillion.
00:47:24.704 - 00:47:33.194, Speaker A: I mean, this is, again, another reason why her claim that they're billionaires is manipulating the market is crazy. There's only been a billion dollars in cumulative volume.
00:47:33.362 - 00:47:34.762, Speaker C: Volume. Not even, like, opening.
00:47:34.786 - 00:47:34.922, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:47:34.946 - 00:47:35.626, Speaker B: Not even opening.
00:47:35.698 - 00:47:38.750, Speaker A: Yeah. It's like, how. What are you talking about?
00:47:39.130 - 00:47:48.634, Speaker B: I do also find it, I think, like, you know, in the sort of in trade predicted days, obviously it was very novel to have prediction markets in.
00:47:48.642 - 00:47:50.310, Speaker D: Trade predicted being early prediction.
00:47:51.210 - 00:48:35.692, Speaker B: Very novel way to sort of get signal on what's actually happening with the election. Because in those days also, everyone just reported national popular vote polls, which was totally pointless for the most part. Then obviously you have 538 come along, take a more sophisticated approach to modeling, and get more accurate. And I think in my respect, it does feel like kind of the tail wagging the dog, where I actually think those kinds of sophisticated models are more accurate and less biased than what's happening in the market. And there's actually another good paper out recently talking about this exact phenomenon that on certain markets, like manifold or predict it, where maybe they're very constrained, yeah. They can be more accurate than a sophisticated model. But for something like polymarket, it is more entertainment.
00:48:35.692 - 00:48:39.000, Speaker B: It's not like this is actually moving the market. It's actually kind of like the other way around.
00:48:39.740 - 00:48:44.020, Speaker D: Wait, I didn't follow. What are you saying that polymarket diverges more because it's more like entertainment?
00:48:44.060 - 00:48:53.784, Speaker B: It's less accurate in predicting the outcome of certain elections than just a sophisticated model, like a 538 style model, period. Or I guess whoever's new thing is the silver bulb.
00:48:53.852 - 00:48:59.576, Speaker D: Interesting. Yeah, I've seen. I mean, I have to imagine that polymarket has really gone through a phase transition.
00:48:59.648 - 00:48:59.856, Speaker B: Yes.
00:48:59.888 - 00:49:02.888, Speaker D: It's. With the amount of money that's there now relative to what there was a.
00:49:02.904 - 00:49:19.912, Speaker C: Year or two ago, it's still not like that deep of a market. Even on the headline markets of Trump versus Harris, it's only $100,000 to trade a couple points up and down. There's not that much liquidity.
00:49:20.096 - 00:49:24.296, Speaker D: There's not a ton of liquidity. But relative to where it was a year ago.
00:49:24.328 - 00:49:28.664, Speaker A: Yeah, right. It definitely attracted a lot more noise traders. That's kind of like, what?
00:49:28.832 - 00:49:46.296, Speaker B: And I think it's really actually more interesting for these long tail markets like the VPNAM market. If you were trying to track that, there really was not a lot of great signal coming from mainstream media outlets. You know, for a while, it was always gonna be Shapiro. And then walls was like, 4%, and then in a few days, you know, he shoots up to 100%.
00:49:46.368 - 00:49:52.280, Speaker A: And so, I mean, I've been seeing all the people on Twitter being like, oh, this is proof they don't work. I'm like, come on.
00:49:52.320 - 00:49:57.476, Speaker B: Like, yeah, if you didn't have that, you actually have no idea. You would have thought it would have been Shapiro. For the longest time.
00:49:57.508 - 00:50:01.932, Speaker A: Yeah. The media made it sound like Shapiro, too. Right. So it wasn't really like, that's why.
00:50:01.956 - 00:50:09.732, Speaker C: The prediction market, I think, reflected those odds is because the media was making it seem like it was a choice between, like, one candidate and, like, who else.
00:50:09.796 - 00:50:10.116, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:50:10.188 - 00:50:19.700, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. Or even, you know, frankly, something as wild as Biden dropping out that was so unpredictable for, you know, the longest time.
00:50:19.740 - 00:50:23.740, Speaker A: And then, although that one, you could argue the prediction markets did well on they front ran.
00:50:23.780 - 00:50:42.600, Speaker B: Yeah. The market. Some just purely us presidential election markets. I think for everything else, that's really where prediction markets shine because you're not getting, there's not a machine set up to do predictions the same way there is for elections for these sort of longer tail events. There's not really that kind of infrastructure.
00:50:42.640 - 00:51:02.048, Speaker D: So I don't know. I mean, if you look at like, so Nate Silver, the original founder of 538, has kind of reinvigorated a lot of the kind of scientific polling or model making around scientific polling. His model looks very in line with the polymarket odds. Right. There's like very small divergence. It's like, well, I think the exactly the same. And then it was just a few percent.
00:51:02.048 - 00:51:02.568, Speaker D: Yeah, exactly.
00:51:02.584 - 00:51:23.824, Speaker A: The feedback loop between them is like people sort of treat the models as, like the external price. Like in the same way that, like on chain, on Dexs, like, you have the binance price, people arbitrage relative to that. And there's something people oftentimes treat the models or the news prediction as effectively like an oracle price, and then they trade relative to that.
00:51:23.952 - 00:51:48.502, Speaker B: That's more, my point is that's kind of the tail wagging the dog. And I think the paper I was referencing, too, was talking about state by state basis. And that's how it sort of draws the correlation, because you're right that on a national level, you get one shot every four years. And so there's not a lot of data points, whereas if you look at the prediction markets versus sort of modeling ability to predict state elections and how accurate they are, that's where you kind of see the reliability of the models.
00:51:48.606 - 00:52:33.826, Speaker D: Right. And I guess there is some part of it also, of course, is the capital constraint and the capital efficiency that right now on poly market is relatively low. So every market is kind of cordoned off, and they all expire at the time of the election. And so there is some sense in which the odds should actually be getting more accurate the closer you get to the election because of the fact that the cost of capital, the opportunity cost of that capital is decreasing. So this far out, it's like, okay, well, there's four months for the election, and those four months, it's like, well, interest rate is 5%, which means that it's actually unprofitable. If you're going to pay 2% in opportunity cost between now and then, it's actually unprofitable to say, well, the real odds are 55 and they're giving it 53. I can arbitrage it back to 55.
00:52:33.826 - 00:53:13.266, Speaker D: Even excluding fees or liquidity, it's actually not profitable for anybody to do that, which means that the bansite, ironically, the interest rate actually gives some bound on these long dated markets for being able to actually track the true value of an asset. There's a natural function of these very long dated assets like prediction markets. Unless there's something that can allow you to get better utilization of the capital that's in those prediction markets, I don't know, but that seems pretty difficult to do without knowing ex ante the correlation matrix between, like, well, you know, if, like, Kamala wins, how much more likely is it?
00:53:13.298 - 00:53:26.082, Speaker A: I mean, there have been some, some people who've been trying to claim, hey, look, if you're resting liquidity in a prediction market, maybe you can earn yield on it in another way and then pass it back so it offsets that somewhat.
00:53:26.146 - 00:53:26.538, Speaker D: Right.
00:53:26.634 - 00:53:32.656, Speaker A: And so I think a lot of people who are trying to be like, oh, we're changing the prediction market mechanism or doing things like this to, like.
00:53:32.768 - 00:53:35.256, Speaker C: Tighten that, improve capital efficiency.
00:53:35.328 - 00:53:45.984, Speaker A: But it's like, it doesn't feel like it changes the, the fact of the matter, which is that the participants in this market are already so far off in the risk spectrum, they're not like, super low risk.
00:53:46.152 - 00:53:50.408, Speaker C: They're looking to triple their money by picking an outcome of the thing correctly.
00:53:50.464 - 00:53:52.920, Speaker A: Yeah. They don't care about the presidential election.
00:53:52.960 - 00:53:54.168, Speaker D: Obviously, you're not tripling your money.
00:53:54.264 - 00:53:58.328, Speaker C: Well, if the odds are 33%, which they're not. No. Now, but they were.
00:53:58.344 - 00:53:59.240, Speaker A: I mean, they were. Yeah.
00:53:59.280 - 00:54:00.560, Speaker D: Like a few days ago.
00:54:00.640 - 00:54:06.196, Speaker C: Right. So it's like, you know, find doubling your money, everyone thinks they're going to.
00:54:06.348 - 00:54:27.210, Speaker D: That's true. That's true. Double your money in four months. And obviously, that's going to be the dominant factor for most people who are betting emotionally. And at the end of the day, it's kind of like sports betting. Like, you have to make it emotional. You have to make it fun and engaging to get more and more people into the fray for the kind of financial types to actually even think it's worthwhile to, like, make the markets and make them liquidity.
00:54:27.280 - 00:54:27.890, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:54:28.870 - 00:54:43.678, Speaker D: But it'll probably be a while before we see real kind of market depth comparable to, I think, what the gravity of the market warrants. Right. There will be a point where somebody is hedging their own geopolitical risk on a prediction market. Right.
00:54:43.694 - 00:54:54.712, Speaker C: But I still don't think even the markets are remotely close enough to being liquid enough for that. A major corporation or industry can't even use them to hedgehead because, like, there's like $100,000 of liquidity.
00:54:54.776 - 00:54:55.168, Speaker D: Right.
00:54:55.264 - 00:54:57.264, Speaker C: The volume of trading is huge.
00:54:57.392 - 00:54:57.984, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:54:58.112 - 00:55:02.340, Speaker C: But if you want to put on a $10 million position, you can't. You, like, physically can't.
00:55:03.200 - 00:55:13.872, Speaker D: But that is what I'm claiming will change. Yeah, that is what I think will change. Yeah. Hopefully. Hopefully it will be interesting. Okay. Last piece that I wanted to talk through is the Solana out performance.
00:55:13.872 - 00:55:47.600, Speaker D: We kind of alluded to it earlier when we were talking about how Solana has been kind of pulling out of the rebound. There's definitely a resounding Solana summer vibe, as we've seen. For the first month, Solana's Dex volumes were higher for the entire month over Ethereum. And if you look at net of the mev tips and all the fees and everything, that has also flipped Ethereum for the first time. We saw an individual days where that has happened, or even weeks. But now we've seen an entire month of sustained activity with Solana netting higher than Ethereum. Despite that, there's been a lot of.
00:55:47.600 - 00:56:47.620, Speaker D: Many people have noted that Solana still has a dearth of vc investment in the ecosystem. If you think about just the total amount of dollars going into the Ethereum EVM compatible ecosystem, it's pretty massive. But if you look around at a lot of the Solana conferences or hackathons and so on, it doesn't really seem like we're seeing the same volume of capital coming into that ecosystem. And of course, it's also true that in the Solana ecosystem, the biggest winners have been Solana itself, some degree Jupiter, and then mostly meme coins, not the rest of the Solana ecosystem, of the DeFi applications and so on, and the more web two or, sorry, web3 style apps on Solana. So curious to go around and get your take of how do you feel about where the Solana ecosystem is at? Obviously, the meme connectivity is driving a ton of revenue and a ton of fees, but where do we think this is going? And why isn't it that we have seen this congealing of more of a complete vc ecosystem comparable to the Ethereum ecosystem? Tom, why don't you start?
00:56:48.240 - 00:56:49.340, Speaker B: I'm the Solana.
00:56:50.080 - 00:56:50.872, Speaker D: No, Tarun is.
00:56:50.896 - 00:56:54.288, Speaker A: But you can see, I definitely would say I'm probably the most proud.
00:56:54.304 - 00:56:57.340, Speaker D: Yeah, you're the most. Let you go last.
00:56:57.640 - 00:57:50.872, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think it's always this sort of ev calculation. I was actually thinking about this recently when I was talking about obviously the canadian economy is not doing super hot right now. Everyone's like, oh, there's brain drain to the US and we should be doing more to encourage startups in Canada. And part of the answer is, well, if you're an entrepreneur and you want to start a company, there's way more capital, it's a way bigger market, it's way easier to do that in the US, you're going to have a way bigger outcome. And so unless you change that equation, it's hard to have it make sense. I think there's a very similar dynamic for entrepreneurs and VC's, for different chain ecosystems of, well, if I want to start a new DeFi project, maybe I can do it in this new ecosystem and hope that I can get enough capital and users and make the whole wheel start turning. But for VC's, they'll look at it and they see, hey, this is a smaller ecosystem with a smaller likely outcome, and so therefore your valuation is probably going to be smaller.
00:57:50.872 - 00:57:54.448, Speaker B: And I think this is the tension I see when I look at investment.
00:57:54.504 - 00:58:08.360, Speaker D: But people don't launch these things directly on Ethereum. That often, very often is like, oh, I'm on arbitrum, I'm on base, I'm on something else, op or whatever. And those individual ecosystems are each smaller than Solana.
00:58:08.940 - 00:58:19.252, Speaker B: Yeah, but EVM is also, you can multi home pretty easily, which is also, I think, what we see where, hey, I'm going to do all the major deploy to six, every single. Yeah, exactly. And it's not additional overhead infrastructure to.
00:58:19.276 - 00:58:22.804, Speaker A: Do well, it's definitely overhead.
00:58:22.932 - 00:58:23.948, Speaker B: Not substantially.
00:58:24.004 - 00:58:28.350, Speaker A: So. Trust me, dealing with those oracles when things are crashing is, that's a substantial overhead.
00:58:28.430 - 00:58:30.370, Speaker D: Hopefully things aren't crashing all the time.
00:58:30.710 - 00:58:33.030, Speaker C: Only when they carry trade on mines.
00:58:33.150 - 00:58:36.606, Speaker D: Only when the bank of Japan, 17 years as they raised.
00:58:36.718 - 00:58:40.290, Speaker A: I'm just saying it's not just one click. I never think about it.
00:58:40.750 - 00:59:14.788, Speaker B: But yeah, I think the answer is, well, again, can we kind of have this with the application investment thing a few weeks ago? Which is, well, you actually want to see great outcomes in this ecosystem, and you want to see valuations and comps go up so that when entrepreneurs are raising and VC's are investing, they know that there's a good outcome. There's a good story at the end of the road, and right now, it feels like there's that question mark. And so as an entrepreneur, are you going to willingly take a lower valuation and have a less favorable capital environment if you're going to go and do something kind of esoteric, Karl, what do you say?
00:59:14.924 - 00:59:47.898, Speaker C: Yeah, I would say it's an inefficiency that smart participants in the market will solve to make an outside profit for themselves. Fine. If there's not enough VC's in the Solani ecosystem, then the smart VC's will migrate there and specialize there. And until they do, they'll have market returns. And the ones that migrate first will have above market returns, and then the opportunity will close, and then everyone will return to market returns again. You know, so if you think it.
00:59:47.914 - 00:59:54.698, Speaker D: Is, you're declaring that's an arb, there's free money sitting on the table. Yeah, they're probably. You going to spend more time in the Solana ecosystem as an investor from robot?
00:59:54.754 - 00:59:55.634, Speaker C: Yeah, I want to.
00:59:55.762 - 00:59:56.290, Speaker D: Okay.
00:59:56.370 - 00:59:57.642, Speaker A: Like, we have.
00:59:57.746 - 01:00:07.826, Speaker C: Yeah, we have. Right. But, like, you know. Yes, like, more people should be spending more time if that's where the activity is migrating to. Like, you want to be ahead of the curve, not behind it.
01:00:07.898 - 01:00:08.418, Speaker D: Right.
01:00:08.554 - 01:00:12.680, Speaker C: And so, like, I think that that's just is opportunity. It's not a problem.
01:00:13.980 - 01:00:17.668, Speaker D: It's a problem if you're a founder in Solana land and you're getting a lower valuation. Right.
01:00:17.764 - 01:00:21.684, Speaker C: If you're a founder in Solana land, message Tarun and I, and we'll chat.
01:00:21.772 - 01:01:16.608, Speaker D: Yeah. Well, so it's interesting because I feel like every cycle, there is some change in the meta, right? And that change in the meta creates an opportunity for a new fund or a new strategy that is, like, sometimes overfitted, but very much, like, kind of catered to that particular change in the meta to have a really meteoric rise. So if you think about in, I don't know, 2018, like FPG or something, and then in 2021, you saw Delphi kind of rise to the top of the ranks and become super competitive from their web3 metaverse gaming strategy. And so it allows you to kind of skip a bunch of spots on the leaderboard if you are able to take advantage of the way in which the meta has just shifted. And so it sounds like you are projecting that the shift over into Solana it's still early. The VC's haven't caught up yet. And if you shift now, I think about folks like, was it Logan? What's Logan's fund?
01:01:16.744 - 01:01:19.840, Speaker A: Logan J. I forget the name.
01:01:19.880 - 01:01:20.448, Speaker D: Frictionless.
01:01:20.544 - 01:01:20.944, Speaker A: Frictionless.
01:01:20.992 - 01:01:36.308, Speaker D: Frictionless, frictionless. Right. So that's one example of a fund that's very catered towards the Solana or big brain. Do you think that these six men, do you think that these are going to see like this sort of rising in the hierarchy of venture because of them being early to this?
01:01:36.364 - 01:02:01.320, Speaker C: Probably, yes, if it hands out, and so far it looks like it's panning out, but again, it's too soon to tell. Like we're talking about trends that have been around for like six months, right? In a lot of ways where it's like if in a year and a half we're like, oh my God, Solana overtook Ethereum in terms of like applications and like users and market cap. Then at that time we're going to look back at the VC's that were focused on Solana and be like, very likely they outperformed everybody.
01:02:01.780 - 01:03:18.440, Speaker A: Yeah, I think there's a couple of things. First, I think the reliability of the network has gone up significantly thanks to things like Cheeto, which disclosure investor, because I think a lot of the infrastructure problems that Solana had when it first had a ton of demand in 2021 and 2022 have been ameliorated by kind of engineering solutions versus theoretical, fully baked research solutions. In the sense that I do feel like there's a sense in which the Solano ecosystem founders and engineers are much more pragmatic. In Ethereum, I think there's a high startup cost that is perceived by both founders and investors in the sense that, well, if I'm going to build something and it has enough novelty, it needs to be a roll up or it needs to have its own infrastructure, and that infrastructure just has a higher cost which implicitly gets priced into the valuation. Now, the question of whether we can see those valuations persist in the long run post unlocks will be a very interesting era for roll ups. The second thing is, I think the interoperability story has been on. Ethereum has just been abysmal in a lot of ways.
01:03:18.440 - 01:03:34.284, Speaker A: I feel like it is a lot of effort to actually move between rollups. In a lot of ways, fine, simple token transfers are easy, but suppose I want to migrate an LP position, it's a pain in the ass. And the message passing bridge is, yeah.
01:03:34.292 - 01:03:35.812, Speaker C: There'S more fragmentation than that, there's just.
01:03:35.836 - 01:03:51.728, Speaker A: More fragmentation and stuff. As an example, I was in the country of Georgia recently, and I need to get money from base to Tron because I could paying USDT on Tron for like toothpaste and cocktails. The first time I ever like toothpaste. Yeah, yeah.
01:03:51.744 - 01:03:54.456, Speaker C: The farm and cocktails and cocktails bars were taking Tron.
01:03:54.528 - 01:04:25.402, Speaker A: So basically the story with Georgia is if you're georgian or american or european, you'll just use Apple pay for most things. But there's a ton of Russians who came to Georgia post Ukraine war, and a lot of them can't really get bank accounts or use swift because they've been kind of sanctioned banned. So they all use tether, and they're actually relatively wealthy relative to the locals. So they spend a lot in tether. And so they're these pos devices that you will give you a QR code and you pay in Tron.
01:04:25.506 - 01:04:26.770, Speaker D: What company do you know?
01:04:26.890 - 01:04:32.670, Speaker A: I have no clue, but it's definitely trustwallow thing. So binance is somehow. Somehow it can't be that far away.
01:04:33.170 - 01:04:33.834, Speaker D: I see.
01:04:33.922 - 01:04:59.392, Speaker A: But I don't know. The first time I did, and it took me almost 40 minutes to figure out how to get a money onto Tron. There was some really sketchy bridge that was an EOA on one side. It was just like. I was like. And whereas you think about the experience on Solana, for someone who's never used crypto, who's trading meme coins, they don't have to think about all these crazy things. They don't have to go understand what this bridge is doing, et cetera.
01:04:59.392 - 01:05:43.472, Speaker A: So I think there's a lot of ux stuff. I mean, it's not that I'm not in the long run. I think grow ups will eventually figure out a lot of these things, but I think it's just the pace of development is slow. There's not this kind of engineering mindset in a lot of parts of Ethereum, which I think has slowed it down in terms of performance, in terms of new applications. And I think the other thing is, if we think about the applications that are most successful in crypto, very few of them applications on infrastructure, very few of them really needed that much funding to get off the ground. If I think about Uniswap, I think about polymarket, I think about pump fun. They didn't really need that much money to get off the ground.
01:05:43.472 - 01:06:11.498, Speaker A: Once the infrastructure is sufficiently good, you could start easily. And I think in Solana, people just don't need that much money. So, fine. The valuations are lower they just go do it. And if it's successful, like pumped out fund, then obviously you have this huge amount of fees and valuation increase. So you should care about the delta and increase in valuation much more than you care about where you start. And I think that makes it potentially less attractive to VC's, but also at the same time, or more attractive if.
01:06:11.514 - 01:06:12.322, Speaker C: You do it correctly.
01:06:12.386 - 01:06:26.074, Speaker A: Yeah. Or more attractive if you're willing to size correctly, do more syndication. Right. You have to think of the strategy in terms of more diversification rather than more concentration in ecosystems like this. And I think that's sort of a portfolio construction.
01:06:26.122 - 01:07:01.852, Speaker D: Yeah. If you're an early stage investor, I think Solana ecosystem is relatively more attractive because the multiples are there, even if the net dollar amounts are going to be smaller. That sounds right to me. And I like your point that this is a wedge for an emerging VC to make a name for themselves and find a niche that maybe is being underserved by a lot of the bigger guys. To Tom's point, it is just true that the quantum of capital that's available on Solana is just smaller. It's like 5 billion in total in TVL. And Solana, compared to the EVM ecosystem writ large is just basically everything else.
01:07:01.852 - 01:07:05.188, Speaker D: That's pretty much all the other money is on the EVM of one form of.
01:07:05.204 - 01:07:08.764, Speaker C: It's just that the velocity of the money on Solana is so much higher.
01:07:08.892 - 01:07:38.190, Speaker D: Right. But specifically, when you're toward the beating heart of Solana, which is around pump fund meme coins, radium, that's where the velocity is very, very high. So what I would tell a founder today is that, look, if you're doing anything touching meme coins or you're doing anything that's very kind of intrinsically Degen, or you are doing D pen, absolutely 100%, you should be on Solana. There's nowhere else to go. I think anything outside of there. It really depends on what you're building, who your audience is. There's really nothing else that I'd say.
01:07:38.190 - 01:08:13.196, Speaker D: Obviously, you should be on Solana. And I think the reality is that if you look at the experience of the old school defi founders on Solana, like the guys who built out the original trading markets, lending markets, the perps markets, all that stuff, their fate is very different from the folks who are doing the meme coin stuff. It's a tale of two cities. There's people who are eating rich, and then there's a lot of people who are just left for dead, and we don't talk about them anymore, even though their protocols are still used and still are part of that value chain in salon.
01:08:13.228 - 01:08:16.256, Speaker A: Are you thinking of the orca? Someone like orca?
01:08:16.288 - 01:08:24.216, Speaker D: Someone like Orca Soland? A lot of these players were there early and really still have big TVL numbers.
01:08:24.248 - 01:08:28.504, Speaker A: But to be fair, this happened in Ethereum too. Look at Xerox, look at the protocol.
01:08:28.552 - 01:08:30.620, Speaker D: But they're not still dominant.
01:08:31.040 - 01:08:34.780, Speaker A: But I'm just saying that's inevitable. And you think you might just kind of.
01:08:35.600 - 01:08:36.980, Speaker D: The scale factor is very different.
01:08:37.640 - 01:08:48.046, Speaker B: I think zero actually worth more than orca. So that's fair. But again, it goes back to, well, you want to get listed on a centralized exchange. Ten times easier to do that if you're an ERC 20 versus if you're.
01:08:48.118 - 01:08:52.290, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah. And look, I do think that that will converge over time just because people get more useful.
01:08:52.750 - 01:08:59.330, Speaker A: I actually think the SPL stuff is not an issue anymore. Like if I look at blur for whatever, right. That was like almost instant.
01:09:00.070 - 01:09:04.566, Speaker B: It's not a technical issue, but it's more, hey, when you're like talking to. It's different.
01:09:04.678 - 01:09:16.182, Speaker D: Yeah, it is, it is. And like, look, some of these things are not rational. Some of these things are just like, well, there's a kind of a vibe to an SPL token that in exchange just kind of, well, you know, they sort of have associations in their mind with like, things that are.
01:09:16.206 - 01:09:20.198, Speaker A: I feel like people are getting over that. I really do feel like that's changing quite a bit.
01:09:20.254 - 01:09:35.518, Speaker D: I think whether they're getting over it or not, I think the thing that is clear right now is that like Solana at this point has this like very, very large. What's the term for like the inequality measure?
01:09:35.654 - 01:09:36.302, Speaker A: Genie coefficient.
01:09:36.326 - 01:10:31.892, Speaker D: Genie coefficient, right. It has very high genie coefficient on Solana relative to what I see in other ecosystems where there's people just crushing it, getting incredibly rich, and then most people are just like, wait, where is everybody? That's what Solana feels like to me. And I think that feels less true in a lot of the ethereum ecosystems, is that if you think about the people fighting it out on blast or base or whatever, it just feels like it is easier for people to get off the ground and find somebody to show up and use their protocols. Now, is the market wrong to be ascribing these multiples and so on? The other thing ill say, and I dont know, look, it might well be, and I think thats possible that there will be more of a catch up. But right now weve seen with the rebound most of the rebound is not orca and things like that. Most of the rebound is dotcoins in the Solana ecosystem. The last thing ill say is that I think Solana is putting a lot of competitive pressure on the ethereum ecosystem.
01:10:31.892 - 01:10:37.500, Speaker D: So if you look at the new generation of EVM chains, they're all a response to Solana for sure.
01:10:37.540 - 01:11:19.630, Speaker A: I think one interesting thing is when you talk to Ethereum core developers or you talk to people who are the older generation rollups, they generally are unwilling to be like, oh, we could learn something from reading the Solana code base. But if you look at the newer generation of rollups, like the ones that are launching, they're trying to be high performance. They're much more trying to draw inspiration from Solana's code base. Right. And it's like interesting because the Solana side is like everyone is looking at the ETH code base and code bases and drawing inspiration. And I feel like that, like, fact that the learning was all going one way reminded me a little bit of like bitcoin Maxis being like, oh, we never need to learn anything from Ethereum.
01:11:19.670 - 01:11:21.050, Speaker C: Or like China and the US.
01:11:22.950 - 01:11:25.266, Speaker D: Wait, who's China? Who's the US in this analogy?
01:11:25.398 - 01:11:45.698, Speaker A: Depends on which product, I guess. Right? But like I think there's kind of this interesting thing where like the newer entrants are realizing they need to learn things from Solana, which I think was like just a, you, you know, you would be outcast to say that we should learn 100%, like even like six months ago.
01:11:45.794 - 01:12:07.622, Speaker B: And that, I think to be clear, I think everything I'm saying is not supposed to be a judge of the, the quality of Solana products or builders or the chain. Actually, we have some in our portfolio. They're fantastic. Nothing but respect. It's more of like a capital markets comment. It's like, would you want to go public in China or do you want to go public in the US? Well, there's a reason why ADR's exist and cdrs don't exist.
01:12:07.806 - 01:12:23.522, Speaker A: Sure. Although I think the problem with the roll up marketing is like, hey, you can join the US, but you have to start your own state. And starting your own state is a lot more work than building a building in Tokyo. Yeah, and I think that difference is.
01:12:23.686 - 01:12:56.880, Speaker D: Thats happening on the roll up side too, is that everybodys losing the base. Right now. Base is just gobbling up everything with respect to roll up market share. Its making it really tough for anybody else to get any oxygen. And the same thing happening on Solana in many ways because of the fact that retail is basically on two chains, which is base and Solana and almost everything, whether its meme coins, whether its just crazy DJN experiments or the cool new thing thats happening, its almost always happening on one of these two chains now. But I do like this point. I think it's a good note to end on is that Solana has raised the bar for everybody.
01:12:56.880 - 01:13:45.116, Speaker D: Anybody who's launching a chain now or anybody who's doing any kind of R and D. It's always a question of, what is your answer to Solana? Why would someone not just use Solana instead of using your stupid fancy new thing? I think that is ultimately what you want to see in a market is people responding to each other's challenges and technology winnowing its way to get better and better. So what I want to see in the long run is Solana getting better in many ways. All the stuff that they're talking about, multiproposer going in a way in a response to what's happening in the MEV, stuff that's also evolving on Solana in response to what they see happening on Ethereum. And in the same way Ethereum or the EVM ecosystem saying, oh, shit, we got to get better on latency, we got to get better on throughput, we got to get better on making this retail friendly experience and not these 40 minutes wait times to move an asset from here to there.
01:13:45.268 - 01:14:06.636, Speaker A: Yeah, some of the. I just also, the other thing is, like, the high variance and interop quality across bridges. If you're a random user and you like Google, like, how do I bridge between X and Y and you choose the first result, chances are you chose a highly suboptimal one. Maybe your funds are locked for 20 minutes. You haven't been able to think of. You know what I mean? Like, you don't think about that on these integrated chains. So you need.
01:14:06.636 - 01:14:17.870, Speaker A: I think, like, we're seeing people trying to turn this in a pure, think of this from a pure engineering standpoint, but I also think there's a sense in which, yeah, people need to learn lessons both.
01:14:17.910 - 01:14:23.598, Speaker D: Yeah, well, we also got the SVM roll ups coming, so we're going to feel like every lesson is going to be learned on every side.
01:14:23.694 - 01:14:27.414, Speaker A: I'm. Yeah, I guess they're live, so they are. Well, eclipse is live.
01:14:27.582 - 01:14:29.510, Speaker D: I didn't. I didn't know that.
01:14:29.590 - 01:14:30.250, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:14:31.430 - 01:14:35.702, Speaker D: How's the launch gone? Pretty good with this eclipse? Like, the number.
01:14:35.766 - 01:14:37.874, Speaker A: They're the number one blob producer on Celestia. Right now.
01:14:37.902 - 01:14:38.402, Speaker C: Now.
01:14:38.546 - 01:14:40.410, Speaker D: No kidding. Yeah, no kidding.
01:14:40.570 - 01:14:42.910, Speaker A: They, like, doubled Celestia fees.
01:14:43.650 - 01:14:44.630, Speaker C: Why don't we.
01:14:45.650 - 01:14:47.618, Speaker D: Let's get. Yeah.
01:14:47.634 - 01:14:51.990, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, no, I actually think for in Singapore we should get Antoine.
01:14:53.010 - 01:14:53.706, Speaker D: That'd be great.
01:14:53.778 - 01:14:54.106, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:14:54.178 - 01:15:03.670, Speaker D: Yeah. Yeah. That'd be a good one. Okay, well, we got a wrap. Thank you, everybody. We'll be checking back in next week. Hopefully markets will come down until then.
01:15:03.670 - 01:15:05.200, Speaker D: See, everybody?
01:15:07.580 - 01:15:08.724, Speaker A: I gotta run the meeting.
01:15:08.812 - 01:15:09.252, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah.
01:15:09.276 - 01:15:09.900, Speaker D: I'm late for something.
