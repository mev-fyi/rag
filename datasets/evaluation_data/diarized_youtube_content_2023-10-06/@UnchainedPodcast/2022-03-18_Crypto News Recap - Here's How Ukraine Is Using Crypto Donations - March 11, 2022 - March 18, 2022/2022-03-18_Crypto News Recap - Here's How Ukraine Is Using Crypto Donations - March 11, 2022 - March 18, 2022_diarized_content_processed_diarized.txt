00:00:06.810 - 00:01:08.670, Speaker A: Thanks for tuning into this week's news. Recap crypto legalized in Ukraine as government uses donations to buy supplies Alex Bornukov, the Deputy Minister of Digital Transformation of Ukraine, reported last Friday that the country has begun to utilize the funds donated to Ukraine via crypto. According to Bornikov, Ukraine has purchased, among other things, 500 bulletproof vests, 500 helmets and 410,000 packed lunches for its army. Tweeted bornikov crypto assets proved extremely helpful in facilitation of funding flows to the armed forces of Ukraine. This week, President Volodymyr Zelensky legalized crypto within Ukraine's borders by signing the law of Ukraine on virtual assets. By signing the bill, virtual assets officially come under the jurisdiction of Ukraine's securities and Stock Market Commission, according to Ukraine's Ministry of Finance. The bill will also allow foreign and Ukrainian crypto exchanges to operate legally within the country, with support from Ukrainian banks.
00:01:08.670 - 00:01:42.720, Speaker A: Ukraine is also planning on launching a set of NFTs, reports The Guardian. Deputy Minister Bonyakov told the guardian that Ukraine's NFT collection would be like a museum of the Russian Ukrainian war. We want to tell the world in an NFT format. Bornikov added that each NFT would include a piece of art memorializing a new story. We want it to be cool, good looking, and it takes time, he told The Guardian. A week ago, Elliptic estimated that Ukraine has received over $63 million in crypto donations on chain, while CoinDesk reported that the number was closer to $100 million.
00:01:43.330 - 00:01:46.634, Speaker B: The merge is Coming The Ethereum merge.
00:01:46.682 - 00:02:12.898, Speaker A: Occurred on the Kiln testnet this week, taking the smart contract network one step closer to its transition from a proof of work consensus mechanism to proof of stake a moment in time called the merge by Ethereums. According to a blog post by Ethereum Foundation developers, Kiln is expected to be the last merge testnet created before existing public testnets are upgraded. From there, the merge will go to Mainnet and Ethereum will be fully secured.
00:02:12.994 - 00:02:15.606, Speaker B: Proof of stake that being said, a.
00:02:15.628 - 00:03:04.534, Speaker A: Date for the merge on Main net has yet to be set. Only once the merge successfully occurs on the public testnets will an exact date be known. Ethereum's approach to the merge comes as data from Ether scan shows that over 10 million Ether have been staked to the official ETH Two deposit address. This surmises a roughly $29 billion bet by ETH stakers that Ethereum will successfully merge at current prices, with Ethereum's market cap sitting around $337,000,000,000. That means roughly 8% of all ETH is locked into the network's consensus layer, formerly known as ETH Two. With the merge, analysts are expecting a drastic decrease in ETH issuance. For example, Hop Protocols Lido Cohen calculated that daily ETH emissions will drop 90% after the merge, or the equivalent of.
00:03:04.572 - 00:03:08.514, Speaker B: Three bitcoin havings in one consensus raised.
00:03:08.562 - 00:03:53.830, Speaker A: At a $7 billion valuation. Ethereum Application and Infrastructure Builder Consensus announced a $450,000,000 Series D funding round, valuing the firm at $7 billion, more than doubling its November valuation. Terrify Capital led the round with Trad five behemoths like SoftBank and Microsoft a computing behemoth also participating. Consensus plans to add 300 employees with the funds. The Consensus raise coincided with the ethereum focused company reporting that MetaMask had reached 30 million monthly active users. They did not define what a monthly active user is. The digital wallet, according to a decrypt interview with Consensus founder Joe Lubin, will soon begin pursuing progressive decentralization.
00:03:53.830 - 00:04:33.330, Speaker A: Lubin revealed that a MetaMask related Dow is in the works and confirmed that MetaMask intends to launch a token. The raise comes at a contentious time, as 35 former Consensus AG shareholders recently initiated an audit regarding serious irregularities in a deal that saw MetaMask and Infura transferred from one consensus entity, Consensus AG to another at what they say is a low valuation. The shareholders claim that this deal was to the detriment of the minority shareholders of Consensus AG and to the benefit of Lubin personally. Consensus AG has since disputed these claims.
00:04:33.990 - 00:04:34.738, Speaker B: Coming soon.
00:04:34.824 - 00:04:56.118, Speaker A: Instagram NFTs meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg confirmed that Instagram will be supporting NFTs in the near term in a panel at south by Southwest. According to Engadget Senior Editor Carissa Bell, the Financial Times reported Meta's intent to bring NFTs to both Instagram and Facebook in January. Disclosure I write a metaboletin newsletter.
00:04:56.294 - 00:04:57.110, Speaker B: Instagram.
00:04:57.190 - 00:05:05.870, Speaker A: Adding support would be a massive milestone for crypto, with CNBC reporting in December that the app engages 2 billion monthly active users.
00:05:06.850 - 00:05:10.206, Speaker B: Gary Gensler gets flak from congressman on.
00:05:10.228 - 00:06:17.270, Speaker A: Wednesday, SEC chair Gary Gensler received a strongly worded letter from eight members of the congressional blockchain caucus. The letter claims that the securities and Exchange Commission's recent investigations into crypto firms are inconsistent with standard procedure and might be at ODS with the Paperwork Reduction Act. The representatives asked Chair Gensler to answer 13 questions pertaining to the burden of voluntary document requests on crypto companies, including how many voluntary document requests the SEC has sent to crypto entities and the associated compliance costs. Representative Tom Emmer spearheaded the letter and did not hold back from directly addressing Gensler's actions on Twitter. My office has received numerous tips from crypto and blockchain firms that SEC Chair Gary Gensler's information reporting requests to the crypto community are overburdensome, don't feel particularly voluntary, and are stifling innovation, he wrote. Crypto startups must not be weighed down by extrajurisdictional and burdensome reporting requirements. We will ensure our regulators do not kill American innovation and opportunities.
00:06:17.270 - 00:07:04.622, Speaker A: In related news on Thursday, Senator Elizabeth Warren introduced a bill during a hearing on digital assets and Russian crypto use that would grant treasury the right to bar crypto service providers from doing business with any crypto address associated with Russia. As has been the trend with U. S. Legislation, the definition of a digital asset transaction facilitator is rather vague and will most likely spark protest from lobbying institutions such as the Blockchain Association and Coin Center. Don't sleep on DeFi OGS the Meme goes that the bear market is a time to build. And this week, a slew of DeFi protocols proved the meme to be true. SushiSwap launched phase one of its product, Trident, a framework for deploying automated market makers on polygon.

00:08:05.610 - 00:08:09.646, Speaker B: Time for fun bits three friends slew.
00:08:09.698 - 00:09:00.706, Speaker A: Their way to a mystery gift from Larvae Labs. This week, three friends, led by Andrew Botter found the private keys to a $25,000 NFT in an impressive bit of sleuthing. The story, as summarized by Botter on Twitter, began during the Grail's drop last month, in which 20 artworks by 20 anonymous artists were released, with the artist names being revealed postmint. As it turns out, Grail Eleven was a piece designed by Larvae Labs. The team behind me, bits, CryptoPunks and Autoglyphs. Interestingly, on the edges of the work were two shapes regular and upside down L's. That struck Butter as being more than ornamental, which led him to write a script that turned the assorted L's into a message secret is in the pig numbers ll as in Larvae Labs.
00:09:00.706 - 00:09:45.970, Speaker A: From there, Botter had to deduce what the pig was leading him on a nine day scavenger hunt with a couple of friends until he realized that the message was likely referencing pig me bit NFTs wearing jerseys. After that deduction, Botter was able to take the 64 me Bits with jerseys, concatenate a hex string out of the 46 jersey numbers. And voila, he was able to claim the private key to an account with zero point 25 E and a pig me bit. Thanks so much for joining us today.
