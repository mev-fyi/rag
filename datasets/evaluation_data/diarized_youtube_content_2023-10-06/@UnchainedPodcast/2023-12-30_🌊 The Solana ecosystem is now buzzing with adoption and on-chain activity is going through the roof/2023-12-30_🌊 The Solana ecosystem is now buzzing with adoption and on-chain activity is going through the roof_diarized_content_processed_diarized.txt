00:00:00.410 - 00:00:43.122, Speaker A: Yeah, there's been a ton of new activity on Solana. There's a lot of new capital. So if you look at the bridging patterns and things like that, there's a ton of new activity coming into the space. There's a ton of super high quality projects that have been grinding basically since the middle of last year. And I think a lot what happened with all the FTX stuff that really suck for everyone, but there's a lot of teams that kind of just kept grinding and building. Feels like those teams are finally getting the recognition and adoption they deserve. I think there's a lot of people that were kind of, I think, skeptical to use Solana or that maybe they just weren't interested in bridge.
00:00:43.122 - 00:00:57.820, Speaker A: I got to go through some sex or go through a bridge and get money on here, and there's not really that much to do. I think there's certainly a lot of group chats that I'm in where people have been talking about Solana more, they've been trading more and using the applications a lot more.
