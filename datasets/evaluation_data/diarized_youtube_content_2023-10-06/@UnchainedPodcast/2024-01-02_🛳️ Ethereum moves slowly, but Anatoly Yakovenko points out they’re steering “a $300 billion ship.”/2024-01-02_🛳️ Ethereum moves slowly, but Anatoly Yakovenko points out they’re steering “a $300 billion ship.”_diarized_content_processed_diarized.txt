00:00:00.650 - 00:00:40.198, Speaker A: They're steering like a 300 billion dollar ship, right? Yeah. So anything is possible. It's just that if I was one of those engineers, I'd probably be moving even slower. The amount of risk that they're taking with every change is very large. So I think, honestly, folks way underappreciate the emerge in the amount of progress that Ethereum has made over the last few years. And things are moving, I think, in the right direction. I think design wise, Denk Sharding could totally scale to a point where we can dump all of Solana's data into it.
00:00:40.198 - 00:00:57.340, Speaker A: Now, whether the economics and the social factors around increasing stuff within Ethereum would allow for that is a totally different, different question. But I think they're on the right track. It's just really hard, man. I don't envy them in any way.
