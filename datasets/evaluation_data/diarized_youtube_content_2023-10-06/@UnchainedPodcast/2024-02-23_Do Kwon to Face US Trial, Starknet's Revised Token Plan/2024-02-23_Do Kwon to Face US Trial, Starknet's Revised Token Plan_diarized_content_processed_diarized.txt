00:00:02.410 - 00:00:45.530, Speaker A: Welcome to this week's crypto roundup. Today we delve into the Reddit IPO filing revealing bitcoin and ether investments, Starknet's response to community feedback with a revised token unlock schedule, and the legal journey of Terraform Labs co founder Doe Kwan. Additionally, we'll cover the remarkable surge of Athena's high yield Defi platform, the latest strategic moves in the NFT market, including Pudgy Peng, over board, ape, yacht Club, and more. Thanks for tuning in to the weekly news recap. This segment is written by Juana Ronovich, edited by Yuni Hong, and read by me, Meg Christensen. Let's dive right in. Terraform Labs co founder Doe Kwan is set to be extradited to the United States, where he faces serious fraud charges.
00:00:45.530 - 00:01:32.270, Speaker A: This decision, made by the High Court in Montenegro, overrules a previous request by South Korea for Kwan's extradition. The charges against Kwan are linked to substantial financial losses suffered by us investors related to the collapse of Us Terra, an algorithmic stablecoin developed by Terraform Labs. The sequence of events leading to this decision began with Kwan's arrest in March 2023 in Montenegro. He was apprehended for using a counterfeit passport while attempting to leave the country. Although Kwan initially agreed to be extradited to South Korea, the situation took a turn when a Montenegro court in June found him guilty of document forgery and sentenced him to four months in prison. Despite an appeal, Kwon lost and served his sentence. The extradition ruling follows a series of legal challenges faced by Kwan.
00:01:32.270 - 00:02:25.334, Speaker A: The US SEC has levied civil charges against him and terraform labs, accusing them of raising billions from investors through the sale of crypto asset securities, many of which were unregistered transactions. This trial, initially scheduled for January but delayed due to logistical challenges, is now set to take place. In late March, Starknet, a layer two blockchain network on Ethereum, initiated the much discussed distribution of 728,000,000 stark tokens to about 1.3 million wallets, causing its market cap to reach nearly 1.3 billion and a fully diluted valuation FDB of 18.9 billion at the time of this recording. This positioned Stark among the top ten tokens by FDB, surpassing longstanding networks like arbitrum, optimism and avalanche in valuation, though not in total value locked, however, the token's launch wasn't without controversy.
00:02:25.334 - 00:03:11.994, Speaker A: Starknet faced backlash from its community, particularly over the exclusion of active members from the airdrop due to not meeting specific wallet criteria. On Thursday, Starkware, the company behind Starknet, responded to one of the criticisms by announcing a change to the lockup schedule for tokens held by its early contributors and investors. Originally, about a third of the tokens, or about 1.3 billion of them, held by early supporters, were set to unlock on April 15. However, after quote listening to feedback end quote, Starkware has revised this plan. Now, only zero point 64% of the initially minted 10 billion tokens, or 64 million tokens, will unlock on April 15, a sharp decrease from the planned 13.4%, or 1.34
00:03:11.994 - 00:04:11.474, Speaker A: billion tokens. This gradual unlocking will continue at a rate of zero 64 monthly until March 15, 2025, shifting to 1.27 monthly for the following 24 months and ending on March 15, 2027. Under this new schedule, 580,000,000 tokens will be unlocked by the end of 2024, substantially less than the 2 billion that was previously scheduled. On last week's podcast, Starkware CEO Eli Ben Seson said that the original lockup period for Stark tokens was not misaligned with the company's goals, but was influenced by early governance and payment utility plans for the token and the popular social media platform. Reddit disclosed its investment in bitcoin and ether as part of its IPO filing. The company, which plans to go public on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker RDDT, joins a small group of corporations such as microstrategy and Tesla that holds direct digital asset investments in their treasuries.
00:04:11.474 - 00:05:03.154, Speaker A: In a landmark filing with the US SEC, Reddit disclosed not only its investment in cryptocurrencies, but also its acquisition of ether and polygon as payment for virtual goods sales. While the exact amount of tokens held remains undisclosed. The company indicated that the net carrying value of these digital assets is currently, quote, immaterial, end quote. Athena, a decentralized finance platform, has garnered attention by attracting over $350,000,000 since its public launch, offering an alluring 27.6% annual yield on its USDE stablecoins. This yield, derived from a combination of staking ether and shorting ether futures, has raised eyebrows in the crypto community. The platform operates by allowing users to deposit various stablecoins and receive USTE, which can then be staked or supplied to other DeFi platforms for additional yields.
00:05:03.154 - 00:06:11.826, Speaker A: However, skepticism surrounds the sustainability of Athena's model, particularly its reliance on high funding rates from short positions and the inherent risk involved. Critics point out the potential for a decrease in ether's funding rates, which could undermine the high yields and threaten the stability of USDE. Additionally, concerns about the impact of large scale shorts on the market and the robustness of Athena's $10 million insurance fund against negative funding rates add to the apprehension. Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, announced an immediate halt to the minting of USDC on the TRON blockchain. Circle's phase discontinuation plan includes supporting transfers of USDC to other blockchains through February 2025 for customers of Circle Mint, a tool used by institutions for minting and redeeming stablecoins. Retail holders of USDC on TROn have the option to transfer their stablecoins between blockchains or redeem them for fiat currency through various crypto exchanges and brokerages. The decision follows Circle's refutation of claims, linking it to terrorist funding and its denial of banking services to Tron founder Justin sun.
00:06:11.826 - 00:07:08.530, Speaker A: In response to allegations by the nonprofit campaign for accountability, Circle clarified in a memo to US senators Sharad Brown and Elizabeth Warren that, quote, circle does not bank Justin sun. Neither Mr. Sun nor any entity owned or controlled by Mr. Sun, including the Tron foundation or Hoibi Global, currently have accounts with Circle, end quote. This announcement also coincides with Circle's recent filing for an initial public offering in the US, reflecting its ongoing efforts to comply with regulatory standards. The recent airdrops by projects like Celestia and Starknet rewarding GitHub contributors have unintentionally spurred a new trend, airdrop farming on GitHub developers are facing an influx of low quality contributions, primarily from airdrop hunters seeking to mimic successful airdrop recipients. For instance, one Starknet contributor received 1800 tokens for a simple spell check worth about 3200 at prelaunch prices.
00:07:08.530 - 00:08:08.278, Speaker A: This phenomenon has led to over 1000 spam. Comments on the scroll GitHub repository burgeoning the development team Togorul Maharamov, a senior researcher at scroll, told DL News that spamming GitHub with trivial contributions like typo fixes is a waste of time for both the spammers and the project teams. The world token of Worldcoin has seen a significant surge this week, rising over 100%. The curious thing is that this increase appears linked not to Worldcoin's achievements, but to founder Sam Altman, also the CEO of OpenAI. The launch of OpenAI's new AI product, Sora, seems to be driving world's value, illustrating the influence of high profile individuals in the crypto market. This trend is exemplified by world's fluctuation in response to Altman's role changes at OpenAI. Despite no direct link between Worldcoin and OpenAI key beneficiaries of this rise are the liquidators of three arrows capital and FCX's bankruptcy estate.
00:08:08.278 - 00:08:48.194, Speaker A: Holding substantial amounts of worlds, their stakes gained from early investments, could potentially aid in creditor recoveries, though immediate liquidation is impossible due to vesting schedules. In a surprising twist in the NFT market, pudgy penguins floor price briefly surpassed that of the esteemed board Ape yacht Club. The Pudgy Penguins collection achieved a floor price of 22.7 e, overtaking board Ape Yacht Club's 22.15 eth. This significant growth has been observed since Luca Schnutzler became the CEO of Pudgy Penguins in April 2022, leading to strategic expansions and partnerships. In parallel, Yuga Labs, creator of board apes, announced some changes in expansions.
00:08:48.194 - 00:09:29.278, Speaker A: The company acquired proof known for the Moonbirds NFT collection, planning to integrate moonbirds into its metaverse project. Other side this acquisition marks Yugo Labs continued dominance and diversification in the NFT space. Additionally, Yuga Labs has seen a shift in leadership, with cofounder Greg Solano, known as Garga, taking over as CEO. This change follows Dan Allegri's ten month tenure. The leadership transition occurs at a time when Yuga Labs faces increased competition in the NFT market, exemplified by the brief floor price lead of pudgy penguins over the weekend. Crypto exchange fixed float was hacked, resulting in a loss of approximately 26.1 million in bitcoin and ethereum.
00:09:29.278 - 00:10:12.350, Speaker A: The breach was first indicated by unusual transaction activity on the platform, with onchain data revealing the theft of 409 bitcoin, valued at 21.1 million and 1728 ether, approximately 4.85 million. The issue surfaced on February 17, when users reported issues with transaction processing on fixed float. Initially dismissed as, quote, minor technical problems by the exchange's team, it later emerged that an exploit had occurred. While the team acknowledged the breach, they have yet to provide detailed comments on the incident. Blockchain security experts have discovered that the attacker has begun laundering the stolen funds through exchanges such as ex CX and HitBTC.
00:10:12.350 - 00:11:05.386, Speaker A: Time for fun bits Virginia's foray into the crypto world might not break the bank, as their new blockchain and cryptocurrency Commission is set to operate on a modest budget of just $17,192 a year. That's right in the land where digital currencies often spill big bucks. Virginia is counting pennies for its 2025 and 2026 crypto adventures. This budget, slightly less grandiose than their artificial intelligence Commission's $22,048 yearly allowance, will primarily cover the exhilarating world of meeting and travel expenses. It's like planning a road trip with a focus on budget motels and packed lunches. With 15 members on board, the commission is tasked with demystifying blockchain and digital assets, all while keeping an eye on the fiscal odometer. It's crypto advice with a side of budget friendly pragmatism.
00:11:05.386 - 00:11:38.146, Speaker A: Virginia's message you could explore the exciting world of cryptocurrencies without splashing the cash. And that's all. Thanks so much for joining us today.
