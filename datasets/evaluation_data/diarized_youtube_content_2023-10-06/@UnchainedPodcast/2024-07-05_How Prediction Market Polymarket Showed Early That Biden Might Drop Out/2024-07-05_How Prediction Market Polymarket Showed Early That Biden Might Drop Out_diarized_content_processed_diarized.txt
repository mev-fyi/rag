00:00:00.440 - 00:00:22.605, Speaker A: The belief in prediction markets isn't that markets are perfectly rational and always get it right, but that again, when a wide variety of people have skin in the game and you know, bet on, you know, what they believe to be true, that ends up that the price in aggregate ends up more truthful than just what you know. A few pre selected elites say.

00:01:26.755 - 00:01:28.811, Speaker A: How's it going? Laura, good to see you.
00:01:29.003 - 00:01:30.325, Speaker B: Nice to see you.
00:01:30.515 - 00:01:44.605, Speaker C: Prediction market Poly Market has had a record June attracting nearly 30,000 monthly active users and seeing over $110 million in trading volume. You are an investor. Tell us a little bit about the road to getting here.
00:01:44.985 - 00:02:40.197, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean prediction market has been a category that a lot of people have been interested in for a long time. Actually a lot of people don't know this, but in the 1916 US election there was more money bet on that election. It was Woodrow Wilson versus Charles Evans Hughes. There was more money bet on that election than there was money given to both candidates in campaign finance. And on some days there was actually more trading volume on that market than there was the entire stock market volume. So prediction markets have been around for a long time. A lot of people have been interested in for a long time, you know, dating back to, you know, to back then and more recently, you know, Intrade had a moment in the in the early 2000s and even in crypto, you know, augur five or six years ago.
00:02:40.197 - 00:03:01.025, Speaker A: So there's a long kind of history in prediction markets and it's really exciting for people like me that have believed in them For a long time because now it's really starting to happen on a mainstream level and these markets are playing a big role in kind of in important world events and it's exciting to see.
00:03:01.725 - 00:03:05.869, Speaker C: And how did you come to invest in polymarket?
00:03:06.037 - 00:04:01.221, Speaker A: We like at one confirmation, we're very much product oriented investors and we like to invest in products that we really believe in from a user perspective, kind of first and foremost. And I've long thought that prediction markets would be one of the most important products that comes out of crypto. And so, you know, in, in our first fund back in 2018, 2019, we invested in Augur and we invested in another very early stage project called Vail. They didn't really work out. And then, you know, we came across Shane in kind of 2019, 2020 and it felt like better timing. And so we, you know, we were part of the early seed round of Polymarket and have been investing ever since and working closely with Shane and kind of building the company.
00:04:01.413 - 00:04:20.135, Speaker C: Yeah, Shane Coplin. And so tell us like, you know, how it launched and what it's been like getting to this point where now we're seeing it, you know, being talked about, for instance, by the likes of Nate Silver, who's one of the most famous election pollsters.
00:04:20.295 - 00:04:38.991, Speaker A: Yeah. And I mean, I mean the favor for president. Right. Trump has been posting his Polymarket, you know, odds on Truth Social for the past, you know, six or nine months. Right. So it really is. And you know, news outlets like CNN and Bloomberg are starting to use it.
00:04:38.991 - 00:05:15.219, Speaker A: So it's really becoming an important part of the media, I think. And I really think it's just getting started. I think people aren't using it enough. But yeah, there's certainly been a lot of ups and downs, you know, at Polymarket, I mean, around 2019, 2020, there was some success around the election. After that, you know, there were some issues with the cftc. You know, the CFTC actually fined Polymarket and we had to block US consumers from using the platform. And that's still the case today.
00:05:15.219 - 00:05:55.255, Speaker A: We can kind of talk about the regulation and where that might be going. And then there was kind of a lull. I think a lot of people maybe gave up on Poly Market and maybe even the idea of prediction markets overall. But what we've seen in crypto is like the founders with the deepest long term conviction end up surviving the ups and downs and winning the biggest. And so I think all the credit is really to Shane and the team at polymarket because they persisted through kind of ups Downs lulls and are really thriving now.
00:05:55.955 - 00:06:12.047, Speaker C: And so now that you're seeing that it has pretty substantial activity. Have you been noticing anything specific about how the prediction market interacts with the news? I just imagine you've been watching every little tick up and tick down.
00:06:12.151 - 00:06:58.241, Speaker A: Oh, for sure. I think the, you know, there's probably people listening that don't even know what a prediction market is. And it's really a exchange based market that trades 24,7 on any type of outcome, any, any world event. And to make it concrete, I mean, I think that one of the most interesting markets to talk about right now is will Joe Biden drop out of the 2024 election? Right. And if you look at the history on that market, you can go to Polymarket and look at that market and back in October 2023 timeframe, look at what the media was writing about Joe Biden. There's headlines. Joe Biden knows what he's doing.
00:06:58.241 - 00:07:41.105, Speaker A: Joe Biden is as sharp as ever. These are New York Times, cnn, whatever, headlines. If you look at the market, even back then there was about 25% chance that the market was saying that Joe Biden would drop out of this election. And so the reason, I think a lot of people, you know, see prediction markets as just gambling or you know, something like that. But my excitement about prediction markets is not at all, you know, the gambling side of it, but it's, it's the ability that they have to bring more truth to the world. And you have a lot of narratives right now out there, right? And it's hard to, for people to know what is true. You have kind of corporate media narratives.
00:07:41.105 - 00:08:48.119, Speaker A: You also have social media narratives. And you know, the X algorithm doesn't do people any favors and it often kind of, you know, it showcases what's popular rather than what's true. Right? So, you know, this, will Joe Biden drop out in 2024? Again, I think is a great example because if you look back then, what the media was saying, what most people were saying and what the odds were like, you know, the average person would look at that, you know, 25% and say, ah, that, that's, that's stupid. The market is irrational, doesn't know, you know, people, it's, it's just crypto bros. But that actually was closer to the truth than what the mainstream was writing, right? And then, you know, fast forward to the, the debate last week and in real time when Biden was, you know, on air debating the, the odds will he drop out actually doubled. So it was like happening faster than the media was talking about or anything like that. And it became that time that like the, the poly market odds.
00:08:48.119 - 00:09:39.959, Speaker A: And you know, one thing about prediction markets too is that liquidity is important, right? If it's just a few people trading and there's no liquidity, the market price doesn't mean much. But if you start having lots of different people with different perspectives putting skin in the game and you start seeing real volume, that means more. And so now this will Joe Biden dropout market has over $10 million in volume and there's now a much greater than 50% chance that it's happening. And that's what the market says. And you have some of the biggest people from the Democratic Party like Gavin Newsom on Twitter, yester and Whitmer saying Biden is our candidate. They're still saying this. The market clearly doesn't believe them anymore.
00:09:39.959 - 00:10:19.765, Speaker A: And that's kind of interesting in itself. And we'll see what happens. You know, a lot of people also about prediction markets say, well, you know, they get it wrong all the time. And if Biden ends up running, people will say, oh, you know, the market got it wrong. The belief in prediction markets isn't that markets are perfectly rational and always get it right, but that again, when a wide variety of people have skin in the game and bet on, you know, what they believe to be true, that ends up that the price in aggregate ends up more truthful than just what, you know, a few pre selected elites say, yeah, yeah.
00:10:19.925 - 00:11:23.717, Speaker C: There's an episode of the chopping block that I think is coming out today, the day we're recording, which is Thursday, and I was on it and we discussed all this and we were saying that especially in the period before the mainstream media reports on something, then they can be more accurate. And I talked about how there's a certain bar to publish that can make it hard for, for a journalist to break something if like the people that are close to that situation do not want that to be public. But then we were saying that once it became public then, now we're seeing this interplay where events that are being reported by the mainstream media are affecting the prediction markets. But I do think you know your point about how like Gavin Newsom and Gretchen Whitmer, etcetera, Were saying they were behind Biden. But you might have seen also the New York Times did report a couple of close allies to Biden, had conversations with him where he did express that he knew that he had to prove himself within some short period, otherwise it was over. For him. So yeah, I think, yeah, now there's more of an interplay.
00:11:23.717 - 00:11:37.685, Speaker C: But you're right in that period before the the prediction markets were more spot on. So in a moment we're going to talk more about some of the different events that have happened on polymarket. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible.

00:12:53.505 - 00:13:35.121, Speaker C: So I did want to also ask just generally about like the process for creating a prediction market on Poly Market because we have seen that there are some, you know, conflicts that have happened around resolving these prediction markets. Two of the more notable ones were the spot Ether ETF approvals where the definition of what approval meant or when you know, the actual approval happened came into question. And then the other was around the DJT meme token and whether or not Baron Trump was involved. So can you talk about, yeah, just kind of how that whole thing works and then what you learned maybe from those two events?
00:13:35.273 - 00:14:26.215, Speaker A: Yeah, good question. So I mean there's two parts of it, right? There's the market creation and right now Poly Market is, you know, curating markets. I think there may be a world in the future where you have user generated markets and someone like, you know, a podcaster like you could actually create your own markets and potentially earn fees from those markets on markets that your users care about. But right now it's largely just, you know, in the prediction market space broadly and Poly Market specifically. It's, you know, the platforms are kind of creating the markets. So that's one side of it. And then I think that the side you're alluding to, which is an important piece and I would say it's still, you know, not perfect and being ironed out is the market resolution side.
00:14:26.215 - 00:15:12.765, Speaker A: So, you know, on something like will Joe Biden drop out? The result is pretty clear, right. I don't think there's going to be gray area around something like that. But how these markets are written really matters. Right. And that's where, you know, the market creation side is important because, you know, when you, when you see a market, there's the, you know, the headline question, but then there's the, there's the details in the question that really specify, you know, what determines yes, what determines no. And those, you know, specifications are written. But then for Polymarket right now there's a decentralized oracle that actually effectively votes on the outcome.
00:15:12.765 - 00:16:37.183, Speaker A: And it's up to this kind of decentralized oracle to determine what they believe to be true or false. And the most, I guess notable recent one is that you mentioned is, was Baron involved in djt? And that was a controversial one, right, because you have Martin Shkreli, you know, doing hour long Twitter spaces, you know, giving his, his details. And he's still, he's probably going to do one today. He's still chirping about, you know, about Barron's involvement. And so you have really his account and you know, some other journalists that are probably chasing clout that are saying, you know, one thing and, but you don't have anything from Baron, you don't have anything from really, you know, any sources behind those two. And again, the terminology matters. So how did they determine in the wording of that market whether he was involved or not? I think that the term was, is there a preponderance of evidence? And so then it's up to this decentralized Oracle to evaluate whether there's, you know, a lot of evidence or not.
00:16:37.183 - 00:17:33.376, Speaker A: And that was one where actually the decentralized Oracle, you know, it's a token based project that called uma, decided that he wasn't involved, there wasn't enough evidence and Polymarket actually disagreed with that. So they ended up refunding everyone that, that bet. Yes, because they determined that there was enough evidence from Shkreli. And so it's an interpretation of the wording in that case. And yeah, I think, as I said, I think it's still being figured out like what's the best way. I think some people dismiss prediction markets because of events like this, which I think is foolish Because I think this stuff is still being ironed out. And you, you know, I tend to believe that, you know, largely it should be, the decision should be in the spirit of the market.
00:17:33.376 - 00:17:42.984, Speaker A: So there shouldn't be like gotchas that, you know, that the people, you know, are getting duped on effectively.
00:17:43.144 - 00:17:58.985, Speaker C: And by that you're referring to the spot ether ETF1 where the initial sign that there was an approval you feel should have been the determinant factor, not the later like bureaucratic thing of like the official right.
00:17:59.405 - 00:19:01.027, Speaker A: When you have the media reporting the ETF was approved and you know, by all accounts the ETF was approved, but there's some like very minor nuance that it's not, you know, actually approved until a bit later. You know, things like that. I think it's in the interest of prediction markets and the growth of prediction markets broadly to decide in favor of the spirit of the market. Because if people are getting duped on minor things like this, they're not going to want to go back to prediction markets. And we actually saw that there was one market in particular back in Augur days that the decentralized Oracle actually decided against the spirit of the market. And you know, there was probably a lot of reasons why, you know, it just wasn't the right time for Augur. But I think that, you know, things like that may have played a small role in it.
00:19:01.171 - 00:19:15.455, Speaker C: And then so just to make clear, so when somebody sets up a market, it's their own phrasing that the, that determines like how it's decided or does anybody help them to like make sure that the wording is such that it can be easily decided?
00:19:15.795 - 00:19:58.175, Speaker A: Well, in the case of Polymarket, again to be specific, right now polymarket is creating their own markets and they have like people that are, you know, focused on the wording. And again, I think they probably, you know, that could still be improved. So you know, polymarket is creating the market and you know, and writing the, you know, what determines the market. But then it's a separate body that is interpreting the wording of the markets. Right. So it's kind of a two, you could think of it as a two kind of party system currently where you have the, the market creator and then the, you know, a separate decentralized Oracle.
00:19:58.835 - 00:20:36.875, Speaker C: Okay. And in the case of something where it's kind of like a moving target, where for instance, like this question of who could replace Biden if he steps down, I noticed that the prediction market, it has, you know, obviously like Kamala, but then it's like Other, including Whitmer. But there were so many people that could fall in that bucket. Like, I hear a lot of people talking about, like, Pete Buttigieg or the governor of Pennsylvania, something Shapiro. I forgot his first name. But they're not on there. But then, like, people like Gavin Newsom, who I feel like I heard a lot about initially, and then I'm hearing less about now, they're still on there.
00:20:36.875 - 00:20:50.015, Speaker C: So, like, in this kind of situation where it's, like, fluid, is it just whatever is the beginning, you know, slate of options just remains, or is there a way to, like, update it as, you know, more information comes to light?
00:20:50.475 - 00:21:24.321, Speaker A: I think it could be updated with a new market, and I think it has been. Like, for example, Burgum I don't think was in really, no one was talking about him initially for as. As, you know, a VP candidate. And like, on that initial market, he wasn't on there. But then you just add a new market for, you know, a new candidate. So it can kind of fragment liquidity on certain markets. But that.
00:21:24.321 - 00:21:26.321, Speaker A: That's generally how it works.
00:21:26.473 - 00:21:27.245, Speaker C: Okay.
00:21:27.565 - 00:21:56.537, Speaker A: I think. I'm honestly not 100% positive on that, but I think that's true. But these markets typically have other OG market, if you will, so that kind of captures someone that's not on it initially. And then if a new candidate fast emerges, that becomes. And if a favorite, then, you know, you'll create a new market for it.
00:21:56.681 - 00:22:09.285, Speaker C: Okay. And you kind of mentioned earlier that, like, at lower trading volumes, the markets maybe are, like, a little less reliable. Is there a certain threshold that you like to use to delineate when, you know, you feel like a market's more credible?
00:22:09.785 - 00:22:45.781, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a good question. Not really. I think it really depends on what, you know, the event is and, you know, and how much volume there is. I wouldn't say there's like a blanket over a million dollars is definitely kind of more truthful. I just think in general, the more volume on a market, the more kind of truthful you can interpret it as. But if you look on polymarket right now, I mean, like, there's some, like, pop culture type markets that let's. Let's pull one up.
00:22:45.781 - 00:22:51.859, Speaker A: Okay. Will Trump say MOG in 2024, which.
00:22:51.867 - 00:22:54.147, Speaker C: Is a meme coin for those of you who don't know?
00:22:54.251 - 00:23:27.859, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. And the market says there's a 15% chance, but there's only $20,000 worth of volume and very low liquidity. So if you bet. Yes. And you put, you know, $1,000 on that it's going to move the market a lot. So, you know, something like that, you know, you put less weight on. Then again, the, there's over 200 million on the presidential election winner now with Trump at 64% and Kamala number two at 13%.
00:23:27.859 - 00:23:38.495, Speaker A: So, you know, those are two extreme examples. And I think there's, in between, there's, there's gray area and you kind of have to use your own judgment.
00:23:38.995 - 00:24:04.753, Speaker C: All right, well, last thing I wanted to mention is you talked about how the CFTC had this fine. And you know, as you mentioned, historically the US has had prediction markets, but obviously we don't now. So, you know, what do you, what, so what happened at that time to eliminate them from the US but what prospects do you see for prediction markets going Forward in the U.S. yes.
00:24:04.809 - 00:25:09.887, Speaker A: So this is something I haven't seen many people talk about, but I think it's, it's pretty interesting. I mean, again, I mentioned in the early kind of 1900s in the US there was a deep desire for the American people to bet on politics. And then regulators came along and didn't allow it anymore. And if you ask, and so now specifically, it's the CFTC that is basically able to deem some markets legal and other markets illegal. And if you ask why, you know, there's maybe different reasons why, but, you know, a common answer you hear is, well, you don't want money and politics too closely aligned, right? You don't want them to intersect too much. And that's pretty funny actually, right? Because we all know how much money and politics actually matter. It's like, but it's corporate money, it's the money of elites.
00:25:09.887 - 00:27:01.563, Speaker A: And I think what that really means is we don't want people's money, you know, the little guy's money and politics to too closely come together. So that's, you know, my personal view. Aside from that, if you look at what's happening with the administrative state in this country in the past couple of weeks, right, Like Chevron deference being overturned last week, that's a big deal, right? Because the courts are saying, you know, it's no, we're no longer going to defer to the regulators on what's legal and illegal. And this has big implications for prediction markets, political prediction markets in particular, right? Because again, what's happening right now is the CFTC is deeming some markets illegal and some markets illegal. And I'm not a lawyer, of course, and I'm kind of talking based on, you know, discussions I've had with different lawyers and there's smart lawyers that think that if this goes to the Supreme Court, you know, this could actually be overturned and, you know, and political markets could actually be deemed legal and free for Americans to participate in. And there's actually a non crypto prediction market, Kalshi, that is suing the CFTC on this issue. So certainly if you look at, like, how, you know, gambling has opened up in the US over the past, you know, five years, and you look at the direction that hopefully the administrative state is going where there's less of these kind of unelected bureaucrats who are, you know, making decisions that might be in their own interests and against the interests of the people.
00:27:01.563 - 00:27:11.435, Speaker A: I think there's a lot of signs that at some point prediction markets are going to open up in the US but we'll see.
00:27:12.295 - 00:27:36.635, Speaker C: Yeah, I agree that there's it just the fact that this is being cited so much, I feel like is also a positive sign. And for listeners who are interested in hearing about how the elimination of Chevron deference affects crypto, I have an episode coming out about that on Tuesday, so you guys should tune into that. But Nick, this has been super, super helpful and super interesting. Thank you so much for coming on Unchained.
