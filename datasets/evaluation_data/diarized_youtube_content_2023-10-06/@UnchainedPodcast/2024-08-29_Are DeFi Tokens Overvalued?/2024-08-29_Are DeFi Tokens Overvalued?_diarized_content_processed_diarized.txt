00:00:00.200 - 00:00:53.535, Speaker A: I took a look recently at Blue Chip Defi, which is aave, Lido, Uniswap and Maker. And of, of them, of each one of their categories, they have, you know, 60 to 80% of the market at least in EVM crypto space, which is huge by the way. It's, it's insane that single companies have, or projects have that level of market share. And like, look, if you look at these businesses holding valuation aside, they're, they're amazing assets in the sense that they have zero marginal cost, like a software business. They are software. They have zero need for additional capital to scale, they clearly have some degree of network effects and you know, the ability to maintain a huge market share. So those are a lot of things that are like really interesting when you're analyzing an investment opportunity.
00:00:53.535 - 00:01:44.849, Speaker A: The issue with them though is their revenue volatility because their revenue is tied directly to TVL and TVL is basically perfectly one correlated to ETH, which is, you know, a 100 volume plus asset. And so then you look at that and say, okay, well it's almost a SaaS business. And so maybe it should have like a SaaS like multiple. But the reality is it's not because it trades with crypto. And so then, you know, right now, to get to the punchline, these things are all trading at like high 20s. PE ratios when you assume earnings are basically the revenue that the protocol makes minus their expenses that they're reporting, which, you know, you could argue that it's really funded by the treasury and it's not really. But anyway, the point is high 20s.
00:01:44.849 - 00:02:30.195, Speaker A: Earlier we talked about the NASDAQ. The NASDAQ average company is in 33 times. So if you were to compare the two, I would say I'd rather own Magnificent Seven at 33 times than DeFi at high 20s and have 100% volatility in my revenue. So I think that DEFI still today is overvalued from that perspective. Now I can make the argument why I'd like to own this at high 20s. I think if you think that stable coins are going to 200, 300 billion and so is TVL and you're going to see basically their revenue increase in lockstep with that. Okay, then maybe you're buying in at something like more like a high single digit PE ratio and in that case that's appealing.
00:02:30.195 - 00:02:34.595, Speaker A: But then what I would say to you is why wouldn't you just buy Ether Soul in that case?
