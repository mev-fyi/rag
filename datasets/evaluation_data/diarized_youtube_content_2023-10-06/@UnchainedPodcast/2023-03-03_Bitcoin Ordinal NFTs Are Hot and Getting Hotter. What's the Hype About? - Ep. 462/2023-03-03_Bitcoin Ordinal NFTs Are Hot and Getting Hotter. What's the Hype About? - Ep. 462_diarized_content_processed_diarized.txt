00:01:16.814 - 00:01:18.040, Speaker A: Great to be here.
00:01:18.970 - 00:01:20.440, Speaker C: Nice to have you back.
00:01:20.890 - 00:01:53.362, Speaker B: So the last couple of months, NFTs and bitcoin, aka bitcoin ordinals, have really taken off and they're consuming large amounts of block space. For instance, up to 70% at times. There's been more than a quarter million created and they've been the source of $1.4 million in fees on the bitcoin blockchain. They've even stirred some controversy. But first, before we dive into all that, let's make sure everybody listening just is on the same page. What are ordinals and how do they work?
00:01:53.496 - 00:02:46.494, Speaker A: Yeah, so I think NFTs on bitcoin are not something new. Actually, NFTs started on the bitcoin blockchain with the counterparty back in 2015 era or so. The more popular series that came out at that time was the Rare Pepes. I think people might be more familiar with the Rare Pepes than counterparty, the protocol through which they were minted. And so I think in many ways what we have seen is that since the launch of Ethereum, really, when Ethereum started taking off in 2017, and then other chains that came around, a lot of the activity around DFI or NFDS sort of like, shifted to Ethereum and other chains. And I think bitcoin because it's sort of like, very simple at the base layer and it's optimized for just being money. We haven't seen a lot of these use cases on the bitcoin blockchain.
00:02:46.494 - 00:03:05.026, Speaker A: That doesn't mean they're not possible. They're entirely possible. And Ordinal has sort of, like, revived the interest in bitcoin NFT. So I sort of look at them as in a wake, kind of like counterparty 2.0. Right. Like, there has been a big gap in the middle. And Ordinal theory itself is very, very fascinating.
00:03:05.026 - 00:03:51.890, Speaker A: What it sort of says is that usually we think of bitcoin and also the smallest unit of bitcoin called the satoshi as fungible. So it doesn't matter which bitcoin you have or which satoshi you have. So the ordinal theory gives a new lens to how you look at the blockchain data. And you can actually sort these satoshis in a sequence. And the idea is that some of them might be more rare than others. Like, for example, what if a satoshi that came out right after a halving block? Halving happens only every four years, so it might have a special meaning to somebody and it is different from other satoshis. So once you can start sequencing or sort of like separating satoshis from each other, that's one part of the ordinal theory.
00:03:51.890 - 00:04:27.346, Speaker A: And the second part is that you can use them. So now you are saying, like, hey, this satoshi is unique. I can use that to inscribe something on the blockchain. And inscribing is basically putting some data on the chain and you own that data through the ownership of the satoshi. And that's how people basically the first obvious thing people try inscribing are the usual NFTs, the monkey pictures, the other fun stuff that you all love out there. And seeing that on the bitcoin blockchain has sort of like has revived the interest in building on bitcoin in a major way.
00:04:27.528 - 00:04:55.980, Speaker B: Yeah, one thing that fascinated me was that in order to create these, essentially the protocol puts a serial number on every satoshi, which is just kind of a remarkable and a really fascinating idea. So can you just talk a little bit about that and how that works? Because obviously I think people have a certain conception of how NFTs should work from ethereum, but on bitcoin, it's very different.
00:04:56.590 - 00:05:39.334, Speaker A: Yes. So I think digging a little bit deeper into how the bitcoin blockchain works versus ethereum, they're very different models. Bitcoin uses this UTXO model where effectively, how you prove to somebody that you have bitcoin is that there's a sequence of transactions where you receive these unspent outputs. And so there's a log of exactly what UTXO was, going from one address to the other. In ethereum, it's an account based model, so your account basically gets credited. So there's no tracking of actual unique ETH happening as a log in the chain. Right.
00:05:39.334 - 00:06:12.226, Speaker A: So these are different models. And people would argue that in many ways the account model is more efficient, like it's easier to program with smart contracts and so on. But the UTXO model has this unique feature that you can actually track even individual satoshis all the way back to their genesis. And I think I really like the analogy you use that it's like putting a sequence number. If you look at even backnotes, they do have a sequence number on it. Even though people think of dollars as fungible. I don't care about a particular $5 bill, but there might be certain bills that have some meaning to you.
00:06:12.226 - 00:06:57.634, Speaker A: Maybe the first ever $20 bill you got at your internship and you still have it saved or framed in your house. I think a similar thing is happening with Ordinal theory, that it's giving these sequence numbers, the serial numbers to Satoshis, and you can come up with your own serial numbers if you want. Right. Like this ordinal theory is like one view or one lens on it. But because I think it's like social consensus, if enough people start following this particular version of looking at the serial numbers, then that becomes the dominant format. And right now, just given the interest level and amount of builders kind of coming in and building all sorts of services and wallet support for Ordinals, it seems like this is the one that might actually take off.
00:06:57.752 - 00:06:58.034, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:06:58.072 - 00:07:39.294, Speaker B: And just for listeners who don't know UTXO, it's unspent transaction output. And one other thing that I found fascinating is that these NFTs, in a way sort of like work the way that a lot of people who don't know the technicals of NFTs think they should work. Meaning that the actual quote unquote underlying image or whatever the NFT is based on is actually placed on the bitcoin blockchain. Whereas in ethereum there's like an external pointer to the location elsewhere and that can cause a whole host of issues. So how is it that the bitcoin blockchain is able to host all this data?
00:07:39.492 - 00:08:11.038, Speaker A: Yes, and I think that's actually a big difference and a huge selling point for a lot of artists. Right. Imagine that you're people and you're creating something really unique, and on bitcoin, you can literally store the image on the bitcoin blockchain. And now it's almost like indestructible, right. You know that as long as bitcoin is around, this thing is going to be around. And I think that's very powerful. That thing instantly clicks with a lot of people that bitcoin's block space is precious, it's very durable.
00:08:11.038 - 00:08:36.958, Speaker A: As soon as you put something out there, it's probably the most indestructible media on the planet, in a way. Right. And I think that is attracting a lot of people to this. And this is a big difference in terms of technically how this works. So bitcoin has basically had two upgrades in the last five plus years. Bitcoin usually have a very careful, slow approach to doing any upgrades. The first one was Segregate and the most recent one is Taproot.
00:08:36.958 - 00:09:10.326, Speaker A: And they're both sort of like, aimed at making more efficient use of the bitcoin block space. Right. So think of them as like, they compress the transaction data a lot and they make more efficient use of the blockchain. Taproot has some other aspects as well, like, it makes certain you can write a little bit more advanced scripts. It's nowhere close to having a full execution environment. Like most devs are used to in Ethereum or Solana and so on, but you can write a little bit more advanced scripts using taproot. That data is like off chain usually until you reveal it and then that's good for privacy.
00:09:10.326 - 00:09:55.580, Speaker A: And Ordinals are sort of like a byproduct of Taproot in a way that they are using the Taproot transaction format and addresses to basically put more data on chain. So it's a very clever use of Taproot. And the interesting thing is that Taproot went live like last year and frankly, nobody was using it. If you look at Taproot's adoption, it was like less than 1% on the network. And suddenly with Ordinals, as soon as people wanted to use these NFTs and wanted to inscribe them, the Taproot adoption actually exploded on the network and there was so much demand. Like users are asking for support from Wallets, they're asking for support for all of these things. And we actually started seeing Wallets integrating Taproot because now there's real kind of like user demand out there.
00:09:55.950 - 00:09:57.100, Speaker C: I love it.
00:09:57.550 - 00:10:17.860, Speaker B: One thing also though, that anybody who's interested in buying these should know is that because of what you mentioned about how Bitcoin has this different model and it's not this accountant model, you have to be very careful about how you store your Bitcoin ordinals because explain what could happen if you're not.
00:10:18.230 - 00:11:10.014, Speaker A: Yes, so the way to think about this is satoshi is the smallest unit of a Bitcoin, but it's actually very small, right? Like there are a hundred million Satoshis in a bitcoin. And usually what wallets do is that when you're forming a transaction, they will just combine Satoshis from various UTXOs and some of them might be used to pay minor fees, some of them might go to a change address or so on. Like wallets don't really care which Satoshi you're using. But now let's say you have a valuable NFT that is owned by a single Satoshi. You want to be careful that that one is not the one that the wallet just sends as mining fee for a transaction. So these wallets are not really designed with this use case in mind, but they're already new wallets. So two examples, one is Xworce and the other is the Hero wallet.
00:11:10.014 - 00:11:30.822, Speaker A: They're web wallets. Xwarse has a mobile app as well and they are actually explicitly designed for ordinals and they make sure that you are not going to spend that precious Satoshi that had the NFT on it and they treat it like you would expect it to be treated great.
00:11:30.956 - 00:11:32.138, Speaker C: So in a moment we're going to.
00:11:32.144 - 00:12:02.846, Speaker B: Talk about some of the reaction to all this activity on Bitcoin. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible.

Visit railgun.org or use the Railway app at railway XYZ to find out more. Back to my conversation with MANEB. So, interestingly, at first when all this activity around Ordinals started happening, some bitcoin maximalists were criticizing it, saying that miners should censor the crap, referring to Ordinals, some people even called Ordinals an attack on bitcoin. Why do you think that some parts of the bitcoin community saw Ordinals that way?
00:12:43.860 - 00:13:10.194, Speaker A: Yeah, so that is not surprising to me at all. Right. Basically the way I look at the bitcoin culture is that when I started in 2013 till around 2016 or so, I think the culture was actually much more open. There were more intellectually curious people around, there were more builders around, there were experiments happening. I was building protocols directly on bitcoin. L one back in the day, and that's where counterparty started. NFTs started on bitcoin.
00:13:10.194 - 00:13:34.126, Speaker A: Even early ICOs happened using colored coins. This is all like pre Ethereum stuff. And I think 2017 is a very remarkable year in the history of our industry. A couple of things happened. One was the Civil War internally with bitcoin, the block size wars. And over there, the argument was that, hey, block size is very precious. Only use it for money.
00:13:34.126 - 00:14:26.558, Speaker A: Keep the block size small because it's good for decentralization, which I actually agree with, right? Like you should keep the block size small. And a lot of the builders sort of went to Ethereum, not only because it was easier to program there, it had a full execution environment, a full programming language, but also the culture. It embraces experimentation, it sort of encourages it and so on. So for the last four or five years, the shift in bitcoin community has been that a lot of actually non technical people, very few of them are technical, they're mostly know Twitter influencers or podcasters who don't really understand technology that well, don't really even use bitcoin. Their voices became more magnified in the bitcoin community and they're usually sort of like naysayers, right? Like they're saying all of these use cases don't make any sense. Money is the only use case. So by default, I think their reaction to anything new is sort of like rejected.
00:14:26.558 - 00:14:58.346, Speaker A: And I think bitcoin has still there is a smaller camp, but it's growing a lot. And that's the camp of bitcoin builders. And they're very different. They actually use bitcoin. They treat it as an open source project and a technology, not a religion. And those folks are always kind of like much more forward thinking, excited about any experimentation and use and so on. So I think one really interesting thing that's happening is that the maximalist religious camp obviously came out and was opposed to this use.
00:14:58.346 - 00:15:57.726, Speaker A: But if you look at the arguments, they sort of don't make sense because over here, Arnels are resulting in higher fee markets, which is good for bitcoin mining. It's actually really good for long term security of bitcoin. One of the biggest criticisms is in the next ten to 15 years, when the coinbase rewards the newly minted bitcoin, it goes down a lot. What's going to happen to the bitcoin security? And this is the first real data point where we have seen a sustainable sort of a use case that is actually giving more revenue to miners. And if this takes off, or there are better trading markets that start taking off, other use cases that start taking off, then you have a more clear shot at sustaining the type of fee market that, let's say, ethereum has, which can be enough to sustain the security budget of bitcoin. In some ways, arnold's are not just interesting from a technology perspective, but even from bitcoin culture perspective, the spotlight has actually shifted to the builders community. Their twitter spaces are getting a larger audience, right.
00:15:57.726 - 00:16:05.246, Speaker A: They're having more of a say in the bitcoin community. And I think that's a very healthy change, generally, in bitcoin.
00:16:05.438 - 00:16:05.842, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:16:05.896 - 00:16:50.926, Speaker B: And I would say that this is also almost like the next development. After over the last maybe like eight or nine months, there's started to be a lot of pushback against the maxis. And I've covered this on the show, I think, twice. Once with Eric wall and udi Wertheimer, once with udi and Lynn alden, and then also there was a discussion about bitcoin security between Eric wall and Justin bonds. So people should check those out because it's definitely been a developing story for quite a while. And I feel like for a while, the maxis were very dominant and people were unwilling to speak out against them. And then after a while, suddenly growing numbers of people were willing to speak out against them.
00:16:50.926 - 00:17:00.210, Speaker B: And now suddenly, again, we're seeing, like you said, more creativity and sort of more kind of tech oriented people coming back to bitcoin.
00:17:00.630 - 00:17:52.082, Speaker A: Yeah, I think two quick things about that. So, one, I completely agree that I think more people are speaking out and there's strength in numbers. So as soon as there is an alternate community that has a voice and that has more influence, more people feel comfortable. So the silent sort of majority, that was sort of like letting these people do their thing. Now they have a place that they can sort of belong to and be like, yeah, no, I actually agree with your views versus so I think that alternate camp that I'm calling bitcoin builders or bitcoin rationalists, whatever name you want to give them, it's actually growing. And I think the second really important point is that bitcoin is very hard to change. And whenever somebody comes, like, for example, one of the bitcoin CodeVS, jeremy Rubin, who was working on some new features for bitcoin l one.
00:17:52.082 - 00:18:20.746, Speaker A: And over there, if there's strong opposition, it's actually a problem because then it looks like there isn't enough support for this proposal to go through. Ordinals are different. They're using something that's already live. Right. So even if people are making noise, it makes actually no difference because this thing is already live on the chain. It's already part of consensus, and there's no way they can revert that change. So I think the dynamics were actually very different this time around.
00:18:20.746 - 00:18:35.474, Speaker A: If this was just a proposal and a lot of maxis were making noise and trying to push back, I do think that they would have had some influence on it. But this was just a completely different thing where Taproot was already live and they just couldn't do anything. Yeah.
00:18:35.512 - 00:19:03.238, Speaker B: And I should add, actually, that the creator is somebody named Casey Rotimore, and he even tweeted make bitcoin fun again. In all, you know, it just goes to show, like we were saying, it's kind of drawing more of the tech type people. The price of Stacks has jumped in the last couple of weeks, and obviously that's your project, and it appears to be due to this interest in Ordinals. So can you explain how it is that stacks could be affected by Ordinals?
00:19:03.334 - 00:19:25.530, Speaker A: Yeah, so I think a quick kind of like, clarification there. Stacks is a very decentralized ecosystem. So it's a bitcoin layer started in 2017. I'm a co creator of it. The main net went live in early 2021. But we have been extremely careful about both. From how the token offering was conducted, it was the first ever SEC qualified offering.
00:19:25.530 - 00:20:13.994, Speaker A: And then the flip side of that is that we have been extremely careful about decentralization. So it's a little bit like the original company that was doing the R D was dismantled and people went off and did kind of like their own thing. So this thing has a life of its own. I usually don't pay that much attention to the markets, but I have a theory about why the project might be getting more attention. And I think it's basically, if you look at a bitcoin layer that is bringing more smart contracts, full execution environments, it was attracting a bunch of intellectually curious people who wanted to build around bitcoin and experiment with things. But the bitcoin L One chain actually doesn't have that much usage at all, right? Blocks were empty. So it was a little bit like this was a nice to have, like, hey, here's a bitcoin layer.
00:20:13.994 - 00:20:53.354, Speaker A: Some people think of it as an L Two, although they're technical definitions that I don't want to get into right now. So it was a little bit like, okay, it's nice to have. If I want to experiment with bitcoin, I can play with a bitcoin layer. But suddenly, if the bitcoin block space is getting full and transaction fees are going up and there's no path to scalability, suddenly the L Two S, or side chains, become much more relevant. They suddenly become more like a medicine to a pain point that people have versus just a nice to have thing that developers are sort of like playing around. That's sort of like my view. My theory on why people would be more interested in it right now.
00:20:53.354 - 00:21:36.518, Speaker A: And then even if you look at ethereum, the l two market is pretty mature there, right? Like 40, $50 billion, depending on how you measure it. 25 billion might be public already, the rest might be private. And on the bitcoin side, it's basically nothing much, right? Like Stacks is one of the very few projects that is building a bitcoin layer. And I think people can sort of see that if ethereum is going to scale in layers, like we all know it's going to be roll ups or fraud proofs, like most of the user activity is actually going to happen in l two s, so the same can be applied to bitcoin as well. That bitcoin has $500 billion in capital mostly just sitting there. So it's a little bit of a more of a blue ocean in my view, where there aren't a lot of layers, there is a lot of capital. That's just sitting passively.
00:21:36.518 - 00:21:55.850, Speaker A: I think, ordinals the one thing that Ardenls have done is that they've given people a real data point that, look, there can be user interest and developer interest and investor interest directly in building on bitcoin. And I think that data point was very, very important for people to feel confident that, okay, I want to spend my time and effort building in the bitcoin ecosystem.
00:21:56.010 - 00:22:14.034, Speaker B: And one other sign that people are definitely going to be very interested in all of this is that Yuka labs is now going to be launching a new NFT collection on Ordinals called Twelvefold. Any reaction to kind of the biggest NFT company choosing to experiment with Ordinals?
00:22:14.162 - 00:22:48.130, Speaker A: No, it's great. And I don't think they'll be the only ones. Right? I think D gods from one of the top projects from Solana, they already came to Ordinals. Yuga labs made the announcement. I think they're mint, maybe went live already. And I think others are coming right to me, it's a no brainer because just given the limited space on bitcoin and the property that whatever you publish there is indestructible, there's literally the NFDS on chain. Other chains don't have that, and other chains also don't carry that premium that the bitcoin blockchain does.
00:22:48.130 - 00:23:26.554, Speaker A: Everybody knows that bitcoin has the highest chance of survival. Like they will be here 20 years from now or 30 years from now. So if you're putting your NFD right there, you think it's precious, that makes a lot of sense. And so my theory is that we might see a world where a lot of the high value or, quote unquote, luxury NFTs might actually end up on bitcoin. And then the long tail might be on other chains, might be on bitcoin layers, right? So these layers can work very seamlessly with bitcoin, you can even do trading between these two, and we are seeing some of that already. So there's a marketplace called Gamma. It was operating on the stacks layer and they very quickly integrated Ardnals.
00:23:26.554 - 00:23:41.742, Speaker A: But for a user, it's a very seamless switch. That okay. Right now I'm looking at a bitcoin L. One NFT. Now I'm looking at a bitcoin layer NFT. And I understand that maybe at the layer the gas fees are lower. There can be larger mints, like 10,000, 20,000 mints.
00:23:41.742 - 00:23:50.230, Speaker A: But on the L one it's more limited. Maybe things are more pricey just because the limited block space on bitcoin.
00:23:50.730 - 00:24:09.782, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree for kind of the cool factor. I think the NFTs on bitcoin will be very valuable. All right, well, this has been such a fascinating discussion. There's probably so much more we could have gone into, but we'll have to save that for another time. Manef, thank you so much. It was great to have you back. And yeah, thanks for coming on Unchained.
00:24:09.846 - 00:24:12.474, Speaker A: Great. No, always great to talk to you.

00:24:48.170 - 00:25:38.338, Speaker C: Thanks for tuning into this week's news recap. Silvergate misses Ten K 2022 Report On Wednesday, cryptocurrency friendly bank Silvergate announced it would delay the filing of its annual report. It said that it is reviewing its financial controls and viability following the collapse of FTX. Silvergate confirmed that it sold additional debt securities in January and February, and that losses related to its securities portfolio, among other factors, could impair its ability to operate as a going concern. The fact that Silvergate has been so intertwined with crypto companies has raised concerns among the crypto community. Adam Cochrane, partner at Cinempane Ventures Tweeted Silvergate's death spiral is going to be rough for crypto. The bank's shares fell by over 50% following the news, reaching all time lows of $6.91.
00:25:38.338 - 00:26:28.550, Speaker C: In addition, JPMorgan downgraded Silvergate's rating from neutral to underweight and removed its $14 per share target only hours after the company disclosed they were not filing its Ten K form. Coinbase announced that it had stopped using Silvergate to handle dollar payments for its prime customers, citing an, quote, abundance of caution. Instead, the exchange has shifted to signature. Bank Coinbase said that it has had only minimal exposure to Silvergate. While the exchange did not disclose the reason behind the switch, it may have been driven by a desire to avoid any potential fallout if Silvergate goes under. Following Coinbase's move, many other companies, including Circle, Paxos, Crypto.com which disclosure is a sponsor of Unchained Bitstamp, SIBO Digital Markets and Gemini also decided to stop doing business with Silvergate.
00:26:28.550 - 00:27:23.610, Speaker C: FTX's former Director of Engineering faces fraud charges. Former FTX Director of Engineering Nishad Singh was charged with fraud by both the US. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission after entering a guilty plea in federal court. The charges allege that Singh conspired to defraud FTX's investors and users. The CFTC claimed that Singh created features in FTX's code that allowed Alameda Research to gain an unfair advantage on the exchange, including an unlimited line of credit and exemption from the exchange's auto liquidation function. Singh also allegedly moved Alameda's $8 billion in liabilities to a fake customer account on FTX's systems, effectively hiding Alameda's negative balance.
