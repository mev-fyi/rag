00:00:00.090 - 00:00:45.670, Speaker A: Um hi everyone. Thanks for tuning in to this week's News recap. First Headline Bitcoin liquidations trigger selloff but the bull run isn't over. After Bitcoin saw alltime highs near $42,000 last week, the price fell below $31,000 on Monday, when a series of futures liquidations sparked declines elsewhere in the market. Onchain analysts list, Willy Wu noted that once spot markets began their selloff, coinbase began failing to register buys. That caused the bitcoin price on Coinbase to go $350 lower than on other exchanges. That in turn, pulled down index prices that futures exchanges used to calculate leverage funding.
00:00:45.670 - 00:01:50.670, Speaker A: Synthetics founder Kane Warwick took to Twitter to offer his theory on how over leveraged longs had caused these corrections. He said that in an early bull market, longtime holders will take profits around a previous alltime high. After that, however, he said they will ride the price up to multiples of the previous all time high. For example, he wrote, quote I sold around five to 10% of my ETH into stables between $500 and one $200 over one $200. You would need to claw it out of my cold, dead hands before we hit three K. The Block's Larry Cermac pulled data showing that retail investors are dipping their toes back into the crypto markets in this rally that has so far been driven by institutional money. Although the numbers have not reached 2017 levels yet, google's search interest for bitcoin is at a three year high, and exchange traffic is also starting to pick up, with another consecutive monthly increase of 24% in December and data showing a total of 196,000,000 website visits to crypto exchanges.
00:01:50.670 - 00:02:58.002, Speaker A: Next headline. Gary Gensler named SEC Chairman a move hailed as positive for crypto. President elect Joe Biden is expected to name Gary Gensler as Chairman of the US. Securities and Exchange Commission. Gensler, a former Commodities Futures Trading Commission chairman, has testified before Congress regarding crypto and blockchain technology on several occasions and once called it, quote, a catalyst for change in the world of finance and broader economy. On Twitter, compound General Counsel Jake Trevinsky said Gensler's selection signals a policy shift in favor of a Bitcoin ETF, while also pointing out that Gensler was on the record in 2018, saying there was a strong case XRP is a security, and so there is unlikely to be a shift in the SEC's case against Ripple. Next Headline FinCEN extends comment period on controversial self hosted wallet rules The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network extended its comment period for a proposed rule that would require crypto exchanges to store name and address information for customers sending more than $3,000 in crypto per day to self hosted crypto wallets.
00:02:58.002 - 00:03:54.594, Speaker A: It would also mandate that exchanges file currency transaction reports for customers whose transactions exceed $10,000 a day. On Thursday, Finsen said it would reopen the proposed rulemaking period for an additional 15 days from January 15. The extension means that current Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, largely seen as the sole driving force behind the proposed rule will no longer be in office when comments come to a close. Next headline BACT will go public on New York Stock Exchange through SPAC deal BACT is going public on the New York Stock Exchange via a SPAC or special purpose acquisition company, merging with VPC Impact Acquisition Holdings, which is backed by investment firm Victory Park Capital. The VC firm will also provide new funding as backed raises an additional $532,000,000. The venture is expected to have a public valuation of $2.1 billion once the merger is completed.
00:03:54.594 - 00:04:55.610, Speaker A: The company also announced that it had appointed Gavin Michael, a former city executive, as its CEO. The digital trading and payments app, which is expected to have a March launch, will allow users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies and manage other digital assets such as loyalty points and gift cards. Its regulatory filing states that bacted, which has more than 400,000 people preregistered ahead of its launch, hopes to reach more than 30 million customers by 2025. The news comes as another longtime player in the crypto exchange space, Gemini, says it is considering a debut on the stock market. Gemini would be following in the footsteps of Coinbase, which filed paperwork to go public at the end of last year. According to the block, PreIPO futures for Coinbase on FTX are trading at $303, implying a $76 billion valuation. Next Headline XRP Update The XRP securities saga continues to play out, with digital asset investment firm Grayscale confirming Wednesday that it is dissolving its XRP trust.
00:04:55.610 - 00:05:38.554, Speaker A: This announcement comes days after the firm announced the liquidation of XRP positions from its digital large cap fund. In both cases, the catalyst was the SEC's decision to file a lawsuit against Ripple. However, it wasn't all bad news for Ripple this week, with the top securities regulator in Japan saying XRP is not a security. Japan's Financial Services agency confirmed to the block this week that it views XRP as a cryptocurrency, not a security. As a side note, the XRP army has taken to replying to SEC tweets that are completely unrelated to the Ripple case, with comments like Here in the UK, the Finance Ministry has declared XRP as an exchange token, not a security. Exclamation point. Exclamation point.
00:05:38.554 - 00:06:23.906, Speaker A: Exclamation point. Oh, and by the way, not a security is in all caps. Next headline an argument for Social recovery. Wallets Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin published a blog post about increasing wallet security with what he called Social recovery. Social Recovery is a smart contract wallet with a single signing key to approve transactions, as well as a set of three or more guardians who can be called upon when the user loses his or her signing key. At that time, he or she would ask their guardians to sign special transactions to change the key registered in the wallet to a new one. Good suggestions for potential guardians would be one other devices owned by the user, two friends and family and three institutions.
00:06:23.906 - 00:07:34.966, Speaker A: As if to highlight just how useful this type of wallet would be, the New York Times came up with an article the next day about the plight of bitcoin millionaires who have lost access to their wallet, including one. Who has lost $222,000,000 in bitcoin at the current prices sitting on a hardware wallet that will only give him two more tries at the password before encrypting the contents forever. Next Headline Brian Brooks Quits the OCC Brian Brooks stepped down as acting head of the office of the controller of the currency Thursday. Brooks had a bold tenure as acting OCC head the last eight months and was expected to step down or be replaced by the incoming biden administration. Brooks will be remembered for issuing several interpretive letters that cleared the way for banks to interact with cryptocurrencies, with many describing him as the nation's quote, first fintech controller. On Tuesday, brooks published an op ed in the financial times calling for 21st century regulation of emerging DFI projects. Just as self driving cars have appeared in the last few years and upended the way we think about transportation and leaving regulators scrambling, brooks called for more clarity in federal regulation of DFI.
00:07:34.966 - 00:08:24.430, Speaker A: He expects DFI applications to take off quickly, risking a scenario in which US. States fill the void of federal regulatory uncertainty, impeding the development of a national market. Time for Fun Bits How a normie artist became stupid bitcoin rich and paid it back Ali Spaniola, an independent artist and creator of outrageousness, as she calls herself, made a hilarious video about how she earned a bitcoin back in 2013. And by the way, not in November December 2013, but like June 2013. She logged back in recently, discovered it was worth $11,000. Then by the time she actually published the video, it was worth $40,000. The video then details how she paid her newfound wealth back.
00:08:24.430 - 00:08:52.370, Speaker A: She's actually a really funny character, and the story is super entertaining and even kind of heartwarming. So anyway, thanks for tuning in.
