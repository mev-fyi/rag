00:00:00.330 - 00:00:01.162, Speaker A: Not a dividend.
00:00:01.226 - 00:00:02.474, Speaker B: It's a tale of two quan.
00:00:02.522 - 00:00:05.162, Speaker C: Now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet.
00:00:05.226 - 00:00:07.722, Speaker B: Generally speaking, airdrops are kind of pointless anyways.
00:00:07.866 - 00:00:10.830, Speaker C: Unnamed trading firms who are very involved.
00:00:12.690 - 00:00:15.840, Speaker A: DeFi protocols are the antidote to this problem.
00:00:17.170 - 00:00:17.918, Speaker D: Hello everybody.
00:00:18.004 - 00:00:36.994, Speaker C: Welcome to the chopping block. Every couple weeks, the usually four of us get together and give the crypto give the industry insider's perspective on the crypto topics of the day. So, quick intros. First up we've got Robert, crypto connoisseur and Captain of Compound. Next up we've got Tarun, Gigabrain and grandpuba at Gauntlet. Then we've got eman. Gunseur.
00:00:36.994 - 00:00:57.274, Speaker C: The emperor of avalanche. And lastly myself. And haseeb. I'm the head hype man at Dragonfly. So we are early stage investors in crypto, but I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice, legal advice, or even life advice. Goon it's great to see you. I know that you have had a harrowing few weeks with this whole drama.
00:00:57.274 - 00:01:55.038, Speaker C: We talked about it on the last episode just to get everybody caught up and really quickly jump into the meter thing. So there's this guy named Kyle Roche who is a class action lawyer who was caught in some kind of sting video recording operation, basically saying that he is the attack dog of Avalanche and he's suing a bunch of Avalanche competitors. Avalabs came out and basically said that actually Kyle Roche was one of like a bunch of lawyers we used. Kyle has since been largely publicly disgraced. Both Kyle and Avalabs have both basically denied that they have a continuing ongoing relationship. And Kyle Roche, apparently since our last episode, it's been announced that Kyle Roche withdrew from the open class action cases and was let go from his own law firm, Roche Friedman. So if I'm understanding correctly, the Tether lawsuit, the Bifnex lawsuit, tron and Binance class action lawsuits, all Kyle Roche is no longer active on those lawsuits.
00:01:55.038 - 00:02:05.858, Speaker C: So I know that this has probably been an insane few weeks for you. Give us the industry insider's perspective.
00:02:05.954 - 00:02:29.222, Speaker D: Sure. When I heard what was on that site, I was taken aback. I was incredulous and my first reaction was, this is crazy. And it's so out there that it's unbelievable that I don't think anyone's going to take any of this seriously. So I still hold that position. It's just way out there. And Kyle Roche is a lawyer.
00:02:29.222 - 00:03:12.294, Speaker D: Of the many lawyers that we employed it's one of the lawyers that we employed in the early days of Ava Labs. We've since of course, cut all ties with him. And Kyle was evidently trying to impress someone. And to do that, he decided to make up this whole Walter Mitty world for himself, where he's doing things and in the middle of everything and suing this and that. The one time we told Kyle what to do was the time after he sued Solana. And we learned about it from the press and we were immediately on the phone with him saying, what the heck are you doing? You can't be doing this. And he refused any advice.
00:03:12.294 - 00:03:43.518, Speaker D: So we told him not to sue Solana, and my general counsel then wrote a long piece saying that the core argument behind that class action lawsuit is entirely false and doesn't have legs. So that's the fact pattern. We don't sue our competitors. We have nothing to do with those lawsuits. So that's the short of it. The long of it, of course, is Kyle has sued a lot of projects, has made a lot of enemies, and he got trapped into saying things that are utterly false. I will add one additional fact to the fact pattern.
00:03:43.518 - 00:04:08.566, Speaker D: He admitted that he lied, and it's also been entered into court proceedings. So when he's withdrawing, he has actually written out that there were complete fabrications and falsifications made. So I think it's over. I'm over it, and there's no material to those. But there was a joke before that when Tarun was late, that he'd better be here on time or else I'll have him sued.
00:04:08.678 - 00:04:11.610, Speaker B: What is it about people named Kyle and crypto?
00:04:11.950 - 00:04:16.078, Speaker C: That's a good question. Wait, are you saying there are other Kyles who are problem children?
00:04:16.164 - 00:04:20.398, Speaker B: No, I'm just saying there's lots of Kyle who show up in the news.
00:04:20.484 - 00:04:23.470, Speaker C: Okay. I thought you might been calling out a civic Kyle.
00:04:23.630 - 00:04:31.762, Speaker A: So amongst all of the false statements that Kyle made, were there any truthful statements in the video recordings that you saw?
00:04:31.896 - 00:05:04.158, Speaker D: Sure. So I'm supposed to extract from what I saw. So let me be clear. I didn't have the heart to watch all of it because it just triggered me way too much. But he was employed in the early days, but just about every statement I heard was a small nugget of truth maxed out to its extreme. From the percentage of coins that he supposedly holds to the impact he had to how he did whatever he did. It's just all just extreme far out there.
00:05:04.158 - 00:05:46.586, Speaker D: So, yeah, he was our lawyer in the early days, and that's about the extent of it. He did represent us in a handful of cases. Let me be clear. He represented us in a bunch of lawsuits, routine commercial things. Contractor, we terminate a relationship, contractor wants more, this and that, they sue us, whatever. So those kinds of things, as far as I can remember off the top of my head about he was involved in about six different cases, and they were all defensive. And then there was one lawsuit where he represented me against somebody who made statements about my involvement in some organization that I have nothing to do with.
00:05:46.586 - 00:05:49.238, Speaker D: So that was the extent of our involvement.
00:05:49.414 - 00:06:02.506, Speaker C: Yeah, we talked about this on the last episode. Jill was mentioning that if you're in crypto long enough, you come across people who are just like, I was in the room when blah, blah, blah happened, and I was like, I'm Satoshi Nakamoto.
00:06:02.618 - 00:06:09.438, Speaker B: Ethereum has how many co founders? It's like few dozen co founders.
00:06:09.534 - 00:06:11.134, Speaker D: They all play the critical role.
00:06:11.182 - 00:06:16.770, Speaker B: But the thing is, if I try to count the number of people who've told me they're an Ethereum co founder, it's much more than a few dozen.
00:06:19.670 - 00:06:36.230, Speaker C: In many ways that's the problem with decentralization, is that we don't have very formal structures around these things. So people are just free to kind of say whatever. And it's common enough in startup. I mean, I can't tell you how many people I've met who tell me that they're Elon's closest friend. And it's just like, okay, well, you can't all be right, because he seems very busy.
00:06:36.650 - 00:06:41.226, Speaker B: Well, he has to get the memes from somewhere. So you might not be his friend, you might just be the meme supplier.
00:06:41.258 - 00:06:47.198, Speaker C: Oh, that is true. That is true. That's a different kind of friendship than the normal kind. Do you feel like this is mostly blown over?
00:06:47.284 - 00:07:21.674, Speaker D: I think so. I mean, what's there to blow over? It's just a bunch of made up stuff. There is not much I can do. I can control the things I build, I can control the things I do, but I can't control what other people outside of my organization will say to the rest of the world. And then the only thing you can do when they say crazy things is say, no, that's not the truth. This is what we did. And I'm hoping every time I underestimate the world, it surprises me in a pleasant way that I think people are decent, they understand what can happen and the truth finds a way of coming out.
00:07:21.674 - 00:07:37.630, Speaker D: So I think this is over now and it's over in my mind. I think we've had a very strong reaction. We clarified the record repeatedly. So of course there will be attempts to bring this back again and again and again. That's okay, we'll deal with that. That's a minor hassle for us.
00:07:37.700 - 00:07:46.770, Speaker C: So tell us about the ICP angle, because I know that this is another interesting angle, the Insane Clown Posse.
00:07:49.110 - 00:08:13.306, Speaker D: So I don't really have much to say on that front. Kyle sued ICP, and I didn't actually know that Kyle had sued ICP until this event. So that's all. And so that's that connection. And Dom also has some kind of beef with us because he thinks he owns the word subnet. And we use the word subnet and that's fine, whatever. He can get upset at us.
00:08:13.306 - 00:08:27.214, Speaker D: We didn't know he was using the word. I think the word is pretty clear the way we use it. We have a different definition for it. He's free to use it as well. That's totally fine. So that's the angle I know. And there's also a BSV angle, right.
00:08:27.214 - 00:08:47.378, Speaker D: So Kyle had sued, was involved in the lawsuit between Kleman and Craig Wright. And so again, it's my loose understanding may or may not be factual that whoever did the recordings was involved in BSV. But I don't know. This is all way outside of how.
00:08:47.384 - 00:08:55.766, Speaker B: Did he get involved in all these cases? I'm like either he's a genius lawyer or something. There's got to be something there. He's like somehow in lawyer can just.
00:08:55.788 - 00:09:01.574, Speaker A: File a class action lawsuit against anyone they want. And that's one of the problems with the legal system that we have in America.
00:09:01.702 - 00:09:22.922, Speaker D: It's one of the things that is actually nice about the US. That the government doesn't have to prosecute you if there's something bad happening that affects enough number of people that you can take the matter into your own hands. So I like that thing. Then it becomes very litigious and that of course is not good. In any case, it's all beyond me. I have nothing to do with this stuff. We build systems.
00:09:22.922 - 00:09:30.110, Speaker D: Kyle does lawyer stuff and we needed defensive work. We hired him and haven't used him in an offensive capacity.
00:09:30.270 - 00:09:40.586, Speaker C: Well, anyway, I think we've said enough about this at this point. I feel like it's kind of blood from a stone with respect to the story. It's just been a slow few weeks that we have to I don't know.
00:09:40.588 - 00:09:41.750, Speaker B: If it's been slow.
00:09:42.170 - 00:09:46.422, Speaker C: I feel like it's been pretty slow. It feels like it's been a very slow few weeks.
00:09:46.556 - 00:09:48.280, Speaker B: I don't think that's true.
00:09:49.050 - 00:09:51.074, Speaker C: What is the exciting thing that's happened the last few weeks?
00:09:51.132 - 00:09:55.818, Speaker B: Well, I feel like people are speculating on the one big event of the.
00:09:55.824 - 00:09:56.602, Speaker C: Week that is true.
00:09:56.656 - 00:09:57.254, Speaker A: The merge.
00:09:57.302 - 00:09:57.734, Speaker C: The merge.
00:09:57.782 - 00:09:58.810, Speaker D: Oh, the merge.
00:09:59.230 - 00:10:19.986, Speaker C: That is the one big thing today. We're recording this on September twelveTH. The merge is slated most likely to go live on September 15. So for those of you who somehow don't know what the hell is going on, the merge is when Ethereum transitions to full proof of stake and abandons proof of work. Except for the one ETH pal fork, which I guess is still supposedly going to go on.
00:10:20.088 - 00:10:21.474, Speaker A: I think it's going to happen.
00:10:21.672 - 00:10:29.160, Speaker B: It's never going to happen, but I think they're going to will it succeed? I feel like it's going to happen, but they're going to mess it up completely.
00:10:30.170 - 00:10:51.466, Speaker C: Okay, so just real quick, high level stats on the merge. So net issuance is expected to be between zero and 0.5% annually after the merge. Just for reference, bitcoin today is about 1.8% annual inflation. Ethereum pre merge, not including fee burn was about 4.5%. Fee burn obviously has been super volatile but it's somewhere in the 4% range.
00:10:51.466 - 00:11:07.762, Speaker C: It's going to go down to about 0.5%. So you're going to lose 90% of the ETH issuance after the merge and of course energy usage is going to cut down by like 99.95%. So it's going to be basically totally green and very ESG after the merge. Anybody following the Ethpal stuff? Does anyone know what's going on there?
00:11:07.896 - 00:11:58.226, Speaker A: I loosely follow the Ethpal stuff. Here's my take on the situation. Obviously there's a huge amount of proof of work mining hardware designed for Ethereum that has to go somewhere. In general, Ethereum Classic is not a great use of that mining equipment. And a lot of the miners think that the easiest thing to do is to keep on mining Ethereum with the existing state and just fork it and direct all of their hardware towards continuing proof of work for a fork of Ethereum. I think the bigger issue is that there's a lot of hardware that has to go somewhere and is depreciating quickly and miners are at some point either going to have to realize that the hardware is no longer as useful or will a blockchain into existence that has value. And I think they're trying to will a blockchain into existence that has value.
00:11:58.226 - 00:12:08.382, Speaker A: Now the approach that they're taking is to fork the entire state of Ethereum not fork just the Ether balances, but to fork every single smart contract. And I think it's going to be a total cluster.
00:12:08.526 - 00:12:14.054, Speaker B: I'm in their discord and it already is. They have like a private discord and I will say it is.
00:12:14.172 - 00:12:15.554, Speaker C: Oh, you're in a private discord?
00:12:15.602 - 00:12:19.706, Speaker B: Yeah, they're like DM to get into our private discord. If you want to help QA or.
00:12:19.728 - 00:12:23.274, Speaker C: RPC, I was like, sure, okay, interesting.
00:12:23.472 - 00:12:28.460, Speaker B: Is Gauntlet going to support the this is me as an I just wanted to see what.
00:12:30.770 - 00:12:32.618, Speaker A: Leak the Anon alpha.
00:12:32.794 - 00:13:03.554, Speaker B: The alpha is basically they haven't been able to sync a node fully with all their changes. It's like not bitwise identical up to some point. So there's just some points at which they are observing some contract state that's different than ETH mainnet and they haven't been able to fix it and obviously they don't have much time and all the miners have to sync. So one thing is if they can't get their client to be bitwise identical, you can't just take an existing archive node and use its data up to the fork block.
00:13:03.602 - 00:13:06.786, Speaker C: But what else are they changing that it wouldn't be bitwise identical?
00:13:06.978 - 00:13:20.878, Speaker B: Well, yeah, there's a lot there's like pre compiles and stuff that have been added that they're trying to remove. They also changed all the minor fees. So like the base fee is going to miner dow. It's not going burnt anymore. They're taking all the Ethereum foundations ETH and sending it themselves.
00:13:20.964 - 00:13:21.310, Speaker D: What?
00:13:21.380 - 00:13:23.006, Speaker B: Yeah, there's like all sorts of I.
00:13:23.028 - 00:13:24.586, Speaker C: Did not know this, but they fucked.
00:13:24.618 - 00:13:39.390, Speaker B: Up all of that. They're trying to give miners access to some private RPC node they're running that they're debugging on but not giving out the full thing because I still can't get identical.
00:13:39.470 - 00:13:41.806, Speaker A: This is a terrible way to fork the blockchain.
00:13:41.998 - 00:13:43.166, Speaker C: This is ridiculous.
00:13:43.278 - 00:13:46.900, Speaker D: Why? It's not a terrible way to it's not the best way.
00:13:49.190 - 00:13:50.550, Speaker C: Let's do the goon defense.
00:13:51.050 - 00:13:52.962, Speaker A: How would goon fork ethereum?
00:13:53.026 - 00:13:55.240, Speaker D: I wouldn't. Fork ethereum. First of all.
00:13:58.970 - 00:14:01.838, Speaker C: You wake up tomorrow morning and you are the head of Ethpal.
00:14:01.874 - 00:14:25.490, Speaker D: No, that kind of a fork is a hostile fork. I would never do it, but if I were them, I'd start an L two powered by POW, and then that would be it. I'd just be like, hey, this is an L two done. And that would be the sensible thing to do. But have you guys looked at the fee calculation in Geth? It's just layers upon layers of very complex code. Like, I'm not the least bit surprised to hear that they screwed up that stuff.
00:14:25.560 - 00:14:30.450, Speaker B: The base fee burning thing, like, removing that actually just changed some changes.
00:14:30.520 - 00:14:31.380, Speaker D: So many.
00:14:34.630 - 00:14:50.510, Speaker B: One of the bugs I saw in the discord was the mempool priority queue. Do you remember in the early days of DeFi, there are lots of these bugs that people found where the guests didn't order equal keys in the priority queue for gas.
00:14:50.690 - 00:14:53.530, Speaker C: I remember this. Yeah. People would like grind. People would like grind.
00:14:53.950 - 00:14:57.210, Speaker B: Basically, they have bugs like that coming from their base change.
00:14:57.280 - 00:14:57.946, Speaker C: Oh, wow.
00:14:58.048 - 00:15:09.680, Speaker B: So they can't replay correctly, which is how are you going to mine on that? This was just me going in for a little dumpster dive and I was like, all right, great.
00:15:10.130 - 00:15:12.190, Speaker C: How much of the communication there is in English?
00:15:13.090 - 00:15:16.530, Speaker B: There's a lot of US miners who are asking questions.
00:15:16.680 - 00:15:17.380, Speaker C: Okay.
00:15:18.550 - 00:15:25.614, Speaker B: All the random US miners who are running GPUs are sitting there and they don't have any Chinese people working there. They're all in Texas.
00:15:25.742 - 00:15:28.994, Speaker C: I see, but the development is all happening in China. Right.
00:15:29.192 - 00:15:52.940, Speaker B: But the US miners are running the nodes and trying to test that their existing they have code bases, too, for managing the DevOps of, like, oh, when do they spin up and spin down things? How much should they and like, all of that's not working because they can't actually think, wow, that's why I only know the problems from the perspective of these people trying to run the nodes. I'm sure there's even more than the development. This is just from that.
00:15:53.470 - 00:15:54.778, Speaker C: They got three days.
00:15:54.944 - 00:16:09.380, Speaker B: No, I don't know how you're going to sync in time. I actually think they're just going to do kind of what you're saying. They're going to give up on it and just run a separate chain and try to sync it. Yeah. Right, because they want to send all these random accounts to themselves.
00:16:09.830 - 00:16:10.194, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:16:10.232 - 00:16:12.290, Speaker A: That's not the right way to launch the fork.
00:16:12.870 - 00:16:14.882, Speaker B: I mean, they did it too late. That's the problem.
00:16:14.936 - 00:16:15.106, Speaker C: Right?
00:16:15.128 - 00:16:18.178, Speaker B: Like, Chandler Groh came out and said it like, what, like three months ago?
00:16:18.264 - 00:16:18.574, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:16:18.632 - 00:16:27.880, Speaker B: And they didn't even get enough momentum. Come on. This is the slowest moving railroad car you've ever seen. You could have tried to have started like, a year.
00:16:29.130 - 00:16:37.754, Speaker C: And this is the same thing BSV did. Right. Didn't BSV also basically take Satoshi's bitcoins, right?
00:16:37.792 - 00:16:38.380, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:16:39.230 - 00:16:39.930, Speaker C: Do they not?
00:16:40.000 - 00:16:40.394, Speaker D: They did.
00:16:40.432 - 00:16:41.654, Speaker B: It's satoshi's vision.
00:16:41.702 - 00:16:45.050, Speaker D: Yeah, it is, but I didn't think they actually usurped the coins?
00:16:45.210 - 00:16:46.398, Speaker B: I'm pretty sure they did, yeah.
00:16:46.404 - 00:16:47.274, Speaker C: I believe they reassigned.
00:16:47.322 - 00:16:49.838, Speaker D: They talked about it. I don't know if they did, man.
00:16:49.924 - 00:16:53.066, Speaker C: You probably know better than we're, like your arch enemies.
00:16:53.098 - 00:17:00.242, Speaker D: For whatever reason, for whatever reason, they love to attack me. But no, I haven't followed closely enough. I didn't think they took the coins, though.
00:17:00.376 - 00:17:05.950, Speaker A: I mean, if you're listening right now, just tweet directly at Haseeb.
00:17:06.030 - 00:17:19.858, Speaker C: That's right. If you're part of the BSV community and you're mad about shows up on his phone, just go ahead and flame me into the ground. Okay, so whatever ETH power side sounds like it's a dumpster fire, but it's.
00:17:19.874 - 00:17:29.930, Speaker B: Kind of a little bit embarrassing to all the people who did forks in the past. It's like, kind of shows. Forks are, to your blog point, very hard to orchestrate with smart contracts.
00:17:30.270 - 00:17:34.046, Speaker C: That's right. Well, they're trying their best. And so it's whatever.
00:17:34.148 - 00:17:38.014, Speaker D: But the main show is the merge. Right. We should talk about the I mean.
00:17:38.052 - 00:17:45.582, Speaker C: That'S a great so here's the thing I'm kind of like so when you're talking to Laura about the show, laura's like, oh, you should make it about the merge. You guys should talk about stuff like.
00:17:45.716 - 00:17:47.200, Speaker D: What else is there to talk about?
00:17:47.650 - 00:17:58.486, Speaker C: We've all talked about the merge for, like, years now. It's going to happen on Wednesday or whatever. And then the day after Wednesday, you're going to wake up and you'll be like, oh, the merge happened. Now Ethereum, what do I have to look forward to in life now that the merge is done?
00:17:58.588 - 00:18:02.310, Speaker B: All the features that are promised in all these VIPs 4000 and up.
00:18:02.460 - 00:18:05.880, Speaker C: Yeah. So like, okay, so we got to wait for the actual changes.
00:18:08.730 - 00:18:10.766, Speaker B: All these things, like unclear.
00:18:10.898 - 00:18:12.906, Speaker A: What is 48, 44? Explain it to everyone.
00:18:13.008 - 00:18:56.630, Speaker B: Yeah. So there's a couple paths that Ethereum wants to take. So Ethereum, if you didn't tune in since 2019, was basically like, hey, our scaling plan is to go sharding, which is to have many shards. They synchronize on the beacon chain. They've decided to go the Cosmo Celestia route more so than the pure sharding route, and have a data availability layer where basically there's sort of this way of verifying that someone has the right data without you actually storing all of that data yourself. It's called sort of a data availability proof. And so they want to add that to Ethereum so that applications don't need to actually store as much data or hopefully.
00:18:56.630 - 00:19:42.406, Speaker B: And so there's a bunch of proposals which in some ways some have argued that they are block size increases, some have argued they're not. I'm not going to wade into that or I'll let the BSV people handle that. But it basically separates Blobs, which is data that's written that is not computed on necessarily within the transaction it's submitted and computes separately. So separating compute and storage, which a bunch of blockchains already do doing on Ethereum, is a lot more hairy because you need to make it backwards compatible with all the existing storage. Now, the upshot of this for roll ups is that roll ups only have to do compute when they post a fraud proof, usually if their fraud proofs are working and whatever the end state.
00:19:42.428 - 00:19:46.920, Speaker D: Of roll up fantasy world of yours is amazing.
00:19:47.450 - 00:20:16.690, Speaker B: T goes to infinity roll ups, not T equals now of roll ups. That's what I'm saying. So roll ups do post these blobs, right? Because the state has to live on this chain and I think there's still a lot of debate as to whether Ethereum will be able to implement this in a fast path and actually get this running. Or is this going to be like 1559 where burning the base fee, ironically, a form of lock in against forks, as we've learned in some indirect way by being a very complicated piece of code.
00:20:16.760 - 00:20:17.380, Speaker C: Right?
00:20:17.910 - 00:20:43.686, Speaker B: But yeah. Are they going to implement this? How are they going to implement it? I think the post merge roadmap is a bigger concern. The merge is just a narrative for investors who don't want to really understand how technology works to buy into it because they're like, oh, supply went all these ESG funds cannot buy. Like the current version of it. None of the features that were promised a long time ago are even close.
00:20:43.708 - 00:20:46.150, Speaker C: To being well, I agree with that. I agree with that, yes.
00:20:46.300 - 00:20:51.758, Speaker B: It's just like, we went from this list of 500 items and we did like, two and it took ten times.
00:20:51.844 - 00:20:58.266, Speaker A: It's very simple. Merge and then surge comes before surge.
00:20:58.378 - 00:21:07.490, Speaker C: General Robert Petraeus I feel like they nailed the messaging, the fact that you get on the show, just the merge, the surge, the splurge, the bird.
00:21:07.990 - 00:21:17.890, Speaker B: Have you seen that crazy flowchart diagram that Vitalik has with this? I mean, there's so many things on that. This is like playing Shoots and Ladders and you just got to the first ladder.
00:21:18.310 - 00:21:34.938, Speaker C: Well, unfortunately, there's no way to fast track. You can only lose progress, apparently, which seems like what we've done. I mean, remember, the merge was supposed to be done in 2017. That was the original Ethereum roadmap, was that they believed. I mean, that's why the difficulty bomb was put where it was, because they believed that within two years no, I.
00:21:34.944 - 00:21:36.554, Speaker B: Think it was 18, but close.
00:21:36.592 - 00:21:36.986, Speaker C: Yeah, okay.
00:21:37.008 - 00:21:46.990, Speaker D: Yeah, I remember discussing how to shard blockchains back in 15 with Vlad and Metallic and yeah, no, it's been a while.
00:21:47.060 - 00:22:04.990, Speaker C: So good. You are the OG among OGS when it comes to seeing the development of smart contracts. Give us, like, back in the day, how did people think about proof of stake back when Ethereum was first getting put together? Tell us the story.
00:22:05.080 - 00:23:14.806, Speaker D: The entirety of that thinking was predicated on matching proof of work. So everything that you see in Ethereum Two is there because people felt that they had to one for one, cover POW and have a mechanism that corresponds to what's happening in POW. So things like slashing, things like just the way the discourse happened, the framework in which people think about these things is based entirely on the Bitcoin way of thinking and trying to match bitcoin's features. And there was a lot of talk about sharding and it's a good idea in general, if I leave a PhD student alone in the first month, they will be like, oh yeah, to scale something up, you got to shard it. In the early days, the focus was entirely on sharding because how else are you going to get any kind of scale up? But if I leave a PhD student alone for a year, they'll come back and say let's not shard. This is hard because it opens up a whole lot of issues, especially on the public blockchain because now you get people who are picking and choosing their shards. Once you shard something K ways, you had one problem, you've got K shards.
00:23:14.806 - 00:23:21.370, Speaker D: Now you've got K plus one problems. Right. The K shards, each and every one of them, plus the inter shard communication problem.
00:23:21.440 - 00:23:25.290, Speaker B: Yeah, K squared. Yeah, it's really K Squared.
00:23:26.510 - 00:23:55.158, Speaker D: This is a really K factorial pretty easily. In the early days it seemed like maybe it was solvable and so on, but Tarun just summarized it really well. It starts out with a big vision and then when the push comes to shove, you just jettison everything. Now we're back to but I think that merge is a fantastic thing. I cannot wait for it to happen. One of the biggest outcomes from it will be the fact that we'll no longer talk about the merge. So we'll save a lot of time.
00:23:55.244 - 00:23:56.834, Speaker A: We're going to move on to the surge.
00:23:56.962 - 00:23:58.506, Speaker D: We're going to move on to whatever comes next.
00:23:58.528 - 00:24:00.102, Speaker C: It'll become even slower in cycle.
00:24:00.166 - 00:24:21.482, Speaker B: I'm more excited for all these excess GPUs to just be used for stable diffusion. Some friend of mine who works at this miner in New Jersey and they've literally turned all their ETH miners into ML excess capacity business model there. Effectively you're just competing with OpenAI.
00:24:21.546 - 00:24:21.774, Speaker C: Right?
00:24:21.812 - 00:24:34.898, Speaker B: Because the question is, will the open source thing, will it be good enough like Linux, where being the infrastructure provider like AWS is good enough that it will beat the really optimized someone's going.
00:24:34.904 - 00:24:36.600, Speaker A: To stick a token model on this.
00:24:39.770 - 00:24:41.750, Speaker B: There's like a million people pitching.
00:24:45.370 - 00:24:46.130, Speaker A: And rendering.
00:24:46.210 - 00:24:47.346, Speaker C: Yeah, it was rendering.
00:24:47.378 - 00:25:00.086, Speaker B: No, but no one is actually focused on the AI thing of like oh, how valuable is this particular graphic to you? And I'm going to upcharge you for that because I think that's where we haven't seen that's the innovation of this cycle compute.
00:25:00.118 - 00:25:01.894, Speaker C: You're talking about non commodified compute?
00:25:02.022 - 00:25:04.718, Speaker B: Yeah, it's just GPU stable diffusion will run well.
00:25:04.724 - 00:25:12.320, Speaker C: No, what I'm saying is that normally almost all compute today is commodified, meaning that the compute is not charged to you differently based on what you're doing?
00:25:12.850 - 00:25:17.502, Speaker B: Sort of. But value based pricing, you still bid in auctions for preemptibles, right?
00:25:17.556 - 00:25:17.726, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:25:17.748 - 00:25:18.810, Speaker A: But it's still a commodity.
00:25:18.890 - 00:25:24.274, Speaker C: Yeah, but it's still treated as a commodity. Right. Something is not commodity priced, and that looks at the value you're creating with it and charges you right.
00:25:24.312 - 00:25:29.262, Speaker A: Based on the value, you create 1% of your NFT sale based on what it output. That would be non commodity.
00:25:29.326 - 00:25:29.938, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:25:30.104 - 00:25:59.338, Speaker B: I just more mean that I think there'll be auctions for the there's, like a fixed amount of commodities are auction. What I mean is, currently, if you look at the pricing of OpenAI API call or API call, those uniform across all queries, there's no competition for that. And I actually think that will change. That's the thing that will change now that this is sort of like this race where a lot of people are doing these stable diffusion startups.
00:25:59.434 - 00:26:08.340, Speaker A: So if you had to estimate the cost of computing one call to stable diffusion in thousands of a cent, what would you estimate it?
00:26:09.030 - 00:26:11.650, Speaker C: I think right now, it's free, actually. There's, like, a bunch of free.
00:26:11.720 - 00:26:12.834, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree. It's free.
00:26:12.872 - 00:26:14.894, Speaker B: Right now, we ignore all the subsidies.
00:26:14.942 - 00:26:16.354, Speaker A: That are coming, but, like, the underlying.
00:26:16.402 - 00:26:21.570, Speaker B: Cost probably in the range of, like, tens of cents.
00:26:21.730 - 00:26:24.950, Speaker C: No tens of cents. You can run this on a laptop.
00:26:25.450 - 00:26:29.720, Speaker B: But for quite on an M one, not on a like really? Sure.
00:26:31.130 - 00:26:33.014, Speaker A: Let's say it's $0.01. Yeah.
00:26:33.052 - 00:26:33.962, Speaker C: Maybe a cent.
00:26:34.016 - 00:26:40.780, Speaker A: Maybe a few cents if it's one cent. I mean, I'm just waiting for someone to make a movie out of this because, like, 60 frames per second. Right.
00:26:41.150 - 00:26:47.226, Speaker C: I'm serious. Yeah. Google has been demonstrating some really interesting okay. By the way, we're getting, like, way off topic.
00:26:47.338 - 00:26:48.720, Speaker A: No, this is the good stuff.
00:26:49.410 - 00:26:50.110, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:26:50.260 - 00:26:55.498, Speaker B: Wait, we're coming back to what the token model for this? Wait a minute.
00:26:55.674 - 00:27:04.514, Speaker C: But the number one thing is that Nvidia has probably been the number one company that's been rocked the most by crypto. Right. Because you remember 2017, their stock price went crazy.
00:27:04.632 - 00:27:10.370, Speaker B: Well, they got a fine from the SEC this year by not disclosing that crypto was a material impact.
00:27:10.890 - 00:27:34.686, Speaker C: That's right. I feel bad for them, although they've obviously made a ton of money from crypto, but now it looks like GPUs are finally going back to regular pricing. Like, their supply shortages are going away. Normal gamers can buy GPUs without, like, two x markup on secondary markets. So that is one big change. And the other thing that's happened is that all these random proof of work coins are starting to pump. So Ravencoin, I read, is up like, 100%.
00:27:34.788 - 00:27:39.098, Speaker A: Why wouldn't it be the inverse? Because when you can mine it so easily.
00:27:39.194 - 00:27:46.194, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. Because if you have GPUs, you can mine this coin. Same with ETH classic. Right. Why did ETH classic go up? Because if you have GPUs, you can mine ETH classic. Okay.
00:27:46.312 - 00:27:48.180, Speaker B: Who are the buyers? You've just told me.
00:27:50.550 - 00:27:58.280, Speaker C: This is what happens is that people who don't understand that, they see this leaning into, oh, hash rate's going up, therefore it's more valuable. So I will buy it.
00:28:00.490 - 00:28:05.160, Speaker B: Is a webland good? That's your claim. I agree.
00:28:06.090 - 00:28:25.610, Speaker C: In the short term, it is. It's not a webland good so much as it creates momentum that causes people to buy, and then the miners dump into that buy pressure. Right. This happens all the time. Every time that you see these rotation of hash rate, the price pumps, because people are like, oh, finally this thing is coming to life. Like Ravencoin. Look, I don't know anything about Ravencoin.
00:28:25.770 - 00:28:29.342, Speaker A: Wasn't that the overstock.com related one?
00:28:29.476 - 00:28:41.330, Speaker C: I don't know. The only time I've ever heard the name Ravencoin is from proof of Work miners who are rotating.
00:28:41.910 - 00:29:01.014, Speaker B: No, the reason I heard about it is do you remember there was this scandal about this company that was trying to make an ETH ASIC? This is bottom of the bear market. Use 2019 lindsay Linzhi And they wrote this blog about making this ASIC that will dominate ETH mining, and it never happened. Those people were the Ravencoin people.
00:29:01.132 - 00:29:01.958, Speaker C: Oh, okay.
00:29:02.044 - 00:29:04.390, Speaker B: That's the only reason I've ever heard of Ravencoin.
00:29:04.990 - 00:29:07.638, Speaker C: I only hear about Ravencoin from miners. I've never heard of anyone normal.
00:29:07.654 - 00:29:12.842, Speaker A: Tell me about it. I found out about it from Four chan because people were like, patrick Byrne is buying it or whatever.
00:29:12.896 - 00:29:15.786, Speaker C: Oh, is that right? Yeah. Who's Patrick? Or maybe overstocked.
00:29:15.818 - 00:29:16.426, Speaker A: Overstock.
00:29:16.538 - 00:29:17.360, Speaker B: That guy.
00:29:18.130 - 00:29:19.614, Speaker A: He's an angel investor in it.
00:29:19.652 - 00:29:25.460, Speaker C: I feel like the big nugget here is how often do you read Four chan? Great question.
00:29:26.390 - 00:29:31.378, Speaker A: I was an active reader of Biz in, like, 2017 or so.
00:29:31.464 - 00:29:33.106, Speaker C: Really? Okay.
00:29:33.208 - 00:29:41.558, Speaker A: It got really woe Jackie after that, and I stopped reading it. But back in 2017, I read Biz all the time. Great crypto forum back in the day.
00:29:41.724 - 00:29:45.990, Speaker C: So, tell, what is the Four chan perspective on crypto that you remember?
00:29:46.060 - 00:29:52.826, Speaker A: I haven't followed since 2017, but back in the day, there was a lot of great memes about basic attention token and Link.
00:29:53.008 - 00:29:54.042, Speaker C: That's what Link did.
00:29:54.096 - 00:29:56.070, Speaker D: Link was very strong, unfortunately.
00:29:56.150 - 00:30:15.806, Speaker B: Also, wait, does anyone ever think about how basic attention token is a really up kind of it kind of sounds like the Stanford Prison Experiment, but, like, as a token, you don't have basic attention. You need this token to have basic attention. Sorry, I forgot it was even that was what it stood for, because why.
00:30:15.828 - 00:30:17.066, Speaker C: Is the basic word in there?
00:30:17.108 - 00:30:32.354, Speaker A: It should have been brave, but here's my 2017 recollection. I could be, like, way off base here. The idea was that it would be the standard cost of an advertising unit. Hence, they were trying to value your attention for some unit.
00:30:32.402 - 00:30:35.830, Speaker B: Very 1984, though. Valuing your attention. Absolutely.
00:30:35.980 - 00:30:45.818, Speaker A: And they were trying to come up with, like, a canonical empirical unit for attention, for one advertising impression this is.
00:30:45.824 - 00:30:49.366, Speaker C: A very 2017 like look. We're going to take this broad concept.
00:30:49.478 - 00:30:55.930, Speaker B: And turn it into a Token in retrospective. It does just really sound like some means of controlling your attention. Token.
00:30:56.010 - 00:30:58.510, Speaker A: Yeah, that was the idea behind it.
00:30:58.580 - 00:31:02.606, Speaker D: I knew I knew Brendan, so I knew the tamology. It never struck me as that.
00:31:02.628 - 00:31:03.082, Speaker B: It didn't?
00:31:03.146 - 00:31:05.300, Speaker D: No, it's not trying to control you.
00:31:06.150 - 00:31:08.450, Speaker C: I mean, if they could, that'd be great. It'd be a great business model.
00:31:08.520 - 00:31:12.018, Speaker D: I've been totally brainwashed. Brendan controls everything. I think.
00:31:12.104 - 00:31:16.966, Speaker C: Clearly his basic attention is very expensive. Yeah, it's already been bought out.
00:31:17.148 - 00:31:19.080, Speaker A: Disclosure, I'm not a holder of.
00:31:21.690 - 00:31:25.960, Speaker B: Bat and Ravencoin. This is how you know you're in the bear market. When people bring those names up.
00:31:28.730 - 00:31:34.106, Speaker D: On any of these topics, I'm just so afraid of yes. You never know when people are going to get upset at you.
00:31:34.208 - 00:31:37.786, Speaker C: Yeah, well, that's kind of the theme of the show, is that we just say random stuff and people get mad at us.
00:31:37.808 - 00:31:40.860, Speaker A: Emman Hates Ravencoin and Bat. That's what I got from.
00:31:43.150 - 00:31:45.790, Speaker D: Just breathing a little bit. Sigh of relief.
00:31:46.450 - 00:31:53.658, Speaker C: That's right. Actually, here's a question for you goon. Do you feel like the beefs that you've gotten into with other founders has been good for you or bad for.
00:31:53.684 - 00:31:57.502, Speaker D: You on the net? Absolutely bad. Absolutely horrible.
00:31:57.566 - 00:31:57.890, Speaker C: Really?
00:31:57.960 - 00:31:58.642, Speaker D: Of course.
00:31:58.776 - 00:32:06.514, Speaker C: I don't get that beefs between I feel like beefs between coins is like actually it makes news. It's like WrestleMania, right?
00:32:06.552 - 00:32:16.920, Speaker A: I found out about you, and I respected you all the way back when you were ripping on Bancorp way back in the day. I was like, who is this Cornell professor ripping on the bancorp idea?
00:32:17.290 - 00:32:36.506, Speaker D: Yeah. No. Was it on the net? It's a big negative. You just make enemies for no reason. And I feel compelled to say the things I say because I feel like this is the truth as I know it, and therefore I have to say it. And then it gets me in hot water, and then suddenly there's like some kind of altercation. It's kind of unnecessary.
00:32:36.506 - 00:32:57.800, Speaker D: A lot of these people are people I like, but sometimes it's just people I really hate and they're doing a scam and then they attack me. Either way, I've gotten used to it. But if I could do it over again, I'd keep a low profile. My personality wouldn't allow this, but if I could redo my life, I'd be a go with the flow kind of guy. That's not me.
00:33:01.210 - 00:33:02.818, Speaker B: Whatever happened to Team Rocket?
00:33:02.914 - 00:33:17.818, Speaker D: Team Rocket? They disappeared. They did their bit. They did their bit. Every big movement needs a creation story. Every big one. And the biggest gift any group can give you is anonymity. It's like they give you something, take it or leave it all in the service.
00:33:17.818 - 00:33:26.650, Speaker D: They don't want credit. They don't want anything else. Here it is. And if we like it, we like it. If we don't, we don't. So team rocket disappeared. Chose to disappear.
00:33:26.650 - 00:33:31.722, Speaker D: Like, what's? Kaiser? Soze just, bam, vanish.
00:33:31.866 - 00:33:58.230, Speaker C: Fair enough. All right, well, move on to the other story that keeps on giving besides the merge, which is the tornado sanctions. Oh, yeah, I don't know that there's been much specific news except the two big items that I saw this week. So, first was that Huabi, the big Asian exchange, delisted every major privacy coin. So they delisted Zcash, Monero, Dcred, Dash, and the three other ones that I'd never heard of.
00:33:58.300 - 00:34:02.346, Speaker B: Wait, sorry. Dcred counts as a privacy coin in 2022?
00:34:02.528 - 00:34:06.982, Speaker C: Sure, I guess. I don't know. They had some privacy features.
00:34:07.126 - 00:34:11.210, Speaker B: They had a broken version of a Mimble Wimble additively.
00:34:11.290 - 00:34:12.080, Speaker C: That's right.
00:34:12.770 - 00:34:20.862, Speaker B: There were so many bugs. Yeah, exactly. You shouldn't get delisted for that for a future.
00:34:20.916 - 00:34:26.242, Speaker C: You don't mean I guess they saw Litecoin, right? Litecoin incorporated bimblemble, didn't they?
00:34:26.296 - 00:34:31.554, Speaker B: Litecoin's too big to fail. The Litecoin Foundation. Army is big on Twitter now.
00:34:31.592 - 00:34:32.226, Speaker C: That right.
00:34:32.328 - 00:34:55.686, Speaker B: Yeah. I don't know. All I know is Charlie Lee is like, I was like, just as research, I was trying to know normal TV coverage of crypto because I have no clue what people think. And Charlie Lee is on every single one of these really news channel episodes lately, being talking about the Litecoin Foundation, I was like, they have a foundation that's active?
00:34:55.878 - 00:35:05.514, Speaker C: Wow, learning so much about you guys. You read four Chan, you watch TV. What's your guilty pleasure?
00:35:05.562 - 00:35:07.022, Speaker D: I have no idea. I don't even know.
00:35:07.076 - 00:35:11.520, Speaker C: You don't even know? Dealing with lawyers all day.
00:35:11.970 - 00:35:14.160, Speaker B: Lawyers. Lawyers. There you go.
00:35:18.470 - 00:35:19.634, Speaker C: Okay. Got it.
00:35:19.752 - 00:35:24.450, Speaker B: Shouldn't lawyers be happy that you're late because they charged you for being late? I'll never get sued.
00:35:25.190 - 00:35:35.906, Speaker C: Well, speaking speaking of lawsuits, so the other big news in Tornado land was that Coinbase is bankrolling a number of lawsuits against treasury. So basically separate lawsuits.
00:35:35.938 - 00:35:37.014, Speaker B: Or is it one?
00:35:37.132 - 00:35:38.806, Speaker D: I think there was several treasury yeah.
00:35:38.828 - 00:35:40.866, Speaker C: Against treasury for the OFAC restrictions.
00:35:40.898 - 00:35:43.358, Speaker A: I thought it was one lawsuit with six plaintiffs.
00:35:43.474 - 00:36:14.370, Speaker C: Plaintiffs. Oh, I see, I see. Got it, got it, got it. Okay. That's why I was confused. So they're backing a lawsuit against treasury. There's a number of plaintiffs, each of whom had some kind of sympathetic story for so they basically did the thing that you're supposed to do, which is find sympathetic plaintiffs who have clean stories, not just know some dude who from North Korea and is like, hey, why are you taking my money away? It's somebody who's like one of the stories was a Cordev who was getting paid for something, and one of their neighbors was like, hey, I heard that you're in ethereum.
00:36:14.370 - 00:36:22.902, Speaker C: And then he was like, I should use tornado to hide the money that I'm making, because this person apparently was tracking something I did on Chain, like some NFT purchase or something.
00:36:22.956 - 00:37:01.202, Speaker B: There's some story like this also, I think preston? This is Preston, right? I don't remember. I think this is him. He also had this thing where there was some point vitalik sent him a large amount of ETH to pay for Prism, not for and that's what funded one of these client development groups. But I think people inferred that as he got that and I think that also led to some security things for him where people trying to impersonate him and send messages to Vitalik to say send more money. So he had a lot of good reasons people were spoofing his identity a lot.
00:37:01.256 - 00:37:04.574, Speaker D: Yeah, you don't have to have a good reason to want financial privacy.
00:37:04.622 - 00:37:04.834, Speaker C: Right?
00:37:04.872 - 00:37:05.906, Speaker D: Let's just assume well, you do need.
00:37:05.928 - 00:37:06.418, Speaker C: To win a court case.
00:37:06.424 - 00:37:07.702, Speaker B: You need to win the court case.
00:37:07.756 - 00:37:51.522, Speaker C: You do need to have good reasons but generally speaking you shouldn't have to have good reasons. But anyway, so it was Preston Van Loon and I mean the overall picture. So in the last episode I came out kind of calling out Coinbase and saying that I thought they were going to roll over. I turned out to be wrong. So Maya Culpa congrats to Coinbase for sticking up somebody somebody said that this is the best PR that Coinbase could have possibly done and it was surprisingly cheap for how much credibility it won them and I think it's well deserved. But somebody else was telling me that they thought actually this was a really bad move by Coinbase. I should say not a bad move in terms of Coinbase for PR purposes, but a bad move with respect to getting treasury to back off.
00:37:51.522 - 00:38:35.002, Speaker C: And the way that they put it to me and I don't know if I agree with this, I don't have enough context. I don't know enough about how these kind of things play out. What they were claiming to me as somebody who spends a lot more time with people in Capitol Hill I don't know Robert, you might have a better perspective is that treasury is people too. And when you sue someone, they get mad and they get scared and they dig in and they know really what would have been best from the industry on the whole is to give treasury a way out and to help them save face in trying to back off from these things. Because clearly the reaction that they got was not what they expected. And there are probably a lot of people scrambling, trying to figure out, like, oh crap, everyone seems to be really pissed about this. What do we do? Going straight to a lawsuit makes it very, very difficult for them to actually walk it back if that's in fact a possibility.
00:38:35.002 - 00:38:43.706, Speaker C: Now, maybe it's not. Maybe there are things we don't know about treasury digging in their feet but this is like the nuclear option is the way that it was described to me. I don't know if that is a good assessment.
00:38:43.818 - 00:39:27.314, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean it's definitely an esque. I think it's too early to tell whether it's going to be successful or not. I think there's a lot of merits to the lawsuit that was filed. I think there's a good chance that the arguments come through. I think, from what I've heard, that a lot of the folks in treasury didn't necessarily even understand that there was a difference between tornado and other mixing services, and they didn't appreciate the difference between a smart contract based system versus a centralized mixer. And they are radically different and that a lot of people are just caught off guard by the backlash. And it's hard to say whether it's going to make them more willing to concede that they were wrong or less.
00:39:27.314 - 00:40:20.478, Speaker A: I would hope that it would be a wake up call to say, like, wow, if it's creating this much pushback, we clearly didn't do our homework enough on this. So I'm optimistic that the lawsuit is actually going to help, and I don't think it's going to cause anyone to dig in their heels. I hope that people are able to say, like, you know what? There wasn't enough homework done. We thought all mixers were all mixers. It turns out that we're getting into base layer and smart contract censorship here and raising issues that were not anticipated at all. Nobody wants to see North Korea succeed, right? I don't think anyone's advocating for the illegal uses of it. It's just a matter of, wow, more care needs to go into making existential changes to how sanctions work, going from sanctioning people and businesses to sanctioning autonomous programs.
00:40:20.654 - 00:41:08.930, Speaker D: I'll bring in some bit of history here. I'm totally in line with what you said. So do you guys remember the 90s when the Internet was getting to be bigger and bigger and all these forums, including four Chan, were beginning to pop up and you could go anywhere and you could say anything senator Blah blah, blah is jackass or what have you. And so this really pissed off a lot of people on Capitol Hill. And there was a lot of talk about one concept that some of your viewers may not have heard about, but was called the driver's license for the Internet. There was legislation, attempts to mandate a driver's license for the Internet, and the core reason being that old people on Capitol Hill could not handle other people saying whatever the hell they want on the Internet. So this mobilized everybody.
00:41:08.930 - 00:41:39.130, Speaker D: The Internet, the old IETF crowd, you're, the Internet Engineering Task Force, everybody there got mobilized to try to educate the lawmakers and say, look, there's an ethos associated with the Internet. There's also a technology. These two things don't really allow what you want to have done here, and if you try to do this, you will not achieve your policy aims. It's a parallel to the exact situation we have with tornado cash and privacy on blockchains. And in that case, the techies won, right? We have the Internet. We have today. It's not censored.
00:41:39.130 - 00:42:24.822, Speaker D: When law enforcement wants to do something, they have the hooks that they need and it's sort of a coevolution, right? They evolved to a point where they got the hooks that they needed and the technology gave them access in just the way that they wanted, but they end up getting those hooks from the edge. They never had to ban what you do on a carrier like At T. Never has to look at your packets to know. They don't listen to your phone conversations to see if you're doing an illegal convo. They don't look at your data. But now with this tornado cache thing, we're going towards a move where somebody has to look at what you're doing on the blockchain. So there are great parallels there, and in this case on the blockchain side, they stepped outside of historical precedent and they got the backlash.
00:42:24.822 - 00:42:30.810, Speaker D: So we'll see how this plays out. But I do agree that the lawsuit does notch everything up a notch.
00:42:31.550 - 00:42:50.562, Speaker C: It's a fascinating analogy. What do you feel like from your perspective, what do you feel like it is that the industry needs to do better in order to get the same kind of community on board with this idea that like, hey, the Internet doesn't have this notion of a driver's license and blockchain shouldn't either, right?
00:42:50.616 - 00:43:34.430, Speaker D: So that's a separate conversation and I've been thinking about it a lot. So the blockchain community is strictly smaller than the Internet crowd, right? And there is a very vocal crowd that is anti blockchain. And some of them are hardcore techies too. They're like, I've got my stock options. I've got my cushy job at large blue chip company and I hate the blockchain, and they hate it with a passion, right? And it's really interesting. You see this culture clash and so what does it take to get all these people on board to say, look, we're all fighting for the same thing financial freedom, breaking down monopolies in even playing field. We need to do a lot better in reaching out.
00:43:34.430 - 00:44:06.170, Speaker D: We need to do a lot better at policing ourselves. And the maximalism that came with some of the earlier systems do not help us. Right? This whole like, we're going to take down governments, there's only going to be one coin for the entire world, et cetera. That extreme libertarian idealism, et cetera. It doesn't really win you friends. You really got to admit that there's a bigger world out there that you need to integrate into. I think as a group, we need to back down from one of the core narratives in blockchains, which is, I will build you a single chain to rule the world.
00:44:06.170 - 00:44:31.086, Speaker D: I think people have to admit as an industry, we have to admit it's time to admit that there can't be a single chain that suits every need. What you build for the US. Will not satisfy the people in Europe, will not satisfy the people in China, et cetera, et cetera. So when we were building Avalanche, that's why we went to this different architecture with multiple chains. Avalanche is not a single chain. It's not three chains. It's actually a multitude of chains.
00:44:31.086 - 00:44:38.038, Speaker D: So that was part of our vision. And it's an underappreciated fact that the industry has to grapple with.
00:44:38.124 - 00:45:07.838, Speaker C: I guess the other thing about this whole concept of suing treasury and making this into a big fight, right. It's clearly an escalation of what came before. The other thing that brings to mind to me is that Coinbase seems to be, for whatever reason, it feels to me like FTX versus Coinbase. FTX has been super friendly. Obviously, they got into this spat with the CFTC when they were doing the hearings about have this verticalized that's right. Oh, that's right, that's right. Oh yeah.
00:45:07.838 - 00:45:35.010, Speaker C: For FTX us and their insurance stuff. But I feel like Sam has been very collaborative with government. It feels like Coinbase has been like I mean, Coinbase went to the mat with the SEC over the Coinbase earn thing. They are like digging their heels in on a lot of the listed assets on Coinbase, saying like, hey, if you think these are securities, come and get the when the SEC issued the what was the one where they listed like seven tokens and they said they were securities.
00:45:35.090 - 00:45:36.546, Speaker A: Nine tokens. For the insider trading.
00:45:36.578 - 00:45:45.098, Speaker C: For the insider trading. That was right. It was the insider trading case where they dropped these things statement that nine of these tokens were securities that were traded. Coinbase said we're not going to delist them.
00:45:45.184 - 00:45:51.786, Speaker B: The one that's not in the US. It's much easier to yes, I think being in the US is way but.
00:45:51.808 - 00:45:53.530, Speaker C: FDX has a big US presence.
00:45:53.890 - 00:45:57.882, Speaker A: US presence. But it's so arms like HQ is offshore.
00:45:58.026 - 00:45:58.720, Speaker C: Right.
00:46:00.210 - 00:46:03.466, Speaker B: You don't have to fight for survival in the same way.
00:46:03.508 - 00:46:04.980, Speaker C: I feel like that's true.
00:46:05.510 - 00:46:08.446, Speaker B: What's the worst case? You get rid of the US unit.
00:46:08.558 - 00:46:12.078, Speaker C: Which volume wise, it's a small portion.
00:46:12.254 - 00:46:24.646, Speaker B: I would argue that it reflects that corporate structuring difference that Coinbase can't get out of, that they're forever a US. Even if they tried to move, they would just be like a US citizen trying to get rid of their all.
00:46:24.668 - 00:46:40.746, Speaker A: Of their team is here. They're a publicly traded corporation and most of the revenues here, like they've picked their jurisdiction. And personally, I don't think you should have to look offshore to be a successful company.
00:46:40.848 - 00:47:10.290, Speaker D: I fully agree with that. I fully agree with it's such a red flag for me in my book, that a company that's based here, started here, drew its human resources from here, ought to be here. So if somebody's going off, it's a red flag. If somebody has to go off, you're driving them offshore. That's another red flag. It's red flags all around. But I'm curious about that, how it came to be that Coinbase with such a large US presence has less influence on the Hill than FTX.
00:47:10.730 - 00:47:18.278, Speaker B: Is it clear that they do, or is it just that Coinbase is horrible at PR? That's like, the thing I've never been able to tell.
00:47:18.364 - 00:47:29.786, Speaker C: I think it's pretty clear that we're still a very young industry. Like, the Internet industry, when it first started, even after having lots of money, had no idea how to talk to lawmakers and how to talk to regulators. So I think there's a learning curve to this stuff.
00:47:29.808 - 00:47:32.494, Speaker B: I think the first mover has the worst time at doing that.
00:47:32.532 - 00:47:33.518, Speaker C: That's also true.
00:47:33.684 - 00:47:35.230, Speaker D: It's like the oldest sibling.
00:47:38.690 - 00:47:42.190, Speaker C: People chill out a little bit. We dealt with Coinbase, we know what it's like.
00:47:42.260 - 00:47:50.898, Speaker B: I'm definitely not trying to say, like, there wasn't some skill or planning in FTX's moves, but they had the huge benefit of watching Coinbase fail so many times.
00:47:50.984 - 00:47:53.106, Speaker C: That's true. But also, like, the parents chill out a bit.
00:47:53.128 - 00:48:26.640, Speaker D: After the first, I spent a little bit of time talking to lawmakers, and it's interesting how United the Blockchain interested lawmakers both in Congress and in Senate they are regardless of which ideology. Right. So both Democrats and Republicans, they get it. So I was very pleasantly surprised at the level of sophistication that these people have. I think something in Sam's favorite is I think his parents are lobbyists. So I think that's part of the law professor. Okay.
00:48:27.090 - 00:48:28.202, Speaker A: Lobbyists.
00:48:28.346 - 00:48:29.280, Speaker D: I see.
00:48:29.970 - 00:48:30.942, Speaker B: All right, well done.
00:48:30.996 - 00:48:41.120, Speaker C: Well done. We're definitely going to put that in the intro reel from now on. It's a great line. Wow.
00:48:41.590 - 00:49:05.100, Speaker B: Okay. One funny fact of a news article I learned of something I learned this week since we're talking about FTX is so I guess FTX invested in Scaramucci's recent SkyBridge, but then SkyBridge invested in FTX. And it's like there's lots of this type of stuff in crypto, but this was the most publicly funny. Like, you go to both the websites yeah.
00:49:06.750 - 00:49:19.006, Speaker A: Not to be cynical about it, but if you buy 30% of SkyBridge for, like, $30 million and then direct $100 million of assets into your own vehicle that you're charging two and 20 on.
00:49:19.108 - 00:49:21.760, Speaker B: And fees buying on your exchange right.
00:49:22.450 - 00:49:28.958, Speaker A: You basically come out ahead for free. Dirty, cynically I think it was a brilliant investment if it was so self serving.
00:49:29.054 - 00:49:38.742, Speaker B: I just think it's funny. People used to be very careful about hiding all these recursive loops that live in crypto. This was one of the more blatantly obvious.
00:49:38.796 - 00:49:40.310, Speaker A: Yeah. One of the more obscene.
00:49:41.370 - 00:49:43.154, Speaker C: Have you spent much time with Mooch?
00:49:43.282 - 00:49:43.958, Speaker A: No.
00:49:44.124 - 00:49:44.614, Speaker D: Have you?
00:49:44.652 - 00:49:59.270, Speaker C: Have you? I mean, I don't know how he ended up in this industry. It seems very random to me. I don't really understand what he brings to the table.
00:49:59.350 - 00:50:01.366, Speaker D: We're growing. The space is growing.
00:50:01.398 - 00:50:02.874, Speaker A: Everybody wants to be in the crypto industry.
00:50:02.922 - 00:50:03.486, Speaker D: That's true.
00:50:03.588 - 00:50:06.206, Speaker B: He has run a successful conference. I'll give him isn't it?
00:50:06.228 - 00:50:06.494, Speaker A: Right now?
00:50:06.532 - 00:50:07.470, Speaker B: Yes, right now.
00:50:07.540 - 00:50:08.160, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:50:10.210 - 00:50:24.578, Speaker B: Think about it. This way. As you go down the level of sophistication of the investor table, you have this huge stack that still hasn't come into the space and you need the people who tell the narrative on the way down.
00:50:24.744 - 00:50:37.894, Speaker A: Well, the last piece of news, I mean, did you guys see today that there was a rumor that Fidelity was going to start directing retail capital into crypto? I don't know if it's founded or unfounded, but I was reading that on the Internet today.
00:50:38.012 - 00:50:40.630, Speaker B: Novo was on the Bins forum.
00:50:42.330 - 00:50:46.954, Speaker C: For the record, I've not been a big reader. You just get the digest. Yeah.
00:50:46.992 - 00:51:25.398, Speaker D: Fidelity is a strong group. I would not be surprised. That's good to hear. So the other thing tarun, though, that I've seen, it's not so much that the big folks moved in, and then the smaller fish are coming in, so I've been seeing large. So, first of all, when I was a professor, all these funds that were coming into Crypto would come to us, and they'd be like, hey, we need some academics and trustworthy individuals who can tell us what we need to pay attention to as we make investments into Crypto. So I knew hedge funds were coming six months before they were coming in. And in a similar fashion, I started seeing really large but very slow players, starting with Canadian retirement funds, start to.
00:51:25.404 - 00:51:27.670, Speaker A: Go into crypto, investing in Celsius.
00:51:32.570 - 00:51:34.460, Speaker B: They have a great track record.
00:51:35.630 - 00:51:41.758, Speaker D: That's true. But there are large funds, sources of money that are coming into the space, even in a bear market.
00:51:41.924 - 00:51:59.490, Speaker B: I just mean but those people rely on this other layer of fees, industry like Cambridge Associates and people to direct them onto what to invest. And that's like the Geppetto below some other Geppetto.
00:52:01.110 - 00:52:02.930, Speaker C: All right, that's a good description.
00:52:03.350 - 00:52:03.858, Speaker B: Okay.
00:52:03.944 - 00:52:14.694, Speaker C: All right, so last question before we wrap. Let's say September 15, the merge goes through, it is all successful. What do you do the day after the merge, Robert? What do you do?
00:52:14.812 - 00:52:15.714, Speaker A: Eat steak.
00:52:15.762 - 00:52:16.790, Speaker C: Eat steak?
00:52:17.390 - 00:52:25.610, Speaker B: Hopefully I wait, are you vegetarian? No, I was going to say hopefully. I already was just drunk. You're going to be drunk.
00:52:28.670 - 00:52:31.502, Speaker C: Your blood alcohol levels, like, going to converge with the difficulty level.
00:52:31.556 - 00:52:34.000, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. And then at that point it's like, oh man.
00:52:37.490 - 00:52:38.846, Speaker C: That'S perfect. That's perfect.
00:52:38.948 - 00:52:44.560, Speaker D: I'd probably be parting with done. I want the merge to be done.
00:52:45.170 - 00:52:50.114, Speaker B: Robert dole invites for steak. We'll both come over hungover and not be able to eat steak and eggs. How about that?
00:52:50.312 - 00:53:17.610, Speaker D: Sounds good. I'd stock up on food because after the merge, these proof of stake systems have failure modes that are different from proof of work. Proof of work is a very robust, very well understood technology. Once you switch to proof of stake, I can tell you firsthand that it is not the world's easiest and you can have and solana people will tell you the same thing. Right. You can have loops in there, you can have recursive feedback loops that cause problems for you. So I'd stock up on popcorn.
00:53:18.190 - 00:53:18.940, Speaker C: Okay.
00:53:19.470 - 00:53:28.614, Speaker B: I thought you were saying stock up on food. Because economy, we're like stock up on food lockdown.
00:53:28.662 - 00:53:30.030, Speaker A: If fruit for steak doesn't work.
00:53:30.100 - 00:53:30.750, Speaker C: Yeah, that's right.
00:53:30.820 - 00:53:32.686, Speaker D: It'll work. It'll work for sure.
00:53:32.868 - 00:53:36.610, Speaker C: All the plumbing goes out like the lights. Pretty soon.
00:53:36.680 - 00:53:38.802, Speaker A: The world doesn't run on ethereum yet.
00:53:38.936 - 00:53:44.340, Speaker C: Getting there. Except in Dubai. That's the one smart city stuff.
00:53:44.950 - 00:53:56.662, Speaker D: Do you remember the Simpsons episode on Y two K where Y two K hits and the street lights are shooting lasers at people? We're not quite there yet this week.
00:53:56.716 - 00:54:00.278, Speaker A: Actually, speaking of news, I just learned about the 2038 problem.
00:54:00.444 - 00:54:01.400, Speaker D: Oh, yeah.
00:54:02.090 - 00:54:04.266, Speaker A: I just learned about this this week. It's like the next Y.
00:54:04.288 - 00:54:06.774, Speaker D: Two K. Two k. This is actually serious.
00:54:06.822 - 00:54:15.722, Speaker A: Yeah, this is really serious. January 9, I believe 2038, like all time, is calculated since 1970. And we start to get an overflow.
00:54:15.786 - 00:54:18.160, Speaker B: On January 32 bit time, people.
00:54:22.690 - 00:54:26.158, Speaker D: The beginning of the Unix epoch was 1970.
00:54:26.244 - 00:54:26.638, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:54:26.724 - 00:54:30.386, Speaker D: And so it runs. You overrun the 32 bit counter in 2030.
00:54:30.408 - 00:54:31.586, Speaker C: How many people are using 32 bit?
00:54:31.608 - 00:54:34.980, Speaker D: The elevators will stop. They'll drop you.
00:54:36.970 - 00:54:41.080, Speaker C: Okay, all right. I'm not going to survive. You don't want to be in city.
00:54:41.610 - 00:54:44.710, Speaker A: January 9 into the woods.
00:54:46.170 - 00:54:48.040, Speaker D: This is white suk all over again.
00:54:51.310 - 00:54:53.450, Speaker C: What do you think is probability the merge fails?
00:54:54.110 - 00:54:54.890, Speaker D: 0%.
00:54:54.960 - 00:54:55.580, Speaker C: No.
00:55:01.730 - 00:55:13.920, Speaker D: Exactly. 0% failure of the merge on whenever, thursday, whenever it is. And I would say 100% expectation, I would say, of a liveness failure in the next six months.
00:55:14.630 - 00:55:16.180, Speaker B: That's a good prediction. Market.
00:55:16.710 - 00:55:17.602, Speaker C: Let's see.
00:55:17.736 - 00:55:27.270, Speaker D: But I'm hoping obviously, I don't want this misinterpreted. I want it to, of course, succeed. But I do know how hard these systems are to build, so let's see how it plays out.
00:55:27.340 - 00:55:29.126, Speaker B: And they have had liveness failures on.
00:55:29.148 - 00:55:34.466, Speaker D: Testnet on testnet without any financial incentives to play funny games.
00:55:34.658 - 00:55:44.326, Speaker C: Yeah. If anything, maybe an incentive not to play the games. If you know of vulnerability, pocket it and then hit it on main net and short the coin.
00:55:44.518 - 00:55:47.642, Speaker A: I don't think anyone's really that sophisticated, but we'll see.
00:55:47.696 - 00:55:51.578, Speaker D: I think the people who are that sophisticated are nice people. I think they tell I think the.
00:55:51.584 - 00:55:55.646, Speaker A: People who are that sophisticated are going to play, like, mev games instead.
00:55:55.748 - 00:55:56.158, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:55:56.244 - 00:56:02.126, Speaker B: But the real thing, mev game is like, if the POW fork even kind of gets live and that will be.
00:56:02.148 - 00:56:03.120, Speaker D: The king of all.
00:56:04.370 - 00:56:17.026, Speaker B: I really want someone to just make a bridge to the like the POW people, their way of saving face and becoming a layer two is to be like, oh, here's a bridge that we forked that you can bridge to. And that bridge will be the ultimate.
00:56:17.138 - 00:56:20.178, Speaker C: That would be a terrifying piece of infrastructure to run that bridge.
00:56:20.354 - 00:56:20.838, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:56:20.924 - 00:56:22.870, Speaker B: Okay. Taros was one nodes.
00:56:23.450 - 00:56:24.440, Speaker C: Fair enough.
00:56:28.650 - 00:56:33.750, Speaker B: I don't expect anything less than similar for this fork. Based on their discard.
00:56:34.890 - 00:56:39.978, Speaker C: Okay, well, I think we're at time. Thank you very much, Gun, for coming on and sharing your wisdom.
00:56:40.034 - 00:56:40.926, Speaker D: And thanks for having me.
00:56:40.948 - 00:56:49.340, Speaker C: Your optimism about everything going on, that's it from us. See you guys in a couple of weeks. Close.
