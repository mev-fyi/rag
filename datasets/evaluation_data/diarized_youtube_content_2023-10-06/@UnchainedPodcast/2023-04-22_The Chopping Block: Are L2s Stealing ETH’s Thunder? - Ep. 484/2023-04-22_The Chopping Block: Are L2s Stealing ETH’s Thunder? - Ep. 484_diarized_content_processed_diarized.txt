00:00:00.330 - 00:00:02.442, Speaker A: Not a dividend, it's a tale of Tupan.
00:00:02.506 - 00:00:05.162, Speaker B: Now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet.
00:00:05.226 - 00:00:07.722, Speaker C: Generally speaking, airdrops are kind of pointless anyways.
00:00:07.866 - 00:00:10.618, Speaker B: Unnamed trading firms who are very involved.
00:00:10.714 - 00:00:12.830, Speaker A: Alec ETH is the ultimate on this.
00:00:12.900 - 00:00:15.840, Speaker D: DeFi protocols are the antidote to this problem.
00:00:16.450 - 00:00:41.318, Speaker B: Hello everybody. Welcome to the chopping block. Every couple weeks the four of us get together and give the industry insider's perspective on the crypto topics of the day. We're doing a special late night episode. It is midnight here and we're all very tired, but we didn't have an episode for the Chopping Block this week and so we thought we would record something for you. First up, we've got Tom, the DeFi maven and master of memes, actually. We've got Robert, crypto connoisseur and captain of compound.
00:00:41.318 - 00:01:00.606, Speaker B: Then we've got Tarun, the gigabrain and grandpuba at Gauntlet. And you've got myself. I'm ASIB. I'm the head hype man at Dragonfly. So we are early stage investors in crypto, but I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice, legal advice, or even life advice. Please see Choppingblock XYZ for more disclosures. So we're coming at you late at night.
00:01:00.606 - 00:01:05.566, Speaker B: How are you guys doing on this? Very late, very long time listener, first.
00:01:05.588 - 00:01:09.074, Speaker D: Time caller, just really excited to be here and chop it up.
00:01:09.192 - 00:01:14.690, Speaker C: I just hope Tarun gets his pizza. I'm worried about him and his stomach. That's kind of my bigger.
00:01:16.790 - 00:01:21.510, Speaker A: I did dye my hair at least one of the colors that won the poll.
00:01:22.010 - 00:01:23.378, Speaker B: Which color won the poll?
00:01:23.474 - 00:01:26.550, Speaker A: Well, first of all, half of my head was shaved.
00:01:26.970 - 00:01:30.166, Speaker B: That's true. There was one that shave it off there was one that shave it off.
00:01:30.188 - 00:01:34.746, Speaker A: Once and I think orange or green won I forget which one? So I had both.
00:01:34.928 - 00:01:36.038, Speaker D: It's a strong choice.
00:01:36.134 - 00:01:36.554, Speaker B: Very nice.
00:01:36.592 - 00:01:38.620, Speaker D: It's Max Cypherpunk right now.
00:01:39.950 - 00:01:47.070, Speaker B: I'm glad that you're deferring to the chopping block, Dow. Unlike Arbitrage, you've learned a lesson about on chain governance, which is very good to see.
00:01:47.220 - 00:01:49.342, Speaker A: I don't want Gary coming after me.
00:01:49.476 - 00:02:26.090, Speaker B: I know. Okay, so this week, the news this week is all about regulation and legal stuff in Congress and people yelling at other people for being securities. Honestly, it's all kind of boring. And we were talking about like, hey, do we have to do another episode about more kind of legal? Like there's nothing that important that happened this, so and we're also pretty tired. It's just been a pretty grueling week as well. And so we thought maybe we'll shake it up today and try a little bit of variation in format. So instead of just rattling off the news and giving you vague opinions about them, we decided instead we're going to try something different.
00:02:26.090 - 00:02:28.758, Speaker B: So Tom, what's on the menu tonight?
00:02:28.934 - 00:02:56.390, Speaker C: So this was actually inspired by a tweet by Hillbobby, who is our data scientist here at Dragonfly, where he had a nice little dune chart, but with some of the key information such as the title scrubbed out and guessed. People just guessed what the chart was. And so we're going to play a little Guess that chart right now. So, apologies to any audio listeners. We'll try to get some nice descriptions of what the chart to pick. So are you guys ready?
00:02:56.540 - 00:02:58.854, Speaker A: Do you guys know what GeoGuessr is?
00:02:59.052 - 00:03:00.040, Speaker B: Yeah, of course.
00:03:02.490 - 00:03:05.158, Speaker A: This is the on chain GeoGuessr a.
00:03:05.164 - 00:03:12.074, Speaker D: Little bit for anyone listening. Tom has the charts, haseeb Tarun, and I do not know what chart he's about to put on the screen.
00:03:12.272 - 00:03:16.220, Speaker C: I don't know what chart I'm about to put on the screen, but here we go.
00:03:16.750 - 00:03:19.526, Speaker B: All right, let me see if I can describe the chart.
00:03:19.558 - 00:03:24.874, Speaker D: So the chart oh, this is transaction fees per chain.
00:03:25.002 - 00:03:26.218, Speaker C: You're so confident.
00:03:26.394 - 00:03:55.494, Speaker B: Okay, so the chart is it starts at January 2020 and it shoots up basically up through July 2021, and then comes down quite a bit in January 2022, comes down again in the summer, and then kind of hits a local bottom around beginning of 2023 and then starts going back up again. The biggest contributor is ethereum by far. Then there's BNB chain, then Polygon, then Arbitrum and avalanche, gnosis optimism. And there's like tiny, tiny little contributions from everything that's not Ethereum. Right?
00:03:55.532 - 00:04:02.774, Speaker D: And the key thing here is that okay, so I read too quickly. I was trying to do GeoGuessr style. I am not rainbow.
00:04:02.822 - 00:04:05.546, Speaker C: It's in black and white and it's pixelated, so you might not be able.
00:04:05.568 - 00:04:29.310, Speaker D: To so the Y axis, it goes up to one B, and halfway up there, it's 500 M. So we're going with like, 1,500,000,000. All the different chains are shown, but ethereum is like, 99% of this chart and there's like a little bit of activity from whatever polygon, but it's basically a chart of ethereum.
00:04:30.790 - 00:04:37.554, Speaker B: Okay. Something that daily maxes out at a billion and now is somewhere around 250,000,000.
00:04:37.752 - 00:04:40.418, Speaker A: Could it also be stablecoin volume?
00:04:40.594 - 00:04:42.038, Speaker D: I think it's way higher than that.
00:04:42.124 - 00:04:43.910, Speaker B: No, because there's no Tron on here.
00:04:44.060 - 00:04:46.034, Speaker A: Tron is going to be a huge representative.
00:04:46.162 - 00:04:47.186, Speaker B: It's not even on this chart.
00:04:47.218 - 00:04:49.122, Speaker C: You guys want a hint?
00:04:49.266 - 00:04:50.962, Speaker B: No hints. No hints.
00:04:51.106 - 00:04:58.122, Speaker D: If we don't get it in 1 minute, you're going to explain this to us at the end. You're going to educate the listeners on why this chart is interesting.
00:04:58.256 - 00:04:59.082, Speaker B: Yeah, I like that.
00:04:59.136 - 00:05:00.330, Speaker D: Because you picked it out.
00:05:00.480 - 00:05:03.710, Speaker B: I'm going to guess that it's transaction fees.
00:05:04.130 - 00:05:09.806, Speaker D: That was my first guess, and I know I'm wrong because there's no way that there's a billion of transaction fees a day.
00:05:09.988 - 00:05:20.594, Speaker B: Yeah, that doesn't seem right. Total fees paid, maybe? I don't know. That does seem too high.
00:05:20.712 - 00:05:24.210, Speaker A: Yeah, total is it maybe it's issuance?
00:05:24.710 - 00:05:35.318, Speaker B: No. A billion issuance a day. That doesn't make any sense. Yeah. Could it be like, native assets moved? Like the value of the native, like the value of ETH, value of BNB, value of polygon moved per day?
00:05:35.404 - 00:05:37.480, Speaker D: Bad investment decisions per.
00:05:41.850 - 00:05:44.550, Speaker A: Mean I mean, that billion a day must be anchor.
00:05:45.450 - 00:05:52.346, Speaker C: That's, uh that's the peak. No, your time is a bit off, tarun. You gotta you gotta look at the time series down here.
00:05:52.448 - 00:05:52.762, Speaker B: Sure.
00:05:52.816 - 00:05:54.766, Speaker C: No last guess.
00:05:54.788 - 00:05:57.214, Speaker B: It's one hint. Give us a hint. Give us it. We're clearly way off.
00:05:57.412 - 00:05:59.230, Speaker C: It is a TVL metric.
00:05:59.570 - 00:06:00.266, Speaker B: A TVL.
00:06:00.298 - 00:06:00.874, Speaker D: Metric.
00:06:01.002 - 00:06:04.606, Speaker B: Daily per chain bridge activity.
00:06:04.798 - 00:06:06.130, Speaker D: Maybe per day.
00:06:06.200 - 00:06:19.410, Speaker B: Bridging in assets. Bridge in per chain bridging out. TVL metric. TVL metric. Maybe like borrows? Like daily borrows. Borrows.
00:06:19.490 - 00:06:25.414, Speaker D: No, borrows. Got to be less than that. All right, I formally concede and give up on this.
00:06:25.612 - 00:06:27.590, Speaker B: Any last guess?
00:06:27.660 - 00:06:28.406, Speaker A: Go for it.
00:06:28.508 - 00:06:29.574, Speaker B: All right, what do we got?
00:06:29.612 - 00:06:31.240, Speaker D: Puzzle master stumped us.
00:06:32.170 - 00:06:44.494, Speaker C: This is again, this is hill Bobby. This is tornado cash. TVL by chain. You see that big drop in August when the sanctions hit? So we did come back to regulation a little bit.
00:06:44.532 - 00:06:45.120, Speaker B: Sorry.
00:06:45.650 - 00:06:53.086, Speaker C: And then these other chains. So sort of popping off. Obviously, it's highly correlated with the price of ether, but you kind of see.
00:06:53.268 - 00:06:59.246, Speaker B: It'S like the daily per chain really threw us off. The daily per chain really got TVL.
00:06:59.278 - 00:07:00.242, Speaker D: And daily don't go together.
00:07:00.296 - 00:07:02.114, Speaker B: That was yeah.
00:07:02.232 - 00:07:03.730, Speaker C: I'm going to give this feedback.
00:07:04.310 - 00:07:22.138, Speaker A: So actually, one interesting question to me is where is the BNB bridge hack? Do you remember when that was? Because I'm curious if you notice the BNB percentage is going up toward the last I'm wondering if the BNB bridge hacker is part of the reason for that.
00:07:22.224 - 00:07:41.802, Speaker B: Well, the BNB part also does look pretty stable, actually. So I think it was just like that's when BNB launched, because initially it was ethereum, only it doesn't look like BNB grew or changed that much. It grew a little bit, I think, after July, ironically, after the sanctions hit. But overall, I think around the same slice.
00:07:41.866 - 00:07:50.818, Speaker C: That's natural, though, right? Because the BNB deployment was not sanctioned, but the ethereum deployment was, which doesn't really make a lot of oh, I.
00:07:50.824 - 00:07:56.306, Speaker B: Didn'T think about that. It's the only legal place where you can interact with tornado cash is on BNB chain.
00:07:56.338 - 00:07:57.334, Speaker D: Legally. Yeah, sure.
00:07:57.452 - 00:07:59.826, Speaker C: It's not not illegal or it's not not legal.
00:07:59.938 - 00:08:01.986, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay. Understood.
00:08:02.098 - 00:08:03.730, Speaker A: OFAC loves binance.
00:08:03.810 - 00:08:04.294, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:08:04.412 - 00:08:07.270, Speaker D: I think they're trying to advantage foreign actors.
00:08:11.610 - 00:08:12.646, Speaker A: So there we go.
00:08:12.748 - 00:08:16.646, Speaker C: That was one. Do you guys want to do another one? Or is that too painful?
00:08:16.758 - 00:08:21.690, Speaker B: Let's do one more. I'm sure the audio listeners are loving this, by the way. This is, like, a very audio friendly format.
00:08:21.850 - 00:08:23.742, Speaker A: There's going to be a lot of editing for this.
00:08:23.796 - 00:08:25.310, Speaker D: Yeah. Hide your private keys.
00:08:27.890 - 00:08:29.600, Speaker B: There's a big hat going around.
00:08:31.410 - 00:08:32.830, Speaker D: Should we talk about it?
00:08:32.980 - 00:08:37.410, Speaker A: Can we talk about the ledger ad? The chain thing?
00:08:37.560 - 00:08:38.194, Speaker B: Oh, yeah.
00:08:38.232 - 00:08:43.774, Speaker D: Where ledger is telling you to buy a new jewelry necklace and hang your ledger wallet around the neck.
00:08:43.902 - 00:08:46.482, Speaker A: That might be the greatest gorilla marketing ever.
00:08:46.536 - 00:08:48.050, Speaker B: Okay, what are we looking at?
00:08:48.120 - 00:09:29.234, Speaker C: This is a time series with a bunch of layer ones on them from January 2022 to April 2023. Yes. We have arbitram StarkNet optimism loop ring aztec connect polygon ZK EVM ZK sync lite ZK sync era and then trend wise, it's kind of neck and neck, arbitram and optimism both hovering around this. In aggregate, about two k, each contributing about 1000 kind of dips during the summer of 2022. And then going into 2023, start growing again. Arbitrum growing a little bit more. And some of these other layer twos contributing more to the pie, exceeding three k in March and April 2023.
00:09:29.352 - 00:09:39.974, Speaker B: All right, so this looks like a TVL of layer two's chart, except the units are off. Right? The units go from zero to 3000. That's correct. Maybe it's like TVL and Ether turn.
00:09:40.012 - 00:09:44.946, Speaker D: There's like, ether number of number of contracts deployed.
00:09:45.138 - 00:09:48.678, Speaker A: Or daily users? No, the daily user is higher than this, right?
00:09:48.764 - 00:09:54.022, Speaker B: Yeah, daily. That's too low for daily. 3000 is definitely a lot more than 3000 daily.
00:09:54.166 - 00:09:59.398, Speaker D: There's a lot of activity in the most recent month on ZK Sync, ZK.
00:09:59.414 - 00:10:00.558, Speaker B: Sync grew in TBL a lot.
00:10:00.564 - 00:10:06.430, Speaker A: So they're like that's also where all the people are trying to AirDrop farm the most.
00:10:06.500 - 00:10:08.202, Speaker D: Oh, speculative AirDrop.
00:10:08.266 - 00:10:10.640, Speaker A: Yeah, speculative AirDrop farming. Yeah.
00:10:11.410 - 00:10:18.194, Speaker B: It looks very proportional to TVL. So there's something that is correlated with TVL, but is very different.
00:10:18.232 - 00:10:22.942, Speaker D: Units, active Developers, GitHub activates.
00:10:23.006 - 00:10:25.614, Speaker B: You can't track that on Dune. How are you tracking that on Dune?
00:10:25.742 - 00:10:26.500, Speaker A: All right.
00:10:26.870 - 00:10:29.430, Speaker D: That's a good meta argument. Good meta argument.
00:10:30.010 - 00:10:31.158, Speaker B: There you go.
00:10:31.324 - 00:10:40.150, Speaker A: The only reason I'm not sure about whether this is total amount of ETH is that not all of these chains pay gas in ETH, if I remember correctly.
00:10:40.310 - 00:10:41.898, Speaker D: No, it can't be ETH, but they.
00:10:41.904 - 00:10:43.370, Speaker B: Got to be I don't think it's.
00:10:43.790 - 00:10:47.114, Speaker A: They can be wrapping small.
00:10:47.152 - 00:10:49.350, Speaker C: Keep pulling that thread. Keep pulling that thread.
00:10:49.430 - 00:10:51.950, Speaker B: Keep pulling that thread. Tarun, pull the thread.
00:10:53.090 - 00:10:57.934, Speaker D: This is like a chart murder mystery that's unfolding for our audience in real time.
00:10:58.132 - 00:10:59.822, Speaker C: I'm like the dungeon master right now.
00:10:59.876 - 00:11:00.782, Speaker B: Yeah, that was good.
00:11:00.836 - 00:11:03.040, Speaker D: Roll a D 20 torn. See what happens.
00:11:03.730 - 00:11:15.970, Speaker B: Is it inflows? Maybe it's like monthly inflows because all these I mean, I think that numbers have been going up basically pretty continuously. But no, that doesn't make any sense. Maybe it does.
00:11:16.040 - 00:11:18.930, Speaker D: September 22 is sort of like the bottom of this chart.
00:11:19.010 - 00:11:21.830, Speaker A: All the Salana TVL clearly moved here.
00:11:21.980 - 00:11:33.980, Speaker B: Whatever this is, because one K ether is like a million dollars. That is not it's way too small. Right. So what is this one K thing? Is it bridge in events, maybe? No, that's too small.
00:11:34.590 - 00:11:42.538, Speaker A: I do kind of like this new contracts deployed or number of contracts interacted with or something that kind of could be in this range.
00:11:42.634 - 00:11:45.034, Speaker B: Contracts deployed does make sense. Unique contracts.
00:11:45.082 - 00:11:47.834, Speaker A: Maybe unique touched contracts.
00:11:47.882 - 00:11:49.934, Speaker C: Touched per can.
00:11:49.972 - 00:11:54.698, Speaker A: Yeah, you can count which contracts were touched. And maybe this is bridge contract.
00:11:54.874 - 00:11:58.610, Speaker D: I was going to make a joke about where Turin touched the contract, but it's not funny.
00:12:00.550 - 00:12:04.898, Speaker B: All right, I'm going to go. Final answer. You need contracts interacted with per month.
00:12:05.064 - 00:12:10.726, Speaker D: My guess is going to be number of contracts deployed per month.
00:12:10.908 - 00:12:17.094, Speaker A: My joke guess because I sort of think that's one of the latter two is number of Rug pulls per month.
00:12:17.292 - 00:12:26.634, Speaker C: That is correct, Tarun. It's number of Rug pulls per month. No, it's cost of publishing transaction data to a layer one by layer twos per month.
00:12:26.752 - 00:12:28.154, Speaker B: Yeah. Wait, what?
00:12:28.192 - 00:12:32.254, Speaker D: I was thinking along those lines, but I was like, I don't know if they would actually be able to get that.
00:12:32.372 - 00:12:43.342, Speaker B: Oh, the total price paid in aggregate of posting call data to layer one over that. See? I see. Okay, so that's actually quite interesting.
00:12:43.476 - 00:12:50.354, Speaker A: Are we saying Celestia is going to be making getting to a 3 million run rate per month?
00:12:50.392 - 00:13:04.662, Speaker B: Well, no lower right, for the same amount of demand just to get the benchmark numbers right now? Because it's actually kind of interesting. If you go back, I think it's about 1000 on Arbitrum. So Arbitrum is paying about what, $2 million a month to post call data. Optimism post.
00:13:04.716 - 00:13:06.760, Speaker C: Right now it's 1800. So it's almost four mil.
00:13:07.690 - 00:13:20.060, Speaker B: Okay, so closer to four mil per month. Optimism is about 1000. So that's about ten mil. And darknet 93 e. So that's like, what, 100K or something? Or 200K.
00:13:20.670 - 00:13:21.274, Speaker C: Deal.
00:13:21.392 - 00:13:22.330, Speaker B: Fascinating.
00:13:23.250 - 00:13:27.246, Speaker C: Okay, ZK sync is at 500.
00:13:27.428 - 00:13:29.326, Speaker B: Yeah, era. So era is at 500.
00:13:29.428 - 00:14:01.522, Speaker A: By the way, we should maybe explain what this payments are for. Layer twos have some state management that they have to do on the layer one. The sequencer who's managing the state of the layer two has to post storage calls and other types of calls if there's a fraud proof, but there's not in any of these. And so that's what Haseeb was referring to as call data is sort of the data that they have to post. It's kind of interesting that ZK Sync had such high cost growth relative to Polygon.
00:14:01.666 - 00:14:12.574, Speaker B: Polygon still has very low usage. I think Zkvl I think their TVL is like 30 million or something compared to ZK Syncs, like 250,000,000. But all these are like super young still.
00:14:12.692 - 00:14:29.314, Speaker D: Here's a trivia question for you. If all of these L2 S are spending about 3000 Ether a month on the L One Ethereum, what do you think the total Ether spent in transactions on the L One would be? In the absence of all of these.
00:14:29.352 - 00:14:32.850, Speaker B: L two S. The question like, how much are they siphoning demand from the layer one?
00:14:32.920 - 00:14:51.306, Speaker C: Yeah, I kind of believe in the induced demand theory where it's like a lot of the shit that's happening on layer twos is like goofy NFT stuff for people that would probably not happen on Ethereum today at these gas prices. And so it's like you actually just capture this new market that would be priced out.
00:14:51.328 - 00:15:04.522, Speaker B: Otherwise it can't be that there's nothing siphoned but there obviously is some new activity that only makes sense at a lower price point. It's funny, I was getting an argument with Calcimani about this over telegram which is always the best place to have arguments.
00:15:04.586 - 00:15:07.642, Speaker A: He's a big layer two token bull short ETH.
00:15:07.786 - 00:15:47.386, Speaker B: Yes. He was making this big argument that the trade to do is to go long. The L two S and go short. Ether and he thinks like the L two S are going to siphon all this, but they're going to suck up all the value because ultimately they're closer to the user and users are going to interact more with L two S. And basically the floor is just going to drop out from under it because it's ultimately the L two S that are going to be valuable because they're directly user facing and they own the applications. I thought this was kind of nonsense and so my counterpoint to this. Well, first of all I'm curious, does that hold any valence for you guys? This idea that the layer two S are actually potentially going to accrue more value than the layer one? If that's where the applications live, that's where all the users interact with, it's possible.
00:15:47.488 - 00:16:27.170, Speaker D: I mean I'm not going to say that his theory is automatically a good one, but if the applications are living on the L two S and to Tom's point, you can have applications that couldn't exist on the L ones, then there'll probably be a lot of value accruing to the L two. But is it stealing value from the L one? Is it adding more usage and importance to the L one? I don't know. I mean with the switch to full proof of stake you could also argue the exact opposite is that the L one is the economic security for all of the L two S and it will be significantly larger.
00:16:27.330 - 00:17:05.666, Speaker A: Another thing to consider here is the main layer ones themselves are actually quite worried about this and there's been a bunch of designs of things where the fees from the L two flow back more to the L one. So there's a thing called a based roll up from Justin Drake and the idea is basically to have some revenue share between the L one in ETH's case and the L two S and sort of like trying to force that. So it is interesting that some of the ETH researchers are actually sort of in the Somani camp that the L one needs to get some revenue from the L two.
00:17:05.848 - 00:17:26.490, Speaker B: I would say that if you believe that's true, if you believe the L two S are siphoning value from the layer one, then that means, it sort of implies that you should also believe that lightning makes bitcoin less valuable because lightning is ultimately siphoning transaction fees from the layer one. It's got the same kind of substitution effect which makes bitcoin less valuable.
00:17:26.910 - 00:17:29.222, Speaker C: That would be true if bitcoin had transaction fees.
00:17:29.286 - 00:17:30.682, Speaker D: Yeah, I was about to say the same thing.
00:17:30.736 - 00:17:35.694, Speaker B: Yes, it's supposed to. Right? It does. And ultimately, bitcoin is used to pay.
00:17:35.732 - 00:17:43.274, Speaker A: Fees with but you don't really use it for data availability in a dynamically posted manner like you do with Ethereum.
00:17:43.322 - 00:17:43.486, Speaker B: Right?
00:17:43.508 - 00:17:57.906, Speaker A: Like Lightning transactions are like I do a time lock at one point and I close a time lock another point. Everything stays off chain. There's not as much dynamic state updating. I mean, there's basically none. There's like two UTX, sure, but it.
00:17:57.928 - 00:18:05.602, Speaker B: Is in the end siphoning demand for layer one transactions. Right? Like otherwise you'd be directly transacting on bitcoin if you couldn't use lightning to settle bitcoin.
00:18:05.666 - 00:18:09.286, Speaker A: That hasn't been bitcoin's problem for years, though, that is I agree.
00:18:09.388 - 00:18:48.978, Speaker B: Look, I'm not arguing that's a bitcoin's problem, but I am saying that if you are going to be consistent with that view that a substitution effect for demand for transactions lowers the value of the underlying layer one, then you should believe that lightning drives down the value of bitcoin. And that doesn't seem plausible to me. The other thing, of course, that on these layer twos Ether in its sort of cash flow element, which is just how much Ether gets burned because of transaction fees on layer one. But then there's also the element of Ether as a form of money, which I would argue today is where the lion's share of its value comes from, just because the transaction fees demonstrably are not that big. And on the L two S like ETH is money. On all the L two S, ETH is what everyone uses. People don't use rap bitcoin, they don't use ARB token on the layer two S as their form of money, they use Ether.
00:18:48.978 - 00:19:04.874, Speaker B: And so, if anything, these are Etherized economies that are actually expanding the universe through which Ether is used, right. In the same way. Like, look, there are many ways to make the dollar valuable. One way is to grow the GDP of the US economy, another way is to increase the tax rate. Another way is to get other people to use dollars.
00:19:04.992 - 00:19:10.454, Speaker A: Do you think ETH held on layer twos is like a euro dollar? It's sort of like yes, totally.
00:19:10.502 - 00:19:12.490, Speaker B: That's a great analogy. That's a great analogy.
00:19:12.570 - 00:19:24.794, Speaker D: Yes, but only if the time and cost bridge is full of friction. If it's literally extremely low friction to move Ether in and out, then it's the same asset.
00:19:24.922 - 00:19:53.354, Speaker C: I agree with the seems bigger point here, which is like, if you think about what factors go into Ether's value today, it's like 95, 99% this moneyness. And then like a small percentage sort of the transaction fees and the burn and a lot of the economics that go into it. And it's like crypto people always sort of fall for this, oh, well, this asset has these flows and let's do a discounted cash flow analysis. And it's like maybe that's true for a very small number of assets, but for the most part it's sort of this other thing.
00:19:53.472 - 00:20:26.846, Speaker A: I mean, one question, and I was talking about this with a bunch of people working on who believe in the like there will be 5 million roll ups world, how does the user end up managing the UX for this? None of the wallets that exist can really handle multi roll ups right now at all. It's so clunky, right? You're like going in changing RPCs. Some of them make you pay gas and native tokens, some make you pay in ETH. That part is still very confusing to me and that's where I kind of can agree with the solana maxis of like the UX is much easier in monolithic for the world.
00:20:26.968 - 00:21:02.320, Speaker D: This is not a dunk on Cosmos, but I personally find the Cosmos ecosystem, UX with multiple different chains to be literally impossible as a user. I think to Tarune's point, if you have 1000 L two S, it's going to be the same user experience where it's like, yes, it's possible to move between any two of them and all of these things. But what wallet software is going to make this easy and intuitive and how are you going to do it? It's already hard. My network drop down just on the EVM chains in MetaMask is like too long.
00:21:02.690 - 00:21:28.662, Speaker A: And if you think about it, in Ventureland, there have been sort of tens of companies founded for doing roll up as a service so that developers can start their own roll up, like the way they start an Amazon web service. Great, you can make your own blockchain easily, but then it's like no one is really funding wallets focused or even just some layer for making it easy for the end user. So I think that's going to be a big thing.
00:21:28.716 - 00:22:18.834, Speaker B: Now, part of the I totally agree with you, Tarun. We funded a company recently called Caldera that does exactly this, does like layer two as a service. The difficulty, like you said, is that getting a bunch of layer twos up and running now, it's kind of doable we have the open source stack? Obviously, optimism is today the kind of hot stack de jour that people are using, but actually managing assets across a gajillion chains. Super sucks. And of course, we just had tax day in the US very recently. And obviously if you're trying to pay taxes across assets in 16 different ecosystems, it's horrendous task, much less just being able to manage your own assets across all of them. And so I do think that at some point when the landscape settles down and the number of stacks settles down, there are definitely going to be software solutions that pop up that start to get smarter about managing your assets.
00:22:18.834 - 00:22:50.526, Speaker B: What you pay gas with Metatransactions across different chains like consolidating assets for you and also helping and making it easier to do accounting across all your different chains. That stuff will come up as the kind of space of chains stabilizes or the number of stacks stabilizes, but right now there's still like super high flux and so anybody who's like, okay, I know exactly what I want to build for. I think people still don't know. It's still very much a moving target. A lot of people are like, okay, well, Solana is winning. I better build a bunch of tools for Solana. Or other people were like, oh, well, Cosmos seems to be taking over the world.
00:22:50.526 - 00:23:08.038, Speaker B: I should build for Cosmos chains. And now roll ups are the thing. It's like, okay, should I build this tooling for roll ups? I think if you give it a couple of years, we're going to see some stabilization in the chains that people use and like less turnover in the top ten chains by TVL. But over the last couple of years it's been so volatile, I don't know how you would know what to work on.
00:23:08.204 - 00:23:33.406, Speaker A: My suspicion is that there will be a lot of venture funding going into the moving up the stack. There's been so much money focused on infrastructure in the last twelve months and people are going to be like, oh shit, we actually need to really fund the basic new wallets and stuff like that, instead of because it doesn't feel like the existing wallets are willing to change their experience enough to handle this type of world.
00:23:33.508 - 00:24:21.598, Speaker B: Part of it is fear too, right? The deeper you get into the guts of making decisions on behalf of users, the more risk there is for mistakes. For hacks, there's just more surface area to mess things up. I mean, there was all this news this week about really crazy hacks that nobody seems to know where they're coming from. Taylor Monahan, who was on the show recently, was talking about this crazy web of old addresses that don't seem to have any Ostensible connections to each other, many of which were super sophisticated, quote unquote cold wallet, quote unquote addresses that have been just getting sweeped by the same attacker. I've been getting more paranoid over the last just like last month, I guess. I don't know if you guys are feeling similarly, but more and more I just get paranoid about like, I don't know, attackers are getting better and smarter and more sophisticated than before.
00:24:21.764 - 00:25:14.830, Speaker D: Well, they absolutely are. I mean, the underlying technology of security is not improving, but there's more sophistication outside that is improving. We were joking around know, ledger putting a really stupid ad on Twitter of like, buy the necklace keychain for your crypto hardware wallet. And that's obviously security moving backwards, but security in my mind is moving flat and there's more sophistication around how to break security every single month. And I think a lot of it falls is rooted in human error in a lot of places. And I think a lot of it's in exposing zero days, so to speak. But I definitely think that over time, security is not fundamentally improving and there's not enough work spent on fundamentally improving the security architecture of crypto.
00:25:15.330 - 00:25:33.970, Speaker B: I also think that large language models are going to be really good at attacking contracts, and they're going to be like I think the natural advantage to attack versus defense is going to grow with large language models because I think it's a lot easier for a large language model to find a vulnerability than it is for a large language model to fix a vulnerability.
00:25:34.130 - 00:25:36.520, Speaker A: Finally, the cardano. Stans. Can.
00:25:41.130 - 00:25:41.906, Speaker B: I see?
00:25:42.028 - 00:25:44.090, Speaker C: Peer reviewed, formally verified.
00:25:45.310 - 00:25:48.860, Speaker B: Okay, got it. Well, that's itself, right?
00:25:49.230 - 00:25:49.866, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah.
00:25:49.888 - 00:25:58.398, Speaker A: Well, the programming language that no one could use and at one point only had one transaction per block because the Eutxo thing was messed up, but yes.
00:25:58.564 - 00:26:01.082, Speaker B: Cardano. Okay. Okay. Cardano.
00:26:01.226 - 00:26:05.694, Speaker A: These charts seem to have brought out the animal spirits. So what's the next?
00:26:05.812 - 00:26:07.186, Speaker B: They're doing a good job waking us up.
00:26:07.208 - 00:26:09.086, Speaker C: I didn't know you guys wanted another chart.
00:26:09.118 - 00:26:16.820, Speaker B: All right. It's kind of like one of those Rorschach tests where you look at a chart and it brings up all the stuff inside you.
00:26:17.510 - 00:26:18.470, Speaker C: That is true.
00:26:18.620 - 00:26:25.126, Speaker B: Yeah. I like it. I feel like this is a good psychological test for how you feel about crypto. Yeah.
00:26:25.148 - 00:26:28.380, Speaker D: It's the least fun party game that you can try at home.
00:26:30.510 - 00:26:32.778, Speaker B: You have no idea what tarune's parties are like.
00:26:32.944 - 00:26:43.340, Speaker A: Did we need a disclaimer for the listeners to trigger? Warning. We're going to be playing the worst party game, but we're saving you from playing it. Do not attempt on your own.
00:26:43.790 - 00:26:47.502, Speaker B: I actually would be super down for this party game if it was actually like a party game.
00:26:47.636 - 00:26:53.310, Speaker D: I mean, we're like four crypto venture investors. We're like I think some of the only people that find this amusing.
00:26:54.290 - 00:26:55.598, Speaker C: I think I got a new one.
00:26:55.684 - 00:26:55.982, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:26:56.036 - 00:27:01.780, Speaker C: Actually, this one, I don't even have the labels on it. Are you going to be okay with that? Is that going to be too hard? Otherwise, I think it's too obvious.
00:27:02.230 - 00:27:05.230, Speaker B: Let's go. No labels. I'm feeling risky tonight.
00:27:05.390 - 00:27:16.070, Speaker A: I will say one thing. My first boss ever, very nice guy, was billionaire. The one thing he would fire people for on the spot was no units on their labels.
00:27:16.410 - 00:27:22.898, Speaker C: That's legit. No units fired on the spot. I'm okay with that.
00:27:23.004 - 00:27:26.230, Speaker D: If it just said, like, 100, 200, 300, he was like, you're fired.
00:27:26.310 - 00:27:27.306, Speaker B: Leave. Yeah. All right.
00:27:27.328 - 00:27:28.454, Speaker D: So is Tom fired?
00:27:28.502 - 00:27:33.658, Speaker B: Really is a party game. Wow. Well, there are units on the X axis.
00:27:33.834 - 00:27:34.318, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:27:34.404 - 00:27:44.622, Speaker D: All right, let's describe the chart so the listeners can understand what we're looking at, because we all just said, like, whoa. So the chart starts in January 2009.
00:27:44.676 - 00:27:51.518, Speaker B: So my hunch this is called a whale fin chart. I believe that's what this is called. Or shark fin. Sorry. Shark fin. Shark fin. Chart.
00:27:51.694 - 00:27:59.094, Speaker D: My hunch is that we're thinking something in the bitcoin ecosystem, because the chart starts in 2009, and I don't think we would go all the way back.
00:27:59.292 - 00:28:00.498, Speaker B: If we weren't serious. Dude.
00:28:00.514 - 00:28:02.306, Speaker C: Observation, observation.
00:28:02.338 - 00:28:27.962, Speaker D: Roberts so it looks like there's, like, no activity for 20 09, 20 10, 20 11, 20 12, 2013. There's basically no activity on this until 2019. And then it starts to go way up. It peaks in, like, November 21, december 21, and then it goes back down to about half of its peak. And it looks truly like a shark fin. It's very symmetrical. It almost looks like a normal distribution.
00:28:28.106 - 00:28:38.162, Speaker B: And there's also four colors, but we don't have the legend, so we don't know what those four colors correspond to. But it's mostly one color. It's like 90%. One color.
00:28:38.296 - 00:28:38.930, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:28:39.080 - 00:28:39.490, Speaker B: Okay.
00:28:39.560 - 00:28:51.266, Speaker D: We were talking about lightning before. My hunch is that this is a chart that has something to do with lightning or like a bitcoin type of transaction.
00:28:51.458 - 00:28:54.546, Speaker A: Number of lightning nodes by client.
00:28:54.738 - 00:28:56.114, Speaker D: Yeah, it could be based on client.
00:28:56.162 - 00:29:05.446, Speaker B: It could be like 300,000 lightning nodes. It maxes at 300,000. That's too many. When the SegWit was 2017?
00:29:05.558 - 00:29:08.186, Speaker D: Yeah, I don't know. Okay, I'm just throwing ideas out.
00:29:08.208 - 00:29:18.302, Speaker A: No, but actually, I remember finance only supported SegWit deposits and withdrawals in 2020. I remember there are a lot of people on Twitter bitcoin maxis, complaining and yelling at CZ about this.
00:29:18.436 - 00:29:21.934, Speaker B: Yeah, but the chart looks like zero. It doesn't even look like it does.
00:29:21.972 - 00:29:24.606, Speaker D: The chart looks like zero until like, 2000.
00:29:24.628 - 00:29:27.758, Speaker A: And how about number of channels instead of number of nodes?
00:29:27.774 - 00:29:31.682, Speaker B: I can see channels. I think channels makes sense, but channel.
00:29:31.736 - 00:29:34.690, Speaker A: By client, that's what I'm trying to figure out.
00:29:34.840 - 00:29:41.110, Speaker B: Or maybe by capacity of the channel. And gray is like zero to 100 or something.
00:29:41.180 - 00:29:45.842, Speaker A: And then 300K BTC is like 1.5 billion.
00:29:45.986 - 00:29:55.514, Speaker B: No, I'm saying that it's the number of channels, but the colors are the capacity of the channel. They're like class sizes. Right? So, like, small, medium, big?
00:29:55.632 - 00:30:01.722, Speaker A: Has lightning capacity ever been over a billion? Because 300K BTC is a lot.
00:30:01.856 - 00:30:10.142, Speaker B: No, I'm saying the units are not the units are number of channels. The colors are corresponding to the size.
00:30:10.196 - 00:30:11.386, Speaker D: I don't think there's that many channels.
00:30:11.418 - 00:30:11.934, Speaker B: That's a lot.
00:30:11.972 - 00:30:18.562, Speaker A: I don't think there's that many channels either, because aren't most of the channels like, bit refill and like, nothing else? That's what I remember.
00:30:18.696 - 00:30:19.874, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it goes up to.
00:30:19.912 - 00:30:23.874, Speaker D: 300,000 whenever the also, what's this green thing?
00:30:23.912 - 00:30:28.898, Speaker A: That was like, eating up demand through 2021 and then shrunk.
00:30:28.994 - 00:30:37.902, Speaker B: Indeed. I feel like this the green thing is kind of weird going way down right now. Okay, Tom, give us a hint. Can you give us a hint?
00:30:37.986 - 00:30:42.982, Speaker C: You are correct. It is something related to the bitcoin ecosystem or related related to bitcoin.
00:30:43.126 - 00:30:48.042, Speaker A: Okay, what about wrapped BTC type?
00:30:48.096 - 00:30:49.210, Speaker B: Wrapped BTC?
00:30:49.970 - 00:30:55.230, Speaker D: That's an interesting guess. I don't think there's 300. There might be 300,000.
00:30:55.300 - 00:30:56.574, Speaker B: There were more.
00:30:56.772 - 00:31:05.390, Speaker A: Yeah. Rap BTC. It might have been more, but, like, maybe Ren BTC.
00:31:05.830 - 00:31:10.850, Speaker D: No, they never got that high 300,000. Bitcoin is a lot of bitcoin.
00:31:11.270 - 00:31:16.290, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay. All right, Tom. Next hint.
00:31:17.510 - 00:31:21.410, Speaker C: I don't think I can give another hint because I thought that was a pretty big hint.
00:31:21.490 - 00:31:23.046, Speaker B: I'm tapped. What is it?
00:31:23.068 - 00:31:23.990, Speaker D: Yeah, what's the answer?
00:31:24.140 - 00:31:24.834, Speaker B: Boom.
00:31:24.962 - 00:31:27.218, Speaker C: It is bitcoin on ethereum.
00:31:27.314 - 00:31:28.394, Speaker B: We were right there.
00:31:28.512 - 00:31:28.938, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:31:29.024 - 00:31:33.478, Speaker B: All right, so WBTC plus renBTC plus everything. Okay, so it's like wrapped bitcoin.
00:31:33.654 - 00:31:34.678, Speaker A: HBTC.
00:31:34.774 - 00:31:36.598, Speaker C: Do not forget HBTC.
00:31:36.774 - 00:31:43.242, Speaker A: Also, the WBTC numbers off ETH are sort of messed up post FTX.
00:31:43.306 - 00:31:43.582, Speaker B: Right.
00:31:43.636 - 00:31:47.550, Speaker A: Because they minted a bunch of stuff that wasn't collateralized.
00:31:48.690 - 00:31:51.146, Speaker C: Solid stuff. Yeah, that was solid.
00:31:51.258 - 00:32:00.738, Speaker A: But the weird thing is the solid and WBTC pools were sort of, like, drained to zero. Also, it got a little dicey on.
00:32:00.824 - 00:32:01.170, Speaker B: Interesting.
00:32:01.240 - 00:32:02.862, Speaker A: Right around the good chart.
00:32:02.926 - 00:32:03.630, Speaker D: Good chart.
00:32:03.710 - 00:32:04.946, Speaker A: That one was good.
00:32:05.128 - 00:32:07.730, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, okay. That's solid.
00:32:08.070 - 00:32:12.662, Speaker A: I was also about to be, like, did dune index lightning? No way.
00:32:12.796 - 00:32:17.282, Speaker B: Yeah, actually, now that you say that, I'm like it doesn't seem like that would be an easy thing for dune index.
00:32:17.426 - 00:32:23.340, Speaker C: Yeah, I don't think they have lightning, but they do have just general bitcoin data now, so I want to look at Ordinal stuff.
00:32:23.870 - 00:32:27.882, Speaker A: Yeah, that's right. There were ordinals Well, I'm actually most.
00:32:27.936 - 00:32:39.994, Speaker D: Interested in the fact that that chart has basically halved in the past year or so. There's a lot of BTC that was on ethereum that is no longer on ethereum, which is probably the most interesting takeaway.
00:32:40.122 - 00:32:40.558, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:32:40.644 - 00:32:42.302, Speaker A: Where did that BTC go?
00:32:42.436 - 00:32:47.342, Speaker D: Just back to bitcoin FTX, for sure. Alameda SBF.
00:32:47.406 - 00:32:49.534, Speaker B: I don't think it's half of the outstanding bitcoin.
00:32:49.582 - 00:32:50.530, Speaker D: That was a joke.
00:32:50.950 - 00:32:51.410, Speaker B: Okay.
00:32:51.480 - 00:33:04.982, Speaker C: Yeah, because it peaked in April 2022 or May 2022. Oh, and then it was HBTC is basically nothing now. And then WBTC also fell quite a bit.
00:33:05.116 - 00:33:13.962, Speaker B: It must be tied to lenders in some way. Yeah, a lot of the lenders probably had to like a lot of the lenders were using this stuff to get yield on.
00:33:14.096 - 00:33:18.010, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. They were farming on your behalf.
00:33:18.990 - 00:33:20.266, Speaker C: You could probably go check, too.
00:33:20.288 - 00:33:20.426, Speaker B: Right.
00:33:20.448 - 00:33:24.894, Speaker C: Because the WBTC redemptions are on chain. You can just see who's redeeming it.
00:33:24.932 - 00:33:27.694, Speaker D: That probably was Celsius and FTX and.
00:33:27.892 - 00:33:32.990, Speaker B: Genesis BlockFi, all those guys who are finding ways to get yield with their BTC.
00:33:33.070 - 00:33:36.062, Speaker D: The dinosaur graveyard of indeed.
00:33:36.206 - 00:33:50.280, Speaker B: Indeed. Yeah. It's very sad. Do any of you guys know, is lending making a comeback? Are people putting their boots on again and facing the world? Or is lending just like kind of dead centralized lending? Centralized lending. Yeah.
00:33:52.650 - 00:33:56.018, Speaker A: E five lending is going up a little bit because of staked ETH.
00:33:56.114 - 00:34:23.440, Speaker B: Yeah, interesting. I would think that okay. There's like an extinction level event. There's no more yield. Like, now it feels like a time that somebody should come in and start cleaning up and just offering fairly low rates, pocketing big spreads, the lack of competition seems like it'd be a great time for somebody to come into the lending space. Why isn't that happening? And also, okay, the risk free rate on dollars is high, but the rate on crypto assets is low.
00:34:25.410 - 00:34:42.386, Speaker D: I guess one of the things that would make it hard for a centralized lender is the fact that right now, borrowing costs in DeFi are hilariously low. It's cheaper to borrow in DeFi than it is borrowing costs in DeFi below the fed funds rate. It literally violates a lot of the laws of financial physics.
00:34:42.418 - 00:34:46.326, Speaker A: Yeah, I think you basically need rates to go down a bit.
00:34:46.428 - 00:35:06.574, Speaker C: I've actually been thinking about this recently, Robert, to your point. There are hundreds of millions or billions of dollars in USDC sitting in ave and compound earning one and a half percent. Are these people who are using these as collateral? Are these people USDC that's stuck? Like, why is this here?
00:35:06.692 - 00:36:00.206, Speaker D: Yeah, it's a great question. So, I mean, there is so many stablecoins earning so little in DFI. I think the reason it's there is because it's better than bridging it back to TradFi to get 4.7% or 4.1% on your Apple account or whatever is in the headlines lately, because it takes days to go back and forth, typically, and people want to have their stable coins available to buy the dip or invest in crypto. They don't actually want to leave the crypto asset purchasing ecosystem because crypto is still so volatile that if you can buy crypto and sell it for 1% higher, that's more money than you're expecting to make off of rates anyway. And you have all these people buying and selling crypto and just having it so readily available to take advantage of.
00:36:00.206 - 00:36:59.086, Speaker D: Like today, ether dropped 6%. That's more than a year of interest for someone who was in stables and was able to buy it and is looking to sell it higher just in terms of that human market making, the expected returns are probably higher than the difficulty of moving into TradFi, missing an opportunity, whatever. If you have stables, it's because you like crypto, you like crypto assets, you like to be able to trade in them and participate in them and all of these things. And it still is super high friction to move it back to TradFi and back to crypto. And so there's a glut of stable coins in crypto that earn way less than the risk free rate. And I think people are mostly okay with that, where they're saying, hey, I'll just earn 1% or 2% because I know I can just turn it into ether and bitcoin in a second's notice in one block if I need to. And that's extremely valuable.
00:36:59.086 - 00:37:01.246, Speaker D: And the reason why they're not bringing.
00:37:01.278 - 00:37:10.510, Speaker A: It out of crypto, one funny thing, right, is like, we're pretty close to the all time high, actually, of total stable coins, right?
00:37:10.680 - 00:37:12.406, Speaker D: It's like 118,000,000,000 right now.
00:37:12.428 - 00:37:18.706, Speaker A: I think 131, according to DFI llama.
00:37:18.898 - 00:37:20.886, Speaker D: Pull up the DFI llama chart, Tom.
00:37:20.988 - 00:37:21.302, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:37:21.356 - 00:37:35.822, Speaker A: This one, the DFI llama stablecoin chart, is actually kind of I mean, you can just see tether completely crushing it. That's the number one thing here. You just see, like, tether and USDC going in, like, complete opposite directions at the end.
00:37:35.876 - 00:37:36.574, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:37:36.772 - 00:37:44.142, Speaker A: Because it's crazy. Tether is near its all time high. It's, like, not very far from its all time. It's only a couple of billion dollars away.
00:37:44.196 - 00:37:44.414, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:37:44.452 - 00:37:50.050, Speaker D: And USDC is quite far from its all time high. It's about half of its all time high.
00:37:50.200 - 00:38:05.782, Speaker B: The other interesting thing is that there seems to be a pretty perfect substitution effect, is that the pie seems to be fixed of demand for stablecoins, at least at any given moment in time. And so when one's going up, the other is going down. It doesn't ever seem like they're that correlated. Except when the whole market's going up.
00:38:05.916 - 00:38:06.646, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:38:06.828 - 00:38:20.122, Speaker D: Mouse over April 22. One year ago, what was the total stable coins a year ago? Because there's 131 now. Let's add these up in our head real quick. It's like 161.
00:38:20.176 - 00:38:29.742, Speaker A: 75. Yes. It's not down that much compared to, say, like, BTC and ETH being down 50%.
00:38:29.876 - 00:38:30.560, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:38:31.570 - 00:38:33.040, Speaker C: Anymore. Look at that.
00:38:33.890 - 00:38:40.546, Speaker B: Oh, wow. We were off. Okay. It's 200 billion. So it's down about what, like no, market cap. Market cap.
00:38:40.568 - 00:38:41.214, Speaker D: Not TBL.
00:38:41.262 - 00:38:43.474, Speaker B: Yeah, market cap. Sorry.
00:38:43.512 - 00:38:47.960, Speaker A: Because did they include UST? That's sort of one of the weird parts of the data.
00:38:48.410 - 00:38:49.750, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. Terrorist.
00:38:50.250 - 00:38:51.746, Speaker A: Do we count UST?
00:38:51.858 - 00:38:53.240, Speaker C: I'm guessing they did.
00:38:53.850 - 00:38:54.214, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:38:54.252 - 00:38:55.846, Speaker A: I just don't know whether because I.
00:38:55.868 - 00:38:58.430, Speaker B: Just don't know whether back to the non aggregated.
00:38:58.530 - 00:39:04.870, Speaker A: It'll show it does show USTC, which is UST. Classic. Which is, I guess, a successor.
00:39:05.030 - 00:39:08.074, Speaker C: Yeah. Look, 16 bill right there. Yeah.
00:39:08.272 - 00:39:09.020, Speaker B: Wow.
00:39:09.550 - 00:39:10.490, Speaker C: Dramatic.
00:39:10.830 - 00:39:16.000, Speaker B: So if you ignore that 16 billion, it's still down April 22.
00:39:17.330 - 00:39:25.200, Speaker C: April was 187, and then now we're at 131. So it's down 20 mil. 20 bill, something like that.
00:39:25.510 - 00:39:26.366, Speaker B: Yeah, minus.
00:39:26.398 - 00:39:33.410, Speaker A: But that's still not crazy, right? It was down a lot more. Yeah, it definitely feels like it's not so so crazy.
00:39:33.480 - 00:39:50.490, Speaker B: Actually. It looks like right when terra collapse was the all time high for stablecoin market cap, the total circulating supply. And since then, it's been, like, pretty stable after I mean, it's gone down. It's, like, kind of trickled down every month. 20 million. Yeah. But very slightly.
00:39:50.490 - 00:40:19.394, Speaker B: Not a very significant drawdown. I was just looking this up, Robbie. You're talking about the risk free rate and the ability to instantaneously transfer. Stablecoins in and out. I was just looking at what are the rates that big banks are paying on cash deposits as kind of the analogy of like, okay, you can instantly turn you get the optionality chase is paying 0.2% APY on cash right now. So actually, if you consider stablecoins to be cash, then actually they're getting higher yield than a bank account.
00:40:19.394 - 00:40:22.142, Speaker B: Still that's true. Chase might be unique.
00:40:22.286 - 00:40:27.046, Speaker D: Anyone with access to a brokerage account can get higher yield, which is why.
00:40:27.068 - 00:40:29.910, Speaker B: Right now, commercial bank deposits are kind of flying out.
00:40:30.060 - 00:40:35.238, Speaker D: Yeah, and it's why the profitability of the biggest banks like JPM should be going up.
00:40:35.324 - 00:40:43.130, Speaker B: Unfortunately, yes. According to the FDIC, the average APY across banks nationally is about 30 bips.
00:40:43.630 - 00:40:45.450, Speaker D: That's so pathetic.
00:40:45.790 - 00:40:55.420, Speaker B: That's crazy. Yeah, well, it turns out USDC is actually pretty good for being like, instantaneous cash account.
00:40:56.130 - 00:41:04.826, Speaker A: When do you think we'll be talking about tokenized Treasuries over tokenized stablecoins or like, something that's close to off chain yield?
00:41:04.938 - 00:41:24.306, Speaker D: I mean, I think over the next two years, some incredible things are going to come to market that change how we think about tokenized dollars versus tokenized yield. Right. I think it just needs to find a clear regulatory framework.
00:41:24.498 - 00:42:14.498, Speaker B: I think the issue with real world assets, broadly speaking, this is like super kind of thousand foot view, is that when we started, I remember when I first got into crypto, people used to talk about real world assets all the time, and that was like 2017. 2018. Right. It was a big narrative. And that's six years ago now. Jeez, at that time, I remember when people were tokenizing apartment complexes and they were putting them on the blockchain and being like, why isn't anyone buying my Miami apartment complex? And people found these very random things that were totally illiquid and very hard to value and a lot of local knowledge and were annoyed that, okay, I brought this thing on chain, I did all the legal work, and why isn't it magically liquid now? So I think people had this mental model that blockchains magically make things liquid, which is obviously bullshit. There's nothing magic about tokenization that makes illiquid things liquid.
00:42:14.498 - 00:42:36.314, Speaker B: And I think as a result, the order of operations through which blockchains approach real world assets was kind of inverted. We started with the most illiquid, hard to value things that very few people want to own, like a specific piece of real estate in a specific apartment complex or whatever. As opposed to, like, Treasuries. Right. Treasuries are the biggest market in the world. They're the biggest asset in the world. Huge amounts of demand.
00:42:36.314 - 00:43:24.190, Speaker B: Nobody has trouble underwriting Treasuries, but they haven't existed on the blockchain basically at all for the last, like, five years. Now, a big part of the reason for that was that yields on Treasuries were terrible. Right? They were basically 25 basis points for the longest time. And when on chain yields were dramatic, who cares? Why would you want to bring Treasuries on chain? Now? It feels like that's reversing right there's. Now, clearly more demand for Treasuries on chain. There are a few projects that are doing it, and you're seeing a lot of onchain growth in the demand for Treasuries. But more importantly, I think it shows that we're now thinking in the right order of operations about what kinds of real world assets need to build on chain and in what sequence they should be tokenized as opposed to starting with a PE fund or some random piece of real estate or some other random thing that nobody else wants and nobody else knows even what it is.
00:43:24.190 - 00:44:07.334, Speaker B: Starting with the biggest and most liquid assets and bringing them on chain and following that sequence of optionality such that eventually the marginal investor who's living in some random country around the world, it's like, okay, great, Treasuries, I know what that is. I can see why I'd want that as part of my portfolio. And then I might want this other thing and this other thing and this other thing. And you get this menu forming in a sensible way that builds up this impression of, like, hey, I can go on chain and I can buy the kinds of assets that I understand and care about as part of a sound financial portfolio as opposed to I go on chain and I can find dollars. And then really random stuff that some random entrepreneur decided they wanted tokenize. And then basically the crypto casino.
00:44:07.462 - 00:44:16.682, Speaker D: And in between we have NFTs, which I think are a really fun approximation of assets that are semi liquid on chain.
00:44:16.826 - 00:44:19.882, Speaker A: Yeah, well, we'll soon have the world coin orb identities.
00:44:20.026 - 00:44:21.898, Speaker D: When are they coming on chain?
00:44:22.074 - 00:44:29.726, Speaker A: I think they are on their own L two right now. Right, but is it POA? I think it's POA, though. I think the goal is for they'll be posted.
00:44:29.918 - 00:44:32.850, Speaker B: Wait, they're on an L two. That's POA, then. How's? It an L. Two.
00:44:33.000 - 00:44:35.860, Speaker A: Well, there's a plan to convert it.
00:44:37.930 - 00:44:38.646, Speaker B: I see.
00:44:38.748 - 00:44:53.574, Speaker D: You know what's funny? We haven't used the phrase POA in years. I feel like it was like a phrase from 2017. But in a lot of ways, a lot of the L two S are kind of POA. Just we don't use that phrase anymore.
00:44:53.702 - 00:45:32.230, Speaker B: I think the term L two is a little bit aspirational at this point. Right. It's like L two kind of means like we have the goal of no longer being a multisig at some point, but basically, pretty much all of these L2 S, deep down, somewhere, there's a multisig and the multisig basically, if they wanted to, they could control it. Whether it's like controlling the fraud proofs and the fraud proofs are whitelisted, or the code can be upgraded, or there are no fraud proofs and they create the optimism stack, or these Ek roll ups are all obviously super experimental. Everything is super protected. The reality is, like, today, L two is more like the destination as opposed to a description of the present.
00:45:32.380 - 00:45:39.282, Speaker D: Well, I agree, but that's because I think it's technically extremely challenging to decentralize them fully safely.
00:45:39.346 - 00:45:39.622, Speaker B: Right.
00:45:39.676 - 00:45:41.122, Speaker D: For all the different reasons.
00:45:41.186 - 00:45:42.358, Speaker B: For sure. Yes.
00:45:42.444 - 00:45:42.898, Speaker D: Right.
00:45:43.004 - 00:45:45.978, Speaker B: I think it's correct that they're this way. I don't think they should skip a step.
00:45:46.064 - 00:45:58.046, Speaker A: If we go back to our first chart. I mean, the question really is, is that amount of revenue that has to be spent going to worth decentralizing? Right? Well, there's some sense in like you.
00:45:58.068 - 00:46:30.738, Speaker C: Missed the second chart, which was the profit, the delta between the fees that they're charging people and what they're paying to settle. And so some of them are making what, like 1000 ETH per month on the spread. So that is pretty attractive. But it's also going back to the POA thing. There are levels to security. I think this stuff is all obviously better than any sort of POA network. And really what you're risking is the difference between the last proof that was posted on chain.
00:46:30.738 - 00:46:36.586, Speaker C: So it's like, okay, sure, it's not ideal, but we're getting there. It's iterative by the way, for those.
00:46:36.608 - 00:46:40.730, Speaker B: Who don't know, POA means proof of authority, which basically means a multi SIG, more or less.
00:46:40.800 - 00:46:42.350, Speaker D: Yeah, it means you have the keys.
00:46:42.770 - 00:46:55.950, Speaker A: But I will say there have been some successful chains have transitioned from POA to their own chains, like Gnosis chain, which started as Xdai, which was POA, but now you can run a Gnosis chain. Validator.
00:46:56.450 - 00:47:29.206, Speaker B: Yeah, I've been wanting to write a blog post about this and I've been caught up with a bunch of stuff, but I'm going to write eventually. But I want to get your guys take on this in real time as I think through this thesis. So I feel like over the last six months we invested into ZK Sync. We've been big bulls of layer twos generally. But I feel like lately the conversation has become and I see this more and more, especially among the kind of crypto intelligentsia, that layer ones are basically irrelevant now. Altel ones. Altel ones are basically irrelevant now because we have the roll ups.
00:47:29.206 - 00:48:05.080, Speaker B: The promised land is here. We can finally get off this intermediate step or like this ship that we were using to get onto the beautiful promised land of roll ups. And I guess my thesis is something along the lines of like the alt L ones are still really important and they're not going to go away. And I think they actually still have some structural advantages over L two S. Before I go into why I think that, I'm curious just to get your gut level reaction, or do you think especially the EVM based alt L ones, do you think they're basically done once the layer two s are fully feature complete?
00:48:05.690 - 00:48:13.594, Speaker D: Well, I actually think the alt L ones are long term more useful and more valuable than the L two S.
00:48:13.632 - 00:48:15.498, Speaker B: Potentially because, okay, interesting.
00:48:15.584 - 00:49:08.890, Speaker D: Why and maybe I'm tripping and we didn't talk about this on the last episode, or I'm just imagining this, or maybe we did talk about this in the last episode. Or maybe this was a conversation I just had with some crypto people, like on the streets of Brooklyn or something. But all the L two S are just EVM chains. And when it comes to being an application developer, even if there's 100 L2 S, they're not really offering you any new capabilities that you don't already have for launching an application. And I give kudos to the Alt L ones that are actually providing different capabilities to application writers, mostly through choice of language or tech specs or whatever. But Salana legitimately offers something different than Ethereum. Avalanche offers something different than Ethereum, polka Dot offers something different than Ethereum.
00:49:08.890 - 00:50:01.962, Speaker D: All the L2 S offer basically the same thing, and every L2 offers basically the same thing as every other L2. Even if you have 400 of them, it doesn't really fundamentally change the toolkit available to application developers. And at the end of the day, the whole point of all of these platforms is to enable applications to be built on top of them. And so I think all the different Alt L ones are more useful in that they offer different tools to developers that L2 S don't. And so I don't think having 100 different EVM chains is the promised land. Like, 100 different EVM chains, in my mind, is almost exactly the same or is equally as good as having one EVM chain. I think it's a lot of wasted effort and a lot of wasted resources as a society.
00:50:01.962 - 00:50:14.066, Speaker D: And I think there's so much more value that comes from totally different approaches that get tried than having yet another L2, which I think adds fundamentally nothing.
00:50:14.168 - 00:51:11.234, Speaker A: So I would say that another interesting fact is that a little bit like Ethereum last bear market, where the bitcoin maxis were constantly hounding them, but the developers were, like, dug their toes in, like, fuck you, we're still going to keep building things here. I feel like Salana does have that and no other Alt L One does have that, where there's this community of people who are like, they're almost like a cult in belief on the developer side, because we believe in particular attributes. Cosmos has that, but everyone in Cosmos likes to cut each like it's a knife fight, constantly a b. Anytime someone is like, hey, how do I make something easier for a user? Oh, guess what? Make another Cosmos chain and add another token. It's like the equivalent of the Xkcd, the comic on standards and technology. Like, hey, we have 15 standards. I'm going to make one that rules them all.
00:51:11.234 - 00:51:36.700, Speaker A: Okay, now we have 16 standards. And Cosmos has that problem inherently in a way that I think is difficult. People are definitely working on trying to homogenize things, but I think sovereignty comes at a cost. Solano is actually weirdly. The developer community is so adamant there in a way that reminds me of Ethereum developers at the bottom of the last bear market, which is good.
00:51:37.150 - 00:52:24.102, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that's honestly true for any chain. Like you're talking about legit chains, like legit communities and legit developers, but go down Coin Gecko and choose any random 2017 Era l one. And dude, there will be people in the discord, in the telegram on the Reddit Hyped about the chain for some particular reason and it's sort of like a religious in some way. And it's not just number go up. People talk about applications and there are random debts. People who get married to a particular chain ideology in the same way, I just think they don't. It's like a L two, maybe on a tangent from this topic, but something I was been thinking about is like it seems like to your point around these layer twos as a service or like stuff like base popping up, they kind of get copromoted or like heralded by something like the chain, like optimism.
00:52:24.102 - 00:52:42.606, Speaker C: But these feel very cannibalistic right now. Optimism has to any layer two basically has to make an argument as to why you need to sort of colocate on their chain with the other apps versus running your own fork of it. And that seems like a harder case to make over time.
00:52:42.788 - 00:52:55.410, Speaker B: We're building on base for that matter, right. Isn't base like directly cannibalistic from optimism? I mean, it's quite zero sum, right? They're the same damn stack, but one of them has coinbase distribution and one of them has like Op token.
00:52:55.750 - 00:52:57.650, Speaker D: I'd be pissed if I was optimism.
00:52:59.750 - 00:53:01.686, Speaker A: I don't think they're not. They definitely are not.
00:53:01.708 - 00:53:36.926, Speaker B: Yeah, they're clearly celebrating this. I mean, I think it's not obvious. And the other thing too, I think in a lot of these cases, the token, at least in the short term, it's kind of a meme token, right? Like obviously the fees for these layer twos, I mean, except for, like you said, the sort of the spread between the fees on chain and the call data they have to actually post it's reasonable. What, like 20 million a year run rate or something like that. It's like not a crazy amount of money, but it's not nothing. But it's obviously not worth like 10 billion FTV. So take Adam for example, right? Like Adam, obviously there is de minimis value going through the cosmos hub, which is what the atom token actually Adam.
00:53:36.958 - 00:53:39.118, Speaker A: Is dogecoin for nerds.
00:53:39.294 - 00:53:39.682, Speaker B: Yes.
00:53:39.736 - 00:53:50.334, Speaker A: It has no utility stroking Jaequan's ego other than Jaequan stroking ego with it. There's really nothing else for a lot of these things.
00:53:50.392 - 00:54:35.906, Speaker B: It is just the model. Right. So I think for Op token, I don't know that there was a rational reason why when base launched op token should go up. When Base and the optimism, whatever it's called, the optimism canonical distro, I don't know what your chain, whatever you would call it, clearly these are in competition with each other and they use the same stack and you're going to deploy on one, you're going to deploy on the other. Base did say, well, we're going to give some of the fees to the optimism collective or whatever, but then they walked back how many fees they were going to give and obviously they're not going to give the majority of the fees because it's their chain and they can change it at any time they want because it's up to them. Unless there's some contract, which would be kind of weird. So end of the day, and obviously they could always change, right? Like if there's going to be an alternative layer two stack that is open source and is totally license free and they're like, oh, optimism wants to extract more rent from you.
00:54:35.906 - 00:55:05.374, Speaker B: Coinbase can be like, okay, well, never mind optimism, we'll switch and do some regenesis or something and we'll create a transition plan to go to something else where somebody else gets the fees. So I just don't know. In the short term, I think nobody cares. In the short term, it's all meme warfare. And maybe appropriately so, maybe it's right for them to think about it as meme warfare. But I don't think the market's thinking about it this way because clearly when Base launched, that was like super. That's considered to be super bullish for optimism, despite the fact that now, okay, there's a third competitor on the layer two space.
00:55:05.492 - 00:55:14.994, Speaker D: Well, I don't think the market thinks that much in general in crypto. I don't think we have these extremely rational markets where there's fundamental analysis done.
00:55:15.032 - 00:55:22.690, Speaker A: On all the different arguably Base not launching with a token, though, is very positive for Op in the sense of securities.
00:55:23.910 - 00:55:33.186, Speaker D: No, I mean, it's going to know Coinbase runs a sequencer and the revenue goes to inc. Like, I don't think that's complicated.
00:55:33.378 - 00:55:51.086, Speaker B: Well, I think point is also a good one is that the demand for investing into layer twos, there's only really today two tokens you can invest in arbitram and optimism. And if Base had a token, there would be a third. And I think that's a simple enough analysis to be correct that that was good for optimism, that Base did not.
00:55:51.108 - 00:56:16.514, Speaker A: Launch a token, it's just buying B and B in late 2020. Op is the proxy for better or worse. It's a 30 IQ move. But I am agreeing with the thesis that haseeb was I don't really have a strong view on that thesis, but I will say I think that's the logic know, the left curve logic is literally what I just right.
00:56:16.552 - 00:56:16.754, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:56:16.792 - 00:56:19.000, Speaker D: Well, there's no token, so they'll use.
00:56:20.810 - 00:56:29.254, Speaker B: I obviously none of us are traders, as far as I know. Robert, you can see yourself a trader. I feel like you're the most active in markets of any of us.
00:56:29.292 - 00:56:33.078, Speaker D: Okay, I am not active at all. I am not a trader.
00:56:33.254 - 00:56:39.866, Speaker B: Okay, so none of us are traders, to be clear. We're all totally incompetent at making these kinds of evaluations, but nothing here is.
00:56:39.888 - 00:56:41.402, Speaker D: Investment advice because we all suck, obviously.
00:56:41.456 - 00:56:56.130, Speaker B: Nothing investment advice because we're all terrible at investing. In short term trades, but I will say the longer I've been in Crypto, the more that I've learned that the obvious thing is usually right. That's just like, the number one piece of advice that I give to everybody in Crypto.
00:56:56.870 - 00:56:59.330, Speaker C: Ape token is trading at 4 billion FTV.
00:57:01.190 - 00:57:02.494, Speaker B: Hey, they're going to ship a metaverse.
00:57:02.542 - 00:57:06.290, Speaker D: Ape is necessary to power the ecosystem.
00:57:08.070 - 00:57:11.538, Speaker C: I'd be bullish if they launch their optimism fork.
00:57:11.714 - 00:57:15.638, Speaker D: Yeah, ape is essential for going to.
00:57:15.644 - 00:57:42.238, Speaker B: Launch their own layer, too. Okay, I think we've technically hit an hour. This was a very experimental show. It's also very late at night, so I hope you're feeling the late night chill vibes. Let's go ahead and sign off. I think next week we will do something a little more sensible than this, but I hope that this was coming at you with a slightly different flavor of chopping block. To be clear, this is what we used to do back when we were doing the like, before the chopping block was a thing.
00:57:42.238 - 00:57:57.758, Speaker B: We used to do Twitter spaces. That was like the robot Ventures dragonfly like. What was it like? Happy hours. Like Friday. Happy hours. And we would just talk about random stuff and this was the vibe. Exactly.
00:57:57.758 - 00:58:03.030, Speaker B: And then now we've gotten so professionalized and we have an agenda, and we talk about the news.
00:58:03.100 - 00:58:04.790, Speaker C: We're going to talk about Gary gensler.
00:58:05.290 - 00:58:15.370, Speaker B: Gensler. See, we're always mixing up here at the chopping block. That's what the show's all about, keeping you guessing. Okay, that's it. Tarun. I hope your food has gotten here. I hope it's not too cold.
00:58:15.370 - 00:58:22.998, Speaker B: What did you order, by the way? I think turkey burger. Turkey burger? That's very healthy.
00:58:23.174 - 00:58:24.554, Speaker D: We're not editing this out.
00:58:24.592 - 00:58:31.978, Speaker B: We're going to keep in tarun. That's what you would say if you ordered, like, two pizzas. You'd be like, oh, I got a turkey burger.
00:58:32.154 - 00:58:52.230, Speaker A: Look, Zuko's not listening. You remember how Zuko was like a big meatitarian and always eating? But I feel like turkey burger is like a cheap something people don't respect as much.
00:58:52.300 - 00:58:57.480, Speaker B: Tarun, you know, that is a very feminized meal as a turkey burger. I can't believe you would you don't respect it.
00:58:57.850 - 00:58:59.270, Speaker D: You're showing hate.
00:59:00.330 - 00:59:04.100, Speaker B: All right, signing off. Thanks, everyone. Tune in next week.
