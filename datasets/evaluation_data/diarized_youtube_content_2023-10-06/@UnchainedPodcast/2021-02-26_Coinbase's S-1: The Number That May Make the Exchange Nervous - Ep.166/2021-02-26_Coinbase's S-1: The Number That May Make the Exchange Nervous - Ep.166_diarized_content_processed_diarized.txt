00:00:52.970 - 00:00:55.466, Speaker A: Welcome, Jeff. Hey, Laura.
00:00:55.498 - 00:00:56.394, Speaker B: Always a pleasure.
00:00:56.522 - 00:01:08.900, Speaker A: The most recent big crypto news this week was the Coinbase S One becoming public. Having written a book on Coinbase, you were extremely familiar with the company's history. What were your big takeaways from reading the S One?
00:01:10.070 - 00:01:50.746, Speaker B: Yeah, this was a big day, I mean, I think for Coinbase and for Crypto, getting to look under the hood and discover things. Yeah. Even I didn't know. I guess a couple of big takeaways were they're killing it financially? I mean, $322,000,000 profit, that's very good. But also, compared to the other big name unicorns going public, I mean, Uber, Airbnb, those are all still losing money. So I think the fact Coinbase is profitable is impressive. And also they've been on an M A spree, so the amount of money they raised also it's a bit of a wonky detail, but they did a direct listing, which normally means you can only sell shares you already have, but a new rule by the SEC lets you issue new shares.
00:01:50.746 - 00:02:22.066, Speaker B: Meaning they could have raised more capital, but they chose not to. So I think just that's one big takeaway is surprised how well they're doing. Other thing that surprised me is I think, who owns the shares? I can't believe Mark Andreessen owns more common shares than the founder Brian Armstrong. And also the firm Andreessen Horowitz owns a ton of it, too. So that was sort of a surprise. What else is in there? Another big one was there's lots of good nuggets in there, including the shift between institutional customers and retail customers. I think two or three years ago it was 20% institutional.
00:02:22.066 - 00:02:35.262, Speaker B: Now it's closer to 65. So I think this thing's built to last. I mean, it's really coinbase is to lose at this point. I'm not sounding bullish because I wrote the bulk on them. It's just I've covered a lot of startups and this is some of the nicest S One results I've seen.
00:02:35.316 - 00:02:56.162, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, for sure. Yeah. No, I wouldn't say that. You're looking at this with rose colored glasses because this was definitely impressive. One thing that I was looking at is that currently coinbase stores more than $90 billion worth of crypto assets. And against the total market cap of all crypto assets, that's 12%. And I was just like, wow, one company.
00:02:56.162 - 00:03:22.250, Speaker A: And I really feel like that kind of speaks to probably one of its core values, which is security. They've kind of famously been one of the few exchanges to not ever suffer a hack. Let's talk a little bit more about this institutional shift, because I feel like this has been a major storyline in crypto over the last few months. What does that say to you when you saw that that transition has been happening within coinbase?
00:03:23.150 - 00:03:58.758, Speaker B: Well, I think it's no surprise. We all knew it's happening with the likes of I think MicroStrategy was a bit of an exception, or when they bought started buying, but when you saw square come in and Tesla come in, and probably some names we don't know about are doing it too. And I don't think it's a surprise they're going with Coinbase because these know, big companies and financial advisors are conservative, and they want a name they can trust. And for better or worse, that's Coinbase. But the other takeaway from this is for coinbase. It's a double win, they think. Probably take a nice cut for arranging the transaction like they did for Tesla, arranging the subtle purchases of it.
00:03:58.758 - 00:04:35.662, Speaker B: Nice service fee for that, but also their custody business, too. I bet you most of these companies are also parking their bitcoin with coinbase for the low, low fee of 25 basis points or whatever it is. So I think that's interesting because my one reservation financially about coinbase is it's very prone to booms and busts in the good times. They're making a killing. Prices are up, volumes up, but then it all drops 80%. So I think they're probably better poised to ride out the next crypto winter because custody business. So those are some of my original thoughts, and obviously we're still appealing through that filing, but there's a lot of goodies in there, including the setting.
00:04:35.662 - 00:04:38.038, Speaker B: Satoshi on the front page. I like that.
00:04:38.124 - 00:05:29.186, Speaker A: I know I tweeted that sending the s one to Satoshi's address made me tear up, literally, because I do. And I really think that speaks to the momentousness of this occasion. Just to imagine when satoshi first sent the white paper out on that cypherpunk email, just I don't know how many people are on that email list, but it wasn't a huge number. And just to go from that white paper to then just a few people running the network and then now this massive industry has been built on this. I mean, it's really against all ODS, this currency that just came out of nowhere and was not the kind of currency that most people are used to. Like a brand new revolutionary thing. I just think it's amazing when I tweeted that I teared up, somebody tweeted back at me, like, I don't see why this would make you tear up, blah, blah, blah.
00:05:29.186 - 00:05:40.134, Speaker A: And I was like, okay, clearly then you don't understand a single thing about bitcoin, because the odds to go from where we started to this is insane. But anyway, did you want to add something on that?
00:05:40.172 - 00:06:04.522, Speaker B: No, I got to hold you on that, too. I saw your tweet. I thought I was kind of touched, too, because I get it. I mean, I've covered bitcoin since 2013. Not all in, like, you, but the amount of times people have asked me, this is stupid. Why Bitcoin? Blah, blah, blah, and it takes a bit of faith to really do it. It's not my job as a journalist to have faith, but I've met so many entrepreneurs, including you, who basically bet your careers on moving into crypto despite the risk.
00:06:04.522 - 00:06:25.014, Speaker B: And I think Coinbase going public almost at the size of Facebook is a really validating moment for whatever you think of crypto and bitcoin and all the rest of it. I just think a lot of people really put themselves on the line and work their asses off to build this up. So I think for them, it's a good day. Let's not diminish that.
00:06:25.052 - 00:07:16.840, Speaker A: Yeah, well, so to go back to Coinbase and your point about how the company's revenues really are dependent on how the crypto markets are doing, that was one thing I noticed, was that 96% of the company's net revenue comes from transaction fees, which that, to me, sounds like, oh, boy. Definitely going to see a lot of swings in that regard. But I did wonder. So for the subscriptions, I was looking at what makes up the subscription part of the revenue, and it's custody, as you mentioned, but also Staking, the earn service within Coinbase, where you can earn some crypto for learning about certain crypto assets and then also licensing for analytics. But I just don't see any of those being, like, huge businesses the way that the exchange would be. So how much do you think that shift towards subscriptions can help?
00:07:17.770 - 00:07:22.646, Speaker B: Yeah, I confess I missed that part. Are you saying only 4% is from non transaction revenue?
00:07:22.758 - 00:07:38.794, Speaker A: Yeah. So right now it's like tiny, tiny. I don't know how I was kind of like, all right, so maybe if custody gets big enough and maybe Staking, but I can't imagine they make a ton of money from earn or the licensing for analytics.
00:07:38.842 - 00:08:28.734, Speaker B: I mean, yeah, that's interesting because the other thing trouble they're facing is I think basically brokerage services can become a commodity quickly. I mean, look at Robinhood, what they've done to traditional brokerages. People are used to not paying fees, and as PayPal gets into it, as Robinhood gets into it, and maybe the big brokerages will, yeah, that's a pretty big risk for them. The flip side is they've got some time to figure it out because they've got such war chest of cash and the numbers we saw today don't even include Q One. That's all from late December when, oh, my God, bitcoin broke $20,000. They've had like a full quarter of Bitcoin at like near 50K. So even if the competitors come and cut down their profit margins, they've still got this big war chest to figure something else out.
00:08:28.734 - 00:08:53.750, Speaker B: But I do think it's a red flag if only 4% is coming from other stuff because I know they've been talking up custody and staking the rest of it for years. But the flip side is, I mean, if they're right, the stuff will grow. And if they can get their teeth into part of the DeFi market, the thing is the amount of acquisitions they've had through the venture arm and directly, it means even if someone else springs up to be the new big dog in crypto, there's a good chance Coinbase is going to own part of.
00:08:53.820 - 00:09:53.130, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. And my thing about Coinbase, too, is I just feel like they're sort of the leaders when it comes to security. And I feel like no matter how well Square and Robinhood do in catching up, they definitely, probably have to catch up when it comes to, for instance, detecting fraud on the platform or probably around security, a number of these other things. And that's why, for instance, Robinhood at the moment doesn't allow people to withdraw crypto from the platform because they don't have all that infrastructure built up and the algorithms really down. And just to also go back to your point earlier about the institutions, I did want to also note just in the sheer number of institutions, so it's not even just like the share of the revenue, but the number of institutions has gone seven times from what it was at the end of December 2017. And so that's over three years. And that, to me, I think, really says something about this next phase of how the crypto industry will go.
00:09:53.130 - 00:09:58.106, Speaker A: And Coinbase looks definitely poised to capitalize on that. Yeah.
00:09:58.128 - 00:10:41.190, Speaker B: And the other thing with institutions, too, I mean, I'm no authority on the banking industry, but you watch the Morgan's, you know, we're going to see bank of America and all dipping their feet in it. One thing I've learned about banks, too, they don't build their own tech. They would much rather license it. Banks are not built to do tech, whereas Coinbase is. So, I mean, also, given the existing relationships between JPMorgan and Goldman and Coinbase, I can see sort of like white labeling services or consulting or something like that, which could help their revenue. But again, that number you said 4%, that surprises me because it's been three years coinbase has been talking about all these other avenues of revenue and 4% ain't very much.
00:10:41.260 - 00:11:01.934, Speaker A: Yeah. And as far as the white labeling is going, I think Paxos right now is kind of trying to corner that market. All right, so in a moment, we're going to discuss a little bit more about this S One. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible. Crypto.com is giving away four Teslas.

More details can be found in the show notes. Back to my conversation with Jeff Roberts.
00:11:29.102 - 00:11:49.630, Speaker A: And so earlier you were talking about some of the Coinbase executives and investors who are set to become quite wealthy off of this public offering. One name that isn't super familiar, I think, to those who follow Coinbase is Surajit Chatterjee. Can you talk a little bit about who he is and where he shows up in that ranking in terms of his shares?
00:11:50.050 - 00:12:20.140, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, that surprised me because obviously to bring on talent, you give them equity. But I think the ranks were mark Andreessen, Brian Armstrong, of course, co founder Fred Ursum, and I think Fourth was Sergeant Chatterjee. And that took me a minute. I was like, who? I was like, oh, wait a minute, that's a Google guy they poached a couple years back. He's your head of products, but I wonder if they're having second thoughts about Mean. Obviously he's probably doing a good job. Coinbase has got nice products, but I was a little surprised to see how much he was able to pocket through this.
00:12:20.510 - 00:12:44.480, Speaker A: Yeah, probably has pretty good negotiating skills, it looks like. And so another thing, obviously, that we've alluded to, but I want to talk about this specifically in regards to Coinbase. So corporate treasuries have been quite the talk the last few months in crypto, and obviously we've seen all these different corporations that have allocated to Bitcoin. And what did Coinbase reveal about its treasury and its s one?
00:12:45.330 - 00:13:23.986, Speaker B: It was interesting because there's a lot of accounting quirks with companies owning crypto, one of which is I thought it would be counted as a UIC on a balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents. Equivalents are usually bonds and T bills, stuff like that, but that's not part of it. But there was a little line in there that said they own $130,000,000 worth of bitcoin as of December, which today would be worth probably double that. But I think it's like 2500 bitcoins, which is not very many. Of course they have massive amounts on behalf of other people, but in their own treasury they've got that little bit of ethereum, not much, and a little bit of altcoins. And they're talking about their stablecoins.
00:13:23.986 - 00:13:47.410, Speaker B: They've got the reserve of like 40 million of their USDC proprietary stablecoins. And I know some people on Twitter were like, come on, put your money where your mouth is. This is disappointing, but I think I don't want to offer them a cop out. But the reality with accounting is we saw this when Tesla made its move. Just a quirk in GAAP accounting. Sorry if I'm boring all your listeners with this, but you have an asset on your balance sheet. You have to mark how much it's worth.
00:13:47.410 - 00:14:11.782, Speaker B: But for some reason, crypto, if it goes down, you have to take an impairment and say, hey, our company values diminished by X much. If it goes up, you get to do nothing. So I think when you're a fast growing startup that's basically fueled on borrowing growing fast, you probably can't tie up capital or make your balance sheet look ugly that way in case of a dip. So that's my best theory, but I'd be curious to know yours. I mean, you watch this stuff as closely as me. Were you surprised?
00:14:11.846 - 00:15:02.154, Speaker A: Oh, I was really surprised by how low those figures were. I think your theory is a good one. I have actually, frankly, been interested in this gap accounting thing because I don't know much about it. And from the start I kept wondering, is there any kind of corner case where actually it works out well? Because obviously on the face of it, it just seems like a bad thing. But another idea that I had was simply that kind of like maybe they just want to sort of diversify in the sense that since their whole business really does swing with the crypto markets, then to have these additional assets that are literally going in the same direction as their whole business is. I just wondered if that's like, another reason. But even then, I just feel like if you're in it for the long term, then that isn't really probably something that would sway them.
00:15:02.154 - 00:15:07.978, Speaker A: So, yeah, I don't have a super good theory of probably the accounting one is the best one, but it was surprising.
00:15:08.154 - 00:15:39.770, Speaker B: Well, also, too, I think they're probably downplayed because I found it sort of two thirds the way down the filing and a weird line. And you think if they'd own more, they would have put it up like sort of proud and bold at the top and say, we were doing this before other people. But you look at the list of companies with the most bitcoin in their corporate treasuries. I mean, this puts Coinbase at like number ten or something on the way behind even square and MicroStrategy and stuff. So, yeah, it's curious. The point I'm making is I think they were kind of aware of it, which is why they buried it.
00:15:39.920 - 00:16:15.418, Speaker A: Yeah. So one other thing I'm very fascinated in, so I really liked reading their Risk section. It was very long and detailed and it really fascinating to me to see how they I mean, it's like I guess if you follow the space, it's nothing super surprising. But what interested me was that they did call out the risk from decentralized exchanges. And this is something I've been watching. So the seven day moving average of volume on Uniswap is roughly one and a half billion, which is about 27% of what Coinbase does. And uniswap is way younger and it's much harder to use than Coinbase.
00:16:15.418 - 00:16:35.530, Speaker A: And so the S one does cite competition from DEXes as a real factor. And then I was just thinking about it because Coinbase also lists the competition from Unregulated centralized exchanges like finance at the other end. I just kind of felt like, oh, they could sort of be squeezed there. What do you think of that theory?
00:16:36.110 - 00:17:41.486, Speaker B: Okay, I think this is one area, Laura, where we're going to disagree a bit. We were DMing with this know, I think DEXes are cool, I think they're the future and stuff, but I think they're for hardcore crypto heads and for the mainstream is this stuff is still like years away, at least five years away. And then there's always been before Binance, there's other cowboy exchanges, there was Bitfinex, there's poloniax, there was Mount Gox, there's always been the kind of fast, loose exchanges and they rise and they has, you know, kind of made its bet being the respectable one, for better or worse. So I just don't think as a strategic threat, the DEXs are going to pose a threat to them long term. Also, I think Coinbase has invested in quite a few of those DEXes, so I think they're going to win no matter what happens. Yeah, I don't think it being and finally, as people say, it's a rising tide or the pie is big enough for everyone, or I'mixing my metaphors here, but crypto is growing and growing and as long as the whole pie grows, there's enough for everyone to eat. So I don't see this being a threat for at least five years.
00:17:41.486 - 00:17:42.926, Speaker B: Some of your listeners might agree, but.
00:17:42.948 - 00:18:43.250, Speaker A: That'S my two cent, right? Yeah, no, I don't see it being a threat for at least five years as well. I just do wonder long term how that will work out, because I do feel that what's different about the DEXes from something like binance is that it's sort of mean. I would say the regulatory clarity around things like DEXes is somewhat unclear. But if you've been reading the Finsen guidance, which tends to say, oh, regulations, if you're not custodying customers assets, then you don't have to follow KYC and et cetera, et cetera. So in that regard, at least, I think some of these DEXes can breathe a little bit easy in a way that a binance couldn't. So if it is kind of like a more legit, non KYC version of interacting with crypto, then in that regard, I do feel like in the long term, maybe it will really take off. But you're right, coinbase is invested.
00:18:45.990 - 00:19:04.826, Speaker B: One other sort of digression on binance, it was kind of cute I saw on Twitter today, CZ congratulating Brian Armstrong, which is kind of a nice moment because they're, in one sense, bitter rivals. And Binance did its best to take Coinbase out. So it's kind of neat on Coinbase's big day. CZ. Was very gracious about that.
00:19:04.848 - 00:19:22.960, Speaker A: So it's kind of fun to yeah, yeah. Well, I think CZ is actually a really nice person and generally kind of a cool character. All right, so one other thing. Well, no, just in general. So what would you say, do you think are the challenges that Coinbase will face after it goes public?
00:19:23.410 - 00:19:57.002, Speaker B: I think the quarterly results are going to be very uneven because in crypto boom, they're going to kill it. And then there'll be a crypto winter, and now every three months they're going to have to publicly show the results. I think their stock price is going to move all around. I think the company still has management challenges. I mean, Brian Armstrong is one of the most tenacious focused CEOs I've ever met, but at the same time, I think the sort of debacle over the Black Lives Matter stuff last summer created a massive distraction. And a lot of people say he doesn't have the emotional intelligence to run a big public company. So I think that's one to watch.
00:19:57.002 - 00:20:05.534, Speaker B: They've had more turnover in the past, but they're probably in the best phase they've ever been right now. So I think it's Coinbase's to lose at this point.
00:20:05.652 - 00:20:12.750, Speaker A: All right, so based on the S one, how well do you think the direct listing will do? What valuation would you expect for Coinbase out of the gate?
00:20:13.090 - 00:20:36.262, Speaker B: I think what's the word, pop? I think that's what's going to happen just because you're seeing with all the other IPOs, these crazy first day 50% 100% jumps for airbnb and a firm, a kind of boring fintech company. So I know they're trying to price on the private market last. The latest things reportedly, is $300. People at Coinbase tell me they're going to go higher. So, yeah, I think the stock is going to go crazy.
00:20:36.396 - 00:20:52.750, Speaker A: Yeah, I would expect the same. All right, well, thank you so much for coming on Unconfirmed. Oh, and by the way, for people who are watching the video and for those listening, be sure to buy Jeff's book, King's Crypto beautiful cover, and you can learn even more about Coinbase.
00:20:53.810 - 00:20:56.202, Speaker B: Thanks so much, Laura. You're too kind. Always a pleasure.
00:20:56.346 - 00:21:38.810, Speaker A: Don't forget, next up is the weekly news recap. Hi, everyone. Thanks for tuning into this week's news recap. First headline tether settles with NYAG for $18.5 million after an almost two year long investigation, the handing over of 2.5 million documents and USDT growing from a $2 billion to $35 billion market cap. Bitfinex and Tether agreed to a settlement with the New York Attorney General's office on Tuesday in regards to the 22 month inquiry into a possible coverup of $850,000,000 in losses by Bitfinex the NYAG will bring no charges as part of the settlement.
00:21:38.810 - 00:22:17.782, Speaker A: In a Tweet thread, Tether claimed to admit no wrongdoing and said that there had been no finding that quote tether ever issued. Without backing. Tether agreed to pay $18.5 million as part of the settlement and will submit quarterly reports on the composition of Tether's reserves to the NYAG for two years. New York Attorney General Letitia James was a bit harsher in her description of the settlement. In a press release, she said, quote bitfinex and Tether unlawfully covered up massive financial losses to keep their scheme going and protect their bottom lines. Tether's claims that its virtual currency was fully backed by US.
00:22:17.782 - 00:23:10.730, Speaker A: Dollars at all times was a lie. While it is too early to decide winners and losers of the Tether vs. NYAG saga, it seems that both sides got what they wanted the New York Attorney General's office gets to be a quasi regulator of Tether, and Tether is allowed to continue functioning with only a minor fine. However, tether cannot serve New York citizens or businesses. Whether or not this ends up being worse for Tether or for New York, which is currently considered one of the financial capitals of the world, only time will tell. The settlement and resulting transparency should help resolve unfounded suspicions that issuance of Tether somehow artificially inflated the price of bitcoin. Dan Held, head of growth at Kraken, may have been correct in January when he wrote, quote Tether FUD fear, uncertainty and doubt is overblown.
00:23:10.730 - 00:24:28.530, Speaker A: Next Headline BTC, Falters Square and MicroStrategy undeterred bitcoin reached a new alltime high on Sunday at $58,367, and promptly dipped, dropping to below $45,000 by early Tuesday morning, a correction of roughly 20%. But these price swings likely don't phase corporations like MicroStrategy, which announced Tuesday that it had added another billion dollars in bitcoin to its books, bringing its total investment to 19,452 bitcoins, the equivalent of roughly four and a half billion dollars. Square also purchased $170,000,000 in bitcoin this week, bringing its total investment in bitcoin to roughly 5% of its total assets. The company also reported selling $4.57 billion in bitcoins to customers through cash app in 2020 and revealed that 1 million customers purchased bitcoin for the first time in January 2021 alone. In other institutional news, asset manager Stoneridge is adding bitcoin to its diversified alternatives fund. Effective April 26, the fund will have exposure to bitcoin through put options on futures contracts.
00:24:28.530 - 00:25:39.020, Speaker A: And in other bullish bitcoin news, the word bitcoin and its weekly tweet volume hit a new high this month. Finally, in quillette, Alex Glasin, the chief strategy officer at the human rights foundation, published an op ed on how governments may not be able to stop bitcoin on a protocol level. He also refutes a number of theories on how bitcoin could be stopped. He says, quote There is an enormous amount of speculation on the Internet about how bitcoin might be attacked, but few stop to think about why it hasn't already been destroyed. The answer is that there are political and economic incentives for more and more people to push the system forward and strengthen its security, and strong political, economic and technical disincentives that discourage attacks. If you have a normie friend who thinks that Bitcoin might one day go down, this may be a great essay to show him or her. Next Headline DFI Roundup Decentralized Exchange monthly volume hits an alltime high of $65 billion on Thursday, just 24 days into February, surpassing last month's record of $61 billion.
00:25:39.020 - 00:26:20.310, Speaker A: Average ETH gas fees hit a yearly high on Tuesday, with the average ERC 20 token transaction fee hitting $38.21, according to Bitinfocharts.com. Ethereum layer two solutions were popular this week. Layer two solutions aim to provide reduced gas fees, lower latency and greater throughput, rather than putting every transaction on the Ethereum blockchain. The first solution decentralized derivatives exchange. dYdX is open for trading on ethereum. Layer two scaling Solutions darkware trading is currently limited, though a full public launch is expected in a few weeks.
00:26:20.310 - 00:27:39.710, Speaker A: The exchange lists BTC, USD and ETH USD, perpetual contracts, lending and margin trading. Andreessen Horowitz is investing $25 million into Optimism, a startup focused on scaling the Ethereum network. Optimism began a soft launch of its product in January, partnering with DFI protocol synthetics to begin testing its rollups and the throughput and transaction speed. Next Headline Ethereum Killers on the Prowl With high gas fees on Ethereum being highlighted this week, it's no surprise that would be ETH killers have been, well, killing it. BNB, the native token to the Binance smart chain, jumped from forty dollars to three hundred dollars in just 20 days and now sits as the third largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Pancake Swap, a cloned uniswap DAP running on the Binance smart chain, which is Binance's competitor to Ethereum, is currently the number one dex by number of unique wallets and just $3 billion behind uniswap in weekly volume. The recent popularity of BNB, however, has raised questions around the centralized nature of the chain and whether Binance's conflict of interest in having an Ethereum competitor might have accounted for its suspension of ETH and Ethereum based token withdrawals on Monday.
00:27:39.710 - 00:28:32.818, Speaker A: Salana, another ethereum competitor, has seen impressive growth this week with the Sol token doubling from eight dollars to fourteen dollars as of press time. Thursday, Alameda Research announced a $40 million investment in Oxygen, a DFI prime brokerage that will launch on Decentralized Exchange Serum. Sam Bankman Fried, CEO of FTX and advisor to both Serum and Oxygen, pointed to the speed and lower cost of the Solana blockchain as reasons for choosing it. Next Headline Problems with traditional financial plumbing highlight potential in blockchain on Wednesday, an outage at the Federal Reserve resulted in settlement issues for many financial institutions, causing ACH and Fedwire delays at crypto exchanges. On the heels of the GameStop debacle. The DTCC, the main processor of us. Stock trades, released a white paper.
00:28:32.818 - 00:30:03.514, Speaker A: Outlining a plan to reduce the settlement of trades from two days to one, also known as T Plus One. DTCC thinks it can accomplish this within two years, which in crypto time seems like an unbelievably long time away. Hear more about how such issues could be resolved by a blockchain based platform such as Paxos Settlement Service, which Paxo's CEO Charles Cascarilla discusses on this week's Unchained. However, blockchain technology continues to intrigue the government. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell announced that the Fed will be engaging the public on the topic of a digital dollar later this year, and SEC Commissioner Hester Purse gave a speech titled Rocket Emoji, Atomic Trading Rocket Emoji, which actually used real rocket emojis on the SEC website, urging federal regulators to, quote, be more proactive in embracing technology. She specifically cited DeFi as an example, saying, quote DeFi's promises of democratization, open access, transparency, predictability and systemic resilience are alluring. She also noted distributed ledger technology has potential to improve the current financial infrastructure, mentioning that shortening the process for settling trades from T Plus Three to T plus One could decrease risk associated with open positions and reduce collateral demands.
00:30:03.514 - 00:31:40.950, Speaker A: She referred to Robinhood CEO Vlad Teno's testimony from last week when he called for real time settlement of trades and said, quote after all, crypto transactions settle quickly and effectively without a central counterparty, smart contracts and distributed ledger technology could make the entire clearing and settlement process in the equity markets faster and more efficient. Next Headline Fallout from SEC Lawsuit against Ripple continues in light of the SEC's lawsuit against the enterprise blockchain firm Ripple and two of its executives, MoneyGram, a publicly traded remittance firm, has stopped using Ripple services. Ripple also made headlines this week by announcing a move to Wyoming News that was broken by Wyoming blockchain Whisperer and Avanti Bank CEO Caitlin Long. Next Headline OKCoin delists BCH and BSV Since exchanges make money on the trading of coins, no matter whether they are high quality or low quality coins, exchanges are typically incentivized to list as many assets as possible. So it was surprising when crypto exchange OKCoin announced that trading of two forks of Bitcoin, which are known as Bitcoin Cash or BCH, and Bitcoin Satoshi's Vision, or BSV, will be suspended on the platform starting March 1. Both coins are variations on Bitcoin, each with a focus on larger block size limits and layer two solutions, respectively. OKCoin says it is a neutral platform and that it believes in allowing its customers to invest for themselves, but that based on the fact that the market caps of both coins are around 1% of Bitcoins.
00:31:40.950 - 00:32:30.170, Speaker A: Quote, the markets have cast their vote. Another factor that pushed it over the edge, the recent decision by Craig Wright, a leader in the BSV community, who has claimed he is Satoshi Nagamoto, to enforce copyright claims to the Bitcoin White Paper. Time for fun bits. Fab protocols strikes again. This Fun Bits is for all of those of you who remember the quiet days of 2016, when the Fat Protocol thesis was all the rage. The Fat Protocol thesis was theory that in the crypto round of the Internet, that protocols and their native tins would be worth more than applications built on top. This was in contrast to the original Internet, where protocols like HTP and SMTP were worth very little, but the applications built on top, such as Google, Facebook and Amazon, became hugely valuable.
00:32:30.170 - 00:33:10.882, Speaker A: Well, if you were wondering how that works out when you compare a seed investment in Coinbase to an investment in Bitcoin at that same time, a site called Casebitcoin.com has your back. It judges the seed investment in Coinbase to be around September twelveTH, 2012, and says that assuming a seed valuation of $10 million, Coinbase's valuation upon going public would need to exceed $47 billion. And with the way things are going right now for Coinbase, that looks like it's been locked up. All right, thanks for tuning in.
