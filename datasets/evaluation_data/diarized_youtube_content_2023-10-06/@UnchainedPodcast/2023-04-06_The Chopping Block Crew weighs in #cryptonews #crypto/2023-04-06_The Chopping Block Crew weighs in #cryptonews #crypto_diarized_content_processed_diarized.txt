00:00:00.250 - 00:00:57.566, Speaker A: I mean, there always is a little bit of this LARP. In the beginning, I think people think of it a little bit kind of like the comps always get drawn to WordPress and Automatic or know, Red Hat and Fedora where it's like, okay, there is the open source thing that people are contributing to and then there's this separate entity that the Dao pays to do the thing. And in reality it's kind of a LARP because they're kind of very tightly connected, at least in the early days. And so it's like, yeah, sure, it wasn't the best show, but what's the alternative? No one's going to develop Arbitram, so they're going to wait for some third party to show up and generate a consulting proposal. And so obviously everyone kind of wants the outcome. I said something to a founder recently which apparently really resonated, which was like early stage startups. They're a little bit like China, where it's like, yeah, yeah, you have the power and the control, but you need to let the people believe that they have some of the power and some of the control, sort of keep this process going.
00:00:57.566 - 00:00:58.890, Speaker A: And apparently that resonated.
