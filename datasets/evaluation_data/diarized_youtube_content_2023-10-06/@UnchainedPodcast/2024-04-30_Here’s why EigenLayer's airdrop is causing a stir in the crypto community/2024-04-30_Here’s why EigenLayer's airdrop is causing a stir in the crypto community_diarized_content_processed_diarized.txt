00:00:00.320 - 00:00:25.742, Speaker A: The much anticipated airdrop of Eigen Lair was announced and is stirring up a lot of controversy. Here's why. First, locked tokens. Users can claim their Eigen tokens on May 10 but can't trade them yet. The foundation says it's for community feedback, but it's frustrating for those who want liquidity now. Second, snapshot timing. The March 15 snapshot has upset users who feel their more recent contributions are overlooked.
00:00:25.742 - 00:00:56.154, Speaker A: Third, linear distribution. This model favors those with the most points, often benefiting larger investors and leaving smaller ones feeling left out. Fourth, confusing documentation. The airdrop's guidelines were unclear, especially regarding eligibility for DeFi protocol users, leading to significant confusion and frustration. Fifth and last, suspicious activity concerns were raised after a large withdrawal occurred right after the snapshot, sparking suspicions of manipulation. That's a wrap. Stay tuned for more developments within the ecosystem.
