00:00:00.280 - 00:00:35.812, Speaker A: Look at the damage that Gary Gensler has done through his enforcement actions alone. Forget other agencies. Let's just look at the SEC. You know, Ripple has spent somewhere between 100 and $200 million on legal bills so far. Coinbase, I think I saw somewhere they've spent close to $100 million already, and they're still early in the process. Right? Like Kraken. Who knows what they've spent? If you add up all of the legal fees that the industry has had to pay just to fight enforcement actions from the SEC, it easily tops a billion dollars and could get close to $2 billion by the time all of this is done.
00:00:35.812 - 00:01:00.208, Speaker A: That's a tremendous amount of money that's just going to lawyers, right, to deal with very specific issues. I think for a fraction of that price, we can actually work to educate Washington. We can work to build relationships within Congress and hopefully get a law pass that puts a new framework in place that stops the bleeding.
00:01:00.264 - 00:01:01.064, Speaker B: Not a dividend.
00:01:01.152 - 00:01:05.040, Speaker C: It's a tale of Tuqwan. Now. Your losses are on someone else's balance sheet.
00:01:05.120 - 00:01:07.552, Speaker B: Generally speaking, airdrops are kind of pointless anyways.
00:01:07.736 - 00:01:24.752, Speaker C: Unnamed trading firms who are very involved. Pollock ETH is the ultimate Defi. Protocols are the antidote to this problem. Hello, everybody. Welcome to the chopping block. Every couple weeks, the four of us get together and give the industry insider's perspective on the crypto topics of the day. So quick intros.
00:01:24.752 - 00:01:27.246, Speaker C: First, you got Tom, the Defi maven and master of memes.
00:01:27.408 - 00:01:28.350, Speaker B: Hello, everyone.
00:01:28.730 - 00:01:31.870, Speaker C: Next, we've got Laura, CEO of the show, coming back to join us.
00:01:32.250 - 00:01:33.190, Speaker D: Hey, guys.
00:01:34.250 - 00:01:39.670, Speaker C: And today we have special guest Kristen Smith, a policy powerhouse at the Blockchain association.
00:01:40.210 - 00:01:43.522, Speaker A: Ooh, I like that. I'm going to reuse that. Great to be here.
00:01:43.586 - 00:02:04.944, Speaker C: Nice. Great to have you. And I'm Aseed, the head hype man at Dragonfly. So we're early stage investors in crypto, but I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice, legal advice, or even life advice. Please see chopping blocks at XYZ for more disclosures. Okay, so we have had a pretty harrowing weekend. For those of you who've been living under a rock, the major news is mostly in politics.
00:02:04.944 - 00:03:12.426, Speaker C: I know we said before we are trying not to turn this into a politics podcast, but you may not want to have anything to do with politics, but politics has ideas for what it wants to do with you. So, markets, crypto markets, have been absolutely roiled by the events this weekend, which is the attempted assassination of Donald Trump. Obviously, he survived that assassination but going into the weekend, the perception was that this assassination attempt and his pursuant defiance and very rousing public image have contributed mightily to the likelihood that he's going to win in the upcoming presidential election. So his odds on polymarket went up after the attempted assassination, and crypto markets also went up under the anticipation, presumably, that this is going to be good for crypto. Then, of course, during the Republican National Convention, he announced his running mate, which he left everybody in suspense for quite a while. And that running mate turned out to be JD Vance. So JD Vance, somebody I don't think we've mentioned on the show before, he is, in american politics, something of a minor character, but something of a rising star within the republican party and within the MAGA wing of the Republican Party.
00:03:12.426 - 00:04:18.466, Speaker C: So let's just give some quick background on JD Vance. And then, Kristen, I'd love to get a little bit of a download from you about what you see as his crypto positioning and what it likely means that he is now potentially going to be vice president if Trump ends up winning the presidency. So quick background on JD Vance. He was the author of the best selling book Hillbilly Elegy, where he talked about his upbringing coming from, you know, the other side of the tracks in America. He grew up in Ohio, he worked at Mithril, which is Peter Thiel's hedge fund, has experience in Silicon Valley, understands the kind of Peter Thiel wing of the more conservative libertarian tech world. Apparently he owns $100,000 worth of bitcoin and is married to his wife, Usha Chilakuri. Vance, who is obviously, in addition to being indian, worked at Munger, tolls and Olson, which is the same firm that turned out to be representing the blockchain association when they were filing their amicus brief in the SEC versus Coinbase case.
00:04:18.658 - 00:04:21.030, Speaker A: Actually, I hadn't realized that. So that's.
00:04:22.530 - 00:04:45.640, Speaker C: Yes, there's a few different angles in which JD Vance is a very interesting pick for VP. So I'll hand over the floor to you, Christian. And by the way, just very briefly, Christian runs the Blockchain association, which is one of the bigger lobbying groups for the blockchain industry within the US, of which Dragonfly is a member. So, Kristen, give us the, give us a download. How should we be thinking about JD Vance?
00:04:45.980 - 00:05:36.600, Speaker A: Yeah, I think from a crypto perspective, JD Vance is an incredibly bullish choice for the industry. I think the only one who might have been competitive is Vivek Ramaswamy, who's been pretty outspoken on the crypto front. But Vance has yes, he's, he's fantastic. But Senator Vance, he's only been in the Senate for about two years, but he has been pretty vocally supportive of pro crypto policies. He has, in the past couple months, has been working on his own market structure bill. You know, he sits on the Senate banking committee, and he had heard some concerns about the fit 21 bill that was passed out of the House. And so he was working to try to introduce a bill that addresses those concerns.
00:05:36.600 - 00:06:23.164, Speaker A: He hasn't done that yet, but he's been talking with a lot of people in the industry about it. He voted in favor of the SAB 121 repeal when that vote came to the Senate earlier this year. And he's made some really good public statements. He has been very critical of SEC chairman Gary Gensler. He's also talked back when we had the whole situation with Canada and truckers getting their bank accounts cut off for protesting. He's talked about that crypto is the solution to that type of situation because you can have control over your own assets. And as you mentioned, he owns some bitcoin, which is fantastic.
00:06:23.164 - 00:07:22.770, Speaker A: I think he also has a tech investing background, and he's very close with the venture capital community in San Francisco and other places. So I think he's about as bullish of a candidate that we could ask to join the ticket. And I think, as we look forward, if he does indeed get elected, along with Donald Trump to the White House, I think one of the things that'll be interesting is what is going to be kind of his role as the vice president. And it's quite possible, given his background and given his current seat on the Senate banking committee, that he may take an outsized lead in financial services policy and also innovation policy. So I think he's going to have a big pull, a big role to play if they do win. And I was very, very excited to see that he was picked as Trump's choice.
00:07:23.350 - 00:07:48.136, Speaker C: Well, the other thing is notable is that he's 39. He is much younger than anybody else who is potentially going to be president or vp. Right? So Biden is 81, Trump is 79. Kamala is 59. So he is by far the youngest person who's potentially up to be in office in any capacity. And he's a millennial. So I think he is of the generation that he grew up with technology.
00:07:48.136 - 00:08:27.790, Speaker C: He has much better intuitions about how, I think technology is going to end up changing within his own lifetime, which does, again, seem like a very different stance toward this technology. I think with Biden and with Kamala if they're beaten over the head and they're shown big piles of money, they'll be like, okay, well, I guess crypto is fine, but I don't think they have the same convictions in technology that you're going to get out of somebody like JD Vance, obviously even more so than Trump. I mean, Trump, my assumption is that Trump does not really understand what is going on with crypto. Besides the fact that he made money by issuing nfts, I can't think of much else association he would have with a technology like crypto.
00:08:28.690 - 00:09:35.592, Speaker A: I mean, I think Trump obviously has evolved, right? I mean, in his last administration, he had a couple of very negative tweets about crypto and bitcoin, and his treasury secretary, Mnuchin, pursued a kind of last minute rulemaking that would have been very damaging for the industry. So it clearly wasn't good. But I think the fact that he's been open to listening and evolving his thinking on this and coming out very strongly and not just in front of a crypto audience. We've seen on a couple occasions during a routine stump speech where he will throw in crypto innovation into a general audience, and he gets a very good response when he does it. And so I think if there's, like, one thing that Trump understands, like, he understands what it's like to have institutions fail someone. And, and I think when we think of the crypto voter out there, which turns out is a real thing, if you had asked me a couple of years ago, I would have thought that was overblown. But we've got polling to back it up.
00:09:35.592 - 00:10:18.046, Speaker A: But I think what the crypto voter is feeling is like the financial services system isn't working for them. Right. Or big tech isn't working for them, and they realize that crypto is, is a way to sort of bypass the broken system. And, you know, I think Donald Trump understands broken systems. And so I do think he, he's starting to understand it. And, you know, every couple days, I talk to a new executive in the crypto industry who's gone down to Mar a Lago to visit with Trump or who attends one of the fundraisers and talks to him. And, and so I think he is learning, and I appreciate someone who can take new information and evolve their positions based off of that information.
00:10:18.046 - 00:10:26.850, Speaker A: So, yeah, I don't think he's as good as JD Vance by any means, but he's learning and he's listening to a lot of people who care about it.
00:10:27.550 - 00:10:41.030, Speaker C: Okay. And just as a quick american civics lesson, what is generally the role of the vice president when it comes to setting policy? Right. Because I think it's sometimes unclear what is the president's ambit and what is the vice president president's supposed to be doing.
00:10:41.490 - 00:11:19.142, Speaker A: Yeah, well, there's a lot of different things a vice president can do. I mean, there are some actually very specific roles the vice president has, and one of them is to be the president of the Senate. So if there's ever, like a tie vote, the vice president comes in and breaks that vote. The vice president has an office in the Senate. And so to the extent that next year the Senate in the new Congress is considering crypto legislation, you know, he could play a role from his seat as vice president in the development of that legislation. But it's a pretty open role. It's supposed to be a role that's an extension of the president.
00:11:19.142 - 00:12:09.328, Speaker A: Obviously, he would step in if something were to happen to the president and he wasn't, you know, was no longer able to do his job. But, you know, typically what happens is they try to find specific projects for a vice president to undertake to kind of own and manage. And so I think it will be interesting to see how it evolves. But, yeah, I think it was a great choice, and we're excited to see what happens this year. And that's not to say that, you know, Biden's not getting better, too, right? I was in a meeting last week with some very senior people from the White House. There are about 25 or 30 crypto executives in the room. And it was a fairly open discussion, a very frank discussion about some of the problems that the crypto industry has faced in the Biden administration.
00:12:09.328 - 00:12:53.900, Speaker A: And so I think things are improving on the Biden administration front also. But I do think Trump is several steps ahead of where the Biden administration is at right now. And I think based off of, you know, I think even before the assassination attempt, I think Trump had kind of the upper hand heading into the elections. You know, the funny thing about elections is events happen, right? Like they're new. New, like things that no one can predict that can change the course of elections. But I don't know, when I worked in, on Capitol Hill and worked for, I worked for one member of Congress that used to always say the trend is your friend, and it's a. Right now the trend is definitely in favor of Donald Trump.
00:12:55.160 - 00:13:14.700, Speaker D: Yeah. And, kristen, I have a question. So, because it looks, you know, so likely that Trump will be elected, what would happen in terms of the SEC? Like, how quickly might there be a new head or. Because I think Gensler's term actually, like, extends, I don't know, into 2025 or something.
00:13:15.240 - 00:14:00.980, Speaker A: Yeah. So the way that it works is the president appoints a chair from the existing pool of commissioners. So on day one, Donald Trump would say either Hester purse or Mark Ueda, who are the two republican commissioners? He would most likely pick one of them to become the chair of the SEC. It's actually interesting. So typically, when there's an administration flip like that and the independent agencies, you know, usually you have the president and their party will have three seats on a five person agency like the SEC, and the minority, you know, non office holding party will have the other two seats. So that's right. Now we have three Democrats and two Republicans.
00:14:00.980 - 00:14:33.212, Speaker A: The custom is if the party flips, if the White House flips, typically the custom is the chair of the agency. In this case, the SEC will step down and allow the new president. Well, in January, right when the new president is inaugurated. Yeah. And sworn in. And that allows the president to appoint one of the other commissioners as acting chair. And then typically they want to choose their own chairman.
00:14:33.212 - 00:14:47.148, Speaker A: So they'll, you know, choose someone to fill the commissioner slot, and then they will make that new commissioner chair upon getting confirmed in the Senate. So. Okay, so let's go ahead and ask your question. But there's a twist with Gary Gensler because he's not following the custom, apparently.
00:14:47.244 - 00:14:51.100, Speaker C: Oh, interesting. Okay, well, tell us how he's not following the custom, and then I'll ask my question.
00:14:51.180 - 00:15:08.940, Speaker A: Well, I mean, I think it's an interesting thing, and this is something that's been sort of talked around DC, but it's sort of an open question if Gary Gensler is going to step aside, there's some indications that he may want to stick around as just a regular commissioner. And if he does that.
00:15:09.960 - 00:15:13.000, Speaker C: But he's not remain chairman, but remain a commissioner.
00:15:13.040 - 00:15:32.860, Speaker A: Not to remain chair, but to remain a commissioner. And so that's pretty unusual because the difference between being chairman of an agency and a commissioner of an agency is pretty significant in terms of being able to drive the agenda. And so it'll be interesting to see if he does.
00:15:33.560 - 00:15:40.932, Speaker C: Why do people think he's going to do that? That doesn't comport with his character. He seems like quite drawn to being.
00:15:41.036 - 00:15:56.468, Speaker A: Apparently, apparently there is a, and again, this is, you wanted rumor and speculation. This is just a rumor that's going around. But, yeah, there's some, apparently he's expressed interest that he may want to stay. So I think it's unlikely that he's going to do that.
00:15:56.604 - 00:16:05.512, Speaker C: That seems pretty far removed from the speculation that he wants to become treasury secretary. Now. He wants to just be a minority commissioner on opposing.
00:16:05.576 - 00:16:12.300, Speaker A: Well, if it's a Trump administration, there's not many, many jobs left for, for democrats. So.
00:16:13.440 - 00:16:22.824, Speaker D: So, but so then, wait, so if he doesn't, then what happens? Like, is it like a survivor style thing, like, between, you know, Crenshaw and whoever? I forget who the other one is.
00:16:22.952 - 00:17:04.478, Speaker A: Well, I mean, no, that's the interesting thing is, yeah, they could, they could initiate a process. Yeah. Lizaraga. They could initiate a process to push him out, depending on if Caroline Crenshaw, who's been renominated to the SEC, if that nomination goes through or not, then the ratio is off. Right. And so what we could have is there's a world where we have a republican chair of the SEC who doesn't have the three votes that person needs to get their agenda through. But at some point, the terms and, and, you know, they do are given a certain amount of time once their term ends to get renominated.
00:17:04.478 - 00:17:17.078, Speaker A: So at some point, it'll cycle through and the SEC, under Trump administration, will be fully sort of operational. But, yeah, hold on, hold on. I mean, again, rumors are the SEC.
00:17:17.134 - 00:17:23.246, Speaker C: Is under the executive branch. Right. So don't all these people ultimately serve at the leisure of the president?
00:17:23.318 - 00:18:01.950, Speaker A: No, no. So they are, the SEC is considered an independent agency. So the president's only role is to nominate commissioners, and the president will nominate, you know, the minority commissioners as well. And then the Senate approves the commissioners, and they typically have a five year term. So, yeah, you can have, you know, they're not, it's not like the Treasury Department, where you take away all the top people at treasury or, you know, the Department of Commerce or something like that. That's an executive branch agency. The independent agencies have a, have a slightly different structure.
00:18:02.610 - 00:18:05.066, Speaker D: Okay, you guys, like, I have some.
00:18:05.098 - 00:18:05.434, Speaker A: Wyatt.
00:18:05.482 - 00:18:15.470, Speaker D: So talking about wild speculation, my wild speculation is that if that is what Gary Gensler wants to do, he will do it expressly for the purpose of screwing over crypto.
00:18:16.930 - 00:18:34.884, Speaker A: Well, he's not going to be able to do a whole lot as a commissioner. Right. I mean, think of, like, how much we love Hester purse. Like, she is amazing, but at the end of the day, she can only vote on the agenda items that are sort of brought forth by the chair in open meetings. Right. And she can give a bunch of speeches.
00:18:35.052 - 00:18:47.160, Speaker D: Right. But what we were saying in terms of the balance being off if he sticks around and then there's three Democrats rather than, you know, how it should be under a republican president, where it would be three Republicans. Like, that's what I'm talking about.
00:18:47.620 - 00:19:30.340, Speaker A: Yeah, well, and that would mean that would only happen if Caroline Crenshaw gets renominated. And I think it's kind of an open question if the, if the Senate is going to approve any additional nominees, you know, at any given time, the Senate has a slate of judges that they're trying to get through. They have all sorts of other executive branch nominees. There's a, they're trying to replace the FDIC head right now. And so there's a bunch of different open, open positions. I think it's, I think it's fairly low odds that they, that Caroline Crenshaw gets reconfirmed. So if that's the case, then they'll be down to two and Trump would be able to appoint the third Republican.
00:19:30.340 - 00:19:38.168, Speaker A: So, yeah, there's a lot of moving parts there and a lot of different scenarios that could play out, but that is definitely one scenario that people are concerned about.
00:19:38.264 - 00:19:38.472, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:19:38.496 - 00:20:28.630, Speaker B: I'm curious, in the interest of wild speculation, I'm curious to maybe get your thoughts on the calculus that went into choosing Vance as VP because he feels, I mean, im looking at Pauli market even as recently as early July, he was not the favorite for the VP pick by any means. He was trading like 15% and really has kind of shot up since July. And he also kind of threads this weird needle where hes from Silicon Valley or has a Silicon Valley background. But hes very anti big tech, like hes said publicly, hes a fan of Lena Khan and what shes doing with respect to the FTC going after big Tech and antitrust. Why do you think if you had to sort of theorize a little bit, what was the logic behind choosing Vance over some of the other VP potential candidates?
00:20:29.410 - 00:21:17.770, Speaker A: I mean, the best thing I've seen on Twitter is that it's assassination insurance. So if you go after Trump when he's president, then you're going to end up with a younger Trump. But no, listen, I think he's, he's young, right. He's, I think somebody that Trump likes very much. I think a lot of people thought when they were looking at the governor from North Dakota, Doug Bergam, that he would be, you know, sort of a more experienced, sort of calmer mind to balance out Trump. But I think in, you know, sort of post assassination world, Trump was able to, you know, sort of pick his, like, chosen successor potentially. And that, you know, you've got the Ohio background, which is, you know, an important battleground state.
00:21:17.770 - 00:21:45.820, Speaker A: You've got somebody with, like, some youth and some energy. And so I think this was, is maybe more of a, like, sort of legacy making choice for Trump. I mean, I don't know that that's just kind of my speculation. But, you know, I think given that there's, you know, pretty good odds that Trump is going to win this thing, he was able to, you know, make the choice he wanted to make as opposed to a more political choice to try to bring more, more voters over to him on election day.
00:21:46.560 - 00:22:34.094, Speaker C: All right, well, I will raise my hand and participate in the speculation. So I think with JD Vance, I mean, you could see the polymarket odds on JD Vance were already very high even before the weekend with the assassination attempt. And obviously, there's clearly some insider or something going on. And there were some articles that were also leaking that it seems likely that JD Vance has become the front runner. And he's not, you know, he's getting more attention now. So what I've, what I've read in the press, so obviously, there's the things that Kristen mentioned, such as him being from the Midwest, which is going to play well in the swing states, him being young, which I think is, in a sense, there's a kind of hoteling problem in a way, which is that everybody else who's in the race is so old that just having anybody who's from a different generation, from a younger generation is just going to set you apart. And to independents who are worried about the age issue, right.
00:22:34.094 - 00:23:08.032, Speaker C: Once the age issue became so big in the race, picking a young vp, like a very young vp, like a JFK age vp, it just really stands out as a choice at a time when very few of the other people are gonna stand out nationally. The other thing, of course, he's obviously very MAGA Trump y. But the thing that I think is notable. So apparently he is very close friends with Donald Trump Juniore. Supposedly the two of them are very close. And Donald Trump junior was the one who basically advocated for him to Trump Sr. Or Trump, I guess.
00:23:08.032 - 00:23:40.010, Speaker C: I guess we call his dad Trump Sr. But the thing about it, obviously, is that Trump is old, right? I mean, he's 79. He's not that much younger than Biden. And this is gonna be his last term. And so he is very much thinking about succession. And the question is, in 2028, let's assume Trump wins in 2024. In 2028, he knows that a lot of this stuff that the federal cases of people coming after him are going to resume immediately once his presidency is over.
00:23:40.010 - 00:24:16.778, Speaker C: And so it really matters to him who is next in line. And is there going to be a rebound to the traditional kind of neocon led Republican Party, right. The sort of the August politics of the bushes, or are we going to stay in Trumpland? And if you want to stay in Trumpland, you can either pick some, you know, just like a graybeard hardliner who's, like, following you but doesn't really have true allegiance to your cause. They're kind of a momentary acolyte. Or do you choose somebody who basically, like, I think if he could, he would have Ivanka be his VPN. Right. But he can't do that.
00:24:16.778 - 00:24:42.844, Speaker C: Or have Donald Trump junior, but it just, it's just too un american to do that. So he can't quite do that. So how do you get as close as you can? And to. My guess is that that is, in a way, how he sees JD Vance is that JD Vance is the closest I can get to basically putting my son in power. And he will have a very long reign and probably be the presidential frontrunner in 2028 if. Yeah.
00:24:42.932 - 00:24:49.804, Speaker A: And not undo the policies that he tries to put in place over the next four years if he wins. Right, exactly.
00:24:49.892 - 00:24:51.244, Speaker C: So I think he's very much continue.
00:24:51.292 - 00:24:52.760, Speaker A: To work on his agenda.
00:24:53.380 - 00:24:53.860, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:24:53.900 - 00:24:54.100, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:24:54.140 - 00:25:21.010, Speaker C: And like, you know, probably his children are going to continue being very active if. If he has, you know, a 2024 administration. And they're probably going to continue in a 2028 administration if JD Vance ends up becoming the next president. So that is my guess, is that he wants Trump to be the next big political family in America. And even if he dies in office, he wants that to continue. That. That is my read on why he thought JD Vance was the right person.
00:25:22.630 - 00:25:24.166, Speaker A: No, I think that makes sense.
00:25:24.358 - 00:25:56.812, Speaker D: Yeah. I actually think JD Vance is similar to Trump, too, in that they, like, appear to have just tacked in completely different directions at different points in their careers. Like, you know, I'm sure you've seen he used to be a really strong critic of Trump. Like, calling him all kinds of names. I forget all the things. But, you know, he used to really dislike the guy, like, if not hate him, frankly. And in a way, it reminds me of, I think, with Trump.
00:25:56.812 - 00:26:23.430, Speaker D: Am I wrong that, like, he used to be a Democrat and stuff? Like. Like he was at the Clinton's wedding and, like. Yeah, so, yeah, so, like, both of them are kind of not, like, so easy to pin down. Whereas, like, you know, clearly things went way wrong between Pence and Trump. Like, really wrong. And I think for that pick that was like Trump listening to the Republicans, you know, and, yeah, no, well, so.
00:26:23.470 - 00:27:20.940, Speaker A: Remember when Trump was elected the first time, you know, he kind of ran on this, like, you know, very populist platform, and he chose Mike Pence in an effort to sort of, you know, fold into the Republican Party. And he brought Reince Priebus from the RNC over to be his chief of staff. And it turned out that they didn't have, you know, they were trying to pull Trump to the, you know, traditional Republican Party and not willing to adapt to Trump. And I think, you know, what Trump has done is he's looked across the country and he said, what do people really care about? What are the issues that, that are affecting sort of everyday voters? And he's trying to completely reinvent the Republican Party. So, no, I think you're totally right, Laura. Now, this time, he doesn't have to try to play nice with the Republican Party. He can reinvent the Republican Party, which is something I think was probably needed.
00:27:20.940 - 00:27:41.028, Speaker A: Right. I mean, there was quite a dynasty going on before, and I think it's something we still sort of see that's been very apparent in the past couple weeks. Looking at Joe Biden and kind of the way that the Democratic Party machine operates. These parties need to be shaken up every now and then. I think that's what Trump is trying to do.
00:27:41.164 - 00:28:24.464, Speaker C: Yeah. So you mentioned the meeting I heard about this meeting that I guess Ro Khanna organized with some of the folks in DC and getting the ear of the Biden administration. And what I had heard from some of the folks who'd been there was that the Biden administration, basically since the beginning, has refused to engage entirely on crypto. Like just absolute radio silence, no one's phone calls getting returned. Just screw off. We don't want to be seen in the same room with you guys. And this is the first moment, and it's a little bit too little, too late, but this is the first moment that the Biden administration has been willing to actually engage, get in the room, listen to the concerns and try to at least strike a reasonable pose.
00:28:24.464 - 00:29:00.226, Speaker C: And I have to assume a big part of the reason why that is is not just what we talked about on previous shows about Trump showing his willingness to move on the crypto issue, but also the fact that there has been enormous amounts of fundraising done for crypto packs. So so far, we have the number one pack in crypto is called the Fairshake pack. It has raised $177 million, which makes it the second largest pack in America, behind only the make America great again pack, which is the number one pack. Only a million dollars less has been raised for the crypto.
00:29:00.258 - 00:29:07.682, Speaker A: Yeah. Two weeks ago, this fair shake pack was actually ahead of the Make America great again pack. So it was number one for.
00:29:07.746 - 00:29:09.922, Speaker C: So we're swapping. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:29:09.986 - 00:29:34.212, Speaker A: And I think Elon announced that he's doing a pack at 45 million a month, so that that may surpass it. But, you know, it's by far the number one industry pack. Right. There's no other industry organization that is spending that kind of money in the election. So, yeah, this is a really big spend, and I do think it has caught the attention of a lot of policymakers.
00:29:34.236 - 00:29:39.420, Speaker C: Right. I have to assume this is a lot of why all of a sudden, the Biden administration is looking very reasonable.
00:29:39.920 - 00:30:28.556, Speaker A: Well, I think it's a couple things, right? So, yes, I think the money is catching people's attention, but my understanding from talking with the team at fair shake, and I always want to be clear, I don't control the fair shake pack. You know, blockchain association focuses on it a different piece, but having a super PAC is a very important piece. But my understanding is fair shake was designed to only play in the congressional races. So fair shake itself isn't weighing in on the presidential. But there are people within the crypto industry that have been going to fundraisers for Donald Trump and working with him in that way. But I think it's a combination of a couple of things. Crypto has a newfound political power, and I think it's based off of a couple of things, including the money.
00:30:28.556 - 00:31:02.652, Speaker A: But one is that the crypto voter is real. We've seen this in polling. One in five voters in swing states is considering cryptocurrency and their decision of who to vote for in the election this fall. I mean, that's a tremendously large number, you know, especially in swing states where, you know, a certain. A small number of votes can have a big impact. Also, like the crypto advocate is a real thing now. And by that, I mean stand with crypto, which, which something that Coinbase initially funded.
00:31:02.652 - 00:31:41.826, Speaker A: But a lot of different organizations have kind of helped to get that going. It now has over 1.2 million individual users and advocates who've signed up to that platform. And so they're ready, on a moment's notice, to activate, to call their congressman or senator or file a comment letter. That is a huge force. I mean, if you remember, and Laura and I talked about this a couple of years ago during the infrastructure debate, that was the first time we really saw this sort of grassroots ability for crypto to really use Twitter at the time to organize and to get out the word to call your congressman. This takes that and puts it on steroids.
00:31:41.826 - 00:32:13.120, Speaker A: This is a sort of built up organization that supports debate watch parties in different cities and really tries to engage the everyday voters. So the crypto advocate is real. And I would also say the crypto industry is mature and organized and thoughtful and engaged. It wasn't always this way. I mean, when I first met Laura almost six years ago, it was a total mess. Right? There was barely any resources. There wasn't any organization.
00:32:13.120 - 00:32:56.146, Speaker A: You had a bunch of different people kind of pushing out bad messaging. And I think there's been a real sort of maturity. And part of that is the super PAC, but part of it is just our ability to bring really thoughtful ideas to the table. So I think the combination of all of this political power that kind of crossed at the same time that Donald Trump decided or happened to have this NFT event at Mar a Lago. Right, that coincided with all these votes in the House and Senate, where all of a sudden crypto was able to demonstrate its strength. It was sort of a perfect storm of events that, that it got to the point where the White House couldn't ignore it anymore. Right.
00:32:56.146 - 00:33:27.450, Speaker A: I mean, I think in their minds, they were thinking FTX, they were thinking money laundering. They'd really deferred heavily to Elizabeth Warren and Gary Gensler, and they realized that this was a community they had to engage with and that there were real thoughtful people that are working. And so I think there's hope going forward. I do think this is a bipartisan issue. It always has been. But I think that our enemies have been skewed to the democratic side, but they're getting less and less credibility by the day.
00:33:27.870 - 00:34:02.490, Speaker D: Yeah. Kristen, I actually, just now, when you said, when we met six years ago, I remember in that first interview I ever did with you, you talked about how the infrastructure for lobbying for the crypto industry was so nascent and not built out. So it's just amazing that now we're having this conversation where you're saying the opposite, that actually it's a huge force in DC and, you know, really well organized. And, you know, just even, you know, how you were talking about, like, fair shake is only focused on the congressional races. Like, that's how specific everything has gotten. There's like a whole. Like.
00:34:02.490 - 00:34:06.266, Speaker D: Like this ecosystem has, like, a niche for every player.
00:34:06.418 - 00:34:32.269, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. And it's not, you know, the lobbying is sophisticated. Like, yes, we have the blockchain association, but we have all these companies that have in house government relations teams that are, you know, up on the hill every day. We've got all these executives that are flying in to be a part of the process. We have, you know, the fundraising piece on the super PAC side, on the hard dollar side, we've got the grassroots piece. We have theater innovation foundation that does education.
00:34:32.269 - 00:34:44.743, Speaker A: Like. Yeah, there's like. It's like a, you know, collection of tools in a very full toolbox, whereas before, you know, we had kind of maybe like a broken screwdriver or something we were trying to use.
00:34:44.791 - 00:34:47.263, Speaker C: But so what's interesting to me about all this. Yeah.
00:34:47.271 - 00:34:48.259, Speaker A: It got a lot better.
00:34:48.639 - 00:35:12.250, Speaker C: Yeah. So, you know, I was looking on some of the. Some of the websites that aggregate information about super pacs. And so there's $170 million raised, but only about 70 million that's been spent right now from fair shake. So $100 million of cash on hand. And now, obviously, fair shake is not the only thing that has been expending money, and there's a lot of other. A lot of other resources that are being expended to do all this political lobbying.
00:35:12.250 - 00:35:48.150, Speaker C: But if you just look at the raw numbers, okay, $70 million spent on congressional lobbying. Right now, in the context of crypto, that's actually a very small number. Right. Crypto has lost. So we have pissed away so much money over much stupider things with very little to show for it. And so I guess the question in my mind is not so much, why did it take so long? It's a little bit, why did it take so long? But it's also a little bit like, okay, let's go back to 2020, previous presidential election. I remember at that time there were a lot of news stories about the fact that SBF was spending so much money on the Hill, donating both.
00:35:48.150 - 00:36:22.402, Speaker C: He was the second biggest donor to Biden's campaign, and he was a massive donor to many Democrats up and down the country. It didn't feel at that time that crypto really had that much of a voice. So SPF was a celebrity coinbase. I think they had just gone public, or this is right before they went public. I don't remember exactly, but it didn't feel like anybody cared. And there wasn't this sense that crypto was a real force, even though in 2020, we had the crypto bull run. We had tons of retail investors buying into crypto, and exchange volumes were bigger than.
00:36:22.402 - 00:36:47.320, Speaker C: Than they are now. I guess my question is, what is your theory of why it feels so different, why there is so much organization? Is it that the infrastructure now has been built out? Is it that the companies are more mature? Is it that our strategy is more well thought out? Is it actually that there are just more people who are engaged and who care on the ground? Or is it that we're spending in a more sensible way? What is your theory of why this time is different?
00:36:47.980 - 00:37:14.696, Speaker A: Yeah, well, I think. I mean, there's certainly a maturity element, right? Like, you can't build these different organizations and teams of people overnight. So that is certainly part of it. But, no, I think the bigger part of it is look at the damage that Gary Gensler has done through his enforcement actions alone. Forget other agencies. Let's just look at the SEC. You know, Ripple has spent, what, somewhere between 100 and $200 million on legal bills so far.
00:37:14.696 - 00:38:21.478, Speaker A: I think Coinbase, I think I saw somewhere they've spent close to $100 million already. These are. And they're still early in the process, right? Like Kraken, who knows what they've spent? If you add up all of the legal fees that the industry has had to pay just to fight enforcement actions from the SEC, it easily tops a billion dollars and could get close to $2 billion by the time all of this is done. That's a tremendous amount of money that's just going to lawyers to deal with very specific issues. I think for a fraction of that price, we can actually work to educate Washington. We can work to, you know, build relationships within Congress and hopefully ultimately get a law pass that puts a new framework in place that stops the bleeding. So I think some of it has been a bit of a necessity, like the realization that, you know, we need to spend money in Washington to stop the problems that we've had seen out of the SEC specifically.
00:38:21.478 - 00:39:15.750, Speaker A: But I think there is a maturity element, too. I mean, I remember people used to not think very highly of ripple, and now ripple is sort of the hero, right, because they've taken on the good fight. I think people are banding together because everyone has individually been beat up, and now they're like, all right, let's work together to push back in a way that ensures that this kind of treatment never, ever happens again. I mean, I think that's why the, the name fair shake is, like, so brilliant, right? Like, I think that's all the industry is asking for. They're asking for someone to, in the government to listen to them and to try to work out the appropriate framework. And so, yeah, I think it's a little bit out of necessity, but it's certainly, like you were saying, it's much less expensive to try to engage in constructive process in Washington. It takes a long time, but it's much less expensive than fighting it out in the court.
00:39:16.490 - 00:39:49.786, Speaker D: So, Kristen, I have to ask you a question, and this again, gets into the speculation territory that is so interesting and tantalizing for everybody. But so we were talking about what it was that caused the Biden administration to kind of switch. And, you know, you laid out like all the different factors. But I have a question about something in particular because, so I don't remember what it was. I guess it was, I think it was like one of the SAB votes or something where maybe it was the one where like 71 democrats cross party lines or something, and then that was fit 21.
00:39:49.818 - 00:39:50.290, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:39:50.410 - 00:40:21.976, Speaker D: Okay. Okay. So I don't remember. So maybe we can piece together what exactly happened. But all I remember is something happened that signaled like, oh, there's a bunch of Democrats crossing party lines. And then the next Monday is when we got the news that the SEC had, quote unquote, changed its mind on the ETH ETF's and sent, you know, notice to the different issuers that they were going to approve them before that Thursday deadline. And I remember that originally everybody was like, oh, the Biden administration doesn't want to lose the crypto vote.
00:40:21.976 - 00:41:07.590, Speaker D: So they, so this came on from down high and they told Gary to get in line and he has to, like, approve these ether ETF's. Okay. So that was the prevailing theory initially. And I can't remember. I guess maybe it was Biden's veto of the SAB 121 reveal where then people were like, well, we now don't understand, like, why they reversed on the ether ETF's if, if it didn't come from on down high. But James Safer of Bloomberg intelligence, at least on our channel on bits and bips, he said that he'd been hearing that actually what happened was that with those votes in Congress, that. So I guess this, the one SEC commissioner Jamie Lazaraga was Nancy Pelosi's right hand man for like, I don't know, over a decade or something.
00:41:07.590 - 00:41:26.750, Speaker D: I forget what the exact number of years was. But the new theory was that it was Nancy Pelosi who through Jamie Lazaraga had been like, wait, we're going to lose this vote for stupid reasons. And that it was lizarraga who'd switch. So what is your theory about what happened? Did it come from the Biden administration or.
00:41:27.530 - 00:42:07.790, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I do not think it came from the Biden administration, because, like we were talking about earlier, the SEC is an independent agency, and they don't necessarily take their cues from the Biden administration. I mean, the Biden administration, if you want to be renominated, plays an important role, but they don't typically give specific instruction to an independent agency like that. But I do think what happened is, I mean, I mean, that was. I got to tell you, that was. It's like the week FTX went down and then, like, the, like, week or two where, like, crypto realized it's political power. This may. I mean, those are like, crazy, crazy moments where so much happens so quickly.
00:42:07.790 - 00:42:52.858, Speaker A: But, no, I do think that the SEC realized that, you know, they. That they were going to have to explain their posture towards the crypto industry and that they really couldn't justify not considering the ETF, the ether ETF applications. And so I think it was just more of a political reading of the tea leaves. James Theory is interesting. When I heard that, I was like, I could see how that happens, because if you looked at, like, you know, so there was the SaB 21 and fit. SAB 121 and fit 21, right? Lots of 21. So Sab 121 was the accounting bulletin repeal that allows banks to get into custody.
00:42:52.858 - 00:43:27.966, Speaker A: Fit 21 is market structure. So the House voted on the Saab 121 repeal, surprisingly got 21 democratic votes. And what's interesting about that is we actually didn't even lobby to try to get votes for that bill because the House Financial Services Committee says, oh, we don't want this to be perceived as, like, a crypto issue because they thought that would make it lose votes. But then it sort of pleasantly, surprisingly, got 21 votes. It went over to the Senate. And the Senate's like, hmm, actually, maybe, like, you guys should, like, push a little bit as an industry and try to get us more votes. And surprisingly got eleven democratic votes plus an independent.
00:43:27.966 - 00:43:56.270, Speaker A: So a total of 60, which was huge. And that included people like Chuck Schumer, the majority leader, or Ron Wyden, who chairs the Senate finance Committee. Like, these are senior members of the Senate that voted for this. So by the time the fit 2021 vote came around, you had Nancy Pelosi on board. You had Katherine Clark, who's the whip in the House. You had Adam Schiff, who used to chair the. The House intel committee.
00:43:56.270 - 00:44:17.750, Speaker A: You had some very, very senior people in the House. And I think, you know, the SEC knew they weren't going to be able to justify sitting on that any longer, and so they picked up the process. But, yeah, I remember that Monday. I was on a panel that morning where they asked about the ether ETF, and I was like, oh, that's not happening till next year. And then the afternoon came and it was pretty miraculous news.
00:44:17.870 - 00:44:42.572, Speaker D: But wait. Yeah, so then I have to ask you if you're saying that they realized they couldn't justify it because there are other theories I've seen on Twitter. Like, I think Nate Jirachi is the main one where he's like, or maybe it's Scott Johnson. I forget where one of them is. Just like, no, I think they had been planning to approve it all along. They just didn't want to do it until close to the deadline. So is that what you're saying or are you saying something different? That they did change their minds?
00:44:42.756 - 00:44:59.868, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I did not get. Yeah, I mean, listen, this is all speculation, right. But no, I think they had to. I think they felt they needed to change their mind because, you know, they were going to have to answer to a bunch of questions as to why they'd been so hostile. And this kind of helps ease that pressure.
00:44:59.924 - 00:45:15.636, Speaker C: Well, okay, no, but I don't buy the story. I don't buy the story. Right. Like your claim basically is that there was no phone call. It was all endogenous. They just like, introspected and realized that, like, oh, we're going to get sued if we reject this and we're going to lose in court. Yeah, but they, of course they knew that.
00:45:15.636 - 00:45:38.220, Speaker C: They knew they were going to get sued ages ago, but they were not engaging. They were clearly giving people no signals that they were going to prove this thing. Almost certainly if there was not a phone call, there was something. Like a phone call, you know, like there was something. Yeah, well, there's an independent agency to get influenced by somebody outside the independent agency that, hey, approve this or there's going to be trouble.
00:45:39.520 - 00:45:55.010, Speaker A: Well, the oversight committees. Right? I mean, Chairman Gensler has to go before the House Financial Services committee every few months. Committee. Well, they can ask questions and they can make it uncomfortable. Yes, exactly.
00:45:55.310 - 00:45:58.270, Speaker C: But they're independent. Right. So they can't fire him.
00:45:58.390 - 00:46:08.918, Speaker D: Well, okay, wait, so then his. So what is your theory? Is your theory that the call came from the Biden administration or from Nancy Pelosi or like from a different person or what's your theory?
00:46:09.054 - 00:46:19.096, Speaker C: Oh, look, I have no idea where the call came from. But, like, the idea that, okay, it's a quote unquote independent agency, therefore they're not taking phone calls from politicians, is obviously absurd. Like, of course.
00:46:19.128 - 00:46:26.160, Speaker A: Well, they're taking phone calls from the hill. Right, right. Because the hill has oversight over the agency. But we know that.
00:46:26.240 - 00:46:30.352, Speaker D: We know, and I'm so sorry. Is that Congress? What's the hill?
00:46:30.456 - 00:46:33.376, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Capitol Hill. Right. Yeah, Congress. Congress.
00:46:33.448 - 00:46:34.248, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:46:34.304 - 00:46:35.048, Speaker A: Just so.
00:46:35.144 - 00:46:51.616, Speaker C: Yeah. Yes. So we know that Gary Gensler has aspirations to become treasury secretary. That means he has to be appointed by the president. Okay? So ultimately, yeah. Elizabeth Warren is his saint, but he needs to make Biden happy. So it feels to me like everything that we've learned.
00:46:51.616 - 00:47:16.592, Speaker C: Okay, SAP 121, I don't know, maybe made him look weak. Maybe that's why they decided to do it. Maybe he was on autopilot. Maybe he gave the instruction a while back and didn't revisit it. We don't know why. But we saw, you know, this recent meeting that Ro Khan organized, and we've seen that, you know, the Biden administration is clearly realizing, you know, the political gears are turning. It's something that I've said on the show repeatedly that going into the election year, Biden's going to soften on crypto.
00:47:16.592 - 00:47:34.768, Speaker C: And surprise, surprise, it's an election year Biden softening on crypto. Right. It's just politics. So the idea that, you know, obviously, Gensler, he cares. He clearly doesn't like crypto. To him, it's personal. And understandably, because we have beaten the hell out of this guy in the public arena for the last four years.
00:47:34.768 - 00:47:51.976, Speaker C: So I understand why he hates crypto because we hate him back. But the reality is that he ultimately responds to the political machinery around him. And so something within that political machinery whispered into his ear, hey, you know, approve this thing or there's gonna be more pain come November.
00:47:52.048 - 00:47:52.272, Speaker A: Morgan.
00:47:52.296 - 00:48:22.578, Speaker D: Yeah, but so my personal theory is, I think James Safer does, right? I think it was Nancy Pelosi pulling the strings, because since we did see that Biden did do the veto, that kind of, like, lends less credence to the Biden theory. But because Nancy Pelosi voted for, like, she crossed and party lines, like, she clearly understands the importance of the crypto vote. And so if she really is as tight with Jamie Lazaraga as, you know, people are saying, then that would make the most sense to me as the theory.
00:48:22.634 - 00:48:33.400, Speaker A: Oh, yeah. And he used to work for her right, in the house. So when she was speaker, he worked for her in the house. So, no, I think, I think that is, that is a plausible, that was a very plausible theory.
00:48:33.780 - 00:48:34.560, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:48:35.340 - 00:48:39.880, Speaker A: San Francisco. Right. So she's close with people in the industry.
00:48:40.180 - 00:49:05.526, Speaker B: He did put out the memo, I think it was after the Mar a Lago dinner about, hey, we should work together to find reasonable legislation for crypto. And that felt very out of the blue and random, like, why, after so many years of kind of going the course that suddenly in a week he's decided with this very coincidental timing, to put out a memo saying he wants to engage with the industry? That feels like that was kind of the wake up call.
00:49:05.638 - 00:49:23.636, Speaker D: No, but he released that as a statement. So that statement was part of his saying, like, I don't support fit 21, but I'm not going to veto it, but I do want to work with the industry to create new legislation. That's what I, what that was part of. So it was like a, which was.
00:49:23.668 - 00:49:46.240, Speaker A: A big deal in that, which was a total, you know, for a long time. The, at least the SEC position is we don't need new legislation because we already have the authority, because all these things are securities. Right. So for Biden to say we need legislation and we need on market structure, and I want to keep working on that, that is actually a hugely positive development, even though it was, like, against the vote at the time.
00:49:46.780 - 00:50:03.102, Speaker C: Right. Okay. So let's switch gears a little bit away from speculation. Let's talk about what the actual pipeline of legislation looks like on the policy side. Okay. So there's a few different bills we've talked about. SaB 121 looks like that override has failed.
00:50:03.102 - 00:50:25.640, Speaker C: And so we're probably gonna have to wait for a new SEC for anything accounting wise to change. Although there's some rumors about exceptions for certain groups or whatever, let's ignore that. Talk to us about fit 21. Talk to us about what are some of the other bills that are coming down the line and what should people be paying attention to that's likely to get done this year and or will have to wait until a new Congress gets seated post elections?
00:50:26.340 - 00:51:09.296, Speaker A: Yeah. So there's one big effort going on this year that I think everyone in the industry should be paying attention to, and that is this idea of getting a market structure bill signed into law. And there's definitely an effort and a strategy by some in Congress to try to get that done this year. Whether or not that happens, I think, is an open question, but they're certainly on that path. So, rewinding, as you mentioned, and as we've been talking about, back in May, the House passed the 21 bill with 71 democratic votes, which is way more than anyone expected. Right. Like, I think if we had gotten 25 to 30 votes, that would have been considered a victory.
00:51:09.296 - 00:51:53.854, Speaker A: But I, 71 was a complete over performance and more success than I think even those of us in the industry that we were going to get. And so because it was so strongly bipartisan, the Senate realized that there's some momentum here and that they needed to work on a bill, too. Now, the Senate, I've worked as a staffer in both the Senate and the House. The Senate kind of considers themselves like, you know, typically the older, sort of calmer, more thoughtful group of Congress. You know, the Senate didn't just take fit 21 and, you know, move that through their committee process or to the floor. The Senate wants to take their own approach. So that's, that's pretty normal.
00:51:53.854 - 00:52:47.130, Speaker A: So what we see happening in the Senate is Debbie Stabenow, who is the chair, chairwoman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. She is working on a new piece of legislation called the Digital Commodities act. It's a little bit similar to the DCCPA from two years ago, but it's been reworked to solve some of the problems with the DCCPA. I think the biggest one is there seems to be a real effort to try to exclude DeFi. Whether or not that actually works in the details, I think, remains to be seen. But there's at least an acknowledgement that that DeFi should be saved for labor later. So, you know, there's a real chance that the Senate Agriculture Committee marks up this new legislation before the end of July, maybe, maybe August 1.
00:52:47.130 - 00:53:33.686, Speaker A: Now, the Senate Agriculture Committee only has a piece of it. Right? They oversee the CFTC. They do not oversee the SEC. And so the thinking is that if this happens when the bill goes to the Senate floor, probably sometime in September, then the SEC piece could be added on the Senate floor, and then the House could have the option of taking up that Senate bill, or it could get attached to kind of a year end package. So there's a lot of work going on behind the scenes right now to try to provide feedback to different pieces of, of the draft legislation. It's not publicly available yet. There's only sort of different pieces of it that are floating around.
00:53:33.686 - 00:54:21.380, Speaker A: And so I think at some point that will be made public, and we'll be able to get kind of a broader industry response to that bill, but it's definitely underway. I think the challenge we're going to run into is there's not that many legislative days left on the calendar? I think there's something like 22 or so days in the Senate and the House between now and the election. So their Congress is in for the last two weeks of July. Then they take a long break till the middle of September, which is sort of the custom. They usually work from their districts and states. During August, they're back in September. Typically in September, they need to get spending bills passed because the end of the fiscal year is at the end of September.
00:54:21.380 - 00:54:54.490, Speaker A: So there's, and then, you know, you've got jewish holidays in the mix. Like there's, there's only about three weeks of time where they can actually vote on, on legislation. And so the challenge will be, can they get some of that time? But then October, they all go home to campaign. So they are not voting, they're not doing committee meetings. And then, you know, depending on what happens with the election, there's another 20 or so days on the calendar between November, end of November and early December. But that those could be canceled.
00:54:54.790 - 00:55:01.730, Speaker C: Yeah. Okay, so brass, tax it for us. What do you handicap the odds that we get digital commodities act or something like it passed this year?
00:55:02.150 - 00:55:03.686, Speaker A: Like signed into law?
00:55:03.838 - 00:55:04.930, Speaker C: Signed into law?
00:55:05.630 - 00:55:13.886, Speaker A: I would say about maybe 15% to 20%, which is actually pretty high in legislative land, but it's not impossible.
00:55:14.078 - 00:55:14.814, Speaker C: Okay. All right.
00:55:14.862 - 00:55:17.014, Speaker A: So never go anywhere.
00:55:17.142 - 00:55:24.494, Speaker C: Sure, sure. Fine. Okay. Okay. So let's assume that that doesn't pass this year. What about stable coin legislation? How do you handicap those odds?
00:55:24.662 - 00:56:24.382, Speaker A: You know, I would say that's about the same. And the reason is I think market structure legislation could actually be a vehicle to pass stablecoin legislation. I do think stablecoin legislation could move in other ways. If you would talk to me even a week ago, I would have said that the odds are higher. The reason I think they're lower is because if, you know, I think in a post assassination attempt world, I think the odds that the Republicans keep the House and that Democrats lose the Senate are pretty high. So if you are a Republican in the House and it's after the election, in the lame duck period before the new Congress is signed in, you have very little incentive knowing that the Republicans are going to have the House and the Senate and the White House. I think the odds of that are pretty high right now.
00:56:24.382 - 00:56:31.810, Speaker A: And in that scenario, I don't see a lot of legislating happening at the end of the year that could change. It's a little bit hard to see.
00:56:32.110 - 00:56:45.560, Speaker C: Is what you're saying. If you're a Republican and you know that there's about to be a sweep then to pass legislation now is to compromise. And you don't want to compromise. Wait a few months and then get your cake and eat it, too. I see.
00:56:45.680 - 00:57:35.982, Speaker A: Yeah. But that being said, crypto as this amazing influence in power right now, and if anybody can overcome the convention, like if we can actually get a good bill, that, yes, provides the market regulatory piece, but provides a really strong clarity piece and keeps defi for later, like, that's a pretty good deal, I think. So if the details can get worked out quickly and it's good. I think the crypto industry has a lot of clout right now and that the timing might be right to get it done. So it could be the one exception to all of this. But traditionally, when you have a situation where all the House, the Senate and the White House are all controlled by the same party, that Congress tends to not do very much in the lame.
00:57:36.006 - 00:57:54.474, Speaker D: Deck and kristen, because both fit 21 and this new stabenow bill addressed the same thing. Which do you either think is better? Well, first question, which do you think is better? And then second, what do you think is more likely to actually be made into law?
00:57:54.562 - 00:58:44.030, Speaker A: You know, I haven't seen the full package of what the CFTC and the SEC piece in the Senate would look like together. I think, though, the way the process is working out is that the House would be very happy to take almost anything the Senate can pass. And so I think that fit 21 served a really important role in that. It brought a strong group of bipartisan members together, and it was a very, very symbolic vote. But, yeah, it's a little bit hard to compare right now because we don't have the two to compare side by side. But I think the reality is whatever the Senate sort of pushes through is probably going to be the piece that what ultimately is signed into law is probably going to be closer to what the Senate bill looks like than the House bill.
00:58:44.690 - 00:59:14.386, Speaker D: And one other question, because, so I know that both you and I believe that crypto is bipartisan as an issue. Just like, like I've always said. Oh, being against crypto is like saying, like, you're against the Internet or something. Like, like, yeah, it doesn't even make sense. But, like, obviously now the Republican Party has put it in their platform. And, you know, Vance is so obviously, he's, he's like a crypto person. Like he, you know, owns a bunch of bitcoin.
00:59:14.386 - 00:59:47.758, Speaker D: He's clearly very knowledgeable about all this stuff. And yet at the same time, like, like we've been talking about, we have some members of the Democratic Party that are coming around to this issue, but in, definitely in a late way, more like laggards. But do you feel like with the way things are playing out with the election or just electoral politics generally, that it is becoming still more of, like, a republican issue, or do you think, do you see it becoming more of a partisan issue, or do you think it's only a brief moment in time and it'll become.
00:59:47.894 - 01:00:40.730, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I think this is a brief, a brief moment in time. I mean, listen, if, if we have Republicans in charge of Congress in the White House, like, that's going to be very positive for crypto, right? Like, there's no question about that at this point. But that doesn't mean, like, if Democrats are in charge of Congress and the White House, that we can't also get there. We just have a little bit more work to do. And I think, you know, the engagements there, I think, you know, the challenge we had for the longest time was that, you know, sort of Gary Gensler and Elizabeth Warren had a monopoly over the policy, both from the administration standpoint and from the congressional standpoint. A lot of members of Congress deferred to those two people as to what to do on crypto, and the White House didn't think it was big enough for them to care, and so they just deferred as well to both of them. And so we've passed that.
01:00:40.730 - 01:01:19.598, Speaker A: There's a realization that there needs to be engagement. And again, as I said before, crypto's not asking for free pass. We're just asking for the kind of regulation that makes sense for the risks that the technology has. It's fundamentally different than a traditional financial services world. And so we need to have the right kind of rules. And so, no, I think it's definitely going to continue to be a bipartisan issue. But I will say, I mean, it's hard to argue that the Republicans aren't ahead at the moment, but it'll be interesting to see because democratic convention isn't until August.
01:01:19.598 - 01:01:36.118, Speaker A: They haven't put out their platform yet. And so, you know, I'm pretty hopeful that we'll hopefully see something in that platform as well. And that could be, you know, hopefully like a move that, like, signifies that this is something that we can continue to work on in a bipartisan way.
01:01:36.294 - 01:02:13.610, Speaker C: Okay. We're running up on time, but I want to ask you one last thing. Somewhat at the expense of overly focusing on the SEC, but at least in this industry and on this show, we like to kind of make the SEC the final boss. So let's assume because right now Trump is a front runner, obviously, but pauly market says he's about 70% to win, which means that 30% likelihood that actually we end up with a democratic White House. So the race is not over till it's over, but let's say that Biden wins, or Kamala, whatever. What do you think happened? Do you think we get another round of Gensler? Do you think we get somebody else in that seat? What does that sec.
01:02:14.710 - 01:02:55.080, Speaker A: I think Gensler sticks around a little while longer, just given sort of what I've been hearing. Oftentimes there's switches in a second administration, but I don't think Gensler is going to get his wish to be treasury secretary. There seems he's got a lot of enemies within his own, within the Biden administration. I don't think he's going to get the nomination. And moreover, I don't think he gets confirmed by the Senate. Remember, the Senate has to confirm all of the nominees that the president puts forward. And so I think he can definitely serve out his term, but I don't think he's likely to come back after that.
01:02:55.240 - 01:03:00.940, Speaker C: Okay. And generally in that situation, do you promote one of the commissioners or do you appoint somebody new to be chair?
01:03:02.320 - 01:03:15.532, Speaker A: Usually if there's no chair, you can have, like, an interim chair, but typically the president likes to appoint or nominate the commissioner that they will then make the chair. So not always.
01:03:15.596 - 01:03:18.840, Speaker C: So it's usually fresh blood. It's not one of the present commissioners?
01:03:19.980 - 01:03:32.140, Speaker A: Usually, yes, not always, but usually they try to, that's a pretty coveted position. And so they usually like to find someone, you know, new that they bring in to do that.
01:03:32.260 - 01:03:39.220, Speaker C: So the commissioners are usually like sort of bureaucrats who've risen through the ranks. But the chair, you know, the commissioners.
01:03:39.520 - 01:04:26.172, Speaker A: Yeah, the commissioners are, they're often former Hill staffers. You know, it's very hard to find people to nominate that don't have complex background or conflicts of interest. And so, yeah, they're often committee staffers or, you know, like, Lizaraga is a former Pelosi staffer. You know, Hester Purse worked as a Senate banking committee staffer. You know, you oftentimes it's often easier to confirm somebody who's worked in Congress and knows the people doing the nominating at the commissioner level. But usually the chair is somebody with a, you know, slightly more robust resume, but it's not unheard of. You can have, you know, the president can choose whoever they want.
01:04:26.172 - 01:04:30.786, Speaker A: And if there's a superstar commissioner, they may choose to, but that person.
01:04:30.858 - 01:04:43.186, Speaker C: Okay, that's true. In 1 minute. Play out the fanfic for us. What happens if Trump gets elected and appoints a new SEC commissioner or a new SEC chair chair chairperson? What does that SEC do first year?
01:04:43.218 - 01:04:44.790, Speaker D: And who do you think it would be?
01:04:46.730 - 01:05:18.740, Speaker A: You know, that's a good question. I actually haven't heard who the who Trump would ultimately put forward. You know, I heard a couple names in the name of speculation, like Chris Giancarlo is a name that I hear quite a bit. He used to share the CFTC and I think he would be an excellent choice. But, yeah, I don't know. But I think the one thing that we'll see is the regulation by enforcement is going to stop, I think, immediately.
01:05:19.320 - 01:05:20.780, Speaker C: What about the ongoing cases?
01:05:22.010 - 01:05:51.080, Speaker A: The ongoing cases, there's a couple things that could happen. They could kind of continue to play out. There is a world where they could be completely dropped. I think the more likely thing is there might be some sort of settlement there that provides kind of a pathway forward. But, yeah, I think that's going to be on a case by case basis. But no, they could continue if there is a strong case. But no, I don't think that will be immediate.
01:05:51.080 - 01:06:32.340, Speaker A: I think that will take more time. And then we could see a rulemaking effort out of the agencies to try to provide some sort of clarity on some of the issues that are outstanding out there. I do think at the end of the day, we're going to need Congress to come in and give new authority to federal agencies to actually do kind of market structure correctly. But there are some things that the SEC could do with its existing exemptive authority that provides some clarity for crypto. So I think we could see that that, again will be a longer process. But I think immediately the first thing on day one is just the fear of regulation by enforcement. Well, we'll stop.
01:06:33.840 - 01:06:50.290, Speaker C: Awesome. Okay. Well, we've got a lot to look forward to this year and a lot to fear this year as well. As always, thanks for coming on and always appreciate all your hard work. Godspeed out there. I know this is going to be a really intense second half of the year for you guys, so appreciate all the work you do.
01:06:50.910 - 01:07:04.290, Speaker A: Yeah, well, it's a lot more fun to be doing this as a winning, coordinated, organized industry as opposed to kind of the underfunded underdog. So we'll take this posture anytime.
01:07:04.670 - 01:07:09.214, Speaker C: Awesome. All right, that's it for this week. Thanks for coming on, Kristen. Everybody.
01:07:09.262 - 01:07:10.530, Speaker A: All right, see you, guys. Hi, everyone.
