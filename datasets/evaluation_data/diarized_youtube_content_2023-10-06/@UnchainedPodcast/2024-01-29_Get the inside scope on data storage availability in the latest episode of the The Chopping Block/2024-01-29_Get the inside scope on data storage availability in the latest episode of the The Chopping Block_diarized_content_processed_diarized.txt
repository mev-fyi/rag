00:00:00.170 - 00:00:48.100, Speaker A: You're starting to see people who have real users and are paying the DA costs suddenly be like, wait, I don't want to pay the DA costs anymore. And I think the market is starting to flip into this fee mindset now. Even if the DA layers lower the fees to Solana like levels for a lot of these applications, I think that's like the goal in some ways of like, you know, if we zoom out and you're listening to the show and you're like, who the fuck cares about this? Data storage is rural storage versus long term. Who cares? All you need to think about is this allows you to lower fees in some certain way because it turns out these data storage fees are quite high if you make them perpetual, but if you time bound them, you can make them cheap. And I still don't think that you can say that roll ups are like one to one with Solana just because the fees are the same, because I really think the UX difference is still not very non trivial between the two.
