It was a project that came up during the iron finance collapse of their token, where Mark Cuban lost tens of millions of dollars overnight. And it was a huge news story.

But this crew had been rugging $200,000, $100,000 every few months here and there. And suddenly they found themselves with $24 million in their bank overnight. And so they were like, okay, let's go.
