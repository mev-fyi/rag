Today's guest is Nick Hansen, cofounder and CEO of Luxury Technologies, a mining software services company.
00:01:39.882 - 00:01:41.130, Speaker B: Welcome, Nick.
00:01:41.550 - 00:01:43.200, Speaker A: Hi, thanks for having me on.
00:01:43.730 - 00:02:17.400, Speaker B: This week, there has been a slew of mostly negative news about bitcoin miners, and it even goes back to September, when crypto mining data center operator Compute North filed for bankruptcy. Mining firm Argo Blockchain attempted to raise $27 million, but that fell through and that sent its stock price plunging. And Core Scientific, the largest miner by hashrate, has said that it may have to file for bankruptcy. Still, at the same time, it actually looks like a few companies are weathering the storm. But why don't you just give us the general overview? How would you describe the state of affairs for bitcoin mining right now?
00:02:18.010 - 00:02:52.642, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks for the question. So right now we're seeing, in my view, the lowest margin environment that we've ever seen for bitcoin miners to date. And there's a couple of reasons for that. One, the metric of their output is called hash price. And hash price is now at the lowest we've seen since 2020, which was just after the most recent having. And what that means is miners revenues are as low as they've ever been as of right now. The other end of that equation is their inputs, which is generally just electricity cost.
00:02:52.642 - 00:03:47.686, Speaker A: But we're seeing high electricity costs across the board. So if your inputs are the most expensive they've ever been and your outputs are the lowest they've ever been. That means the amount that you can make in the middle, the margin, is the lowest it's ever been. And so that's what's really pressuring miners right now, is just the reduced margin that they have to operate under. Currently that is compounded by the fact that we saw a trend start around 18 to 24 months ago where miners were taking out loans to finance future hash rate, effectively leveraging up and the amortization schedule of that debt over the generally a pretty aggressive term around 24 months or less is causing them to be cash flow negative. So some of them generate net profit, but they don't generate enough free cash flow to pay for their debts. And that's the situation that we're in right now.
00:03:47.686 - 00:04:02.902, Speaker A: We've seen that with many of the miners that have gone under. So that's the super high level of where we're at in bitcoin mining and why all of these companies are feeling the pressure, more pressure than they probably ever felt.
00:04:03.046 - 00:04:30.020, Speaker B: Yeah, one thing I also want to ask about was that I read at this moment that in the US alone, more than a quarter million of brand new mining rigs are still sitting unused. And the exact number of unused rigs isn't totally clear. But in a CoinDesk article about this, they wrote, whatever the exact number is, this much is clear. The economics at the core of crypto are completely out of whack. So how did this end up happening?
00:04:30.710 - 00:05:16.420, Speaker A: So the number of machines sitting latent is due to a confluence of events. We've seen, again, increasing prices. So there isn't that immediacy by miners to get machines turned on. So right now they're seeing, okay, well, if I can't get a good deal for my hosting rate, or I can't get a good deal for my power costs, I'd rather just let these miners sit and maybe wait for a better time to plug them in. And then there's also the other end. There's actually not a lot of hosting space available. So even if miners did happen to say, okay, I'm willing to take the risk and operate in this super low margin environment, they may not even be able to find somewhere to plug in the big bull run up to 65K, actually, around this time last year.
00:05:16.420 - 00:05:47.610, Speaker A: The hosting space hasn't caught up with that quite yet. And so we've seen Compute North was going to be potentially the largest host in North America, and they succumbed to the bear market. And I think we're starting to see that that hosting space is continuing to be constrained. So that means miners just aren't getting plugged in. And that may continue, especially as we see this lower margin environment where there just isn't the urgency to plug in machines.
00:05:48.590 - 00:06:04.240, Speaker B: So can you walk us through the calculus that miners have to make when it comes to determining whether their efforts will be profitable? You mentioned a few of these things like energy and the hosting and all that. So just walk people through? Yeah.
00:06:04.690 - 00:06:27.266, Speaker A: That machine behind me is called an S Nine. It's very old. I use it for testing. That produces around ten TerraHash per second. The hash price today is about $0.07, which means seven cents per TerraHash per second, which means that that thing will produce around seventy cents per day. If we look back at this time last year, hash price was around $0.40.
00:06:27.266 - 00:07:09.602, Speaker A: So that thing would be producing significantly more than it is now, what we're seeing now. So it'll be about $4 a day. So that is the revenue that miners make. And so, since we're in this very low hash price environment, I'm not as incentivized to plug in machines if I'm only going to make seven cents per TerraHash per second right now in 2020, that we did see hash price this low or close to this low in 2020. But the main difference was the energy price was significantly lower across the board. And so at that time, it was still worth it to get machines plugged in. That's why we didn't see as many machines sitting unused.
00:07:09.602 - 00:08:01.846, Speaker A: Now, the calculus that you would use to determine whether I should plug in a machine or not is you take your input costs, subtract them from your revenues, your potential revenues, and determine what your margin would be and decide if that makes sense for your business model. Traditional wisdom would indicate that miners are looking for somewhere between a two year and 30 month payback period. But right now, we're seeing payback periods much, much longer than that. Which means that miners, if they make an investment today, aren't going to be in the green or in the black for probably close to five years, which, given traditional wisdom, would indicate that you should not deploy right now. So that's where we're at right now. Unless you have some crazy low power rate or you've got an innovative way of reducing your input costs, that's going to be the calculus until hash price turns around.
00:08:02.028 - 00:08:15.050, Speaker B: So traditionally, miners have been able to relocate to seek out cheaper electricity fees. I haven't seen much talk about that. Why is that not something people are pursuing?
00:08:15.390 - 00:08:52.326, Speaker A: So we're at much different scale this cycle as well. This cycle we're seeing individual miners with individual mining companies, with hundreds of thousands of machines moving that as an operational overhead is massively operationally intensive. Going and physically unplugging 100,000 machines, putting them in boxes, paying for the shipping to put them somewhere else. It's very intensive. So a lot of folks would, or a lot of companies would prefer to just sit on that inventory at their hosted site. There's also not anywhere for them to go right now either. Generally, they would go to other places around the world.
00:08:52.326 - 00:09:10.780, Speaker A: But energy prices across the globe are high, except for in some countries, which are now sanctioned. And you can't really do business with them anymore. So that's the reason miners right now are most likely not going to be able to they're not moving currently and they're probably not going to be able to move just because there isn't anywhere to go.
00:09:11.390 - 00:09:27.170, Speaker B: Wow, okay. And one of the bigger pieces of news that I referenced at the beginning was the possibility that core scientific would file for bankruptcy. Obviously that is the largest minor at the moment. So what impact do you think that could have on the wider sector?
00:09:27.670 - 00:10:25.250, Speaker A: So there's a multitude of events that could occur from corsi going under one, they are also the biggest host and so there's many companies that are with core scientific that are potentially not going to be able to continue to operate. So we could see second order disruptions from this event. Corsi also has a lot of machines themselves. A lot of them are under secured by or they are under mining debt, so they're under debt. And so those loans require the lender to take those as collateral. And most likely, if I had to guess, those lenders are going to liquidate those machines rather than hold them or mine them themselves. And I would bet if they do start to liquidate those machines, we could see a cascading event where the value of mining machines drop significantly over the next three to six months as those liquidations occur.
00:10:26.550 - 00:10:41.980, Speaker B: Oh, wow. Okay. Yeah. So we'll see what happens with that. It'll probably all play out over the next couple of months before the year's end. So in a moment we're going to talk more about potential solutions to what ails bitcoin miners. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make the show possible.
00:10:41.980 - 00:11:24.550, Speaker B: DeFi Saver is an all in one management app for the top lending protocols on Ethereum, including aave, maker, liquidy and compound. They have dedicated protocol dashboards with options for quick leverage adjustment and self liquidation, as well as automated liquidation protection options with stop loss, trailing stops, and automated unwinding options. They also have loan shifting tools for collateral and debt swaps and instantly moving positions between different protocols. You can try DFI saver today on ethereum. Arbitrum and optimism. For years you've heard about the promise of blockchain technology, and yet high fees, security risks, and unreliable chains have been the reality. It doesn't have to be this way.
00:11:24.550 - 00:12:10.514, Speaker B: Avalanche believes innovators deserve web three infrastructure they can count on with the flexibility and tooling to build anything they want, any way they want.

Avalanche create without limits. Back to my conversation with Nick. One interesting development I saw was the creation of a lending pool created by maple Finance to help struggling miners.
00:12:10.514 - 00:12:18.802, Speaker B: This is one of the D Five protocols and they're already helping ten miners and there are another 25 on the list. I was curious what you thought of this effort.
00:12:18.946 - 00:12:52.290, Speaker A: So that has been a trend we've seen over the last couple of months is these so called distressed mining funds coming to market to potentially aid and provide liquidity to miners. Now, they're certainly not doing this out of the goodness of their heart, so there's going to be a premium for that capital. And right now, since there is such a demand for dollars for new capital, I haven't seen what the deal terms look like for these yet, but I have to imagine that they're very much in favor of the lender.
00:12:53.110 - 00:13:03.400, Speaker B: Yeah, I did see the interest rate was around 18% to 20% and these loans are being offered on what's called a full recourse basis. Could you explain that? I think I sort of understand.
00:13:04.970 - 00:13:48.406, Speaker A: Of course, the 18% is actually a little bit higher than we would have expected to see around this time last year. So most of the loans that were issued to big miners were on the order of twelve to 14, maybe 15%. It looks like they're adding on some more of risk premium. We did see a few of those types of loans go out last year, but those were for smaller, more nation miners that were trying to lever up more in a riskier way. And then of course, full recourse. Meaning they'll be able to take not just the entity, but I believe that they can take the entire business. Sorry, they won't be able to take not just the machines, but they'll be able to take the entire business.
00:13:48.406 - 00:14:48.706, Speaker A: In that case is especially concerning if you are a minor, you're putting up your entire business, not just the collateral for the loans. It's kind of like saying when I go buy a car, if I use a full recourse loan for my car, not only can they repo my car, if I don't make my payments, they can repo my house or my boat or anything else that any other assets your 401k, any other assets you might have to make themselves whole? So certainly that's the most lender friendly term that we've ever seen in mining loans. But there are more of these distressed funds coming to bear. We've seen Finance launched a $500 million, they had a 500 million dollar pool of capital. BitDeer put up $250,000,000 in capital, and there's probably close to a billion dollars worth or more even of capital available to miners. But they are going to come at these exceptionally lender friendly rate terms and rates.
00:14:48.898 - 00:14:53.126, Speaker B: Is your sense that these are helpful or not helpful?
00:14:53.318 - 00:15:17.010, Speaker A: It is yet to be seen. I'm certain anybody that's in a situation that needs capital would find them to be helpful. One of the reasons that most of these miners are in the situation that they're in is because they've already taken debt that had more favorable terms. And so I imagine tacking on more debt with less favorable terms. I can't see how that turns out well, but there may be situations where it makes sense.
00:15:17.160 - 00:15:51.390, Speaker B: Well, let's talk about some of the brighter spots in the market. Marathon, for instance, which is also publicly listed, mined 615 bitcoin in October, which was the highest monthly total it had ever seen. I think it was like roughly what it had mined in all of q three stronghold. Digital was able to eliminate more than $67 million in debt and also restructure some debt. Bitcoin miner CleanSpark bought almost 4000 new machines. Canadian minor Digihost announced that it was debt free and cash flow positive. What do you think separates these firms from their competition?
00:15:51.970 - 00:16:42.300, Speaker A: So, marathon, they all have their own very specific reasons for being exceptionally well positioned, but it all mostly boils down to being very liquid and having plenty of capital at the right time in the market. So they effectively timed the market correctly. Marathon has raised the most money of all of the publicly traded miners, and they were able to keep a nice stash of that capital available on the sidelines and are able to deploy continually. Same with CleanSpark. They are buying sites and buying machines in a distressed environment, which means they're getting the best pricing that anybody's ever gotten. So the marathon machines, those are machines that they purchased around this time last year and are starting to get turned on. And that's really exciting and great to see that they're able to operate that way.
00:16:42.300 - 00:17:12.230, Speaker A: They do have exposure to compute north and they didn't mention that in the filing. So it's uncertain what their roadmap will be. We'll have to see what their earning. They'll probably expand more during the earnings release. The miners that have done really well, really the common thread is that they have cash on the balance sheet ready to deploy. They have low debt, low encumbrance, and have positive free cash flow, which means that they can continue to weather the storm without having too much dilution.
00:17:12.650 - 00:17:38.380, Speaker B: There's always been talk about how bitcoin mining could be combined with producing renewable energy. And I did see that there was one new startup, aspen creek digital, which raised $8 million in a series a that is focused on that. Do you see this bear market as a good time for bitcoin miners to kind of try alternative methods for really any aspect of their business?
00:17:38.850 - 00:18:26.590, Speaker A: I hold personally that the bitcoin mining is going to revolutionize many parts of our lives, and specifically bitcoin mining will revolutionize the green energy transition. Certainly. Luxor is an investor in aspen creek. We work very closely with them and really like the team there. And I view that type of investment really accelerating right now as cash is king. Most investments are probably going to be a little bit slower, but I do think that as bitcoin miners continue to monetize latent or stranded energy and continue to provide that demand response service to the grid, we'll continue to see new investment made into bitcoin miners, specifically through the lens of energy innovation. And I think that that's going to be the trend of the next five years.
00:18:26.590 - 00:18:34.858, Speaker A: I actually have been writing some pieces specifically on this because I think that's one of the most exciting parts of the bitcoin mining industry.
00:18:35.034 - 00:18:41.954, Speaker B: Talk a little bit more about that. When you say that you think this will be the trend of the next five years, where do you see that going?
00:18:42.152 - 00:19:33.618, Speaker A: So I think right now we'll see bitcoin miners get colocated very closely to sustainable generation sources. So let's be a little bit more tangible. So bitcoin miners will be colocated next to most, like wind farms and solar farms, a wind farm, it's very hard to predict. You could maybe predict what tomorrow's generation is going to look like, but it's very impossible to predict what December twelveTH generation is going to look like for a wind farm. And there are costs associated with curtailing, meaning reducing the amount of energy produced by a wind farm, because you have to turn on the brakes and all that stuff. It's much easier to just spin up some sort of load resource like a bitcoin mine underneath. So on energy grids, there's this thing called the demand curve delta, which is the amount of demand at the peak and the amount of demand at the trough of the day around the US.
00:19:33.618 - 00:20:32.098, Speaker A: That delta is somewhere around 200 gigawatts on any given day. If you could produce some way to raise the trough and lower the top and basically reduce that delta, it would reduce the amount of loss and improve the efficiency of the grid across the board. So I think that bitcoin mining comes in and makes a really compelling argument as to why it should be used for providing this consistent baseload. As we continue to progress towards a renewable energy future, our generation assets become more and more intermittent. And so there needs to be extra capacity to provide all of the energy for all of the demand that there is at different times. So we also need to also invest in nuclear energy and we've seen miners getting colocated with nuclear energy assets as well. So lots of reasons why bitcoin mining will continue to incentivize and lead the green energy revolution.
00:20:32.098 - 00:20:36.054, Speaker A: And I think we're just getting started and Aspen creek is a great example of that.
00:20:36.252 - 00:21:05.780, Speaker B: So, last quick question. Obviously at this moment, I don't really know what is going to catalyze the bitcoin price to go higher. So we could continue to see a trade in this sort of low $20,000 range for quite a bit. And I was just wondering, assuming that this sort of shakeup in bitcoin mining continues, what do you see as happening on the other side aside from what you mentioned in terms of this green revolution shakeup, do you see the industry changing in other ways as well?
00:21:06.390 - 00:21:47.034, Speaker A: There's a couple of things. One, we've never had a real return on cash throughout the existence of bitcoin's life, meaning there's never been a real interest rate. There's actually an interest rate now that can be generated on cash. And now this is the first time any cryptos bitcoin, any of them, have had to compete with that environment. So investors are going to remain less risky, as there is this real return on cash, and we'll see how that affects the overall ecosystem. The ecosystem never existed when there was real returns on cash. Now, as for bitcoin mining, specifically, again, miners are capital intensive.
00:21:47.034 - 00:22:23.994, Speaker A: They require a lot of capital to get up and running, and so that capital is going to come at a higher cost. And so we may see slower expansion. The investment into bitcoin mining may become a bit muted over the next three to five years as this washout occurs. I would imagine that over the next three to five years, it will be a slow growth, but there will certainly be another run just like there is in every commodities market. It's just a matter of being well positioned. So miners that are able to build now, like marathon and CleanSpark are probably going to be the best position for taking advantage of that next run.

Elon musk's acquisition of twitter has firmly grappled the attention of the crypto community. The billionaire founder of tesla announced plans to charge $20 a month for the twitter blue checkmark, which twitter has long used to verify public figures on the social media platform.
00:23:41.730 - 00:24:11.526, Speaker B: But that move attracted a lot of criticism, most prominently from horror writer Stephen king. Musk later lowered the price to $8 a month and added a few additional benefits. The crypto community still wasn't happy. Vitalik. Buterin tweeted musk's idea could damage the blue checkmark's antiscam role. Indeed, for a while, scammers would take over verified accounts and use them to nefarious purposes. However, Musk's purchase of Twitter will have a more tangible impact on specific players in crypto.
00:24:11.526 - 00:25:03.070, Speaker B: The block reported that FTX founder Sam Binkman Fried's stake in Twitter would give him the right to receive $50 million to $100 million based on Musk's purchase price. Speaking of crypto exchange CEOs finances, Changpang Zhao, who is a minority investor in Twitter, said he would join Twitter's board if invited by Musk, though he mentioned that he is not dying to take up the opportunity. Coinbase misses revenue estimates but increases interest income. Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the US by trading volume, announced its Q three earnings late Thursday. The company reported a decline in monthly trading users, but the number came in higher than expected. Additionally, analysts were projecting quarterly revenue of $641,000,000, but the exchange reported revenue of only $590,000,000.01. Notable item in its earnings was the interest income.
00:25:03.070 - 00:25:59.130, Speaker B: Jeff Roberts, the editor of Fortune Crypto, pointed out that the interest income from USDC tripled since the last quarter, surpassing the 100 million dollar level. USDC is a stablecoin that Coinbase owns through a consortium with circle the issuer of the token as users deposit US dollars to mint USDC, the two companies use those dollars to buy highly liquid interest bearing assets like treasury bills. Roberts highlighted that the income derived from USDC, especially in a rising interest rates environment, could help Coinbase navigate the crypto winter. Following the earnings release, the company stock Coin first dropped by 4%, but then recuperated the losses to trade at 3.5% higher than the closing price. Alameda's balance sheet stirs unease alameda Research sam Bankman fried's trading shop held $14.6 billion worth of assets as of June 30, according to a private document reviewed by CoinDesk.
00:25:59.130 - 00:26:43.150, Speaker B: It's unclear if this represents all of the company's assets or just a portion. However, if it is a complete representation, the largest asset on the company's balance sheet is unlocked FTT, the token issued by Bankman Fried's Crypto Exchange FTX. CoinDesk reported that Alameda holds $3.66 billion worth of unlocked FTT and $2.16 billion worth of FTT collateral. That so much of Alameda's holdings were issued by its sister company raises concerns. Corey Clifton, the CEO of investment platform Swan Bitcoin, said It's fascinating to see that the majority of the net equity in the Alameda business is actually FTX's own, centrally controlled and printed out of thin air.
00:26:43.150 - 00:27:37.326, Speaker B: Token surajit Chatterjee steps down as Coinbase chief product officer. Coinbase's chief product officer, Surajit Chatterjee is stepping down during the company's latest restructuring. Chatterjee will be leaving on November 30, but will continue to advise the crypto exchange until February 2023. In a filing, Coinbase said that it is grateful for Mr. Chatterjee's contributions throughout his employment at Coinbase. Jeff Roberts, author of Kings of Crypto, a book on Coinbase, tweeted this guy was hired for $646,000,000 exclamation point and most memorable thing he did was bungle. Coinbase's NFT Launch crypto lender hoddlenot reveals a $190,000,000 loss in Terra USD bloomberg reported that embattled crypto lender Hoddlenot lost about $190,000,000 when Doe Kwan's Terra ecosystem collapsed in May.
00:27:37.326 - 00:28:53.922, Speaker B: According to Bloomberg, officials appointed by the Singapore High Court claimed that Hodlnaut's directors downplayed the extent of the group's exposure to Terra and Luna around the time of the Coin's collapse. Speaking of troubled lenders, the creditors committee for bankrupt firm Celsius Network is investigating whether the crypto lender was a Ponzi scheme after customers raised concerns about how the company had used their money. A lawyer for the committee said that it hadn't determined whether the company was a Ponzi, but noted flags that came up. Doe Kwan said to be living illegally in Europe as investors sue KBS, the South Korean national broadcaster, reported that prosecutors obtained a chat log in which Kwon directed an employee to manipulate the price of Terra. A prosecutor's office official told KBS, I can't reveal the details, but it was a conversation history where CEO Kwan specifically ordered price manipulation. Prosecutors have also ascertained that he is living in Europe as an illegal immigrant, but because his passport has been invalidated, he cannot legally travel between countries. Additionally, the Wall Street Journal reported that a group of 350 Terra investors who lost $57 million when the stablecoin imploded are suing the founder of TerraForm Labs.
