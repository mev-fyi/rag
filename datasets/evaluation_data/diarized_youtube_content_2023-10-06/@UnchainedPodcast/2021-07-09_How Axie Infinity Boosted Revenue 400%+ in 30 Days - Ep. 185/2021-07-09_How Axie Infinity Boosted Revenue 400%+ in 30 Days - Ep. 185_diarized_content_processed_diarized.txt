00:01:29.690 - 00:01:35.930, Speaker A: Today's guest is Alexander Larson, cofounder and CEO of Axio Infinity. Welcome, Alexander.
00:01:36.430 - 00:01:38.620, Speaker C: Thanks, Laura. Happy to be here.
00:01:39.070 - 00:02:04.370, Speaker A: Axio Infinity is having quite the moment. As of Wednesday night, it had done about 28 times the trading volume of NBA TOPSHOT and the price of both the Axio Infinity Token and the small love potion token. They're both up quite a lot in the last week. But before we dive into all that, let's just make sure all the listeners have a baseline level of knowledge. Tell us, what is Axie infinity?
00:02:05.030 - 00:02:24.810, Speaker C: Sure, Laura. So, at a very high level, Axie Infinity is a digital pet game universe where you have cute game characters called Axies that can be used across various games. Some of the games are created by us, and some of the games in the future will be created by the community and other developers.
00:02:25.550 - 00:02:31.210, Speaker A: And so why has there been such an uptick in activity on Axio Infinity as of late?
00:02:32.110 - 00:03:37.810, Speaker C: Yeah, it's a combination of, I think, just actually hard work over several years. We've been building since very early 2018, been tackling a lot of scaling issues and finding product market fit over time. And then some of that was being hindered because we were using Ethereum as the base layer for all the asset ownership. So part of the game was basically unavailable for many, many players. And now, over the past 60 days, we've seen tremendous growth because we changed a large part of our infrastructure to our own side chain, to Ethereum, which is called Ronan. And that's pretty much where the growth is coming from, because we had a lot of pent up demand from many, many players who were very excited to play the game, but just simply couldn't because the barriers of entry were too high and they're still really high. But there was also a lot of fees that were being extracted by Ethereum, especially as we were competing with DFI and I guess DFI Summer over the past couple of twelve months or so, and other NFTs.
00:03:37.810 - 00:03:57.430, Speaker C: Yeah, interesting thing, when NFT drops are happening that also spikes the gas price really high blocked space is such a precious commodity and I think that's something that we as a team have experienced very in depth and has influenced our decision to move down this path.
00:03:57.850 - 00:04:03.260, Speaker A: I love Axie Infinity's Origin Story. Can you tell us how you all got started?
00:04:04.110 - 00:05:02.586, Speaker C: Yeah, it's pretty interesting because we gathered or we met each other first playing CryptoKitties early or late in 2017, and that's really when we started to understand the power of NFTs. And I was convinced that it's probably going to change the way that games are being played forever. We didn't have massive experience in creating games. One of our co founders had been creating games since he was younger, but nothing very in depth. We kind of came into it a bit naively, had an initial sale of the Axie assets and then we kind of kept learning and learning along the way. Shipped a few games, some maybe weren't amazing, but now a lot of people are understanding where the value is coming from. So, yeah, we just gathered, played that game and then we figured that maybe CryptoKitties had a little bit of a different idea of how this should turn out.
00:05:02.586 - 00:05:15.600, Speaker C: And I think they also understood that there are many scaling issues and then we just decided to double down on that one thing rather than focusing on many, many, I would say different products, everything inside the same universe, and that's really how it happened.
00:05:16.530 - 00:05:36.230, Speaker A: So I understand there's kind of like a CryptoKitties element to Axio Infinity in the sense that you can breed these pets. So can you describe how Axie Infinity uses blockchain technology and NFTs in a way that adds to the game and then separates it from typical video games?
00:05:36.890 - 00:06:33.226, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. I think the way we can go down to kind of game mechanics, which is the breeding, which is happening on chain, where when you are breeding to axes, the genes are mixed. And then we have an algorithm which then decides what's being like the child, how that will look like, and that also consumes some, ERC, 20 tokens on the Ronan side chain. I think that's more on that technical side, but more on the high level side. What are the benefits of actually building on blockchain technology? In our opinion, it's actually related to the transparency of players can actually see what's happening. Ideally it would be all fully decentralized, but I think what we understood is that it's a long way out until you can get there. So transparency is a big part of it and the ability for people to own their own game assets and actually withdraw them or use them in many different things if that's really what they want to.
00:06:33.226 - 00:06:57.790, Speaker C: And in our opinion it's related to actually owning your digital identity. Game assets is such a natural thing for many, many players and it's pretty much where people start their digital journey. So it only makes sense that that's also what they would own and then be able to bring with them to many different things. Even if they can't use that, it's just the point of that they have it and that's a part of your history and identity.
00:06:57.950 - 00:07:07.058, Speaker A: And so earlier when you were saying that you expected that others would also develop games on top, presumably that's where they would take these assets to.
00:07:07.224 - 00:07:56.440, Speaker C: Yeah, so we actually started seeing this happening very early in 2018 because when we were on Ethereum, we had an API. People were able to tap into all the art assets of Axes and they started making something like Flappy Axe, which is like a flappy bird clone, pretty much where you sign in using web3 and then you can fly around with your axe. That was like the very first proof of concept of a game that's not created by the main developers but by someone else. And that really made us understand the potential for NFTs in the long term that they are the perfect vehicle for creating these larger game universes and then eventually what could become like a meta universe where all the assets of many many different games are being pulled into, but that's I think maybe a decade ahead.
00:07:57.610 - 00:08:08.230, Speaker A: So a lot is also made of this play to earn concept in Axio Infinity. Can you explain what that is and also why that's so powerful?
00:08:08.730 - 00:09:34.770, Speaker C: Play to earn is an interesting concept because a lot of, I guess more traditional game developers and skeptics, they don't really understand how it's possible that people can actually play a game to make money, but everything is actually tied into the way the economy works. And to understand that, first you need to our thesis is that games are networks and if you can reward players for contribution to their network, that basically means that you can do yield farming inside games as long as there is the yield that's being generated by these players that has a specific use case inside the game. So for us, the smooth love potion for example, that's like a core piece of how the play to earn economy works. It's not something that we've ever sold as a company. The only way you can get that smooth love potion or small love potion as it used to be called, is by actually playing the game. And that part it's basically proof of work or proof of play because you play the game and you are rewarded by this token which then again is required to breed for a new axe and if there isn't any like if nobody's playing the game there will not be produced any new axes. So players are I would say they see that we have this game, they want some axes and then there was an initial sale of axes where they were able to get their first ones so this kind of SLP production could start.
00:09:34.770 - 00:10:33.702, Speaker C: And I think that's where we come from. And the reason why we can reward players is once again it comes from that network effect thing that we're looking for because each person in our opinion they have unlimited potential to add value to any kind of network. They tell their friends they can create content, they are streamers, they do all of these things that connects humans together and that's why we can afford to reward them. And then there's another challenge for games I think it's the same thing. It's not the same thing as mining crypto but where you have people who are not abusing per se but in the game sense they are bought in crypto sense they might be using asics miners or things that are way too efficient or kind of it changes the rules of the game so to say. So we are combating that a little bit and that kind of goes against the decentralized ethos but for us this is how we have to build a network. You can't just ship it's not finished by just shipping it.
00:10:33.702 - 00:11:43.230, Speaker C: It requires a lot of iteration and I think that's how we found that play to earn kind of makes sense for us. And I guess as a final point I would say that it's related to also how we view players because in a traditional game studio your goal as a game studio is always to extract the maximum amount of value from the players. In Axie, we actually delayed the gratification pretty heavily, so we had these smaller early sales where we did primary sales. But then rather than, I guess, diluting the NFTs by reissuing more and more and more, we kept just adding more and more value to the NFTs that we issued. And that is a very kind of different way of looking at it, because we believe in the long tail of the ecosystem so that we can capture value from a protocol or rather game perspective if there is a long tail. And that's really when the marketplace fees start to kick in, when people start using the product because they love it, because they actually want to play the game. And that, I think, is the key here, because you need to make something that people actually love to play and that they want to hold onto these assets.
00:11:44.130 - 00:11:51.200, Speaker A: So in a moment we're going to discuss more about some of these issues but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this year possible.
00:11:52.530 - 00:12:52.098, Speaker B: Did you know nearly $338,000,000 worth of NFTs were sent last year and in 2021, that number is growing faster than ever. If you're looking to make your first NFT, check out Near's fast, scalable, low cost open source platform. Near is investing 80 million Near Tokens in communityled projects over the course of five years to power sustainable innovation through its ecosystem. With fundraising opportunities and support for Dows and DAPs to engage fans and reach new audiences, come learn why near is the infrastructure for innovation@nea.org designed for the next generation of blockchain. The Oasis Network is the first privacy enabled blockchain platform for open finance and a responsible data economy. Combined with its high throughput and secure architecture, the Oasis Network is able to power private scalable DeFi, revolutionizing open finance, and expanding it beyond traders and early adopters to a mass market.
00:12:52.098 - 00:13:09.370, Speaker B: Its unique privacy features can not only redefine DeFi, but also create a new type of digital asset called tokenized data that can enable users to take control of the data they generate and earn rewards for staking it with applications, creating the first ever responsible data economy.
00:13:10.270 - 00:13:33.620, Speaker A: Back to my conversation with Alexander Larson. So going back to that bot issue that you mentioned, I saw people were criticizing that, you know, put the posh on that, and I wondered, is that something that you feel you would just do now in this early stage while you're kind of more centralized, or do you imagine that that would even happen later on?
00:13:34.390 - 00:14:44.546, Speaker C: There's an ongoing discussion about how decentralized the game should be, and you have the purists that believe that all rules should be on chain and what's possible from a bot perspective. If bots can use it, then they should be allowed to use it. And it kind of goes a little bit against the network thing that we are aiming for because we need humans to actually care about the product. And if only bots are there, it's only fun for the people who own the bots and not real humans. So we're very confident in our approach right now, even though it isn't decentralized per se, because the game as a whole is like there's so many centralized pieces of the game that we can tweak here and there because it's not ready to be released into the wild as a decentralized product. I'm not going to say that we're ever going to get there because it has never been created before in a sustainable way where you can actually do this, can actually have a release of tokens without some kind of bottle abusing the principles of the rules of the game that you set. But, I mean, we do have an approach where we want to turn Axie into more of a decentralized organization.
00:14:44.546 - 00:15:33.240, Speaker C: I don't like the word dao per se because I think an autonomous organization is also really far fetched. But having a decentralized organization where we can have token holders who have a stake in the ecosystem not only know Sky Mavis, the team behind the main game but then we have other major stakeholders who have a vested interest in that this ecosystem is working as it should. So I think Axie we're treading new grounds here. It's very easy to criticize. All these guys aren't doing it in a super decentralized way. I mean, I would advise to take a step back and see that we're also experimenting here and we have to be very upfront about these are the things that we can change and we try to do that as much as we can. But those who feel like this goes against their principles then yeah, probably Axie is not the place to be right now.
00:15:33.930 - 00:15:53.040, Speaker A: And you also talked about how the price for the characters I believe has just really gone up. So at this moment for people to kind of enter the game it's quite cost prohibitive. So how are they starting with the game?
00:15:53.410 - 00:17:12.840, Speaker C: As in basic economics it's all driven by supply and demand. And I guess in Axie we kind of control the invisible hand because we can increase or decrease the production cost of these axes so that we ensure that there is like a healthy inflation of newly axes being produced because we do believe that each axe is a special character and what the price should be for an axe is not like 100% set yet because we are seeing very heavy growth spikes because nobody has, I guess, ever seen a game like axe before. So suddenly you get a lot of people who are super excited. But one of the ways that we can combat this or to kind of make it a little bit more democratic is by letting other players borrow the axes that other players own. So right now this has been done purely player driven. They've started in game, I would say scholarships or guild systems where if you're a player you don't own any axes you can go to another player and borrow from them but it's difficult to set it up. So right now we're working on an internal tool to make it easier for players to let others borrow the axes that they own and I think I'm very excited to see that happen.
00:17:13.210 - 00:17:16.920, Speaker A: But what you're referring to is the Yield Guild was that.
00:17:19.710 - 00:17:53.282, Speaker C: Yield Guild is one of the companies that sprung out of Axie. Super interesting. I know Gabby very well, he's one of the mean. The thing is, this blockchain game ecosystem has been slowly brewing in the back. Not seeing much of the spotlight compared to DeFi. But it takes a long time to build a sustainable ecosystem within games. And I would say axie is probably a product cycle ahead of many others because we've been just doing it over the same thing over and over again for many, many years.
00:17:53.282 - 00:18:22.174, Speaker C: And in the end, I guess if you just keep doing things for long enough time, as long as it's not the worst thing ever, then probably people are going to start noticing it. So yield guild. Yeah, it's super exciting to see how much attraction they are finding too. I think they have over 1500 employees or scholars who are being hired by them and they're also producing a whole lot of yield, so to say, for their future token holders. I think they're planning to do.
00:18:22.372 - 00:18:27.520, Speaker A: And axio infinity is also especially popular in the Philippines. Why is that?
00:18:28.370 - 00:19:28.900, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's related to the go to market strategy that we had when we were experimenting a little bit. We quickly found that the Philippines is a great test market for games because there's a high level of English knowledge there and the cost of labor is quite cheap. So if you can then empower a couple of influencers in the right place, then they will quickly sort of spread the word about this opportunity. And we saw that happen in a small village outside Nueva, I see, I believe it's called it's even a documentary about Axie Infinity, how it started there, where people are quitting their normal jobs to play Axie, to farm there. I think that's incredibly powerful. And the interesting thing is in the Philippines right now, I think SLP and the Axie game has quite a meaningful impact on the GDP and the growth of that entire economy, which is crazy. And it's not something that I think we had initially imagined at least that it wouldn't happen as fast as it suddenly did.
00:19:28.900 - 00:19:41.382, Speaker C: But yeah, when people realize that something new and exciting is happening, that they can actually use their cryptos for something inside the game, I think that's really when things started to blow up. Yeah.
00:19:41.436 - 00:19:49.980, Speaker A: There's at least one multigenerational family that was playing it as a way to earn money during the pandemic. Can you talk a little bit about that story?
00:19:51.470 - 00:20:25.646, Speaker C: I'm not sure if I recall. Oh, yeah, there is an older, I guess a grandparent who learned it from their children and he was playing, I think, while he was at work. And that was also featured in the Play to Earn documentary. So incredibly strong story there. I think he wrote that he was praying that Axie Infinity would never go away. And sometimes you almost get emotional when you read some of these things because it's so crazy. But from a team perspective, we try to try to keep a little bit of a distance there and stay focused.
00:20:25.646 - 00:20:40.810, Speaker C: Because if not, then the responsibility just kind of piles on and on and on and on in the end. Because suddenly a lot of people are there might depend on this for their living, which is pretty wild.
00:20:41.230 - 00:21:16.900, Speaker A: Yeah, and I think if someone on your team noticed that there were like multiple players at the same IP address and they investigated that because they thought it looked fishy, and then somebody took a little video and it was like all these different members of the family that were all. So let's also now just touch on the side chain that you mentioned earlier, Ronan. What technology does it use? And now that you've implemented it, how has it affected play on?
00:21:18.230 - 00:21:58.098, Speaker C: So, you know, we came up Axie as Ethereum maximalists, I would say. I mean, we love ethereum. We think that probably Ethereum will be the foundation of Web Three, if it isn't already. So the story goes that we were on Ethereum and we were looking for various scaling solutions even early on in 2019. And that's when we deployed a large part of our infrastructure on the loom network, which at the time was being pitched as the end all be all of scaling solutions. It was using Plasma, everything was going to be great until it wasn't. So they pivoted into something else that wasn't game related at all.
00:21:58.098 - 00:22:43.194, Speaker C: And that didn't leave not only Axi but also So Rare had deployed a large part of their infrastructure there. And So Rare is another very successful, I would say adapt, maybe not as known in the crypto space, but I think the valuation for that company is only like 3.6 billion. They were also using loom network at the time. And when they pivoted, we realized that we need to take a step back and do more research into it. And then it turned out that not that many scaling solutions were really where we needed them to be. There was a lot of promises in terms of optimism, CK, Syncs, and even Starquare seems very promising, but none of them were production ready, and especially not for NFTs.
00:22:43.194 - 00:23:42.782, Speaker C: So then we just decided that okay, I mean, we've been building on Ethereum for so long, we know the EBM, we're just going to build our own sidechain to Ethereum, make it more centralized so that it fits our needs. Specifically like only for Axie related stuff, only NFTs. And the comparison that I would take is we believe that we're in the server eras of blockchain technology. And when I say that, I mean back in when the Internet was, scaling was the same thing that was happening. The most successful applications or website, they needed to have their own backbone in the basement to be able to handle all of the traction that they were getting. And that's pretty much the choice that we made. So we're building using the Ethereum virtual machine, building a side chain that has to be connected to Ethereum, and then we can take a step back in terms of decentralization for now, using POA at first, and then it's going to be POS once we release the Ronan Token to the chain.
00:23:42.782 - 00:24:27.694, Speaker C: And then we have a couple of Validators, some of our closest partners, and eventually we might open it up. But everything that we do with Ronan comes from it's by necessity. It's not something that we necessarily wanted to create. And I'm not sure if it's going to be the end all be all of Scaling solutions. Our approach is very simple. We want to make a holistic end package for the user, for the consumer, who wants to experience blockchain technology in an easy way. And if you can then combine, if you build using the EVM, you can take things that exist on Ethereum, like the DEXs that are there and all these other cool DeFi things and put onto your own side chain eventually.
00:24:27.694 - 00:24:39.730, Speaker C: And any kind of innovation that's also happening on the Ronin EVM will then also benefit the Ethereum main network. So that's our belief, and that's why we chose to build using the EVM.
00:24:40.410 - 00:24:43.640, Speaker A: And how does Axie Infinity make its money?
00:24:44.250 - 00:25:21.998, Speaker C: So Axie Infinity has currently two ways to earn revenue. A part of that is whenever an axe is being bred or becomes produced by the players, there is that smooth or small love potion part that I mentioned. But there is also a developer fee that we take. Right now, that developer fee is about $40 per axe that's being bred because it's paid in our AXS like native token. And then that gets put into our treasury. And on the other side, we have our own native marketplace where we take a 4.25% fee.
00:25:21.998 - 00:26:06.740, Speaker C: And the interesting part here is when we look at revenue streams, back in January, we had about 100K in total revenue across the board. And then in April, it was about 600K, in May, 3 million, and then June, 12 million. And now in July, it's been eight days, and we've already made something like 13 million. So this is going pretty crazy exponential. From a developer's perspective, it's, of course, cool, but, I mean, it's going into the treasury, so it's not like I'm putting all that money in my pocket. We have our belief, and the tokenomics have been developed by Delphi Digital or in collaboration with them very early. We were one of the first projects that they worked with.
00:26:07.670 - 00:26:08.338, Speaker B: Oh, wow.
00:26:08.424 - 00:26:15.966, Speaker A: Great. Yeah, Delphi Digital is a great organization. All right, well, what's next for Axio Infinity?
00:26:16.158 - 00:27:08.790, Speaker C: The current game? I think this is a little bit less known by some players, but the current game that we have, it was released into the market about 18 months ago, so early on in 2020. Over that time, we've been polishing and looking a little bit into that. And then we've been developing at the same time a new Battle version, which then will be parts free to play, newer game mechanics, better graphics. So I would say, like an upgraded version of the Battle game that we have just primed for even more mainstream adoption so that we can distribute the game on traditional app stores like Epic Games, Google Play, and the App Store. For now, there is no way to even get started with Axie unless you go directly to us. So I'm incredibly excited to finally open it up a little bit more. And the comparison, I'd like to say is right now, Axie is like an island without a bridge to it.
00:27:08.790 - 00:28:07.670, Speaker C: Everyone has to swim to get there. It's super hard, you need to download our wallet and all that stuff and then eventually we will get that bridge. So I think that's really where we are, where we are headed. Just making it easier for players to play the new battle game and then eventually releasing the decks that we have on the Ronin side chain and then land gameplay eventually. And so the culmination of all this is going to be an Axie virtual world. And I think that's the interesting part of how we are developing Axie is that when you see something like decentraland or the sandbox or even somnium space, the end goal for them is also to make their product into a virtual world, but they don't have the content piece. Our belief is that to make something into a virtual world, it's much easier to go from a place where you have users who actually love your product to actually play with it every day, because then you can bring the users from that one game into anything else that you create.
00:28:07.670 - 00:28:14.890, Speaker C: So users are power and that's basically what we understood when we're making a consumer facing product, as I think should be pretty natural.
00:28:15.870 - 00:28:26.714, Speaker A: Great, well, we'll have all that to look forward to. I'm really excited to see where all this goes and it's been such a pleasure talking to you. Thank you so much for coming on Unconfirmed.

Finance's regulatory struggles come after a June announcement from the UK Financial Conduct Authority, or FCA, which said Binance should not be allowed to operate within the UK, likely as a result of numerous actions adverse to Binance across several jurisdictions. On Thursday, CEO Changpang Zhao published a blog outlining the company's plan for regulation and development. As the crypto industry grows. Zhao called for clear regulations and expressed plans to grow Binance's international compliance team, expand compliance partnerships with companies like CipherTrace, which Disclosure is a former sponsor of My Shows and to localize business operations.

Next headline Ethereum's London Hard fork set for August 4 Ethereum's most anticipated London hard fork is expected to launch on August 4 at block number 12,965,000. London features five Ethereum improvement proposals that aim to make the blockchain more efficient while preparing the network for Ethereum 20, which will replace proof of work with proof of stake. Notably, London introduces EIP 1559, which introduces a new fee structure for transactions on unchained. As I recently discussed with Taylor Monahan and Tim Baco, EIP 1559 should make gas prices easier to determine and could potentially make Ether a deflationary asset, since part of every fee on Ethereum will be burned. EIP 3554 is also highly anticipated as it effectively freezes Ethereum's mining difficulty until the blockchain is ready to shift to proof of stake. Next headline The Bitcoin Mining Council claims half of bitcoin's electricity usage is sustainable.

The BMC claims to have collected information from 32% of the current bitcoin network. Survey participants say they currently use a 67% sustainable power mix, and the council estimates that this means the global industry's sustainable energy mix is at 56%. However, as the block's Larry Cermac debated the merits of the survey, asking on Twitter How can any conclusions be made from the survey if more than 50% of hash rate went offline and is relocating at the moment, which can easily take months? Speaking of hash rate, on Saturday, bitcoin's mining difficulty dove 28% at block 689471, marking the largest decrease in mining difficulty ever. The adjustment is the third straight decline in mining difficulty which has not occurred since 2018. With mining difficulty plunging, mining profitability should increase and already has in some cases, as metrics from bituda, a digital asset financial services platform, show revenue has potentially almost doubled.
00:36:01.210 - 00:36:37.434, Speaker B: Accordingly. June results from Marathon Digital, a Las Vegas based mining firm, show the miner produced 17% more bitcoin than in May, bringing in 256.6 bitcoins.
