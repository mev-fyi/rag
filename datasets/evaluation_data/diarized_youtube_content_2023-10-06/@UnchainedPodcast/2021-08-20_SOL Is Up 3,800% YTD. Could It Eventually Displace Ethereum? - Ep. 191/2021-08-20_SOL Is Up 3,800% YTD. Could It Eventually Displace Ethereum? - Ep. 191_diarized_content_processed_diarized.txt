00:01:35.254 - 00:01:37.386, Speaker B: Hey, Laura, good to be back on the show.
00:01:37.568 - 00:01:58.180, Speaker A: Nice to have you. So Salana has been on quite a terror this past week. It's now ranked 10th by market cap, and the price of the token is up to about $70 at the time of recording. And that's up from a dollar 50 at the start of the year, up from $23 a month ago and up from $43 a week ago. So what happened?
00:01:58.790 - 00:02:19.960, Speaker B: Yeah, I think this has been kind of a culmination of a lot of things happening. The salon ecosystem as he's starting around the beginning of the year, you really started to get together and take off. You had in addition to serum, Mango launched Saber, launched Mercurial, Marinade, a whole bunch of these other things.
00:02:20.890 - 00:02:27.498, Speaker A: So the only one I knew was Mango. The dex or serum, obviously. Why don't you just maybe describe what those are?
00:02:27.664 - 00:02:59.990, Speaker B: Yeah, so these are all various kinds of DeFi protocols that I mentioned. Saber is like a way to trade stablecoins. It's kind of like curve finance from Ethereum. Mercurial is a competitor. There's a whole bunch of borrow end protocols now, like Solend, and there's probably four or five more. What I think has happened in the last nine months or so has been that a lot of these teams started raising money starting about nine months ago and building and deploying. And then this past week, last week, two kind of, I think really important milestones happened.
00:02:59.990 - 00:03:37.970, Speaker B: And I didn't foresee them happening kind of next to each other, but Mango did their fundraise. So Mango is a margin trading and perpetual and derivatives trading thing built on top of serum. And Mango was one of the very first things to launch on top of Salana. And they've been iterating. And the product is actually very good and it's kind of like dYdX, but actually I think it is already more functional than dYdX in terms of what it can do. And they did a token sale and they sold off 5% of the total Mango tokens. The team kept 5%, and then the remaining 90% were kept for the Dow.
00:03:37.970 - 00:03:59.590, Speaker B: So, really interesting structure. The Mango team has been very publicly antivc. We've known them and spoken to them for a while, but we had no allocation. They did an auction and over $500 million went into the contract. And ultimately the auction cleared at 70 million. And so at 5% of the tokens, that's a $1.4 billion valuation.
00:03:59.590 - 00:04:33.682, Speaker B: And I think that really opened up a lot of people's eyes of, hey, you have a brand new contract, people are aping into this. This is what ethereum. I remember last summer, people were like, they threw a contract down and then $100 million would appear in the contract within a day or two. And that happened on Salana last week. And then this dgen apes NFT drop happened. I think it was Friday night or Saturday night, and it seems like 5100 thousand people tried to get onto this thing. The Salana blockchain actually kept running perfectly, but the front end to Mint the Apes kept going down.
00:04:33.682 - 00:05:03.660, Speaker B: They couldn't keep the servers online, but they ended up did launch the apes and everything ultimately worked out. And I think kind of those two things happening like three days apart, four days apart, has caused a lot of people to realize and say, okay, there's real DeFi happening here. The phantom wallet is amazing, and you can already start to see NFT drops happening. And the user experience as far as the blockchain goes is really just magical. And so I think that kind of combination of things is really kind of what's causing this new wave of interest.
00:05:04.670 - 00:05:24.660, Speaker A: Okay, I'm glad that you answered that question about the Deej and Ape Academy because I was trying to figure out if it was the blockchain or if it was the front end. I do think some people are still saying, oh, I spent a bunch of sol and I didn't get an ape. But who knows how they'll resolve that. Do you disagree with that?
00:05:25.030 - 00:05:41.466, Speaker B: I don't know specifics. I do know that the chain has been fined. Hawke all the validators and everyone, they didn't care, they didn't notice anything. There may have been some bugs in the contract for the ape specifically. I'm not familiar with any, but it's possible.
00:05:41.648 - 00:06:08.130, Speaker A: Okay. Multicoin obviously is invested in solana, and I think you guys also are supporters and investors in ETH. So what types of projects or users do you see being drawn to Solana over Ethereum? Or do you think there are specific types of categories that are especially suited to one blockchain or another? Or do you just think they're going to keep coexisting and competing directly?
00:06:08.870 - 00:06:37.210, Speaker B: I mean, they're going to coexist for the foreseeable future. There's a tremendous amount of inertia around Ethereum and I'm saying it will be displaced, but if it were to be displaced, that would take several years at least. So it's not going anywhere. I think right now on Solana, you're seeing a few different kinds of things happen. So one is you're seeing some things from Ethereum are being cloned. Over serum was kind of the first, so you need a way to trade tokens. Now serum is different than uniswap in kind of the structure, but obviously it's a way to trade tokens.
00:06:37.210 - 00:07:32.650, Speaker B: You have people now doing stablecoin AMMS, you have people doing regular AMMS, you have people doing options and derivatives and margin trading and borrow end protocols. All of these things exist on Ethereum DeFi today, right? And these are just basic primitives that kind of everyone knows need to exist. And so those are all being rebuilt right now. In fact, most of what I just mentioned is already live, so that's all good and well. But where I think Solana is really interesting is to try and unlock applications that weren't possible before and I think that that's going to start getting into things that are more complicated that you really can't do on Ethereum. So I think there's kind of a few areas of that that are somewhat obvious today. So the first is if you want to do a real DeFi derivatives trading protocol, you can't do it on Eclair One because of the risk of liquidations in cascades, you need to have kind of a high frequency, low latency system and you just can't do that on Ethereum.
00:07:32.650 - 00:08:18.220, Speaker B: Moreover, if you want to really make derivatives work, you need to make sure they all cross margin against each other. And so you need to kind of have everything in a single venue work. And so if you look at today Mango, Bonfida, there's Drift, there's a few of these DeFi derivative teams, high options, they're all making their systems composable so that potentially you could have a position with Bonfida and you could have a cross margin with perpetual protocol or with Drift or something. They're not there yet, but you can see how that's already coming together. And all those teams, although they're competing, are also recognizing they all need to play nicely. And so I think that's still a couple of months away from being really visible to the public. But if you look at how it's coming together, it's super, super cool to see that.
00:08:18.220 - 00:08:51.682, Speaker B: I think the other really interesting area is just going to be anything that really faces a large number of retail users. And I think probably the first category of that is going to be some combination of NFTs and social tokens. The ape thing happened. I think there was 10,000 apes. The salona blockchain was fine. Whenever the pudgy penguins launch a new thing or there's some new cats or whatever, gas on Ethereum goes to 200 really quick, or 300, and it's really unusable. But now just imagine, what if you multiply that by 50 and you wanted to do 500,000 NFT drop? You just can't even do that on Ethereum.
00:08:51.682 - 00:09:20.698, Speaker B: It's not even possible. I think those kinds of things are going to get unlocked on Salana. That'll be really interesting, and especially if you have influencers people with TikTok, 2 million followers on TikTok starting to do all kinds of stuff with social tokens and NFTs. I think that whole design space of creator monetization is going to get really unlocked on Salana. So I think we're really excited about that. I think probably the first just early glimpse of that is just now kind of coming online. It's called Audius.
00:09:20.698 - 00:09:40.886, Speaker B: They have about 5 million or so users. The audio streaming thing we invested in about a year and a half ago, and they talked publicly that they're going to do NFT drops in the audience app. I think we're going to kind of start to see the first versions of that where you're going to have well known celebrities and DJs doing interesting kind of NFT drop things. And I'm excited to see all this play out.
00:09:40.988 - 00:10:13.618, Speaker A: Well, there's so much to unpack in what you just said. But as for the three problems, the first one where you were talking about how certain things in DeFi just are not possible on ethereum because of collateral and liquidations. Are you talking there about what we did see kind of early in the pandemic that black Thursday, where there were a bunch of liquidations and the blockchain itself kind of couldn't even keep up with how quickly there were these liquidations happening? Is that what you're talking about?
00:10:13.784 - 00:10:48.138, Speaker B: Yes, that problem is even more acute, specifically with perpetual contracts, because people like people who are levering up on Compound and Ave and Maker are levering up two X, maybe three X. But if you're levered up 20 X on FTX or Finance, or if you're going to do that in a decentralized setting, all of that stuff becomes just much more sensitive when the leverage ratio goes from three X to 20 X. And so, yeah, it's just paramount that the blockchain is humming, that price updates are fast, and that liquidations are happening in an orderly they need to be happening in a quick way.
00:10:48.304 - 00:11:14.178, Speaker A: Okay, so in a moment I want to ask you about the cross margining thing you mentioned, but first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible.

Back to my conversation with Kyle Simone. So earlier when you mentioned the cross margining possibilities on Solana, are you saying that when Ethereum goes to Sharding that that won't be possible? And so that's why Solana superior in that.
00:12:23.530 - 00:13:10.214, Speaker B: Wrote I wrote a thread about this maybe three or four weeks ago, pretty widely retweeted about DeFi derivatives, but basically like Eflare One is a venue and then Arbitrum is a venue. Optimism is a venue, starquare is a venue, salana is a venue. In the same way that Binance and FTX are venues, that's where your assets are. My theory is that if you're going to make decentralized FTX get to that same level of functionality, you need to make sure these things all cross margin. The really big problem in Ethereum right now is that you have all of these protocols are being built on different technologies. So optimism is a different flavor of the EVM than Efublar One, which is different than Arbitrum, which is different than Starquare. And so these things literally, they don't even technically compose with each other.
00:13:10.214 - 00:14:04.380, Speaker B: And then they also, on a liquidity basis, don't compose because they're separate venues. And so you're seeing the system get make it further fragmented. And that means developers could try and rebuild all the pieces and functions of their competitors and complements, but it just makes everything harder and more complicated and more slow. What's really nice about Solana is it's a single venue, and you can support all of the users and all of the liquidity in one place. And so all of the teams building derivatives protocols also understand that they need to cross margin with other protocols to make their own protocols better. If you're building an option system, you want to be able to have a perpetual contract as collateral in the option. They're all designing their systems with that kind of core understanding in seeing you're going to see something that looks like a decentralized FTX emerge over the next probably three, four months as all those guys launch and Tweak bugs and stuff.
00:14:04.380 - 00:14:09.034, Speaker B: And that's really just not possible in Ethereum. Yeah.
00:14:09.072 - 00:14:30.274, Speaker A: I was also surprised for the third category, you said social tokens, because I don't feel that's truly taken off on Ethereum. So is that simply because of what you were saying about how there are just certain things that are just not possible on Ethereum, but you feel like if the capability were there, then we would see that phenomenon and so that's where Salana comes in.
00:14:30.392 - 00:14:54.470, Speaker B: Yeah, that's correct. I mean, Bit cloud here is instructive. They could have built on Ethereum and they chose not to. You have to ask yourself, why do they go through all this extra headache? And the answer is scalability. They were like, okay, if we're going to get Justin Bieber to talk about this thing and get 20 million people to slam the system, it just is not going to work. From that vantage point. I think Bitcloud was thinking correctly.
00:14:54.470 - 00:15:25.522, Speaker B: I think it was wrong to build their own chain that is UTXO based and has some other problems. We've invested in one team that's not yet announced that's building social tokens on Solana. And the great thing is stablecoins are already there are USDC, USDT are already there, and some other ones. And then Coinbase and FTX and Binance, all the major exchanges are on ramps. Those are all available now. You have all of the stablecoin swaps, all of the serum, all of AMM primitives. Like all this stuff is already there.
00:15:25.522 - 00:16:03.602, Speaker B: Right. And so it's just really easy to make it all play together in a very cool way. NFTs are all already there. And so I think that the opportunity set for developers to build on top of these kind of core tools and then for creators to experiment with different AMM curves, with different NFTs, with different social tokens and different risk sharing and whatever. Right. We're only a couple of months away from all of that, just kind of like magically working again, you can't do that and Ethereum because everyone knows if you have a million people slam the system, it's just not going to work. Ethereum tends to get clogged when ten or 20 or 30,000 people slam it at the same time.
00:16:03.602 - 00:16:07.330, Speaker B: Like if you have a million people slam it, it's just a different scale.
00:16:08.390 - 00:16:37.660, Speaker A: Wow, this is so interesting because I almost feel like what you're saying is if the last crypto bubble was driven by the ICO craze on Ethereum, then right now we're basically in a bull market, but it's kind of in somewhat of a holding pattern, I guess now. I mean, we're starting to see it tick back up now, but it's almost like you're saying it could be that Solana is the basis for it.
00:16:38.110 - 00:17:07.300, Speaker B: I think so. I think in about six months, like today, I can say all these things and I'm talking to all the developers and I can see the beta versions of what and it's all theoretical in the sense that retail can't play with it yet. But I think in six months time it'll be very, very obvious to kind of everyone in the space like hey, this is what we've been all waiting for. Cheap transactions. It's scalable, it's all composes. You don't have to worry about the layer two stuff. Everything just magically works.
00:17:07.300 - 00:17:27.562, Speaker B: You have DeFi, you have all the on ramps. Salon is probably three, four months away from just all of that stuff. Magically, magically working together. But you can see most of the pieces are there now. And if you have the fortune, a privilege that I do of being able to just talk to the developers working on the early stage stuff, you can see kind of where those last pieces are.
00:17:27.696 - 00:17:41.310, Speaker A: What about the fact that Ethereum Two is going to have its merge probably roughly, I don't know, six months from now, like in Q One. How do you see that affecting kind of any competition between Ethereum and Salana?
00:17:41.890 - 00:18:09.740, Speaker B: So Ethereum is supposed to move to proof of stake at some point. Timelines are challenging with Ethereum people. They tend to miss them by a pretty large margin. Even when it does move to proof of stake, it doesn't really change the throughput of the system in a meaningful way. There may be a 10% boost or 20% boost you're there, but it's not a ten x boost or 100 x or 1000 x. I don't think this meaningfully kind of changes anything that we just talked about.
00:18:10.670 - 00:18:26.830, Speaker A: So in general then, how do you see the competition between the two playing out? Because Ethereum at the moment has such a strong community. So how do you see that affecting kind of like the development of, I guess, both of the chains.
00:18:27.170 - 00:19:03.442, Speaker B: So I think communities are essential to make any open source thing succeed, but they're not all that you need. And actually beyond a certain point they kind of stop mattering. How many people are actually building core Ethereum Tooling like core Ethereum Client code, it's like 100. Like not even like 50 maybe, I don't know, but it's not 10,000. If you look at how many smart contracts on Ethereum today are really used, it's like ten or 20. Again, it's not 5000. The number of core things that really matter here is actually a lot smaller.
00:19:03.442 - 00:19:53.290, Speaker B: I realize there are a lot of people who are learning solidity and I agree there's obviously a lot of people that hold ETH. But if you look at the really important things, there's actually not that many of them. And I think more or less all of those are either replicated or will be pretty close to being replicated on Salon over the next few months. And once those pieces are in place, then what that does is it just opens up the world for people to go on and experiment from there. I think there's a ton of people who looked at Crypto 2017, 2018, and they looked at Ethereum and they said, we can't use this for what we want to do. I think the two most obvious examples are Bitcloud and Helium, which they tried and they couldn't make it work, and so they had to go do their own thing. And flow is another dapper And Flow, they literally launched CryptoKitties, which was the most popular thing in 2017.
00:19:53.290 - 00:20:26.690, Speaker B: I think if you replay 2017, you get this massive excitement. And if you assume that you have a scalable platform that can support hundreds of millions of users, I think that there would be a ton of companies that would be excited to build on top of that that have distribution. I think what's going to happen over the next six to twelve months is people are going to say, okay, great, we have a blockchain that we all know how it works now and we can actually see a path to support 50 million users on this thing. And those people are all going to start to tinker with and work on Salana. And I think that's just like incredibly exciting.
00:20:27.270 - 00:20:38.200, Speaker A: And then what about the fact that Salana is more centralized in terms of the number of validators? Do you feel like that will matter to people or do they not care?
00:20:39.150 - 00:21:43.290, Speaker B: Yeah, so decentralization is a spectrum, it's not binary and so it's gray. I think it's not a question at all that Ethereum is meaningfully, more decentralized as a whole than Solana is. I don't think that's really debatable, but the degree to which it is more decentralized is I don't think that much like it's probably like three or four or six x, but it's not 500 x. And so, yeah, I think the delta is actually not that large. If you look at probably the most important metric is who's controlling consensus today on Ethereum, it's like three or four mining pools get you to 51%. And then if you look at the ETH Two Staking distribution right now, I believe it's seven or eight entities get you to a third, which is the control threshold for a proof of stake system. Salana, actually, if you go to Salanabach IO, which is the main kind of like block Explorer for Salana, they report openly, how many nodes does it take to get to 33%? And I think it's like 18 last time I looked, or 17.
00:21:43.290 - 00:22:37.966, Speaker B: So on that metric, which is I would argue is kind of the most important one for the basic consensus safety of the protocols today, salana is more decentralized than ETH Two. Now, I realize that's not a perfect comparison, there's problems with that, but the people who say it's 100 x more decentralized broadly, I don't think that's a reasonable assertion. And so I think that's important to realize the relative magnitude. And then I think the other important thing to understand is, is the system as a whole becoming more decentralized or is it becoming more centralized. If you look at the history of Bitcoin and Ethereum, the answer is very obvious as they become much more decentralized over time. And so the question is, is there something fundamentally different about the nature of Salana that would cause it to break that trend? And I have not been able to identify anything and if I look at Salana twelve months ago versus today, it's obviously much more decentralized today because there's just so many more people building and doing stuff. Like the salana team doesn't know who the people are building a lot of the stuff.
00:22:37.966 - 00:22:58.834, Speaker B: And that's exactly what you would want to see. Right. Is there's just tooling out there and people start hacking away and they never even call the core team. And so I feel pretty good that vectors are generally getting more decentralized and as long as that kind of generally continues to function, then I'm not really worried about it. And I don't think most people in twelve months are going to care.
00:22:59.032 - 00:23:10.120, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, it's interesting because you said at one point like, oh, these two will coexist for a few years. So I am just curious, how do you think things will play out over the next few years in terms of competition between the two?
00:23:11.450 - 00:24:00.582, Speaker B: Yeah, there's some different examples in history where so one is like Facebook and MySpace. Another one that I think is probably a better comp is probably BlackBerry. And, and like I remember I was in college when there was kind of iPhone versus BlackBerry wars and BlackBerry. I believe if you go look at RIM's Financials, it peaked in either 2010 or 2011 and then that was the peak and it was still relevant for, I don't know, three more years. Probably like 2013 or 2014 is probably when BlackBerry started to kind of really become irrelevant if I were to ballpark these things. So inertia lasts at a minimum for several years. Even MySpace too, right? Like even as Facebook surpassed MySpace, MySpace was still around and relevant for, I don't know, probably two or three years.
00:24:00.582 - 00:24:27.098, Speaker B: Right. So projecting up further than three years is pretty difficult. It's too hard to reason about that state of the world. But what I just see happening right now is they both coexist. They have different growth rates. I think Salana's growth rate will be sustainably higher than Ethereum's for the foreseeable future, like meaning the next 24 to 36 months. And if that is in fact generally true, then the relative divergence of user base developers and market cap will converge over that period.
00:24:27.098 - 00:24:56.810, Speaker B: Ethereum is not going away. People are going to there's too much inertia there for it to go away quickly. I do think you're going to see two things coexist. We have iOS, we have Android, and today everyone knows you have to build an iPhone app and an Android app. Right. And we may be in a world where you have to do something similar here. I don't think that analogy necessarily will hold, but it's not unreasonable to expect that there will be multiple competing ecosystems.
00:24:58.190 - 00:25:17.790, Speaker A: And we're at time. But do you have time for one more question then? Yeah. And so if we do end up with two of these platforms that basically kind of do the same thing, how would you expect to see them differentiate? Like what projects would you expect to see gravitate more toward Ethereum versus Solana and vice versa?
00:25:17.950 - 00:25:56.526, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I have a very strong belief that software needs to be free or as close to free as humanly possible. Humans are trained over the last 15 years of the internet to expect everything to be instant free and fast. Right. And so I think that that kind of core demonstrated preference really favors salana. And so I think you're just going to see an increasing percentage of developers build there and they're going to say, okay, it's just much more obvious how you can incredibly say this will be cheap and fast for a lot more users and that's what I think developers are going to optimize for.
00:25:56.708 - 00:26:03.886, Speaker A: Oh, so then it sounds like you're saying that actually you don't think they'll coexist, that one of them will win out and it's more likely that will be salana.
00:26:04.078 - 00:26:29.870, Speaker B: I mean, again, time matters here. Like within twelve months ETH has too much inertia, but in 48 months, who knows? But yeah, Ethereum is not going away. It could definitely lose relevance. MySpace is still around, there's like some music stuff on it or something, I don't actually know. Dig is still around, like there's plenty of these things, but it could definitely lose relevance.
00:26:30.050 - 00:26:47.680, Speaker A: Okay, well, last question then, because I know I did see you tweet and I don't have the exact quote, but I remember seeing it that EOS was one of Multicoin's biggest mistakes and obviously that was a chain that was more centralized. So what do you feel is different this time around?
00:26:48.050 - 00:27:34.240, Speaker B: Yeah, so there's a few things. One is that US was much more centralized and that literally there was just 21 fixed lock producers. Two, the gas model in the system was really broken and so it caused all this kind of spam stuff to happen that was really problematic. And then three, that the team just didn't I mean, they raised a bunch of money and they just didn't swing hard enough. They should have been more aggressive with their balance sheet and that they just weren't. And so I think some combination of those factors kind of is what prevented it from getting there. I think it's pretty short sighted to say, oh, being as scalable and fast as possible and being a little bit less decentralized has no chance of working.
00:27:34.240 - 00:28:14.090, Speaker B: That just feels like kind of an implausible claim. It's not obvious that what degree of decentralization is the correct answer. You can't reason about that in abstract and give a. Definitive answer, right? And a lot of bitcoin and ethereum people kind of really have prone to this idea that it has to be maximally decentralized. And I just don't think that we don't actually know how to reason about that. And so I think it's okay to try other experiments that do make some trade offs but give you something very, very important, which is the user experience is just infinitely better. And I think that's a trade off that's really worth exploring.
00:28:14.990 - 00:28:42.942, Speaker A: All right, well, this has been super fascinating. I kind of was really shocked by all the salana activity and yeah, it's really interesting to get an insight. There's so much else we could have covered because obviously you guys have your new 100 million dollar fund and there's so much else. So I'm sure we'll cover a salana more in the coming months here on the show. But in the meantime, thank you so much for coming on Unconfirmed.
00:28:43.006 - 00:28:47.640, Speaker B: Hey, Laura, thanks so much for having me on the show. And yeah, I hope there's going to be a lot more solana news in the future.

Robinhood, along with Mark Cuban and Vitalik Buterin, are letting the doge out. According to Robinhood's Q two earnings report, crypto trading had a considerable impact on the company's bottom line, with 41% of total revenue coming as a direct result of crypto trading. The company also reported that 60% of Robinhood users traded crypto during Q Two to put Robinhood's growing reliance on crypto into perspective, in Q Four, 2020, crypto trading only accounted for 2% of the company's revenue. In Q One 2021, only 17% of the app's total revenue was derived from crypto trading. Interestingly, the company's filing noted that Dogecoin was the crypto of choice for customers, saying 62% of our cryptocurrency transaction based revenue was attributable to transactions in Dogecoin.
00:31:56.850 - 00:33:02.226, Speaker A: Speaking of Dogecoin, the memecoin was involved in two headlines that can only be described as well head scratching. First, Last Friday, Dallas Mavericks owner and shark tank shark Mark Cuban told CNBC quote the community for Doge is the strongest when it comes to using it as a medium of exchange. This week, he doubled down on his Doge Thoughts tweeting quote the point about Doge that people miss is that doge's imperfections and simplicity are its greatest strengths. You can only use it to do two things spend it or hoddle it. Both are easy to understand and it's cheap to buy, which makes it a community anyone can join and enjoy. Second, on Monday, it was announced that the Dogecoin Foundation has been reestablished after a six year hiatus to support Doge development. Among the Doge OGS, named as advisors to the foundation, you can find Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, sitting as the blockchain and crypto advisor, and Jared Birchall, a developer hand selected by Elon Musk to oversee legal and financial matters.
00:33:02.226 - 00:33:46.542, Speaker A: Next headline. Facebook Financial's Leader Says Novi is ready to launch on Wednesday, david Marcus, leader of Facebook financial and Novi published a blog post relaying his confidence in Facebook's stablecoin wallet project. Despite two years of regulatory hurdles, Marcus wrote, quote Novi is ready to come to market. It's regulated and we're confident in our operational ability to exceed the high standards of compliance that will be demanded of us, he added, quote in the US. We have secured licenses or approvals for Novi in nearly every state, and we will not launch anywhere. We have not yet received such clearances. The DM Association has become an independent entity for those in need of a refresher.
00:33:46.542 - 00:34:30.770, Speaker A: Novi initially launched back in 2019 under the name Calibra as a wallet designed to host Facebook's stablecoin project, Libra, which was started at roughly the same time. Since then, Libra, now known as DM, has famously struggled to get off the ground due to regulatory obstacles and key partners such as Visa and PayPal dropping out, while DM struck a deal with a US. Based silvergate bank about four months ago. The project has yet to mint any tokens, according to a report from the Block. Sources are attributing the holdup to regulatory headwinds. The same report notes that Novi is ready to move on from Diem and work with a new stablecoin. Novi has already held discussions with several third party stablecoin issuers, including Paxos and Circle.
00:34:30.770 - 00:35:27.800, Speaker A: Next Headline DeFi hack roundup, including the hack that never was just pulled off maybe the biggest white hat rescue ever. Paradigm researcher's Sam Sun tweeted cryptically earlier this week before dropping a post titled Two Rights might make a wrong outlining. A crazy sequence of events that went into Patching, a vulnerability in Sushi swap's fundraising platform Miso. According to sun, the vulnerability centered on a flawed auction process and could have resulted in a loss of 109,000 Ethereum worth $350,000,000. Essentially, a hacker could have reused the same ETH in a bid over and over again and quote, bid in the auction for free until the entire token sale, which in this case was Bitdao's. Bit was drained. Luckily, Sam and a group of colleagues were able to identify and patch the bug in the platform in less than 5 hours with the help of the Sushi team.
00:35:27.800 - 00:36:21.170, Speaker A: The Bitdao auction therefore went off without a hitch, raising over 112,000 ETH. In related news, the Japanese exchange liquid lost $74 million in a hack that saw its hot wallets exploited in a security breach. At publishing time, the exchange had suspended deposits and withdrawals and is moving all assets into cold storage. According to Onchain data, the attacker was able to get away with 106 Bitcoin and $69 million worth of ERC 20 tokens. The Polynetwork hacker who carried out this 600 million dollar attack on the Cross blockchain project two weeks ago is now refusing to return the remaining funds. The hacker appears frustrated that Polygon has not yet unfrozen $33 million in stablecoins. Quote Your essays are becoming very convincing while your actions are showing your distrust.
00:36:21.170 - 00:36:55.886, Speaker A: What a fun and game. You don't even think to unlock my USDT account, the hacker wrote to the Polygon team before adding that they are, quote, not ready to publish the key in this week which would return the funds. On Polygon's side, it seems they are trying their best to get the funds returned safely. The team has already offered a $500,000 bug bounty for discovering the exploit and is referring to the hacker as a white hat. The hacker will also be given the opportunity to join the team as an advisor. Next headline. Polygon and Hermes complete the first blockchain merger.
00:36:55.886 - 00:37:48.942, Speaker A: Polygon, an Ethereum Scaling project, has acquired Hermes Network, a ZK rollup layer two solution for $250,000,000. This, to the best of our knowledge, is the first ever full blown merger of blockchain networks where one network will completely absorb the other, including its token. As Polygon Cofounder Mahalo Bielik told the block hermes or HEZ will now become Polygon. Hermes with the 26 members of its staff moving over to the Polygon team as part of the merger, HEZ token holders can swap for Maddox at a ratio of 3.5 Maddox to one HEZ Polygon has allocated roughly 12.5% of its treasury to pay for the acquisition. The Polygon Hermes merger is the first part of Polygon's new focus on ZK technology, which helps scale Ethereum by bundling transactions outside of the Ethereum main net, making for cheaper transactions.
00:37:48.942 - 00:38:59.826, Speaker A: Bielick said quote we consider ZK cryptography the single most important strategic resource for blockchain scaling and infrastructure development, and we have a clear goal of becoming the leading force and contributor in this field in years to come. With the Hermes merger, Polygon has already allocated 25% of the $1 billion it pledged to spend specifically on ZK infrastructure. Next Headline SEC Chair Gary Gensler thinks DFI can be regulated in an interview with the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said that DeFi projects that reward users with tokens or incentives could be regulated no matter how decentralized they say they are. According to Gensler, DeFi quote is a bit of a misnomer, as many platforms are similar to the types of centralized entities the SEC oversees. There's still a core group of folks that are not only writing the software like the open source software, but they often have governance and fees, said Gensler. There's some incentive structure for these promoters and sponsors in the middle of this. Earlier this month, Gensler made similar comments, stating that, in his view, quote the legislative priority should center on crypto trading, lending and DeFi platforms.
00:38:59.826 - 00:40:00.006, Speaker A: However, not all regulators feel that crypto should be treated with such a heavy hand. In an open letter to Gensler, Representatives Patrick McHenry and Glenn Thompson professed their belief that increased crypto trading would be a quote concerning roadmap that will have long term implications on the country. The two added quote Rather than regulate innovation and job creation out of this country, we should promote an active dialogue between regulators and market participants. Additionally, Representatives Tom Emmer and Darren Soto are working toward creating better crypto legislation in the US. By reintroducing the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act on August 17. It aims to provide a safe harbor for blockchain firms that do not hold customer assets, which would be very helpful in light of the infrastructure bill's broad language concerning crypto brokers. In a statement on the announcement, Emmer said quote Certain blockchain developers and service providers, like miners and multi signature service providers, should not have to register as money transmitters because they never custody consumer funds.
00:40:00.006 - 00:40:55.434, Speaker A: And lastly, to round out the hard news of the week, a CFTC Commissioner Brian Quintens, who is known for being pro crypto and was a recent guest on the show, just announced that he will be leaving office at the end of August. Time for fun bits. Crypto adoption is up 880% compared to 2020 Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis published a preview of its 2021 Geography of Cryptocurrency report this week, which measures crypto adoption worldwide. According to chain analysis's data, crypto adoption grew by a whopping 880% over the past year. The report uses metrics such as onchain value received, onchain value transferred, and PeerToPeer exchange trade volume to rank the crypto adoption rate amongst 154 countries. At the head of the leaderboard by a significant margin was Vietnam, followed by India, Pakistan and Ukraine. Interestingly.
00:40:55.434 - 00:41:07.518, Speaker A: Both China and the US. Dipped compared to last year. In 2020, China ranked fourth in global crypto adoption and the US. Ranked 6th. This year. The US. Ranks 8th and China fell to 13th.
00:41:07.518 - 00:41:50.458, Speaker A: And actually, for the last fun bits, my assistant wants me to tell a little story, which is that my old hairdresser reached out to me and he had moved to the West Coast and we were DMing at 08:00 A.m. Eastern time, and I said, it's 05:00 A.m. For you. What are you doing? And he was like, oh, I'm waiting for this NFT drop. So in case you're wondering just how crazy all this NFT stuff is going, you can talk to my degen former hairdresser who is all into this and know one of those nifty JPEG PFPs and everything. All right, so thanks for tuning in. To learn more about Kyle Multicoin Capital and Solana, be sure to check out the links in the show notes.
