00:02:08.890 - 00:02:12.146, Speaker C: Today's guest is House Representative Tom Emmer.
00:02:12.258 - 00:02:14.242, Speaker B: Welcome, Representative Emmer.
00:02:14.386 - 00:02:15.826, Speaker A: Thanks for having me. Laura.
00:02:15.938 - 00:02:21.260, Speaker C: You've been quite active in creating crypto legislation. How did you get into crypto and blockchain technology?
00:02:21.790 - 00:03:12.294, Speaker A: Well, when I first got into Congress, I'm sure your readers and anybody watching this podcast is going to know just by looking at me that I'm much younger and into all these new technologies. But that's not accurate. I came into Congress in that generation that didn't grow up with computers, in that generation that didn't have email, a generation that seems like many lives ago in this country. And it's interesting. I had a great young man working for me who's into this industry and the whole idea of cryptocurrencies, and Landon gave me a book when I first got to Congress called The Age of Cryptocurrency. And Laura, what he learned is, when you give me something, I read it. I read this book.
00:03:12.294 - 00:03:54.518, Speaker A: I gave it back to Landon, and I said, this thing's amazing. And I asked him, are you Satoshi? Right? He denied that he was Satoshi, and maybe he said he couldn't admit or deny. I can't remember. But he told me, sadly then, that because I looked at this, this is the future, and the future has arrived. Government is only going to hurt itself if people like me don't get up to speed with what's happening in the financial technology space, with cryptocurrencies, with blockchain, et cetera. And by the way, when I first got involved in this, my peers seemed to think blockchain and cryptocurrency were one and the same thing. That's how far behind we were.
00:03:54.518 - 00:04:43.686, Speaker A: Right. But that book actually started me down this road and thinking about the fact that within the next five years, within the next ten years, within the next 20 years, what a great space where we can have peer to peer transactions that are verifiable in real time, right. And safe and secure, and we don't have to have a middleman negotiating these things. And then I realized the possibilities for blockchain technology go well beyond how cryptocurrency might utilize it. And it's just opened up a whole new world for me in terms of how we've got to get a government into a place where it allows for this innovation, it allows for this development as opposed to impedes it or obstructs it.
00:04:43.868 - 00:04:44.600, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:04:45.530 - 00:05:28.806, Speaker C: I find it amazing that that was your entry point because you have been so active, and we're going to get into this on the show. People will realize, like, you really have just put forth all different kinds of bills, and you have all different kinds of thoughts on many different aspects of crypto. The one that prompted me to reach out to you is something that I was fascinated by when we saw these corporations recently buying Bitcoin and putting it on their balance sheets. You recently wrote a letter to the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, advocating that it established what you called appropriate accounting standards for companies holding digital assets. What is the issue that you're trying to solve there, and how do you.
00:05:28.828 - 00:05:31.000, Speaker B: Think they should resolve it?
00:05:31.370 - 00:06:22.870, Speaker A: Well, the issue is the Financial Accounting Standard Board, known in the alphabet soup of Washington, DC. Simply as FASB. FASB has not issued any definitive guidance on how you should be accounting for digital assets and cryptocurrencies. And that, to me, is a problem. Many people or entities on their balance sheet will list holdings as intangibles, and that just isn't acceptable. It impacts the balance sheet because ultimately, they have to almost undervalue the asset that they're trying to account for. And in some cases, even though this isn't a problem, I would say as much as the government needs to get on the ball.
00:06:22.870 - 00:06:52.080, Speaker A: If you're undervaluing assets, then maybe the tax liability is different as well. So I think it's a very important what? It's very important that FASB actually clarify how we should be accounting for digital assets on the balance sheet so that not only does this trend continue, but once you do that you're going to properly value companies, you're going to be able to frankly encourage more people, more entities to get involved in.
00:06:53.250 - 00:07:22.890, Speaker C: This is thank you so much for that answer because it resolves something that I have been wondering and I did ask Michael saylor, but he didn't get into the details. I did ask if there was any situation in which the fact that Bitcoin does, as you put it, have to be undervalued when they do the accounting, if that ever can benefit the company. But it sounds like what you're saying from a tax perspective it could, but I guess that's to the government's disadvantage.
00:07:23.870 - 00:08:14.682, Speaker A: Can I just add to that? Yes, it can undervalue and at least in the present time, perhaps it gives them a tax benefit. But the risk is great in my mind, and you've seen some of the other legislation that we've been pushing for, or instance, safe harbor legislation from the IRS. This would be an example of what happens, Laura, if down the road suddenly there's a clarification and now you have a major tax exposure that you didn't know existed because you didn't get the guidance in the first place. So while it might be a benefit today, it could actually be a detriment in the future. And I think they really need to clean this up from an accounting perspective so that people that are engaged in this area, in this industry, don't get surprised. Yeah.
00:08:14.736 - 00:08:28.240, Speaker C: And so all this is happening at the same time that Michael Sue, the acting controller of the Currency, suggested creating an interagency Sprint team to look at crypto. What is your thought about that idea?
00:08:28.930 - 00:09:06.502, Speaker A: Actually, let's say I am encouraged by the fact that he is talking in that manner. I think our last administration, we've got some great champions. Mr. Giancarlo. Hester Pierce. Brian Brooks was a great ad for the last administration, but there was a lot of friction is the word I'd use. But it's more like tension within the last administration about which way to move and how to move in terms of the bureaucracy.
00:09:06.502 - 00:09:46.710, Speaker A: The executive branch working with cryptocurrencies, in particular in digital assets. The nice thing about Mr. Sue's testimony, because I had a chance to ask him some questions last week, is that it gives me encouragement that they're looking towards advancing this. But now we have to have this across all of these different regulators, right? They all have to have an understanding what they're dealing with, what their jurisdiction is, because they should be a value add. They should not be a wet blanket on this innovation.
00:09:47.870 - 00:10:10.606, Speaker C: Let's now talk about some of the other particular bills that you have introduced. There was a piece of legislation you introduced or reintroduced to protect taxpayers from penalties on some gains or losses they might experience from forked assets. So what problem are you trying to solve there and how does the bill propose to do that?
00:10:10.788 - 00:11:14.158, Speaker A: Well, there's a great example. If you look, I think it was dogecoin was forked from LuckyCoin and LuckyCoin was forged from Litecoin. The problem here is that if you or I hold, let's say we held Litecoin, right, and the asset forked. So now you have Litecoin, but you also have some lucky coin. As I understand it, you may not even know you have some lucky coin unless you're looking at your wallet every single minute to see what's changed. But guess what? You might be taxed on this lucky coin that you didn't ask for and you may not even know you have. Why? Because, well, once the assets split, now perhaps the government's going to tell you that because you hold both, you owe tax on both, and that this is kind of like an appreciation of the asset that you originally had of Litecoin.
00:11:14.158 - 00:11:34.060, Speaker A: I don't think that's right. In this case, if Laura holds both litecoin and she suddenly has a fork asset where now she's got lucky coin, you weren't asking for that. That's not an event that you caused to happen that happened to you. And I just don't think it should be another taxable event.
00:11:34.670 - 00:11:44.160, Speaker C: All right, so in a moment, we're going to discuss some of the other bills that you have introduced around crypto. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible.

00:12:48.630 - 00:13:05.730, Speaker C: Back to my conversation with Congressman Emmer. The House recently passed the Bipartisan eliminate Barriers to Innovation act of 2021. This could have a direct impact on the crypto industry. Can you tell us a little bit about this bill, what it proposes, and what problems it could solve?
00:13:05.890 - 00:14:02.326, Speaker A: Yeah, so it's very simple. It goes back to our previous discussion with Mr. Sue and his talking about this Sprint concept. This is a bill, as you note, that passed out of the House last month. And it would require the securities and Exchange Commission and the CFTC to establish a Digital Asset Working Group to ensure collaboration between regulators and the private sector that would foster innovation. So it kind of goes back to what we had touched on a little bit before the break, before your commercial break, which was these regulators, they should be a value add to the industry, to those that are innovating, to those that are creating, not a challenge or a detriment or an obstruction. The problem that we've had is we've got all these different regulators.
00:14:02.326 - 00:15:21.150, Speaker A: And I think this should go beyond the SEC and the CFTC. I think it should involve, for instance, the FDIC. I think it should involve all of these different potential regulators that touch onto cryptocurrencies, because what happens is they don't know their jurisdiction. Laura, quite frankly, you've got a situation right now where we do not have a clear definition for what constitutes a currency, what is a commodity, what is a security. And even though in my past life I practice law, I just don't think the idea should be to have the Howey test as a full employment opportunity for lawyers out there, where we're pouring all kinds of money into lawyers to try and figure out with this test what you fall into. Let's face it, in the beginning, an investment or an opportunity might actually look like it might start out looking like a security, but at some point it's going to turn into a commodity or an asset that is different from a security. We need to start to have these working groups come up with a new framework that is more clear, that's flexible, that allows for this new world that we live in where we not only can have an appropriate amount of regulation and supervision.
00:15:21.150 - 00:16:04.414, Speaker A: Light touch is what we always talk about because we don't need government smothering these opportunities. By the way, I want to make it clear, I don't think government ever will smother these opportunities. The problem we have in this country is if we don't do it right and we don't get it done soon, all these innovators will go somewhere else. They will find a different place to create this next great generation of opportunity. And I think it should happen right here in the United States. So, again, this bill that was passed would create this working group with the SEC and the CFTC. I think we should broaden it and I think we should get to a place where government establishes a policy, congress establishes a policy that starts to put some guardrails on there.
00:16:04.414 - 00:16:30.490, Speaker A: So you and all of your listeners and the people that watch your podcast can literally say, okay, here are the rules of the road. This is how I get my project started. And I'm not going to get surprised later by having five regulators crawling up my backside and suddenly have the IRS telling me that, oh, by the way, you should have been taxed like this. I think those are the biggest challenges right now that we need to address as Congress.
00:16:31.230 - 00:17:06.990, Speaker C: So something interesting that you said there was that sometimes tokens might initially be issued as securities but later turn into commodities. But actually also you did introduce a bipartisan bill last fall, the securities Clarity Act, and in that it advocates that digital tokens be clarified as commodities and not securities. And I think it was the press release or something. It even made the assertion that digital tokens issued in securities offerings, quote, are in fact and always were commodities. Can you tell us a little bit.
00:17:07.000 - 00:17:08.390, Speaker B: More what you meant by that?
00:17:08.540 - 00:18:04.294, Speaker A: Well, I will. I'll tell you first, I love this securities Clarity Act because it's a technology neutral bill. That clarifies. That an investment contract asset, like a digital token that you've just referenced is separate and distinct from a securities offering that it might have been part of an investment contract asset. Is any asset sold as the object of the investment contract? And there just is an unreasonable level of uncertainty with the way federal securities laws are applied to these transactions when we talk about the sale of blockchain based tokens and the lack of clarity is frankly hurting American innovation. From my perspective, the idea is that token developers need a clear framework for determining if their asset is a security or not. And it goes back to what we were just talking about.
00:18:04.294 - 00:19:23.806, Speaker A: Right. So who's going to regulate you? What regulations do you need to be cognizant of and follow? This bill would provide that clarity by amending the securities law to make it clear that a digital token is separate and distinct from any securities offering it might have been, part of, which has huge ramifications when it comes to someone who's working developing projects with these tokens. So, again, there's too much overlap. Laura and let's face it, the securities laws from the 1930s never contemplated digital assets like we're dealing with today. As a lawyer, I'm just not a big fan of the Howie test. I understand our courts are trying to make it work, but you're taking a test that was created for a completely different type of investment vehicle with a different language, and you're trying to superimpose that onto this 21st century world that we're now in. I think it makes more sense that we start to clarify because you're going to have these hybrids and it's all about control and expectation, right? If I control it, if I expect a profit off of it, there's so many different things that we need to look at.
00:19:23.806 - 00:19:58.860, Speaker A: And if we don't provide clarity in Congress, if we don't start to do that, I'm going to tell you it's already starting to happen. I talked to someone yesterday who is well known in this area who started, I think it's a $1.4 billion project that is based in the British Virgin Islands because they just couldn't get the answers that they needed here in this country. We can't afford to have that happen. We've got to have those projects, those great opportunities happen right here in the United States.
00:19:59.470 - 00:20:28.646, Speaker C: You're also interested in DeFi, and you said in an interview with the Bloc last fall that at that time it was too early to talk about policy for DeFi. But at the moment it looks like the FATF may soon be issuing guidance that would classify many DeFi protocol developers and other DeFi builders as VASPs or virtual asset service providers, which would subject them to all different kinds of regulation. What do you think of that and how do you think DeFi should be.
00:20:28.668 - 00:20:30.246, Speaker B: Regulated at this point?
00:20:30.428 - 00:21:11.586, Speaker A: Well, as you and your listeners probably can gather from my earlier comments, you are not going to be surprised to know that I do not like what Fat is proposing or what they're doing. I think it's the wrong approach. The proposed rule, from my perspective, is an attempt to challenge DeFi because DeFi happens peer to peer. It's not clear who the money transmitter is. And quite frankly, if I just boil this all down into a statement, I'm very concerned. This is our government's need because the government needs to see everything. The government needs to be part of everything.
00:21:11.586 - 00:21:55.518, Speaker A: This is an attempt, the Fata rule, which I believe the comment period for the industry ends later next month, towards the end of June. So if anybody out there wants to make comments on this, I encourage them to do that. You've got a little time left. I mean, this is truly, I believe, government's intent on identifying people in this environment and then tracking what they're doing. I think it's the wrong move, Laura. So we're going to keep pushing against it. By the way, Laura, by the way, we already have a bill, by the way, that pushes against it the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act.
00:21:55.518 - 00:22:35.920, Speaker A: And I probably should have mentioned, I mean, that act affirms that blockchain developers and service providers that never custody consumer funds don't have to register as money transmitters in 50 different states. So I think, by the way, we should also, I've got a bill that says that when you don't custody funds at all, we need to have a federal rule that it'll help the industry dramatically if they don't have to try and get licensed as a money transmitter in all these different jurisdictions. So anyway, I really appreciate your interest in this and love talking to you about it.
00:22:36.850 - 00:22:42.706, Speaker C: Yeah, well, just out of curiosity, out of all the different bills that you've introduced, which one do you think is.
00:22:42.728 - 00:22:47.326, Speaker B: Furthest along or has the greatest chance of being adopted?
00:22:47.518 - 00:23:57.638, Speaker A: Well, listen, the safe harbor for forked assets, the securities Clarity Act, all of these as far as the people that have leaned in and anybody wants to know the members of Congress who are truly interested in this area, take a look at our blockchain caucus. You've got Republicans and Democrats alike who are learning more and more every day about what we need to do. Obviously, our office has been heavily involved in this since I got to Congress. But the problem we're having right now on the House side is that the leadership of the Financial Services Committee, quite frankly, is way too suspicious of cryptocurrency and has not done the due diligence to understand what a great opportunity. This is to give people access to banking services, to financial services that they've never had access to before. To streamline the process so people again, the Unbanked can actually be banked. I mean, this has the potential of creating opportunity for all different Americans that the haves and the have nots to be able to participate in our financial system like they've never participated before.
00:23:57.638 - 00:25:05.818, Speaker A: And again, unfortunately, when you ask me how far along these are, we've got a lot of support within the committee. But I'm afraid that the leadership of the committee is just not prepared as it exists right now to move these innovations forward at the congressional level. But we're going to keep pushing ms. Waters, Brad Sherman, some of these other deniers I'll call them, we're going to keep pushing them to explain these cryptocurrencies and the technology that we're talking about actually empowers your constituents and gives them opportunities that they haven't had in the past. And I think once that gets through, we'll even bring these naysayers, the suspicious ones, over, the cynical ones. But certainly I would say by next Congress you're going to see this stuff start to move. I think the Financial Technology Task Force will become an actual subcommittee in the 118th Congress and all the work was done in the 115th, 116th, and now in the 117th this education has picked up even faster.
00:25:05.818 - 00:25:47.802, Speaker A: So I wouldn't get your hopes up too much about any of these becoming law in the next six months, but there's a chance that something could happen before the end of this Congress. And I'm very confident that when we get to the next Congress so probably about 17 months from now, you're going to start to see some of these bills move and become law. Because again, I think the common interest between it bridges the political divide is we want the innovation and the innovators here in this country creating opportunities not only for themselves, but for Americans and others around the world. It needs to happen here where it started. Great.
00:25:47.856 - 00:25:55.760, Speaker C: Well, thank you so much for coming on the show. It's been really enlightening talking with you and I hope to have you back on again in the future.
00:25:56.130 - 00:25:58.462, Speaker A: I'll look forward to it. I'll look forward to meeting in person.
00:25:58.516 - 00:26:04.880, Speaker C: Laura, don't forget, next up is a weekly news recap stick around for this Week in Crypto after this short break.

00:26:48.050 - 00:27:41.674, Speaker B: Hi everyone. Thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap. First headline Bitcoin mining Council stirs debate the narrative surrounding bitcoin mining has been decidedly shaped by Tesla and its wild card CEO Elon Musk, who on May 12 announced that the electric vehicle company was suspending purchases using bitcoin due to the, quote, rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels being used for mining bitcoin. On Monday, musk took to twitter once again, this time with some good news for the bitcoin community. Tweeting, quote, spoke with North American Bitcoin miners. They committed to publish current and planned renewable usage and ask miners worldwide to do so, potentially promising. On Tuesday, MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor offered further context to Musk's tweet, saying that he, Sailor had in fact hosted the meeting between musk and a few high profile North American miners.
00:27:41.674 - 00:28:44.050, Speaker B: In addition to Musk and Sailor, execs from eight different mining companies, including Riot, Galaxy Digital, Hut Eight and Marathon joined in on the conversation, forming what Sailor named the bitcoin mining Council. Sailor said the group was created with the goal, quote, to establish an organization to standardize energy reporting, pursue industry ESG goals, and educate and grow the marketplace within the bitcoin mining community. In a conversation at the consensus conference on Tuesday, Saylor also added that musk's first order ask was to bring transparency to bitcoin mining energy usage. Not everyone took the announcement in stride, which is not surprising given the open source foundation of bitcoin and the closed door nature of the Bitcoin mining Council's. First meeting, Marty Bent, who writes a bitcoin themed newsletter, responded with distaste over bringing ESG to bitcoin, stating, quote, the ESG movement doesn't care about the environment or humanity. It cares about control over capital allocation and how corporations act. He added Letting ESG dictate how bitcoin companies act will eventually lead to attempts to control how bitcoin acts.
00:28:44.050 - 00:29:48.354, Speaker B: In related news, oneRiver filed for a carbon neutral bitcoin ETF with the SEC, which would buy and dispose of carbon credits to offset the emissions associated with the bitcoin in the fund. Additionally, CoinShares made a strategic investment in veridi funds, which coinshare says will launch the first ESG crypto mining product in the US. Next Headline China cracks down on bitcoin mining Last Friday, a Chinese government website posted a statement summarizing a top level meeting of the financial stability and development committee of the State council that read, quote we should crack down on bitcoin mining and trading activities and prevent individual risks from being passed to the whole society. The State Council is the country's central government body. According to the blog. This is the first time bitcoin mining was specifically mentioned as a high level signal by the State Council. Mustafa Yilham, VP of Global Business Development at Bixon, tweeted that Chinese miners were accelerating their departure from China to other countries in response to the crackdown.
00:29:48.354 - 00:30:52.186, Speaker B: As a result, Yilham believes that there will be large quantities of mining equipment for sale. While he called the situation a crisis, he also speculates this could be a massive opportunity to redistribute the BTC mining network worldwide, rather than having it be focused in China. Perhaps in response to the State Council's words on Tuesday, China's Intermongolia region put forward eight new measures to phase out crypto mining in the area. The proposals target crypto mining facilities, individuals providing energy without prior approval, as well as internet cafes that are involved in crypto mining activities, amongst other things. Additionally, four days after the State Council's announcement, government officials in Sichuan sent a meeting summons to discuss how banning bitcoin mining might impact the hydroelectricity excess this year.
