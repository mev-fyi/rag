00:00:00.170 - 00:00:37.560, Speaker A: Hi, everyone. Just a note before we begin. After Tuesday's episode with Gabriel Shapiro and Fatima Fanizade went out, I received a message from a listener who works for the IRS. During the episode, we had wondered if the IRS would share information on whether you owned crypto to other government agencies, and it turns out the answer is no. This listener, who prefers to remain anonymous, said section Six one three of the Internal Revenue Code prevents disclosure of taxpayer information, even to other federal agencies, absent specific legislation to the contrary. Thank you for clarifying that. And now onto the show.
00:00:37.560 - 00:00:44.246, Speaker A: Hi, everyone. Welcome to Unchained, your no Hype resource.

00:01:49.796 - 00:01:50.506, Speaker D: Hi, Laura.
00:01:50.538 - 00:01:51.680, Speaker E: Thanks for having me.
00:01:52.310 - 00:01:58.350, Speaker B: Congratulations on executing the Shanghai and Capella upgrades on Ethereum Wednesday.
00:01:58.510 - 00:02:04.558, Speaker A: For listeners who may not be aware, can you explain what these upgrades enabled on Ethereum?
00:02:04.734 - 00:02:06.034, Speaker D: Yes, of course.
00:02:06.232 - 00:02:15.106, Speaker E: So at a high level, the biggest thing that came as part of these upgrades is the ability for validators to withdraw their stakes from the beacon chain.
00:02:15.218 - 00:02:18.326, Speaker D: Your listeners probably know this, but just.
00:02:18.348 - 00:03:14.042, Speaker E: In case they don't, ethereum launched on proof of work and wanted to move to proof of stake. But by the time we were sort of ready and had the proof of stake design, there was already a ton of applications and value built on the proof of work chain. So we decided to launch the proof of stake chain separately, make sure that it was working, that we could stake funds on it, that the whole kind of algorithms that run the chain worked without issues before we transitioned the entire network over to that. So because of this, when people wanted to be a validator on the proof of stake chain, they had to deposit their Ether in a contract on the Ethereum proof of work chain. And then the proof of stake chain reads from that contract that activates new validators and basically credits them the eat that they've deposited on the beacon chain. So people have been doing this since late 2020. We've had the Beacon chain up since then and those Validators sort of earn rewards in ETH for their work.
00:03:14.042 - 00:03:54.614, Speaker E: Late last year we had the merge. So this was basically when we got rid of proof of work and made the proof of stake chain kind of the main engine or kind of consensus algorithm for Ethereum. And at that point Validators were still kind of earning rewards. They started to earn the transaction fees that people pay when they transact on Ethereum, but they still didn't have a way to get their initial stake like the kind of 32 E that they deposited and any accrued rewards for their work as a Validator out back on the execution layer. And the main reason why we didn't do this as part of the merge is just that the merge is already like a pretty complex change. So we decided to separate combining both.
00:03:54.652 - 00:03:55.926, Speaker D: The proof of work and proof of.
00:03:55.948 - 00:04:08.438, Speaker E: Stake chains and then in the future kind of allowing Validators this ability to withdraw their stakes. And so this is what just happened effectively. So the CHAPELLA upgrade, which is Shanghai plus Capella together is like this upgrade.
00:04:08.454 - 00:04:11.194, Speaker D: Where we allow Validators to take the.
00:04:11.232 - 00:04:18.490, Speaker E: Stake that they have on the Vegan chain and either exit the whole thing, stop being your Validator, or simply get the rewards out and keep being your Validator.
00:04:18.650 - 00:04:29.054, Speaker B: And as far as I understand, this is the last step of that transition to proof of stake. So in a way, this also ends this years long process of that transition.
00:04:29.182 - 00:04:31.266, Speaker E: Yeah, that's right. And I think maybe a way to.
00:04:31.288 - 00:04:32.866, Speaker D: Think about it is like proof of.
00:04:32.888 - 00:04:50.522, Speaker E: Stake v one is now fully complete and there's probably a bunch of chains that will happen to Ethereum's consensus in the future. But the sort of initial vision of the entire chain is running on proof of stake. You can validate, you can enter and exit all of that. This is now live and working.
00:04:50.656 - 00:05:05.038, Speaker B: And from a technical perspective and a security perspective, what was the development team concerned about when it came to allowing people to unstake and withdraw? And when you explained that I don't know if this has something to do.
00:05:05.044 - 00:05:06.174, Speaker A: With it, but I wondered if that.
00:05:06.212 - 00:05:11.354, Speaker B: Was also why there's for instance, different types of withdrawals and like a delay and et cetera.
00:05:11.402 - 00:05:13.402, Speaker A: So can you talk about what considerations.
00:05:13.466 - 00:05:14.574, Speaker B: You had going into this?
00:05:14.612 - 00:05:16.254, Speaker D: Sure, yeah, of course.
00:05:16.292 - 00:05:22.274, Speaker E: So maybe if you take like from the very beginning when kind of the beacon chain was launched, it wasn't quite.
00:05:22.312 - 00:05:23.986, Speaker D: Clear how we would get all of.
00:05:24.008 - 00:06:05.506, Speaker E: Ethereum to proof of stake. Back in those days there was designs that were like maybe instead of combining both networks, sort of we grow a whole new chain under the proof of stake chain and somehow migrate the proof of work stuff over. So we wanted validators to have as much flexibility as possible with regards to where their funds will ultimately end up. So the initial validators, when they kind of activated their validator, they would use a key that has a different kind of cryptographic scheme than what we use on the Ethereum proof of work chain. So it's like a BLS signature. And so they would kind of have two keys. One that they use to find messages and whatnot, and another one that's effectively like their private key.
00:06:05.506 - 00:06:41.978, Speaker E: And I'm simplifying on the details here, but keep it simple. So these validators, basically they have like a withdrawal key that's set to this BLS key that's not something like the Ethereum proof of work chain can process or today's execution chain. Later on, as we sort of had a clearer vision of what the merge would look like and whatnot, it became clear that these funds would eventually kind of end back on the main Ethereum chain that exists today. So we added the ability for validators to create a validator and just set an ETH address as their withdrawal address so that when they could withdraw, the.
00:06:41.984 - 00:06:43.466, Speaker D: Funds would just end up there.
00:06:43.648 - 00:07:09.458, Speaker E: So we sort of have this set of validators who've activated with this different kind of set of keys. And we needed a way for them to transition to just specify the ETH address where we should set the funds. So that was kind of the other thing that activated at the same time as withdrawals is the ability for a validator who previously had this kind of BLS key as a withdrawal Credential to change this to an ETH address so that the network knows where to send the funds. So that was kind of one of.
00:07:09.464 - 00:07:11.378, Speaker D: The big concerns, were just obviously there's.
00:07:11.394 - 00:07:17.158, Speaker E: A lot of validators who had kind of these old keys and I needed to update them kind of all at the same time.
00:07:17.244 - 00:07:19.974, Speaker D: And that creates kind of a huge.
00:07:20.012 - 00:07:21.734, Speaker E: Number of messages, basically that are sent.
00:07:21.772 - 00:07:24.394, Speaker D: Over the network kind of in this one time.
00:07:24.432 - 00:07:30.070, Speaker E: Because once they've all changed, you can only change this thing once, right? You can't constantly change your ETH address to which you withdraw.
00:07:30.150 - 00:07:31.658, Speaker D: So it's like we would be in.
00:07:31.664 - 00:07:45.794, Speaker E: The situation where we had all these messages we needed to process very quickly because everybody sort of wants to withdraw as they've been staking for years. So that's definitely one of the areas we focused on. There's a bunch of other things, but yeah, that's probably one of the bigger ones.
00:07:45.912 - 00:08:01.830, Speaker B: And so to come up with this plan for how the unstaking and withdrawing would work, did you run different kinds of simulations, sort of like Monte Carlo style simulations to figure out how to enable people to withdraw while also maintaining the security of Ethereum?
00:08:02.170 - 00:08:37.426, Speaker E: I don't know exactly what types of simulations we ran. So there's a couple of different considerations. One is like the Credential changes and the thing that we do there is we just cap how many you can process per block. So I forget what the exact number is. I think it's like on the order of 16, give or take, maybe it's eight, but it's not like 100. So this is just like a way where every block we know we're not going to change more than this many credentials. And the clients can actually choose how they prioritize those because these messages, they're not like transactions where people pay gas fees for them.
00:08:37.426 - 00:09:34.386, Speaker E: Clients can use whatever heuristic either the first ones that they see or even there was this interesting project where people who thought their keys were compromised had a way to verify their identity off chain. And this project sort of curated a list that then validators could choose to run. So if you wanted to potentially help people who thought their keys were compromised, you could set your node to prioritize those if it were to propose a block. So there's all these different approaches you can take. I think from the network's perspective, it's just how many messages do you want to process by block to not delay the whole thing? And then in the worst case, assuming everybody changed their credentials, what would happen? Right? And these are scenarios we ran on a bunch of shadow forks before. Shadow forks are basically where we create a new network, like a new beacon chain, and we make pretend the fork happens on that beacon chain and kind of spam it with a bunch of transactions to see what happens.
00:09:34.488 - 00:09:37.106, Speaker D: So we knew that at least on.
00:09:37.128 - 00:09:47.286, Speaker E: The order of ten X, more credential changes that we'd expect on main net, the network could process, even though there would be a couple of missed blocks and whatnot it wouldn't be like in.
00:09:47.308 - 00:09:49.570, Speaker D: A critical state under that load.
00:09:49.730 - 00:10:08.766, Speaker E: So I think that's one of the aspects which we thought about. I think just like the flow of withdrawals, how they actually get debited from the beacon chain and credited on the execution layer is obviously something you want to make sure you get right. Like you don't want money to kind of get lost or the transaction has to be atomic, basically. So how that works, part of the.
00:10:08.788 - 00:10:10.686, Speaker D: Design there is just that there is.
00:10:10.708 - 00:10:22.098, Speaker E: No transaction for withdrawals. It's a bit like the proof of work mining where it just sort of appears in the block, but it doesn't take up block space like a user transaction. And this means like smart contracts and.
00:10:22.104 - 00:10:25.010, Speaker D: Whatnot can't interact with that as it's happening.
00:10:25.080 - 00:10:28.062, Speaker E: It just reduces the risk of some weird interaction.
00:10:28.206 - 00:10:29.458, Speaker A: All right, so in a moment we're.
00:10:29.474 - 00:10:36.840, Speaker B: Going to talk about what has transpired since the upgrade occurred. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make the show possible.

00:11:16.810 - 00:11:26.982, Speaker B: Back to my conversation with Tim. So as of the time of recording from the last 24 hours, which I guess now it's been like about 20.
00:11:27.036 - 00:11:30.186, Speaker A: Ish hours since the upgrade net, there.
00:11:30.208 - 00:11:34.710, Speaker B: Has been about 92,000 e that are in the process of being withdrawn.
00:11:34.790 - 00:11:37.370, Speaker A: And I wondered how this compared to your expectations?
00:11:38.350 - 00:11:39.530, Speaker E: This is funny.
00:11:40.510 - 00:11:41.966, Speaker D: I really didn't spend a lot of.
00:11:41.988 - 00:12:06.618, Speaker E: Time thinking about how many people withdraw or deposit. Obviously it's known there's a couple entities that have to sort of withdraw everything. But I think there's like two things where it feels like it balances out. One is just withdrawals significantly. I think derisk staking on ethereum for a few reasons. One is like, you know that they're.
00:12:06.654 - 00:12:09.926, Speaker D: Possible, even though, I don't know, the.
00:12:09.948 - 00:12:57.262, Speaker E: People working on the protocol sort of knew that this would probably happen around this time. I appreciate the skepticism of maybe others in the community who feel like, okay, I'm staking this thing and I have no idea when I'm going to be able to withdraw it. But I think having it actually be live and working is like a significant derisking factor. And I think the thing that it does as well is it reduces the commitments you have to make. Like before when you were staking on ethereum, you sort of had to commit all the way until withdrawals at least. But you can imagine today you stake and for whatever reason doesn't work out, you can withdraw and pretty quickly get your funds back. So I think given that even though there's possibly a bunch of people who will withdraw, either because they're forced to, they want to, they've been doing this for a while, or whatnot, I think the introductions of withdrawal sort of derisks the network.
00:12:57.262 - 00:13:05.062, Speaker E: And the thing as well is the network rewards are kind of based on how many validators are validating. So if there's more and more people.
00:13:05.116 - 00:13:07.734, Speaker D: That join as validators, the rewards actually.
00:13:07.772 - 00:13:17.898, Speaker E: Go down because at some point the marginal validator isn't that valuable to ethereum. But similarly, if a bunch of people leave, then the rewards will go up and that'll probably attract new people who.
00:13:17.904 - 00:13:22.826, Speaker D: Want to stake and we'll sort of reach that equilibrium. So it's really hard to predict what.
00:13:22.848 - 00:13:27.134, Speaker E: Happens in the short term. I think the next probably couple of weeks are pretty much noise in terms.
00:13:27.172 - 00:13:29.022, Speaker D: Of a bunch of people who wanted.
00:13:29.076 - 00:13:33.498, Speaker E: To unstake will probably unstake. A bunch of people who wanted to stake will stake. But I think after that we'll probably.
00:13:33.524 - 00:13:35.634, Speaker D: Have a better picture of just what.
00:13:35.672 - 00:13:40.222, Speaker E: Does the average growth looks like in terms of stake.
00:13:40.366 - 00:13:54.434, Speaker B: Yeah, Nansen had a great dashboard and it's very clear that both withdrawals and deposits are up. So, yeah, clearly there's a lot of movement in both directions at the moment. So now that CHAPELLA has been executed.
00:13:54.482 - 00:13:56.722, Speaker A: How do you think that this ability.
00:13:56.786 - 00:14:00.342, Speaker B: To withdraw will affect how decentralized ethereum will?
00:14:00.476 - 00:14:02.262, Speaker D: Yeah, that's a great question.
00:14:02.316 - 00:14:38.054, Speaker E: So I think this is also part of the withdrawals we'll see right now is kind of a reshuffling right, where people who are staking with one provider might choose to move to another one for various reasons. So I think especially if you were staking on, say, like a centralized exchange, you sort of were locked in there for the most part as a user over the past few years and a lot of these centralized exchanges start offering staking before we even have these liquid staking on chain projects. So I wouldn't be surprised to see a bunch of people move from say, centralized exchanges to liquid staking projects just because it's more convenient as a user experience.
00:14:38.252 - 00:14:42.102, Speaker D: And I think it's also now much.
00:14:42.156 - 00:14:45.350, Speaker E: Easier as a solo staker to actually.
00:14:45.420 - 00:14:48.326, Speaker D: Try it out and see, okay, can.
00:14:48.348 - 00:14:55.206, Speaker E: I actually run a validator? And if it doesn't work out, I can get my money back in a couple of days. So I think one of my hopes.
00:14:55.238 - 00:14:59.302, Speaker D: Is that by having a bounded commitment.
00:14:59.366 - 00:15:12.158, Speaker E: That people make relative to an unbounded one, we do see people kind of trying it out. And also you'll accrue the actual rewards on your validator which before were sort of on the beacon chain, but you.
00:15:12.164 - 00:15:14.078, Speaker D: Couldn'T quite do anything with them.
00:15:14.244 - 00:15:16.338, Speaker E: So hopefully we'll see more people trying that.
00:15:16.424 - 00:15:18.546, Speaker D: I think also since the merge, the.
00:15:18.568 - 00:15:22.194, Speaker E: Merge sort of changed kind of quite significantly the software you had to run.
00:15:22.232 - 00:15:25.346, Speaker D: And the interaction between the nodes, even.
00:15:25.368 - 00:15:34.694, Speaker E: Though in practice people were supposed to run both an execution and consensus client. Since as a validator prior to the merge you didn't really have to run an execution client, you could sort of.
00:15:34.732 - 00:15:38.198, Speaker D: Use inferra instead and be fine. So I think the merge was like.
00:15:38.204 - 00:15:53.726, Speaker E: A spot where we asked a lot of validators and node operators, but now I feel like people have better understood that setup, there's much better guides, there's a ton of support for it. So yeah, hopefully we see more solo stakers come out of this. I guess the last thing I'll say.
00:15:53.748 - 00:15:55.486, Speaker D: Is the Ethereum network sort of has.
00:15:55.508 - 00:16:12.820, Speaker E: This concept of coordinated penalties if something wrong happens. So if like all your validators are on AWS and AWS goes down, the penalty is much greater than if I run a validator on my internet apartment and I'm the only one in the network going down.
00:16:13.270 - 00:16:18.814, Speaker D: So when you're using one of these larger providers, the risk that you're taking.
00:16:18.872 - 00:16:36.106, Speaker E: Is that if there is a failure, you'll be penalized much more harshly than if you have a failure that's uncoordinated from everyone else. So even as like a solo staker who has, say, an imperfect performance relative to a professional operator, you might have small penalties more often.
00:16:36.208 - 00:16:37.786, Speaker D: But in the case, sort of like.
00:16:37.808 - 00:16:39.702, Speaker E: The tail case where a large operator.
00:16:39.766 - 00:16:41.726, Speaker D: Actually has an issue you would be.
00:16:41.748 - 00:16:46.202, Speaker E: Penalized much less harshly for those types of issue than they would given the correlations.
00:16:46.346 - 00:16:46.750, Speaker D: Anyway.
00:16:46.820 - 00:17:01.022, Speaker E: I'll hopefully see kind of a reshuffling towards more decentralized know, when people try a product that they don't like then they'll be able to change more easily whether this is a centralized exchange, a pool or solo staking.
00:17:01.166 - 00:17:02.994, Speaker D: Yeah, I think that's quite good.
00:17:03.112 - 00:17:10.694, Speaker B: Now that Shanghai and this whole transition to proof of stake are completed what are Ethereum developers focused on next?
00:17:10.892 - 00:17:31.542, Speaker E: So the most obvious big thing is EIP four four four. So this proto bank sharding the idea there is that Ethereum's kind of path towards scaling is via roll up these layer two networks. Most of the cost of the transactions is actually posting data back on Ethereum layer one. So the thing that keeps them secure.
00:17:31.606 - 00:17:34.366, Speaker D: Is that effectively they process all your.
00:17:34.388 - 00:18:19.286, Speaker E: Transactions off chain but they post back the data on Ethereum layer one or proofs of the data for ZK roll ups. And if there was something that went wrong on the L two you could kind of reconstruct the transaction sequence on L One and dispute the actual thing that went wrong. So for them it's very important to be able to post the data back on a secure network. And that's why they often do it on Ethereum. But it's expensive to do that. And I think if you look now something like 90% to 99% of the cost of an l Two transaction is actually the cost of posting data on Ethereum L One. And so the idea with EIP 4844 is that we want to offer can think of it as like temporary data storage on Ethereum where these layer twos, they don't actually need the data stored forever.
00:18:19.286 - 00:18:31.806, Speaker E: But right now on Ethereum, that's like the only way to post data. But optimistic roll ups usually after seven days will kind of consider a transaction final and that you withdraw your funds. Different roll ups have different numbers for.
00:18:31.828 - 00:18:33.886, Speaker D: This so they only care about the.
00:18:33.908 - 00:18:38.226, Speaker E: Data being there for on the order of a week. So the idea with four four four.
00:18:38.248 - 00:18:40.306, Speaker D: Is we can add more kind of.
00:18:40.328 - 00:18:44.494, Speaker E: Data storage capacity to the network because we're not storing it forever.
00:18:44.622 - 00:18:48.494, Speaker D: Whereas usually because we store data forever.
00:18:48.542 - 00:18:54.502, Speaker E: We can't store a ton of it and so we end up having to charge a lot for it in terms of gas fees. So four four four will basically allow.
00:18:54.556 - 00:18:56.626, Speaker D: Just like way more data that's stored.
00:18:56.658 - 00:19:05.066, Speaker E: Temporarily and LQs can use this instead of the main Ethereum data and lower fees on users. So that's really where I'd say most.
00:19:05.088 - 00:19:06.650, Speaker D: Of the focus is right now.
00:19:06.800 - 00:19:16.506, Speaker B: And so what you described here, so often I hear people talking about implementing EIP 48 44, but also proto dank sharding.
00:19:16.618 - 00:19:16.894, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:19:16.932 - 00:19:18.286, Speaker B: Can you explain what that is?
00:19:18.308 - 00:19:22.080, Speaker E: It's the same thing. Yeah, it's just a funny name for EIP 44.
00:19:23.090 - 00:19:26.026, Speaker A: Okay, and when do you expect that to be implemented?
00:19:26.138 - 00:19:27.514, Speaker D: We've been working on this for like.
00:19:27.572 - 00:19:45.174, Speaker E: Over a year now. I think the EIP was drafted in February of last year, so we have had several testnets and devnets running with it. I'm pretty sure today all the clients have at least a prototype implementation. So I'd say it's quite far along.
00:19:45.292 - 00:19:48.406, Speaker D: The biggest thing that's missing is we.
00:19:48.428 - 00:20:20.914, Speaker E: Were implementing this sort of as prototypes in parallel to the ChappellA upgrade. So now there's a lot of work to do to just kind of, I guess, rebase all of this work on top of the new production software that's running on mainnet today. And people were obviously reluctant to do this. You don't want to have two in progress upgrades that are being iterated on on the same code base. So they sort of implemented four four on like an old version of the client and slowly moved it back on top of the current versions. So in the next couple of weeks, I think this is what teams will be focusing on.
00:20:21.032 - 00:20:23.918, Speaker D: And then I think after that, it's.
00:20:23.934 - 00:20:38.886, Speaker E: Hard to predict how long these things take, but we'll start sending up devnets, getting all the clients together, seeing what bugs we find and fixing those in parallel. We also have to discuss are there other things we want to bring along with this upgrade? I doubt there'd be any other kind.
00:20:38.908 - 00:20:41.562, Speaker D: Of big change because this is already.
00:20:41.696 - 00:20:54.766, Speaker E: Quite a large one. But just like with this upgrade for withdrawals, there's probably a handful of small other changes that make sense to combine with it. So in the next month or two, I think that's what we'll be figuring out. And after that, it'll be easier to.
00:20:54.788 - 00:20:59.166, Speaker D: Have an idea of when this thing could go live when we have full.
00:20:59.188 - 00:21:04.474, Speaker E: Implementations working on the Layla software, plus we know other features that will come alongside it.
00:21:04.612 - 00:21:10.430, Speaker B: And so Ethereum's Roadmap has other elements on it after scaling.
00:21:10.510 - 00:21:12.818, Speaker A: So from there, what else do you.
00:21:12.824 - 00:21:15.874, Speaker B: See as kind of the next steps and what are you looking forward to?
00:21:15.992 - 00:21:18.518, Speaker D: Yeah, we have a lot of stuff to do.
00:21:18.684 - 00:21:26.982, Speaker E: So on the proof of stake side, I think PBS is probably one of the things that has the most attention on right now.
00:21:27.116 - 00:21:29.058, Speaker A: Proposer builder separation.
00:21:29.234 - 00:21:29.670, Speaker D: Correct.
00:21:29.740 - 00:22:15.346, Speaker E: So right now, basically the mev market, you can think of it as like the validator is the actor who has to propose a block, but it can either propose a local block using its public mem pool, but there's people who can build more profitable blocks. We call those builders. And so you basically want to have sort of an auction where builders can bid to validators saying hey, if you make this block for me, I will pay you this amount of money. And then the validator can check how much they would make with their own block. How much can different builders bid for their block and kind of choose, oh, I'd like to take this block instead. Doing this basically requires can think of as a marketplace. Today this marketplace exists outside of the protocol rules.
00:22:15.346 - 00:22:58.066, Speaker E: This is what mevboost is. It's like the software that connects builders and proposers. And again, I'm skipping over a ton of technical details, but high level, this is how it works. And because this auction mechanism is not part of the protocol, there's just a bunch of weird trust assumptions that we have to tolerate that make it a bit less robust than Ethereum's core protocol. So the idea with Proposer builder separation actually people now call it like enshrined Proposer Builder separation because it's just bringing this marketplace, which already exists to be governed by protocol rules rather than mediated by external software. So that's a big one on the proof of stake side. Another thing that I think a lot of researchers like to see is just they call this like single slot finality.
00:22:58.066 - 00:23:07.654, Speaker E: But the idea is that right now Ethereum finalizes which means it's very low probability of reorbs every like twelve minutes or so. And it's kind of a binary thing.
00:23:07.692 - 00:23:10.342, Speaker D: It's like after twelve minutes you get.
00:23:10.396 - 00:23:15.174, Speaker E: A third of the stake backing your transaction. But the idea with single slot finality.
00:23:15.222 - 00:23:18.666, Speaker D: Is most transactions don't need billions or.
00:23:18.688 - 00:23:24.190, Speaker E: Dozens of billions of economic security behind them. If you're sending $100 on Ethereum, maybe.
00:23:24.260 - 00:23:26.206, Speaker D: Like tens or hundreds of millions of.
00:23:26.228 - 00:23:41.726, Speaker E: Security is sufficient for you. So could we make instead of making this like a binary thing where every twelve minutes you get all the economic security, could we just make this like a gradual thing where you go from zero to a third of the stake gradually every slot? So there's a lot of work that's.
00:23:41.758 - 00:23:42.898, Speaker D: Being done on that.
00:23:43.064 - 00:23:46.294, Speaker E: And I think on the execution layer there's a ton of things that's happening.
00:23:46.332 - 00:23:49.446, Speaker D: But I think two noteworthy ones.
00:23:49.628 - 00:24:06.140, Speaker E: One is moving to what we call stakeless Ethereum. So one of the big challenges with every blockchain is the more contracts there are on it, the more storage that takes. So ideally in the future, not all nodes store all of the contracts. And to do that.
00:24:07.870 - 00:24:08.554, Speaker D: When you send.
00:24:08.592 - 00:24:39.618, Speaker E: A transaction you need to send like a little part of the state. So imagine you own NFT, you need to send a transaction that says I want to, I don't know, transfer my NFT, but also include a proof that in this contract I own this NFT or whatever. This is a bit weird, but the way Ethereum data is stored right now looks a bit like a Christmas tree. So it's like this tree that's like long and narrow. And sending your proof is like, imagine you go from the top all the way to the bottom. So it's like this long kind of thing. Obviously, you can't cut a Christmas tree.
00:24:39.634 - 00:24:41.640, Speaker D: That way, but bear with me.
00:24:42.170 - 00:25:15.902, Speaker E: And so just sending those would be expensive. And we want to move Ethereum to a different type of tree, which looks a bit more like a bush, which is like long and short, so the proofs would be much smaller to send over. And there's a bunch of technical work to get there. And probably the most noteworthy piece is changing self destruct. So if any of your listeners are like smart contract devs who rely on self destruct as part of CHAPELLA That Went Live, we've deprecated this so you can still use it on the network. Like the functionality hasn't changed, but likely in the next upgrade it will.
00:25:16.036 - 00:25:19.186, Speaker D: So obviously, you know, the goal is.
00:25:19.208 - 00:25:35.522, Speaker E: To not break any existing contracts, but if today you deployed some weird funky contract that uses self destruct in a very novel way that nobody's ever done, this is a type of use case that might get bricked in a future upgrade.
00:25:35.586 - 00:25:36.518, Speaker D: And I won't go into all the.
00:25:36.524 - 00:25:38.534, Speaker E: Details why we need to remove self.
00:25:38.572 - 00:25:40.710, Speaker D: Destruct, but basically to get this future.
00:25:40.780 - 00:25:42.358, Speaker E: Where we don't have to store all.
00:25:42.364 - 00:25:43.946, Speaker D: The states on all the nodes, this.
00:25:43.968 - 00:25:46.826, Speaker E: Is kind of one of the requirements. And so, yeah, this is something people.
00:25:46.848 - 00:25:48.666, Speaker D: Should be aware of that consider self.
00:25:48.688 - 00:25:52.394, Speaker E: Destruct to be deprecated on Mainet just.
00:25:52.432 - 00:25:58.430, Speaker B: To fill in self destruct is what it's not the same thing. Is that killing a contract?
00:25:58.930 - 00:26:26.978, Speaker E: Yeah, so you can think of it, it deletes the contract and it sends any money that's in the contract to the address that called it. And obviously you need like a privileged action. Not anybody can call that on any contract. But for example, there's a bunch of contracts that allow the owner of the contract to destroy the contract and potentially replace it with a new version or something like that. So the flow is like the self destruct will just delete the contract, delete all the data and send whatever balances was left in the contract back to the owner.
00:26:27.074 - 00:26:31.358, Speaker B: And is that also the same thing as suiciding a contract or is that like old term?
00:26:31.394 - 00:26:37.354, Speaker E: Yeah, so they actually changed the name because it was a bit intense of the name. So it's the same off code.
00:26:37.392 - 00:26:38.650, Speaker D: Yes. Got it.
00:26:38.720 - 00:26:39.434, Speaker A: Okay.
00:26:39.632 - 00:26:49.898, Speaker B: All right, Tim, well, congrats again and it's really exciting to also see what else is coming up for Ethereum. Good luck with all that and thank you so much for coming on Unchained.
00:26:49.994 - 00:26:50.974, Speaker D: Thank you very much.

00:27:39.444 - 00:27:42.058, Speaker B: According to FTX's bankruptcy attorneys from Sullivan.
00:27:42.074 - 00:28:23.550, Speaker A: And Cromwell, FTX's FTT token more than doubled in price. After the news broke, lead attorney Andy Dieterick informed the court that restarting the exchange is one of many potential options being considered, with no decisions being final yet. Dieterick revealed that the $7.3 billion in recovered assets include $2 billion in cash and $4.3 billion in Category A crypto such as bitcoin and ethereum. A potential restart to be assessed this quarter may require raising additional capital and could involve a 363 sale selling the firm's assets to pay creditors. Talks regarding the restart are underway with FTX's official committee of unsecured creditors.
00:28:23.550 - 00:29:19.806, Speaker A: Former FTX head of institutional sales Zayn Tackett suggested that the exchange relaunch and offer a token representing creditor claims, providing value to creditors and immediate liquidity for those who wish to sell off their claims. Tackett cited Bitfinex's BFX token as a successful example. He believes FTX could succeed if run, quote, like a crypto company that is, quote, able to be nimble. FTX faces massive legal fees amidst bankruptcy FTX faced more than $30 million in legal bills and consultant fees in February, with over 35 400 hours of work logged by six firms, according to compensation reports filed in bankruptcy court. Sullivan and Cromwell charged the largest amount, billing $13.5 million for their services, while Alvarez and Marcel billed $12 million. FTX's February tab was slightly smaller than January's $38 million bill.
00:29:19.806 - 00:30:09.470, Speaker A: Meanwhile, a bankruptcy court judge denied former FTX CEO Sam Binkman Fried's motion to access a $10 million insurance policy to cover his legal expenses. Judge John Dorsey stated that Binkman Fried did not provide evidence or establish cause for the request. However, the judge noted that SPF can return with evidence at a later time. Companies typically have director and officer liability insurance to protect executives from legal action. The official Committee of Unsecured Creditors had objected to the motion, stating Any cash you might receive could instead go to FTX creditors. And here's the rest of your FTX roundup. A Delaware bankruptcy court judge ordered that Alameda Research, the trading arm of FTX, should be repaid nearly $53 million for a loan made in 2021 to Deltech International Group.
00:30:09.470 - 00:30:51.946, Speaker A: In addition, Alameda researchbacked Ren Protocol will transfer all of its pegged assets, including bitcoin and dogecoin, to FTX trading. Lastly, FTX was given the green light by a Swiss court to explore the potential sale of its European business arm, FTX Europe AG. After the holding company filed for a Swiss moratorium proceeding. Winklevoss Twins loan $100 million to Gemini amidst struggles. Billionaire founders of Gemini, Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss have reportedly loaned $100 million to their crypto exchange. The personal loan comes after unsuccessful attempts to secure external funding. Since last year, Gemini has faced multiple challenges during the crypto downturn.
00:30:51.946 - 00:31:57.730, Speaker A: FTX's collapse sparked the bankruptcy of crypto lender Genesis Global Holdco, which significantly impacted Genesis. In February, Gemini and Genesis agreed in principle to resolve their dispute, with Gemini, contributing up to $100 million. However, the Winklevoss loan will be used to fund operations, not the Genesis dispute resolution. SEC Summons Tron's Justin Sun, Soulja Boy and Austin Mahone the securities and Exchange Commission issued a summons for Tron founder Justin Sun, DeAndre Cortez Way, aka rapper Soldier Boy and YouTuber Austin Mahone following a civil complaint from last month, which involves tokens issued by Tron and BitTorrent that the SEC has deemed as unregistered securities offerings. If Sun, Mahone and Social Boy do not respond within 21 days, a default judgment will be entered against them. The SEC is seeking to bar sun and his companies from offering securities, including digital assets, again and to impose civil penalties. Wei and Mahone may face bans on receiving money for his future digital asset endorsements and pay their own penalties.
00:31:57.730 - 00:32:47.934, Speaker A: In related news, Finance US delisted Tron's TRX token, resulting in a 6.4% decline in its value. The exchange cited its responsive digital asset monitoring process and changing industry circumstances for the delisting decision, stating that a token may be subject to review when it no longer meets their, quote, high standards. Salana's Saga smartphone with crypto features launches in May Salana Labs is launching its crypto focused Saga smartphone on May eigth. The Android device features custom addons, a seed vault for securely storing private keys and a dedicated DAP store for crypto applications. Priced at $1,000, the Saga aims to bring crypto capabilities to mobile users, but will only include Saga based protocols, leaving out the most used applications like Curve, Ave and Balancer.
00:32:48.062 - 00:32:49.586, Speaker B: For a better understanding of how it.
00:32:49.608 - 00:33:42.558, Speaker A: Actually works, check out the review done by Unchained reporter Jeff Benson. Tether Blacklist validator who exploited Mev Bots Tether blacklisted the wallet address of a rogue validator who managed to front run Maximal Extractable Value, or mev bots last week, amassing $25 million in profits. The validator's wallet holds $3 million worth of USDT mev bots, which have extracted an estimated $1.38 billion from users, have been widely criticized in the decentralized finance community. Tether's decision to blacklist the validator has sparked protests from industry experts as Lefteris Carapetzis, founder of Rotkey app Tweeted quote Mevbots have been slaughtering retail users via Sandwiching for years. Nobody blacklists them. Somebody dare fool a mevbot and give them a taste of their own medicine and they get blacklisted.
00:33:42.558 - 00:34:25.998, Speaker A: Polygon cofounder Jane T. Cannon called it, quote, a bad precedent. SushiSwap is hit by a $3 million exploit A sushi swap exploit led to a $3 million loss from user Zero X Sifu's wallet due to an improved related bug in the code. SushiSwap CEO Jared Gray confirmed the exploit and advised users to revoke permissions for contracts on the platform. Gray also stated that over 300 ETH had been recovered and the team was working with Lido to recover another 700 ETH. Whitehead hackers helped return some funds, but their efforts were hindered by mevbots that replicated and executed the exploit. SushiSwap is working on a retrieval plan to secure stolen funds and compensate affected users.
00:34:25.998 - 00:35:17.546, Speaker A: Furthermore, SushiSwap is preparing to launch a claims website for vested Sushi tokens held in its Merkel distributor contract, with unclaimed tokens being directed to SushiSwap's Treasury after April 23. Nexus Mutual seeks return of $2 Million from Euler Finance hack victims DFI insurance Protocol Nexus Mutual is looking to recover $2 million in claims paid out to victims of the Euler Finance hack, as users have since redeemed their funds following the return of the stolen funds by the hacker, Euler Finance enabled user redemptions totaling $133,000,000. However, five policyholders have yet to repay the claims received from Nexus Mutual. The policy terms state that in the event of funds being returned by the hacker, the claim value must be returned to Nexus Mutual. The insurer is considering potential legal action against those who haven't returned their claims. U. S.
00:35:17.546 - 00:35:54.382, Speaker A: Lawmakers Probe Circle and BlockFi's banking terms with Silicon Valley Bank this week. US. Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez sent letters to Circle and BlockFi among 14 firms questioning their decision to bank with the now collapsed Silicon Valley Bank. The lawmakers are investigating SVB's potential, quote, white glove treatment of certain depositors, including possible mutual back scratching arrangements that may have led to massive uninsured deposits. Circle and Blockfly held approximately $3.5 billion in uninsured deposits at SBB, with Circle accounting for $3.3 billion.
00:35:54.382 - 00:37:17.554, Speaker A: The letters addressed to Circle CEO Jeremy O'leare and Blockfly CEO Zach Prince inquire about the history of their relationships with SVB, amounts deposited and maintained, and any investment relationships between their firms, their related entities and SVB. In other regulatory developments, the SEC's Investor Advisory Committee requested that the SEC provide formal guidance for the crypto industry, but is still endorsing Chair Gary Gensler's efforts to enforce securities laws. Meanwhile, Wyoming Attorney General Bridget Hill filed a motion to intervene in Custodiabank's lawsuit against the Federal Reserve Board and Kansas City Fed. The lawsuit alleges that they unfairly delayed and denied the crypto friendly bank's application for a master account and membership. Hill seeks to defend, quote the legitimacy and viability of Wyoming's Special Purpose Depository Institution, or SPDI, framework, which the Fed reportedly criticized as inadequate. Arbitrum Community against proposal to return 700 million tokens following the controversial Arbitrum Foundation proposal last week, the community is now voting over a new proposal, AIP 10 five, which calls for the return of 700 million ARB tokens, quote unjustly allocated to the foundation. The proposal also asks for a token buyback from market maker Wintermute and disclosure of the Arbitrum Foundation's deal terms with wintermute.
00:37:17.554 - 00:38:03.750, Speaker A: However, this AIP is not getting much traction as over 80% of voters are against it. The proposal's author has also requested putting AIP one one and AIP one two on hold until community faith in the governance process is restored. Some community members believe the new proposal goes too far, calling it an overkill. Bitcoin Reaches the $30,000 Line bitcoin surpassed the $30,000 mark for the first time since June 2022, continuing a crypto rally that began at the start of the year. So far this year, bitcoin has risen 89%, while ether has increased by 59%. Some attribute this surge to the recent bank runs that have called into question the resiliency of the banking system. However, bitcoin is still down 25% from this time last year.
00:38:03.750 - 00:38:58.086, Speaker A: Meanwhile, MicroStrategy's bitcoin holdings are now in the green as the cryptocurrency's price rose above the company's average purchase price of 29 $803. However, the firm's profit margin remains slim, and a large scale sale of its holdings could potentially cause prices to drop. Bitcoin ordinals bug results in 1200 Orphan Inscriptions A bug in the bitcoin ordinals protocol caused 1200 valid inscriptions to be excluded, leading to debates within the community on how to address the issue. Ordinalscollector Leonidas.org revealed that the bug on Twitter, explaining that was found in the indexer function of the protocol, which only counts inscriptions in the first input of a transaction. Two potential solutions are being discussed. The first would retroactively index the missing inscriptions aligning with the on chain, logical ordering the second solution would change the indexing rules going forward, keeping the current inscription numbers and leaving the orphaned inscriptions out.
00:38:58.086 - 00:39:19.822, Speaker A: A Twitter poll indicated that the community leans toward the second option. Zhuo Ji Zhao, founder of NFT marketplace magic eden argued that history should be immutable. Some believe the orphaned inscriptions could be worth more if a fix is ever made. Time for fun bits. Unchained's jenny Hogan has a take on Bitcoin reaching $30,000 again.
00:39:19.956 - 00:39:56.842, Speaker F: Oh, I'm really so grateful that Gemini locked their withdrawals or I would have sold mine months ago. The rally may has something to do with speculation over interest rate hikes, which is the closest a lot of finance guys will come to experiencing PMS. They're not quite sure if it's happening, their mood tanks and it compels them to buy all kinds of weird shit. Speaking of, is anyone interested in buying my gently used zamboni? The rally could also be because bitcoin is seen as a hedge against the traditional banking system. JPMorgan put out a report last week that said recent problems exposed weaknesses in the traditional banking system. No offense JP, but I don't think recent problems exposed shit. The traditional banking system's been running around naked since at least 2008.
00:39:56.842 - 00:40:19.854, Speaker F: Mean, thank God for hedges or it would get arrested for public indecency. A lot of crypto guys are calling Bitcoin's rally a vindication of the crypto ecosystem. I would make a joke about it being revenge of the nerds, except that's just a straightforward description of what it is. Others say that it's related to Bitcoin's having event that's happening in 2024, but you don't need a big event for that. You want the crypto market cut in half again. Just ask SDF if he has a free second right now.
