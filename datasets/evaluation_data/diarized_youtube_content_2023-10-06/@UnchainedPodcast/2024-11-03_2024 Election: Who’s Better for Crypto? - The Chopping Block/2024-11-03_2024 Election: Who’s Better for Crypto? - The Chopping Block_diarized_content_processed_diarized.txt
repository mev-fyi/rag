00:00:00.280 - 00:00:02.129, Speaker A: It's a special edition of the Chopping.
00:00:02.177 - 00:00:14.405, Speaker B: Block, covering the 2024 presidential race, hosted by Robert Leshner. Right here, right now on the Chopping Block.
00:00:16.505 - 00:00:53.951, Speaker C: Hello, everyone, and welcome to the Chopping Block, the industry insider's perspective on the crypto topics of the day. And right now, there's no bigger topic in crypto than the US Presidential election taking place on Tuesday. This will be a special episode with a different format than you're used to. We're going to be hosting a debate between two titans of industry with different perspectives on the candidates to discern how the future of crypto in the US Might evolve differently under a Harris or a Trump presidency. I'm Robert Leshner, the czar of Super State and the moderator of today's debate. Joining me are Mike Novogratz, the godfather of Galaxy Digital, who's been working to advance the Democratic Party's views on crypto.
00:00:54.113 - 00:00:54.975, Speaker B: Hi, guys.
00:00:56.115 - 00:01:04.375, Speaker C: And Sean McGuire, the seasoned champion of Sequoia Capital, who catalyzed the Silicon Valley debate when he publicly donated $300,000 to Trump in May.
00:01:05.195 - 00:01:07.587, Speaker A: Hey, everyone. Thrilled to be here, Sean.
00:01:07.731 - 00:01:45.741, Speaker C: We are all early stage investors in crypto, but I want to caveat that nothing we say is investment advice, legal advice, or even life advice. Please see TheChoppingBlock XYZ for more disclosures. Before we begin, I'd like to start by sharing my backdrop of thinking for this debate and discussion in general. I believe that there's two intertwined segments of the crypto industry. Assets that go up, like bitcoin and crypto market infrastructure, like custody, trading, defi wallets, tokenization, RWAs, et cetera. A lot of things that Galaxy does. During both the Trump and Biden administrations, we've seen the growth in the price of crypto assets, albeit it's been more muted during Biden's presidency.
00:01:45.741 - 00:02:09.505, Speaker C: But during the Biden administration, we've seen a very obvious headwind from the administration against crypto market infrastructure, ranging from Operation Chokepoint 2.0 to the regulation by enforcement approach of the SEC. Both candidates offer an opportunity for change, and today I'd like us to explore how they would go about accomplishing it. Starting with Sean. How could Trump be better for crypto assets and crypto market infrastructure?
00:02:10.845 - 00:02:34.623, Speaker A: Hey, everyone. Happy to be here. Ready to get my head chopped off by Novo, someone I have admired for a long time and only met in person maybe three times. It's crazy for me to be. I just got to start with the meta point. It's crazy for me to be defending Trump because in 2016. I was all in behind Hillary and thought that Trump was a Russian spy and that the world would end if he got elected.
00:02:34.623 - 00:03:11.847, Speaker A: And so I just have to start that. It's been quite the journey for me. I think some of the pillars of why I think Trump would be better on crypto specifically are, one, he is a huge fan of deregulation, and we see, you know, with people like Elon, like, them embodying that. Two, I mean, he's really. I would say a few years ago, he was extremely skeptical of crypto, but obviously in the last year, he's, like, really gotten into it maybe. Maybe even too much, like, to the point that he's a degen.
00:03:11.961 - 00:03:15.295, Speaker C: Well, we're going to talk about world liberty a little bit later on the episode.
00:03:16.515 - 00:03:53.203, Speaker A: But look, he's got young children that are really into crypto and I think have educated him on where it's going, at least certain aspects of it. And at least as far as I can tell, he. He seems like a true believer at this point. I also think, you know, he's. From my experience, I think Trump feeds on love. Like, when. When people show him love and respect, like, that's such a opposite emotion of what he's been getting for the last eight years from the media, that when he gets that, he creates a positive feedback loop for him, and he really craves more of it.
00:03:53.203 - 00:04:24.685, Speaker A: And just to be very candid, seeing him at the, you know, bitcoin conference, like, the love he got, I. I think he just. He sees that this movement cannily. Crypto is kind of a populist movement, and that's very much in line with Trump's views. And when I say populist movement, I mean it's driven from the bottoms up. For me, the thing that. The moment where that made me feel like crypto has to exist is I did an around the world backpacking trip in 2009 and 2010.
00:04:24.685 - 00:04:50.187, Speaker A: This was the very, very beginning of crypto. And specifically, I took a bus from Paraguay into Bolivia, and our bus broke down. I got stuck in the Chaco Desert, and I didn't have any. We were just across the border in Bolivia. I didn't have any Bolivian money. Literally had to barter for food and just had this very strong feeling of how broken money is for most people in the world. Not for people in America.
00:04:50.187 - 00:05:07.525, Speaker A: Our banking infrastructure is pretty damn good, but for most people in the world. And I just. I think Trump, despite the eat the dogs and cats memes, like, I think he's a champion of Kind of the people at the bottom end of the income bracket. I think that's where crypto benefits the most.
00:05:09.025 - 00:05:12.137, Speaker C: Excellent. Mike, your turn. Why would Harris listen?
00:05:12.161 - 00:05:58.175, Speaker B: It would be disingenuous to come out in here and say, you know, Harris is going to be better for crypto than Trump. Right? I mean, you just. Sean gave a pretty eloquent description, but, like, let's be more practical even, right? His secretary of treasury will probably be Senator Hagerty, who has been one of our great champions in the Senate. The head of his transition team, Howard Lutnick, he runs Cantor. Fitzgerald is a big bitcoin owner himself, so he's got a vested interest, but he also makes a fortune helping tether buy and store their Treasuries. And so he's got a vested interest both in stablecoins. And so the people surround him, JD Vance, Peter Thiel, lots of the advisors, all are pro crypto.
00:05:58.175 - 00:06:09.515, Speaker B: And so I think I will get much richer if Trump wins, as most of the people on this call will be. Why am I a Harris supporter?
00:06:10.095 - 00:06:40.801, Speaker A: I just want to say I fully agree with Novo there, but I just want to add one nuance, and I was told to chop it up, keep this interactive, Chop me up as much as you want. But one thing that I, as I came out and supported Trump, a lot of people said, oh, you're doing it just for the money. And I agree with Novo here. I think that crypto will absolutely pump. And I'm a major crypto holder. And so, like, he's right. But that is like, not even a top three or four issue form.
00:06:40.801 - 00:07:16.015, Speaker A: Like, my own personal wealth is not a top three or four issue on supporting Trump. And there's a very important nuance, which is when he got elected in 2016, my taxes went up, as did basically any wealthy person on a coast. You know, he got rid of this thing called the salt, you know, deduction, which let you deduct your state and local taxes, you know, before paying federal income taxes. And so my taxes went up pretty significantly. And so I just want to say Novo is totally right. I think anyone in crypto will make a lot more money under Trump. But I'll.
00:07:16.015 - 00:07:25.175, Speaker A: And I think there are a lot of Trump supporters are doing it purely for financial reasons. I have to say for myself, it's really ideological reasons, like, not financial.
00:07:26.395 - 00:08:05.461, Speaker B: So let me take the other side on the Harris stuff, because, listen, what our industry has gone through the last four years is un American, unfair and infuriating. I have spent a fortune in legal fees, a Galaxy has defending stupid or answering stupid subpoenas for other people. You know, defending ourselves, just the tax. Our audit costs three times what a normal audit of a company our size should be. We spend $9 million a year on audit, for God's sakes. We were a small company, now we're a medium sized company. I learned small companies are under 500 people.
00:08:05.461 - 00:08:06.837, Speaker B: We've just gone over 500.
00:08:06.901 - 00:08:08.225, Speaker C: So congratulations.
00:08:08.565 - 00:08:40.185, Speaker B: Not sure that's a good thing or a bad thing, but. And so it's, it's, it's, it's been infuriating to be a Democrat and to be in crypto. What I would say is about a year ago that started to shift people. I mean I had this line that there are more crypto owners and dog owners in America. And I think people got the message. And Biden made a deal with Elizabeth Warren in order to get elected and he held true to that deal. And Elizabeth Warren had an undue influence on Democratic policy.
00:08:40.185 - 00:10:00.105, Speaker B: Crypto that's come to an end, it just has. And the Harris campaign has been very clear, less publicly, but certainly privately, that this will be a first term presidency, that it'll be pro innovation, that they get it, they will push for crypto legislation and a lame duck just to get that off the table. And so while I don't think it will be as you're not going to get a, a push for a strategic reserve, a bitcoin strategic reserve or a commitment not to sell the bitcoin, that's with the U.S. marshals. You will get decent legislation around a market structure, stable coins and you'll get I think a push to, and the most important thing for all our community forgetting stablecoin legislation and market structure legislation. It is a direction from the new president through treasury to the OCC and the Fed that you need to let banks own crypto on their balance sheet and you need to let the big old custodians like bank of New York custody crypto. Bank of New York got permission to custody a tiny bit of crypto does nothing right.
00:10:00.105 - 00:10:40.155, Speaker B: If you see traditional banks start participating, it will increase the amount of participation of our community immensely. And so listen, I don't think, I think Harris will be significantly, significantly better than Biden. And the rest of my reasons are more personal and philosophical. I'm a character over policy guy. 41 of the 45 self appointed cabinet members of the first Trump administration won't work for him. If Sean decided he was going to start his own venture company and 90% of his employees said I'M never working for that guy. No one's investing in him.
00:10:40.155 - 00:11:10.883, Speaker B: This is one of the strangest setups we've ever had. Every single general that worked for Trump, with the exception of the one that got arrested and put in jail and then pardoned, won't work for him. And so there's something that's so volatile about him. Listen, times he's unbelievably charming and good, and you think, oh, with Elon around, maybe we're going to get some great stuff happening. But the facts are the facts that his entire last regime says. Namas, can I go back to one.
00:11:10.899 - 00:11:28.371, Speaker C: Of the things you said? You said that there's been a shift in, we'll call it the Democrats views towards crypto. Do you think that shift is at the campaign level or the administration level? Because there's a lot of indications still that the administration that's currently in power has not made a shift. You know, every day on Twitter, Biden's.
00:11:28.403 - 00:12:03.007, Speaker B: Administration, Gensler, those guys aren't shifting. It is the Harris team that has pledged we will be much better on this issue. It's Senator Schumer who was trying to push a bill Fu. It's the guys in the House. And I think Hakeem Jeffries probably becomes the speaker of the House. And, you know, listen, if you're a Wall Streeter, you always pray for split government, like you don't want to sweep if you're a Wall street guy. And so I think consensus is that the Democrats win the House, the Republicans win the Senate, and the.
00:12:03.007 - 00:12:07.751, Speaker B: And right now that Trump wins the presidency, though, I think it's probably closer than the polls show.
00:12:07.903 - 00:12:16.071, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's. I just trust in Poly Market and the prediction markets, you know, as being a good barometer. But, you know, that's a whole different debate.
00:12:16.223 - 00:12:36.667, Speaker B: Again, 80. 80 to 90% of people, crypto are guys and 90% are guys to start with in crypto. Right. And guys are overwhelmingly Trump and females are overwhelmingly Harris. It could be literally 67% either way on both sides. And so I don't think polymarket is even close to a good indicator.
00:12:36.851 - 00:12:44.055, Speaker C: What about Kalshi? What about the markets on Interactive Brokers and Robinhood? I mean, at this point, there's like a number of different venues to trade.
00:12:44.525 - 00:12:55.549, Speaker B: I just think there's such a sex bias there. Again, look at how many followers you have on Twitter today and tell me male versus female. I bet you 85% of your followers on Twitter are male.
00:12:55.677 - 00:12:59.613, Speaker C: I would go with like 92%. You know, I'm just guessing, right.
00:12:59.789 - 00:13:32.579, Speaker A: I'm going to jump in because we're now getting like a few points back, you know, that I want to address. But I'll just say on the Poly Market Kalshi debate, you know, Sequoia's investor in Kalshi. I'm, I'm a huge fan of prediction market space. I agree with Mike that there's a lot of kind of systematic bias in who the users are. But I also, I personally think that the prediction markets are probably slightly better than the polls. Like, I think there's systematic bias in each. If I had to only choose one to represent the true odds.
00:13:32.579 - 00:13:59.833, Speaker A: Like, I think the prediction markets are closer and even though they're such large, you know, bias, the whole point of prediction markets is, you know, if there's systematic bias and some smart trader can go arb that and you know, make money. And I think there are a lot of, you know, you get this French whale with $43 million, whatever, on Poly market. I don't think he's doing that because he's, you know, it's, he's not just like a stoner trying to just like bet his team.
00:13:59.969 - 00:14:12.873, Speaker B: Betting on binary outcomes is, it's very difficult ex post to figure out how accurate it was. Right. Like, binary bets are hard in that respect. Listen, I do think this has been great for prediction markets.
00:14:13.009 - 00:14:43.233, Speaker A: I think, I think we all, I think we all agree on that. I just want to go back. I actually have two points from the past that I want to address. One. So truly I agree with Mike on most things and I really respect Mike a ton. He's a titan of crypto and has done a huge amount to advance crypto, you know, especially from a regulatory perspective and Washington perspective. One comment I have on Harris, though is I don't feel like we actually know what her positions are on things right now.
00:14:43.233 - 00:15:13.091, Speaker A: And I don't mean that just as a talking point. Like in my heart, I really believe, I don't know what she thinks. Like, she didn't run a full, you know, campaign the way candidates have. Historically, she's done very few interviews. Interviews have for the most part been very scripted. You know, just, just last night CNN aired a clip of her. Basically her ads in Michigan are kind of very pro Palestine and her and her ads in Pennsylvania are very pro Israel.
00:15:13.091 - 00:15:48.831, Speaker A: And I just, I feel like we've seen her now take both sides on a lot of issues. And first, I think Mike is right. I think that she will have a pro crypto stance and Much better than Biden, but I don't think we know for sure. Whereas with Trump, I think we know for sure that he will take a very pro crypto stance. And then just one other point I want to go back to, you know, on the 45 cabinet members or whatever, and all generals, except for Flynn not supporting him. I worked in the DoD. I worked with a lot of those people.
00:15:48.831 - 00:16:25.455, Speaker A: I deployed to Afghanistan. I've done really crazy shit that no one knows about. Like, really crazy shit. And I'm still very deeply in touch with that world. First of all, I know a lot of people that served in Trump's cabinet that have a very different perspective. And second, I've just got to say, like, in 2020, there were 51 intelligence officials, including five former CIA directors, that signed a letter, you know, two weeks before the election saying that Hunter Biden laptop was Russian, Russian disinformation, which it obviously wasn't. And the FBI and DOJ had access to it for a year before that.
00:16:25.455 - 00:16:55.573, Speaker A: And I'm sorry, but I'm be honest, I think there are deep state effects that I'm happy to unpack that we cannot ignore. And it's part of why I'm supporting Trump. And that is just an objective 51 intelligence officials with five former CIA directors all colluding, you know, to say that the Hunter Biden laptop was fake, like that actually happened, that is verifiable. And on the question, because it's a.
00:16:55.589 - 00:17:27.049, Speaker B: Real question, like, there's a difference between like minor hysteria or hysteria under pressure, right? Like, do you believe that those 51 knew it was. It was Russian disinformation and said it wasn't, or their bias was there? Of course, this is Russian information. It reeks of Russian information. Therefore my best guess is it's Russian information and it became a self enforced enforce, reinforcing hysteria even when it was wrong.
00:17:27.217 - 00:17:53.059, Speaker A: I think it's an amazing question. It's exactly the right question. And for its worth, I think what you're implying is correct. Like, I think that only maybe two or three of the 51 actually knew that it was, that it was, that they were lying. There are certainly two or three that were running an op and knew they were lying. And I think the rest just trusted their, you know, trusted people that they had served with. And I, because I had served, I trusted that letter deeply.
00:17:53.059 - 00:18:24.985, Speaker A: I probably would have signed it if I had a bunch of former CIA directors, you know, which was an agency I trusted a lot, telling me that this was Russian disinformation. Like, that for me is like, we cannot. We cannot let a Russian asset get elected into the US Presidency. And so if you're with very limited information and a tight timeline before an election, like, honestly, I probably would have signed it then. I would never sign it now. Now I'm much more skeptical. But I will just say, like, I'm going to go native.
00:18:25.685 - 00:18:26.773, Speaker C: Please go native.
00:18:26.909 - 00:19:01.035, Speaker A: I worked with General Flynn. I sat in a skiff with, like, his top two aides every day for many years, including, like, during the Bat Raid and which is when the SEAL Team 6 got Osama bin Laden. And that guy's a patriot. And I'm sorry, but if you go actually look at the details of what happened to him, and very few people understand what actually happened to him. It was a setup. He got really screwed. And the way to go further, and this has been one of the things that's kind of radicalized me.
00:19:01.035 - 00:19:30.723, Speaker A: I believe that in recent years, the Democrats have introduced a new tactic against the Republicans. And don't get me wrong, I think the Republicans. I'm afraid that the Republicans would use the same tactic back at the Democrats. I think that both sides are pretty similar, and whenever a new tactic is invented, the other side will use it four years later. And I'm very afraid of that. But this new tactic is what I would call political jaywalking. So, like, take, I think the simplest example is classified documents.
00:19:30.723 - 00:19:35.363, Speaker A: Hillary Clinton had, you know, thousands of classified documents on her email server.
00:19:35.419 - 00:19:36.627, Speaker B: Yeah, agreed, agreed.
00:19:36.771 - 00:20:06.345, Speaker A: You know, Joe Biden had classified documents in at least three locations. Mike Pence had classified documents, and Trump had classified documents. The only one that got indicted on this was Trump. And I will just say, like, if you were to look at every president in the history of America, like, they've basically all taken some classified documents back with them. First of all, they have declassification authority. Second of all, they're taking mementos back to go into their future presidential libraries and all of this. And third, it's like, it's kind of chaotic on the way out, you know, and it's.
00:20:06.345 - 00:20:40.125, Speaker A: There's just different levels to this. Like, you know, if you take something and it's in your basement and it's a future memento, and if you declassified it by literally just saying out loud to one friend that as you're leaving, like, okay, I'm declassifying everything we're taking with us, that's all legal, and just the fact that basically everyone's been doing this, no one had gotten indicted for this until Trump. It's like jaywalking. Jaywalking is technically illegal some places, but no. 1, people are very rarely arrested for it. And what happened to Flynn is honestly, it was the first example of political jaywalking in the Trump administration. So the quick version is, you know.
00:20:40.165 - 00:20:56.351, Speaker B: Basically, listen, shall I agree with you what is frustrating or. I think my reality is you look at a guy like Flynn and I'll take your word that he was a decent patriot and a rational guy. And then he gets, you can call it law fared or jaywalking or whatever.
00:20:56.383 - 00:21:19.105, Speaker A: You want, and then he's no longer rational. Now he's so angry that now he's angry, he's unhinged. And I don't disagree with you. You know, I honestly don't disagree with you. But I think it's worth, like, if you actually understand what happened to him. It's like basically the highest level. But just let me say this really quickly.
00:21:19.105 - 00:22:03.173, Speaker A: Like the highest level is that for every administration in history, after the election in November, you take office in January, there's this two month transition. Basically every administration in history has had some minor contact between the transition team and some foreign allies and foreign adversaries of very basic, like, hey, we'll be taking office. These are our keys positions. You know, like, we're looking forward to talking to you right when we join office. That is technically illegal, you know, to be doing any level of political diplomacy, you know, on behalf of your nation when you're not in office. But no one had ever, everyone's done it, no one's ever gotten charged for it. That's what they were going after Flynn for.
00:22:03.173 - 00:22:41.053, Speaker A: And he was smart enough to know that it's technically illegal and that they're going after him for it. And so he kind of lied about the continents of the call, but it was lose, lose, and he knew that they were going after him and, and after that, and then seeing everything that he saw, he became so radicalized that I agree, it's, it's like destructive at this point. But I'm with the generals that have gone after Trump and the cabinet members. That is a talking point. I literally know hundreds of people that Trump served in Trump's cabinet, or, sorry, in, in his, you know, served in his office. And I think there's just way more nuance. I'm happy to unpack it for anyone.
00:22:41.053 - 00:22:46.805, Speaker A: We could keep going back to crypto, but I think it's just, it's, I just have to push on that because I don't think many people actually appreciate.
00:22:46.965 - 00:23:31.861, Speaker B: The Other piece that the people that won't vote for Trump because it's, it's. Listen, there's a lot of good that could come with Trump, right? Like, you know, who knows? I don't think either. One of the reasons I'm kind of bullish either way is, you know, Trump wants to spend, spend, spend, and cut taxes, and Harris wants to spend, spend, spend, and raise taxes. We both have huge deficits, big deficits. You know, money printer goes burr and crypto goes higher, and no one's addressing the elephant in the room, which is we've got $36 trillion in debt growing a trillion every hundred days. And, you know, the bond market might kick us in the nuts or kick us in the stomach, I should say. Kids have been chiding me for bad, bad language online at one point.
00:23:31.861 - 00:23:45.749, Speaker B: Right. The, that, you know, and you. Elon's the only guy on the campaign so far that's been saying, hey, we're going to bankrupt our kids. We got to do something about this. Now, it's disingenuous to say I can cut 2 trillion out of the deficit. I mean, just to make.
00:23:45.797 - 00:23:47.645, Speaker A: I think Elon could, for what it's worth.
00:23:47.685 - 00:24:06.645, Speaker B: But just to make things clear, 57% of the $6.75 trillion budget is Medicare, Social Security, and debt service. So now you're at 43%. Left, right. The military is close to 20% of that. And Trump has said he wants to increase the military spending, not decrease it. So you're down to 23%.
00:24:06.645 - 00:24:10.065, Speaker B: Left, right. That is less than 2 trillion.
00:24:11.845 - 00:24:18.309, Speaker A: I think you could wildly restructure health services in this country and Medicare if.
00:24:18.317 - 00:24:25.887, Speaker B: You'Re willing to touch them. And we're going to have to. Yeah, it's a whole new ballgame. But no politician has come close in this cycle.
00:24:26.031 - 00:24:39.635, Speaker C: Well, let's take this to the macroeconomic backdrop. If Trump wins or if Harris wins. So, Novo, your view is that in either case, the deficit is effed and that's a tailwind to crypto asset prices.
00:24:41.495 - 00:25:04.361, Speaker A: So thought experiment, novo, what if we restructure Social Security and instead of holding dollars right now to pay out in dollars, what if we bought a bunch of bitcoin and paid out in dollar prices later on? Basically, if you restructure and buy some asset that you believe is going to appreciate like crazy into the future, then your notional.
00:25:04.553 - 00:25:33.365, Speaker B: That's a little bit like putting bitcoin in the reserve. If you're the reserve, you have to have everyone believe you're the reserve for good. If you're going to slowly inflate away that 36 trillion in debt which you need to do. You've got to be so subtle about it, or it becomes a runaway train. And so listen, here's the great irony. If Elon came in, or anyone came in and took us from 125% of GDP back down under 100, I'd be selling my bitcoin.
00:25:34.985 - 00:25:35.793, Speaker A: I would not.
00:25:35.849 - 00:25:41.921, Speaker B: But our story is our story. I'd be selling my goal. The story of hard.
00:25:42.033 - 00:25:46.597, Speaker C: Can I hold you that, Novo? Can we come back on the show in four years and you can say I sold my bitcoin?
00:25:46.761 - 00:25:54.493, Speaker B: Well, I just don't think. I don't think there's political will in this country. We have populism on both sides to do the hard things.
00:25:54.669 - 00:26:08.317, Speaker A: And that's why I'm wrong for the most part. I agree with you. And I think the deficit is a giant problem. That said, I am bullish. The only thing I don't disagree on is I'm bullish on bitcoin in basically any scenario.
00:26:08.421 - 00:26:36.355, Speaker B: Let me ask you a question. So if I was the Secretary of Treasury and I came in and said, all right, we're cutting the deficit, we're raising taxes a little bit, not a lot. We're slashing spending, we're Social Security. You're now 70 years if you were born, if you're 20 or less, you know, we're means testing both Medicare and Social Security and we're looking for efficiency gains. You know, when I first got out, my first job was at the Office of Management and budget in 1984.
00:26:36.515 - 00:26:37.651, Speaker A: You're old, Novo.
00:26:37.723 - 00:26:55.005, Speaker B: I'm old as fuck. And there was a thing called The Grace Commission. W.R. grace. Big company. They took the best and brightest from a bunch of Wall street firms, sent them to DC For a year, and said, come up with exactly what Elon's talking about. Show us how we can make government more efficient.
00:26:55.005 - 00:27:07.783, Speaker B: And they had a big book. And the best computer guy in the office at that point was me as a 20 year old who could do Lotus Notes. And they said, hey, can you codify this?
00:27:07.949 - 00:27:09.219, Speaker A: And I was like, are you kidding?
00:27:09.267 - 00:27:27.455, Speaker B: It was a book like this of all the projects. And so they quickly hired Computer Data Corp to do it instead of me. And I went back to college. If you did all of that, do you still think, what's the argument? To still belong? Bitcoin.
00:27:28.155 - 00:28:03.475, Speaker A: So I think that all of that would set bitcoin back five or six years or something. Um, but for me, I really. I Don't view crypto as an American thing. I personally think that like by far the dominant demand for crypto over the next few decades is the developing world and global south, you know, and it's, it's not even, it's not like Mali, it's also Brazil, you know, it's definitely Argentina. It's def, like it's all of Africa, you know.
00:28:03.935 - 00:28:28.915, Speaker B: Let me ask you another fair question right now. If I asked any one of those, you know, let's call them places where people have lost a lot of faith in economic stewardship. Nigeria, the Naira just keeps getting worse and worse. Would you rather have a dollar stablecoin that or a bitcoin? I think most would still rather have a dollar stablecoin because I agree, I.
00:28:29.255 - 00:29:32.765, Speaker A: Agree too, but I think that they're heavily correlated and I think things like, you know, if you're, if you have a stable coin, you're going to try to get yield on the deposits and I think you'll buy, you know, you'll buy a lot of dollar denominated things, treasury bonds, etc. But I think you'll also have 10, 20%. That's you know, you'll buy bitcoin, you'll buy, you know, some equities, you'll buy some things that are slightly higher interest, slightly higher risk, uncorrelated. I think that like stable stablecoin growth I think actually feeds crypto growth more broadly. And I think bitcoin is just a very unique asset that is for me the, like my worst case for bitcoin, in my personal opinion, again, this is not investment advice. My worst case is that bitcoin surpasses gold, that it flips gold over the next 20 years or something like, I think bitcoin is just for my generation and younger. I think bitcoin is just structurally better in every way than gold.
00:29:32.765 - 00:29:57.393, Speaker A: And I think that the dream scenario of bitcoin is it becomes a hundred trillion plus asset class in today's dollars. I think that that probably doesn't, you don't achieve that level. If America really gets its act together and we have the dollar is still the world's, you know, reserve currency in 20, 30 years that's just still structurally strong. So that's how I think about it.
00:29:57.449 - 00:30:03.625, Speaker B: And just, just so I'm really clear on my macro view, I think the chance of the US getting its act together is really low.
00:30:03.785 - 00:30:04.737, Speaker A: I agree with you.
00:30:04.841 - 00:30:42.363, Speaker B: I think actually almost the best we can hope for is really gifted people around the table who can run inflation at 4 to 5% but not have it accelerate and slowly inflate away this debt. And in that case, bitcoin should still go higher 100%. And so listen, I'm long, I'm not selling. I think on a Trump, when we break 73 and go a lot higher fast on a Harris win, we probably flush down to high 50s, low 60s, bottom and then end up going up pretty quick.
00:30:42.539 - 00:30:58.257, Speaker C: Well, I was going to save this question to the lightning round at the end, but since you're already bringing it up Novo, you know, 30 days after election, where do you see prices with each candidate? You sort of just said it, but without this specific timeframe of 30 days and Sean, 30 days after the election for either candidate winning, where do you.
00:30:58.321 - 00:31:33.619, Speaker B: Think is always hard. But if you take out 73, your next target's 100. And you know, that would be my year end, you know, January target, you know, you often take out 73, you go up to 85 and then you come back and you'll touch 73 again. Everyone will panic. And some people, you know, paper hands or whatever you want to call them, and then it goes back higher. There's a lot of negative gamma, you know, a lot of people have done call overrides. Yeah, listen, there's obviously someone selling a ton of crypto around above 72,000, 70,000.
00:31:33.619 - 00:31:50.495, Speaker B: I mean you're just. The price action is, you know, monster, monster supply keeps coming out and it's concentrated. I wish I could tell you who it was, I don't know, yelling at all my salespeople to find out, but we haven't seen that flow.
00:31:51.635 - 00:31:52.755, Speaker C: Sean, what do you think?
00:31:52.875 - 00:32:23.961, Speaker A: I have basically the exact same answer. Last time I looked at all the cell walls, there's a huge, the next cell walls around 100K. And I think if Trump wins, we're touching 100K, you know, by end of January. And that said, like, I think that we'll be stuck there for a while because you have to get, you know, and whether it's 95k or 100k, like I think you're stuck in that domain for a while, just selling through kind of all the, all the excess.
00:32:24.113 - 00:32:26.593, Speaker B: Right. The market cap of gold is what.
00:32:26.649 - 00:32:29.025, Speaker A: 15, 15 trillion, trillion now. Yeah.
00:32:29.065 - 00:32:47.121, Speaker B: Right. And market cap of Bitcoin at 100 is 2 trillion. And so you got 7x. I've always had that as a 10 year target, 20 year target. What's driving gold right now is China and Russia central bank buying a ton of it. And so we've got central banks Taking out supply. We haven't.
00:32:47.121 - 00:32:50.017, Speaker B: Other than Ecuador and a few other small places.
00:32:50.081 - 00:32:51.193, Speaker A: El Salvador.
00:32:51.369 - 00:33:00.365, Speaker B: El Salvador. I'm sorry, we haven't really seen nation state Abu Dhabi has bought some, but it's a.
00:33:00.905 - 00:33:25.793, Speaker A: We have seen there are some corporate Treasuries that are not publicly disclosed that have significant bitcoin reserves. And I think that's kind of like, I think the next step of giant demand would be like some corporate treasuries that have a lot of cash and don't know what to do with it. Putting 5% of their cash or whatever in Bitcoin as opposed to returning it.
00:33:25.809 - 00:33:29.023, Speaker C: To shareholders or I think some of.
00:33:29.039 - 00:33:37.355, Speaker A: Them have more cash than they even know how to return to shareholders, you know, and obviously not on the limit, but like, you know, you want to keep some cash.
00:33:37.695 - 00:33:42.063, Speaker B: What was this up with Microsoft having a, was it a vote?
00:33:42.199 - 00:33:47.567, Speaker C: I think it was more of a PR stunt where, you know, if you get just enough votes of the shares, you can get something on the agenda.
00:33:47.671 - 00:33:48.991, Speaker B: Oh, I see, right.
00:33:49.103 - 00:33:58.973, Speaker C: And I think it'll be defeated, you know, when it comes up at the next meeting by like 99.5 to 0.5 or whatever. But you can, you know, get things onto the agenda given so we can.
00:33:58.989 - 00:34:01.421, Speaker B: All buy one share of Microsoft just to vote.
00:34:01.493 - 00:34:48.057, Speaker A: But the point I'm making is if you look on a 10 year time horizon, I think the thing that would be the next step to really drive giant demand would be corporate balance sheets saying the dollar has some structural issues, some inflationary issues, like we're gonna, we need working capital. Bitcoin's very liquid. We'll put 5% of our cash into, you know, bitcoin or whatever. And sure, return if you have too much surplus cash, returns on the shareholders, buy back shares, etc. But that I think the level beyond that would be nation state activity. Obviously if people felt like the US was going to set up a bitcoin reserve like it's, things would go freaking.
00:34:48.121 - 00:34:49.417, Speaker B: Wild, things would go crazy.
00:34:49.601 - 00:34:54.959, Speaker A: Yeah, small Middle East UAE will try to front run us and it will go crazy.
00:34:55.047 - 00:35:07.231, Speaker C: Well, here's a question then directed at Novo. If Harris wins, do you think there's any plausibility for the US establishing a bitcoin reserve of some kind? Or do you think that just extends that prospect?
00:35:07.303 - 00:35:56.629, Speaker B: Listen, as a bitcoin holder, you'd love a bitcoin reserve. As a policy guy, I think the government can make a strong argument that we're going to own some bitcoin on our balance sheet to signal that we're going to be technology first, that we're going to be an innovator and a leader in decentralized systems and freedom, if you want to be bold about it. George Washington said, there's no freedom without private property. And Bitcoin is private property in its purest sense. And so we can make that argument. I think it's very dangerous for a central bank or a country who is the reserve currency to say, I'm going to put other think about what happened with Luna, right. Luna was using Luna Token as its reserve for its algorithmic stablecoin.
00:35:56.629 - 00:36:39.181, Speaker B: And when they said, oh, we're now going to use some Bitcoin because we're worried about Luna, people said, wait a minute, let me. How does this whole thing work? You're turning magical Internet money into dollars to buy Bitcoin. You think you could do that? Infinitely. And that created the awareness that all wasn't well in a algorithmic stablecoin where they were paying 18% leverage, 18% interest. That awareness wasn't there until they bought Bitcoin. And so you've got to be pretty careful when you're the reserve currency traditionally, who wins the reserve currency? The country that has the Navy that controls disease. The Brits did it, the Spaniards did it, the Brits did it, we did it.
00:36:39.181 - 00:36:40.261, Speaker B: And we used to.
00:36:40.333 - 00:37:27.229, Speaker A: It's also, it's also the. So Army Navy is by far the most important. But I think the second thing is it's whichever country has historically had the, like the store of value as well. And I think the kind of the hidden secondary piece around the dollar becoming the world's reserve currency was like, in addition to, you know, UK going into lots of debt and their Army Navy being heavily weakened and kind of being seen as probably not even a top three Army Navy post World War II. During World War II, almost all of the world's gold went to America for safekeeping. And so when you came out of World War II, just like the. France's gold, the UK's gold, like Spain's gold, it was all just sitting in America.
00:37:27.229 - 00:37:35.129, Speaker A: And so we already had it in our banks and we're able to have this dollar, you know, this, this gold reserve.
00:37:35.297 - 00:37:57.845, Speaker B: What's also interesting, and this is where Elon is so fascinating, if you think about aircraft carriers, which were. Nate is the Navy, if you think about it like any. Right. And how vulnerable they are now to the drones that the Houthis are actually, you know, with. With. I actually went on a. It looked like a jet ski, but it was A bigger jet ski.
00:37:57.845 - 00:38:38.377, Speaker B: Like it was an electric jet ski. So it was quiet, high powered. And this woman was trying to get me to invest in it and she was like, were getting huge orders from the military because they just make these autonomous drones and they can send a thousand jet skis out there at the same time and you can't stop them all. So I actually think the next frontier of dominance is satellites with, you know, somebody showed me this whole project with you have a tungsten rod that you drop from space and by the time it hits, it's pinpointed, pinpointed, you know, 1 meter target. It creates such. Because it's going at a zillion miles.
00:38:38.401 - 00:38:56.985, Speaker A: An hour, it's basically landing. It's like how SpaceX lands, you know, Starship or Falcon 9. You basically land. If you go look at the mechanics, it's basically a rod and it's the same control problem. And you basically, with tiny little tail fins or whatever, you can guide it at terminal velocity.
00:38:57.025 - 00:39:38.907, Speaker B: Now you've got like a freaking, you know, mini nuke or. You ever hit anyone you want to hit? And so like who, who controls space? And that's a real big. Well, what is frustrating about this presidential campaign on both sides is all the issues that we should be discussing. AI and how it's going to impact our future, right? How we have amazing inequality In America, yet only 25 million ish people are paying tax for the other 300 million. So we already have this skewed amount of who's paying for it, but we still have inequality. It's really complicated stuff out there right now. You can look at inequality differently once you take government subsidies and that's.
00:39:38.907 - 00:40:01.717, Speaker B: So it's not as bad. But these are really complicated questions in a world where change is happening so fast and our debate isn't there. Right. I mean, just watch the Madison Square Garden debate or the nicer version, which was Harris on the Mall. Very different tone, but no content. Right.
00:40:01.741 - 00:40:18.785, Speaker C: So how do you think the actual conversation will be established post election, post inauguration if it's not happening now? Will the debate of AI policy and crypto policy be entirely behind closed doors? Will it be done in the halls of Congress? How do you think that shakes out?
00:40:19.085 - 00:40:20.703, Speaker A: Remember, like it'll be done in the.
00:40:20.719 - 00:40:24.463, Speaker C: Halls of X depending on who wins.
00:40:24.559 - 00:40:33.407, Speaker A: It's, it's. If Trump wins, I think it's gonna, I think that we're gonna get a lot of pontification on X. And if Harris wins, X might be banned.
00:40:33.511 - 00:40:50.473, Speaker B: Yeah, well, the problem with X is, you know, it's 80% right now. It used to be a platform of debate and now it's just a right wing echo chamber. It was Fox News with a tech bet. And so. And I get a lot of my, you know, because I'm an ex guy. Right. So.
00:40:50.473 - 00:41:05.825, Speaker B: And so it's frustrating because I do think it's the same bias. You're seeking polymarket. You're like, oh my God, this election's over. And then I talk to people on the ground in Pennsylvania. They're like, dude, we are going to be counting every last vote. It's going to be within 10,000 votes. You know, he pissed off the Puerto Ricans.
00:41:05.825 - 00:41:28.193, Speaker B: There's a half a million Puerto Ricans in Pennsylvania. And Bad Bunny just went there. I mean, there's all these, there's these little mini narratives that are real. And that's how politics works. Right. It's a ground game. And the one thing the Democrats have going for them while they're losing the big narrative, they have a much more sophisticated ground game in Wisconsin, certainly Michigan and Pennsylvania, than the Republicans.
00:41:28.193 - 00:41:31.249, Speaker B: Right. The Republicans had Laura Trump as their head.
00:41:31.337 - 00:41:56.973, Speaker A: Yeah. I think this is a very important point. And it's like, it's actually gets to a big part of how I'm voting in this election. I don't view this election as about. It's like I'm not voting for Trump or against Harris. Honestly, I'm voting like against the Democratic machine. And let me just say a little bit on that.
00:41:56.973 - 00:42:17.201, Speaker A: Like, my rough mental model is that all sides are roughly equal if given the opportunity. And that basically the legacy Republican machine and legacy Democratic machine were co evolving for more than 100 years. And when one side learned a tactic, the other side would figure it out by the next cycle. Gerrymandering.
00:42:17.233 - 00:42:17.417, Speaker B: Okay.
00:42:17.441 - 00:42:48.937, Speaker A: The other side does it too, you know, like changing, like ballot harvesting. One side learns it, the other side will learn it too. There's been this co evolution for more than 100 years and both machines got really, really strong. One aspect of which was like figuring out voter rolls of, you know, like really. So you can do really targeted, you know, door knocking and stuff like that. But Trump broke the Republican machine in 2016. Like, the Republican machine as of 2016 was the neocon machine.
00:42:48.937 - 00:43:18.777, Speaker A: Yeah, it was the machine controlled by the Bush family and, you know, Dick Cheney and, you know, but like, candidly, people like the Koch brothers, who. I actually respect the Koch brothers a lot and I think that they have been kind of. I do not respect Dick Cheney, but I do respect the Koch brothers. I think there's a lot of nuance here, but basically it was a neocon machine. Trump broke the machine. That Republican machine hated Trump and did not want him to win.
00:43:18.841 - 00:43:19.585, Speaker B: Still do.
00:43:19.745 - 00:43:43.425, Speaker A: Still do. They absolutely hate him. And that's why you see Dick Cheney supporting Harris. But Trump didn't inherit the RNC machine. He's building his own machine. And so right now you have this big, like, you know, disparity between the power and sophistication of the DNC machine versus the RNC machine. I think Trump's machine is kind of where the machines were in the 90s.
00:43:43.425 - 00:43:47.717, Speaker A: And, you know, because he sees where they are, he'll get there fast in the next four to eight years.
00:43:47.781 - 00:44:23.105, Speaker B: Problem with it, it has been built in lots of ways, right, on this angry grievance, grievance, first MAGA and just no respect. And so to start your big benefit when you know the world's going to be looking at you because of that 1939 Madison Square Garden Nazi thing, so, you know, the world's looking at you and to start with, the most racist command medium you could find is just tone deaf at best and really sinister at worst.
00:44:23.805 - 00:44:33.637, Speaker A: Look, so let me just finish the bigger point and then I'll respond to that point. And just so the punchline of what I was saying is like, I, you're.
00:44:33.661 - 00:44:34.533, Speaker B: For breaking the system.
00:44:34.589 - 00:44:52.845, Speaker A: I'm for breaking the system and having just like smaller, less sophisticated machines. And honestly, at that point I want to change the rules. Like I want to, I want to add in campaign finance rules to like take the big money out of politics. I want to have one day elections in person with paper ballot and id.
00:44:52.965 - 00:45:10.277, Speaker B: That was the coach, by the way, who. Right? I mean, like the coats, like I have such, like, I like Chase Koch, I think they do a lot of great stuff. But it's so interesting, right? The Supreme Court decision to allow unlimited money into politics is in some ways the root of so much of this.
00:45:10.421 - 00:45:53.837, Speaker A: I agree. I think if you remove the big money and if you have like one day elections, so many of these other things just become irrelevant, like these state court battles of, you know, who's on the voter roll and all that, like, it all just goes away and everyone will just trust elections. I don't think it's. I think the Democrats benefit so much more than the Republicans by the current system because they're further along. So I don't think they have the incentives to go break that machine. I think for Trump and the Republicans, they're so far behind that it's better for them to just like, reset the machine, pass some simplifying, clarifying rules. And for me, like, these are, these are actually some of my top issues.
00:45:53.837 - 00:46:10.457, Speaker A: I think that you can kind of put it under the bucket of like, kind of resetting democracy, protecting democracy, and whatever rhetoric you hear from the individual candidates. Whatever you hear, like, sure, I'm with you. I hate the anger, but I just, like, I really care about resetting democracy.
00:46:10.601 - 00:46:12.633, Speaker C: Well, let me jump in.
00:46:12.809 - 00:46:14.641, Speaker B: Let me, let me say two things real quick.
00:46:14.673 - 00:46:15.137, Speaker C: All right, go ahead.
00:46:15.161 - 00:46:33.005, Speaker B: Noah A. I agree. Like open primaries. We should only have open primaries. It just shifts everything to the center or ranked choice voting even helps a little bit. We've been funding a lot of that stuff. But my, my biggest fear, you know, I got a call from David Tepper a little while ago.
00:46:33.005 - 00:47:02.623, Speaker B: He's one of the world's great macro investors and was not happy with either candidate. Not happy as a light way of saying it, but he really wanted to participate. And so he said, I'm worried that people aren't going to accept the, you know, the results of the election. And so how do we focus on that in the swing states? And so he put a bunch of money and had me and, and then someone on the right, he wanted someone on the left, someone on the right and himself, just so it wasn't one person.
00:47:02.799 - 00:47:05.319, Speaker C: That's what this show is as well. Just pointing that out.
00:47:05.447 - 00:47:41.139, Speaker B: He put the bulk of the money in, but it still cost me a pretty penny. And the idea was to get ex state officials who were Trumpers, a few never Trumpers, Republicans and a few Democrats, all respected state officials in those swing states, to go on a press tour before the election, say, guys, I know what you think the last election was fair. We're going to monitor, to monitor the election, say it was fair, and afterwards come out and say, guys, these are fair. And so, like, it's crazy that private citizens are spending $20 million just to try to convince people it's fair. But let me give you the polling.
00:47:41.307 - 00:48:04.405, Speaker A: No, this is. So I have to jump in on this. I'm going to say again, I'm going to absolutely stick my neck out and get it chopped off by whoever wins this or Lisa Paris wins. Like, this will not go well for me. Hillary Clinton after the 2016 election said for the last eight years that the 2016 election was stolen, that it wasn't fair. I agree with her. I think she was right.
00:48:04.405 - 00:48:32.155, Speaker A: I think if you look at the amount of what we know as public meddling in that election, it is insane. I think the election was stolen from Hillary in 2020. I honestly think the election was stolen from Trump. I'm sorry to say, but we have, I used to work in really advanced cybersecurity. I, I really believe that both of those elections were not secure. And I just don't think it's, I don't think it's possible to know what actually happened either. I'm going to say the unpopular thing.
00:48:32.155 - 00:49:10.609, Speaker A: I don't think this election, it's ever going to be knowable of exactly what their results were and exactly what the influence was. That said, no matter who wins, my goal is that we have to just accept the results. But on the back of it, my goal is that we change the rules to make it so that 2028 is fair. I don't care who wins. I want 2028 to be a simple, like go Taiwan style. We have to accept that these are adversarial elections where there's a lot to gain, you know, for, for adversaries and just go to a very simple election. And I'm sorry to say this is, you're not supposed to say this.
00:49:10.609 - 00:49:15.689, Speaker A: You get canceled for saying this, but I think, I think that's the truth.
00:49:15.817 - 00:49:55.295, Speaker B: Well, it's interesting, I was with the, the Secretary of State, the woman in charge of elections in Michigan. She's also in charge of the dmv. And in Michigan you need a driver's license to vote. There are 12,000 people that have either reserve, like, you know, the Indian reserve reservation licenses, and there are a few people that are, have two written signatures because of some small exemption, but the broad population, driver's license to vote. And she was, she was thinking this could be with a 10,000 vote error. And she was like, there's almost nothing I can do to convince people this is going to be fair. So we polled.
00:49:55.295 - 00:50:08.769, Speaker B: Only 65% of Democrats in these swing states think the election is going to be fair. In Republicans, it's like 11%. So you have such a bias already that's been seeded by.
00:50:08.857 - 00:50:11.365, Speaker A: Let's get back to crypto. I see Robert's face.
00:50:11.705 - 00:50:23.945, Speaker C: Well, I mean, we can go back to crypto just on this exact topic. I mean, just as a left field idea that's been discussed in our industry for a long time. Is there any plausible path for blockchain based voting to help solve some of these problems?
00:50:24.025 - 00:50:57.113, Speaker B: So Jeff Bezos gave out $100 million grants to a bunch of potential activists and Van Jones got one. Van Jones, the ex, CNN Guy who's a very smart guy. And he called, he said, I'm thinking about doing blockchain based voting with my Hyundai. And I was like, let's start on American Idol. You've got to get people to trust. If blockchains are trust machines, you've got to get the masses to trust the trust machine. And in some ways I think we have more segue.
00:50:57.113 - 00:51:20.815, Speaker B: I thought about this this morning. I hate mail in voting because it just creates uncertainty. I would rather have us all. We already given up a lot of our privacy. You know, you walk to an airport, now they've got your facial recognition. You don't even have to show them your passport. And like, you should be able to go to a booth.
00:51:20.815 - 00:52:00.517, Speaker B: And I should be able to vote in California from New York because it's the same nationwide system. And where do I live? I put my ID in it pulls up my ballot, I vote, I hit it. It authenticates me either, you know, through a thumbprint or a facial recognition or my ID does it. And you know, we have a national holiday and lots of polling stations, or maybe you have three days to vote. But instead, every single county, every single state has a different system, different machines, different. And it just creates just this unbelievable uncertainty. I mean, New York is, it's crazy New York to vote.
00:52:00.517 - 00:52:05.685, Speaker B: You go, there's paper everywhere. You don't have an id. You're like, it makes no sense, Robert.
00:52:05.765 - 00:52:19.819, Speaker A: I think that there's absolutely the opportunity for it, and I don't think it'll happen in 2028, but I think, I think the soonest it could happen is 2032. And I think it would be a huge step forward. It'd be incredible for trust if there was like a Zeke Zero knowledge.
00:52:19.907 - 00:52:22.651, Speaker B: Yeah, you gotta, you gotta have the zero knowledge identity thing.
00:52:22.723 - 00:52:27.059, Speaker C: Agreed. You have to use the new technologies that are still sort of being developed.
00:52:27.107 - 00:52:29.067, Speaker A: Yeah. And just, just to be able to.
00:52:29.091 - 00:52:32.227, Speaker B: See American Idol where people then can learn, hey, this works.
00:52:32.371 - 00:53:11.431, Speaker A: Yeah. But just to be able to see like a ledger, anyone can see it and see the total number of votes and like see how many per the things that would be public or like the age of the person, which candidate they voted for, the county they're in like timestamp of when they voted, the things that, you know, their name would not be public or whatever, except for like anyone with, you know, decryption key or whatever that. But like that's not going to happen anytime soon. I think in the near term it's just paper ballots in person with I.D. but eventually, I love the purple thumb.
00:53:11.503 - 00:53:14.311, Speaker B: That people, you know. Yeah.
00:53:14.463 - 00:53:41.295, Speaker C: All right, well, we have a couple minutes left. Let's go to the lightning round for second and try to get out, like, the biggest topics that we can. This is the first election where there's been the discussion of a crypto political machine, a crypto voting bloc, however you want to refer to it. You know, from what you've seen so far, you know, starting Sean the Novo, like, do you think this has had a material impact in the presidential race at all, or do you think it's limited to House and Senate candidates?
00:53:41.875 - 00:54:08.841, Speaker A: I think the PAC has had a big influence in House and Senate candidates. Not in the presidential race directly, but I think the crypto community has had a big influence of just like trying to educate both Trump and Harris teams and kind of bring them in. So it's like less. I think crypto is a big issue here, but I think it was less the PAC that had the influence on the presidential race than kind of individuals, people like Nova.
00:54:08.953 - 00:54:47.959, Speaker B: Just as a data point, I helped put together a roundtable with six world class crypto founders and people with the Harris team. And they were like, dude, this is our seventh crypto meeting. And I was like, I'm not sure there's seven meetings of people to be speaking to. There is such a desire on our industry to be heard. And certainly if you're a Democrat to say, this can't happen again. The ass hattery of the last four years can happen again. And I know lots of friends have never voted Republican that are voting because they say, I just can't take it.
00:54:47.959 - 00:55:50.965, Speaker B: Like, what happened to us was unfair as an industry. And it's not all like, listen, the industry did a lot of stupid shit and completely unregulated was probably not the right answer either as we saw so many people get scammed out of stuff. But so I do think it's in the psyche, I think, quite frankly, Trump going to Nashville, you know, Harris gets appointed right after that. And there was non stop crypto for the first week. Should I go to this other conference? Should I go to Nashville? Like, it was in their head. I would tell you that as a guy who sits relatively close, it's certainly in the, you know, Sherrod Brown's race watch, you know, if Sherritt loses that, I don't think it's good for crypto. Quite frank, because the narrative will be these guys took out, took out a guy who ran a, you know, ran a committee, and there'll be like an anger Response, you know, Katie Porter didn't know what hit her.
00:55:50.965 - 00:56:01.675, Speaker B: She got taken out in California, you know, and, and if she ends up getting a role in the, the Harris administration, if there is one, she's not going to be a friend of crypto.
00:56:03.335 - 00:56:04.183, Speaker C: Those are good insights.
00:56:04.239 - 00:56:38.169, Speaker B: It's a two way street. It's how do you get people's ear? And sometimes you got to break glass to get it. And I think the glass got broken this year. And I'm hoping Now that the PACs and the crypto people that are willing to put money to try to change policy do it with the idea that you need. I mean, you're not going to get 60 senators no matter who wins. And so, you know, the budget is approved by Congress, legislation is approved by Congress, and while the President's really important, you need Congress. I've had fundraisers for Republicans this year, never had before.
00:56:38.169 - 00:56:38.857, Speaker B: Yep.
00:56:38.961 - 00:56:57.585, Speaker C: All right, next lightning round question. We have to be relatively quick. Do you think that the Trump family's affiliation with World Liberty Financial and the short, tumultuous journey that it's had so far is helpful to Trump's messages around crypto, or do you think it distracts from it? Starting with you, Nova?
00:56:58.245 - 00:57:14.705, Speaker B: I think it's almost insane that in the middle of a presidential campaign, he's out there pumping up his own crypto. I mean, it lays the definition of insanity, especially when the rules aren't even clear yet. Right. Is the SEC going to go after. I mean, it just seems insane.
00:57:16.225 - 00:57:41.383, Speaker A: Look, to me, my experience with crypto is you kind of the only way to learn is by doing. And I. There are a lot of things I don't like about World Liberty Financial, but I respect the Trump team and family and Trump himself for just like actually going and trying to use this stuff and learn how it works. I really think it's the only way to learn how crypto works.
00:57:41.449 - 00:57:42.419, Speaker B: Does Sequoia Invest?
00:57:42.507 - 00:57:43.135, Speaker A: No.
00:57:44.075 - 00:57:59.387, Speaker C: Okay, final lightning round question. If you had one message to prospective voters about why you think your candidate would be better for crypto in just 30 seconds, what would you say? Starting with you, Sean, I don't think.
00:57:59.411 - 00:58:17.785, Speaker B: My candidate will be better for crypto. I actually think Donald Trump will be better for crypto than Kamala Harris, but I think Kamala Harris will be better for our country and better for. And crypto is going to be just fine. I don't think. I think the pain of the last four years of Biden administration is going no matter who wins.
00:58:19.565 - 00:58:54.969, Speaker A: Look, to answer the question specifically, I think Trump is Clearly better for crypto. He believes in deregulation. He is using crypto, is a big fan of crypto. And I think the Biden Harris administration could not have been more hostile. I think it was like a 10 out of 10, maximum worst case, hostile environment. And so they've just set the bar so low. And I do think Harris would be better, but I think, I just think she will inherit a lot of the same people and policies that we've had with Biden Harris.
00:58:55.137 - 00:59:34.329, Speaker B: You know, Robert, if, if Trump wins, one of the reasons that Harris will have lost is because what Trump's got going for him is he, you know, some of his answers are silly and stupid and. But he gives me an answer where, like this whole idea that Kamala Harris, you know, the Biden Harris administration, she's been in power for three years, hasn't done anything. Her, her honest answer would have been, what are you talking about? I was the vice president. I got put in a corner by Jill Biden, and Joe, I barely had any influence. Don't give me credit for what happened good or what happened bad. I'm running on a new platform. This is my vision.
00:59:34.329 - 00:59:57.057, Speaker B: Like, if she had said that, I think the American people would have said hallelujah. But she was very careful to say how gracious Joe was to drop down. He wasn't gracious. He got forced to drop down, pressured. And quite frankly, he's too old. And Trump will be too old in four years. Well, maybe not, but Biden certainly was too old and 82 is old to be running the biggest country in the world, the richest country in the world.
00:59:57.057 - 01:00:16.863, Speaker B: And so I do think what appeals to people about Trump is they feel that he says what he thinks, and sometimes he can't help but say what he thinks. He says too much. Where that measured platitudes, people are like, come on already. And so we'll see.
01:00:16.959 - 01:00:19.767, Speaker A: Robert, can I say 20 seconds of closing statement? Yes.
01:00:19.791 - 01:00:21.143, Speaker C: This will be the last closing statement.
01:00:21.239 - 01:00:39.535, Speaker A: Yeah. One novo. And Robert, you're both legends and have done a huge amount for crypto. Thank you, truly. Second, whoever wins, I just hope, like, don't retaliate against the other side. Like, let's just try to reset democracy. I think that should be the most important thing coming out of this.
01:00:39.535 - 01:00:56.097, Speaker A: And third point, everything. I don't have a crystal ball. Everything I said was my own personal opinion, not the opinion of my firm. Definitely not invest in advice. And especially if Harris wins and watches this in the future.
01:00:56.161 - 01:01:39.327, Speaker B: Well, my last point, Robert, is somebody is going to win and then the next 60 days are really, really important. And so their transition team, the Republican transition team, is much more organized and up and running because they've had a long time to get there, you know, and so after that election, if you want to have impact, it's people create policy. And it's not just the head of the SEC and the treasury, it's the undersecretaries. It's. There are probably 70 policy positions that will get filled that have an impact on our industry. And so if you've got any influence, weigh in on both sides. And so at Galaxy, we literally have a plan for both teams.
01:01:39.327 - 01:01:52.795, Speaker B: We've got contacts on both sides. Again, I think the Trump team is further along at this point, but that's really where the pudding gets. What do you putting gets made? I don't know.
01:01:52.955 - 01:02:16.835, Speaker C: The pudding gets made. Well, we'll have to revisit this, you know, after the election, see who wins, see how the transition goes, and then see if our predictions have come true. But Sean and Novo, thank you both for being a part of this show. Thank you for being willing to debate the pros and cons of each candidate. And we'll find out the outcome in just a couple short days, hopefully. Yeah, hopefully we find out the outcome in the next couple.
01:02:16.875 - 01:02:24.819, Speaker B: So Democrats and crypto are hedged because if you lose the election, your bag still goes up, right?
01:02:24.987 - 01:02:26.975, Speaker A: I am not long. I'm levered long.
01:02:27.555 - 01:02:28.171, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:02:28.283 - 01:02:28.979, Speaker C: Texas hedge.
01:02:29.027 - 01:02:29.691, Speaker B: Good luck, guys.
01:02:29.763 - 01:02:30.739, Speaker C: All right, thanks, guys.
01:02:30.867 - 01:02:32.395, Speaker B: Thanks so much. You too, Robert.
