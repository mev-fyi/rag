00:00:45.390 - 00:00:50.746, Speaker A: Today's guest is Jacob Franick, co founder and COO of Coimetrics. Welcome, Jacob.
00:00:50.858 - 00:00:52.846, Speaker C: Hi Laura. Thanks for having me.
00:00:53.028 - 00:00:59.840, Speaker A: Daily transaction fees on Ethereum are overtaking those on bitcoin. What exactly are we seeing there?
00:01:00.610 - 00:01:32.140, Speaker C: Yeah, it's a great question. So on September 15 we saw the kind of total daily fees on Ethereum surpass bitcoin and we wrote about this in our newsletter. I want to give a shout out to Nate Madri, who's our head of research and our newsletter team. But it's important for us to kind of clarify what we mean by daily fees. So here we're talking about the cumulative sum of all of the fees across all transactions in the day. And that's important to distinguish between kind of the individual or mean fee per transaction. That's something we'll talk a little bit about later.
00:01:32.140 - 00:02:15.506, Speaker C: But fees are important because they're kind of an indicator of overall usage and demand. So the higher demand for something, the more people are willing to pay for something. And fees kind of combine two important metrics. So they combine the transaction count and the fee per transaction. And so it gives you a nice kind of holistic measure of demand and allows you to get a sense of kind of overall usage of these different chains. Now, this is actually not the first time that fees on Ethereum have surpassed fees on bitcoin for a few months in 2018, actually, this was the case for most of that period, actually. But I think what happened in 2019 is we saw a large separation between bitcoin where fees really surpassed Ethereum.
00:02:15.506 - 00:02:31.840, Speaker C: And then only recently has there been a sharp decline in fees on bitcoin and a sharp rise on Ethereum. And I think maybe that has led to the community kind of noticing this and starting to talk about it on Twitter. And there's a lot of kind of potential interesting reasons for that.
00:02:32.770 - 00:02:48.820, Speaker A: Before we go into those reasons, I'm just curious, you said that this is a number that represents both total number of transactions as well as the amount of the fees. So is it both that are rising or is like one of them really kind of the main cause for this?
00:02:49.430 - 00:03:30.602, Speaker C: Yeah, it's a great question. Fees themselves, the actual price or the fee per transaction is somewhat set by the market, right? And that really depends on market conditions. It depends on really whether the chain's full and kind of some of those dynamics. I think what's driving it is probably more so the transaction counts in this case. And in particular what we've seen is the rise of Tether, the meteoric rise of Tether on Ethereum, and somewhat the decline of tether on Omni. And so Omni is this kind of second or separate layer protocol that's actually built on top of bitcoin. And every transaction on Omni is actually a transaction on bitcoin.
00:03:30.602 - 00:04:12.190, Speaker C: And we've seen just over the last month or so a kind of sharp decline in the transactions on Omni of Tether. Tether is this stablecoin and we've seen a real meteoric rise going back to April of this year on Ethereum to the point where transactions of tether on Ethereum are now 25% of all transactions on the Ethereum network. And at a time tether was about 15% or more of the transactions on the bitcoin network. And so that shift of tether from Bitcoin or Omni to Ethereum has kind of probably been partly the cause of this difference in fees.
00:04:12.530 - 00:04:26.370, Speaker A: And is it that the number of tether transactions. So just to be clear, there's basically now two versions of tether one that is on this Omni layer of the bitcoin network and one that is on Ethereum.
00:04:26.710 - 00:05:06.670, Speaker C: Yeah, there's actually more. There's actually a version on EOS, there's a version on Tron and I believe there's a version on Algorand. There's also a Euro version that is on Omni and I think launching on Ethereum has already launched. So there's a few different versions. The Ethereum version actually launched in 2017, but basically was flat for almost two years. And it's unclear why or what has led to this kind of shift, but it all of a sudden woke up in April of 2019 and has just been exponentially increasing ever since. Whereas you've seen a reduction in transactions on the bitcoin network or on Omni, there may be a few different reasons for that.
00:05:06.670 - 00:05:33.560, Speaker C: Some think that it's due to quicker kind of fewer confirmation times and so traders that are performing Arbitrage might prefer it. Tether on Ethereum is also an ERC 20 token. And so there's a lot of kind of network effects and just good infrastructure, wallet infrastructure, the option to interact with other smart contracts and other kind of D five potential applications that might be part of it as well. It's not entirely clear to me why that rise has happened.
00:05:34.010 - 00:06:10.834, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, the thing is, the block size on Ethereum has always been shorter. So I don't understand why suddenly in April people would be like, whoa, the block times on Ethereum are so much shorter. Do you know what I mean? In April? I don't understand how that would be connected anyway. Okay, so I wonder I'm just blanking on when the news came out about the New York attorney general's charges against tether. Do you know if that I think that was later, wasn't it?
00:06:10.952 - 00:06:40.762, Speaker C: Yeah, that's a great was. I don't have the date in front of me. I think it was after April. And I think your question is a good one in the sense why? Why then? And I don't have a great answer to it other than the few things that I've suggested. The fees on Ethereum are also the individual fees to transact are also lower. So it's possible that certain high frequency traders or others that kind of make a lot of trades and the individual fee cost is important for them. That might have started it too.
00:06:40.762 - 00:06:46.640, Speaker C: But why it was so dramatic and came out of nowhere is really hard to explain, at least for me at the moment.
00:06:48.770 - 00:07:48.206, Speaker A: Yeah, because the other thing that you suggested about the DeFi movement is that's been around for a while too. I mean, granted, obviously it's been super small and so maybe it was just in April when kind of a critical mass heard about it. Granted, that is relatively new. It's not like brand new or it wasn't brand new in April, but it was relatively new then. Okay, all right, well, maybe if I kind of suss out what the cause is in another episode, I'll try to explain that. So one other thing is that I noticed in the analysis you guys released that the usage of gas on Ethereum traditionally has been for, like, Ether transactions, tether, ERC 20 and then ERC 721, which ERC 20 is like the different tokens on Ethereum. ERC 721 is the non fungible tokens.
00:07:48.206 - 00:08:04.658, Speaker A: But those transactions have actually declined compared to the demand for gas for other types of contracts. And you guys have this great little graphic showing that. But I didn't know when you say other types of contracts, what's an example of some of those other kinds of contracts?
00:08:04.834 - 00:08:51.938, Speaker C: Yeah, so great question. And what we've seen basically is a large increase. And if you look actually across the whole history of Ethereum and you look at kind of the gas used per transaction, what you see is just a steady rise up and to the right, which is indicating that transactions on Ethereum are getting more complex. Essentially, they're requiring more gas per transaction. And so a very simple operation on the Ethereum virtual machine like sending Ether to and from a certain wallet has a low cost. But as you start to interact with more complex contracts, those have a larger gas costs and depending on the gas market, will tend to have higher fees. And so I think part of this is due specifically to the rise in DeFi or other applications.
00:08:51.938 - 00:09:28.210, Speaker C: There's also gambling applications and you kind of see a lot of these interesting, I don't want to necessarily call them Ponzi applications, but sometimes they very much look like that that have more complex contracts and that require more gas in general. It's hard to say. I haven't kind of done a deep dive into exactly which contracts are rising in that kind of other non, ERC, non, ERC, 20, ERC, 721 bucket, but I suspect it's largely due to the rise in DFI and just more complicated contracts, things like MakerDAO and synthetics and a lot of these other kind of interesting applications.
00:09:28.950 - 00:10:07.534, Speaker A: And one thing I also wanted to ask was obviously when you look at this graphic, which I'll try to put in the show notes of the transactions on bitcoin versus the transaction fees on bitcoin versus Ethereum, it really feels like it's more about the dramatic drop in daily transaction fees on bitcoin rather than it is. I mean, you can see that there is this very kind of slow and gradual rise on Ethereum. But I wondered, is part of the drop on bitcoin because there are more transactions migrating to L2, do you know what I'm saying, that we can't see?
00:10:07.732 - 00:10:52.702, Speaker C: Yeah, it could be a part of that. I mean, my understanding of Lightning is that the growth has been a little bit small. It is hard to tell because it is somewhat private and if you're not running a node, you can't necessarily observe what's happening on the network. I think if you look at the graph, though, of bitcoin fees, again, total daily fees, and you look at tether transactions, the two actually follow one another quite closely. And really in the last several months or so, you can see kind of this steady decline of tether transactions that seem to coincide with the decline in fees. So bitcoin has also increased its batching. So you can actually batch transactions and include more transfers per transaction and you actually save a little bit on fees in that way as well.
00:10:52.702 - 00:11:33.386, Speaker C: So it could be a few things coming together. Tether, it could be things moving to Lightning, it could be more particularly exchanges are batching, which is reducing the overall fees, and then you are seeing a little bit of a rise in fees on Ethereum as well. And so those two things coinciding could be resulting in what we're seeing now. The big question is whether this is going to continue. And is this just a blip? It's already kind of reverted. So bitcoin over the last few days is doing more in daily fees than Ethereum. But what's interesting is, on Ethereum, the miners have now been voting up the gas limit and so effectively increasing Ethereum's block size by something like 12%.
00:11:33.386 - 00:12:16.440, Speaker C: And Ethereum is a little bit different from bitcoin in that it has a dynamic limit. The gas limit sets the per block, sets the kind of block size. It's not fixed byte size as it is on bitcoin. And so miners can actually dynamically incrementally in small steps, increase the block size by voting up the gas limit. And so if they're doing that because the demand has been at the ceiling kind of for a while it's possible that this trend will continue, and if Tether's growth continues as well, soon we might get to a point where Ethereum is kind of continuously above Bitcoin. And at that point, who knows, maybe Tether will continue to migrate more and more to EOS or some of these other chains, but all of that kind of remains to be seen.
00:12:16.810 - 00:12:24.922, Speaker A: All right, so we're going to discuss a little bit more on this topic as well as some of the differences in the various bitcoin forks. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible.
00:12:25.056 - 00:13:20.170, Speaker B: Will the world follow France and advocate banning privacy coins? Will government backed stablecoins become the new fiat are distributed and peer to peer exchanges just a flash in the pan? The answer is maybe. Virtual currencies can flourish and create a new private and more versatile economy. But that grand vision can't happen without keeping crypto clean, and that requires support of governments and accountability for bad actors. Privacy enhanced compliance using cryptographic controls has the potential to preserve anonymity without compromising legitimate investigations. CipherTrace is working on this vision of the future.

00:13:20.320 - 00:13:47.430, Speaker A: Back to my conversation with Jacob Franek. So one other thing that I was wondering about know bitcoin versus Ethereum daily transaction fees, does the fullness of either chain affect the meaning, like, are these numbers less of a proxy of demand on both chains? If the fullness of the blocks on either chain is sort of preventing us from seeing how much demand there really is or would be without that limit?
00:13:47.930 - 00:14:42.706, Speaker C: Yeah. So the fullness of the chains really impacts both the transaction count and the price, right? And so as blocks become full, the demand for block space becomes higher and people start to raise the fees in order to get their transactions through. Ethereum in general processes at the moment, about more than twice the number of transactions per day than Bitcoin. So even though the cost is a little bit lower, like the cost per transaction, right now, at least the fee is a little bit lower. Just by the simple fact that it's processing so many more transactions, the fees are a little bit higher, but as that becomes full, definitely the fees are going to start to go up again. And so for Bitcoin, it's probably going to be correlated with the decline in Tether. It's probably going to be correlated more with price and perhaps the next bull market you're going to start to see again, fees starting to rise dramatically.
00:14:42.706 - 00:14:56.438, Speaker C: It just depends really, on demand and what levers are being pulled there. I know there's also vera block transactions that are starting to fill up the Bitcoin chain. And so there's other things that might start to compete for block space that could result in more fees.
00:14:56.614 - 00:15:06.720, Speaker A: Okay, so that's actually the perfect segue to our next discussion about the different forks. Can you just describe what vera block is?
00:15:07.170 - 00:15:21.220, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm actually not super familiar with vera block, and I know that it's a way of kind of finalizing things from another chain or storing data. I unfortunately haven't spent myself personally too much time digging into it, so I don't have a great answer for you.
00:15:22.070 - 00:15:31.030, Speaker A: Well, so you guys did do this analysis on bitcoin and the various forks. What factors did you guys look at and what were your findings?
00:15:31.370 - 00:16:35.930, Speaker C: Yeah, so coimetrics wrote a research piece about bitcoin cash versus bitcoin, SV versus bitcoin. And the genesis of this was actually a legacy asset manager who wanted to enter into a position into bitcoin, and they were having some internal debates about which bitcoin to enter in. And some of your listeners might think that's kind of silly or that it should be obvious, but obviously if you're entering into the space fairly nascent or you haven't been in the space a long time, it can be a little bit confusing. And what's important to kind of tease this out was trying to identify what the value proposition of these different coins were and then how did that relate to things that we were seeing on chain. And so bitcoin cash forked from bitcoin as part of a block size debate. And proponents of bitcoin cash believed that bitcoin was increasingly becoming a store of value and not a medium of exchange, the latter of which they thought was kind of more aligned with the original purpose of bitcoin. So BCH forked, bitcoin cash or BCH forked and increased the block size from one megabytes to 32.
00:16:35.930 - 00:17:33.680, Speaker C: And then BSV later forked from BCH. So bitcoin SV satoshi's vision later forked from bitcoin cash and further increased the block size to 128 megabytes and then also reduce the restrictions on storing data so that you could store kind of more data on the chain itself. And I think the quote was to unshackle the data storage use case. So this was kind of the pretense that we entered into this research piece, trying to understand, okay, these are the different value propositions, and then how does that actually align with what we see on chain? And in order to do that, we looked at kind of three different analyses. So one was what we called a medium of exchange analysis to look at transactions fees, transfer volume, see these different indicators that would look at whether these coins were being used more as a store of value or more as a medium of exchange. We also looked at the block size, and then finally we looked at a security analysis, looking at hash rate, minor revenue, and a few other things.
00:17:34.370 - 00:17:38.720, Speaker A: And so what did you find in terms of how they are being used?
00:17:39.410 - 00:18:14.406, Speaker C: Yeah, so starting with the kind of medium of exchange analysis, we saw that fees are indeed lower on bitcoin cash and bitcoin SV. Right? So they wanted to increase the block size, and by increasing the block size, you increase the throughput and potentially lower fees. Right, so we did see that. In fact, I think the median fee was almost zero on both bitcoin cash and bitcoin SV. But really that was driven just because of by little usage of either chain. So there was far fewer transactions on both chains compared to bitcoin. There was far fewer active addresses and a lower overall transfer volume.
00:18:14.406 - 00:19:11.094, Speaker C: And interestingly, bitcoin SV was predominantly being used as a way to record data on chain. So something like 94% plus of all transactions contained an op return code, which is essentially the way of just storing data on the chain and not actually doing anything economic. So not actually transferring units of bitcoin SV. And a majority of those 94%, so 94% of them are being used to store data only, and a majority of those were coming from a single weather application. So a single weather app was storing weather data on chain. And so when we wrote this piece, we kind of tweeted that out and the community kind of took that and ran with it and thought it was pretty interesting because that's something that just doesn't come out when you're just looking at kind of raw transaction counts. And so there is a potential that with bigger blocks and lower fees, that bitcoin cash and bitcoin SV could be used more as a medium of exchange.
00:19:11.094 - 00:19:16.080, Speaker C: But we just aren't seeing it yet today. I mean, there's far fewer transactions and so on.
00:19:17.170 - 00:19:20.590, Speaker A: What is the purpose of putting weather data on BSV?
00:19:21.410 - 00:19:57.740, Speaker C: Yeah, my sense is just to enter it into an immutable blockchain. I'm not too familiar with the kind of value proposition of this application. I guess the idea is to have an immutable record of weather data and potentially somehow sell that through the block. I'm not exactly sure how the business model of that would work. I don't know if there's an issue with fake weather or climate data, so I'm not sure what was the genesis. I don't know if this was just kind of testing it. I personally haven't dug too much into it, but I think the idea was just to have it on an immutable record so that there was a historical record of the weather for that day.
00:19:58.350 - 00:20:18.420, Speaker A: Well, vitalik, Buterin the creator of Ethereum also, I think he tweet I can't remember he might have tweeted that he thought maybe a bitcoin cash and BSV should be used as data storage for other blockchains. Does it look like it's kind of already happening or no. Is it really just this one app?
00:20:18.790 - 00:20:59.774, Speaker C: Yeah, I don't think there's too much evidence of other blockchains yet storing data on bitcoin or so on. I believe actually that's somewhat what Vera block is doing in terms of kind of storing hashes from another chain and using bitcoin security, but we haven't really seen that across other chains. I think it's an interesting idea. I mean obviously there's only so much block space, there's only so much information that you can store on Bitcoin or so on. And so some other chains might look to store maybe hashed or other kind of condensed versions of information on these kind of more secure chains. I think it's an interesting idea. I just am not sure what the demand for the market is.
00:20:59.774 - 00:21:24.630, Speaker C: I'm still somewhat a money maximalist in the sense that for me the most interesting thing about public blockchain so far is the money and kind of related applications. So I'm not sure there's a strong use case yet out there. But Vitalik's floated kind of different ideas like diplomas and things like that, storing kind of those kind of immutable records where having a permanent record of something on chain might be useful.
00:21:25.450 - 00:21:48.062, Speaker A: But if you do that, how does that affect the crypto economics? Will the chain be secure enough? Is it really? Then just the miners earn their block reward? I'm just wondering, will the value of the coin be enough that the whole thing will work out and the chain will be secure? Do you see what I'm saying?
00:21:48.116 - 00:22:48.002, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean that's one of the long term questions and that's. I think one of the things that led to Bitcoin SV forking from bitcoin cash was this idea that they wanted to store additional information on chain things like invoices and things that are probably part of an economic transaction. But what we're seeing is even non economical things being stored on the chain. And to your point, is that really going to be enough to confer it value and help keep the chain secure? And in fact, when we looked at our kind of security analysis, bitcoin's hash rate dominates that of Bitcoin SV and Bitcoin cash. And in fact when Bitcoin SV forked from Bitcoin cash it effectively split its hash rate in half and weakened it even further. Hash rates one thing and then you look at the overall minor revenue and similarly bitcoin kind of dominates both of those. Now obviously all of that is driven to some degree by demand and so it's possible that this will change in the future.
00:22:48.002 - 00:23:18.650, Speaker C: But you can imagine if bitcoin is paying for its security through minor revenue, many multiples more than these other chains, it's just going to attract a larger market of hash rate. And so it's going to be quite challenging for these other chains without having a kind of clear use case or clear demand to compete long term because the hash rate is just. So the value of what you can earn on those chains as a miner is just so much smaller.
00:23:19.870 - 00:23:27.870, Speaker A: And last quick question before we hop off, but I was just curious, does it look to you like either of these chains will ever be used as a medium of exchange?
00:23:28.610 - 00:24:12.394, Speaker C: Yeah, it's a great question. I mean, I think it's still the jury's out. It's still quite a bit early. Right? So these forks have only happened recently, but I'm somewhat of a store of value maximalist myself in the sense that people have to accept a currency, right? For a currency to be used as a medium of exchange, somebody else has to want to keep it, right? Has to want to hold it. And so it's hard in my mind to have a chain or have an asset become valuable if its only use cases is a medium of exchange. And if you look back over monetary history, these things kind of evolve in different ways. But typically there's something that drives the kind of people wanting to hold it, right.
00:24:12.394 - 00:24:41.382, Speaker C: Something intrinsic to the asset has to be there in order for there to be enough demand for somebody else to accept it. And that's kind of where you lean a little bit more on the store of value use case first. I think it's interesting. There's a lot of different models. Grin is trying to be highly inflationary and trying to win that kind of medium of exchange use case. I'm just not convinced without a strong intrinsic or set of strong intrinsic properties that there's enough impetus there for someone else to want to accept it. But it still is early.
00:24:41.382 - 00:24:55.880, Speaker C: And perhaps that some of these data storage kind of use cases or applications might find we might find a niche or that killer app might emerge. I'm a little skeptical, but I think it's a little too hard to say at this time.
00:24:56.730 - 00:25:03.150, Speaker A: Yeah, well, as we always say, it's still early days. All right, well, thank you so much for coming on the show.
