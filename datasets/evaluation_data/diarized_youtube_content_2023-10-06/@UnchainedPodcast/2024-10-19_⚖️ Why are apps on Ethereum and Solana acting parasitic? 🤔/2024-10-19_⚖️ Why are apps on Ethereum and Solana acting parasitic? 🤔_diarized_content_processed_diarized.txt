00:00:00.320 - 00:00:35.945, Speaker A: Even if all the apps stay on the L1, all the apps are still trying to figure out even if I am on a shared chain, how do I keep all the RF for myself? Like they're all increasingly doing this of okay, even if I'm on Solana, even if I'm on Ethereum, how do I run some sort of off chain auction or enforce some different ordering rule where I make sure that none of this RV is leaking to the L1 anymore? Because like I'm bringing all the users, I should get all of it as the application. And so that means applications on a shared L1 are parasitic in the exact same way as L2 is harder and L1 it's everyone is incentivized to keep that kind of value for themselves. And who has the strongest position with the users and the pricing power at the end of the day is going to be the applications who are bringing all those users.
