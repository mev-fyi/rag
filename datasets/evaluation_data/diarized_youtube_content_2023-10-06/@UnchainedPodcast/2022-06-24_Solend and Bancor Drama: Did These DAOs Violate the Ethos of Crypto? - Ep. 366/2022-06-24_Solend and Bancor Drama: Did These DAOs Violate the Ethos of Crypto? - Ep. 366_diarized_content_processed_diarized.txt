00:01:12.718 - 00:01:16.210, Speaker A: Thanks, Laura. It's a pleasure to be on this week.
00:01:16.280 - 00:01:35.500, Speaker B: There were two major incidents involving Dows that had a lot of people in crypto casting judgment on these supposedly decentralized organizations. The first one involved Soland, which is a lending and borrowing protocol on Solana. Tell us what situation prompted this first controversial proposal from them.
00:01:36.270 - 00:02:19.158, Speaker A: Yeah, so to give some context on Soland, it's a lending and borrowing platform built on Solana. Users can deposit any form of collateral and borrow other assets. In this particular case, a very large whale had about 100 million. I think the exact number is 108,000,000 in salana tokens that he deposited into Soland, and he used that as collateral to borrow stablecoins like USDC and Tether. And over the past two, three weeks, obviously, the crypto markets have been volatile. Salana token has gone down in price, and the loan was getting pretty close to the liquidation price.
00:02:19.324 - 00:02:28.870, Speaker B: Yeah. And actually, just a correction, they had deposited $170,000,000 worth of Sol. But you're right, they borrowed $108,000,000 worth of USDC and USDT.
00:02:29.030 - 00:03:07.400, Speaker A: Yeah, the loan price was getting pretty close to liquidation. And if that actually happened, there would have been a few cascading negative effects, which we can go into. The Solen team tried to contact the whale and alert him because there was no updating the account, there was no additional collateral being deposited. And yeah, that's really the context. And I think the governance stuff and the proposals that happened were sort of all based off of this one dangerous loan that had the potential to become quite toxic both to Soland and to Salana itself.
00:03:07.710 - 00:03:19.740, Speaker B: Yeah. And it was also 25% of TVL on Soland, which obviously is pretty significant. So how did Soland propose to handle this situation?
00:03:20.450 - 00:04:34.210, Speaker A: Yeah, so the first proposal that they released was to really take unilateral control of the whales account. Doing this would allow them to execute the liquidation in a much more streamlined and organized manner. So normally the liquidations are done, 20% of the collateral is just basically market sold, and this would have negative effects on both the price impact, right, like execution price for that larger chunk. It's never easy and it would also just negatively affect the Solano network. A lot of liquidators would have been bidding up fees and potentially, yeah, it was fear that the network could have gone down. So taking control of the whales account was really justified, or at least the proposal to take control was justified through they could execute the sale through OTC desks, do it in a more organized and less dangerous manner. The reasoning was that this was better both for the solen protocol, its users, and for just the Salana ecosystem broadly.
00:04:34.950 - 00:04:56.874, Speaker B: Yeah, and I think I saw somewhere they said that they felt that handling an OTC would cause maybe only 3% slippage compared to something like 46% if it was handled on the decks. Clearly you had a financial motivation to do this, but obviously this proposal sparked an outcry from the wider crypto community. Why was that?
00:04:57.072 - 00:06:05.474, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a good point. And I think anytime a protocol, especially one in the DeFi space, which is supposed to be all about being permissionless and self custody and sort of user autonomy, whenever that philosophy, whenever a protocol wants to go against that philosophy, there's going to be outcrys and there's going to be controversy. And in this case, it was such a large amount of funding and it wasn't like a stopgap solution. It was honestly kind of a nuclear option, like literally taking control of someone else's funds and having unilateral control over it, that is the nuclear option. I think there was just a huge amount of outcry because crypto and DeFi is all about, again, having your own property rights and strong assurances, and if protocols can set precedent to go against that, it's dangerous. So I think there was a lot of headlines about it, there was a lot of controversy and for good reason.
00:06:05.672 - 00:06:56.740, Speaker B: One thing that interested me was earlier when you talked about how Salana has this history of going down quite frequently. I did see that when they were debating this first proposal. The Soland Twitter account tweeted salana has a history of downtime caused by Onchain liquidations like this, but 100 x bigger this time is extremely risky for everyone involved. In the future, on chain OTC auctions should be implemented as the preferred method for liquidating large positions. And I just wondered, do you feel that a similar situation on a different chain, one that didn't have this history of so much or such frequent downtime, do you feel that that protocol might have been spurred to take a similar action? Or do you feel that it really was kind of particular to the issues that Solana has?
00:06:57.510 - 00:08:00.440, Speaker A: It's a good question. I think it'd be unfair to say that the situation could only happen in Solana. I think even on other chains with different consensus mechanisms, whether they're proof of work or proof of stake, these situations are still possible. If there's large liquidations and gas price goes up, that could still be bad for the network. I do think Solana is a little unique in that it's one of the few chains, few major chains that in the last six months does have this sort of repeated history, and at this point, a bit of a negative connotation of going down. So I think, like, Solend and the community and just other Solana holders were sort of more aware of that. So I think it's unfair to say again that this is something that could only happen to Salana, but I think it's like, empirically, it's happened more and it's been a larger risk here.
00:08:01.690 - 00:08:28.880, Speaker B: So the price of Seoul dropped as low as $26.43 on Monday, June 13, which was a week before the proposal. And then on Saturday, it was also at around $27.64. Now it's in the 30s, so it actually hasn't moved close to the liquidation price, which was $22.30. But one day after passing the first governance proposal, the Dow reversed course. What happened there?
00:08:29.410 - 00:09:22.978, Speaker A: Yeah, things moved pretty quickly there. And basically this second proposal, it reversed the first proposal and it canceled the proposed action of taking over the whales account. And, yeah, this was done, I think, as you said, a day after the first proposal. And it definitely brings up some questions about who created these timelines, why did they decide to do it and reverse action so quickly? Obviously, a lot of the pushback, I think, was a big part of that. There's a huge amount of anger and confusion about this proposal. So I think, again, it was the right move. But it's clear that this was seen as quite an existential event.
00:09:22.978 - 00:09:50.970, Speaker A: So prop position one was really the Solan team reacting to being backed into a corner. Prop two is only possible because Salana price, I think, went up a little bit. So the protocol was actually kind of fortunate in terms of timing, because, again, if prop two happened and price was going down, then you wouldn't have avoided the original concern.
00:09:54.750 - 00:10:12.974, Speaker B: Yeah, they are in conversation now with this whale because now they've been tweeting that they're talking to them. So I think the position is kind of slowly being decreased. And then actually, just one quick question. Earlier, when you said that it was the right move, did you mean the first proposal or the second one?
00:10:13.172 - 00:11:01.886, Speaker A: Given the facts and the fact that the price moved, I think proposition to personally, I think that was the right move to not take unilateral control, I think that would have been a very dangerous precedent to set for the protocol. I think it would have opened up a huge can of worms. To be fair, that conversation has already begun. I think once people have know that this is possible, know that this is a step the Protocol can take in the future, it's already kind of too late, but yeah, I think it would have been again the nuclear option to literally take control of the Will's account and economically manage their actions. So I think it's again good for Solen that they didn't end up having to do so.
00:11:02.068 - 00:11:42.218, Speaker B: Yeah, I find it pretty crazy that the first proposal was their first governance proposal ever. And then somebody made a diagram on Twitter of the votes and said that it was one person who accounted for 88% of the yes votes. So it raises a lot of questions kind of about just how decentralized all this was. But in a moment, we're going to talk about a similar controversy involving Bancorp.

00:12:53.990 - 00:13:19.834, Speaker B: Back to my conversation with Derek. So this week, Bancor also put up a controversial proposal. Actually, it wasn't even a proposal, it was a unilateral action and it caused a stir in the crypto community. But before we get into the details on it, let's just explain a key concept which is in Bancor, there's something that the protocol offers which is protection against impermanent loss. What does that mean?
00:13:19.952 - 00:14:09.820, Speaker A: To set the context? Bancor is an on train AMM and just like other AMMS, this concept of impermanent loss occurs for LPs, when the price of tokens in a pool change very drastically, especially compared to one another. So if you have a Bancorp ETH pool and the Bancorp price decreases or increases, like a lot compared to ETH, LPs will suffer from impermanent loss, which means that the amount of funds they actually hold is less than what they actually put in. So that's the basics of il you want to avoid it. And the key here is that it's exacerbated in volatile market conditions when assets change price drastically in a very short period of time.
00:14:10.370 - 00:14:16.560, Speaker B: And Bancorp offered protection against impermanent loss. So how was the protocol doing that?
00:14:17.090 - 00:14:33.026, Speaker A: Yeah, so again, it's a pretty big not problem, but it's just a big trade off of AMM Lping. So Bancorp wanted to attract liquidity and attract LPs by offering them permanent loss protection. Yeah.
00:14:33.048 - 00:14:38.230, Speaker B: And just for people, in case they're not familiar, LP in this context stands for liquidity provider.
00:14:39.050 - 00:15:08.430, Speaker A: Bancorp tried to address this by using Bancorp's own protocol owned liquidity, as well as using a proportion of protocol fees. 15% of trading fees are used to sort of ensure that when users withdraw, if they're suffering from impermanent loss, that they are made whole so that they again are able to know that they won't lose money even in volatile market conditions.
00:15:08.850 - 00:15:19.520, Speaker B: So on Monday, monday again seems to be the day when a lot of these kinds of things happened. Bancorp made their controversial announcement. What did they say?
00:15:19.970 - 00:16:20.178, Speaker A: Yeah, so Bancorp again, they noticed that similar to Solan, there was a few in this case, there was a few large whales that had huge amounts of capital deposited in Bancor and were withdrawing pretty rapidly. And because of the volatility in crypto prices, they suffered huge amounts of Il. And the protocol was having to use huge amounts of token reserves, both in the native Bancorp token and in other revenue that the protocol had accrued to issue and literally distribute to these LPs. And I was looking at some of the dune charts, I think. Yeah. The amount of total Isle of Protection that the protocol had issued in the past, like two days was, I think, almost equivalent to what they had done in the past six months. So this was done in a very short time frame.
00:16:20.178 - 00:16:47.820, Speaker A: And one of the key points here is that a big part of this protection and distribution of assets to make LPs whole happened in the Bancor token. So it wasn't necessarily like issuing completely new Bancorp from scratch, but it was using protocol assets, much of which is Bancor, and sort of increasing the float, increasing the supply, going from there.
00:16:48.430 - 00:17:05.300, Speaker B: The Bancor team said that their motivation for doing this was what they called hostile market conditions. So you talked about how it appears that some entity was selling a lot of this BNT. What more do we know about what was actually happening?
00:17:06.010 - 00:17:51.490, Speaker A: Yeah, I think in the town hall they talked about how this entity was celsius and obviously linked to what was going on with Celsius and Three Arrows. They also talked about how there was a potential short seller that was taking position against the Bancorp token and abetting against it, and that this was somehow affecting the aisle situation as well. Yeah, I think, again, that's right. It's the bancorp protocol team's. Part of the design of this aisle protection is to account for these kinds of situations, is to account for these kinds of black Swan events. I don't even know if you could call them Black Swan. I think they're just volatile markets.
00:17:51.490 - 00:18:06.854, Speaker A: So it's a tough situation, but it's the kind of thing that it's just a good reminder that every protocol design choice, every incentive program you run, it has trade offs. Yeah.
00:18:06.892 - 00:18:52.450, Speaker B: And just to kind of give people context on what was happening to the price of the Bancor token BNT, about two weeks ago, it was trading at around a dollar 30, and then by Saturday it fell to a low of $0.44. As of recording time, it's at about $0.55. So still trading quite a bit lower. But in their blog post, I think the speculation was that these entities were driving down the price of BNT by selling huge amounts of it and had also taken a short position on exchange to profit from the fall in price. So that's at least their theory. I'm not sure if this is confirmed. As far as I could tell, this decision was not made via a governance vote.
00:18:52.450 - 00:18:54.280, Speaker B: So how was it made?
00:18:54.730 - 00:19:51.958, Speaker A: Yeah, so this decision was it appears it was made pretty unilaterally by the Bancorps team. They talked about it via a blog post which contained the details and hosted the town hall about it. They specifically cited a previous BIP Bancorp improvement proposal earlier this spring. And for any listeners, this is BIP 21, which basically talks about how there is a multi SIG and the signers have the ability to basically protect Bancorp in Black Swan events via the ability to disable swaps and pause deposits and basically have control not over user assets, but the actual operating of the AMM.
00:19:52.134 - 00:20:09.066, Speaker B: So overall, what takeaways do you have from these two incidents involving Dows this week and in general, how it is that these so called decentralized protocols should handle aberrant or unexpected events?
00:20:09.258 - 00:21:48.730, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a good question. I think it's difficult to look at these two situations and not feel like Dow governance is really just a word that's been used here and that there isn't really any decentralized governance process and it's really just a few people making decisions and almost retroactively using governance as a sign of approval. I think that's honestly a fair assessment of what's happened. I think there's been some takes on Twitter and by some commentators that this is like sort of it's reflective of the entire Dow governance space, which I don't necessarily think is true. I think the key here is really if you're going to have a token and if you're going to give users rights to vote on and think about certain things, those should be laid out clearly ahead of time and you need to think about in Black Swan events and in risky situations, what the actual process is. I think the problem, the mistake that the solen team and arguably the banker team as well, wasn't necessarily the decision they made at the time it was the design and governance decisions or the lack thereof they made in the previous six months. This might not have happened if the solon team had earlier on implemented stronger risk protections, account limits, more stringent risk analytics.
00:21:48.730 - 00:22:11.400, Speaker A: So I think what we're seeing is really the effect of just, again, not fully appreciating the trade offs of different protocol designs. And in terms of dow governance, yeah, I think it also reflects poorly, but nothing that I think is emblematic of the space as a whole.
00:22:12.570 - 00:22:19.800, Speaker B: All right, well, certainly an interesting week in DAOs. It's been such a pleasure having you on unchained. Thanks for explaining all of this.
00:22:20.270 - 00:22:23.420, Speaker A: Thanks Laura, really great being on.

00:23:25.498 - 00:24:15.918, Speaker B: Some bitcoin miners face profitability concerns after weeks of negative price pressure for bitcoin and all other crypto assets, the profitability of bitcoin mining has been put into question. Miners have to pay for electricity and other fixed and variable costs in fiat currency. With the bitcoin price trading at $20,800 as of press time and having plummeted 57% this year against the US dollar, it is getting harder for miners to have a sustainable business. Glassnode released a report highlighting miners current financial stress. According to the blockchain research firm, bitcoin is trading near the estimated cost of production. Hash rate has decreased significantly and incomes are below the yearly average. With this extensive financial pressure on miners outflow, volumes from their treasuries reached rates of between 5000 to 8000 bitcoins per month.
00:24:15.918 - 00:25:05.470, Speaker B: This is now comparable with the 2018 to 2019 bear market capitulation event, Glassnode commented in its report. Arcane research also stated in an analysis that the deteriorating profitability of mining has forced the public miners to start liquidating their bitcoin holdings. This week, bitcoin miner Bit farms announced a sale of 3000 bitcoin to pay down part of a 100 million dollar loan with Galaxy. In consideration of extreme volatility in the markets, we have continued to take action to enhance liquidity and to deleverage and strengthen our balance sheet, said CFO Jeff Lucas. In a sign of how the depressed price has challenged miners, the block reported that bitcoin mining difficulty has decreased by 2.35% since June. Eigth which accounted for the second largest single fall this year.
00:25:05.470 - 00:25:40.946, Speaker B: In the same period of time. The hash rate has also dropped 2.6%. However, it was not all bad news for the crypto mining industry this week. Miner bit Digital reported $8 million in revenue in the first quarter of the year. In addition, Black Hill announced that it will start to power bitcoin mining in Wyoming with Celsius's solvency still in question. FTX rescues BlockFi. BlockFi CEO Zach Prince announced on Tuesday that the crypto lender had secured a $250,000,000 credit line from FTX.
00:25:40.946 - 00:26:46.666, Speaker B: Today, BlockFi signed a term sheet with FTX to secure a $250,000,000 revolving credit facility, providing us with access to capital that further bolsters our balance sheet and platform strength, Prince said. Sam Thinkman, Fried, FTX founder, said that the intention behind this deal is to allow BlockFi to navigate the market from a position of strength. He added, we take our duty seriously to protect the digital asset ecosystem and its customers. The deal comes at a time of high turmoil in the crypto ecosystem. With prices plummeting, big companies like crypto lender Celsius and trading firm Three Earls Capital being liquidated on their positions in a hard macroeconomic environment. Earlier in June, the Block reported that Blockfly was raising a down round at a $1 billion valuation after it was rumored last year to have been raising at a valuation of $5 billion. Alameda saves Voyager Digital, which discloses three AC exposure last Friday, crypto broker Voyager Digital signed a term sheet for $200 million in revolving credit from bankman Fried's quant trading firm Alameda.
00:26:46.666 - 00:27:42.810, Speaker B: The idea behind the loan was the same as Blockvis, as FTX intends to provide more flexibility to mitigate market conditions. However, on Wednesday, Voyager Digital disclosed involvement in Three Arrows Capital, causing a negative reaction in the markets. Voyager Digital may issue a notice of default to Three Arrows Capital, or Three AC, for failure to repay its loan. Voyager's exposure to Three AC consists of 15,250 bitcoins and $350,000,000 of USDC. The company's shares at Ticker V-Y-G VF plummeted around 50% after the news due to questions about the solvency of three AC. During the past few days, three AC has reportedly been liquidated by Blockfly, BitMEX and Genesis. In response to the situation, the crypto broker decided to limit daily withdrawals from its platform to $10,000, down from $25,000.
00:27:42.810 - 00:28:33.680, Speaker B: Similarly, Crypto exchange CoinFLEX halted withdrawals due to extreme market conditions yesterday. First short bitcoin ETF Launched Investment Product Issuer ProShares announced on Monday the launch of a new exchange traded fund that will make it possible to short bitcoin. In addition, the ETF will allow investors to hedge their crypto exposure. The ProShares short bitcoin strategy was listed on the NYSE on Tuesday. According to the company's website, the ETF's purpose is to avoid the significant costs and fees typically required to short bitcoin. ProShares listed many of the advantages of having a short ETF over the current possibilities, such as futures and put options. For example, users now have the possibility to short bitcoin operating through a traditional brokerage account.
00:28:33.680 - 00:29:10.710, Speaker B: Secondly, it removes the possibility of losing more Bitcoin than what you can put in. Lastly, investors will not be required to add funds to maintain margin levels. ProShares is the largest provider of bitcoin linked ETFs in the United States. In October 2021, it was the first company to list a Bitcoin futures ETF. At that point, BTC was going through a bull market and was trading at around $60,000. The fact that the launch of that ETF was done so close to the end of the bull market caused some people on Twitter to joke that the launch of this new ETF could mark the end of this bear market. However, not everyone took the news so lightly.
00:29:10.710 - 00:30:14.218, Speaker B: Will Clemente, a Bitcoin analyst, tweeted So there's now a short Bitcoin ETF, a futures ETF, a closed end fund trading at a 30% plus discount, a 401K option for bitcoin, but no spot ETF. It is clear that Gary Glens, Gensler and the SEC have an agenda against bitcoin. NFT Roundup with NFT NYC taking over the streets of Manhattan, there was a lot of NFT related news this week e commerce strike and Ebay acquired Known Origin, an NFT marketplace, for an undisclosed amount. As interest in NFTs continues to grow, we believe now is the perfect time for us to partner with a company that has the reach and experience of ebay, said David Moore, Known Origin co founder, Uniswap Labs, the entity behind the DeFi protocol. Uniswap acquired genie an NFT marketplace aggregator. By doing this, Uniswap will enable users to buy and sell NFTs directly on the app. We see NFTs as another form of value in the growing digital economy, and it's a no brainer for us to integrate them into our products, Uniswap said on Twitter.
00:30:14.218 - 00:30:51.894, Speaker B: There were some accusations that this move would push Uniswap in the direction of being a CFI protocol rather than DFI looked at Genie contracts. It is CFI, not DFI. Why is Uniswap getting into the CFI game? Said Ethereum Community member Micah Soltu. Magic Eden, the main NFT marketplace on Salana, raised $130,000,000 at a $1.6 billion valuation. The marketplace has been growing rapidly over the past several months, and a few weeks ago it surpassed OpenSea in daily transactions. This growth has attracted many investors, with Magic Eden's valuation rocketing almost ten times since the last funding round.
00:30:51.894 - 00:31:46.730, Speaker B: In March of this year, cristiano Ronaldo, Portuguese soccer megastar, partnered with Finance to launch a series of NFT collections. Together. We are going to change the NFT game and take football to the next level, said Ronaldo. Pharrell Williams will be the chief brand officer for Doodles NFTs, which also stated that it received its first round of funding led by venture capital firm Seven Seven Six. A new documentary was released reviving accusations from the winter that Yuga Labs's board Ape NFT collection has a Nazi culture the video, which was posted on YouTube last Sunday, goes over the alleged racist and white supremacist symbols hidden in the NFT collection. Yugalabs previously called these accusations deeply painful and disturbing. Salana builds a new Web three smartphone anatolia Yakavenko cofounder of Salana announced the launch of a new Android phone for web three and also new software development kit called Salana Mobile Stack.
00:31:46.730 - 00:32:41.130, Speaker B: The new smartphone was named Saga because the story of crypto is still being written.
