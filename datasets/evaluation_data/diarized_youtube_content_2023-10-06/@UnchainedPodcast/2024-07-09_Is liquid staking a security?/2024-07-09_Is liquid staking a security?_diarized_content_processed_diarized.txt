00:00:00.200 - 00:00:55.130, Speaker A: The liquid staking side is a little bit new, and they do articulate their theories around the liquid staking, and it looks very much like what they've said about staking in Coinbase and Binance. They are not focused on the technical Ethereum staking itself as a security. They are alleging that there is a program that is effectively a managed service being offered by Lido or rocket pool, and that, they say, is the investment program that Lido and rocket pool, according to the SEC, are providing effectively managerial efforts in the way they offer liquid staking. The service that they provide that makes it easier for people to stake, allows them to withdraw more easily, abstracts away the difficult technical issues. And so they're saying that offering that service is effectively an investment contract offering. It just so happens that it's staking that's at the center of it.
