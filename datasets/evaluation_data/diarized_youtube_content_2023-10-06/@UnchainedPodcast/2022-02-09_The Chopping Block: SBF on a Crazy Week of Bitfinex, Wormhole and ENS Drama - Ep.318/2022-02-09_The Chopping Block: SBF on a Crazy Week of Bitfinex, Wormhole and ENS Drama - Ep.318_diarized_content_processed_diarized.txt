00:00:02.570 - 00:00:24.458, Speaker A: Hello everybody, and welcome to the Chopping Block. Every couple weeks, the four of us get together and give industry insiders perspective on the crypto topics of the day. So very quick intros. First we got Tom, the DeFi maven and master of memes. Next up there's, Robert, the crypto connoisseur and captain of compound. Next we have Tarun Gigabrain and Grand pooba at Gauntlet. And myself haseeb I'm, the chief hype man at Dragonfly.
00:00:24.458 - 00:00:50.460, Speaker A: And today we have joining us a special guest, the Baron of the Bahamas, sam Bankman Fried, otherwise known as the I usually say the four of us, but the original four of us are early stage investors in crypto. And then we've got an amazing founder who's joining us today. But I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice or legal advice or even life advice. So with that out of the way, sam, how are you doing? I know that you've had some tech trolls getting on board. How's life?
00:00:51.330 - 00:01:04.254, Speaker B: It's been pretty good. It's been busy as always. I'm in DC right now for the second time this month and testifying in about 16 hours. That's exciting.
00:01:04.302 - 00:01:06.370, Speaker A: How many of those hours will you be sleeping?
00:01:06.790 - 00:01:10.242, Speaker B: I'm guessing five, four, something like that.
00:01:10.376 - 00:01:13.410, Speaker A: Okay, that sounds so the rumors are true.
00:01:13.560 - 00:01:14.900, Speaker B: Yeah, we'll see.
00:01:16.470 - 00:01:20.790, Speaker A: Any lessons learned from last go around that you were testifying?
00:01:21.130 - 00:01:59.140, Speaker B: Yeah, I think to some extent the lesson was like it was sort of what it seemed like. I don't know, I think that the biggest surprising thing, honestly, was how constructive it was. I was honestly expecting a bit of a shit show. I was sort of like expecting a lot of partisan bickering and there just wasn't it was sort of like almost everyone had a constructive attitude across both aisles that was legitimately was surprising. And then beyond that, I think everyone has their own questions that they're most interested in in the House. But it was fun.
00:02:00.310 - 00:02:05.810, Speaker A: Robert, you spend a good amount of time talking to legislators and lawmakers, right?
00:02:05.960 - 00:02:29.130, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, historically, you know, I've been one of know advocates for DeFi and one of the founders that has been sort of championing the idea and the cause long before it got to what DeFi is today. So today it's a huge umbrella which encompasses so many different things. The DeFi of yesteryear was a very limited number of projects like compound MakerDAO.
00:02:29.790 - 00:02:30.838, Speaker B: And systems like that.
00:02:30.864 - 00:02:53.890, Speaker C: And so I've been educating our elected and appointed officials for a long time about what is DeFi. The phrase has sort of evolved a bit. And now when you read a Bloomberg headline, oftentimes things that are not DeFi get called DeFi. And so I think it's creating a little bit more confusion than there used to be, but it's been a long time passion.
00:02:54.470 - 00:03:30.190, Speaker A: So let's go ahead and jump into news. So what we're going to do for today's show is we'll start by going through some of the interesting news items of the week and then we'll circle back and start asking Sam questions. So that's the game plan. So, first piece of news. Well, first of all, I wanted to congratulate Sam for the amazing fundraisers recently announced for FTX. I think between FTX US and FTX, the parent co or whatever FTX main ftx.com, you guys are now collectively 40 billion in valuation, which puts you almost on par with Coinbase thoughts.
00:03:30.770 - 00:04:20.240, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's true. It's been a wild ride and just the difference between now and a year ago is really few years ago especially massive. And I think the weirdest thing to me about it is or the most surprising thing, is just that the best predictor, I think, of our path was like if you sort of threw out all the outside views and threw out all the sanity checking and just like, I don't know, write down on a piece of paper what could happen, it still would not have predicted it correctly. I think like a billion dollars a day of volume on FTX is sort of my like, wow, there's chance we could get there and we're at 15 times that. But I still think that was a better predictor than trying to bake into it any other sort of like conventional wisdom or anything like that.
00:04:21.730 - 00:04:49.602, Speaker A: Well, yeah, it's completely incredible to see how meteoric the rise of FTX has been. And I think we've got a lot more questions for you that will hold to the end. But that was probably one of the probably the blockbuster fundraising news of the last couple of weeks. Congratulations to you for being a part of that. Then again, part of the Sam universe, of course, is Solana. And the other big news of the week was this wormhole hack that took place on Solana. So just the very kind of headline summary.
00:04:49.602 - 00:05:58.990, Speaker A: Basically what happened is that so wormhole is one of the major bridges that extends into Salana. It's a MultiChain bridge, so it's not just Salana, but the Salana side was the part that got hacked and the entire size of the hack was $325,000,000 that was hacked. Basically, the attacker was able to go onto the Salana side of the chain, issue unbacked ether, and then withdraw that unbacked ether into ethereum and run off with the money. And what ended up happening is, I believe, within a day, jump, which acquired Certus, which actually developed the original Wormhole bridge, and Jump is now the primary maintainer of wormhole. They basically decided, my understanding is that entirely off balance sheet to fill the hole and recapitalize all $325,000,000 worth of ether in order to save the day and basically patch the hole in the bridge. So all is relatively well in Salana land, but it was something of a near death experience for a lot of folks, especially in Solana DeFi, who realize all of a sudden that the bank that they thought they had money in was empty. And so it was a pretty wild experience.
00:05:58.990 - 00:06:02.254, Speaker A: Any reflections from folks on what happened that day?
00:06:02.452 - 00:06:55.938, Speaker D: Yeah, I guess one, the obvious statement is building bridges is hard. The second statement is there's actually been this fight sort of in between sort of like the Solana and Cosmos ecosystems. I wouldn't call it a fight. I'd call it a philosophical disagreement of whether you should have multiple wrap token types for bridged assets versus non bridged assets. And I actually think in the Solana world, people went a little crazy with how many different synthetic wrapped ETH versions there were. And that made it a lot harder to actually be able to reason about sort of the state of a lot of the lending protocols because they would have one type of staked ETH that was on wormhole, another type that was on a different bridge. And people had loans where they were sort of borrowing both against a single type of collateral or borrowing stable coins against both of those.
00:06:55.938 - 00:07:09.502, Speaker D: And that was like one of the crazier and more gnarly types of things we saw. And getting used to these bridge synthetics, I think, is a really big part of cross chain D Five that has not been solved.
00:07:09.646 - 00:08:11.420, Speaker C: Well, just to step back and go to like 90,000ft real quick. So as I understand what happened, for anyone who's listening, who hasn't gone into the deep detail about what happened, you had wormhole, which allowed people to take Ether from the Ethereum blockchain and create essentially a shadow asset on Solana, which is wormhole wealth. And the incident was somebody was able to print a huge amount of unbacked wormhole wealth on Solana, and this wormhole WETH was redeemed on Ethereum. They took real Ether out on the Ethereum side, and they had extra wormhole WETH tokens on Solana, which they then caused havoc intentionally and unintentionally with in the Solana ecosystem. In that wormhole WETH didn't have any assets backing it, and the attacker had extra wormhole WETH to play with. So this is how we sort of begin the story.
00:08:11.790 - 00:08:39.278, Speaker E: Yeah, I thought the mechanism was also pretty interesting. Like, I think Samsung had this had this thread about it, and it was so innocent. It was basically there's, like this one precompile that Solana uses to basically verify a signature, and it was like, missing in the Solidity version or the Salana program version rather that wormhole was using versus, like, a prior version. And so therefore the signature wasn't checked. And so really, really innocent mistake. But of course, now it's a $325,000,000 mistake.
00:08:39.454 - 00:08:47.460, Speaker D: I don't know if it's totally innocent. The PR was already up for it. In fact, that was the craziest part. Right?
00:08:49.990 - 00:09:03.238, Speaker A: The PR was up, but Jump did not realize the consequence of the it was just kind of a routine upgrade. Right? It's like, okay, well, there's some deprecation in the code. We got to change over to this thing, but they had no idea that there was this level of vulnerability introduced by the coaching.
00:09:03.254 - 00:09:08.490, Speaker E: Turin, I'm sure you cannot cite all the intricacies of every different version and subversion of solidity.
00:09:09.550 - 00:09:22.810, Speaker D: I agree. I'm just more pointing out that it was actually a known issue. It just like people didn't realize the spoofing level could be as high. Like you could actually call something of that function size like mint.
00:09:22.970 - 00:09:53.402, Speaker A: Yeah, I think one of the repeated bad takes that I saw is that oh, this shows that salana is broken, or that oh, we need L2s in order to solve this problem. And the reality is that it was a software layer bug and the software layer bug was at the connective tissue between two systems. Right. It's like how these two systems are going to talk to each other and authenticate that decisions are being made correctly. And the problem was not like if this was a L2 bridge, the same kind of failure could have happened. So the problem is not intrinsically even.
00:09:53.456 - 00:09:56.266, Speaker B: About salana or I mean, in some.
00:09:56.288 - 00:10:17.158, Speaker A: Sense it is because obviously this was a solana code chains that ended up triggering this mistake. But it's fundamentally a problem about connecting up two blockchains. And those two blockchains can be a layer one and a L2. They can be two different layer ones. It could be really anything that you're connecting to. The important take home is that Crosschain is really freaking hard and it's very likely this is not going to be the last mistake we see in the Crosschain universe.
00:10:17.354 - 00:10:49.802, Speaker B: Completely agree. Bridging is hard and all bridges are sort of hard in similar ways. Whether you're bridging a L2, a layer one, two layer ones, two L2s, bridging, I don't know, two countries, whatever. You've got two different ledgers that aren't the same ledger and that don't read each other. And I think in particular, maybe an interesting part of this is wormhole was intended to be one of the more decentralized bridges. There's a lot of bridges and they will all brand themselves decentralized. Most of them is decentralized in that there's two different keys that one person has.
00:10:49.802 - 00:11:26.086, Speaker B: Both of that are necessary in order to mint the asset or they're decentralized. Right? It's just like the guy is he like guy's ledger and it's like, oh, someone sent me some of this token. Yeah, sure, I'll send back some of this other one. I'll mint some. I got the key for that. That's how bridges usually work, right? And being a little bit glib, but the more decentralized you try and make it, on the one hand, it provides a lot of great properties. It's also way easier to fuck up, right? Because fundamentally it's a lot easier to just run an AWS service that checks that the balances are correct and never give anyone else permission to do anything.
00:11:26.086 - 00:11:35.980, Speaker B: If you're trying to make permission be something much more complicated than what you dictate. It's again, really powerful, but also really easy to screw up.
00:11:36.990 - 00:12:25.446, Speaker A: That's 100% right. And I think one of the concepts we were discussing this internally and one of the concepts that I've started to really like is this notion of private bridges and state backed bridges. And what you see today is that actually the vast majority of the bridges are quote unquote, state backed or sort of state sponsored, meaning that the blockchain themselves endorse and kind of route traffic through a particular bridge. And I think what you're going to see over time is that these bridges are just going to be absolutely dominant, the ones that are state backed. It's very hard for these private bridges that are sort of third parties developing on these chains to win. And the reason why, at least for crosschain transfers, why that's so hard to break that is because bridges are by and large a public good for the blockchain that wants to get assets over the bridge. And as a result, bridges are basically banks when it comes to these sort of bi directional type bridges.
00:12:25.446 - 00:13:14.026, Speaker A: They're basically banks. They have assets on one side, liabilities on the other side. And the goal is to make sure that the bank vault is always correctly sized for all the liabilities. And if something goes wrong, as it did with Wormhole, as it has with other bridges in the past, the ultimate thing that's going to give you confidence that the bridge is going to be okay is the size of the sovereign backing the bridge. And in this case, Jump was this sort of pseudo sovereign player that was like, okay, look, wormhole is so important and Salana is so important that we're just going to put all the money in and make sure that we have enough capital to keep this whole thing alive. If this was some other bridge, like some other small startup that was creating a bridge between a couple of chains, and if it got hacked for 300 million, it's game over. Right? It's sort of a bit for next situation where now we're trading IOUs about whether this bridge will ever make enough money again.
00:13:14.208 - 00:14:15.562, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean it seems sort of shitty to say, but the honest answer is like, yeah, the size of the bankroll of the person who issues the bridge tokens matters. And it matters even if there isn't an explicit insurance fund for it. It gives you a sense of how big the implicit insurance fund might or might not be. And that's sort of the world we live in. Actually, I feel like compound the protocol is one of the cleanest examples of like I think it's one of the protocols which has a maximized ratio of complexity to failure while being fully decentralized. It's not that it's the most complex perk all ever, it definitely isn't. But I think that's one thing that's impressed me about it is having even the updating code for it be actually fully on chain, but also it's not broken and it doesn't break periodically I think is somewhat impressive.
00:14:15.562 - 00:14:26.770, Speaker B: And it's like somewhere in a weird corner of this spectrum that doesn't get explored very much of high decentralization, moderate complexity and low failure.
00:14:27.510 - 00:15:21.380, Speaker C: Well, that's like the original DeFi vision, right? Which is like you can take a smart contract, which is a piece of code that is going to do one thing really well and really robustly. So well and so robustly. That you can rely on it in a different program and it's composable, and you build it so that it'll always work with a very simple API or interface and will work in a decentralized fashion and will work forever. And since then that's slow and hard to build and so I think a lot of development activity has really excelled in other corners of the world which is like, oh, it's centralized and it's fast and we change it every single day or it's a different approach entirely but yeah, it's a great approach. The downside is it's very slow to develop a system like that to prove out product market fit and to get things going.
00:15:21.990 - 00:16:10.114, Speaker D: Yeah and actually one thing I'd say historically if we look at the history of compute in general, right like parallel processors like getting to single core Linux took five years let's say roughly getting to SMP and multicore Linux took like 15 years. So it just takes a long time to get many different systems to interact in a way that's sort of efficient. I had this one really awesome coworker a long time ago who actually now is the head of research at Jump who had this statement which is you can pull a carriage with two horses but can you pull a carriage with 1024 chickens? And that's sort of a thing to think about when you're thinking about these.
00:16:10.152 - 00:16:14.146, Speaker B: Systems in a lot of ways I love that.
00:16:14.248 - 00:16:14.802, Speaker A: That's great.
00:16:14.856 - 00:16:19.254, Speaker D: It's just very intuitive as to what the problem is. Right when you stay it that way.
00:16:19.292 - 00:16:53.840, Speaker A: Yeah, very true. Okay, so let's go ahead and move on. So another piece of news because we tend to talk about weird dows another tidbit in the world of weird dows we now have a dow that's even larger than Constitution Dow assange Dow which raised $41 million on juice box to try to I'm not exactly sure what it's trying to do. It's something related to getting Julian Assange out of where he is which I don't know why money is going to solve this problem. Does anyone know the story?
00:16:54.450 - 00:17:32.300, Speaker E: It's it's actually it is a bit strange. So people probably remember Constitution Dow also used juicebox to do fundraising to buy this copy of the US constitution. Sanjao actually has more than ETH but roughly the same amount in dollar amount to ostensibly support Julian Assange. But the way they do it is a bit strange. Basically they are buying this one of one NFT by Pac, who's a famous NFT artist. But the Pac sale, the proceeds from that are going to Julian Assange's defense fund, basically fighting this case, saying that the UK is unfairly extraditing him to the US.
00:17:32.830 - 00:17:35.534, Speaker B: And so, yeah, it's basically going into.
00:17:35.572 - 00:17:39.854, Speaker E: His defense fund, but in a very sort of roundabout, crypto y way that.
00:17:39.892 - 00:17:42.480, Speaker C: Sounds so they're buying an NFT with all that.
00:17:46.050 - 00:17:55.730, Speaker E: Like yeah. Why can't they just donate directly? But that aside, I think we talked about Constitution Dow. Go ahead.
00:17:55.880 - 00:18:04.280, Speaker B: Oh. I mean, it seems brilliant. Way better than donating it directly. Right. If you donate directly, you get nothing here, you get an NFT. Think about that is a very fair point.
00:18:04.650 - 00:18:04.978, Speaker A: What's?
00:18:04.994 - 00:18:07.618, Speaker B: The dow. That $41 million.
00:18:07.724 - 00:18:11.020, Speaker A: Clearly, they get the NFT and they give the money to exactly.
00:18:11.550 - 00:18:12.106, Speaker B: Amazing.
00:18:12.208 - 00:18:15.770, Speaker D: It's like we added intellectual property to philanthropy.
00:18:16.430 - 00:18:21.462, Speaker B: Impact certificate. This is, in fact, almost exactly an impact certificate.
00:18:21.606 - 00:18:31.454, Speaker A: The problem, though, is that it's unclear that Julian needs 41 million for his defense. It's an open question whether this is a good way to get Julian not.
00:18:31.492 - 00:18:36.160, Speaker B: Necessarily making comments about the hyper quality, the actual impact. Right.
00:18:36.530 - 00:18:37.280, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:18:37.590 - 00:19:04.922, Speaker E: This does feel like I think someone said this a while ago, which was like, if the was sort of about Internet mobs collectively communicating and exacting some sort of real world action or real world consequence, basically DeFi allows them to do that with finance. And we sort of are seeing this more and more of sort of like global crowdfunding and global capital formation. And this is like the latest incarnation of it. Right.
00:19:04.976 - 00:19:07.306, Speaker B: I think four Chan and Reddit and.
00:19:07.328 - 00:19:14.878, Speaker E: All these Internet forums have been long supporters of Julian Assange, but there's only so much that writing to your congressmen will do. But now that you have $42 million.
00:19:14.964 - 00:19:18.526, Speaker B: You can move your cause pretty far.
00:19:18.548 - 00:19:23.360, Speaker E: With that amount of capital. And I'd expect to see more and more things like this going forward.
00:19:24.530 - 00:19:24.894, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:19:24.932 - 00:19:47.334, Speaker A: I feel like in some way, this is like what's it called when you take like, a neural net and you kind of figure out what is the thing that's going to activate it the most. I feel like this is like that version for the Internet, like, Julian Assange plus Dao plus lots of money plus and, like, you just end up with this thing and it's like, oh, yeah. Did you just tickle the hind brain of the Internet as deeply as you can? And this is what happened.
00:19:47.452 - 00:19:56.502, Speaker C: I mean, it would be better if Julian Assange minted NFTs for everybody who donate. Then it would raise 200 million and we'd be having a very different sphere of conversation.
00:19:56.566 - 00:20:06.554, Speaker D: Yeah. Sam, you've probably thought the most about alternative donation mechanisms. How do you feel about this? What would you optimize differently if you were in charge?
00:20:06.682 - 00:20:51.180, Speaker B: Well, overall, I think it's a really good idea. Sorry? I think it's a cool idea. As far as not commenting on the donation itself on the sort of like method here, I think it's basically an impact certificate. And what it can let you do is be entrepreneurial about philanthropy. And to me, to flesh this out a little bit, part of the cool thing here is let's say that there is someone who's going to do something really good for the world, right? And you didn't have a lot of capital to donate yourself, but you eventually thought the whole world is going to be like oh, I got a fucking baller. What he did was great, right? But the problem is he needs the money before he does the great thing, right? Or it doesn't work. He can't go into debt to do it.
00:20:51.180 - 00:21:20.838, Speaker B: But you're stretched pretty thin. You'd have to give literally everything you have or something in order to fund him to do this thing. And there are lots of people with lots of money who will in retrospect wish they had funded it were to happen, but only if it happens and proves they should have funded it. So what you can do is something like this where you say all right, here's the deal. I'll fund it and I get the NFT for having funded it, ed the impact certificate, NFT, whatever you want to call it. Then they do the thing. Holders are like holy shit, this guy's awesome.
00:21:20.838 - 00:21:47.758, Speaker B: It's an amazing thing to do. And you're like great, here is this certificate of having done this great thing. How much is worth people? Like $200 million like great, sold. And now the guy got his funding. You were making the market more efficient, right, bringing the funding to the good causes that needed it before the rest of the world realized they needed it. You get rewarded for that. You bought the NFT and then sold it for more later.
00:21:47.758 - 00:22:10.614, Speaker B: And the large donors still get to cause good things to happen because if they make a sort of like pattern of this, people are like oh great, we fund good things that we see and others don't. We can later sell the impact of that to the ultimate donors for a profit. And so thus we will go search out cool, awesome things to do for the world that other people wouldn't notice and make those happen.
00:22:10.812 - 00:22:18.614, Speaker A: There's a sense in which what we are seeing here is a kind of permutation of what was previously called impact certificates. So it's interesting.
00:22:18.812 - 00:22:23.690, Speaker D: Well, I think the interesting thing is that people didn't trade impact certificates before, right?
00:22:23.840 - 00:22:35.130, Speaker A: Well, the intrinsic idea was that they were supposed to, but of course nobody actually cared because there were no NFTs back then. So now that we have NFTs, we have solved in one fell swoop the entire illiquidity juice box.
00:22:35.200 - 00:22:48.770, Speaker E: Contributions are tokenized, right? You sort of saw that with people with constitution dow which went up like 100 X. And so if you do donate to assange Dow you are getting justice tokens, which who knows what those will trade at? But you could sort of think of them in the sense of impact certificates.
00:22:49.350 - 00:22:54.900, Speaker C: Do you think the contributions are a response to the overvaluation of people?
00:22:55.270 - 00:22:55.918, Speaker B: Potentially.
00:22:56.014 - 00:23:04.306, Speaker E: But who's to say what people's motivations are? And is it so wrong if there's some profit motivation in someone's donation to Sanjao?
00:23:04.498 - 00:23:38.526, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, obviously most of these crazy Dows we're seeing are just the things that manage to they're the most evolutionarily fit memes that just kind of burst their way onto headlines and it sort of becomes this kind of ratcheting up game of kind of who can do the most ridiculous thing and get attention. Now, that being said, look, I'm not taking any view on Julian Assange. I think this is not an unreasonable thing to care about. It'd be surprising to me if he needs 41 million for his legal defense fund. But what do I know? Maybe he has got a very expensive set of lawyers.
00:23:38.638 - 00:23:47.522, Speaker D: What would you do differently, Sam? Let's say you wanted to make it an impactful assange Dow well, okay, sorry.
00:23:47.576 - 00:23:50.660, Speaker B: Do differently in the market construct or in what the money would do?
00:23:51.290 - 00:23:58.594, Speaker D: The market construct. Let's suppose there was some way of measuring an outcome, right? Because the problem is the outcome is completely not tied to this fundraising vehicle.
00:23:58.722 - 00:24:50.378, Speaker B: Yeah, well, I think it's quite in the end, I think it's quite hard to have you could imagine so here's the thing you could do in this specific case, but it doesn't work necessarily in general, is you could say that there's some payoff related to whether or not he is extradited or have some measurable outcome here that this is ultimately tied to. And then what you could get is a bunch of people to pledge to pay some amount for it, conditional on that, right? You could imagine that. What happens is that some foundation says, look, conditional on achieving this well defined goal, we will pay $200 million for this NFT and otherwise we will have absolutely no interest in the NFT. And then if theoretically, it had no meme value, which maybe it does, but.
00:24:50.464 - 00:25:08.522, Speaker D: If it sandwiches in fact, the thing Sam's pointing out is actually this very old sort of mechanism that Vitalik proposed in 2018, the Daiko, which was supposed to basically do this, but it was like a pre pre NFT. Daiko didn't have this NFT concept.
00:25:08.666 - 00:25:12.458, Speaker A: I would say it's like a dico. It's more like a prize. It's effectively like a prize.
00:25:12.634 - 00:25:15.410, Speaker D: I mean, Daiko is like a prize, right? It was like a metered.
00:25:17.110 - 00:25:38.642, Speaker A: It's more like you achieve sort of further funding goals if you hit certain milestones. Yeah, I think it's basically like a permutation of a prize that then the receipt of that prize is tradable in some sense or a certificate of that prize, which in some sense kind of defeats the point of the prize. Maybe if you had a Nobel Prize that was just being traded around in the secondary market, it'd be a little bit weird.
00:25:38.786 - 00:25:48.506, Speaker B: It's weird, but I'm not sure it's crazy, right? Because what it means is that if you can do something noble, prize worthy, you'll get actually paid money for it, according to how cool people think that.
00:25:48.528 - 00:25:50.506, Speaker A: Is, more than the nominal prize, more.
00:25:50.528 - 00:26:00.302, Speaker B: Than the nominal amount you'll get paid, how much the world actually values your NFT, which is exactly the same as they value what you did. Of course. That's how it right, right?
00:26:00.436 - 00:26:30.822, Speaker A: It's interesting. Okay, let's move on. So there was another piece of news, this thing. So GameStop and Immutable X did a partnership, and so GameStop is going to be launching their NFT marketplace in partnership with Immutable X. You guys might remember immutable X. They're a starware powered, ZK roll up NFT marketplace. They originally came out of the team that built Gods Unchained, and later they did this partnership with TikTok.
00:26:30.822 - 00:27:22.138, Speaker A: It's like TikTok moments thing. And so Immutable X gave GameStop a bunch of IMX tokens, which is the tokens for the Mutable X platform. And GameStop then subsequently, immediately market dumped something like what was it, like, 40, $35 million worth of this token? And people got mad on Twitter. We had a big debate internally about whether this is even a story, because ultimately, if you give somebody a grant and you don't have any vesting on that grant, the understanding is like, okay, well, we have costs associated with building stuff. So when you give us tokens, what do you want us to we need working capital, we need to sell it to go hire engineers. But it was very interesting how very strongly the reaction is, oh, no, you guys are assholes, and you're terrible, and how could you have done this to us? Curious what you guys think. What are the norms here when you receive a grant from a group like this?
00:27:22.224 - 00:27:54.466, Speaker B: So here's the fucked up thing. If they'd gotten dollars, let's say Mutable X paid them 100 million US dollar bill for this, no one would have complained that they weren't toddlers, right? No one would have said, why didn't you use those dollars to buy the Immutable X token in the market? Right? But if you give them Immutable X tokens and they sell the tokens, people aren't like, oh, we're back to that original estate that we're fine with. Like, what the fuck? You sold the token, right? The framing is very different, even though it's a similar sam, we lost you.
00:27:54.648 - 00:28:22.970, Speaker E: Maybe part of the lesson here is GameStop needs better trade execution. So then it just immediately market dumped, however much it was, and said, spread it out over time. So it's not so immediately noticeable. But I'm kind of inclined to agree. I think, like a ZRX or zerox. We give out grants in ZRX, and it's expected, especially for a lot of these. Early stage startups, which actually are very cash straps, maybe unlike GameStop, that it's expected that they sell it to pay their employees and to pay for servers and stuff like that.
00:28:22.970 - 00:28:33.358, Speaker E: Maybe part of the weirdness too, was GameStop has raised a bunch of money by selling stock in the stock market recently. And so it's like, did you really need that extra $40 million or whatever the number was?
00:28:33.524 - 00:29:16.718, Speaker C: Well, I think the thing that made people unhappy was that there was an expectation when you're giving tokens that you're going to have long term alignment of interest, right. That GameStop and Immutable X are going to be partners and teammates for a long time. And it's the view of GameStop and Mutable X like, oh yeah, of course we're teammates, right? We gave them a whole bucket worth of value and we're building this huge thing together. But to a community member, you see that there's a more pure alignment of interest that's possible. They hold the token, they benefit when token go up. Right? And that didn't happen here. So I think there's really two modifications that you might see down the road in a future BD world.
00:29:16.718 - 00:29:54.298, Speaker C: One is vested tokens or something that unlocks over time. We're seeing this pop up all the time in Dows and DeFi and protocol to protocol interactions. It's becoming way more common. It's always been common with investors and things with tokens, especially when there isn't vesting or know, the market learns why there should be very quickly. So I think it's the first change that might happen in future projects is you'll see lockups. If it's like a system like Immutable X giving tokens to a company like GameStop for a massive BD deal, it probably won't be immediately liquid. It might vest over years.
00:29:54.298 - 00:30:30.920, Speaker C: Right? And the second thing you might start to see is it looking more like how you incentivize employees, which know, you might see it look more like options or upside in a relationship as opposed to, here's a huge amount of value today. And I don't think obviously I'm a little bit biased as an investor in Immutable, but I don't think what they did today was that bad. I think the communities are going to learn better approaches to structuring these long term relationships over time. And then next time there's a company like Immutable and a company like GameStop, it probably won't be tokens that get market sold at the very outset of the relationship.
00:30:31.690 - 00:30:59.102, Speaker B: Maybe a few other things. I basically agree. A few other things. First of all, if you want to blame someone, I think you can blame Immutable X as much as GameStop here. Like, Immutable could have paid in dollars, instead they paid in tokens. Were they the ones who dumped really? Is there a Mutable treasury that dumped that $100 million and GameStop just purchased and then sold them? If you want to think about it that way. Right? And so I think it's as much a question of like, why they pay tokens and not dollars as anything else.
00:30:59.102 - 00:31:27.270, Speaker B: And I think what it gets to is something like Robert's point, which is like, there's sort of not that much point in giving someone unlocked, fully vested liquid tokens instead of dollars because they could use the dollars to buy the tokens if they wanted. They could sell the tokens for the dollars fix at one half dozen at the other. But yeah, I think basically if you're giving unlocked, fully vested liquid tokens, it's the same a dollar and it's just a serve of fiction that they're very different and it's just the framing.
00:31:27.610 - 00:31:39.146, Speaker A: Yeah, that makes sense. Okay, well, there are two remaining items, so we'll try to be relatively quick. So the big drama of the week in kind of social media campaign, this.
00:31:39.168 - 00:31:41.270, Speaker D: Wasn'T a week of just one big drama.
00:31:41.350 - 00:32:26.854, Speaker A: I know there are multiple. There's always big dramas because it's crypto, Twitter. Okay, so ENS, the Ethereum naming service, which is basically like a of you get something, something ENS associated with your name. There is a gentleman by the name of Brantley Milligan who is a director of operations at ENS. He's been there for a long time and he wrote a bunch of tweets in 2016. My understanding is that he actually wrote a bunch of tweets, like in his entire career as a tweeter that basically were very so he's a staunch Catholic and he is very anti gay, anti kind of everything that Catholics don't like, I guess. And he's been very public about it and very offensive of First World norms.
00:32:26.854 - 00:33:06.440, Speaker A: And this broke out into this big conflict, especially as the tent of Ethereum has grown quite a bit with the advent of NFTs. It used to be that people in Ethereum are going to be like, whatever, who cares? Everybody can just have their crazy libertarian views and go live off in a corner. It's fine. But there's now this big conversation going on in Ethereum about cancel culture free speech. This guy's a Catholic, a lot of people in the world believe this stuff, but it's also not inclusionary. And so what do you want to do? As of yesterday, he was removed from ENS, basically fired. But it kind of brought about this big culture war that has been noticeably missing in crypto that kind of reared its head in the Ethereum community.
00:33:07.290 - 00:33:24.234, Speaker D: Also, he was fired by a company that's contracted to do work for the Dao. Technically not fired from the right. Let's get this correct in terms of Dow related things. He was undelegated from he was undelegated from the Dow.
00:33:24.282 - 00:34:08.380, Speaker A: Thank you for that clarification Tarun. So, I mean, look, I just very quickly give my two cent. In general, I don't have a very strong view about people who are just sitting around doing their jobs, having beliefs that I disagree with, but I kind of agree, like, look, man, it's 2022 I don't know. This is not even like a mainstream Catholic thing to be constantly hating on people who are into same sex marriage. So I just think at certain point if you're going to be loud about it on Twitter, I don't know, we can find other director of Ops. It's fine. There are plenty of people out there who want to help out with, but but in general, the cancel culture thing coming to crypto is interesting, and I think this is kind of the first beachhead we saw something like this with open source happen.
00:34:08.380 - 00:34:17.440, Speaker A: Probably about started probably about four or five years ago. And then the kind of culture around open source totally changed. But open source used to look a lot like crypto in that regard.
00:34:18.770 - 00:34:29.042, Speaker D: Let's put this way the Rust community is 80% crypto haters 20% crypto lovers and it's very closely related to this. There was a schism there as well.
00:34:29.176 - 00:34:29.860, Speaker A: Right?
00:34:31.990 - 00:35:12.110, Speaker B: And this doesn't answer the ultimate question but I think it's relevant for the proximate. One is acknowledging that maybe he was fired because the company and or Dow and or company Dow combination that had hired him disagreed with his beliefs. Maybe he was fired because they were worried about the PR impact of other people disagreeing with his belief. Not clear exactly which one of those it is or where on that spectrum it is. I think it maybe doesn't impact the end result or the impact of it on society but impacts where you should direct your love and or hatred depending on how you feel about it.
00:35:12.260 - 00:35:20.786, Speaker A: Well, I think it's also at the heart of crypto. Right. If you remember the Coinbase drama when Brian Armstrong posted his big piece about Coinbase being an apolitical place oh yeah.
00:35:20.808 - 00:35:22.660, Speaker B: That'S a really smart piece to have.
00:35:26.950 - 00:35:49.798, Speaker A: The soul of mean. I feel like this is really intrinsic to how our industry works. Sam, how do you think about this given that you just caught up to Coinbase and Coinbase has kind of put out this big memorandum about their view on the intersection of know, cancel culture kind of cultural battles. Where does FTX fit in that spectrum?
00:35:49.974 - 00:35:58.286, Speaker B: I mean, I'd like to say that that's know, we're not trying to take a side in it is sort of like my Sam's mic just went out.
00:35:58.308 - 00:35:59.150, Speaker A: No, I'm kidding.
00:36:01.890 - 00:36:03.674, Speaker B: I was hopeful, I was grateful.
00:36:03.722 - 00:36:04.640, Speaker A: But no.
00:36:06.850 - 00:37:00.770, Speaker B: It'S complicated. Yeah, it's a shitty answer and I think I will say that two different things you could say that I feel somewhat differently about one of them is like one could say that they don't think that people should bring their politics that their politics should be knowable or known at work at all. And another thing is that people should be able to work productively with each other as a team, independent of their political belief. I certainly agree with the second one much more so than the first one. I wasn't sure exactly which of those was intended, I think, by Coinbase's piece on this. And I think that my take is roughly know, people are welcome to have the beliefs that they want, and I'm not going to pretend that none of those are ever going to make it into work and that none of those are ever going to be discussed at the office.
00:37:00.920 - 00:37:39.040, Speaker D: Oh, I guess I was just more going to say I actually think the Coinbase post reads better now than it did then, in some ways. And also the interesting thing is I think Nick from ENS had a tweet criticizing FWB for retroactively changing their mind on something. I think it's like hard when you're in the hot seat and that happens, and oftentimes history will judge you from the future, not from at that moment. You'll get judged relative to the context of the future rather than the context at that moment.
00:37:39.810 - 00:37:56.920, Speaker A: Okay, so quick speed round. So if somebody Brantley like, was at your organization, would you fire him? So we'll just go around one by one, because I think most of us are currently in the position of running or having run organizations. Tarun, you first.
00:37:57.610 - 00:38:08.934, Speaker D: I don't know honestly here and say probably not, but yeah, probably not.
00:38:09.052 - 00:38:09.462, Speaker A: All right.
00:38:09.516 - 00:38:13.314, Speaker B: Robert, there's been a saying at Compound.
00:38:13.362 - 00:39:03.100, Speaker C: For many years, which is we hire people regardless of their views about religion, sexual orientation, and know, I personally believe know, allowing people to be a part of an organization with extremely broad views. I think the cardinal rule is don't be offensive to people. I think it's one thing to have views. I think it's another thing to not being willing to engage in fruitful conversation. It would depend on the circumstances. But if it became a very public situation like that and they, let's say, double down and triple down and refuse to apologize and refuse to engage in fruitful, know, I would lean know, firing them. But it would still be extremely, you know, my bias would be towards keeping Tom.
00:39:03.630 - 00:39:44.402, Speaker E: Yeah, I mean, this is like classic paradox of tolerance kind of, kind of stuff. I think the thing with Brandley and I've talked to a few folks who've worked with him is everyone said he's extremely know, very there's. I don't think there's any sort of idea that he would have maybe treated people who were in his tweet maybe differently, and I don't think it would have had any impact on ENS the product, which is another part of the concern with thinking about inclusion in the workplace. I think the problem is just maybe, as Sam said, if you want to build a team, a lot of people will not or want to work with somebody like that, and therefore it just becomes a problem for performance and company performance independent of the actual output of the person or independent of the actual product impact.
00:39:44.546 - 00:40:06.126, Speaker A: Yeah, I would say I agree with Robert Stake here, but I think that makes me say fire, because somebody posted this very long collection of every single time he said the word gay. And he's posted 200 different tweets basically saying that gay people are evil and bad and that they should go to hell or whatever. I'm just like, why do you talk about this?
00:40:06.228 - 00:40:09.962, Speaker D: Could have done that. Yeah, but then that's a hiring time decision.
00:40:10.026 - 00:40:14.880, Speaker A: Because that's true. But look, if you get it wrong when hiring somebody, at least get it right.
00:40:17.650 - 00:40:40.630, Speaker D: Also, I think while the ENS drama was drama, I think the real drama still hasn't been talked about in the show and in the comments everyone wants to hear about Think. Let's start with Sam, because I actually feel know you were around when Leo came into existence and we're probably more close to so, like, how do you feel about the overall?
00:40:41.050 - 00:41:00.666, Speaker B: I mean, like, super excited that it was found. I think that's great. And I think rewinding a little bit. I think the news today I think is straightforwardly, good and really happy for them. Whatever. I've heard a lot of rumors and stories about what happened sorry, really briefly.
00:41:00.698 - 00:41:03.566, Speaker A: Just interrupt you because I think a lot of our audience may not know what the hell we're about.
00:41:03.588 - 00:41:03.870, Speaker B: No.
00:41:03.940 - 00:41:26.310, Speaker A: So Bitfinex recently announced that 4.5 billion had been recovered by the DOJ. Bitfinex was hacked many, many years ago, and there's a US couple that has been accused but not yet indicted is my understanding, of having been responsible for laundering some of that $4.5 billion in Bitcoin. So that was recently recovered by the DOJ. Sorry, go ahead.
00:41:26.380 - 00:41:36.310, Speaker B: Yeah, and I think the implication is that they have the whole $4.5 billion and probably are the ones who hacked it. I don't know if that's been said explicitly.
00:41:36.390 - 00:41:37.686, Speaker A: Allegedly. Allegedly.
00:41:37.798 - 00:42:26.854, Speaker B: Allegedly. But I think the allegation is that they are the hacker, not just that they were somewhere in the food chain there, although I don't know that for sure. I've heard a lot of different versions of what actually happened six years ago when the hack took place. But I think that the recovery here is remarkable from a number, not just the recovery of the coins, but the recovery of Bitfinex. I think, like, them going under as a business and their customers losing a third of their money was probably what most people would have guessed the outcome of that hack was going to be. And instead they were able to keep operating. They gave everyone an option of they could take a haircut or they could take equity or they could get an IOU, and they ended up making Amphibian poll according to what they chose.
00:42:26.854 - 00:42:59.080, Speaker B: And if you'd held on, you got paid back fully if you took equity. I think you probably did better than that. I think it sort of is remarkable how well that story ended up, given the circumstances ending for everyone involved and for the customers. And I think it displayed some amount of it was a gutsy move, but I think one that was probably the right one and showed a lot of dedication from the team involved there during what I know is an absolutely hellish thing to be involved in.
00:42:59.770 - 00:43:45.250, Speaker D: I think the story that's funnier is that the culprits are people well, at least I will say someone I knew reasonably well, well, one of them a couple of years ago. And the weirdest thing is I used to run this meetup where people gave talks and she he gave a talk about basically how to social engineer your way into anything. And there was also this very weird scenario where BitGo also had her doing a talk on cybersecurity and hidden in this Bitfinex thing, and maybe this is actually something, when Sam gets back, we can talk a little about. Is what's the relationship that BitGo had.
00:43:45.320 - 00:43:47.714, Speaker B: With this sort of incident?
00:43:47.762 - 00:44:04.060, Speaker D: Because I do think they were involved in a lot of the custody portion around this time. And the relationship between bitfinex and BitGo somehow that's something that has never been understood to I don't totally understand about this attack. And Sam probably knows way better.
00:44:04.830 - 00:44:52.570, Speaker B: I don't know for sure. I hear things. I don't have firsthand knowledge here that I can cite with confidence, but I can echo what Karun said, that I think a lot of things that are not generally understood or public about that relationship. And I think what it gets to is this really fucking nasty problem in custody for crypto. I think we hear a lot of people saying is like, well, I want to store my crypto, a third party custodian. And I think my response was like, okay, first of all, there's like a question of how secure that custodian is. But second of all, how about that interface between the custodian and the exchange? Let's say that you sell a bitcoin that you're storing at a third party custodian to someone on the exchange, and then that other person requests a withdrawal of that bitcoin, their private wallet.
00:44:52.570 - 00:45:28.290, Speaker B: Then the exchange asks the custodian to send it. And do they just do it without asking questions? If so, if the exchange gets compromised, probably you're not safe if you're in a third party custodian. If they don't, how are they filling withdrawals? And whose coins are those really? And what's the governance around that? How do you get settlement to work on two different, very different systems? What if the line between them is compromised, right? What if someone imitates the exchange talking to the custodian, or vice versa?
00:45:28.870 - 00:45:30.980, Speaker D: It's the centralized bridge problem.
00:45:31.750 - 00:45:46.074, Speaker B: It is instead of bridging to decentralized things where you can actually look at the public ledgers of both, you're bridging to centralized things that you're hoping are both telling the truth and correct about everything, it's bridges all the way down.
00:45:46.112 - 00:45:47.340, Speaker A: Is what you're telling us.
00:45:47.710 - 00:45:48.826, Speaker B: God damn it.
00:45:48.928 - 00:45:54.560, Speaker A: So, Tarun, I am fascinated by the story of this woman because I keep hearing tidbits about her.
00:45:55.730 - 00:46:23.480, Speaker D: She's actually like a funny person to hang out with. It's just that she always did talk about these kind of a little bit weird things. Like, she also knew a lot of cybersecurity people in New York, which is how I met so, you know, I'm not totally surprised in some ways, but she's a very good speaker. Her talk was hilarious. I don't know about her rap career as much as the Internet does. Seems to know right now they know much more than me.
00:46:24.170 - 00:46:25.366, Speaker B: I was going to say that the.
00:46:25.388 - 00:46:27.910, Speaker E: Details of the case are also pretty funny.
00:46:28.410 - 00:46:31.154, Speaker B: Basically, it looks like they were somehow.
00:46:31.202 - 00:46:55.650, Speaker E: Spending the bitcoin via gift, and that sort of how it tied some of the addresses to their email addresses. And they were just, like, storing the raw private keys on this guy's Icloud account with like a weak password, which is, I think, how the FBI actually got a hold of it. So it's just like classic terrible OpSec, but somehow they're also maybe able to allegedly steal several billion dollars of bitcoin.
00:46:55.990 - 00:47:05.278, Speaker D: Also, this guy was talking about on Twitter how he needs to teach people, like, crypto OpSec, which was also kind of a little bit comical.
00:47:05.454 - 00:47:39.050, Speaker C: I mean, the fact that they were cashing out via gift cards and bitcoin ATMs and sending money to many different exchange accounts, all of which was like, bitcoin from an extremely well known and visible hack, shows that they are not criminal masterminds. Whether or not they are involved with the original hack or we're just the recipients of the bitcoin or something else, I have no idea. But a lot of that behavior is not mastermind tier. It's really bad amateur tier.
00:47:39.210 - 00:47:45.410, Speaker B: Sorry, I may have missed something here, but what exactly was their relationship with BitGo and with bitfinet?
00:47:46.070 - 00:47:55.940, Speaker D: Oh, so she actually was a consultant for BitGo for a while and did basically taught cybersecurity for consumers class.
00:47:57.110 - 00:47:58.534, Speaker A: We don't know if this has any.
00:47:58.572 - 00:48:02.406, Speaker B: Relationship to the hack when the hack happened.
00:48:02.588 - 00:48:04.438, Speaker D: No, this was way later, actually.
00:48:04.604 - 00:48:10.470, Speaker B: Way later. Did she have a relationship with either of them while or before the hack?
00:48:11.070 - 00:48:12.410, Speaker D: Not unknown.
00:48:12.750 - 00:48:46.646, Speaker A: Right now the Internet is full of innuendo and like a lot of whatever that Charlie from always sunny meme of drawing lines. The reality right now is that we don't really know a whole lot, and so it's not super useful to speculate. Also, Laura has repeatedly instructed us to use the word allegedly over and over again so that we make clear that right now there has not been an actual case that has been seen in a judge. So we don't know. Anyway, we're running up on time and we did have some questions we wanted to ask Sam to wrap everything up. So, troon, I think you're first up.
00:48:46.828 - 00:48:47.222, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:48:47.276 - 00:48:51.234, Speaker D: So the big question, and this is the one that was sort know, advertised.
00:48:51.282 - 00:48:55.206, Speaker B: On the internet was whether Sam is.
00:48:55.228 - 00:49:03.686, Speaker D: A word cell or a shape rotator. And so just to give a little so, Sam, how much do you know about the word cell versus shaper hitter?
00:49:03.718 - 00:49:04.262, Speaker A: Meme?
00:49:04.406 - 00:49:07.722, Speaker B: I have seen it and have no idea what it means. Okay, cool.
00:49:07.776 - 00:49:28.782, Speaker D: So it's basically a meme that basically argues that there's two types of people in the world. There's one, the word cells, who are the cell as a suffix referring to self sabotage, those who are very, like, incel. No, but incel comes from that, too. They're both the same Latin.
00:49:28.926 - 00:49:29.858, Speaker C: Wait, really?
00:49:29.944 - 00:49:33.490, Speaker A: Incel is no, incel is involuntary celibacy.
00:49:34.310 - 00:49:42.290, Speaker D: Well, you should read the etymology of word cell, which is in this tarun.
00:49:42.370 - 00:49:45.382, Speaker C: Is all shape rotator 0% word cell, 100%.
00:49:45.436 - 00:49:46.760, Speaker A: That is definitely true.
00:49:48.170 - 00:50:42.250, Speaker D: Well, there is the God guide by the other Tarun. So it was invented by another person named Tarun who's probably soon going to be more famous than me on the Internet. So basically, shape rotators really logical, almost to a fault, can't express things that they want in words very well, but can be a Putnam fella exactly like Tarun. Word cell is really good at writing, but maybe, I don't know, has sort of the feeling of a journalist. And then the self sabotage thing is actually where the cell comes from, according to the manifesto. But the idea of a word cell is someone who sort of, like, complains online on the Internet a lot with big words. And so for some reason, that dichotomy has been just taken over the Internet.
00:50:42.590 - 00:50:49.446, Speaker B: And so the thought is that the shape rotator. So it's not exactly just a mathematical versus literary divided.
00:50:49.638 - 00:50:51.446, Speaker A: It's kind of like your spatial intelligence.
00:50:51.478 - 00:51:14.530, Speaker D: Versus it's more like an IQ test. Right. If you break down IQ tests, they have half of those shape matching problems of like, hey, are these the two shape, or can you twist one to another? And the other one are sort of the vocab ones. And there's this argument that you should split IQ into I don't really believe in any of this stuff, but the Internet decided to go onto it.
00:51:14.680 - 00:51:20.982, Speaker B: I don't know. I mean, I guess three to one deep rotator to word cellar or something. I don't know.
00:51:21.116 - 00:51:22.520, Speaker D: Okay, that's pretty good.
00:51:23.210 - 00:51:27.378, Speaker A: Tarun, how would you classify yourself on that spectrum? Probably if you had to do ratio.
00:51:27.474 - 00:51:31.882, Speaker D: Similar probably similar, like maybe four to one.
00:51:32.016 - 00:51:33.738, Speaker A: Wait, Robert, you said four to one.
00:51:33.824 - 00:51:35.850, Speaker C: No, Tarun is four to zero.
00:51:36.000 - 00:51:43.222, Speaker A: Four to zero? Damn. If Tarun was four to zero, he would not be on the show. He would be off in a closet.
00:51:43.366 - 00:51:46.254, Speaker D: My hair color at least gets me a couple word cell points.
00:51:46.292 - 00:51:50.026, Speaker A: All right, you definitely get word cell points for the hair and the sweater.
00:51:50.218 - 00:51:50.960, Speaker B: Yes.
00:51:51.490 - 00:51:52.698, Speaker A: You're getting a good word cell bump.
00:51:52.714 - 00:52:02.320, Speaker D: There, and I think it's good that now, how do you feel about this, meme, now that you've seen it so many times? And now you've kind of sort of got the idea for it.
00:52:02.930 - 00:52:19.000, Speaker B: I think there's maybe something I've left to get about it. I think there's probably a spirit behind it that I haven't quite jived or melded with yet that I'll see where I'm going to look and be like, oh, that's fucking word. So, like, that's a fucking shape rotator. I'm not at that point yet where I can be like, that is the classic example of one of these.
00:52:20.090 - 00:52:48.094, Speaker A: I want to diagnose it. I think the reason why this has taken off is that it's the first dichotomy of this kind that basically puts literary people in a lower position than mathematical people. And classically, it's the other way around. The journalists are yelling at tech people on the Internet, and that's kind of the thing that's mostly happening on Twitter. Whereas, like, oh, you're a word cell. Word cell is basically an insult, and it's kind of like being able to define your terms. And no, I'm not the nerd.
00:52:48.094 - 00:52:51.166, Speaker A: You're the is like it's like proxy.
00:52:51.198 - 00:53:04.520, Speaker E: War for tech versus media, but we're playing it through this other little thing. So it's not as direct or another way of saying it. Know, Shape Rotator versus Word cell is just myers Briggs for Shape know, you want to make up your own dichotomy, and here you go.
00:53:05.370 - 00:53:13.558, Speaker D: Myers Briggs for shape rotators. Now that means Tom is a five out of five on the yeah, to.
00:53:13.564 - 00:53:19.882, Speaker A: Be clear, I think we're probably all five of us are Shape Rotators, which is why we're talking about this. If you were a word cell, you're not talking about this.
00:53:20.016 - 00:53:21.066, Speaker D: This is true.
00:53:21.248 - 00:53:31.680, Speaker B: I think maybe I feel maybe to give a slightly better answer. I think I feel natively much more like a Shape Rotator, but I think that I can rotate words as well if I need to or something like that.
00:53:34.230 - 00:53:36.820, Speaker A: That sounds like a $40 billion CEO answer.
00:53:37.190 - 00:53:39.460, Speaker E: Are you a shape sell? That's the other.
00:53:41.190 - 00:53:43.922, Speaker B: Word rotator. Okay.
00:53:43.976 - 00:53:48.978, Speaker A: A word rotator. All right, I like that. Okay, I think we only have time for one more question, so I'm going.
00:53:48.984 - 00:53:50.246, Speaker B: To go ahead and ask one.
00:53:50.428 - 00:54:24.106, Speaker A: So this is something I was chatting about with a friend, actually. So if you look at the real big characters that have come out of crypto in the US. Who've led big companies and started new exchanges, the first one was Arthur Hayes. And Arthur Hayes is like almost the perfect polar opposite of you, Sam. He's like a big, super buff black guy who was kind of a supervillain in a lot of ways and just the way that he was very brusk. He just is sort of out there and fighting with people and was willing to kind of put a middle finger to US. Regulators.
00:54:24.106 - 00:54:48.302, Speaker A: And you are very much the opposite, right? You sort of have this heroic status. You've donated a bunch of money to political campaigns. You're like, this effective altruist. You're giving away a bunch of more you're much more shape rotating. It's hard to get mad at you. How much of this is intentional, and how much of this do you attribute to just, like, how much of this was like, you saw what happened to Arthur, and you're like, Holy shit, I should not do that. I should do the opposite.
00:54:48.302 - 00:54:52.182, Speaker A: And how much of it is just incidental to your difference in personality?
00:54:52.326 - 00:55:46.486, Speaker B: Oh, I could be that buff. I just choose not no, I think there's some of mean I think maybe the way that I would phrase it is something I don't I don't want to put words in other people's mouths, but my sense is that Arthur is Arthur. Arthur is being Arthur, and he's being true to, you know, the Arthur that you see. It is sort of know there's some bluster there's. Bravado but I think that's a reflection of what he fails and it's a reflection of what he thinks and how he thinks. And I think there's lots of interesting things that he thinks that he talks about. I think that the way that I approach it is almost just perpendicular to that, as opposed to going in the opposite way or something, which is something like, look, I feel like I didn't get born with being pro regulator or anti regulator.
00:55:46.678 - 00:55:48.140, Speaker A: Sam, we lost you.
00:55:48.670 - 00:55:53.190, Speaker D: I also saw Arthur kind of recently. He seems to be having fun lately.
00:55:53.270 - 00:55:55.318, Speaker A: Yeah, look, to be clear, I love Arthur, actually.
00:55:55.344 - 00:55:59.354, Speaker D: I saw him at the same time as you saw him. He seems to be just he's chilling.
00:55:59.482 - 00:56:03.850, Speaker A: No, Arthur is want. I don't say that with anything but love for Arthur.
00:56:03.930 - 00:56:58.960, Speaker B: He's great, and he's authentic, and I really respect that about him. And I don't know, it's interesting listening to him, and it can be fun, and I admire that he says what he thinks, and I think not enough people do that in general, but yeah, no, I think I sort of, like, approach it more from the perspective I don't know, let's sit down. Let's think about what makes sense for society, what makes sense, what's the right thing to do here? What's the appropriate action, and then let's do that thing. And I think that turns out to have come out in a very different place on regulatory matters than I think Arthur did. But it's not because I was born hating that or something like that and sort of know, seems like some regulatory provisions to be healthy. Seems kind of dumb to go to war over that. Let's try and work constructive regulators that build a regulatory environment that achieves 80% of everyone's goals or something like that.
00:56:58.960 - 00:57:04.666, Speaker B: My takeaway on that is not very blustery. It's not very sexy.
00:57:04.698 - 00:57:17.286, Speaker A: I don't no, it's it's great. Smoking like a true shape rotator. That's right. Okay. All right, well, on that note, Sam, we're going to have to lose you one last time because. It's time for us to sign off. All right.
00:57:17.286 - 00:57:19.140, Speaker A: Thanks, everybody. We'll be back in a couple of weeks.
