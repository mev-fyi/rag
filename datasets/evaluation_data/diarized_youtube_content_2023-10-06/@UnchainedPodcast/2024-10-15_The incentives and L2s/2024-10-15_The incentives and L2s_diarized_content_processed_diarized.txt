00:00:00.400 - 00:00:41.921, Speaker A: Almost in every single cases, human decisions are driven by incentives and the incentives are just not there for the Layer two to give back all this value they are capturing back to Ethereum. Because unless you own what, 5% of Ethereum supply, why would you care? I mean, you care more about your Layer two token. And I think that there is also kind of a bit of existential question for all the layer 2 token as well. I mean, so and it's completely fair for the Layer two team to prioritize their Layer two token over Ethereum. You have kind of seen the new Layer two, their valuation have kind of started to hit lower and lower. I mean, we used to see L2 token launching at 10 billion on a fully diluted basis. And I think scroll was launching at 1.2.
00:00:41.921 - 00:00:49.185, Speaker A: It was 80%, 80 to 90% lower compared to one and a half year ago for L2 with legitimate tech not using some other stack.
