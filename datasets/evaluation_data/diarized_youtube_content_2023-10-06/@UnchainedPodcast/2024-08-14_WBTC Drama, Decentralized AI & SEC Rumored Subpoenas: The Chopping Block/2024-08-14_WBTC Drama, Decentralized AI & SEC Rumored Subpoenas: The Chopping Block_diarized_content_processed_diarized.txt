00:00:00.160 - 00:00:09.478, Speaker A: I gotta say, that's a fall from grace to go from, like, you're getting your company acquired from a few multibillion dollars to I have to go in the maker governance form.
00:00:09.534 - 00:00:11.758, Speaker B: That's just, like, not a dividend.
00:00:11.854 - 00:00:12.958, Speaker A: It's a tale of tuan.
00:00:13.014 - 00:00:15.686, Speaker C: Now. Your losses are on someone else's balance sheet.
00:00:15.758 - 00:00:18.254, Speaker B: Generally speaking, airdrops are kind of pointless anyways.
00:00:18.422 - 00:00:21.182, Speaker C: Unnamed trading firms who are very involved.
00:00:21.286 - 00:00:21.814, Speaker B: I like that.
00:00:21.862 - 00:00:23.350, Speaker A: ETH is the ultimate possibility.
00:00:23.430 - 00:00:37.596, Speaker C: Defi protocols are the antidote to this problem. All right. Hello, everybody. Welcome to the chopping block. Every couple of weeks, the four of us get together and give the industry insider's perspective on the crypto topics of the day. So, quick intros. First, we've got Tom, the Defi maven and master of memes.
00:00:37.668 - 00:00:38.520, Speaker B: Hello, everyone.
00:00:38.820 - 00:00:41.964, Speaker C: And we've got Tarun, the Giga brain and grand poobah at Gauntlet.
00:00:42.052 - 00:00:42.760, Speaker A: Yo.
00:00:43.060 - 00:00:47.796, Speaker C: And joining us today, special guest, we have brother Bing, who is the heiress of Hotpoddao.
00:00:47.908 - 00:00:49.116, Speaker D: What's up, guys?
00:00:49.308 - 00:01:04.300, Speaker C: And then I'm Haseeb, the head hype man at Dragonfly. So we're osage investors in crypto, but I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice, legal advice, or even life advice. Lisa chopping block XYZ for more disclosures. So. Okay, brother Bing, first of all, what is the backstory on Brother Bing?
00:01:04.460 - 00:01:31.980, Speaker D: Yeah, so my name is Xu Yao. Real name. I don't know if you guys realize. Well, remember in 2020 Defi Summer, there were a bunch of guys who were psyop seeing as ghosts on Twitter. So then I thought, why don't I do the opposite? I'm a girl that self sing as a dude on Twitter. Then it bother Bing. But also, I'm from Beijing, and the Beijing girls tend to be very bro ish.
00:01:31.980 - 00:01:32.828, Speaker D: So then I.
00:01:32.844 - 00:01:33.396, Speaker C: Is that right?
00:01:33.468 - 00:01:36.820, Speaker D: Yeah. So, bro bing. Bing. Sometimes people call me bro bing bing.
00:01:36.900 - 00:01:37.684, Speaker C: Yeah, I dig it.
00:01:37.732 - 00:01:41.760, Speaker A: Did you lean into your character and become the character you started as?
00:01:42.060 - 00:01:46.870, Speaker D: Yeah. You have to cultivate it. So now it's getting really prominent.
00:01:46.950 - 00:01:50.534, Speaker B: Give the listeners some context. What does Bing mean here? Why bing?
00:01:50.662 - 00:02:21.436, Speaker D: Yeah, so the search engine, right? Yeah, actually. So dabing actually has some meaning in chinese, dabing means big pancake, and that's actually how chinese community call bitcoin. Bitcoin is a giant orange pancake. So I used to have a column with decrypt where I used to write about crypto stuff and crypto in China. So my editor was like, what's your column's name? I would be like, oh, it's dabbing. And then I just took the name on.
00:02:21.548 - 00:02:35.052, Speaker C: I like that. I like that. So besides being the hot pot dao heiress, you are also a co founder of Mega ETH. It's a project that a lot of people are talking about. You guys are making a lot of buzz and getting a lot of hype. I think a lot of people maybe don't know what Mega Eth is.
00:02:35.076 - 00:02:37.460, Speaker A: They've heard the name, they know it's a fashion brand.
00:02:37.540 - 00:02:37.844, Speaker C: Yes.
00:02:37.892 - 00:02:38.644, Speaker A: At the least.
00:02:38.772 - 00:02:47.476, Speaker C: At the least, it's memetically very powerful. But what exactly is Mega Ethan? The sort of elevator room, two sentence explanation.
00:02:47.548 - 00:03:10.172, Speaker D: Yeah, absolutely. Mega ETH is the first real time blockchain. By inheriting ethereum security and decentralization, we're able to create an execution environment that not only has super high throughput, aka 100,000 tps, but also extremely low latency. Think about some millisecond. Hence the real timeness. This has never been done before. In crypto.
00:03:10.172 - 00:03:25.650, Speaker D: We are extremely excited about our protocol, but more importantly, we're extremely excited about the application that's going to be built on mega ETH because we believe that they are pairing the web two performance with crypto economics and the P two P network.
00:03:25.770 - 00:03:29.642, Speaker C: Yeah. And mega ETH, notably, is a L2 and is an EVM based layer.
00:03:29.666 - 00:03:31.226, Speaker D: Two, which is, well, the first real time blockchain.
00:03:31.258 - 00:03:55.714, Speaker C: What's the first real time blockchain, which is a EVM based L2. You are relatively unique person because I think you're one of the most global people I know. It used to be global head of BD at consensus. Is that right? And you've split your time. I mean, obviously you come from China. You spent a lot of time in the US in New York, then you're now in Dubai. You've kind of been a globetrotter for as long as I've known you.
00:03:55.714 - 00:03:58.722, Speaker C: And you run this thing called Hotpoddao.
00:03:58.826 - 00:03:59.226, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:03:59.298 - 00:04:00.618, Speaker C: What is hotpoddao?
00:04:00.794 - 00:04:01.778, Speaker D: Yeah, it's a cult.
00:04:01.874 - 00:04:03.394, Speaker C: It's a cult. Okay, go on.
00:04:03.442 - 00:04:20.152, Speaker D: It's a food based cult. It's better than 2020 food defi coins. Um, so I started help pal Dao in 2020. Back then there was a conference called AmcOn. Anyone remember McCon? It was a conference for Dell. Back then when Dao was cool.
00:04:20.296 - 00:04:21.056, Speaker C: That did not age well.
00:04:21.088 - 00:04:44.650, Speaker D: That did not age well. So I was, you know, running BDI, consensus and anything new, it just poked my interest. So I went to Denver and it's, you know, it's a very small conference, and in the middle you. There's no asian food after three days. And I was just, like, gonna fucking kill myself. I can't eat another sandwich or more meat. So I was, like, hanging out in the cafe with a bunch of people.
00:04:44.650 - 00:05:08.394, Speaker D: The pseudoswap guys were there, some dudes from polychain. I was just like, yo, guys, anyone wants to go for hotpot? And people were so excited about it. And I googled this hot pot place, which was like 30 minutes away in the middle of nowhere. We thought, we're gonna get kidnapped. So we all went there. We had hot potential, and I just joked. I was like, oh, you know what? This is the first hot pot dial.
00:05:08.394 - 00:05:28.950, Speaker D: And it really works because I really hate crypto networking. I hate stepping into a room, really noisy. You're like trying to hold your drink. You don't really want to drink. You don't know who to have a conversation with. But with hotpot, right, you just sit down, you eat your food, you talk about life. So I think it's a really easy way to make friends.
00:05:28.950 - 00:06:12.836, Speaker D: So the first one was in Denver in 2020, but after that, I basically have been running hotpot dot in every conference I go to, places I visit. And hot powdow is actually extremely decentralized right now. I say it's only dealt with product market fit because actually I used to have people who willing to pay me to come to hotpota because it's just like the most popular event. But we also have DAo member who are hosting hotpot dot all over the world. So a really strong chapter in Hong Kong, Singapore, we have one in Thailand. They just started without letting me know, and they were like, yo, can we use your brand? I was like, do it. We have a very strong one in New York.
00:06:12.836 - 00:06:29.516, Speaker D: It's founded by Dan from Eigen Lair. And he just, like, rents out this hot pot restaurant, have everybody come in a free flow of hotpot cream, barbecue, alcohol as well. So, yeah, I don't even know what's happening with hot pot at the moment. I've been sufficiently decentralized.
00:06:29.588 - 00:06:31.612, Speaker C: Yeah, very nice. Very nice. Okay.
00:06:31.636 - 00:06:31.820, Speaker D: Wow.
00:06:31.860 - 00:06:39.114, Speaker A: Well, I also think it's funny that this was the year that a hot pot company ipo'd on NYSE, right?
00:06:39.162 - 00:06:39.858, Speaker B: Yeah. Heidi Lao.
00:06:39.914 - 00:06:43.310, Speaker A: Yeah. And they're in New York now, which is crazy.
00:06:43.930 - 00:06:45.194, Speaker B: So you're the hot pot.
00:06:45.362 - 00:06:56.298, Speaker C: Well, no, I wanted to make it to the hotbot Dao event, but apparently I wasn't cool enough and it was denied Dao membership. So fortunately, it looks like it's very. You were right. It's very difficult to attend gethot hotbot.
00:06:56.314 - 00:07:00.122, Speaker A: Dave, I think it's a sign you may have to change your aesthetic a little bit.
00:07:00.266 - 00:07:21.470, Speaker C: I know, I know. The wrong kind of asian, apparently, to get into hot podao. Okay, so we are wrapping up the week of SBC. SBC was last week. We got some interesting commentary from. But I'd love to get some reflections from everybody on what you thought of SBC. Last week, we said that SBC had rebranded a science of blockchain and that it was a very cringy rebrand.
00:07:21.470 - 00:07:46.460, Speaker C: The SBC team apparently was not thrilled to hear that. We thought it was very cringey. And they also moved to clarify that it is now being shared. It's being rotated between New York with Cornell Tech, which is associated with IC three, and then Stanford and Berkeley are the three universities that it's going to rotate. So it's actually going back to Berkeley next year. It's not staying in New York. So, signs of blockchain conference to ruin.
00:07:46.460 - 00:07:50.620, Speaker C: What's your feeling now that the conference is wrapped up? Any reflections?
00:07:52.690 - 00:08:32.402, Speaker A: I think there was a time in 20 18, 20, 19, 20 20 where it was more of a place where people would come with new research and it'd be like, oh, this is the new ZK algorithm that has a speed up, or this new consensus protocol matters. But I think in the world in 2024, bluntly speaking, I don't think there's that much left in consensus. It feels like people are extracting very tiny improvements. So it's like, all right, there's not that much there. And then that, too. The side events for consensus have better kind of more relevant research. SBC feels a little stale and slow.
00:08:32.402 - 00:09:00.972, Speaker A: I think in academic conferences, this is often the case that that happens where a conference gets too big or kind of stale and a new one shows up. I think the weird part about SBC is, like, there seem to be too many. Like, not. No one even seems to watch the research talks anymore. And also, 90% of the research feels like, I read it six months ago or was online six months ago, and so it feels a little dated. Like, I feel like when it was.
00:09:01.036 - 00:09:07.180, Speaker C: Also true at academic conferences that, like, you. You post the preprint before you ever show up for a conference. Everyone reads it first, for sure.
00:09:07.220 - 00:09:27.130, Speaker A: But I think there's something weird about this conference. Like, it used to feel like there's a tighter loop. Oftentimes, a lot of people post preprints when they get in to a conference or if they don't get in whatever at that time. But somehow SBC just feels like it's dated. And it also doesn't really represent applications very well.
00:09:27.550 - 00:09:29.598, Speaker C: It's not supposed to. I think it's a research conference.
00:09:29.654 - 00:09:35.238, Speaker A: No, but there's research on applications like DeFi research. Right. Like, very underrepresented there.
00:09:35.294 - 00:09:40.582, Speaker C: Okay, so let's say that you were to start the successor to SBC. SPC is already old habits.
00:09:40.606 - 00:09:49.158, Speaker A: Is this a hypothetical thing or hypothetical thing I have done? Oh, I did start a sort of DeFi research conference that we had our first one in May.
00:09:49.214 - 00:09:49.934, Speaker C: What's it called?
00:09:50.062 - 00:10:12.904, Speaker A: TLDR, which is the latest in DeFi research. But the other thing about SBC is there is all these side events. Like, there's the application summit, there's a consensus summit, there's Mev. And those were much more in the know. I feel like it reminds me of music festivals, right? You go to music festival, it's awesome. And then you go the next year, and it's like, yeah, okay, a little less awesome. Like some of your favorite artists.
00:10:12.904 - 00:10:37.580, Speaker A: Like, nah, that place is boring. Sucks not going. And then you go the third time, and it's like, oh, okay, now it's, like, too commercial. And then you find out that there's some after hours outside that, like, is, like, now much more interesting creatively than the main conference. And then all of a sudden, you start going to that, and you don't go to the mainland. Like, I feel like that SVC has gone through the music festival cycle. That's just my.
00:10:39.520 - 00:10:43.296, Speaker C: That explains a lot of the people who are coming and showing up to SBC every year. Is it?
00:10:43.368 - 00:10:49.672, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, I feel like it's also funny because there's, like, so many more investors and researchers there, which already tells you it's, like, over.
00:10:49.856 - 00:11:00.738, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, the fact that, like, I show up to anything at SBC, and I get so many people pitching me, trying to raise money, I'm like, okay, this is not an academic. This is not an academic event.
00:11:00.794 - 00:11:20.386, Speaker A: Yeah, it was funny because I went from SBC to this zero Knowledge podcast that. This other podcast that I'm on. So I guess, sorry, listeners, for talking about this. It's like a more research conference. I went to the hackathon in Montreal, and there was literally zero investors. It was, like, all. It was actually funny.
00:11:20.386 - 00:11:30.820, Speaker A: The winning hackathon project was something where you could breathalyze yourself and prove in zero knowledge that, you know, you were not drunk.
00:11:30.900 - 00:11:33.280, Speaker C: This is what happens when you have no investors present.
00:11:33.940 - 00:11:49.470, Speaker A: It's not commercial, but it was like people did fun, crazy shit like that. So there's. That's what I'm saying. I feel like SBC had that in 20, you know, back in the 2015 to 2020 era, and then post pandemic, it just hasn't kind of not the same.
00:11:49.660 - 00:11:52.082, Speaker C: Yeah. Reflections, SBC.
00:11:52.266 - 00:12:14.842, Speaker B: Yeah, I kind of know what you mean. I did notice some of the papers were, like, from, like, 2023. And I was like, it's been a while, but I don't know. I feel like at these conferences too, like, most of it is kind of. You said it's like meeting people and networking and kind of seeing, like, for us portfolio companies. And so even at, like, non academic conferences, I'm still not even really attending the talks and kind of going and seeing people. So I feel like there hasn't actually been that much of a change for me.
00:12:14.866 - 00:12:20.706, Speaker A: But the beauty of academic conferences, at least the talk teaches you something. But that was not what I felt like.
00:12:20.778 - 00:12:58.430, Speaker C: I remember the first SBC when it was still called Stanford Blockchain conference. I sat through probably 40% to 50% of the talks and live tweeted notes about all the talks. And I could not imagine that being the best use of my time today. It was a very different time in that there was so much. It's almost like this heroic period. I often read about the heroic period of physics in the thirties and forties, when people were inventing just like, basically what we think of as, like, modern physics in a very small period of time by a very small number of people. And it just felt like science was moving so fast.
00:12:58.430 - 00:13:19.844, Speaker C: And that's kind of how 2017 2018 felt, is that there were so many new ideas and there was so much just uncovering this vast frontier of what was possible with blockchains. And today it just doesn't feel like that. And that's normal, right? But like, yeah, it just the excitement of sitting and being like, I wonder what I learned today. I haven't felt that in a very long time.
00:13:19.852 - 00:13:29.132, Speaker A: To Shiel's point, though, in her intro, like, I do think the application side is more interesting, which is why I think the infrastructure conferences kind of suck now, to be honest.
00:13:29.236 - 00:13:31.226, Speaker C: Yeah. What's your take on that?
00:13:31.228 - 00:13:32.340, Speaker D: That would be my point, actually.
00:13:32.420 - 00:13:35.960, Speaker A: I. Sorry for frontrunning. You. Sorry for frontrunning.
00:13:37.460 - 00:13:57.440, Speaker D: Actually. I really. I enjoyed the previous SVC as well. But this one, I think I came, I went with a different identity. I was hunting for application builders, so I didn't. I stopped by the actual conference, but I went to this one called bas blockchain application summit. I walked in, there was no application.
00:13:57.440 - 00:14:15.592, Speaker D: You know, you look at the talk and all that, there's just no application. So I feel like we're in the awkward space of the underlying technology. Innovation is not that exciting. There's nothing groundbreaking, but you also don't get really exciting. Application, everybody.
00:14:15.616 - 00:14:17.700, Speaker C: There was an l one looking for application.
00:14:18.160 - 00:14:19.928, Speaker D: We're just trying to be each other.
00:14:20.024 - 00:14:20.820, Speaker C: I see.
00:14:21.280 - 00:14:47.080, Speaker D: But on the bright side, I do think that, because this year is in New York, gives me a very good intro into the New York builder scene. At the conference, I got to meet fresh college graduates who are really open to ideas. So they're not builders yet, so that was just tremendously helpful to us. And then I think the side events were met. I just.
00:14:47.200 - 00:14:48.656, Speaker C: Anyone you want to call out?
00:14:48.848 - 00:14:50.136, Speaker A: Yeah, who are you calling out?
00:14:50.168 - 00:14:51.780, Speaker D: The one that I saw you at.
00:14:54.040 - 00:14:56.176, Speaker C: Wait, which one is this? Come on, you gotta. Which one?
00:14:56.208 - 00:14:57.048, Speaker A: I went to a bunch.
00:14:57.104 - 00:15:02.140, Speaker D: It's the same speakers going to different side events, which is the same thing.
00:15:02.440 - 00:15:12.918, Speaker A: I will say. There was only one of them that I actually presented a new research at. The other ones were, like, recycled. Yeah. Tells you something.
00:15:13.054 - 00:15:13.770, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:15:14.310 - 00:15:18.326, Speaker A: The one with new research also had, like, 20 people, so, you know.
00:15:18.478 - 00:15:19.014, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:15:19.102 - 00:15:21.014, Speaker A: For better or worse. That's just how it is.
00:15:21.142 - 00:15:30.294, Speaker D: Yeah. But, yeah. Yeah. I think, in general, I would say SBC is still a much better conference quality than many others in other parts of the world.
00:15:30.342 - 00:15:53.360, Speaker A: One thing I would say, there were a lot more undergrads, to your point, at this conference this year than I think I saw, even in, like, 2022, 2021. I kind of feel like the AI fatigue is, like, undergrads are actually coming back, which is, like, an interesting. Last year, I feel like it was, like, no undergrads.
00:15:53.900 - 00:16:05.400, Speaker C: Last year was, like, peak AI hype is such that you could be moderately technical and raise money for a seed round of, like, AI for dentistry or whatever, you know, some stupid tattoo between.
00:16:09.440 - 00:16:11.024, Speaker A: A identical girlfriend.
00:16:11.112 - 00:16:37.234, Speaker C: Yes. But that phase has very much ended. Right. The ability for, like, a random Stanford grad or Columbia grad to just go raise, like, $5 million to do some random chattypt wrapper. Like, that's very much done. And so I think the reality that's setting in for a lot of folks who are entrepreneurial and just graduated from college is they realize in AI, like, I. It's very unlikely you're gonna be able to contribute anything because requires, like, either PhD level contributions to a foundation model, which is very.
00:16:37.234 - 00:16:56.142, Speaker C: Already. That's even hard because all these foundation models are crashing and burning and they're just rapidly depreciating assets that can only be funded by huge companies. Or you like, pick the exact right vertical and have this full court press, like legal tragedy for law or whatever, this kind of thing.
00:16:56.326 - 00:17:02.198, Speaker A: This reminds me, somehow you have become influenza for decentralized AI.
00:17:02.254 - 00:17:42.918, Speaker C: Tell us how this happened to. Yeah, okay, this is also a little bit strange to me. I was just talking with brother Bing before we started rolling. So, I mean, I've been learning a lot about AI over the last couple of years because crypto was doing pretty slow in the bear market and obviously AI was. I think it's pretty obvious that what's happening right now with large language models is one of the most important technology shifts in the last decade. Naturally, I spent a lot of time learning about it, studying it, and learning something about machine learning which I wasn't super knowledgeable about before. Once all the decentralized AI stuff started getting hot, I wanted to learn about it.
00:17:42.918 - 00:18:37.540, Speaker C: And the way that I generally learn about a new space is I write about it, because if I write about something and I'm forced to teach other people, then I have to understand it better in order to communicate effectively. I decided, okay, I'm going to write an overview of decentralized AI because I keep getting these pitches and I don't really understand what they're all doing and what the landscape is. And so I wrote a piece and the piece went moderately viral, and then consensus. I gave a talk, basically just summarizing the piece, and that talk went fairly viral. The thing that struck me most of all is that it's not a very complex space if you know just the basics of machine learning. A lot of investors who are investing in the space do not have that, even that level of understanding of what the hell is going on in the space. And you can kind of see it from the way that a lot of projects are getting funded, is that the VC's who are funding this stuff are just embarrassingly ignorant of what's happening in the space.
00:18:37.540 - 00:19:04.744, Speaker C: And so I don't know how I became a decentralized AI influence. That's literally it. That's all I've done is just wrote one blog post. But that's enough right now in the space in order to get a lot of respect from, from founders and builders. So yeah, I don't consider myself an expert by any means, but relative to VC's, it reminds me a lot of when I first got into crypto VC, which is, I mean, this was like early 2018. I remember I just, you were at.
00:19:04.752 - 00:19:06.520, Speaker A: A fund that only invested in L.
00:19:06.560 - 00:19:11.472, Speaker C: One S. That was most of what there was at that time. I mean, what else was there in 2018?
00:19:11.576 - 00:19:12.500, Speaker A: Xerox.
00:19:13.240 - 00:19:14.300, Speaker C: Yeah, true.
00:19:14.800 - 00:19:16.280, Speaker A: Well, you were working there, right?
00:19:16.320 - 00:19:19.248, Speaker C: Yeah. I mean, Zero X was like one of the few applications that had a token.
00:19:19.264 - 00:19:21.016, Speaker A: At that time, I was just, I couldn't think of anything.
00:19:21.048 - 00:19:25.588, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, it was like I owe, there was litecoin ripple. That was the landscape.
00:19:25.644 - 00:19:29.228, Speaker A: Say two more times, Eric Wall is going to bust through this wall and punch you.
00:19:29.284 - 00:19:46.236, Speaker C: Yeah. And so I just started as a crypto VC. And I remember I went to my, I was so nervous. I had so much imposter syndrome about how I know nothing. I just came into this industry. How could I possibly become an investor and give advice to founders and judge their products? I don't know shit.
00:19:46.308 - 00:19:47.468, Speaker D: Welcome to the industry.
00:19:47.604 - 00:20:13.086, Speaker C: I know, I know. And so I remember I went to my first investor dinner and I met a bunch of other investors and we were just talking about whatever's going on in the industry. And after that dinner, I was like, nevermind, I'm totally fine. The level I thought I knew nothing. And then I was like, wait, these investors don't even know nothing. That was the thing that ultimately gave me confidence to be able to say, okay, you know what? Yeah, I don't know as much as these guys.
00:20:13.118 - 00:20:20.050, Speaker A: I really respect there are any decentralized AI investments that will be successful of the current.
00:20:21.190 - 00:21:16.506, Speaker C: I mean, I think it's quite, so first thing I'll say is that projects, I expect them all to evolve, right? I don't think anybody is going to be able to. When I describe these sort of frontier type networks, it's very much like Christopher Columbus saying, okay, I'm going to go find India, and then he just goes and starts sailing. And almost certainly your path when you're sailing through uncharted waters where no one knows where the demand is, no one knows where the product market fit is, almost certainly it's going to change as you keep going. So if you look at something like Nier or even Solana, right, they've changed really dramatically from what the original description of the project was of originally, how it was supposed to work. And they iterate and they move more in the direction of, here's where the demand is, here's what people want, here are all the things that people are complaining about that we have to address over time. And I think a lot of these gen one crypto AI projects will eventually do that. They will respond to demand and they will sort of fix the broken incentives and so on.
00:21:16.506 - 00:21:47.732, Speaker C: Some of them won't, some of them won't figure it out in time, and some of them were just too early, and they end up becoming these stepping stones that other people will jump on top of. But I do think there is something at this intersection, but it has to be cost efficient, has to actually be useful to people, and it has to plug into demand. And that's the thing that right now is missing on most of these crypto AI startups, is that they just make no contact with the demand side. It's all aggregating supply and aggregating supply without actually tapping into demand. A trap that we've fallen into crypto over and over and over again.
00:21:47.836 - 00:21:49.844, Speaker A: I mean, they've fallen into it in AI.
00:21:50.012 - 00:22:20.334, Speaker C: Oh, yeah. To be clear. But if you look at the, like, if you look at the GPU marketplaces, right, and you compare them to like, you know, you guys are investors in together, like together or lambda or core weave, like, there's not a demand problem on those businesses, right? Those businesses can barely serve the demand they're getting. But the opposite is true in crypto land, which tells us, okay, there's a, there's a real problem that can be solved with a better product, but that product is not yet forthcoming, and there's a lot of work to figure out how to create that product that can stand toe to toe with those other.
00:22:20.382 - 00:22:44.288, Speaker A: I mean, there's a lot of adverse selection in the crypto training networks. I feel like there's also this problem of, like, AI is inherently better in some ways when centralized. Like, it's easier to have centralized data provisioning. You can do things like rag, which is like, impossible to do when you try to decentralize. Like, I think that's why I was curious what your take on the business.
00:22:44.384 - 00:23:24.804, Speaker C: Yeah, I completely agree with you. Is that going after use cases that are not well served by a decentralized network is going to result in failure. You have to find what is the niche that my different market structure. And the other thing too, that you can't underestimate is that demand often increases in response to changes in the underlying world, right? So one example of this is Dai, right? Dai demand changed dramatically when you started to see more and more blacklisting from decentralized stablecoins. And the same thing, I think is likely to happen with AI. We're very, very early into the intersection of AI and geopolitics.
00:23:24.932 - 00:23:29.996, Speaker A: Never forget that Richard heart was once the largest die holder might still be, I think.
00:23:30.188 - 00:23:40.004, Speaker B: What's the name of the not haggles, like his, like, defi thing, like pulse. I think it might still be the largest die holder, actually. That's crazy.
00:23:40.172 - 00:23:41.596, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah.
00:23:41.668 - 00:23:43.652, Speaker A: It's somewhat embarrassing fact, right?
00:23:43.716 - 00:24:14.664, Speaker C: And like, well, my point is that as AI inevitably is gonna become politicized and inevitably there's going to be large fights. I mean, you already see it in China, right? There was an article I was reading in China talking about how in order to launch an AI product in China, the party basically has like, essentially these like, challenge response pairs that's like, okay, I will ask you like 100 politically sensitive questions, and you must, like, not answer 100 of them or like 95 of them in order for you to be eligible to, like, go public with your AI product.
00:24:14.712 - 00:24:17.620, Speaker A: Forget about China, though. I feel like Europe is going to be the first place.
00:24:19.520 - 00:24:37.630, Speaker C: China's already there, right. Europe is trying to join China as fast as they can, and then, I mean, we'll see what happens in the US. And I think it really, none of this stuff is predetermined, you know, I think it is really just the people in power and the way in which politics plays out as to how technologies get regulated. So I don't think there's any predestination in any of this.
00:24:38.050 - 00:24:41.266, Speaker D: So banker is not pivot to be AI crypto coin?
00:24:41.338 - 00:24:44.802, Speaker C: Not yet, not yet. Pick your spot. Pick your spot.
00:24:44.866 - 00:24:48.906, Speaker A: No, no. But you should attract those projects because that's transaction fee demand.
00:24:49.018 - 00:25:01.110, Speaker D: Yes. I'm a seller of blockspace, actually. We work with a few crypto AI projects. And I think the problem describe, everyone knows about it. It's like people pretend that they don't exist.
00:25:01.270 - 00:25:02.410, Speaker C: That is a big thing.
00:25:03.110 - 00:25:05.958, Speaker D: It's bothering me sometimes I feel like.
00:25:05.974 - 00:25:11.810, Speaker A: They should just go be selling in Europe and China to all these people who are like, I'm banned from using XYZ.
00:25:12.110 - 00:25:24.392, Speaker C: Yeah, you are kind of competing with just VPN's, though, which is also a pretty good product. But in China, they're increasingly difficult to get your hands on. And Europe is still pretty easy to VPN, but in China, obviously, I mean, you know this very well, so.
00:25:24.496 - 00:25:45.384, Speaker A: Yeah, I feel like in Europe, though, they're actually systematically trying to ban even using like, the kind of models within Google and stuff. Right? Like they're getting mad at the big players. So your web browsing experience might look very different in Europe in like six months, to the point that you get such different results that you might use a different search engine.
00:25:45.512 - 00:26:09.366, Speaker C: I could see that. I could see that. Um, so, okay, so let's get into some news. There's been some drama this week over WBTC. So we don't talk a lot about WBTC on the show, but WBTC, for those of you who don't know it, is a tokenized version of bitcoin that originally was custodied by Bitco. So bitco, you know, very well known custodian in the space. Uh, and WBTC has kind of been a defi stalwart.
00:26:09.366 - 00:26:21.842, Speaker C: So sort of imagine it like tether, but for bitcoin where basically literally they, you know, it's not a fancy, decentralized blah blah blah thing. They just keep the bitcoin in a multisig. And, you know, bitgo is like, yo, we're good for it. Regulated just like circle or tether.
00:26:21.906 - 00:26:56.780, Speaker A: It is one very important difference from tether because it was founded by consortium that there were multiple minters. So it wasn't just one company, which I think was like, why? People were much more comfortable with it because I remember people in Defi used to fight about, oh, like, could we even list WbTC even though it has so much liquidity on uniswap? Like, you know, like the early compound Dao government's fights over WBTC were so incredible. And this, this tiny thing of having the consortium over minting was the reason it got listed. And tethernet wasn't was like. And that was like what they drew the line at.
00:26:56.820 - 00:27:04.348, Speaker C: Who is in the consort? I know coinless was in there. Who else? Yeah, I was gonna say that, but I was like, wait, that doesn't make sense. But I guess they were.
00:27:04.404 - 00:27:09.300, Speaker B: Yeah, well, there's also different roles. There's like Minter and there's like broker and there's something else.
00:27:09.340 - 00:27:12.140, Speaker A: So it was the first intent based.
00:27:12.260 - 00:27:14.640, Speaker C: Yeah, okay, very nice.
00:27:15.040 - 00:27:26.056, Speaker A: It's all these, like, doesn't have a token. All these intent. People who just joined crypto since that era just like missed out on all the fights that are exactly the same as the fights that they're having now.
00:27:26.128 - 00:27:45.006, Speaker C: Yeah, well, what's old is new anyway. Okay, so wbtc, the OG bitcoin rap or the bitcoin peg on ethereum? Uh, on August 9, bitcoin announced that they were going to move WDBTC to become multi jurisdictional custody, starting a joint venture in Hong Kong in partnership with Justin sun.
00:27:45.118 - 00:27:47.478, Speaker A: Wait, wait, wait. Technically with BitGlobal.
00:27:47.534 - 00:28:18.248, Speaker C: With bitglobal? Yeah, bit Global, which is a company that has some affiliation with Justin sun. Not super clear, is there's an ownership structure or whatever. None of this has been disclosed exactly, but they made very clear in their talks in public and in the governance forums that Justin sun is affiliated with this endeavor in a way that has not been yet specified. So Justin sun, of course, the founder of Tron, somebody who's had, you know, occasional legal troubles, maybe regular legal troubles and also a diplomat, former diplomat. Okay. Yeah, his Royal Highness. What is it?
00:28:18.264 - 00:28:19.432, Speaker A: But I thought it got taken away.
00:28:19.536 - 00:28:20.056, Speaker C: Did it?
00:28:20.128 - 00:28:21.940, Speaker D: Cause it has an expiration date.
00:28:23.320 - 00:28:29.248, Speaker A: But Tron USDT hit the highest monthly volume ever in volume transferred.
00:28:29.424 - 00:28:30.872, Speaker C: Okay. And Tron has been doing quite well.
00:28:30.936 - 00:28:56.554, Speaker A: Tron USDT has been. For all of the potential negatives about Justin sun, there are two very big positives which I think people forget USDT on. Tron is actually used in the real world and he's the biggest restaker. So, you know, his liquidity itself, his liquidity in DeFi is like. Is liquidity incarnate. He is liquidity as a person.
00:28:56.642 - 00:29:19.136, Speaker C: Yeah. Okay. So, all right, so Justin sun is going to be affiliated now with this new WBTC transfer and of course WBTC. Just to give you a sense of scale, WTC has about $9.2 billion circulating of WBTC on Ethereum and it's got a big presence in DeFi. It's in Aave, it's in compound, it's in maker. More than 30% of WBTC is held just in those four protocols.
00:29:19.136 - 00:30:13.964, Speaker C: So on August 10, the day later, Monet supply, who's a very active governance person in the maker ecosystem, he proposed to offboard WBTC as collateral on Maker. And this has caused kind of a firestorm of controversy of should, is this an overreaction? Should makerdao off board WBTC? This kind of caused a downstream question to also be asked in Aave. I think Aave is pressing pause and saying we'll decide in a couple of months after seeing how things play out. So the proposal is not to eliminate all of the current loans, but basically to prevent any new loans from being drawn against WBTC. But right now, Dai, how much Dai? There's $150 million of Daiden. I'm sorry, 150 million die of, out of 5 billion of total die circulating that's minted against WBTC. So it's significant, but it would not be catastrophic to make her to off board WBTC as collateral in that ecosystem.
00:30:13.964 - 00:30:34.782, Speaker C: But Mike Belshi, who's the CEO of Bitco, was in the governance forums arguing, hey, this is a big nothing burger. Everything's okay. Like we're happy to have you get an attorney and come in and diligence this stuff, but we're not going to tell you in public how it all works. And so there's a lot of sniping and going back and forth and kind of some of the messy internals of crypto are being.
00:30:34.966 - 00:30:49.302, Speaker A: I got to say, that's a fall from grace to go from like, you're getting your company acquired from a few multibillion dollars to I have to go in the maker governance forum. That's like a real, real fall for me.
00:30:49.486 - 00:30:54.094, Speaker C: It is always a tough look when somebody comes to ingratiate themselves to a governance forum.
00:30:54.142 - 00:30:57.622, Speaker A: I really do and has never been, you know, it's like the first and first person.
00:30:57.646 - 00:30:59.490, Speaker C: Yeah, that's true. That's true.
00:30:59.550 - 00:31:00.826, Speaker A: Whenever you see that, you're a little.
00:31:00.938 - 00:31:03.514, Speaker C: We never want to do your first post in a governance forum. That's always a bad day.
00:31:03.562 - 00:31:22.346, Speaker B: I actually love those. Or even when people are duking it out on crypto Twitter, because so often it's with like an anon with a ridiculous name, like herpes Cat was going back and forth with Mike Belshi on the maker forum. And so I'm like, surely Mike has better things to be doing with his time other than duking it out with herpes cat on the nature of WBT and maker. But there you go.
00:31:22.418 - 00:31:26.564, Speaker A: I mean, yeah, you gotta feel bad for him. Failed acquisition. Just really.
00:31:26.612 - 00:31:33.000, Speaker D: Was that rumors that the failed acquisition because he was not able to provide the audit report.
00:31:33.860 - 00:31:40.788, Speaker A: I agree, but I'm just saying it seemed like it was this close to closing and then somehow very last minute was.
00:31:40.844 - 00:31:44.980, Speaker C: I mean, this was when the market was collapsing. So it's not surprising that they found something.
00:31:45.140 - 00:31:50.914, Speaker A: But the thing is, the deal started in like peak of the bull market right before Luna.
00:31:51.052 - 00:31:58.606, Speaker C: Oh, yeah. I mean, that's how this all. Yeah, I mean, any deal that's drag out while the market is going down 60% is probably not going to close.
00:31:58.678 - 00:31:59.254, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:31:59.382 - 00:32:01.526, Speaker C: You know, at the previous price, especially if there's any cash.
00:32:01.558 - 00:32:20.000, Speaker A: I guess the only one that I remember that happening was the thing that stellar bought in the last cycle. Do you remember they bought watching.com? that was like, that was like one of those that in my memory, I always have these memories of these like particular acquisitions that are very. That tell you a lot about the candor of the market participants.
00:32:20.120 - 00:32:30.464, Speaker C: Right, right. Okay. So, tarun, what's your take on the WBTC drama overblown? Do you think it's reasonable? I mean, it almost feels like a sort of character driven question.
00:32:30.552 - 00:33:16.940, Speaker A: So a lot of this kind of. I would say a lot of the reasons people are a little weary of Justin in lending protocols is there was a centralized stablecoin called True USD, which Justin eventually bought the company that owns the minting function for it. And there was a lot of very weird stuff that happened. They started their own lending protocol. There was this unknown supply showing up from nowhere that they're barring against, and the, the stable coin de pegged a bunch and so people. But a lot of lending protocols still had it. A lot of exchanges had, obviously Huobi had it.
00:33:17.400 - 00:33:22.440, Speaker C: There's also HBTC, which is Huobi's bitcoin peg, which is trading at 26K.
00:33:22.520 - 00:33:53.918, Speaker B: Yeah, I was trying to do some research on this before the show and I couldn't find much, but I was. Do you guys know the backstory on what happened with HBTC? Because it basically started the DPEG, like beginning of this year. And then there was this rumor thread floating around for a while that like, oh, like Justin is looting the coffers of HBTC. But I think that's just like redemptions are turned off. So I don't know what's going on there. But it is seem very weird that something that's supposed to be like a WBTC clone effectively is now like, I.
00:33:53.934 - 00:34:16.220, Speaker A: Mean, every other wrap bitcoin, that's not like TBTC, which is like more decentralized but very hard to get liquidity for. But like you can definitely be sure your bitcoin is there. Yeah, all the other like centralized wrapped bitcoin, not all, but like most have had some crazy deep. I mean, obviously the SOBTC during the FTX collapse was the craziest one because it just like completely de pegged to zero almost.
00:34:16.260 - 00:34:20.000, Speaker C: It's all been kind of sus. And I don't understand why it's so hard to run this business.
00:34:20.700 - 00:34:30.572, Speaker A: Well, this is why I'm like, okay, if they keep the consortium and there's enough other minters and redeemers, I'm a little okay with it, because again, I feel like they do.
00:34:30.596 - 00:34:32.028, Speaker C: I think it's the custody, right?
00:34:32.044 - 00:34:34.252, Speaker A: It's not the mint. That's true.
00:34:34.316 - 00:35:11.856, Speaker B: I was looking so normally with a custodian, they're charging some percentage of Aum and that's sort of their model, obviously, for these wrap bitcoin tokens. They can't really do that because you can't draw down the reserves like it's supposed to be pegged. And so they charge a few bips on mints and redeems and so there is a little bit of a spread when you go and try to trade this thing. But I was looking on, I think DeFi llama had a good chart on total fees earned since inception of HPTC and it was only like twelve mil. So it's really not a very good product to operate. Like you're not making anything. In some ways it's cannibalistic with your existing, maybe better your custody product with better economics.
00:35:11.856 - 00:35:17.080, Speaker B: And so I'm assuming bigger ultra just wants to get rid of this thing. Like it's not a great product line for them.
00:35:17.120 - 00:36:02.758, Speaker A: So I see to be fair that's been true that there has been, there haven't. The other thing of the WBTC versus some of the other derivatives is people tend to mint large positions with it so they pay one fee. It's not like there's like a high volume of fees versus some of the other assets just because of the price of bitcoin. And so the people who are doing it tend to do it at a sufficient size. One thing I will say, maybe if we take a more optimistic view is that all of the people who've been working on these decentralized bitcoin alternatives that basically have just not so far succeeded due to capital efficiency reasons, it's hard to have liquidity for them. They're slower, whatever. All of them have the greatest opportunity in history right now if you look.
00:36:02.774 - 00:36:09.150, Speaker C: At the governance forum, it's all filled with BTC pegged decentralized projects, pitching to maker governance.
00:36:09.190 - 00:36:12.686, Speaker A: All of the restake, BTC, LRT's, they're all going to be there.
00:36:12.798 - 00:36:14.130, Speaker C: Yeah, they're all there.
00:36:14.510 - 00:36:23.010, Speaker A: It's going to be interesting because I do feel like because everyone knows the market is there, there's going to be this mad rush to try to fill the gap.
00:36:23.670 - 00:36:33.624, Speaker C: But on some level what, what WBTC is also telling you is that this market kind of sucks if you're monetizing this way. So you need to find some other way to monetize if you want to run this business.
00:36:33.672 - 00:36:42.304, Speaker A: Well, you don't have to cut in the TBTC type of case, you don't really have to pay the custody costs per se like you pay the initial validator on and off cost, right?
00:36:42.352 - 00:36:45.000, Speaker C: I mean you are paying some, you know, security fee for sure.
00:36:45.120 - 00:36:50.496, Speaker A: You're definitely paying the fee. But yeah, you have a little more kind of flexibility.
00:36:50.608 - 00:36:57.380, Speaker C: Right. But that fee should be in some sense proportional to the total amount outstanding, which is basically a custody fee.
00:36:57.700 - 00:37:03.324, Speaker A: It is a custody fee, but it's one that I think people are probably more willing to.
00:37:03.412 - 00:37:16.132, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. Which is almost a signal, like, if people are willing to off board WBTC, that's maybe a sign of like, hey, bitco, kick out. What is it? Bit global. Big global. Yeah, kick out bit global and just.
00:37:16.156 - 00:37:18.120, Speaker A: Start charging after Blackrock.
00:37:20.460 - 00:37:38.346, Speaker C: I take it back, please don't sue me at Pat Cook. Yeah, so kick out bit global and just say, look, we're going to charge a custody fee and all of a sudden it becomes an amazing business instead of being this like crappy $12 million since deception type of business and you can compete toe to toe with like the TBTCs and the, and the other.
00:37:38.418 - 00:38:14.342, Speaker A: I think the other thing that maybe is worth considering is that when WBTC came out, one of the main advantages of using it was market making. Bitcoin was really inefficient, even between exchanges. But it was very easy to do market making on WBTC because Ethereum transfers are faster. But now you have a million alternatives. Why wouldn't I just use Solana or Tron or anywhere else where there's enough liquidity? So the market making use case, which has high volume, which is high fees for the custodian has gone away. So I think that's the real problem is how do you replace that?
00:38:14.406 - 00:38:32.722, Speaker B: Yeah, if you look at the fee chart, basically it has a nice curve in 2019, 2020, and then it's just been kind of slowly tapering off. And also, obviously there's ways to trade perps in DeFi that there weren't before. And so, yeah, kind of that core use case of bitcoin margin trading exposure in DeFi is also kind of whittled away.
00:38:32.826 - 00:38:45.106, Speaker C: Yeah, I think they just have such a huge liquidity advantage, it feels like a waste to just say, well, our business model doesn't seem to be very good for this environment, so let's just hand off the business, turn into JV and then let them.
00:38:45.138 - 00:38:46.970, Speaker A: Well, they are. That is what they're doing.
00:38:47.050 - 00:39:02.864, Speaker C: No, I was just saying that feels like a strategic mistake, you know, like, it feels like they'd be better off just changing the business model and saying, look, if you want to redeem, here's, here's a winner to redeem. Otherwise it's now going to be an AUC business or an assets under custody business.
00:39:02.952 - 00:39:03.432, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:39:03.536 - 00:39:07.528, Speaker D: So I wonder why Justin wants the business, though. Because he's smart.
00:39:07.584 - 00:39:08.040, Speaker C: I don't want.
00:39:08.080 - 00:39:12.696, Speaker A: No, yes. He loves businesses with lots of collateral on the back.
00:39:12.768 - 00:39:16.858, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. I mean, this is every justice, I believe, lecture USD.
00:39:17.034 - 00:39:34.650, Speaker A: You know, he has a history of this, which is why I think people are afraid. On the other hand, I don't really know. I don't. I don't know enough about Bitgo's current existence, but I'm imagining there's a reason that is. Yeah, they needed to get acquired, and that didn't happen. So now they're.
00:39:34.730 - 00:39:48.058, Speaker D: Someone was saying that bitgo race around after the failed acquisition, and they were saying, oh, there's an asian found that invest in that round. So the speculation is just.
00:39:48.114 - 00:39:54.710, Speaker A: It's just, I mean, honestly, honestly, I like, I like. I like those types of rumors.
00:39:56.850 - 00:39:57.138, Speaker B: But.
00:39:57.154 - 00:40:07.618, Speaker A: But the thing is. The thing is, you know. Yeah, Justin is, you know, might be shameless, but you. There's no way you can say he's not smart. He's one of the smartest on chain users, period.
00:40:07.674 - 00:40:17.468, Speaker C: Yes, yes, yes, he is. He is very sure. He is very shrewd, and we'll see how this plays out so far. I think it was supposed to go to vote today, but I don't think the vote's been concluded yet. So. Still TBD.
00:40:17.524 - 00:40:24.788, Speaker A: There's still a lot of fighting. That forum. The fighting is not forum post is one of the ones where, like, I go to the bathroom, I come back and I get the little bubble that says three unreached.
00:40:24.884 - 00:40:49.722, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's definitely more fighting to be done. So we'll see how this drama plays out. But it's very interesting sort of update in the, in the world of defi dramas. So, speaking of VC's and investors, there was another news story that's been making the rounds about the SEC subpoenaing three crypto VC's. So this story kind of, sort of came as a report on a rumor. So it's not confirmed by anybody.
00:40:49.722 - 00:41:07.946, Speaker C: It's not confirmed by the SEC, not confirmed by VC's, but I can say we've also heard this story about the SEC subpoenaing some crypto funds, and luckily we did not get one such subpoena, or at least not about this. We've gotten subpoenaed before, obviously. Yes, yes. Yet. So who knows? Please don't subpoena us. We'd prefer not to.
00:41:07.978 - 00:41:09.102, Speaker D: Don't be basing New York.
00:41:09.226 - 00:42:00.028, Speaker C: But. So the story here, I think, is getting a little bit subverted by people who don't really understand what the SEC cares about and what kind of things would show up in a subpoena. And so these subpoenas, as far as I understand, and I should make clear, I don't have express knowledge of this, but my understanding is that what's going on is that they're being investigated for becoming statutory underwriters. So what is a statutory underwriter? A statutory underwriter is somebody who basically, normally when a VC invests into a token project in the US, they will have a one year cliff. So they will not invest any tokens before one year. The reason why you do that is that that is an exception to the broker dealer rules that normally require you to be an underwriter in order to sell something before a year. There are certain crypto funds or crypto VC's that may have been selling assets before the one year cliff.
00:42:00.028 - 00:42:34.436, Speaker C: And if they sold an asset before the one year cliff, then they would be liable for these statutory underwriter laws. You don't have a BD license, you're not supposed to be selling things that you bought from insiders. And that supposedly is now, again, this is sort of speculation. I don't know if this is exactly what they're being investigated for, but supposedly this is the story. So this is definitely not everybody who's getting it up about this. Not every VC, because most VC's in the US, especially, especially the institutional ones, very assiduously follow this rule of one year cliff and then multi year Vesta. And that's why that rule is there is because this is a law in the US that the SEC is pretty clear about.
00:42:34.436 - 00:42:54.280, Speaker C: And most investors have followed this rule even without having any enforcement actions for the last five, six years, just because it's the best, most obvious reading of what the law says about tokens, regardless of whether or not you think they're securities. That's the story. I don't know what you guys think about all the speculation that's winding around on Twitter about this.
00:42:55.540 - 00:43:16.748, Speaker B: Like it? Because I like to theorycraft a little bit where a people see subpoena and they think bad thing, when really just a request for information. Everyone has gotten a subpoena. Pretty much it's a request for information. And then two, I think the scope of it was pretty broad. It was all token investments from whatever period of time, which is kind of insane in terms of scope for ask.
00:43:16.804 - 00:43:27.862, Speaker C: But that's how you would dig up, have they done this? Anybody who's gotten a reputation for doing this, for selling tokens early, you'd be like, show me all the tokens you've ever had and all your buys and sells.
00:43:28.046 - 00:43:28.770, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:43:29.590 - 00:43:56.492, Speaker A: So I don't know, but I would be more interested in what time period the person violated this. Was this like, before Luna? Was this in between Luna and FTX? Was after FTX? Because I feel like in those regimes, I can guess, very different actors would have been the ones. Peanut. That's why I like it, because it's like you can now craft to choose your own adventure of.
00:43:56.676 - 00:44:08.124, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, it's very clear before 2017, 2018, this was probably getting violated all the time because people just did not have FBG. Yeah, well, I mean, they're not us regulated, so they're not.
00:44:08.212 - 00:44:09.836, Speaker A: I know, but I definitely.
00:44:09.988 - 00:44:41.340, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So before that, also, just the norms around this stuff were not as well established. Right. So, like, I remember when I first came into the industry, I remember having a conversation with somebody who's now a very prominent founder about they were recruiting me to potentially join their project and they were like, yeah, we want you to be part of the early team for this. And I was like, okay, cool. So what's the vesting? And it's like, vesting? What do you mean vesting? And I'm like, you're not going to have vesting? Shouldn't you have vesting? And it's like, no, no, no. If you sell your tokens early, you're an idiot.
00:44:41.340 - 00:44:58.290, Speaker C: That's the check on selling your tokens early because obviously they're just going to do this. And this was during the bull market, so everything was doing this constantly. And then we all learned a big lesson as an industry and we started and everybody started investing everything. So it definitely. The norms have shifted a lot.
00:44:58.330 - 00:45:23.748, Speaker A: Especially the irony is the reason I say this is, I remember in 2023, I got so many doc updates that were like, hey, we're increasing your vesting. I feel like that's why. That's why I'm saying, like, there's one era where it's, like, implausible, which is like the post FTX era, because, like, everyone was like, nope, nope, vesting's going up. Vesting's going up.
00:45:23.844 - 00:45:24.364, Speaker C: Right?
00:45:24.492 - 00:45:55.570, Speaker A: Then there was the pre Luna era where people were definitely fast and loose and pretending they're a hedge fund. And that certainly, yeah, that era, it could be like everyone from a small fund to a gigantic fund, but in the Luna to FTX blow up era, I feel like that would have to be someone who's so distressed that they did it. That's my rough. I don't know. You have a quizzical look on your face.
00:45:56.310 - 00:46:01.392, Speaker D: I found this exercise to be a little bit boring, like, entertaining a group of VC's.
00:46:01.456 - 00:46:02.472, Speaker B: We're early stage investors.
00:46:02.536 - 00:46:05.040, Speaker D: How to guess? Like, who are the, yeah, they were.
00:46:05.120 - 00:46:08.744, Speaker C: Movers and shakers in the crypto industry. You used to be an investor? What are you talking about?
00:46:08.912 - 00:46:09.936, Speaker D: I used to be an investor.
00:46:10.008 - 00:46:12.100, Speaker C: You were doing deals when you were a consensus.
00:46:12.480 - 00:46:14.504, Speaker D: Well, yeah, because, yeah, so there you go.
00:46:14.552 - 00:46:15.056, Speaker C: All right.
00:46:15.168 - 00:46:18.232, Speaker D: I'm a well thought after angel.
00:46:18.376 - 00:46:23.992, Speaker C: Oh, well thought after angel. Is that right? Okay. That's very, very, very elite of you.
00:46:24.056 - 00:46:32.160, Speaker D: Yeah, no, but I feel like, because when I saw the news, I was like, you know, everyone was guessing who they are. I feel like your framework probably makes sense.
00:46:32.280 - 00:46:33.360, Speaker C: Was that framework?
00:46:33.520 - 00:46:35.896, Speaker A: No, no, no, my framework for us.
00:46:36.048 - 00:46:36.920, Speaker C: I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
00:46:36.960 - 00:46:59.780, Speaker D: Ouch. But I feel like every VC has experienced, like, the VC's behaved so differently before and nowadays, because just the different investors going in from a founder perspective, even, like, I read this news and I was like, what's the impact to me? Do I just not come to New York when I race next time? Like, why not? Should I go to Dubai? Is everyone moving offshore?
00:46:59.860 - 00:47:11.932, Speaker A: I feel like the impact is probably just like some people who are on your cap. People might be more annoying now if they're the ones. They're going to be like, hey, we need these docs to prove that we did that.
00:47:11.996 - 00:47:15.972, Speaker C: To be clear, subpoenas do not necessarily mean enforcement actions. Right? So we got to wait for sure.
00:47:16.076 - 00:47:26.290, Speaker A: But what's going to happen for them to give the SEC everything they want? They might be going to whichever companies and being like, oh, we have to prove some other thing and we didn't get all these docs.
00:47:27.310 - 00:47:49.444, Speaker C: Maybe. I would doubt that. I would think more. Somebody's like, oh, shit, let's figure out why. If somebody sold early when they weren't supposed to, that is a oh, shit type moment that we have to provide this to the SEC or we're going to be doing some obstruction of justice stuff. But I dont think its going to reach out. I dont think its going to affect a portfolio company.
00:47:49.444 - 00:47:52.440, Speaker C: It will just make you say, oh, I should not work with that fund.
00:47:53.140 - 00:47:57.680, Speaker A: I think theyre probably going to start asking about the companies too.
00:47:58.100 - 00:48:04.780, Speaker C: Maybe, but its a lot harder to reach the companies. The funds are directly in the SEC zambit.
00:48:04.820 - 00:48:24.964, Speaker A: No, no, for sure. I just think theyre going to annoy the shit out of the companies. I feel like anytime investors in my company have ever had some kind of, you forget about regulatory things, had a bad audit, I suddenly get 20 fucking emails like, oh, like, send us this. So like, I will tell you, I think it will.
00:48:25.092 - 00:48:58.548, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. I mean, I hear you on that. I hear you on that. Okay, so I want to move to one last topic while we still have time. So there was one interview that actually Pac man, the founder of Blast and of. Of Blur, also known as Tiuchin, he had an interview that he had a very interesting perspective on this cycle that I want to get everybody's reaction to, because I think it's. You've noticed in this cycle that it feels like there's a lot more pessimism, a lot more almost nihilism about crypto from a lot of the crypto insiders.
00:48:58.548 - 00:49:25.256, Speaker C: There's a sense of almost fatigue. People talk about, oh, there's not enough applications, there's too much infrastructure. You guys are exactly. Tircan's claim is that the reason why the current crypto cycle hasn't played out like previous crypto cycles is that previous crypto cycles were all oriented around some particular innovation. So previously it was around icos and decentralized capital formation, then it was around the metaverse, and then it was around.
00:49:25.288 - 00:49:27.072, Speaker A: You're skipping Defi and Uniswap.
00:49:27.176 - 00:49:51.000, Speaker C: The most important one of all, actually, was the new technology, the rise of defy, the rise of nfts, the metaverse story. And in this cycle, it doesn't feel like there is a new zero to one thing that's getting people excited, and that's part of the reason why this cycle is sputtering in the way that it is. That's his claim. Curious to get you guys take on that story, because I found it thought provoking. What do you guys think?
00:49:51.860 - 00:49:56.836, Speaker D: I feel like everyone has been saying that for a long time. Yeah, there is nothing new.
00:49:57.028 - 00:49:57.920, Speaker A: I agree.
00:49:58.820 - 00:50:34.696, Speaker D: I'm a protocol founder. I'm obviously looking for new things. But, yeah, this, for the last six months, or even when I was at consensus, there's really nothing that's innovative, that's zero to one. Now I'm just getting 100 pumped off ish launchpads on all sorts of chains and have a bit of unique flavor. You're getting a bit of AI and crypto, but everyone knows it's a bit of vaporware. So I think people try so hard to find something new, but it's not there. And no one has succeeded.
00:50:34.696 - 00:50:35.312, Speaker D: I don't think so.
00:50:35.376 - 00:50:48.760, Speaker A: And I think that the way we started the episode about SBC being kind of like uninspiring is like an equivalent on the even further back end of the research side, that there's nothing coming from that area either.
00:50:48.840 - 00:50:53.080, Speaker C: Yeah. Okay, so now I'm just getting pessimism, pure pessimism. Is that the answer?
00:50:53.160 - 00:50:55.140, Speaker D: The mega eat has the answer, yeah.
00:50:55.870 - 00:51:18.526, Speaker B: I think there are new things, new applications. They're not necessarily new ideas. Like polymarket, for example, is now working. But prediction markets have been around for a while. But it's just not thematic, and I think that's maybe more. The point is, all these other cycles, there was a big theme, and someone kind of cracks it, and then the whole industry kind of like, od's on it, and they're like, okay, that was too much. That was too much icos, and then we kind of have a come down.
00:51:18.558 - 00:51:20.790, Speaker C: And too much defi, too much metaverse.
00:51:20.870 - 00:51:27.606, Speaker B: And now it feels like there aren't a million prediction markets, there's not a million ZK Tl's, AI prediction markets.
00:51:27.638 - 00:51:44.150, Speaker A: But yeah, there's a ton of people raising for them. There's not, like, a ton of them that can attract any liquidity or usage. That's like, the pro. It is actually almost monopolistic, which is, like, weird, because, like, the other crypto stuff was much less monopolistic. Like, there were many competitors, or at least like five.
00:51:44.270 - 00:51:44.790, Speaker C: Right.
00:51:44.910 - 00:51:46.534, Speaker A: It doesn't feel like that for a lot of.
00:51:46.662 - 00:51:58.270, Speaker B: I think, like, defi summer, it was like every week someone was launching some new thing, and it was being tweaked slightly, and then someone was launching a new thing, and it's not really like that other than, I guess, yfii. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:51:58.430 - 00:51:59.454, Speaker C: Oh, my God.
00:51:59.622 - 00:52:01.030, Speaker B: Haven't thought about that in a while.
00:52:01.150 - 00:52:11.142, Speaker D: I have a thesis for, you know, the cycle that I was gonna bring up by mega east. We're very bullish on the 2017 ICo scam ideas.
00:52:11.326 - 00:52:12.070, Speaker C: Okay.
00:52:12.190 - 00:52:17.950, Speaker D: Like, think about decentralized VPN. I don't know, dental coin, color coin, whatever.
00:52:20.010 - 00:52:20.626, Speaker A: That's one.
00:52:20.658 - 00:52:23.458, Speaker C: You might elaborate. Elaborate.
00:52:23.514 - 00:52:47.418, Speaker D: But I think a lot of the. I feel like everybody got into crypto because there is one idea, whether it's supply chain or, I don't know, VPN or whatever, that just, like, tickle your. This butterfly. You're like, oh, wow. There is some sort of efficiency unlock via coordination that's there. And I think that's why 2017, we have a bunch of ICO coins. But, you know, they were not serious and the infrastructure was not ready.
00:52:47.418 - 00:53:07.310, Speaker D: Like, think about putting energy on the grid, right? Like, that is one of the 50 spokes that consensus had. Our thesis is that, let's go revisit the 2017 ideas and see what can we do nowadays, but without just enforcing a coin into it. That is what I think is the next wave.
00:53:07.810 - 00:53:39.210, Speaker B: I think there is merit to that, even something as simple as deep learning. This is a very old idea that only became feasible in the past 1015 years because of changes in technology. Maybe there's something thematic to that for crypto as well, where it's like, yeah, maybe some of these old ideas weren't bad. They were just early. And even something like perps. People have been trying to build decentralized perps for years and years and years, and now it's like, okay, maybe we actually had the tech to make something good, and the markets here and there's liquidity here, and it's not wrong. It's early.
00:53:39.630 - 00:54:13.256, Speaker C: Yeah, I like that idea. And I do agree that there's something. It feels like what this cycle is about, if it's about anything, is it's about quantity becoming a quality of its own right. And it's like there were a lot of things that were working on very small scales, like stable coins were just much smaller, and then polymarket volumes were much smaller, and decentralized perks were much smaller. And they were there. You know, it's not like we invented these things in the last two years, but now they're big, and the bigness of them actually makes them qualitatively different and makes them, you know, now polymarket is like the primary market for the election. It's the.
00:54:13.256 - 00:54:42.540, Speaker C: It's, you know, perplexity. Just integrated polymarket instead of integrating, like, you know, 538 or whatever the modern equivalent of 538 would be. And that feels to me like a. Something that happens, not as a zero to one. Okay, there's a new paper published about this, but it's the one to 100 and the one to 100 in some sense. Intellectually, it's less interesting because it's just more of the same, but bigger. But that is such an important part of how crypto actually does the thing that we were all talking about three to four years ago.
00:54:42.540 - 00:55:08.234, Speaker C: The stories we were telling in some way are premature now. The stories we're telling are actually right sized, but they're actually happening. And that feels like the difference to me in this cycle. Like the thing you were talking about last time about Georgia, right? And you were in Georgia, and you were like buying tether with a Pos system, you know, buying toothpaste. Like that couldn't have happened in the last cycle, even though that's what we talked about in the last cycle, right? Everybody talked about, oh my God, you're.
00:55:08.242 - 00:55:10.162, Speaker A: Going to be like two or three cycles.
00:55:10.266 - 00:55:11.186, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Exactly.
00:55:11.218 - 00:55:11.790, Speaker D: Right.
00:55:13.490 - 00:55:22.844, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay, so given your thesis, what is the pets.com of 2017 that will be the doordash of this cycle for you, in your mind?
00:55:22.972 - 00:55:24.440, Speaker D: The pets.com.
00:55:25.580 - 00:55:29.660, Speaker A: Pets.Com or. Yeah, or what was the delivery one called?
00:55:29.740 - 00:55:31.612, Speaker B: Web van Webb.
00:55:31.716 - 00:55:44.240, Speaker A: Like, you know, what, 1999 Web van. Some things that failed in 2017 versus DoorDash and something now polymarket. Yeah. But I guess, I mean for the net, you know.
00:55:46.300 - 00:56:19.330, Speaker D: I mean, we're obviously exploring something wherever where right now working with a builder is a decentralized VPN idea. People probably don't know the top six VPN in the world are controlled by this one company. It's definitely not private and it's definitely not secure. But with mega Ethereum, with our technology, you can actually have a VPN that is decentralized as private by nature, but actually doesn't sacrifice performance. That's what we're always saying. The mega ETh application pair web two, performance with web3, crypto nativeness. So that's what we're excited about.
00:56:19.410 - 00:56:23.674, Speaker A: So orcid. Orcid is Webvan orchid is that's what you're saying?
00:56:23.722 - 00:56:24.938, Speaker D: Whatever that name is.
00:56:25.034 - 00:56:25.290, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:56:25.330 - 00:56:25.986, Speaker C: Damn. Okay.
00:56:26.018 - 00:56:30.950, Speaker A: That's a deep, was a little after. I didn't. They didn't Ico, but orcid, definitely ics.
00:56:31.650 - 00:56:35.970, Speaker C: VPN and like Tor, I think are like a different scale.
00:56:36.010 - 00:56:37.786, Speaker A: Yeah, the mix net stuff, I guess, is different.
00:56:37.858 - 00:57:02.552, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, that's, that's like a different, that's a different scale of security that you're trying to get. But I mean, I think this is also very topical because you spend so much time in Asia. And of course, folks who are using crypto in China, I would love to hear you speak to that a little bit about the role of VPN's for people using crypto in China. Because I think everybody kind of knows China matters in crypto and everybody knows people in China are still trading crypto. They're still trading on binance somehow, even though they're not supposed to like it. It's all very shadowy.
00:57:02.576 - 00:57:07.328, Speaker A: I think a lot of people, Jupiter and hyper liquid volume isn't coming from the us. Come on.
00:57:07.464 - 00:57:16.860, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, it's like give us a, give us a glimpse of what is the average user in China doing and what is the role that VPN's play for people in China.
00:57:17.020 - 00:57:40.680, Speaker D: Yeah, we didn't think about the VPN is for chinese users, actually Middle east. And most of the applications are blocked in the Middle east. If you live in the Middle east, you gotta fucking have a VPN. Otherwise doesn't work. And a lot of people use VPN, not just because of lack of access for privacy as well. So I don't think this is a China thing. I mean, VPN is a huge tam, it's a big market.
00:57:40.680 - 00:58:11.990, Speaker D: But yeah, I think by going back to question about, you know, people in Chinese, it's mainly just trading. Right. You know, they're the one who just go on Telegram, the little mini game, and just keep tapping, tapping, tapping, tapping, hoping there's something out of it. Most of the airdrop farms operated out of China, but yeah, I still think China is where liquidity is. Where novel. Well, where the exit liquidity sometimes are, which is very sad. I also think I'm actually very bullish on chinese builders.
00:58:11.990 - 00:58:27.030, Speaker D: I make it actually sort of my own mission to kind of inspire builders in Asia because I think, you know, they're so far from New York where, you know, the cabals are hanging out, they just don't know what's going where. The podcast get reported, the podcast got recorded.
00:58:27.570 - 00:58:30.670, Speaker A: There's the chinese equivalent cabals, though also.
00:58:32.330 - 00:58:34.350, Speaker C: We just talked about one earlier on the show.
00:58:35.010 - 00:58:44.842, Speaker D: Yeah, yes, but you got what I'm saying. But yeah, I actually think we're going to get a generation of chinese and asian builders because economists succeed.
00:58:44.866 - 00:59:19.224, Speaker C: I totally agree with this. And there's been a huge chinese diaspora of folks who are now very, very influential in building a lot of stuff in the crypto industry. The thing that's fascinating me the most, and maybe we can just end because I know we're coming up on time soon. One things that we learned from the binance, the FTC case was how much binance is volume, still comes from mainland China, which obviously, like, it's illegal, you're not supposed to be doing that. So like, how are they doing that? And I think part of the answer, and you can correct me if I've, if I miss anything here, but there's basically what is, it's not Tuvalu. What's the, what's the island nation where you get like the digital passport, you know?
00:59:19.392 - 00:59:20.368, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, I do know.
00:59:20.384 - 00:59:22.568, Speaker D: You were talking about caribbean islands.
00:59:22.704 - 00:59:25.208, Speaker B: No, there's one in Asia.
00:59:25.264 - 00:59:45.988, Speaker C: I thought it was something. Yeah, maybe it's tubaloo, whatever. There's some country where you can get a digital id Palau. That's what it is. You can get a digital id in Palau and then using a Palau digital id, which you don't have to be in person to actually go collect. You just sign a form online, you become a digital citizen of Palau. And using a Palau id, you can sign up on binance and start trading.
00:59:45.988 - 01:00:09.180, Speaker C: And this is how a lot of mainland chinese people get onto binance is with this Palau idea. And they're like, oh, you have a chinese sounding name, but apparently you're a Palau citizen, so it's cool. And that's how binance has, like, what was it? 20% of their trading volume comes from mainland China. Chinese. And so China, one way or another, will always find some way to get onto these things, right. And to get access to crypto.
01:00:09.300 - 01:00:16.564, Speaker D: I think the entire world does. I think African do this and Latinos do that. Yeah. I don't think it's particular, but, I.
01:00:16.572 - 01:00:37.290, Speaker C: Mean, I don't think it's unique to China, but it's also. China has always been such a big part of the crypto industry, and just by kind of mass, China is obviously the second largest country in the world, the second largest economy in the world. So it is really, really significant to understand the gravitational force they exert on the rest of the crypto industry.
01:00:37.590 - 01:00:38.174, Speaker D: Yep.
01:00:38.262 - 01:00:38.910, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:00:39.070 - 01:00:39.654, Speaker A: Okay.
01:00:39.742 - 01:00:43.174, Speaker C: All right, thank you, brother Bing. We appreciate you sharing your insights with us.
01:00:43.222 - 01:00:44.518, Speaker D: Thank you, guys. Pleasure.
01:00:44.614 - 01:00:49.260, Speaker C: Always. All right, I think with that, we can wrap. Thanks, everybody. See you next time. Bye.
