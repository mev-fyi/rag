00:00:00.520 - 00:00:41.919, Speaker A: So essentially, they are just separate chains that have some connection to Ethereum. And what I'm proposing is something that is much stronger connected to Ethereum, and where for developer, it feels much more like one chain. And kind of an obvious example is liquidity fragmentation. So if you today start a new roll up, then, for example, all the tokens, they don't have liquidity, so you cannot trade them there. So you have to build up your own liquidity. You have to have kind of copies of. Well, I mean, first you need to deploy Uniswap contracts or other Dexes.
00:00:41.919 - 00:00:58.955, Speaker A: Then you probably also want money markets. So something like aave. And kind of, in a way, you have to replicate everything that Ethereum has and then build up your own liquidity. And in an alternative approach, you could ideally just tap into.
