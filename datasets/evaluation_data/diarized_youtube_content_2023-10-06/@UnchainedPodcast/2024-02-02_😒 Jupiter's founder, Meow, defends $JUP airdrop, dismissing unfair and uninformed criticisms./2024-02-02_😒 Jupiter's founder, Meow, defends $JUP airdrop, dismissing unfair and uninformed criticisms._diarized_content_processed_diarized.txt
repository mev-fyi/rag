I feel like, you know, they fly by and they drop shit. It felt that way to me. There is an extremely good chance that I don't actually get any money out of this USDC. Of this at all. Okay.

So that's a very good chance that it just get done nothing. So you must understand why we do not see that as a token sale pool, right? Because first and foremost, it's a backstop pool.
