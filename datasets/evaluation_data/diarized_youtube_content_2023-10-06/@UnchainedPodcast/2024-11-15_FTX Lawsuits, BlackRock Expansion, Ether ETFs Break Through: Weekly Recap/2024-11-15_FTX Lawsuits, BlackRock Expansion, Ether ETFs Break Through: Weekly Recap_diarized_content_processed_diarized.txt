00:00:00.960 - 00:00:51.508, Speaker A: Welcome to this week's crypto roundup. In today's recap, we cover FTX's $1.8 billion lawsuit against Binance and a spree of legal actions to recover funds, BlackRock's expansion of its crypto fund across multiple blockchains and ether ETFs turning positive for the first time since launch. We also dive into Ethereum's beamchain proposal and the mixed reactions it sparked SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce's concerns about the agency's readiness for pro crypto policies, a JITO protocol outage that Temporari temporarily spiked Solana fees, and how Trump's victory is reigniting discussions about a wave of crypto iPodOS. Thanks for tuning in to the weekly news recap. Let's begin. FTX sues Binance and others in spree of lawsuits ftx, the bankrupt crypto exchange, has filed a series of lawsuits, including a high profile $1.8
00:00:51.508 - 00:01:50.576, Speaker A: billion claim against Binance and its former CEO, Changpeng CZ Zhao. The the lawsuit alleges that FTX's Alameda research fraudulently transferred funds to repurchase Binance's stake in FTX in 2021 while insolvent, Binance has dismissed the claims as meritless. The suits are part of a broader legal effort by FTX to recover assets for creditors. Other Lawsuits target Anthony Scaramucci's SkyBridge Capital for 67 million and StoryBook Brawl's developers for $25 million, as well as a prominent exploiter known as Humpy the Whale, who FTX has accused of siphoning $1 billion from it via token manipulation. FTX is also pursuing funds from non profits tied to effective altruism and political advocacy that receive donations from FTX. The estate aims to recover over 2 billion through these actions to compensate creditors of the defunct exchange. Meanwhile, US prosecutors have filed to seize $17.9
00:01:50.576 - 00:03:15.154, Speaker A: million in crypto tied to alleged bribes Sam Bankman Fried paid to Chinese officials in 2021 to unfreeze $1 billion in assets. 18 states and DeFi fund sue SEC over crypto regulation 18 Republican attorneys general, along with the Defi Education Fund, have filed a lawsuit against the US securities and Exchange Commission alleging the agency has exceeded its authority in regulating digital assets. The suit, filed in the Eastern District of Kentucky, names SEC Chair Gary Gensler and the agency's commissioners as def. The plaintiffs argue the SEC's approach to digital assets classifying nearly all cryptocurrency transactions as investment contracts violates state regulatory authority and lacks congressional approval. They seek a court declaration that digital asset transactions are not inherently investment contracts and an order preventing the SEC from enforcing registration requirements on platforms handling such transactions. The case challenges the SEC's use of the Howey test to classify digital assets as securities, claiming it fails to account for distinctions between assets and ongoing obligations. Bitfinex hacker sentenced to five years in Bitcoin laundering case Ilya Lichtenstein, the hacker behind the 20 theft of approximately 120,000 Bitcoin from the crypto exchange Bitfinex, has been sentenced to five years in federal prison.
00:03:15.154 - 00:03:54.114, Speaker A: The U.S. district Court in Washington, D.C. handed down the sentence following his guilty plea to conspiracy to commit money laundering. His wife and co conspirator Heather Morgan, is scheduled for sentencing next week. Lichtenstein orchestrated the hack using advanced techniques to transfer 119,754 bitcoin worth billions today into wallets under his control. To cover his tracks, he erased access logs and credentials from Bitfinex's system. He and Morgan laundered the stolen funds through a series of sophisticated methods, including darknet markets, cryptocurrency mixers and chain hopping, converting Bitcoin into other digital assets.
00:03:54.114 - 00:04:54.928, Speaker A: The Justice Department credited the irs, FBI and Homeland Security for their investigative work. Prosecutors also confirmed a formal forfeiture process for seized assets, marking a significant recovery in one of the largest crypto thefts in history. BlackRock expands fund across multiple blockchains BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, has taken its $500 million USD institutional digital liquidity Fund Beadle Multichain in partnership with tokenization firm Securitize Markets. The fund is now available on aptos, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Optimism's OP Mainnet and Polygon pos. Expanding beyond its initial launch on Ethereum earlier this year, the Beetle Fund allows institutional investors to earn yields on tokenized U.S. treasuries. Annual management fees vary by blockchain, with Aptos, Avalanche and Polygon set at 20 basis points, while Ethereum, Arbitrum and Op Main Net have higher fees at 50 basis points.
00:04:54.928 - 00:05:54.970, Speaker A: Real world asset tokenization is scaling, said Carlos Domingo, CEO of Securitize, adding that these new blockchains will enhance the efficiency of the Beetle ecosystem. This expansion comes as tokenized treasuries continue to grow rapidly, with $2.4 billion in circulation, an increase of 200% so far this year. Native tokens of the added blockchains, including op, Apt and Avax, saw modest price increases following the announcement. Ether ETFs turn positive for the first time since their launch in July, Ether exchange traded funds have achieved positive cumulative net flows totaling $241 million as of Thursday. This turnaround follows a six day streak of inflows, including record setting days of 146 million on Wednesday and 296 million on Tuesday, according to data from Farside. The shift comes as Ethereum's price climbed to a three month high of 3015.
00:05:54.970 - 00:07:01.958, Speaker A: Bitwise further bolstered market interest by announcing the acquisition of Ethereum's staking firm. Attestant the acquisition could position the crypto asset manager to introduce an ETH ETF that incorporates staking rewards, a feature currently absent from existing offerings. Commenting on the broader market outlook, Jim Huang, COO of Firin Capital, told Unchained that post election you see the broadening out of market gains beyond BTC into ETH Alti, L1s and DeFi. Huang added that expectations for clear crypto regulations and institutional adoption are no longer a pipe dream. Ethereum's Beamchain proposal faces Mixed reactions At the devcon conference in Bangkok, Ethereum foundation researcher Justin Drake unveiled Beamchain, a proposed redesign of Ethereum's consensus layer. The ambitious five year plan aims to enhance transaction finality, integrate zero knowledge technologies, and consolidate upgrades into a single significant fork. Drake described the initiative as a dashing opportunity to execute multiple improvements all at once.
00:07:01.958 - 00:08:01.690, Speaker A: While the proposal received applause at the event, prominent Ethereum community members subsequently expressed concerns. Critics such as Ethereum builder Martin Kopelman dismissed the plan as a big refactoring that optimizes Ethereum's internal code without delivering external innovations. Similarly, Jose Maria Macedo of Delphi Digital argued that Beamchain's timeline and scope fall short of making Ethereum Layer one more competitive. Others, such as eigenlayer engineer Bowen Lee, voiced frustration with the lengthy development timeframe. We may reach Mars before Beamchain goes live, li commented. Meanwhile, core developer Peter Silagi warned against implementing multiple changes to the consensus layer all at one time, instead advocating for incremental upgrades in order to maintain system stability. Hester Peirce questions SEC's readiness for pro crypto shift SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce expressed concerns about the agency's preparedness for clearer cryptocurrency regulations under a Trump administration.
00:08:01.690 - 00:09:06.456, Speaker A: Speaking on the Block and Order podcast, Peirce warned, what I worry is going to happen is we will get a more open mind toward developing good rules and then when they say okay, so what should those rules be? No one knows what to do. After Unchained published this story, Pearce responded on X, writing that my point was simply that people inside and outside the agency need to be thinking now about what good crypto regulation looks like. Trump has promised to provide regulatory clarity and create a crypto advisory council within his first 100 days of his new administration, and has also pledged to fire SEC Chair Gary Gensler as soon as he takes office. While these changes could expedite policy shifts, SEC rulemaking is inherently slow, often requiring years to implement. George Mason University's J.W. verrett suggested an interim SEC chair could issue a concept release to gather industry input and speed up reforms. On the podcast, Pearce also called for clearer NFT regulations, urging issuers to engage with the SEC to test boundaries and improve clarity.
00:09:06.456 - 00:10:02.058, Speaker A: Jito otage temporarily increases Solana fees Jito, a leading Solana based MEV protocol, experienced a temporary system wide outage early Wednesday, causing transaction priority fees on the blockchain to spike. Jitolabs attributed the disruption to high demand, potentially overloading its block engine server. The issue was resolved within an hour, with the team stating all systems were fully operational and secure shortly after the problems arose. During the outage, priority fees surged approximately 25 to 30 times, with the median fee peaking at $0. According to Compass Solana, Jito's co founder told the Block the issue was isolated to the protocol's bundle delivery system and did not affect Solana's overall network performance. The downtime followed record breaking demand for Jito, which processed 15 million transaction bundles the previous day. A full postmortem is expected from Jito Labs.
00:10:02.058 - 00:11:05.810, Speaker A: Trump's win sparks talk of crypto IPO surge the election of Donald Trump has reignited discussions about cryptocurrency firms going public as his administration promises a pro crypto regulatory environment. Trump's campaign commitments, including establishing clearer regulations for crypto, have fueled optimism among industry leaders that an IPO wave could follow his inauguration. Ram Ahlwalia, CEO of Lumeda wealth, expects stablecoin issuer Circle and blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis to be among the early IPO candidates. Circle, the company behind the $37 billion market cap USDC stablecoin, has long expressed interest in going public. Its previous IPO attempt through a SPAC deal fell apart in 2022amid market turbulence, but CEO Jeremy Allaire remains committed to the goal. Experts caution, however, that not all crypto companies are suited to be public companies. Quinho of GSR noted that firms must demonstrate stable profitability and manage the complexities of being publicly listed.
00:11:05.810 - 00:11:36.512, Speaker A: Infrastructure companies such as Anchorage Digital and Nydig may be better positioned given their relative stability, ho said. And that's all.
