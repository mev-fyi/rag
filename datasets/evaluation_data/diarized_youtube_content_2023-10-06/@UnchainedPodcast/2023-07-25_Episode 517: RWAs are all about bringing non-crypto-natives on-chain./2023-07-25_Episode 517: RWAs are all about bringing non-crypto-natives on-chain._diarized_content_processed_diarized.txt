00:00:00.250 - 00:00:40.802, Speaker A: Different than a lot of other places. We want to be focusing actually kind of more away from the crypto native investors into a more mainstream investor. We're going to be trying to take advantage of things like L2s and account abstraction and embedded wallets to make the experience really, really seamless. And we want to bring that a normal mainstream investor. Have them barely even realize they're doing everything fully on chain in a self custodial manner, but get access to this deal that they can't get anywhere else and so them. I think that that's a good way to bring more people in, because, again, it's not this thing they can just go on their Fidelity account and get it's something that's unique to what we're doing. And also, in terms of investors, if we can take capital directly from investors anywhere in the world, there's all sorts of payment processor fees that don't have to take place on chain.
00:00:40.802 - 00:00:45.540, Speaker A: And then eventually we can get all these other benefits of interoperability and transparency and stuff that Robert's been talking about.
