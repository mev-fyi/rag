00:00:00.090 - 00:00:07.182, Speaker B: So James, you're talking about just generally all these different ETF applications, but not specifically about grayscale converting. Right.
00:00:07.236 - 00:00:35.558, Speaker A: Grayscale is in the same boat as I would, I would say. So their lawsuit in this whole situation, we don't know. So basically they filed in 19 before they were given a disapproval order. The courts vacated that disapproval order. We don't know what happens next. This is we're in basically uncharted territory. Maya, assumption, and I think it's pretty well known, is that Grayscale and the SEC are likely talking as we're recording this, going back and forth in some way, trying to figure out what the next steps are, negotiating on what's going to happen.
00:00:35.558 - 00:00:51.980, Speaker A: The SEC probably wants them to completely refile. Grayscale probably doesn't want to do that, but they don't want to go back to court again either. So there's probably some sort of conversation figuring out what the next steps are for their process in the 19 before the other filers that are filing new stuff are going to that same 19 before process.
