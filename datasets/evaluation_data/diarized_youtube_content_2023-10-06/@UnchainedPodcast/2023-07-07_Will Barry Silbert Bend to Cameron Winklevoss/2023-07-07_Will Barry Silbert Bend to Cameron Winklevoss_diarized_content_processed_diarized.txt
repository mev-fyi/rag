Time for fun bits. The United Kingdom passed a bill on crypto last week. Hear it from Unchained's. Ginny Hogan.
00:12:07.518 - 00:12:48.958, Speaker B: Move over, Harry Potter. The next big British thing has arrived. The British Financial Services and Market Act of 2023 now classifies crypto as regulated financial activity. The bill was first introduced in July 2022, which was like eight failed exchanges ago, but on Thursday it was given the royal ascent by King Charles. Yes, that's actually what it's called when a bill becomes a law the royal ascent. Everything in Britain is so quaint. Would you like some tea and crumpets with your board IPE? According to the UK Financial Services Minister, the goal of this bill is to allow for the UK's safe adoption of crypto, a term that had previously been reserved for taking a vaccinated puppy home from the pound.
00:12:48.958 - 00:13:05.718, Speaker B: But dogecoins need loving homes too, you know. Under this bill, crypto can now be treated as its own type of property class. Specifically, it's the hill you die on. The government claims that this law is going to be a rocket boost to the British economy. Rocket submarine one of those.
