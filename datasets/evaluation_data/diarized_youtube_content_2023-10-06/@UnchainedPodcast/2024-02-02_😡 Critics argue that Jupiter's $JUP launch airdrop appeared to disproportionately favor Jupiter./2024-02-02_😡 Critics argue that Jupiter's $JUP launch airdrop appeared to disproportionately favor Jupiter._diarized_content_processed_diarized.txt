00:00:00.330 - 00:00:05.866, Speaker A: And they were pointing out that you guys made this money without any vesting. So what do you say to these criticisms?
00:00:06.058 - 00:00:21.450, Speaker B: Oh, I say they're right. I mean, that's how it works. But as usual, the devil's details, right? The important thing to understand about this pool, right? It's not a fundraising pool. It's first and foremost a liquidity bootstrap and backstop pool.
00:00:21.530 - 00:00:26.678, Speaker A: I mean, I think they're saying the net effect is that it's as if you, rate is $250,000,000.
00:00:26.764 - 00:00:46.082, Speaker B: No, it's actually not 250. But first net effect, actually, I think we should raise. I don't actually feel bad about raising at all. We didn't do any OTC. We didn't do any VC rounds for Jupiter, right? And the reason we didn't do any of that is that we wanted our first sale to be with the community. That's it. We wanted it to be open market sale.
00:00:46.082 - 00:00:57.580, Speaker B: Whoever criticized me asked their favorite D five protocol, probably, like 20% tokens or something, to a VC, right? Who best over time, right? We didn't do any of that. Or OTC tokens, whatever. Shit. We didn't do any of that stuff, right?
