00:01:35.830 - 00:01:41.070, Speaker B: Thanks, Laura. It's a pleasure to be here. As they say in radio, a longtime listener, first time caller.
00:01:42.450 - 00:01:48.910, Speaker A: So FTX had some big news this week. Tell us what that news is and why it's significant.
00:01:49.570 - 00:02:42.318, Speaker B: Right, so FTX specifically, it's a US based exchange. FTX US announced that they had acquired LedgerX, essentially a CFTC licensed company that can offer crypto derivatives, bitcoin and ether contracts, futures options, swaps, things like that. And it was a really interesting story because in some ways it kind of brings the strategy that FTX International CEO Sam Banker used so successfully internationally here into the US. FTX US started about a year ago. Its volume is relatively nominal, especially in light of coinbase, which typically does over $4 billion a day in transaction volume. Kraken is over a billion. Even finance's US Arm is over a billion dollars.
00:02:42.318 - 00:03:21.020, Speaker B: And FTX US is only, I say only, but only around 350,000,000. That said, once, assuming that this merger goes through, which I think should happen sometime around October, assuming no roadblocks, FTX US will be able to offer crypto derivatives to US clients, which is not something that any of those other major US based exchanges can do, so that gives them a distinct advantage. And typically also these types of contracts and offerings are much more profitable than spot transactions. So it is a pretty important deal for FTX US.
00:03:21.550 - 00:03:28.960, Speaker A: And so tell us a little bit about Ledger X in terms of its history or how it came to be in this position.
00:03:29.730 - 00:04:01.738, Speaker B: Sure. So, I mean, Ledger X started out a few years ago. They had acquired these licenses and they really tried to break into, I guess, like the institutional derivative space and also the retail space. Crypto derivatives, though, have tended to be a bit of a slow climb, especially in the regulated institutional space. I mean, they've really taken off internationally in the unregulated space where I think FTX does something like $500 billion a day or something. Nominal value. I have to double check that stat, but hi everyone.
00:04:01.824 - 00:04:11.482, Speaker A: Quick correction that Steve had me add after the show, which is that he misspoke here and he meant to say $500 billion monthly, but Ledger X really.
00:04:11.616 - 00:04:50.060, Speaker B: Never seemed to kind of rise up to the levels of the derabits and FTXs and Binances and so on and so forth. And it can be due to a multitude of reasons, but I believe at some point they just decided, look, we have these licenses, they are valuable, we're not finding the right type of product, market fits. So this is probably a good time to find an exit. And it's hard to imagine. I would assume they've talked to a few different partners to find the best deal for them. But given FTX's playbook that they can use in the US. It's hard to imagine that they found a better partner than FTX US to consummate a deal and hopefully grow the business.
00:04:50.910 - 00:05:04.480, Speaker A: So, as you mentioned, FTX is pretty tiny compared to other major US. Crypto exchanges in terms of its trading volume. So how do you expect this acquisition to affect that competition between the crypto exchanges in the US.
00:05:05.490 - 00:05:34.774, Speaker B: So I think right now FTX US is probably going to have a relatively clear lane to do mean. Kraken does have a futures offering, but they geofence around. The mean. Coinbase I don't think has any plans to offer derivatives anytime soon, although I would imagine they will at some point. I mean, Coinbase actually recently pulled back its margin offerings. I think Kraken still does, but minimal. So FTX US will have some clear lanes to play at.
00:05:34.774 - 00:06:58.334, Speaker B: Of course, they have to compete with CME, which I think is the third or fourth largest derivatives exchanged by open interest and volume. So they are a big player and they do dominate the institutional space, but FTX US can try as well. And they also have some more offerings specifically targeted towards the retail market, which traders, like traders that could buy a contract for as little as about $500, depending on what the prices are of that given day. I think the more interesting question though here is kind of especially when the retail sector, who should trade these instruments and for what? Because crypto is already so volatile, derivatives do play an important role in healthy markets. I had a long conversation with FTX CEO Sam Bankman, Fried about this a couple of weeks ago. And in crypto, just like any other market in the world, volume on derivative exchanges, on derivatives is much higher than Spot and they help as far as more efficient trades, price transparency, price discovery. But in crypto it's a little bit different because the markets are already so volatile that once you start offering these products and then putting leverage on top of that, which could be 510, 25, 100, that can really create Cascading liquidations, that really don't do much to help crypto's reputation.
00:06:58.334 - 00:07:30.810, Speaker B: So FTX us when they start offering these products, it's going to be important for them to be conscientious about who they offer these products to making sure that those people have the right level of education, because these products can be used to hedge against risk and to lower volatility, but it is a more advanced type of product. So retail traders that perhaps this is not someone for a retail trader that just perhaps doubled their investment because they bought a token and now they want to press their luck. These are for traders, not for gamblers.
00:07:31.250 - 00:08:45.730, Speaker A: And one other thing that I feel is fascinating about this acquisition at this moment in time is that recently there's been a lot of noise about crypto regulation. And it seems to me at least, that there's kind of like two camps emerging amongst the regulators and there's the camp that's kind of in favor of stricter regulation and then one that's I don't know if I would say that they want looser, but they're more amenable maybe to adopting new regulations for crypto or just kind of letting it play out a little bit instead of regulating right now when the technology is kind of less advanced. And we see both of these strains at both the SEC and the CFTC. And I just kind of wondered how you thought the different regulators might take a look at this merger and the entrance of FTX into the space here in the US. In particular Gary Gensler's view. The chair of the SEC has actually expressed openness to a derivatives focused Bitcoin ETF, rather know a spot one. So I was just curious for your take.
00:08:45.880 - 00:10:10.586, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, that is one of the million dollar questions and if you talk to Gensler, talk to officials at Mean, they're trying to figure out where do the lines of Demarcation go, where does each respective jurisdiction end? And it's hard to know. I think Gensler actually asked Congress to help decide for them because it is really difficult. The idea of the CFTC and talking about an ETF, a derivatives ETF, is actually really interesting. I spoke with Sam about this when I was interviewing him, and his opinion is that one of the reasons that Gensler might be so keen for a derivative focused ETF is because Gary Gensler was a former chair of the CFTC and he trusts the CME more so than perhaps other exchanges that he operates. Although some other sources that I've spoken with have said that as far as when it comes to something like crypto, a derivative focused ETF is not necessarily the most efficient way of doing it. Perhaps it's a way to shoehorn in the first ETF that we'll get, but at the same time, it's much less efficient than a Spot one, especially for an asset like Bitcoin, where custody is really not much of an issue now that we have these enterprise grade custodians and there's too many to name here. I mean, I think the CFTC, I would anticipate that they've already done some feelers out, so they're confident that this deal will be closed.
00:10:10.586 - 00:10:45.260, Speaker B: I also expect or believe that FTX US probably did not. They looked at how long it would take for them to get this license and they were counting in years, and they just figured that would be much faster to kind of jump the line, buy this license or buy these licenses from this exchange and sort of specialize in what each one does best. So on this particular deal, I don't anticipate it's going to be too hard to get approval on, but it doesn't answer the larger question that I think you raised to me just now.
00:10:45.950 - 00:11:28.950, Speaker A: So in a moment we'll discuss the future roadmap, I guess, for FTX as well as other crypto mergers and acquisitions news.

So, as you mentioned, you recently interviewed Sam Binkvin Fried. What do you think we can expect to see out of FTX beyond just this week's news?
00:12:18.890 - 00:12:46.254, Speaker B: I think there's going to be a lot out on the horizon. Most listeners of your show, I'm sure. I've heard about FTX's recent 900 million dollar raise, the largest private fundraise in history. That given the exchange an $18 billion valuation. That's a very massive hunting license for them to go after. The company itself is already profitable. It doesn't have a ton of overhead aside from I guess like a handful of employees and a big tech stack.
00:12:46.254 - 00:13:34.890, Speaker B: So I really think that Sam and FTX is going to try to further promote its brand, expand vertically, expand horizontally. Vertical integration is actually something that I know is very important to him. And it's funny, when I was speaking with Sam, one of the questions I asked is he's recently said he spends about 5 hours a day dealing with regulators. And I kind of asked him to contextualize that a little bit. What are the types of conversations that he's having? And he kind of said they fall into a few different camps. I mean, one are regulators in countries where they already operate and they're trying to figure out how existing regulations apply to crypto. Then there's others where it's a country that doesn't have the right type of regulatory architecture and they want to engage with people in the space that know the industry well so they can have meaningful conversations.
00:13:34.890 - 00:14:16.960, Speaker B: And he really just said it's. A lot of those types of discussions. And that also lends to the M A point that I think we're going to talk about in a little bit, which is again, now that they have this war chest, they can go out and buy companies and expand. They have to make a calculation on whether or not it's faster to build and get the licenses themselves or essentially import one, acquire it, acquire the people, the local knowledge and go that route. Especially with spot exchange, scale is everything because margins are increasingly getting thin. So that's very important. But at the same time, FTX and I think this is applicable for almost any other major exchange, their ambitions are bigger than mean coinbase wants to be the app store.
00:14:16.960 - 00:14:48.710, Speaker B: Other exchanges are looking to offer derivatives and become market makers and prime brokers and things like that. So I do think we're going to see a period of massive M A in this industry as some of the real category winners and leaders come to the forefront. And other companies that haven't really been able to gain that size, that scale, are going to look for exits that help reward their shareholders, their founders, their investors, and try to find the right fits.
00:14:49.450 - 00:14:58.746, Speaker A: And are there any particular areas that you feel are ripe for M A in crypto right now? Or any particular trends you're seeing in that regard coming up?
00:14:58.768 - 00:15:40.230, Speaker B: Yeah, so there's a couple of trends. I tend to think that we're not going to see the M A surge instantaneously because the market is doing so well for the most part and most tokens are going up. I mean, I don't want to generalize for the entire crypto market, but for the most part we're in a bit of a bull cycle, especially recently as it's recovered from its recent nader. But at some point, companies are going to have to get realistic about where they are and where they stand. I mean, most ICO projects are worthless at this point, except for the lucky few. And lucky probably means hard work and a bit of luck in this case. But they have to be honest about where they are and there's going to be a matchmaking process.
00:15:40.230 - 00:16:29.106, Speaker B: It's the same thing that's happening in the real world, where M and A activity in 2021 in the traditional financial sector, we've seen trillions of dollars in M and A deals and there's no sign of it stopping soon because companies are trying to figure out where they fit during this COVID, post COVID world and trying to reorganize themselves in crypto. It's important for firms to also be self aware. I had an interesting conversation with one of the co founders at Hermas earlier today, and I was asking him a little bit about the rationale behind the deal, the $250,000,000 token lockup with Polygon. And it was really interesting. His candor, which was basically we felt like we had a really strong product, we had great tech, but we weren't necessarily seeing the adoption that we were hoping for. Then here comes Polygon. I mean, they have a huge brand name, they're expanding.
00:16:29.106 - 00:17:20.090, Speaker B: I mean, they're seen as the L2 darling and now their ambitions are growing bigger than that. And it was just a perfect marriage because Polygon wanted their tech and Hermes was not going to be able to match their footprint or mind share, at least in the short term. So it was a perfect kind of marriage. I think there are some questions about whether or not the SEC and other regulators are going to care about a deal like that, but we can talk about that as if you'd like. But I thought the self awareness was important and that's really important for companies to be proactive and be honest about where they stand so that they can find deals that help create value for everybody. What I don't want is that if the market starts to go down and everyone just starts grasping for life rafts and lifeboats and we see these sloppy deals come through that destroy shareholder value or token holder value excuse me. And that would be poor for the entire industry.
00:17:21.230 - 00:17:44.862, Speaker A: Yeah, it's fascinating that a token merger, because Mean, it was such a big deal and it's unusual or kind of something new, I guess. And at the same time, we do know that the SEC really has its sights on DeFi. So can you address that regulatory issue that you brought up? I was curious to know what you thought the SEC might think of something like this.
00:17:44.996 - 00:18:22.474, Speaker B: So it's really funny. I spoke with Sandeep at Polygon. I spoke with some folks at Mean. They both told me that they really didn't have any conversations with the Mean. For one, they say they're not an American company, so they don't have to. I would suspect that some people at the SEC may disagree with that categorization, assuming that's maybe yeah, I guess I could probably talk to the folks at Telegram for an opinion on I mean, they are of the core belief that these are utility tokens, they're not securities. They have legal opinions to that effect.
00:18:22.474 - 00:18:54.470, Speaker B: They come up to me as very honest people that aren't trying to skirt any sort of regulations or laws. They are trying to do the right thing. These laws are gray the SEC, just for one, because that's the regulator near the mean. They are going very mean. Really, the only two tokens where we've gotten any sort of relatively clear guidance are bitcoin and ethereum, and everything else is up for grabs. So if you're a company, for instance, like herm, is that maybe they don't have a year or two of Runway left. Maybe they do.
00:18:54.470 - 00:19:25.154, Speaker B: I don't know that for sure. They get this deal. What would you do? Is it better to make this deal and hope that the SEC gives it its blessing or whatever the regulator is, or say, you know what, I'm too worried about this. It's not a slam dunk either way, but I don't want to take a chance. I mean, at some point you kind of have to perhaps take a leap of faith. That said, there are some really important considerations with the deal. On the hermit side, they control about 90% of tokens between them and their investors and groups that they know.
00:19:25.154 - 00:20:10.590, Speaker B: So they did a quick telegram check to see if everybody was sort of okay with this. On the polygon side, they told me this is out there, but the media was to finance the purchase with tokens that they own in their own treasury. So they didn't actually have to go to matic holders to get a sense of what they thought about this. But if these deals become more common, there are structures for how M A should mean. There's ways of going out and clearing it with regulators and also getting shareholder approval. And I would imagine that at some point we're going to have to see those types of questions and answered and procedures done if it really becomes a trend, which I suspect it will be as this industry matures and we see further gaps between the winners and the losers.
00:20:11.570 - 00:20:21.582, Speaker A: All right, so we're going to totally switch gears. Can you tell us a little bit about who Ferrisha Faro is and how she and her organization were using crypto?
00:20:21.726 - 00:20:56.686, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm happy to, Laura. That was an interview that really was fascinating to me as well, and a bit personal, and I'll explain what I mean by that in a second. So fresha. She is an Afghan expat. She's actually a former refugee herself. She's in her 30s. Her family actually had to leave Afghanistan during the 1980s with the Soviet invasion because her father was a high ranking member of the Mujahideen, which is essentially the Taliban precursor, but the US was covertly aligned with them to fight the Soviets back then.
00:20:56.686 - 00:22:02.242, Speaker B: Long story short, she ended up studying computer science in Iran, getting a master's in CS in Berlin, coming back to Afghanistan after the US invasion, I believe in about 2010, to become a professor of computer science there. And then ultimately she started a coding school for girls where they learned how to code solidity, they learned how to code smart contracts to query data from blockchains. And then once they graduated, they would get money, they would actually get work coding blockchain, and they would be paid in crypto. I mean, it was really kind of a wonderful these are the use cases we like to talk a lot about making money and investing in crypto, but its intrinsic value is rooted in use cases such as this, where it creates economic value where none could exist otherwise. And then what makes the story even more interesting is that aside from just creating this mini economy with crypto, at some point she actually had to fund the school using crypto itself. They used to have a local bank account. They had like a JPMorgan account in the US.
00:22:02.242 - 00:22:53.010, Speaker B: And they would wire money over. It was expensive, but that's what they had to do. They would sometimes use Western Union. It was expensive as well, but especially as the earlier part of this year when the Taliban started to go back on the offensive after the 2020 Doha Agreement, which sort of consummated the US withdrawal that just finished some of those payments started getting wired back due to AML KYC concerns. Western Union, I believe, since I wrote the article, stopped servicing the country, which is not unsurprising because everyone's now trying to figure out what the relationship with the Taliban is going to be. So the school actually now is funding itself entirely with crypto as well. So it really is one of those fascinating, I mean, to be honest, freshta would probably be a great guest for your show at some point too, if you're interested, as a very it's a sad story.
00:22:53.010 - 00:23:43.474, Speaker B: It's a story of hope, and it's also one that was a little personal for me because I am a former intelligence analyst myself for the Department of Defense, and I spent a large portion of that time working on Afghanistan, trying to help build support for the transitional government there. Combat mean, it is a sad day when this happens, although I'm not Afghani, and obviously it's much more personal for her than it is for me. As far as I know right now, the school is still operating, but it's remote. It has been for a while, ever since the Taliban research came, and I think it's really too soon to tell what's actually going to happen with it. I think the Taliban is trying to put up a good front. It doesn't want to be seen as a pariah state. It wants to have relations with the rest of the world.
00:23:43.474 - 00:24:04.300, Speaker B: And I think a big part of that is going to be how it treats women and whether or not it's going to allow women to study, to be in government, to have professional careers. So I'm optimistic. She told me she's willing to engage with the Taliban to talk about what she's doing, and I hope she gets that opportunity or at least is able to continue operating her.
00:24:05.390 - 00:24:18.938, Speaker A: Well, I really love that story. I do think maybe I would love to have her on my show. So I'll have to get her details from you later. But thank you so much for sharing that, and thanks so much for coming on Unconfirmed.
00:24:19.034 - 00:24:20.730, Speaker B: Yeah. Thanks, Laura. It was a pleasure.

First Headline Opensea's August volume blows even traditional Internet marketplaces out of the water NFT Marketplace Openc just completed a $3 billion month, according to data from Dune Analytics. That accounts for a near ten x of its previous high from July, when it hit $325,000,000 in volume. Openc is far and away the leading NFT marketplace, according to Decrypt. The next largest platform is Axio Infinity's Marketplace, which did $820,000,000 in volume last month.
00:25:45.802 - 00:26:11.538, Speaker A: CryptoPunks came in third, posting $667,000,000 in volume on its Larvae Lab site. It's not just doing well for an NFT marketplace. Opensea's August volume matched 16 year old Etsy's entire second quarter volume. The popular arts and craft site did $3.4 billion in volume in Q two 2021. Ebay's average monthly volume sits at roughly $7.3 billion.
00:26:11.538 - 00:27:04.354, Speaker A: Openc would only need a two and a half times increase in volume to catch ebay. Next Headline the SEC alleges BitConnect swindled retail traders out of $2 billion on Wednesday, the securities and Exchange Commission filed an action against BitConnect, its founder and its top US. Promoter, alleging that they defrauded retail investors out of $2 billion through an unregistered and fraudulent offering of digital assets. Specifically, the SEC's complaint targets BitConnect's lending program. The regulator claims that BitConnect tricked investors into depositing money onto the platform by falsely advertising a volatility trading bot that would generate large returns. Instead of deploying the capital. The SEC alleges that BitConnect siphoned investor funds to personal wallets to the tune of $2 billion.
00:27:04.354 - 00:28:09.450, Speaker A: Quote we allege that these defendants stole billions of dollars from retail investors around the world by exploiting their interest in digital assets, said Laura Shalif Miraban, associate regional director of the SEC's New York regional office. We will aggressively pursue and hold accountable those who engage in misconduct in the digital asset space. In other regulatory news, SEC Chair Gary Gensler continued to set his sights on crypto, giving a talk to the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. In his speech, the two areas he cited specifically as needing attention were trading and lending platforms. Quote Whether they be centralized or so called decentralized finance platforms and stablecoins, which he noted were involved in almost three quarters of crypto trades. Tether has petitioned the New York Supreme Court to block CoinDesk and other publications from receiving documents revealing the composition of Tether reserves over the past few years. The stablecoin issuer claims that releasing such information would tilt the competitive playing field against Tether in favor of other stablecoins.
00:28:09.450 - 00:28:56.870, Speaker A: Avanti, a digital asset bank, filed an application to become a Federal Reserve member bank, becoming the first crypto bank to seek federal supervision directly from the Fed itself. The move, if approved, would allow Avanti access to the Fed's payment system and thereby quicker and cheaper order processing. Next Headline Binance.com added to Investor alert list by Singapore regulator The Monetary Authority of Singapore, the main financial regulator in that country, has placed Binance.com on its Investor Alert list. Its country specific site, Binance SG, is a separate entity and is not on the list. Last week, Binance SG hired Richard Tang, the former chief regulatory officer of the Singapore Stock Exchange, as its CEO.
00:28:56.870 - 00:29:45.830, Speaker A: Binance.com, however, has come under regulatory scrutiny and pressure these last few months, with multiple jurisdictions from Europe to Asia making enforcement actions or issuing warnings about the exchange. Additionally, its US entity, Binance US suffered a blow recently when recently hired CEO Brian Brooks, also a former regulator, left within a few months. In an interview with the Information this week, Binance.com CEO Changpang Zhao, known as CZ, said quote Regulators around the world are looking at crypto, and when they look at crypto, they do look at us first, given that we are by far the largest player in the market globally. In the interview, CZ also said Binance US plans to go public within three years. Next headline.
00:29:45.830 - 00:30:35.750, Speaker A: Jack Dorsey Plans to Make Bitcoin DeFi a Reality in July, Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey announced plans to create an open source bitcoin platform named TBD. Last Friday, Mike Brock, the cash app exec heading up TBD, gave an update on Twitter, writing quote this is the problem we're going to solve. Make it easy to fund a non custodial wallet anywhere in the world through. A platform to build on and off ramps into Bitcoin. You can think about this as a decentralized exchange for fiat. Brock views TBD as a missing piece for the crypto industry, which, as currently constituted, relies on centralized third parties like Coinbase and Cash app to facilitate fiat transactions. TBD plans to build its project out in the open completely, permissionless intending to allow any non custodial wallet to plug into its decks.
00:30:35.750 - 00:31:24.870, Speaker A: For now, Brock and Dorsey hope to keep TBD bitcoin native. However, as Bitcoin is not a smart contract platform like Ethereum or Solana, the tech stack must improve for TBD to succeed. Brock mentioned Rootstock, a smart contract Bitcoin sidechain, as a possible option for building out the Bitcoin dex. However, he noted, quote, the gaps needed to build this may be too large, which would also have us consider other chains as a bridge. Speaking of Jack Dorsey, according to Mac rumors, Twitter may soon enable users to tip creators with Bitcoin. An unreleased beta version of Twitter's code has an update that would show users how to use Bitcoin, complete with a Lightning network tutorial and information on custodial versus non custodial wallets. Twitter would be partnering with Strike to make this happen if the rumor becomes reality.
00:31:24.870 - 00:32:16.658, Speaker A: Next Headline The Ethereum blockchain split due to a software Bug A bug in Ethereum's most popular software client, Go Ethereum, or Geth, caused the blockchain to split last Friday, August 27. The split can be traced back to August 18, when the Geth team initially disclosed a vulnerability in the software. At the time, the developers did not explain the nature of the bug in an effort to prevent a hack before it was patched. On August 24, Geth released a hot fix for the bug, describing it as, quote, a high severity security issue. By the 27th, it became clear that Geth's efforts to patch the bug fell short, as a subset of Ethereum nodes failed to update their Geth software. This resulted in a chain split, where Ethereum started validating two chains at the same time. Luckily, Ethereum was not truly affected.
00:32:16.658 - 00:33:12.300, Speaker A: Tim Baco, an Ethereum core developer and a previous guest on Unchained, told Decrypt, quote, the bug is serious in that it caused a chainslit, but the effects on the Ethereum Mainet were negligible given that the vast majority of clients had upgraded. Next headline mutant Ape Yacht Club and Loot for Adventurers. Expand NFT boundaries. Two NFT collections went especially viral this week. First, on Saturday, Yuga Labs dropped its Mutant Ape Yacht Club collection, selling 10,000 zombified apes in a Dutch auction that started at three e. Mutant Ape Yacht Club is essentially a sister collection to board Ape Yacht Club, the second largest NFT collection on openc by volume. In addition to the Dutch auction of 10,000 original mutant apes, the launch consisted of an AirDrop of mutant serums to existing board ape holders, allowing them to mint mutant versions of their apes for free.
00:33:12.300 - 00:33:46.370, Speaker A: The project ended up raising $96 million for Yuga Labs. At publishing time, Mutant Apes had the 8th highest volume traded on Openc for all time, despite being released less than a week ago. Number two. Last Friday, vine founder Dom Hoffman dropped an 8000 piece NFT collection dubbed Loot for Adventurers. The text based NFT collection quickly caught on. In about a week, Loot has done over $60 million in volume and currently has a market cap of $250,000,000 plus. Rather than a standard JPEG or PNG.
00:33:46.370 - 00:34:46.758, Speaker A: The 8000 Loot NFTs contain walls of text detailing eight specific characteristics randomly generated for scarcity. Each token was minted with a different combination of weapons chest armor, head armor, waist armor, foot armor, hand armor, necklaces and rings. The idea, presumably, is for Loot NFTs to act as a base layer for other games and protocols to interpret essentially any play to earn or web3 game can plug into Loot, download the characteristics, and then spawn its interpretation of a Loot NFT in its game. On a related note, Dom will be releasing a new NFT project in the coming weeks labeled SubDrive, which is an onchain fantasy game console. Next headline ethereum Layer Two competition heats up with launch of Arbitrum Offchain Labs the developer behind Ethereum Layer Two solution Arbitrum launched on Tuesday. The company also announced a $120,000,000 funding round at a valuation of $1.2 billion.
00:34:46.758 - 00:36:04.614, Speaker A: Arbitrum is built to scale Ethereum by using optimistic rollups in which transactions are bundled outside of the main net before being posted on the Ethereum blockchain. Since launch, transactions on Arbitrum have been markedly cheaper than on Ethereum. According to the Defiant East, transfers cost about $1 in gas fees on Arbitrum rather than $11 on Ethereum. Uniswap trades, which require more gas than basic transfers, are currently executing for $5, compared to $81 on Ethereum. Next Headline Cream Finance was involved in a $25 million Hack DFI protocol cream Finance fell prey to a flash loan attack this week in which the hacker escaped with $25 million in crypto. Pexhield, a crypto security firm, explained the attacker was able to make off with the money due to a reentrancy bug, which became available when Cream integrated with Amp token because Amp uses the ERC, the seven seven seven token standard rather than the usual ERC 20 token standard. All right, time for fun bits CryptoPunks are going Hollywood larva Labs, the NFT developer behind Cryptobunks, Me Bits and Autoglyphs, signed a deal with United Talent Agency for representation across film, TV, video games, publishing and licensing.
00:36:04.614 - 00:36:42.970, Speaker A: According to UTA, CryptoPunks would be among the first crypto native IP to enter the traditional entertainment world. Leslie Silverman, head of UTA Digital Assets, told The Hollywood Reporter quote I would say that it is one of the first opportunities for an IP that fully originated in crypto world to enter a broader entertainment space. And they earned it. They have really hit the zeitgeist in a tremendous way.
