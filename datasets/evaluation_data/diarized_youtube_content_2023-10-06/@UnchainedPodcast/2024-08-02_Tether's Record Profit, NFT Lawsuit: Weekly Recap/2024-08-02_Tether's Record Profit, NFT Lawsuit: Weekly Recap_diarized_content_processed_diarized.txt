00:00:01.320 - 00:00:46.404, Speaker A: Welcome to this week's crypto roundup. In today's recap, we cover Tethers record breaking profits, a lawsuit by artists seeking NFT regulatory clarity, Pump Fund's impressive revenue, and the California DMV's blockchain initiative. We also discuss fraud charges against Bitcloud's founder do Kwon's extradition decision, Mount Gox's bitcoin transfers, a governance dispute in the compound protocol, a $4 million exploit on the terra blockchain, and Trump's limited edition bitcoin sneakers. Thanks for tuning in to the weekly news recap. Let's begin. Tether records 5.2 billion profit in first half of 2024 Tether, the issuer of stablecoin USDT, announced on Wednesday a net profit of $5.2
00:00:46.404 - 00:01:25.620, Speaker A: billion for the first half of 2024 as part of its second quarter financial attestation conducted by BDO, an independent accounting firm. The report confirms the accuracy of Tether's financial statements and reserves. In the second quarter, Tether recorded a net operating profit of $1.3 billion. The company's reserves included $97.6 billion in US Treasuries, placing it 18th among global holders of us debt, ahead even of countries such as Germany and Australia. As of June 30, 2024, Tethers consolidated net equity reached nearly $12 billion.
00:01:25.620 - 00:02:05.750, Speaker A: The company faced a $653 million unrealized loss due to falling bitcoin prices, partially offset by a $165 million gain in gold investments. The second quarter also saw tether issue over $8.3 billion in USDT. The company maintains substantial reserves and a consistent revenue base from traditional asset investments. Meanwhile, Coindesk reported that Tethers main competitor, Circle, the issuer of stablecoin, USDC, has a valuation of around $5 billion in the secondary market ahead of its planned IPO, down from a $9 billion valuation in 2022.
00:02:06.690 - 00:02:09.950, Speaker B: Artists file lawsuit over NFT regulatory clarity.
00:02:11.090 - 00:03:09.580, Speaker A: Artists Jonathan Mann and Brian Fry filed a lawsuit against the SEC on Monday seeking clarity on whether NFTs are considered securities. The lawsuit aims to prevent costly legal battles and fines for digital artists who use blockchain technology. Mann and Fry argue that NFTs, which can include visual art, music and videos, should not be classified as securities simply because they exist on a blockchain. Mann criticized SEC chair Gary Gensler's stance, saying it's ludicrous to consider blockchain based art as securities. The lawsuit also references past SEC actions such as cases against impact theory and stoner cats, in which NFT projects were deemed unregistered securities. The artists hope their legal action will push the SEC to provide clear guidelines for the digital art industry. Attorney Jason Gottlieb emphasized that art is a reflection of human creativity protected by the First Amendment and should not be burdened by securities regulations.
00:03:10.670 - 00:03:13.662, Speaker B: Pump fund generates record 25.6 million in.
00:03:13.686 - 00:03:53.524, Speaker A: July revenue Pump Fun, a Solana based token launchpad for meme coins, reported a record $25.6 million in revenue for July, up 16% from June. The platform, launched in February 2024, has seen consistent growth, driven by the popularity of fair launched meme coins that avoid presales and team allocations. In July, the launch of Niro, inspired by the new Shiba Inu adopted by the owner of Doge's Kubosu, contributed significantly to the revenue spike. Niro quickly reached a market cap of $33.5 million. Pump Fund's cumulative revenue now stands at $77.8
00:03:53.524 - 00:04:03.040, Speaker A: million, with projections suggesting it could reach $336 million by year end, highlighting the ongoing demand for meme coin creation services.
00:04:04.330 - 00:04:07.146, Speaker B: California DMV digitizes 42 million car titles.
00:04:07.178 - 00:04:58.440, Speaker A: On blockchain California's Department of Motor Vehicles has digitized 42 million car titles using the Avalanche blockchain network to streamline the title transfer process and reduce fraud. Developed in partnership with Ox head Alpha, this new system allows vehicle titles to be transferred in minutes via a mobile app, eliminating the need for in person visits. The digitization initiative aims to enhance efficiency and security, creating a transparent and tamper proof record of vehicle ownership. John Wu, president of Ava Labs, highlighted the benefits in a blog post stating blockchains maximize efficiency, maintain compliance and protect consumer data. This project represents one of the first steps in California's broader plan to integrate blockchain technology into government operations, promoting automation and improved public services.
00:04:59.770 - 00:05:01.858, Speaker B: Bit Clout founder faces fraud and securities.
00:05:01.914 - 00:05:48.550, Speaker A: Charges Nader al Naji, founder of the crypto social media platform Bitklout, was charged with wire fraud and selling unregistered securities by the US securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice. Arrested on Saturday, al Naji, also known on social media as diamond hands, allegedly raised $257 million from BitCloud's token sales and misappropriated $7 million for personal expenses, including renting a Beverly Hills mansion. The SEC's complaint highlights Al Naji's attempts to disguise bit clout as a decentralized project in order to evade regulations. His family members are also named in the lawsuit for receiving investor funds. If convicted, Al Naji faces up to 20 years in prison for wire fraud.
00:05:49.490 - 00:05:52.190, Speaker B: Do Kwon set to be extradited to South Korea.
00:05:53.110 - 00:06:43.528, Speaker A: Montenegro's Court of Appeals has confirmed an earlier ruling from a lower court saying that terraform Labs co founder Do Kwan should be extradited to South Korea instead of the US. Kwan has been in custody in Montenegro since March 2023 after being arrested for trying to use a fake passport to fly to Dubai. After South Korea submitted its extradition request to try Kwan for his role in the $40 billion collapse of the terra luna ecosystem in May 2022, the US followed with a similar request. Quan's extradition now awaits final approval from Montenegro's minister of justice. No extradition date has been set. Mount Gox transfers 2.2 billion in bitcoin to new wallet the bankrupt crypto exchange Mount Gox has transferred 33,960 BTC, worth about $2.2
00:06:43.528 - 00:07:59.012, Speaker A: billion, to a new wallet, according to Arkham. Arkham suggests that the new wallet likely belongs to Bitgo, one of the five exchanges collaborating with the Mount Gox trustee to repay creditors.

The issues began when a whale known as Humpey and a group of comp holders called the Golden Boys proposed creating a yield bearing protocol called gold comp. The proposal faced significant opposition, however, due to concerns over vote manipulation and centralization. Instead of proceeding with gold comp, Humpey and the golden boys agreed to a counter proposal to develop a new staking product that would distribute 30% of existing and new market reserves annually to staked comp holders, with control maintained by the compound dow. The counter proposal addresses concerns about excessive control by Humpey and the golden boys.
00:07:59.012 - 00:08:27.864, Speaker A: Humpey subsequently agreed to withdraw proposal 289, which had narrowly passed and would have allocated $24 million in Comp tokens to Gold Comp. The resolution, endorsed by key stakeholders like Wintermute and open Zeppelin, has restored market confidence, with comp prices rising by 5% after falling significantly. When the Humpy and the Golden Boys first made their proposal, Terra blockchain halted.
00:08:27.912 - 00:08:31.868, Speaker B: After $4 million token theft exploit the.
00:08:31.884 - 00:09:13.984, Speaker A: Terra blockchain was halted for approximately 4 hours on Tuesday due to an exploit that resulted in the theft of tokens valued at around $4 million. The attacker exploited a known vulnerability in the IBC hooks module, which allows cross chain token transfers and contract calls. The Terra team announced the halt on x, stating that block production would resume only after validators deployed an emergency patch, which was deployed 3 hours later. Security firm Baosin reported that the attacker stole 60 million Astro, 3.5 million USDC, 500,000 USDT and 2.7 BTC. The Astro tokens value plummeted by 55% following the exploit.
00:09:13.984 - 00:09:26.682, Speaker A: Terra developers missed, including the IBC hooks patch and a recent upgrade which led to the breach. The blockchain resumed operations after implementing the emergency fixed time for fun bits Trump's.
00:09:26.706 - 00:09:30.098, Speaker B: Bitcoin sneakers are the latest craze in.
00:09:30.114 - 00:10:16.226, Speaker A: A true Trump fashion twist. A website linked to Donald Trump has released limited edition bitcoin themed sneakers. The bright orange high tops, priced at dollar 500, sold out instantly and are now popping up on eBay for up to $2,500. Who knew crypto could be so stylish? The shoes are marketed as celebrating the future of finance as well as Trump's leadership, making them a must have for bitcoin fans and Trump enthusiasts alike. And if high tops aren't your thing, you can still snag a pair of orange or black low tops for $299. The launch came right after Trump's speech at the 2024 bitcoin conference in Nashville, where the former president promised to support bitcoin if elected. Now fans can show their support with every step.
