00:00:00.560 - 00:00:52.944, Speaker A: Galaxy run a database called Vision Track that measures fund Aum and crypto, right? And they have the measurement on liquid hedge funds and crypto AUM at the end of March at 20 billion. So if you have these estimates on Twitter of like 40 to 50 billion of alt supply coming unlocked in the next two, three years, versus 20 billion of liquid funds caught there to buy the bag or to trade liquid strategies, that creates a really difficult and challenging market dynamic. I think that's the reason why, and I turn this back to probably Joe and Phil, around how you continue to outperform the market as a liquid fund. With that being the supply demand dynamic of tokens. I think that forces more players into derivatives. We continue to see more derivatives volume across our business year over year, almost doubling, I think because that's where there's more alpha. And I also think it's why you see more volume and activity in meme coins.
