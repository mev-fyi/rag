When Robinhood halted purchases of GameStop stock in early 2021, rumors swirled that Robinhood was acquiescing to a request from Citadel. However, the actual reason was because Robinhood did not have enough collateral for the compliance demands from the GameStop mania.
00:05:42.650 - 00:06:39.194, Speaker A: The move to take money from Paradigm, which backs quite a few crypto powerhouses like Compound, Cosmos, Sky, Mavis and Uniswap, is an interesting move by Citadel securities because back in September, founder Ken Griffin said the company did not trade in crypto due to regulatory uncertainty.

After watching the full video, which is a cross between a metaverse hellscape and a cheesy infomercial, I personally would say the answer is no. The idea is bold and familiar. If you have kept up with NFTs and DAOs recently, Cryptoland is attempting to purchase an island in Fiji through the sale of NFTs.
00:12:12.834 - 00:12:45.210, Speaker A: After that, the details get sketchy. For one, it appears the island's acreage is smaller than the amount offered in the NFT sale. More humorously basic questions such as how would the island get plumbing? Were not particularly well covered. Alright, thanks so much for joining us today.
