00:00:00.440 - 00:00:13.177, Speaker A: Ethereum's base layer fees have dropped significantly due to layer 2 scaling solutions. But could high fees ever return? We asked some of the top experts in the space for their thoughts. First up is Urvit Goel from Optimism.
00:00:13.281 - 00:00:28.929, Speaker B: I hope so. And what I mean by that is with the blockchain, right, if there's high fees, that means there's usage. And you know, in our view of the world is like there will be many L2s and we do think that they will generate enough demand for the ultimate settlement layer, which is Ethereum.
00:00:29.057 - 00:00:33.901, Speaker A: Next we asked Steven Goldfetter from Offchain Labs, the developer firm behind Arbitrum.
00:00:33.973 - 00:01:00.269, Speaker B: There's no, there's no daylight between Ethereum is a layer one and Layer Twos. We're all working to a unified goal of creating that capacity for this surge that we're seeing and I believe will only continue to accelerate them. So yeah, there may be times where we've created excess capacity and now, you know, transaction fees are lower on layer one and there's less demand there. But ultimately I think in order to scale, we're going to need a super performant layer one and a really performant Layer two is on top of that.
00:01:00.317 - 00:01:07.473, Speaker A: Omar Azar from Matter Labs, the company behind zk, saying thinks we could see higher fees under certain conditions potentially.
00:01:07.569 - 00:01:26.225, Speaker C: I mean, I think we still haven't seen the blobs get fully congested. ETH is still going to be the most secure base layer right between all the L2s and so I think there is room for much more higher value transactions to still be being done on eth and eventually that will be pretty frequently done.
00:01:26.265 - 00:01:30.045, Speaker A: Right, and when do you think that will happen?
00:01:30.495 - 00:01:56.599, Speaker C: Honestly, I'm hoping 2025. This is like the big boom here. We'll see. I think just seeing the activity on the different types of things being built, whether it's rwa tokenization, a lot of activity there. You got teams like, I mean you got, you know, institutions like BlackRock getting very bullish on tokenization. On the consumer side, obviously, you know, you've got Coinbase and Base going very heavy on commerce. You're seeing a lot of like gaming ecosystem game, large game developers.
00:01:56.599 - 00:02:06.085, Speaker C: Come on Chain. I think all this is like going to lead to a very overall bullish 2025 for what can you do on Chain?
00:02:06.205 - 00:02:09.917, Speaker A: Finally, Alessandro Masi from P2P offers his thoughts.
00:02:10.021 - 00:02:56.801, Speaker D: Well, today if you have a big chunk of users, more than chunk of users, a big adoption in place, I think it's never, I mean, in the sense that right now L1 is not meant to is not able to scale up on those levels, and that's why the whole L2 roadmap came into play. So I think today, if it happens, yes, but right now we are in this bear market. I don't know what to call it somehow to counter argument myself. It might also be that most of users will actually live on L2s, which means that less, let's say, congestion will be on L1. So it's difficult to predict the future in that sense.
00:02:56.873 - 00:03:07.525, Speaker A: So will Ethereum's base layer ever see high fees again? The experts seem to think it's possible. Possible, especially as L2s grow and drive more activity. What do you think? Let us know in the comments below.
