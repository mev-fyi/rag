00:01:02.202 - 00:01:15.842, Speaker B: Laura, thanks so much for having me. I just got back from Staples to get these new headphones. Did Bitcoin fall back below 40,000? I haven't looked at Price in a little while. Where are we right now?
00:01:15.976 - 00:01:26.870, Speaker A: Well, last I checked, which maybe was like half an hour or 40 minutes ago, it was at, but I did see that it had dipped to 37 in the interim.
00:01:27.790 - 00:01:31.690, Speaker B: And God only knows what the price will be when this gets out to your audience.
00:01:33.470 - 00:01:35.020, Speaker A: Are you going to drop some?
00:01:35.550 - 00:01:36.300, Speaker B: No.
00:01:37.790 - 00:01:45.354, Speaker A: Well, so that's why I invited you on the show. You are the first guest on Unconfirmed in 2021.
00:01:45.472 - 00:01:46.650, Speaker B: It's exciting.
00:01:47.010 - 00:02:11.078, Speaker A: I think we can all safely say that this is going to be a big year for crypto, if the first days of the year are any indication. Okay, so you actually did write what your predictions are for the year, but before we even get into that, let's just look back at the similarly, I think actually really significant year in crypto for 2020. What would you say were the big stories that year?
00:02:11.164 - 00:03:01.158, Speaker B: I mean, if you look at the data, you have a number of big stories for 2020, right? The growth of the stablecoin market, seeing a supply above 5 billion, trading volumes reaching an all time high, monthly high in the month of December. We put out a lot of figures around trading and stablecoins in the past few weeks. And so you just saw the growth of the market and the build out of a more robust market structure. So I think that's kind of like the high level overview of 2020. And I think that's why investors right now are getting so excited about what 2021 holds, because you have this growth story from the year prior. So I think people are really excited. And you're right, it's going to be interesting to continue to watch, that's for sure.
00:03:01.158 - 00:03:04.614, Speaker B: Aside from Price, just for the development of the market.
00:03:04.812 - 00:03:45.554, Speaker A: Yeah. My two big takeaways, I think. Well, so first of all, I think partially because of the pandemic, bitcoin, I think was just like the big story last know, we just saw, I feel like, kind of a new type of person who was acknowledging what its merits were and getting in. And then of know, the big news with things like PayPal and MicroStrategy and square and mass mutual putting bitcoin on their balance. Know, I don't know if those things would have happened even without the pandemic, but given what the state of the world was, I definitely feel like all those forces came together to create the perfect conditions. Yeah, it took a while, though.
00:03:45.592 - 00:04:25.142, Speaker B: It took a little bit of a while. I remember at the beginning of the pandemic in March when everything was falling, crypto and beyond, folks were kind of thinking that maybe crypto bitcoin specifically wasn't living up to that safe haven characteristic that so many folks have attributed to. So, you know, I think once we had the palter Jones news come out, you kind of saw those dominoes fall with more investors, more hedge funds, and then actual publicly traded companies, in some cases announcing that they'd be allocating to the space. And so it's been interesting to see that unravel.
00:04:25.306 - 00:05:01.402, Speaker A: Yeah, and the other funny thing is that early on in unchained. Well, no, I know. It was actually the first why bitcoin now episode that I did with Mike Novogratz and Raoul Pell. And I did ask, hey, like on black Thursday, why did bitcoin not act as a safe haven asset, as everybody says it would? And they, you know, maybe that day didn't. But we are seeing institutional investors who are viewing it that way and who are getting in. And I said, okay, well, then why hasn't the price risen? They said, well, it takes these kinds of companies a while. And they were right.
00:05:01.402 - 00:05:28.920, Speaker A: They were like, it's going to happen. It's just behind the scenes right now. But one other thing I was going to say about your comments about kind of like just the maturation of the space, in a way, what was interesting is I just feel like it looked quite different from 2017 in the sense that that looked very thin and it was very much based on hype. And this time around, it feels like it's more based on substance, which is more interesting to me. All right.
00:05:30.810 - 00:06:05.266, Speaker B: I just add one thing to that. The institutions really delivered in 2020 in a way that maybe the retail side of the market didn't. Like in 2020, we didn't see things like an ETF come to market, right, which many folks think would open up the floodgates to more retail participants or firms like Charles Schwab or TD Ameritrade or Fidelity offer retail products, which many people were hoping that they do. But we saw, to your point, a lot of hedge funds and larger firms get in. So you kind of had this like tale of two crypto markets in a sense.
00:06:05.448 - 00:06:07.842, Speaker A: Oh yeah, and reversed from last time.
00:06:07.896 - 00:06:10.558, Speaker B: Because last time reversed from 2017.
00:06:10.734 - 00:06:13.106, Speaker A: The wall of institutional money that did.
00:06:13.128 - 00:06:15.300, Speaker B: Not materialize, that did not come. Yeah.
00:06:15.910 - 00:06:21.878, Speaker A: All right, so let's talk about what you think will be the big crypto stories for 2021.
00:06:22.044 - 00:07:36.990, Speaker B: I think that kind of adding to that point. I think we will be disappointed in some respects about the entrance of firms like Fidelity and Charles Schwab and TD. I don't think that we're going to see any type of retail crypto trading products come out of those firms in the next few quarters. On the flip side, we saw PayPal come in, which kind of helps to an extent, but we're going to see limited activity on the retail brokerage side. I think we're also going to see limited activity on the side of the large investment banks inasmuch as I don't think that in the next few quarters at least they're going to be trading physical cryptocurrencies themselves even though we have this guidance from the OCC that they can store crypto custody assets. I just don't think, given what I know about where these teams are, that they're going to be trading it themselves anytime soon and the market is still, even at a trillion dollars, a bit too small for them to do so. But we're definitely going to see the market continue to develop on the institutional side with prime brokerage building out and firms like Genesis, Galaxy, and there are many other market making firms, B two, C two, which just got acquired by CBI Group.
00:07:36.990 - 00:08:31.466, Speaker B: All of these firms are rapidly expanding their capabilities. So we're going to definitely continue to see that. We're going to see the headcount of these firms expand, in some cases double, in some cases triple from what they are currently as they try to offer deeper liquidity, more white glove services for firms that are looking to put on these large 100 million, 500 million positions, in some cases Alla, MicroStrategy, Ala Square. So we'll see more of that I think we'll see in lockstep with these trading capabilities expand, more publicly traded companies look to follow in the footsteps of Square and MicroStrategy to allocate a portion of their balance sheet to Bitcoin. I've spoken with folks like Michael Morrow who runs Genesis Global Trading. He anticipates more than 100 companies that are publicly listed will do just that. So we're going to see retail brokerage sit on the sidelines.
00:08:31.466 - 00:09:37.466, Speaker B: We're going to see probably investment banks continue to sit on the sidelines in terms of crypto trading itself. We're going to see still the trading market structure develop and change in many interesting ways. I think going into 2021 you're going to have firms like Coinbase and other exchanges experiment with new types of liquidity or market making incentive programs so they can bring more liquidity onto the platform. That could take the form of something like inverted maker. Traditionally exchanges provide rebates to folks who are adding liquidity or making markets on their venue. You could see some schemes where they're actually maybe paying takers, which is something that CrossTower and Upstart Exchange does. But you're going to see across the board folks just experimenting with these fee schedules that they have and as a result potentially you could see those retail fees then maybe come down and that could also be expediated by things like payment for order flow becoming more of a thing, so to speak, in the crypto markets.
00:09:37.466 - 00:10:01.260, Speaker B: Basically the way that Robinhood and other brokerages and equities make money, you could see that continue to seep into cryptocurrency markets, which could also help with the fees. So that other element would be just the continual maturation and development of the market structure itself. So those are some of the main things that I'm going to be looking for in 2021 and that I'm excited about.
00:10:01.710 - 00:10:24.882, Speaker A: So we're going to discuss a little bit more about how the crypto exchange business and some other businesses in the crypto space will change in 2021. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible. Crypto.com, the crypto super app that lets you buy, earn and spend crypto all in one place. Earn up to 8.5% per year on your BTC. Download the Crypto.com
00:10:24.882 - 00:10:51.934, Speaker A: app now to see the interest rates you could be earning on BTC and more than 20 other coins. Once in the app, you can apply for the Crypto.com Metal card which pays you up to 8% cash back instantly. Reserve years now in the crypto.com app. Back to my conversation with Frank Shaparo of the Block. So earlier when you were talking about how crypto exchanges might change their fee schedule, what would be the motivation for Mean?
00:10:51.972 - 00:11:56.866, Speaker B: Basically the idea is to just create a better product and a better market structure for their venue. It's something know, we see in traditional equities. Know folks that are working at firms like Coinbase. You have someone like Vishal Gupta who's the head of Exchange. They're trying to bring best practices from the traditional world to the cryptocurrency world to basically make for more efficient markets, more efficient pricing and the fee aspect and the pricing aspect is one element. You're also seeing a number of firms try to improve the data capabilities of the market, right? So you look across Bitcoin, any observer or market participant knows that it's often difficult to know exactly what the price of Bitcoin is at any given moment. So you have a number of firms that are looking to remedy that and are looking to create new index products around the Bitcoin market to solve for that S and P 500.
00:11:56.866 - 00:12:38.126, Speaker B: You have CBOE, which recently announced at the end of last year that they'd be getting in the market to solve for just that. So a lot of what these exchanges and new market participants are looking to do is improve the efficiency of trading and to make the market more robust. And you're seeing that happen even if you just look at things like spread and volatility. Volatility relative to 2017 is a lot lower. And the spreads between the exchanges, the price at which bitcoin trades across various exchanges has tightened as well. So we're already reaping some of the benefits of these initiatives, and at the.
00:12:38.148 - 00:12:50.450, Speaker A: End of the year, or really the latter half, we started to see a lot of big regulatory actions in the space. One of the biggest ones was against ripple by the SEC. How do you think things like that will affect exchanges?
00:12:50.870 - 00:13:33.710, Speaker B: So I was talking with an executive at an exchange who is responsible for aspects of the listing process. And so my thesis going into this year was that you'd have a number of exchanges think about clamping down on new listings or at least reconsidering the listings process. I think there's an aspect of that. I think exchanges are under pressure from a scaling perspective as it is to roll out new products to onboard new clients, and so they don't want to get entangled in regulatory dramas related to listings. So maybe that would make them a bit more conservative or potentially delist things which you saw with bittrex. Right. They delisted a number of privacy coins.
00:13:33.710 - 00:14:38.034, Speaker B: But there's also this other sentiment, and this is the sentiment that was expressed by this one executive that I'm talking about, which is you don't want to fall into the trap of every time a regulator says something about a coin that you immediately delist it, or you set the precedent that it's kind of like the coin is guilty until is guilty rather than innocent until proven guilty. And so that's something that exchanges right now are being highly sensitive about in terms of moving too quickly. I think that's why you see kraken moving a little bit slowly and why you saw coinbase, which many people, even though they only took about a week, many folks thought they'd get that done or delist XRP within a day. Right. And they're not taking an approach like that. And I don't think many exchanges are. I think the ones that kind of got out there really early on were maybe trying to do it for the marketing, but they're taking these decisions very seriously.
00:14:38.034 - 00:15:14.340, Speaker B: And so I think you have these two forces. A desire to not move too quickly and completely bend a knee to the regulators, which is very important in crypto, which is to some degree moving against the grain of the regulatory forces. But also this desire of like or this feeling of I don't want additional pressure when volumes are exploding and Bitcoin is surging towards 40,000. There's just so many other problems I have that I don't want to bring regulatory issues in as well.
00:15:14.790 - 00:15:29.746, Speaker A: Well, so you referenced how bittrex announced that it'll be delisting the privacy coins. Monero zcash and Dash do you think that this is just the start of kind guess, you know, delistings or suspensions of privacy coins from exchanges?
00:15:29.938 - 00:15:56.810, Speaker B: I think that this is definitely going to be something that could spill over into other markets. I think the fact that Bittrex did it was fascinating because they're not necessarily known for being at the forefront of handling regulatory affairs as well as some other exchanges. I think some folks might make that argument. So the fact that they got ahead of this early on I think is a canary in the coal mine, perhaps.
00:15:56.970 - 00:16:04.578, Speaker A: Yeah. I did see though, Jesse Powell of Kraken, the CEO there, he said that he wondered if it was something specific.
00:16:04.664 - 00:16:12.802, Speaker B: To their exchange, as in they facilitated certain types of transactions without doing proper.
00:16:12.856 - 00:16:57.954, Speaker A: KYC, something like that. But I did notice that the timing of it was around the same time that there were new anti money laundering initiatives that were passed in Congress, something like that. I actually should have looked up the exact news before I decided to spontaneously mention it on the show, but I remember thinking like, oh, I wonder if this also like if they're just being extra cautious. But yeah, this is something I'm watching a lot because obviously with the regulations against self hosted wallets and in general just a lot of regulatory fire coming the way of privacy. Yeah, it does feel like this fits into a broader narrative as well and.
00:16:57.992 - 00:17:45.230, Speaker B: It'S really tough right now for exchanges. I mean, on the regulatory side, I hear so many war stories out of the legal and compliance department of these exchanges because it's really tough. And once you had the treasury come out with this proposal for rulemaking around non custodial wallets, you just had across the landscape exchange compliance professionals working day in and day out, around the clock to just get ahead of anything that could come down the pike. And I'm talking 1516 hours days. So that's another story. It'd be interesting to see how that pans out in 2021, but so far it's something that's really top of mind for a lot of firms.
00:17:45.590 - 00:17:55.330, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm really wondering what's going to happen. So one other huge crypto news event that's on the horizon will be the Coinbase IPO later this year.
00:17:55.400 - 00:17:57.080, Speaker B: Oh yeah, that's very interesting.
00:17:57.690 - 00:17:58.918, Speaker A: What are you looking for when it.
00:17:58.924 - 00:18:49.110, Speaker B: Comes to mean we want to know what know we're going to see this kick off. There's so many unanswered questions that I'm excited about finding out, like who are the other investment bankers involved? Right. We know that Goldman Sachs is involved, but there's going to be quite a number of other ones who kind of assist in this process. You could see maybe galaxy. I'd like to see a crypto native banking firm on the roster so we'll be looking out for that. Also interested in the form of the IPO. I don't think it's been reported whether or not this will be a direct listing or a traditional IPO, or the new direct listing mechanism that the New York Stock Exchange just got approved, which is effectively a direct listing that allows for a capital raise in addition to the direct listing.
00:18:49.110 - 00:18:53.414, Speaker B: So we don't have any of those questions answered to my knowledge, or whether.
00:18:53.452 - 00:18:55.654, Speaker A: There will be a Coin component or.
00:18:55.692 - 00:19:28.586, Speaker B: Whether there'll be an ethereum based Coin component or whether it will list on New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq. These are all open. What I do sense is that it's coming very soon. Right. I had reached out for one story and originally the firm sort of came back and said they were in a quiet period. They then sort of came back and said that they weren't in a quiet period. So you're approaching this moment where we're going to find out more information about the degree or rather what this exactly is going to look like.
00:19:28.586 - 00:19:30.690, Speaker B: So we're getting close that we know for sure.
00:19:30.760 - 00:19:36.980, Speaker A: And when you say soon, last I heard was kind of like second half of 2021. But are you saying it could come earlier than that?
00:19:39.370 - 00:19:41.814, Speaker B: I think it could come within the first half of the year.
00:19:41.932 - 00:19:42.342, Speaker A: Oh wow.
00:19:42.396 - 00:20:12.766, Speaker B: Definitely. Yeah. Okay. The firm just recently hired a head of investor relations from Facebook to sort know in the early stages of this process you're going to want to do the roadshow, you're going to want know build a book of potential investors from the public markets. And so that's going to be fun to watch. It's going to be interesting to see how Coinbase positions itself as a company to Wall Street. Right.
00:20:12.766 - 00:21:04.746, Speaker B: They're kind of many different things. They're a brokerage firm, they're an exchange, they have a Silicon Valley brand. The gentleman whom they hired is from Facebook. So that kind of maybe gives an indication that they're going to want to position themselves as a tech growth story rather than a sleepy, boring brokerage custodian. That raises the other question of who's going to cover this stock, which is a more wonky pedantic question that may not be super interesting to your listeners, but is it going to be the guys who cover brokerage firms or is it going to be the folks that cover exchanges or the folks that know tech firms? So that remains to be seen, and it remains to be seen how Coinbase will shape that narrative. Obviously there's one very obvious narrative of this being like the crypto company. So if you're uncomfortable getting some sort of exposure to Bitcoin directly, look no further to Coinbase shares.
00:21:04.746 - 00:21:06.320, Speaker B: So we'll see if that.
00:21:08.470 - 00:21:27.378, Speaker A: A way. The fact that Coinbase isn't easily categorized reminds me in a way of how cryptocurrency itself is also not easily categorized. So yeah, I feel like there's just this new frontier that we're creating. Anyway, well, it's been so fun chatting with you. Thanks so much for coming on Unconfirmed.

Thanks for tuning in to this week's News recap. First Headline Total crypto market cap reaches $1 trillion for the first time with little hype compared to 2017 the total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies reached $1 trillion for the first time on Wednesday, with bitcoin soaring to $37,000 3 hours after surpassing a new alltime high of $36,000.
00:22:43.166 - 00:24:01.930, Speaker A: As of press time, the price breached $40,000 for the first time, a huge milestone for the twelve year old cryptocurrency. JPMorgan analysts speculate that bitcoin's price could reach $146,000 over the long term, with their strategists saying that the king of crypto is competing with gold for investment flows. Meanwhile, number two, crypto Ethereum, has surpassed one $200, a price level not seen since the last bubble at the beginning of 2018. Amid these high flying prices, the Block reports that cryptocurrency exchanges are seeing high levels of traffic, with total visits in December alone reaching 196,000,000, up from 79 million a year prior. Coinbase, which will be going public later this year, struggled with connectivity issues for 6 hours on Wednesday before finally resolving the issue. Next Headline OCC Says Banks can use Stablecoins The Office of the Controller of the Currency published an interpretive letter on Monday saying federally regulated banks may use stablecoins for payments and other activities. They can also participate in blockchain networks, Kristen Smith, executive director of the Blockchain Association, tweeted quote the letter states that blockchains have the same status as other global financial networks such as Swift, ACH and Fedwire.
00:24:01.930 - 00:24:56.250, Speaker A: Next headline. Ripple and XRP roundup. The follow continues for Ripple. After the SEC announced it was filing charges against the company and two executives last month, Tetragon, the lead investor of Ripple's $200 million Series C funding, has filed suit against the company in light of the SEC's charges. The complaint seeks to, quote, enforce its contractual right to require Ripple to redeem its Series C's preferred stock or, in plain English, give its money back. Tetragon is also attempting to freeze Ripple from using any liquid assets until the payment is made. Since the SEC announced the lawsuit, the number of XRP whale addresses has fallen more than 8% as many prominent crypto exchanges have delisted or suspended XRP trading firms to have announced delistings and trading suspensions include Coinbase Crypto.com,
00:24:56.250 - 00:25:39.610, Speaker A: which disclosure is a sponsor of my Shows, Genesis, Blockchain.com and Binance. US. Grayscale has also removed XRP from its large cap crypto fund and halted new subscriptions to the Grayscale XRP Trust. Bitwise has also liquidated its position in XRP from its Bitwise Ten crypto index fund. Next Headline Coinbase and a 16 Z prepare challenge to proposed crypto wallet rules Top crypto Exchange, Coinbase and venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz are planning to challenge in court the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network's proposed crypto wallet rules should they become law. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and Andreessen Horowitz's Catherine Hahn announced their intentions in dual tweets on Monday.
00:25:39.610 - 00:26:23.574, Speaker A: Hahn, a formal federal prosecutor, said the proposed rules by Finsen to subject all crypto wallets, including those that are self hosted to know your customer reporting requirements would have, quote, many foreseeable and unintended negative consequences. The rule is also being criticized because of the rushed process by which it is being considered. As Jerry Britto of Coins Center. Tweeted the original official deadline given was January 4. However, on that day, the deadline was extended to January 7 with a quiet change on the website. As he tweeted, quote, Commenters raced to honor the January 4 deadline and were never notified of a change before the end of that day. As a result, they were effectively afforded not the promised 15 days, but only twelve.
00:26:23.574 - 00:27:17.714, Speaker A: He added. Serious commenters could have used the three extra days. This lends more fuel to the contention that the process violates the Administrative Procedures Act. Next Headline Vitalik Breaks Down Rollups Scalability has been the big issue facing Ethereum well ever since inception, but even more urgently since 2017. This week, creator Vitalik Buterin published a post explaining the differences between the three major types of layer two scaling currently available channels, plasma and rollups. But he does a deep dive on Rollups to explain why they, quote, are poised to be the key scalability solution for Ethereum for the foreseeable future. There is a detailed explanation of the two different types of rollups optimistic rollups and ZK rollups, including a chart laying out the trade offs between the two and how much scaling you can expect to receive with roll ups.
00:27:17.714 - 00:28:19.334, Speaker A: Vitalik's take is quote in the short term, optimistic roll ups are likely to win out for general purpose EVM computation, and ZK rollups are likely to win out for simple payments, exchange and other application specific use cases. But in the medium to long term, ZK rollups will win out in all use cases as ZK snark technology improves. Next Headline Shapeshift Goes Full DeFi Shapeshift CEO Eric Voorhees announced on Wednesday that the trading platform quote has integrated decentralized exchange protocols and is sunsetting its six plus year business of trading with customers. The change means that Shapeshift users will no longer be required to provide personal identifying information to use its services.

The recap starts with, of course, the biggest story of the year bitcoin, noting that its total market value crossed $500 billion. The emergence of stablecoins as critical infrastructure and the rise of DFI are also covered, and retail and merchant access through Square and PayPal is as well. It's a good, comprehensive look at the major trends of the last year, and it ends on regulation, which I think we'll see is a big driver of news this coming year. And there's a second fun bit, which is XRP Army Storms SEC. Leave it to Crypto Twitter to make a mashup of big news from the crypto world, which is the SEC's lawsuit against Ripple and the real world, which in this case was the mob that stormed Capitol Hill on Wednesday. Small, ting tweeted, of course, in all Caps breaking News XRP Army has stormed SEC headquarters.
