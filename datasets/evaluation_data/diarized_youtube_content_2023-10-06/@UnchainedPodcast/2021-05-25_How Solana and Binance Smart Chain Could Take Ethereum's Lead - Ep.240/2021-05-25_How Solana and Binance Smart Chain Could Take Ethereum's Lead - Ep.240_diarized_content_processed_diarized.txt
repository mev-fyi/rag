Today's episode is sponsored by EY Blockchain. Ernst Young is committed to supporting integration of the world's business ecosystems on the public Ethereum blockchain. Today's topic is whether Ethereum needs to worry about these ETH killers, the new generation of them, the prime examples being Solana and Binance smart chain. Here to discuss are Kane Warwick, founder of Synthetix, and Kyle Simani, managing partner at Multicoin Capital. Welcome, Kane and Kyle.
00:01:36.982 - 00:01:37.914, Speaker B: Thanks for having us.
00:01:37.952 - 00:01:42.586, Speaker C: Hey, Laura, good to be back on the show. I'm looking forward to this. This will be a fun, spicy debate.
00:01:42.698 - 00:01:44.720, Speaker B: Yeah, should be good.
00:01:46.690 - 00:02:15.426, Speaker A: Know, I know that was exactly what Kane and I were discussing when we were figuring out who his conversation partner should be. So listeners should know that the impetus for this show was a recent Tweet storm that Kane wrote up saying that he was concerned about the Solana and Binance smart chain communities, quote, genuinely gaining organic traction, much more so than, say, EOS or Tron of the last cycle. Kane, can you explain your thoughts more on this score?
00:02:15.618 - 00:03:02.294, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think back in 2017, 2018, tron and EOS made a pretty decent attempt at generating some traction and getting smart contract developers to migrate. Certainly EOS threw a lot of money at that process and we just saw that they didn't really get much traction. Obviously it was a different part of the market cycle. It was a bear market. It was much harder to get traction back then. But what we're seeing now, especially with the high gas prices on Ethereum, is that there appears to be a bit of an opportunity for chains like Solana and Binance Smart chain to really start chipping away at the ETH dominance. And my thread was really about a bit of a wake up call.
00:03:02.294 - 00:03:11.820, Speaker B: I think that the ETH community can't just be oblivious to this, that this is actually happening, and we need to at least consider the momentum that these chains are getting.
00:03:12.990 - 00:03:30.750, Speaker A: And Kyle, I'm just curious, do you agree with Kane's description? And I'm assuming that you would not be super concerned about this because you have invested in both Solana and Binance. So what's your take on what you're seeing?
00:03:30.820 - 00:04:21.360, Speaker C: Yeah, so I'll preface everything, I'll preface this kind of whole podcast episode by saying that multicoin is quite long ETH we're more long ETH and Bitcoin, and we're even more long that on Sol. And yeah, we're long kind of all of the primary subjects of this conversation. We have felt for a long time that the Ethereum approach to scaling was just not going to be sufficient. Not that it won't work, but it will just not be enough. And two years ago, that was kind of a fuzzy claim, but there just wasn't enough kind of clarity on how exactly it was going to work, but our intuition was that it just wasn't going to get there. And fast forward today, and we have a reasonable sense of how the ZK roll ups are going to work and how the optimistic rollups are going to work. And we can kind of sort of reason about how the interoperability between these things will work.
00:04:21.360 - 00:05:05.850, Speaker C: And I feel more convicted than ever that the scaling solutions that are here today for the Ethereum Ecosystem are simply not enough. I think Solana is not sufficient by probably two to three orders of magnitude. I think what Ethereum Ecosystem is proposing is five or six orders of magnitude away from being sufficient. But I've just always thought you have to just try other angles and see where these things go. And the primary constraints is just parallelism. And I think that's super important. And I think it's very important for the long term health of all decentralized finance and all of crypto to make sure we maximally explore the full design, space and trade offs of these different ways to scale, as opposed to being dogmatic about which set of ideologies is the right approach.
00:05:05.850 - 00:05:13.022, Speaker C: We're bullish all three approaches, obviously to different degrees, but we certainly think all three have a lot of room to run over the next twelve to 24 months.
00:05:13.156 - 00:05:20.660, Speaker A: And when you mentioned that about parallelism, are you saying because you just feel like sharding is not the way to go, or what did you mean by that?
00:05:21.430 - 00:06:09.730, Speaker C: If you look at roll ups, roll ups specifically break what I call logical centralization meaning in a roll up, if you have a transaction happening in the base layer, the base layer doesn't know what roll ups are. It's actually just not a logical concept that exists in the base layer. And similarly, if you're in a roll up, roll ups don't know what other roll ups are either. And so there are ways to bridge those things together into semi ish seamless ways to make them interact with each other, but it by definition requires some additional developer tax. That developer tax, whether it's some sort of state channel interface over Connect or something, over THORChain or something, over some of whatever Starquare is doing some stuff and ZK Sync guys are doing some stuff. There's a whole bunch of people working on different theoretical ways to bridge all of these things together. I have no particular views of which of those methodologies is best.
00:06:09.730 - 00:06:44.400, Speaker C: In fact, there probably isn't a best. They all have different trade offs. And so as you look at how kind of this heterogeneous layer two world is going to evolve, there's going to be different layer twos, and there's going to be multiple instances of the same layer two. Tech and then different text and making all those things interoperate across zeroledge flavors, optimistic flavors, different latency flavors, depending on what the user's preferences are, what the gas fees are at the moment in the network. There's just a tremendous amount of complexity in all of these things. To be clear, none of these problems are intractable. Like they're all by definition tractable problems.
00:06:44.400 - 00:07:11.250, Speaker C: But the amount of developer tax it will create for developers to provide a good user experience will be very, very substantial. By definition. That means developers will spend a pretty large percentage of their time and energy dealing with all of what I'll just call this plumbing crap instead of actually building good user facing applications. And so as I think about kind of long term horizon development, I think that's very concerning of just like developers are going to have to spend too much time thinking about this stuff. And so that's kind of the primary concern.
00:07:11.330 - 00:07:33.790, Speaker A: And so do you have an idea for how Ethereum could scale in a better fashion? Or is it just simply that you think it goes back to that scalability? You know, obviously Binance smart chain and Solana are more centralized. So is it just simply that you think at this point the best solution is just to have a more centralized chain and to compromise on decentralization?
00:07:36.290 - 00:07:56.920, Speaker C: The Skipper trial limit is basically not correct for the most part in degrees of correctness matter. So like today Ethereum people will tell you it runs on a $500 laptop. That's not true. Look at the gas limit now. I think it's 15 million, if I'm not mistaken, per block. That's not running on a $500 laptop. Like it's just not going to happen.
00:07:56.920 - 00:08:38.126, Speaker C: $1,000 laptop is more realistic and that's probably generous. If you look at Salana today Salon is running on like call it a $3,000 server, $3,500 server. So what we're talking about here is like a three to four x difference in price on what hardware you need to do it. So let's be clear about what that just in absolute dollar terms what that means. And it's not 20 x difference or 50 x difference, it's three to four. The second thing that matters is then to say is, okay, obviously if the hard requirements are higher by definition, there are fewer computers in the world of a higher hardware, of the higher hardware standard. But to what degree fewer computers? And then what's the diminishing marginal return of having like as you go from 1000 nodes to 10,000 nodes, you get some marginal degree of censorship resistance.
00:08:38.126 - 00:09:37.480, Speaker C: As you go from 10,000 nodes to 100,000 nodes, you are by definition getting less censorship resistance. This explicitly has diminishing returns. And so when I look at people say you're compromising on the trilemma, it's like, true in a very theoretical sense, but in a practical sense, does it matter? And to the degree that the hardware cost matters, it's like, okay, is $3,000, is that the delta or is it like something else? The Bitcoin and Ethereum Communities both had very strong ideological beliefs on, let's call it hardware costs as the primary constraint, which was fine, those beliefs are reasonable, but there was no God forsaken reason to believe that those were the right bounds to use. And I think it's actually quite important to test what those bounds should be. Whether the number is 4000, whether number is 25,000, whether the number is 200,000. Probably shouldn't be 200,000, probably shouldn't be 25,000 below 4000. It's like pretty gray to me, and it's not that clear to me that the answer has to be below 1000.
00:09:38.170 - 00:09:44.838, Speaker A: Kane, what do you make of what Kyle saying and his take on your Tweets for him?
00:09:45.004 - 00:10:26.514, Speaker B: Look, I think broadly it's accurate and I don't disagree that there is going to be a lot of thrashing. I mean, we're in the middle of this right now, right? Like, the Synthetics project has spent upwards of 75% of its resources over the last six months working on scaling right now. That's an investment that we decided was worthwhile making, and it's an investment that's going to pay off for the rest of the community because we're going through a lot of issues that other people then subsequently won't. Chain Link is doing the same thing with us. There's a couple of other projects, uniswap, et cetera, that are kind of taking the brunt of this work, but I don't think it goes away.
00:10:26.552 - 00:10:29.954, Speaker A: Just to be clear, are you talking about I'm talking with optimism.
00:10:30.002 - 00:11:02.000, Speaker B: You're working with optimism. Yeah. To get through optimistic roll ups and get through the process of working out how to onboard from L One to L Two, contract modifications, et cetera. So there is definitely a lot of overhead there and that doesn't even speak to what happens once it works. Right? And once we have L One and L Two, and once we have multiple L Two S and all of the interactions, et cetera, it is going to take up a lot of resources, I think. I suppose my view is that it's just by necessity a thing that's going to have to happen. Right.
00:11:02.000 - 00:12:21.850, Speaker B: When SBF and I had our debate a year ago now or nine months ago, one of the things we sort of talked about was this idea that, yes, maybe if everyone could converge on a single solution, we could avoid fragmentation and avoid dealing with all these multiple layers and all that stuff. It's just not going to happen, right? As much as we might want that to be the case, it's just not going to. So we need to be realistic and accept that there will be some level of fragmentation in this process and it is going to be overhead for engineers and developers in the space and people building in the space. But I think it's kind of a necessary process that we need to go through. And then to the second point around sort of decentralization and what the threshold of hardware is, I think there was an interesting kind of thing that you slipped in there, which was a $3,500 server in a data center somewhere. That's not exactly the kind of expectation I think we have around running an Ethereum node, right? Like $1,000 laptop or a $500 laptop. There are other requirements to run a salana node that are maybe over and above commodity hardware or commodity access to data availability or whatever that I think are pretty critical in order for that throughput to be achievable.
00:12:21.850 - 00:12:50.882, Speaker B: And I think running everything inside a data center or multiple data centers or whatever is not just a quantitative change. I think it's a qualitative change. Like if I can't run a node in my house because my bandwidth is not sufficient, my cable modem or whatever, that puts a severe constraint on who can actually participate in the network, which I think is an important thing to note well.
00:12:50.936 - 00:13:11.130, Speaker A: So let's now just talk about kind of the two main ETH killers of the latest vintage that everybody's been talking about. How would you guys characterize how Binance smart chain and solana have kind of filled the gaps that Ethereum is leaving with its high gas fees and with issues with scaling?
00:13:12.350 - 00:14:08.022, Speaker B: I think Binance smart chain has taken a very smart approach. Everything that Binance does is very smart. They're a very smart and efficient organization. It's just they may not be aligned with what the Ethereum community, for example. And in fact, I mean, they're not, right? Binance is a company that is trying to maximize profit, right? And they're very effective at it. So I think that the Binance smart chain traction that they're getting is not necessarily at the expense of Ethereum. I mean, I think it probably is pulling some liquidity away, but I think it's liquidity that right now is priced out realistically, right? There's obviously some additional incremental loss, but at the moment it's basically people that are priced out that are using finance marching, but you can very quickly spin up the same code bases and clone stuff or make minor modifications to get it running on BSc.
00:14:08.022 - 00:15:25.490, Speaker B: So it's just going to happen, right? It's just a realistic thing. And that's where I say I think that the fact that Ethereum has taken longer to scale than we would have liked has created this market opportunity for someone to do that. The fact that binance are the smart people that are doing know, it makes sense that it would be Binance, right? I think Solana is different in that it's much more of an existential threat to Ethereum because this question of wonky considerations for the average person around how decentralized is it, what hardware can you run it on, what are the requirements, et cetera. The average person doesn't care that much, right? I think the average person, if they looked at Ethereum and Solana versus BSc, they'd probably say like, yes, I understand that this is a fairly centralized network and it's run by a single entity effectively and they can make a distinction there. I think it's much harder for the average person to make a distinction between Ethereum and Solana. And so I think Solana is a much larger threat to Ethereum and is something that the Ethereum community needs to be mindful of, that you can lose market share. Like leaders fall behind all the time, especially in nascent phases of tech revolutions, right? It's very easy for someone to fall behind and we just need to keep ourselves accountable and make sure that we're aware of it.
00:15:25.490 - 00:15:36.214, Speaker B: We can't just hand wave it away and say, oh, Solana is not a threat to Ethereum because of X, Y or Z ideological view that we might have. I think it's really important and just.
00:15:36.252 - 00:15:58.590, Speaker A: To go back earlier when you were talking about how easy it is for developers to build on Binance merchant it's because it's Ethereum compatible. So it's literally like almost like a copy paste type thing. However, so it's fascinating that you say actually Solana is the bigger threat because Solana is not Ethereum virtual machine compatible. So why do you think that Solana is the bigger?
00:15:59.330 - 00:16:43.310, Speaker B: Again, you know, I think it's that distinction between most people can differentiate between Ethereum and Binance smart chain. I don't know if most people can differentiate between Ethereum and Solana. I think also there's another barrier which know, if anyone can just copy paste code from Ethereum to Binance smart chain, you get some interesting second order effects of things blowing up and rug pulls and all kinds of crazy stuff, right, which undermines that ecosystem. I think the barrier to entry of having to actually write your own code in Solana means by definition, you get better engineers, you get better teams, they're more credible teams, they're going to be able to take that code and develop it further. And it's just an ecosystem that's going to be much more competitive with realistically.
00:16:43.970 - 00:16:59.394, Speaker A: Oh, okay, so I see, so you're saying it's going to attract developers as opposed to like right now, binance smart chain might just attract more users who are priced out of Ethereum, but maybe not so much developers. And that's why Solana is the bigger threat. Is that it?
00:16:59.432 - 00:17:30.170, Speaker B: Yeah, I think so. I think there is a filter in Solana where you genuinely can't just take solidity and drop it in and run it right. You need to actually rewrite smart contracts from scratch and that means you need to have a better understanding, not a perfect understanding necessarily. And there's definitely some clone projects on Solana that have kind of taken code and just ported it across. But I think that in general it's not as easy, which means that you have a filter and you get better engineers and better teams.
00:17:31.390 - 00:17:44.160, Speaker A: Okay. And Kyle, obviously Kane and I covered a lot with that you can kind of respond to well no, I was asking some follow ups because I was curious. So go ahead and respond to whatever you'd like.
00:17:45.170 - 00:18:26.826, Speaker C: Yeah, so I agree with almost everything Kane just said. And as someone who obviously has spoken to a lot of Ethereum projects over the last twelve months and said, hey, do you want to port to salana? I've actually seen both ideological challenges and engineering challenges in getting them to do that. And let's call it last September, October, I thought I was being successful and I since realized I failed completely. Like I think my hit rate was actually zero. Again, there's partly ideological reasons and then as Kane alluded to, it's actually more important as engineering reasons. One thing I've observed across the Ethereum community is you have these engineering teams who are all kind of oriented around solidity and Solana is built on Rust. Rust is actually, in basically every way, actually a modern and better language.
00:18:26.826 - 00:19:15.758, Speaker C: It's just intellectual and kind of tool chain firepower behind it because it's just an enormous kind of global thing. But most Solidity devs don't know Rust and vice versa. I think it's been very logistically difficult for Ethereum based engineering organizations to figure out how to hire, grow, augment their teams and then kind of manage two side by side teams. I think it's just a logistically kind of difficult thing to do. So concur with everything Kane said there the key thing that kind of gets Cain's comments about kind of existential threat I think are accurate. And I think this kind of all gets down to the ideological beliefs around basically what degree of weak subjectivity is sufficient in these systems? I would argue everything in the world basically is like weakly subjective. And what I mean by that is the bitcoin maximalist view is you need to be able to verify every single transaction from Genesis in 2009 all the way to today.
00:19:15.758 - 00:19:50.182, Speaker C: And if you can't verify every single transaction yourself, then the system is bad and evil and that's like the purely objectivist view. But I think that's just an unnecessary bar to hold any of these systems too because your life is weakly subjective. And what do I mean by that? Well, first you read the history books and you don't actually know what happened 500 years ago. It's just been like some guy wrote it down and that guy passed it on to his kids and that guy passed it on to his kids and you don't actually know. So even basic concepts like history are by definition of subjectives. But even on a more practical basis, I'm in a building right now. The two of you are also in buildings right now.
00:19:50.182 - 00:20:34.838, Speaker C: There is a roof over your head. There were architects that designed a building and you're generally not worried the roof is going to collapse and kill you. And you get in a car and there's a bunch of pistons firing and it's literally you lighting stuff on fire and it's exploding and you generally don't care or think about it. My point is you don't have to verify all of these things yourself, right? So the world works on a weekly subjective basis where you don't need to verify everything. The question in my mind is what degree of subjectivity is okay for some sort of global permissionless financial system? And one view is I have to be able to run my own node. And the dollar cost and let's say bandwidth requirements have to be below some threshold. Let's say I don't know, it's $1,000 and I don't know, 100 megabits per second or whatever.
00:20:34.838 - 00:21:38.970, Speaker C: Pick your numbers. I think that's probably too restrictive. My intuition is that as long as you can get to some between 10,100 thousand around the world, it's enough that all of the other 7 billion people know that those other people are sufficiently honest and sufficiently well intentioned. And remember, that's going to be organizations like Coinbase and like FTX is there going to be a ton of well known reputable institutions and not just like guys and on guys in their basements. And so as long as you have a sufficient number of them who are distributed around the world, who all concur on the same consensus set, what are you getting as you go from, let's say, 20,000 nodes to 2 million nodes? That extra degree of censorship resistance and that extra degree of inclusion to me. Well, I mean, I would love it to have it. The forced engineering trade offs it makes, I find, to be in terms of gas cost in terms of latency, in terms of then all these other weird secondary effects on DevX and UX, I find that kind of to be the threshold for the trade.
00:21:38.970 - 00:21:57.874, Speaker C: Yeah, it's an open question, but I think as Kane's alluding to that's kind of the existential open question, I think most people in crypto have taken for granted that the answer to that question was in this pretty narrow range. And I think Solana's opened a lot of people's eyes to say, hey, maybe the range is a little bit wider of what is actually the right answer. And that's kind of what we're seeing happen right now.
00:21:57.992 - 00:22:42.014, Speaker A: So one thing that I want to explore a little more here is just how Binance Smart chain has actually gotten a lot more traction early on than Solana. It's just fascinating, both of you, I think, view Solana as something that could really be more of an Ethereum killer than and yet Solana really does not at the moment have the same kind of traction that even finance smart chain does or has had at different times over the last few months. There was a period where, for instance, among the different automated market makers, pancake swap actually did have higher volume than Uniswap. Obviously. Now with Uniswap. V. Three.
00:22:42.014 - 00:22:53.730, Speaker A: That's not the case. But can you just tell me, kind of like how you see this playing out in the short term, since it is at the moment binance smart chain that has posed kind of more of a threat to Ethereum?
00:22:54.790 - 00:23:37.226, Speaker B: I mean, my view, I guess, is that BSc is kind of an anomaly, right. It's a bit of a blip. There's a moment in time where Ethereum scaling has been slow enough and the amount of activity that's been generated on the chain is I think this is one of the things that I think the point of that thread was about was that we need to kind of not be so oblivious to these things. Right. I think there were a lot of people in the Theorem community that thought, l one probably can handle most of the activity that we want for the foreseeable future. And yeah, it's important that we scale, but it's not like an existential threat. We're not going to get caught out and we've been caught out.
00:23:37.226 - 00:24:43.222, Speaker B: There's way too much activity to the point where there's an overflow of activity that should be on Ethereum that has just drifted off into this other chain. Right. And that's just a missed opportunity, I think, for the Ethereum community completely. Does that get pulled back in when you have roll ups and things like polygon and zero knowledge scaling solutions that are much sort of better and at scale? Yes, I think all of that activity that's happening in Binance Smart chain, to a large extent, the vast majority of it will come back over once the gas prices are low enough on these other solutions. I think where Solana differs is that, again, it's going to be a harder road for them to scale and to get activity to come across, because it's not just as easy to kind of port something across. You can't just do the pancake swap thing, right. Someone needs to build the Pancake swap of Solana and it needs to be built from scratch in rust and that's just harder to do and it's just harder to kind of transfer that across.
00:24:43.222 - 00:26:00.720, Speaker B: So I think my sense is that Binance Smart chain will maybe lose some relevance once we get scaling, whereas Solana, I think once it gets momentum, it's going to be hard to unwind that because they're building a parallel ecosystem with different engineers, different skill sets, different, you know, approaches. And they have really taken to Kyle's point, they've accepted that there is maybe a wider range of sensitive persistence, if you will, right? If that's where it kind of ultimately comes down to that is acceptable and that you can have fewer nodes and it's probably fine, and the vast majority of people don't care as long as there's some people who care. People are going to sort of be happy to trust those people that do care as long as they know that there's sufficient number of them. And what is that number and what's sufficient? I didn't know that this was going to devolve into an epistemological debate, but I think it's a good point, right? There's not some answer that the Ethereum community and Bitcoin community have gotten right, necessarily right. We don't know what the market will bear. The market might be willing to bear much more because they're not as ideologically concerned as we are. The market might be very happy to have a much wider range of answers to that question.
00:26:01.730 - 00:26:03.620, Speaker A: Kyle, did you want to add anything?
00:26:04.310 - 00:27:13.958, Speaker C: Yeah, I think the other thing I would add that I think is important to think about is stability and ability to project how things are going to work in the future. Like gas fees is like one obvious problem, and that's kind of the most salient one you see at the moment. But I would actually argue that that's not the biggest problem. The biggest problem is if you're going to be Twitter or you're going to be any bank or Snap or Reddit or whoever, doesn't matter, pick your big company of choice and you want to say, okay, we're going to go embed crypto in a fundamental way into our application, right? Whether it's with some social tokens or you've embed bit cloud or some trading, whatever, I don't really care. Just something. And you have 100 million daily active users on your act, right? If you have 100 million today and you reasonably expect you're going to grow over the next three years, you'll have 200 million users in three years or whatever, you need to have a very strong understanding of how the system works at the current moment. And actually, more importantly, you need to understand you expect the underlying system to continue to evolve over the next two or three or four years at a minimum, before you make any sort of large technical commitment like that.
00:27:13.958 - 00:28:05.222, Speaker C: And the biggest challenge the Ethereum ecosystem faces actually today is that it is actually impossible to answer the question, what does a scaled Ethereum application look like in 24 months? It's not that I don't know or that Kane doesn't know. It's that it's actually not possible to know because you have too many things that are interfering with each other right now from these various optimistic oral flavors, zero knowledge players and state channels, there's. Just too many things that are all about to run into each other and no one knows how it's going to all play out. And so you just can't make any projections. You can be optimistic and say, I think it will get figured out and that's a reasonable thing to believe. Some people believe it with higher probabilities than others, but you can't know with any degree of certainty how does an application actually function on ethereum at some level of scale in 24 months. It just is not possible to know and I'm not sure when it will be possible.
00:28:05.222 - 00:29:06.700, Speaker C: 24, maybe twelve, I think is pretty optimistic. 24 seems reasonable, but it could be 36 months before that answer is really knowable. And being able to provide stability over a long horizon for large companies to commit to is extraordinarily important because when you have a large user base, the number one thing you can't do is just screw up your entire application. I say the reason I'm actually most optimistic Solana is it provides that stability in terms of just how does it scale and then also in terms of just like the core development environment, which is like it's based on the Rust community. And it seems like Rust is going to slowly replace C as like powering the guts of like everything in the world. I mean the Linux like Linus Turtle has recently said, like they're going to start rewriting parts of the Linux kernel in so kind of that degree of technical depth and kind of integration into just all software around the world. There's real deep important considerations here that Solana kind of naturally benefits from.
00:29:07.550 - 00:29:49.480, Speaker A: All right, so we're going to talk a little bit about some very specific events over the next few years to see how this might play out. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible. Today's episode is sponsored by EY Blockchain. Ernst and Young is committed to supporting integration of the world's business ecosystems on the public ethereum blockchain.

So actually, one note before I ask my next question. Kyle, what you were saying about Rest is interesting because as you know, I've been working on this book and what you were saying about it replacing C reminds me of how Gavin Wood, when he left the Ethereum Foundation and started Parity, they chose to make their next client in Rust and his previous client had been in.
00:31:50.686 - 00:32:30.460, Speaker A: So yes, I've heard a little bit about the benefits of that language and, you know, see that there are developers who are going in that direction. So let's just now talk about all these different layer twos, because you're right. Right now Ethereum is in this somewhat messy period with a lot of fragmented layer two scaling and different projects on different layer twos. So for both of you, how do you see Ethereum best navigating this period while we have these other competitors that are able to already handle more transactions per second?
00:32:31.330 - 00:33:24.426, Speaker B: I mean, maybe I'm being overly optimistic here. I think the period of highest friction is probably the next six months in terms of getting some level of consensus about where we should be trying to scale Ethereum based applications. I think one other consideration, though, to go back to what Kyle had said before for a large organization is not just throughput. That's not the only consideration. I think there is an important consideration, which is this idea of credible neutrality. And yes, Ethereum might be fairly opaque in terms of what the roadmap looks like and what something will look like in 24 months or three years. But I think that at the moment, even if you ignore maybe the fact that Salana is more centralized from a node perspective, it's far more centralized from an organizational perspective.
00:33:24.426 - 00:34:47.830, Speaker B: There is a group of people sitting in a couple of places around the world that are kind of driving the majority of development and I think Ethereum is in a very different place. And so if you're looking as a large organization that's trying to work know, which platform do I believe is going to be the best place for me to put resources into? I think we're already seeing that large scale, particularly for financial applications, maybe less so for social things and Twitter and Reddit and things like that. But certainly from financial applications, ethereum is the place that you go as long as you're not so concerned about throughput. If you're trying to put 100 million users on something that's probably not going to be viable. But when you're issuing a bond or something like that, I think we're seeing that Ethereum we don't have central banks issuing bonds on BSc, right, for various obvious. So I think that ultimately what it comes down to is, can we get to a level of scalability where we start to see some traction? I don't think we're going to see Twitter fully decentralize itself in the near term anyway. But if we see some social applications that are running on roll ups or zero knowledge scaling solutions that are getting some level of traction that will provide confidence, I suppose, in larger organizations to start to look into this, but it is going to be an incremental process.
00:34:47.830 - 00:34:55.366, Speaker B: I don't think we just see a wholesale migration to any decentralized platform, whether it's Solana or Ethereum or BSc.
00:34:55.558 - 00:34:57.578, Speaker A: Kyle, what do you I agree with.
00:34:57.584 - 00:36:13.890, Speaker C: Kind of everything Kane said there, I think, how does Ethereum kind of deal with this? And I'm not sure what the answer to that is, because the problem with Ethereum is that it's not a thing or a group of people, it's a whole bunch of different people live in a whole bunch of different places, who disagree with each other on a whole bunch of different things. So I'm not sure what you can do about it. And the reality is that in the long run, the experimentation going on now is necessary because you need to find the right set of trade offs and it's not clear what the right set of trade offs are. And experimentation is the only way to figure that out. The best thing they can do is move as quickly as possible and try and play nice together as best as possible. I think the other thing that I really think about here is that what happens when you have an application that's like well known, like consumer grade application that's well known that there's like 30 million or 50 million daily users, so not like 500 million daily users, but like 30 or 50 kind of scale. And what's the highest probability platform that if you assume that application has to exist at some point, which actually I assume 100% probability that such application will exist, if I didn't, then I wouldn't have the job that I have then.
00:36:13.890 - 00:37:16.018, Speaker C: What's actually the highest probability location of where that application ends up living? On the surface, the answer is obviously Ethereum, but actually, if you peel him back and think about it a little bit more, I would actually argue the only answer is Solana, because as Kane said, the scaling is going to be incremental, which I agree with that. So you've got all these people around the world looking crypto prices and experimenting with stuff and playing with things and they're all trying to figure out how to make stuff work. And if you just assume your default is I have to have support for 50 million users, then you kind of limit your choices really fast. If one of those things starts to work in reasonably near future and gets to a reasonable degree of user scale that's widely recognized and understood, I think the relative perceptions will change really fast. The biggest surprise to actually multicoin in the last nine months has been the price of ETH BTC. We were convinced BTC was going to outperform ETH this cycle because we thought these big institutions coming in were going to be buying BTC and not buying ETH. We thought they were going to be concerned about ETH two and proof of stake.
00:37:16.018 - 00:38:03.218, Speaker C: It's confusing and the monetary policy is undefined. And we really thought that that kind of degree of confusion was going to cause each BTC to go down. We were obviously dead wrong. EBTC has way outperformed our expectations and so that's forced us to reconsider. What are the marginal buyers caring about? And they seem to be undervaluing the digital gold thesis and overvaluing the productive utility asset thesis of things that are productive for large numbers of users that do useful things. And so if you kind of just lean into that even further and say, okay, well, as this stuff evolves, where are those dollars going to migrate over time? It just seems pretty logical to me that those dollars are going to migrate to where they see the 50 to 100 million daily active users. And I think the probability that that application ends up on Ethereum first is actually much lower than the market kind of assigns.
00:38:03.218 - 00:38:11.222, Speaker C: Just looking at how our views have changed over the last nine months on ETHBTC, I think the market's views can change on sold. Anything else?
00:38:11.276 - 00:38:56.680, Speaker A: As you know, I just kind of need to pull together a bunch of different strands here because I feel like some of the comments have gone one way and at other points, a different you know, for instance, earlier kyle, when you were saying that you actually had not convinced any developers to move over to know despite all we're saying about the superiority of Rust and know how it's just solana offers a better experience for developers and blah, blah, blah. Why do you think that you didn't convince any developers to go over there and then yet it's just funny that you mentioned that at the same time that you're saying, oh, the next really big application for that size 30 to 50 million users I think will be on Salana. So I'm just kind of curious to hear how you put all that together.
00:38:57.930 - 00:39:16.990, Speaker C: Oh, sure, to synthesize that into like five words, the answer is on a global developer basis, solidity rounds to zero. Like it really does the number of solidity developers in the world rounds to zero among all developers and so that's why it doesn't matter. And that's why the Solana team has stopped trying to convince ETH developers to port over. It just doesn't matter.
00:39:17.060 - 00:39:21.086, Speaker A: Oh, I see. So since there are just to be.
00:39:21.108 - 00:39:31.554, Speaker C: Fair and to be clear, I'm not saying that those ETH developers don't matter as people or what the project they're working on, I'm just saying in the aggregate universe of total developers, the number of solidity developers just doesn't matter.
00:39:31.672 - 00:39:45.830, Speaker A: Okay, so then essentially for Solana to take off, it needs to just pull in new developers who aren't currently in crypto or into blockchain anything, is that?
00:39:45.900 - 00:40:01.210, Speaker C: Yeah, or they're disenfranchised with ETH or they come from the rest community. There's all kinds of weird way or they work at Binance or FTX or Coinbase or BlockFi, whatever. They work at any of these places and they say, actually, best example here is probably Jump.
00:40:01.950 - 00:40:02.954, Speaker A: Jump capital, right?
00:40:02.992 - 00:40:32.918, Speaker C: Like Jump is the largest market maker trading. Yeah, Jump Trading, they're the largest market maker in all of Crypto. They have the venture Arm, which is Capital. And then Trading is like the main single largest market maker in all of Crypto and they're one of the largest trading firms in the world. They have 900 full time employees and they're deep in crypto and they're trading on D Five. They're trading on every single centralized exchange around the world and they're saying like, okay, we think we can build a big part of the future using their new Oracle network called Pit that they announced. And Jump obviously trades on all these assets on all these venues around the world.
00:40:32.918 - 00:40:44.220, Speaker C: Obviously they're going to pipe in a bunch of the data that they're trading from these other places into. So you just look at people like that and it just makes you wonder, where does that thread go?
00:40:46.030 - 00:41:41.322, Speaker B: Maybe a counterpoint. And look, I love the Jump guys and I talk to them regularly. I think they're an amazing company and they do a really good job and they're amazing market makers. But I think what's interesting is they still have a very TradFi DNA, right? They don't quite get everything DeFi. There is an aspect of understanding it from an ideological perspective. So when we were talking about this Oracle network that they were going to launch, one of my concerns with this is that they are looking at it from a very different perspective and maybe that's fine, right. And the trade offs and optimizations they're trying to make are coming from a very different angle of like a TradFi centralized angle and not quite rocking maybe what the trade offs are that need to exist for smart contract developers to want to adopt something.
00:41:41.322 - 00:42:29.558, Speaker B: So I think Jump is actually a really great example of how someone can maybe get it wrong and go, okay, we're over optimizing for throughput here. These guys are into HFT. Throughput to them is like they're addicted to it, right. They can't get themselves out of that mindset. And so I think that the fact that the siren song of Solana attracted Jump is kind of indicative of one of the dangers of maybe not having that deep understanding of what the trade offs are in decentralized finance that the solidity engineers who've been working there for the last four years have deeply ingrained. We understand how these things work and we understand why they work that way. We did all the dumb things two years ago, three years ago, four years ago, and we've learned our lessons.
00:42:29.558 - 00:43:03.000, Speaker B: Someone who's coming from a very centralized TradFi perspective is maybe not going to have that understanding and may optimize for the wrong things. And I think in the case of Jump and this Oracle network on Solana, I think they kind of have. I think they would have been better off building something and integrating with existing systems in the ethereum network like chainlink, for example. They're going to hate me for saying this, but I honestly think that they would have added more value there had they done that. But that's my opinion and I've told them that myself. But I think it's a really good example.
00:43:03.530 - 00:43:05.190, Speaker A: Kyle, what do you have to say?
00:43:05.340 - 00:43:54.082, Speaker C: There's open questions that sometimes we iterate on these internally and sometimes it kind of pours out on Twitter of what exactly makes DeFi different than like, what are actually the properties that matter that are different. That's kind of the crux of what Kane's getting at. And there's a few obvious ones and there's a few that are maybe more like the most important ones are obviously non custodial, like probably the single most important one. The fact that you can have contracts hold assets instead of people or organizations, that kind of paramount to this whole thing. The fact that it's transparent is probably super important. And up there, the fact that you can kind of trivially rehypothe collateral between systems is really important. Beyond that, it's not clear to me that there's any actual differences between DeFi and CFI.
00:43:54.082 - 00:44:18.410, Speaker C: On a strictly financial basis, there's obviously engineering differences, especially as it pertains to distributed networks versus central databases, but on like a strictly financial basis, I think those are the only properties that matter that differ. And so if that's the case, then it's not clear to me why Jump is doing is wrong. But there's maybe an argument that I'm myopic and missing some things and there's some other stuff that needs to be considered.
00:44:18.490 - 00:45:36.722, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't think that you're strictly missing something, but I think it's kind of a question of like, what are you optimizing for? Right? And I think someone coming from CFI or coming from TradFi just has a mindset of what they're optimizing for. They're optimizing for throughput they're not necessarily factoring in the social consensus aspects of these things. Right. And maybe that doesn't matter, but it seems to matter. In DeFi, there is a component of that that is important to factor in. Why do people trust something? Is it genuinely credibly neutral? Are we concerned that it's controlled by a single entity? All of these considerations, I think, come into what's going on here, right? And I say this as someone who launched a project that was extremely centralized in the early phases, and the Ethereum community was very vocal about how terrible that was and what a bad person I was for doing that. But we obviously had a plan to decentralize over time, right? When you have something that's coming from a very sort of centralized place without maybe a plan to kind of decentralize over time, there's going to be some questions about is this a place that I want to commit resources to? Because you end up with a situation of platform risk.
00:45:36.722 - 00:45:41.450, Speaker B: And I think Ethereum has platform risk, but it's a different type of platform risk than say, like Facebook.
00:45:42.190 - 00:46:05.120, Speaker A: Yeah, I actually also now just want to ask a little bit about DeFi composability because that was something that obviously at a certain point was a concern. But now that we have all this fragmentation anyway on these different layer twos, I just wonder, does that make it less of a factor than it used to be and make room for these competitors to gain market share?
00:46:06.630 - 00:46:47.840, Speaker B: Solana, certainly the fact that it's not taking the same sort of approach to scaling and having all these multiple layer twos, I think will have an advantage in composability just by definition, right? If we've got four different credible choices that a DeFi team on Ethereum can choose between like or whatever, it just makes it hard, right? We could have a situation where four of the top DeFi projects all end up on different networks. So that's just something that I think we need to be aware of. Whereas Solana, you deploy in Solana you're there, that's it. You're all in the same place.
00:46:48.210 - 00:47:53.762, Speaker C: In my conversations with traditional finance people, and I imagine in a lot of Keynes he's had in the last few years as well, one of the coolest things is they see the composability and they're like, oh, the light bulb clicks very quickly. I think it's a pretty important thing to them is that they tend to understand relatively quickly that this is one of those step function improvements that the new system enabled, that the old system could not do. And it's certainly, I'd say intellectually, the coolest of them and certainly the most kind of developer centric also of them, of kind of those native new DeFi properties. And Solana clearly preserves those the. So I think there's going to be a real group of people who are drawn to that. I think for the most part the world does not fully appreciate the degree to which these things are true at the moment. But as Ethereum kind of continues to become more heterogeneous across layer ones, side chains and layer twos and as Salana just maintains everything organically working in like a single composable shard that will become a lot more obvious to the world in six to twelve months time than it is today.
00:47:53.762 - 00:48:13.080, Speaker C: Where today it's kind of mostly just people. I got theorizing that'll be very obvious and I suspect a fair number of people will be drawn to that because they will perceive it as the right thing to optimize for and it is a reasonable thing to want to optimize for.
00:48:13.550 - 00:48:53.990, Speaker A: Do you think then we could see kind of like DeFi moving to so my next question for you was know, obviously we've seen these NFTs taking off in the last several months and both Solana and Binance smart chain are creating their own NFT platforms. And so then I started, oh, like, are we just going to see different parts of the crypto ecosystem on each of these different like, maybe DeFi moves to Solana or it grows its own kind of organic DeFi community that is more composable than DeFi and Ethereum is right now or something? Like, how do you think that kind of these more niche interests in crypto will affect this competition?
00:48:54.650 - 00:49:01.354, Speaker C: I don't think Ethereum where it is today will be displaced in any meaningful way in any foreseeable time horizon, but.
00:49:01.392 - 00:49:03.660, Speaker A: Even for any particular use case.
00:49:04.350 - 00:50:03.818, Speaker C: Well, I mean, the use case is just whales. That's just already true. The retail dollars have peeled off to Polygon and BSc. I think the bigger question is where do you onboard net new users into the system? And specifically, you can argue that even the major crypto companies, Binance, Coinbase, FTX, whatever, they all have some degree of ideology built in the DNA of the companies based on the founders and the VPs of product and whatever. Everyone here owns a bunch of crypto outside their job and they all have ideological beliefs about X and Y and Z. But the people who work at, I don't know, let's just say Revolute for example, or whatever, or New Bank in Brazil, those people for the most part when they look at crypto, their ideological beliefs are like ten X, if not 100 X lower than the people who work at Coinbase and Finance and FCX. And so they really don't care about all the stuff that we spend our time thinking about.
00:50:03.818 - 00:50:31.880, Speaker C: And so they're just going to be looking at like, okay, well, where can I bring the users to get okay, I want, like, a DeFi money market and I want some loans and I want over collateralization, and I want these risk parameters, and I want some USDC and USDT and, okay, where do I get and like, oh, great. Solana. Okay, they're just going to not care. I think extremely rational for actually, I think the substantial majority of the world's companies as they look at crypto to kind of adopt that view.
00:50:32.970 - 00:50:34.866, Speaker A: Kane, do you have an opinion?
00:50:35.058 - 00:51:24.818, Speaker B: I've said this before on Twitter, I think the demand probably in some Solana thread where people were annoyed by something I said. But the demand for decentralization doesn't come from users, right? Like, users don't care, they just want to consume something that has some benefit to them. Right. I think the demand comes from the engineers who have a belief that not just that they're ideologically aligned with the network, but that there is some practical benefit to being decentralized. Right, and that being more decentralized has more benefits. Right, but there has to be some practical benefit. If there isn't, my thesis on Ethereum is that being on Ethereum will, over the long term, be better, that there will be practical advantages to being on Ethereum because of the way that it's constructed.
00:51:24.818 - 00:52:18.106, Speaker B: And if that's not true, then yes, of course people are just going to go to BSc or Solana or whatever. So when Revolut or a bank or some fintech looks at which of the platforms we can deploy on, my genuine hope is that the practical benefits that I believe that Ethereum has will be obvious there. Why are you going on here versus going on BSc? I think for Ethereum versus BSc, we can kind of laugh about it, because it's pretty obvious what the benefits are. I could just run my own database if I'm Revolute. I already have that. Right? So it's kind of obvious that you don't go to BSc, but I think it's less obvious for Salana. And I think that's the concern, I guess, that I have to bring it back to the initial the kind of starting point that if the practical benefits of being more decentralized are not ten x better or at least five x better or something, then.
00:52:18.106 - 00:52:27.580, Speaker B: Yeah, we could just see people going to a network that maybe makes that trade off a little less harshly than ethereum does.
00:52:28.510 - 00:52:35.562, Speaker A: So, a couple of things. First, I really was expecting you guys to disagree more, so it does surprise me how much you are agreeing.
00:52:35.626 - 00:52:42.240, Speaker B: We're both it can't be too bad, right? We can't hate each other too much.
00:52:43.410 - 00:52:52.546, Speaker A: Okay, well, Kane, out of curiosity, I mean, it just sounds like you would never build on Solana, even as you talk about what the benefits would be to building there.
00:52:52.568 - 00:53:32.442, Speaker B: So why is like, ultimately, what it comes down to is I don't just have an ideological alignment to Ethereum. I've got a financial alignment. I've got a big bag of ETH, and I'm here to make ETH as successful as can. Right. So and this is, I think, the interesting thing about when you talk about someone at Coinbase versus someone at Revolut, right. Someone at Revolut probably doesn't have a bunch of equity in Microsoft and isn't in Revolut advocating for adopting? Not it's a weird thing in Crypto, where you have this weird financial alignment of all these different players in the ecosystem. I don't know if it's good or bad, it's just a thing that exists.
00:53:32.442 - 00:54:33.410, Speaker B: Right? And so for me, I advocate for ethereum because I'm both ideologically and financially aligned with it, which also comes back to an earlier point around. I think that's why I'm pushing so hard for us to converge on optimism as the scaling solution. Because I think if we have a canonical L two solution that is like the consensus solution, it will be much easier for us to compete with Salana over the next six to twelve months. Right. If we don't, and it is super fragmented and there's no understanding of where I should go, what I should do, or which place I should be deploying to, I think it'll erode the value prop of ethereum much more. So that's why I'm so aggressive about advocating for, like, we all need to get on optimism, and even if it's not the perfect solution, it's the best solution that we have, and it's better that we all converge on something which is not too dissimilar to SBF's argument of why we should all go to Solana. Interestingly, right? So I think we're kind of in the same camp there, I guess, just with different conclusions.
00:54:35.130 - 00:55:28.498, Speaker A: One thing I will say is I think however much you advocate that everybody get an optimism, like, that boat has already sailed already, there's a fragmentation. So let's talk about EIP. 1559 most likely will make east deflationary, and that could actually obviously give some adrenaline to the price. So do you think that would then change this dynamic that we're seeing where these other chains are taking market share? Because Kane, as you pointed out, you're financially aligned to ethereum, but obviously BNB and Sol have really shot up this year. They had lower prices, and so it's easier to get that big jump. So once we see EIP one five nine go through, do you think that then that could change that dynamic?
00:55:28.594 - 00:56:29.634, Speaker B: I think it makes it worse, actually. Right. I think the price appreciation yeah, the price appreciation of E and the starting point that most people got in really makes it hard for that wealth effect to kind of spread, right? Like if you think about the average person who comes into crypto and they want to maybe deploy ten grand of capital, right, which would be pretty high, but let's say they get four E right? Now, unit bias is a dumb thing, right? Like, if you believe that ethereum is going to appreciate, on a percentage basis more so than Solana or BSE, and you're just purely looking for capital appreciation, then you should buy those four E. But there is an element of people want some level of meaningful ownership, right? And if I turn up and I can get much more meaningful ownership of something like Solana or BSc, it's not just unit bias. There's other factors there where people feel like they just don't have a decent stake of the network. Right? And so I think that that wealth effect. That has really kind of accelerated for BSE.
00:56:29.634 - 00:57:29.194, Speaker B: And Solana is quite powerful in terms of locking people in. How distributed is it and how widely does that go? I don't know the answer to that, but I do think if ETH continues to appreciate and you get to a point where ETH is ten grand or 20 grand or something like that, it actually makes it harder for someone new to the space to come in. How good do you feel about owning half an E with your ten grand or something like that? How aligned do you feel to the network? If you've got 200,000,000th of the network or something like that, maybe just doesn't it doesn't psychologically feel that good. So I think that's something that I worry about is price appreciation could have a negative effect. The flip side is things like Polygon and Arbitram will obviously launch a token. I'd say optimism will pretty obviously launch a token. So when these new layer two tokens launch, I think that that will provide an opportunity for people to feel like they're getting in early at a lower price point, lower network value, and that they can get alignment with.
00:57:29.194 - 00:57:39.230, Speaker B: Even if they missed the ETH train or boat or whatever analogy you want to use, that they'll be able to get some alignment with these layer two tokens. And I think we're seeing that with Polygon.
00:57:39.730 - 00:57:41.278, Speaker A: Kyle, what do you think?
00:57:41.444 - 00:58:25.342, Speaker C: I think the 1559 narrative is extraordinarily bullish. ETH over the next minimum six months, probably twelve, there's never really been an asset in the world that has a credible claim on negative issuance. A lot of people will find that very appealing and very intellectually interesting. And then combine, it's got these cool D five things happening and then move to proof of stake. That kind of six to twelve month horizon for ETH looks very good, which is why we're long ETH. The problem as Kane alluded to is as the price of ETH USD goes up, ethereum becomes more expensive to like even Arbitrum. And optimism, I don't think will be cheap to use.
00:58:25.342 - 00:58:56.550, Speaker C: They will obviously be cheaper, a lot cheaper than the ETH main net is now. But assuming there's no subsidies, I think you'll still be two, three, four, or $5 transactions. Transactions are not going to be one penny or two pennies. Look again, $2 transactions are manageable for most people, but for the people who are putting in $100, that's still not reasonable. People who are putting in $1,000, they can live with it, but for actually the long tail of retail, it just doesn't work. It just still doesn't work. It's just like a big logistical challenge.
00:58:56.550 - 00:59:05.194, Speaker C: And 1559 will short term feel very good, but like medium term could be problematic as Kane alluded to.
00:59:05.392 - 00:59:31.300, Speaker A: So Cain, when you wrote your original Tweet Storm, you might have seen Ryan Zurr, formerly of Polychain Capital and the Web Three Foundation Tweeted back at you recommending that you reconsider the quote us versus them mentality of maximalism and consider making synthetics cross chain. And then he was like, single chain apps are going to get dusted. It is programmed. So would you ever consider making synthetics cross chain and why or why not?
00:59:31.830 - 00:59:41.958, Speaker B: So I think I have like three draft responses to that and I kept not publishing them. Maybe one of them was like a bit too aggressive and I was like, I'm just not going to go there.
00:59:42.044 - 00:59:44.338, Speaker C: I really like didn't.
00:59:44.354 - 01:00:30.134, Speaker B: I was like, I got enough people that I have debates with on Twitter. I don't need to make another Twitter enemy. But his point broadly is true, right? I think that the Ethereum community spends a lot of time talking about BTC Maxis and how ridiculous a position it is, right. We need to be very careful to not fall prey to the same kind of thinking, right, where we just assume that our position is true by default and never challenge it. And I mean, that was part of what that thread was about, that we should be challenging our assumptions and saying like, is there something we're missing here? The market is sending us a signal. We can't just bury our head in the sand and say, no, the market's wrong, we're right. That's just not the right way to approach this problem.
01:00:30.134 - 01:01:29.606, Speaker B: If the market's making bad decisions for the wrong reasons, on some level we've still failed because we haven't given the market the information to make the right decisions for the right reasons. It's a communications issue. But regardless of what the reason is, the market is doing something that we don't think is a good idea. So we're wrong, right? Like just by definition, right? And we need to work out how to fix that problem. So I think Ryan is right to come back to would we look at cross chain? I mean, we looked at running on EOS in 2018, right? We were genuinely considering that we ended up deciding not to do that and doubling down on Ethereum and I think that was the right call. But synthetics has very specific challenges around running cross chain. The interesting thing is going from L one to L two and running across both chains will make that problem a lot less hard in the future and we will be able to support other chains much more easily because all the infrastructure will be there.
01:01:29.606 - 01:02:08.430, Speaker B: I would imagine most likely it would be other roll ups. Whether they be ZK or other optimistic roll ups would be the more likely adjacent place that we would deploy for the reason know, Kyle sort of mentioned as like, we don't have the infrastructure to spin up a Rust team to go, know, rebuild all of our contracts and deploy on Solana and that would be very challenging. We could do it, you can do anything, but it would be a lot of resources to throw at something like that. So I think it's going to be much more likely that EVM compatible chains will be where we go in the short term. But we're not ruling anything out. We try not to be. And I should also say when I say we, there's a community that decides this stuff.
01:02:08.430 - 01:02:22.730, Speaker B: I don't decide it. I'm just someone who says things on like at this know, like personally, even if I said we'll never do it, I can't guarantee that doesn't know the community could say, actually this guy's an idiot, let's go on Solana tomorrow.
01:02:23.070 - 01:02:28.502, Speaker A: Yeah, I think your Twitter bio right now says former benevolent dictator synthetics.
01:02:28.566 - 01:02:30.910, Speaker B: Is that what it's true? Yeah, it's.
01:02:33.490 - 01:03:19.930, Speaker A: So in the same vein of my previous question, I was just wondering so obviously we have this Thor chain that now makes it easy to swap between different chains. And so if we're starting to see things like that then does that make this question that we've been discussing in this episode moot? Meaning will we eventually just see users seamlessly going to different chains rather than staying in specific ecosystems? And if so, then will that just kind of make this multi chain world that kind of grows the pie for everyone and it's like Ethereum will get bigger, Solana will get bigger, BSE will get bigger, et cetera. And it's not going to be kind of this little tribal view of crypto.
01:03:21.170 - 01:04:22.318, Speaker C: Yeah, I have some non consensus views on this question. So one of the common things you see is people talk about back in the day, in the early internet software days, like making standards work together and there was competing standards and those people got together and then tried to make interoperation standards. And there's a whole ton of history of this happening at many different layers of the stack, from networking pieces of the stack through kernel pieces all the way through the browser and HTML and all this stuff. Kind of a recurring theme in the history of software. And the biggest takeaway from kind of seeing that history play out many times across many layers of the stack is that the answer is always interoperability and that it's not one size fits all and that things kind of evolved to deal with backwards compatibility basically. Like different things evolve at different speeds and then everyone has to realize that they have to play nice and they all have to talk to each other later on. And a lot of people have used that historical framework to say they were very for with very high probability the future must be multi chain for that kind of same basic reason.
01:04:22.318 - 01:05:07.866, Speaker C: I think that's wrong ish it is obviously right ish today. And that I mean, if you look at our portfolio we have big thorn chain position, big salon position, big ETH position. Obviously money says that we believe that's happening and I think with basically 100% probability that will continue to accelerate. The world will become more heterogeneous both within Ethereum and outside of Ethereum over the next minimum twelve months and probably 24 to 36. But there are real costs to having multiple chains. And those costs are not just like developer devdex costs or like some standards organizations cost. It's actually user costs in terms of forms of gas and the form of latency.
01:05:07.866 - 01:05:51.354, Speaker C: The moment you do anything cross chain, you guarantee are increasing gas cost and you were guaranteed increasing latency cost. And those two dynamics did not exist for all kind of previous iterations of these types of like what I'll call standard interoperability kind of standards battles, at least not in such an explicit way, where the cost is not measured in billions of a penny, but where the cost is measured in like dollars. That's a really, really big difference. And so being able to stay synchronous, being able to stay composable, I think is a lot more important than the kind of historical perspective would lend you to believe. So that was my long rant. I'll end it there.
01:05:51.472 - 01:05:53.100, Speaker A: Kane, do you have an.
01:05:55.310 - 01:06:42.494, Speaker B: Broadly I agree. Right? Yeah. I think there's a reason why we're not talking about Cosmos, for example. Right. And there's a reason why we're not maybe it's a bit unfair to polkadot, right, I think, but still, this kind of architectural decision of creating all of these little zones and having them all talk to each other, I just don't know how sort of credible that is as a long term solution. Right. That's why, again, I think Solana going down this path of making trade offs that ensure composability for the longer term versus things like Sharding and various optimistic roll ups in different flavors competing with one another.
01:06:42.494 - 01:07:03.778, Speaker B: I think it has the best chance of unseeding Ethereum. Right. It's the thing that concerns me the most. Right. Because it's a good pathway. And when you get to start from scratch three years after someone else has done a whole bunch of dumb things, right? You can learn lessons from that and you can make optimizations and improvements. Right.
01:07:03.778 - 01:07:35.354, Speaker B: It's just a reality. Right. We're still very early. We don't have enough traction and momentum as an entire ecosystem to say that any one particular thing is going to work and continue to exist. Right. So that doesn't mean that I don't think Ethereum can fix some of the issues, and I think some of the trade offs that it makes are the right trade offs, even though they're challenging. But I do think that ultimately we will probably converge on a network that people will use because of that composable factor.
01:07:35.354 - 01:08:23.840, Speaker B: Right. I don't think we're going to have these weird zones, and I think there'll be a way to kind of aggregate them all seamlessly, potentially, like we've seen in the AMM space in DeFi, where you get these aggregator layers sitting on top, but they have to be in the same place for that aggregation to work. Right. It's really hard to aggregate across these different zones because of the cost and latency that it introduces and the lack of composability. So I just think that we will end up in a situation where most things, the vast majority of liquidity, it won't be winner take all, but it'll be winner take most. And most of the liquidity will end up in a single place, and that will be the place where people go. My hope is that that's an optimistic roll up on ethereum, but I can see a world where that's not the case as well.
01:08:24.290 - 01:08:51.942, Speaker A: Interesting. Yeah. Speaking of the aggregators, I did know one inch is on Binance Merchant, but I don't believe it's on Solana. So that's kind of interesting given everything that we've said so far. Well, we're well over time, but there were just kind of a number of different topics I wanted to hit, so I just wanted to make sure to ask questions about those items. Where can people learn more about each of you and your work?
01:08:52.076 - 01:09:02.570, Speaker C: Yeah, so it's easy to find me on Twitter. My Twitter handle is just my name, so it's at Kyle Simani and then Multicoin as a blog. We publish stuff every now and again. Our website is multicoin capital.
01:09:04.590 - 01:09:17.870, Speaker B: For me, Twitter mainly. My handle is Kaiynne, and I publish stuff on the synthetics blog as well, predominantly. So that's blog synthetics IO.
01:09:19.410 - 01:09:22.990, Speaker A: All right, great. Well, thank you both so much for coming on Unchained.
01:09:23.330 - 01:09:24.478, Speaker B: Yeah, that was really fun.
01:09:24.564 - 01:09:28.260, Speaker C: Hey, Laura. This was fun. I'm glad we got to explore all these really subtle issues.
01:09:28.870 - 01:09:36.162, Speaker A: All right, well, we'll see how this all plays out, and maybe I will have you guys back and we can do the throw down at that point.
01:09:36.216 - 01:09:36.578, Speaker B: Okay.
01:09:36.664 - 01:10:04.010, Speaker A: All right, everyone, thank you so much for joining us today.
