00:00:00.410 - 00:00:35.782, Speaker A: One thing we haven't talked about, which I actually think is worth mentioning, is that one of the other advantages of ETFs is that you could have derivative instruments tied to them. So an ETF could have a whole slew of options that trade on top of the ETF. And so what this will unlock is just new ways for people to have complex positions built on top of bitcoin that they might not already have access to. And so I do think some people are going to say, well, what is the extreme edge case put worth on a bitcoin ETF that might represent the custody risk inherent in it and be able to price this out in really interesting ways?
00:00:35.916 - 00:00:43.026, Speaker B: It's very true. Right now, if you want bitcoin options, you kind of have to go to derbit and Derbit. Obviously, in crypto land, we're fine with Derbit.
00:00:43.058 - 00:00:43.766, Speaker A: But if.
00:00:43.788 - 00:00:59.370, Speaker B: You want to get institutional capital buying and selling bitcoin options, it's not going to happen on Derbit, most likely. I'm just not that convinced that the lit market derivatives are going to be better than the non KYC market derivatives or like approximately non KYC.
