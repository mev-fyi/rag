00:00:00.440 - 00:00:35.662, Speaker A: I wake up every day and there's a person mad at me every morning for something that we have done right. There's somewhat like, here's the message I get every day. Why didn't you cover us? Like, companies I've invested in or sponsors or advertisers or big clients of our research platform. Why didn't you cover us? We just raised this money. Why didn't you cover us? And it's funny, I'll see people kind of shit on the media a lot because it's a common thing to do, right? It's like that, the damn media. But then in the DM's and the emails, it's like, yeah, but please, please, can you write a story about us?
00:00:35.726 - 00:00:36.598, Speaker B: Not a dividend.
00:00:36.694 - 00:00:37.782, Speaker C: It's a tale of Tuquan.
00:00:37.846 - 00:00:40.550, Speaker D: Now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet.
00:00:40.630 - 00:00:43.094, Speaker C: Generally speaking, airdrops are kind of pointless anyways.
00:00:43.262 - 00:00:46.038, Speaker D: Unnamed trading firms who are very involved.
00:00:46.134 - 00:00:46.654, Speaker A: I like that.
00:00:46.702 - 00:00:48.190, Speaker D: ETH is the ultimate possibility.
00:00:48.270 - 00:00:51.210, Speaker B: Defi protocols are the antidote to this problem.
00:00:52.600 - 00:01:02.336, Speaker D: Hello, everybody. Welcome to the chopping block. Every couple weeks, the four of us get together and give the industry insider's perspective on the crypto topics of the day. So quick intros. First, we've got Tom, the defi maven and master of memes.
00:01:02.488 - 00:01:03.380, Speaker C: Hello, everyone.
00:01:04.200 - 00:01:07.240, Speaker D: Next, we've got Robert, the crypto connoisseur and tsar of Superstate.
00:01:07.360 - 00:01:08.460, Speaker B: Good afternoon.
00:01:08.920 - 00:01:13.200, Speaker D: And today joining us, we've got special guest Jano, media elite at Blockworks.
00:01:13.320 - 00:01:21.560, Speaker A: Oh, the media elite. Tough intro. Waiting all day for, what is this eve gonna say? And it's the media elite.
00:01:21.680 - 00:01:24.076, Speaker C: I thought this was supposed to be an alliterator, you know?
00:01:24.148 - 00:01:24.920, Speaker D: I know.
00:01:25.820 - 00:01:29.300, Speaker A: It felt like a minute. And he's coming for the media jabs already. All right.
00:01:29.380 - 00:01:38.332, Speaker D: I know, I know. Look, that's. This is going to be the media super show. Last week, we had politics. This week we're coming after the media. And so I'm haseed, the head hype man at Dragonfly. We're early stage investors in crypto.
00:01:38.332 - 00:01:59.828, Speaker D: But I want to caveat. Nothing we say here is investment advice, legal advice, or even life advice. Please, chopping block that XYZ for more disclosures. So we got a lot of people saying last week, hey, politics is fun, but, like, please don't be a politics podcast. Let's talk about crypto. We decided this week we're going to shift it up a little bit. We brought, of course, our good friend from Blockworks, Yano.
00:01:59.828 - 00:02:23.884, Speaker D: Bring him on the podcast and talk a little bit more about some of the higher level things that are going on in the crypto landscape. You very generously gave us some topics that you wanted to run through today. I'm going to hand off the reins a little bit to you and let you drive some of the discussion that we're going to just bounce off popcorn style a little bit to some of the topics that you wanted to jam on today. So what would you propose that we light things up with?
00:02:23.972 - 00:03:15.870, Speaker A: Sure. Let's start with maybe the easiest conversation before you guys tear into me for random media things. The first question I'd love to get your guys take on and maybe we can have a conversation around this is it's starting to feel like the airdrop slash token. And I will admit I listened to the last episode, but haven't listened to a few before that. So I don't know if you guys have already covered this, but it's feeling like the token airdrop narrative is kind of coming to an end. I would say like this era of airdrops kicked off with the Jitto Airdrop, and once Jitto did their airdrop, basically everyone said we got a sprint to market, and this has been a six or nine month sprint to the market. But now what you're starting to see is people starting to do airdrops at valuations lower than their last private, private market valuation.
00:03:15.870 - 00:04:03.826, Speaker A: And one of the things I'm curious to get your guys take on is I think I've been waiting for people to invest in apps. Everyone says, when are the apps coming? It's the same question people said a few years ago, when are the institutions coming? Now it's one of the apps coming. I'm curious what you guys think. The thing that will get people to when the apps come is really, when do people invest in the apps? So, like Tom and Haseeb, in your guys shoes, when are you incentivized not to invest in the new l one and the new l two, but incentivized to invest in the new apps? So I'm starting to see this like infra fatigue meets tokens, going live at valuations lower than the last private market. And I'm curious to hear your guys take on is this what pushes us into the okay, fine, we'll finally invest in apps era? Or how do you guys think about that? So maybe we can kick off with that conversation.
00:04:03.978 - 00:05:12.198, Speaker B: Well, I can start with the most controversial view, because I assume do it. I don't think there's ever going to be a seismic shift in valuations where apps are going to become suddenly more attractive than infrastructure. I think one of the reasons why investing in apps is difficult is an app has to be judged on its own traction, and infrastructure for a long time does not have to be judged on its own traction. With an app, you're basically forced into a very complex process of saying, will this specific app succeed? Will it get critical mass? Will it make hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue or value or whatever to justify its valuation today, which is hopefully a quarter or a 10th of what its future value is going to be? And the app, in its own way has to have traction or product market fit or success. Otherwise it's shot in the dark and the valuation for its with infrastructure, almost all infrastructure has ever launched has been a build it in. Hopefully they will come type scenario. There are no users.
00:05:12.198 - 00:05:57.800, Speaker B: It's accepted to be much more speculative. And I don't think it has to be judged on its product market fit or its traction in the same way, coupled with the fact that infrastructure valuations, once things are public, are like 1020 whatever times app valuations, I mean 50 x in a lot of cases. And so you're discounting a much larger number in a much more rosy glasses, I think, with infrastructure than with apps. And so I think if I were a founder, I probably would not want to be building an application unless I was highly confident that there was going to be actual adoption and actual usage.
00:05:58.460 - 00:06:18.776, Speaker D: Okay, so I agree with the basic facts that you laid out about, okay, valuation differences and what founders want to be doing and everything, but I strongly disagree with the theory that you're propounding here. And I think it's also implicit whenever somebody says, why is it there's so much funding for infrastructure as opposed to applications? Implicitly, what they're saying is that you should be funding applications.
00:06:18.948 - 00:06:19.464, Speaker B: Agreed.
00:06:19.512 - 00:06:47.018, Speaker D: And you're not doing it because you're lazy, because you're wrong, because you're greedy or something. It's almost like for the good of the industry, you should be funding applications and you're not doing that even though you should. Okay. I generally come from a place of assuming that markets are efficient. So let's start there. Let's assume that the market is right. What does it mean that the market's right? What the market's right means is that it is correct for infrastructure to be valued more highly than applications.
00:06:47.018 - 00:07:30.980, Speaker D: What would that imply if we take that seriously? First, it would imply that there are very few applications that have been shown to actually accrue value and be useful to people and in practice, we see that most of the applications that did get funded, people say that, oh, where's all the funding for applications? Remember in 2021, 2022, how many social apps, how many metaverse things, how many games were getting funded? Huge amounts of capital were poured into applications. And of course, most of that ended up not getting any kind of consumer traction. It's not true that historically there hasn't been a large amount of capital invested into applications. There has been, and most of that investment failed. Most. That investment went to zero or close to zero. Not all of it, obviously, but much of it.
00:07:30.980 - 00:08:32.668, Speaker D: The first thing is that it's just not true that we've only ever funded up infrastructure. Second is the other thing to understand is that when somebody says UVC should be funding more applications, what they're saying implicitly is that there should be more applications. It's bad for crypto that there aren't more applications. But another way you could read the current market structure is you could say, actually, we already know what the killer applications for crypto are, which is that they are sending money, spending money, using DeFi and a few other things that we already understand as, you know, stable coins. And they actually don't require new apps. Like, we kind of already found the things that people are going to do in the same way you could say on the Internet, look, it didn't take us that long to figure out what people are going to do on the Internet is like, post stuff about their lives and buy things, right? Like that core loop of activity we basically figured out 20 years ago. And there's been fairly small innovative, like, oh, there's Snapchat and stories and there's TikTok now.
00:08:32.668 - 00:09:09.668, Speaker D: But like, the core things of what we're going to do on the Internet, we actually did figure out a very long time ago. And you can see, you know, you can ask, like, why aren't people funding new kinds of social experiences on the Internet? And the answer is, because we found them. We found what people want to do on the Internet, and we don't need new versions. Now, that is not to say that there's literally nothing new that people are going to do on blockchains, but it does mean that the rate of people finding new things on blockchains to do is much lower than what we would expect it to be if we hadn't found those killer use cases for blockchains. Right. The idea of, okay, people are funding infrastructure, therefore we don't have applications, therefore we're never going to go mass market. I reject that claim.
00:09:09.668 - 00:09:48.212, Speaker D: I think actually it is the case that we found the mass market applications for crypto, which are about money. It's not social, it's not gaming. These things may work, and I'm bullish on some version of them working at some scale, but the real mass market thing is the money stuff. And that doesn't require a new application, a new team, a new token. It just requires a substrate on which to do those things. And for aave or compound or for Uniswap to dual deploy or not dual multi deploy on this new chain that people launch. And so the fact that infrastructure is very highly valued is another way of saying that the thing that people want to do, all it requires is infrastructure.
00:09:48.212 - 00:10:16.718, Speaker D: It requires block space. Block space is the thing that's really valuable. And if you build better block space, that huge market that is available to you, of all the people who want to do things on blockchains, that's the market you're competing over. And that market is definitely really big. That's why these companies are projects that launch infrastructure are valued so highly, because we know the Tam is big. But what is the Tam for somebody launching a social app? I don't know. Nobody really knows.
00:10:16.718 - 00:10:50.640, Speaker D: We're guessing that there will be a real market here. You look at Farcaster, Farcaster, it's like 60, 70,000 daily actives. Maybe there's a long term market there, but it's also possible that maybe there's not. But there's no question that there is a market for building really valuable infrastructure, because this is a problem we know we have. Everybody in the industry knows we have an infrastructure problem, and that's what all these new people building infrastructure are trying to fix. So that's my steel man, for why it is the case that VC's are funding infrastructure more than applications is because we know there's a there, there.
00:10:52.540 - 00:11:07.012, Speaker C: Yeah, I, uh. I more or less agree. I think, um, you know, this is kind of a classic. Like, you show me the incentives, I show you the outcome kind of thing. Like, uh, yeah, it's, it's. People want to get paid. And in apps, there have not been great outcomes.
00:11:07.012 - 00:11:57.424, Speaker C: There isn't really liquidity, there isn't really necessarily durability. Like, there's a lot of sort of, um, inherent issues. And I think there are still some verticals that I think are still being explored. Like, I think polymarket, which we announced our investment to recently, is a good example where, yeah, it's fundamentally financial. At the end of the day, it's not decentralized Twitter, but it did take a while to manifest immature and get liquidity and sort of hit its current trajectory. And so that was a new category that maybe you could invest to a while ago, but it would have been attractive until more recently. But I think the question for how this kind of changes is how do you produce great outcomes for investors? That's ultimately what's going to signal to the market that, hey, this sector requires more allocation.
00:11:57.424 - 00:12:34.708, Speaker C: And the weird part is apps actually do monetize quite well. I mean, you look at how much money telegram bots are making or wallets are making or front ends are making, and it's tens of millions, hundreds of millions of dollars, way more than most chains and infrastructure. And the question is like, well, why isn't the public market rewarding these things? I think the question is kind of almost flipped. Like, people on crypto Twitter get mad. They're like, well, why aren't you buying the banana gun token? You go do that. That's an app and you're not. And so it's like, yeah, it feels kind of a spider man putting fingers at each other.
00:12:34.708 - 00:12:40.504, Speaker C: Uh, you know, the market, the market is the market. And I think stuff is, is generally, you know, probably priced accordingly.
00:12:40.632 - 00:13:21.546, Speaker D: Well the thing, the thing I want to keep hammering on is this like moralizing about it, right? Like generally, if you, if you, if you take the view that the markets are giving you information, they're embedding information about where value is likely to accrue, then, you know, saying that, well, the founders, like they just want to get paid and like the investors, they just want to make money implies that the prices are wrong. And what Im making is a stronger point, which is not, thats obvious. Yes, of course, the investors, their incentives are over here. The founders, their incentives are also in the same direction. But I actually dont think the markets are wrong. I think the markets are correctly saying that. We do know that the Tam and the value for building the next ethereum, building the next Solana is actually really high.
00:13:21.546 - 00:14:15.066, Speaker D: And thats correct. And the chance that you build a banana botanical the next telegram bot and it becomes, you know, yeah, it can make, you know, $30 million a year or something, but what's the likelihood that it's going to make $200 million a year or a billion dollars a year or be the future of money or whatever, you know, however it is you want to describe, you know, a leading layer, one I think the market's correctly saying not very likely. Now there is the flip side of that. And you alluded to that a little bit, Tom, about the modernization, which is, okay, let's say you invest into, uh, you know, some, some business that is, uh, you know, kind of a brick and mortar business that just makes money on chain, uh, launches a token, maybe the token. It's like, is this thing decentralized? You know, is this thing a security? Is it not like there are some regulatory and legal questions that do get hairier when you talk about applications that have centralized teams. So that's an element of it that does play into the market. And that's a real thing.
00:14:15.066 - 00:14:26.676, Speaker D: That is a market structure thing. Um, but I, but I get the thing that I guess I'm trying to take issue with is, like, the lazy, the laziness idea that, like, investors are being lazy or the founders are being lazy. I don't think.
00:14:26.828 - 00:14:32.548, Speaker A: Why aren't the VC's moving this space forward by investing in the, by investing in the apps? That's obviously what. Yeah, yeah, well, venture.
00:14:32.604 - 00:14:34.280, Speaker B: Venture is not a charity at the end.
00:14:34.820 - 00:15:03.488, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree with that. I mean, I think there's basically three camps, right? There's three camps of crypto people, of what they think about the world. There's the bitcoiners who think from a macro perspective and, like almost sometimes doomsday, and it's like a macro hedge, and it's a hedge against chaos, basically. That's the Mac, that's the bitcoin crowd. Then theres what id call the finance crowd, which says that DeFi is going to our traditional capital markets. Rails were created in the early 1970s. Theyre super antiquated.
00:15:03.488 - 00:15:33.340, Speaker A: Theyre all built on cobalt. Theyre like 55 years old. We just got to create better rails, and thats a better product. And that in and of itself would be the biggest transformation since we created the Internet and moved information online. Then theres bucket number three, which id call maybe the Chris Dixon camp, which is Facebook, Amazon, Google, et cetera, have too big of monopolies. And the information used to flow freely on the Internet. And now the information flows through five companies.
00:15:33.340 - 00:15:54.272, Speaker A: And I think the first one is, and we need crypto to break down those monopolies. And I think the first one is right, that will eventually play out. The second one is right. That will eventually play out. But I think, Haseeb, to your point, I'm not convinced the third one is right yet. And that will play out. Like, I think about social apps.
00:15:54.272 - 00:16:42.654, Speaker A: I'm like, I don't know, like, TikTok is such a good product, I don't download it because it's so damn good like that. It's so good of an app that I refuse to download it because my rat brain is not able to not open it. That's crazy to me. Now, I do think there's probably a fourth bucket, which we haven't seen yet, which we will see, which are marketplaces connecting some sort of supply and demand that hasn't been able to be unlocked because of maybe the frictions of web two with quotes around this big web two bucket, in the same way that things like a smartphone and the Internet unlocked the Airbnbs and the ubers of the world. I think we could. Maybe this is. Maybe this is deep in, maybe this is something else.
00:16:42.654 - 00:16:51.622, Speaker A: But I do think we'll get some sort of marketplace, like some of these companies that don't look like apps getting unlocked. So I don't know what you guys.
00:16:51.646 - 00:18:00.600, Speaker D: Think of that, but yeah, I think coordination networks, if you think of DPN and some of these other sectors that look similar, where you're getting people to cooperate in a way with their resources they might not otherwise. That feels like a real thing to me. I don't know that it's going to be an aggregate at the scale of the financial use cases for crypto. And I agree with you. Look, there are many vc's who have really bet the farm on this idea that there is going to be this mass consumer moment for crypto, and that crypto is fundamentally about disempowering or disintermediating some of the media monopolies that we have, the Facebooks and the Googles and so on. For me, from the beginning of Dragonfly, we've always taken this view that you cannot be too thesis driven in crypto because crypto is just too difficult to anticipate where it's going. You kind of have to shut up and listen rather than try to dictate where it's supposed to go or where you said it's going to go, or where your blog posts and your whole storyline about what crypto is supposed to do or what it ought to do is going to define how you invest.
00:18:00.600 - 00:18:50.430, Speaker D: Like as an investor, your job, especially in a space that's moving as quickly and is as unpredictable as crypto, is to pay attention and to change your mind as quickly as possible. There were many, many times in the past where I was a lot more agnostic about how crypto was going to interact with things like social and consumer and gaming and so on. And you just have to make sure you're learning if your mind hasn't changed at all in the last two to three years about your view about social and gaming. Like, then you're just not paying attention, you're not learning. So what did you learn? Like, it's fine to still be bullish on these things and it's fine to still be working on them and building them. Like, I have all the respect in the world for people who are actually adapting and updating their worldview and changing their strategy based on what they're seeing, what worked and what didn't work and how consumers are reacting. But people who are just like a roomba and they're just like hitting a wall over and over again.
00:18:50.430 - 00:18:57.770, Speaker D: Like that is both. It's value destructive both for people as founders and even more so as investors.
00:18:59.510 - 00:19:33.688, Speaker A: The question, I think, becomes if you believe the tam of blockchains is all of the value that transacts in the world moving on chain, which is like a. Like, on a long enough time horizon. That's my belief is that I don't know if it's five years or ten years or 50 years, but one day all of the value in the world will move on chain in the same way that all of the information one day will move online. At some point the apps have to. At some point there has to. Like, Facebook has to be on chain if that's the case. Like one day.
00:19:33.688 - 00:19:40.472, Speaker A: Right? I think if you extend the thesis out on a long enough time horizon, but at that point, too tough to.
00:19:40.496 - 00:19:42.584, Speaker D: Robert, you shook your head there. What's.
00:19:42.712 - 00:19:49.880, Speaker B: I'm skeptical that one day Facebook will store all of its ridiculous large numbers of data on a blog.
00:19:49.920 - 00:19:56.908, Speaker A: It might not be their data. Maybe it's just the financial transactions. Maybe that's what happens.
00:19:57.004 - 00:20:28.580, Speaker B: Maybe it's the extremely high value data, which is a small subset of the infinite terabytes of data they have on every photo ever created for, yeah. Financial transactions. But I would be highly skeptical of the statement that Facebook will one day be entirely on blockchain. To your point, maybe a small sliver, the most valuable sliver, will be just like. I don't think all data will be on the Internet. Like, there's still, you know, roughly 50 years into the Internet, you know, not yet 100% adoption of information online.
00:20:30.840 - 00:20:31.752, Speaker A: Preston.
00:20:31.776 - 00:21:03.520, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, obviously, a big part of the reason why you don't put data on the Internet is that if it's not on the Internet, people can't pack it. Right? So there's a. We've learned this lesson many times in crypto. Is that. Yeah, crypto is putting something on a blockchain, makes it totally open. Right? Obviously, you can encrypt it, you can do ZK magic, blah, blah, blah, but at the end of the day, you are creating more connectivity between your thing and the outer world if you want that. And there are many things for which that is a trade off worth making or even to your benefit, but it's not worth making for everything.
00:21:03.520 - 00:21:36.186, Speaker D: Obviously, there are some things that I would not want to put, I don't know, my personal finances entirely on the blockchain. Uh, because, yeah, maybe I can obfuscate it. Maybe I can do some fancy something, something something. Um, but, you know, what's. What is the benefit to me of. Of doing that right now? It's like, my. My feeling is that, you know, you don't have to be a maximalist in order to believe in crypto, you know, in the same way that you don't have to believe that, uh, we're all going to be living our lives intermediated through VR goggles to believe in VR.
00:21:36.186 - 00:21:59.812, Speaker D: Right. I think that VR and Ar are going to be fantastic technologies, but then you have, like, sort of the balaji vision of, like, okay, well, we're now just entirely going to live in bubbles and, like, interact through the metaverse. And I'm like, I don't think that's true. I think that, like, with all things, reality is messier and has kind of porous boundaries. And the way that real technologies play out is that they're. They're kind of. They're.
00:21:59.812 - 00:22:18.586, Speaker D: They're kind of messy and complicated. And I think the same thing is probably going to be true for blockchain. Is that. Yeah, Facebook may start adopting more crypto things, but probably it'll be like this little 10% thing or 5% thing off to the side and the main application, like, Facebook works. You know, I don't. I don't see Facebook crying out for. Oh, my God.
00:22:18.586 - 00:22:21.610, Speaker D: You know, we have this massive problem that only blockchains can solve.
00:22:21.730 - 00:22:31.538, Speaker A: Yeah, Hazee, I don't know if you've handed the mic to me, which is a horrendous mistake to run, or if I'm asking, go ahead, you are.
00:22:31.594 - 00:22:37.112, Speaker D: I will say, the way you naturally just, like, started driving the mic, I'm like, this guy's a pro. We gotta step up our game.
00:22:37.176 - 00:23:21.632, Speaker A: This guy somehow agreed to do a. Run a podcast network. That is the thing. I actually would love to get your guys take on this thing that I spend, like, 110% of my life thinking about, which is crypto media and research and stuff in the world that I live in, which is crypto media and research and information flowing in crypto, basically. It actually has been a really crazy last twelve months, our two biggest media competitors sold the block, sold to Foresight Ventures, which is the family office of Bitget. And Coindesk sold to bullish, which is the block one EOS company, holding company, basically, or exchange or whatever you want to call it. It's been crazy in my world.
00:23:21.632 - 00:23:28.478, Speaker A: But I would actually, and I'm happy to talk about crypto media, but would actually love to get your guys take a, um. As people who probably.
00:23:28.534 - 00:23:33.050, Speaker D: So, first question. First question, before you get into that, why did you guys not sell?
00:23:33.830 - 00:23:35.670, Speaker B: Ooh, zing ding.
00:23:35.830 - 00:23:58.970, Speaker A: Haseem. We didn't have to sell. We were not a forced seller. So coindesk, it was owned by DCG. DCG is owned by Barry. They owned Genesis and Grayscale. And Genesis went belly up through the FTX stuff, or through three arrows loans, and we all know that story.
00:23:58.970 - 00:24:15.206, Speaker A: And they basically. And Barry was paying the bills. So every two weeks, they would. Kevin, the CEO of Coindesk, would go to Barry and say, please, sir, may I have some more? I need to make payroll this week. And that went on for months. And they basically. They were a for seller.
00:24:15.206 - 00:24:24.862, Speaker A: Right. I think at a certain point, Barry just said, get this thing off my hands. My experiment with media has not really paid off for me. Although I guess it did, because he bought the company for, like, 500K.
00:24:24.926 - 00:24:25.542, Speaker D: Yeah, it did.
00:24:25.646 - 00:24:58.084, Speaker A: Yeah. No, no, sorry. It actually extremely dead. He bought the company for $500,000 and sold it for 80 million or whatever, but. So they were a for seller, and then the block was a for seller, because their CEO at the time, this guy, Mike McCaffrey, took 40 odd million dollars under the table from SBF. And so they were funding the company via loans from SBF, and that then they had to basically, he, McCaffrey, owned the most of the company, and so they had to repay the loans, and so they needed to do this deal. So there were four sellers.
00:24:58.084 - 00:25:29.552, Speaker A: Blockworks has a weird funding history. So we actually didn't raise any money for the first six years of the business. We didn't go. So, like, we actually raised $12 million in May of 2023. And outside of a hundred k friends and family check that we took on day one of the business, that was the first outside capital we had taken. And the reason for that is we've been profitable since, I think, month three of the business. So we didn't really, we weren't a for seller.
00:25:29.552 - 00:25:37.840, Speaker A: Last year sucked. It was horrendous. It was a God awful year in many ways. It was very tough, but we weren't a four seller. So I think that's the answer.
00:25:37.920 - 00:25:53.360, Speaker D: You weren't a for seller. But my understanding was that there were a lot of bidders in the market at that time who were just looking to snatch up Mediataindeh companies. So I have to imagine, okay, you weren't a for seller, but you probably did get propositioned, I would assume.
00:25:53.820 - 00:26:36.000, Speaker A: Yeah, we got actually a lot more propositions for basically acquisition offers at the Picot top of 2021. The folks in 2020, actually, 2023 was the first time we ever looked at buying something. Right. We knew Coindesk and the block were looking to sell, and we said, let's take a look at these things. Some folks reached out in 2023 with saying, hey, look, we're looking at Coindesk. Would you be interested in selling, too, if we bought Coindesk? There were some PE roll up firms looking to do some things there, and we said no. But the crazy offers really came, I think, back in 2021, the picotop, there were crypto companies, there were media companies.
00:26:36.000 - 00:26:41.288, Speaker A: So that was really the time when we were like, do we do something? No.
00:26:41.444 - 00:26:42.140, Speaker D: So.
00:26:43.880 - 00:26:48.216, Speaker A: What do you guys think about, what do you guys think about crypto media? What do you think about, like, Tom.
00:26:48.248 - 00:26:50.152, Speaker D: What'S your take on crypto media businesses?
00:26:50.296 - 00:26:51.860, Speaker C: Love, love the media.
00:26:54.360 - 00:26:55.912, Speaker B: I love reading the media.
00:26:56.096 - 00:27:17.864, Speaker C: Yeah. Yeah. True. I mean, I think the media world overall right now is struggling and kind of going through a lot of changes. And, like, crypto media is part of that. And I think BuzzFeed is on life support and vice is dead. And these things that ten years ago were the darlings and were supposed to be huge are now dying.
00:27:17.864 - 00:28:06.522, Speaker C: There's mass newspaper consolidation. Paramount is also getting rolled. Everything is basically getting rolled up or consolidated or dying. And I think the models that you kind of see emerging are either a, you have something that is super proprietary, and you have an audience that has a high willingness to pay for it, and you are just sort of locked into whatever that is. And that's kind of like the information or substacks or things where it's like, this is like a one of one, and whatever you have is super valuable, and your audience has enough to spend or willing to spend it to go and buy it. Or in some ways, the media is kind of like a loss leader for some auxiliary business. And maybe that is, hey, doing something like events or you're selling something on the side.
00:28:06.522 - 00:29:04.756, Speaker C: That's kind of how like every creator monetizes, or like, unfortunately, like, the media industry also mirrors sort of the consolidation in the advertising industry, which is like, you know, for every incremental dollar that's going into digital advertising, like 99% of that is going into Facebook, Google, Amazon or TikTok. Like, basically none of it is going to legacy media. And then it's like, well, how do you actually get new cash in this business? The pie that you, in theory should be growing into is actually quite small and shrinking. And so I think that's why people are also looking for revenue sources elsewhere. I think crypto media arguably kind of falls into that bucket as well. It's maybe a little bit more distinctive or maybe a little more defensible in that you do have kind of that proprietary high Williams to pay audience. Maybe you do have some proprietary content that isn't just doing mass reporting.
00:29:04.756 - 00:29:19.200, Speaker C: But I think the monetization question is still like, okay, well, if you're not getting amazing industry leading cpms, what is that secondary revenue source? And it seems like everyone is sort of experimenting with that right now is sort of my perception.
00:29:19.710 - 00:29:35.370, Speaker D: Yeah, let's actually get even more basic because I think for a lot of people who haven't spent much time thinking about it or aren't VC's, they may just not have ever really thought about how a media business makes money. So, Tom, how do media businesses in crypto actually make money?
00:29:35.870 - 00:30:01.938, Speaker C: Sure. I mean, so a couple different sources. One obviously is advertising. That's like, hey, just basic display ads. It tap into an ad network and sort of it's the stuff that you see when you go to coindesk and banner ads and things like that, or sponsored articles as well. Stuff like paid premium subscriptions, research services, things like that. Things that maybe mirror more of how a Bloomberg or something would monetize.
00:30:01.938 - 00:31:26.240, Speaker C: And then three is these resources. So it's things like events, or it's things like direct research partnerships with projects or things that, again, are proprietary to those outlets. I think that the question is how sustainable is that? How big can you actually get with that? I think the rub is always mirrors traditional startups in that it's like, what amount of the value that you create can you actually capture? And if you think about crypto media, a lot of that is maybe selling to investors or selling to projects who by and large will capture a lot more of the value that you are creating for them than you will be able to. And so it's like, well, is there a way to sort of get into that flow? Is there a way to sort of sit more deeply with those teams? I think everyone is trying to figure that out and sort of get out of just basic news reporting. And that's why you kind of see people trying to go more and more premium or offer sort of deeper and deeper integrations. But I think, again, a lot of these problems are very similar to the problems that the media industry at large is facing, which is just like, hey, in a world where there isn't that sort of traditional revenue stream in the form of advertising, and we're just not competitive, not really able to sort of get incremental dollars there, how do we sort of think about diversifying it and looking elsewhere?
00:31:28.180 - 00:32:19.554, Speaker A: Let me simplify it a little bit. Media and information companies make money in two ways, and there's really only two ways. Advertising, which is simply the act of connecting potential buyers with active sellers, and subscriptions, which can be broken down into consumer subscriptions. Your $10 a month news subscription or enterprise subscriptions, buying a Bloomberg terminal. The reason media is struggling so much right now, I saw CNN announced another big batch of layoffs today, if you look back at the last 15 years of media. So I would categorize it as the era of mass consumer publications is over. Media, I still think is thriving.
00:32:19.554 - 00:32:45.432, Speaker A: But at two ends of the spectrum, New York Times. New York Times is doing phenomenally well. People might not realize that the New York Times is of the world, which is really a product company at this point. So I think it's 30 or 40% of their business comes from their games and cooking. Another big bucket comes from their subscriptions. Advertising is dropping a lot, year after year. And then the other end of the spectrum, which is niche publications.
00:32:45.432 - 00:33:27.750, Speaker A: So industry dive, for example, industry dive just sold for $500 million. They are a collection of 22 different niche newsletters. Shipping operators, grocery store operators. They have a newsletter with 300 grocery store operators, minuscule newsletter, but it's an audience that you can't really reach anywhere else. So those are the two buckets of media that are doing well. If you look at from 2005 to 2015, media was really just a game of how could you distribute content further, how could you be more discoverable and how could you get socialized? And that was, you guys probably remember the brands. It was like Vox and Vice and Buzzfeed and Complex and Huffington Post.
00:33:27.750 - 00:34:08.012, Speaker A: And they raised a hundreds of millions of dollars on the idea that we could build a media company optimized for the Internet and for social. So they became the new media giants, and they actually, at one point in time, kind of passed the likes of the New York Times and Wall street journals. And the game back then was about. It was less about reputation and it was more about being the first to link. It was like the first to link or URL to reach back to the user. The difference between, if you think about how it worked back then is if a user googled something or saw it on social, they just clicked the link. Remember clicking all those dumb links on Facebook and you're like, oh, a survey from my friends, whatever, I don't care.
00:34:08.012 - 00:34:48.532, Speaker A: The URL, they just looked for anything and they just clicked it. And they didn't actually think about the actual media site. But around 2015, 2016, that really reversed. Users started to make sure that anything they clicked on was a source that they knew and trusted, and the game really changed. And the biggest thing that these venture backed media companies, like, when you see Vox and Vice and Buzzfeed and Complex and HuffPost, the biggest thing they got wrong is that media companies are like blockworks, in one word, is just trust. We can do so many things wrong, but if people keep trusting blockworks, we'll ultimately be fine. And you can't throw money at trust.
00:34:48.532 - 00:35:26.232, Speaker A: You can throw money at customer acquisition, you can throw money at sponsorship sales, but you can't throw money at trust. It can't be hacked faster with money. And it's nice to build a media company with a lot of page views, but in order to really grow a media company, you have to create brand affinity. Which is another one of the reasons that we lead so heavily into podcasts and lead with our people is because people trust people. They don't trust brands these days. And I think people are now waking up to the fact that you have to actually focus on an actual audience as opposed to random people hitting your site. So for blockworks, I don't care about.
00:35:26.232 - 00:35:27.200, Speaker A: Yeah, go, go.
00:35:27.320 - 00:36:24.290, Speaker D: Okay, so speaking of that, we were talking a little bit pre show about that famous op ed that blockworks ran, which was an op ed, I can't remember the name. It was some journalists who basically said, you know, to be a one issue voter in this election about crypto is wrong or something along those lines. Right. That op ed pissed off a lot of people, created something of a firestorm. It was. It was one of these moments that I imagine if you run, obviously, I don't know, but if you run a media company, I imagine it's a very nerve wracking moment to have you know, sort of become as an organization, the main character of Twitter, when you're trying to, yourself, write about main characters. So to your point about, okay, trust and the brand that we're trying to build at blockworks, how did you think about that moment going through this crucible of, oh, my God, the Internet, the industry is mad that we ran this.
00:36:25.510 - 00:37:00.960, Speaker A: So the way that I think about blockworks in terms block works is blockworks is nothing if not trust. And trust can be built in many ways. And for me and Mike building blockworks, it's been built on having blockworks sit at the cutting edge of crypto. So I don't. There's a reason, like, you'll never see, like, what is bitcoin on blockworks? Like, we don't care about the 101 level content, even the 201 content, we don't care as much about. That's why we build brands like Xerox research and Bell curve and permissionless. And we try to take people like my audience and the person I care about and close my eyes thinking about is like, you guys, it's like crypto natives.
00:37:00.960 - 00:37:37.850, Speaker A: It's not the person from Adidas looking at crypto, like Coindesk and cointelegraph and other people can have that audience. So the cutting edge of crypto at a couple months ago, now it's mainstream, I'd say. But the cutting edge of crypto a couple of months ago was the election. It was this thing that everyone was thinking about that nobody was publicly talking about except for probably Ryan Selkus, but nobody was really publicly talking about it. Nobody would say, I know what I am pro Biden, or you know what I am pro Trump. It wasn't a thing. The chasm had not been crossed.
00:37:37.850 - 00:37:54.382, Speaker A: And so, yeah, we published this op ed. Actually, Robert, I was sitting across from. So I don't. So I don't see any news stories before I deal with sponsorships and sales at blockworks. Right. So I'm actually not in a single editorial channel in slack. I've been kicked out of all of them.
00:37:54.382 - 00:38:07.610, Speaker A: I'm not allowed in them. I don't see a story on blockworks until it hits our website. So I'm sitting across from Robert at dinner, and he, I think he maybe I'll kindly phrase something along the lines of, what is this shit?
00:38:08.630 - 00:38:18.478, Speaker B: Yeah, I was being rude, and I was like, very briefly checking Twitter during dinner with Yano, and I immediately was like, oh, you've got to see this.
00:38:18.574 - 00:38:46.344, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think Hayden looked at it for a second. He's like, yeah, that's trash or something along those lines. And it had, like, five likes and, like, maybe a retweet. And I was like, I'll look at it in the morning. That's okay. And I woke up in the morning and had about somewhere between 71 hundred messages from everyone from our investors to our clients, to my friends saying some form of, what is this shit? And it had probably, I don't know.
00:38:46.344 - 00:39:09.748, Speaker A: I've had probably 2000 retweets and, quote, tweets saying blockworks has come. And, you know, they're actively trying to bring down the industry and things like that. So that was a lot of fun dealing with it. My take on the op ed is, here's the thing that people got to realize. Nobody read the damn op ed. And when I say nobody, it got several thousand views. I don't know the exact number, but it got several thousand views.
00:39:09.748 - 00:39:50.922, Speaker A: So people did read the op ed, but the number of people, I think, got 1.5 million views on Twitter and, like, several thousand views on blockworks. So the number of people, quote, tweeting it and posting about it, nobody's actually reading the article. And I think the article. The reason I don't personally agree with everything in the article, but the reason that I like having an article like that on blockworks is it's an opinion piece by one of our opinion writers, Molly Jane, who's phenomenal. There are three types of pieces from blockworks. There's news stories, there are op eds, and there's this other thing that people do in media called, like, an editorial.
00:39:50.922 - 00:40:09.498, Speaker A: Like, the editorial board writes something. And there's a lot of. I think people thought that this was an editorial board piece by blockworks. It's like, this is blockworks opinion, and it's not. It's one person's opinion. It's Molly Jane's opinion. And for that reason, like, I mean, I like that we wrote it.
00:40:09.498 - 00:40:31.408, Speaker A: It got the con. Like, I saw people who have never publicly posted about their political take. Then it stirred them up so much. And they said, I am pro Trump for these reasons, or I am pro Biden for these reasons. And that, to me, is a success. We were at the cutting edge of crypto, and we got people to have this bigger conversation, Preston.
00:40:31.424 - 00:40:45.124, Speaker D: But was there a lesson that you took away from that whole episode, or is there no lesson? It's just like, well, wrote an opinion piece, got a lot of people excited. That was the point.
00:40:45.252 - 00:41:25.320, Speaker A: I think the lesson. Yeah, I mean, the lesson is, if you're. I mean, if you're a niche b two B media company, and you say something that goes against what the industry likes, should be ready for some backlash. But, no, I think one of the things that we did afterwards is, like, we made it much more clear from a UI UX perspective that it was an opinion, but we also pennedore some alternative opinions as well. So Austin Campbell wrote a piece about being a single issue voter on the conservative side. Mike and I just had Ryan Selkus on the podcast. So I think a lesson for us is, when you share an opinion, it's very good to share the other side of the opinion as well.
00:41:25.320 - 00:41:54.306, Speaker A: And we do things like, we have this podcast called Lightspeed. I'd call it a pro monolithic, whatever you wanna call monolithic, or integrated chain podcast. It's very, like, Solana Monad. Like, what? Whatever. You know, the monolithic chains. I would say where we have another show that we just launched called expansion, which is, like, modular, like, movement and celestia. And, like, I think it's just good as a media company to not take one side always.
00:41:54.306 - 00:42:13.390, Speaker A: But, no, the lesson, like, my takeaway is, like, I mean, I told Molly Jane this last week is like, let's keep them coming. As long as they sit at the cutting edge of crypto, let's keep opinion pieces coming. So now we, like, we lost some business from it. Like, I. We had a sponsor.
00:42:13.430 - 00:42:14.086, Speaker D: Really?
00:42:14.278 - 00:42:19.566, Speaker A: Yeah, we had a. We had a sponsor. Say, I don't like what you're doing for the industry. What?
00:42:19.758 - 00:42:26.126, Speaker D: Hold on. You got a name and shame. Who? What fucking sponsor? Based on an editorial? Are you kidding me?
00:42:26.198 - 00:42:44.390, Speaker A: I would never. But that is like. I mean. I mean, the amount of times that we've lost a sponsorship deal because of something editorial writes is like, the amount of times I've had a salesperson come to me and say, I've got this $200,000 deal, but we just wrote this piece on them. That is not a super kind piece. Can we take the piece?
00:42:44.430 - 00:42:45.726, Speaker D: Okay, that's different. That's different.
00:42:45.758 - 00:42:51.302, Speaker C: Well, yeah, doing, like, journalism is very different than a single person writing, like, an op ed piece.
00:42:51.486 - 00:43:22.860, Speaker D: Yeah, like, writing an op ed about, like, yeah, if you're like, okay, you know, we're gonna shit on Project XYZ using some journalism, and then they're like, oh, no, we lost the deal from Project Equise. That. I get. Look, we're in an industry where that kind of stuff is going to happen. That you do have to navigate as a journalist is like, biting the mouth that feeds you. We are in this weird space where. Yeah, it's business journalism and business journalism, you do kind of need a symbiotic relationship with your business contacts and with your clients and your customers.
00:43:22.860 - 00:43:32.774, Speaker D: But I don't know, somebody getting freaked out over political op ed. I'm like, come on. Crypto is all about letting people say what they want to say.
00:43:32.902 - 00:43:59.094, Speaker A: I wake up every day. I wake up every day, and there's a person mad at me every morning for something that we have done. Right. There's somewhat like, here's the message I get every day. Why didn't you cover us? You don't like companies? I've been like, companies I've invested in, or sponsors or advertisers or big clients of our research platform. Why didn't you cover us? We just raised this money. Why didn't you cover us? So.
00:43:59.094 - 00:44:17.502, Speaker A: And it's funny, I'll see, like, people kind of shit on the media a lot because it's a. It's a. It's a common thing to do, right? It's like that, the damn media. But then, like, in the DM's and the emails, it's like, yeah, but please, please, please, can you write a story about us? So there's this fun, this fun little game that is happening here.
00:44:17.606 - 00:44:28.768, Speaker D: Yeah. So we've. We've had Balaji on the podcast before, and Balaji is kind of the. He's made himself known for this antimedia sentiment that he has. Really.
00:44:28.824 - 00:44:33.608, Speaker A: Ology was not happy with me. I was talking to Balaji after this op ed, and he really. Yeah, he said that.
00:44:33.624 - 00:44:34.900, Speaker D: Imagine he was. Yeah.
00:44:36.160 - 00:44:36.712, Speaker A: Isn't he?
00:44:36.736 - 00:44:41.488, Speaker C: About going direct? Why does he care what the media is writing about?
00:44:41.584 - 00:45:19.894, Speaker D: I mean, he spends half his time railing against the New York Times. So clearly, he does care what the media is writing about. Okay, so let's take seriously this idea. For those who have not heard, the concept of Balaji has very often advocated this idea that the media is kind of their own political body slash, their own social group that has their own incentives. Their incentives are to tell a story that is obviously, this is more general press, not business press, but it's sort of anti business, anti startup, anti innovation. They're out there to frame people, to create bad guys, to sell stories and get clicks. And as a result, these people do not have your best intentions in mind.
00:45:19.894 - 00:45:51.440, Speaker D: They are not pro tech, they are not pro business, they are not pro innovation. And so you should circumvent them. You should build your own audience. You should go direct, you should front run the media. You should not couch out to them and their sense that, okay, if it's your time to get a negative story written about you, just shut up and take it and accept the judge jury executioner status that the media has taken on with respect, especially when it comes to business and tech. And so the advice that he gives to startups and founders is, fuck the media. Don't talk to the media.
00:45:51.440 - 00:46:19.966, Speaker D: Don't do interviews with them. When they are coming to you to do a story. It's probably going to be negative, especially if you're in tech. And so go straight, circumvent them and effectively stab them in the back if you can, because they're coming for you first. Now, I think that does hit a little bit differently when you're talking about business media. Crypto media obviously has a much more symbiotic relationship with the industry that it serves than the New York Times, for example, like the New York Times. And I think it is a more fair criticism of the New York Times.
00:46:19.966 - 00:46:27.590, Speaker D: New York Times almost uniformly negative coverage of crypto basically ever. I can't think of any single positive story they've written about.
00:46:27.630 - 00:46:28.102, Speaker A: Yeah, forever.
00:46:28.166 - 00:47:05.320, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Except, you know, maybe a few small, like, oh, this one off project or something, or ethereum is going to proof of stake, you know, that seems good, I guess I. But almost everything else they've written has been negative, whereas Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg have been more even handed. Crypto journalism, I tend to think, actually is pretty positive, like usually good valence. They talk about good things. There's a few plays here and there where you'll see these very negative stories about particular things. But mostly when I see crypto media being negative, it's investigative journalism about a particular project that makes the industry look bad, but is honest work that needs to be done.
00:47:05.320 - 00:47:12.120, Speaker D: Curious, Tom, Rob, what's your guys take on this anti media slant and how it applies to crypto media in particular?
00:47:12.500 - 00:47:56.806, Speaker B: Well, I think the Venn diagram here is that there's a general distrust of the media from crypto circles because there's a generalized distrust of authority, and we'll call it a elites in general. Large people got into crypto in the first place because of this distrust. It runs through the veins of bitcoin and crypto in general to some degree. And so I think it's just one tangent that comes off of this presumption that truth is only inherent in blockchains and everything else is spinning.
00:47:56.948 - 00:48:10.950, Speaker D: So, yeah, you guys do just traditional financial journalism as well as crypto journalism. How do you notice the difference in the audience reception, or trust or distrust of the stuff you guys put out.
00:48:11.890 - 00:48:36.750, Speaker A: I mean, we are a crypto publication. If we cover finance or macro, it is only to serve the crypto audience. I would say I don't really care about the person outside of crypto. If we have a. If we were talking about interest rates, it is only to serve the person in crypto who is concerned about interest rates. We are not here to do good for the industry. I am here to do good for the industry.
00:48:36.750 - 00:49:11.082, Speaker A: Me personally, ive spent several years full time in the industry. Im 100% exposed to crypto, and I love this industry. I couldnt imagine working somewhere else but blockworks, as we have a bunch of different things that we do. We have events, we have research. They all serve different functions. The news team specifically is not here to prop up the, to just write press releases and to prop up companies in the industry. We are here to try to get to the bottom of truth, to try to bring truth to light, I would say.
00:49:11.082 - 00:49:48.836, Speaker A: I genuinely believe that. And I genuinely believe our journalists try to do that every single day. And it's really hard because every day, think about the role of a journalist. We get like 300 inbounds a day of press releases. They're just marketers promoting things all day. And you are trying to cut through the noise and basically figure out some kernel of truth. And if you even start talking about it publicly, you will get Molly Jane was getting death threats, right? For she was getting literal death threats and anti semitic comments for writing a piece about anti crypto stuff.
00:49:48.836 - 00:50:20.160, Speaker A: So I don't think people understand how hard it is to actually be a journalist. I think there are things that can happen, basically. I think what will end up happening in media, whether it's crypto media or not, is there will be some connection with actually, this thing that I really believe in is prediction markets. What? Prediction markets. Prediction markets help you size outcomes. I think actually, maybe Robert mentioned this on the last podcast here. Prediction markets help you sigh or maybe it's taruna or someone.
00:50:20.160 - 00:51:06.376, Speaker A: Prediction markets help you size outcomes, but they don't give you any context and nuance. What media gives you is the ability to uncover information that people maybe don't want you to have. I think there's this perfect marriage that will end up existing between this really nice, harmonious marriage between prediction markets and media and this ebb and flow. It feels like they're very disconnected today, but I actually think that's one place that blockworks will end up leaning into in our future. Is, I don't know, how do we find this equilibrium with prediction markets? Because I think that will ultimately drive the end goal of delivering truth to the reader, which is really the goal of the news team.
00:51:06.568 - 00:51:32.546, Speaker D: Okay, so what's your answer, then, to Balaji's line of attack? Which is to say, okay, you call it truth. You know, where have I heard that before? You know, Balaji would say, well, Pravda, Soviet Union. Right? That was literally the state backed newspaper whose name literally translated to truth. And what the media wants you to tell, wants you to believe, is that we are the arbiters of truth. We just tell the truth. Everyone else has a perspective except the news. The news is the view from nowhere.
00:51:32.546 - 00:51:59.708, Speaker D: It is the capital t truth. And Balaji would say, no, fuck you. You guys have your own perspective. You're pushing. And we, as entrepreneurs and as crypto denizens, have a responsibility to advance our own narrative the same way the news is advancing a particular narrative. Now, again, I assume that you're a friend of the industry and of Balaji, but how would you respond to that line of attack if Balaji saying, yeah, I assume he has.
00:51:59.804 - 00:52:10.844, Speaker A: Yeah, okay, I have two thoughts on this. One is there is no Capital M media. There's no group of, like, six media elites. I mean, they probably do meet in a room.
00:52:10.892 - 00:52:12.012, Speaker D: If they were, you'd be one of them.
00:52:12.036 - 00:52:56.528, Speaker A: Yeah, they probably do actually meet in a room and have lunch. But the reason why media is so liberal and liberals are very. Have been, for one reason or another in the last decade, anti tech and anti crypto. But the reason that media is so anti tech and anti crypto is because the people who work inside of media companies, specifically the journalists, are oftentimes very liberal. Right? They oftentimes came from Columbia or Harvard or Penn or whatever, east coast or West coast, kind of like more elite school that you want to talk about. So when people say the media is elite, media is not elite. The people who work inside of media companies oftentimes come from West coast or East coast elite school.
00:52:56.528 - 00:53:01.848, Speaker A: And the media is not liberal. The people who work inside of media companies has gotten.
00:53:01.944 - 00:53:03.700, Speaker D: What is the difference? Exactly.
00:53:05.160 - 00:53:22.366, Speaker A: The difference is that I don't think you can talk about capital M. There's no media. There's no goal of media. There's no goal of media to bring down crypto or to bring down tech. There's no, like, objective there. It's just the people inside are. Right.
00:53:22.398 - 00:53:23.610, Speaker D: So what is the objective?
00:53:24.030 - 00:54:16.494, Speaker A: The objective is to try to find the truth, I would say. Now I think the media, the capital M media, has done a horrendous job in the last decade of finding the truth. And the reason for that is because as they started to hire more and more liberal, like, very liberal people, they basically let the inmates run the asylum or something like that. There's probably a better analogy to use there, but it was like that happening at the same time as extreme. Cancel culture and people being very almost scared of their employees. One thing that ended up happening is, and I think the media of the last 50 years saw in the last ten, that wouldn't, like, there wouldn't have been a bias. I would say there wouldn't have been that big of a political slant on the news.
00:54:16.494 - 00:54:35.880, Speaker A: But in the last ten years, that basically ran away from the media companies, and they let their journalists get a little too, like, embed their own political stance into it. I think that will end up getting pulled back as people realize that's not what actually their readers want. But that's my take on it. Think of. Yeah, go ahead.
00:54:35.920 - 00:54:38.704, Speaker D: Okay, let me. Let me. Let me channel the spirit of Balaji here.
00:54:38.792 - 00:54:39.352, Speaker A: Sure.
00:54:39.496 - 00:55:03.402, Speaker D: And so I've imagined Balaji was here. What he would say is, okay, you've just said again that the objective function of the media is to arrive at the truth. And Balaji would say, fuck, no, it's not. The objective of the media is to maximize revenue and is to make money. And how do they make money? It's by selling their audience exactly what they want to hear. Sometimes their audience wants to hear the truth because they. They gain some benefit from hearing the truth.
00:55:03.402 - 00:55:23.922, Speaker D: But the reality is, like, there is no the truth. Right? There is. Okay. You make editorial decisions about what goes on the front page, about what goes where, what gets, how much reach. What stories do we work on this week? What is the theme of the overall coverage about, you know, this. What kind of people are we going to. Op eds don't just show up on the front, like, oh, somebody moseyed up and just, like, you know, put the.
00:55:23.922 - 00:55:44.078, Speaker D: There's no algorithm. Maybe there is very mildly. But ultimately, there are human beings. They're editors. They're making very discreet decisions about what goes where and what kind of stories we're going to write and what kind of framing or valence, we're going to give to these stories. Right. So what Balaji would say is, once again, this is the framing of the media.
00:55:44.078 - 00:55:55.080, Speaker D: To say, we are the view from nowhere. We are. We don't have a perspective. You might have a perspective, but as the media, we're just telling the truth. And if you don't like the truth, that's your problem, not the media's problem.
00:55:55.240 - 00:56:27.018, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's how it's always, I think that's how it's always worked, though. Like, in the, in the US, there have been, like, I was just reading this book about the civil war, and they talked about the three newspapers at the time. There was the newspaper that catered to the Republicans, the newspaper that catered to the Democrats. There are two, there are two factions of Democrats. There are the war Democrats and the Copperheads, who basically opposed the northern Democrats. And there was a newspaper that supported the copperheads, the newspaper that supported the war Democrats, and the newspaper that supported the Republicans. And I think that's like, yeah, it's truth for your, for your audience.
00:56:27.018 - 00:56:48.630, Speaker A: That's right. We're not a nonprofit and we're not a function of the state, basically. So it is truth. But there is always going to be a slant towards what your audience wants to hear. What I would argue is that the slant in the last ten years ran away from what it, from what it should have been. There will always be a slant, though. So that's what I think.
00:56:48.750 - 00:57:49.830, Speaker B: Well, here's my dystopian take. That slant is going to increase exponentially as more and more media and content, whether it's the algorithm on a Twitter feed or Google or whatever, as more and more content becomes programmatic in some fashion, I think that slant is going to continue to increase. And there's a lot of analysis right now on the, the fact that people's echo chambers are increasing as different algorithms are tailoring content to them, just like they did in the civil war between, you know, two parties of, you know, and two pieces of Democrats. You know, everyone's news is going to be customized to them with the op eds, the opinions, the biases, the phrasing. And I think this is just going to be a snowball that continues to build momentum. And I think, you know, like 20 years from now, you know, the news is going to be exactly what you want to read because that's what maximizes revenue to the hasibology perspective.
00:57:50.570 - 00:58:45.670, Speaker D: Well, okay. So I think what we're, there's a little bit of a, I sort of detect in this conversation a little bit of like the good old days when the media really was unbiased and there wasn't this echo chambery thing. And then, you know, Yano, you pointed out that, well, in the civil war, there were three newspapers, and nobody was under any illusion that there was the one unbiased one. Right? They were all written by factions of people who were fighting in a literal war. So obviously it is the case that not everywhere do people have this perception that the media is unbiased or even can plausibly be unbiased, that there is such a thing as a view from nowhere or just the truth. I think in some way maybe what people are nostalgic for is this period in, you know, the seventies and eighties and nineties when the country was actually like politics, was quite centrist. There was a lot of moderation, and the two parties were just much closer together.
00:58:45.670 - 00:59:24.792, Speaker D: I'm speaking specifically from an american perspective. And as a result, there was just less polarization. Not because, you know, oh, well, because the newspaper monopolies or because, you know, everybody was just friendlier back then or whatever, but just because that's how politics played out. That's what the issues of the day led people to, was being closer to the center. And as the parties have become more and more polarized relative to each other, that ends up impacting everything. Right? Like if you had a war, it is no surprise that there's going to be one newspaper that's pro the war, another newspaper that's on the other side, and nobody is going to be under the illusion at any point that there's a neutral newspaper. Right? You can't have a neutral newspaper when you're in a civil war.
00:59:24.792 - 01:00:04.790, Speaker D: There's just the ones on this side and the ones on that side. Right. And so on some level, if that is in fact happened to the culture, and I think there are good reasons to believe that, that are not about looking at, oh, well, people on Google and Facebook only read news. Let's cater to them. It's like, yeah, but they would be doing that anyway. It does feel like there's this thing. It's now, there's these stats that republicans are now, they're much less likely to marry democrats relative to any time in the last 30 years, there is this sort of cultural caste system that really did, it's really a relatively new thing in american politics, and this might just be an offshoot of that.
01:00:04.790 - 01:00:19.990, Speaker D: That is normal in a sense. This is how maybe things mostly are in the sweep of history. And where we were in the past maybe was abnormal, just a result of just a really strong middle class and not a lot of wars and not a lot of things to worry about.
01:00:21.620 - 01:00:52.478, Speaker A: I think there's a small. I agree with most of that, Haseeb. There's a small and there's a small nuance that I would add, which is, like, we have extreme. We have bias in all of the things that we do at blockworks, which is pro crypto. And then even inside of our different channels, we have our lightspeed newsletter. That's a pro like, monolithic, chain integrated, whatever you want to call it, a newsletter. We will always write the truth, but there might be a bent towards talking about things.
01:00:52.478 - 01:01:15.064, Speaker A: Like, in Solana land, for example, the moment. And I think having a bent is, like. Is fine. It's actually part of the media. The second that you let your bent get into writing things that I think are not factual, that's when you have a problem. And that's what I would say, categorize. The reason people don't like the mainstream media is not because they have a Bentley.
01:01:15.064 - 01:01:35.280, Speaker A: It's because they let their bent overpower what I think was actually factual. And that's a relatively new phenomenon. And Robert might be right. That might keep happening, or they might realize that, look, if you keep doing that, you're going to lose your whole audience. Your audience will not trust you anymore. So we'll see.
01:01:35.900 - 01:02:17.006, Speaker D: I think the lesson is the opposite, which is that if you try to be too neutral, your audience will yell at you, and they'll try to cancel you, and they'll pull their contracts and whatever. And, like, you know, I imagine for almost. For most media organizations, whether it's CNN or New York Times or Fox News, like, they know what their audience wants them to hear. And the only time they get a revolt is when the opposite narrative is. Is proposed, right? So now, look, you can say it's the truth, but if you guys wrote, you know, if you had a series for the entire week where you just look at comparing the amount of bitcoin emissions to, like, other horrible things in the world, then you would be people like, okay, yeah, this might be the truth, but, like, guys, fuck you. Like, what the fuck is this?
01:02:17.078 - 01:02:17.422, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:02:17.486 - 01:02:51.532, Speaker D: And I think that, like, I do agree with you. Like, look, at the end of the day, media is a business. The only time you can pretend not to be a business is when you're a monopoly. And we're way past the point of media monopolies, right? Media could pretend that we are a, you know, basically like a political branch. We're here for the. Protecting the integrity of our public discourse or whatever. That's something you can really only pull over people's eyes when you are monopoly, right? In the same way, Google can say, we are the Internet and our interests are just the interests of the Internet, they can say that because they're a monopoly.
01:02:51.532 - 01:03:42.172, Speaker D: But if you are, you know, I don't know, juniper networks or something, and you're just like another Internet company. You're like, no, no, I'm a business, and I have margins and I gotta, you know, protect my shareholders. That, I think, is where the media sits today, which is why a lot of these stories we have told for a long time about the media, that the media is this neutral thing that's there to protect citizens and to protect the public. Discourse only really works when either, one, the media is funded by the state, which in many countries is the case, or two, the media was a monopoly. But when those two things go out the window and we see the media acting like any other business, like, you know, the reason why people get fucking pissed is that they can see it with. It's a whole thing with Biden, right? They can see it for themselves. And the one thing people absolutely hate is to be told that they don't see what they actually see.
01:03:42.316 - 01:03:58.880, Speaker A: I know Robert has to leave. I have a whole thing about how. The third problem, Haseeb, is that there's a bad business model in just media. You need to build a product at the bottom of your funnel and create this, like, negative cac sass playback period. But that's a. Robert is going to get mad if I keep him.
01:03:58.920 - 01:04:11.200, Speaker D: Keep him here. Ok, we got to wrap things up. Yeah, no, thanks for coming on. Sharing your perspective, being our media punching bag, we hope as a media, that you're going to take it in stride. Yeah, exactly. Take it as. Look, you're a lead.
01:04:11.200 - 01:04:24.876, Speaker D: You can take it. You'll be fine. Hopefully you get more ridiculous acquisition offers. If anybody's looking to expend an extravagant amount of money on a media business, Yano is there. Block works.
01:04:24.988 - 01:04:25.492, Speaker A: I'm your guy.
01:04:25.516 - 01:04:26.360, Speaker D: You heard it here.
01:04:27.420 - 01:04:28.420, Speaker C: Anyway, thanks, Yano.
01:04:28.460 - 01:04:30.940, Speaker D: Awesome. Thanks for coming on. See, everybody?
