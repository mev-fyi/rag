00:00:00.200 - 00:00:10.770, Speaker A: And it's done great. But everybody who uses WBTC, the traders who trade it, the retail who holds it, everybody knows that it has sort of one kind of design flaw.
00:00:11.070 - 00:00:47.272, Speaker B: Hey everyone, Laura here. We've recorded this show in advance since I was headed out on vacation, and of course afterward news regarding WBTC broke that's highly relevant to the show. I did manage to get a written answer from Aki about the news, which we were able to insert ahead of publication. So just FYI, the news about WBTC is not referenced anywhere else except in that part of the recording. And now onto the show. Hi everyone, welcome to Unchained, your no hate resource for all things crypto. I'm your host, Laura Shin, author of the Cryptopians.

00:01:46.526 - 00:01:47.890, Speaker A: Hey, thanks for having me.
00:01:48.630 - 00:02:05.184, Speaker B: So your company implements something called discrete log contracts, or dlcs, for bitcoin, and it's something that's similar to wrapped bitcoin. It's very exciting, and I wanted to just hear your story of how you got into crypto and how you came to found DLC BTC.
00:02:05.352 - 00:02:35.568, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. Uh, I guess just to keep it short, I was born in Hungary, but grew up in Boston and Michigan. I've been writing code for almost 30 years. I'm, I'm 39, so I can say that, um, I was a management consultant. I was a VC in Boston in 2011. So I was looking at AI distributed databases, kind of the big data hadoop movement. I actually left VC to work at a database company for two years and then I started my own company, which was an AI marketing optimization company.
00:02:35.568 - 00:02:53.772, Speaker A: I did that for eight years, raised 15 million, did the whole thing. And I heard about bitcoin in 2011. Regrettably, I didn't kind of focus in then. I heard about ETH pretty early, too. I still regrettably didn't focus. So I thought, you know what? I missed a big pump. But hey, next best time is now.
00:02:53.772 - 00:03:22.572, Speaker A: There's still a lot to be built. And I should also add, my father's a scientist. That's why we came from Hungary to the US, and he's always created basic inventions. He's invented new science. I've made it my career to do applied inventions. So I take science, even for my last one, I take science that already existed, adapted it, built it into an engineered system to solve a business problem, and made a startup around it, raise venture. That's what I did last time.
00:03:22.572 - 00:03:47.240, Speaker A: That's what I wanted to do this time. Obviously, I'm not a cryptographer. I'm definitely not a bitcoin og. I wish I were, but I'm not. So I was looking at what sort of something novel that could be done in the bitcoin space. Why bitcoin? Well, you know, when I came to this space in 2021, I'm like, well, this makes sense. It's stable, there's a tremendous security foundation, et cetera.
00:03:47.240 - 00:04:13.690, Speaker A: So I wanted to do something new in this space. And basically, a friend of mine told me about dlcs. I'm like, what is that? And then I met the DLC community, learned up on it, and two plus years later, here we are with DLC BTC. But I think half of what we do is, I love to tell people about dlcs because I think it's a pretty undervalued part of the whole bitcoin building on bitcoin movement.
00:04:14.390 - 00:04:20.660, Speaker B: And so, yeah, explain what they are and what problem you think they solve for bitcoin.
00:04:20.830 - 00:04:28.768, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. So I like to say, I think when I saw at the conference, I'm like, surprise, surprise. There are some type of smart contracts on bitcoin.
00:04:28.904 - 00:04:33.984, Speaker B: They're not exactly he's referencing. We met at a conference in person. But anyway, keep going.
00:04:34.032 - 00:05:04.872, Speaker A: Yeah, it's kind of like, shocker. There is something programmable in bitcoin. It doesn't use opcodes. It's called a discrete log contract. It was actually invented at MIT six years ago by the creator of the Lightning network, Taj Dryja, which we were just on a panel with Taj in Nashville the other day. And so before he published the Lightning white paper, he published the DLC white paper. And the goal of the dlcs is to have some sort of programmable kind of logic on bitcoin.
00:05:04.872 - 00:05:52.384, Speaker A: And I would say, and the white paper is great, it's really interesting. But I would say the easiest way to explain it is a DLC is like an if then statement on bitcoin. And Tadge actually used a schnorr signature formula, which then support for schnorr was added three years ago with Taproot. So basically, three years ago, when the bitcoin mining network upgraded to taproot, dlcs actually became a thing you could do on bitcoin. And they're there, they're permissionless, anyone can build on them. But so what is a DLC? So basically, imagine you have like Alice and Bob, and they want to, and this is kind of the classic sports bethe example pointed out in the white paper. Like, let's say you have Alice and Bob, they both have bitcoin.
00:05:52.384 - 00:06:27.836, Speaker A: They want to make a sports bet. They need to get the result like who won the game from somewhere. So they find an oracle. Oracle, just meaning any entity that sends off chain data to bitcoin blockchain, they agree on an oracle and that Oracle kind of determines who won the game. So how do they do this on bitcoin? Well, Alice and Bob both agree to a set of potential conditional outcomes. Like, let's say one outcome is Alice wins, takes all the bitcoin. Maybe another outcome is Bob wins, maybe a third outcome is it's a tie and they split it.
00:06:27.836 - 00:07:03.408, Speaker A: So they agree to the conditional outcomes, and when they deposit their bitcoin, they pre sign all of these outcomes on the blockchain. So in that transaction, the oracle. And it gets a little. I don't wanna get too deep. And also, I'm not a mathematician, but the oracle does not know who the parties are, but the oracle contributes to these pre signed signatures. And then later, when the outcome is known, the oracle just publishes a number corresponding to. It's a number that kind of connects to one of these pre signed outcomes.
00:07:03.408 - 00:07:56.040, Speaker A: And then using that last piece of data, either Alice or Bob can execute the full bitcoin transaction and claim the bitcoin. Obviously the winner kind of has more of an incentive too, but basically that's it. So it's like a pre signed if then statement, and the oracle can be anything. And so that's the classic example. And I have to point out that the first kind of pioneers in DLCs were a company called shortbits. Chris Stewart and Nadav Cohen, who are brilliant bitcoin developers, they saw the white paper, they implemented it, they created, like, a DLC community, and they actually implemented the sports bet type scenario, and they had, like, a DLC Oracle running. And so when I came to the space in 2021, Chris was still doing kind of these, these monthly calls for the DLC community.
00:07:56.820 - 00:08:09.052, Speaker B: Okay. And so how does your company, DLC BTC, how are you implementing these types of contracts? Because. Yeah, you, you have a bunch of business deals going also to make this happen.
00:08:09.196 - 00:08:59.349, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. So we did not go down the sports bet route. So when we came to this space, we, meaning my co founder, Jesse and I, you know, we looked at it and we're like, this is really cool, but I don't think it's for a sports bet because people are not doing a lot of sport. I think that was, like, an illustrative example in the white paper, but there must be a better kind of use for this. And we started by looking at the Oracle, and we were quite fortunate when we started DLC link, which is sort of the parent company of DLC BTC. When we started that in October 2021, we quickly unmet Chainlink, and Chainlink actually gave us a grant to research, quote, unquote, bitcoin oracles, because we're like, cool. What is the oracle that can plug into bitcoin? And of course, Chainlink, as a market leader in oracles, you know, that that was a good kind of first step and kind of going through the process.
00:08:59.349 - 00:09:32.266, Speaker A: And there were a lot of twists and turns. But going through the process, we realized that it really does come down to the oracle. And the oracle is in our system, which, so I guess I should introduce it. We make DLC BTC a safer wrap, bitcoin. So we're enabling bitcoin to be wrapped to different chains, like Ethereum. And so if you want to wrap bitcoin to Ethereum, what's the one thing we know about you? Well, we know that you've chosen to trust Ethereum. If you don't trust Ethereum, you want to wrap the solana.
00:09:32.266 - 00:10:11.204, Speaker A: If you don't want, you know, whatever chain you want to wrap to, that should be the oracle. So the entire Ethereum blockchain should be the off chain input into the DLC. And so that's a very different type of DLC than the other teams are doing. But basically, and so kind of that was one big aha moment, and then the other big aha moment was like, okay, well, so we got Alice and Bob, but if Alice is wrapping their bitcoin to eth, who's Bob? And we're like, oh, there is no Bob. Bob should not. Only Alice should be able to get the bitcoin. And that's when we came up with the term self wrapping.
00:10:11.204 - 00:10:38.870, Speaker A: So using the DLC mechanism, Alice can lock a bitcoin with herself by moving it into a multisig, a special multisig, this DLC that can only pay out to Alice. And so Alice can be 100% sure that it's a theft proof design. Only Alice can ever get the bitcoin. But when they put the bitcoin into a locked state, that means DLC BTC, which is the ERC 20, that can be used in finance and stuff.
00:10:38.990 - 00:11:04.410, Speaker B: Yeah, there's something about this that almost reminds me a little bit of makerdao, but. So why don't you then explain, just because we do currently have something that's somewhat similar but obviously quite different, which is wrapped bitcoin that can be used in defi. So just talk a little bit about how your setup differs from wrapped bitcoin.
00:11:04.570 - 00:11:31.862, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. So this is where it gets really interesting because it's something that is a big problem for traders today. So, rap, bitcoin, WBTC was created in a collaboration with Bitgo, Ren and Kyber four years ago. It was a revolutionary invention at the time. It enabled bitcoin to be used in defi. You could invest it to earn a yield, you could do loans on it in Aave. And WBTC has been really phenomenally successful.
00:11:31.862 - 00:12:21.558, Speaker A: It's a top 15 token in crypto and it's done great. But everybody who uses WBTC, the traders who trade it, the retail, who holds it, everybody knows that it has sort of one kind of design flaw, I would say, or maybe not even flaw, but they had to. Back in the day, it was just sort of like, let's make this work. And they chose one custodian, Bitgo. And so basically the way WBTC works, it's actually a really simple system. You have a set of financial institutions called merchants. So kind of like, and maybe to give an analogy, people usually have not heard of the merchant system, but if you think of like USDC, where Silicon Valley Bank, Wells Fargo, other banks put up dollars to mint USDC and then retail can use USDC.
00:12:21.558 - 00:13:07.308, Speaker A: WBTC has the same exact system, just, they're just called merchants. The Amber group, Kobo, Falcon, X Galaxy, they go through like an onboarding process. They get whitelisted by the WBTC DAO and they also get bitgo custody accounts. And the whitelist enables them to send bitcoin to bitgo. Bitgo puts it in their vault in Nebraska or wherever, North Dakota or whatever, and they hold it there and then in return they give them this WBTC ERC 20 that can be used and then the merchants resell that token. So basically they are doing OTC. So like if you want to trade on WBTC or if you know, or if you are an exchange and you want to acquire WBTC, you have to buy it from this set of merchants.
00:13:07.308 - 00:13:39.610, Speaker A: They are distributors and that's how WBTC is produced. But meanwhile all the bitcoin is in one place at bitco. And so that, that is the, there's a couple of disadvantages of that or a couple of risks associated with that. One is of course that it's in one place which is not the scalable goal of bitcoin. There's a trillion dollars of bitcoin. Would Bitgo have a trillion in their vault? I don't know if it would scale that way. Bitgo is a us trust company.
00:13:39.610 - 00:14:14.790, Speaker A: They are subject to the laws of the us laws are, I'm not political, but the laws can change I guess based on various things that might come to pass. There's that there isn't any deposit insurance in crypto. They do have some insurance, but it's not going to pay out. Like if there's a loss event, it might not pay out all the deposits. So that bitcoin, basically it's some form of like not your keys, not your bitcoin. If Galaxy has sent their bitcoin to bitgo, then it's in Bitgo's custody. It's not in their custody.
00:14:14.790 - 00:14:45.932, Speaker A: That's a problem. Uh, because you know, if you're retail and there's a lot of, you know, and we'll talk about bridges and bitcoin, l two s and stuff. But if you have a small amount of bitcoin, you know, maybe you're not so concerned. You know, you can bridge it, you can wrap it, whatever. But if you have a large amount of bitcoin and something happens, uh, you know, it could be very serious consequences. And just you know, even systemically looking at the, the kind of ecosystem, WBTC is everywhere. It's in a lot of places.
00:14:45.932 - 00:15:34.084, Speaker A: And so if there were to, if something were to happen, it could have severe consequences for the entire industry. So that kind of gives especially larger traders pause. And so to kind of get to the point, that's what we have decentralized with DLC, BTC. Using this DLC mechanism, Alice locks with Alice. So we have the same merchants, Ambergroup Cobol, we're talking the same merchants, same financial institutions, but in our system they don't send bitcoin to us or to anyone. They lock it with themselves using this mechanism. And so they use our software to basically self rapid and then that means DRC 20 and then they can do, you know, go about their business and make money as they normally do.
00:15:34.212 - 00:16:26.406, Speaker B: All right, so in a moment we're going to talk a little bit more about how DLC BTC works. But first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible. Hey everyone. So after we recorded on August 9, Bitko announced plans to transfer control of WBTC to a joint venture with Bitglobal, a crypto custody platform that is a strategic partnership between Bitgo, Justin sun and the Tron ecosystem. This prompted Makerdao advisor BA Labs to propose that maker cut its WBTC exposure to zero in its core vaults, disable WTC borrowing and bring loan to value ratio on Sparkland down to zero. The proposal said that previous projects under sun had resulted in, quote, market deterioration in operational processes and transparency, including suspension of real time proof of reserves and several significant deep pegs caused by interruptions in redemption service. The report continues.
00:16:26.406 - 00:17:23.046, Speaker B: Quote other sun affiliated projects show worrying signs of possible misappropriation, such as ST USDT, a sun controlled RWA project that purports to hold reserve of us treasury bills but has not provided clear audits or evidence that the backing exists. When I asked Aki for his take on the drama, he said WBTC was a revolutionary invention four years ago as it enabled BTC to be used in defi unlocking major liquidity and utility. Through partnerships with Aave maker and other protocols, WBTC grew to become a top 15 token with over $10 billion in total value locked. However, WBTC has one major vulnerability. It relies on a central custodian, Bitgo. Bitco has a stellar reputation, but the lack of on chain transparency has always been a concern. Bitco is a us trust company which has made it harder for WBTC to serve as partners in Asia and elsewhere.
00:17:23.046 - 00:18:50.840, Speaker B: Mike Belshi, CEO of Bitko, has confirmed that Bit Global, a Hong Kong based public company in which sun is a major shareholder, will hold two of three keys in the multi SIG securing the bitcoin backing. Augie then quoted some of the concerns that had been called out by Ba labs about Justin sun and Tron. He goes on, quote this created a lively discussion across Twitter in the maker forum to find other bitcoin derivative projects who could fill the gap caused by a potential WBTC listing thresholds TBTC and DLC links DLC BTC showcased the advantages of their projects, and a few days later Coinbase teased CBBTC, a centralized bitcoin offering, on Twitter. He then concludes my take we believe that DLC BTC provides an ideal replacement to WBTC, as funds are held in self custody by each merchant and it does not rely on a bridge custody mechanism like TBTC, bitcoin, l two s, or other alternatives. Did you know you can buy and sell crypto with tax benefits in an individual retirement account or IRA? Itrust capital makes this possible, but what does this mean? When you buy crypto outside an IRA, like on an exchange, you face taxes on gains, but in a Roth IRA, gains would be tax free. ItrustCapital also has the lowest fees in the industry and 24/7 accessibility. Start now and maximize your retirement savings with itrust capital.

How does that multisig work? How many merchants do you have? What different chains are you on? Et cetera?
00:19:42.156 - 00:20:07.822, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, totally. And I'm glad you brought up a testers. I forgot to mention that earlier. So bitcoin cannot talk to ETH, of course. So in order to have Ethan be the oracle in the DLC, we need a way to get the signal to go from bitcoin to ETH. And so in the DLC. So usually when you launch a chain, you have node operators and you're standing up nodes and they're validators and there's all that.
00:20:07.822 - 00:20:43.630, Speaker A: But in this case, it's just bitcoin and ETH. We're not a chain, we're not adding any of that. So we don't have validators. But we do have something in the middle. We call it an attester, just for the simple reason that it's publishing what's called a DLC attestation. So basically we have 15 node operators like Hashkey cloud, Everstake, P two P, et cetera. And all they do is they run a bitcoin node and an ETH node, and then they have a small server where they just custody a bitcoin private key that's running our software.
00:20:43.630 - 00:21:22.524, Speaker A: And that private key cannot receive bitcoin, but is used for message passing. And so why 15? Well, if you only had one attester, they can't steal the bitcoin, but they could do like a ransom attack on the depositor. They could censor the unlock and refuse to unment. And so we do need to decentralize these DLC oracles or these attesters to some extent. So we have 15 of them and a threshold of ten can publish the message to either mint the LCBTC or burn it. And then the great thing about this is anyone can verify that. Anyone who runs a bitcoin and ethnode can verify it.
00:21:22.524 - 00:21:52.044, Speaker A: So in our design, we have chainlink proof of reserve wrapped around it. Basically, when the signal comes through, they do another check and they say, yep, it's, you know, that Utxo is funded on bitcoin or. Yep, I see the burn on eth. And that's right. So we can have any kind of, you know, it's a very secure system in that sense because we're not adding any chains or any kind of unproven things or any kind of moving pieces. So those are the attesters and basically, yeah. So we've got.
00:21:52.044 - 00:22:27.606, Speaker A: We're onboarding merchants, just like Bitgo system we have right now. We have one merchant fully onboarded, Amber group. And we're bringing on the next five IMC hash key Otcje talking to Cumberland. Just kind of some of the big, you know, the big trading houses. Um, we work with all kinds of financial institutions, market makers, um, you know, liquidity providers, asset managers. Really interesting for corporate treasuries because this lets them self wrap their bitcoin instead of, you know, using a custodian or a bridge. Uh, you know, they don't have to send it anywhere.
00:22:27.606 - 00:22:47.184, Speaker A: So that's quite unique. And they can also redeem it very quickly. They can, you know, if you. You can mint and burn DLC BTC in an hour, it's just six bitcoin block confirmations. It's a fully automated system, so if you see an opportunity, you can go in quick. If you, you know, the market's dumping, you can come back out quick. It's just a really, you know, simple design.
00:22:47.184 - 00:23:09.150, Speaker A: So. So we're basically setting up this new asset. We have launched on Arbitrum. We're the first native minted rapid coin on arbitrum. Previously they had custodied, bridged WBTC and they had bridged TBTC. So now you can just, Amber can native wrap to ARB. Now we're soon going to be on base.
00:23:09.150 - 00:23:26.378, Speaker A: I've also been cleared by Ripple's marketing team to tell you we're going to be on ripple. We're going to be the first wrap bitcoin on XRPL and do stuff there. So we're basically just bringing DLC BTC to any chain with Defi where bitcoiners might want to take advantage of yields there.
00:23:26.554 - 00:23:51.702, Speaker B: And so just something I have to understand about the redemption process is if you're saying that this person Alice is creating their DLC BTC, if they're trading it in deFi, then somebody else ends up with a DLC BTC who didn't originally mint that DLC BTC. So how does the redemption work if they want to obtain the bitcoin from it?
00:23:51.766 - 00:24:23.950, Speaker A: Yeah, great question. And this is why we went down the same path. And this is why retail cannot minted directly. Like a lot of the building on bitcoin stuff, you've got great chains like bit layer and whatever. You can just send your bitcoin, TBTC threshold, send your bitcoin permissionlessly, anonymously to their bridge. They lock it, they hold it in a set of nodes, and then they give you this other token or they mint this other token. That is great for retail use, I would argue.
00:24:23.950 - 00:25:02.532, Speaker A: But then you've bridged it, right? Like you're not on bitcoin security. You've sent it to either bit layers, nodes or TBTC's nodes. And there's just a finite number of nodes. I think TPTC has like 60 nodes that do the custody and 100 something nodes that do other stuff. So like bridging, that system works like retail minting works for bridging, but it does not work in this system. In this system, we rely on this federated set of merchants like the Amber group and Galaxy. And so Amber, when they're putting up their own bitcoin off their balance sheets or their clients bitcoin, they lock that bitcoin.
00:25:02.532 - 00:25:37.192, Speaker A: And that basically their goal is to ensure redemptions. So they are distributors. So let's say like, you know, Amber and Galaxy and so on, they each put 50, they self wrap 50 bitcoin each. You've got 100 bitcoin. They put it on some dexs, some centralized exchanges, retail grabs it there, retail uses, you know, maybe retail swaps, their bitcoin for DLC BTC or some other token like ETH for DLC BTC, whatever. They put it into Aave, they do a loan, it gets liquidated. Liquidator gets custody of the DLC BTC.
00:25:37.192 - 00:26:02.790, Speaker A: The liquidator can go back out through the exchanges and through amber, ultimately. So the merchants are the backers of the system, just like with WBTC or USDC. The difference is that each merchant has custody of their bitcoin versus there being another kind of layer of just having, like, bitgo. And it's basically the WBTC merchant system without a bitgo, centralized custody.
00:26:03.210 - 00:26:07.738, Speaker B: Okay, but. But each of them is acting as their own centralized custody, or.
00:26:07.914 - 00:26:24.162, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, that's right. So, like, Amber, you know, and our merchants can pick whichever. Usually they want a hardware wallet or an NPC custodian. So they self. They lock their bitcoin in, you know, the custody solution of their choice. Usually it's. It's.
00:26:24.162 - 00:26:48.440, Speaker A: It's. It's never a software wallet. It's a hardware or MPC. So they locked a bitcoin there to produce DLC BTC. And so kind of like, why might Amber do that? Why would they take whatever 50 bitcoin and lock it? There's an opportunity cost or carrying cost of that. Well, they would do it when they can make money with it. So they do OTC trades.
00:26:48.440 - 00:27:12.090, Speaker A: They do Arb, so they can arb the price on different dexes. They can mint and burn to, uh, to, you know, arb the price through minting and burning. Um, if you. If you're a protocol and you want to acquire DLC BTC, you have to pay amber their fee, their OTC fee. So that's basically the. The kind of distributor business. I'll give you a really easy example, that that kind of clicks for people.
00:27:12.090 - 00:27:24.320, Speaker A: Think of us like, we're Coca Cola. We just make syrup. You cannot, like, go to Coca Cola and. And buy the syrup. It's. You can't drink it. But Coca Cola sells syrup to different bottling companies.
00:27:24.320 - 00:27:31.060, Speaker A: They put it in bottles, they sell it to Walmart retail, gets it at Walmart. This is the same system.
00:27:31.480 - 00:27:46.048, Speaker B: Okay, so in terms of, like, the decentralization, basically, it's only more decentralized than wrapped bitcoin, in a sense that there isn't necessarily a single point of failure. Is that.
00:27:46.184 - 00:28:16.640, Speaker A: That is correct. Yeah, exactly. I would say the alternative approaches is either using a custodian, like bitgo, or using a bridge where you have different nodes, but then you're not on bitcoin security. In this case, for Amber, it's your keys, your bitcoin. For the retail holders, of course, their risk, when you're holding. When you and I are holding DLC, BTC, our risk is basically a composite of the underlying counterparty risk of all the merchants, just like USDC.
00:28:16.970 - 00:28:27.670, Speaker B: Okay. And then. So for the attesters, you said, now you're moving to a model where there's going to be 15. Do you have, like, an ideal number that you would want to have?
00:28:28.210 - 00:28:53.910, Speaker A: It's, you know, it's a great question. There wasn't. We haven't found any kind of math to substantiate this. I talked to Ethan Bachmann, who co founded Tendermint and Cosmos, and I'm like, what do you think? He's like, I don't know, 20, 115, something like there. So there's a certain number of attesters because the. Because the validator set is eth. So you have, I don't know, thousands or tens of thousands of ETH validators.
00:28:53.910 - 00:29:19.334, Speaker A: However many there are, the signal is being validated by ETH already, or arbitrum or whatever chain you're on. So we don't have to, like, stand up a new chain. It's just like how many testers reduce the possibility of a ransom attack or of collusion. Right. So if there's one attester or three attesters, let's say the three collude. Let's say. I'll give you an example.
00:29:19.334 - 00:29:35.886, Speaker A: Amber has put in self rep. 50 Bitcoin gets 50 DLC BTC. They burn it. There's only three attesters. They all collude, and they prevent the unlock. They don't send that signal to the DLC. Then Amber can't get their bitcoin back.
00:29:35.886 - 00:30:05.410, Speaker A: Then the three attesters could do a ransom attack and basically just demand a bribe. That's what we want to avoid by having 15. There's other ways to decentralize it, just standard ways. We're going to be launching, at some point, a token where the attesters are staking the DLC token and earning fees. So that gives them a financial incentive also not to collude. But, yeah, there's only so many that you need for this attestation service, basically.
00:30:06.190 - 00:30:18.466, Speaker B: Okay. And then to go back to how you were talking about how the merchants make money from this, since obviously, youre company, as you said, you are the Coca Cola selling the syrup. So how does DLC BTC make money?
00:30:18.618 - 00:31:05.244, Speaker A: Yeah. So we make mint and burn fees, just like WBTC, our fees are about 25% cheaper and thats because our cost model is cheaper. Bitgo has to maintain the vaults, they have vault fees, they have deposit insurance, theres all sorts of things they have to pay overhead, we dont have that overhead because were not a custodian. So we try to pass on the savings to our customers. And it was funny like talking to the insurers or like well is there any insurance you can get on this? And they're like yeah, but you don't have any deposits, there's nothing there to insure, which is great. That's what I want to hear in the bitcoin building on bitcoin world. So yeah that's basically we bake that in and then, so whenever there's a mint and burn action we get paid to.
00:31:05.244 - 00:31:11.632, Speaker A: And then when the distributors resell it, they get paid on that. So they bake our fees into their fees basically.
00:31:11.816 - 00:31:42.398, Speaker B: All right, and so I'm sure you're aware that now, you know, there's, I mean there's so many different kinds of things happening in the world of DeFi on Ethereum there's staking, there's restaking, and yet at the same time we have this new trend also of bitcoin L2s. So I was wondering like are all these things that we're talking about sort of on this ethereum side, will they also be available with the introduction of bitcoin L2s or how does the system work with that?
00:31:42.494 - 00:32:15.644, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah they can be. We can use DLC BTC to self wrap bitcoin to any chain, including bitcoin L2 s. So I'll put it this way, maybe before I get into the L2 side. Our approach has been to use to maximally utilize Defi Legos. We think. I think composability is the best thing about DeFi. I think the fact that in traditional finance each bank has to build their systems and maintain their systems in house and they're all kind of clunky.
00:32:15.644 - 00:33:01.232, Speaker A: I don't think that's a great. From just an engineering standpoint, I don't think that's great. I think the strength of DeFi is we can build this component that gets the bitcoin over to ETH and then people can build vaults and oracles and restaking platforms and who knows what. And then they all kind of connects. And so our approach has been, let's make the bitcoin composable through this method and go from there. And so most of our focus has, I guess I would even say our focus is on making a great experience, especially for traders. Like, they're really the super users of rapbitcoin are the traders who are, you know, looking to trade it and arbit and all that stuff.
00:33:01.232 - 00:33:16.640, Speaker A: And they want something that's cheap, fast, reliable, safe, you know, et cetera. Easy to implement. We had no regulatory, because we're not a regulated entity. We're not. We're just a software company. So that makes it easy for, for us to implement in new chains and new systems. But.
00:33:16.640 - 00:33:41.938, Speaker A: But, you know, traders just really, really want that. Now, on the building on bitcoin side, technically, we are building on bitcoin. We are implementing this DLC invention. This is a bitcoin invention. There's a lot of things that could also be done. There are other DLC teams like Atomic Finance, Shell Finance, Lava 1010, one wallet. So there are other people building other experiences with dlcs.
00:33:41.938 - 00:34:21.806, Speaker A: In our case, our actual exposure to building on bitcoin is quite limited because all we do is lock it. We do one thing, we just lock it and use it on other chains. But we are talking to bitcoin l two s, because let's say a bitcoin l two is talking to a whale or a large institution. Hey, you've got some great yield opportunities on bit layer or b squared or whatever, and take advantage of that. But let's say the whale or institution does not want to bridge it. They don't want to send their bitcoin to the set of nodes on bit layer. They could actually just self wrap it and go in via DLC BTC on bitlayer.
00:34:21.806 - 00:34:47.720, Speaker A: So we do intend to launch DLC BTC on any chain that supports DeFi. We're just going in order of the biggest ones first because there's a lot of our customers or traders are demanding eth our base op, etcetera. So we're going there first, but then as we expand to many chains. Absolutely. We will also be live on many of the bitcoin altos.
00:34:48.780 - 00:35:05.856, Speaker B: Okay. Yeah, I mean, I can see just from your blogs that you're creating a lot of new partnerships with different protocols. Are there any that you want to highlight and also at the same time, call out any kind of upcoming developments for DLC BTC?
00:35:06.008 - 00:35:43.116, Speaker A: Yeah, it's been really exciting over here because we launched an arbitrum about a month ago. I think we haven't even published a press release around that, but we're catching up on a lot of marketing. For example, we have a partner, Jasper Vault that already uses DLC BTC to do something called zero day options. So retail can speculate on whether DLC BTC will go up or down with great amounts of leverage. And they have some cool ideas around this. So anyway, you can already use it there. We're in a process to list it as collateral.
00:35:43.116 - 00:36:27.020, Speaker A: And Aave. We have a strong partnership with curve. We're partnering with symbiotic Caroc and some of the eventually Eigen layer, some of the just restaking platforms that can take, because there's sort of two ways to do restaking with this or staking. One is to take an Eth loan against DLC BTC and stake that. And the other is now, these new systems, these platforms I just mentioned are able to take the DLC BTC directly and just use the ERC 20 to secure proof of stake chains on EVM or wherever. So we're partnering with those. We're talking to eclipse, Solana, Tron, Filecoin, you name it.
00:36:27.020 - 00:37:05.390, Speaker A: There's a really, there's a really big, I think we're tracking 47 chains right now that have asked us to launch DLC BTC there. We're just trying to go through and build out each ecosystem one at a time. And we're still a small team. We're twelve people, so there's kind of a lot. And then of course bringing on the liquidity providers, the process to qualify to have IMC and Galaxy and so on, be merchants, that also takes a while. So I would say we're still in the setup phase. But one thing I can announce, or that is also documented on our blog, is our close partnership with Chainlink.
00:37:05.390 - 00:38:05.722, Speaker A: We use Chainlink CCIP bridge, and then we also use Chainlink proof of reserve. And because of the way that CCIP and por talk to each other, when we bridge to a new chain, we just have one canonical token. So there's just one DLC BTC token on each chain versus like, sometimes you see like you would see like DLcBTC e or something if we're like bringing over. So they make that simple. They also are building chainlinks, also building a price feed oracle, which is great because most of the Defi protocols want the chainlink is the predominant kind of price feed oracle provider for the aaves of the world. So they're able to build a price feed where they take the BTC USD chainlink price feed and they do a call to the proof of reserve feed. And so like, there's like some really cool defi lego stuff that we're able to do, but we're basically, like, connecting the blue chips to the other blue chips, for starters, and then building out from there.
00:38:05.722 - 00:38:32.756, Speaker A: So, yeah, and, you know, it's. It's funny. I appreciate this opportunity because half of my job is just telling people what DLCs are. You know, that's like, people are like, usually the responses are some mixture of shock and awe. They're like, wait, what? And it's been in there the whole time. How come no one's done this before? And it's just a really simple case, I think, of bitcoin. Core developers have been talking about dlcs for years.
00:38:32.756 - 00:38:50.860, Speaker A: There was a lot of excitement about it, and then when it became possible with taproot, it was amazing. And then it just takes a few years for that to diffuse out to the world. And so we're kind of in the middle of that. So half of my job is just telling people about dlcs, and then they can do the research themselves.
00:38:52.120 - 00:38:56.272, Speaker B: All right, aki, well, this has been super fascinating. Thank you so much for coming on Unchained.

00:39:47.030 - 00:40:24.700, Speaker C: Welcome to this week's crypto roundup. In today's recap, we dive into Kamala Harris's controversial economic advisors, sparking crypto industry backlash, eigenlabs, airdrop practices raising ethical concerns, and Goldman Sachs revealing significant bitcoin ETF holdings. We also cover bitcoin's record high hashrate Celsius suing tether for $2.4 billion, and three arrows Capital's liquidators pursuing terraform labs over the Luna crash. Additionally, we highlight Greyscale's new crypto fund for Makerdao's MKR and pump Fund's revenue surge despite user frustration. Thanks for tuning in to the weekly news recap. Let's begin.
00:40:24.700 - 00:41:56.850, Speaker C: Kamala Harris economic advisors stir crypto industry backlash the crypto community is reacting strongly to reports that democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris has enlisted two advisors with a history of anti crypto views. According to Bloomberg, Harris has tapped Brian Deese and Bharat Ramamurti, both former aides to President Biden, to shape her economic policy. Disse, who previously led the National Economic Council, co authored a White House blog advocating for stricter regulation of cryptocurrencies. Ramamurti, who served as the National Economic Council deputy director under Deese, has ties to Senator Elizabeth Warren, a vocal critic of the crypto industry. The news has sparked criticism from crypto advocates who fear Harris's campaign will continue the Biden administration's tough stance on digital assets. In this week's episode of Bits and BiPs, asymmetric founder Joe McCann said he doesn't see a crypto reset happening under Harris, observing that if they were going to reset, wouldn't they have pumped the brakes by now? Controversy over EigenLab's Airdrop practices coindesk reported on Thursday that Eigen Labs, the company behind the Ethereum restaking platform Eigenlayer, circulated a list of employee wallet addresses to various ecosystem projects preparing to launch tokens. While some teams requested the list in order to thank Eigen Labs employees, at least one project said Aigen Labs sent the list without them asking for it and that they felt pressure to send tokens to Eigens employees.
00:41:56.850 - 00:42:57.390, Speaker C: Eigen labs employees reportedly received nearly $5 million in tokens at peak prices, sparking criticism over potential ethical lapses. In response, Eigen Labs and its associated Eigen foundation have since banned such payouts to employees to avoid any appearance of bias. The company stated that the restrictions were implemented to maintain trust and transparency within the ecosystem and emphasized that the payouts were initially meant to foster collaboration among projects. Goldman Sachs reveals 418 million in bitcoin ETF Holdings Goldman Sachs has disclosed significant investments in bitcoin related exchange traded funds for the first time. According to the bank's latest quarterly 13 f filing, Goldman holds $238.6 million in BlackRock's iShares bitcoin trust, comprising almost 7 million shares. Additional holdings include $79 million in Fidelity's bitcoin ETF and $35 million in the grayscale bitcoin trust.
00:42:57.390 - 00:44:01.144, Speaker C: Goldman's bitcoin positions reflect a growing trend of institutional adoption in the crypto space. Other banking giants also disclosed their crypto positions. According to its latest 13 f filing, Morgan Stanley had a $187 million stake in BlackRock spot bitcoin ETF as of the end of Q two while nearly selling off its position in Grayscale's GBTC. Also this week, the state of Wisconsin investment Board said it had increased its holdings in BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF to nearly 2.9 million shares, worth $98 million, while selling off its entire position in the Grayscale bitcoin trust. Moreover, DRW Venture Capital disclosed holdings of nearly $200 million in crypto ETF's, with a sizable $150 million of that invested in the Grayscale Ethereum trust. Bitcoin hashrate reaches record high on Monday, bitcoin's hashrate surged to an all time high of 627 exahashes per second, reflecting increased competition among miners.
00:44:01.144 - 00:44:49.528, Speaker C: Meanwhile, on chain data from cryptoquant revealed that miner reserves have dropped to 1.8 million BTC, the lowest level since January 2021. The decline comes as miners, who typically sell their holdings during price surges, face a volatile market. The price of bitcoin reached a record high of $73,750 on March 14, 2024, but it has since dropped roughly 19%. The increased hash rate has also contributed to a six month low in minor profitability, according to industry reports. Celsius sues Tether for 2.4 billion bankrupt crypto lender Celsius has filed a lawsuit against Tether seeking to reclaim 39,542 bitcoin valued at approximately $2.4
00:44:49.528 - 00:45:44.622, Speaker C: billion. Celsius alleges that tether improperly liquidated the collateral during Celsius's financial turmoil in June 2022. The lender argues that tether's actions violated their agreement and exacerbated its financial collapse by selling the bitcoin at below market prices. The lawsuit is part of a broader legal strategy by Celsius to recover funds for its creditors. The company has also targeted Badgerdao, compound labs and Bancor Dow in separate lawsuits. The suit against Badgerdao stems from a 2021 hack that led to substantial losses for Celsius, while compound labs is being sued for an oracle related incident that triggered mass liquidations in 2020. Bancor Dow, which is partially owned by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's relatives, is accused of mismanaging its impermanent loss protection mechanism, causing significant financial damage to Celsius.
00:45:44.622 - 00:46:55.384, Speaker C: Tether has dismissed the allegations, calling the lawsuit a baseless shakedown and asserting that it acted within the contract's terms by liquidating Celsius's collateral. Tether also reassured its stakeholders that its $12 billion in equity ensures no impact on token holders, regardless of the lawsuit's outcome three arrows liquidators sue terraform labs for 1.3 billion over Lunacrash liquidators of the defunct cryptocurrency hedge fund three arrows Capital are seeking to recover $1.3 billion from terraform Labs, the company behind the collapsed Terrausd and Luna tokens. The lawsuit claims Terraform induced three AC to invest heavily in Luna and Terrausd by manipulating the market and inflating their prices before they plummeted in May 2022, causing massive losses. The crash led to three ACS bankruptcy, with the value of its Luna holdings dropping from $462 million in April 2022 to just $2,700 by mid May. Terraform Labs, which filed for bankruptcy earlier this year, and its co founder Do Kwon, who faces fraud charges, are central to the ongoing legal battle.
00:46:55.384 - 00:47:45.400, Speaker C: Recovery prospects from Terraform remain uncertainty. Grayscale launches crypto fund for Makerdao's MKR Greyscale has introduced a new single asset fund dedicated to Makerdao's governance, token MKR. The fund, which is accessible to accredited investors, marks Grayscale's latest move to expand its product lineup. The launch follows the recent introduction of similar funds for bitten source Tao and Sui tokens, as well as a decentralized, AI focused fund. MKR surged by over 7% following the announcement. Grayscale has been on a roll, launching five different single token trusts in the past three months. Pumpdot funds fee removal boosts revenue but draws ire of users pump Fun, a Solana based token generator, has hit a new milestone by raking in $5.3
00:47:45.400 - 00:48:41.736, Speaker C: million in daily fees, surpassing many other platforms, including major blockchains such as Ethereum, Tron and Solana itself. The surge in fees follows Pumpdot Fund's recent decision to eliminate its $2 token creation fee, shifting the cost to the first buyer of each token. This change led to an explosion in token creation, with over 10,000 tokens minted in just 3 hours. While the platform's revenue soared, user satisfaction plummeted. Many expressed frustration on social media, criticizing the rapid creation of tokens that often lose value almost immediately, one user commented, nobody is entertained but your team and your pockets, highlighting the growing discontent among the platform's user base. Despite its financial success, pump fun faces increasing criticism for prioritizing profits over user experience. Time for fun bits oops.
00:48:41.736 - 00:49:27.714, Speaker C: Ethereum user pays $88,000 for a simple transaction in a jaw dropping blunder, an Ethereum user paid $88,000 in gas fees to send a mere $2,200 worth of ETH this apparent fat finger mistake has left the crypto community both laughing and cringing. Blockchain security firm Peckshield caught the slip up, proving that even in the world of high tech finance, a simple keyboard slip can cost you more than just your pride, like, say, 40 times more. Moral of the story? Always triple check before you hit send. And that's all. Thanks so much for joining us today.
