00:00:00.600 - 00:00:20.929, Speaker A: Sign up for gemini and earn $15 with the code UNCHAINED15 going into election. I'll trade SOL. It's a high beta bitcoin, right? So I want the whippy action. It's liquid and I know that it's going to pump. If bitcoin does well, then I want to trade Sol. I don't want to trade eth. It's too slow right now for these cash flow things that matter.
00:00:20.929 - 00:00:45.441, Speaker A: It's going to take months and sort of a narrative shift in terms of people's mindset about what ETH is right now. Eth is slow old boring. You know, Vitalik's trying to become a social media influencer right now, which he's never tried to do because everyone's like, oh, my God, Eth is so fucking boring. Vitalik, get on social media and make it interesting again, right? I don't want to trade that. Solana's got the mindshare. It moves. It's high beta bitcoin.
00:00:45.441 - 00:00:57.065, Speaker A: And so. And I actually put on some small positions. Bitcoin broke out. Okay, I'm not going to buy bitcoin. Let me buy Sol. Because when the market rotates, then it's going to outperform.
