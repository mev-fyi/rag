00:00:00.170 - 00:00:16.350, Speaker A: One of the kind of the things people are worried about with images being put on bitcoin, how it can really slow down or prevent other people from sending monetary transactions on bitcoin. But we're showing that with efficient coding, you can actually have the best of both worlds.

00:01:54.458 - 00:01:55.714, Speaker B: Welcome, Danny and Bill.
00:01:55.832 - 00:01:57.346, Speaker A: Hey, Laura, great to be here.
00:01:57.448 - 00:01:59.858, Speaker D: Thank you, Laura. Honored to be here again.
00:02:00.024 - 00:02:03.250, Speaker C: Bill, you were my third guest, if I remember correctly.
00:02:03.750 - 00:02:04.354, Speaker D: Yes.
00:02:04.472 - 00:02:05.490, Speaker C: Pleasure to have you back.
00:02:05.560 - 00:02:09.430, Speaker D: It's the start of the industry, kind of at the necker blockchain summit.
00:02:09.930 - 00:02:10.502, Speaker B: I know.
00:02:10.556 - 00:02:37.274, Speaker C: I can't believe that was over seven years ago now. But anyway, so part of the reason that I brought you to here was to discuss some recent issues, you could call them in the bitcoin ordinals world, and it affects you as creators. But first, why don't we give everybody the backdrop of what you've been doing, and we'll start with your backgrounds, pre metagood. So, Danny, would you like to start?
00:02:37.472 - 00:02:45.898, Speaker A: Yeah. So I'm Danny Yang. Premedigood. I started the Stanford bitcoin meetup back in 2013. That's when I met Bill, actually. So that's how we connected.
00:02:46.074 - 00:02:47.310, Speaker C: True OG.
00:02:48.310 - 00:03:23.354, Speaker A: Yeah. Early days of bitcoin when we were all very, I guess, excited by what we could do. And the sky's, the, you know, bitcoin was kind of the center of attention for everything. It was really the only thing. And I started a cryptocurrency exchange in Taiwan called MyCoin that's doing well today, too. And then a couple years later, I started a blockchain analytics company called Blocks here that was then sold a few years after that. And Bill also was the first investor in both of those two Bitcoin and crypto companies.
00:03:23.354 - 00:03:35.540, Speaker A: So been busy in this space and just excited to see what's happening today, too. We're going to talk about because of the new happenings for Bitcoin in particular.
00:03:35.990 - 00:03:36.834, Speaker C: And Bill.
00:03:36.952 - 00:03:37.186, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:03:37.208 - 00:05:05.486, Speaker D: And Laura, I think obviously you've known me for quite a while, but I somehow was able to see some kind of interesting future for Bitcoin back in 2010 that led me to doing some work on a bunch of different things. Some of the more notable companies that came out of the industry at that time were Bitfury, of course, where I put together the funding for their first major ASIC chip, still chairman of the board of HUD Eight Mining, which we spun out of Bitfury. It used to be our Canadian operation and had funded a bunch of interesting projects like AirSwap with Joe Lubin and Mike Novogratz and Power Ledger and some other things. But Danny, having been the founder of the Stanford Bitcoin Meetup group, and Laura, you will remember, even back on Necker Island, what I wanted to do was create something like the Homebrew computer club for this segment. And Danny had already done, you know, as I was attending the Stanford Bitcoin Meetup groups, young startups like Zappo or BitGo or Coinbase or whoever would come and present at his meetup. And I just identified Danny as a node with a lot of talent, given his PhD in computer science at Stanford, and every question that I had that was technical, he could answer. And so one day I walked up to him and I said, hey, if you ever start a company, I'm writing a check.
00:05:05.486 - 00:05:30.386, Speaker D: And that became the first company he mentioned and I funded it along with some real OGS like Charlie Lee, Bobby Lee, Jed McCaleb, people like that. And then that turned into another funding for Blockseer. Both of those companies have been successful. And third time around I was like, Danny, let's do this one together. So I wrote a check and we put together Metagood.
00:05:30.578 - 00:05:46.186, Speaker C: Yeah. And I just want to urge listeners, if you have not heard the third episode of Unchained with Bill, you definitely should go back and listen to it. Bill, am I remembering correctly? I think your days in the tech industry started in the 1980s. Maybe.
00:05:46.288 - 00:05:48.266, Speaker D: Yes. I'm very old.
00:05:48.448 - 00:06:31.130, Speaker C: Yes, well, you and I are not that far apart in age, so I wouldn't say you're old. However, I remember that just listening to it, I felt like I was getting a master class in how Internet technology had developed through the decades. So for listeners who are sort of interested in how technology developed pre crypto and how we got to this point where blockchains were even possible, I suggest that episode. I still remember being like, whoa, I feel like I'm learning so much and I just loved it. So, as you mentioned, you guys had known each other, you invest in these companies. So what was the idea behind Metagood and how did you come up with it?
00:06:31.280 - 00:06:46.126, Speaker A: It's around how NFTs and Tokens are actually a very powerful tool in particular for aligning communities around a common goal, common cause. So that was the idea for yeah.
00:06:46.148 - 00:07:42.138, Speaker D: So let me amplify that a you know, obviously given that crypto and bitcoin in know when it started, it's a decentralized thing that allows economic alignment of interest across communities of interest. And of course the beginnings were all about technology. Then it moved into kind of this financial sort of phase which frankly, I'm not that interested in all the speculative crap. That just wasn't for me. And I was always more interested in the technology and applications for social good. And one of the things that we thought we could do with Metagood was align interest around just getting people to collaborate on missions that made sense and were important for the world. And Laura, you might remember our little Hanu kitty that Richard Branson helped us launch.
00:07:42.138 - 00:07:58.494, Speaker D: So we did a little experiment many years ago to create the very first NFT. I don't even know if they were called NFTs then, but it was a digital asset. That when I had put up some of the early money for Dapper Labs CryptoKitties.
00:07:58.542 - 00:07:59.638, Speaker A: If you go all the way back.
00:07:59.644 - 00:09:07.818, Speaker D: To CryptoKitties, I was funding CryptoKitties and I told Roham at the said, hey Roham, you know, it's very fun to spin digital cats around an exchange, but I want this to have some purpose. So I will write a check if you will do a favor for me, which is create me a special edition CryptoKitty that I can auction off at an ocean conservation gala that I'm doing in about three months. So that gave birth to something called Hanukkitty, which was a CryptoKitty with a shell. And we sold that, gave the money to Captain Paul Watson and got him to park his ship in front of the turtle nesting area off the island of Antigua and protect the turtles by having people walk the beaches. So it was kind of the first ocean conservation NFT sold for a substantial amount and it was also one of the first things that really tied the use case of aligning communities to doing something in the real world that had purpose. So that was the story around why we wanted to try to do something with a broader set of people, make it more lower friction, more replicable and scalable. And we have done that and I'll let Danny take it from there.
00:09:07.818 - 00:09:09.900, Speaker D: Following your next set of questions.
00:09:10.290 - 00:10:15.378, Speaker C: Well, one comment that I wanted to make about that kitty was just that I remember generally because you have your handle on Twitter kitevc, and you're really into kite surfing and just general water things. And I remember thinking, oh, this is really interesting, because this is a way of just saying, hey, I have this interest in the real world, and I feel like I can use this technology in a way to kind of spread awareness and generate interest and actually raise the funds to further my own mission with that. So I just feel like there are a lot of things there around how blockchain communities generally think about they tend to have specific goals or values or whatever. And this is, I think, one of the early instances of somebody doing something like that. So back to Metagood. Danny, did you want to add more on the story of how it came together and what the mission is?
00:10:15.544 - 00:10:28.280, Speaker A: Yeah. So we are building the platforms for actually doing this with NFTs and ended up launching our own community first on Chain Monkey. And that's what we've been focused on the last two.
00:10:33.050 - 00:11:51.866, Speaker D: I'll just highlight one of the things that Danny's been able to accomplish by launching and he should talk about the technology and the firsts that the company achieved by putting things on chain in the beginning instead of just like JPEGs that were digitized and stuck on a server somewhere. He's done some incredibly interesting work putting things on chain generated from the blocks and he can go into more detail on that. But one of the results of the community action as these items have traded exchange hands, whatever, a portion of that went into a pool. And so now there's a you know, obviously you've done a lot of work on Dows, Laura, and I think Dows are basically a community currency or community's way to accrue and exchange value. And we had managed to generate an incredibly for a small, tiny capitalized startup. We generated a lot of capital in a Dow that has gone on to do real world things, including, for example, the evacuation of Afghan girl Sharbat Gula. When the US pulled out, somebody had to pay for that paramilitary operation to get her family out of Afghanistan to Italy and that was funded by our Dow.
00:11:51.866 - 00:12:59.178, Speaker D: And now the community, I'm sorry, Afghan girl who is a there's a very famous National Geographic cover shot of a beautiful young lady with the staring green eyes that became a western icon. And when the US pulled out of Afghanistan, her and her entire family were at a woman. There is a woman named Sophia Swire who quarterbacked an effort with the Consulate of Italy to find a path for her to be evacuated. But it needed funding and our community got behind it and fueled that whole operation. That's just one example of many things that the Dow went on to fund. We've managed to rehabilitate skate parks in Brazil and just lots of other things that give communities places and spaces for their members to actually live in the real world where those skate parks, for example, were destroyed by floods. So we restored spaces for them and now the Dow.
00:12:59.178 - 00:13:38.018, Speaker D: It's quite well established and it has a lot more purpose that aligns with the company itself, where the Dao funds are actually fueling the development of the protocols that are aligning Ordinals with the innovations that Danny's created. Danny's work, by the way, if you look at the Ordinals GitHub, or GitHub, the top several items are all contributions from him. So he's pushing forward many of the things that make Ordinals productive and useful in the real world. And I hit too many points there, so I should stop and let you dissect those.
00:13:38.184 - 00:14:00.518, Speaker C: Yeah, we'll go back to just talk a little bit about on chain monkey. For those who haven't seen, they're very kind of simplified monkey images. I guess, like half of the torso and then up, and it's just like a circle and then two little arcs for ears.
00:14:00.694 - 00:14:09.690, Speaker D: Generative AI art before AI suddenly became this giant buzzword two years ago. We did this before that wave.
00:14:11.710 - 00:14:47.526, Speaker A: The thing about or actually on chain art too, so it's called on chain monkey for a reason. And I think the new term that we've been using is called digital artifact, which is actually let me define what that is, because that's kind of what we were trying to achieve then. We didn't have a name for it, but that's what we achieved back then on ethereum. But now we have a new protocol on bitcoin for digital artifacts, and you can say it's a subclass of NFTs. So a digital artifact is something, well, first, that's ownable that's kind of a given for NFTs and tokens that we're talking about. Although digital ownership is something that's interesting to talk about too. We can talk about that later.
00:14:47.526 - 00:15:30.758, Speaker A: But then there are a few other, basically five properties in total that this is also what Casey Rotemer defined clearly when he defined the oral's protocol as a protocol for digital artifacts. So ownable complete, uncensored immutable and permissionless. So I'll quickly go over what each one of those means. So complete means that the asset itself is completely on chain or represented on chain. So that's actually a big difference from the NFT protocol we're generally familiar with, which is the one on Ethereum and EVMs, which is the ERC 721 protocol for NFTs. So that's one tied to digital certificates. Basically, NFT is something that has a unique Identifier, a certificate or an ID.
00:15:30.758 - 00:15:40.202, Speaker A: And that ID can be basically a link, like IPFS link, or it could be just a standard, like a.com URL link.
00:15:40.256 - 00:15:40.666, Speaker B: Right?
00:15:40.768 - 00:16:16.514, Speaker A: That's the protocol that developed after crypto punks and CryptoKitties. Then the Ethereum community formed. This basically a very broad and simple NFT protocol right around digital certificates, because you're trading unique Identifiers on ethereum blockchain, and that went on for many years. The on chain NFT community kind of formed a little later, and on chain monkey was one of them too, which we wanted more than just a certificate or pointer. We want the actual digital asset to be represented completely on chain. So that's completeness. The second is uncensorable.
00:16:16.514 - 00:16:58.946, Speaker A: I mean, that's kind of a given property of bitcoin and many of these open permission lists. So uncensored, immutable and permissionless, those are other three properties that you have with basically with this particular protocol, or nose. Those also may or may not be true for all NFTs or for let's say, ERC, 721 NFTs. So these are the kind of five kind of significant properties of a digital artifact that we achieved back on Ethereum. But now that we have a new protocol, we're doing it on or Node because it's created around these properties and.
00:16:58.968 - 00:17:33.950, Speaker D: Just to touch on the image as you described it. Laura. So rather than a drawing per se that is stuck on a server that a pointer goes to with like most NFTs, danny basically wrote a math expression with a data table where algorithmically, every one of those things is generated on the, you know, it's truly, truly on chain. So to all the elements that he described those five properties, it's coming off that block. So it's much more true to the spirit of decentralized assets.
00:17:34.610 - 00:18:09.430, Speaker A: Exactly. That's a part of the generative art side of things. In particular, when I launched on chain Monkey in 2021, ethereum and Blockchains and Bitcoin, they're a public good. And also anything that you write onto the chain costs quite a lot of money, or rather you use it up and someone else cannot use it. So you have to pay for that usage. And to actually put 10,000 images onto the blockchain is very expensive. So you can actually write code that generates the images, which is much more compact.
00:18:09.430 - 00:19:08.726, Speaker A: Actually, part of the art of the original art of Onchain Monkey back in 2021 on Ethereum was that this whole collection of 10,000 had to be an interesting collection of 10,000 images. So it's not just kind of random monkey images, but there's kind of interesting distribution across the whole collection and done in a very compact representation on Ethereum. In this case, it was done in one transaction, which is kind of also showing kind of the whole thing was birthed in one kind of atomic transaction, one transaction. And that was a challenge because within one transaction there's a certain limit to how much you can do in a given Ethereum transaction. So that was kind of the unique list, first of just doing a whole collection that's on chain with these properties of digital artifact in one transaction. And that was also what we achieved when we did it on bitcoin early this year. So we actually created the whole ten K collection of Onchain monkey, on bitcoin.
00:19:08.726 - 00:19:52.090, Speaker A: So all these 10,000 images and metadata describing them in a single inscription, that only also took up very few bytes of bitcoin's block space. So it used less than 20 bitcoin block space for 10,000 images. So that on average is less than two bytes per image, which is super efficient on Bitcoin, so it doesn't affect the network. The Bitcoin network, that's one of the kind of the things people are worried about with images being put on Bitcoin, how it can really slow down or prevent other people from sending monetary transactions on Bitcoin. But we're showing that with efficient coding, you can actually have the best of both worlds.
00:19:52.430 - 00:21:00.682, Speaker C: Yeah, and I just want to point out for listeners who aren't aware, I'm going to describe this the way that I know it works on ethereum, and then you could translate for Bitcoin, but on Ethereum, I'm sure you're aware you have to pay gas. And so it's somewhat similar to driving a car where certain transactions take less gas, meaning a simple transaction would be similar to, I here in new York city. Want to go across to jersey city or something that's like a short distance, whereas it would cost more gas if I want to go to Philadelphia. Even more gas if I want to go to DC. And so creating an NFT takes a lot of gas because you're making a unique object. And so the fact that you were able to do 10,000 of them in a single transaction, I think is what you were talking about there, about how that was remarkably efficient. And then one other thing that I wanted to mention about on Chain Monkey was you also introduced this concept of give to earn that I think aligns pretty well with the mission of the collection.
00:21:00.682 - 00:21:02.750, Speaker C: So can you just talk about that concept?
00:21:03.250 - 00:21:21.750, Speaker A: Yeah. So we have a community currency called the banana. That the only way to receive it. Or you can say to mine it is. You give it to someone else and then you get one yourself. And you can do that a couple of times a day. And that's been going on for nearly two years now.
00:21:21.750 - 00:21:53.234, Speaker A: And I think probably about just over a million bananas have been mined in this way. And basically our community has been doing this. We also define a set of values from our community from beginning when we launched it, Rise, that our community kind of shares on a daily basis, too, which stand for respect, integrity, sustainability and enrichment. So both the give to earn and the rise values are kind of the core part of our community. On Chainmonkey and Laura, what we wanted.
00:21:53.272 - 00:22:30.002, Speaker D: To model were kind of very basic economic principles. So if you think about a group of people as they exchange items, you grow the economy. So we wanted to steer our economy in a way that was for public benefit, in a way. So as people do good things for each other and give things to each other, they also earn. So it's sort of creative little bits of karma that spawn other bits of karma as currency that become giant economic value. That's what we are driving.
00:22:30.166 - 00:23:09.594, Speaker C: Yeah, it's so funny, right? When you started that description, I was like, oh, like karma. Anyway, okay, so we've sort of hinted at this, but obviously, as you mentioned, you guys started on ethereum and then you began also putting parts of your works on bitcoin, in particular collection called on chain monkey dimensions 300. Talk about why it is that you started on ethereum and why you eventually decided to launch something on bitcoin. And we'll get later to your even bigger news about eventually moving everything over there. But let's just start with that first step.
00:23:09.792 - 00:23:48.786, Speaker A: Yeah, so it's because oral's protocol happened also at the right time, where the markets understand NFTs a little better. And we've seen NFT ecosystem develop on Ethereum, solana and other chains. Yet bitcoin didn't really have much of a NFT market. And then this protocol, orange protocol basically happened along. And it's actually a very simple and elegant protocol that takes advantage of many properties of bitcoin, particularly the UTXO model of bitcoin. That's core of the oros protocol, unspent.
00:23:48.818 - 00:23:53.058, Speaker C: Transaction output, which is like the change from every transaction.
00:23:53.234 - 00:24:32.814, Speaker A: Yeah, which is very different from ethereum. And account like the account based model of ethereum. Account based model is more, I guess, intuitive for people generally. It's like your bank account. Well, bitcoin's ledger is tied around this UTXO model. So bitcoin has this very simple scripting language, simple by design. Bitcoin has these great properties, but because it doesn't have the smart contract that ethereum EVMs have, it's been difficult to create kind of a native bitcoin non fungible asset on bitcoin and that's know, Casey was able to do with the Orna's protocol.
00:24:32.814 - 00:25:25.910, Speaker A: So it's actually quite bitcoin native using the same ledger accounting model of bitcoin, which is the UTXO model. So this is a really powerful thing so that anyone defined any basic digital asset on bitcoin. So that digital asset or that digital artifact has those properties I mentioned before, which is those five properties that people can basically own and trade them. So that happened basically end of last year, early this year, but it was still in the very even today, it's still in the very early days of that particular implementation of the protocol and even the definition of program. And that's why we have we'll talk about this inscription number debate that's been going on the last week or so. It's mainly around basically how early it is. But we recognize that this was something pretty significant for bitcoin.
00:25:25.910 - 00:26:28.342, Speaker A: It is basically the winning NFT protocol or standard on bitcoin. And it'll be quite important leading to and post the next having for bitcoin. And we're already seeing that with the majority of bitcoin transactions this year has been bitcoin or nodes related. And a lot of the mining fees that are going to the miners who secure the bitcoin network are coming from bitcoin oral transactions, it's already having an impact. While it's still quite an early market where actually many people don't quite understand the protocol yet and haven't really dug into seeing kind of the significance and what you could do with it. And so I think we're talking about OCM dimensions. That was one thing that we launched, that we wanted to show what you could do with this protocol, because it's more than I think people in general think of entities as basically a digital certificate.
00:26:28.342 - 00:27:35.722, Speaker A: So you just needed to find some unique Identifier, and that's your NFT while with the Ornos protocol, because it's not tied around the data of a certificate, it's actually tied around the complete asset itself. Then what is that asset? What could you do with it? And initially, what people did with it was just, well, we can basically make images onto bitcoin. And that is actually, as we talked about earlier, can be very expensive when you want to. Images are basically larger file size, type of data assets. And if you want to just do that on bitcoin, it's going to be expensive and inefficient. So with the OCM dimensions, we were showing, well, wait a second, we can actually write code that generates images or other things even beyond images. And so it's an artifact that's based off of code that generates actually 3D renderings of in this case, it's a statue of OCM, the Genesis monkeys.
00:27:35.722 - 00:28:03.474, Speaker A: So it's actually 3D rendering of an animated and it's actually pretty cool in high resolution because it actually scales we're actually rendering them from the data on bitcoin into any browser. So it scales to the size of the display a bunch of cool properties of what you could do with this protocol. And so that was the art of this particular collection.
00:28:03.602 - 00:28:26.190, Speaker C: And a couple of questions. So for Ordinals, I believe that I don't know if they have quite the same level of expressibility as Ethereum NFTs. Correct me if I'm wrong. The way that Ethereum NFTs can be, for instance, like a domain name or tickets or other things besides.
00:28:28.130 - 00:28:59.050, Speaker A: You mean the use cases of NFTs because actually the expressibility of Ethereum Teas is really a unique identifier, and then you identifier and then can point to whatever you want, right? The design for Ornos is around, as I said, the digital artifact. So what you want to create is actually what you can describe some bits and bytes on bitcoin.
00:28:59.870 - 00:29:03.820, Speaker C: Would that include something like a blockchain domain name?
00:29:05.390 - 00:29:59.178, Speaker A: Because it's actually tied around basically just data. This is a kind of powerful thing where people are because it's just data on bitcoin that has these properties. You can make that data mean whatever you want. So you could even just say, well, this data is the same as the Ethereum Identifier for NFTs, so it could potentially represent all those things. But what people are doing with it is actually they're defining their own new protocols. On top of the Ornos protocol, we're saying, well, this data that I'm writing has these meanings, and I'll use it to do something else. So that's actually one of the really cool things about or notes, is that people are launching additional protocols on bitcoin using this new protocol because data layer, right? It's a data layer for anything else that you want to develop.
00:29:59.344 - 00:30:53.022, Speaker D: I'll throw one word out there for Danny, which is a foundational data layer. So if you think about bitcoin, in the, quote, old days when we did that first podcast seven years ago, it was kind of a store of value. And then during the speculative phases, it became a risk asset, but there was a big gap in between where there was not any real perceived utility for it other than storing or speculating. And that giant gap was filled by Ethereum and the many other chains that emerged. All of those there's many of them. But what Ordinals does is it creates this foundational layer that allows the data to represent whatever you want it to represent. And it introduces the capability for developers to fill that gap with the bitcoin blockchain, which is, as everybody knows, the most robust old guard chain out there.
00:30:53.022 - 00:31:05.822, Speaker D: So it's kind of just finally filling that gap. That allows a whole ecosystem and sets of economies to be built on the original chain.
00:31:05.966 - 00:31:35.660, Speaker C: Yeah, I guess just from what you're describing, it almost sounds like what you're saying is that it allows for more ethereum like capabilities that then the way ethereum has multiple DeFi protocols built on it would allow. Okay, all right, well, super fascinating. So we're going to discuss more about that, more about bitcoin ordinals generally and also why you guys decided to move your entire collection over from Ethereum to bitcoin.

00:33:55.586 - 00:34:17.230, Speaker C: Today, back to my conversation with Danny and Bill. So, as we mentioned, you're now going to be shifting your entire metagood NFT collection from Ethereum to bitcoin. Why did you decide to make that shift? Why not just keep the original where it know, have your dimensions over on Ordinals? Why cause such a disruption?
00:34:17.810 - 00:35:13.214, Speaker A: Yeah, we see it as kind of the natural shift. Ordinal's protocol is something that's quite significant for bitcoin and for crypto overall. So it makes sense for us to make this move and also kind of to lead the way and show that this is something that is worth other communities and people using. So we're bringing our communities to bitcoin Ornos, and we also inscribed so OCM dimensions was that high definition 3D art, but OCM genesis is our original. The SVG 2D images that we launched two years ago on Ethereum and also on bitcoin. As I mentioned, we were first also show you could do that in a very efficient way on bitcoin. And we inscribed ten k of these Monkey images back in early February.
00:35:13.214 - 00:35:35.910, Speaker A: So now we've been waiting to basically distribute them also in this new way called parent child collection province, so that everyone who owns the Ethereum One can basically upgrade to the bitcoin or no. And that's happening around the next few weeks. We should start that migration.
00:35:39.390 - 00:35:48.342, Speaker C: But what was the reason why you thought instead of just, we'll have one on Ethereum, one on bitcoin, why move everything over to bitcoin?
00:35:48.406 - 00:36:15.722, Speaker A: Yeah, for what we're doing it's around, basically, the protocol is a better fit. So protocol around digital artifacts is a better fit than one around digital certificates, because we were or notes didn't exist when we launched in 2021. So if it had existed, we would have launched directly on bitcoin. This is the protocol for digital artifacts. So also that's why we're moving now, because now this exists and it makes sense for onchain Monkey, our collection.
00:36:15.886 - 00:36:47.930, Speaker C: Okay, now let's just talk a little bit about what's going on in Ordinals these days, because creator Casey Rotimore made a proposal last week that was somewhat surprising. And as you described, there's this way of numbering each of the ordinals because of the numbering of the satoshis in the whole bitcoin blockchain. But he proposed deprioritizing that system, so why did he do this? Like, what problem is he trying to solve?
00:36:48.090 - 00:37:13.510, Speaker A: Yeah, so let's go back to the Ornos protocol. I describe it in basically there's three parts to the Ornos protocol. Part one is the satoshis or orno theory itself, which is how you identify bitcoin. Or satoshis are the smallest unit of a bitcoin. So or no theory is identifying or numbering them in order. And there's actually no dispute about this. That's very clear.
00:37:13.510 - 00:38:07.602, Speaker A: In fact, this original idea was first publicly proposed by Charlie Lee back more than ten years ago in bitcoin talk, like how you could basically number UTXOs and satoshis within the bitcoin graph so that you could do some things with it by this first in, first out method, basically, or no theory. So that's kind of long established and independently, people had these ideas. The second part is around the description. So that is new. That is basically the ability to write data onto bitcoin. That part how you define the inscription to be included or the data that someone writes to be valid or included in this protocol that has been evolving over the last year. So that's where actually this debate, actually, that's the source of this debate.
00:38:07.602 - 00:38:49.174, Speaker A: The third part is how do you map the inscription to the satoshi or the ordinal? So that actually is very important because that's the assignment of ownership of the inscription. So these are basically the three parts that define or no protocol. Basically. Part one is just what the heck is an ornamental. Part two is what the heck is an inscription? And part three is how do you assign the ownership of inscriptions to or notes, because or notes are a thing that you can own because or notes are bitcoin. Right? So bitcoin is a ledger of bitcoin. Okay? So it's the second point that has been causing, I guess, the most debate, because the definition of an inscription is still getting finalized and it should be final kind of by the 1.0
00:38:49.174 - 00:39:34.194, Speaker A: release. We're at the 0.9 release of the Ornos protocol implementation. So I think during this last year, we're figuring out, in fact, now we're quite close to kind of pretty much the definition of an inscription, that everyone can be happy going forward. So the issue is, because the definition of an inscription has changed slightly over the last year, then you have some inscriptions that were not recognized or recognized at different points in time, and so people had already numbered them. So this is then based on the off chain indexing of all inscriptions. So we mentioned earlier, inscriptions are kind of immutable, right? And that's still true.
00:39:34.194 - 00:40:22.366, Speaker A: The inscription itself is the data that you write on bitcoin. It's immutable, and the sequence of them is also locked in by the bitcoin ledger or bitcoin blockchain. Itself tells you you can look up the inscription to see how they're ordered. The issue is that when they came out, whenever they did at the time when they were recognized by the protocol, the display or the indexers that showed the inscriptions to people on the website, or NOTES.COM in particular, is the main one that people go to. There was basically a numbering of them that was layered on top of the on chain data. And that number is the inscription number that is basically that people are debating because the number basically they numbered them sequentially by the indexer.
00:40:22.366 - 00:41:02.874, Speaker A: And so someone, let's say, bought the number 1000, right, inscription number 1000. And the value and the attachment to that inscription was actually more the number than the actual data of the inscription. And so people were trading and assigning value to that inscription because of the number. Right. And later on when the inscription, what the definition of inscription was a little broader. There might have been a couple other inscriptions that actually on chain were earlier than that 1000 inscription number 1000. So if you count them through, then the inscription 1000 becomes, let's say, 1010.
00:41:02.874 - 00:42:14.710, Speaker A: And that number has changed because a lot of value is tied in the number for the early ones. Obviously the people who own them are upset or worried that affects the value of their ordinary inscription. That's what we're kind of debating. In the long term, it's actually not a big deal, but in the short term it's nice to see the community, the whole Ordinal community now in this debate of what's in the description and how do we move forward and how do we solve the issues. Both sides have legitimate points on this. On the Ornos team side, the reason that Casey is proposing basically you could say this renumbering, or rather the emphasis on the inscription number, is that this is a more general and scalable way for the future because you don't rely on this indexing, this particular indexing, you rely on actually what's the ordering on chain. Because you can always look on the bitcoin chain to see what the actual ordering is.
00:42:14.710 - 00:42:57.894, Speaker A: But I think that there will be basically kind of a solution that preserves both because the numbers were part of the Ornos growth in history. The reason inscriptions took off in the early days was actually around this number because people actually liked the numbers. So that helped grow in the early days. Ornos protocol. One possible solution for this is really the Ornos protocol develops in the most general and scalable and best way, while you can actually use the protocol itself to record the early inscription numbers up to some point. And so you had to have both. But right now it just came up last week.
00:42:57.894 - 00:43:06.050, Speaker A: So people are kind of learning about the issues and kind of weighing in on both sides and possible solutions.
00:43:06.210 - 00:43:30.686, Speaker D: I can't predict what's going to happen. Obviously, but humans get excited about funny things sometimes. And to me, individually, it's not that different than phone numbers. Everybody has a phone. Not everybody, but most people have a phone number. Different people are attached to those numbers. Some are perceived as more interesting or valuable or not, but some of those numbers are more sought after just because they're interesting numbers.
00:43:30.686 - 00:43:39.490, Speaker D: So where does this all go? I have no idea. I think in the end, the asset value will overcome the number, but we'll have to see.
00:43:39.640 - 00:44:04.890, Speaker C: Yeah. And is there any particular method by which the community will come to resolve? Obviously, you know, Bitcoin, it doesn't quite have the same tools around, like DAOs and stuff, the way that we see in Ethereum. So is it just since Casey said, you know, as long as the community discussion seems to be supportive, it'll go through or how does this even get decided?
00:44:05.230 - 00:44:48.310, Speaker A: That's a great point. It's basically, how does a protocol that get further along and how do you do improvement proposals? Right. Like bips for bitcoin. And that is something that also, I think, is a good time right now to kind of work out more clearly overall for this. One of the things that was suggested a while back was having something like VIX, but for Or OIP, they called it. So I think we'll probably have something like that where people can propose things and then it gets discussed and discussed, and then someone will implement it and it might go into the protocol.
00:44:49.210 - 00:44:57.740, Speaker C: Okay, you might have said this, but for the record, you are supportive of how to resolve this issue.
00:45:00.610 - 00:46:01.962, Speaker A: Right now, the discussions are happening in the Ornos GitHub, so actually we can share the link later. But basically GitHub or node, ord there's a discussions tab. And actually the most active one right now is around this, the inscription numbering. And so I proposed something in there which is basically something that can let the or team develop as they want to, which is to simplify the implementation of the protocol while we also inscribe or basically use the protocol. Itself to record all the inscription numbers up till now so that people can basically, in a permanent and immutable way, always have that inscription number that they received when it happened. That's kind of the history of this. So you have to use the tool of or notes to record the history of what happened up till the protocol updated.
00:46:01.962 - 00:46:04.560, Speaker A: Upgraded to the 1.0 release in particular.
00:46:04.870 - 00:46:19.110, Speaker C: Okay, so one other thing that I saw on a technical level that you had been discussing, Danny, was how you generally feel that standards are needed in Ordinals. So talk a little bit about what problem you're seeing there and how you think that should be resolved.
00:46:19.450 - 00:46:47.886, Speaker A: Yeah. So I think this back to also the earlier point of how does Ornos kind of improve. Right. Or nose is still not at the 1.0 release. So basically there are a few powerful features that have not come out yet. One of them is actually around recursive, endpoints and reinscription because some of these haven't come out yet.
00:46:47.886 - 00:48:04.470, Speaker A: And also people are writing new meta protocols on top of Orano. So it's kind of like a Cambrian explosion of things, which is actually great. But to get more adoption generally, people do need to kind of say, well, these are certain ways that you can do things so that it's easier for people to interoperate. One is around just how do you define basically NFT collections? Like ERC 721 also had a metadata standard that was widely adopted. So people can basically create this NFT collections and browsers or NFT marketplaces could all use them and it could be very easy across all the different third party software for Ornos. It's still quite early, so we're still figuring that out. In fact, the collection problem or even just defining an ornamental collection, that was I think one of my main points early on is up till now, the standard way to create or node collection wasn't standard.
00:48:04.470 - 00:48:13.290, Speaker A: So that was kind of the main point. First is just, well, people want to create collections of Oranos, but there was no standard way to do it. So people kind of just did it their own way.
00:48:13.440 - 00:48:16.390, Speaker C: It's like free CryptoKitties on ethereum.
00:48:16.550 - 00:48:48.550, Speaker A: Yeah. With the recent release, that standard is almost there, which is what I mentioned earlier, this parent child collection prominence standard or I think someone is using the term genetic parents now, which is kind of cool because bitcoin, this UTXO model is a directed graph. So you can actually basically create collections based on like a family tree type of structure, which is unique basically to bitcoin for collections.
00:48:49.210 - 00:49:22.750, Speaker D: So that should produce some level of scalability and more usability, a lot more activity on the chain. And obviously what's good for Ordinals if that happens is good for bitcoin if that happens. And obviously if it's good for bitcoin, it's good for the whole ecosystem because all of the assets kind of flow together. So everybody that's listening to this should want the standards to come, the scalability to be there, and the Cambrian explosion that Danny talked about to just accelerate to make the whole ecosystem a little happier.
00:49:24.210 - 00:50:06.458, Speaker A: Yeah, Avenue is coming up in spring next year and that's going to be a big it's kind of built in growth mechanism in the bitcoin protocol, right. Because it forces the issue of we need growth in bitcoin or else the miners who secure bitcoin will suffer. Right. And we've had that the last three cycles because of this forcing issue. Now we have this basically this deadline, right? The havings coming unique growth on bitcoin. And one of the great opportunities for growth is bitcoin or no. So that's also why we're moving everything over to bitcoin because we see this as a great time in the market to be building on bitcoin using this new protocol that's actually very powerful.
00:50:06.554 - 00:50:28.134, Speaker D: And it also helps answer a little bit of the question, if it all works, what happens when there are no more block rewards? Because this has been a question overhanging the bitcoin ecosystem for a while. Why do you put up a mining operation when you know that eventually there's nothing that comes out if you do the work right? So presuming that there is utility well.
00:50:28.172 - 00:50:33.714, Speaker C: From the block, yes. Like you would still hopefully generate transaction fees.
00:50:33.762 - 00:50:44.618, Speaker D: There we go. And what causes this? I think the percentage of transaction fees driven by ordinals now is what Danny? It's about half. So already in a year and a.
00:50:44.624 - 00:50:48.246, Speaker A: Half, it's half of the transactions are ordinary.
00:50:48.358 - 00:50:51.600, Speaker D: All the other stuff over 13 years.
00:50:51.970 - 00:51:19.162, Speaker C: Which is great and good for Bitcoin, because I think before then, security was a big question mark for Bitcoin. So one other technical kind of innovation that looks super interesting is, again, something that I saw you had written about Danny called recursive ordinals. So describe what those are and give some examples of what they are or how they recursion.
00:51:19.326 - 00:52:08.654, Speaker A: So recursion in terms of programming or math is when you have a self referential function in the Ornos. Casey defined them as recursive inscriptions. So basically inscriptions that call other inscriptions, not quite your own inscription. Although you can I suppose the idea is that the idea around this is composability or modularity of code in particular. So if you're a programmer and you're writing programs, you often want to call other functions or other programs that other people have written. And that's actually kind of the power of this idea of recursive inscriptions, that if you create an inscription, you can actually reference other inscriptions in your inscription. So that's what recursion refers to in the Ornos sense.
00:52:08.654 - 00:53:13.686, Speaker A: And that's very powerful when the inscriptions in particular can be code, because then you can actually write code that calls other code, and you can use anyone's code because Bitcoin and Ornos is a public ledger. So any inscription in the past that's done something, a future person can use that in their inscription. And one example would be when we inscribed OCM dimensions, we said this was 3D generative art on Bitcoin, but we also inscribed several code libraries, three JS and p five JS, and also some compression libraries. Those libraries can be used by other people in the future, and that's what's happening. Other people are actually using the three JS and the p five JS in particular for doing gender of art, because those are very popular libraries for digital and generative art. And they don't have to inscribe those themselves, because block space is expensive. They can just use them in their inscriptions without because it's already on chain.
00:53:13.686 - 00:53:54.002, Speaker A: And also in terms of you can think of it even as a kind of decentralized GitHub. People can actually write more code and snippets of code that other people can use. And also it's a record of all the code, so you can see the provenance of who authored it, but then also who uses it, which is pretty interesting. Basically, you're building, you could say, these applications on bitcoin that also are building blocks for others and have a whole history of who's using them in their code. So that's pretty much a new thing. This type of thing didn't exist before, so it'll be quite interesting to see how it develops.
00:53:54.066 - 00:54:21.854, Speaker C: I'm a little bit confused. I'm sorry, maybe I missed something in there. So I asked you about the recursive ordinals, and I thought it was that the data kind of can get updated and so you could have an NFT that sort of changes over time, but then now you're suddenly talking about almost like a mini blockchain within the blockchain where you're kind of tracking state. Are they the same thing or did you suddenly start talking about something else?
00:54:21.972 - 00:54:55.260, Speaker A: So let's see, recursion is referencing other inscriptions, but there's also this idea of how do you track state and changes of state, and that's also possible with these inscriptions, which is, I guess, a slightly different topic, but how recursion is basically referencing other inscriptions so you can use them in the building blocks for future inscriptions. So basically a type of composability on.
00:54:58.670 - 00:55:22.834, Speaker C: Um, well, so I have to ask know because here we are talking about ordinals and there's definitely a lot of commentary about them, but trading volumes are way down. According to Dune analytics, trading volume in May was about 120,000,000, and for August it was like roughly 12 million is down by 90%. So why do you think that is? And where will the market go from here?
00:55:23.032 - 00:55:28.582, Speaker A: Yeah, I haven't followed the actual trading volume. So you're referencing or no's trading volume, right?
00:55:28.716 - 00:55:31.282, Speaker C: Yeah, I looked that up specifically on Dune.
00:55:31.346 - 00:56:06.494, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah, the market is very young market. The protocol is still being developed. So I think when the protocol reaches the 1.0 release, it'll be more attractive for people to work on because then you actually more clear what you can build and what you can't build. Right now there are still lots of question marks on mean NFT. Volume is down globally for all ecosystems.
00:56:06.494 - 00:56:44.014, Speaker A: So I think that's just a sign of the market right now that we're in. And in particular for bitcoin. Bitcoin Ornos is still very new. So most people might have heard of Ornos, but they haven't really actually tried it or dug in. I mean, the wallet infrastructure is just being developed. There are two wallets, XMers and leather, that are really innovating on and making it easier for people to use bitcoin ordinals, but it is still actually relatively hard to use because it's so new.
00:56:44.132 - 00:56:58.882, Speaker C: All right, well one thing that you're working on that could potentially make it a bit more consumer friendly is an ordinals marketplace for digital artifacts. It's called Osura or maybe I mispronounced that. You tell me. Why don't you tell us about that?
00:56:59.016 - 00:57:58.390, Speaker A: Yeah, so it's going to be a curated marketplace for onus, because it is the wild west. We want to curate what we think are the high end and high quality or nose. And we see that's also where this market in general will go over time, because bitcoin is basically the highest market cap blockchain that's considered to be the most secure and decentralized and some great properties. So people who have very expensive and high value NFTs or they want to create very high value digital assets, they probably want to secure them on the most secure chain. And so I think that's opportunity that bitcoin and bitcoin Ornos has. So we're focused on that market. And also because of the properties of being a digital artifact, it does cost more to create these.
00:57:58.390 - 00:58:29.018, Speaker A: And as the transaction fees on bitcoin goes up over time, it's going to be impractical to be making, let's say, NFTs or digital artifacts that are like $5 or $10, because just the active creating them might cost you $50 or $100. So it'll basically have kind of a filtering mechanism for people who want to secure high value assets. So that's our focus, kind of for the long term of where we think the market will go on bitcoin.
00:58:29.194 - 00:59:18.058, Speaker D: I'd recommend for people that are students or not of American financial history to read a book by a stock trader in the late 18 hundreds named Jesse Livermore. And he wrote a book called reminisces of a stock operator. And in that era, as Danny was describing wild west, there were many, many small exchanges all over the place where kind of penny stocks, I'm calling them penny stocks, but just shares of things would trade. And these places were called bucket shops. And he would basically go around and trade on these things. And he made and lost a fortune, I think four times that in today's, the value would be like a billion dollars. So make a billion, lose a billion, make a billion, lose a billion.
00:59:18.058 - 01:00:11.950, Speaker D: And he kept a journal, and he wrote about all of his experiences and why he may have lost money or how he felt. It's an amazing thing for people that are engaged in that kind of thing. And over the years, a lot of those bucket shops disappeared because they were not high integrity places with high integrity assets. And so what Danny and team want to do with Osura is create a place. I don't know that it'll be a regulated place like the New York stock exchange, but the world needs a place where there's trust in the trustless system that we are. That the things that you are buying and selling and the people that you're working with have the right motivation to do good and to build a system that is meaningful for this world, not just scam everybody. So that's what Osura is about great.
01:00:12.020 - 01:00:39.010, Speaker C: Well, one thing know, at this moment, we kind of have pretty vibrant communities. NFTs already on ethereum and solana. It sounds like you're already working with some that have made it in those blockchains to come and work with you on Bitcoin. What are those conversations? Like, how easy or difficult is it to try to persuade creators to leave other chains to do NFTs on Bitcoin?
01:00:39.170 - 01:01:16.520, Speaker A: Yeah, great question. Well, first, I think NFTs will do well on all the chains. A number of chains will do well because they're their own ecosystem and they have pros and cons. So Ethereum, like big pro, is the smart contracting. You can do a bunch with the smart contract. And Bitcoin's pro is actually this digital artifacts protocol and also bitcoin itself because bitcoin is that complementary blockchain security model, right? Because everyone else has moved towards proof of stake in some form, while bitcoin is we are proof of work. This is that security model.
01:01:16.520 - 01:02:12.280, Speaker A: That model is quite significant. I think. Also there's probably just going to be one winning proof of work chain just because of the expense of proof of work. So bitcoin is that chain most likely has the biggest network for that. So we are focused first on actually just art because people understand art as an NFT and also as a digital artifact in particular. Also artists, when they're creating art, they care about kind of lasting or the longevity of the medium, right? Bitcoin is the medium for bitcoin Ornos and there are actually a lot of great properties of this medium for art. And so when that's kind of explained to artists, then they actually quite appreciate being able to do this.
01:02:12.280 - 01:02:57.094, Speaker A: Right now, there's still some technical challenges for being able to do art on Bitcoin, but those are things that we're working out. So one of the artists that's coming over launching on Ashora later this year is Alexey Andre, who's well known for friendship bracelets and 720. He's been an art blocks artist for a number of years and has some very amazing generative art pieces. So he's going to be launching a generative art collection on bitcoin orders on Ashora. And I think I hear a lot of there are more and more artists who are looking into this. It's still pretty early days because we were talking about earlier the idea of just being able to do a collection with the standards. It hasn't been clear yet.
01:02:57.094 - 01:03:18.410, Speaker A: So if you're an artist, you don't want to just launch on an unclear platform. But it's becoming more clear. And I think towards the end of the year, it'll be a very, I think, attractive medium for art. But you can do more with Ornos as we were mentioning earlier.
01:03:19.150 - 01:03:45.842, Speaker C: So I imagine one of the things that's next on your plate is managing this transition from having the on chain monkey collection on Ethereum and moving it over to Bitcoin because you already have so many NFT owners out there talk a little bit about how you're going to do that. It seems like you probably need some participation from them. So just seems like it might be a really challenging proposition, but tell me what your next steps are.
01:03:45.976 - 01:04:21.566, Speaker A: Yeah, so one of the things is NFTs have done pretty well as in bringing new people into the crypto ecosystem the last couple of years. So ethereum in particular. Actually, a lot of people joined ethereum the last cycle who didn't even own bitcoin or ethereum is the only thing they have. Right. So now it's actually this new thing. Bitcoin is the new thing for them. And so we were educating them about how to basically create a bitcoin wallet and then prisonly or know is aware of bitcoin wallet because, as I mentioned, there are only a handful of those.
01:04:21.566 - 01:04:40.866, Speaker A: And then how to basically secure that. It will make the migration very simple from ethereum to bitcoin and have some interoperability, basically, because we have a pretty complex ecosystem already built on ethereum. So we're working on bringing that to bitcoin.
01:04:41.058 - 01:04:46.326, Speaker C: All right, well, it has been such a pleasure chatting with both of you. Where can people learn more about each.
01:04:46.348 - 01:04:47.798, Speaker B: Of you and your work?
