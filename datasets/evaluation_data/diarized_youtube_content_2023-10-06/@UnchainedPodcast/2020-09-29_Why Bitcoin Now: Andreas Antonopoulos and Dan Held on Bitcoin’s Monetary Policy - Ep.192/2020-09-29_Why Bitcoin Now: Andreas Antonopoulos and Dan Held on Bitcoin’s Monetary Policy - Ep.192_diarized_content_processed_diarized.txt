00:00:55.054 - 00:01:28.050, Speaker A: app today. This is the 6th in the Why Bitcoin Now series in which you take a closer look at bitcoin in the context of macroeconomic forces, including the pandemic and the economic response. And today's episode will focus on bitcoin's monetary policy. Here to discuss are Andreas M. Antonopoulos, speaker, educator and author of Mastering Bitcoin, Mastering Ethereum, and the Internet of Money, volumes one, two and three. And Dan held growth lead at Kraken Disclosure. Before we begin, Kraken is a previous sponsor of my shows.
00:01:28.050 - 00:01:30.010, Speaker A: Welcome, Andreas and Dan.
00:01:30.430 - 00:01:33.274, Speaker B: Hello. Thanks for having me.
00:01:33.472 - 00:01:38.300, Speaker A: To start, let's define what we're going to discuss today. What is a monetary policy?
00:01:39.230 - 00:02:15.494, Speaker B: I guess I can go ahead. So a monetary policy is what a government or central bank would define more eloquently, a central bank would define as its issuance schedule of currency and or the inflation targets or other socioeconomic targets. Recently, the Fed has described its monetary policy as to have accomplishing several other factors outside of just like an inflation rate. For example. I think they're focusing on solving inequality now as well. So that's how I would define a monetary policy. And also note that this is distinctly different than a fiscal policy.
00:02:15.494 - 00:02:29.580, Speaker B: Fiscal being more associated with the federal government or on a government level, which would be around the spending on different programs for Medicaid, Medicare or Social Security.
00:02:30.130 - 00:02:32.746, Speaker A: Andreas, do you have any thoughts?
00:02:32.938 - 00:03:42.206, Speaker C: Yeah, from a mechanical perspective, I think of this as you have central banks that are quasi independent and they have a bunch of dials. And what they're trying to do with these dials is adjust the supply of money itself in order to affect the velocity of money through the economy. And they use different dials. Some of them are things like the balance sheet dial, which is a relatively new one, where the central bank goes in and buys things on the market like Treasuries. The most important dial, the traditional dial, is the overnight interest rate for interbank lending at the Federal Reserve Window, which is basically where banks park their cash overnight. And by tweaking that dial, they can control how much money is effectively in circulation versus parked at the Fed. And through that, they can then affect other parameters.
00:03:42.206 - 00:04:33.358, Speaker C: I think one of the things that I find fascinating about monetary policy is that, first of all, it's extremely variable and subject to political pressure, which is why central banks are quasi independent. The other thing is that in many cases, tweaking the dial has a delayed effect. And this is tricky. This is a bit like you start changing the rudder on a ship and it turns 3 miles later. Because of this delayed effect, it's not always clear how much control the central bank actually has over the thing they're changing because they don't change that thing directly. They tweak one of the other dials and then they have this delayed effect. So, for example, inflation, they don't control inflation directly.
00:04:33.358 - 00:04:40.230, Speaker C: They control interest rates on the overnight window, and the secondary effect happens later. Would you agree with that, Dan?
00:04:40.970 - 00:05:10.954, Speaker B: I would. And there's a useful analogy that I came up with, which is imagine you've got the Fed, and the Fed is driving the car, which is the economy. The Fed can't see into the future, so you can't see out your front windshield, but you can use your rear view mirror. So they're looking at historical data and they're using that to influence which levers they press. So they look historically, they look at the road behind them and they go, okay, it's gone to the left. We need to make it go back to the right. And so they press the brakes.
00:05:10.954 - 00:05:35.842, Speaker B: But the problem is, like you mentioned, the brakes don't kick in for another mile. So it's a little bit tricky and they're steering the steering wheel and pressing the gas. But these are all very delayed reactions to historical information. Really, at the core root of this. It's a very tricky information problem and a very tricky influence problem where they don't have a really tight latency there's, not a really low latency there between their actions and their outcome.
00:05:35.986 - 00:05:51.360, Speaker C: I love that analogy because it immediately makes me think of how if the central bank of the US dollar is a car driven by a rear view mirror, bitcoin is a train and it's on rails, we know exactly where it's going.
00:05:52.370 - 00:06:29.980, Speaker A: Yeah, well, I was just about to say that one of the most fascinating things about the way that this discussion started is how different it sounds from bitcoin's monetary policy, which we're going to dive into deeply. And I would say, at least to my mind, probably the most prominent feature of bitcoin's monetary policy is the cap on its money supply. Since the software will stop minting new bitcoins once 21 million coins are reached, why is the cap on the money supply such a core feature to bitcoin's monetary policy? And how would you say that it differs from other previous forms of money?
00:06:30.670 - 00:06:32.538, Speaker C: Dan, do you want to go for that one?
00:06:32.704 - 00:07:05.454, Speaker B: Sure. The disinflationary. So it's not technically a deflationary monetary policy. It's a disinflationary monetary policy. It's a decreasing issuance rate, or you could call it an inflation rate. But there's a bit of a nuance to some people's definition of interest rate sorry, inflation rate versus issuance rate. But essentially the bitcoin protocol issues bitcoin at a decreasing rate over time, and those moments in which the newly minted coins decreases are called having events.
00:07:05.454 - 00:07:53.806, Speaker B: And the reason why a monetary policy with a hard cap is important is because Satoshi was trying to solve for a couple different problems. One was the impossibility of choosing a proper rate of inflation. And so Satoshi actually jokes about this a little bit, where he know, if we could trust someone to take data outside of bitcoin's blockchain and bring it in accurately, then there might be a way to adjust the supply in reaction to demand. But I think he's saying that a little bit in a jokingly manner. You can't really trust anyone on the outside to pipe in that data in a totally trustless manner. There's always some degree of trust that you would have to have. And what I think he fundamentally understood was that the inflation rate or the proper rate of inflation is impossible to determine.
00:07:53.806 - 00:08:46.130, Speaker B: So let's say after bitcoin is totally issued 21 million coins, there is no proper way to choose the right inflation rate. There's an information problem in which for us to choose the proper rate of inflation, we would have to digest trillions of data points a second, every single consumer's purchasing behavior all across the world. We'd have to ingest that, parse it, and analyze it instantaneously, and there's no way we can do that. And so what Satoshi decided to instead was set the rate at zero long term. So as soon as all the bitcoin are issued, the inflation rate is 0%. That also reduces a political attack vector. When the rate of inflation is constantly and subjectively up to discussion, then that will be used as a lever for certain powerful groups to influence the inflation rate for their benefit.
00:08:46.130 - 00:09:02.940, Speaker B: We commonly refer to this in the space as the cantillian effect. I'm not sure how many people outside of crypto have ever heard of that before, but it's essentially those closest to the money printing benefit from it. So those closest to the monetary policy and influencing it will likely benefit from it.
00:09:03.630 - 00:10:20.050, Speaker C: I think it's also a battle between savers and debtors, in that inflation can be used to shift gains from those who save to those who have debt by making debt cheaper and removing the burden of paying back the debt by making it payable in less and less and less valuable money. That's one of the arguments against the current US dollar monetary policy, is that the government is effectively destroying savings, making it impossible for people to save because the interest rate you get from your bank or any form of savings is minuscule to zero. But the benefit that has for the government is that that makes the $23 trillion worth of debt, or however many we have now, those are denominated in dollars. So the more inflation you have, the less value that has. So essentially, the debt gets smaller in purchasing value over time because of inflation. And that's another thing that is very subject to political manipulation. If you can shift power between debtors and savers, you can very much manipulate the economy.
00:10:20.790 - 00:11:11.054, Speaker A: Yeah. And one other thing I would add is that I read in savadin Amos'book the bitcoin standard, and it's so obvious, and yet just this simple statement struck me. He wrote, until the invention of bitcoin, scarcity was always relative, never absolute. And it is true, even if you think about other scarce forms of money such as gold, it's not something where there's a finite amount. So the fact that that can be known in advance about bitcoin is pretty remarkable. Let's actually maybe dive into a little bit more the comparison of bitcoin to gold, because it is often called digital gold. And I did just point out one difference between them, and yet they are often compared.
00:11:11.054 - 00:11:14.900, Speaker A: So how would you say they're similar and how would you say they're different?
00:11:15.910 - 00:11:53.354, Speaker B: It's all about the predictability of the monetary policy. I think that at the core root of what we're all talking about here with bitcoin, gold fiat is the predictability of it. And with the supply, for sure, under, we concretely 100% know that it will only be 21 million. With gold. We know that it was scarce, scarce on earth. But if we zoom out and we look at the solar system, and we look at these asteroids circling around the Earth and other in other parts of the solar system, they contain large, large amounts of gold. So we know certainly that gold is only finite on earth.
00:11:53.354 - 00:12:29.050, Speaker B: We don't exactly know how finite it is, and then we know that it is not finite outside of earth. So gold was only used as a mechanism for money because that was what we had at the time. But with bitcoin, with digital gold, we can concretely understand that there are only 21 million. And that assurance, that confidence, that absolute confidence in that number, means that trust can flow into bitcoin, which brings in deeper liquidity, which brings in more and more folks believing in bitcoin and understanding it and placing their money, which money is a representation of time, energy and trust. Placing that into the bitcoin protocol.
00:12:29.470 - 00:13:28.266, Speaker C: I would add to that that there are a number of properties that are unique and fundamentally different in bitcoin as compared to gold, that actually make it much more powerful than traditional gold. As someone who has investments in gold and bitcoin, it's always been a very difficult problem, which is owning gold is not easy. And using gold as a store of value isn't easy, even for its main purpose, which is stored value, let alone secondary purposes like medium of exchange. The bottom line is that I do not have the technical capability to verify that physical gold that I hold is actually gold. It's not easy to do and to do it consistently and to do it safely. It's difficult to store securely. It's extremely difficult to transport securely or even at all because it's damn heavy.
00:13:28.266 - 00:14:24.274, Speaker C: If you've ever held cold, you know that. So it has a number of problematic properties that physical gold has a number of problematic properties. It's much easier to confiscate, seize, freeze, or put such conditions on its storage that it's very, very difficult for many people around the world to actually hold it. So all of these properties, especially the forgeability aspect, are resolved in bitcoin. Bitcoin is infinitely transportable with great ease. It has zero weight, it can be subdivided very finely, and it is also absolutely unforgettable and easily verifiable as genuine and real bitcoin. So all of these properties make it a much better store of value.
00:14:24.274 - 00:15:10.590, Speaker C: And then you add on top of that that bitcoin also has a number of very strong properties as a medium of exchange. Not yet, perhaps for the smaller payments that you might think of, the buying a cup of coffee example that we always think of. But certainly for me as a business person, getting paid and paying payroll and getting paid for jobs which are slightly larger payments, but often across borders, it's a fantastic medium of exchange. And for that purpose, it's very, very suitable. And I could never use gold like that. So bitcoin is digital gold. If digital gold put on a cape and became super gold.
00:15:11.970 - 00:15:37.640, Speaker A: Yeah. And one other aspect of the cap that I think has been crucial to the success of bitcoin was in helping it get off the ground. So why would you say that is, and specifically, how did that play out with miners and people wanting to buy it and stuff like that?
00:15:38.010 - 00:15:44.460, Speaker C: Well, it's an interesting idea. And first of all, to define FOMO, I said jokingly, FOMO fear of missing out.
00:15:44.910 - 00:15:46.394, Speaker A: But I think that's true.
00:15:46.512 - 00:16:43.870, Speaker C: Very true. Yeah. And so I think there's two aspects to this, and often there's a discussion in bitcoin about the utility versus scarcity aspect of bitcoin as a chicken and egg problem. One of the things we celebrate in bitcoin I even have a mug with a symbol for it, is pizza day, right? Pizza day represents the utility moment, the moment when bitcoin was used to buy something that somebody wanted before that its value wasn't really yet defined. Interestingly enough, though, you could make an argument that its scarcity had not yet really become noticeable. So that's another reason why its value wasn't defined. So in the genesis of bitcoin, one of the big discussions and debates, I think, is did bitcoin need to become useful before it became valuable, or did the scarcity make it valuable even before it was really useful.
00:16:43.870 - 00:17:27.100, Speaker C: And there's differing arguments on these. I think they both work hand in hand. But this scarcity is becoming more and more and more noticeable over time with each having. It gets felt in the markets very acutely because, of course, miners do sell a big proportion of their newly minted bitcoin in order to pay electricity. That's a specific amount of bitcoin every day that has to be picked up by someone buying just for the price to remain stable. And as long as there are more people buying than that, then that pushes the price up. So the scarcity is being felt in the market, especially after each having.
00:17:27.100 - 00:17:56.020, Speaker C: And that is, of course, generating fear of missing out arithmetically. A lot of people say, well, if you think about it, 21 million bitcoin is far less than the, I don't know, 40, 50 million millionaires that exist on the planet. So that means that not even every millionaire on the planet can have one bitcoin. When you grasp these little nuances, it becomes very clear that the scarcity is getting more and more real over time.
00:17:57.110 - 00:18:34.142, Speaker B: There's a couple of really fun things to kind of break out here and talk about. So one is the decimal where Satoshi put the decimal at 21 million versus 21 billion or 210,000,000,000. I thought that was a really interesting decision to dig into in terms of how Satoshi felt, that 21 million bitcoin felt maybe would feel more scarce than 21 billion. I think Satoshi this was the first cryptocurrency that actually worked. There had been other failed attempts before, and I'm not sure if he was super confident that it was going to work. I think we all forget that bitcoin didn't have a price for a year and a half. That's a long time.
00:18:34.196 - 00:18:39.890, Speaker C: Oh, Satoshi Nakamoto was definitely the first bitcoin skeptic. He didn't think it was going to work necessarily.
00:18:40.230 - 00:19:09.290, Speaker B: It was an experiment to him. Yeah. And I think he largely, in his language, echoes that with the other developers of him encouraging them to experiment with going, hey, you should go try this out for XYZ sort of utility or application. And he wasn't sure as well that he hypothesized that scarcity alone could be the driving factor behind price appreciation. But he wasn't sure, and he encouraged other people to go use bitcoin for different types of applications with the hypothesis that might drive demand.
00:19:10.030 - 00:19:27.620, Speaker C: There's a lovely little myth that actually the 21 million was a mistake. And in the calculation of havings, satoshi was actually aiming for 42 million exactly double. Which is, of course, the answer to the eternal question of what is the meaning of life? The universe and everything.
00:19:29.990 - 00:19:31.250, Speaker B: Find it everywhere.
00:19:31.750 - 00:20:46.474, Speaker A: And that's from Douglas Adams's book, which I'm just guide to the galaxy. Right, but then also, if that were the case, which there's something about that that seems plausible, which is the fact that then the block reward would have started at 100 bitcoins per block rather than 50, which is where the software started. So I also thought that was a very interesting theory, but one other comment that I wanted to make. So I'm asking these questions, but then I also sort of want to jump in, which is that I feel like having that specific number and you're right, Dan, it almost doesn't matter what the number is. It's just the fact that you can know what the number is. And that allows you to make calculations, right? So with a minor, they could calculate, okay, they have actual numbers that they can plug into an equation and be like, will I be profitable? And they can figure out the answer to that, right? So if they, for instance, know, okay, there's going to be 21 million bitcoins ever at these different points in time, this will be the supply, then they can calculate that against known money supplies. I've seen comparisons of the trillions of dollars that are in gold currently, or the M zero money supply, or the M one money supply or whatever.
00:20:46.474 - 00:21:16.530, Speaker A: And so they can make projections. But then also, once the price of bitcoin became known, or once there was a price on bitcoin, then they could also use that to then plug in whether or not their mining operation would be profitable. I feel like all those things were helpful to people who heard about this new thing, didn't know whether it was going to take off, and yet could do math to kind of figure out, okay, is this worth my time and effort?
00:21:18.230 - 00:21:19.502, Speaker B: Sorry, go finish up.
00:21:19.576 - 00:21:54.990, Speaker A: Well, just the last thing also is that I feel like in a way, the cap creates this sort of space of digital real a, like a future Manhattan. If you have this idea that, okay, there's going to be some kind of future monetary version of Manhattan that will exist in the digital sphere, sort of bitcoin was like that. And obviously, Manhattan nowadays is very expensive real estate. So knowing like, oh, if I get a piece of like, that's going to grow in, like, I feel like the cap is what does know. It creates this Manhattan sized island.
00:21:55.650 - 00:22:45.066, Speaker B: Money serves a very important and I love your thoughts. This is I got really excited once you brought this up because this brings me to an analogy that I find really useful. That money is the measuring stick of capitalist experiments, which are entrepreneurial efforts. Money is that measuring stick to help us evaluate is the allocation of capital towards a service or good building that or creating that. Is that a productive utility for society? So if I hypothesize that hot dogs are needed on my street corner and I buy a little stand and I buy the hot dogs, and it turns out that no one wanted hot dogs and I fail, money is the ultimate measuring stick of me. Allocating capital effectively in the economy to solve problems for humans. And so Bitcoin, being a 21 million hard cap, is a finite exact measuring stick.
00:22:45.066 - 00:23:19.558, Speaker B: Before we've got this variable measuring stick, which we're not even sure exactly how many dollars are out in the market, there could be some numbers that are either fudged or it's hard for us to validate the entire supply of dollars or euros or yen. And with Bitcoin, we can now concretely measure it. And this is a problem that we see in the sciences. If you don't have a precise measurement of a kilogram or a meter, then how would you go evaluate different experiments for different endeavors to measure and try out new things? And so with Bitcoin, it is the first time we have a concrete measuring stick for all business outcomes.
00:23:19.734 - 00:24:21.354, Speaker C: One of the interesting conclusions you get from that is that in the end, it doesn't really matter how big a meter is, as long as everyone has the same idea. So the actual unit doesn't matter 21 million. There are some aspects of human cognition where certain round numbers are more appealing, easier to understand, et cetera, et cetera. We don't really work very well with things after the decimal point. So there is an argument to be made that that was a good choice for the primary unit, but ultimately the size of the measuring stick doesn't matter. And that comes to a second very important aspect of this, which is ultimately it's not the money that has the value, it's the things you do with the money that have the value. The measuring stick itself isn't its length, and that's important to realize.
00:24:21.354 - 00:25:10.730, Speaker C: It's not money that has value, it's the things you get for it that have value. And in order for the measuring stick to work, you have to have that stability or you have to have very massive utility. It's interesting because in all of this discussion we talk about the US dollar as a currency that doesn't have these characteristics. Yet the US dollar is an incredibly successful currency. It is still the world reserve currency and is likely to remain the world reserve currency for a very long time. So then the question is why? How can you have a world reserve currency that doesn't have sound monetary properties and solid store value and fixed unit of measurements? And I think that's a really interesting question to explore.
00:25:10.890 - 00:25:15.780, Speaker A: Well, do you want to make a theory? Because I'm curious to know your thoughts on that.
00:25:16.470 - 00:26:11.090, Speaker C: I think it's momentum from utility. The US. Dollar has enormous utility and as long as most other substitutes are inferior in more than one ways either politically inferior the Yuan, for example, inferior in terms of breadth of trade vis a vis other economies and things like that and inferior for geopolitical reasons, such as control of oil producing economies. That utility can carry it forward with momentum much longer than you would expect on paper. In theory. And of course, that's exactly the thing that is being challenged by bitcoin. Bitcoin offers a viable alternative on certain dimensions.
00:26:11.090 - 00:26:31.346, Speaker C: In my opinion, there is no perfect system. And I think it's important to recognize that bitcoin has its own weaknesses. And so from a broader perspective, it's really a matter of which dimensions are important for the thing you're trying to do. And that's why the dollar isn't just going to disappear overnight.
00:26:31.538 - 00:27:34.800, Speaker A: Yeah, so actually I want to ask two questions based on these comments. One was, I was going to ask you guys if you thought that bitcoin or any digital currency would be successful or whether its monetary policy would still be superior to existing fiat currencies even without a cap. So for instance, if there was some kind of perpetual inflation, which I know other cryptocurrencies use, but then the other thing that I was going to ask, which was, as we know, Austrian economists have been really enamored with bitcoin. But there is like one theory from Austrian economics that doesn't quite explain why bitcoin has been so successful, which is something called the mesa's regression theory, which is that the value of a currency comes from the likelihood it will continue to be valuable. Which means that in reverse, the current value is based on the previous value. And yet bitcoin got value out of thin air. So I'm interested on your thoughts on both of these things.
00:27:35.250 - 00:28:11.194, Speaker B: Yeah, so to the second one, I think that a lot of Austrian economics, like economists, they looked at previous commodity monies and hypothesized that as these monies became into existence, that they came out to existence because they previously had utility as a commodity. So we saw different types. Some people also look at gold and they claim that gold has some alternative utility for industrial use and or jewelry. But what's funny is that the industrial use for gold is a very new invention. Like 200 years ago, gold did not have a utility in an industrial use case. And then if we look at yet.
00:28:11.232 - 00:28:15.580, Speaker C: It still had enormous store of value use regardless. Correct?
00:28:16.110 - 00:28:42.706, Speaker B: Yet use is as a store of value versus a lot of these economists go, oh, well, these commodity monies had to have previous real world functional utility for something other than money. But that's the whole point is function is money. That's its utility. And with gold, people often say that, oh, well, it's also used for jewelry. Well, no, jewelry is the same objective. It's a display of your store value. It's not an alternative use, it's not an industrial use.
00:28:42.706 - 00:28:54.694, Speaker B: There are plenty of shiny metals out there that are less scarce and easier to work with than gold. So gold main value, its utility, is its utility and money. Right.
00:28:54.812 - 00:30:15.140, Speaker C: And the interesting thing is that a lot of these economic analyses of bitcoin, like many of the analysis we see in the financial space, are based on 18th and 19th century economic doctrines. So the problem with all of those is that we're attempting to analyze something that is truly novel. It's truly novel in that it doesn't neatly fit into any of the categories that preexisted on which all of the analytical tools that we're using are currently based. So all of the economic theory that comes from austrian economics or from Chicago school economics or from any economics or MBA type of university training is based on certain assumptions about the structure of an industrial, primarily an industrial economy, and certain assumptions based on the historical perspective from the 18th, 19th, and early 20th century. These are not new schools of thought. Bitcoin confounds a lot of these analytical tools because it doesn't neatly fit into any of the categories that preexisted. And it exists in a realm the internet, which doesn't neatly fit into any of the macroeconomic or even microeconomic analysis of the past.
00:30:15.140 - 00:31:13.582, Speaker C: The idea that the internet is an economy of its own was completely controversial less than 15 years ago. And the idea that you could have an entirely intangible economy that transcends borders completely controversial 15 years ago. The idea that bitcoin isn't just a currency or a stock or a bond or an investment or a commodity. And a lot of people say, well, what do you think bitcoin is? Is it a bond? Is it a stock? Is it a currency? Is it a commodity? I'll tell you, the answer is really simple. Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency. And so we don't yet have that category and the analytical tools that come with it. We are now building the analytical tools to be able to rationally speak about how cryptocurrencies behave over longer term and larger economies.
00:31:13.582 - 00:31:54.466, Speaker C: Until now, we didn't have any, and this has happened before. 20 years ago, there were no financial tools for speaking about derivatives simply did not exist in their modern form. They had to develop these. We have entire institutions like the commodities and futures organization and regulator here in the United States. That is, half of its regulatory mandate is on something that didn't exist 25 years ago. We need to have new tools in order to speak intelligently about new things that do not simply fit the behavior or the tools we have in the past.
00:31:54.648 - 00:32:40.862, Speaker A: Yeah, this is why I love covering this space, because different analysts will come up with new ways of modeling out the value of bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, and they're just making it up. I'm not dismissing what they're doing, but I'm just trying to explain everything that we're doing is new. We're just creating it on our own. And it just requires our creativity and our smarts and just new ways of looking at the world and trying to figure out what it is that is being built. And I think Spencer bogart wrote this great post saying that bitcoin is sort of like this platypus because it's this animal that has all these different. Features from other animals, and yet it's all in one. And that's why the US.
00:32:40.862 - 00:32:52.510, Speaker A: Government has had a hard time classifying things like know, the IRS calls it property and the CFTC calls it a commodity et is this is cognitive dissonance.
00:32:52.590 - 00:33:58.658, Speaker C: Playing out in very tangible and real worlds in real ways in our industry. This cognitive dissonance as to expecting bitcoin to behave as something that preexisted and then trying very hard to squeeze it into that category and either being surprised or even more so, being righteously outraged that it doesn't conform to those things. It's a bit like the new automotive industry being emerging into a world of horses and horse carriages. And the analysts are still trying to figure out how it works by estimating annual consumption of hay, and the regulators insisting that it is common sense to have a veterinary doctor on staff in any transportation company. And it is both unreasonable and dangerous for public health not to have one. And this is exactly the kind of framework that is being hosted around bitcoin.
00:33:58.834 - 00:34:03.162, Speaker B: To kind of wrap up here. And I think it'll go back to your first question, which I don't think we answered yeah.
00:34:03.216 - 00:34:06.870, Speaker A: About the inflationary. Yeah. Whether there could be perpetual inflation.
00:34:07.030 - 00:34:08.618, Speaker B: Let's see if I can tie this together.
00:34:08.704 - 00:34:09.340, Speaker A: Okay.
00:34:10.350 - 00:34:53.914, Speaker B: All right. So wild bitcoin is this new species of money. I mean, it is a wild, new, exotic species, right? Like, this isn't anything of what we've seen before. It's very different from these commodity monies, from fiat, from gold. For this new money to permeate into permeate the consciousness of what is money, why is bitcoin better or different than previous monies? And for that to happen, that takes a long time to do when it comes to bitcoin is fundamentally different from a technological perspective and from a species of money perspective. But it is somewhat the same in terms of the problems that it's solving. And ultimately, it's all about trust that makes it work.
00:34:53.914 - 00:35:16.558, Speaker B: And this was satoshi's first after the white paper. This was satoshi's first post. And in the second paragraph, he goes, trust is required to make it all work. We have to trust in the central banks. We have to trust in our banks. And bitcoin essentially is solving the problem of trust. So while it's a new technology, it solves a very fundamental, I would say, problem that has always existed in humankind.
00:35:16.558 - 00:36:05.750, Speaker B: It solves the problem of trust. Now, tying this back to the monetary policy and monetary policy with, say, a perpetual inflation rate versus one that has no inflation rate post 21 million issuance or post total issuance, the monetary policy is a really tricky thing in the issuance schedule, and the security models are all intertwined. That's what makes this really I've been in this space for a long time, not as long as andreas or others, but when you first get in, you go, oh, it's digital gold. Gold 2.0 and then you go down the rabbit hole of proof of work, and you're like, wow, this is pretty fascinating. And then you get into functions of the security model, and you're like, this is incredible, the intricacies of how this is all tied together. Let me play out a couple here on the Issuance schedule.
00:36:05.750 - 00:36:18.390, Speaker B: So every four years, the rate of newly minted bitcoin just drops in half. And that occurs every four years, or every 210,000 blocks, more accurately, until 21 million bitcoin are created.
00:36:19.290 - 00:36:40.314, Speaker C: Well, 21 million are never created. 20,999,999 bitcoin points. Nine, nine, seven. Specifically, if you work out the correct and I'm going to be pedantic about this, but the correct one is 21 will never be reached. It's an asymptotic that never touches 21 million.
00:36:40.512 - 00:37:21.010, Speaker B: Yeah, that's why we have Andreas on the call. He understands the nuance of it and can also explain it simply. Yeah. So with this Issuance schedule, why did Satoshi choose every four years? And what happens during those having know Satoshi? Hypothesized that Satoshi before bitcoin had value, hypothesized that due to the scarcity of it, that FOMO would be a core critical element in terms of user adoption. He goes, as the price increases, more people become aware of it, who then buy in anticipation of the price increasing further. He's essentially describing FOMO in a very volatile market cycle. The market cycles are bitcoin's main user acquisition method.
00:37:21.010 - 00:38:03.794, Speaker B: We all became aware of it probably in 2013 or 2017. I think Andreas was earlier. But for a lot of us, in terms of the big adoption waves, 13 and 17 were huge because the price appreciated. And bitcoin's monetary policy, since there is no increase in supply, when demand increases, that creates very volatile moments where the price skyrockets up. And similarly, when demand decreases, the price drops. And so that is, one, a user acquisition method. But what's also interesting is that as bitcoin issues coins over this next hundred years or so, and that eventually becomes asymptotic with 21 million, there's something called the block reward.
00:38:03.794 - 00:38:43.694, Speaker B: And the block reward is what miners receive, which is the block subsidy, the newly minted coins, plus transaction fees. And this is bitcoin's long term security model, or it's been bitcoin's security model. But when we project and look into the future for its long term security prospects, bitcoin's security model is dependent on the subsidy. The newly minted coins keep dropping in each block reward. That has to be compensated by a rise in transaction fees. And those transaction fees come about through these market cycles, where all of a sudden, there was a million bitcoin users and now there's 10 million. So there's many more transacting on chain, which means there's many more transaction fees, which means it replaces the subsidy.
00:38:43.694 - 00:39:43.938, Speaker B: So when you look into the intricacies of how the monetary policy, the Issuance schedule and the security model are all intertwined, it's pretty fascinatingly complex. And so there's some protocols out there that, look at that long term security model and they hypothesize, what if we had a perpetual rate of inflation because we're not sure if the transaction fees will replace the newly minted coins or the subsidy in these block rewards. And I admire their want to go look at that very long term security model and look at improving it, but they're also going back and destroying the fundamental thing this is, in my opinion, destroying the fundamental thing that makes bitcoin or blockchain technology great is it removes trust. If we have to trust that you won't change your monetary policy again after you've chosen a perpetual rate of inflation, which is impossible to choose, then you've now inserted trust back into the mechanism that we use to remove trust or remove trust with humans.
00:39:44.034 - 00:40:17.294, Speaker A: So I definitely want to dive more into this because I have a lot of questions on a lot of what you just said, but this is the latest I've ever done in Ad Break. You guys, we're having such a good discussion, I couldn't break it off. So we're going to talk about all these issues involving the cap and changing the issuance, et cetera.

00:41:34.282 - 00:42:32.166, Speaker A: Why not go grab some chests? Back to my conversation with Andreas and Dan. So dan. I was so curious. This was something that, you know, kind of looking into before the you know, as you mentioned, at a certain point when the block reward stops, there will be a transition where miners will be compensated in transaction fees, not in the block reward. And the current amount that they earn from fees is about 9% of the block reward. And so we'd have to see transaction fees eleven x by roughly 21 40, which is when the new bitcoins will stop being minted. But I just wondered, if we don't see an increase in the amount of transactions that can happen at layer one, then can transaction fees eleven x in that time or will that require people to pay a lot more per transaction?
00:42:32.358 - 00:43:35.898, Speaker B: That's a great question. And when I'm not sure how many people who are listening to this work in tech, but in tech we have something called a KPI, a key performance indicator. And we use it as a calibration method to coordinate our efforts at a company and use that metric to define success. For example, that might be user signups or number of users trading at kraken, et cetera. The KPI for what we're looking at right now, which the question we're trying to answer is, are transaction fees replacing the block subsidy in the block reward? So are newly minted coins as those decrease, is that value being replaced by the subsidy? And so we can calculate that would be our primary KPI. So you could look at transaction fees over the subsidy, transaction fees in a block divided by the subsidy and you brought up that that's at 9%. If we look at that historically and we make it like a rolling 60 day to smooth it out a little bit, and we look at this over time on a log curve, it's very much trending in the right.
00:43:35.898 - 00:44:32.526, Speaker B: Direction where eleven X sounds like a lot but Bitcoin moves in really intense cycles where we've all seen it go from 1000 to 10,000 or 20,000. When that happens, that means there's not an equivalent but a directional rise in transactions and transaction fees. And so we have seen transaction fees replace the subsidy over time. And so it very much is trending in the right direction to where over the next couple of having cycles we should see it start to predominantly be the value that is compensated to the miners in the block reward. Now, we certainly can't predict the future. We do not know if there will be future speculative bubbles or what bitcoin's future adoption rate should be. But if bitcoin doesn't become adopted, if it remains a more niche sort of service for humankind where only, let's say, 20 million people use it well, then its long term security will be weak.
00:44:32.526 - 00:44:56.074, Speaker B: And I think that's what's really interesting. And people worry about like, oh well, if bitcoin is the world reserve currency and it doesn't have a strong security model, like there's not a lot of monetary compensation in the block reward due to transaction fees, well, will that be a bad scenario? It's an impossible scenario because if it is the world reserve currency, there'll be very many layer one transaction fees, right?
00:44:56.112 - 00:45:16.826, Speaker A: But what I'm asking is because the number of layer one transactions is limited. And right now I feel like a lot of the scaling is focusing on L2. So I just wonder, will layer one be big enough to handle the amount of transactions that will need to be on layer one in order for the miners to get enough fees to be in?
00:45:16.868 - 00:46:19.974, Speaker C: Can I add a different perspective here that blends the two topics of monetary policy and the technical implementation? Maybe then you can jump on that topic as well. From my perspective, the monetary policy creates a very specific microeconomic environment. If you think about the commodity of money that is bitcoin, there's supply and demand. Supply, because of bitcoin's monetary policy is fixed and diminishing, tapering off asymptomatically and ultimately capped. And demand is variable and the equilibrium between the two is the bitcoin price. Now, if you think about that market, one of its characteristics, its strongest characteristic and what gives it all of this FOMO, is the concept of an inelastic market response. The supply cannot adapt to a change in price.
00:46:19.974 - 00:47:04.420, Speaker C: If you take something else, potatoes, and suddenly potatoes are worth $1,000 a spud. Well, my garden right on front here is getting plowed up and I'm planting potatoes. So the price causes an immediate response in the market where production of that good increases proportionately to the demand and the price acts as a mechanism, a signaling mechanism to encourage production of that good. Now think about bitcoin supply. So price goes up, same amount of bitcoin, in fact, less after four years is going to be produced. There is no elasticity, there will not be a response in production. So that's the monetary policy.
00:47:04.420 - 00:48:28.266, Speaker C: The same game plays out in transaction fees. And most people don't really see this. But if you think about block capacity, the space for transactions that exist in a block that is also fairly inelastic, perhaps not as inelastic as the bitcoin supply and it's not diminishing over time, but it is still inelastic, in that there is a limit and that limit does not respond to surges in demand. So when demand goes up for block capacity, that is a market, it's a microeconomics market determined by the supply of block space, by miners, which is fixed, and the demand for transaction capacity which varies based on price signal and also varies based on some optimizations in how transactions are stored, but not that much. So when you have these spikes that Dan was describing, what that does is it pushes up the transaction fee as everybody's trying to cram into this one tiny block, all of the transactions because of FOMO and so the price responds accordingly because you have this inelastic block supply. The question is, are these two inelastic supplies the same? And they're not. The block space is actually fixed, but it's not diminishing.
00:48:28.266 - 00:49:20.202, Speaker C: There are some aspects of this that create some concerns for the future. One of them is the fact that miners can collude in some very creative ways. They can, first of all, collude to restrict supply further and for the capacity of the block. Instead of mining blocks that have a megabyte of or two meg's weight of transactions in them, they can mine blocks that have fewer transactions all the way to the extreme of mining empty blocks. They can do this like an OPEC of miners, where they collude to reduce the space that they occupy in the block, thereby driving up transaction fees. And this can be profitable, just like OPEC is profitable for the oil producing countries. And it's very difficult to break out of that collusion.
00:49:20.202 - 00:50:13.374, Speaker C: The other thing miners can do, which is very interesting, is they can occupy some of that space by basically rigging the auction. If you think about it, the block space is auctioned off to people who bid with their transaction fee and hope to get in. That type of auction has an obvious problem, which is that you can have, what do you call, ringers in the auction. A miner can put a transaction up for confirmation with a very high fee, driving all of the other transaction bidders to increase their bids to compete against that. And then if that transaction is included in the block and that miner has enough hash rate, they have a pretty good chance of paying themselves. Which means this is a low cost. That depends on how much hash rate they have.
00:50:13.374 - 00:51:11.410, Speaker C: But again, this is a tremendous opportunity for collusion because if most miners do that, they're either getting paid when they win the block from their own transactions that they use to rig the auction, or they're getting paid by the other miners, someone's getting paid. So then it's a very low cost way to create essentially a cartel for the block capacity. These are real problems and there are a number of proposed solutions, including advocating for a block size increase, which has other undesirable side effects. But I think it's important to note that these things are not finished. It is quite possible that over time the block size may be increased. If there's enough demand for that, the consensus on that can change. But the consensus on the 21 million coins, in my opinion, cannot change because to me that's a defining characteristic of what Bitcoin is.
00:51:11.410 - 00:52:06.360, Speaker C: If you create a coin that has 22 million coins issuance, you can do that using the Bitcoin code base. No one will call it Bitcoin and there will still be a number of people who will remain on the one that has a 21 million cap and everyone will call that Bitcoin. So in the end, the only way you can change that number is by forking off another coin that's less valuable, not a winning solution. However, in the block market, the inelastic supply can be dealt with with broad consensus. So over time, people may agree and say, you know what? At this point the technology has gone up and we can afford to do four meg blocks. I don't know. It's a very controversial topic, but I think it's important to recognize the similarities of the inelastic supply between these two markets, but also the differences in how critical these are in terms of principled aspects of consensus and how unchanging they might be.
00:52:07.130 - 00:52:07.542, Speaker B: Okay.
00:52:07.596 - 00:52:26.460, Speaker A: Yeah. So it sounds like you think it is possible people might consider that because or rather, it's possible that the amount in transaction fees will maybe not be enough on layer one to replace the block reward when the time comes.
00:52:26.910 - 00:53:07.158, Speaker C: Okay, well, two things. First of all and I think this is by the way, this is the number one question I get. For the past eight years, all I've been doing is answering questions about bitcoin. The most common question I get is what happens in 140 years when block subsidy stops? And the most important part of this answer is, it doesn't happen in 140 years. It happens today and tomorrow and the day after. Every single day, miners are making the profitability calculation and they are taking into consideration the ratio of fees to subsidy and the current price of bitcoin to decide if they're profitable and adjust their hash rate. There is no cliff moment where this happens.
00:53:07.158 - 00:53:51.862, Speaker C: This happened in 2017, it's happening today. It will continue to happen every day. And so this equilibrium is dynamically, moving through bitcoin with a heartbeat of 10 minutes every single day. The question is, are fees enough today to maintain the current level of security we need today in ratio to block subsidy? And given the hash rate today, the answer the miners have given us is yes. Resoundingly yes. So then we look at tomorrow. And so over time, though, this may lead to moments where you have very expensive transactions, and that tests the market.
00:53:51.862 - 00:54:23.306, Speaker C: It tests the market because it puts the use of bitcoin as a transactional medium of exchange against the use of bitcoin as the FOMO engine of stored value. In those moments, it becomes a less useful transactional medium of exchange precisely because it has suddenly become such an incredibly powerful FOMO mechanism for stored value. So it's not one or the other, it's a shift.
00:54:23.498 - 00:55:22.030, Speaker B: Okay, I've got a great thought to append to Andreas's direction here. So Nick Carter wrote a really good article a few weeks ago about this with ethereum and bitcoin has know, they both have this fixed parcel of land, this block space, and we are all bidding to get into that block space. So all of the bidders, whether whatever store, if your store of value medium of exchange or CryptoKitties use case, you are bidding for that fixed parcel of real estate, and so you're bidding to get a spot on that piece of real estate. Now, when we look at Bitcoin. Bitcoin has two primary use cases, which are store value goal 2.0, and there is the transactional use case if you want to send large amounts of money across borders. What's interesting is that for both Ethereum and bitcoin, as transaction fees rise, which I think everyone's very acutely aware of, over the last few months on Ethereum, they've risen to all time highs.
00:55:22.030 - 00:56:17.606, Speaker B: Bitcoin is similarly high relative to historical fees. As those rise, the use cases that move the largest amounts of money, which are likely to be more store of value, or maybe like very large smart contract use cases, those will outbid every other use case. So it's a really interesting thing to think about, because for bitcoin as Andreas brought up the store of value more FOMO or Gold 2.0 folks, if that rises and becomes very popular again, and it's always been popular. But as that crowds out that fixed real estate, it'll push out the medium of exchange use cases because they'll be able to pay more in transaction fees. For example, if I'm wanting to send a million dollars, I'm fine with paying $100 transaction fee. But if I'm trying to pay for my Netflix, using bitcoin, $100 transaction fee is super onerous, so I'm not going to do that.
00:56:17.708 - 00:56:50.480, Speaker A: Right, but is this kind of against the original vision of bitcoin, then? Because I think a lot of people like the idea of bitcoin because they think of it as democratizing access to finance. And there is a fly, by the way, for the people who are watching the video. There is a fly in my room. It is attacking my face. I don't know what's going on. But is it possible to fulfill that vision of democratizing finance for everyday people if it's only reduced to people who want to send a million dollars worth of bitcoin being able to do so?
00:56:50.930 - 00:57:30.554, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I wrote a comprehensive thread on Satoshi's intentions when he launched bitcoin. I mean, I don't think any of us can go back and weigh those intentions and then weigh those perfectly and spit out like, this was 100% Satoshi's intention. I mean, Satoshi the first message. That the only message he ever put in the bitcoin blockchain is UK Chancellor on the verge of second bailout for banks, not visa, on the verge of raising processing fees. There's also, like, he references that bitcoin is digital gold four or five times, or he calls it a precious metal. Sorry. And there's also some functional aspects, like the monetary policy has no supply response, which makes it very poor as a medium of exchange because it's not a stable unit of account.
00:57:30.554 - 00:57:43.538, Speaker B: It's hard for people to mentally reconcile, like, oh, I have to remeasure certain items that I'm purchasing. I have to remeasure the purchasing power of my coin constantly. It's a deeply nuanced topic, but I.
00:57:43.544 - 00:58:36.482, Speaker C: Have a slightly different perspective on this. If I may interrupt. These two visions are not only not a direct trade off, but in fact, they're highly synergistic. Here's the thing. Democratizing access to money makes sense if that money cannot be subjected to prior restraint, confiscation, freezing and shutdown. The ability to make a transaction at will through the democratization of money has to assume an environment in which there is an adversarial relationship with those who do not want you to democratize the access to money. And if you ignore that adversarial relationship, then you can assume this is a simple trade off, which is, listen, it's okay.
00:58:36.482 - 00:59:47.080, Speaker C: What we do is we just increase the capacity, make transactions cheaper, and then we democratize access to money. The problem is that what you've done in that trade off is you've required the money to become more permissioned, less resistant to prior restraint, and less resistant to various types of censorship attacks. What ends up happening is exactly what has already happened. Most recently in Zimbabwe, you have these incredibly versatile microtransaction platforms for mobile digital pay, and then when those threaten the stability of the financial system of Zimbabwe's Kalptocracy, they remove permission, and those things are shut down. Now, these people also don't have democratic access to money, and they don't have democratic access to money even though they had a platform for very low fee transactions. You can't separate the two. The reason that trade off is important is because unless you have a system that cannot be shut down, having a system that's cheap is worth nothing.
00:59:47.080 - 01:00:23.700, Speaker C: The cheap system that can be shut down will be shut down at precisely the moment when you need it not to be shut down. And I think people don't appreciate the fact that we are operating in a currency environment that is becoming even more so adversarial than it already is. This is not simply a matter of playing nice. When you're dealing with considerations that go far beyond the transaction fee, having a low transaction fee without a network to run it on isn't a useful property of money.
01:00:25.050 - 01:01:06.190, Speaker A: Well, so I did want to ask a little bit more about this. What's it called medium of exchange? Use of bitcoin? Is the monetary policy of bitcoin conducive to it being a medium of exchange, because I'm sure you guys are aware a lot of people will say, oh, I don't want to use bitcoin to buy coffee, because then a year or two from now, I'll realize that I had bought myself $100 a cup of coffee. So I wondered, do you think that we'll see it being used more and more as a store of value and not really see the medium of exchange use gain adoption?
01:01:07.010 - 01:01:43.934, Speaker B: Yeah. Marad a really famous trader in the space. He developed a graph that shows it's a very rough graph, and it's more for visualization purposes, but it shows the evolution of bitcoin through time. Just like a tree or just like a person goes through stages of development from being a young child to becoming a teenager and an adult in a tree growing up and becoming stronger and stronger and bigger. Bitcoin over time has different characteristics. So due to Bitcoin's lack of supply, response to increases in demand, that makes the price very volatile. That volatility in price makes it very, very hard to be a unit of account.
01:01:43.934 - 01:02:19.020, Speaker B: The unit of account is great with Bitcoin in terms of our precise measurement of how many coins are out there. There's 21 million, and that gives us a very precise ruler or measuring stick. However, the purchasing power fluctuates constantly. So bitcoin acting as a dollar substitute or a replacement for a world reserve currency in that unit of count aspect, from a stable purchasing power perspective, is very far away. I think that is many, many decades bitcoin's use as a speculative store of value. It's had that use case since day one. It's very, very good at that.
01:02:19.020 - 01:03:04.150, Speaker B: The increase in speculation increases awareness and adoption, which then drives to Andres'point, then drives medium of exchange. The more and more people who hold bitcoin means that the price goes higher and higher, which means that the market cap is higher, the liquidity is deeper. Eventually, volatility should start to decrease over many decades, which makes the purchasing power more predictable and easier to understand and use in a day to day basis. So I see it as like a multidecade evolution of a store value. Store value plus medium exchange. Medium exchange, store value plus unit of account many decades later. So I see it as like there isn't a clear cut, like, oh, it's only useful for this at this moment.
01:03:04.150 - 01:03:36.820, Speaker B: It's more of a gradient over time of which one becomes more or less useful. But as we see with transaction fees, to me it seems very clear that bitcoin over the next decade or so and intel L2, technology becomes more prevalent and very widespread and easy to use. That bitcoin's primary use case will be store of value in the next bull run. As transaction fees largely probably go past $50 or $100 per transaction, that crowds out pretty much everything else other than store of value.
01:03:37.510 - 01:04:23.054, Speaker C: I disagree slightly in that I think there is a function of medium exchange today, and it does exist, but it depends on your context and perspective. So there's two aspects to this context. The assumption can I or should I use it to buy a cup of coffee? Comes with a set of assumptions around it that are very specific, and it's probably the worst example to use. And I am totally guilty. This is the number one example in my book, and it was obsolete the moment I wrote it. We need to stop thinking about buying cup of coffee as the primary activity of a medium of exchange system. Buying a ticket out of Syria may be a much more interesting use in that context.
01:04:23.054 - 01:04:50.922, Speaker C: At that point, as a medium of. Exchange. It is all powerful. I think there's two presumptions or pre assumptions that come to this context. The first one is, at the moment, bitcoin for most of its users, acts as an intermediary economy where you pass things through bitcoin on the way to somewhere else. So you start with Fiat. You own, earn and live in the Fiat world.
01:04:50.922 - 01:05:47.078, Speaker C: You take the Fiat, you transmute it into bitcoin, and then you either hold it or you convert it into something else, usually by converting it back into Fiat after it's traveled somewhere. So this is the bitcoin as rails perspective. When you look at it from that perspective, the economics really make it very challenging to use the medium of exchange if you're coming from Fiat and ending up in Fiat. If bitcoin is simply a highway that has on ramps and off ramps, but most of your life is lived in the neighborhoods, that's a whole different ballgame. I can tell you from experience, as someone who lives in the bitcoin economy and treats it as a circular economy, the hoarding instinct and volatility and remorse of buying a cup of coffee reverse themselves very, very quickly. And here's why. I don't buy bitcoin.
01:05:47.078 - 01:06:44.698, Speaker C: I earn it. I earn it through my labor and through my entrepreneurial activities. So when I earn bitcoin directly, not as Fiat, the price volatility works both ways. It cuts both ways. When I pay payroll at the end of the month for my employees and contractors, suppliers, et cetera, if the price has gone up, that really works nicely for me because I give out less of my bitcoin in order to fulfill my liabilities. But at the same time, if I'm getting paid next month and the price of bitcoin goes up, I receive less bitcoin for the thing I charge because my unit of account is still Fiat. So if I'm in that circular economy, the volatility in purchasing power works for me on liabilities and against me on my receivables, on my income.
01:06:44.698 - 01:07:48.718, Speaker C: And if you take it over a long period of time, it's a wash. I have used bitcoin in a circular economy like that since it was less than $10 per bitcoin up until last week, when I did my payables for the mid month payables. From that perspective, all of that goes away. I don't have remorse because, yes, I paid $1,000 for a cup of coffee, but I also got paid $10,000 an hour that month. It balances out. So the perspective of I'm an affluent American who has access to alternative mechanisms of payment and I mostly live in the US dollar economy, visiting bitcoin as a tourist is very different from the perspective of living in a circular economy. And even more importantly for all of those people who do not have the comparables the alternative mechanisms of payment, it's easy to say I'm not buying a cup of coffee with bitcoin.
01:07:48.718 - 01:08:12.410, Speaker C: I'm going to use X. When X exists when x doesn't exist or when x is Zimbabwe dollars, then that equation may change rather dramatically. And I've heard this from a number of people who don't live in the environment where they have 20 other things to choose from that are actually pretty damn good as medium of exchange.
01:08:13.150 - 01:08:30.990, Speaker B: Yeah, I certainly live in a privileged environment and country. I live in San Francisco, which out of all the cities in the world, we're very affluent. So totally understand that. I come from a different perspective. I was there with you when we worked@blockchain.com in 2014 and blockchain.com paid everyone in bitcoin.
01:08:30.990 - 01:09:17.194, Speaker B: I was there while I saw thousands of bitcoin businesses struggle as demand decreased after the 2013 bull run and the price decreased. So the price is a function of price as it increases, increases demand. Bitcoin operates in a really interesting way as that price becomes that signal to the market, like, hey, come pay attention to this. But it also signals to the businesses like, hey, be prepared as the price goes down. Be prepared for a drop in your customers. And it's really hard when bitcoin businesses, when they had, let's say you're getting paid in bitcoin, like this circular economy idea where everyone gets paid in bitcoin, you receive your income like your revenue in bitcoin. It becomes very tricky when the price is so volatile to plan out a business operation.
01:09:17.194 - 01:09:58.380, Speaker B: So let's say I want to deploy a million dollars to go build a building, and the price of bitcoin is at $1,000. Well, if it drops to $500 now, I may not be able to finance that operation and maybe I can't make that decision within one day because I need to talk to many different stakeholders internally, get legal to sign off, get the permitting in place. So bitcoin for a business purpose is really tough. I experienced it at my own startup, zero block, which we sold to blockchain.com. I saw that blockchain. That's why we have that more unit of account currency like the dollar used for business is because it makes it easy for business planning purposes. It is predictably decreasing in value over time.
01:09:58.380 - 01:09:59.546, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:09:59.568 - 01:10:35.446, Speaker C: And any sensible business will not operate in one currency, nor will it keep its treasury assets in one currency. Diversification applies on a business level just as much as it applies on a personal level. And I don't keep all of my business treasury assets in bitcoin, or at the same time, I don't keep it all in dollars. And being able to diversify and take different levels of risk accordingly actually gives me has given me at least some great results over time. But it does take a longer term approach and it is very difficult to do planning with a volatile asset. I agree with that.
01:10:35.548 - 01:11:12.740, Speaker A: So I was curious. We've been talking about bitcoin being used as a medium of exchange or store of value unit of account. I was so curious because the idea that bitcoin works as a store of value is probably one of the predominant narratives around bitcoin. But then obviously we saw with Black Thursday earlier this year in March, when bitcoin was actually surprisingly correlated with the broader markets and did experience a precipitous drop on March twelveTH. Why do you think that investors actually did not turn to bitcoin at that time, but instead sold it? And how does that affect that theory about bitcoin being a store of value?
01:11:13.430 - 01:11:51.374, Speaker B: It's a great question. A lot of people bring this up, which is, hey, bitcoin sold off, while the risk on assets like equities also sold off. Doesn't that conflict with the idea that bitcoin is a good store of value? But when we see a liquidity crunch, which is what back in March, what we saw there with a huge decrease in equities and bitcoin price, that was a liquidity crunch and we saw Gold sell off tremendously. And Gold is a 4000 year old store of value. I mean, it is one of the oldest stores of value still in existence that humankind uses. So gold also sold off. I don't think that because Gold sold off.
01:11:51.374 - 01:12:35.040, Speaker B: Does that make Gold a poor store of value? No, I think in a liquidity crunch, everyone is selling everything they can get their hands on to meet their margin calls. There's a series of cascading margin calls that were essentially crunched and crunched the market to where people are enduring this liquidity crunch and they're selling everything they have to meet those margin calls. Now, what we've seen in 2008 and now is that after that moment, months and years later, then the store of value assets like Gold start to perform. As people start to price in inflation concerns and pricing concerns over the monetary policy of their government, then those store value assets start to rise. And so I don't think we're going to see that impact on bitcoin's price materially until six to twelve months from now.
01:12:35.490 - 01:14:18.474, Speaker C: I think another factor that's playing in this is that what we've seen over the past ten years at least, is an unprecedented injection of liquidity in pretty much all of the global economy, but especially in the United States. What that has done is it distorts markets by creating an environment in which more and more and more assets become correlated, not just to each other, but effectively they become correlated to one and only one action, which is the degree of stimulus that is being anticipated at the next Fed meeting. And it creates these weird phenomena. Like good news is bad news because it will lead to less stimulus, and bad news is good news because it will lead to more stimulus, and essentially more and more of the assets become correlated to that one aspect of stimulus. Investors who have undergone this battle to find yield and keep looking in dustier and dustier corners of their portfolio to find yield because they can't generate yield because money is free and everyone's chasing yield and there's too much money out there. They will use bitcoin and other crypto assets of various types to chase yield and that does correlate bitcoin closer to all of the other assets because it's responding to the same incentives. The majority of people who are invested in bitcoin in every bubble are not there because they understand the principles of Austrian economics and sound money and the technological robustness of bitcoin.
01:14:18.474 - 01:15:12.394, Speaker C: They're there because to the moon. Coin went up, number go up, yay FOMO. But that kind of speculative behavior is both incredibly useful and very valid. But what it means is that those investors who chase yield will chase yield into crypto just as much as the other places. Crypto is experiencing asset inflation as a result of too much money sloshing around in an investor community, especially in the United States. And when there is a supply crunch, when there is a liquidity crunch, as Dan described, everything goes on the table and bitcoin as one of the riskier, more volatile assets and because of its inelastic behavior will drop harder and faster than all of the other assets. In the short term, that is normal behavior.
01:15:12.394 - 01:16:21.158, Speaker C: And in fact, if you looked at most of the people who are talking about this, they had predicted that the disaster glee that you see in some bitcoin circles where it's like I hope the economy crashes because then bitcoin is going to the moon and I'll have bags. That disaster romanticism is both creepy as well as irrational because in the short term, exactly the opposite happens. In the short term, bitcoin does get sold off just as hard as the other assets and probably harder because it has this extreme volatility. There are no mechanisms to stop it from dropping just as hard. So I think this is predicted behavior. Bitcoin is currently much more correlated to other assets than it's ever been before, I think. And in the short term it is going to bounce around with the rest of the economy because scared investors are going to pull their money out of everything but short term and long term, two different things.
01:16:21.324 - 01:17:53.282, Speaker A: I also want to talk about something else that in a similar vein is just a question around kind of how things will go against a pretty popular theory. So I'm sure you guys both know of this stock to flow model which really made the rounds and people really glomped onto and it's basically saying that the amount of new bitcoin, the ratio of existing bitcoin to new bitcoin being created will affect the price. And so as that ratio, I guess it would be that it increases because the number of new bitcoins will be decreasing, that we should see the price go up at the same time, however. So after this came out, I don't know if you guys saw, there was a column by Nico Cordero, the chief investment officer and fund manager at Strix. Leviathan and he published an article kind of saying that the premise of this stock to flow model, which is based on stock to flow in gold and how historically that has correlated to the price of gold. He said, well, actually the author cherry picked the points and when you look at historical data and he said, quote, gold's market capitalization held valuations between 60 billion and 9 trillion all at the same stock to flow value of 60. And he said a range of 8 trillion is not very indicative of explanatory power and lends itself to the obvious conclusion that other factors drive gold's US.
01:17:53.282 - 01:18:02.150, Speaker A: Dollar valuation. So do you guys think that the stock to flow model works for bitcoin or what's your take on this theory?
01:18:03.130 - 01:19:15.434, Speaker C: I find it interesting as a descriptive mechanism to understand the concept of hardness of money. But I don't pay particularly attention as a predictive theory to help explain or predict future price movements. I think hardness of money is an important, a very important characteristic of money, but it's not the only characteristic of money. And money operates in an environment of irrational human beings. I think the whole rational market actor hypothesis, which is clearly debunked, could support a theory like stock to flow. But the problem is that people respond to money and other market things in irrational ways and they evaluate risk in irrational ways. They far bias, avoiding loss over gaining reward.
01:19:15.434 - 01:19:41.094, Speaker C: And so we know that these irrational behaviors result in weird effects in markets. So, yeah, great. I mean, stock to flow explains why hard money is hard and it also gives us a way to understand the hardness of bitcoin vis a vis other forms of money. I wouldn't take that to be a gospel as to how the price is going to play out at all.
01:19:41.212 - 01:20:22.382, Speaker B: No one can predict the future. I don't think any model can out there. It certainly might give us some insight into, trajectory wise what bitcoin might look like. But I certainly don't prescribe or really weight any sort of model, whether it be stock to flow or any other one, as having superior or very high level of predictability. I personally find it very interesting because it models out scarcity and it models out the hardness of money and attempts to look at that, looking at precious metals. And I think that's pretty fascinating that we go through that sort of analysis. And that's what makes the bitcoin community really cool is I love the in depth economic research done by a wide variety of different individuals where they go explore these different topics.
01:20:22.382 - 01:20:35.910, Speaker B: So I haven't dug super deep into the nuances of how predictable it is. I know there's some controversy as to some folks don't like the methodology or there's some holes or flaws in it. I personally haven't dug in super, super deep.
01:20:36.330 - 01:21:31.126, Speaker C: I would say it does relate to the point I was making earlier, which is that new things require new analytical tools. This is a useful analytical framework that gives us some insights into the hardness of bitcoin in terms that we can understand in something like bitcoin that is entirely novel in every other characteristic. The reason it's not predictive, in my opinion, is because there are so many other things to take into account and so many things that remain unanswered. We don't know how the fee market is going to play out. We don't know how bitcoin's privacy characteristics, which are rather weak, are going to play out. And most importantly, we don't know how the geopolitical environment of currency wars is going to play out in the broader $150,000,000,000,000 market that is the planet. And bitcoin exists in a vacuum.
01:21:31.126 - 01:22:29.770, Speaker C: It exists in that soup of competing forces. And how it plays out will depend on a lot of other factors of which bitcoin's inherent characteristics or design trade offs are only a small, small part. No one can account for unforeseen events. How does bitcoin respond to a pandemic? That's not a question we were asking eight months ago. How does the dollar respond to a pandemic? What is China going to do next? We don't know the answer to any of these questions. The geopolitical battle of currencies has been heating up for a decade, but it has now reached a point that we've never seen before. So that's why I think these models, interesting as they are, are basically operating only a very small part of the broader picture.
01:22:29.770 - 01:23:01.490, Speaker C: Well, I think there is a tendency in our industry to look for easy, comforting answers and take things as gospel. I think that's a very dangerous tendency. This is still an experiment and it's gone better than I anticipated and is astonishingly intricate and operates very well. But that doesn't mean that it will always go like that, and it doesn't mean that it can't stumble.
01:23:01.650 - 01:23:43.378, Speaker A: Yeah. So this is actually where I wanted to take the conversation next, is to ask about these different geopolitical forces right now, because obviously with the coronavirus and this unprecedented quantitative easing, and now this recent announcement by the Fed that they're going to target an average 2% inflation rate. And if that means letting inflation run higher than that for a little while, then that's what they'll do to achieve that. So given all these factors or any other macro forces that you see that could intersect with bitcoin in an interesting way, how do you think these things will affect bitcoin's adoption and price over the next one or two years?
01:23:43.544 - 01:24:42.486, Speaker B: I mean, bitcoin is now such a large from when we were in it way back, when it was worth $10. The evolution of bitcoin or bitcoin getting to this level of adoption, liquidity awareness. We've got a bunch of macro folks like Raul Powell and others really digging in and talking about Dan piro. These guys really dig in, talk about bitcoin from a classical macro perspective, bitcoin is becoming intertwined with everything. As bitcoin grows larger and larger, it becomes part of every geopolitical conversation, it becomes part of every currency conversation, et cetera. So I think that when we look towards bitcoin's future, it will be intertwined with many different actions in the economy. I remember back in 2013, I think it was 13, where Cyprus was the big narrative in bitcoin about how bitcoin could help the Cyprus population for them to get access to basic fundamental economic rights of storing value and being yeah.
01:24:42.508 - 01:24:47.026, Speaker C: The bail ins that were happening at the time, they got a haircut on their bank accounts.
01:24:47.218 - 01:25:16.142, Speaker B: And that was a big narrative driver for bitcoin back in 2013. And so I think as bitcoin grows larger, we're seeing bitcoin hit the Bloomberg headlines on a weekly basis, which is incredible. I remember in 2014, we went to Bloomberg and we're like, wow, this is going to be one of the first times we talk about bitcoin at Bloomberg. And to see it evolve this far to where it's part of, like, I mean, Trump, even the President of the United States talked about it. You also had I feel you, Andreas.
01:25:16.286 - 01:25:28.280, Speaker C: No, I'm thinking back when you said 2014, I'm like, in 2014, Bloomberg invited me as a financial analyst. I mean, imagine how empty the barrel was.
01:25:28.970 - 01:25:40.890, Speaker A: Well, Andreas, you're actually a really great speaker for bitcoin, so I wouldn't be so self deprecating. But actually, I think when you covered your face, I thought that was in response to Dan's comment about Trump tweeting.
01:25:43.630 - 01:25:46.620, Speaker C: That too. Yeah, that too.
01:25:48.270 - 01:26:15.090, Speaker B: We have Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, say that bitcoin is a speculative store of value. I mean, that's incredible. It's a very nerdy, very niche group of people on bitcoin talk forums to the highest degree of awareness in terms of the big stakeholders in the mainstream economy. So bitcoin will be intimately involved in many major geopolitical conversations in the future. Is the TLDR.
01:26:17.130 - 01:27:05.250, Speaker C: You mentioned the Fed targeting average inflation rates of 2%? And I found that fascinating because the word average is very misleading, because most people have an intuitive understanding of what the word average means. And that intuitive understanding is almost always completely incorrect. Let me give you an example. The average person has a greater than average number of arms. Why? Because there are a lot of people with one or no arms, and there aren't that many people with three, which means that two arms is a greater than average number of arms, not the average. The average is 1.8 or something like that, if you do the math.
01:27:05.250 - 01:28:09.350, Speaker C: And this fact relates to the Fed in a sideways manner as follows in order to get an average of 2%, given the fact that over the past ten years we've been dragging along at somewhere between 0.5 and 1.5, that means that they have to go way above 2% in order for the average to calibrate at two. And so when people hear the Fed is targeting an average of 2%, they think, okay, so they're going to set the rate at two, and that will be the average. No, they're going to have to set it much higher in order to drag it out in an environment where there are very, very strong deflationary pressures at the moment. Deflationary not because of value appreciation of the dollar, but because of a catastrophic collapse in demand, which is the same kind of deflationary thing you saw in the lost decades of Japan. That the bad kind of deflationary pressure.
01:28:09.350 - 01:29:23.194, Speaker C: So in the face of catastrophic collapse in demand, because apparently people who don't have money can't buy shit, the end result is that the Fed has to pull much higher than 2% to reach an average of 2%. This is going to have really significant consequences. Because when you apply these types of percentage numbers to an economy the size of the United States, and you have the momentum of that economy dragging it into the future, when you realize you have overshot that target, that's because you're on the other end of the elbow of the exponential curve, and it's way too late. So this is very dangerous territory, and it's unprecedented. I think the word unprecedented during pandemic has been overused, but in monetary terms, we are going through a monetary pandemic that is indeed unprecedented, and nobody knows how that's going to play out. So when I used to start my speeches about bitcoin, I used to say, let me tell you about the world's most radical and unprecedented monetary experiment, and it's not bitcoin, it's fiat. We have never done this shit before.
01:29:23.194 - 01:29:48.600, Speaker C: This is a system that has only existed for 70, 80, 90 years. And we don't know how it works under the current conditions any more than we know how our climate works of 450 parts per million of carbon dioxide. We've never been here before. It might work great, but it's very dangerous when you're talking about $150,000,000,000,000 economy, when the answer is we don't know.
01:29:49.290 - 01:30:51.930, Speaker A: And one other thing that I wanted to ask about the future and where things are going, and this really intersects with our conversations about the economy going kind of in a more deflationary direction, such as what happened in Japan versus inflationary. So we're seeing these new innovations come online next year, such as Kraken Financial, which is the arm of Kraken that will be opening as the first crypto bank. And as such, it will not conduct fractional reserve banking and it will not lend, which obviously is not how normal commercial banks operate. So let's say over the next ten years, or even five years, that there's an increase in the number of crypto banks that exist, and they do not engage in fractional reserve banking. And that becomes a big trend. How do you think that would change the economy? Would it dampen entrepreneurship or I just wonder. We've been saying that Bitcoin can have a deflationary aspect to it or disinflationary, as Dan mentioned.
01:30:51.930 - 01:31:04.560, Speaker A: And we've been talking about the downsides of that with what happened in Japan. And yet at the same time, we also know the downfalls of inflationary economies. So when you throw this into the mix, what do you think will happen?
01:31:05.090 - 01:31:13.950, Speaker B: While Kraken may be full reserve, there will be other banks that decide to be fractional reserve, and they'll compensate the risk that their depositors are taking through giving them an increased yield.
01:31:14.030 - 01:31:23.750, Speaker A: Right. But those won't be crypto banks because to qualify for the charter that Kraken Financial got, they have to keep full reserves. So you're talking about like a normal bank?
01:31:24.250 - 01:32:06.230, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm talking about how if we're competing for customers, you're going to have full reserve banks, you're going to have fractional reserve banks. And there are different advantageous setups with each one. And with the fractional reserve banks, they're going to have certain where they lend out. You deposit your money at a bank, they take those deposits and they lend them out, and then they give you a return. It's likely that those banks will be able to offer you a higher rate of return than, say, a full fractional reserve bank that does not lend out any money. So there are advantages and disadvantageous traits of both a fractional reserve and full reserve bank. With Kraken, we see this as an opportunity to layer on many other new types of functions for our customers.
01:32:06.230 - 01:32:47.860, Speaker B: We are now much more tied into the banking system. We can get around certain sort of choke points in the regulatory models where before we would have to rely on someone else. So now we can have a more direct relationship with the mainstream economy. That way we can offer more services to our customers. There's a wide variety of things that we're exploring there. I can't really dig in or give any sort of concrete details as to what that feature or what that function might be. Just know that this is a giant leap forward in terms of a much more intimate, deeper, stronger, tied to the mainstream economy that enables us to offer more crypto services.
01:32:49.430 - 01:34:00.140, Speaker C: I want to add to that, which is that the fractional reserve banking is tied very closely to the monetary policy. If you take something that has the monetary policy of Bitcoin, lending it out is an extremely risky business. Very risky, not just for the lender, but also for the borrower. Taking out a loan in Bitcoin that has to be repaid in Bitcoin, given both volatility the opportunity of a FOMO bubble event appreciation storm, the overall deflationary characteristics, this is not a monetary system designed for lending. I think one of the challenges we have in this space is that people take a monopolistic money system that they understand, which is the Fiat system. 194 countries, 194 flags, 194 colorful currencies, and monetary policies and they think of that in terms of a zero sum game or a winner take all system. And from that perspective, you would arrive at the conclusion that, okay, so when bitcoin replaces all money, then x happens.
01:34:00.140 - 01:35:06.110, Speaker C: And I don't think that's ever the case. I think in fact, that what bitcoin did was that it created a mechanism by which various types of monies can be created with various types of monetary policies. Bitcoin has an extremely opinionated point of view on monetary policy, which is very suitable for certain things, but I don't think that becomes the monopoly dominant system. I don't see any reason why it would. It can become the dominant system for saving, but that doesn't mean that there aren't other monies, both national fiat and other monies that exist in other cryptocurrencies and those may have very different monetary policies and may offer opportunities for lending and things like that. Now that will mean that they're not a sound money. So I'm not really worried about this scenario of what happens if all money is bitcoin and therefore lending and entrepreneurial activity stops, not even what happens if bitcoin is the dominant form of money.
01:35:06.110 - 01:35:44.278, Speaker C: We are so very far from that and don't really have the tools to analyze it. I think we're past the era of a limited number of monies in our planet. We are now in an era of many different systems. And again, this is very controversial and I keep getting flak for this. That doesn't mean that's what I want. That doesn't mean that's what I hope for. I am simply recognizing what is actually happening, which is humans in their irrational stupidity are going out and creating monies with stupid names that they're giving to their friends and other people and then they're pursuing these things even though they most likely have very, very poor value characteristics.
01:35:44.278 - 01:36:30.998, Speaker C: I am recognizing that this is happening and I'm recognizing that this is part of human behavior and will likely continue to happen. And we just have to accept that that doesn't mean that bitcoin is any less in exactly the same way that the Zimbabwe dollar doing stupid stuff with their economy doesn't change the US economy. Just because there's other money out there that is doing other things doesn't change the value proposition of a money that has a different monetary policy. There can be other cryptocurrencies doing very crazy monetary policies that doesn't remove the value of bitcoin, but it also doesn't mean that the others are going to go away. They're not because of human nature.
01:36:31.174 - 01:36:39.740, Speaker B: Yeah, I do think the experimentation allows us to explore in like a black scholes model esque way of what monetary policies don't work.
01:36:40.430 - 01:36:41.930, Speaker A: Explain black scholes.
01:36:42.510 - 01:37:11.622, Speaker B: Black scholes models is like simply a random walk. Like how we go through pricing options. It's how we look at modeling out future steps. So we go, okay, well, what if we took every single random variation from. This current moment of a price and modeled that out. And so with the different cryptocurrencies that have existed over the last eight years that I've been in this space, I've seen about like 10,000 cryptocurrencies come and go. So we've certainly seen that is never going to stop.
01:37:11.622 - 01:37:27.402, Speaker B: There will always be new cryptocurrencies created from a more Bitcoinery perspective. I mean, I've tried out things like I've owned ethereum, I've mined prime coin. I thought prime coin. Andreas probably remembers that it's a coin from back in the 14 era, a long, long time ago.
01:37:27.456 - 01:37:30.860, Speaker A: But it has something to do with prime numbers.
01:37:31.310 - 01:38:03.798, Speaker B: Yeah, using proof of work to find prime numbers. I thought it was more useful back when I didn't understand proof of work fully. These were all experiments, and there's so many of them. That's why I call it more of like a black shoals, because there's so many random variations of monetary policy. Block size, proof of work, proof of stake, hybrids, hybrid proof of work, proof of stake were really popular back in 14. And so we've seen what doesn't work. And I think that definitely reinforces my belief, in my personal opinion, that Bitcoin is the largest innovation in the space for me.
01:38:03.798 - 01:38:51.560, Speaker B: It continually reinforces that Bitcoin's design decisions were made properly as we see it continue to thrive and grow. And we don't know what that means in the future if it'll continue to thrive and grow. But it's certainly done very well up until this moment. And will Bitcoin be the only currency in the future? No, but my personal belief is that it will be the predominant one. If it accumulates the largest amount of value stored in it, then it seems to be indicative that that will also be used in the medium of exchange function. Where if I know that Andreas and Laura both have bitcoin it's likely that they will accept bitcoin from me versus this very bifurcated world in the future where, let's say there's 10,000 currencies we're basically back to barter. If we have like 1000 different types of currencies or 10,000.
01:38:51.560 - 01:39:02.138, Speaker B: I'm not sure if that's really reflective of a new money which has superior characteristics to all previous forms of money, if that would be the case.
01:39:02.304 - 01:40:39.834, Speaker C: Yeah, I think one of the things that changes dramatically is when the switching costs between different forms of money drop to near zero, and then the major cost is the time value of money for the time that you hold a specific money, which may be rather weak, versus the medium of exchange opportunities that that gives. You may actually change this equation of there may be more types of money, but if that becomes a routing decision that your wallet makes automatically, then we may see a completely different conception of money. Although I do agree with you, what's fascinating to me is that Bitcoin in its current conception, which appears to have perfectly chosen all of the parameters, or most of the parameters very neatly in this cohesive way, is in itself an example of survivor bias. Meaning that the reason we talk about bitcoin and its parameters is because we don't talk about the 30 currencies, private cryptography based currencies that came before Bitcoin. That all failed because one of those parameters wasn't set up correctly. We talk about bitcoin because it's still around, and therefore has proven through persistence that those parameters sustain it. And the longer that narrative continues, the stronger it gets.
01:40:39.834 - 01:41:18.054, Speaker C: Its surviving is one of its measurable characteristics that strengthens its possibility of surviving in the future. And the narrative, that a newbie hears. But they hear bitcoin's dead again, and then they find out that's not actually true, and that causes a moment of cognitive dissonance. What do you mean it's not dead? I thought it was dead when the Japanese CEO was arrested, et cetera, et cetera. That moment of cognitive dissonance is a very strong point of narrative that reinforces the idea that bitcoin is perfectly tuned, at least in the current context we live in.
01:41:18.252 - 01:41:55.730, Speaker A: All right, so honestly, we could just go forever. I honestly really did have quite a number of other questions that I didn't get to, but I think through the various comments we've made, we managed to touch on all the topics. This is, I think, the longest episode I've ever done. The conversation just was super fascinating and kept going. However, we should give the listeners more to look up if they're interested in learning more about this. So where can people learn more about each of you? And where do you think they should look if they're interested into learning more about bitcoin's monetary policy?
01:41:55.880 - 01:42:35.760, Speaker B: I guess I'll go first. You can find me@danheld.com or find me on twitter at dan held, and I wrote an article about bitcoin's monetary policy that dives into the more metaphysical, kind of a little bit more abstract idea of that. Bitcoin is the best application of information, theory of money. So I've got a couple articles on my blog if you want to read those, to give you a more informed, deeper dive into monetary policy security models. So I wrote an extensive piece on bitcoin security model and other aspects of bitcoin. And then on twitter, if you want more sound bitey, very kind of more quippy quick hits on bitcoin, that's where you're going to find that sort of content.
01:42:36.450 - 01:43:09.320, Speaker C: You can find me as a Antonop, A-N-T-O-N-O-P on twitter and on YouTube, where I have 500 some videos on various topics around bitcoin. Honestly, monetary policy isn't a topic that I talk about a lot. Most of my focus is on the technology and its social and political implications on the future. So if that's interesting to you, then you can find that all on my YouTube channel.
01:43:10.170 - 01:43:14.170, Speaker A: Great. Well, thank you both so much for coming on chain. This has been such a pleasure.
01:43:14.990 - 01:43:16.262, Speaker C: Thank you laura.
