00:00:00.170 - 00:00:41.654, Speaker A: The SEC basically is saying they don't feel comfortable with brokers. Typically the people that are aps in this case are a lot of big banks and brokers that are registered broker dealers. And I think it comes back to the SEC basically isn't going to give up on that stance. So if they do allow in kind, the problem here is that they'd almost be like implicitly accepting a loophole to that rule. So basically these brokers would have like subsidiaries and offshore entities that would technically deal in the bitcoin and they have offsetting balance sheet positions, which, yeah, that would work and it would be the most efficient way as things are currently constructed, in my opinion. But again, that's like the SEC, almost like green lighting a loophole that takes everything more out of their jurisdiction. Right.
00:00:41.654 - 00:00:59.420, Speaker A: So by forcing it to be cash, the brokers aren't touching the bitcoin. So the brokers are under the SEC's jurisdiction and they have asset management firms run these etfs are under the SEC's jurisdiction. So all of a sudden everything stays when they leave it in cash under the SEC jurisdiction because they are not allowing brokers to touch this.
