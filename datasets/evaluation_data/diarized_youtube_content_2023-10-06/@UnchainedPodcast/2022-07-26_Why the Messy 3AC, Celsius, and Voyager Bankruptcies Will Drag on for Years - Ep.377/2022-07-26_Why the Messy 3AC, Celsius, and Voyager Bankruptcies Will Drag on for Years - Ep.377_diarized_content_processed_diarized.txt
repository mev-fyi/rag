00:00:00.330 - 00:00:45.302, Speaker A: Hi, all. Just a quick note before we begin. This episode is an interview with a bankruptcy expert, Adam Levitton, and an insolvency expert, Wasee Lawyer. It's an incredible conversation on how the bankruptcies of Three Arrows Capital, Celsius and Voyager will go down. Just wanted to note that we recorded before Friday afternoon, which is when FTX offered to allow Voyager customers who opt into the program access to some of their funds early as long as they create FTX accounts. So, in case you're wondering why we don't discuss this proposal, that's why. However, in discussing it post show, wasse Lawyer said it was an incredibly shrewd move and believes that it's a signal that Sam Bankman Fried thinks the crypto markets have bottomed.
00:00:45.302 - 00:01:28.486, Speaker A: Otherwise, enjoy this incredibly illuminating discussion of how the three AC, Celsius and Voyager bankruptcies will go down. Hi, everyone.

00:02:51.982 - 00:02:54.402, Speaker B: Hello. It's good to be here today. Hi, everyone.
00:02:54.456 - 00:02:57.910, Speaker C: It's good to be here today as not Darth Vader.
00:02:58.810 - 00:03:17.610, Speaker A: We're just going to dive right into what appears to be the mediat issue, and that is something called custodial funds. Why don't you just define what that is for the listeners and why this is such a big issue? I think particularly in Celsius and the Voyager cases.
00:03:18.030 - 00:03:58.566, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. I think the point about custody funds has been thrown around a lot recently because, well, when you've deposited assets into a company or bank that has failed. I think what you want is you want a custody relationship, because when something's in custody, the title to that asset doesn't actually pass over to the company you have deposited it with. So what that means is that when the company goes into insolvency, those assets are segregated and it doesn't go into the general pool to pay like all other unsecured creditors. So you get those that have assets in custody would be able to get those assets back.
00:03:58.748 - 00:05:07.914, Speaker B: So I think that the starting point here is a question of what is this stuff? So you have customers who placed funds with, say, Celsius or Voyager, and the question is, whose property are those funds? Do they remain property of the customer or are they property of Celsius or Voyager? And if they are property of Celsius or Voyager, then the customer has a claim in the bankruptcy. The customer is just a creditor and is going to get treated differently in the bankruptcy than if it's the customer's property. Because if it is actually the customer's property, it will actually ultimately get returned to the customer. How fast? There may be a little bit of a delay, but the customer will get the property back if it's the customer's property. And this is going to be one of the big questions in both Celsius and Voyager's bankruptcy, and it may be different answers in each bankruptcy, and there may be different answers for different groups or types of relationships. So for Celsius, for example, it has the Earn product, and the answer there may be different than with Celsius's custody wallet.
00:05:07.962 - 00:05:13.140, Speaker A: So just to be clear, the Earn product is like an interest earning product?
00:05:13.750 - 00:05:34.502, Speaker B: Exactly. And with Earn, Celsius's terms and conditions is quite clear that if you're using Earn, you're making a loan to on for Earn. I really don't think there's a lot of ambiguity that it's not customer property for the custody wallet. That's where I think it's much the.
00:05:34.636 - 00:05:45.180, Speaker A: Custody wallet is essentially like Celsius just storing your assets, and then it gets pulled, and then it's harder to make a claim that you have specific funds in there.
00:05:45.630 - 00:05:46.380, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:05:47.310 - 00:05:55.470, Speaker C: Laura I think the equivalent is depositing assets into a safety deposit box and deposit it into a bank. I think that's probably a good parallel.
00:05:56.210 - 00:06:38.742, Speaker B: I think that's right when you think of a safe deposit box, that's what we call a bailment. It's like when you check your coat with a coat check valet, or you give your car to the parking valet. It's not the parking valet's car. It's still your car. The parking valet is supposed to park it and do nothing else with it, not take it for a joyride. The problem is, if the parking valet has taken it for a joyride and the car gets totaled, at that point, you're a creditor of the parking valet. And there may be a bit of an element of that going on in celsius, because Celsius seems to have commingled the custody funds with other funds.
00:06:38.742 - 00:06:44.570, Speaker B: And there's a billion and a half hole or so in Celsius's balance sheet.
00:06:44.730 - 00:06:57.380, Speaker A: Wow. So their terms were saying that the customer would have this custodial relationship if they use that earned product, but on the back end, no. Oh, wow.
00:06:58.310 - 00:07:35.150, Speaker C: I don't think that's exactly right, Laura. I think they were quite explicit with the earned product that it would look a lot more like a loan. The issue is with the custody product. That is where all the questions are coming up right now, because I think recently came out in one of these articles what was actually being said in the bankruptcy court. And it was very clear that with the earned products, the products where you're generating a yield on it, the term used wasn't exactly right, giving up legal rights to it, but you're giving up proprietary rights to it. You no longer own it, you've lent it to Celsius.
00:07:35.650 - 00:07:37.086, Speaker A: So those are the funds that are.
00:07:37.108 - 00:07:43.550, Speaker B: Commingled, but I think all of them are commingled, is the problem. So we have two categories of funds.
00:07:44.130 - 00:07:55.342, Speaker A: Was it supposed to be that when you loaned it that those would be marked as yours, or that those would be pulled together and then you kind of lose that claim of saying like, these are definitely mine.
00:07:55.406 - 00:08:15.050, Speaker B: We have these two different groups of two different products. We have earn and custody. With earn by itself pretty clear that it is a loan being made to Celsius. With the custody, the terms and conditions are a little less clear, but there's a decent case that it's supposed to be remain customer property.
00:08:15.200 - 00:08:23.120, Speaker A: I just need you to finish at that thought. When you do make a loan to Celsius, does that mean then that you lose that custody relationship?
00:08:24.210 - 00:08:24.910, Speaker C: Yes.
00:08:25.060 - 00:08:26.442, Speaker B: Then you're just a creditor.
00:08:26.506 - 00:08:52.354, Speaker C: You're taking counterparty risk on Celsius. When that happens, when it's custody, you're not meant to take counterparty risk. The equivalent is if you went to a bank and you put a million dollars in a bank and then you put a million dollars into the bank's safety deposit box. If the bank goes under, you are a unsecured creditor for the amount of the million dollars you deposited to an account, whereas you can claim back what's in the safety deposit box. I e. The full million dollars because that property was always yours.
00:08:52.482 - 00:08:53.974, Speaker A: Oh, I see. Okay.
00:08:54.092 - 00:09:13.450, Speaker B: The problem is that Celsius seems to have commingled the funds that were deposited in the earned capacity with the funds that were deposited in the custody capacity. And it's as if the stuff that's in the safety deposit box got mixed together with the regular bank deposits.
00:09:14.350 - 00:09:14.762, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:09:14.816 - 00:09:20.942, Speaker A: Okay, so essentially they weren't following what the terms of their agreements were, is that right?
00:09:21.076 - 00:09:56.006, Speaker B: I'm not sure that they were actually violating the terms of their agreements. I believe that Celsius did indicate that funds might be commingled the problem is commingling itself wouldn't be an issue if you don't have a shortfall of funds. It's when there isn't enough to pay everyone back. How do you allocate the losses? Do you allocate them on maybe a prorated basis among the custody and the earned customers? Or do you allocate them all to earn and say, look, the custody stuff we never actually touched.
00:09:56.198 - 00:10:00.140, Speaker A: So what's your theory, both of you, about how they'll handle this?
00:10:01.630 - 00:10:47.882, Speaker C: I think the practical implication here, right, is if you look at the Celsius sort of assets and liabilities that they put up on their sort of Alex Chinsky's Chapter Eleven declaration, they've allocated 180,000,000 in custody assets, 180,000,000 in custody liabilities. So if it turns out, and that's why they asked the judge this question, if it turns out that those custody assets liabilities are meant to be segregated, anyone who put their crypto, their money, whatever assets into custody, will be very happy about it because you'll be able to get everything back. You'd get one for one. If it is not treated as a custody relationship and the guys who put assets into custody product turn out to be unsecured creditors, then they would share in the pool with all of the other general unsecured creditors. So that's how it worked?
00:10:47.936 - 00:11:36.954, Speaker B: Practically, yeah. It wasn't real clear to me from the Machinsky declaration how strong of a position Celsius was actually taking on this issue. Certainly the way the kind of high level balance sheet breakdown that was presented in the declaration lines up with the way that wasi lawyer characterizes it. But I'm not sure if that was really a very deliberate thing or not. Celsius's bankruptcy filing does not seem like it was put together super carefully. It seemed like it was kind of a thing that Kirkland and Ellis had to do in a bit of a rush. And I'd be careful about reading too much into any particular words that get used.
00:11:37.152 - 00:11:43.760, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. One for later, but absolutely. There's a clear difference between how the Celsius filing looks and what the Voyager filing looks.
00:11:44.530 - 00:12:26.780, Speaker B: There's a really interesting divide also under the surface between the custody and the earned customers. The custody customers are all domestic American accounts. So if you were in the UK or Australia or Finland and you wanted to deal with Celsius, you were dealing with Celsius only as an earned customer. And I don't think that's something that's likely to shape the legal treatment, but it's a factor that's lurking in the background where maybe there's a temptation to treat domestic customers better. I don't think that's going to play out, but there's at least a possibility there.
00:12:27.470 - 00:12:34.798, Speaker A: Well, I mean, it sounds like the custody customers already, generally, based on the definition, come in with a stronger position, right?
00:12:34.964 - 00:12:47.170, Speaker B: Absolutely. It's not that they necessarily win, but I think they have a decent argument, whereas the earned customers, I don't see any way that they're going to end up being anything other than just general unsecured creditors.
00:12:48.790 - 00:12:59.000, Speaker A: So how does this all apply to Voyager? Because we've only really been talking about it in relation to Celsius, but I imagine Voyager has a kind of similar situation.
00:12:59.370 - 00:13:41.634, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that with Voyager, I think it's going to apply in a similar way. I mean, Voyager, all their crypto holdings were commingled. Voyager was less clear in its terms of use, though, than Celsius. So if you were depositing funds with Voyager, they didn't have kind of two separate products. Instead, Voyager uses language that kind of indicates, well, it's still your crypto, except the facts are that they get to use it pretty much like Celsius. And that's the trickier situation. Instead of having two clear categories, voyager is sort of sitting in the middle.
00:13:41.634 - 00:14:13.290, Speaker B: I suspect the treatment in Voyager is going to be that it gets treated as if it's property of Voyager, and that's the position that Voyager has been taking, is that this is their property, not customer property. But even if it ends up being treated as customer property and this is a really key point it's only customer property. To the extent that Voyager has the assets, to the extent there's a shortfall, those customers are unsecured creditors for the shortfall.
00:14:13.450 - 00:14:14.670, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely agree.
00:14:14.820 - 00:14:23.410, Speaker A: Yeah. And can we just discuss why it is that retail customers are lower in the pecking order than institutional investors?
00:14:24.470 - 00:14:25.506, Speaker B: They're not.
00:14:25.688 - 00:14:51.702, Speaker C: No, they're absolutely not. It all depends on the terms of the arrangement. And to the extent that anyone else lent unsecured to if an institutional investor lent unsecured to Celsius or Voyager or three AC for the matter, they'll be exactly the same pool as the retail investors. If they had security, then they would have security or collateral. Then they would have recourse to that security or collateral.
00:14:51.846 - 00:15:17.070, Speaker B: So all unsecured creditors have the same priority. They all stand alike. I don't think there is any secured I'm not sure that there well, it's not clear that there is any secured credit. Voyager doesn't seem to indicate any secured credit. And Celsius, I think by the time they filed, they paid down all the that they paid off all the DeFi loans that may or may not actually be secured.
00:15:18.050 - 00:15:47.930, Speaker C: Yes, they paid down all their DeFi loans prior to the filing because the DeFi loans were all over collateralized. So it made sense for them to have more assets in the company's balance sheet and not to have it. But your question about sort of insolvency priority unsecured creditors tend to be dead last. They are dead last. And the way you get priority over that is well, there are preferential creditors created by statute. I'm not sure what it is in the US. But normally it's taxes.
00:15:47.930 - 00:15:52.038, Speaker C: Taxes owed employees.
00:15:52.214 - 00:15:58.298, Speaker B: You're forgetting the most important one. You got to pay the grave diggers. It's the administrative cost of the bankruptcy.
00:15:58.394 - 00:16:03.860, Speaker C: Of course, the cost of bankruptcy come up first. Oh, yes. Kirkland Alice get paid first.
00:16:04.710 - 00:16:06.580, Speaker A: They already made 3 million.
00:16:07.190 - 00:16:13.490, Speaker B: Oh, that's just scratching the surface. The administrative costs of a bankruptcy can.
00:16:13.560 - 00:16:16.718, Speaker C: Get it will be high. It will be absolutely incredible.
00:16:16.814 - 00:16:23.186, Speaker A: No, I mean in the short amount of time that this has been going, they already made 3 million. I saw an article.
00:16:23.378 - 00:16:27.398, Speaker B: I would expect the total fees here for professionals to be over 100 million.
00:16:27.564 - 00:16:56.180, Speaker C: Laura that's why I've been in the room with discussions like before. People file for Chapter Eleven and normally act creditor side and the debt is to the extent it's possible for them, they would sometimes just threaten a Chapter Eleven, because once you tread in a Chapter Eleven, all the creditors go, okay, shit, all right, fine, let's not do that, please. That's terrible because there's going to be so much value leakage to professional fees ahead of me and I don't get to do anything for months.
00:16:56.790 - 00:17:35.760, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah. I just like seeing that bill that Kirkland and Ellis sent in for 3 million and then thinking about the various customers who they have like 100,000 in there or 70,000 or whatever, and I was just like, oh, this is obviously not good for them. But anyway, I did also when I tweeted about questions people had for you, someone who was a Celsius customer asked, how does it work if your Bitcoin loan was liquidated while the company was frozen and it was not possible to send in funds to protect it or close it off? Can that be reversed? And funds retrieved during the bankruptcy process?
00:17:37.330 - 00:17:46.960, Speaker B: Let's see if I have the scenario right in my head here. So prior to bankruptcy, someone had borrowed money from Celsius, right?
00:17:47.330 - 00:17:50.590, Speaker A: No, it sounds like they were in London.
00:17:51.590 - 00:18:18.346, Speaker B: They wanted to pay it off. So it sounds like this is a borrower from Celsius, has a third group of folks who borrowed money from Celsius and posted collateral for their loans. And the collateral they posted, I think may have also been commingled with all the other crypto holdings. So it sounds like they couldn't pay it off. This is someone who wanted to make a payment and Celsius wouldn't accept the payment.
00:18:18.528 - 00:18:20.250, Speaker A: Yeah. Because it was frozen.
00:18:20.770 - 00:18:29.040, Speaker B: Yeah. I think that they probably just have an unsecured claim against Celsius for breach of.
00:18:31.090 - 00:18:33.646, Speaker A: So then I don't think they.
00:18:33.668 - 00:19:07.260, Speaker B: Get their crypto back. I think that they have a dollar claim, and how much that will get paid is anyone's guess. So think of if you have a claim and it's allowed, that's like having an entry ticket. It doesn't mean that you're going to necessarily see any value, it just makes you eligible for a distribution in the bankruptcy. Laura maybe it would help if we just did like a minute on kind of an overview of Chapter Eleven of the process. Would that be? So I'm going to try and do this in like 1 minute and not talk too long here's. Kind of the very nutshell overview of the US bankruptcy process.
00:19:07.260 - 00:19:51.994, Speaker B: When a debtor files for bankruptcy, first thing that happens is something called the automatic stay. This is basically like an injunction against any attempt to collect from the debtor outside of the bankruptcy process. At the same time, there is a new legal entity that's created it's called the bankruptcy estate. And the bankruptcy estate has title to all of the debtors assets no matter where they're located. So what we're doing is we're bringing all the assets and all the claims against those assets together into single forum and hopefully having a more orderly process. The bankruptcy Estate in chapter Eleven is managed by an entity called the Debtor in possession or Dip. It's not a pejorative, and that just means it's the pre bankruptcy management running the show.
00:19:51.994 - 00:20:22.770, Speaker B: But they're wearing a different hat. The hat that they're wearing now makes them fiduciaries for creditors and shareholders. So creditors will file claims with a claims agent for the court. Stretto is the claims agent for Voyager and Celsius. And if you don't file a claim, celsius or Voyager are probably going to just schedule it according to their books and records and claims are deemed approved unless someone objects. But Celsius and Voyager very well may object to certain claims. They're going to spend some time looking at all the claims.
00:20:22.770 - 00:21:11.950, Speaker B: And if Celsius or Voyager want to do anything outside of the ordinary course of business, they need court approval. So if they don't normally scratch their head, they need to go to the court and make a motion for permission to scratch their head. For the first 120 days, the debtor has the exclusive right to propose a plan of reorganization or liquidation. That 120 day period, though, can be extended to 18 months, and it often is. So there's going to be a window where only the debtor has the choice of kind of how to move going forward. But there's going to be a very important kind of counterweight to the debtor. There's going to be set up in the next couple of weeks a thing called the Official Creditors Committee.
00:21:11.950 - 00:21:54.094, Speaker B: That's a body of a representative body of creditors that's selected by a Department of justice official called the United States Trustee. And the members of the official Creditors committee are fiduciaries for the creditors they represent. They will hire their own attorneys and financial advisors. And if you kind of think of how the courtroom is going to be set up, instead of being one table for the prosecutors and one for the defendants, you'll have one table where there's going to be the debtors counsel and typically one table where the official committee's counsel will sit. That kind of gives you a sense of the relative weight of the parties. Now here's the thing that's often not understood well about bankruptcy. It's the role of the judge.
00:21:54.094 - 00:22:20.594, Speaker B: Because there's a bankruptcy judge and the bankruptcy judge is like a referee not a quarterback. The judge decides on matters put before him. And that means you need to make a motion for the judge to do something. You're asking the judge to approve or disapprove of something. The judge is not making the plan. The judge is not deciding generally, oh, this is what's fair and what's not. It's that there are very specific issues put before the judge.
00:22:20.594 - 00:23:00.134, Speaker B: And if there isn't a motion before the judge, the judge isn't going to act on anything. The judge has hundreds of other cases going on, other big, other bankruptcy, large business bankruptcies, lots of consumer bankruptcies. So this is kind of a situation where it's, hey, tell me what I need to decide right now and I'll figure it out. And if it's not an issue that's immediately before me, well, I'm dealing with other problems. And this is a process that's going to be slow. It's going to be expensive because the debtors attorneys and financial advisors, their fees come out of the top. The official committee's attorneys and financial advisors, all of their fees come off the top.
00:23:00.134 - 00:23:18.860, Speaker B: And these administrative expenses paying the gravedigger, that's going to probably, in a case like this, easily turn into 100 million, maybe two would be my guess, in that range. And that's money that's not available for customers. And that's just kind of the cost of the process.
00:23:19.470 - 00:23:26.880, Speaker A: Wow. Yeah. And how long do you expect both the Celsius and Voyager bankruptcies to take?
00:23:27.810 - 00:23:45.640, Speaker C: So it's important to note that Celsius has not found a plan of reorganization yet, but Voyager has. So Voyager has provided a lot more sort of details around what they intend to do. Maybe I can let Adam talk about how these plans work since he's done such a great job.
00:23:48.010 - 00:23:55.798, Speaker B: Voyager didn't exactly file a plan of reorganization, so they did kind of a funny move.
00:23:55.964 - 00:23:56.678, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:23:56.844 - 00:24:50.342, Speaker B: When they filed, they included as a filing with the court this half baked plan. Except the actual way the Chapter eleven process works is what you're going to have to do is ultimately solicit creditors votes on a plan. So creditors are going to have a vote. You cannot solicit their votes until the court has approved a disclosure statement about the plan. And a disclosure statement is going to probably, in a case like this, be 150 page document that's going to do everything from laying out the history of how the debtor got here, to summarizing what the plan does, how it treats every kind of claim, what the debtor's business model is going forward. And it's supposed to give creditors adequate information to be able to vote on a plan. Do they like it or not? Just filing a plan doesn't let you do anything.
00:24:50.342 - 00:25:21.410, Speaker B: You need to get a disclosure statement approved. Otherwise, the plan is just a piece of paper that sits out there. So I think what Kirkland and Ellis did, and this is something Kne does quite frequently, it'll file kind of just a placeholder plan to give an indication of where they're thinking of going and to try and frame the conversation. It in no way binds Celsius to that being its ultimate plan. Celsius could change direction on a dime, and it doesn't bind anyone else. It's just a conversation starter.
00:25:21.910 - 00:25:26.038, Speaker A: Okay, so when do you think we might get the formal plan?
00:25:26.204 - 00:26:26.294, Speaker B: I think that's going to be sometime, especially for Celsius. Voyager is simpler. Voyager just has a voyager's got the problem of figuring out the status of the customer funds once it does that? I think the Voyager's big issue is that its loan book was ridiculously concentrated. Like, 58% of its loan book was Three Arrows Capital, which is just like the insanity of that is beyond description. So if you were a bank in the United States, you are limited to lending if it's fully collateralized 25% of your capital and surplus to a single borrower. If you figure a bank's capital is 8%, we're talking therefore, about no more than 2% of your assets to any one loan. And people go to jail when banks mess that up like that.
00:26:26.294 - 00:27:10.982, Speaker B: That's why Paul Manafort is in jail, in part because he was defrauding a bank to go beyond the loan limit. And here we got 58% of their loan book, which is pretty much all their assets going to one borrower, and 99% are over six counterparties. It's just nuts. So there's going to be a big question. Is there any model which they can reorganize on? And I'm rather skeptical because this is a business that's built on customer trust. And who on earth would trust a company that did such a bad job with risk management to ever do to ever get this right in the future? Maybe their tech stack was decent. I don't really know.
00:27:10.982 - 00:27:36.622, Speaker B: But if it was decent, that's something that someone else can buy and pair it up with better risk management. So the bottom line, how long is this going to take with any of them? It's a huge guess. I think we're looking at, for these kinds of cases, we're probably looking at something that's approaching two years and how long it actually takes for final distributions could go on longer.
00:27:36.756 - 00:27:48.530, Speaker A: And when you said that Voyager had a simpler case than Celsius, is it because the fact that it wasn't the commingling and it really was just the fact that they had this one huge loan that defaulted?
00:27:49.030 - 00:28:21.930, Speaker B: I think. So Celsius has their suggestions that there may have been more funny business going on with Celsius. Voyager just seems to have been incompetent on risk management. Celsius seems to have also had that problem. But if you look at the Keyfi lawsuit and some of the letters that are being submitted in the docket, there seems to be a sense of some people that Machinsky was doing something beyond just being a bad risk manager.
00:28:22.290 - 00:29:11.318, Speaker C: Yeah, I completely agree there. I think it looks like why Voyager gone over is exactly as Adam has said. They've just expanded this massive, massive loan to Crew's Capital, and otherwise, everything was sort of ticking along, apart from their exceedingly crap risk management. And based on sort of the indicative plan, it looks like their plan is, look, we're just going to move the default risk on Tree AC, or at least move all of that onto the account holders instead. So the draft plan basically says, look, you're an account holder and we owe you money. We're going to give you bit of cash, a little bit of crypto that we have left. We're going to give you some Voyager tokens, and we're going to give you whatever we manage your share of, whatever we managed to recover from Tria's Capital.
00:29:11.318 - 00:29:44.562, Speaker C: So when we recover anything from Tria's Capital, it doesn't come into the bankruptcy, it doesn't come into the sort of reorganized company. It goes to a third party and it distributes it to it gets distributed to you. Obviously, that's being incredibly optimistic about what you can actually recover from Trias Capital. The Chapter Eleven plan for Voyager is going to be very closely linked to how the Triaros liquidation plays out. To add to what Adam has said on Celsius. Exactly, it there's a lot more sort of funny business going on. When I read the filing, they kind of went, oh, we only lost about $15 million on Lunar.
00:29:44.562 - 00:30:26.470, Speaker C: We didn't get destroyed that badly. They lost only about 40 million on the Tree AC loan, which is a large amount, but small compared to what Voyager has done. But then you start looking at all the strange things that they've been doing. They lost thirty five k e just lost it because someone they gave it to misplaced the keys. You've got a private lending platform unnamed. We don't know who this is that defaulted, and there is now a loss of, like, something about over 400 million, which they are slowly trying to get recoveries on. And one of my favorite quotes in the whole thing is there were certain asset deployment decisions that were made that, in hindsight, proved problematic.
00:30:26.470 - 00:30:36.386, Speaker C: So very vague about that. And, yeah, we don't really know what tipped them over. It just looks like a series of incredibly bad decisions.
00:30:36.578 - 00:31:09.954, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. With the Celsius one, even when I was just writing questions for the show, I had so many more questions because there were so many more kind of red flags or question marks there. But with the Voyager, it seemed a little bit more straightforward. Which is not to say that they didn't mess up hugely. But I want to circle back to that question of how much people will be able to get, or rather Voyager will be able to get from three AC.

Back to my conversation with Wasse lawyer and Adam, so Wasi Lawyer, earlier when you were saying that a big part of what's going to determine how much Voyager customers get is what they can claw back from Three AC. What is your sense there of how that's looking for people? Because we got a little bit of a taste a week ago. It'll be a week by the time this comes out on kind of what assets three EC has, it's going to.
00:33:35.524 - 00:33:58.710, Speaker C: Be quite difficult to answer the question. Exactly. What we do know is that from the documents that sort of come out, that there is at least $2.8 billion of claims against Trieros Capital right now. We do know that apparently it came out some of the sources that the liquidators have secured $40 million of funds. $40 million and $2.8 billion.
00:33:58.710 - 00:34:20.960, Speaker C: Pretty massive gap. On top of that, it does look like Trieros Capital doesn't really have it may be the case that they don't have that many liquid assets. I think we covered this briefly the last show, Laura. What sort of assets would they have? They would have equity warrants, token warrants. Tokens? Tokens that are going to be vested. I mean, they probably hold a crap ton of luna, too.
00:34:21.330 - 00:34:23.630, Speaker B: The yacht. Don't forget the yacht.
00:34:25.090 - 00:34:28.100, Speaker A: $15 million yacht, but I don't think it's been delivered yet.
00:34:29.590 - 00:34:31.460, Speaker B: A half built yacht. Yeah.
00:34:32.550 - 00:35:18.340, Speaker C: So they've got a ton of NFTs. And one thing that's going to be quite interesting is how these so when I read the recognition and filing in Singapore, maybe this is for the tree arrows bit later on, or separately, there's the question of what happens to Defiance funds and what happens to the Starry Knights funds, and what happens to this fund called Wobbler. So what happens is essentially it looks like Treac have commingled all of their funds into under one single entity and it looks like Defiant and Starry Night and Warbler were actually managed by persons other than Treac. So it'd be interesting to see how the liquidators rock up to these guys and say hand over everything. Your funds have been liquidated because you're part of a structure that has been so horribly mismanaged. Feel quite bad for those guys actually.
00:35:19.190 - 00:35:34.870, Speaker B: Wasi lawyer you've been following three AC more closely than I have. When the liquidators say they've recovered 40 million, does that mean that means that they have the it's either cash that they have control of or they have the private keys for the digital assets.
00:35:35.530 - 00:35:42.090, Speaker C: Not 100% sure of that one, but that's what's come on to reports that they've recovered, quote unquote, 40 million of assets.
00:35:42.430 - 00:35:52.502, Speaker B: So I take it then that for all the other assets, no one knows at this point, or at least the liquidators don't know who has the private keys.
00:35:52.646 - 00:36:23.350, Speaker C: I think it sounds like, and we have to read between the lines here right, because this is all for what the liquidators have told the courts of the US and Singapore where they're applying for recognition. So what we do know is that it seems that sue and Kao have not been very cooperative and presumably these are the guys that holding a shit ton of those keys. At some point you expect them to play ball. But it does look know as of the date when the liquidators applied to the Singapore court, they weren't very cooperative.
00:36:24.090 - 00:36:26.726, Speaker B: And no one knows exactly where they are.
00:36:26.908 - 00:36:28.730, Speaker C: Apparently they're going to Dubai.
00:36:30.750 - 00:36:35.818, Speaker A: This is like where all the people who are fleeing something in crypto end up.
00:36:35.984 - 00:36:40.700, Speaker C: Maybe they just paid off the yacht and they're just sailing the seven seas now.
00:36:41.950 - 00:36:45.934, Speaker A: I think the yacht is still yet to be delivered and in Europe maybe.
00:36:45.972 - 00:36:59.140, Speaker C: That'S exactly where they're going because if you read the filings, they squirrel $30 million away to typing Shawn entity they're related to $10 million to an unrecovered wallet and the cost of the yacht is 50 million. Maybe the down payment is 20%.
00:37:00.310 - 00:37:36.174, Speaker A: Hopefully at some point we will find out more on their whereabouts or if they end up in Dubai, we'll just hear about it. So I did also want to then circle back to this other question related to the one that the customer with the Bitcoin loan at Celsius had. So as you guys mentioned, in that case, likely that customer will get dollars back. And what's your sense of how likely it is that a lot of the crypto assets in any of these firms will be turned into dollars. And what's your sense of whether or not the customers would prefer to have crypto assets versus dollars?
00:37:36.372 - 00:38:22.042, Speaker C: Okay, I think just to jump in here first, I think there's a different process. This is a question that's very relevant to both all three of Celsius voyager Tree AC. But again, to draw a distinction, tree AC is in liquidation, so it's going to be liquidated. It's not going to exist as a company after the process is done, whereas Celsius and Voyager fell for Chapter Eleven, and what they want to do, ideally, is to continue as a business afterwards. So it may be the case that in the plan of reorganization eventually goes true, that you get a mixture of crypto, you get distributions in kind, which means in crypto, or you get it in cash. Whatever the plan turns out to be, this becomes a much bigger question for Tree Arrows Capital, because if I've led bitcoin into Tree Arrows Capital, maybe I want bitcoin back. Maybe I don't want a us.
00:38:22.042 - 00:38:36.862, Speaker C: Dollar amount. And there's a question of when I convert the bitcoin to US. Dollars if the liquidators do choose to do so. So I've looked into this a fair bit, but I know Adam has bit to say about it, so I'm just going to throw the mic over to him opine on how this works, at least in the US. Okay.
00:38:36.916 - 00:39:17.082, Speaker B: So in the US. There are kind of two pieces we have to look at. First is, what is your claim? And then second, how can that claim get paid regarding what your claim is? It doesn't matter what form you extended value to the debtor. It gets dollarized as of the date of the bankruptcy filing. So for Celsius, you're looking at the value of the crypto that you were owed on July 13. And presumably we can get it down to the minute of the bankruptcy petition, but if it's bitcoin, it's around in the 20,000 range. Voyager on July 5 actually turns out to be right around in the same range.
00:39:17.082 - 00:39:48.934, Speaker B: So if you had one bitcoin parked with Celsius, you have a claim for roughly $20,000. And it doesn't matter that bitcoin today might be at 23,000. Your claim is for 20,000, so you don't get any of the market rise. On the other hand, the market falls, your claim is still locked in at 20. The problem is, if the market falls, they just don't have the assets to pay you that 20. So either way, you get kind of roped oak here. Either way, it works badly for you.
00:39:48.934 - 00:40:24.500, Speaker B: Now, that's the bad news on the what is your claim side. The better news for you is on how your claim can be treated. A Chapter Eleven plan can be a plan of reorganization or a plan of liquidation. Usually Chapter Eleven is thought of as being reorganization but businesses of any size that want to liquidate will use Chapter Eleven because it's more flexible than Chapter seven. Management stays in place in Chapter eleven, and Chapter seven, it gets moved out. A Chapter Eleven plan can pay you in any form it wants. It has to give you value.
00:40:24.500 - 00:41:07.250, Speaker B: That is, at least as much as you would get in a hypothetical Chapter Seven liquidation. But that value is, as of the effective data, the plan. So you just have to see what the market value is. They could pay you in Bitcoin, they could pay you in shitcoin. The only question is, do they have the votes for confirming the plan? If you vote again, and this is a majoritarian rule exercise, so it doesn't matter if you vote against a plan. If they get the requisite votes and a plan is approved, it binds all creditors, regardless of what they want. And to the extent you're not paid under a plan, there's no one you can try and collect from it.
00:41:07.250 - 00:41:34.890, Speaker B: Afterwards, the debt gets discharged unless there's like a third party that you say is liable as a guarantor and hasn't gotten a release. Curiously, there are some interesting releases in the Voyager plan. Alameda is at least proposed to get a release. So if there was some kind of litigation claim against Alameda, that would be gone and creditors wouldn't be able to try and collect from SBF.
00:41:35.550 - 00:41:44.000, Speaker A: Oh, wow. I guess that's maybe because I think they were an investor in Voyager. So is that just something they negotiated from?
00:41:44.770 - 00:42:13.800, Speaker B: I assume that this was kind of they were kind of ever wearing all the hats. They're the single largest equity investor, but it's like a nine and a half percent position. They are the second largest loan counterparty. And then they also extended Credit Rab back the other way with 75 million, which under the Voyager plan seems to be classified separately and basically just canceled out.
00:42:14.170 - 00:42:25.980, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah, because I thought there was something about the way that it was structured where it was meant to prioritize the customers, but then they didn't implement it or something like that.
00:42:27.070 - 00:42:52.260, Speaker B: I don't know what the loan agreement looks like. That's certainly consistent with how the Voyager Placeholder plan treats it, that putting in a separate class than customers and then saying that it gets paid. Nothing would be consistent with that kind of treatment. But I don't know if there was some contractual agreement before the bankruptcy about that.
00:42:53.270 - 00:43:14.860, Speaker A: So I believe there are customers writing in saying that they would prefer that their crypto assets not be dollarized. Do you think that any of the bankruptcy judges or anyone really that involved in the bankruptcies will have a sympathetic ear to that? Or do you feel that they'll just follow what the law says?
00:43:15.470 - 00:43:44.370, Speaker B: It's not the judge's call on this. The judge doesn't decide what the contents of the plan are. The judge just says yay or nay about whether the plan is confirmable. So ultimately there's going to have to be a plan confirmation hearing. It's like a little mini trial, and the judge is going to have to decide whether the plan meets a whole list of criteria. And if it does, then the judge doesn't have any discretion about confirming the plan, even if the judge thinks the plan is a bad idea.
00:43:44.440 - 00:43:47.270, Speaker A: If it's do you feel that they'll be sympathetic?
00:43:47.610 - 00:43:58.040, Speaker C: No. The decision is made by just simply voting against the plan. The account holders, the unsecured creditors, can simply say, this plan doesn't work, we want a different plan.
00:43:58.650 - 00:44:24.354, Speaker B: But as long as the debtor has plan exclusivity, it's the debtor's call what's in the plan. So the debtor right now is determining what's on the menu. You can decide whether you want to order or not, what's on the menu, but it's a collective decision. You're bound by the collective. Once plan exclusivity lapses, then any creditor that wants can come in and propose a plan.
00:44:24.552 - 00:44:26.530, Speaker A: And how long is that period?
00:44:27.030 - 00:44:33.474, Speaker B: Up to 18 months. It's extendable up to 18 months, though. Yeah.
00:44:33.592 - 00:44:40.630, Speaker A: So how likely is it that you think Celsius or Voyager will be sympathetic to that desire and make that part of their plan?
00:44:40.780 - 00:45:20.130, Speaker C: So, Laura, I think it's incredibly, incredibly difficult for anyone administrating a bankrupt estate to start dealing in all these different currencies. So I think it'll be quite difficult for them to figure out this whole returning bitcoin, returning Eve, returning all of these various coins along with US dollars. So it'll be difficult. I'm sure it'd be quite different because in the Tree Arrows case, it has to be dollarized at some point. With the Chapter Eleven, I think it would just be administratively difficult to deal with so many different crypto assets.
00:45:21.190 - 00:46:15.220, Speaker B: I think that's a really important point, the administrative difficulties. But also if you're holding all these crypto assets, you're holding assets that are quite volatile and yes, they might go back to the moon or they might fall. And if you think that if you're putting your hat on as a Fiduciary for creditors and shareholders, that probably pushes for dollarizing and just making selling off all the crypto. Do a slow sell off so you don't crash the market and push down your own prices, but do a slow sell off, turn it all into dollars and pay out the dollars. And that's certainly the easiest way to do it. You can imagine there will be some unhappy customers with it, but once if you've dollarized it before you propose a plan, then there's not much the customers can do to complain. There is no crypto left.
00:46:16.070 - 00:46:41.998, Speaker A: Right. I mean, I just think what you said about being a fiduciary, that's like seeing it from a non crypto person's perspective. Because the reason that these people want to keep the crypto assets is because they don't care about the dollar value, they care about the crypto. So it's like one ETH is one ETH, and that's more valuable than any amount of dollars. So for them, it would be like, well, I don't care what the dollar value is because I just want the ETH. But anyway, I mean, I understand what you're saying.
00:46:42.084 - 00:47:24.540, Speaker B: I would say that for a typical kind of hold on for dear life person, I think that's true, except if you're putting your money in Celsius or Voyager, it's because you're looking to get a dollar return. Maybe you're willing to take a payment in kind in Celsius token, but ultimately you're looking to get a dollar return. This is a different kind of investor than someone who is just buying bitcoin and hoping that the market's going to go up. This is actually the type of investor that's a little more risk averse because they want the fixed dollar return rather than just watching the commodity price go up and down.
00:47:25.710 - 00:48:13.370, Speaker C: This is a much bigger issue with Triaro's Capital, actually, because of the investor profile there and how this thing is going to play. And so I've thought about this a fair bit and sort of shout out to Gone Be Good because he's been discussing this with me and it's come up with some pretty amazing ideas and thoughts about how this would play out. Because what you have is now you've got investors that a lot of them from all of these sources, it shows them extending BTC denominated loans. And these are large amounts of bitcoin. And when Tree Arrows went into liquidation, bitcoin was trading at what, between the 18 to 20K range? Closer to 18, probably. And since then, bitcoin has rebounded a bit. And over the next two years, plus, plus whatever, however long this liquidation takes, bitcoin price could very well recover.
00:48:13.370 - 00:48:48.600, Speaker C: And this is based on a very brief read I am not a BVI lawyer, but based on a very brief read of how BVI insolvency works, if you've got loans in other currencies, you have to change it to US dollars when you file a proof of claim. So you have to dollarize it. And this is something that people will sort of be thinking about going, I don't really want to have my bitcoin denominated loans essentially liquidated at years later. Bitcoin is like 100K. Maybe sue is right and the super cycle is a real thing. So that's an issue. And sort of shout out to again, to Gone be good here.
00:48:48.600 - 00:49:16.346, Speaker C: He sort of went well. But if you looked at bitcoin or his crypto assets as a commodity, then what you're suing for, you could be suing for non delivery of a commodity. And that is a contractual claim. It's not a liquidated claim. So there isn't a number to it at the moment. But then this still opens. So this opens the door possibly to you getting maybe, possibly bits of the upside if bitcoin recovers.
00:49:16.346 - 00:49:33.170, Speaker C: But at some point, this unliquited claim still has to be dollarized. There needs to be a number ascribed to it, and it's a question mark as to when that point of time is. If you ask me, probably requires a lot more thinking around contract law and individual circumstances, et cetera.
00:49:33.910 - 00:49:54.230, Speaker B: Listeners might be wondering why, if this is the British Virgin Islands, you would dollarize to US dollars, and it's because the British Virgin Islands have used the US. Dollar as their official currency since the 1950s. It's a weird situation, but I think it's just about geographic proximity.
00:49:54.390 - 00:50:07.806, Speaker C: But based on my reading, it doesn't look like Bitcoin is defined as a currency or as money under the BGI legislation. So the sort of commodities based interpretation could hold some weight here.
00:50:07.988 - 00:50:20.574, Speaker A: Oh, interesting. Well, so we'll have to see how that plays out. One other topic that I wanted to be sure that we talk about is there might also be a possibility of clawbacks of pre bankruptcy transfers.
00:50:20.622 - 00:50:21.186, Speaker C: Oh, yes.
00:50:21.288 - 00:50:28.646, Speaker A: So yeah, what kinds of transfers would be classified that way, and then how would we determine whether any of those should be clawed back?
00:50:28.828 - 00:51:32.662, Speaker B: There are two categories that actually three categories that are worth talking about. Probably the most important from a customer perspective are what are called voidable preferences. And the idea is that certain transfers made to creditors in the 90 days before bankruptcy can be unwound. And if you're an unsecured creditor, the transfer is unwindable. There are some defenses, and the most important ones are there's a de minimis amount that it's just not worth litigating over. And then there is an ordinary course of business defense. So if the transfer was in the ordinary course of business of both the debtor so if you withdrew money from Celsius, let's say that's a payment to a creditor because Celsius owed you money, you withdrew your funds in the 90 days before bankruptcy, that might be in the ordinary course of Celsius's business to pay withdrawals.
00:51:32.662 - 00:52:27.270, Speaker B: Right. That happens all the time, presumably with Celsius, but it also has to be in the ordinary course of the customer's business. And that's where I think there's an interesting question. It's not weird to think that a customer might withdraw funds at some point, but if the customer had been holding funds, holding funds, holding funds and never withdrew until this one moment, I think it's kind of hard to say that withdrawing funds is actually in the ordinary course of the customer's business. So I think that's an issue the court will have to figure out if Celsius or Voyager pursue these avoidable preference actions. And I think they're likely to do so because there's a substantial pool of money that could be clawed back that way. Once that money is clawed back, if it is, then the folks whose money got clawed back, they have unsecured claims in the bankruptcy.
00:52:27.270 - 00:53:01.798, Speaker B: So you thought you got out before the bankruptcy, and if you didn't get out before in the 91 days before the bankruptcy or more, you might get dragged back into the bankruptcy. That's the most important group. There are two other things that can be clawed back. Another thing are what are called fraudulent transfers. It doesn't have to be actual fraud. This is just transfers made to hinder, delay or defraud creditors. I don't think that really exists with Voyager, but maybe with Celsius, especially with transactions with insiders, maybe there's something there.
00:53:01.798 - 00:53:50.630, Speaker B: And then the other really interesting thing in the background for Celsius is going to be the treatment of the redemptions of the DeFi loan collateral. So DeFi loans are characterized as being collateralized and we think collateral. Oh, it's a secured loan. Well, it's certainly functionally secured, but bankruptcy law doesn't care about functional security. It cares about whether a loan whether if there is something like a security interest has it been perfected? And that's a term of art, meaning that you've taken certain legal steps that lock in the priority of a security interest. If a security interest has not been perfected, it can be avoided, it's gone. It just becomes unsecured.
00:53:50.630 - 00:54:22.080, Speaker B: These DeFi loans seem to have been secured through just basically a smart contract protocol. That's not going to cut it with bankruptcy. That means that they can be treated as unsecured loans. And therefore, because they were unsecured loans, you can treat the redemptions as preferences and you can claw back the redemption payment. The problem is these DeFi protocols. Who are you clawing it back from? Right. It's going to be a freaking mess.
00:54:22.080 - 00:54:53.878, Speaker B: It's going to be a huge mess. Figuring out how, if at all, it's possible to claw funds back from a DFI protocol. I don't know what the answer is, but there is potentially a lot of money at stake, and that if this were $10 million, it might be this isn't worth figuring out. But when you're talking about hundreds of millions, then there's a lot of pressure to figure out a way to claw back money from everyone who uses a DFI protocol.
00:54:54.054 - 00:55:01.440, Speaker A: I mean, just from the perspective of the smart contract itself, my answer is that's not possible. Do you know what I'm saying?
00:55:02.210 - 00:55:23.122, Speaker B: Funds can be well, especially with ether. It's quite easy to track balances. You see where everyone who put money into a pool, you see who they get the money out of the pool. I think you can trace that. Now, can you actually figure out who own those wallets? Right, that's another mess.
00:55:23.256 - 00:55:54.880, Speaker C: Adam that's incredibly illuminating. To be honest, I've never really thought about the DeFi loans in that way and kind of went, oh well, good for them, they over collateralized, they managed to get out. But the way you've sort of framed it, I think you're absolutely right that there would be subject to some sort of clawback claim there and how you do a clawback against DeFi protocols and DAOs. Laura, I think we're going to need about 3 hours. I'm going to need about 3 hours and a couple of days of research and then I'll let you know what could work.
00:55:55.890 - 00:56:04.770, Speaker B: The unincorporated DAOs might be treated as general partnerships where everyone involved is jointly and severally liable. Or maybe they're.
00:56:06.550 - 00:56:17.380, Speaker C: Adam, you need to be careful saying that about everyone in the Dao being jointly liable because maybe you're giving the US terror holders an idea about suing every single lunar holder in the world.
00:56:18.790 - 00:56:34.570, Speaker B: It may not make sense to sue everyone. Right. You only sue the deep pockets. But it's also going to depend on how a Dow is set up. Some Dows actually have incorporated entities and some don't. And the general partner argument is only for the ones that where there's nothing incorporated.
00:56:35.390 - 00:56:56.370, Speaker A: I have to say, even for the beginning part of your clawback description, it sounds like that would just require human individuals to send back these crypto assets, which those famous instances of people being arrested and then they won't reveal the private key. That even just sounds super messy.
00:56:56.790 - 00:57:09.510, Speaker B: Well, yeah, it's messy, but courts do have the power to hold people who do not comply with court orders in contempt. And that means, among other things, you can put them in jail.
00:57:09.930 - 00:57:16.150, Speaker A: Right. I'm just saying that plenty of police have arrested people who still refuse to give up their private keys.
00:57:17.930 - 00:57:35.982, Speaker C: I think practically it'll be very difficult. But theoretically you could get a court order saying pay this amount back, and if you don't, you're in contempt of court. Potentially, you could go to jail for it until you review your private keys. Pay out monies. Potentially, yeah.
00:57:36.036 - 00:58:04.520, Speaker A: I'm just saying it doesn't sound easy to do. The smart contract to me, sounds like nearly impossible. But people are difficult in their own way, different from smart contracts, but even a two year old can be really difficult to manage. But anyway, one other thing that I was so curious about with Celsius was, as everybody has noted on its balance sheet, they said they valued their Cel tokens or sell tokens at $600 million.
00:58:05.290 - 00:58:13.238, Speaker C: That was insane. Absolutely insane. I've tweeted about this. I think the whole is actually 1.8 billion. There's no 1.2 billion.
00:58:13.238 - 00:58:18.458, Speaker C: How can you just create your own coin and ascribe it 600 million when the market cap is nowhere near that?
00:58:18.624 - 00:58:22.010, Speaker A: Yeah, the market cap is about 215,000,000.
00:58:22.160 - 00:58:23.440, Speaker C: Yeah, something like that.
00:58:24.210 - 00:58:42.500, Speaker A: Or at least when I wrote this script, 215. So I was just wondering, first of all, would the bankruptcy kind of judge or whoever's kind of looking at this, would they just consider that blatantly lying? Or is there some way to explain how this number could be justified or what's your take on what they did there?
00:58:43.190 - 00:59:07.210, Speaker B: Where it stands right now, it doesn't really matter. Those numbers in the Machinsky declaration, if and when Celsius ever proposes a plan, it's going to need a disclosure statement and it's going to need to have some discussion about what its assets are and it's going to have to explain itself if it's putting any value on the Celsius tokens.
00:59:09.470 - 00:59:16.800, Speaker A: Okay, so at the moment, this is why it sort of seems pulled out of thin air and not even related to the market cap at.
00:59:17.490 - 00:59:26.610, Speaker B: I mean, as said, you know, he puts in a little graphic in the declaration of unaudited high level financials.
00:59:27.830 - 01:00:03.870, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah. So then the other thing I wanted to ask about this plan was Celsius's intention to basically save itself by mining a lot of bitcoin, but they need the court to approve them finishing building out the mining center. First of all, what's your sense of how likely it is that that will be approved? How feasible do you think this plan is at helping Celsius recoup its costs? I don't know. A part of me when I was reading all this, I was a little bit like, I feel like a lot of this is so similar to how they ran their business. You know what I'm saying? In terms of like the pie in the sky. Yeah.
01:00:03.870 - 01:00:05.854, Speaker A: But I was curious to hear your.
01:00:05.892 - 01:00:29.590, Speaker C: Thoughts, Laura, sort of reading the whole thing. It does look like what Celsius has done is they just want to build a mining business and they've taken a ton of funds from depositors and basically just channeled all of it into the mining business. And they're hoping that this mining business is going to take off. I think they're considering an IPO and then that will all magically pay out and they'll be able to pay back off depositors loans.
01:00:30.010 - 01:00:37.106, Speaker A: I think they think that this is how they'll recoup their losses. But anyway, or at least that's what they're claiming on the initial reading.
01:00:37.138 - 01:00:43.706, Speaker C: It almost seems like if you're a deposited to Celsius, you were investing in their mining business, to be honest. Just on initial oh, I think more.
01:00:43.728 - 01:01:37.190, Speaker B: Than so usually you look at the financials of mining companies and usually they have a good deal of debt that is just to fund the acquisition of their mining rigs. Celsius doesn't have that debt and at least usually it's done as basically a lease of the rigs is the way it's structured. The reason they don't have that debt is because they finance the rigs with customer funds. In some ways, that's the good news for Celsius as a mining business, that the rigs don't seem to be collateral for anyone. What's not clear to me is how high bitcoin prices have to be before for their mining business to be profitable. If bitcoin is at 20,000, the cost of production might exceed the value of any bitcoins they can get. So profitability of the mining business is hugely dependent on the price of bitcoin.
01:01:37.190 - 01:02:43.438, Speaker B: And then the problem that all miners have is that it's an arms race. So there was just an announcement this week that one of the rig manufacturers had been able to come up with. A next generation, even more energy efficient processor. And I don't know how big the energy savings are there, but one possible implication is everyone who's just invested hundreds of millions in mining rigs bought outdated technology that won't be able to compete and they're going to have to put in more money to buy the next generation of rigs. It's an iffy business. And one of the challenges any crypto company is going to have in a bankruptcy is that a bankruptcy plan cannot be confirmed by a court unless the court finds that the plan is feasible. This doesn't mean that the plan is a surefired thing, it's going to necessarily work, but it basically has to be that it's more likely than not that the plan is going to work and that the company isn't going to need to be back in bankruptcy needing further financial restructuring.
01:02:43.438 - 01:03:15.980, Speaker B: And if you have an industry where the viability of a business is so heavily dependent on swings in asset prices, that gets trickier. It's not unprecedented. We have that with like, oil and gas, for example. But here the mining. It presents a real challenge given that oil and gas, it's not unrealistic. The volatility of oil and gas prices is small compared with Bitcoin, let's say.
01:03:17.550 - 01:03:35.154, Speaker A: Another thing I wanted to ask about was this Keyfi lawsuit. We briefly mentioned it earlier for listeners who don't know. It was filed by Jason Stone, who's a former money manager for Celsius. They did not have a formal contract between them, but he was handling lots of money, hundreds of millions of dollars.
01:03:35.272 - 01:03:45.730, Speaker B: Don't you find that funny itself right here's the money manager who's going to manage enormous sums and yet can't be bothered to have a formal contract.
01:03:46.490 - 01:04:45.206, Speaker A: I was having Crypto Capital deja vu, do you know what I'm talking about? With the Tether case? Like, Tether ended up having to loan hundreds of millions of dollars to the parent company because they had entered into some business agreement with Crypto Capital, which was like a sort of shady business in Europe. And Crypto Capital had hundreds of millions of dollars of theirs and for whatever reason got tied up in some kind of, I forget, regulatory, governmental, something rather. And so Tether ended up giving this massive loan to Ifinex is the name of the company. And the New York AG called them out being like, you're saying that you're fully backed, but you just lent all this money out. And so in the end they just, I think, had agreed to give transparency reports after that, but I think they might have had a small fine. But anyway, point is, there was no contract between Ifinex and Cryptocapital. So it just reminded me so much of this.
01:04:45.206 - 01:05:34.680, Speaker A: But essentially Jason Stone, who also by the way, was like a non. It was like zero x one BT or something. He was like a popular Twitter account, but he alleged that Celsius manipulated markets and didn't institute basic accounting controls. He also accused the lender of being a Ponzi scheme. He cited certain instances where, for instance, he knew that they had taken a loan from Tether paying like, X amount in interest, but then were promising customers that they could earn even more in interest, which literally makes zero business sense. But anyway, so he's now suing for damages for an amount to be determined at trial. And I was just wondering, how likely is it, do you think, that Stone sees any money and how would his claims be prioritized against that of customers?
01:05:35.850 - 01:06:16.500, Speaker C: So this is first of all, just to point out, this is probably one of those asset deployment positions which in hindsight proved problematic, obviously, absolutely ridiculous that they are managing this ludicrously large amount of money without a formal contract. So that bit of it is probably true because if it weren't, celsius would have caught it all in the garbage. The rest of it, I'm happy for Adam to sort of expand on it, but if what is being alleged is true, it's obviously things of terrible, terrible mismanagement. But then again, this is a one sided statement at this point, so we have to see how this one plays out. Yeah.
01:06:17.030 - 01:06:32.300, Speaker B: Unfortunately for Stone, even if everything he says is true, all he is is a general unsecured creditor and he stands at the back of the line with all the customers. The fact that he filed a lawsuit doesn't get him anything special.
01:06:33.070 - 01:06:53.700, Speaker A: Okay, so we're going to try to do the last few questions sort of in a rapid style. I was wondering, for the state regulators that are now investigating Celsius, if there's any enforcement action or anything. I'm just wondering how will that affect the bankruptcy or I don't know if they're just kind of unrelated or what you see there.
01:06:54.310 - 01:07:18.102, Speaker B: Depends what they're seeking. Bankruptcy stops any attempt to collect money from the debtor. But if the state regulators are seeking, let's say, a cease and desist order or some sort of prohibition on Machinsky engaging in business in the future that's not stayed by the bankruptcy, they would be able to proceed just in parallel with the bankruptcy then.
01:07:18.236 - 01:08:10.934, Speaker A: Okay. And something I was just curious about was a lot of people are taking issue with how both Celsius and Voyager did marketing. It's been called out, for instance, that Alex Mishinsky, the CEO of Celsius, often wore a T shirt saying, banks are not your friends, when clearly Celsius is like a type of bank. Or the day before they pause the withdrawals, he tweeted at someone who had been saying, like, hey, I'm hearing people aren't able to withdraw from your platform. And he tweeted back, do you even know one person who has a problem withdrawing from Celsius? Why spread FUD fear, uncertainty and doubt and, you know, things like that versus, like, Voyager and talking about your funds are like, your USD is FDIC insured, which now the FDIC is actually investigating. You know, do you see kind of issues with marketing playing any role?
01:08:11.062 - 01:09:05.466, Speaker C: I was going to briefly say I see a huge slew of potential misrepresentation claims across the board because of the way all of these companies operate. Right. And I'm not saying just Voyager and Celsius, but also Triarows Capital, even Terra. It's basically entirely based in customer trust and confidence. And when you're running out of liquidity to start paying off people, what you see all of these guys do with Celsius, with Voyager, and you go back further with Tree AC from the filings, you see sort of Ju and Kao and their employees telling their counterparties. And then you go back further to Doe Quad, sort of tweeting, right? What you want to do is you want to try and maintain confidence and make sure that people don't all start leaving, because when they all start leaving, you have a real problem because of when you have a bank run. But then there's also a question of how accurate the information that you sort of put out in order to stem the bank run.
01:09:05.466 - 01:09:08.982, Speaker C: And I think this is a question that will take a while to be decided.
01:09:09.126 - 01:10:03.866, Speaker B: There's certainly the possibility of misrepresentation claims. Some of them might be against Celsius and some might be against Machinsky himself. To the extent that it's a claim against Celsius, I don't think that gets that changes anything. Because if Celsius already owed you $100,000, how are you harmed by the misrepresentation that you didn't yank the money the day before the bankruptcy when it would have been clawed when it probably would get clawed back? Anyhow, I don't think it changes what your claim is in the bankruptcy. It's sort of like two breaches of contract don't get you anything more than one breach of contract. Where it may be different, though, is if there are misrepresentation claims against Machinsky himself and where he is personally liable, those would not normally be covered by the bankruptcy. That's not a claim against Celsius.
01:10:03.866 - 01:10:53.150, Speaker B: It's a claim against Machinsky. Presumably any Celsius bankruptcy plan will have third party releases in it, which will deem Celsius'customers to have released various third parties, including Machinsky. But that's going to be a hard fought issue, and lurking in the background is the US. Law on the availability of third party releases may well change before this bankruptcy is finished. And this is a really hotly contested issue in Purdue Pharma's bankruptcy with the Sackler family. There's an appeal pending of that right now, and we could very well see a change in the law that would limit Machinsky's ability to get a release in the Celsius bankruptcy.
01:10:54.930 - 01:11:11.714, Speaker A: Okay. And I did have people tweeting asking things like whether any of the co founders or CEOs of any of these, you know, Machinsky or Steven Aerlick of Voyager or Kyle and sue. What are the ODS that any of these people does any jail time I.
01:11:11.752 - 01:11:38.038, Speaker C: Knew the question is going to come up and right before this, I went and gave myself a ten minute primer on what Singapore laws look like when it comes to sort of criminal liability for all this. I'm not that sure about the US, but based on what has actually come out, there's a few ways this plays out. First of all, the Monetary Authority of Singapore has sort of issued a reprimand to the Three Arrows founders.
01:11:38.214 - 01:11:46.190, Speaker A: Wait, and just one quick question. So I believe sue and Kyle are American, but you were saying it's just because Three Arrows was based in Singapore.
01:11:46.690 - 01:12:25.610, Speaker C: They were in Singapore at the time they were doing these things. So presumably Singapore criminal law would apply because they were operating Three Arrows Capital out of Singapore. The MAS Montreal Authority of Singapore issued a reprimand to, I think it was sue and Karl maybe just trialls, saying that they had breached the securities and Futures Act. I believe the provision referred to potentially carries a jail term of up to two years if convicted. If convicted. That's the main point under the general criminal law. I think in the UK you have it fraud, but I think in Singapore it just comes as a general category called cheating.
01:12:25.610 - 01:14:10.278, Speaker C: And I'm just going to read it out because I've been in front of me. By deceiving any person, whether or not such deception was the sole or main inducement fraudulently or dishonestly induces the person deceived to deliver or cost the delivery of any property to any person or to consent that any person shall retain any property or intentionally induces the person deceived to do or omit to do anything which he would not do or omit to do if he were not so deceived and which act omission causes or is likely to cause damage or harm to any person in body, mind, reputation or property. Is it to cheat? So that is a complete mouthful and sorry for sort of inflicting that on everyone. But essentially there is a question of whether some of the behavior which you see the correspondence to the affidavit that came out from the TRIAC liquidators that sue and Carl may have sort of misled their investors as to the state of the company as to the state of the finances of Trierrow's Capital and therefore induced these customers to keep their funds within Triaro's Capital when they otherwise want to put it is. And this sort of comes back to the sort of article we're discussing earlier before this call, right, where sue and Carl said the lenders were comfortable with a financial position. But the fact is, based on everything we've seen, from all the WhatsApp messages and discord messages and telegram messages and whatnot, it looks like, they just straight up lied about their exposure to terror and their financial position. So there's a question there, but the issue with this criminal stuff is who actually brings the claim and I Googled this, and I read through this very briefly.
01:14:10.278 - 01:14:40.610, Speaker C: The prosecutor in Singapore is to bring the claim. So the Attorney's General Chambers is to bring the claim, and they have a discretion as to whether or not to bring it. And this discretion will be based on how likely things are going to succeed, whether it's public policy is the best interest of public policy, et cetera. So the gating mechanism of whether anyone's going to go to jail is whether or not the Attorney's General Chambers actually decides to prosecute.
01:14:40.770 - 01:14:58.090, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah. And I think the Blockchain letter sort of would be another piece of evidence, or at least that's what they seem to be trying to imply. Blockchain.com in terms of the so maybe, Adam, you can answer for Machinsky, because I believe Stephen Ehrlich probably is Canadian.
01:14:58.430 - 01:15:20.782, Speaker B: The fact that their citizenship is not going to determine what law. So there could be criminal violations potentially in more than one jurisdiction. Also, I think you need to divide this into pre bankruptcy behavior and behavior in the bankruptcy for pre bankruptcy behavior. Three Arrows capital.
01:15:20.846 - 01:15:21.026, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:15:21.048 - 01:16:25.106, Speaker B: There's some indications that there may have been fraud. Whether that rises to the level of criminal fraud in Singapore or in the might if you have kind of an underlying fraud that can then be the predicate for wire fraud or mail fraud, those would be federal prosecutions. I have no idea if there's any interest at this point from the Department of justice of even touching this stuff. Celsius also, if you look what's in the key phi lawsuit, there are some implications of fraud there, too, and that if I were Machinsky, I'd be a little concerned about that. And then Celsius has another weird problem. In, I think, 2018 or 2019, celsius entered into a consent order with the State of Washington for engaging in unlicensed money transmission, among other things. And the consent order, basically, Celsius just promised it wouldn't do that in Washington anymore.
01:16:25.106 - 01:17:06.946, Speaker B: And Celsius stopped taking having State of Washington accounts after that. Consent order doesn't really spell out what Washington thought constituted the money transmission, but presumably, if it was unlicensed money transmission in Washington, it would also be that in many other states and Celsius doesn't have a money transmitter license. It is a federal felony to operate a money transmission business in the US. Without a state license. So there may be another problem there for Celsius. Again, it would require the Department of justice to actually think this is worth pursuing. And they may just know, look, we've got plenty of other fish to fry.
01:17:06.946 - 01:17:15.862, Speaker B: Why get into this whole crypto area, which is politically charged, and let the market sort it out in some way?
01:17:15.996 - 01:17:17.826, Speaker C: That's all the pre bankruptcy they seem.
01:17:17.858 - 01:17:20.006, Speaker A: To like doing the crypto cases, in my opinion.
01:17:20.038 - 01:18:06.600, Speaker B: But anyway, they like doing the hacker cases or where it's the money laundering cases. This is different. That's the pre bankruptcy stuff. I don't see anything with Voyager yet that indicates anything other. Voyager just seems stupid, but not criminal. You don't go to jail for being stupid, otherwise this country would look very different. But there's also in the bankruptcy, if you knowingly and fraudulently conceal assets or books and records related to assets from any basically custodian or officer of the court, that is a bankruptcy crime in the US.
01:18:06.600 - 01:19:09.066, Speaker B: And that might be a problem with three arrows, right. If they don't turn over the private keys, arguably that's knowingly and fraudulently withholding from custodian or other officer of the court any recorded information related to the property or financial affairs of a debtor that you can be looking at up to five years of jail time for that. The hook for US law there is that there is this Title 15 case that got filed in the Southern District of New York, and Title 15 cases are really meant to just kind of be a mechanism for coordinating bankruptcies that are primarily outside of the US. The main show is not New York, but to the extent there are assets in New York, it creates a coordination mechanism, but that's enough to trigger US bankruptcy crime statutes. Given that the main show is outside the US. I don't know if anyone I'm happy.
01:19:09.088 - 01:19:40.710, Speaker C: To sort of jump in here because I was just scrolling through this and yes, there is a criminal offense for dishonest and fraudulent removal consumement of property to prevent distribution of creditors. So there absolutely is that equivalent in Singapore, and we expect most of the rest of the world. So if they start being incredibly, incredibly non cooperative, it may seem that they may have to run off to Dubai or somewhere else just to stay out of jail. Although there is a question of whether there is a Dubai.
01:19:41.290 - 01:19:43.814, Speaker B: I don't think Dubai has an extradition treaty with you.
01:19:43.852 - 01:19:46.870, Speaker C: No, it doesn't. I've looked into this one. It doesn't have an extradition.
01:19:48.570 - 01:19:55.802, Speaker A: Mean. So I don't know if you saw in the Bloomberg article, they are in the process of moving to Dubai. So what does that say to you?
01:19:55.936 - 01:19:56.998, Speaker B: They're worried.
01:19:57.174 - 01:20:14.580, Speaker C: Yeah, they want to get away from Singapore. They want to get away from the MAS. They definitely don't want to be in the mean. Dubai is like the place where you go. It's it's got a pretty dodgy reputation, right? Little bit.
01:20:15.350 - 01:20:17.010, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, totally.
01:20:18.870 - 01:20:22.690, Speaker B: Nothing that can't be cured by sponsoring some soccer teams.
01:20:25.350 - 01:20:29.814, Speaker A: Okay, then. How long do you expect each of these bankruptcies to play out?
01:20:29.932 - 01:20:31.686, Speaker B: Two to three years, I think.
01:20:31.788 - 01:20:33.350, Speaker C: Yeah, two to three years is probably.
01:20:33.420 - 01:20:53.420, Speaker B: About these are not going to be fast. I mean, it's hard to give a real accurate guess at this point, but two to three years, I think, before we see a plan confirmed how long it takes for all the assets to be fully administered. That could take much longer.
01:20:54.930 - 01:22:04.126, Speaker C: I think the sort of precedent we may have for this is I mean, just look at the Mount Gox stuff, right? It's taken absolutely years to play out. Was it 2014? Something like way before I even did anything crypto related or knew what crypto was when it all happened on the Mount Gox thing. Actually, there's a fairly interesting point here, given the length of time it took, because I believe the bitcoin that was sitting in Montgomery this goes back to the question we're discussing, probably close an hour earlier. The bitcoin in there have appreciated massively in value in the last eight years or so, and it looks like they've actually come to a fair distribution, where there has been some sort of civil rehabilitation proceeding, such that the creditors seem to be able to enjoy the upside rather than the company just magically becoming solvent, mainly just by bitcoin price appreciation. So this may be good news for the Tree AC creditors. Maybe there is a solution somewhere where you don't get liquidated at 18K when Bitcoin goes to whatever it is. We're hoping.
01:22:04.238 - 01:22:12.200, Speaker A: Do you think it's likely that Celsius and Voyager or either one of them will eventually be up and running again as a business?
01:22:13.450 - 01:22:14.630, Speaker B: Unlikely.
01:22:15.610 - 01:22:17.634, Speaker A: And WattsI lawyer, do you have an opinion?
01:22:17.762 - 01:22:30.620, Speaker C: I don't know. It depends. They clearly want to. They clearly want to because it's chapter eleven. But I think Adam's comment is coming from the fact that you need confidence to operate a spec.
01:22:32.190 - 01:22:35.120, Speaker B: The filing of eleven. Yes, they may want to, but.
01:22:37.330 - 01:22:37.646, Speaker C: Even.
01:22:37.668 - 01:22:44.270, Speaker B: If Kirkland and Alice looked at this and said, you have no chance of reorganizing, they would still file them for eleven, not for seven.
01:22:44.420 - 01:23:05.650, Speaker A: Oh, I see. Okay, last question. Now, truly, as you all know, co founder Su Zhu of Three Arrows Capital said that he was creditor of Three Arrows for $5 million. And co founder Kyle Davy's wife, Kelly Chen, said she was owed 65.7 million. What's the likelihood that sue and then also Kyle's wife, receive anything as creditors?
01:23:05.810 - 01:23:43.758, Speaker C: To be honest, it depends on the nature of the loan agreement or of this arrangement. It could not be a legitimate loan. It could be just them claiming that they were owed monies. Because the evidence we've seen that's sort of been put out is a very short email, a document that literally says, okay, we confirmed that we owe you this amount of money. Can the shareholder legitimately be accredited of a company? Yes. Is this the case? We don't know. Is it likely they're going to be net up out of all this? I really doubt it, because we can go into this more detail, but don't keep Adam with all of the potential clawbacks against Kyle and sue.
01:23:43.758 - 01:24:10.220, Speaker C: I could go on all day about know potentially wrongful trading, fraudulent trading, unfair preferences, which operates in a very similar way to what Adam described early on. Breach of director duties. There's a whole list and there's the personal claims that are going to be showing up against them as so yeah, I think we probably need more information there. But could it be legitimate? Yes, but is it really? We don't know.
01:24:10.830 - 01:25:06.282, Speaker B: I don't know enough about British Virgin Island liquidation proceedings to know how they would be treated. I can say that in a US bankruptcy case there is. First, the question is, do you actually characterize the relationship as a loan, as wasee lawyer was saying? Or do you say, well, it's actually more like an equity contribution, or maybe it's just bullshit and there is nothing there. But even if you say it's a loan, you would expect to see insiders in a Chapter Eleven case. You'd expect to see insider positions classified separately from other creditor claims and probably subordinated, which means in this case, it would be getting nothing. So I would expect for Celsius, for example, that Celsius insiders would be put in a different class and will get no recovery. That I can't imagine Machinsky walking away with a penny from Celsius.
01:25:06.426 - 01:25:35.990, Speaker C: Adam, can I ask you one question, please? I'm sorry, I've been dying to ask you this question on the Voyager sort of draft, the way they've sort of set up the creditor classes where they've segregated account holders from unsecured creditors. Is there a world where because of you guys having cross class cram down, is there a world where account holders say, Fuck no, this is a terrible deal, and the secured creditors hit the right majority and they get a cram down of the plan? Is there a world where that happens?
01:25:36.060 - 01:26:01.934, Speaker B: Yes. You only need one. So, bankruptcy voting. There are two ways you can confirm a bankruptcy plan. You can confirm it consensually, or with what's called cram down. And that's the plan being cram down the throats of the non consenting creditors. We have a technique called cram up, and you can imagine what that might be with a consensual plan.
01:26:01.934 - 01:26:26.354, Speaker B: It's a little bit of a misnomer. It doesn't mean that everyone agrees to it. It means that every class that is impaired has voted for the plan by a requisite majority. A crammed down plan, in contrast, needs only a single class voting for the plan. And that single class could even be a class that has one creditor in it. Right. There are rules on how you can classify creditors.
01:26:26.354 - 01:26:37.020, Speaker B: There's some restrictions, but you could have a class. Maybe it's vendors, or maybe it's a class just of small claims that.
01:26:38.750 - 01:26:39.158, Speaker C: Votes.
01:26:39.174 - 01:26:43.200, Speaker B: For the plan and they force it down on everyone else. That's entirely possible.
01:26:44.610 - 01:26:56.370, Speaker A: All right, well, we will have to see how it all plays out. So, you guys, this has been an amazing conversation. I so appreciate that you shared your knowledge. Where can people learn more about each of you and your work?
01:26:56.520 - 01:27:04.930, Speaker C: Yes, I mean, I'm an hentai anime penguin in a suit. You can follow me. Twitter wasi lawyer. Sometimes I'm also a lawyer.
01:27:05.270 - 01:27:44.942, Speaker B: So you can follow me on Twitter too, at adamlevitin or I also blog@creditslips.org, and otherwise you can read my scholarship. You can find it on SSRN. Most relevant for this area is a forthcoming article with the very original title of Not Your Keys, Not Your Coins, but it's 70 plus pages of detail about how we might characterize custody relationships with cryptocurrency, exchanges and brokers. And that's coming out in volume 101 of the Texas Law Review.
01:27:45.076 - 01:27:48.638, Speaker A: All right, well, it has been a pleasure having both of you on Unchained.
01:27:48.814 - 01:27:49.202, Speaker C: Awesome.
