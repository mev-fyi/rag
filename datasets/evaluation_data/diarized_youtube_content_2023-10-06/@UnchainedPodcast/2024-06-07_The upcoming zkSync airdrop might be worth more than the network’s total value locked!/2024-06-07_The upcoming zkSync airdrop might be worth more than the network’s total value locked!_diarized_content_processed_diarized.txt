00:00:00.160 - 00:00:49.170, Speaker A: Could the Zksync Airdrop be worth more than the network's total value? Locked the upcoming ZK token airdrop from Zksync, an ethereum scaling solution, might exceed the network's TVL by a significant margin. Currently, Zksync's TvL stands at $852 million, with a 10% airdrop of its 21 billion token supply valued at token, the market capitalization would reach $1.32 billion. This is almost double Zksync's current TVL. This potential valuation highlights a disconnect between airdrop size and network value. For comparison, Arbitrum's market cap is only 16% of its TVL, and mode's token is less than 10% of its TVL. The fully diluted valuation of ZK could hit $13 billion, similar to Starknet's STRK and higher than Arbitrum's $11 billion.
