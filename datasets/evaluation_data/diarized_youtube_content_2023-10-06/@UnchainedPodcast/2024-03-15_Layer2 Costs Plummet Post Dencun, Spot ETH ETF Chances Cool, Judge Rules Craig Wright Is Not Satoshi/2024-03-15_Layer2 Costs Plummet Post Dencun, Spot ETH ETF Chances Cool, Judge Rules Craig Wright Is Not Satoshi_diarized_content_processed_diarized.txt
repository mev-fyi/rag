00:00:01.370 - 00:00:30.194, Speaker A: Welcome to this week's crypto roundup. This week, Ethereum completed its stanking upgrade. Bitcoin blasted past its all time high, and the success of US traded spot bitcoin ETF has driven some issuers to make adjustments to remain competitive. A Bloomberg ETF analyst turned more bearish about potential spot ETH ETF approvals, plus legal updates for some crypto evuites and much more. Thanks for tuning in. This episode was written by Brandy Betts and edited by Jeannie Kim. I'm Megan Christensen.
00:00:30.194 - 00:01:28.810, Speaker A: Let's jump in. The much anticipated duncan upgrade has led to a significant reduction in transaction fees on Ethereum L2 networks. The Duncan upgrade went live early on Wednesday after it activated on the Ethereum main net at epic height 269568. The upgrade introduced the highly anticipated protodank sharding functionality via EIP 4844, which integrates offchain quote data blobs, end quote, that decrease the costs associated with storing transaction data. Ethereum L2 networks, which are designed to provide a faster, cheaper route to executing transactions on the underlying blockchain, were the biggest beneficiaries of the upgrade. In the first day after the upgrade, median transaction fees had dropped to zero five on optimism, zero 64 on base, zero five in arbitrum, and 00:16 on ZK sync era. So far, optimism and chains based on optimism's tech stack, such as base, have seen the biggest reductions in fees.
00:01:28.810 - 00:02:39.120, Speaker A: After the strong debute of the spot bitcoin ETFs, investor attention turned toward when spot ether ETFs might soon receive regulatory approval. The SEC has a May 23 deadline to make a final decision on the first of the spot ETH ETF applications. However, Bloomberg analyst Eric Belhones revised his estimate downward of the likelihood of an SEC approval in May. He now wagers a 35% chance of an approval by the deadline, compared to its production in January, of a 70% likelihood. Belhoonus said that while the probability is halved, it is not zero and an approval may still happen in the long term. Other experts, including James Seifert and Jake Chavinsky, chief legal officer for the valiant fund, echoled volunis, noting minimal activity from relevant parties and concerns about the SEC's apparent reluctance to engage in necessary discussions for approval. Issuers are adjusting fees and launching spinoffs amid the booming market for spot bitcoin ETFs, which have collectively amassed over 55 billion in assets under management within two months of their launch, signaling a positive shift in main street investor sentiment as well as market dynamics within the cryptocurrency space.
00:02:39.120 - 00:03:40.740, Speaker A: Fan EC has cut the fees to zero for its spot bitcoin ETF, with the ticker Vodal opting to waive management fees entirely for a year. The move was a strategic response to a competitive market that has been dominated by BlackRock's iShares bitcoin ETF, and it worked. The fee reduction spurred a surge of investment, with Hodl experiencing a record breaking 119,000,000 in inflows on the day following the announcement. Meanwhile, Grayscale bitcoin Trust, which has experienced outflows partly due to its comparatively higher fees, filed with the SEC to create the grayscale bitcoin minitrust, a spinoff that would offer a lower cost alternative to its flagship product. GBTC has seen outflows of over 11 billion since its conversion into an ETF. In a significant legal development, the US District Court for the Southern District of New York has rejected motions from Genesis and Gemini to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the SEC. The SEC alleges that the two crypto firms offered and sold unregistered security products through the Gemini earn program.
00:03:40.740 - 00:04:39.170, Speaker A: Judge Edgardo Ramos, presiding over the case, ruled that the SEC's complaint was plausible enough for the case to continue to court. The Gemini earn program at the heart of the case promised retail customers up to 8% interest on tokens invested through the platform. Gemini earn withdrawals were halted when its lending partner, Genesis, struggled to meet demands amid the market turbulence triggered by the collapse of FTX and Alameda research. Gemini then terminated the earn program, leading to the SEC's lawsuit alleging billions of dollars were collected from investors without adequate risk disclosures. The legal case is unfolding alongside Gemini's commitment to reimburse affected customers up to $1.1 billion as part of a settlement with the New York State Department of Financial Services, coupled with a $37 million fine for compliance shortcomings. The denial of Genesis and Gemini's motions to dismiss continues illegal confrontations between major players in the crypto industry and regulatory authorities.
00:04:39.170 - 00:05:33.990, Speaker A: The SEC has also initiated legal action against crypto exchanges Coinbase Kraken and Binance over alleged illegal securities offerings. Notably, Binance has settled with other regulatory bodies for various violations, but its case with the SEC remains ongoing. Speaking of Binance, former Binance CEO Chingpeng Zhao, known as CZ, was ordered to surrender his passport under a modified bail bond ahead of his sentencing hearing. According to court documents filed with the US district Court in Seattle on March 11. Zhao now has to inform pretrial services before conducting any interstate travel within the United States and surrender his canadian passport to a third party who was under the supervision of his counsel. These modifications mark the second change to Zhao's bail bond. He was previously forbidden from leaving the US, overturning an earlier agreement that would have allowed him to travel to the United Arab Emirates.
00:05:33.990 - 00:06:05.470, Speaker A: Zhao had offered his 4.5 billion stake in Binance as a security for his return, but a judge wasn't convinced. Zao's legal troubles stemmed from his guilty plea to violating the Bank Secrecy act and failing to maintain an effective antimoney laundering program at finance. As part of his plea deal, he stepped down as CEO and Binance was fined 4.3 billion. Currently released on $175,000,000 bond. Zao awaits his sentencing hearing, originally scheduled for February 23, but postponed to April 30.
00:06:05.470 - 00:07:16.790, Speaker A: In other crypto related courtroom news, Roman Sterlingov, the russian swedish national standing trial in the US for his alleged involvement with bitcoin mining protocol bitcoin fog, has been found guilty on charges related to conspiracy, money laundering and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. The verdict in the US District Court for the District of Columbia leaves Sterlingham facing a maximum of 50 years in prison. His sentencing is scheduled for July 15. Prosecutors argued that Sterlingov operated bitcoin fog from October 2011 to April 2021, facilitating the laundering of approximately 400 million predominantly sourced from darknet markets engaged in illicit activities such as drug trading and identity theft. The court determined that Sterlingov marketed bitcoin fog as a tool for anonymizing bitcoin transactions to evade law enforcement, charging fees primarily to users of darknet markets like Silk Road, agora and Alphabet. The defense team had argued that prosecutors failed to conclusively prove Sterlingov's connection to bitcoin fog, and they questioned the jurisdictional reach of the US government in an international case. Sterlingov's attorneys plan to appeal the verdict.
00:07:16.790 - 00:07:50.910, Speaker A: A UK judge has declared that the infamous Craig Wright is not bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto. Wright was sued by the crypto open patent alliance over alleged forgeries and attempts to claim he is the creator of bitcoin. Judge James Miller made some stark declarative remarks prior to issuing his final ruling. Quote first, that Dr. Wright is not the author of the bitcoin white paper. Second, Dr. Wright is not the person who adopted or operated under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto in the period 2008 to 2011.
00:07:50.910 - 00:08:38.606, Speaker A: 3rd, Dr. Wright is not the person who created the bitcoin system and fourth, he is not the author of the initial versions of the bitcoin software, end quote. Wright's public claims of being behind the pseudonymous author of the bitcoin White paper began all the way back in 2016 in an interview with the BBC. The veracity of Wright's claims have long been disputed by bitcoin users, as he has never been able to provide cryptographic signatures related to addresses presumed to belong to Satoshi and moving on to Elon. Speaking at an event at a Tesla factory in Germany on Wednesday, Elon Musk was asked, quote, when can you buy a Tesla with dogecoin? End quote. Musk answered, quote, you know, at some point I think we should enable that. End quote.
00:08:38.606 - 00:09:41.110, Speaker A: In a video originally uploaded by ex user at Doge official CEO, quote, you can buy Tesla merch with Doge, which is cool, so dogecoin to the moon. End quote. Ending things on a lighter note, nearly $690,000 in funds were raised to put the dog with hat meme on the Las Vegas spear, massive spherical entertainment venue with LED displays that wrap around its interior and exterior. The popular dog of hat meme features the image of a shibu Inu puppy sporting a pink woven beanie. Donors to the cause transferred USDC stablecoins into a multisig wallet controlled by five individuals. The fundraiser exceeded its target of 650,000 to reach a total of 688 469 within a few days, with the Salana based meme coin associated with dog with hat surged along with the fundraiser to become one of the most actively traded assets on Salana based decentralized exchanges. And that's all.
