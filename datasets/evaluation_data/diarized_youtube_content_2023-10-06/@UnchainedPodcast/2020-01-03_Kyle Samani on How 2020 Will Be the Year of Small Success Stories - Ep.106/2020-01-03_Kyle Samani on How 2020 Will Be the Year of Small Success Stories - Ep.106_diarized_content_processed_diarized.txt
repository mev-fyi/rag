00:01:18.498 - 00:01:19.682, Speaker A: Welcome, Kyle.
00:01:19.826 - 00:01:22.614, Speaker B: Hey, Laura. Good morning. Great to be back on.
00:01:22.812 - 00:01:36.730, Speaker A: Last month you published a blog post called The Web Three Stack 2019 edition. This was basically an update on a 2018 post on the same topic. How would you say the Web Three Stack has changed from 2018 to 2019?
00:01:37.150 - 00:02:17.522, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think the most important thing that's changed since then has been just the maturation of the stack. And then the actual really key element that I highlight in the post is how the stack is becoming a lot more heterogeneous. So let me touch on both of those in terms of maturation. When I published the first version in July of 2018, EOS had just launched. Like Tazos was kind of sort of in the process of launching. There still wasn't DFI, I don't even think was actually a term yet at the time, and a lot of the kind of off chain services were basically not working. So I kind of had proposed at that time what I thought the stack was going to look like, but it was actually still relatively speculative.
00:02:17.522 - 00:02:58.850, Speaker B: Fast forward 18 months and we've seen just a tremendous amount of activity happen. There's now 600, $700 million of capital locked in these DFI or open finance protocols. So there's a very robust ecosystem there. There's now tons of off chain services running at meaningful scale, things like the Graph, things like Live Peer and others and Arweave. So just the stack has just come much, much further and you can now start to see kind of the early pieces working. The other major trend that's evolved, and I really emphasize this in the post, is how the stack is becoming a lot more heterogeneous. And by that I mean it's no longer just that things are being built only on Ethereum.
00:02:58.850 - 00:03:19.980, Speaker B: There's now active communities around EOS, around Tezos, around Polkadot, around Solana, around near around Cosmos. And each of these ecosystems is starting to see development activity. And so the stack as a whole is actually kind of becoming just like there's more different pieces working together in kind of different places and that's really a really exciting trend and opportunity.
00:03:21.150 - 00:03:53.640, Speaker A: That's interesting that you bring that point up because I've also heard people argue it the other way, that a lot of developers want to build on Ethereum to take advantage of the synergies of building on a platform where their project could interact with a lot of these other popular projects such as MakerDAO or compound. So if you were to kind of break out, maybe I don't know if percentages is too strong a word for it, but just where do you see the momentum going? Do you still see it really staying with Ethereum? Or do you see it as a lot of people just saying, no, we don't have to be there?
00:03:54.250 - 00:04:30.980, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think it depends on the type of application. So today if you're building an open finance application, it's almost certain that Ethereum is probably the best place to build as of the current moment. However, there's a lot of people building applications that's not their primary objective. So if you consider, for example, what Terra is doing, what Audius is doing, what Brave is trying to do, there's lots of different teams out there today who their primary gaining factor is. They need scale. They need to be able to support millions of users. And the simple truth is that you just can't do that on Ethereum today.
00:04:30.980 - 00:04:58.540, Speaker B: And there's actually a ton of open questions on if and how you'll be able to do that on Ethereum in, call it two years time. There's a lot of very rational people who are saying, look, I cannot launch on a system that doesn't support 5 million users. And so those people are going elsewhere. And now that the other chains are launching and kind of maturing their respective development toolings, we're starting to see those kinds of applications start to roll out.
00:04:59.070 - 00:05:21.250, Speaker A: And in that kind of scenario where someone's saying we need a chain that will support 5 million users, is it one of those situations where kind of like ability to interact with other projects just matters less? Because I believe that there probably is some sort of trade off. And so what are the scenarios where the trade off is worth it?
00:05:21.400 - 00:06:00.254, Speaker B: Yeah, there certainly is some intrinsic trade off in terms of lack of call it composability right, with kind of the stuff in Ethereum today. In fact, the entire point of Cosmos is basically to address this problem. Kind of the thesis for Cosmos is, look, there's going to be lots of chains out there different chains are going to specialize in different use cases and different features and whatever. And then kind of Cosmos basically their claim is like, we're going to be the glue that brings it all together. It's unclear if that will work. There's still lots of risk and it's not clear that will happen, but that's certainly one way the world could play out. And if it does, then Cosmos is likely to be a pretty good beneficiary of that.
00:06:00.254 - 00:06:35.046, Speaker B: Yeah, there are very real trade offs. So for example, if you look at, let's say Terra. Terra, I think has something like half a million users right now, and that's up from zero basically six months ago. Like for them, their users for now are very focused on reducing transaction costs in e commerce in Korea and Southeast Asia. And they actually have some pretty good arguments on how and why they can do that. And for now they don't really need DFI stuff. What I could expect to happen, let's say if you fast forward twelve or 18 months, is people might say, let's say they have one and a half, two and a half, 3 million users, whatever.
00:06:35.046 - 00:07:04.740, Speaker B: Now all of a sudden what I think you'll start to see is you'll start to see people who are building D Five protocols say, hey, look, I know there's 3 million users over there, I'm going to go to them. Right? And so we're going to kind of see this push and pull between people saying, look, I want to build on Ethereum because of the kind of developer tooling and composability of the existing ecosystem. And other people are going to say, yes, but I see 3 million people over here doing this very specific thing and I want to tap into that market and that's just going to be kind of like the natural push and pull.
00:07:05.190 - 00:07:16.840, Speaker A: And let's also talk about the fact that Ethereum is trying to make this transition to Ethereum 2.0. How is that playing into the calculus that developers make when they're choosing where to base their project?
00:07:17.690 - 00:07:51.314, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I can say pretty definitively that we don't really know how Ethereum 2.0 is going to work. There's some high level ideas of how it's actually going to work, but there's quite a few pretty structural and fundamental open questions. So actually right around DevCon, so this was about six weeks ago or seven weeks ago, they changed the structure of the system pretty substantially. They changed the shard count and how their shards are going to be cross linked. There's all kinds of implications for nodes running and how things are going to talk across shards. My point is that that happened seven weeks ago.
00:07:51.314 - 00:08:17.418, Speaker B: The spec for E Two, Phase Zero, was theoretically frozen in June. And so obviously the spec wasn't actually frozen in June. They just thought they were freezing it in June. Right. And so there's a lot of pieces still moving and evolving we can also see that the Ethereum team is looking at what other teams are doing and adapting and some of their ideas. And so the one thing I can say definitively is we just don't actually know what E 2.0 is going to look like.
00:08:17.418 - 00:08:47.560, Speaker B: And there's very pretty reasonable probability that the final product is not even something that is currently in scope or currently planned. And so given that reality, developers today have a really hard choice of saying, okay, well, do I put my eggs in this basket not really knowing where this ship is going? Or do I try and go elsewhere somewhere where I feel more conviction and more certainty in kind of the medium to long term platform? And again, that's not an easy question to answer. And every developer is going to kind of view that in different ways.
00:08:48.010 - 00:08:59.986, Speaker A: And amongst the various chains that could benefit from the uncertainty on Ethereum or the lack of scalability there, who do you see right now as gaining the most momentum?
00:09:00.178 - 00:09:49.250, Speaker B: Yeah, so I'd say the chains I'm probably most immediately excited about at the moment are Near, Solana, and Cadena. So Cadena actually, basically, I think they launched a few days ago. They enabled token transfers and they're enabling smart contracts in like a couple of so very, very kind of imminently. They really have had some breakthroughs in programming languages and they actually have a handful of early, pretty large customers using the system, or they'll be using the system over the next few weeks. They've announced those releases on their website and stuff. Near and Solana, I'm really excited about as, really, I think kind of the two preeminent teams building next generation proof of stake chains, nier and Solana are kind of taking, I'd say, almost opposite approaches to the problem. Solana is really focused on how do we scale these systems without Sharding? And then really near is probably today the strongest team in the world in the kind of building Sharded blockchains.
00:09:49.250 - 00:10:43.386, Speaker B: Salana is kind of going live right now in kind of a very quiet stealth mode and they're going to kind of open up over the course of Q One. And near is also launching in Q One. Both teams, both have beta programs, both have dozens of developers who are building in their beta programs now. And those teams will start to announce the people building in those respective ecosystems over the next few months. But I feel pretty strongly that as those chains launch, they will be the strongest in terms of coming out of the gate showing that A, these things work, and B, that there's actual real world utility and people can build third party applications on them that operate at some meaningful level of scale. If you look at Ethereum back in 2015, if you look at EOS, if you look at Cosmos, if you look at Tazos, look at algorithm, if you look at Hashgraph, those have been all kind of the major chains that have launched over the last four years. All of them, basically, they launched and then they just kind of like they didn't do much.
00:10:43.386 - 00:11:04.110, Speaker B: And I think what we'll see with these next generation chains like cadena, solana and nier is that they're going to launch and actually, very quickly, you're going to start to see people do things because they've been able to. Have strong lead times with beta programs and developer SDKs and have been kind of doing the business development work and showcasing to developers what their technologies can do.
00:11:04.260 - 00:11:34.410, Speaker A: All right, we're going to talk a little bit more about how this competition in the smart contract space will play out.

Yet one thing that I noticed when I was looking at the graphs that you made for your blog post is that the smart contract platform space has so much competition.
00:13:08.770 - 00:13:36.770, Speaker A: Like, you had the one chart where you kind of just gave the overview, and then in the second chart, you attached different project names to each of the different kind of areas of development that you noted in the first graph, and that was the one that easily had just had the most kind of competing projects there. So why do you think that is and how do you think that's going to play out? Do you think we're going to see multiple smart contract platforms that prevail? And if so, how will they be differentiated?
00:13:37.110 - 00:14:20.746, Speaker B: Yeah, we can say with near 100% certainty that there's going to be a lot of chains over the next few years. Most of these teams have been able to raise quite a bit of capital. And if they're going to launch stuff, it's unclear how used each of those chains will be, but certainly they're going to launch. And that's not really a question. And kind of part of the reason that I made this post to begin with was recognizing that this ecosystem as a whole is already becoming more heterogeneous. And I think that is actually going to accelerate meaningfully over the next 24 to 36 months. What happens 36 months from now is much less clear, but surely we're just going to see a real this is real competition.
00:14:20.746 - 00:14:56.666, Speaker B: That's kind of the second part of your question, I think. The first part of your question on why are there so many people going after this layer of the stack? That I think, is that most kind of strong systems engineers who look at the space, they realize just how paramount it is to really nail the layer one ecosystem. And a lot of super smart people all over the world realize that. And they're all saying, well, look, this is a huge opportunity. Look at the market cap of Bitcoin, look at the market cap of Ethereum. And pretty quickly you realize that these things are competing to be money. I actually wrote about this in an essay maybe six or eight months ago.
00:14:56.666 - 00:15:30.306, Speaker B: It's on the multicoin blog. It's called On Value Capture at layer one and L2. And I basically made the argument that all layer ones are competing to be money. And I think all of these developers kind of realize that some of them talk about their systems more in terms of technology. But at the end of the day, these things are kind of aiming to be money. And so when the market size is really big, whether you think it's going to be a really crucial piece of technology, it's actually very rational for lots of teams to swing for the fences, and it's actually rational for investors to invest and try and land in the one that is going to be the big winner.
00:15:30.498 - 00:15:45.260, Speaker A: And I'm also curious, you've brought up Cosmos a couple of times. Cosmos and Polkadot are trying to bring interoperability and connect different chains to each other between those. Do you feel like one of them is kind of prevailing in that space?
00:15:46.110 - 00:16:30.770, Speaker B: Yeah. So what? Polkadot is supposed to launch in February or so at least that's kind of last I heard pretty definitively, what is launching in February is not what was actually outlined originally. What was outlined originally was that you'd have this relay chain that you'd have these parachains that connect into it that they would share one common security pool and there would be kind of a magical way for all these things to communicate with one another. Only about half of what I just described is actually launching in February. Really the most important part, which is making all of these things be able to communicate that is not launching in February. It's not clear if and when that will launch. And so for now, what polka dot is launching doesn't really enable directly what they kind of promised.
00:16:30.770 - 00:17:05.090, Speaker B: To be fair, the same is true of Cosmos. Cosmos just kind of has like a twelve month head start. What Cosmos launched, they launched, I think, in March of 2019. And V one they launched didn't enable all of the cross chain magical stuff either. The Cosmos is really enabling all of that stuff to turn on in probably March or April of 2020. And so I think Cosmos approximately has a twelve month lead on polka dot in this front. I suspect that the Cosmos approach is likely to garner more developer interest because of that just material lead time, and there are real network effects around these things.
00:17:05.090 - 00:17:14.200, Speaker B: So I'm expecting over the course of 2020, cosmos to take quite a bit of mind share from polka dot on this front. But I could be very wrong.
00:17:14.730 - 00:18:14.940, Speaker A: Yeah. One other, frankly advantage that I see is simply some of these feelings of bad blood. I think between Ethereum and Parity that came out on social media. Especially when we saw that Parity announced that the maintenance for a Parity Ethereum client was going to be managed by a Dow and they were not going to try to achieve the different milestones to get the remainder of the but anyway, it's just I only want to discuss all that. But what I do want to talk about know, I feel like through this whole period in the development of crypto, there's really only still two coins that have really, truly proven themselves and probably will likely not go anywhere for the foreseeable future. And those are obviously bitcoin and ethereum. Do you think that we're likely to see any new coins enter that stratum and where they've probably achieved something substantial and are unlikely to be dethroned anytime soon? And if so, which coins do you think we would see there?
00:18:15.790 - 00:18:52.662, Speaker B: Yeah. Is anybody answering this question? Part of the reason why there are so many people building layer ones is because those developers kind of realize that's the biggest opportunity. But I think there's lots of just much smaller markets that are not aiming to be non sovereign money that we're actually seeing quite a bit of meaningful progress on. So, for example, our weave has been live for I think it launched in June of 2018, so it's been live for about 18 months now. We actually announced our investment along with Union Square Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz, about a month, a month and a half ago. And that chain is growing substantially. There's very strong network effects there.
00:18:52.662 - 00:19:30.770, Speaker B: They're really the only people that are doing what they're doing. And at this point, while the market cap is not even close to Bitcoin or ETH, I don't think it's actually realistic to expect the market cap to be close to ETH. There's chains like Rweave that are still very much below the radar, but that they haven't found meaningful product market fit, and they're growing exponentially, I mean, 30% month over month, just very consistently. And so I think one of the storylines of 2020 is going to be lots of kind of success stories like Rweave. Another one of those that I kind of expect to emerge over the course of Two and 1020 is Live Peer. Live Peer has been around for about two years. It's been very below the radar.
00:19:30.770 - 00:20:10.398, Speaker B: People generally like the team, but they've intentionally not marketed themselves. V Two is rolling out right now. I think they're deploying the contracts like tomorrow or something. And I have very good reason to believe that there's going to be a lot of people transcoding video on the Reweave protocol over the next twelve months. Again, is that going to rival Ethereum? That's not a question, because the answer is no, because it just does something much more limited. But that doesn't mean that there can't be really strong success stories there. I think over the course of 2020, generally, you're going to kind of see a lot of mainstream coverage of the platform wars or whatever, but that's actually going to be a very slow, drawn out thing.
00:20:10.398 - 00:20:27.598, Speaker B: I think what you'll see that'll be actually a lot more interesting, at least in the short term, is like these success stories, things like Arweave, things like Helium, things like Livepeer that go live that do very specific things that solve very specific problems, and you'll just see consistent growth in those protocols.
00:20:27.774 - 00:20:34.310, Speaker A: So we've been discussing Ethereum a lot this episode, but I'm also curious to know what your view is on where Bitcoin is headed.
00:20:34.810 - 00:21:15.506, Speaker B: I mean, Bitcoin just doesn't really do anything. The whole point is that it just sits there and it doesn't really change. Yeah, look, it's simple, I guess it works light. If you go back and look at all the predictions from the Bitcoin people at the beginning of 2019, there were lots of people saying like, 2019 is going to be the year of lightning. That definitively did not happen. I think over the course of 2020, lightning will become usable at least for payments up to like, I don't know, $1,000 or something, maybe even to a few thousand dollars. I don't think lightning is going to be usable for large asset transfers but it'll be usable for small things.
00:21:15.506 - 00:21:44.800, Speaker B: I don't think that's actually going to matter. I don't think that it's going to impact the market in any meaningful way, at least over the time horizon of 2020. All the taproot graph root stuff, privacy stuff people have been talking about for bitcoin again, that really snore. All those things, like, they were supposed to launch in 2019. They obviously did not. My sense is those are kind of back half 2020, but they have low time preference. They don't really care about time, so those get slipped at 2021.
00:21:44.800 - 00:22:06.680, Speaker B: It's just a very slow ecosystem that doesn't evolve. I generally don't think lightning will be meaningfully used in 2020. I'd say 25% to probability that all of the kind of schnorr privacy stuff launches on bitcoin in 2020. They take their time.
00:22:07.530 - 00:22:45.890, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah. It's so interesting because I feel like I talk to one group of sources and they're all super excited about everything going on in bitcoin, and then I have another group of sources that are like, you for someone in my position, it's just like, okay, what am I supposed to think here? But what do you make of the fact that we have Square crypto kind of funding open source bitcoin development? And I think that's like a pretty novel situation to have a public company that's doing that. Does that get you excited at all? Or do you still feel like it's still going to be slow?
00:22:46.470 - 00:23:41.842, Speaker B: Right, so if you look at the largest open source projects in the world, things like Linux, things like Wikipedia, things like Chrome, like WebRTC, SSL, massive amounts of code in the world today are open source, and basically all of those open source repositories are managed and maintained by publicly traded companies. Google and Facebook and Microsoft and Apple. And those guys all contribute just incredible amounts of engineering dollars to upgrading those systems. So the standard par for Course is that big companies invest in open source protocols that's actually like par for Course. So I don't find it surprising that I don't find it particularly interesting that Square is doing this. There's like a very obvious potential synergy value for Square, right? And if bitcoin becomes a thing, then Square wants to be involved and kind of help shape the direction of the protocol. So the kind of selfish motivation is pretty clear.
00:23:41.842 - 00:24:30.820, Speaker B: The amount of resources Square is putting at this is pretty limited still. But hey, it's better than nothing. I generally don't think that it's terribly interesting that Square is doing anything here, just given the lack of scale of what they're doing. My kind of general frustration with the bitcoin stuff is that it's very hard for me to see how lightning actually fulfills its vision. In the sense that today, the money you can complain all you want about Visa or the US dollar or Fiat, Currencies, whatever, but I can send money from me to anywhere. And I'm not like, Encumbered in the sense that if I send dollars from me to one place, I can't send those dollars from me to another place. And the whole kind of structure of lightning is that basically all dollars are encumbered or all coins are encumbered, where it's like, look, I'm committing coins to this channel and if I commit coins to this channel, then I cannot commit coins to this other channel.
00:24:30.820 - 00:25:08.830, Speaker B: It just seems very difficult to me to see a future saying, well, look, the current world is one in which you have infinite flexibility in terms of where you send your money, and the future world is one in which you don't. I find that to be fundamentally not vision of the world that I find acceptable. Now the Lightning people are working on all kinds of channel routing solutions and reshuffling things and submarine swaps and I mean, there's all these things they're working on to try and mitigate that and maybe they can figure out ways to do that. But it just seems very stupid to me that we have a system in which dollars are not encumbered to move them around and we move to a system in which dollars are encumbered. I just find that to be fundamentally flawed.
00:25:09.250 - 00:25:16.340, Speaker A: All right, well, we will see how that plays out. So any quick predictions you want to make for 2020 before we close out?
00:25:17.030 - 00:25:39.480, Speaker B: I'd say 2020 is going to be the year where you have lots of small success stories, live peer, Arweave, helium, those types of things. There's going to be others, I think Tari like very focused applications, that the tooling is there, the protocols are mature and they can actually be used by real people for real world things and that will happen, and I'm really excited to see that.
00:25:39.850 - 00:25:43.378, Speaker A: All right, great. Well, thanks so much for being on Unconfirmed.
00:25:43.474 - 00:25:45.354, Speaker B: Hey, Laura, thanks so much for having me.

There's no news recap this week, folks. Sorry about that, because while crypto never takes a vacation, my sound engineer and I do. But don't worry, the news recap will be back next week and I'm sure there will be a lot to catch up on. Unconfirmed is produced by me, Laura Shin, with help from factual Corning, anthony Yoon, Daniel Ness, Josh Durham, and the team at CLK Transcription. Thanks for listening. It's.
