Here to discuss are Richard Chen, general partner at Crypto Venture Fund One Confirmation, and Frederick Haga, co founder and CEO at Dune Analytics.
00:01:51.194 - 00:01:52.970, Speaker B: Welcome, Richard and Frederick.
00:01:53.130 - 00:01:54.030, Speaker C: Great to be here.
00:01:54.100 - 00:01:55.620, Speaker A: Good to be here. Thanks.
00:01:56.470 - 00:02:56.022, Speaker B: When I first had the idea for this show, it was when crypto had kind of broadly been moving sideways for a while. And at least for Bitcoin, the on chain analytics actually showed clear movement from weak hands to strong hands or long term holders or hodlers, depending on your terminology. And I got curious about what on chain analytics were showing for ETH and related assets. However, since then, actually, ETH has been on an upswing. And to my mind, largely that's been driven by the adoption of EIP 1559, which had an effect on the monetary policy, which we will describe later in the show, and also driven by NFT activity. So at the time of this recording, which is Friday, August 13, the price of ETH is roughly $3,000, up from the low of $2,000 range a month ago. And that's somewhat remarkable because at the moment, the current language for crypto tax regulation in the US.
00:02:56.022 - 00:03:20.250, Speaker B: Does not bode well for developers in the think. You know, as we'll see in the show, the on chain analytics really maybe are kind of like divorced from all that activity. So, Richard and Frederick, why don't you each start with where you think the market is when it comes to ETH and why the price has risen this last month. And why don't we start with richard?
00:03:20.990 - 00:04:04.810, Speaker C: Yeah, so first I'll caveat by saying I'm not a trader, so I'm not making any short term price predictions, but I will say that a lot of people have undervalued 1559. There's just kind of a general lack of knowledge on how that affects the monetary policy of ETH versus compared to the bitcoin having, where people, I guess institutions and people outside of crypto generally knew what the having was and how that was going to affect bitcoin. So there's sort of like an information asymmetry that I've seen from talking to both institutions and even people in crypto, which I think explains part of the recent price action.
00:04:05.390 - 00:04:07.260, Speaker B: And Frederick. What about you?
00:04:07.790 - 00:04:36.998, Speaker A: Yeah, I think I pretty much agree. It seems like you still get kind of these ketchup type of effects on the information on some of these less accessible things going on, and suddenly everybody's all over it, and then you get these huge run ups because suddenly there's headlines everywhere about this new change. While most retail investors don't necessarily understand or see it coming, even though, in theory that information has been public for.
00:04:37.004 - 00:05:20.290, Speaker B: A long time, yeah, and probably the ethereum community, there's kind of like that hardcore group. But you're right, I think the institutions are the ones that really move the needle when it comes to price. Well, also, but all right, so before we get into the meat of the show, we want to just highlight for the listeners what it is about on chain metrics that make this space different from traditional finance. So, Richard and Frederick, can you explain why it is that you like to look at on chain metrics and how you view that as being different from traditional finance?
00:05:20.630 - 00:07:07.960, Speaker A: I think it's worth thinking about for just for a moment how traditional finance works and data and essentially what happens there is you have kind of real time data on trading of assets on exchanges, right. But beyond that, all the other stuff, the economic activity that goes on in companies and so forth, that's siloed in a company sits on their proprietary servers and systems and then sort of way later, like three months or four months or whatever after it happens, it goes into this PDF and a public company will disclose sort of their numbers and the actual financial activity that happened to them. And then sort of that is there's a whole industry on Wall Street and whatnot around sort of analyzing this and understanding what's going on. And there's like people paying or hedge funds, for instance, paying tons of money to get a slight information advantage by figuring out something from earth photos or whatever it might be. And then in the crypto world, you have these financial products that's obviously built on the blockchain, which is like a shared public backend for the world and anyone can look into it and this is like profound implications for just how information works around what's going on. So it's interesting because you essentially then can with something like doing or some other analytics tool. You can go in and analyze and dissect this data the way you want from the activity that happens and you have then kind of financial products and that actual financial activity that would usually go in like a PDF three months later is occurring right there and then there's actual revenues or financial value being moved around.
00:07:07.960 - 00:08:22.460, Speaker A: And that means that you could directly, publicly understand what's happening in this financial system which is just absolutely radically different from the existing world and super duper exciting and I think still very much underutilized and under appreciated by a lot of folks. And I think you can even think of it as the public in crypto has for free access to better data tools about what's going on in these systems than probably any bank CEO or regulator in the traditional world. If you're the CEO of a big bank, what assets do you hold and what's the exposure and all that. And you probably have a pretty good dashboard for that. But it's highly likely that it's actually not as good and as comprehensive as what you can find on chain metrics because anyone in the role can go and analyze this live. So I think that's incredibly exciting and one of these second order effects of crypto that's still kind of not quite proliferated into the market and world yet, but it's super interesting.
00:08:23.230 - 00:09:19.818, Speaker C: And I also want to add the people who recognize this the most are actually the founders, like the d five founders who came from the traditional finance world and saw both worlds. So a good example is Hugh Carp from nexus mutual, where before he started nexus, for 15 years he was a CFO of Munich large insurance company. And then whenever he shows nexus's KPIs and dashboards to his friends in the traditional world, they're all blown away because those people can never find a dashboard for their traditional insurer about KPIs such as active premiums in force like price to book all these fundamental KPIs which are just hidden in quarterly PDFs. Whereas because nexus mutual is on chain, on ethereum, you can get all that data in real time and it just amazes them how much transparency there is for DeFi.
00:09:19.994 - 00:10:22.290, Speaker B: Yeah, and one other thing I would add to it is it's not even just the on chain metrics, but even just being able to see how the community is talking in the forums because normally for a company or whatever, the decision makers, whatever their thoughts are, would be hidden. They wouldn't be something that would be just available to any random shareholder. But in a crypto community you can kind of see what is a community saying, where is sentiment going? Like that kind of thing. And so that also is another difference. All right, so let's dive now into these metrics. Even though the topic is kind of like ETH broadly, which is composed of few different topics, I really want to start with NFTs because that's where the action is nowadays. And when I was doing research for this episode, my mind was just kind of blown, because if you've been listening to my show, I haven't really done much on NFTs except for Axie Infinity, and so I was just like, Whoa.
00:10:22.290 - 00:10:31.590, Speaker B: But anyway. All right, so what are the notable aspects you're seeing in the NFT market right now, especially when it comes to on chain metrics?
00:10:32.010 - 00:11:20.086, Speaker C: Well, first, OpenSea, their KPIs have completely exploded in monthly volume. I saw the other day that there's, like, only 30 something companies in the world that have over a billion in GMV, and Openc is on pace to be one of those. And the company has only been around for about three years. So I guess a lot of the volume growth has been driven by PFPs, which are these avatar projects that people like to trade and speculate on and also use as their avatars. And OpenSea is benefiting from just being the marketplace for search and discovery for these avatars. So that's been one of the big trends in NFTs in the last few weeks.
00:11:20.188 - 00:11:21.510, Speaker B: What is a PSP.
00:11:23.290 - 00:11:24.626, Speaker C: Profile picture?
00:11:24.818 - 00:12:04.100, Speaker A: Okay, I think what crazy to see with the Openc volume is how it shot up to, I guess, around 100 million in trading volume a month earlier this year. And it felt like that was really an explosive moment, and then came a little bit down in April or something, and then now it's like, 700 million so far in August. So it's insane when you see some of these hockey sticks sort of play out where you think that, oh, that was, like, at the peak, and then that just absolutely dwarfed a couple of months later.
00:12:05.030 - 00:12:09.970, Speaker B: Wow. Wait, it's already 700 billion for August million?
00:12:10.120 - 00:12:15.878, Speaker C: Yes. 765,000,000, which it's only been about half the month so far.
00:12:15.964 - 00:12:24.490, Speaker B: That's crazy because the volume in July was 325,000,000. Okay.
00:12:24.640 - 00:12:29.210, Speaker C: It's already more than doubled July, and it's only been less than half of the month.
00:12:29.360 - 00:12:29.722, Speaker A: Okay.
00:12:29.776 - 00:12:42.706, Speaker B: Wow. Yeah. And I did also see a glass node report that said that 63,000 addresses interacted with Openc in July, but that in the first three days of August alone, already 28,000 addresses had interacted with.
00:12:42.728 - 00:12:50.318, Speaker C: Openc, and now it's up to 92,000 with the first half of August.
00:12:50.494 - 00:12:51.250, Speaker B: Wow. Okay.
00:12:51.320 - 00:13:00.166, Speaker C: So all of their KPIs have dwarfed all of August. KPIs have dwarfed Julies, and it's not been the end of the month yet.
00:13:00.188 - 00:13:06.162, Speaker B: Yeah, we're not even halfway through. And just also, in case people don't know, KPI stands for Key Performance Indicator.
00:13:06.306 - 00:13:11.260, Speaker A: You can see it in Richard's Public It's All Out.
00:13:14.190 - 00:13:30.030, Speaker B: Which we'll put that in the show notes. So when you see all that, do you get a sense of what is driving this interest in NFTs? Or who's getting into the space, or why it's growing so exponentially.
00:13:31.170 - 00:13:31.678, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:13:31.764 - 00:14:28.580, Speaker C: I have this mental model that DeFi is crypto for elites, and NFTs is like crypto for normies. And the reason I say that is, for DeFi, there's just kind of a higher barrier to entry. One, gas fees price out a lot of people, and two, there's a lot of financial vocabulary you need to know. You need to know what derivatives are, what's a perpetual swap, how options work. There's a lot of trading terminology, which is why a lot of the DeFi activity has been driven by whales and traders and more sophisticated people. Whereas NFTs, when I explained NFTs to my parents, they understood it immediately, just because it's something very relatable to most everyday people, because you're just buying culture and investing in athletes, art, music, entertainment. And that's just something that retail people understand better.
00:14:28.580 - 00:14:38.910, Speaker C: Which is why, if you look at kind of mainstream media coverage, you saw NFTs cross the chasm to mainstream attention much faster than DeFi.
00:14:38.990 - 00:14:47.640, Speaker B: And can you tell us how it was that you explained NFTs to your parents? Because yeah, I'm just curious to hear how you would explain it to a non crypto person.
00:14:48.830 - 00:15:10.682, Speaker C: Yeah, I think the best analogy is, like, collectibles, like things like sports cards, Beanie Babies, like this, assets that you find have sentimental value with too, and it could also have monetary value, except rather than kind of like a physical asset, it's just a digital file on the blockchain.
00:15:10.826 - 00:16:27.542, Speaker A: And I'd say also conceptually, I think it's pretty easy for most people to get to the conclusion that a lot of art is just sort of scarcity and a claim on something that's scarce that would matter, not sort of per se the physical object or whatever. And I think there's this interesting analogy where it's like, if you perfectly manage to recreate DA Vinci painting down to the Atom, would you want the original that's done by DA Vinci, or do you want the perfect replica, which is the exact same physical thing? Obviously, you want the original, but there's nothing physical that's separating those two. Right. And I feel like that's even though you can send a JPEG file wherever to whoever, the scarcity in art is not about distribution and production. First and foremost, it's about authenticity and knowing that you have something that others can't have. And I think that's why NFTs are actually not that hard to grasp, because it's kind of hard to dispute the claims I just made, I think. Yeah.
00:16:27.596 - 00:17:12.920, Speaker B: And I think also, when you have that kind of emotional response to something, then for whoever that person is that has that response, it could be what to them is like a priceless object. And so, in a way, that means that the prices of these might seem outrageous to other people, but to that person, it's worth it. And that's really all that matters. So, as we were talking about. These OpenSea metrics really show that it's ramping up very quickly. And I just wondered, do you think that this level of interest is sustainable or do you think that we're kind of in the beginning of a bubble or maybe at the peak of a bubble? I don't know what's your sense of where this market activity is going?
00:17:14.010 - 00:17:52.702, Speaker C: Well, the last time Opensea's KPIs went kind of hockey stick was in March, and then people thought that it was bubble and then it went down for a little bit, but it was like the shortest bubble ever and two months later then it's reached new all time highs. So I think this is like a huge new market that's uniquely enabled and OpenSea has the upside to be the next ebay, or even have a higher market cap than ebay, just like how Coinbase has a higher market cap than traditional brokerages. So I think there's still a lot of upside potential for NFTs and OpenSea broadly.
00:17:52.846 - 00:18:47.060, Speaker A: I'll take a little bit of a counterposition and say that I think that on the long time horizon, I think what Richard is saying makes sense and is indeed true. But I do get some sort of of the same feelings as like 2017 ICOs, where it's like there's a lot of opportunistic folks hopping on right now and it seems like there's some relatively low effort projects that sort of end up turning into money for people that might not be around for the long term. But anyway, I also think that there's some really proper long term stuff being created and eventually I think these metrics will be dwarfed again. But my sense is that the current sort of hype will probably sort of cool off a little bit for some time as well.
00:18:47.430 - 00:19:07.498, Speaker C: Yeah, generally the volume graphs, it goes up and then goes down a little bit, but each new all time high dwarfs like the previous all time high. So it's not like a perfectly up into the right hockey stick graph, but it kind of has many bubbles where the long term cycle is still up into the right.
00:19:07.584 - 00:20:06.290, Speaker B: Yeah. And what I would say here is that there's probably a difference between a bubble for OpenSea, meaning that the market for OpenSea could continue to grow and grow and grow. But for individual NFT drops, it might be that the prices for those are inflated, whereas the total addressable market for NFTs maybe probably. We've barely scratched the surface for it yet. But I actually did then want to ask you about that for the individual NFTs. Can you talk a little bit about what you believe it is that makes these NFTs? Or do you believe that these NFTs will keep their value over time? Or do you think that right now what's happening is that the prices are popping now, but that over the long term they'll kind of deflate? Do you feel like this is sort of a situation where people are like a gold rush and they're just kind of trying to flip these NFTs, I'd.
00:20:06.310 - 00:20:50.186, Speaker C: Say 99% of NFTs won't keep their value long term. I think it's going to consolidate into a winner take all market. And that's generally true of the traditional world where LeBron James cards are worth orders of magnitude more than some random NBA player or a painting by Picasso is worth more than some random artist. The blue chip NFTs I'd say right now are like one of one crypto art on super rare by artists like X, Copy, Palk, Hakatao and others. And then for collectibles, I think the big three are CryptoPunks me bits and board apes and the long tail of collectibles. What I've seen is mostly traders and flipping right now.
00:20:50.368 - 00:20:52.720, Speaker B: Yeah. What do you think of this ether rock thing?
00:20:54.050 - 00:20:55.262, Speaker C: I haven't heard of that one.
00:20:55.316 - 00:20:59.790, Speaker B: Oh, the rocks that they're just different shades but they're all the same rock.
00:21:00.850 - 00:21:16.530, Speaker C: Yeah, there's a bunch of these Avatars projects. There's like addition of 10,000. Each has like different attributes and then people pay like 2000 guay to mint them when it drops. Very 2017.
00:21:17.110 - 00:21:27.640, Speaker B: But actually the ether rock thing was from 2017 and then people recently rediscovered the Smart contract and then they finished out minting the rest of the rocks. That's what happened.
00:21:30.730 - 00:22:40.590, Speaker A: I think, in terms of the value maintaining. And I think Richard is correct in the sense that a lot of artists you get this winter takes all as in a lot of culture. But I think that's also an aspect of this like 1002 true fans thing that if you have 1000 fans on the internet, you can probably make a living of what you do because if you get $10 from each, then suddenly it matters. And I think that could be the case for a lot of the creators that are not necessarily huge or going to be huge for the next Drake or whatever, but they could still now actually issue something. If they have a fan base of thousand fans, they could actually sell something scarce to them and have them as part of their community and actually make money of it. And I think that's pretty exciting and just the fact that any creator can issue some authentic work. Like previously in music, typically you kind of have to do merch or you have to do concerts, right? Because that's the only thing that actually scarce.
00:22:40.590 - 00:23:06.790, Speaker A: But now that you can say like you have this gold version of a song or whatever it might be, you can actually financially tap into your audience globally without having to sort of do the physical thing. And I think that makes a lot of sense and to a large extent a lot of merch and whatnot is just a proxy for scarce thing that the artist created.
00:23:08.090 - 00:23:54.214, Speaker C: And that's especially true for video artists, visual artists. Whereas before the primary revenue stream for visual artists was commissions, they would do an ad for a Fortune 500 company, kind of do the visuals for that. And that's how they made a living because these digital artists don't sell paintings or physical works of art. But now with NFTs, they can actually sell basically the digital equivalent of paintings. And that's a more one to one translation of value, their creative activity and how much value they're getting out of it, rather than having to rely on commissions or some of these other proxies for making a living. So that's huge for these artists just to have a new business model for them.
00:23:54.412 - 00:25:09.806, Speaker B: Yeah. So what we were saying earlier about how 99% of these may not retain their value in a way that's just for the consumer or the investor or whatever you want to call them, but when it comes to the creator, actually they're gaining a lot more value than they would through traditional routes. So as a creator myself, I would kind of applaud that. So now let's kind of talk about how this activity is affecting the different blockchains. Richard, I did see your partner Nick Tomano tweet, quote, NBA TOPSHOTS $350,000,000 plus in venture funding is an awesome product, but there's now six NFT projects with roughly zero in venture funding doing consistently more volume. Why Ethereum? And then I saw that Fred Wilson of Union Square Ventures and Roham Garrett Gozleu of jepper Labs, which created NBA TOPSHOT, kind of got into a little tweet discussion with him about it. And Fred said, oh, it's because it's not NBA season and Flow has new offerings in store.
00:25:09.806 - 00:25:36.950, Speaker B: And Roham said, quote, none of us would be talking about NFTs if TOPSHOT was on Ethereum. It would have failed out of the gate with impossibly poor UX. So when you look at these metrics, I was curious, what do you think is the future of these different blockchains that support? Like, do you guys think that Ethereum will continue to remain in the lead or do you think other chains will take market share or maybe even overtake Ethereum?
00:25:37.610 - 00:26:18.434, Speaker C: I think at the end of the day, it comes down to scalability and how much gas prices out retail users. So I see Ethereum as great for high dollar value, low throughput use cases. So like one of one crypto art where you're going to spend five, six figures on a piece of art, it doesn't matter if you're paying $20 to bid on the artwork because you end up paying way more. But for these in game assets and these maybe like $510 NFTs, then it makes more sense to be on a scalable blockchain. And we've actually seen a big explosion of usage on Polygon, which is an Ethereum side chain. So OpenSea recently. A few months ago, they deployed their contracts to Polygon.
00:26:18.434 - 00:26:59.860, Speaker C: So now creatives can create mint new NFTs on polygon. And the gas fees, there are maybe like one $0.02. So it's negligible. So there's actually a game called Zedrun on Polygon that's been taking off and it's like these horses that you race and they've been driving a lot of the NFT activity and volume on Polygon. So overall I'd say there's definitely room for other chains that enable scalability and new use cases of NFTs. And I think Polygon is one. Axio Infinity has their own layer two called Ronin and there's also Flow, but those tend to be the big chains I can think of.
00:27:01.030 - 00:28:03.666, Speaker A: I think there's a lot of the same problems as with other Ethereum alternatives in the sense, like, for instance, you would need funds to buy this stuff. Like if you want to buy an NFT on Ethereum, there's a high likelihood that you actually have some ETH or stable coins in the wallet that you could use to fund that. And then in this other world of a new chain, then it's kind of hard to get started. But also, I guess some of these are kind of taking a different route and trying to reach audiences that don't currently have an Ethereum wallet and that could make a lot of sense. So I think it's still very early. I'm very excited to see sort of what the metrics look like by the end of this year on these new layer twos on Ethereum and see what the usage actually looked like. It's still very preliminary and kind of hard to understand exactly how much usage they're actually getting and see that across all the different systems.
00:28:03.666 - 00:28:13.980, Speaker A: That's also something we're working on at Dune to see just like stack up against each other all the layer twos and the different layer ones and see where the activity is actually moving to.
00:28:14.830 - 00:28:56.520, Speaker B: Okay, yeah, I do have some questions about layer twos, but we'll kind of COVID that a little bit later in the show. I actually did want to ask one other thing about kind of like NFTs from the buyer perspective. I did notice that in the last 30 days, NFT secondary sales have doubled. It was about 15,000 a month ago. It's more than 30,000 as of Wednesday. What do you think accounts for that? And maybe it's just the fact that there's more NFTs, but do you see that secondary sales will continue to be a big part of the NFT activity on an ongoing basis? Or do you think it's just now because we may be in this kind of hype cycle and people are sort of like flipping them?
00:28:58.010 - 00:29:52.810, Speaker C: I think secondary sales are healthy and this is really pronounced in crypto art. So August is actually the first month that secondary sales eclipse primary sales for Super Rare, which is the largest crypto art marketplace. And I think the reason is because the OG artists like X, Copy, Coldy, Hackathow and others, their floor prices all rose dramatically. So the NFT community is kind of coming to consensus that these are the OG, one of one crypto art that are going to be good source of value, and that's why there's been a lot of big secondary sales. If a platform doesn't have a lot of secondary sales, then it's mostly just like artists doing drops. But those NFTs don't have much value if they're not being resold at significant markups because people don't think of them as OG artworks.
00:29:53.950 - 00:30:37.946, Speaker B: Okay, yeah. So I guess we'll sort of have to see over time how this plays out for some of the other names that aren't the OGS. All right, so in a moment, we're going to now switch topics and touch on DeFi, which I know a lot of people are interested in. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible.

00:32:41.374 - 00:32:47.710, Speaker B: But over the last month, it's actually risen. Steadily. So what's your take on what's happening now with DeFi?
00:32:48.470 - 00:33:40.718, Speaker A: I think it's kind of established itself as a pretty solid position, if you will. If you look at, for instance, Dex trading volumes that absolutely exploded, like over essentially in the last year started from and then it peaked in May. But now we see. So essentially in May it was $170,000,000,000 traded on decentralized exchanges and essentially all the months before May and now after May were at around $80 billion. So even though it's sort of down from that peak, it's still like a very substantial amount to just put it in perspective. If you look at the May numbers cherry picking a little bit, but in 2019 it was 250,000,000. In 2020 it was 1 billion.
00:33:40.718 - 00:34:34.994, Speaker A: So up four x. And then now in 2021, it was 170,000,000,000, which is like up 170 X over the last year. Right. So you've had this absolutely undeniable rise in these metrics where all of this went from a promising toy to actually showing volumes that uniswap was over coinbase on certain days. And essentially it's managed to establish itself on that position where this is something that's been very actively used. And the trading volumes are significant on all months and all days despite fluctuations. And that's frankly also what happens in traditional financial markets when there's price volatility, the volumes go up and that the same thing is playing out in the deck space.
00:34:34.994 - 00:35:06.014, Speaker A: To me, that only sort of tells us that this is actually sort of being used as any other financial markets. Right. Which is pretty amazing. It's really only two years since it was just like this tiny thing with a few hundred million dollars in trading volume, and now it's undeniably here. And that's, I think that's at least really telling of sort of the DeFi space, even though it's still up and down.
00:35:06.212 - 00:35:07.920, Speaker B: Richard, do you want to add anything?
00:35:08.290 - 00:35:23.300, Speaker C: Yeah, I think DeFi activity largely just follows price action. So when there was a lot of trading activity, when prices were high in April and May, and then it's pretty correlated with that.
00:35:25.590 - 00:36:14.126, Speaker A: I think outstanding loans now are like around 21 billion, and that's up about three X over the last year. So a year ago it was around $7 billion. So it's like significant decrease, but kind of less exponential than the Dex side, but it keeps growing and kind of same with stable coins. I think the Issuance now is around 80 billion in stable coins on ethereum. And it's like consistently think around 100 billion a day that's being transferred. Let me double check that I'm saying this correctly, sorry. It's about 20 billion in daily trading transfer volume of stable coins.
00:36:14.126 - 00:36:23.446, Speaker A: So I'd say sort of all of these things are going up and to the right, even though at various pace. Yeah.
00:36:23.548 - 00:36:38.940, Speaker B: One other thing that I want to ask about was so, Richard, I know that your Dune analytics board has this dashboard, I guess, for number of DeFi users, but I have to quibble with the phrasing there because is it really users? It's like wallets, right?
00:36:39.550 - 00:36:45.758, Speaker C: Yeah. Unique addresses. Yeah, which I have a disclaimer at the top of the dashboard because that's always the first.
00:36:45.924 - 00:36:49.438, Speaker A: You can never post these stats without getting that one right.
00:36:49.604 - 00:36:53.546, Speaker C: But why don't you just get like, Twitter mentions?
00:36:53.578 - 00:36:55.950, Speaker B: Because why don't you just make the language more accurate?
00:36:56.610 - 00:37:01.934, Speaker C: Just say unique address. It's already named, like DeFi use, I guess, the link for the dashboard.
00:37:01.982 - 00:37:06.600, Speaker B: But can't you change the title anyway, even though the link, the URL is the old link?
00:37:07.610 - 00:37:10.898, Speaker C: Yeah, I have the disclaimer already in the title.
00:37:10.994 - 00:37:35.920, Speaker B: Okay, well, yeah, I would actually just change the language, but you do whatever you want. But I did wonder, so I don't know what we can glean from that. But do you actually think that the number of users has increased, or do you think it's just the same kind of core group of people that are kind of being good with their OpSec and using different wallets or what's going on there?
00:37:37.490 - 00:38:05.142, Speaker C: Number of users has definitely increased. You can discount it by maybe like a factor of five or however, what you think the average number of wallets that a user uses. I think mainly because during DeFi summer when you had yield farming, all these crazy interest rates, that brought a lot of new people into DeFi, that was responsible for the first part of the exponential growth. So the number of users in DFI has still increased significantly over the last year.
00:38:05.276 - 00:38:11.740, Speaker B: And right now, would you say that the DFI space is still attracting new users? And if so, what's bringing them in?
00:38:12.350 - 00:38:38.740, Speaker C: I think yield is a big thing just because we're in a zero interest rate environment. And when you can earn like 10% to 15% APYs on stablecoins in DFI right now, that's just attractive to a lot of people. So I know of friends personally outside of crypto who have started to move money into crypto to earn those yields. I expect that trend to continue over time.
00:38:39.110 - 00:39:24.240, Speaker A: In one inch's June dashboard, they track how many addresses that they have as users that are new or old. So they have basically the second most users after uniswap. So uniswap is at like around 130,000 addresses per week, and I think one inch does about 30,000. And looking at their stats, they have about 40% are existing and 60% are actually new. So whether that means that people getting new addresses or it's actually new users, of course you can never exactly know it's, at least not just the same addresses interacting all the time.
00:39:24.690 - 00:39:39.800, Speaker B: Okay, so, yeah, it's hard to conclude. Well, one other thing that I wanted to ask about, so we did talk about DEXes and Frederick, you did make a few comments about lending, but I did want to ask, are there any other trends that you are seeing there.
00:39:40.250 - 00:41:05.390, Speaker A: Lending is interesting because in one way it moves a little bit slower because you need to have collateral and you need to be more careful with risks and volatility than in sort of the trading space. Right? So I think that in that sense it's like fewer assets and can just not same extent sort of shift around super quickly. One thing that I can mention that was pretty cool, I mentioned how this open data enables new cases and one thing Maker has been doing recently is like building a union dashboard with their actual financial statements like you kind of would see for a bank. So they have a balance sheet, they have profit and loss and you can see this live from the blockchain. And one interesting thing you can see is that in May they did like 30 million in revenues and I think 20 ish of that was lending income and then 10 million on top of that was liquidation income and then it went back to just being lending income and not that much liquidations. So that's like a fascinating thing. You can now actually see in the data how these systems revenues in addition to kind of their exposure and risks actually are affected by events.
00:41:05.810 - 00:41:38.860, Speaker B: All right, yeah, this is clearly as you were talking about earlier, something that's new and different. So then, now just a general question. So obviously we started discussing NFTs because that's at the moment where all this activity is. But I did think last year that oh, maybe DeFi will be one of the drivers of the next bull market. But at the moment I'm kind of like oh, maybe it's going to be NFTs. So what's your sense of where DeFi is headed for the rest of the year and what role it will play in this bull market?
00:41:39.470 - 00:42:35.470, Speaker C: I think the next thing in DeFi is derivatives because I think a lot of the spot markets and fundamental building blocks in DeFi have already been laid down. So you have lending and borrowing like Compound Aave, you have spot markets like Uniswap. But there are still spaces and derivatives in DeFi are still wide open. For example, options is still a wide open problem and no project to date in DeFi has captured significant market share in options just because it's a very hard problem to solve. And you can't map traditional finance options like how those are designed one to one on DeFi. So we just invested in a project called Primitive which is launching in a few months and they're going to be like the uniswap of options in terms of creating a very zero to one AMM in terms of how these are priced. Outside of options.
00:42:35.470 - 00:43:24.334, Speaker C: There's also structured products, just ways to make it easier for a retail to earn yield or get exposure to an ETF like product. So one very successful structured product is the DeFi Pulse Index. It's basically like one token where you own a basket of blue chip DFI coins like Comp, Uni, Ave, MKR and others. And then you can also have structured products like leverage products. So like two X Bitcoin and two X ETH products where you don't have to go on compound and manage your margin accounts. You can also have inverse tokens. So if you look at all the top most widely traded products in traditional finance on Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange, a lot of them are structured products like QQQ Spy and others.
00:43:24.334 - 00:43:28.510, Speaker C: And I think that space is going to continue to grow in DeFi.
00:43:29.570 - 00:44:46.920, Speaker A: I very much agree on the index products, for instance, I think is super exciting and it's a way for people that are less immersed in the space to get exposure to what's going on. You maybe have some bitcoin, you maybe have some ETH, but then getting on to the crazy world of all of these various tokens and coins can be really hard. And then if you can just take exposure to then it's kind of the same dynamic that most people have with the stock market, right, where they don't necessarily care about stock picking or what they want to invest in, they just want to sort of have exposure to the whole thing. And that is really cool to have that for the token economy as well. Like you mentioned, like DeFi pool Syndex, they've been growing really nicely and they also, for instance, have really cool charts on incentivized versus uninsentivized supply of users. So they track and you can see the share of uninsentivized supply really taking over over time. So they started out with like 90% incentivized where people get tokens to be part of the system, right? And then eventually it turns into all organic, which is really cool to see.
00:44:46.920 - 00:44:47.734, Speaker A: All right.
00:44:47.772 - 00:45:29.686, Speaker B: So one thing I want to ask about this is maybe less about on chain metrics and just sort of where all this is headed, but I did see this tweet by Chow Wang, formerly of Masari, and he said the final form of the most interesting crypto apps will be those lying at the intersection of finance, gaming, social networking, and community engagement. There will no longer be any dichotomy between these verticals. Every app will be nothing and everything at once. I wondered what you thought of that statement and if you even could think of any examples. It sounds super interesting to me, but I was like, what does that even look like? And I didn't even know if it was just something that sounded cool or if other people thought there was something to it.
00:45:29.868 - 00:45:48.490, Speaker C: I think it sounds very buzwordy and something that could get a lot of retweets, but I can't really think of an app. Or maybe it's just way too early to think of new use cases enabled by all of these different trends and lie at the intersection of all these trends.
00:45:48.910 - 00:47:02.930, Speaker A: Project, what's your take I guess I kind of agree. But I think that there's definitely something very deep to the fact that you can sort of program scarcity and value into sort of any type of application. And obviously, I guess, furthermore, there's been this metaverse word that suddenly is everywhere because Zuckerberg mentioned it and whatnot. And I think it seems likely that sort of NFTs will play a role in a more Internet kind of native world and ownership around that. And then obviously the tradability of these things are kind of inherent in what's happening on the blockchain. So I think sort of, yes, there's a high probability that some of this stuff will sort of meet in ways that it couldn't and wouldn't previously. But I guess also you need to build a nice experience for users and do something novel that people actually care about and that's kind of not trivial and it can take a long time and I don't think it's going to change everything overnight.
00:47:04.230 - 00:47:55.122, Speaker B: Yeah, the only example that I could think of that sort of seemed to be a description, or to be an example of this description was Axio Infinity. Obviously, at its core, it's a game. But then, because the axes are scarce now, there are these teams that are loading out their axes for people that want to get in. And so in that regard, that is these elements of social networking and community engagement, I guess Axie Infinity maybe is still missing the finance piece, although I guess you could say, like play to earn or just the fact that you earn money from it is financed. So I don't know. Anyway, that was like the only example I could think of. All right, so now let's talk about Ethereum, because that's kind of where most of this activity is happening.
00:47:55.122 - 00:48:40.530, Speaker B: And obviously we did talk about how EIP One five nine was this big change that happened on Ethereum. And so for people who may have missed the episodes I did on EIP 1559 and on ETH as ultrasound money. So essentially now with this London Hard fork upgrade, the transaction fees are now broken out into base fees for transactions which end up getting burned, and then priority fees, which are tips that go to the miners. So in this first week after the London Hard fork, $100 million worth of ETH was burned, and Glass Node reports that's about 35% of the Issuance. So I'm curious to hear, Richard and Frederick, what were your expectations with this upgrade and how has the reality compared?
00:48:41.110 - 00:49:35.250, Speaker C: Yeah, 1559 solves the big problem. The big question that people always ask is how does ETH capture value? And now with 1559, ETH directly captures value from all the economic activity that are happening on chain. So you can actually now apply real world traditional finance valuation models to Ethereum based on fees and how much transaction volume economic activity is happening. I actually just created a dune dashboard yesterday looking at our portfolio companies and how much they contribute to ETH being burned. It's interesting that OpenSeas is leading by far they've burned over 4600 ETH since 1559 launched, which is about 13 million, I think, $14 in dollars. So Openc is like, one of the largest sources of revenue for Ethereum.
00:49:35.910 - 00:50:34.680, Speaker A: Yeah, it's been really cool to see it play out. And I think also it's kind of an important data point in the evolution of Ethereum in general. It's only so often that there's actually a hard fork, and throughout that, these relatively radical changes can be done. I guess a lot of Bitcoin folks will think that this is a really bad thing. But sort of given the trajectory and sort of social contract where this project is headed, I think it's encouraging to see that something like this can actually be figured out in an open way and decided upon, even though it's kind of controversial and then actually implemented pretty smoothly. So that's also, I think, a big takeaway, and maybe also a lot of why the price action beyond, of course, the new sort of issuance, but the fact that this project can actually coordinate and upgrade itself over time.
00:50:35.690 - 00:51:13.570, Speaker B: Yeah, one thing I will say is about how OpenSea is the top burner of ETH since the upgrade. I was looking at the times when the net issuance on Ethereum turned negative in this past week, and it was basically during. And, um, you know, it's funny because in one of the episodes I recorded, I hadn't even heard of one of the NFT. Well, actually so for the research for this episode, I actually hadn't heard of any of these until having to do research for these episodes. One was called COVID Punks. The other was Art blocks. The last one was Fluff World NFTs, and they're like digital rabbits.
00:51:13.570 - 00:52:13.160, Speaker B: But the point is that it's so similar to the ICO craze, when during the ICOs, the usage on the blockchain would be so congested that all these transactions were failing. And even if you had some other transaction that you were trying to do that was not even related to the ICO, it wouldn't go through. And during that time, it was just that ethereum wasn't really usable. But here it is now. I'm not sure how it's affecting usage, but regardless, the demand for ETH at that moment for usage of the space on these Ethereum blocks is helping then add value to ETH by making the net issuance negative. At least. I agree that EIP 1559 is like a change that should be beneficial to the Ethereum price in that regard.
00:52:13.160 - 00:53:09.100, Speaker B: So one other thing I want to ask about was oftentimes with bitcoin when looking at on chain metrics, you can kind of see when bitcoin is moving to offline cold wallets, and this is often a proxy for institutions or whales that are buying Bitcoin, basically. And the block's. Frank Chaparro recently reported that institutions are demanding ETH, and it's actually causing firms like Nidig and Fidelity to expand into ETH. And as we know, in Coinbase's second quarter, ETH trading volumes did top Bitcoin volumes for the first time. So Frank reported that his sources were saying that the reason these institutions are having to expand into ETH or wanting to expand into ETH is that they're looking for yield. So I wondered, does on chain activity show that ETH is moving to offline cold wallets or what are you seeing in that regard?
00:53:09.870 - 00:53:47.426, Speaker C: I'm not sure about the offline cold wallets, but one metric that we track internally at one confirmation is number of unique addresses that hold more than, like, zero that hold more than one ETH. So it's kind of a proxy for how many users believe in ETH as a digital currency and are holding. That metric has been going up and to the right over the past year. So more so than bitcoin, the growth rate is much more pronounced than Bitcoin. So that does support the narrative that there's more people, whether or not it's institutions or retail, that are buying ETH.
00:53:47.618 - 00:53:58.374, Speaker B: Okay, yeah, I guess the one thing is, obviously ETH is so much cheaper than bitcoin. So the fact that it slowed down for Bitcoin but not ETH, so for.
00:53:58.412 - 00:54:06.086, Speaker C: Bitcoin, we actually tracked 0.1. So the dollar value is still roughly oh, wow. You can't compare one ETH to one Bitcoin.
00:54:06.118 - 00:54:13.098, Speaker B: Right, okay. So even when you make that comparison, then the accumulation of ETH is still yeah.
00:54:13.184 - 00:54:19.946, Speaker C: If you take roughly the same dollar value of ETH and Bitcoin, the accumulation of ETH is growing at a faster pace than bitcoin.
00:54:19.978 - 00:54:21.694, Speaker B: Oh, wow. Oh, interesting.
00:54:21.812 - 00:55:15.486, Speaker A: And I guess also in one way, there's a difference there where the best thing for Bitcoin is kind of if just the supply disappears, right. And no one sort of touches their Bitcoin, if you will, and then that's just like their scarcity, but kind of ethereum also want to be used. It's a computer, right, that has a bunch of applications that people it's a good thing if they use it in one way. Of course it's good if people sort of invest and believe in the currency, but if we didn't have all of this on chain activity that we've been talking about now for the last hour, that would be really bad. Right. You want addresses to engage and use these protocols and spend their ETH on gas and be engaged with the system as well. And I think that's just as important as how many are holding it.
00:55:15.486 - 00:55:24.900, Speaker A: And I think I guess sort of those data points together is what really tells you if there's interesting stuff going on with it.
00:55:25.830 - 00:56:06.458, Speaker B: Right. Because then ETH, at least for two of the three characteristics of money, it's displaying those characteristics. One would be as a store of value, and the other is as a medium of exchange. All right, now we're running out of time. So let's touch on layer twos, which came up earlier. What are you seeing in terms of the layer two race? I did happen to look at a website called L2 Beat and the top two projects by Value Locked are dYdX and Loop Ring, both of which use ZK roll up technology. Fourth is Optimism, which uses optimistic roll ups.
00:56:06.458 - 00:56:17.880, Speaker B: After that, the Value Locked was kind of a steep drop. So I just was curious, what are you guys seeing in terms of metrics when it comes to layer twos? Where do you think that competition is going?
00:56:18.730 - 00:57:09.510, Speaker C: Yeah, optimistic roll ups are just around the corner right now. Both Arbitrum and Optimism have kind of private, quote unquote, soft launches so developers can move their DApps over, although there's still trading limits just to work out the bugs so it hasn't gotten its full user activity. Once those launch, then there's going to be a lot of activity on layer two, a lot of volume as well as a lot of money that's moving between layer one and layer two. And there's actually a project called Hop Exchange that's creating a nice UX bridge between layer one and layer two and between layer two and layer two in a noncustodial way because kind of the current solutions are all relying on multi sigs, but those are pretty insecure.
00:57:10.170 - 00:57:56.638, Speaker A: Yeah. So for Optimism, for instance, the number of transactions has been trending upwards. It's currently like 30,000 a day. But I guess that's still not that much. Actually. It seems like it's still even though these things are kind of live, it's still too early to judge if they're actually getting adoption or they need to actually fully release it. And then you need to look at the metrics and see are people actually embracing this? And I think that's going to be one of the key questions for the rest of this year, to understand what that activity actually looks like on the chain and not just like these concepts of how we can scale this.
00:57:56.638 - 00:58:04.358, Speaker A: But obviously Loop Ring has been around for a long time and is doing really well as far as I can see.
00:58:04.524 - 00:58:50.466, Speaker B: Yeah, and I did also see Zero X. Labs reported that although the because Zero X is on Polygon, in addition on Ethereum, and it said that the polygon transaction count exceeds the one on Ethereum, but it said the average trade size on Polygon is about $750. Well, sorry, this was back in July, so this may be old data. So the average trade size on Polygon was $750, but on Ethereum it was $19,000. So I wonder, do you think we are seeing that the layer two S are able to kind of draw in a different user and enable new behaviors that are sort of prohibited due to the cost of gas on Ethereum?
00:58:50.658 - 00:59:05.100, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. That supports the thesis that layer twos and side chains are good for low dollar value, high throughput use cases if transaction count is so high, but the average dollar value being transacted is also low.
00:59:05.710 - 00:59:06.122, Speaker A: Okay.
00:59:06.176 - 00:59:11.040, Speaker B: And at the moment, do you feel like there's any layer two that you kind of would put your money on?
00:59:11.810 - 00:59:37.410, Speaker C: Well, Polygon isn't quite a layer two. It's a side chain. But Polygon is like one that's probably the only layer two side chain that has a decent amount of traction. I forgot was a curve. Ave, one of the blue chip D Five projects, actually has more TVL on Polygon than layer one. So there is actually real usage on Polygon.
00:59:37.570 - 00:59:38.182, Speaker B: Okay.
00:59:38.316 - 00:59:52.650, Speaker A: As for layer two, I think loop ring is like the most time tested. If you wanted to do trades, it's been battle tested and they've done a couple of billions at least in volume, in trading volume.
00:59:53.630 - 01:00:12.350, Speaker B: All right, so we'll just have to see how that plays out. Earlier this year, there was a lot of hand wringing about competitors like Binance smart chain and know hand wringing amongst the Ethereum set. So what would you say the metrics show in terms of that? Does Ethereum still need to worry about losing market share to these other chains?
01:00:13.170 - 01:00:59.422, Speaker C: With binance smart chain, like, a lot of the use cases were around the Dgen yield farming. So kind of like Ethereum DeFi somewhere back in July, August, and when that cooled down, then all that activity just shifted over to binance smart chain. So it's a lot of short term trading activity, but I haven't really seen any long term serious projects being built on binance smart chain. I think a big reason is like credible neutrality is because if the thesis is that institutions are going to adopt blockchain tech cryptocurrencies in a meaningful way, they want to do it on a credible, neutral platform like Ethereum, not like CZ or Binance's Pet Project, which is why Ethereum has that advantage for more institutional adoption of now.
01:00:59.476 - 01:01:53.390, Speaker B: But a question for you, because you may have seen that on Twitter. The week that we are recording this. I released some clips of my last show in which Justin Drake of the Ethereum Foundation was saying things about Bitcoin. And I saw a lot of people discussing some of the things he said, like he was bringing up whether or not Bitcoin could safely transition to a model in which it was being secured simply by transaction fees. But he also said that he thought Ethereum was vision. So one thing is that I noticed that a lot of Bitcoiners were saying to me that they thought that Ethereum was basically centralized and even things like they thought that it was a security. But the SEC did already come out and say that it wasn't a security.
01:01:53.390 - 01:02:12.134, Speaker B: So I'm not sure why they were saying that, but I think they were just trying to imply like they think it's centralized. So what's the difference between why the way that you phrase it, you seem to think that Ethereum is not even though it has an identifiable creator, whereas you think finance smart chain might be.
01:02:12.332 - 01:02:51.890, Speaker C: Well, binance smart chain has only 21 validators and they're all run by finance. And also I think a major component of decentralization is how easy it is for anyone to spin up their own node. And for binance smart chain, because they increase the blocks limit so high, you need to have a really dedicated hardware setup in order to run a binance smart chain node in order to sync to the latest block. Whereas for Ethereum you could even run Ethereum node on a Raspberry pi just because the sync is a lot more friendly for retail hardware.
01:02:52.310 - 01:03:53.080, Speaker A: And you mentioned also Solana and I think that I guess there's a little bit of a difference there where binance chain, binance smart chain anyone can in theory kind of pretty easily move Ethereum stuff over while Solana is like a total difference or set up and stack and programming language and all of that. And that means that they're kind of taking a harder route but it also probably makes them more resilient, right? And then they're building up an ecosystem more from the ground up, which I think makes them more potentially powerful longer term competition to Ethereum. And I think that's just super healthy that there's something else that also pushing it and trying to make a slightly different version of the future of finance in parallel and then the pressure is on Ethereum to develop and realize its vision as soon as possible.
01:03:55.210 - 01:04:18.190, Speaker B: So now we're kind of like talking about the merge which is when all the activity on Ethereum 1.0 actually finally shifts over to the so called beacon chain on Ethereum too. So how do you think that's going to go? And do you think Ethereum, like I said earlier, does it still need to worry about losing market share to chains like Solana?
01:04:18.690 - 01:04:42.360, Speaker A: Probably, hopefully they should always sort of worry about that. I think it's like kind of any ecosystem sort of is healthy if there's some competition going on. So I think that if sort of Ethereum developers and the Ethereum ecosystem just thinks that they've sort of gotten to this unbeatable position, that's probably not a healthy thing for that project.
01:04:43.050 - 01:04:48.362, Speaker B: But are you seeing anything on Chain that makes you think this is happening?
01:04:48.496 - 01:05:46.698, Speaker A: Yeah, so currently no, I'd say it's still too early. And these new systems, even though they have projects building on them and there are some users, it still seems like it's very early. And the key question is can they actually obtain sort of other traffic, I think, or other usage that's not just directly forks or kind of copies of what's happening on Ethereum, but something that's actually theirs organically or by them driven and then that sort of can get momentum and then eventually maybe someone will sort of move over. But I think it's still too early to tell. It feels like. It's maybe like Ethereum 20, 15, 16 kind of phase of development where it's still just very experimental what's being built. It seems like they're sort of doing something interesting in my mind.
01:05:46.864 - 01:05:52.474, Speaker B: All right, Richard, did you want to add anything about this transition to Ethereum 2.0?
01:05:52.672 - 01:06:00.830, Speaker C: Proof of stake has been on the roadmap for many, many years, and it's good that it's just around the corner and it's finally about to launch.
01:06:01.890 - 01:06:02.446, Speaker A: Okay.
01:06:02.548 - 01:06:13.730, Speaker B: All right, so to wrap up, why don't you each summarize where you think the market will go for the rest of the year when it comes to ETH, DeFi, and NFTs?
01:06:16.730 - 01:07:04.434, Speaker A: As always, predictions are really hard in crypto, but I think DeFi has established itself as something that's here to stay, and it might grow, might double in activity or might not, but I think it's undeniably here at a really solid level. Then NFTs, I think, are likely to cool off somewhat, but with a lot of interesting activity and attention established, that's going to stay there and be very interesting over time. And I guess for E, all of this activity is great and EIP 1559 is great. So I think in general, I don't see any reason why it should cool off.
01:07:04.632 - 01:07:40.880, Speaker C: Yeah, I would agree with all those points. And I guess in general, with 1559 now, ethereum is like this kind of an index bet on all the economic activity that's happening. So whether we have another DFI summer and suddenly a lot of ETH is being burned from transaction volume, or if you have all these avatar projects that are being dropped and people are paying ridiculous amounts of gas, and ETH is also capturing value from that. So it's a good way for ETH to capture value from economic activity regardless of where it comes from.
01:07:41.330 - 01:07:50.686, Speaker B: All right, great. So where can people learn more about each of you, your respective companies, and also different on chain metrics that they might be interested in for ETH DeFi?
01:07:50.718 - 01:08:21.370, Speaker A: And so, yeah, we're Dune XYZ and Dune Analytics on Twitter, and we have a few thousand dashboards out there that you can look at. And I'm at Haga. H-A-G-A-E-T-C on Twitter. It's not actually Ethereum classic reference, it's Et cetera, but I took that mix before EPC was a thing. Yeah. And one of our top creators is Richard.
01:08:22.350 - 01:08:31.546, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm top creator on Dune, so I'm RChn eight on Dune if you want to search for all my Dune dashboards. And also Richard Chan 39 on Twitter.
01:08:31.658 - 01:08:35.550, Speaker B: Okay, perfect. All right, well, thank you both so much for coming on Unchained.
01:08:36.050 - 01:08:37.402, Speaker A: Thank you. It's a pleasure.
01:08:37.466 - 01:08:38.522, Speaker C: Thanks, Laura.
01:08:38.666 - 01:08:56.130, Speaker B: Thanks so much for joining us today.
