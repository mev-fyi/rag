00:00:00.170 - 00:00:04.574, Speaker B: My work phone is my iPhone. This is kind of my nft phone.
00:00:04.772 - 00:00:26.294, Speaker A: Oh, I see. Okay, well, you know, so I'm assuming, correct me if I'm wrong, that that was like a disappointment, that it didn't sell better. You know, what are your plans to. Are you going to roll out another one? Are you just going to try to get more apps in the store, more discounts? What are your plans with the phone?
00:00:26.412 - 00:00:58.540, Speaker B: Yeah, we're debating this internally. We really needed to hit like, I think, 25,000 to 50,000 units to feel like there is a hardcore user base for developers to be compelled to ship applications. And what's also changed, I would say, over the last year and a half, is the mobile interfaces like progressive web apps plus Paskis have really shrunk the difference between a dedicated device to the kind of tools that developers can use to get that experience.
