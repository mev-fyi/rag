00:00:00.200 - 00:00:01.929, Speaker A: Wait, so what is the block time you would want?
00:00:02.097 - 00:00:03.361, Speaker B: So there's a limit at some point.
00:00:03.393 - 00:00:05.889, Speaker A: Yeah, but I mean, what would you want roughly?
00:00:05.937 - 00:00:09.833, Speaker B: Like 250 milliseconds.
00:00:09.929 - 00:00:14.617, Speaker A: 250 mill. That's faster than Solana. You want faster than Solana? Blocks on Ethereum?
00:00:14.721 - 00:00:14.937, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:00:14.961 - 00:00:15.457, Speaker B: Fuck it.
00:00:15.521 - 00:00:16.393, Speaker D: Not a dividend.
00:00:16.489 - 00:00:17.665, Speaker C: It's a tale of two quant.
00:00:17.745 - 00:00:20.369, Speaker A: Now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet.
00:00:20.457 - 00:00:22.881, Speaker D: Generally speaking, airdrops are kind of pointless anyways.
00:00:23.033 - 00:00:25.777, Speaker A: Unnamed trading firms who were very involved.
00:00:25.881 - 00:00:28.465, Speaker C: Alec Eth is the ultimate defi.
00:00:28.505 - 00:00:41.201, Speaker A: Protocols are the antidote to this problem. Hello, everybody. Welcome to the chopping block. Every couple weeks, the four of us get together and give the industry insider's perspective on the crypto topics of the day. So, quick intros. First we've got Tom the Defi Maven and master of memes.
00:00:41.273 - 00:00:42.177, Speaker D: Hello, everyone.
00:00:42.361 - 00:00:45.337, Speaker A: Next we've got Tarun, the Giga Brain and Grand Poobah at Gauntlet.
00:00:45.441 - 00:00:46.137, Speaker C: Yo.
00:00:46.281 - 00:00:49.593, Speaker A: Today we've got a special guest, Stani, the architect of aave.
00:00:49.769 - 00:00:50.577, Speaker B: Hello.
00:00:50.761 - 00:01:12.669, Speaker A: And I'm Haseeb, the head hype man at Dragonfly. So we're early stage investors in crypto, but I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice, legal advice, or even life advice. Please see Chopping block XYZ for more disclosures. So we are together in person in Salt Lake City for permissionless. We're rounding out the year of conferences. It's been a very busy time of year. I just heard that you guys were at mainnet in New York City.
00:01:12.669 - 00:01:21.237, Speaker A: Tell us what mainnet was like, because I, I heard not amazing things about the main net turnout. Sonny, what was. You said you were there. Tell us, Tell us what the.
00:01:21.301 - 00:01:22.109, Speaker C: I didn't even go.
00:01:22.197 - 00:01:23.185, Speaker A: You didn't go?
00:01:23.685 - 00:01:25.213, Speaker C: Hometown. It's in my hometown.
00:01:25.269 - 00:01:26.789, Speaker A: How did you not go? I was too close.
00:01:26.877 - 00:01:28.861, Speaker D: I think it's just like, I didn't go either.
00:01:28.933 - 00:01:29.585, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:01:30.545 - 00:01:31.657, Speaker A: You went to side events, right?
00:01:31.681 - 00:01:34.121, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, TAR had an afterparty, actually.
00:01:34.193 - 00:01:35.217, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly.
00:01:35.321 - 00:01:37.725, Speaker A: So if you had an event, you kind of went.
00:01:38.345 - 00:01:50.137, Speaker C: I think it's just more like, hey, you know, people are in town, maybe have a little party. But I, I, I, I feel like everyone I talked to was like, I'm not going. Like, I just kept asking people, are you going to this conference?
00:01:50.281 - 00:01:54.065, Speaker B: And I think a lot of people who came were like, outside of, Outside of New York.
00:01:54.145 - 00:01:54.425, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:01:54.465 - 00:02:00.903, Speaker B: And there was like, there was like, talk in 2049. It was a huge event and, like, people are like, topped out, I think.
00:02:00.959 - 00:02:01.359, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:02:01.447 - 00:02:02.375, Speaker A: A lot of conference for tea.
00:02:02.415 - 00:02:02.703, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:02:02.759 - 00:02:04.127, Speaker A: So, okay, you were at the main event.
00:02:04.191 - 00:02:05.215, Speaker B: I was at the main event.
00:02:05.335 - 00:02:07.831, Speaker A: What was it like getting on stage at mainnet?
00:02:07.943 - 00:02:22.131, Speaker B: I mean, first of all, it was great for me to be there in New York, but I do think it was way more quiet than it was in Singapore. And Singapore audience was a little bit different because it feels like the east and the west were there in terms of, like, crypto.
00:02:22.223 - 00:02:22.643, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:02:22.739 - 00:02:36.375, Speaker B: Main. It wasn't like that. It was. I'd say it was like a lower turnout, and it was more, I would say, a little bit stratified to some extent. RWAs was one big topic that people were talking about.
00:02:36.915 - 00:03:02.831, Speaker D: I feel like that's kind of my vibe of mainnet, though, is like, that is. That is the people who normally go. But, I mean, obviously the big thing is Selkis is no longer part of Missouri, and I feel like he's also kind of the draw. So I feel like they're actually kind of doubly cursed in that, like, people who would normally go to, like, see his, like, aren't going to go or because he's not there. And then other people are, like, very turned off by his whole, like, political bent, and so they're also, like, not going to go. And so I feel like actually Selkies.
00:03:02.863 - 00:03:03.935, Speaker A: Was not there at all.
00:03:04.055 - 00:03:05.271, Speaker D: I think he did show up, but he was.
00:03:05.303 - 00:03:05.855, Speaker B: He did show up.
00:03:05.895 - 00:03:10.495, Speaker D: He's not the mc, really. No, no. He left Masari, so I think.
00:03:10.535 - 00:03:12.655, Speaker A: So who's emceeing now? Who's, like, the main guy?
00:03:12.735 - 00:03:22.801, Speaker D: This is exactly the point. It's like, I don't know. I'm not going to this event. And so I feel like he's probably. Probably feeling vindicated in some ways that it's like, you know, look at what this conference is. Look at this company is without me. Like, you know, I.
00:03:22.801 - 00:03:23.793, Speaker D: I am sorry.
00:03:23.929 - 00:03:26.497, Speaker A: I see. I see. So it's like Apple without Steve Jobs.
00:03:26.521 - 00:03:26.753, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:03:26.809 - 00:03:27.513, Speaker C: Look at me now.
00:03:27.569 - 00:03:28.245, Speaker D: All right.
00:03:29.025 - 00:03:40.233, Speaker A: Okay. All right. Well, we. Hopefully Permissionless is better vibes than that, but I don't know what the. What the turnout for Permissionless is going to be, but hoping it's going to be somewhat better because I just feel like a lot of people are here.
00:03:40.289 - 00:03:40.545, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:03:40.585 - 00:03:46.379, Speaker C: Yeah. Also, why do. Why are all these conferences stacked in this time of year? Like, why not spread them out throughout the year?
00:03:46.427 - 00:03:53.435, Speaker A: If you remember last year, they did Permissionless literally at the same time as Token. And so it was. You had to pick one or the other. And that was a big mistake. I Think.
00:03:53.475 - 00:03:56.907, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. And there's like, no events beginning of the year. Like, there's just.
00:03:56.971 - 00:03:59.595, Speaker C: Exactly. Why not just spread? Do your event then?
00:03:59.715 - 00:04:02.615, Speaker B: Actually, I like it because I don't need to travel half of the year.
00:04:02.955 - 00:04:03.851, Speaker A: Well, it's like, you know, it's great.
00:04:03.883 - 00:04:04.371, Speaker B: I can build.
00:04:04.443 - 00:04:05.619, Speaker A: I want to stay home, you know.
00:04:05.667 - 00:04:08.767, Speaker C: No, no. It's cold in half of the world. The other half is hot.
00:04:08.851 - 00:04:09.399, Speaker A: That's true.
00:04:09.487 - 00:04:12.063, Speaker C: Australia. Australia could be over all the confidence.
00:04:12.119 - 00:04:35.315, Speaker A: Parts of the world, though, you know? So. Yeah, okay. But speaking of token 2049. So actually, I wanted to issue a correction. So if you guys recall, on stage, we were with Moshe and Arthur Hayes. And while I was on Stage at token 2049, I made a statement about Kaya, the blockchain that was a fusion between Clayton and Fuchsia, or, sorry, Fincha, which was the line. Blockchain.
00:04:35.315 - 00:05:01.291, Speaker A: And I made a claim that I heard from some guy at a party that the Kaya blockchain was a rebrand from Clayton because Clayton had been raided by the CEO of Kakao and that they had stolen a bunch of money. So apparently this was. I got in touch with the Kaya team because they were not happy to hear that I was saying this. Apparently. That is bullshit. That is not correct. I probably should not be reciting things that I heard from random people at parties.
00:05:01.291 - 00:05:03.137, Speaker A: So. So apologies to the Kaya team.
00:05:03.241 - 00:05:04.801, Speaker B: Unless it's Tarun's party.
00:05:04.873 - 00:05:07.801, Speaker A: Yeah, all sorts of bullshit.
00:05:07.913 - 00:05:08.897, Speaker C: There you go. Exactly.
00:05:08.961 - 00:05:14.105, Speaker A: But, yeah, I try to avoid just, you know, just reiterating complete bullshit rumors. So.
00:05:14.185 - 00:05:22.057, Speaker C: But actually, this is. This is a good. This is good proof that you're getting insider gossip, although maybe. Maybe bad insider gossip.
00:05:22.161 - 00:05:34.691, Speaker A: That guy was not an insider. He was just like some guy at a. Korea. Korean. A Korean was basically my source for this. So, yeah, it was kind of a throwaway comment, but I don't want to be going out there just talking bullshit. So anyway.
00:05:34.691 - 00:06:14.765, Speaker A: Okay, so putting all that stuff aside, let's talk about some other bullshit that's going on. So there's an HBO documentary that's supposed to drop today. The HBO documentary is called Money Electric, the Bitcoin Mystery. And the hype around the show is just going to drop on HBO Max. And the hype around the show is that it's going to supposedly reveal who the documentarians believe is Satoshi Nakamoto. So there's a polymarket market for who is going to be the person that they name in the documentary as Satoshi Nakamoto. And right now, as Of a few days ago, Len Sassamin was the leading candidate who's like this cryptographer, PGP early cypherpunk guy.
00:06:14.765 - 00:06:46.767, Speaker A: He has plummeted in the rankings. And actually, so far, there's been some speculation from somebody, I think it was Samson Mao, who was apparently interviewed in the show, who claim that nobody who's front running on Polymarket is going to be the person named on the show as Satoshi Nakamoto. So now the market has plummeted, and it's like 80% that it's going to be either nobody who's on the list or multiple people. So there's always. Every couple years, there's always this frenzy of, like, getting back into the speculation about who Satoshi Nakamoto is.
00:06:46.831 - 00:06:51.231, Speaker C: I feel like we haven't had one since the pandemic. I actually feel like the pandemic stopped all of this.
00:06:51.343 - 00:07:19.535, Speaker A: Well, there was a viral blog post about Len Sassamin that I think came out a couple years ago that got a lot of the speculation going. Again, I will say I've always found it kind of distasteful of the speculation about who is Satoshi Nakamoto, but I can't quite put my finger on why I feel that way. It just feels like a stupid thing to be spending time on. But I don't know. What do you guys feel? Because obviously nobody knows and the documentary will be live by the time this airs. But what do you guys feel about this hunting for Satoshi thing?
00:07:20.845 - 00:07:55.763, Speaker C: Well, first off, isn't this Sassamin thing, like, he has a bunch of. He, like, Satoshi has some posts after he died. So, like, if he is Satoshi, he's probably one of a group, and I don't know. Personally, I just prefer thinking it's a group and that they've, like, made a death pact and no one will ever know or it's a CIA or whatever, versus, like, one person. I feel like this idolatry of, like, it being one person is actually the problem is, like, there's this expectation that there is this single figure. But, like, what's the likelihood that's a single figure? I'm a little on the fence.
00:07:55.819 - 00:08:01.027, Speaker B: The thing with the group is that at that level, like, someone is tempted to actually talk about it.
00:08:01.051 - 00:08:01.259, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:08:01.307 - 00:08:15.895, Speaker B: It has to be, like, really, you know, secretive group or, like, I don't know, like, it feels like if there's that many, there's multiple people around it and they've been able to keep quiet so long, it feels like a really hard thing to do. For humans.
00:08:16.245 - 00:08:27.625, Speaker C: A lot of the candidates died, though not in pretty soon after. A lot of them died at weird times and in weird ways.
00:08:28.485 - 00:08:44.365, Speaker D: Yeah, I don't know. I think I do. I guess I don't distasteful. But I find it strange that people, so many people are curious. A. I find it very hard to believe that you're going to find smoking gun evidence at this point. If you consider all the time and energy and bounty that's basically gone trying to find satoshi.
00:08:44.365 - 00:09:10.577, Speaker D: It's like now, almost 20 years later, we're going to find some. That just seems very improbable to me. And two is part of the appeal of bitcoin, I think is the immaculate conception. And we don't know who satoshi is and there isn't some doofus who we're never going to dig up all the bad history and be like, look at all these bad things this person said. Or I feel like anyone at some point is going to get milkshake ducked. And so I think just let it be. That is kind of the point.
00:09:10.577 - 00:09:14.511, Speaker D: And it's like, what outcome do you want from this? I don't think there's anything to put it.
00:09:14.543 - 00:09:16.607, Speaker A: I think the answers can only be bad.
00:09:16.671 - 00:09:17.031, Speaker D: Yes.
00:09:17.103 - 00:09:38.577, Speaker A: Right. Like there are. No, there are a bunch of okay answers and then there's some really, really bad answers. Like Adam back is a very bad answer. Satoshi, you know, or like, you know, Peter Todd or if that turns out to be Satoshi is just like, that's. I don't know where the world goes, but not in a good direction. If it turns out that like, yes, you know, he's alive and still has all the keys and it's just, you know, everything is terrible.
00:09:38.671 - 00:09:39.345, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:09:39.925 - 00:09:55.629, Speaker A: I don't know. So I get part of it. It feels very like kind of JFK assassination Y where it's like this. It's a fixation for a kind of person who. Their brainpower would be better spent on other things. Right. That's kind of why I think I don't like it so much.
00:09:55.629 - 00:10:22.555, Speaker A: And to your point, like it doesn't matter. It sort of hurts this immaculate conception story. And like the whole point of bitcoin is it doesn't matter who made it and that the person who like, even if it is add them back. Which again, probably not. But even if it is at and back, who cares? What does it matter other than okay, well, this guy has tens of billions of dollars of bitcoin now. And okay, that's potentially concerning. But beyond that, it doesn't give him any more legitimacy in deciding where Bitcoin should go.
00:10:22.935 - 00:10:45.105, Speaker D: Yeah, I agree. The other thing that I think was funny about this prediction market is I feel like in some way is actually kind of a indictment of prediction markets that surely like press screeners and all these kinds of things have been set out. Like surely many people have watched this documentary at some point and yet nobody is betting on the. Or I guess maybe to, to the point. That's why it's 80% somebody else.
00:10:45.145 - 00:10:47.745, Speaker A: But like, well, that was only very recent. That was only in the last few days.
00:10:47.785 - 00:10:54.889, Speaker D: Right. But you would think someone would be maybe, I don't know, sort of showing their hand or like someone would have spoiled it at least just for like Internet points.
00:10:54.977 - 00:11:18.123, Speaker A: Well, I think what is being implied there, I mean, so obviously there's Samson Mouse saying, you know, he was on the show, so maybe he's seen it. In which case he's like, okay, it's none of the people on this list. So people move their bets after that. It could also well be that the people realize that, okay, the volume on this thing is speeding up as the hyper on the show is speeding up and then somebody who has access to, they know who the answer is. It's nobody on the list. There's nobody in the list. That's how you make money.
00:11:18.219 - 00:11:18.787, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:11:18.931 - 00:11:37.985, Speaker A: So at this point, like the, the thing that's interesting about this story more than anything is that it's kind of a new way to experience media. You know, this, this. Okay, there's a betting market on who it's going to be. There's teasers that roll into it. It could also well be that the producers of the show are American and so they can't bet on Polymarket.
00:11:38.025 - 00:11:51.025, Speaker D: You know, there used to be like Vegas books would offer odds on like TV series finales. Like you could bet on the Seinfeld finale and stuff like that. But it's like very one off bespoke kind of things. But we should get those going again. You know, it's.
00:11:51.105 - 00:11:59.509, Speaker C: Yes, the Sopranos, remember there was like a huge volume that was like the front page of a newspaper. Highest betting volume, whether he would die or who dies.
00:11:59.557 - 00:12:02.189, Speaker B: Because someone always dies in some problems.
00:12:02.357 - 00:12:03.293, Speaker A: See. I see.
00:12:03.349 - 00:12:10.421, Speaker B: But it could be even like interesting like a go to market strategy. Like just like create a market and stop growth.
00:12:10.493 - 00:12:11.305, Speaker C: Growth hack.
00:12:11.645 - 00:12:16.197, Speaker A: Yeah, put. Put some incentives to juice betting on the show. Yeah, yeah, that could be. That could be good.
00:12:16.261 - 00:12:26.245, Speaker C: I mean, honestly though, if I were to do that, I feel like reality TV shows have more have, have an audience that's captive and would be willing to bet more than like this type of stuff.
00:12:26.325 - 00:12:33.053, Speaker A: That's true. I mean that's already basically sports. Right. So you have to expand out from the sports betting market into other kinds of television.
00:12:33.149 - 00:12:39.445, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I would love to bet on Love Island. You know, who wins it. I don't know if you have it here.
00:12:39.565 - 00:12:45.465, Speaker C: The problem is. Yeah, I guess like the people on the show could definitely bet on themselves. That is true.
00:12:45.925 - 00:12:48.189, Speaker D: Yeah. You need again some sort of death pact or something.
00:12:48.237 - 00:12:49.585, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, exactly.
00:12:50.405 - 00:12:53.309, Speaker D: Or you just do multiple edits and you don't reveal who it is.
00:12:53.397 - 00:13:14.053, Speaker A: Yeah. All right, fair enough. Well, speaking of Poly Market. So Poly Market has also been ripping. Obviously we're now 25 days away, 30 days away from the election. So we're getting very, very close to home stretch Poly Market odds from Biden or Biden, Kamala versus Trump. We're now back to 55, 45.
00:13:14.053 - 00:13:48.661, Speaker A: It's been wavering up and down. Now it's about 50 in favor of Donald Trump. Once again, we've seen all time highs of volume. So the chart of betting volume for Polymarket just looks like it's getting steeper and steeper with every passing week. So the interesting thing now is that because the Poly Market odds have now diverged a little bit from a lot of the election modelers. So if you look at the New York Times, if you look at 538, you look at Nate Silver, their odds are pretty neck and neck. They're pretty close to 50, 50.
00:13:48.661 - 00:14:23.949, Speaker A: But polymarket kind of had this outsized move with a large amount of volume being bet very suddenly on Trump? So this has caused a lot of conversation about is there a Trump whale? Is this inorganic? Is there somebody trying to move the market intentionally towards Trump in a way that is outlying from the actual underlying odds? And if so, isn't the whole thesis that markets are supposed to correct this, but it doesn't seem like markets are correcting it to move back toward the odds from all the other pollsters. So curious to get people's thoughts. There's a lot of conversation now about this of is there some funny business going on in Polymarket in the home stretch of the election?
00:14:24.117 - 00:14:25.505, Speaker B: Elon, is that you?
00:14:26.245 - 00:14:36.099, Speaker A: There was some weird thread talking about, is this maybe Elon Musk? I find that to be just completely like, I read the thread, I'm just like, what is the evidence of that? There's some guy who bet a lot of money.
00:14:36.237 - 00:14:56.703, Speaker D: Yeah, there is. There is one account that just been accumulating Trump shares. And so, yeah, I don't think it's elon, but that is some of the pressure. But I think specifically there was just a weird move up. Like, a lot of this has been like, one leg up. I think it was like, basically Monday market open in the US there's like a tick up 2, 3%. And that's kind of where this is confirming now.
00:14:56.703 - 00:15:18.377, Speaker D: It's just persisting. But I think to your point, there's been all these conspiracy theories around, like, oh, well, I mean, like, you know, this market is, you know, symmetric. At least it has price right now, like, you could go and make money on this pretty easily. And then people always try to explain away, oh, well, you know, they have operational risk and, you know, you have opportunity cost. And that some of those are technically true, but I'm also like, 25.
00:15:18.481 - 00:15:20.865, Speaker C: Well, the opportunity. Exactly. Opportunity cost is bounded.
00:15:20.945 - 00:15:21.569, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah.
00:15:21.657 - 00:15:22.657, Speaker A: Now it's only a month away.
00:15:22.721 - 00:15:23.017, Speaker D: Yes.
00:15:23.081 - 00:15:24.409, Speaker A: So it's not bad.
00:15:24.497 - 00:15:39.731, Speaker D: So I think maybe part of it is, honestly, people, you know, don't have enough conviction there. There is just a wide range. There's a wide envelope of outcomes. And, you know, it's hard to say that you're really, you know, making, you know, 3 cents if you're, you know, selling trumpet 53 cents or vice versa.
00:15:39.803 - 00:15:40.011, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:15:40.043 - 00:15:42.851, Speaker D: You know, you can capture a bit of an R, but maybe it's not attractive enough for people.
00:15:42.923 - 00:15:43.395, Speaker C: So.
00:15:43.515 - 00:16:00.833, Speaker D: Or, you know, again, maybe someone has some sort of inside info. Maybe they're looking at future polls or something that is, like, indicating something more bullish for Trump. But I don't know. I think everything else, I kind of assume the market is working as intended and it's functional. And, like, I'm inclined to more trust that more than, again, some of the even more sophisticated models.
00:16:00.929 - 00:16:03.097, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, polling error is a lot wider than three points.
00:16:03.161 - 00:16:26.935, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, exactly. I mean, my thing is actually, I think the elasticity of the market versus the elasticity of the polls to, like, certain events is very different. Like, the polls don't respond to these, like, 60 minutes type of things as fast as, like, the market does. And I feel like that 60 Minutes interview was, I mean, disastrous might be the wrong word, but it was not a good interview.
00:16:29.195 - 00:16:32.347, Speaker D: To call her daddy interview with. With Kamala that was.
00:16:32.491 - 00:16:35.347, Speaker A: That probably got a lot wider distribution than 60 Minutes.
00:16:35.531 - 00:16:48.063, Speaker C: Yeah, I just watched the 60 Minutes one because, like, I thought that and I don't think that people were maybe, like, I don't think it was like, the Same demographic that is trading on Poly Market is the one listing the 60 Minutes.
00:16:48.179 - 00:16:48.455, Speaker A: Right.
00:16:48.495 - 00:17:00.823, Speaker C: But the TikTok reels and the. The. The small videos that people were making from it were very bad, let's put it that way. I was. I was actually like. It had a lot of bloopers, but. Yes, yes, yes.
00:17:00.999 - 00:17:06.239, Speaker A: We've been through this before. You watch TikTok, you have to watch. You also watch TikTok.
00:17:06.327 - 00:17:11.991, Speaker B: Yeah, totally. It's like you get the. You know, you get the news fastest from. From TikTok. Like, that's why.
00:17:12.103 - 00:17:12.943, Speaker A: News fastest?
00:17:12.999 - 00:17:32.706, Speaker B: Yeah, because, like, in. In TikTok, also, like, you get lot of video. So for me, actually, TikTok works really well. And because I go from every direction on TikTok, like, the algorithm just keeps changing. It's really. Actually, it gives me, like, from the hurricane news and everything, all the. All the latest news.
00:17:32.770 - 00:17:35.194, Speaker A: You're getting us news. You're in London, right?
00:17:35.234 - 00:17:47.381, Speaker B: Yeah, Yeah. I mean, the TikTok algorithm really is really something else. Like, it really picks quite well of your location backgrounds, even like, if you use the same wifi and similar type of content from.
00:17:47.413 - 00:17:49.653, Speaker A: What content on your TikTok?
00:17:49.709 - 00:17:50.821, Speaker B: Actually, I don't at all.
00:17:50.893 - 00:17:52.933, Speaker A: That's no crypto. No, I see.
00:17:53.029 - 00:18:11.887, Speaker B: I do think there was some correlation between Elon. Like, there's interesting events. Elon stepping into the Trump rally in Butler. And then same time, you have this huge bet on polymarket. I think that's what you mentioned about the audiences, that there's some correlation there.
00:18:11.991 - 00:18:12.319, Speaker A: Okay.
00:18:12.367 - 00:18:12.743, Speaker B: I still.
00:18:12.799 - 00:18:19.055, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I use TikTok for restaurant reviews, honestly, because I think the best restaurant Reviews are on TikTok, so.
00:18:19.135 - 00:18:20.175, Speaker B: Oh, that is. That is true.
00:18:20.215 - 00:18:31.927, Speaker C: The really good restaurant reviews, much better. The Google reviews are all gerrymandered and fake reviews, but the TikTok restaurant reviews, it's much harder to fake the full video right now. I mean, I know in five years we won't be saying that, but, like.
00:18:31.951 - 00:18:32.303, Speaker A: Right.
00:18:32.399 - 00:18:34.607, Speaker C: And so, like, you get good restaurant reviews.
00:18:34.671 - 00:18:36.255, Speaker A: Wait, are you. Are you also a TikTok consumer?
00:18:36.295 - 00:18:36.935, Speaker D: I deleted it.
00:18:36.975 - 00:18:37.399, Speaker A: You deleted it?
00:18:37.407 - 00:18:39.823, Speaker D: Yeah. Yeah, just not.
00:18:39.919 - 00:18:41.119, Speaker A: Yeah. I don't trust TikTok.
00:18:41.247 - 00:18:42.527, Speaker B: I honestly trust them all.
00:18:42.591 - 00:18:46.675, Speaker C: I used to be like that. And then I just use it on this burner Android phone.
00:18:47.175 - 00:18:50.823, Speaker A: Okay. You have a dedicated TikTok phone.
00:18:50.959 - 00:18:52.791, Speaker B: You don't want to give any data.
00:18:52.903 - 00:18:54.271, Speaker C: It doesn't touch my normal phone.
00:18:54.343 - 00:19:05.343, Speaker A: All right. Damn, that's good. Yeah, that's. That's. I actually, I tried TikTok. This is totally unrelated to crypto, but I tried TikTok once in Singapore because it was on a TV. There was like a smart TV that had TikTok on it.
00:19:05.343 - 00:19:25.071, Speaker A: And so I was like, all right, I'm going to try TikTok because it's not my machine, it's not connected me in any way. And so I saw Southeast Asian TikTok which like aggregates a lot of different countries together because it, because it doesn't know where you're from. So it gives you like some Vietnamese content, some Indonesian content, some Chinese content. It's really strange. It's really a strange experience, but did not make me want to spend more time on TikTok.
00:19:25.223 - 00:19:55.491, Speaker C: Yeah, I guess the, but going back to the, yeah, sorry, the podcast and the, these clips. Yeah, I think the clips from these events are probably, are from these recordings. These like long power plus long things are much more impactful to the Poly Market pricing than they are to the polls. And I also think the poll sampling is like, I, I, if you look at the median age in a lot of the polls, it's like way higher than the median age of like Poly market user.
00:19:55.563 - 00:19:55.771, Speaker A: Right.
00:19:55.803 - 00:19:58.055, Speaker C: So in some sense they're, they're just different.
00:19:58.195 - 00:20:10.399, Speaker A: Yeah, that's probably right. That like they're doing corrections for it, but those corrections probably can incorporate something like this podcast just came out and TikTok hates it, you know, and like that's, that's losing her some of the Gen Z vote or something like that.
00:20:10.447 - 00:20:19.671, Speaker C: Yeah. I have never seen Poly Market advertised to me on TikTok. Have you? No advertisement or just like, sorry, like someone not advertised?
00:20:19.783 - 00:20:23.557, Speaker B: There's a lot of crypto content on TikTok, but it just doesn't surface to me.
00:20:23.631 - 00:20:29.505, Speaker A: You get crypto content. Okay. Yeah, it seems, it seems very different than the kind of stuff on Twitter.
00:20:29.585 - 00:20:43.005, Speaker C: I think the only time I've ever seen crypto content on TikTok was 2021 when I would get, I got a TikTok that was like, here's how to log on to Binance Smart chain and buy SafeMoon.
00:20:45.225 - 00:20:47.761, Speaker A: Yeah, there's, there's, I mean there's a lot of onboarding.
00:20:47.793 - 00:20:48.645, Speaker C: Good old times.
00:20:49.305 - 00:20:54.227, Speaker A: I know a lot of Meme coin stuff happens on TikTok and we don't. We have content on TikTok.
00:20:54.331 - 00:21:12.523, Speaker D: We've been experimenting with some shorts, kind of just a classic, you know, I've been trying to get our intern to do more of like the, you know, dual screen brain rock kind of thing. Get some like Subway Surfer going on the bottom. So if he's listening to this right now, which I assume he is. You know, tune into the chopping block TikTok for some, some good condensed content.
00:21:12.619 - 00:21:17.093, Speaker A: So we got. You got to get. You got to get subscribed to the. You can't subscribe, can you?
00:21:17.229 - 00:21:17.901, Speaker C: You can follow.
00:21:17.973 - 00:21:24.869, Speaker B: You can follow. Even, even the following isn't the. That big thing on. On TikTok because the algorithm is so powerful just such as the content.
00:21:24.957 - 00:21:35.573, Speaker A: So. Okay, so we're, as we're talking about politics, obviously, one of the big stories in crypto has been World Liberty Financial, which is the AAVE fork. I think it's still supposedly a fork.
00:21:35.669 - 00:21:37.293, Speaker B: Not a fork, not a fork, not a fork.
00:21:37.429 - 00:22:00.105, Speaker A: Okay, all right, let's get clear now that we have you here. We've been trafficking in rumors the entire time that this has been a story. So I'd love to get from your side the narrative of how did all this come together? What the hell is DOE Finance? How did it come into play? And what is the connection between World Liberty Financial and these guys who are helping run this thing and aave?
00:22:00.485 - 00:22:11.253, Speaker B: Yeah, so based on my understanding is that obviously Doe Fana is. Was a team that is basically forking AAVE and trying to do like some sort of lending protocol.
00:22:11.349 - 00:22:14.813, Speaker A: Is this a blessed fork? Is this like a, you know, you didn't know what's going on.
00:22:14.909 - 00:23:06.521, Speaker B: I mean, there is not really like, like friendly forks of aave. You know, people just use aave. But nevertheless, I think like, they wanted to basically use AAVE and build on that. And this team, essentially, they, their, their vision is to create a. Some sort of, like a new type of experience and to a new audience and basically bring some new users into DeFi, which I think is really interesting because I do think whether it's AAVE protocol or DEFI in general, it's permissionless protocol. So anyone can actually plug it, use it, regardless of their political backgrounds or whatever regions they are. But what's interesting here is that we don't have that much information about it.
00:23:06.521 - 00:23:18.049, Speaker B: We know that it's integration into the of markets and that there's going to be a new product, a new type of experience and a new audience that they're targeting.
00:23:18.097 - 00:23:21.521, Speaker A: So it sounds like they haven't talked that much with you guys.
00:23:21.673 - 00:24:10.465, Speaker B: Well, we, here's the thing, like, usually a lot of these things happen in the governance forum or either like at some point, essentially. So I actually wake up every day and I see something new in the governance forum and I'm like, fuck, I need to read this And a lot of time will go. A lot of things actually happen outside of our team and we don't know anything about it. There might be a service provider that is working with a particular team and they work on a proposal and a lot of things happen in very decentralized way. But I think that's the whole point of a decentralized organization is that these teams then don't need to rely on us. They can just go to the Dell and, you know, propose their thing. And also, like, if it's a pure integration, you can just plug it in.
00:24:10.465 - 00:24:11.417, Speaker B: So you don't, you don't.
00:24:11.481 - 00:24:13.969, Speaker A: This is not a pure integration. Right. They're forking aave.
00:24:14.057 - 00:24:15.121, Speaker B: They're not forking aave.
00:24:15.233 - 00:24:16.049, Speaker A: They're not forking aave.
00:24:16.097 - 00:24:16.329, Speaker B: No.
00:24:16.377 - 00:24:19.569, Speaker A: They're using AAVE on the backend. Yeah. So their liquidity comes in through aave.
00:24:19.657 - 00:24:20.001, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:24:20.073 - 00:24:20.577, Speaker A: Oh, I see.
00:24:20.641 - 00:24:24.425, Speaker B: And there's some easy way of like onboarding with fiat and whatnot.
00:24:24.585 - 00:24:25.225, Speaker A: Okay.
00:24:25.345 - 00:24:27.377, Speaker B: So I mean, respectively, way, way at.
00:24:27.401 - 00:24:50.603, Speaker C: The WLF is a meme coin officially, because it doesn't really have any applications, blah, blah, blah. Right. Like, it's an infrastructure flavored meme coin. If it doesn't control the infrastructure parameters, doesn't control fees, why does it control the risk parameters? I guess it does for a vault or something that I own. I don't know.
00:24:50.739 - 00:24:53.051, Speaker B: First of all, there's some sort of a vault structure.
00:24:53.123 - 00:24:53.739, Speaker C: Okay, okay.
00:24:53.827 - 00:24:56.419, Speaker B: Some sort of a vault structure where if their fee.
00:24:56.467 - 00:24:57.875, Speaker C: Okay, if their fees. I take it back.
00:24:57.915 - 00:25:00.015, Speaker B: Yeah, there's fees, there's an audience.
00:25:00.895 - 00:25:10.391, Speaker D: But what about all the wallet front ends that are charging fees? You know, those like meme coins for Uniswap? Like. No, those are, those are real apps that are like, you know, just charging fees on top of.
00:25:10.543 - 00:25:12.559, Speaker C: No, no. But they don't have a token. Whereas this is like.
00:25:12.607 - 00:25:13.519, Speaker D: They do have tokens.
00:25:13.567 - 00:25:14.263, Speaker A: Oh, yes, they do.
00:25:14.319 - 00:25:14.775, Speaker C: Like who?
00:25:14.855 - 00:25:16.015, Speaker D: Like Banana Gun.
00:25:16.095 - 00:25:23.287, Speaker C: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure, sure, sure, sure. Yeah. I, I guess if you're comparing it to that, I was thinking more like Phantom or like a vertically integrated.
00:25:23.351 - 00:25:25.999, Speaker D: Oh, sure. But they're still making, you know, money, like, for sure.
00:25:26.127 - 00:25:50.863, Speaker B: But if you have audience and you have user base, then basically kind of like you can manage that and control like fees, for example. So I think there's a lot to do. I actually think that we should figure out beyond kind of like these infrastructure protocols and what can be done on that app level if you actually own the users and what you can basically do with fees and sharing revenue, it.
00:25:50.879 - 00:26:11.757, Speaker A: Still feels Like a weird access point to bring people into crypto. I mean, obviously everybody loves aave and the lending markets and money markets are some of the oldest things that have really worked in defi. But they are kind of a power user thing. Like you sort of show the first thing you do is not like, great, let me borrow against my ether and recursively stake or something.
00:26:11.861 - 00:26:33.265, Speaker B: Yeah. But I think the power user comes because AAVE enables all these different pools and strategies. But the most simple use case is just like if you have a stable coin, put it somewhere and then like the step more like easier from that is. That's true. How do you go from like just put your fiat and in the back end it goes to aave essentially. So like there is kind of like.
00:26:33.305 - 00:26:48.765, Speaker A: I guess easier path. You bring people in off the street. Like, because my. I'm imagining, okay, you're selling people steak knives for profit universities and say, oh, here's your, here's the crypto thing you can do. Come into here and like borrow against your assets. Or like I would think it'd be like, okay, trade meme coins. You know, do some other.
00:26:49.575 - 00:26:50.359, Speaker D: I think that would.
00:26:50.447 - 00:26:51.635, Speaker A: Exactly, exactly.
00:26:52.175 - 00:27:17.419, Speaker C: But. But actually I still think WLF is good as a meme coin because one anecdotal thing I will say walking around New York, which is weird, right? In New York, I would not. I, I don't even think this was, this was definitely not true in 2016 and 2020. But the amount of Trump merchandise being sold on the street is insane. And I feel like if WLF is a meme coin, it's just a. It's basically. It's the same as that stuff I see in the street.
00:27:17.467 - 00:27:19.715, Speaker A: I think there's unlicensed, I mean online.
00:27:19.835 - 00:27:33.451, Speaker C: Unlicensed Trump stuff is selling everywhere in Chinatown. You can't walk anywhere in New York without seeing it. It's like. Which is. Was not never true in the last few elections. So like, I feel like WLF could capture the market.
00:27:33.523 - 00:28:07.425, Speaker B: I mean, I think you have both. Right. So like defined a back end, you know, secure and then, you know, meme coin in the front end and governing fees. But I, I do think why it makes sense to me, for example, is that we don't really have CEFI defi when it comes to lending. Remember Blockfi, Celsius and Genesis, whatever lending, they don't exist anymore. So it's pretty much defi led mostly. And one thing what's interesting about these kind of C file lenders is that they were actually able to make it Very simple because they're very forward facing on the user.
00:28:07.425 - 00:28:22.553, Speaker B: So I think was like Celsius that was offering like, was it like consistent like 6% yields like super easy on the back end. Obviously they couldn't like sustain anything and like when the market crashed, but they were able to make it like super simple.
00:28:22.649 - 00:28:22.881, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:28:22.913 - 00:28:37.529, Speaker B: So I think like if you remove that backend that they had and just replace with like a defi backend with like AAVE and these other protocols, you could actually like focus completely on that owning a user and making it super easy to just supply funds.
00:28:37.617 - 00:28:38.245, Speaker A: Right.
00:28:38.985 - 00:29:10.921, Speaker D: I agree with you in principle. I think my question is how do you, I mean there's a balance between having to be super simple and then being transparent about risks to users. Like there were also a lot of, you know, ANCHOR NEO banks that like went through YC in 2021 and they just, yeah, you know, ach in your money and we'll give you 20% and it was just an anchor front end and then you know, kind of kind of went down. How do you sort of. Not that AAVE is anchored to be clear, but it's like how do you sort of think about disclosures and I guess like how much to kind of expose to the end user?
00:29:10.993 - 00:29:43.617, Speaker B: Well, good thing about DeFi is that there is like disclosure 247 kind of like it's just about like how do you bring it to the user. So I guess like there's like multiple steps removed between like the visibility and also things like also like resiliency that these DEFI protocols can be very resilient as we've seen. So it's just like the last mile. Like how do you make it safe and also easy to use? At least like defi removes some of the issues, but it's not kind of like a silver bullet. Like I mean after they can still screw up.
00:29:43.641 - 00:29:54.565, Speaker C: So yeah, after, after reading the 0x B1 lawsuit, let's just say I feel like that's a very far. Celsius was a far cry from we just use DEFI protocols to get yelled.
00:29:55.025 - 00:29:58.425, Speaker A: It's true is like disclosures don't stop you from making stupid decisions.
00:29:58.465 - 00:29:58.961, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.
00:29:58.993 - 00:30:10.849, Speaker A: They just stop you from hiding the stupidity. Right. But like you can still put your money in Anchor. Even if ANCHOR disclosed like everyone kind of knew that yeah, ANCHOR is not sustainable. I mean it's pretty tough to sustain this. The people are like, oh, they'll probably make it.
00:30:10.937 - 00:30:23.833, Speaker C: I mean one of my favorite governance fights in crypto of all time is the 2022 like, I think it's like March or February where people were trying to reduce the anchor interest rate.
00:30:23.889 - 00:30:24.593, Speaker A: I remember that.
00:30:24.689 - 00:30:27.761, Speaker C: That was so funny. That is like exactly this.
00:30:27.833 - 00:30:30.329, Speaker A: Very morbid now to look like, is it?
00:30:30.377 - 00:30:36.085, Speaker C: I feel like we've had a couple of years. We can make the jokes. This is, you know, I feel like we can make anchor jokes now. Right.
00:30:37.705 - 00:30:38.885, Speaker B: It's about time.
00:30:39.745 - 00:30:43.433, Speaker A: Anybody who died from that is like deep in the ground at this point, so. That's true.
00:30:43.529 - 00:30:53.513, Speaker D: Yeah. That was kind of remind me of the, you know, that drill tweet where it's like, someone help me. My family's starving. And it's like, food, $80. And the candles, $3,000. Spend less on candles. Like, no.
00:30:53.513 - 00:30:58.535, Speaker D: And it's like, that was like dough. It's like, we're not going to cut the rates, you know?
00:30:58.615 - 00:31:11.815, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. All right. Well, speaking of, speaking of rates, another big story that has come out this week is a redux of Operation Chokepoint 2.0 being now under the magnifying glass.
00:31:11.975 - 00:31:13.515, Speaker C: Can't make jokes about that.
00:31:16.175 - 00:32:24.143, Speaker A: We can make jokes about this, but it is a very live story. So Nick Carter has coined this term operation Showpoint 2.0 as being a description of the FDIC and the Fed putting a bunch of backdoor pressure on the banks, particularly after the collapse of ftx, to stop banking the crypto industry. So this has been kind of alluded to. There's a lot of gesticulation of, oh, maybe there was some untoward stuff that was happening, but some recent reporting by Nick Carter and then continued on by some of the Unchained team this week has shed a lot more light about the particular things that made or the particular ways in which regulators were putting pressure on the banks to stop banking crypto companies. So the two particular details that I thought were very salient in the story, one of them was that apparently the fhlb, which is the Federal Home Loan Board, which was a common source of funding for a lot of banks, was pressured by Elizabeth Warren to cut off Silvergate very early on, before any of the bond market pressures really started roiling over and making all this stuff very unpalatable. So apparently Elizabeth Warren was very directly intervening on the sources of capital for these banks to remain solvent.
00:32:24.143 - 00:33:53.827, Speaker A: A second point which was just brought up recently was that a lot of the folks at the banks as well as at FDIC and the Federal Reserve were communicating this 15% deposit cap, saying that banks should not have more than 15% of their deposits banked with crypto companies or crypto affiliated companies. Now, normally when you pass a rule like this, it has to go through a rulemaking process that is part of the apa, the Administrative Procedures act in the US you're not allowed to just decide this and promulgate something that is a rule without going through this act to allow some democratic input into this rulemaking procedure. However, the rulemakers and the regulators who were doing this at the time were not putting any of these rules into writing. They were not going through any kind of administrative procedures process, and they were intentionally only doing this through phone calls without avoiding a paper trail which would allow some kind of FOIA request to get information about the fact that, hey, it seems like there's some backdoor rulemaking going on that is not being admitted to in public. So if you notice any of the public statements that were made by the regulators at this time were all denying that there was any kind of pressure being put on the banks to not bank crypto companies. So now that a lot of this is coming up, especially due to some of the, I think the testimony in the Silvergate lawsuits, we're now getting a lot more of the word from these banks, as well as some of the backdoor reporting that's taking place through folks who are not willing to come fully on the record yet. But we're getting a fuller picture that Operation Chokepoint 2.0
00:33:53.827 - 00:34:22.671, Speaker A: was exactly what we thought it was, which was there was pressure from the administration and. Or from Elizabeth Warren or her compatriots to unbank the crypto industry and pin the tail on the donkey and say the banking crisis was because of crypto, even though now in retrospect, that was clearly not true. So reactions, responses from you guys of seeing how all this stuff is coming to light, that the pressure coming from the administration was much more direct than we thought it was.
00:34:22.783 - 00:34:27.275, Speaker C: I guess now I can make a joke. I guess we learned a lot about people's data retention policies.
00:34:28.655 - 00:34:29.399, Speaker A: In what direction?
00:34:29.447 - 00:34:33.930, Speaker C: In the sense that they were able to produce sufficient information about this.
00:34:34.022 - 00:34:35.362, Speaker A: But no, no, no, they didn't. They didn't.
00:34:35.418 - 00:34:36.818, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, exactly. As in they deleted.
00:34:36.866 - 00:34:37.314, Speaker A: Oh, yeah.
00:34:37.394 - 00:34:37.786, Speaker C: No, no, no.
00:34:37.810 - 00:34:39.306, Speaker A: It was. It was phone calls. It was phone calls.
00:34:39.370 - 00:34:40.058, Speaker C: Yeah, but they didn't.
00:34:40.106 - 00:34:45.082, Speaker A: Phone calls is the OG way signal. Disappearing messages are the. Are the new way OG is just phone calls.
00:34:45.138 - 00:35:30.245, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah. I had a similar kind of read where I was like, this feels like something that would have come out in like a FOIA request, but I guess to your point, like, that's obviously not possible and obviously it comes out through this Silvergate testimony or deposition or whatever happened. Yeah, I don't know, it's kind of like, I guess, shocking how on point, kind of the original image of what this was, was going to be. I was also really reading the wiki article for the original Operation Choke Point and kind of what happened, and I feel like there was actually not that much kind of political fallout from that. And so, I don't know, it feels kind of like maybe that also emboldens people to kind of do the same thing again. But, yeah, I don't know, it was just kind of shocking.
00:35:30.325 - 00:35:57.893, Speaker A: Yeah. So Operation Choke Point, the original Operation Chokepoint, for those who are unaware, it was pressure that was put on by the Obama administration against payday lending and a lot of these kind of firearms. Firearms, these are politically unpalatable industries. And it was sort of this nudge, nudge, okay. High risk industries should not be banked. And if they are, then maybe we're going to give you extra examinations or, you know, we're going to, we're going to make your life more annoying if you're, if you're a bank. And this was ruled later to be unconstitutional.
00:35:57.893 - 00:36:05.109, Speaker A: But as you mentioned, it's not like payday lenders are very popular. It's not like, you know, firearms dealers are exactly, you know, the thing that everybody cares about.
00:36:05.157 - 00:36:14.029, Speaker D: As I don't think people think this was like a stain on the Obama administration. You know, I think people remember like beige Suit Obama more than they remember, like Operation Chokepoint. Even those was, you know, way times worse.
00:36:14.157 - 00:36:42.965, Speaker A: Yeah, I think the counterpoint to that is that of course now crypto is much more politically organized. And I think, you know, I don't think about payday lenders as having any particular clout in D.C. but crypto, especially within the last year, has really gained a lot more clout such that I expect there will probably be congressional hearings, especially if we see Republicans take the House in or Republicans, especially if they sweep, then we're probably very likely going to be seeing congressional hearings about this. You guys have other reactions or.
00:36:43.045 - 00:37:19.175, Speaker B: No, I mean, I think we're also in the point where like, the amount of like crypto donations goes to both of these parties. I think we're, we're basically seeing like some amount of like, support also from Democrats. Now obviously we know like, kind of like the support that could be like on the Trump administration, but I do think that you have to reimagine again, like the position and measures for crypto and what to do in the future. Regardless who's going to be in the office. So I think that's going to. That's kind of like the difference we have now in the past.
00:37:19.295 - 00:37:54.941, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, the defense that might be levied in favor of this is to say, well, look, it was fog of war, there was a banking crisis. And you know, it's the job of regulators to try to get banks to diversify their deposit bases. So one might say, like, well, you know, I mean, can you really get that mad at. Regulators were saying, oh, it seems like crypto is exploding. You should probably lower your risk on it. I think the fact that this was all done through over phone calls and they were very clearly avoiding having a paper trail, to me feels like the biggest sign there's a guilty conscience here. And this is not just like, oh, hey, you know, bank regulators got it.
00:37:54.941 - 00:38:12.549, Speaker A: It's a tough job. You know, what are you going to do? This stuff, it feels very similar to the COVID What was it the thing that like where Anthony Fauci was like, they were giving us some. They were using like an asterisk for some work. You guys didn't see the story. There was something about the lab leap.
00:38:12.677 - 00:38:15.585, Speaker C: We're not reading as many conspiracy theories as you.
00:38:15.925 - 00:38:43.967, Speaker A: Clearly it's not a conspiracy theory. This again came out of congressional hearings that basically Anthony Fauci and I forget the department that he's responsible for, but basically there were more credible reports of a potential lab leak or potentially validating the Wuhan lab leak hypothesis. And they intentionally, in their emails where they're discussing it, they change the name to have like an ampersand or something so that it wouldn't show up in document searches for FOIA requests. So like, this is.
00:38:44.031 - 00:38:59.207, Speaker D: Yeah, I think this happened before too. People misspell stuff for. I think, I mean, some. To your point. I think they also discussed in the Unchained article that like, well, there wasn't pressure on SCB to diversify away from like VCs and startups. And that is arguably what brought it down.
00:38:59.231 - 00:38:59.367, Speaker A: Right.
00:38:59.391 - 00:39:10.429, Speaker D: It's like one sort of monotonous, very similar credit and risk profile group. And so it's like, it's weird that that crypto would be singled out when, you know, other other groups are not.
00:39:10.477 - 00:39:12.173, Speaker A: Or First Republic in New York real estate.
00:39:12.229 - 00:39:12.701, Speaker D: Yeah, right.
00:39:12.733 - 00:39:19.265, Speaker A: Which like, okay, that's a very. Not diversified. But, you know, was anyone telling them, like, hey, lower your exposure to New York real estate.
00:39:19.765 - 00:39:51.871, Speaker B: So I do think that, you know, FTX definitely like caused a lot of, a lot of the Challenges. And obviously the reception was that if this can happen with ftx, it can happen again. Obviously, that's one big challenge. I think in crypto maybe we can also do a little bit better. I don't know if self regulation is kind of the right way to think about it, but somehow self policing.
00:39:52.023 - 00:40:23.867, Speaker A: I was thinking about it the other day after our last show because we talked about the eigenlayer disclosures and we don't really have a standardized. People talk about like, okay, come in and register. There's securities laws that you can obey. Come in and register. Obviously there's no way for a token project to come in and register with the sec. And that's been widely attested to by everybody in the goddamn industry, including SEC Commissioner Hester Purce. That being said, the kind of disclosures that normal equity companies need to do are kind of useless for token projects.
00:40:23.867 - 00:40:47.539, Speaker A: And so people have kind of gestured at what a disclosures regime for tokens might look like. That does make sense. And I think if there were a credible, sensible disclosure regime, people would be happily willing to do it. It might slow down a little bit, but there's already a lot of costs associated with launching a token in this day and age. So it's not as though it's like, well, we're completely averse to giving disclosures about tokens. Actually, the market wants disclosures about tokens.
00:40:47.707 - 00:40:52.699, Speaker C: Really? You're telling me that meme coins want disclosures? Wait a minute, buddy.
00:40:52.747 - 00:40:53.731, Speaker A: Meme coins, different story.
00:40:53.803 - 00:40:54.655, Speaker C: Wait a minute.
00:40:54.985 - 00:41:16.609, Speaker A: But I think for most credible tokens that get listed on the major exchanges, like, yeah, there's expected to be some standardized disclosures like Messari, which we were just talking about. They have kind of a disclosures page about every token. It's like, here's the. Here's the issuance, here's what it does. Here's the white paper, here's the GitHub. So I get the question in my mind is like, why hasn't there been some convergence on one disclosure?
00:41:16.657 - 00:41:21.489, Speaker C: Do you know the XKCD comic that says we have 15 standards? And someone says, I'm going.
00:41:21.537 - 00:41:22.217, Speaker A: I don't think there are 15.
00:41:22.281 - 00:41:24.417, Speaker C: Yes, there are. I bet you if you go and.
00:41:24.441 - 00:41:26.609, Speaker A: Compare, like, you don't know of any.
00:41:26.697 - 00:41:29.329, Speaker C: No, if I compare what Masari considers, for instance.
00:41:29.377 - 00:41:29.769, Speaker A: Okay.
00:41:29.857 - 00:41:37.769, Speaker C: Versus what token terminal considers versus what each individual project discloses about their. The investor breakup.
00:41:37.817 - 00:41:38.065, Speaker A: Okay.
00:41:38.105 - 00:41:48.425, Speaker C: You know the pie chart two, the pie chart that every project pie chart is a meme. They just. Everyone chooses what random categories they want. There's not even an agreement on that.
00:41:48.585 - 00:42:06.047, Speaker D: I think it's more like, okay, like where is that disclosed? Sometimes it's in like the git pages or the wiki or some blof reported. Yeah. Or. And then it's like, wait, was this actually verified on chain? Not usually. And so it does feel like there could be some sort of schema or something that would, that would actually resolve this.
00:42:06.111 - 00:42:19.431, Speaker A: Yeah. I guess I wonder, like, why hasn't there been more of a push from the industry to create one disclosure standard and just be like, yo sec or whatever new law is going to. It is literally the 15th center use this one. I don't think that's true.
00:42:19.503 - 00:42:20.287, Speaker C: Totally true.
00:42:20.431 - 00:42:21.855, Speaker A: Name me one. Name me one standard.
00:42:21.935 - 00:42:47.665, Speaker C: I will give you an example. Okay, let's compare the top five proof of stake networks and their inflation curves and how they actually decide their inflation curves and how it gets distributed. How do I compare those? I compare Solana where the foundation distributes a lot of the delegates, a lot of the tokens. So it's like, okay, I now need to have the foundation disclose who all its delegates are. Which it may not want to do for security reasons when there's kind of an attack.
00:42:47.745 - 00:42:48.405, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:42:49.535 - 00:43:02.383, Speaker C: I also may need to figure out, okay, like what's actually the ratio at which the unlocks are happening for entities that have been dissolved. Like at the Alameda FTX stuff where there's OTC trading of the lock took.
00:43:02.519 - 00:43:07.719, Speaker A: There's so much fractal complexity. There's so much that's also true for equity disclosures.
00:43:07.887 - 00:43:11.743, Speaker C: Equity disclosures though are like, every company's different.
00:43:11.799 - 00:43:13.343, Speaker A: Everyone's special snowflake, everyone's business.
00:43:13.399 - 00:43:21.603, Speaker C: No, no, no, that's not true though. Right. Like if I look at all these like tech companies that IPO in the 2000 and tens and the non GAAP accounting stuff they do compared to the.
00:43:21.619 - 00:43:23.891, Speaker A: GAAP accounting, they still do non gap accounting. Bullshit.
00:43:23.923 - 00:43:31.147, Speaker C: No, no, no. But, but my point is like, I think in crypto it's even harder. Like the non GAAP part is like continuous time. Like you actually have to monitor it.
00:43:31.251 - 00:43:36.723, Speaker A: Are you claiming that the reason why this is not done is because it's fundamentally harder in crypto? Because that sounds like what you're saying.
00:43:36.899 - 00:43:39.451, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's harder because I think it's way more continuous.
00:43:39.563 - 00:43:40.635, Speaker A: Here's why it's not hard.
00:43:40.715 - 00:43:50.015, Speaker C: Here is very simple but stupid reason. Okay, which is in crypto systems there is continuous time issuance. There's new issuance all the time, right?
00:43:50.055 - 00:43:50.519, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:43:50.607 - 00:43:55.855, Speaker C: In every equity Instrument. There's fixed time, discrete issuance and there's a notion of when the supply chain.
00:43:55.935 - 00:43:57.375, Speaker A: Update your thing every quarter.
00:43:57.455 - 00:43:59.087, Speaker D: Yeah, this can't be every quarter.
00:43:59.151 - 00:44:00.143, Speaker C: This needs to be real time.
00:44:00.199 - 00:44:05.815, Speaker A: Okay, so do have the real time thing but the SEC needs something every quarter. My point, businesses are also real time.
00:44:05.895 - 00:44:11.139, Speaker C: My point though is that it's like very different when you're like changing your cap structure continuously.
00:44:11.307 - 00:44:11.659, Speaker D: Right.
00:44:11.707 - 00:44:15.531, Speaker C: That is a fundamental, unique, that is a unique thing to crypto.
00:44:15.643 - 00:44:19.291, Speaker A: That's not unique when there's. There are lots of businesses that have continual streams of income.
00:44:19.363 - 00:44:21.747, Speaker C: No, no, no. But they don't have continual equity dilution.
00:44:21.811 - 00:44:22.731, Speaker A: Yes they do.
00:44:22.883 - 00:44:33.227, Speaker C: Who give me an equity every day or give me, give me, give me an example of a company, equity company anywhere in the world that is selling equity daily.
00:44:33.371 - 00:44:34.395, Speaker A: Doesn't have to be daily.
00:44:34.515 - 00:44:49.155, Speaker D: This also does again does not seem impossible to capture in some sort of form. Like even when you're looking at your like vesting token are blocked by block, it's really just like you send in like a block number or like a timestamp and like okay, we're going to calculate how many you have at this moment in time. Like this doesn't seem impossible to me.
00:44:49.655 - 00:44:51.519, Speaker C: It's just everyone has different standards for it.
00:44:51.567 - 00:45:36.961, Speaker D: Well, okay, I think to answer your point maybe as to why a standard has not evolved, it's because there's not been market pressure. Right. Like people are not rejecting tokens that are not extremely transparent or accurate with their disclosures. The same way if you're not an ERC20 token, like you're probably not going to get integrated into all the wallets, all the exchanges can be hard to list you. And so I think the question is how do you sort of create that market pressure? I think some venues that do a decent job like I actually think Defi Llama, for example is a good job where if you want to be on Defi llama they have a little git repo, you can fork it, build your own adapter, feed them data. Great. Now everyone has the same sort of spec for like feeding data into Defi llama coingecko very similar kind of thing for what is the total number of issuance, what is the current float, et cetera.
00:45:36.961 - 00:45:41.861, Speaker D: But these are also you know, fragmented one off instances versus having something kind of more holistic.
00:45:41.933 - 00:45:44.293, Speaker B: We need like a disclosure oracle based.
00:45:44.309 - 00:45:45.781, Speaker D: On something like that.
00:45:45.813 - 00:45:48.757, Speaker A: Yeah, it just, it feels to me. So I really good idea.
00:45:48.781 - 00:45:49.021, Speaker C: I'm good.
00:45:49.053 - 00:45:52.025, Speaker B: I'm going to go and raise now 100 million, who's going to invest?
00:45:53.965 - 00:46:06.145, Speaker A: I think you're absolutely correct that the market pressure is the thing. Like, so who is the final boss for tokens that need to become more legible to people? The answer is Binance. Right? The answer is the exchanges. And the exchanges, I mean we've seen.
00:46:06.185 - 00:46:13.913, Speaker C: Some crazy percentages given out recently. Yes, yes to the final boss. Is that true? Actually, I mean it's in the docs.
00:46:14.009 - 00:46:15.177, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah.
00:46:15.201 - 00:46:17.961, Speaker A: I've heard it's like 10, 15% for some of the latest projects.
00:46:18.033 - 00:46:20.057, Speaker C: I don't know if it's that high. Scroll was like five.
00:46:20.081 - 00:46:20.193, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:46:20.209 - 00:46:21.753, Speaker D: These meaning it was like 5.5%.
00:46:21.809 - 00:46:22.529, Speaker C: Scroll was like five.
00:46:22.577 - 00:46:46.643, Speaker A: Yeah. But scroll is an eight year project for a lot of these people who are like doing launch pool and doing all this other stuff. It's like I've heard lately numbers are getting up to 15%, so it's kind of crazy. But it's very subject to your market power. Right. So if you're scroll, you can get away with a lot better than if you're Katazin or whatever. So all that is to say, I think there's a lack of coordination.
00:46:46.643 - 00:47:12.919, Speaker A: Right. If you look at the forms, so there's like a front page. If you want to say, I want to list my token on Binance or on Coinbase, there's a form and you fill out the form. And the form is also very different from Defi llama, where Defi llama is programmatic. The form you fill, it's literally like just a Google form. And the forms in a way are the closest thing that we have to a disclosures regime because you have to disclose all the stuff to the exchanges. And I guess what really feels like there should be is the exchanges coordinated together.
00:47:12.919 - 00:47:54.457, Speaker A: Do like, you know how universities have like this common application that fans out your university application to all the universities in the country. Like we need to have something like that for tokens and then that can evolve to become this disclosure regime that countries that are figuring out how to do disclosures around tokens can just say, ah, just pick this up, add one or two things to it and then cool, it's ready to go. As opposed to reinventing the wheel which you've seen all these proposals from the sec, not from the sec, but for the SEC are all kind of just super convoluted and very, very complex in a way that because they don't really, they don't really work with each other particularly well.
00:47:54.601 - 00:47:56.085, Speaker C: So 15 standards.
00:47:58.065 - 00:48:05.169, Speaker A: My claim is zero standards. My claim is. Or you Know, right now there's, there's not anybody trying to fight to make a universal standard.
00:48:05.217 - 00:48:13.545, Speaker B: I think people just, they don't want to dox themselves or like dox the amounts and like, unless there's like what you said like about like market forces just pushing people to do this.
00:48:13.585 - 00:48:18.737, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, kind of. Kind of. I mean like for something like ave or scroll or whatever, it's like, okay, it's all out there.
00:48:18.761 - 00:48:18.873, Speaker C: Every.
00:48:18.889 - 00:48:25.057, Speaker A: Everyone knows the co founders, everyone knows the amounts. They post the pie chart, you know, so. And it's like, okay, well I want to be like scroll.
00:48:25.121 - 00:48:31.241, Speaker B: We don't. The standards definitely applies to these pie charts. Like, yeah, there's no standards to the pie charts.
00:48:31.353 - 00:48:34.217, Speaker A: I mean there are. Right. When you, when you break the standards, you get yelled at.
00:48:34.361 - 00:48:41.449, Speaker C: So there are standards barely when you break the standards. I. E. My Twitters don't add up to 100%.
00:48:41.577 - 00:48:43.905, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, yes. And then I'll put it last.
00:48:43.945 - 00:48:47.271, Speaker C: And my point is there's a lot more hidden in the center sectors.
00:48:47.383 - 00:48:50.315, Speaker A: There are, but like, you know, it's also true in disclosures.
00:48:50.775 - 00:49:20.095, Speaker C: I think it's just that we've never. For boring Trad 5 people, they're just not used to the idea of continuous dilution, continuous disclosure. Like everything has always been this discreet. There are fixed intervals. You have earnings at a certain time, you have fixed dates, fixed duration. Right. Why are perpetual products and duration free products so much more popular in crypto? It's because the intrinsic asset itself is constantly changing.
00:49:20.175 - 00:49:24.223, Speaker A: I don't think this is true. Like CEOs talk to the media all the time about their company.
00:49:24.279 - 00:49:29.127, Speaker C: That is not the same as my equity assets inflating itself every day.
00:49:29.151 - 00:49:33.955, Speaker B: But you can do disclosure upon a date. So let's say like February 1st. This is the amount.
00:49:34.375 - 00:49:35.967, Speaker C: Sure. But like, I think, I just think.
00:49:35.991 - 00:49:51.643, Speaker A: This is not a difference in kind. This is just not a difference in kind. You know, there's a big dump of disclosures on a quarterly basis by companies. But there's also continuous disclosure. There's also continuous communication, also continuous repricing, continuous. There's. I mean all these things are happening on a daily basis.
00:49:51.779 - 00:49:53.611, Speaker C: It's nowhere near continuously.
00:49:53.723 - 00:49:57.355, Speaker D: We can switch to one day block times if you want instead. So we can like, you know.
00:49:57.475 - 00:50:11.515, Speaker C: Yeah, there you go. No, it's not, it's not that. That's what I'm saying. I'm saying like, I agree with you. There's some batching size, that's fine, but I think there's a lot more Nuance to how how A people think about inflation curves, B how fees are burned be how.
00:50:12.175 - 00:50:18.595, Speaker A: Let's pause here because I feel like we're going in circles a bit. But speaking of block times, there is a good segue.
00:50:19.775 - 00:50:21.063, Speaker C: What segue could that.
00:50:21.159 - 00:51:07.209, Speaker A: There is one EIP that is gaining a lot of traction right now, EIP 7781 proposed by Ben Adams, that is proposing what we were talking about on the last show, which is the make Ethereum great again of expanding, reducing the block time on Ethereum from 12 seconds to 8 seconds and expanding the amount of blobs from 6 to 9. So Justin Drake has come out in favor of this proposal claiming that actually there are a lot of positive flow through effects if you just decrease the block time. So one of those things of course is ux. But another thing is that you just get less MEV if you decrease the block times. Because that means that the block times you can think of as the exchanges are down for eight seconds at a time all the time. And if the exchanges are down for eight seconds, then that's just more arbitrage. That's more MEV, roughly 1.2
00:51:07.209 - 00:51:34.113, Speaker A: times more efficient. More efficient indexes. That would save about $100 million in sex dex arbitrage. That's an estimate from Justin Drake about how much more efficient defi on Ethereum would get by just lowering the block times just moderately from 12 seconds to 8 seconds. Of course, as always, there's concern about solo builders. Are they going to be skipping blocks? They no longer be as competitive. But it seems like now the momentum and this meme that we talked about on the show is gaining some traction.
00:51:34.113 - 00:52:07.701, Speaker A: So if you remember, I think it was last year or maybe early this year, we made a bet among the four of us on the show about whether or not Ethereum would move some of these big improvements about increasing the gas limit and lowering the block times. And I think I'm the only one who bet both increased gas limit and decreased block times. And it looks like we are now into that phase of the meta where all the big changes, you know, multiproposers, all this stuff is not happening. And the decreasing block times and increasing the gas limit seems like these are on the map.
00:52:07.733 - 00:52:09.093, Speaker B: Are they actually increasing the gas limit?
00:52:09.149 - 00:52:10.385, Speaker A: Not in the blob.
00:52:11.005 - 00:52:12.917, Speaker C: He's been taking a little liberty with his.
00:52:12.981 - 00:52:21.125, Speaker A: Well, we got there's still time, there's still time, there's still time. Be patient, there's still time. And I'd say also increasing the amount of BLOBS is kind of a backdoor, you know, that sort of thing.
00:52:21.205 - 00:52:23.133, Speaker C: Yeah, I agree, but it's still different.
00:52:23.189 - 00:52:32.195, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, look, we'll see, we'll see. So anyway, thoughts on Asani? As a Ethereum builder, how do you feel about EIP 7781?
00:52:32.235 - 00:52:33.331, Speaker D: Not a block builder, just to be clear.
00:52:33.363 - 00:52:41.419, Speaker A: Yeah, Ethereum, you know, in the Ethereum, how do you feel about make Ethereum great again vibes that we're now seeing revitalized?
00:52:41.467 - 00:53:47.941, Speaker B: Well, I think like the previous idea was that, you know, we will like Ethereum will move very slowly and a lot of the innovation will happen all too. And that's where you can experiment, do some interesting crazy things. And what has effectively happened is people are just forking like get there and like creating all these networks without much of an innovation. So I think actually innovating on L1 is the right way to do it because that's where a lot of the value is and that's basically where a lot of the baggage is actually in terms of where Ethereum could be today. I think there's a lot to do and I think this is just like a first, as you mentioned, with these two different changes. I think these are just two out of multiple many that could be done over the next few years just to make it the best execution environment. I think this is a really right direction to go, especially because we have to have an infrastructure where you can simulate similar type of trading that you have in some stock exchanges and so forth.
00:53:48.013 - 00:53:50.709, Speaker A: I mean to be clear, innovating is a strong word. I would not call this innovating.
00:53:50.797 - 00:54:00.825, Speaker B: Well, it is not, but I think they should go 100x more into this idea of. Yeah, how to improve Ethereum L1.
00:54:01.365 - 00:54:03.893, Speaker A: Are you advocating massively lowering the block times?
00:54:03.989 - 00:54:05.277, Speaker B: Not just that, but just innovating.
00:54:05.341 - 00:54:08.397, Speaker A: Not just that. So you want to also massively decrease the block times?
00:54:08.501 - 00:54:19.641, Speaker B: Well, of course. But also besides that, I think there needs to be a lot of innovation ON Ethereum in L1 as a kind of like pure like an idea like Ethereum shouldn't move slowly with changes.
00:54:19.713 - 00:54:39.581, Speaker A: So I would analogize like we've made a lot of comparisons with like this make Ethereum great again thing with like Trumpism. And I think it is kind of analogous because in my mind lowering the block time is kind of like lowering taxes. It's very easy to do juices the economy. It like obviously like in the long run, you know, you can't keep doing this forever. Like at some point you need taxes.
00:54:39.613 - 00:54:41.229, Speaker B: Same with gas increasing the gas limits.
00:54:41.277 - 00:55:05.345, Speaker A: Right, Exactly. You sort of. You kind of. You can't just lower your taxes into your way to prosperity. Eventually you have to pay the taxes back. But it sounds like you are much more of a performance maximalist on layer one. And you want to see like what kind of block time would you want to see? And how do you respond to people who say that? Well, look, the thing that makes Ethereum different is the home staking philosophy, the decentralization maximization.
00:55:05.345 - 00:55:09.031, Speaker A: If you lose that, do you not lose what makes Ethereum Ethereum?
00:55:09.183 - 00:55:43.883, Speaker B: I think we have a like decentralization is a really loaded war. It means different things to different people. And I think what's more interesting is resiliency. How Ethereum can sustain to be resilient, but at the same time can be performative in terms of infrastructure. I think that's the direction to go. And I do agree that these changes are like quick fixes, but we should go into actually architecture and think about how we architect Ethereum to be better. That's my two way reactions.
00:55:43.979 - 00:55:46.027, Speaker A: Wait, so what is the block time you would want?
00:55:46.211 - 00:55:52.051, Speaker B: Well, you will have to calculate that. It doesn't really cause issues. So there's a limit at some point.
00:55:52.083 - 00:55:56.335, Speaker A: Yeah, but I mean, what would you want? All things equal, roughly like.
00:55:58.245 - 00:55:59.669, Speaker B: 250 milliseconds.
00:55:59.757 - 00:56:04.701, Speaker A: 250 mill. That's faster than Solana. You want faster than Solana blocks on Ethereum?
00:56:04.893 - 00:56:05.693, Speaker B: Yeah, fuck it.
00:56:05.749 - 00:56:06.253, Speaker A: Yeah, fuck it.
00:56:06.269 - 00:56:09.413, Speaker C: Okay. Sonny loves Mega Eth.
00:56:09.469 - 00:56:17.701, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. To be clear, like that is faster than speed of light communication around the world. So that is a tall order of 100 milliseconds. But I like where I like.
00:56:17.733 - 00:56:21.325, Speaker B: So I do think getting it to two seconds is okay.
00:56:21.405 - 00:56:22.037, Speaker A: Two seconds?
00:56:22.141 - 00:56:27.631, Speaker B: Yeah, if it's possible and it doesn't really, you still can have a resilient infrastructure.
00:56:27.703 - 00:56:32.555, Speaker A: Okay, so absolute performance maxi. All right, what's your reaction to that?
00:56:33.215 - 00:56:53.081, Speaker C: Well, I sort of dispute the claim, the 1.2 thing, because I think that's just coming from square root of 12 over 8, which is like 1.22, which is where Justin's number comes from. Because it's not like it's actually purely monotone that you decrease the mev. There's like there is some, some amount that gets increased also.
00:56:53.153 - 00:56:53.569, Speaker A: Okay.
00:56:53.657 - 00:56:57.721, Speaker C: And so like I think this is a very important thing that there's a lot of.
00:56:57.913 - 00:57:02.049, Speaker B: Justin's a God and you know, Justin says we have to obey.
00:57:02.177 - 00:57:04.049, Speaker C: There's a lot. There's a lot of academic research on this.
00:57:04.057 - 00:57:08.881, Speaker A: There's one thing on which I will trust to ruin over Justin. And it is, you know, quantum MeV equation.
00:57:08.913 - 00:57:10.209, Speaker B: With MeV, I trust you more.
00:57:10.297 - 00:57:10.945, Speaker A: Okay.
00:57:11.105 - 00:57:15.049, Speaker C: No, I mean it's a heuristic, right, the square root thing, which is where it's coming from.
00:57:15.097 - 00:57:17.655, Speaker A: But that was a grave insult that you just gave.
00:57:18.515 - 00:57:22.495, Speaker C: I'm more interested in the blob space increases actually because.
00:57:24.475 - 00:57:26.347, Speaker A: Very briefly, can you explain what blob does?
00:57:26.371 - 00:57:26.579, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:57:26.627 - 00:57:40.139, Speaker C: So blobs are just where L2s write data to the main chain and that's sort of used as sort of temporary storage until the chains are fully valid and their transactions are validated.
00:57:40.187 - 00:57:43.535, Speaker A: So the proposal wanted to increase the amount of blobs that are available for each blob.
00:57:44.025 - 00:58:27.759, Speaker C: And so I think the idea that blobs are going up is interesting because the blob market has sort of been anemic. Like it's had a couple moments of a lot of usage and the fees going up for it, but it's been a little anemic. And so it's interesting that the question is like does expanding that, does it have a if you build it they will come type of thing where like, you know, all the OP stack chains suddenly are like, we're not going to use Celestia or Alt DA and come back or is it sort of going to be a remnant usage? And I'm kind of curious to see if the expanded blob space actually attracts some roll ups back. I'm not sure it will, but I.
00:58:27.767 - 00:58:29.515, Speaker A: Feel it's very competitive.
00:58:30.095 - 00:58:47.675, Speaker D: It was funny. I think Vitalik's justification was 75% full on blob space. I'm like, that still mean there's an oversupply of blob space, right. Only 75% is consumed. Like imagine if only like 75% of block space was consumed. You know, it's like, okay, well there's like way too much block space then.
00:58:47.975 - 00:58:53.087, Speaker A: I mean it's not way too much. Right, because there are, there's what, like seven consumers?
00:58:53.151 - 00:59:08.235, Speaker D: Yeah. But on any given block it's like, like you said, basically like anemic. So you're right that like you, you want a little bit of slack in the market so that when fees spike it's not like totally fucked. But yeah, it doesn't strike me that the market is screaming at that. Like we need more blob space right now.
00:59:08.575 - 00:59:13.635, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree. I don't totally understand why they're doing that, why that's coupled with this.
00:59:14.055 - 00:59:15.471, Speaker C: That's the weird part of the proposal.
00:59:15.543 - 01:00:11.495, Speaker A: It seems like it would make more sense to increase the gas limit because that's the actual thing that we're bumping up against, not the blob storage. The blob storage is fine and if anything I've seen a lot of comments from people in the Twitter Ethereum chorus or make Ethereum price go up of maybe we should increase the minimum cost or even lower the blob maximum because right now it's basically marginal. Pricing is zero because there's no opportunity cost. But once blob storage is full, then the reality is the willingness to pay for blob storage of the roll ups that are currently selling on Ethereum is very high. So they'd be willing to pay a lot of money to put the blobs on Ethereum but right now they have to pay nothing because there's no scarcity. So the moment that blocks are full then you actually see what is the auction going to settle at. But when blocks are not full there's no auction and Therefore everyone's paying 0 or some DE minimis price.
01:00:11.495 - 01:00:18.035, Speaker A: So I understand the point of like, well we don't want people to start paying a lot of money very soon.
01:00:18.115 - 01:00:23.979, Speaker C: Yeah, it feels a little cart before the horse prove that you need to do it. Which is the weird part of the process.
01:00:24.067 - 01:00:47.711, Speaker A: I mean I can understand the thinking of like okay, well why don't we just snuff out all the DA layers before they even have a chance to survive by just signaling that Ethereum will always remain super cheap and we won't let prices increase. Right. That could be the rationale and maybe I see that on some level. Is that okay, once we kill all the other DA layers then we allow prices to rise, but we don't let prices rise before then. So it's almost like.
01:00:47.783 - 01:00:49.463, Speaker D: But you would want to see 100%.
01:00:49.639 - 01:00:50.071, Speaker A: What's that?
01:00:50.103 - 01:00:52.127, Speaker D: I believe that's called dumping and that's illegal.
01:00:52.271 - 01:00:54.437, Speaker A: Is that dump? That's not dumping. Is that dumping?
01:00:54.511 - 01:00:55.465, Speaker D: Yeah, kind of.
01:00:55.545 - 01:00:58.145, Speaker A: No, no, no, because it's not below cost. No, it's not below cost.
01:00:58.225 - 01:00:59.885, Speaker D: I mean what is cost here?
01:01:00.665 - 01:01:03.745, Speaker A: Cost is below what the network is paying in costs. Right?
01:01:03.785 - 01:01:06.409, Speaker C: I mean I don't know what the blob costs really are.
01:01:06.457 - 01:01:14.005, Speaker A: Yeah. So you can, you can stimulate that. Right. And it's like okay, but also like it's not cheaper than Celestia, so it's not dumping. Like Celestia is even cheaper.
01:01:14.425 - 01:01:16.641, Speaker B: You know I think blobs are quite, they're quite.
01:01:16.753 - 01:01:27.671, Speaker A: Yeah, they're almost nothing. But Celestia is even more almost nothing. Right. So like strictly Celestia is cheaper. So that's not dumping. Dumping would be like I'm undercutting Celestia intentionally even though that's below my cost. Right.
01:01:27.671 - 01:01:30.795, Speaker A: But that's just pricing strategy. Pricing strategy is not dumping.
01:01:31.295 - 01:01:34.655, Speaker D: Yeah, I guess I still don't think about the cost.
01:01:34.695 - 01:01:36.423, Speaker A: Would you say Amazon was dumping before?
01:01:36.559 - 01:01:56.233, Speaker C: The only reason I would disagree with this is we're kind of talking about Ethereum blobs, which are at Ethereum block time versus Celestia and Eigenda blobs which are faster. So we have to like actually add up all the fee. I, I, I, before I, that's the interesting point, actually. I think we actually have to write out the math. I, I don't, I don't, I think both of you could have some.
01:01:56.289 - 01:01:59.265, Speaker A: Sure. But the cost is like the storage over time, right?
01:01:59.425 - 01:02:05.553, Speaker C: Yeah, but like I, we, we. If you want to make megabytes, how much you can. Yeah, exactly. We should be like looking at the total.
01:02:05.729 - 01:02:06.353, Speaker A: Sure.
01:02:06.489 - 01:02:18.705, Speaker D: Yeah. I'm, I'm also like, I feel like if anything, stuff is all kind of below cost. Right. Cause you're still having an inflationary environment. Right. Like you, you, you're paying people to store these things more than they would be just be paid by the market.
01:02:18.825 - 01:02:20.281, Speaker A: You're paying people to store these things.
01:02:20.313 - 01:02:25.125, Speaker D: Yeah. Through just like general sort of block rewards. Right. Like you still in like an inflationary environment.
01:02:27.865 - 01:02:40.313, Speaker A: Oh, I see what you're saying. Yeah, I see what you're saying. Right. So the, I mean, the cost of, the opportunity cost of including a block. Right. And then the opportunity cost of storing the stuff that has to get replicated across all the nodes.
01:02:40.369 - 01:02:45.311, Speaker D: Yeah. So I'm saying if the market, if market participants are not willingly.
01:02:45.383 - 01:03:04.255, Speaker A: Yeah. My claim though is that the inflation is a totally orthogonal cost from the cost of marginally including or not including a blob. Right. Like the inflation is getting paid either way and the inflation is security budget. Right. It's not like the marginal cost is not the fixed, that's a fixed cost.
01:03:04.295 - 01:03:11.075, Speaker D: But it also affects people's willingness to run a machine. And I guess that's part of the issue. Proof of stake. It's like what is actually like the cost of it.
01:03:11.115 - 01:03:14.011, Speaker A: Right. But my point is that nobody's turning off their machines because there's too many blobs running through it.
01:03:14.043 - 01:03:14.331, Speaker C: Sure.
01:03:14.403 - 01:03:15.843, Speaker A: You know, in which case that's, that's.
01:03:15.859 - 01:03:24.747, Speaker C: A, Right, that's actually a good point. Which is like a lot of the solar staker commentary on the blob is about the blob increase. Because they're like, oh, it's extra bandwidth for me. It's expensive.
01:03:24.891 - 01:03:25.507, Speaker A: Oh, interesting.
01:03:25.571 - 01:03:35.635, Speaker C: And that's why I think the idea that this change was like, we'll lower the latency and increase the blobs, which is the thing that was getting complained about the most, is that's what stands out to me.
01:03:35.755 - 01:03:42.733, Speaker A: Right, right. Okay. All right. Well, running up on time. And I know we got very wonky at the end about eips and blob storage and so on.
01:03:42.789 - 01:03:49.397, Speaker C: That's just because you want to win a bet. Let's be real. We all know why you made this ad.
01:03:49.461 - 01:03:54.941, Speaker A: To be clear, I think what's riding on this bet is Red Bulls. So for which I have no use.
01:03:54.973 - 01:03:57.101, Speaker C: For which I'm the only one who has a lot of utility.
01:03:57.173 - 01:04:11.363, Speaker A: Correct. I don't. I don't drink Red Bulls. But. But, Sonny, what should we be looking forward to in the AVE universe or the Avara universe? Because I know Lens is also part of the AAVE family. Avara family. What should we be excited about? And anything we should look forward to?
01:04:11.379 - 01:04:55.749, Speaker B: At Permissionless, there's a lot actually happening. So obviously there's constant innovation happening. On AAVE side, we're working on V4, which is going to be a more capital efficient version of the AAVE protocol, more risk management tools. Also, there's obviously with Avara Lens, we're working on Lens V3. And speaking of that, there's also a Validium implementation where we're actually using a da. And that's where Terence commands is interesting because something like social, where you need to push a lot of data and you don't have enough basic data with these block time intervals. So that's something interesting.
01:04:55.749 - 01:05:09.001, Speaker B: We're doing Family Wallet, which is focusing on, like, really, really nice design and experience on Ethereum that's going to launch pretty soon. That's all the products we have.
01:05:09.113 - 01:05:17.965, Speaker A: Okay, nice. And last thing I want to ask. So, unfortunately, Robert can come out because of course, he just had a kid. But.
01:05:19.745 - 01:05:23.249, Speaker C: As everyone made fun of. Made fun of you on Twitter for.
01:05:23.377 - 01:05:27.809, Speaker A: To be clear, I was. I was making a joke that he had a kid. Tie me with a bear market, which is upset.
01:05:27.897 - 01:05:28.565, Speaker C: Okay.
01:05:29.065 - 01:05:40.529, Speaker A: My question is, what is your relationship like with Robert? Are you guys like frenemies? Because of course, AAVE compound competitors. But then it's like he's moved on. You're still at the helm.
01:05:40.617 - 01:05:51.523, Speaker B: I mean, at the beginning it was weird because in somewhat like we're both building in the same kind of category. And I think a lot of people put us to kind of, like, compete with each other.
01:05:51.579 - 01:05:51.907, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:05:51.971 - 01:06:02.435, Speaker B: And I think at some point, kind of like once we actually met in real life, you know, all that kind of, like, weird tension just, like, disappeared, and we were more friendly.
01:06:02.595 - 01:06:06.027, Speaker A: And after he walked away from compound, or he was still.
01:06:06.091 - 01:06:34.877, Speaker B: No, actually, like, during. Yeah, during. I think that there's. I just think Robert is a really, really smart person, and he's, like, a really good inspiration for a lot of builders as well. He's done amazing job with compound, and he's doing now Superstate, which is really cool. And I think he's quite kind of, like, ahead of innovation. He kind of understands what's the thing that is important to focus on to get more adoption as well.
01:06:34.877 - 01:06:36.333, Speaker B: He builds cool things.
01:06:36.429 - 01:06:37.933, Speaker A: Really heartwarming note to end on.
01:06:38.029 - 01:06:38.933, Speaker D: I wish you were here.
01:06:39.029 - 01:06:41.597, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, I guess you can get invited back.
01:06:41.781 - 01:06:42.819, Speaker B: Well, thank you.
01:06:42.997 - 01:06:49.359, Speaker A: Well, you're a great crypto connoisseur. Although you're no Robert, but you're amazing your own. Right. So thanks for joining us.
01:06:49.407 - 01:06:49.831, Speaker B: Thank you.
01:06:49.903 - 01:06:51.975, Speaker A: And we'll see you all next time.
