00:00:00.170 - 00:00:16.298, Speaker A: If there's enough demand, people will make pooled models. The pooled models become much harder to police. Da da. You know, it's like the cat and mouse game keeps going on. So, like, I. I think that's where it's extremely different than web two. And that's also something where it's like purely the on chain stuff will dominate the centralized.
00:00:16.298 - 00:00:21.600, Speaker A: Because the centralized things will look like Uber. And they can shut you down, right. They could just turn off that market.
00:00:22.050 - 00:00:23.130, Speaker B: Not a dividend.
00:00:23.210 - 00:00:24.394, Speaker A: It's a tale of two Quan.
00:00:24.442 - 00:00:27.122, Speaker C: Now your. Our losses are on someone else's balance sheet.
00:00:27.186 - 00:00:29.538, Speaker B: Generally speaking, airdrops are kind of pointless anyways.
00:00:29.634 - 00:00:32.530, Speaker C: Some unnamed trading firms who are very involved.
00:00:32.610 - 00:00:35.666, Speaker A: Alec ETH is the ultimate Defi protocols.
00:00:35.698 - 00:00:37.800, Speaker B: Are the antidote to this problem.
00:00:38.570 - 00:00:54.378, Speaker C: Hello, everybody. Welcome to the chopping block. Every couple weeks, the four of us get together to give the industry insider's perspective on the crypto topics of the day. So quick intros. First, you got Tom, the Defi maven and master of memes, GM, everyone. Next, we've got Tarun the gigabrain and grandpuba at Gauntlet.
00:00:54.554 - 00:00:55.194, Speaker D: Yo.
00:00:55.322 - 00:01:00.590, Speaker C: Today we've got a special guest, Julian, the architect at Avo, formerly ribbon Finance.
00:01:00.930 - 00:01:03.780, Speaker D: Yeah, I guess I'm Robert Standin today.
00:01:06.070 - 00:01:14.238, Speaker C: You are our defi Maven today, or I guess not the cryptoconissur today. And then I'm Haseeb, the head hype man at Dragonfly.
00:01:14.334 - 00:01:17.182, Speaker A: So we're also very sick crypto. We have a very sick.
00:01:17.246 - 00:01:38.614, Speaker C: Slightly sick. Slightly sick. Not that sick, but my voice makes it sound sicker than I actually am. I want to caveat that nothing we say here is an investment advice, legal advice, or even life advice. Please see chopping block XYZ for more disclosures. So, Julian, welcome to the show. We should caveat that I think everybody here is an investor into you or into ribbon finance.
00:01:38.614 - 00:02:01.566, Speaker C: I should say we wanted to get you on because there's a lot of topics today that are kind of circulating in the crypto world that we thought you'd be the perfect guest to talk about. And we also want to get some time to talk about what you're doing with ribbon finance and Avo, because I think it's at the center of a lot of conversations that people are having right now about where DeFi is going and where crypto is going, generally.
00:02:01.758 - 00:02:02.322, Speaker D: Yeah, sure.
00:02:02.376 - 00:02:45.620, Speaker C: The big news this week that you just explained to me that you've been totally on top of is Jupiter. So for those people who don't know, I'll give the very brief background. So Jupyter is a Dex aggregator on Solana. So a Dex aggregator is essentially, you can think of it like priceline for Dexes. So essentially it looks across all different Dexes and tries to find the best price, best execution, and it does fancy routing in order to give you the best possible price for whatever you want to buy. So one inch is which we are investors is the equivalent of this on Ethereum. Jupiter is know they didn't take any VC backing and people have been very excited about Jupiter because they were doing a point system.
00:02:47.430 - 00:02:54.340, Speaker A: They did technically take VC for one project. Right. One of the coins did raise money. Yes.
00:02:54.710 - 00:02:57.494, Speaker C: Prior project, you was like, it used.
00:02:57.532 - 00:03:01.510, Speaker D: To be like curve on Solana, basically last cycle.
00:03:02.010 - 00:03:03.560, Speaker C: Oh, I see. Was it.
00:03:04.570 - 00:03:07.974, Speaker A: No, no, Saber was the twins or the brothers. Sorry?
00:03:08.092 - 00:03:28.794, Speaker C: Oh, the McCullough brothers, that's right. Okay, got it. So they were doing a separate, okay. So they did something in the past that raised VC capital. Jupiter had no VC investors. So they had a very highly anticipated airdrop after their point system. And basically we saw the day of their airdrop huge amounts of activity.
00:03:28.794 - 00:04:15.546, Speaker C: I think it crossed over a billion dollars in daily volume several days leading up to the airdrop, which is very anticipated. They actually flipped uniswap V four for volume, and Salana on certain days actually superseded Ethereum DFI generally for volume. The airdrop finally took place on February 1 and we saw huge amounts of capital. Some people, I think it was about, let me see here. They rewarded about 10% of the supply to about a million wallets that were active on the Dex aggregator before November 2. Today the token is circulating about $0.60, which would imply a fully diluted valuation of 6 billion, which would make them worth more than uniswap on a fully diluted basis.
00:04:15.546 - 00:04:46.466, Speaker C: However, there's a lot of controversy around exactly how the airdrop took place. So despite the fact that some people got $40,000 worth of Jupiter tokens on the airdrop, there's a lot of controversy about the way in which the team sold some of their tokens or maybe sold some of their tokens during this airdrop. Julie. So I couldn't understand it because there's a lot of people flinging around accusations on Twitter and it seems a little bit esoteric to me. Julian, can you walk us through what the hell happened here and how do you think about it? Personally?
00:04:46.578 - 00:05:25.090, Speaker D: Yeah, this is what they call like an LBP on Ethereum. Basically. You can think of it as like a unisop v three position but it's one sided. So they don't post USDC and Jup tokens, they just post Jup tokens. And the range they had the Jupe tokens was between thirty five cents and seventy cents or 69 or something. And basically what this means is once the price crosses 69, the whole lp position would be fully in USDC and it would be about 150 mil of USDC. So I think that was sort of expected.
00:05:25.090 - 00:06:09.758, Speaker D: The team sort of mentioned that this gives users or traders the ability to sell back into the pool, is sort of like good for traders and price discovery from their perspective. But I think what caused the uproar is a lot of users didn't read the fine print, which was the team's going to remove the lp position in like three days. So they actually extended that to seven days. But I think that sort of created all the drama where people just actually realized yesterday that, oh, if the price stays above seventy cents, the team's going to withdraw 150 mil of cash in a week. So I think that was sort of like the main cause for drama.
00:06:09.854 - 00:06:15.710, Speaker C: And how do you feel about it? Do you feel like that's a fair criticism? Do you feel like, hey, they were transparent, they said this from day one.
00:06:15.880 - 00:07:09.042, Speaker D: I think they were pretty transparent, to be honest. I think they sort of masked some of the terminology with new words that they came up with, like an open market auction and stuff like that, as people usually do. So maybe some people were somewhat confused, but I kind of understood it pretty early on. So I felt like they didn't actually change anything last minute, which I would consider rug. In fact, they actually increased how long the lp position would be in the pool for from three days to seven days. So, I mean, I think anyone who actually understands Defi and read the fine print would have followed it. I think my main criticism is actually pretty hard to find this information because the founder just writes these blog posts on Twitter.
00:07:09.042 - 00:07:15.080, Speaker D: So it's just like these super long Twitter posts, and if you don't read them, you can't really find the information.
00:07:17.530 - 00:08:02.534, Speaker A: Yeah, I would say I agree with that description. I think they were actually in some ways extremely descriptive of this. And I think a lot of people who are complaining were really just complaining because they were hoping that everything would have been written in the language that they understood immediately. And I feel like they didn't really read the fine print and or they didn't get an airdrop, so they somehow were pissed in some weird way. But I feel like if you've watched, I mean, you have to be a little bit mentally insane to have watched all the content that Mr. Meow produced. I mean, that motherfucker was streaming 24/7 for like, the last.
00:08:02.534 - 00:08:39.554, Speaker A: It's like watching a live stream from him for like a week. But I think he did say everything multiple times. He just kind of said it in weird formats. But also, I think one thing that maybe I wouldn't have done, even though I know there was a reason they wanted to do this, was they launched all these meme coins beforehand that confused people even more. But I don't want to confuse our listeners with that because that is another very deep rabbit hole that I think you probably just want to watch the live streams or watch them on five X to try to get.
00:08:39.672 - 00:08:41.810, Speaker C: Wait, so literally live streams?
00:08:42.710 - 00:08:44.820, Speaker A: Meow's live streams are crazy.
00:08:46.630 - 00:08:49.438, Speaker C: Okay, what does he live stream?
00:08:49.614 - 00:09:04.474, Speaker D: No, I mean, he's not like a streamer, but leading up to the event, he basically just said like, fuck it, I'm going to go live and just talk through the whole LBP process. I was one of the few hundred people watching it, so I guess I.
00:09:04.512 - 00:09:08.106, Speaker C: Understood it pretty well. Yeah, I see.
00:09:08.208 - 00:09:08.874, Speaker D: But, yeah.
00:09:08.992 - 00:09:09.994, Speaker C: Is he doxed or.
00:09:10.032 - 00:09:29.300, Speaker D: No, no, he's a public guy. Yeah, he's completely doxed. I think he actually explained it pretty fairly. It's just like, if you didn't really read or watch these hours of content, maybe you would have missed the fact that they were going to withdraw, like the LP or something.
00:09:30.390 - 00:09:40.962, Speaker A: Yeah. All of this suggests that someone needs to train a Solana to ETH person language model to convert all this Solana content to ETH people language like translator.
00:09:41.106 - 00:09:43.720, Speaker C: Right. Tom, what's your take on?
00:09:44.890 - 00:10:21.298, Speaker B: I mean, I don't like, I think there's maybe the component around transparency. The other point, too is people's got, know, tens of millions of dollars, and they're upset that the team is providing liquidity and maybe also taking some liquidity for themselves that they're not having, raising any money. I feel like no matter what you do with airdrops, people are always going to be upset and they always want more, even though they're always getting free money. And so I think this kind of comes back to the point around, like, you get this great sort of press moment out of it, but to an extent, there's always going to be people who are dissatisfied with some component of it.
00:10:21.384 - 00:11:02.190, Speaker D: Yeah, I think the dissatisfaction usually comes if there's not, like an immediate price pump on the first day, which a lot of people who may have missed the airdrop, they're probably betting that, oh, maybe it'll still go up. They're trying to trade the event. So I think if the event is like a nothing burger or it just goes down, suddenly all these people get mad. We've seen this. So many think, you know, like for Jupiter especially, I feel like a lot of the price discovery actually happened in these pre markets, which maybe you'll speak about, like the actual day one launch was pretty boring. It was not exciting at all.
00:11:02.340 - 00:11:05.220, Speaker A: It's a great transition to talk about Avo, actually.
00:11:07.110 - 00:11:51.642, Speaker C: Yeah. So one of the interesting parts of the story was the price discovery that started taking place before Jupiter actually launched. Because Avo, which is the product that was launched by originally ribbon Finance, Avo actually listed, I guess, futures for Jupiter before it launched. And I think at the time, the pricing on the futures was pretty in line with where the token originally came out. Talk us through how you think about launching derivatives of assets that don't yet exist. I remember back in the day there were a few exchanges that started, like centralized exchanges that started doing this. Very interesting to see this happening in Defi.
00:11:51.642 - 00:11:54.090, Speaker C: I'd love Coinflex and strategy.
00:11:54.250 - 00:11:55.226, Speaker A: Do you remember Coinflex?
00:11:55.258 - 00:12:02.242, Speaker C: There was a few others. There was a few others, yeah. There's some chinese exchanges that also used to do that a lot. I'm curious. Yeah, talk us through it.
00:12:02.296 - 00:12:41.214, Speaker D: Some of them still do it today. I think Kucoin is one of the bigger ones, but I mean, they kind of rip users off with the fees, like 5% or 2% or something just for one trade. So it's really expensive. There's like physical delivery of coins. It's pretty sort of annoying to use, I think. And yeah, I think one of the ones that we got inspiration from was like the FTX Coinbase market, which was like they actually listed a Coinbase perp before Coinbase ipoed, which is really interesting. And I think liquidity was really bad and I don't think any serious people are trading there.
00:12:41.214 - 00:13:43.298, Speaker D: But it was still like an interesting market. It's more akin to, I would say, like a prediction market compared to an actual future. So the type of people who want to trade these things are more of prediction market style speculators compared to actual people who want to trade the stock. But yeah, we started working on this maybe six months ago. I think the original idea was it came out of this binance launch pool. So binance, maybe six months ago announced they were going to launch, say, which was like a pretty anticipated coin. And within our office we were all just guessing oh, do we think say is going to launch at a billion or like 2 billion and we're just making a market just casually? I think someone just had a crazy idea, like, oh, what if we just made a market on Avo itself for this? Instead of just betting P to p, what if you could just list some sort of market? So, yeah, we kind of just did that.
00:13:43.298 - 00:14:37.574, Speaker D: And I think the core idea was like, what if people could trade this? And when the token actually launches, we actually input like an index price, so it'll start converging onto the actual price of the token because of the funding rate. So it kind of is like this future, but it doesn't deliver on the day itself. It kind of gently transitions into a regular perp through the funding rate when the actual token is launched. But before the token launches, there's this whole long period where people are just trading this weird thing like no one actually knows what the price is. It's kind of completely dislocated from anything. So it becomes a very interesting thing to trade as well. So, yeah, Jupiter was obviously one of the most anticipated launches in the last few months.
00:14:37.574 - 00:15:20.098, Speaker D: We made a market for it in December and when we first started this market, it was only trading at a billion. And then over the month, like Solana and Jupiter got super hyped. The market started trading all the way up to like 8 billion. And over the last week it sort of came down all the way to 4 billion and then it kind of settled at six. So, yeah, I think, interestingly, a lot of people were trading this market. It was like our biggest prelaunch market by far, quite a few mil of open interest. So I actually do think a lot of price discovery happens on these things.
00:15:20.098 - 00:15:50.620, Speaker D: Interestingly, one of the most interesting phenomenon that I've seen is there are all these YouTube videos and tutorials on YouTube of how do I hedge my airdrop on Avo? Because if you know that Jupiter is giving you 200 tokens in a month, I can go to Avo and just sell it now and lock in the price. So that has become one of the interesting primary use cases of these markets. All these industrial level airdrop farmers can kind of lock in a.
00:15:53.330 - 00:16:31.020, Speaker A: So actually, a very funny thing I've observed recently, and I won't name names, but I've heard some larger fund investors who have literally indexed how they were valuing a private company like pre token based on the Avo price. So they were like, here are the comps avo prices of their pre token launch. And so we're going to value this round of this other pre launch earlier than that prelaunch token at some multiple times the avo price. So I feel like that is if there is a sign of success, it's like private market.
00:16:33.710 - 00:16:42.750, Speaker B: Would you rather trust like a million dollars in actual secondary, physically delivered saps, or would you rather trust 10 million open interest in Avo?
00:16:43.970 - 00:17:01.630, Speaker A: I agree. But, for instance, there's a lot of incentive for the team to go trade the comps and push the comps price up so that their valuation goes up. Right. It's kind of the thing where the private market investors have to be kind of a little bit cautious.
00:17:01.710 - 00:17:05.060, Speaker C: Prediction markets solve this. Prediction markets solve this on their own.
00:17:06.470 - 00:17:06.834, Speaker A: Sure.
00:17:06.872 - 00:17:24.346, Speaker C: But it's interesting. I love this idea, Julian, that to be clear, yes. Obviously, relative to a team that wants to really push up their market comps, which it's funny to imagine that that's the reason why the perps on your.
00:17:24.448 - 00:17:33.066, Speaker A: I will say that this private investor didn't even think about this when I mentioned that. Oh, well, what if the team did this? They're like, wait a minute, I have to go back and look.
00:17:33.168 - 00:17:37.280, Speaker C: Right? I mean, to be clear, you could also do this on SAfs, right? Like, if you want to go buy.
00:17:39.090 - 00:17:45.280, Speaker A: I think it's funny that someone was investing and didn't even think that this would be an adverse selection type of thing against.
00:17:45.990 - 00:18:28.670, Speaker C: Sure. So what's interesting, I really like this idea of airdrop farmers hedging their price risk. Right. And we should maybe talk a little bit about what this means. And this ties into one of the next things I want to discuss, which is points and airdrops generally, because it's been a big theme, especially of what's happening in Solana, given how many projects on Solana are courting users with airdrops or point systems. So an airdrop farmer, for those who are not familiar, airdrops are when a protocol basically rewards users of the protocol, or people are doing some kind of work for the protocol with tokens. And we've seen these things called airdrop farmers, which are basically people who are more or less gaming the system.
00:18:28.670 - 00:18:57.826, Speaker C: They're kind of inorganically pretending to do things that users are supposed to be doing in order to try to make money from the protocol. That's kind of giving away these incentives to users. So if you sort of imagine the person who creates multiple uber accounts and refers their own accounts, that's a real world equivalent of what airdrop farmers are doing. But in crypto, nobody can tell you're a dog, as the old joke goes. And so it's not very easy to actually figure out who's a real user and who's kind of a quote unquote airdrop farmer, unless there are certain signatures.
00:18:57.858 - 00:19:04.886, Speaker A: That, look, by the way, you know, the same thing is true for every ecommerce platform. There is tons of fake volume generators.
00:19:04.918 - 00:20:19.700, Speaker C: Of course, but people generally use phone verification in order to deduplicate people and stuff like that, every kind of referral scheme. Oh, of course, I used to work in antifraud, so I know very well how many people try to game these systems, especially outside of the US, where the relative incentive to game these referral systems is extremely high. So the interesting thing is that, okay, so there's these industrial airdrop farmers. We can't really call them hedge funds, because I don't think you can do it at the scale of tens of millions of dollars, but probably in single digit millions you can make by doing this kind of industrial airdrop farming, quote unquote. The interesting thing is that there's another protocol called Pendle, which has also gotten a huge surge in popularity, specifically because people who are farming points on eigen layer are using it to hedge their eigen layer points. So, essentially, Pendle, my understanding is that allows you to take your future yield, package it up, and sell it to somebody else, which is essentially not just your future yield, but also your future airdrop on eigen layer. And so essentially, it's become like this pre launch market for eigen layer and valuing your Eigen layer points.
00:20:19.700 - 00:20:59.774, Speaker C: And so the market is kind of finding all these weird little ways to be able to give financial products and, like hedging products to these industrial airdrop farmers. And it's becoming quite a big business. So I find this fascinating, the way in which people are finding markets where they otherwise, like Pendle, before Eigen layer took off or not took off, started getting lots of TVL. Let's say Pendle was kind of floundering in terms of product demand, but they've kind of found their one thing that seems to really be working for the protocol. So I'm curious to get the perspective from you guys. So, first up, the rise of points. We talked before about points.
00:20:59.774 - 00:21:05.746, Speaker C: I think, Tarun, you mentioned that points was the biggest innovation that you thought you've seen in, or the best new.
00:21:05.768 - 00:21:11.780, Speaker A: Innovation for this year. Let's just say it's the innovation that attracted people back.
00:21:12.790 - 00:21:43.526, Speaker C: Sure, it's worked incredibly well. And points are connected to airdrops, but they're not the same as airdrops, right? Let me ask you this. How would you define the difference between airdropping tokens, which was the meta for a very long time? Hayden, the founder of Uniswap, infamous for having done the sort of airdrop heard around the world, one of the biggest airdrops in history, he's been very critical of points. How would you describe the difference between airdrops and points, and how points are different from just pure vanilla airdrops?
00:21:43.638 - 00:22:52.686, Speaker A: So one very important difference is that airdrops generally have a fixed criteria that is verifiable on chain for when you can claim. So that basically means like, hey, did I use the product for a certain amount of time? I did some set of actions, and then based on those actions, the protocol codifies that in smart contract, such as a Merkel distributor or different type of distributor, to allow you to claim your tokens. Points, however, are sort of arbitrary insofar that as they're realistically at the discretion of the team, they're not actually converted to real tokens. There's like, oh, you do some actions, you get these points and they may convert to tokens later. Right? So the examples of those are Jupiter, Jito, et cetera, that had a lot of these types of, and of course eigenlearn being the biggest one. Now, I think the beauty of crypto is that there's this inevitable thing where there will be the avo for points. There's already like whales market, which lets you do p to p points trading.
00:22:52.686 - 00:24:02.282, Speaker A: And obviously once there's enough liquidity in that, people will make a prediction like market, whether it looks like Avo, whether it's more like a prediction market for trading these types of things. The difference is that there's still some discretion in how the points turn into tokens on the team. And so that's the place that I think most of the criticism is that the teams are holding at now. I think there's a way to view this in the dialectic. There's like the positive, right, which is like the point systems allow developers of protocols to see which actions people are doing, and then over time, sort of almost like an A B test experiment, kind of get users to do actions that are more beneficial to the protocol's long term health than just like add liquidity, get tokens, remove liquidity, right. That was sort of the old game that existed. So it actually allows for, basically, in my mind, the best case scenario is protocol developers get to use their users as QA testers, and points are a way of really flushing that out.
00:24:02.282 - 00:24:51.226, Speaker A: That's the best case scenario. The worst case scenario is that the team just kind of rugs the users or changes the criteria, and then the users are like, what the fuck? We committed our capital. I think the key thing is a little bit like what happens in ecommerce marketplace optimization. You kind of have to kind of gently do these changes. You can't do them very abruptly because obviously that will lose user trust. But I do think there's sort of like, having the right types of commitments from these teams is quite important. I just generally think, though, the beauty of permissionless finance is that someone will make the prediction market, and all of a sudden your points thing won't be this thing that's in the control of the team of.
00:24:51.328 - 00:25:34.854, Speaker B: When we talk about futures and hedging, I'm always reminded of this is kind of a famous story of how Radalio helped McDonald's hedge like corn and soy futures to be able to create chicken nuggets. And so I'm kind of like, this feels kind of like the chicken nuggets of, I guess, like crypto futures, and that they allow sort of industrial air farming or airdrop farming and points farming to exist, and that people can now maybe effectively hedge or calculate the rewards without having to be subject to this volatility. But I don't know if that's really kind of the outcome or the good thing that we want. Chicken nuggets are great. I don't know if airdrop farming is actually good for users or protocols or the ecosystem in general.
00:25:35.052 - 00:25:37.526, Speaker A: You could argue both are equally bad for your health.
00:25:37.628 - 00:25:38.600, Speaker B: You could.
00:25:39.690 - 00:25:47.322, Speaker A: One involves you sitting, clicking all day in front of a computer, and the other one, you know, the McDonald's chicken nugget, which is famously bad.
00:25:47.376 - 00:25:51.914, Speaker C: I mean, I assume a lot of it is automated if you're doing this at scale, but, yes, I'm sure there's also. Sure.
00:25:51.952 - 00:25:56.986, Speaker A: But you have to keep reprogramming when they change the rules on the points. Right. It's not like it's.
00:25:57.018 - 00:26:11.582, Speaker C: Sure. Yeah. You have to keep watching these live streams. Apparently so, yeah, exactly. Yeah. So, Julian, you guys have intentionally not done a point system in Avo. And so you guys originally ribbon finance.
00:26:11.582 - 00:26:19.442, Speaker C: You're launching a new product called avo. You'rebranding the token. Talk us through. Why did you decide to do that? Points seem to be the meta. Why are you guys not doing the meta?
00:26:19.586 - 00:27:24.474, Speaker D: Yeah, so I agree a lot with what Tarin just said. That's like a positive and negative in terms of the positive, the team gets to iterate on how the rewards are given out. Some ambiguity is sort of left on the table so that the team can still change things. If some sort of user behavior is really getting skewed because the criteria is not set up in the right place, team can sort of shift it over time. But I do think in the last few months maybe the pendulum has swung in the other direction where teams obviously know that currently airdrops are kind of this hot meta and anyone who announces an airdrop will sort of attract a bunch of people. And I think the pernicious part about points is they can sort of just dangle this criteria in front of you and decide to just not give you anything because ultimately they control what the conversion of points to tokens are. That's sort of like the weapon that they have.
00:27:24.474 - 00:28:19.340, Speaker D: So yeah, I think currently in the points meta, everyone's trying to do this calculate the meta game is really just like, okay, I know how many points I'm going to get, but the second game that they're playing is how many points do we think is going to convert to tokens. So there are really two sides of that game. And I think one phrase that I've been seeing on Twitter recently is like the farmers are getting farmed. So teams are sort of attracting all this TVL by dangling some point reward, but eventually they just decide to give the farmers nothing. So I think that sort of creates a very bad taste in people's mouth. I think it's just very tempting, right? Like if you have the ability to, you already have the TBL, you don't need to give the tokens at that point. So it is very tempting for the team.
00:28:19.340 - 00:29:14.460, Speaker D: But yeah, I do think the pendulum is starting to shift away from it. I think people are like, this two level game also creates a lot of mental fatigue in terms of you need to think about how I'm actually farming the airdrop, which is like how I'm getting points, and you need to sort of try and reason about whether the team is going to give you some amount tokens. So yeah, I think we just feel like the classic airdrop liquidity mining style thing actually works pretty well. The criteria is clear up front on how you're getting these tokens. You know, you're getting X amount of tokens, you can value it. And I mean, with the rise of all these financialization of points, it's kind of the same thing anyway. If you know it's going to be the same thing, why go through all these hoops? I think something simple actually feels better and works better for everyone.
00:29:14.460 - 00:29:17.102, Speaker D: So I think we are just going to do that instead.
00:29:17.236 - 00:30:25.510, Speaker A: On the other hand, I will say one thing is there is an analog of these point systems in normal finance that's not like credit card points or something, but that is the pre IPO equity sales, where right before a company IPOs, oftentimes what they'll do is they'll sell in advance at a discount or undetermined floating discount, sometimes some fraction of their stock prior to IPO, so that they have some guaranteed liquidity on day one. And usually those people are kind of like holding for a year and they have some kind of discount rights. And if the IPO doesn't happen, then they get paid back in some way. Partially. And in some ways, these point systems just feel like an almost more algorithmic version of the pre IPO to IPO conversion market. And I just think because crypto is crazy, you have all these amazing prediction markets that show up almost instantly for how much eigenvalue point is worth. Actually, the eigenvalue point market is one of the funnier point markets that you can see.
00:30:25.510 - 00:30:42.282, Speaker A: The spread in people's pricing is insane. It truly is amazing to look at how a market can start with so much uncertainty and then over time kind of converge. It's such a beautiful thing to watch.
00:30:42.416 - 00:31:17.906, Speaker B: It's funny. The other analog, I guess, to the pre IPO market is that there's also this weird pricing game where you actually don't want to hit the exact market clearing price when you're pricing your company, you want a small pop on IPO day, which is kind of like the same as like token launch, which actually means you left value on the table, but it sort of makes everybody feel good to see the number go up, even though it means you sold for under market and was probably not the right decision. So it's like airdrop farmers also want to see the token go up, even though maybe they're selling into it, or maybe the team is leaving money on the table.
00:31:18.018 - 00:32:19.160, Speaker C: Yeah, it's funny. I tend to think that despite the points that you made, Julian, I tend to think that points are, you made the point that they're less transparent. I think that is in some ways to the benefit of the protocol, because once things are completely transparent, then it is a pure financial calculation. And there's clearly something about people that Jupiter team is going to continue to do points, and they're going to continue to basically create more and more incentives and airdrop more tokens over time. But somehow I think we all know that nobody's ever going to care nearly as much as they will about this initial airdrop, not just because of the scale. Like maybe they'll do a one that's even bigger scale, possibly. One can imagine that, but people aren't going to care to anywhere near the same extent the spotlight effect is going to be, much less because of the fact that there's so much uncertainty about what the initial airdrop is going to look like and feel like and what the story is going to be.
00:32:19.160 - 00:33:15.802, Speaker C: And the same thing is true for almost all of the liquidity mining programs that have been done by. Even if you think of D five V one protocols that initially did liquidity mining or continuing to experiment with liquidity mining, the big stories was the first time they did it and what the token came out at and how it floated and blah, blah, blah. And that's when the TVL was, you saw the most craziness. And so there is something about the uncertainty and just like, the really, the massive volatility that attracts people, creates storylines, gets people's imaginations really going. And then once it's a, okay, well, here's how much the comp emissions are, and here's how it changes your da da da. And you just do the math on a spreadsheet and you decide how much liquidity to add. Based on this incentive, it does lose some of that magic that I think points hold on to for quite a bit longer now.
00:33:15.802 - 00:33:20.566, Speaker C: Maybe it's just a function of the token floating the first time and the second time you do it. Second points program. Nobody cares.
00:33:20.598 - 00:33:32.206, Speaker A: Haseeb, are you telling us that you really need to go to an amusement park and go on a roller coaster and just get a thrill again? Because that's what you're saying. You're like, you want the thrill back. Yeah, you want the thrill back.
00:33:32.308 - 00:34:26.086, Speaker C: I'm not an airdrop farmer, so I'm not talking about myself. I'm talking about, it is very clear the level of engagement when you make people not know. I mean, it's like, why do people enjoy, I don't know, a pretty bad example. I knew a lot of guys when I was a professional poker player who were low stakes grinders, right? And they would play poker and they would grind out, making like $10 an hour or $15 an hour, but they would hate working at McDonald's. And McDonald's, I don't know, like, some jobs at McDonald's actually pay more than that. But there's something about the uncertainty and the risk and whatever, it's like, oh, my God, I'm making my money doing this cool thing that really captivates people, but if you make it very clear to them, here's how much money you're making per hour, and it's exactly this, every single hour, and there's no uncertainty and there's no risk. People are like, I don't know, it's not as fun to do that as to bound myself up with the uncertainty.
00:34:26.086 - 00:34:30.238, Speaker C: Even if sometimes I get rugged, people seem to enjoy it more. I think it's just part of human nature.
00:34:30.334 - 00:35:18.180, Speaker D: What if, like I told you that the trend of people feeling like they get rugged keeps increasing over time, and I think that is going to happen and there's going to be a new disappointment every single month and I think that will kind of change the matter again. So I just feel like at some points, maybe I'm a bit early on this, but if you say you're launching a points program, it's kind of the same thing as saying, we are just going to screw you over later. So I do agree with your point, but I do think there's going to be a strong trend towards these things, disappointing to the downside for most users, and that would basically kind of kill the airdrop. Maybe that's for the better, actually.
00:35:19.270 - 00:36:19.694, Speaker C: I thought this was going to happen years ago, but it hasn't happened. Points are very strange because it should be a gigantic prisoner's dilemma, which is that you let everybody else create this norm that you launch points and then when the points system is finally done, you give this big, juicy airdrop and you make everyone happy. And you would think that everybody's individual incentive is to defect and basically hide people up and make them think they're going to do this massive airdrop and then do a tiny little nothing airdrop but get all the usage anyway, get all the TVL, get all the trading volume anyway, because you're sort of retroactively rewarding people, which shouldn't work from a game theory perspective, that should not work. That should be just an unsustainable equilibrium. And it's been like years now, and it just keeps working because people are afraid of getting yelled at on Twitter. And when you see people defect and they don't do the thing, they don't give a juicy enough airdrop. People on Twitter yell at them for about ten minutes and the team immediately folds.
00:36:19.694 - 00:36:33.434, Speaker C: They're just immediately like, oh, my God, I'm so sorry. We clearly miscalibrated. We're going to go back to the drawing board. Our sincere apologies. We didn't realize how much the community has given us. And they go back and they revise the airdrop and they do a bigger one every fucking time. Every fucking time this happens.
00:36:33.434 - 00:36:45.626, Speaker C: And it amazes me because, of course, these airdrop farmers are overwhelmingly not their actual users. These are mostly non sticky users who don't really care about their products, and they leave as soon as they get their airdrop.
00:36:45.658 - 00:37:38.734, Speaker B: Yeah, I was going to say the people who are disappointed are the people you don't want. Right. It's like in intrinsic web two world, the more incentives and the more affiliates and the more referrals you give out, the less sticky, the less these people spend, the worse these users are. And so it's really hard to replicate organic users who find your product organically or through word of mouth, and they just love it and they're sticky. And so it feels like that was sort of the initial idea of liquidity mining, is it's this small subsidy to kind of get people in the door, and instead it's turned into like, we're just going to attract all these basically toxic users who are sort of net negative for the product or aren't actually going to retain and pay them, then they're going to leave as soon as they're not getting paid enough. And it's like these are people you'd even want in the first place, unless they're contributing some sort of massive value to the ecosystem, which doesn't really seem like they are.
00:37:38.772 - 00:37:55.140, Speaker C: Well, the counterargument many people make is that, well, airdrops are not really about users or retention or whatever. They're really about distribution of the token. And so you're just finding a way to decentralize the token and whatever. These assholes are good. They're just as good as anyone.
00:37:56.310 - 00:38:39.986, Speaker B: So I give a talk on sort of airdrop stuff at this Aptos summit recently, and I brought in this research from Jack Hawthorne, I think, who works at variant. One of the interesting bits was obviously there was this analysis of people who received airdrops from Uniswap and one inch and things like that. And what did they do? By and large, like a year in like 90, 95% of them had already sold the token. Not super surprising. The interesting part was people who bought the tokens from those airdrop sellers were more engaged in governance. They held the token longer because they were actually putting their own capital and time into the token. They were therefore more engaged and more invested in it.
00:38:39.986 - 00:38:48.440, Speaker B: And so, yeah, maybe it distributes it to a larger number of addresses. But these are not necessarily the addresses that are going to be your core user base and your core fan base.
00:38:49.290 - 00:39:36.440, Speaker D: To your point, it also does seem like the ICOs are making a bit of a comeback. Again, I don't know if you have seen, but there are these new protocols launching. There's one that launched yesterday which got a lot of hype, but basically their whole branding and tagline is about making ICOs great again. So I do think there's some nostalgia or maybe, I don't know, we're just like running back 2017 concepts again. But yeah, maybe this Jupiter thing where effectively they did do a big public sale of the token through this lbp thing. But yeah, maybe there's going to be a sort of revenge of the ICO this cycle. I don't know.
00:39:38.250 - 00:39:39.000, Speaker C: American?
00:39:40.650 - 00:39:42.760, Speaker D: No, he's based in Singapore. As.
00:39:47.610 - 00:40:30.498, Speaker A: You know. Like I said, I think there's ways to use point systems kind of positively to stress test things, especially if it's like to stress test how people will use stuff. So I think the Eigen layer point system stuff is actually the most interesting experiment to me, because all of these liquid restaking protocols, which are technically adding a lot of risk in some ways, because a lot of them are levered via things like Pendle, and they're levered in weird ways. So right now you don't necessarily see that risk because things are trading at par. There's not like some kind of deviation. They're not supposed to be pegged assets, but they trade in some range. And so that's why these things seem to be somewhat stable.
00:40:30.498 - 00:41:19.320, Speaker A: But I think the interesting thing, right, is like, this is actually, before there's a lot of Avs, you're actually stress testing the stuff that people are building on top. And what they're doing is they're adding their own point system. And so now you're getting these not so great users from a revenue retention or stickiness perspective to basically qa whether something will blow up for you before you're live. And I actually think that's a very interesting use case of this type of stuff. Now, as I said, you can tell from the points, market pricing, no one agrees on what the value of an eigenvaler point is right now. It's like the variance is insane. And so I think that in and of itself means you get more reps of qaing is the wrong.
00:41:19.320 - 00:41:33.820, Speaker A: It's like somewhere in between stress testing and. And like, I actually think there's some protocols that are new technology where that's actually a huge positive versus finding out when your token's live.
00:41:34.430 - 00:41:43.760, Speaker C: Well, I guess I don't understand for eigen layer in particular how it's qaing and not just making it a bigger honeypot because what is there to qa right now?
00:41:44.130 - 00:41:52.570, Speaker A: Well, I mean, how stable these LRTs are, right? Like do they have this huge aggregation effect or will they compete with each other so that you relatively.
00:41:52.650 - 00:41:54.240, Speaker C: But that's like downstream of.
00:41:54.770 - 00:42:18.006, Speaker A: Right, but that impacts the security. That impacts the security of the. Yeah, but it impacts the security of that. Right. So it's actually a way of seeing what happens with things that aren't in your control. Right. Protocols built on top of you are driving volume and you're able to see this kind of interaction effect that you might not have predicted when you're trying to build your new thing.
00:42:18.006 - 00:42:27.994, Speaker A: So I think there's a world in which that type of stuff is like incentivized QA testing. It's like somewhere in between incentivized Testnet and like a live.
00:42:28.112 - 00:42:32.640, Speaker B: You're getting baited, but you're getting paid to be baited. And so it all works out.
00:42:35.410 - 00:42:48.260, Speaker A: I'm sure this is like getting catfished, but then turning out to like the person. Have you become friends? I don't know. I'm trying to find some analogy, but I don't have.
00:42:52.150 - 00:42:53.918, Speaker C: That sounds like a great romantic comedy.
00:42:54.014 - 00:43:07.378, Speaker D: I don't know if you guys have seen for some of these social base points system like Frontech, there's this whole rise of this three, three thing. Have you guys seen that? I think that's like one of the most interesting phenomenon.
00:43:07.474 - 00:43:08.534, Speaker C: What is this?
00:43:08.732 - 00:43:44.542, Speaker D: So basically frontech and maybe blast and a few other protocols, they give you extra points if you refer other people. So there's this virality component to it. Like how many people can you bring in? Gives you some sort of multiplier. So there are these informal groups of people. They're not even dows, they're just like Twitter people. And basically they just make an upfront commitment saying, if you use my ref link, I'm going to give you back like 50% later. I'm going to give the bonus that I got from the protocol to just send it back to your wallet.
00:43:44.542 - 00:44:20.702, Speaker D: And there are all these accounts now which are just like zero X CBB or whatever is one of the most famous ones. Basically he has like an extremely massive blast group of people using his ref link because he has made this commitment to give it all back or to give half of it back. So, yeah, it's like a very interesting coordination between people. I think maybe at some point someone's going to codify this into a protocol or some sort of smart contract way of distributing the points. But, yeah, it is very interesting to see how.
00:44:20.756 - 00:44:40.486, Speaker C: Well, okay, so this is one of the advantages of points, though, is that points are revocable. Right. It's not a hard commitment in a way, that you're talking about how. The nice thing about airdrops is they're totally transparent. The rules are set up in advance. The whole point about points is that it's like, well, the team has a discretion to say, like, wait, hold on, you're break. Like, no, this is not okay.
00:44:40.486 - 00:45:07.360, Speaker C: You're gaming this, and this is not in the spirit of competition. And so I don't know the particular person you mentioned, but I can imagine blast when they actually are ready to convert the points into the tokens, they're like, wait, actually looks like this guy and these guys over here, like, what they're doing is bullshit. And so fuck all of you and fuck all your points. And even people who are trading on whatever that whale market is doing.
00:45:07.970 - 00:45:08.286, Speaker A: His.
00:45:08.308 - 00:45:17.850, Speaker C: Whale market. Yeah. So this place where people are trading points, you can imagine that a bunch of point systems just go through whale market. Is it open? Can you see all the people who are trading?
00:45:17.930 - 00:45:20.050, Speaker A: You can see all the bids. It's just peer to peer.
00:45:20.870 - 00:45:41.286, Speaker C: Yeah, if it's peer to peer, you can imagine people just going in there and saying, look, we're going to go back through the history of everyone who's traded on this marketplace and invalidate everyone. All your points go to zero. And all of a sudden, people will feel this real fear that, like, oh, shit, I'd better not try to financialize my points, because if I get caught doing it, they go away, and that becomes a big risk.
00:45:41.398 - 00:45:52.154, Speaker A: Yeah. But I feel like this cat and mouse game sounds actually quite entertaining. Right. Between the team and the. It's just like, now it's another level of game theory between them.
00:45:52.272 - 00:46:16.594, Speaker C: Yes, totally. But that's also true for airdrops, right? Back in the day, when people were doing just vanilla airdrops, they would spend a lot of energy trying to filter out the airdrop farmers and the inorganic activity and this and that. And so this has always happened, at least with point systems. It's more transparent that that is in the purview of the team to go in and do the work, to figure out who's doing this honestly and who's kind of fucking around at the same.
00:46:16.632 - 00:46:56.574, Speaker A: Time, I do kind of agree with Julian. I kind of think there's going to be two market forces that kind of cause these things to change again. One is people being like, I can't get out of these and I need liquidity. Fine. But the second is sort of this aspect of like, if these financial markets start becoming sufficiently liquid, and then the team is like, hey, we're going to ban you from using it. There are two ways this could go. This could go like, okay, people are afraid they won't sell or that market will suddenly be more liquid because everyone's like, oh, my, liquidity is worthless in this protocol anyway, so I'm just going to exit.
00:46:56.574 - 00:47:02.626, Speaker A: Right? And so there's so many different end states from this that would be, you.
00:47:02.648 - 00:47:06.340, Speaker C: Mean take your liquidity out of the protocol? Or do you mean exit your points?
00:47:06.710 - 00:47:21.174, Speaker A: Well, exit your points because you're assuming that your tokens are going to be worthless. And so that kind of causes this, like, everyone, no one adding new liquidity. Right. It actually will flatline the point system. So there's this interaction because it's less.
00:47:21.212 - 00:47:23.674, Speaker C: Liquid, the points are less valuable in and of themselves.
00:47:23.872 - 00:47:54.850, Speaker A: Yeah. And also if the team says, oh, yeah, we're not going to give you an airdrop, then now most of the market, you might just say, no. New entrants join your protocol. So there is this kind of trade off that happened, and I think that will be this tit for tat type of thing where one side does one thing, the other side makes another market. And that's the beauty of these permissionless markets. Right? You can't really stop anyone from doing that. It's not like Tradfi where Gary Gensler can beat you on the head with a bonk malware.
00:47:54.850 - 00:48:02.322, Speaker A: I don't know what point our points security is. I don't know. That one is too hard. Good luck.
00:48:02.386 - 00:48:29.630, Speaker B: Points are just points. Yeah, points are just points. I think everyone needs to go back and take like, a beanie babies. Everyone needs to go back and take like a web two growth marketing course. Because I feel like all this stuff has been so well trodden. Like, even the referral thing that you're mentioning earlier, there's this kind of famous story of in the early days at Uber, the software engineer figured out that you can get like a lower. I think Uber is giving out like $20 to everybody that you could refer.
00:48:29.630 - 00:49:11.414, Speaker B: And so the software engineer figured out that you could run Google search words ads for less than that $20 CAc, like he was paying like $2 for running Uber referral code or something ads on that, on that search term on Google. And so he's just racking up like tens of thousands of dollars in Uber credits by running Google Ads for his own Uber referral link. And eventually Uber found out and they shut down his account or removed its credits or something. But it's like humans are humans, and they just respond to incentives. And a lot of this stuff has been tried many, many times over. And so I think if we maybe learn more from kind of the past attempts at doing this, we'd have actually better systems versus kind of reinventing.
00:49:11.542 - 00:49:43.574, Speaker A: I mean, this is why I brought up the marketplace optimization a B testing stuff, right? That's how people catch, or at least test do these experiments to catch people, right? And I think that the teams doing points are kind of. It's not like they're not. They know they need to do that. So I think it's just more like the quick financialization changes this in the sense that your a B test can be interacted with in a way that you can't control. So that's a novel thing. That's very true. Crypto only like this.
00:49:43.574 - 00:50:15.534, Speaker A: Whales market points, market. Interacting with how people are using your protocol is like, that's a totally weird thing. Or like avo interacting with how VCs are pricing deals. That's also a new thing. Do you remember in the early, maybe like 2013, 2015, there were like tons of VCs would just be like, give me your daus and Maus and retention and, okay, I'm valuing your company from that. Right. This is like that, except it's like people are putting more skin in the mean.
00:50:15.572 - 00:50:24.980, Speaker C: So, Truan, are you arguing that a team should not be actively kind of policing and deleting points, know, trying to enforce the non transferability of points?
00:50:27.830 - 00:50:36.998, Speaker A: I think initially, if they do it, people might get scared, but then people will start finding ways around it. Don't underestimate the creativity of people who want liquidity, of course, but I mean.
00:50:37.004 - 00:50:42.106, Speaker C: Look at Tom just brought up the point of like, okay, Uber and the referral codes, right? Like, okay, if you're Uber, Uber can.
00:50:42.128 - 00:50:43.034, Speaker A: Actually shut you out.
00:50:43.072 - 00:50:47.258, Speaker C: It's all in the game. Technically, Uber can shut you out. So can a point system.
00:50:47.424 - 00:50:57.438, Speaker A: No, I can go sell on financial product that comes out to let you get out which Uber you're locked in.
00:50:57.604 - 00:50:58.830, Speaker D: I think, for Wales market.
00:50:58.900 - 00:51:02.286, Speaker C: Right. But you can collapse the value of the secondary market.
00:51:02.468 - 00:51:44.220, Speaker D: Yeah, no, you definitely can collapse it by doing these rules. But I do agree that with Turin's point is just like, we literally have this permissionless trading of these things and no one can stop it because it's all traded in dollars. It's not traded in the tokens of points. It's literally a completely separate thing. And it's enforceable with contracts, smart contracts. So it is like a very crypto native thing. You know for sure that this protocol is going to be able to deliver the collateral if the points are worth nothing or something like that, which I think is like quite novel, actually.
00:51:45.230 - 00:51:51.018, Speaker C: Wait, so the points are generally tied to the address, are they not? Or are they tied to something else that's transferable?
00:51:51.194 - 00:52:04.738, Speaker D: They are tied to the address. So you're selling like an address in Wales market. You're not selling anything. It's really just like a future that we both agree on. So if you are the seller of these points, I just post USDC as.
00:52:04.824 - 00:52:16.710, Speaker C: Oh, I see. I'm not actually selling. So you couldn't necessarily identify where the points that are being speculated on are raising from.
00:52:16.780 - 00:52:18.280, Speaker D: You can't really stop it.
00:52:18.730 - 00:52:29.290, Speaker C: Yeah, I see. Well, if somebody creates a new account that is not the account that actually has the points they're hedging, then you can't necessarily tell who's doing what.
00:52:29.360 - 00:52:50.914, Speaker A: Also, if there's enough demand, people will make pooled models. The pooled models become much harder to police. The cat and mouse game keeps going on. So I think that's where it's extremely different than web two. And that's also something where it's like purely the on chain stuff will dominate the centralized. Because the centralized things will look like Uber. And they can shut you down.
00:52:50.914 - 00:53:01.250, Speaker A: Right. They could just turn off that market. But clearly you can't really shut off these on chain markets for this stuff. And that's where the fun is. That's like the excitement.
00:53:01.410 - 00:53:10.546, Speaker C: Yeah, that makes sense. That makes sense. For some reason, I was under the impression they were selling accounts. But if they're just doing derivatives, then yeah, there's no way to stop that.
00:53:10.588 - 00:53:20.154, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, you could sell Ford's off chain super analog. Right. The same kind of thing. I think really you need a point system for the point system so people.
00:53:20.192 - 00:53:21.870, Speaker C: Can hedge their point disclosure.
00:53:22.610 - 00:53:29.662, Speaker A: But I think we're already starting to see that. No, there's already people starting doing that. My point is.
00:53:29.796 - 00:53:30.574, Speaker B: Wait, what?
00:53:30.692 - 00:53:46.370, Speaker A: There are already people who are making point derivatives. Okay, sure. I think that the beauty of this space compared to everything else is this freedom means people will find a way to be creative because they want liquidity.
00:53:46.450 - 00:54:18.046, Speaker C: Yeah, that is certainly true. Very interesting. Well, so we're coming up on time, so I wanted to wrap Julian with sharing a little bit about, because right now you guys are going through a big transition of your own. Originally, as I mentioned, you are ribbon finance. I think the token is still called ribbon finance, but you are alongside Avo, which is this decentralized perpetual swaps protocol. You're also rebranding the token without points as we established. Talk us through why you guys are doing that.
00:54:18.046 - 00:54:49.000, Speaker C: There haven't been a lot of rebrands in crypto, certainly not in Defi. Why are you guys rebranding the token and what is that experience like for you guys? Because that sounds, some people have done this thing where they launch a new token and it's totally new token supply. You guys are not doing that. You're moving everything over. Why? Actually, this is something that we were just having a conversation internally because there's another team we're talking to right now that is launching a second token with a new product instead of moving over the original token. Talk us through how you're thinking about that.
00:54:49.310 - 00:54:58.346, Speaker D: Yeah, I think ultimately teams have the choice to do a new token. I think we also maybe thought about it, but ultimately I think we just.
00:54:58.368 - 00:55:01.580, Speaker A: Felt like the maybe thought about it.
00:55:02.910 - 00:56:03.954, Speaker D: Yeah, we basically were going to collapse the old product into the new product and it wasn't going to be this separate thing. And I think where it makes the most sense to do a new token is when maybe you're doing just like a hard pivot, like you're doing defi and now you're doing NFTs and these are like completely separate things. You feel like they have almost no reason to be tied together. On like an economic standpoint, maybe it makes sense, but I think Verissio is pretty close and the products were going to get collapsed. I think one main issue with doing a new token is sort of like the old token basically becomes worthless or becomes worth very little because it's now sort of governing a very small part of what you're doing. Probably the team has probably abandoned the first product. So, yeah, I think we didn't want to have that mental sort of decision of should I buy this or that if I want to get exposure to what I'm working on.
00:56:03.954 - 00:56:48.074, Speaker D: So we just decided we quite like this single token model. But I think as someone who's been in the space for a few years, I think, I know new tokens are always like a new sort of story. I think people can build new hype around it. I think there are all these advantages to launching new token. I think, yeah, we kind of did both at the same time, so it's more just like a rebrand, but there's a bunch of rules to how the token swap is going to happen. And, yeah, I think, interestingly, almost all our users now don't even know what ribbon is. All these people in Discord, I've never heard of ribbon.
00:56:48.074 - 00:57:25.020, Speaker D: Why are people saying it's related to this? No one even knows anything about the old product, which I think is really healthy. So I think for those users, they perceive this as like a new project. They're excited about it. But we also get sort of the old community who. They've been like hardcore defi option traders since three years ago and they're still sort of along for the ride and still within the community. So, yeah, I think that's sort of like our thought process. We just get all these new people, all this new attention, but we also sort of retain the old group.
00:57:25.020 - 00:57:43.280, Speaker D: I actually do think we're going to see a lot more rebrands this year. Like Maddox did one recently, merit Circle did one recently. So, yeah, maybe there's going to be this bullish rebrand trend that may happen, but we'll see.
00:57:43.970 - 00:57:52.820, Speaker C: Yeah, there's also Bitdao to mantle. It does seem like it's been rebrand season, I guess, just in time for a new the.
00:57:53.190 - 00:57:55.394, Speaker B: You can't forget the OG Ethlanda Ave.
00:57:55.442 - 00:57:57.842, Speaker A: I mean, that was the most successful one. That was the most successful.
00:57:57.906 - 00:58:00.854, Speaker C: That's right. Definitely true. Definitely true.
00:58:00.892 - 00:58:20.090, Speaker A: Well, but they changed the supply though, right? That part is the part where I actually feel like is kind of interesting because even in normal stocks, people do that for meme reasons or to make it more retail friendly, like the Tesla stock split. Do you remember where they changed?
00:58:20.670 - 00:58:21.770, Speaker C: Polka dot did that.
00:58:21.840 - 00:58:24.380, Speaker A: Polka dot. I don't remember when that was that.
00:58:24.770 - 00:58:32.362, Speaker C: Yeah, polka dot did that. The unit price is very high and they did, I don't know, like a hundred for one or 1000 for one token split.
00:58:32.426 - 00:58:35.338, Speaker A: I mean, the rebrand is a good time to do that, is what.
00:58:35.524 - 00:58:38.350, Speaker C: Yes, totally, totally agreed.
00:58:38.510 - 00:58:41.714, Speaker A: But you chose not to do that, julian, right?
00:58:41.832 - 00:58:42.498, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:58:42.664 - 00:58:44.050, Speaker C: You decided to go one for one.
00:58:44.120 - 00:58:49.400, Speaker D: One for one. The denomination was small enough. We didn't need to add a few. .0.
00:58:52.330 - 00:59:32.558, Speaker C: I do think it can be helpful to markets just to kind of people who are sort of think like, oh, this thing trades from here to here and you do some weird conversion, divide it by 3.7 and then it's like, okay, you can't really do the math anymore. It's like, well, who knows what this thing is worth? That does seem to work, at least to some extent. But I want to ask you this before we close out, because we're up on time, but Julian, at this point, you are one of the Defi OGs. You've been doing this for quite a while. Who do you look up to as kind of your personal heroes within crypto or Defi? Who do you think has done it best or you want to emulate?
00:59:32.654 - 01:00:05.454, Speaker D: Maybe this is going to be an unpopular opinion, but I actually really like the way that Jupiter founder did what they've been doing for the last few. Like, it's really. Yeah, like, I mean, I know the guy pretty. He's great. And they really stuck it out. I think we spoke almost two years ago at the absolute bottom of Solana, and we were just, like, brainstorming ideas on rebranding. They effectively did a rebrand as well, from their previous swap protocol to this.
01:00:05.454 - 01:00:28.358, Speaker D: So we have had a lot of back and forth around how to do. I mean, I think I really respect how they kind of stuck through the Solana plan the whole time. Like, zero plans to do. They didn't get carried away by the cross chain narrative or lay two narrative. They were just like, day one.
01:00:28.524 - 01:00:30.470, Speaker A: They didn't move to a move chain.
01:00:30.890 - 01:01:01.822, Speaker D: Exactly. I mean, all these Solana protocols moved to Sui and whatever, right? But these guys really stuck it out. And throughout the bear market, he was telling me that there are days where they had zero users, basically almost zero activity, but their products, they had so much time to just iterate on the product. I think if you guys have tried it, I actually think it's like a really good product as well. They've just told me they've done everything.
01:01:01.876 - 01:01:05.406, Speaker A: From arguably best product, best consumer product in crypto.
01:01:05.438 - 01:01:39.180, Speaker D: I feel like. Exactly. They just care about small stuff, like how quickly does the page load, how quickly does your token list auto populate, as well as some other sort of unique DCA features and stuff like that? So I actually think they did really well for themselves and, like, the Solana community. So, yeah, I feel like, I really respect that. They really stuck to the mission. They never pivoted or cared about whatever people thought. I guess that's just, like, in their personality as well.
01:01:39.180 - 01:01:53.600, Speaker D: He's a bit eccentric, I guess, doing all this crazy meme coin stuff, but he just doesn't care. So I actually really respect that, which may not be, like, a popular thing, but, yeah, he's great.
01:01:53.970 - 01:02:11.560, Speaker C: No, that's a great answer. And clearly he's been very handsomely rewarded for that. Well done. To meow. All right, well, we're up on time. Thanks, Julian. Coming joining us and sharing your insights, and we'll be back next week and hopefully hoping my throat will be better.
01:02:11.560 - 01:02:12.260, Speaker C: Everybody.
