00:00:00.170 - 00:00:12.560, Speaker A: We have always been very clear. We know that we're doing token sale, right? So I think many of these criticisms came in. I feel like, you know, hiccupers, you know, they fly by and they drop shit. You know, it felt that way to me.

00:00:58.850 - 00:01:05.066, Speaker B: Today's guest is Meow, founder of Jupiter a Dex aggregation protocol on Solana. Welcome, meow.
00:01:05.178 - 00:01:07.460, Speaker A: Hello, Laura, nice to meet you.
00:01:07.990 - 00:01:23.240, Speaker B: Congrats on your successful airdrop this week. It didn't seem to break anything, and right out of the gate it gave your Dex aggregation protocol, Jupiter, an 800 million dollar market cap. So explain to us what it is that Jupiter is and how it works.
00:01:23.610 - 00:01:38.390, Speaker A: Okay, so Jupiter started as a deck aggregation, right? But actually, we're actually a really broad platform now. Okay. We have aggregation, we have limit orders, we have DCA, we have perps, and recently rely launchpad.
00:01:38.470 - 00:01:38.858, Speaker D: Right.
00:01:38.944 - 00:02:09.106, Speaker A: So I think we are also the most used service on Salana. And we refer about 80% of organic volume on Salana. And recently, we also recently crossed pancake and uniswap in terms of monthly active users wallets. So I would say that we are probably, if not the most used trading platform in Defi today as well. Yeah. And then our purps platform also did 1.4 billion in volume last week.
00:02:09.106 - 00:02:29.962, Speaker A: So I think we started out being a dash aggregator. And don't get me wrong, we spent a lot of time making sure that we do the absolute best possible routing in Solana. But I think we have also grown quite a bit into different products, including perfs and our new launchpad. Yeah. So I think that's what bring.
00:02:30.096 - 00:02:37.406, Speaker B: When I started and I said you're a Dex aggregation protocol. So what would you describe Jupiter as good mean?
00:02:37.428 - 00:02:57.390, Speaker A: I'll just say that we are building the. Right now I say that we are building the best exchange in, right. Basically, I think we have pretty much everything you need in one platform. We have swap, which is the aggregation and for aggregation because we aggregate, right. We promise you best price, best user experience and best token selection.
00:02:57.470 - 00:02:58.050, Speaker D: Right.
00:02:58.200 - 00:03:03.334, Speaker A: Whatever token you want. Whatever token you want is there, right. And the best ux and the best price.
00:03:03.372 - 00:03:03.622, Speaker D: Right.
00:03:03.676 - 00:03:10.258, Speaker A: And then we have limit orders. And your limit orders actually really special because you can actually place limit orders. You don't need markets for limit orders.
00:03:10.274 - 00:03:10.598, Speaker D: Right.
00:03:10.684 - 00:03:16.314, Speaker A: And then your DCA. So this is actually great because DCA is by far the fan favorite, right, right.
00:03:16.352 - 00:03:20.490, Speaker B: Dollar cost averaging just for non traders who are listening to the show.
00:03:20.560 - 00:03:49.700, Speaker A: So the very cool thing is that people use us for DCA for a lot of different things. For example, they buy low liquidity coins every hour, right? Actually, originally when we did it, we're like, okay, people can use DCA to DCA. So over one month or something, right. Every day for a. No, no, people don't do that. What people do instead is that they buy very low liquidity coins and then they buy incrementally over a few minutes or every five minutes, right. So that's what they do.
00:03:49.700 - 00:03:57.042, Speaker A: People love it, right. Because it's a feature that I think doesn't exist anywhere else or it's not done well anywhere else on Jupiter.
00:03:57.186 - 00:04:00.118, Speaker B: And that's just to reduce price slippage.
00:04:00.214 - 00:04:27.710, Speaker A: Yes, precisely. Because you have a lot of things that, because for a lot of these low liquidity coins, if you buy like by five k, you will hit like 3% already. And not just that, you also sucker because you imbalance the pool and then someone take someone up you, things like that, or someone fun run you many of that, right. So you just do the. Right. It's really cool, I think. And of course there are perps as well, virtuals.
00:04:27.710 - 00:04:42.214, Speaker A: And our pubs are probably, I think, definitely top few in the industry. And then if you do not consider DyDx and all the other l ones, we are probably the top around there. So I think we are doing pretty well as well.
00:04:42.252 - 00:04:42.840, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:04:47.130 - 00:04:55.930, Speaker B: You'Re doing all this in Salana, but as far as I understand, you've been around in crypto for a little while. So tell us how you got into crypto and came to launch Jupiter.
00:04:57.070 - 00:05:08.334, Speaker A: Long story short is that my crypto journey began. I met a friend in San Francisco who just mysteriously became the smartest guy about bitcoin I ever knew.
00:05:08.372 - 00:05:08.862, Speaker D: Right.
00:05:08.996 - 00:05:30.050, Speaker A: He taught me everything I knew. It's funny because I met him at party, a Dodge coin party, right, in San Francisco. And what year was this 17, no, 16, can't remember around there, right? So long ago. But anyway, long story short, ask him. He asked me what they're not bitcoin. I said nothing, right? I asked him why he know bitcoin, he said nothing. So turns out that one of us are lying.
00:05:30.050 - 00:06:13.010, Speaker A: Anyway, he knew everything. He taught me everything I knew, right? It was a chance encounter, but he told me everything I knew, right? And after that I think I went to really advise and help out in a bunch of projects, including portfolio, which obviously got bought by FTX. So I was advisor there. And then after I went to advise projects, which is know and bunch of others. And we also started WBTC, which is the most used rep token. So WTC was started as a collaboration between. So we did a big go, right? So together, Biggo and Ren, we started WTC, which is obviously the most used token today, right? Yeah.
00:06:13.010 - 00:06:42.202, Speaker A: After that, at some point I think I wanted a. Because that was all if, so, before this all if, right? So I think at some point I think I wanted a new environment. And then I came with, and then we started earlier project, then from there we became a cure and the mercury became right now it became metera. And then as part of the process we started Jupyter. So that's how we end up with two main projects under our studio right now.
00:06:42.336 - 00:06:58.446, Speaker B: And so this week obviously was the big event with the airdrop, but I know that you guys kind of did a sort of test run, you had like the when token Airdrop. So what was the purpose of that? What did you learn from doing the when token Airdrop that helped you prepare.
00:06:58.478 - 00:08:01.130, Speaker A: For this one at Breakpoint last year, right? I told everybody I wanted to be a launchpad, right? Because I felt that launching new tokens is such an important part of the process. It's really important. It's really, really important, right? But I also felt it was really, I didn't like the current models. Everything felt wrong to me, right, from token get the launch pads to the other ideal models. I just didn't like how they work. And then in addition, one of the things that is very important in today's crypto scene is airdrops. It's very important, right, because that is almost like the main event, right? And there hasn't really been a launch pad that integrated the idea of airdrops into the launch pad, right? And sometimes it's very tricky because launch pads usually have people, we wanted to build a system there and we had that problem too, right? So in essence, what we ended up doing was that we didn't end up trying to launch Jup, we ended up trying to build a launch pad.
00:08:01.130 - 00:09:12.774, Speaker A: Because think about it, right? If I launch a jup token without using my launchpad, will I have any credibility to ask any other project to use Jupyter as launchpad? Not possible, right? It's just not possible. So I had to launch Jup using my own launchpad, right? Does that make sense? Anyway, I was just musing. So I was just talking to community about it. We were just on Discord because I spent a lot on Discord, right? So I was just like talking to Discord and everything inside and someone just said, hey, why don't you just launch a meme coin, right, as a dry run for Jupe, right? Because there's a lot of unknowns, right? I was like, okay, that's a really fucking stupid idea, right? But obviously me being me, if it's a stupid idea, go test it, right? So I went on Twitter and be like, hey, someone suggested that we launch a test coin to test the launch pad to test a launch. Just how, you know, how Elon launched test rockets. So if Elon can test launch rockets, why can't we test token launch, right? Think about it. So long story short is that we say, okay, we're going to launch a token before Jupiter.
00:09:12.774 - 00:10:10.990, Speaker A: It's much more lower stakes, much lower stakes because the token is obviously much less value, right? But what we can also do is that we can also technically stress test it, right? That means that we can actually. So for Jup, the number of Jupe number of recipients is at 955K. So for the rent token, we add up to more than a million, right? 1.1 million or something, right? So in many ways it was like just as technically stressful, it required us to really scale RPCs, really scale up RPCs, risk infra and really get the UI right and everything, but in a much lower state context. So that was the point of it. Obviously it was something fun as well, right? As of now, after testing our launch system with both Wan and Jup, I feel confident now to tell people to come use us as Launchpad. So that was a big part of it.
00:10:10.990 - 00:10:12.414, Speaker A: Does that make sense?
00:10:12.612 - 00:10:18.500, Speaker B: Yeah. So in a moment, we'll talk more about how the launch went. But first, a quick word for the sponsors who make this show possible.
00:10:19.030 - 00:10:28.086, Speaker C: Did you know you can buy and sell crypto with tax benefits in an individual retirement account? Itrust capital makes this possible. But what does this mean when you.
00:10:28.108 - 00:10:30.374, Speaker B: Buy crypto outside an IRA, like on.
00:10:30.412 - 00:10:33.106, Speaker C: An exchange, you face taxes on gains.
00:10:33.218 - 00:10:34.994, Speaker B: But in an IRA, like a Roth.
00:10:35.042 - 00:10:47.610, Speaker C: IRA, gains can be tax free. ITrust capital also has some of the lowest fees in the industry and 24/7 accessibility. Start now and maximize your retirement savings with itrust capital.
00:10:48.110 - 00:11:43.798, Speaker B: Back to my conversation with meow. So, as the day of your airdrop, the crypto community did seem impressed that nothing broke. But as I'm sure you saw then, there was a lot of criticism afterward about how people seem to think that the airdrop was beneficial to the Jupiter team. So some examples are people are pointing out that the Jupiter team sold about maybe 20% of the circulating supply from day one at what they consider a high valuation. And the way that this worked is they're saying that the Jupiter team provided liquidity in a liquidity pool on the dynamic liquidity market maker Meteora. But pretty much for at least that first hour, the liquidity pool was basically just Jupiter selling to buyers and that the price that you guys had set was that it would reach about $0.70 as the number of tokens sold reached 250,000,000.
00:11:43.798 - 00:11:50.826, Speaker B: And they were pointing out that you guys made this money without any vesting. So what do you say to these criticisms?
00:11:51.018 - 00:12:05.918, Speaker A: Oh, I say they're right. That's how it works. But as usual, the devil's details, right? The important thing to understand about this pool, right. It's not a fundraising pool, first and foremost. It's not a fundraising pool, first and foremost.
00:12:06.014 - 00:12:06.466, Speaker D: Okay.
00:12:06.568 - 00:12:12.710, Speaker A: It's first and foremost, a liquidity bootstrap and backstop pool. Okay? Let me explain to you.
00:12:12.860 - 00:12:17.990, Speaker B: I mean, I think they're saying the net effect is that it's as if you raised $250,000,000.
00:12:18.060 - 00:12:20.202, Speaker A: No, it's actually not 250. But first net effect.
00:12:20.336 - 00:12:20.778, Speaker D: Right?
00:12:20.864 - 00:12:39.600, Speaker A: The first net effect. By the way, first of all, I think we should raise. I don't actually feel bad about raising at all. We didn't do any OTC. We didn't do any VC rounds for Jupiter, right? And the reason we didn't do any of that is that we wanted our first sale to be with the community.
00:12:40.050 - 00:12:41.550, Speaker D: Right? That's it.
00:12:41.620 - 00:12:54.370, Speaker A: We wanted it to be open market sale. So think about it, right? Whoever criticized me, asked their favorite defi protocol, probably sold like, 20% tokens or something to a BC, right. Who vested over time.
00:12:54.440 - 00:12:54.674, Speaker D: Right.
00:12:54.712 - 00:12:58.294, Speaker A: We didn't do any of that. Or OTC tokens wherever. Shit. We didn't do any of that stuff.
00:12:58.332 - 00:12:58.630, Speaker D: Right.
00:12:58.700 - 00:13:06.242, Speaker A: Instead, what we did is very simple. We took 2.5% of total supply with no further people invest in Jupiter.
00:13:06.306 - 00:13:06.998, Speaker D: None. Right.
00:13:07.084 - 00:13:09.020, Speaker A: 2.5% open market.
00:13:09.470 - 00:13:09.978, Speaker D: Right.
00:13:10.064 - 00:13:16.250, Speaker B: You're talking about not the ones released in the airdrop, but the full 10 billion that will eventually.
00:13:20.110 - 00:13:22.410, Speaker A: 10% was released in the airdrop.
00:13:22.830 - 00:13:23.578, Speaker D: Right.
00:13:23.744 - 00:13:36.618, Speaker A: And 2.5% was for. But by the way, I think just as a context. Right. We announced that we're going to do a 20% token sale last year at breakpoint. 20%.
00:13:36.724 - 00:13:37.234, Speaker D: Okay.
00:13:37.352 - 00:13:40.242, Speaker A: And based on committee feedback, we got 10%.
00:13:40.376 - 00:13:40.770, Speaker D: Right.
00:13:40.840 - 00:13:42.994, Speaker A: And then based on committee feedback, again, we got a 5%.
00:13:43.112 - 00:13:43.538, Speaker D: Right.
00:13:43.624 - 00:13:47.186, Speaker A: And then after that, after we realized, oh, shit, the price is going to be really high.
00:13:47.288 - 00:13:47.710, Speaker D: Right.
00:13:47.800 - 00:13:49.494, Speaker A: We got down to 2.5%.
00:13:49.612 - 00:13:50.280, Speaker D: Right.
00:13:50.970 - 00:14:06.810, Speaker A: So, actually, we have been very clear about our intentions to do a token sale from day one. If you have been following any of Jupiter stuff, including the breakpoint, we have always been very clear that there's a token sale coming. We just weren't sure how to do it.
00:14:06.960 - 00:14:10.918, Speaker B: Okay, so initially, you were calling it a token sale.
00:14:11.014 - 00:14:32.740, Speaker A: Full stop. Done. Anyone who is interested, check out my Jupyter breakpoint presentation. Right. I presented it in Brickpoint in front of thousands of people and also in front of everybody. And I've been talking about it for months and months and months on discord and anywhere. I even went on two live streams before the talk.
00:14:32.740 - 00:14:35.938, Speaker A: And even for when? Even for when.
00:14:36.024 - 00:14:36.562, Speaker D: Right.
00:14:36.696 - 00:14:53.302, Speaker A: I tweeted a handover ceremony whereby the tokens were taken out and given the team, the team that's running when, first of all, okay, so I think if you have been following Jupiter in any way, you will know that, number one, we have always been very clear. We know that we're going to do a token sale.
00:14:53.446 - 00:14:53.898, Speaker D: Right?
00:14:53.984 - 00:15:03.040, Speaker A: So I think many of these criticisms came in. I feel like, you know, they fly by and they drop shit. It felt that way to me.
00:15:04.290 - 00:15:14.850, Speaker B: So you feel like you were messaging that it was a token sale? The mechanism of this liquidity being a liquidity provider, that came later, after you had called it a token sale.
00:15:15.670 - 00:15:18.030, Speaker A: First of all, I do apologize.
00:15:18.110 - 00:15:18.354, Speaker D: Right?
00:15:18.392 - 00:15:21.630, Speaker A: I do apologize if there's any misunderstanding.
00:15:21.710 - 00:15:22.002, Speaker D: Right.
00:15:22.056 - 00:15:29.150, Speaker A: I think, on my end, I do feel like I've been signaling and communicating very clearly all year long that I'm doing a token sale.
00:15:29.230 - 00:15:29.474, Speaker D: Right.
00:15:29.512 - 00:15:37.126, Speaker A: Very clearly. I mean, you can't get more clear than going on stage in a few thousand people and say, calling a token sale. You just can't get more clear than that.
00:15:37.228 - 00:15:38.534, Speaker D: Am I right? You know?
00:15:38.572 - 00:16:10.850, Speaker A: Right. And secondly, and you must understand one thing, Laura. You must really understand this. Thing, there is an extremely good chance that I don't actually get any money out of this USDC, out of this at all, okay? Because first and foremost, this is a backstop pool. Now what does that mean? It means that anyone, whether you're airdrop recipient or someone with bio remorse, right, can just dump into this pool for seven days. Seven days, okay. And you know what happened earlier in the day, people are fighting it so hard that it really just started retreating.
00:16:10.850 - 00:16:42.694, Speaker A: It really started draining out all the way to like 54, 53 or something until it started reversing back. So that's a very good chance that it just get done nothing. So the whole idea that first and foremost, right? So you must understand why we do not see that as a token sale pool, right? Because first and foremost, it's a backstop pool, okay? Now what does that mean? It means that at any point in time, right, the joke token falls below zero point 440 cents, right? We get nothing. Full stop, right? We get the pool.
00:16:42.742 - 00:16:43.158, Speaker D: That's it.
00:16:43.184 - 00:16:46.394, Speaker A: So we get tokens back and the feeds from the pool.
00:16:46.522 - 00:16:56.126, Speaker B: Yeah. The critics are saying that since the tokens were made out of thin air, it's like the risk is just that.
00:16:56.148 - 00:17:28.860, Speaker A: It's actually a very unfair statement to make, guys. Sorry, man. That's a really unfair statement to make. We worked extremely hard to create an asset that people wanted to buy that a lot of people felt symbolizes defi to the o, okay? And we were extremely careful about every single token that got released, okay? Check out jup research. Jupresearch. J u p r e a r c h. Check it out, right? Really check it out.
00:17:28.860 - 00:18:09.958, Speaker A: We documented the whole. Because we treat Jup as a very valuable resource, okay? So we documented every single step of token minting accountability. For example, all our co wallets, we can't actually sign or release it. Why? Because we actually got professional custodians and three ecosystem people, well known people, right? Such that if you want to unlock the cow wallet stuff, they have to sign in. And then we are very close to finding the professional custodian for that. So I think we build a community up the user base up the product up for this to be a very valuable token, okay? First and foremost, it's not our thin air, okay? That's very important.
00:18:10.044 - 00:18:10.438, Speaker D: Okay?
00:18:10.524 - 00:18:12.522, Speaker A: If it's our thin air, why don't they do it?
00:18:12.576 - 00:18:12.842, Speaker D: Right?
00:18:12.896 - 00:18:17.018, Speaker A: Think about it, right? If it's out thin air, why don't they do? Seriously? Seriously, Laura, walk with me, okay? Work with me.
00:18:17.024 - 00:18:17.338, Speaker D: Okay?
00:18:17.424 - 00:18:50.642, Speaker A: If it is really out of thin air, right. Why don't they do it and make it and set it at this price and let people buy it? No, it's not out in there, Laura. It's not. It's the manifestation of the years and years of commitment, effort, commitment to the ecosystem and community building, ecosystem building and then resulting the token that people wanted to buy. As a result, that took value. And we were very careful of protecting value. We locked everything up properly, had everything in wallets that committee can track, and we took a small piece of that out into out of a sale.
00:18:50.642 - 00:19:00.698, Speaker A: Right. And remember, there's no more vesting. Right. There's 5% for mercury and 20% for team, but there's nothing else. So we were very, very careful how to use it.
00:19:00.784 - 00:19:01.706, Speaker D: Okay, that's it.
00:19:01.728 - 00:19:02.874, Speaker A: That's all I'll say.
00:19:03.072 - 00:19:36.850, Speaker B: Okay. There was another criticism about, as we mentioned, you were using meteora, which was this dynamic liquidity market maker for the liquidity pool. And I guess on there, the swap fee that liquidity providers earn consists of both a base fee and a variable fee. And the variable fee is based on real time volatility. And they're saying that this dynamic, where the sales are mostly just all happening in one direction, created a lot more volatility, which then jacked up that fee that you would earn. So what do you say to that criticism?
00:19:37.270 - 00:19:37.874, Speaker A: I'll say that.
00:19:37.912 - 00:19:38.402, Speaker D: Correct.
00:19:38.536 - 00:19:41.574, Speaker A: It's actually one big, again, this system is very new.
00:19:41.612 - 00:19:41.814, Speaker D: Right.
00:19:41.852 - 00:19:44.358, Speaker A: So I think one thing I'll say, this system is very new.
00:19:44.444 - 00:19:45.078, Speaker D: Okay.
00:19:45.244 - 00:20:00.938, Speaker A: It's a very new system. We are experimenting everything. Okay, guys, this is our second launch. Our first launch literally happened last less than a week ago. By the way, guys, just for some context, the when launch happened four days before the Jupyter launch. Four days.
00:20:01.024 - 00:20:01.898, Speaker D: Okay. Right.
00:20:01.984 - 00:20:05.582, Speaker A: So yes, we do things on the fly for sure. Okay. We learn a lot.
00:20:05.636 - 00:20:06.240, Speaker D: Okay.
00:20:07.170 - 00:20:11.502, Speaker A: For the, when the fees were high, but the pool was relatively small, like 3 million.
00:20:11.556 - 00:20:11.678, Speaker D: Right.
00:20:11.684 - 00:20:13.806, Speaker A: So it's just true too really fast.
00:20:13.908 - 00:20:14.510, Speaker D: Right.
00:20:14.660 - 00:20:16.814, Speaker A: So we didn't really think about that much.
00:20:16.852 - 00:20:17.150, Speaker D: Right.
00:20:17.220 - 00:20:21.646, Speaker A: For the July, it went really slowly and we would see that. No, they're right. So Hamilton.
00:20:21.678 - 00:20:22.306, Speaker D: Right.
00:20:22.488 - 00:20:47.322, Speaker A: If I would do it again, I would do outside much lower for sure. Because it wasn't just a problem with the fees. The problem was actually that it really kind of hurt prices, hurt the poor as well, price discovery wise. So for sure. Anyway, guys, I think if anyone is trying to, but if you are asking that question out of good intention, right. They're asking you can probably improve the system by doing a fees, 100% agree.
00:20:47.376 - 00:20:48.346, Speaker D: No problem. Right.
00:20:48.448 - 00:21:16.386, Speaker A: But if you are insignia, we think you are doing it for the money, then I think our track record speaks for itself. We spend very long time. I personally deal a lot of projects for no money, and then we spend a lot of time in Solana. It's actually making no money at all, just hooking our ass off. Right? Yeah. So I feel like we are very clean here in terms of how we think about it. In summary, 100% for future launchers, the pool fee is much lower.
00:21:16.488 - 00:21:16.850, Speaker D: Right.
00:21:16.920 - 00:21:30.886, Speaker A: And then for this one, the pool is set, ready, and we just learn from it. Honestly, it really hurt us. I'll tell you the truth. This pool feeding hurt us today, hurt us yesterday, because it really hurt the pool from breaking out. It's okay. We learn, as I said.
00:21:30.908 - 00:21:31.142, Speaker D: Okay.
00:21:31.196 - 00:21:37.462, Speaker A: So, Laura, one last thing is that I always tell people that. So if you look at my tweets right now, this is very important.
00:21:37.516 - 00:21:37.974, Speaker D: Okay.
00:21:38.092 - 00:21:48.574, Speaker A: This is very important. I. I always said that we're experimenting, and we will mess up. And we mess up. It's my fault. Okay, done. So I own it.
00:21:48.612 - 00:21:48.766, Speaker D: Okay.
00:21:48.788 - 00:22:26.300, Speaker A: I own that the fees are too high. I own that the number of the systems that people wanted to use to buy the token, that Bclin all didn't work that well. I also owned that some of the comms were not done as well, because, for example, earlier, to me, it was so clear what it was that when I communicated, it, I communicated, okay, it's a DLMM backstop. It's team owned DLMM backstop liquidity pool. So it was hard for me to register that people might not understand that. So I apologize for that. But anyway, I think, I'll tell you, I mess up a lot and I learn that's how it works.
00:22:26.300 - 00:22:38.926, Speaker A: But the good thing is this. After we do, right? The good thing is this. Everyone, now, every project that uses LVG now, right. They want this problem. The whole world will understand how it works.
00:22:39.108 - 00:22:39.790, Speaker D: Right?
00:22:39.940 - 00:22:41.280, Speaker A: And then I think it's great.
00:22:42.130 - 00:23:15.450, Speaker B: All right, so one other question is, I guess the plan initially was in the liquidity pool for the price to go up to $0.70, as the number of tokens sold was about 500 million. But then shortly before the airdrop, I guess that got changed. So it was 250. No, but I saw a screenshot of before the plan was it would be 500 million sold for it to reach that price. But then it got changed to 250,000,000 sold for it to reach that price. So basically, you guys were selling at this higher price.
00:23:15.450 - 00:23:18.460, Speaker B: Faster. So why did you make that change?
00:23:18.830 - 00:23:31.598, Speaker A: I mean, we keep changing things, right? In fact, if you look at our website, there's this entire model. It's actually on the website, it's actually under LFG design.
00:23:31.764 - 00:23:32.382, Speaker D: Okay.
00:23:32.516 - 00:23:42.690, Speaker A: And you can find that. So it's a tool that our intern built. Is an amazing intern, by the way. He built a tool to allow anybody to input a few parameters and output the graph and output the price rating and everything.
00:23:42.760 - 00:23:43.138, Speaker D: Right?
00:23:43.224 - 00:24:07.302, Speaker A: So what we were doing is that we were actually very actively trying to figure out what the good system was. And we actually made a decision a day before. Again, we do things, we are quite experimental. Okay, we finished the when thing last week and then we did Hannover on Monday, I think. And then we did juke on Wednesday.
00:24:07.446 - 00:24:07.898, Speaker D: Right.
00:24:07.984 - 00:24:45.640, Speaker A: So yeah, it was actually pretty tight. Anyway, what happened was that we just looked at numbers and we're like, okay, no, it is too much. Do I do this thing right? And then we said, hey, it feels better to do it this way. So we cut it down and then we published the economics to reflect everything as well. So basically it was a matter of us looking through numbers and thinking about it. I would say if I do it again, I would say that I was a bit too aggressive on the pricing, the low to high price, and the reason. Okay, here's the funny thing.
00:24:45.640 - 00:24:51.634, Speaker A: Basically what happened is that in earlier launchers, I think we were very heavily criticized.
00:24:51.682 - 00:24:52.134, Speaker D: Okay.
00:24:52.252 - 00:24:53.820, Speaker A: The one thing to answer about.
00:24:55.550 - 00:24:55.818, Speaker D: For.
00:24:55.824 - 00:25:12.334, Speaker A: The listeners who are not too familiar with LFG, right, the core concept here is open market, right? That means that whether you're airdrop or you are bought or the diamond pool, it opens at the same time, right? So it's a very dynamic open market system.
00:25:12.452 - 00:25:12.938, Speaker D: Okay.
00:25:13.044 - 00:25:20.814, Speaker A: And the reason, because I think unlike other, it's on chain, right? So anything happened, there's multiple pools happening everywhere.
00:25:20.862 - 00:25:21.460, Speaker D: Right.
00:25:22.710 - 00:25:31.398, Speaker A: And it's actually really important to understand that because we actually feel like that's actually the only way to do proper price discovery. Right. Everything. Because there'll be a lot of dumping too.
00:25:31.484 - 00:25:32.534, Speaker D: Right? Okay.
00:25:32.572 - 00:25:46.346, Speaker A: But back to the point. But in earlier launches, we were heavily criticized, right. The community was killing us, right. Because some of the early bottles, they got in at a very low price and they made like millions, right? And then the committee was very happy about it.
00:25:46.448 - 00:25:46.906, Speaker D: Okay?
00:25:47.008 - 00:26:20.950, Speaker A: So if you ask me, thinking, looking back, what happened was that we overprotected for that scenario by setting enterprise a bit too high, right? So basically what happened was what happened ended up, is that the max price ended up being like, the put price and then the initial price started being behind as well. It's actually because you wanted to protect against borders being too aggressive early on, but I guess we got a bit carried by that. I think if I do it again, I'll probably lower both. Right. I'll low .4 to that point 25 and low .7 to that point 65 or something.
00:26:20.950 - 00:26:23.270, Speaker A: I think that'll be a good range. Hindsight.
00:26:24.010 - 00:26:36.502, Speaker B: Okay. Yeah. And last criticism, again, we just need to go through these to address some of the stuff I've seen online. But critics are also pointing out that Jupiter paid itself 100 million tokens for use of its own launch pad.
00:26:36.646 - 00:26:41.134, Speaker A: Oh, that's great. Yeah, for sure. No, that's great because it's on dog food.
00:26:41.172 - 00:26:41.566, Speaker D: Right?
00:26:41.668 - 00:26:55.694, Speaker A: Again, we don't get the tokens. The dow does get. Sorry. We get 25% of that. No, Laura is very important. Okay. Like dog fooding.
00:26:55.694 - 00:26:57.374, Speaker A: Okay. It's a commitment.
00:26:57.422 - 00:26:58.018, Speaker D: Okay.
00:26:58.184 - 00:27:01.090, Speaker A: If I'm going to ask other projects to pay 1%.
00:27:01.240 - 00:27:01.940, Speaker D: Right.
00:27:02.470 - 00:27:08.114, Speaker A: I'll pay 1%. Again. The team gets 25% of it.
00:27:08.152 - 00:27:08.546, Speaker D: Right.
00:27:08.648 - 00:27:10.386, Speaker A: The most of it goes to a Jupdao.
00:27:10.498 - 00:27:10.918, Speaker D: Okay.
00:27:11.004 - 00:27:17.974, Speaker A: So a Jupdao from day one gets zero point 75% of when and zero point 75% of Jup. That's nice.
00:27:18.012 - 00:27:18.598, Speaker D: Right?
00:27:18.764 - 00:27:35.722, Speaker A: It's a really good incentive for new start. Again, we don't get most of it. We wouldn't sell a job anyway. We just wouldn't sell it. So it's cool. I think it's great. I think to anyone who criticized that, I'm like, no, I've been signaling that forever.
00:27:35.722 - 00:27:38.878, Speaker A: Okay. I tweeted about it, like, five times.
00:27:38.964 - 00:27:39.310, Speaker D: Okay?
00:27:39.380 - 00:27:53.730, Speaker A: So if you're going to criticize us without understanding that most of it goes to a dow. Firstly, and secondly, we're dog footing. And thirdly, I've been talking about it for a long time already. Come on, guys, give me a know. Start reading, you know?
00:27:53.800 - 00:27:54.420, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:27:54.970 - 00:28:06.870, Speaker B: Okay. So, obviously, now you overcame this major hurdle. Obviously, this launch was, I'm sure, a big deal. So what are the next plans for Jupiter?
00:28:07.610 - 00:28:40.762, Speaker A: I think the next plan for us is really to start, to stabilize. I think right now, honestly, right now, I think everyone's really tired. Okay. Anyway, I apologize for being so annoyed, but I feel like I woke up today to a lot of accusations that were based on bad faith, lack of reading, and no questioning.
00:28:40.906 - 00:28:41.418, Speaker D: Right.
00:28:41.524 - 00:29:02.522, Speaker A: There was no attempts to ask me what happened. There was no attempts to clarify through the previous things I've written, no attempts to actually read through. I mean, you are a researcher right. You know, right. Before you throw out accusations for people, you will read, right? I know you would.
00:29:02.576 - 00:29:02.986, Speaker D: Right?
00:29:03.088 - 00:30:14.706, Speaker A: So I feel like we spend a lot of time trying to figure out a launch system that is actually very community friendly. Again, we don't take out anything until the adro dumpers and buyer remorse and everyone has in. And also the other way, the other thing is that this system also allows buyers their confidence, right? Because having this pool here, remember, Laura, remember, we are actually airdropping a lot of value, okay? At current numbers, it's like 600 plus million value. And that means that you need a lot of buy demand, right? So buyers need to have, buyers need a lot of confidence, okay? And then what happens is that what happens is someone, the price starts fluctuating like crazy, right? The buyers have no commit to the buy. But what this pool actually does is that it absorbs a lot of the sell demand from people dumping, right? And that's actually the reason why despite it being such a major airdrop, you see the price increasing slowly, dropping a bit and being remarkably consistent because you have this pool there to really buffer a lot of the buy and sell demand, right? And honestly, I think it works as planned. It really worked as planned. So I'm really happy with that.
00:30:14.706 - 00:30:52.294, Speaker A: But I feel like instead of trying to understand the mechanics, I feel like people were not interested in understanding mechanics, but they were really interested in sender. That made me very upset because we really spent a lot of time thinking about how to build a better launch pad. We are not perfect, but I think we made progress into doing so. Anyway, I apologize if I came across as being very annoyed, but it has been an extremely stressful few months. And then to finish off that with a lot of fat and just unfounded certain things I did wrongly.
00:30:52.342 - 00:30:52.890, Speaker D: Okay.
00:30:53.040 - 00:31:23.462, Speaker A: I think I was very technical in how I described the pool. Firstly, okay, I apologize for that. And I assume a lot of context because I've been saying things in my discord and live stream for a long time. So I apologize for that. Secondly is that I understand why people might be confused because it's never seen before, right? In crypto, we have never experimented before with this model before, right? Of open model, launch model. No one done it before, right? And thirdly, the price curve itself. I'll tell you, I'm actually very comfortable with the things.
00:31:23.462 - 00:31:42.140, Speaker A: Let me send you why, if I have successfully delivered a token that's worth this amount, and it has been in the market and withstood all the selling pressures for seven days, I feel very happy. I feel very happy I earned it.
00:31:43.150 - 00:31:43.658, Speaker D: Right.
00:31:43.744 - 00:32:15.238, Speaker A: And if things go wrong and dips below some point, then I don't get anything right. And I feel extremely comfortable with that. In that sense, I think for anyone that wants to. So I'll say one thing with Launchpad before I move on. We are trying to create a new model once that does actually reward the team, but also make sure the team actually stays responsible, not just for the initial pump, but for a sustained amount of time. That's firstly. Okay.
00:32:15.238 - 00:32:42.682, Speaker A: We do actually want. So if you are a team that's looking to launch a token, we want to help you raise, get the money. Okay. Ken? We want to help you do it in a way that is good for you because you get a community, you get everything and you do not leave a community hanging in case things don't go well. Firstly, right? Yeah. And anyone who is interested in improving this model, I'm on Twitter. Wear mail, I'm always available on Twitter.
00:32:42.682 - 00:32:50.882, Speaker A: You see me on Twitter, I'm always available. If you ask me questions, I'm always ready to answer. Post something on my forum, I'll answer you, I promise you.
00:32:50.936 - 00:32:51.442, Speaker D: Okay.
00:32:51.576 - 00:32:56.674, Speaker A: But don't come with bad faith. Okay. We really worked extremely hard last two years.
00:32:56.712 - 00:32:57.602, Speaker D: Okay? Right.
00:32:57.656 - 00:33:06.680, Speaker A: And to do this at a time whereby we are the most vulnerable, I don't think it's good faith. Seriously. People are just like copy and pasting random shit and I don't like that.
00:33:07.050 - 00:33:13.960, Speaker B: And I think we're going to release a white paper before they'll airdrop. But that didn't happen when people expect that.
00:33:14.410 - 00:33:44.206, Speaker A: I don't know, maybe, I think February, I think I wanted to do white paper, but I think I got very caught up actually building a launch pad. So our whole team was trying to build a launch pad and we didn't do it. Anyway, to answer question earlier and stuff, I think what is coming up with this? I think we are looking for really good projects, right? Because we have a really good community distribution. I think the launch is not perfect yet, but we are getting better. Even the Jupyter launch. We learn a lot of things we can do is to help other projects. That's firstly.
00:33:44.206 - 00:33:50.566, Speaker A: So we are looking for great projects to launch on the launch pad because we think that's great. Because that brings so much more excitement to community. I love it.
00:33:50.588 - 00:33:51.110, Speaker D: Right?
00:33:51.260 - 00:34:02.694, Speaker A: And then the second thing that can do is to obviously improve our products, right. I feel extremely happy with our cell products right now. Soap aggregation, the lO, DCA, perps and launchpad, and also gateway.
00:34:02.742 - 00:34:03.434, Speaker D: Right.
00:34:03.632 - 00:34:29.634, Speaker A: So the next step is really to improve those. So I think we have about improving those things over next nine months. We don't need that many new products, but it's just really about making them much better. And thirdly, is that we also want to invest in infra as well, because we are getting to a point whereby, okay, we do need to run a lot of infra, whether it's around interchange infra or whether it's around the vendor infra. So we do need to get to that point.
00:34:29.672 - 00:34:29.970, Speaker D: Right.
00:34:30.040 - 00:35:04.570, Speaker A: And part of the reason why we want to make sure that we had capital moving to this new phase, we are actually going to start moving into a more capital intense phase. So that's what we're going to do as well. Those are plans. So basically a lot more new projects, a lot more high quality projects for Launchpad. Firstly. Secondly, is that to really improve our systems products, thirdly is to really have a much longer term plan for infra needs and also start contributing to the Swana vetticor. And lastly is that I think there are a number of things I really want to drive.
00:35:04.640 - 00:35:04.934, Speaker D: Right.
00:35:04.992 - 00:35:30.726, Speaker A: For example, it's a crazy idea, but I don't see any reason why companies, not crypto companies, the actual companies, cannot lease on chain. Why must they go to Nasdaq? Why must they go to Singapore stock chain? Why must they go to Indonesia? Why can't they list on chain? Right. They can get much better community, much better funding, much better everything. So I don't see why not. Obviously, there's a longer term plan.
00:35:30.908 - 00:35:32.578, Speaker B: You're talking about, like stocks.
00:35:32.754 - 00:35:40.902, Speaker A: Yeah. For example, imagine you are Internet company that's doing well.
00:35:41.036 - 00:35:41.586, Speaker D: Right?
00:35:41.708 - 00:36:02.302, Speaker A: How do you make it possible for you to list on chain versus going to Frankfurt Stock Exchange or something? How do we make it more compelling for you to list on chain? And secondly, obviously, on the flip side, right, how do the on chain participants know that you as a company has the right auditing, has the right certified and all the house stuff.
00:36:02.356 - 00:36:02.960, Speaker D: Right.
00:36:03.890 - 00:36:28.854, Speaker A: But I think if we can bridge a gap, it'd be great because we are on the next frontiers of really merging the off chain world. On chain world. Right. In the stock markets. And then the other thing I really want to do is to really bring as many markets to swan as possible. Because, for example, forex markets, RWA oil markets, it's not assets, by the way. People talk about assets, but assets are not important.
00:36:28.854 - 00:37:21.660, Speaker A: What's important is the markets, because you can have assets, but there's no market that's coinless. Right. So what you need is markets, right? And then what Jupiter does is that Jupyter does a really good job of bringing all those markets together and allowing you to transact across that one transaction. So basically what I want to do is that I want to personally really drive to help a lot of the companies bring more assets, forex and everything into network and working at Cumberland and other guys, right? Because if that happens, then you can literally go from a private market asset to a meme coin and you can do those users to pay for your PayPal or something. So I think the goal is to bring as many market as possible into one network, which is sauna. Because when they're all in sauna, you can execute across all them in an extremely cheap and fast manner. Entrepreneur can be helping with.
00:37:21.660 - 00:37:26.700, Speaker A: We have a lot of things working.
00:37:27.150 - 00:37:32.118, Speaker B: Yeah, it sounds very ambitious. All right, well, thank you so much for coming on Unchained.
00:37:32.294 - 00:37:33.950, Speaker A: Yeah, of course. Thank you.
00:37:34.100 - 00:37:42.190, Speaker B: Don't forget, next up is the weekly news recap today presented by unchained contributor Megan Christensen. Stick around for this week in crypto after this short break.

00:38:17.230 - 00:39:05.050, Speaker E: Thanks for tuning into the weekly news recap. I'm Megan Christensen, a producer here at Unchained. In a major turn of events, FTX, the giant cryptocurrency exchange that filed for bankruptcy in late 2022, informed a bankruptcy judge that it will not be reviving operations. This frees FTX to commit to fully repaying its customers. The failure to restart the exchange underscores how weak its infrastructure was that it could not find a partner willing to put in the money and effort to build upon the remains of what was once the third largest crypto exchange by volume. This move is expected to bring some relief to the numerous customers affected by FTX's collapse. But pegging the value of customer accounts to the date FTX filed for relief left customers complaining that a collapsing FTX drove prices down for nine days before it sought protection.
00:39:05.050 - 00:39:46.658, Speaker E: Also this week, the FTX estate told Bloomberg that it had doubled the entity's cash reserves to $4.4 billion from the 2.3 billion in October. Meanwhile, a judge authorized the sale of FTX's Bahamas properties, including Sam Bankman Fried's $40 million penthouse, as part of the exchange's bankruptcy proceedings. Lastly, in related news, effective Ventures foundation agreed to return about $26.8 million in donations received from FTX. Celsius Network, the cryptocurrency lending platform cofounded by Alex Machinsky that was under chapter Eleven protection, has commenced the distribution of over $3 billion in assets to its creditors as part of its reorganization.
00:39:46.658 - 00:40:31.042, Speaker E: This crucial step, confirmed by the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, coincides with the emergence of Celsius from bankruptcy. In addition to the distribution, Celsius creditors are now the owners of a new bitcoin mining company, Ionic Digital Inc. Created by Celsius with mining operations managed by Hut eight Tether Holdings Limited, the entity behind the popular stablecoin. Tether reported an unprecedented financial performance for the fourth quarter of 2023. The firm's net profits soared to $2.85 billion, a notable milestone in its operational history. This achievement was largely driven by substantial earnings from US treasury securities, contributing approximately $1 billion to the net operating profits.
00:40:31.042 - 00:41:04.274, Speaker E: The remainder of the profits primarily stemmed from the appreciation of the company's bitcoin and gold reserves. The quarter also witnessed remarkable growth in Tether's excess reserves, which climbed by $2.2 billion, reaching a total of over $5.4 billion. These excess reserves are crucial in covering the firm's outstanding unsecured loans, which stood at $4.8 billion at the year's end, thereby addressing past community concerns about potential risk associated with this aspect of Tether's portfolio. For the entire year of 2023, Tether declared a net profit of $6.2
00:41:04.274 - 00:41:50.778, Speaker E: billion. This financial strength was attributed to various sources, including $4 billion from US treasury bonds and other noncrypto investments. The firm's total assets under management included significant holdings in US Treasuries, bitcoin, gold and venture capital investments. Bankrupt crypto lender Genesis reached a settlement agreement with the SEC regarding a civil lawsuit, Bloomberg reported Thursday afternoon. This lawsuit accused Genesis of violating securities regulations through its Gemini earn program. Genesis, a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, has agreed to pay a $21 million civil penalty to resolve these allegations. However, the payment of this penalty is contingent on the company's ability to fully repay its customers and other creditors in its chapter eleven bankruptcy proceedings.
00:41:50.778 - 00:42:28.518, Speaker E: The settlement, pending approval by a bankruptcy judge, addresses claims that Genesis illegally raised funds from investors via the Gemini earn program. This program, operated in collaboration with Gemini Trust Co. Offered interest payments to customers for loaning their digital assets. The SEC had argued that this constituted an offering of unregistered securities. Both Genesis and Gemini have denied any wrongdoing, asserting that the earn program was not a security the program has been terminated. Since then, german police executed one of their largest cryptocurrency seizures, confiscating over €2.1 billion worth of bitcoin.
00:42:28.518 - 00:43:09.386, Speaker E: This operation focused on dismantling an illegal covert streaming service. The seizure at the scale was a major blow to digital piracy networks leveraging cryptocurrencies. Concurrently. In the UK, the police made a significant seizure of nearly 1.8 billion pounds in bitcoin linked to an investment fraud scheme originating in China. This operation was part of a broader investigation that stretched across international borders, highlighting the increased global efforts to track and seize digital assets connected to criminal activities. Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world by volume, now permits larger traders to store assets with two external banks, possibly due to concerns arising from its recent $4.3
00:43:09.386 - 00:43:49.974, Speaker E: billion US regulatory fine. This operational change comes as high volume traders increasingly seek platforms with robust security and stability in a dynamic regulatory environment. Finance has entered into partnerships with Signumbank and Flowbank to custody these assets. These collaborations are geared towards enhancing the access and management of cryptocurrencies for users. Signum bank specializes in digital asset banking, while Flowbank operates as an online bank in Switzerland. On Wednesday, Ripple suffered a significant security breach, with cofounder Chris Larson confirming that his personal accounts were exploited. The hackers stole approximately $113,000,000.
00:43:49.974 - 00:44:30.734, Speaker E: Larson's acknowledgment of the unauthorized transfers has brought attention to the security vulnerabilities. Even high profile individuals in the crypto industries can face. Abracadabra. Money, a decentralized platform, suffered an exploit. This security breach led to the destabilization of magic Internet money, causing it to lose its peg to the US dollar. The exploit was executed through a series of complex transactions that manipulated the price of the collateral in the Ethereum cauldrons, ultimately leading to the unauthorized withdrawal of funds. The immediate impact of this incident was a noticeable dpegging of the MIM token from its intended one to one parity with the US dollar.
00:44:30.734 - 00:45:20.962, Speaker E: MIM went as low as zero 76 before it rebounded to zero 98. Polygon Labs, the development team behind the Polygon blockchain, announced a reduction of its workforce by 19% following a period of rapid expansion during the last cryptocurrency bull run. The layoffs come as the company adjusts to the current market climate and refocuses its strategy for sustainable growth. This decision reflects a broader trend in the tech and crypto industries, where companies are reassessing their growth strategies and workforce needs in response to the changing market conditions. For instance, this week fintech giant PayPal fired nearly 2500 employees for the remaining employees of Polygon Labs. There was good news, however. Polygon concurrently announced that it was giving employees companywide a 15% raise and eliminating geographic differences in pay.
