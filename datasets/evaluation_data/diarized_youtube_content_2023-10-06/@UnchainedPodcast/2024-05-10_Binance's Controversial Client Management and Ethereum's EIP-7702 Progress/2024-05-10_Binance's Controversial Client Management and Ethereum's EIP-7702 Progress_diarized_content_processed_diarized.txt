00:00:00.400 - 00:00:31.634, Speaker A: Welcome to this week's crypto roundup. In today's recap, we explore Binance's handling of allegations against a high value client, the progress of Ethereum's EIP 7702 for its Pectra upgrade, SEC's enforcement against Robinhood crypto, Grayscale's withdrawal of its Ethereum futures ETF application, the rise of fantasy top and pump fun in Defi rankings, the Athena and Bybit partnership to boost USDe and the challenges facing airdrops highlighted by mode's price drop. Thanks for tuning in to the weekly news recap.
00:00:31.714 - 00:00:37.214, Speaker B: Let's begin Binance faces criticism for handling of allegations against a high value client.
00:00:37.634 - 00:01:45.290, Speaker A: According to a report from the Wall Street Journal, Binance's commitment to thwarting suspicious trading was tested when an internal investigation revealed that a high profile client known for a lavish lifestyle, including owning a Lamborghini, was manipulating markets. Despite these findings, Binance chose to retain the client and dismiss the investigator who uncovered the malpractice. This decision sparked concerns among former company insiders, suggesting that Binance prioritized profit generation from large clients over implementing robust market surveillance. Such actions seem contradictory to the platform's stated goal of ensuring a safe and trusted trading environment. The situation reflects a broader issue within the crypto industry, where large exchanges face scrutiny for potentially overlooking manipulative practices to preserve lucrative trading fees. Binance, however, has denied these allegations, asserting a strong commitment to market integrity and user safety regardless of the financial stature of its users. A company spokesperson emphasized their rigorous surveillance framework, designed to combat market abuse and uphold the platform safety.
00:01:45.442 - 00:01:49.042, Speaker B: Vitalik Buterin's EIP 7702 gains momentum for.
00:01:49.058 - 00:03:07.034, Speaker A: Ethereum's Petra upgrade Ethereum improvement Proposal 7702, introduced by co founder Vitalik Buterin and his team, is rapidly gaining traction among developers, suggesting its potential inclusion in Ethereum's next hard fork. Named Pektra. It seeks to enhance Ethereum by allowing externally owned accounts to temporarily transform into smart contract wallets for a single transaction, reverting to their original state thereafter. The proposal emerges from extensive discussions within the Ethereum community, particularly around earlier improvement proposals like EIP 3074 and EIP 4337. EIP 7702 is designed to refine the path toward what's termed account abstraction, aiming to convert all eoas into smart account wallets, thereby boosting both security and user experience. Lucas Shore, co founder of wallet infrastructure maker Safe, highlighted EIP 7700 two's advantages over EIP 3074, noting its leaner approach and compatibility with ERC 4337, which prevents the emergence of fragmented ecosystems within Ethereum. Additionally, EIP 7702 addresses concerns about quantum computing threats by enabling the use of stronger cryptographic schemes and quantum resistant technologies.
00:03:07.414 - 00:03:11.590, Speaker B: Robinhood crypto faces SEC enforcement Action Robinhood.
00:03:11.702 - 00:04:08.866, Speaker A: A prominent retail trading platform, has received a wells notice from the US securities and Exchange Commission regarding the crypto tokens traded on its platform issued on May 4. The notice is a preliminary step by the SEC to bring enforcement action indicating possible violations of securities law. Robinhood's chief legal officer, Dan Gallagher, expressed confidence in the legitimacy of their listings. He stated, we firmly believe that the assets listed on our platform are not securities. The company is prepared to defend its stance, with CEO Vlad Tenev indicating readiness to contest the matter in court if necessary. This move comes amidst a broader SEC crackdown on the digital currency industry, with the regulator asserting that most cryptocurrency tokens are securities. Robinhood, which has previously attempted to register as a special purpose broker dealer for digital assets, faced a setback in its efforts and has since delisted certain tokens like Solana, Cardano and Polygon.
00:04:08.866 - 00:04:16.494, Speaker A: Following the SEC's action, Robinhood shares experienced initial volatility but ultimately rose by 2%.
00:04:17.114 - 00:04:20.474, Speaker B: Grayscale withdraws Ethereum futures ETF application amid.
00:04:20.514 - 00:05:37.144, Speaker A: Regulatory uncertainty Grayscale has unexpectedly withdrawn its application for an Ethereum Futures trust ETF with the SEC, a move that has puzzled many. Initially filed on September 19, 2023, the application was retracted on May 3 after the SEC delayed its decision three times, with a final verdict due on May 30. James Seyffert, a Bloomberg ETF analyst, commented on the withdrawal, suggesting that the original filing may have been a strategic move by Greyscale. This was essentially a Trojan horse filing to create the same circumstances that allowed Greyscale to win the GBTC lawsuit, Seyfart said. However, he also noted that this early withdrawal might have been a way to avoid aggravating the SEC, as it would reduce the regulator's workload. The broader sentiment around the approval of a spot ether remains pessimistic, with only 7% of market participants on polymarket believing an approval will occur by the end of May. Fantasy top and pump fund surge and Defi rankings by fees generated two relatively new platforms, Fantasytop and pump fun, ascended to the 6th and 7th positions among crypto protocols based on fees generated on Wednesday.
00:05:37.144 - 00:06:23.932, Speaker A: These platforms, only a few months old, have quickly amassed significant trading volumes and user engagement. Fantasy Top, a decentralized exchange specializing in trading cards featuring prominent crypto personalities, now sits just behind Tron and ahead of the BNB smart chain Dex pancake swap in the rankings. Meanwhile, Pump Fun, known for its meme coin launch and trading services, currently occupies the 8th spot. The game Fantasy Top has turned crypto influencers into Ethereum NFT trading cards. Players earn crypto and in game prizes by assembling lineups of these cards with their value. Driven by real world Twitter engagement, this inventive approach has captivated crypto Twitter, leading to a surge in the platform's popularity and fee generation.
00:06:24.108 - 00:06:26.188, Speaker B: Athena and Bybit Partnership aims to boost.
00:06:26.236 - 00:07:30.912, Speaker A: USDE growth Athena has partnered with the cryptocurrency exchange Bybit to enhance the use of its synthetic dollar USDE. This collaboration will allow USDE to be used as collateral for trading perpetual futures on Bybit, offering a yield on this collateral, a feature uncommon among other stablecoins such as USDT. Bybit's integration includes trading BTC, ETH and SOL through its unified trading account, as well as adding BTC, USDE and ETH USDe spot pairs. Additionally, USDE will be part of bibits earn platform, facilitating launch pool farming for new tokens despite a promising start with rapid market cap growth to $2.39 billion, USDE's growth has recently stagnated. Guy young, founder and CEO of Athena Labs, highlighted the potential impact of this partnership on the stablecoin market, suggesting it could challenge the dominance of traditional stablecoins by providing benefits for crypto native users and optimizing trading efficiency.
00:07:31.088 - 00:07:34.120, Speaker B: Mode's price plunge highlights challenges among airdrops.
00:07:34.232 - 00:08:23.954, Speaker A: The market's latest airdrop saw mode's native token drop over 60% immediately after release, signaling potential issues with the overall airdrop strategy. Other platforms, such as Kamino, Renzo Parkl Wormhole, and friend tech have experienced similar declines post Airdrop, underscoring a growing skepticism about the effectiveness of this approach. Recently, community reactions have played a significant role in shaping airdrop outcomes. For instance, the Eigen foundation faced intense backlash for its initial distribution plan, prompting a revised allocation to appease angry users. Uniswap founder Hayden Adams has weighed in on the topic, advising projects against being stingy with token distributions and urging them to create real liquidity from day one. And that's it.
