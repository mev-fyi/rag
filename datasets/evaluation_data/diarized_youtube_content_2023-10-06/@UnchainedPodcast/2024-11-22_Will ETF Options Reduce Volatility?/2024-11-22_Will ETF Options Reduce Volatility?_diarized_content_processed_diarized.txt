00:00:00.440 - 00:00:39.235, Speaker A: I think more than that, though, what will reduce volatility is the ETF growing, because the people who are using these ETFs clearly are not running at the drop of a hat. They're pretty strong hands. We've seen it, right? I've argued this on Twitter for like, months that the boomers are actually, in some cases, the stronger hands than the natives. I've argued with people plenty about that fact. But people who use ETFs are just they're not dumb retail. They're really smart people, and they know about behavior. And this exposure is probably a small portion of their portfolio.
00:00:39.235 - 00:00:50.435, Speaker A: It isn't like their whole nest egg. So they're not going to overly panic on a drawdown. I think that the mainstream vacation, the etfication is probably going to lower volatility.
