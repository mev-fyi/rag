00:00:00.160 - 00:00:32.816, Speaker A: The vast majority of VCs out there in crypto are pretty bad because the bar for quality was so low to enter back in like 2019, 2020. So there's self select for bad projects that come to market at valuations that are way above what they should be. So it just ends up being a one way ticket for those VCs to get to cash out those projects. So that kind of phenomenon formed a very cynical view of what VCs are. But I think that's why we're very selective in terms of, you know, who we work with. We love kind of co investing with Dragonfly for instance, because of the kind of similar taste that we have in terms of selecting what we hope ideally are good.
00:00:32.888 - 00:00:34.192, Speaker B: That's why we brought you on the pod.
00:00:34.336 - 00:00:37.136, Speaker C: Yeah, we paid him to say this. To be clear.
00:00:37.208 - 00:00:38.000, Speaker B: Not a dividend.
00:00:38.080 - 00:00:39.280, Speaker D: It's a tale of two Kwan.
00:00:39.360 - 00:00:41.952, Speaker C: Now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet.
00:00:42.016 - 00:00:44.480, Speaker B: Generally speaking, airdrops are kind of pointless anyways.
00:00:44.640 - 00:00:47.376, Speaker C: I named trading firms who were very involved.
00:00:47.488 - 00:00:50.096, Speaker D: Alec Eth is the ultimate defi.
00:00:50.128 - 00:01:03.002, Speaker C: Protocols are the antidote to this problem. Hello everybody. Welcome to the chopping block. Every couple weeks the four of us get together and give the industry insiders perspective on the crypto topics of the day. So quick intros. First you got Tom the Defi maven and master of memes.
00:01:03.146 - 00:01:04.202, Speaker B: Hello everyone.
00:01:04.386 - 00:01:07.786, Speaker C: Next we've got Tarun, the Giga brain and Grand Poobah at Gauntlet.
00:01:07.978 - 00:01:08.750, Speaker D: Yo.
00:01:09.890 - 00:01:14.330, Speaker C: Joining us today we have a special guest, Jason Choi, startup tycoon at Tangent.
00:01:14.410 - 00:01:16.550, Speaker A: Hey everybody, thanks for having me.
00:01:17.250 - 00:01:34.370, Speaker C: Great to have you. And I'm Haseeb, the head hype man at Dragonfly. So we're early stage investors in crypto, but I want to caveat that nothing we say here is an investment advice, legal advice, or even less life advice. Please see chopping block at XYZ for more disclosures. So it's been a very politics filled week. I actually don't know. So Jason, you're based in Singapore I believe.
00:01:34.370 - 00:01:40.650, Speaker C: How much is US politics a topic of conversation in like Singaporean circles?
00:01:40.990 - 00:01:59.470, Speaker A: Oh, it's everything now. It's literally everything. I think every day everybody's just following us hours. So I'm usually operating in US hours for the past few weeks. It's a joke that we've kind of turned into a macro fund because we just fed watching and just like watching all the political debates. It's my least favorite part of the crypto cycle to be honest.
00:02:00.290 - 00:02:10.410, Speaker C: Okay, so you're so you're following the debates, you're following all the barbs. You're following like, okay, that, so you can't get away from this. No matter where in the world you are, you can't get away. Okay.
00:02:10.490 - 00:02:11.946, Speaker A: No, not at all. Not at all.
00:02:12.018 - 00:02:17.866, Speaker C: That's unfortunate. You said, have you been following World Liberty Financial, the Trump family defi thing?
00:02:18.018 - 00:02:32.430, Speaker A: Only tangentially. I heard that it was something to do with aave and that that kind of coincides with I think a pretty big revival in the AAVE price for the Token, but other than that, haven't really been following that, that specific project. Is there something that we should be paying attention to?
00:02:34.170 - 00:02:35.490, Speaker C: Is there? Guys?
00:02:35.650 - 00:02:50.350, Speaker D: Nobody knows, you know, you know, all, all. All I know is anytime I say anything about this, I always get DMS that are kind of wild. So I've, I, I've recused myself from any comment at all. Doing with World Financial.
00:02:50.810 - 00:02:53.288, Speaker C: You gotta give us some. What's the, what are the comments you're getting?
00:02:53.394 - 00:03:17.280, Speaker D: I think like in some of the prior episodes I said something like, oh, it's like a rug pull or a kind of poor man's exit scam. And, and you know, of course there were some people who really didn't like that characterization. So I, I rescind my statements. Not because I don't believe them, just because I don't need the cantankerous.
00:03:17.940 - 00:03:22.252, Speaker C: Yeah, okay. I did notice the YouTube comments were getting pretty spicy.
00:03:22.396 - 00:03:26.700, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's kind of why I'm like, actually I don't cover this anymore.
00:03:28.160 - 00:04:07.204, Speaker C: Well, well, ly for you, there is nothing in this week that's really noteworthy about World Liberty Financial. But I'm sure there will be more coming once we get more details about their game plan. But. So one story that was dominating the news cycle this week was friend tech. So Friend tech, you guys might remember it was an og. Well, I don't know that og, but it was a, a social, social fi project that basically allowed you to bet on creators and join their creator chats by buying their token. It was a speculative frenzy that I think was mostly in 2023, largely through the summer and then it kind of started trickling down eventually.
00:04:07.204 - 00:04:38.510, Speaker C: They launched a token this year and that token has not performed particularly well from when it came out. It's kind of been down, only more or less. So the Token is down 96% from the all time high and it's, it was originally trading around 230 million, fully diluted valuation. It's now trading around 10 million. So, so everyone has has kind of had their critiques of Friendch over the years. That's not what this story is primarily about. About a week ago, or, sorry, about four days ago, the project transferred control of the.
00:04:38.510 - 00:05:04.710, Speaker C: The contracts to a null address, basically meaning they burned their own admin keys. Um, immediately on this. On this news, the friend token price plummeted, and people claimed that Friend Tech is exit scamming, quote, unquote. And exit scamming in this case means that, you know, they launched a token and now they're leaving and they're abandoning the project and it's all vaporware because it doesn't work. Now, the. The interesting wrinkle here is that Friend Tech did not sell their token. None of the token went to investors.
00:05:04.710 - 00:05:32.572, Speaker C: From what we understand, none of the token was even owned by the team. So it was a purely, quote, unquote, fair launched token, but never. And nevertheless, the team also went and further tweeted that we have no plans to shutter or discontinue. The application is still running. Everybody seems to have interpreted this as Friend Tech somehow, quote unquote, rugging or, you know, just exit exiting or quitting or whatever. But according to the team, they have not done that. That being said, it's.
00:05:32.572 - 00:06:01.328, Speaker C: It's triggered this broader conversation about what are the obligations of teams that build crypto products and that launch tokens. And part of the reason why it's such a weird story is because Friend didn't sell their token to retail and they didn't hold the tokens themselves that. That they issued with friend tech. So I want to go around the horn here and get reactions to the Friend Tech drama and what you think it means more broadly for what the obligations are of entrepreneurs who launch products in crypto. Jason, why don't we start with you?
00:06:01.464 - 00:06:08.500, Speaker A: Yeah. I don't know if I'm a masochist, so I'm down really bad on friend tech. Well, not really, really bad, but I did buy the tokens.
00:06:10.040 - 00:06:11.456, Speaker C: You didn't just get the tokens?
00:06:11.568 - 00:06:16.720, Speaker B: No, I had a big airdrop. Right. I mean, you had like. You were active. I owned your. Your token. I was in the club.
00:06:16.760 - 00:06:35.068, Speaker A: Yeah, I own your key as well. And I was quite active on the platform. I was, like, unabashedly kind of excited about the platform when it first came out. So I actually bought the tokens. I think I was one of the largest holders in the world, at least on the public wallet this. So now I'm like, down 96%, but I would still like to. From Razer's perspective.
00:06:35.068 - 00:06:57.484, Speaker A: He launched an app that we liked that people actually used, at least for a while. People loved it. He kind of fair launched the token. It wasn't like it was a massive insider sale or anything. I think what he fucked up on was the retention of the users and also the timing of the token launch, which we can get into. But I think all in all, this was very, very crypto. I think it was just disappointing because the kind of expectations were so high for the product.
00:06:57.572 - 00:06:59.676, Speaker C: But what do you mean it's very crypto? What does that mean?
00:06:59.748 - 00:07:33.276, Speaker A: It's very crypto in the sense that it was an anonymous developer. We had a lot of these in the last defi summer, but not really this cycle. We have an anonymous developer, built an application that everybody kind of congregated around and is very crypto in the sense that crypto tends to have one topic that kind of captures everyone's attention. So everyone just talked about the same thing for like four weeks. So that was kind of the friend tech moment. And from that we also engendered a lot of clones, right? You have, I think Starz arena and Avax, you have a bunch of other clones. So that, that to me reminded me a lot of early days of defi summer.
00:07:33.276 - 00:07:39.960, Speaker A: So I was excited that, hey, maybe we could get a wave of new social applications from this. But that didn't really happen just yet.
00:07:40.080 - 00:07:41.380, Speaker C: Tom, what's your take?
00:07:41.840 - 00:08:07.247, Speaker B: Yeah, I think there's kind of a spectrum here of sort of team obligations or rug pulliness. And I think kind of on the most rugged pulliness would be just think like the shittiest ICOs where it's like you raise a bunch of money and you sell all these promises and wishes and then you never ship anything and the team kind of gradually fades away. And I think those are the teams that the kind of SEC ended up going after in 2017. And then you have, you know, mean.
00:08:07.300 - 00:08:11.382, Speaker D: Coin or NFTs or NFT like, like the stoner cats of the world.
00:08:11.486 - 00:08:35.942, Speaker B: I see. I mean, I think NFT is also a spectrum. You know, stoner cats, you know, maybe don't promise that you're going to go, you know, develop a TV show, but if you're just selling a JPEG or whatever, fine. And you have kind of meme coins, right, where it's like, okay, someone launches it, but there's no expectation or promise or there's not really sort of a, you know, vision is just like, it is what it is. You're buying on the open market. If you want to buy Great. If you don't, also, fine.
00:08:35.942 - 00:09:25.254, Speaker B: But that is sort of the game. And like, you know, forensic, the team did not get token allocation. They built the thing. It works. It feels weird that people are almost like more mad at Racer and the franchise team than like these other teams, even though I would say arguably they, you know, or rather it feels weird that there's like a larger onus on Racer for having actually built something than any of the other teams who didn't do that. I think there are weirdly misaligned incentives, though, in that it's like by the team not retaining the token, they were monetizing through the fees, right? And they made 52mil in fees from people swapping on the platform and sending it to the team. And so normally those would go into a DAO treasury and maybe the team would get a grant from the treasury.
00:09:25.254 - 00:09:53.394, Speaker B: And it felt given anything like, okay, actually the monetization vector on frontek is totally privatized and the team is just cashing in all these swap fees and the protocol stuff. In another world, this is exactly what people want. It's decentralized. It's no admin. You kind of do it yourself and no one's going to step in and rug pull you. And maybe depending on what side of the bed people get on or how the momentum builds, it's now become this big negative. So I don't know.
00:09:53.394 - 00:10:00.802, Speaker B: I think there are much more egregious examples of this happening in crypto. And so I don't know why the Friend Tech team is kind of getting called out.
00:10:00.906 - 00:10:46.730, Speaker C: So to your point, Tom, a lot of the reason why people are mad is because everybody knows that Friend Tech, the company, made 50 million plus in the swap fees over the course of the year and a half, and none of it has gone into the Friend Tech token. And the claim, at least I saw HASU made this claim, I think most provocatively, is that when you drop a token, you sort of give an implication that everybody understands that this is going to be a thing that accrues value in the universe of this product. And the reality is that it never really accrued. I mean, what's the value of. It's like a token for joining clubs, I guess, or something. I can't remember what the token does at this point, but it's not the thing that accrues value from the business. The business accrued $52 million of value, and that's it, the end.
00:10:46.730 - 00:10:59.102, Speaker C: And so there is a. Or at least the steel man for this side of the argument. Is that there is a violation of expectations that they knew people had when they decide to do it this way.
00:10:59.206 - 00:11:36.252, Speaker B: I definitely see that. I think again, in a more maybe conventional project where there is a team allocation and the team sells a token and there's money going into a multisig and the team just runs away with the money. Or again, we've kind of talked about this in the ICO context. I think people have more of a reason to be upset. This was all very transparent. Nothing changed from inception to now in terms of where the fees were going, how the fees were being paid out, how the system actually worked. I definitely at a high level and at a very superficial level, I can see why people would think that and think they're bad.
00:11:36.252 - 00:11:49.700, Speaker B: But this feels like a. There are idiosyncrasies to the way frontek was set up. That makes me feel like you can't get mad. It was effectively a mean token. That was always the case. That was very obvious if you did any modicum of research. And maybe people didn't and now they're mad.
00:11:49.700 - 00:11:56.880, Speaker B: But I agree for a lot of those other scenarios I see has to point out, I would agree if someone launched a DEFI protocol and kind of did this exact same thing.
00:11:57.180 - 00:12:34.144, Speaker A: I feel like a lot of the problems could have been solved if they just kind of launched a token later. I think they basically just launched a token way too early, before there was any value accrual mechanism. And they didn't really hit any type of product market fit loop. I think there was a lot of virality in the beginning of the application, but they didn't figure out like two big issues. I think one that people were citing was that itself selects for very small groups, for instance. Right. Because when buy the keys it's all baked into the the pricing curve so that you very quickly price out people out of out of friend groups because keys will rise to like 5e very, very quickly.
00:12:34.144 - 00:13:10.818, Speaker A: And suddenly, you know, it's very hard to scale a group beyond like 5:30 people. So they never really figured out that scaling part. And then the second part is I think the value derived for creators on the platform is upfront. Right? You basically make money from fees when someone buy your keys and you're not really incentivized to keep providing value once somebody's in that group because you're not really making money as people engage. And you could say that, okay, if you don't engage, people can sell your keys, but you're also not really that disincentivized to not engage, because the creators themselves may not even hold the keys. Because unlike some of the other social platforms, the creators were not given keys in the beginning. You have to actually go and buy your keys.
00:13:10.818 - 00:13:38.940, Speaker A: And I know a lot of creators didn't buy their own keys, so those were kind of two big product questions that they haven't answered. I think if they figured that out before they launched the token, then it might have maintained a bit of excitement. But if I remember correctly, they launched the token when the user curve was kind of cliffing off. So it was almost like a Hail Mary attempt to get people back, because they know this promise of an airdrop could get people excited about the platform again. So maybe they rushed the token, but maybe there was.
00:13:38.980 - 00:13:59.536, Speaker C: But, I mean, it wasn't a Hail Mary. Like, it worked, right? It did get this big spike of users and people coming back on. I remember when all of us got back on the platform, we're like, oh, there's new features and there's this club thing. And it was just so broken and things just didn't work. And, like, it was super intuitive. And it's like, wait, why am I doing this? So I think they. I wouldn't consider that a Hail Mary.
00:13:59.536 - 00:14:31.730, Speaker C: I would say that they kind of wasted the second bullet that they had, which was bringing people back onto the platform for the airdrop. And it's a tough spot to be in as a startup, which is that you've kind of got this one moment. It's like a comedian getting on TV for the first time, and it's like, if you fuck this up, you're never invited back on any show ever. And that sort of feels like what Friend Tech had is that like, oh, we finally got booked for the biggest show in Crypto and they blew it. And I think after that, it's really, really hard to have another moment. Tarun, what's your. What's your.
00:14:31.730 - 00:14:33.458, Speaker C: What's your take on the frantic situation?
00:14:33.554 - 00:14:38.978, Speaker D: I have the least emotional connection, I think, the way the rest of the commentators.
00:14:39.074 - 00:14:41.282, Speaker C: You were active on Friend. Why? Why? Why?
00:14:41.386 - 00:14:46.630, Speaker D: A little bit, but not, not, not. I wouldn't call myself a creator. I'd call myself a consumer.
00:14:47.930 - 00:14:51.426, Speaker C: And I had your key. You were. You were active. What are you talking about?
00:14:51.498 - 00:15:23.702, Speaker D: Sure, I like, I guess in the beginning for, like, a little bit, but it just, like, somehow, then it just became this thing where, like, people are buying your key to, like, ask you questions. And it was like, I don't have. I can't just, like, be a Quora answer, like, chatgpt exists. Stop fucking asking me questions. But I guess, like, the thing I would say that is a little weird is like, Friend Tank actually got the Pump Fun Meta just wrong. Like, you know, like, but they, they, they created it first. Arguably.
00:15:23.702 - 00:15:58.216, Speaker D: This idea of like, burning the key, taking the fees is exactly the entire Meme Coin game, right? It's like the person puts in liquidity, they burn the key, the fees get kept split between the creator and the. The platform. In some ways, that's exactly what Friendch did, but they kind of did it in a way that, like, had no ability to. That. That was like, almost a little too early because it felt like the Friend Tech thing suddenly became the meta on Solana and just like took off and it just was. That wasn't true for them. Right?
00:15:58.288 - 00:16:17.220, Speaker C: To Jason's point, I think what Friend figured out, or, sorry, what Pump Fun figured out, is that you start with a bonding curve, but then you can't stay bonding curve forever because it just, it just like pops out and you have to, you have to say, okay, we've, we've hit this inflection point now we're going to convert, you know, Ansem's keys to be an AMM or something else instead of being.
00:16:17.620 - 00:16:46.236, Speaker D: And kind of. This is kind of why I think the, the, the people might be annoyed at Friend Tech is like, they also now see this thing in the future that did better and like a mechanism that did better. And so it's easy to hate the one. The initial one, but I feel like they were on the right track, right, to that, to, to that in the sense that they kind of were. They kind. You could argue Friend Tech kind of figured out the Meme Coin stuff before the Meme coins started taking off.
00:16:46.308 - 00:16:52.928, Speaker C: That's an interesting claim. Um, I think it's like, not quite right. I mean, it was speculative for sure.
00:16:53.064 - 00:17:05.180, Speaker D: Um, but I, I kind of think the rooms. Yeah, but like, the social stuff seemed very fake. Like at some point I remember going back in and all my key holders were bots asking me the same question like 500 times.
00:17:05.720 - 00:17:07.392, Speaker C: Why were they asking you questions?
00:17:07.536 - 00:17:30.719, Speaker D: I don't know. It's just like I, I think they were hoping that based on how much they were engaging, they would get a bigger airdrop, because this was like people trying to figure out how to airdrop farm. It was like some, some. Something was very weird that was going on and, and it, it felt a little fake at some point. Like, I think in the beginning it started as a. You know, the, the rooms were kind of an interesting, you know, unique thing. But then at some point, I think that.
00:17:30.839 - 00:17:34.899, Speaker C: I think true. Maybe you just hate your fans. Have you considered that as an explanation?
00:17:35.479 - 00:17:38.559, Speaker B: Are you telling those are people and very offensive. Yeah.
00:17:38.599 - 00:17:42.619, Speaker C: You apologize, Tarun. You might be the one who's a bot. I don't know what to tell you.
00:17:44.200 - 00:17:47.408, Speaker D: All right. Maybe I should just start an OnlyFans and see if it works.
00:17:47.584 - 00:17:50.912, Speaker C: Hey, OnlyFans key now.
00:17:50.936 - 00:18:00.464, Speaker A: The moment I thought they actually broke into mainstream was when the OnlyFans people started coming onto Friendtime. Because there was a moment when it wasn't just crypto native circle jerk anymore. It was like actual OnlyFans.
00:18:00.592 - 00:18:04.580, Speaker D: It's true. But then OnlyFans somehow got 8 billion in revenue.
00:18:05.560 - 00:18:11.300, Speaker A: Instead, 80% of them went to creators as well, not the founders.
00:18:11.440 - 00:18:34.000, Speaker B: They did have some homegrown talent on FrontTech. There was like, Levi and some other folks that kind of got big on the platform. I don't really know what happened to those people, but I feel like that is a good signal of something happening on creator platforms and that you can have people who basically make their own enterprise through the platform itself.
00:18:34.820 - 00:19:08.262, Speaker C: Yeah, it was definitely the early shoots of something that could have worked, but it felt like the frantic team didn't iterate enough on the core ideas of the product. I think they sort of saw that, like, oh, people love this. It's going crazy. Obviously, their infrastructure was just incredibly bad, just embarrassingly terrible. They were way too slow to add features and make the chat experience good. But I think they almost got caught in their own trap of a product that started working and it sort of convinced them to stay very close to where they started. Right.
00:19:08.262 - 00:19:42.960, Speaker C: Like, friend tech didn't really evolve outside of the. Oh, okay. It's, you know, you chat to people who own your key and that's it. And we sort of, you know, I don't think they were willing to experiment enough to find a new meta. And maybe it was something that was really closer in spirit to Meme Coins. Because at a certain point, yeah, like this idea that, okay, you're going to be early to join a group chat with somebody. Like, yeah, I mean, to your point, Tarun, I kind of experienced the same thing, which is that I just kind of, you know, got fatigued with the idea of, like, okay, I open an app and I answer questions from random people every day.
00:19:42.960 - 00:19:50.836, Speaker C: And, you know, it's just not. It's not. It's not that fun. It's not that different. Doesn't. It's not dynamic. It got really Repetitive.
00:19:50.836 - 00:19:58.612, Speaker C: And then the questions you get, initially the questions are very interesting. And then the questions become like, oh, you know, what token do you think is going up? What are you bullish on?
00:19:58.796 - 00:20:20.040, Speaker D: Exactly. That. That stuff was annoying. I also just kind of found the, the Racer Twitter presence during that time was just like a little bit obnoxious. You know, to be honest, that, I'm not gonna lie, that made me stop using it. Also, it's like reading Racer's Twitter, I was like, okay, I'm done here. Because I thought Racer's Twitter used to be funny.
00:20:20.040 - 00:20:30.260, Speaker D: And then it started being like, I hate all these people who, who think I'm like robbing them. And then it's, you know, at some point I was like, yeah, but they're your users. I don't know what you, what else you expected.
00:20:30.670 - 00:20:38.982, Speaker C: I've heard there's a lot of drama around Racer. He's a pretty volatile person. Obviously you can see that from Twitter, but I think that's also true from people who've interacted with him.
00:20:39.086 - 00:21:04.816, Speaker D: Personally, I only meant it more as like, I used to love Racer's Twitter. I was always like very deep cut kind of esoterica. But then once he started friend tech, it kind of like ruined his content. And then I was like, okay, so clearly not only was his product like not making me make any good content on it, it made the creator get worse at making his good content. Like, that sucks. That's like a lose, lose situation forever.
00:21:04.848 - 00:21:09.952, Speaker B: You had to be by the key. You had to be in the razor room for the good content, the public stuff, you know, not giving away for.
00:21:09.976 - 00:21:12.784, Speaker D: Free, that's smart, that's hard.
00:21:12.952 - 00:21:15.020, Speaker C: Start them on the drip and then bring them in.
00:21:16.360 - 00:21:21.504, Speaker D: Yeah, I don't know. I really, I really. I missed the old Racer Twitter account. I still, I still think about it sometimes.
00:21:21.552 - 00:21:23.180, Speaker C: I think it got banned or something.
00:21:23.760 - 00:21:27.528, Speaker B: The original one, but then alt, I think just went private and then.
00:21:27.584 - 00:22:00.056, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So his new account is private anyway. Yeah, whatever. I think in a sense friend tech is sort of a stand in for a broader conversation that's happening because the reality is that, yeah, friend tech, actually they're not rug pulling and Racer's still there. Whatever. There's all this weirdness around friend tech itself, but I guess I want to focus in the question about how founders in crypto are supposed to throw in the towel. It's very normal in startups for startups to shut down and everybody, I think, in the investor side is going through this.
00:22:00.056 - 00:22:43.892, Speaker C: Of startups from an earlier vintage from the 2020 era, the 2018 era, finally running out of steam and realizing, hey, we're not going to make it. This thing is never going to be what we want it to be. And it's time to exit stage right and crypto. I think it's a weird place for how you shut down things, I think in, in normal because your token will never die. Well, there's that, there's that, but there's just no norms, right? There's no like playbook about how you, how you exit, how you quit, like what your obligations are. So curious what, what have you guys seen in terms of companies that are navigating this? Because I have a few portfolio companies that are going through this and the, the thing I see across the board is that nobody really knows how they're supposed to do it.
00:22:43.996 - 00:22:55.062, Speaker D: It is unfortunate our one co host who should have the strongest opinion of this on this topic is not here this week given, given that he has done it well.
00:22:55.086 - 00:23:19.072, Speaker C: But, but Jason, you're you know, a tangent which is the fund that you run is a very early stage incubator kind of fund. So I have to imagine you see a lot of this just because, you know, at the very earliest stages a lot of things are very hit or miss. Some things never go on to raise the subsequent round. What do you see? Like if you had to give advice or playbook to a founder, what would you tell them is like, hey, if you think it's not working, here's what you're supposed to do.
00:23:19.256 - 00:24:12.834, Speaker A: It's actually very easy in the very early stages because there's no token. The moment you launch a token, you suddenly instead of having like four or five stakeholders that are like angel investors and maybe one lead VC, you suddenly have like 20,000 if you're very decentralized or like a few thousand stakeholders that you have to contend with. So in the very early stages, a lot of the wind downs basically just look like, hey, we're going to work with our lawyers to wind down the entity, we're going to kind of refund our investors pro rata and that's pretty much it. It's a very, very straightforward process. I think the moment you have a token then it becomes very, very difficult. So I think you solve the problem by kind of going back to what I was talking about earlier, which is timing your token launch. Right? You don't really launch your token unless you are ready to inject steroids into your go to market until you know that you've hit some form of product market fit and you really want to kind of add some fuel to this growth but.
00:24:12.834 - 00:24:45.236, Speaker A: And hopefully by then your project isn't really at the stage where it's going to completely die off. Now that being said, there was one example. I think they're going through legal proceedings so I can't really name what it is, but they did kind of wind down, I think last cycle and they actually are in the process of figuring out how to I think almost sunset the token and then refund professors pro rata. So there might be more details on that once the whole process is wrapped up. But yeah, tldr, once you have a token, it's kind of fucked. But before you have a token, it's very easy.
00:24:45.348 - 00:24:56.372, Speaker C: Do you know examples of tokens that have wound down like FTT still exists, it still trades, despite the fact that obviously nothing will ever happen to it. The original Luna, it's a meme coin.
00:24:56.436 - 00:24:57.588, Speaker D: What are you talking about?
00:24:57.724 - 00:25:01.508, Speaker C: I mean, clearly they think that it's tied to something that's happening with the bankruptcy.
00:25:01.604 - 00:25:03.540, Speaker A: I guess Luna is still around as well.
00:25:03.580 - 00:25:09.714, Speaker C: Yeah, Luna 1 or I guess now it's called Luna 2 or. No, which one is it? Is the original Luna Luna 1 or is it Luna 2?
00:25:09.802 - 00:25:38.566, Speaker B: I think Luna. There's Luna Classic and then Luna Classic, that's the nomenclature we prefer in crypto, is the classic. But I mean this actually happened this week. I think Vega, they're like a derivatives, decentralized derivatives platform that has its own chain. They put forth the proposal to basically sunset the chain and wind it down and similar kind of thing. I mean again, it's presented as sort of a community vote opt in thing, but it's also like the team is kind of throwing in the towel and kind of stepping away.
00:25:38.638 - 00:25:42.278, Speaker C: I think it reminds me Faye was the other feh.
00:25:42.374 - 00:26:29.826, Speaker B: Yeah, they did sort of the buyback scheme, which is also a good way to do it. Rari. Yep, it reminds me a little bit of kind of like the discussion around sort of IoT smart home kind of devices when the company that manufactures them goes defunct or wants to deprecate them, but they're reliant on some third party server to actually give them instructions and keep them operational. And people always get pissed. It's like why did you brick my device that I spent $1,000 on? You should be open sourcing it and let me run my own server if I want to do that. And I think the best companies, if they can do that, there are obviously costs and legal headaches in actually open sourcing that kind of stuff, and very few teams do it. But I think if you can, ideally that's kind of the best path.
00:26:29.826 - 00:26:47.106, Speaker B: And I think in crypto there's probably a similar kind of analog where it's like, if you want to do a community takeover kind of thing, great, open source, the front end and let people do it themselves and let people govern it, you can go do that. But I think if you just kind of do a unilateral wind down, it's a little bit trickier.
00:26:47.298 - 00:27:16.108, Speaker C: Yeah, that's a good point. And in order to get there, it does require full decentralization, or at least being pretty close to full decentralization. If you think of something like friend tech. Like friend tech, they have servers, they host the chat messages they do. There's all this stuff that actually creates a functioning app. And friend tech without the app is kind of nothing. It's like, what are you even talking about? What is friend tech without an app? So I think for some things it's more plausible than others, but I think it's actually quite rare to have a product that is at full decentralization.
00:27:16.108 - 00:27:33.196, Speaker C: And sunsets like I think that I have almost never seen. I mean, I guess Fey is an example. I guess maybe Rari as well are examples of that. But it's very, very rare. Right. Most of the time what happens is that it's like eth classic or one of these things that just. Yeah.
00:27:33.196 - 00:27:38.076, Speaker C: As long as somebody out there is willing to run the infrastructure, it still exists and can continue to trade forever.
00:27:38.188 - 00:27:38.428, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:27:38.444 - 00:28:13.484, Speaker A: And I guess the bar for what's considered dead in tokens is quite different as well. So you guys say that the tokens never die, but I think there will always be some people that trade some token that's tied to some sort of debt app. But if you look at the liquidity of those things, there's probably like $30 worth of liquidity. So if something trading like $30 a day and if still trading at like a $5 million valuation, is it still alive? I think that probably doesn't pass the bar. So the tokens, yes, they're still on chain and they might even still be on some exchanges somewhere if there's someone seeding liquidity for them. But by most definitions, they're basically dead.
00:28:13.642 - 00:28:31.656, Speaker C: Okay, so I want to pivot a little bit to talking about a conversation that's been very active on Twitter that Jason, I wanted to get your take on. So at tangent, my understanding is that you guys are both doing early stage startup investing and you're Also doing liquid markets and on chain activity. Is that correct?
00:28:31.768 - 00:28:32.536, Speaker A: Yeah, that's right.
00:28:32.608 - 00:29:36.906, Speaker C: Okay, so there's been a conversation that's been very active on Twitter, and we've talked about it a little bit on the show, but I wanted to pull you into it, talking about the dynamic between VC funds and liquid funds. And I think much of it traces to a tweet that was originally put out by Arthur Chong, where he claimed that at this stage in crypto, VC funds are net extractive to crypto, and they're taking more money out of the crypto ecosystem than they're putting in. And I think that the intuition behind this is that, well, the VC funds, you know, they fund new projects, they invest in them at low valuations. Then those projects, they mature, they get big, they go launch on the big exchanges, and then the VC sell their tokens, and as a result, they're pulling money out of the ecosystem as opposed to putting money into the ecosystem. And as a result, his claim is that more VC funds are bad for the space and they should instead be allocating their capital into liquids, buying liquids on the market. And this seems to be now increasingly common sentiment. More and more people are vibing with the story that VC funds are extractive and or net negative for the space given.
00:29:36.906 - 00:29:49.960, Speaker C: You used to be at Spartan, which both does liquid markets and venture. And so I think you're in an interesting position to weigh in here. What is your take on this drama and how do you fall out with respect to what you guys do at Tangent?
00:29:50.540 - 00:30:33.600, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that is a little bit reductive in the sense that Obviously not all VCs are the same. I think the bar for creating funds in crypto is relatively low in 2020 compared to, say, like Web2 funds, because it is everybody's first rodeo. And as such, we have a large number of funds that are. Their bar for quality for projects is quite low as well. So you get a lot of random bullshit that's funded and some of them come to market and people bid them and you just create a lot of charts that go one way. So that's kind of created the impression that, okay, VC just buy low and then try get their tokens listed on an exchange at a very high unreasonable valuation and just sell all the way. So that's certainly.
00:30:33.600 - 00:31:17.504, Speaker A: We see that quite a bit, but I wouldn't say that that is an indictment of the entire venture capital, you know, space in crypto, you know, where we fall out on this is I think there is an element of the space that is over allocated to. So there's a bit too much capital chasing, too few quality deals. And we know that, you know, like, like with kind of Web2 venture, it probably becomes more of a power law where you have a bunch of VCs that are very good at what they do, that are very good at kind of name picking as well. That would probably dominate the whole space. So when we first started Tangent, our idea was like, we don't really want to compete with these guys because I think there's a big gap in the earlier stage where people are under financed. Right. So funds are basically too big to kind of work with these very early stage companies.
00:31:17.504 - 00:32:07.042, Speaker A: So we wanted to kind of write smaller checks and work with those guys. And then I guess going back to the point that Arthur was making, I think there is probably a dearth of sophisticated price discovery in liquid markets. If you look at how valuations for startups are decided, I think it's more or less there's a bunch of sophisticated venture funds that are competing to find the right price for a deal in the public markets. I don't think there's really that much of a consensus on what tokens should be valued at right now. And I think that's probably what Arthur was trying to say is that, okay, we need more rigorous price discovery. Yeah, we, we, and we kind of already see that in defi, but we haven't seen that in any other vertical yet. So at least that's my understanding of what he's trying to get at.
00:32:07.042 - 00:32:08.626, Speaker A: I actually didn't see the tweet yet.
00:32:08.778 - 00:32:34.290, Speaker D: You know, the nice thing about crypto is that it completely blurs the line between private and public investing almost always. Right. Like everyone is somehow, you know, like it's kind of crazy when you compare it to like, I don't know, private equity where it's like the only liquidity. I guess I sell once and then I return. Right. I distribute the. I'm not like sitting here like buying liquids or selling my distributions as I'm getting them, whatever, Right.
00:32:34.290 - 00:33:44.850, Speaker D: And I think because of that there's kind of this natural thing where the notion of VC is very different in crypto than it is in traditional markets where, you know, the expected lifetime or time to first liquidity for an investment is quite high, but also the expected failure of first investment is quite high. And so I think like, because of those differences in parameters is kind of just like a different version of the market. I think the investors in private markets have a lot more influence on the public market valuation in crypto than in normal investing. You know, like normal venture investing. I honestly think the VCs don't have much control over the final public price. There's like a whole industry around how IPOs are done and who gets financed and how the kind of book is built and how the banks kind of run things. And that's completely different here where investors will be trying to source liquidity for projects when they're launched and help them meet market makers and actually do a lot of that themselves.
00:33:44.850 - 00:34:27.398, Speaker D: So you just have a very different structure. And I think inherently that's probably why the price discovery is kind of poor. I also think the private market pricing maybe slightly different to Jason. I actually think the private marketing pricing is even more inefficient than the public market pricing, because oftentimes the final price a deal is done at is not the price that the investor thinks is fair or wants to pay. It might be much higher due to competitive pressure to win the deal, they had to go over what they wanted by some amount of, you know, some percent. I think the kind of like, auction mechan, the kind of like, weird auction that goes on in private markets can oftentimes be extremely inefficient in terms of, like, the claiming.
00:34:27.414 - 00:34:29.046, Speaker C: There's like a winner's curse in.
00:34:29.118 - 00:34:55.765, Speaker D: There's a. Yeah, there can be a winner's curse. There can be a winner's curse in venture. You know, I think the difference is that people in crypto are willing to take the bet on the winner's curse type of thing. Sorry. So winner's curse is to. To give some familiarity to our listeners is a phenomenon that was actually first discovered in the 1960s when the US government was auctioning off oil tracts in Alaska.
00:34:55.765 - 00:35:30.898, Speaker D: And what the US government would do is they would say, hey, oil company, you can take one sample from this land and then decide how much you want to bid. So, like, the due diligence was like, someone goes out to land, they stick something in the ground, they do a bunch of measurements. They do. So at that time, I don't think they're doing sonar or inverse problem stuff. And you then from there figure out your bid. And the weird thing about that is, well, maybe one of the bidders sampled the part where there's a ton of oil, and they think, oh, the entire plot of land is covered in oil. And another person sampled something where there's no oil.
00:35:30.898 - 00:36:19.076, Speaker D: And so the real price should have been the average of what all the bidders knew. But the thing is, they're not sharing Information like they're keeping that private. So then whoever wins is the person who overbid. They got the sample that happened to have the most oil, so they think it has the highest resale value. So the winner's curse is like even though you win the auction, you're winning an auction that's like supposed to have some resource that you're going to extract from, in this case, like the asset that you want to resell later and it turns out that you overpaid because you made the wrong measurement. Or in this case, you included the impact of competition, the fact that more people were bidding into what your implied valuation was. If you do that too much, then it becomes kind of, you can have this winner's curse like phenomenon.
00:36:19.188 - 00:36:28.170, Speaker C: That's an interesting claim. Why do you think that crypto venture. Are you saying all venture has this winner's curse property or uniquely crypto venture?
00:36:28.750 - 00:36:34.086, Speaker D: I think all venture has it. I think in crypto venture it's a bit higher.
00:36:34.238 - 00:36:35.494, Speaker C: Why? Why do you think that?
00:36:35.582 - 00:37:03.040, Speaker D: Yeah, because I think the private market investors are also public market investors. Like they will, they will be involved in the liquidity formation process when the token is being launched. They'll oftentimes be involved in doing deals with market makers or providing supply. They will be doing all of these things that in normal public markets are intermediated by banks and the pricing is done by banks and the books are built by banks who are not the owner of the asset. Right. There's usually a third party.
00:37:03.160 - 00:37:14.368, Speaker C: Let me just parse this for the audience. What Tarun is claiming is that most venture deals that are competitive end up being priced too high and the person who wins the deal is going to lose money and expected value. Okay, that's the.
00:37:14.424 - 00:37:34.658, Speaker D: No, no, no, I'm not, I'm not necessarily saying they're going to lose money. I said I. They're going to lose money in expected value, assuming that they do. No intervention. But my point is, I think in crypto markets, the private funds can do much more intervention in the market in how the asset becomes public than in public markets. And I think in public equity markets there's very little a private fund.
00:37:34.714 - 00:37:38.562, Speaker C: So there's no winner's curse because the funds are incorporating their ability to help the project.
00:37:38.666 - 00:37:53.206, Speaker D: Yes, yes. Yeah, yeah, exactly. That. That's why they're willing to. So, so like on paper it looks like there's a winner's curse if they couldn't influence the kind of liquidity event. But because they have so much more influence, I think it actually changes their Bidding procedure.
00:37:53.318 - 00:37:53.750, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:37:53.830 - 00:38:07.014, Speaker B: I don't know if I believe any of this. I think, I mean, a. Just like empirically, the returns are pretty darn good. And so we don't actually see any sort of winner's curse in the returns.
00:38:07.062 - 00:38:10.832, Speaker D: I think I told you a winner's curse relative to the.
00:38:10.966 - 00:38:14.348, Speaker C: But even in venture. Right. I mean, just go look at the returns for. You know.
00:38:14.404 - 00:38:36.380, Speaker D: I don't know what you're talking about. Do you? Do not remember when every fucking week there'd be a partner at Benchmark complaining about banks fucking mispricing their stuff and like, oh, they hate how the pricing was done, how it launched. Are you ignoring all the 2010 venture funds? Like, all they would do is complain about how they had no control over the launch price. It changed how they were pricing seed rounds A change how they're pressing Series A round.
00:38:36.420 - 00:38:40.412, Speaker C: Which. Yeah. Which is how they're supposed to do it. Right. It's supposed to propagate up the price signal.
00:38:40.476 - 00:38:55.160, Speaker D: But I'm saying in crypto, because there's more of an influence. You, you don't have this effect where, like, it. You have this kind of, like this, this winner's curse type of thing because you don't have the realized gain. You, you can influence what your realized gain is.
00:38:55.200 - 00:39:09.288, Speaker B: I think there's maybe marginally more influence, but I, I mean, I can't speak to every other fund. I think the influence is pretty small. At the end of the day, it's like you said, it's like you do an intro to a market maker, but it's not exactly like you're out here like, you know, negotiating terms.
00:39:09.344 - 00:39:20.966, Speaker D: You might loan. You might loan your asset to the market maker. You might. You know, there's a lot of stuff people do. I would say that in normal markets, that's always disintermediated by a third party, which is not necessarily true here.
00:39:21.118 - 00:39:49.232, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, I don't, I don't know about that. But I was just going to say, you know, this is not a pure sort of commodity auction. Like, it is not always the case. And it's usually not the case that the winner is the person who is willing to pay the most or the cheapest capital. Like, there's almost always actually cheaper capital out there for teams that want to take it. This is always kind of like the meme. It's like when a European family office leads your Series A or whatever, and it's like, yeah, there's cheap money out there.
00:39:49.232 - 00:39:50.416, Speaker B: If you want to go get it.
00:39:50.568 - 00:39:54.992, Speaker C: We'Re going to Lose all our European family offices if you keep bragging about them like that.
00:39:55.096 - 00:40:00.528, Speaker B: The venture funds that you know and love are not the highest bidders usually. And that in many respects is like why the returns are good.
00:40:00.664 - 00:40:32.960, Speaker D: I would say that one difference I think between crypto and tech venture and if this data were public or whatever, you could probably try to tease this out is I think there's a much higher value for brand and tech venture because you have a longer duration before liquidity. So like people are willing to take a way bigger discount for like the higher, higher brand. Whereas in crypto I think people are like willing to. The, the tolerance for that's much lower. I think it was higher. I think it's like in 2019, I think it's eroded.
00:40:33.040 - 00:40:52.876, Speaker C: I think it's the other way around. I think it's the other way around. I think like, look, it's. If you are a SaaS company or an infrastructure company or whatever, having benchmark versus Sequoia versus I don't know, just some pension fund or something doesn't really materially change your ability to get customers. Do your sales cycle sell under the Fortune 500?
00:40:52.948 - 00:41:00.364, Speaker D: That's definitely not true because a lot of the brand name funds find you, your customers for you. That's how I think at the early stage.
00:41:00.412 - 00:41:04.016, Speaker C: Yes, I think early stage, yes. I think at the later stages I think it's much more commoditized.
00:41:04.108 - 00:41:15.300, Speaker D: Right, but the point is crypto doesn't have those later. Crypto doesn't have later stage. It only has early stage before liquidity, effective early relative to those. There's no series D or series F.
00:41:15.760 - 00:41:19.928, Speaker C: I mean in terms of the quantum of capital there is, right? Not necessarily. Sure, sure.
00:41:19.984 - 00:41:25.448, Speaker D: In the amount of capital I agree. But in the staging mechanism there's not. It goes to liquidity event quicker.
00:41:25.464 - 00:41:25.592, Speaker B: Right.
00:41:25.616 - 00:41:28.220, Speaker D: It's like goes to look at series B effectively.
00:41:28.560 - 00:42:13.310, Speaker C: Yeah, but it does. I mean I think it is very true that in crypto brand has a higher premium than it generally does in regular venture. Now look, if you're pre seed or seed brand is almost everything because everything is signaling and you have no fucking product. So. Yes, but I think if you look at like a series A or series B, it really does feel to me that if you have an A tier fund coming in in crypto versus like a D tier random fund that nobody's ever heard of, there's huge pricing differential between those two deals. And so I think to Tom's point, it is kind of like a multidimensional bid where you're bidding with both capital and prestige. And the way you trade off capital for prestige, like, I think that that conversion rate is higher in crypto than I would say it is in most traditional venture.
00:42:13.310 - 00:42:15.402, Speaker C: Most of the time.
00:42:15.506 - 00:42:31.038, Speaker D: I agree with you for really late stage, like series F or whatever, series E, D, fine. But I think it's in early stage tech investing for like, if I look at AI investing, I actually really feel like the brand thing is like, like almost even.
00:42:31.094 - 00:42:36.878, Speaker C: I think for AI investing, you're probably right. Just because it's so frenzied and crazy and you know, but the SaaS stuff.
00:42:36.894 - 00:42:44.350, Speaker D: In 2015 was the same way. My point is like all these people who were complaining about banks, they were complaining about and they were doing the SaaS deals at that time, so.
00:42:44.470 - 00:42:54.238, Speaker C: Right, right. But that's the thing. There's still a lot of SaaS deals happening. There's still fintech deals happening. There's still, you know, most of the industry is not AI, although it is the shiniest, hottest thing. And that's where I think the brand.
00:42:54.294 - 00:42:58.656, Speaker D: Premium percentage of funding allocated has been over the last few months.
00:42:58.718 - 00:43:31.938, Speaker B: Feel your point around 2020, 2021, there's a whole like, tiger is going to eat everybody's lunch and these crossovers are going to come in and just bid everything up. And that obviously ended up being sort of a terrible thesis and not really happening in a sense that they did have a winner's curse. But I think that was an apparition. That's not normally how venture markets work. I don't think that's really how they're working today. And I don't know, I find it hard to kind of of project off of a few data points from a few years ago.
00:43:32.074 - 00:44:01.344, Speaker A: Yeah, I just had a chance to pull up Arthur's tweet as well. So I think just to kind of bring it back to that point about liquids and venture. So I think the issue that you first raised, Haseeb, I think is actually quite multivariate. So what I think is happening is the public market in crypto is placing a massive premium above probably where the project should be valid when they list. And this basically gives VCS a large paper markup. Right. So let's say we invest in a new layer one at like 30 mil FDV.
00:44:01.344 - 00:44:38.938, Speaker A: When it comes to when the token launches like three months later, it launches at a billion because the market is buying it up at a billion dollars. So it's almost like against your fiduciary duty to not sell when VCs fester tokens. So you basically have this phenomenon where the public market is creating a conduit for VCs to cash out to. So I think that's probably what Arthur means. And I think this happens because of the liquidity window point that TARUN brought up. Because in crypto instead of waiting an average of like 7 to 11 years to go from startup to public company, you have a token. You could have a token within two months of the company being incorporated.
00:44:38.938 - 00:44:41.190, Speaker A: So in most cases you don't really.
00:44:41.650 - 00:44:52.840, Speaker C: I'm going to push back on this definitely. There's nobody launching tokens within two months of starting something. There are people, you're an incubator. How many of your projects launch a token within two months?
00:44:53.140 - 00:44:57.000, Speaker A: So maybe not two months, but compared to like the 7 to 11 years.
00:44:57.620 - 00:44:59.772, Speaker C: Shorter than 7 to 11 years, I grant.
00:44:59.916 - 00:45:05.520, Speaker D: Hey, a meme coin is launched even faster than two months, buddy, every 15 minutes.
00:45:07.140 - 00:45:49.352, Speaker A: So that liquidity window kind of forces, it creates this dynamic where projects don't really have the time usually to, to kind of live up to the dream. And it's not just, you know, it's, it's not just because VCS are you know, bidding projects Runway or because tokens are being launched too quickly. It's also because the market is placing such a huge speculative premium on almost anything that comes to crypto with a, you know, slight sliver of promise. And it's often very hard to live up to that kind of valuation very early on. So I think the solution is, I think actually self corrects. Right. As long as, and then retailers are already starting to realize this cycle that okay, if we just buy tokens that launch at like a few billion FDV out the gate, we probably lose money.
00:45:49.352 - 00:46:08.508, Speaker A: I think we ran the numbers for all of the token launches in the past six months off note. Right. So outside of anything, any of the liquid meme coins, almost every single one is down the past six months. So I think people are starting to realize this. So this gap is probably going to self correct. So hopefully it's an issue that that goes away over time by itself.
00:46:08.604 - 00:46:32.248, Speaker C: Well, I mean the market is down massively over the last six months so you have to correct for the fact that almost everything's down like 50% in altcoins. Part of the reason why I resist this is I'm a VC shell, so I'll own that. Fine. Ironically, we do also have a liquid fund that we manage, but a very different kind of liquid fund than Arthur does. Arthur's Very directional trading in and out of things, and we don't operate that way. We're more buy and hold. But.
00:46:32.248 - 00:47:18.004, Speaker C: But I resist very much this framing that he gives, which is that, okay, liquid funds are good for the space, VC funds are bad for the space. And it sort of gives away the game in the sense that it sort of assumes that nothing we're building here is actually valuable and it's all kind of a shell game that we're playing with retail. Which I'm like, okay, if you believe that, then why the fuck are you. Whatever. Maybe he thinks he can just make money anyway. But like, I don't believe that. And if you start from the assumption that like, well, actually, no, the things that were VC funded in prior cycles, you know, whether they be the poly markets of the world or the Solanas of the world, or the avalanches of the world, or the circles or the tethers or the coinbases, like all of these things made crypto bigger.
00:47:18.004 - 00:47:59.192, Speaker C: They made the whole thing more valuable and they made more people come in through the front door to buy everything in this space, right? Like Bitcoin would probably be worth less, Ethereum would be worth less if we didn't have all this other stuff that was built that was funded primarily by venture capital. And the idea that like, well, we're done now, there's nothing more to build. Anything more that you build is going to be extractive. So leave it alone, don't fund new projects. Instead, come buy tokens, I think is just incredibly. I think history is not going to be friendly to that view of how to think about a new technology. The second thing they'll say is that this idea that, okay, well, fine, but liquid funds are obvious.
00:47:59.192 - 00:48:55.690, Speaker C: Okay, maybe venture funds are okay, they fund new things and maybe some of them will be good, most of them will go to zero. But that's how venture works in every industry. But in tokens, in buying liquid tokens, maybe, okay, but it's still true that we really have a dearth of liquid funds and liquid funds are really good for the space and we need more of them. Now you said, Jason, that, well, the reason why is that a lot of these altcoin markets are not very efficient and more liquid funds will make things more efficient and that's good. I would kind of argue that if you're claiming that liquid funds coming into the space, like more liquid funds, is good for crypto, what you're sort of implying is that these liquid funds will have bad performance. What I mean by that is that the job of a liquid fund is to come in with, let's say you raise $100 million and your job is to like 2x that, 3x that, right? And then of course you're going to book, carry, you're going to take that money back out and you're like trading in and you find a narrative early, you buy into it, then you sell out of it, then you go do something else. But you are not long term capital.
00:48:55.690 - 00:49:18.930, Speaker C: You're recycling in and out of narratives and memes and whatever you're arbitraging, you're front running, you're thinking, not front running in a negative way, but front running in a sense of speculating on something before it happens. And if you're doing your job right, you're taking out more money than you're putting in, right? If you have 100% performance as a liquid fund and you take that money out, you have net extracted from crypto and you've definitely not funded any new development.
00:49:20.030 - 00:50:18.492, Speaker D: And look, as someone who's, who's been on both the normal tradfi side and then also the private side in crypto, the same exact type of argument exists in normal tradfi shit. Everyone in normal finance is like, oh, those VCs, those fucking idiots, like, like they're just marking up each other's books and like, you know, like what's the point of what they're doing? It's all, it's all a Ponzi scheme. And then you know, like, it's not going to work. You might as well just have put your capital into my liquid hedge fund that is returning X. Like, you know, like if you read the AQR founder's blog, it's like filled with shit like that, right? Like he's, he's, that's like all he writes nowadays. And so I think this is just a natural tension of like two different, like this, like this constant tension between like the, like kind of long term but very uncertain return part of the world and like the, like I need to know everything right now part of the world. And I do feel like this is a classic tension in capitalism.
00:50:18.492 - 00:50:26.172, Speaker D: It's not like a, it's not like a resolved thing. It's like it's a core conflict that leads to trading activity existing.
00:50:26.316 - 00:51:09.630, Speaker B: I think to Aseeb's point, it's kind of unfortunate, but I do feel like crypto public markets are uniquely bad at actually providing and raising capital to the teams that are issuing tokens. It's not like public equities Markets where the team needs more capital, they can issue new shares, they can issue corporate debt, whatever. Very rarely would a team actually sell tokens on the open market. Always when people are doing treasury sales, they're actually selling them to VCs. So it's not as if, again, for this sort of equities hedge fund analog, it's like, oh, great, you want to go issue new shares, we'll go, you know, buy them, because we're bullish. And like, now you have more money to go do the thing. It's like you're just kind of trading back and forth like there's not.
00:51:09.630 - 00:51:20.802, Speaker B: The teams can't actually very easily tap into crypto public markets the same way they can in equities. And so they're not actually, I think, not super efficient for funding these teams.
00:51:20.946 - 00:51:42.274, Speaker C: It doesn't surprise me that hedge fund people sling mud at VC people and that VC people sling mud at hedge fund people. What's weird about this whole thing is that the chorus of, you know, crypto Twitter is overwhelmingly on the side of the hedge fund people, which is very strange to me because hedge fund people, like, they're literally directly trading against retail, right?
00:51:42.362 - 00:51:48.910, Speaker D: Have you not, did you not follow the whole GameStop thing? This is just the same. This is like the opposite version of that.
00:51:49.370 - 00:51:52.626, Speaker C: In GameStop, they hated the hedge funds right here. They're like, they love the hedge funds.
00:51:52.738 - 00:51:53.922, Speaker D: It's the opposite version.
00:51:53.986 - 00:51:58.464, Speaker C: It's so straight. And I'm like, am I missing something? Is there. I don't think it makes a lot.
00:51:58.472 - 00:51:59.776, Speaker A: Of sense because most.
00:51:59.848 - 00:52:00.896, Speaker C: Why does this make sense?
00:52:01.008 - 00:52:49.012, Speaker A: Because most retail's participation in this space is through liquid tokens, right? Most people are buying tokens. Most people don't have proprietary access to deal flow, so they kind of empathize with the liquid funds a bit more. But I want to go back to Haseeb's point because when I first mentioned that Arthur's tweet is a bit reductive, I think it's exactly because of what Haseeb was saying. And Haseeb, you explained it in a much more eloquent way than my rambling did. But it's basically because I think different quality VCs shape the perception of VC funds a lot, right? So ideally, projects that are funded by high quality VCs, they ideally are real products that could bring in more people and as such, more capital. So I think what Arthur is referring to is that the vast majority of VCs out there in crypto are pretty bad because the bar for Quality was so low to enter back in like 2019, 2020. So there's self select for bad projects that come to market at valuations that are way above what they should be.
00:52:49.012 - 00:53:08.560, Speaker A: So it just ends up being a one way ticket for those VCs to get to cash out those projects. So that kind of phenomenon formed a very cynical view of what VCs are. But I think that's why we're very selective in terms of who we work with. We love kind of co investment with Dragonfly for instance, because of the kind of similar taste that we have in terms of selecting what we hope ideally.
00:53:08.640 - 00:53:10.192, Speaker B: This is why we brought you on the pod.
00:53:10.336 - 00:53:13.168, Speaker C: Yeah, we paid him to say this to be clear.
00:53:13.224 - 00:53:14.752, Speaker D: Page more Dragonfly show.
00:53:14.856 - 00:53:58.194, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly the second point I want to make. So the second point I want to make before I wrap up quickly. So on the liquid fund point, I do think that the point about liquid funds being value extractive is also reductive because there's so many different strategies in liquid funds. Right. So even if you look at very high frequency trading funds, you could argue that they're adding a lot more liquidity depth to markets that otherwise would not have been around. But then a lot of the funds in crypto are actually share more in similarity with VC funds than like Tradfi hedge funds as well. So a lot of them are very thesis driven because of the space is so early stage that these thesis driven funds, they basically put out long form blog posts about exactly why they're bullish on a thing and they hold it actually for you know, a year or two.
00:53:58.194 - 00:54:21.758, Speaker A: And that I think that type of stuff helps to make markets more efficient in that it shapes the thought of the market and reallocates capital from more vaporware projects to hopefully more high quality projects just by kind of, you know, having these fund managers share their views publicly. So I do think those create quite a lot of value for the space. But obviously trend guys still hate VC guys and then vice versa.
00:54:21.854 - 00:54:24.702, Speaker D: I think that's ever changing.
00:54:24.846 - 00:54:43.118, Speaker C: Sure. Okay, so your claim is that, well, there are some hedge funds that maybe are not so great, but there are some sort of Berkshire Hathaway style hedge funds that are actually really good and they make the market more efficient. What are the types of hedge funds that under your story here are not positive for the space?
00:54:43.254 - 00:54:45.118, Speaker D: Haseeb wants the dirt today.
00:54:45.254 - 00:54:55.810, Speaker C: Well, I want to zoom in on what you mean because it was a little hand wavy, right? It's like are arbitrage funds bad? Are long short funds bad? Which Funds would you claim don't fall into those categories?
00:54:56.470 - 00:55:00.046, Speaker A: I guess. Bad for whom, bad for the space.
00:55:00.118 - 00:55:02.542, Speaker C: Bad for everyone else. That's the claim. Bad for everyone else.
00:55:02.606 - 00:55:02.798, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:55:02.814 - 00:55:28.978, Speaker A: It's very hard to qualify what funds are. So I think for VC side it's very clear, right? If you're a VC that constantly funds like deliberate rug pulls, then that's clearly a bad thing. But for liquid funds, you know, it's an open market, everybody can participate however they want and nobody is kind of structurally supporting. I don't think there's a fund strategy I know of that is legal, that is kind of constantly just funding scams.
00:55:29.154 - 00:55:53.032, Speaker C: Okay, so your claim that, I mean there are people who like insider trade and stuff, I think that's clearly not helping markets or I don't know, maybe, maybe it is, I don't know, who knows? But it sounds like you're walking back a little bit from that claim that well, there are some hedge funds that are good, there are some that are bad. It sounds like you're basically saying, well, basically all hedge funds are good. As long as you follow the rules, you know, it's fine. It's like positive sum across the board.
00:55:53.136 - 00:56:39.684, Speaker A: I think there's a, there's a very clear line between legal and kind of fair game by the rules of the market and kind of good or bad. So I'm just saying most of the hedge funds, as long as you're not doing illegal stuff, I don't think, I don't, I, at least I don't feel like I'm in a position to kind of qualify, hey, this is a bad fund. This is a good fund for this space. But what I would consider to be the most value additive to this space are these thesis driven ones that kind of share their thesis. You know, if given a choice between if I must kind of qualify, okay, which fund is better, quote unquote, for this space, you know, a high frequency trading firm versus, you know, a thesis driven fund. I would like to see more thesis driven funds just to kind of get more sophisticated price discovery on, on, on tokens and reallocate kind of retail capital from bad projects to good projects. But you know, I'd argue they serve very, very different functions.
00:56:39.684 - 00:56:44.480, Speaker A: So it's very hard for me to say that, hey, this type of hedge fund, this strategy is really just net bad for this space.
00:56:44.860 - 00:56:47.520, Speaker C: Yeah, Tarun, what's your intuition on that question?
00:56:49.820 - 00:57:48.390, Speaker D: I, I guess like there is a sense in which, you know, I, I feel like the kind of weasel word hidden there was the Illegal thing because it's like. Well, there's a very fine line in crypto comparatively to other markets where there's like certain definitions that would probably call things legal or not. But I think like obviously the types of things, like there's tons of firms, I wouldn't say necessarily hedge funds, they might just be prop capital that definitely love WASH trading. And like, you know, I don't know. I. You can't, you kind of hope that like the, the market actually would get to the point that it, you know, it, it, there's sufficiently high cost to WASH trading that like you're disincentivized, which is like the goal, crypto's goal of preventing watch trading versus like you know, traditional markets. It's like I have the SEC investigate five years too late because like they always, they, they always, their data analysis is always like very late compared to when the infraction happens.
00:57:48.390 - 00:58:10.306, Speaker D: If you look at the silence and I just don't think there, we've, we've kind of created that yet. And so there is, there is, there's definitely a large segment of the market that probably does make money doing that. Now it's technically probably not illegal for some of the assets. Like you know, like for NFT wash trading. Right. Like if NFTs were collectibles.
00:58:10.498 - 00:58:19.510, Speaker C: This is a very weird answer to the question I asked you. Like, you're like going through the different strategies for WASH trading different assets.
00:58:20.050 - 00:58:23.082, Speaker D: Well, I'm just trying to say that there's a non zero number.
00:58:23.186 - 00:58:26.950, Speaker C: This is not investment advice. I just want to reiterate that as much as I possibly can.
00:58:27.250 - 00:58:43.578, Speaker D: I'm just saying there's a non zero number of funds that do that that are making positive profits that I would say it's probably not positive profits from rebates and other token incentives, whatever, where I don't think they're really contributing anything to price discovery.
00:58:43.674 - 00:58:46.458, Speaker B: Yeah, NFT WASH trading bad. I think, I think it's okay.
00:58:46.474 - 00:58:54.860, Speaker C: NFT established NFT WASH trading is bad. Okay, I think we're in agreement. Can you go any further afield Tarun, about other hedge fund strategies?
00:58:55.360 - 00:59:41.246, Speaker D: Well, I would say there's a lack of certain strategies that I think is actually bad, which is more obvious than the ones that are bad in normal markets. I think the idea that I can kind of find ways of making almost self financing portfolios. Self financing meaning like the expected growth in the asset funds, the funding cost of say like an option premium or whatever, it's much easier to do that in crypto. The problem is like your only sort of derivative exposure, 90% of the time is only a perp. And that's not self financing because you have to keep paying the funding rate. There is staking, right? Correct. But the staking has duration mismatch stuff.
00:59:41.246 - 01:00:30.830, Speaker D: Right. I'm just saying there's a lot of stuff that I think could be better and there's not. And, and this is one of the reasons I feel like you don't see as many like longer term traditional stat arb looking funds and you see a lot more like short duration or really long buy and hold. But there's not no one in the kind of like middle as much. Like if I, if I took a plot of funds and I like took some like a plot of like, you know, the distribution of like the median frequency they trade at, you know, I think a normal market would look kind of like Gaussian crypto markets would look like bimodal. And I think that that's sort of, that there's something missing in the middle. And like each time there's like a new defi thing or a new staking type of mechanism, you start seeing those two modes get closer but it still hasn't merged and it doesn't feel like it's there yet.
01:00:30.830 - 01:00:40.550, Speaker D: So I think that not having the mid frequency is kind of bad. But that, that's not like, that's like a lack of strategy rather than existence of strategy.
01:00:40.960 - 01:01:16.326, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm not sure if these funds exist. I think like Tarun said, there's some prop funds that might do this. But if I must point out like a netbat strategy for type of hedge fund, it's probably the systematic airdrop farmers. I know I'm going to get a lot of shit for this because airdrop farmers hate me for some reason. But I think they're netbat for the space because you create very confusing metrics for founders. Right. When you suddenly get like 10,000 new users and it sounds very confounding kind of kind of messaging to the founders in terms of like what is actually hitting product market fit.
01:01:16.326 - 01:01:22.790, Speaker A: And then these airdrop farmers, they're literally extracting value from products because they're not going to be sticking around.
01:01:22.830 - 01:01:23.078, Speaker C: Right.
01:01:23.134 - 01:01:46.940, Speaker A: I think there's a lot of studies done on different projects where users fall off by 80%, users fall off by 80% after the AirDrop is done. So I don't see how that is good for any founder or any project on the space as a whole. But as far as I know, at least in my circle, I don't know of any funds that kind of systematically do this as a strategy. Maybe there's individuals who do this. So I wouldn't say that that's hate. You know, there's hedge funds out there that's like secretly farming all these protocols. And that's bad.
01:01:47.060 - 01:01:53.080, Speaker D: Yeah, that's the other side of my wash trading argument. Like the people who are doing that are generally doing it for this reason.
01:01:53.620 - 01:02:09.408, Speaker C: You got to be pretty small I think to be WASH trading at or not Wash to be airdrop farming at scale. I think that the scalability of that strategy, it's such that it's really only like, you know, these two person prop teams that are doing this kind of stuff at scale, as far as I know, they just, you know, it's, it's just not.
01:02:09.464 - 01:02:13.616, Speaker D: Hey, the peak. The peak Pendle TVL was not zero.
01:02:13.768 - 01:02:18.000, Speaker C: Yeah, I think, I think at peak it was a little bit more scalable, but I think it's less so now.
01:02:18.120 - 01:02:33.212, Speaker B: I feel like I've kind of spoken my truth on, on this subject. I don't know. I. Yeah. Wish for more efficient, more transparent, more, you know, sophisticated markets and slowly but surely we are getting there. Believe it or not. I think sometimes it doesn't feel like it but.
01:02:33.212 - 01:02:36.788, Speaker B: But I think this space has matured compared to, I don't know, 10 years ago.
01:02:36.924 - 01:03:46.210, Speaker C: Yeah. I think having now gone through this full circle of conversation, I think I more or less agree with Jason is that I think for hedge funds, for hedge funds that are short term, they're improving liquidity. For hedge funds that are medium term, they're making markets more efficient and reallocating capital in some way. Tom makes the point that, well, reallocating capital in crypto doesn't really mean anything because the teams can't really tap into public markets, but they sort of can. There's the DWFs of the world, there's the VCs, they mark their discounts to the public markets and so there is some price signal that propagates back from the public markets. So I think the reality is that probably all these things are more or less fine and there's some deadweight loss somewhere from funds that some hedge funds that are just not really doing anything useful for anyone, they're just competing to compete and I think that's normal. But the first cut assumption should be that everything's probably fine unless you are really doing something that's obviously just making things worse for people like wash trading or airdrop farming or whatever that is.
01:03:46.210 - 01:03:57.784, Speaker C: Just kind of picking up things In a way that is counter to what is intended. Whether it's, you know, counter to the rules of how an exchange ought to operate or counter to the rules of how an airdrop supposed to be working.
01:03:57.872 - 01:04:30.948, Speaker D: I think. Okay, here, here's another characterization of what I think might be bad is like the ability for me to make a riskless profit doing an activity that doesn't impact the either long term liquidity or long term price of the asset. Right. Like the wash trading just to get the farming incentive is like the farming incentive was bad because I didn't have to really take any risk to watch trade because it's subsidizing literally all of my risk. Right. I think like you, if you're going to be in, in these markets you should have to take some risk. Right? Like you should actually.
01:04:31.004 - 01:04:33.172, Speaker C: Well, now I would say farmers are taking for sure.
01:04:33.196 - 01:04:36.708, Speaker D: No, no, now they are. Right. But it took, it took, it took a while. Right.
01:04:36.764 - 01:04:42.644, Speaker C: But I don't think the risk is what makes it non productive. Right. Like it's non productive still even though the farmers are taking risk.
01:04:42.812 - 01:05:14.470, Speaker D: No, but I think the risk is a deterrent to, to kind of like to the metrics being gamed right by it. So, so, so that's a good thing. That means that like if I'm taking a risk, I'm willing to improve this product project's metric because I think there's some outcome that's positive and it has to be positive for both of us. Right. And like that's, that's kind of where you want the equilibrium to go versus like I don't have to take any risk. I get a free risk, risk free return and like the project doesn't get any benefit. Like its metrics are just like, you know, Bart Simpson.
01:05:14.970 - 01:05:35.554, Speaker C: Yeah, fair enough. All right, so I know we're, we're up on time. I want to give one last thing question I want to ask Jason and then we'll wrap token. 2049 is next week. Massive conference, I think I believe all four of us are going to be there. What should people who are coming to Singapore look out for? Jason? Give us some, give us some Rex or just like high level how we should be thinking about it.
01:05:35.642 - 01:05:46.948, Speaker A: Yes. Come beat me up at our Jiu Jitsu event. We're doing a tangent Jiu Jitsu event. So if you have some experience, come on the mats, you can bully me. If you don't like my takes on Twitter, you can take it out on me. I'd love to, love to see some of you guys out there.
01:05:47.004 - 01:05:48.260, Speaker C: Airdrop farmers only.
01:05:48.380 - 01:06:02.440, Speaker A: Yes, Airdrop farmers only. We're also doing an event with Dragonfly, I think a Thursday evening, so a PORTCO should be receiving that link, if you haven't already. But yeah, in general, I'm excited to meet a lot of you guys in person finally.
01:06:03.100 - 01:06:06.000, Speaker D: I love that Jason is the Dragonfly marketing department.
01:06:08.860 - 01:06:27.840, Speaker C: He's going to be sending us an invoice right after the show. Cool. Awesome. Well, Jason, great to have you on and looking forward to seeing you in person in Singapore. We'll be doing a couple of live shows in Singapore. Stay on the lookout for that. We should have at least one of them live by next week, but until then, day, everybody.
01:06:28.000 - 01:06:28.560, Speaker A: Thanks, guys.
