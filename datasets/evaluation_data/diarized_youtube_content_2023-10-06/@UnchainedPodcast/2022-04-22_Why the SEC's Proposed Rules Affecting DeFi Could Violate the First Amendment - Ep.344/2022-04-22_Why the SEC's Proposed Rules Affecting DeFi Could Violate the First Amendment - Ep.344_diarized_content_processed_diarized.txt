00:02:51.288 - 00:02:52.370, Speaker C: Welcome, Peter.
00:02:52.950 - 00:02:55.010, Speaker F: Hi, Laura. It's great to be back.
00:02:55.160 - 00:03:01.874, Speaker C: Yeah, nice to have you. This week, Coin Center filed a comment letter with the securities and Exchange Commission.
00:03:02.002 - 00:03:05.522, Speaker G: About a proposed rulemaking about the definition.
00:03:05.586 - 00:03:09.086, Speaker D: Of exchange and alternative trading systems.
00:03:09.218 - 00:03:11.500, Speaker G: What did this proposed rulemaking say?
00:03:12.590 - 00:03:18.742, Speaker F: So the proposed rulemaking does a few things, but the main thing it did that we were concerned about is redefine.
00:03:18.806 - 00:03:23.082, Speaker H: The term exchange in the regulations, which.
00:03:23.136 - 00:04:16.586, Speaker F: Basically determines who needs to come in and register at the SEC as an exchange or as a member of an exchange. And if you don't register, you can have a big fine levied against you. And if you had your registration revoked, maybe for some reason, like trading unregistered securities, you're no longer allowed to do those things that are defined as being an exchange. Now, the old definition of exchange was pretty narrowly focused on using established methods to bring together orders for buyers and sellers of securities. The new definition, however, is about making available communications protocol software or systems that others might use in order to bring together buyers and sellers. Not even necessarily so. You know, from Coincenter's perspective, we're a digital civil liberties organization worried about things like free speech and the ability of people to publish software.
00:04:16.586 - 00:04:25.986, Speaker F: We were really quite concerned when we first saw this proposed rulemaking because it basically seems to say that you need to register before you're allowed to publish software that might be used by other.
00:04:26.008 - 00:04:27.410, Speaker H: People to trade securities.
00:04:28.710 - 00:04:39.446, Speaker D: So a lot of people felt that this rulemaking really was targeted at crypto, blockchain DeFi in particular or kind of.
00:04:39.468 - 00:04:43.062, Speaker C: Related fields, and yet the rulemaking actually.
00:04:43.116 - 00:04:46.390, Speaker D: Didn'T ever refer explicitly to those areas.
00:04:46.810 - 00:04:48.598, Speaker C: Do you agree with that assessment, that.
00:04:48.604 - 00:04:53.018, Speaker D: It was meant to target those areas? And if so, why? Do you think the SEC wrote it.
00:04:53.024 - 00:04:57.020, Speaker G: In a way where those topics were not actually mentioned?
00:04:57.630 - 00:04:57.994, Speaker H: Yeah.
00:04:58.032 - 00:05:29.986, Speaker F: No, that's a great question because it doesn't look on its face like it's targeted at DeFi or crypto at you know, we make it sort of a point of policy to not psychoanalyze regulators and just sort of take them at their word. And so with this one, we're a little confused because when you're a lawyer, you care most about the law as it's drafted. Because at the end of the day, maybe 30 years from now, after all these regulators have sort of come and gone, a judge is still going to look at the words in order to decide who's obligated by the words of the law.
00:05:30.088 - 00:05:31.302, Speaker H: So we had to look at the words.
00:05:31.356 - 00:05:41.858, Speaker F: And the words seem to indicate that even if you're just publishing software, if people are using it to buy and sell securities, including ones potentially on a decentralized network, you need to register.
00:05:42.034 - 00:05:43.670, Speaker H: But that would meet.
00:05:43.740 - 00:06:33.206, Speaker F: It seemed like there's a whole bunch of people who would need to register because they make, say, Dex software available. And some of the tokens that people trade using that software are going to be securities. And like you said, nowhere in the rulemaking is Dex mentioned, is crypto mentioned, is publishing software necessarily mentioned. It's this make available communications protocol, which is publishing software. There's no reasonable interpretation of that statement that doesn't include publishing software. But why didn't they come out and mention it? And the only other thing I'll add about that is the SEC is under a duty in its organic statute in the congressional law that was passed back in the Great Depression that created the agency to do something called an economic analysis, an economic impact analysis for their new rules. And they did this in the rulemaking.
00:06:33.238 - 00:06:34.202, Speaker H: Because, of course, they have to.
00:06:34.256 - 00:07:13.458, Speaker F: And they estimated that there were only 22 communications protocols out there, some of which might now need to register because of the rule change, which seems to indicate that they're not thinking this applies to software development as software development, even though it's definitely drafted that way because it would obviously be more than 22 persons. I think ostensibly the rulemaking was targeted at things like the Bloomberg Terminal Information Service Providers that have some sort of system that allow people to say, ah, I like Tesla stock, I would sell around these ranges. It's not exactly like the traditional stock market where there's a bid and an ask and they're matched, but it's still obviously a tool that's used by people to trade securities.
00:07:13.634 - 00:07:17.126, Speaker H: But the way they drafted it is so broad, and because we care about.
00:07:17.148 - 00:07:30.618, Speaker F: The law, not necessarily what people thought the law meant when they drafted it, we had to sort of file this comment and make constitutional law arguments as to why this is probably too broad. It's going to chill a lot of protected speech under the First Amendment, and.
00:07:30.784 - 00:07:35.598, Speaker H: It can't go forward in this form. They have to go back and fix oh.
00:07:35.684 - 00:07:52.674, Speaker D: So some people were saying that this is like a stealth attack on DeFi, and Gabriel Shapiro of Delphi Digital was saying that he thought that these rules could kill this kind of technology, these decentralized financial services. But you're saying that you think the SEC didn't actually mean to catch this.
00:07:52.712 - 00:07:55.806, Speaker H: In its so again, like, I can't.
00:07:55.838 - 00:08:01.622, Speaker F: Psychoanalyze Gary Gensler or hester purse, although hester purse filed a dissent saying people.
00:08:01.676 - 00:08:04.326, Speaker H: Should check this out. It looks kind of broad, but I.
00:08:04.348 - 00:08:06.198, Speaker F: Can'T psychoanalyze any of them.
00:08:06.284 - 00:08:11.082, Speaker H: It is weird that it would be drafted in such a broad way, such.
00:08:11.136 - 00:08:15.466, Speaker F: That if you knew anything about crypto and Chairman Gensler does know a lot.
00:08:15.488 - 00:08:18.634, Speaker H: About crypto, you wouldn't immediately think, oh.
00:08:18.672 - 00:09:05.926, Speaker F: This seems to cover a lot of this stuff, that maybe the people who drafted it up in staff didn't think it was originally going to cover. And you would think, you would then either go back to the staff and say, we got to narrow it, or you would redo your economic analysis to say, okay, this is going to impact thousands of software developers, not just 22 communications protocol systems. But obviously neither of those things happened. The rule got published, the proposed rule got published with its incredible breadth that could cover software development, and yet the economic analysis still said only 22 persons or entities are likely to qualify. Those two things are very hard to reconcile, just having a plain reading of the rule as it was drafted. So I don't know how this happened. I don't know whether it's like, oh, well, maybe it will cover a bunch, but we'll clean that up later, and maybe we won't mind having that extra authority.
00:09:05.926 - 00:09:10.700, Speaker F: I just psychoanalyzed them. I did an internal monologue. I'm not supposed to do that, but.
00:09:11.330 - 00:09:12.560, Speaker H: I have no idea.
00:09:13.090 - 00:09:19.070, Speaker D: Okay, so Coin Center wrote a comment letter. What did you say in that comment letter?
00:09:19.650 - 00:09:24.446, Speaker H: The typical way to respond to an agency is to address the substance of.
00:09:24.468 - 00:09:47.954, Speaker F: The law, say from an economic policy standpoint or an innovation standpoint. Like, this is going to be bad for business or bad for technologists in the US. Or things like this, or is to go at it at a process standpoint and know, the Administrative Procedures Act says that you need to have a certain amount of comment time. And this was a short comment. It was a short comment. We didn't make either of those arguments.
00:09:48.002 - 00:09:48.694, Speaker G: Actually.
00:09:48.892 - 00:09:58.826, Speaker F: We did something a little untraditional nontraditional for agency rulemaking. We filed a whole comment that was about constitutional law. That was about the limits that the.
00:09:58.848 - 00:10:01.158, Speaker H: First Amendment are freedom of speech and.
00:10:01.184 - 00:10:07.214, Speaker F: Freedom of religion and other things, but most relevant here, freedom of speech. The limit that that amendment places on.
00:10:07.252 - 00:10:11.102, Speaker H: Government agencies and on Congress that says.
00:10:11.156 - 00:11:05.774, Speaker F: You cannot regulate beyond a certain point. And this was convenient for me. I'm the director of research at Coin Center. I write our comments and I write our reports because I was already working on a report about the First Amendment implications of regulating activities like decentralized exchange software publication or being a miner or a staker on these networks. And we saw the SEC rulemaking, and I thought like, all right, well, this report is now going to turn into a comment letter to the SEC just for convenience sake, and maybe later we'll expand it to more things than just securities regulation and publish it as a report. But it was actually really fortuitous from my perspective because I'd already done a lot of research into a case that came out in 2011 called IMS Health Versus Sorrel, which was about pharmaceutical data brokers. The pharmaceutical industry wants to know whether doctors are prescribing their drugs so they can target ads at the doctors to get the doctors to prescribe their drugs more.
00:11:05.774 - 00:11:13.842, Speaker F: And Vermont and a couple of other New England states tried to ban the sale of that information, whether a doctor is prescribing a drug or not.
00:11:13.896 - 00:11:16.386, Speaker H: And the Supreme Court ultimately said, no.
00:11:16.488 - 00:11:38.122, Speaker F: That'S speech, yes, it's commercial speech. It's speech that's all about profit. God knows the pharmaceutical industry is all about profit, but it doesn't matter. You can't ban a certain type of content or a certain type of viewpoint, even if it's a capitalist viewpoint, even if it's like pharmaceutical companies want to have ads. And so that case is, I think, a really good precedent to build on.
00:11:38.176 - 00:11:40.266, Speaker H: As far as saying, look, we can.
00:11:40.288 - 00:11:47.326, Speaker F: Do all kinds of sensible regulation of conduct like when someone helps someone else buy a security. But we can't do that kind of.
00:11:47.348 - 00:11:50.158, Speaker H: Permission based regulation when it comes to.
00:11:50.164 - 00:12:05.042, Speaker F: Just someone publishing software and tools that enable other people to trade securities or to trade assets or other things like this, because banning the publication is just like in that pharmaceutical case banning speech. And we just don't do that in the US.
00:12:05.096 - 00:12:06.574, Speaker H: Because it stifles innovation.
00:12:06.702 - 00:12:16.326, Speaker F: And the cool thing about having to then extend this specifically to the Exchange Act rulemaking, this paper I was already writing is I looked deep into all.
00:12:16.348 - 00:12:18.646, Speaker H: The old SEC case law, and I.
00:12:18.668 - 00:12:39.038, Speaker F: Thought that there actually wasn't much there as far as the intersection of the SEC's authority and the limits that the First Amendment places on that authority. But actually there's a really big case in 1985, so it's exactly as old as me. It was called Lowe versus SEC. It was a guy who was a disgraced former investment advisor. So he previously had registered with the.
00:12:39.044 - 00:12:41.694, Speaker H: SEC under the Investment Advisors Act, and.
00:12:41.732 - 00:12:45.018, Speaker F: He did some insider trading or something, and so they revoked his registration.
00:12:45.114 - 00:12:48.994, Speaker H: Not allowed to be an investment advisor anymore. And what he used to be doing.
00:12:49.032 - 00:13:00.514, Speaker F: Was direct to client. Like, I'll talk to you, Laura. You tell me what you're interested in investing in, I'll tell you if it's a good idea or not. What he continued doing after his registration was revoked is publishing a stock tip.
00:13:00.562 - 00:13:02.726, Speaker H: Newsletter, just sort of like you can.
00:13:02.748 - 00:13:07.046, Speaker F: Buy it on the street corner in a little magazine stand. And the SEC brought an injunction to.
00:13:07.068 - 00:13:09.334, Speaker H: Stop him from publishing that newsletter because.
00:13:09.372 - 00:13:15.962, Speaker F: They know you're still doing investment advice. We told you you can't anymore. The Supreme Court came back in that case and said, no, you can't stop.
00:13:16.016 - 00:13:18.086, Speaker H: Someone from just publishing a newsletter.
00:13:18.198 - 00:13:36.866, Speaker F: That's a protected speech activity. And so a unanimous court in 1985 said that there is a limit to the SEC's jurisdiction when it comes to people publishing dispassionate advice or tools or information. And so, frankly, that's exactly what's about to happen here. If the rulemaking was to go forward and become final, you're telling people they.
00:13:36.888 - 00:13:39.170, Speaker H: Can'T publish communications protocols.
00:13:39.590 - 00:13:43.634, Speaker F: It's just a series of rules written in software. You could publish it like a book.
00:13:43.752 - 00:13:46.680, Speaker H: And so I think the same First Amendment limitations apply.
00:13:47.930 - 00:13:50.310, Speaker D: This is incredibly fascinating.
00:13:50.730 - 00:13:53.814, Speaker G: But first, let's have a quick word.
00:13:53.852 - 00:13:54.934, Speaker D: From the sponsors who make the show.

00:16:12.950 - 00:16:23.410, Speaker D: Back to my conversation with Peter. So I have to admit that when I was first reading about this, I was very confused about how writing software.
00:16:23.490 - 00:16:26.278, Speaker G: Could be free speech, because to my.
00:16:26.284 - 00:16:28.486, Speaker C: Mind, I was like, well, you're building a product.
00:16:28.668 - 00:16:46.606, Speaker D: But from what you described here about the pharmaceutical case and other things, I mean, I think I get it. It's like just building on previous law. So now that you've made this case for why you think that this potentially is a violation of the constitution, I.
00:16:46.628 - 00:16:50.974, Speaker C: Did notice in your blog post that you said, quote, we don't need to.
00:16:51.012 - 00:16:57.406, Speaker D: Wait to sue the SEC. It can happen as soon as the rule is final. So is that what Coin Center plans.
00:16:57.438 - 00:17:06.918, Speaker F: To do, so that we was intended to be the community, the larger community of people in this space? It could be Coin Center.
00:17:07.084 - 00:17:09.634, Speaker H: I'm not sure we would be strictly.
00:17:09.682 - 00:17:13.174, Speaker F: Against bringing a pre enforcement challenge, but.
00:17:13.292 - 00:17:16.546, Speaker H: It'S not something that we're absolutely gung.
00:17:16.578 - 00:17:17.910, Speaker F: Ho about at the moment.
00:17:18.060 - 00:17:19.638, Speaker H: Our main hope is that the SEC.
00:17:19.724 - 00:17:43.854, Speaker F: Changes the rule before they publish it. And at the very end of our comment, we actually cite a really cool speech that I found from Commissioner Roberta Carmel, who was the first female commissioner of the SEC, actually, back in the 1970s. And she wrote this great speech, or gave this speech, I suppose. There's no recording of it, sadly, where she says, look, during my tenure, there were a lot of rules that we passed that we had to think about the First Amendment implications, because we deal.
00:17:43.892 - 00:17:45.230, Speaker H: With speech all the time.
00:17:45.380 - 00:17:54.494, Speaker F: And there were some specific examples of where we limited the breadth of our rule midstream. We were about to publish a rule and then we were like, wait a minute, this is going to chill protected.
00:17:54.542 - 00:18:01.206, Speaker H: Expression, and we are generally not interested in doing that. And so that sets a great precedent, I think.
00:18:01.388 - 00:18:03.078, Speaker F: And then you can fast forward all.
00:18:03.084 - 00:18:03.960, Speaker H: The way to today.
00:18:05.370 - 00:18:10.554, Speaker F: Commissioner Hester Purse, currently at the SEC, wrote her in her dissent that people.
00:18:10.592 - 00:18:13.706, Speaker H: Who are developing these communications protocols should.
00:18:13.728 - 00:18:16.982, Speaker F: Look hard at the rule and make sure that it doesn't impact their activities.
00:18:17.126 - 00:18:22.426, Speaker H: And so I think between this 1970s.
00:18:22.448 - 00:18:31.438, Speaker F: Statement of the limits of the SEC and the First Amendment and Hester's perspective today, I think there's a very reasonable argument that the SEC should take a.
00:18:31.444 - 00:18:35.694, Speaker H: Hard look at this proposed rule and narrow the category.
00:18:35.822 - 00:18:44.638, Speaker F: And like we were discussing earlier, the economic analysis suggested that the category they think they want to have is only 22 persons or institutions.
00:18:44.814 - 00:18:48.462, Speaker H: So I would say, great, that's probably the right category.
00:18:48.526 - 00:19:02.940, Speaker F: So you need to find a way to narrow the definition so that it really only does apply to the Bloomberg terminal and not to somebody who's just publishing software. We also to your listeners who might be writing this software or active in the decentralized exchange community.
00:19:03.550 - 00:19:09.606, Speaker H: We go through activities beyond just publishing software. You might be maintaining the website that's.
00:19:09.638 - 00:19:20.750, Speaker F: The front end for the smart contracts on the ethereum blockchain or the Tezos blockchain or whatever. And that seems to be more of a centralized activity. And of course it is, but it's still just a speech.
00:19:21.650 - 00:19:22.862, Speaker H: You know, there's a lot more.
00:19:22.916 - 00:19:40.206, Speaker F: I'm not just one of these, like, code is speech. That's the end of the conversation. There's a perfectly reasonable area of activities for the government to regulate through things like registration. Like, if I was to be a practicing lawyer, I'm trained as a lawyer, but I don't practice because I work for a nonprofit. I don't have clients.
00:19:40.318 - 00:19:41.158, Speaker H: But if I was to be a.
00:19:41.164 - 00:19:50.966, Speaker F: Practicing lawyer, of course I have to go get barred before I'm allowed to practice my profession. And you might think, well, a lawyer's profession is all speech. How can that be permissioned if this.
00:19:50.988 - 00:19:52.498, Speaker H: Other thing can't be permissioned?
00:19:52.594 - 00:19:59.158, Speaker F: And the fact of the matter is, it's actually discussed in this Lowe versus SEC case. Justice White, who wrote a concurrence in.
00:19:59.164 - 00:20:03.434, Speaker H: The case, says, look, it's okay to regulate professional conduct.
00:20:03.562 - 00:20:06.442, Speaker F: It's not okay to regulate dispassionate publication.
00:20:06.506 - 00:20:13.294, Speaker H: Of information or tools or newsletters for that matter. And so where's that line?
00:20:13.492 - 00:20:19.806, Speaker F: We're allowed to impact speech if it's incidental to my professional conduct as a lawyer, they can tell me you can't.
00:20:19.838 - 00:20:21.474, Speaker H: Speak in front of a judge, but.
00:20:21.512 - 00:20:31.350, Speaker F: They can't tell me I can't speak in front of a crowd on the street about the rights of man, about what the SEC has been doing lately. They can't stop me from speaking to you right now about what the SEC.
00:20:31.420 - 00:20:34.358, Speaker H: Is doing right now simply because I.
00:20:34.364 - 00:20:35.398, Speaker F: Don'T happen to be barred as an.
00:20:35.404 - 00:20:36.726, Speaker H: Attorney or something like that.
00:20:36.828 - 00:20:57.498, Speaker F: And so this discussion is really rich in the low opinion, and it's very interesting. I think Justice White's concurrence strikes the perfect line between where it's okay to regulate, with permission, professional conduct and where you're actually regulating speech as speech. The phrase he uses a couple times is a personal nexus between the professional and the client.
00:20:57.674 - 00:20:58.862, Speaker H: And so you have to ask yourself.
00:20:58.916 - 00:21:07.754, Speaker F: In most of these decentralized exchange systems, is there a personal nexus between the people who have developed the decentralized exchange tool and the people using the tool?
00:21:07.892 - 00:21:11.266, Speaker H: There actually isn't, because that's the whole point of the damn thing, is that.
00:21:11.288 - 00:21:13.442, Speaker F: We shouldn't have to trust a personal relationship.
00:21:13.576 - 00:21:14.866, Speaker H: We should be able to trust the.
00:21:14.888 - 00:21:22.546, Speaker F: Code and the math and the effective operation of the blockchain, which is all deterministic. It's all just a computer saying, yes, the digital signature is valid, and therefore.
00:21:22.578 - 00:21:28.710, Speaker H: The trade goes forward. So to me, this does mean that there's this big sector that is not.
00:21:28.780 - 00:21:51.754, Speaker F: Going to be able to be subject to some sort of permission based regulation. Now, you still might be able to get these people for touting if someone if a developer was out there also saying, like, hey, use my tool in order to sell this synthetic Tesla stock, which I know you're not allowed to buy in your home country, well, that's a whole different case. But asking that developer to license as an exchange before they can even publish.
00:21:51.802 - 00:21:55.090, Speaker H: The software, I don't think you can do that under the Constitution.
00:21:56.230 - 00:22:09.538, Speaker D: Yeah, and I actually just wanted to note also you briefly mentioned this, but SEC Commissioner Hester Purse, in her dissent, noted that the rulemaking was 650 pages and there were 220 separate comment requests.
00:22:09.634 - 00:22:11.094, Speaker C: And then she said the commission only.
00:22:11.132 - 00:22:26.810, Speaker D: Gave people 30 days to comment, and she believed 90 days would have been more appropriate. And so it's reminiscent of what happened at the end of the Trump administration with Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin when he tried to push through some rulemaking with a short comment.
00:22:28.030 - 00:22:30.194, Speaker C: You know, comment, Terry, that I noticed.
00:22:30.262 - 00:22:33.210, Speaker D: Again by Gabriel Shapiro of Delphi Digital.
00:22:33.370 - 00:22:37.146, Speaker G: He talked about know, if this rulemaking.
00:22:37.178 - 00:22:39.482, Speaker D: Did go through, then automated market makers.
00:22:39.546 - 00:22:44.146, Speaker G: Would need know, kind of comply with.
00:22:44.168 - 00:22:50.034, Speaker D: These different, like, registration with FINRA or some of the other things that you mentioned.
00:22:50.152 - 00:22:52.942, Speaker G: And then he said the primary purposes.
00:22:53.006 - 00:22:55.782, Speaker D: Served by exchange regulation, such as fair.
00:22:55.836 - 00:23:03.426, Speaker C: Access, public pricing auditability, are already intrinsically present in AMM architecture, and thus regulation.
00:23:03.458 - 00:23:15.446, Speaker D: Of AMMS as securities exchanges is not necessary. I thought that was super interesting. What did you think of that comment? And then what are the actual issues that you think the SEC should be concerned about when it comes to DeFi?
00:23:15.638 - 00:23:17.658, Speaker F: Yeah, I hadn't seen that before, but.
00:23:17.664 - 00:23:19.446, Speaker H: That'S a great comment from Gabe.
00:23:19.638 - 00:23:25.020, Speaker F: The reason again why we have something like exchange registration is because there is.
00:23:25.470 - 00:23:31.646, Speaker H: Is when I send an order to an exchange to buy or sell or.
00:23:31.668 - 00:23:35.298, Speaker F: Even a non firm trading order, which is kind of what they're trying to extend it to.
00:23:35.384 - 00:23:40.146, Speaker H: Ostensibly, with the Bloomberg terminal, there's somebody who's going to pick that up and.
00:23:40.248 - 00:23:45.310, Speaker F: Execute my wishes as I express them in the order or in the communications.
00:23:45.390 - 00:23:47.154, Speaker H: Right. And I have to trust that person.
00:23:47.192 - 00:23:49.654, Speaker F: To do that faithfully and transparently and.
00:23:49.692 - 00:23:51.638, Speaker H: In an auditable way, whether it's the.
00:23:51.644 - 00:23:53.218, Speaker F: New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq.
00:23:53.234 - 00:23:54.918, Speaker H: Or the Bloomberg Terminal even.
00:23:55.084 - 00:23:57.350, Speaker F: And all of these are proprietary business.
00:23:57.420 - 00:24:00.978, Speaker H: Models and they have often opaque practices.
00:24:01.074 - 00:24:04.314, Speaker F: And it's perfectly reasonable to require regulation from them.
00:24:04.432 - 00:24:05.786, Speaker H: And I think when people see our.
00:24:05.808 - 00:24:11.100, Speaker F: Space, they say, oh, well, these people are trying to replace that with software so they can avoid following the law.
00:24:11.470 - 00:24:14.686, Speaker H: That's just totally wrong. Actually, no, we're trying to replace that.
00:24:14.708 - 00:24:26.290, Speaker F: With software so that the interests of the law are embodied in the code itself. It has to be transparent now. It has to happen on an auditable blockchain. I love the way you go forward.
00:24:26.440 - 00:24:28.958, Speaker H: As a trade if the digital signatures.
00:24:28.974 - 00:24:58.890, Speaker F: Are correct and both parties genuinely committed to the transaction in a way where they can't back out. So a lot of the safeguards that we look for with securities regulation or exchange regulation are inherent in doing this peer to peer using auditable software on an auditable blockchain, whereas they are absolutely not apparent if you're using a trusted third party to do it. So regulation of the trusted third party makes total sense. Regulation of the software developer who publish the rules that are transparent and allow people to reach agreement peer to peer makes a lot less sense.
00:24:58.960 - 00:24:59.580, Speaker H: Yeah.
00:25:00.670 - 00:25:09.440, Speaker D: So since the comment letters were sent earlier this week, now what happens? What are the next deadlines or developments that people should be on the lookout for?
00:25:09.890 - 00:25:13.326, Speaker H: Oh, and one thing about Gabriel Shapiro's.
00:25:13.358 - 00:25:22.062, Speaker F: Comments that I think is also worth mentioning here is there are two rulemakings going forward. One right now is about this Exchange.
00:25:22.126 - 00:25:29.926, Speaker H: Act redefinition of exchange. There's a whole nother one about being a dealer in securities where they would.
00:25:29.948 - 00:25:35.894, Speaker F: Subject people with over $50 million in assets under management to dealer regulation, even.
00:25:35.932 - 00:25:40.454, Speaker H: If they're just sort of selling on their own account. And that has implications for things like.
00:25:40.492 - 00:25:42.470, Speaker F: As you said, automated market makers.
00:25:42.550 - 00:25:45.590, Speaker H: We haven't filed in that ongoing regulatory.
00:25:45.670 - 00:25:50.842, Speaker F: Process in the dealer one. We've just filed in the Exchange one, and the deadline for that was actually last week.
00:25:50.896 - 00:25:53.490, Speaker H: So sorry if your listeners haven't filed.
00:25:53.510 - 00:26:24.374, Speaker F: And wanted to file. So what's going to happen next? Well, both of these rulemakings, the Exchange one and the dealer one, are going to ultimately end up with final rules. There's no definitive timetable for that. That could happen tomorrow. In the case of the Exchange rulemaking, it could happen the day after the comment period closes for the dealer rulemaking. Or it could take months in both cases, I think if it takes a long time, it makes me a little hopeful that they read our comment and they took it to heart. They're obligated by law to read our.
00:26:24.412 - 00:26:26.390, Speaker H: Comment, but do they have to actually.
00:26:26.540 - 00:26:31.866, Speaker F: Take it to heart? I don't know. And maybe they'll be going back and rewriting these things.
00:26:31.968 - 00:26:34.106, Speaker H: If not, if the thing that gets.
00:26:34.128 - 00:26:36.522, Speaker F: Published in the Exchange rulemaking is really.
00:26:36.576 - 00:26:42.134, Speaker H: Just what it is right now, which I think unequivocally makes it an obligation.
00:26:42.182 - 00:26:49.118, Speaker F: For people publishing software to register. I think it's going to chill a huge amount of protected speech in this country.
00:26:49.204 - 00:26:50.526, Speaker H: Like, you're going to be like a.
00:26:50.548 - 00:27:09.346, Speaker F: Software developer and you're going to say, well, they expect me to register. I don't know anything about this world, and I don't think I'm engaged in an activity that should require registration. But I'm scared. I don't want a lawsuit against me. I've seen lawsuits that the SEC has brought against a lot of other people that I know. And so maybe I'll just stop working on this software library. I've got other interests.
00:27:09.346 - 00:27:48.718, Speaker F: I could work over here or maybe GitHub or the other websites where people publish these software tools and then the website like GitHub republishes them. They say, wow, hey, this is a tiny fraction of our business. We're mostly interested in being a host for Linux software libraries or something like that. So we'll just drop from our platform all of the Dex software libraries and that has massive free speech ramifications because you're basically losing this huge vital part of the internet where new tools and ideas for the future of human interaction are being shared. And we're saying, no, we're just not going to have that anymore in this country. It's too dangerous or something like that, which is very unamerican and I would also say unconstitutional.
00:27:48.814 - 00:27:51.026, Speaker H: And so there's this other case that.
00:27:51.048 - 00:27:53.970, Speaker F: We mention in our comment letter.
00:27:54.550 - 00:27:57.022, Speaker H: It's bonta.
00:27:57.086 - 00:27:58.294, Speaker F: Bonta.
00:27:58.332 - 00:28:01.510, Speaker H: And in this case the Supreme Court.
00:28:01.850 - 00:28:09.010, Speaker F: Was asked, can somebody bring a challenge to a law before the person who's supposed to enforce the law has even enforced?
00:28:09.170 - 00:28:11.198, Speaker H: We call it a pre enforcement challenge.
00:28:11.314 - 00:28:19.450, Speaker F: Or a facial challenge because you say the law on its face is unconstitutional. It's not the way that they're enforcing it, it's just the law on its face.
00:28:19.600 - 00:28:25.246, Speaker H: And in that case, Vonta, because it had to do with free speech, the.
00:28:25.268 - 00:28:50.514, Speaker F: Court said normally we have a high bar for people to bring lawsuits, pre enforcement challenges. We want to wait until see how the agency interprets it and brings a lawsuit. But in the First Amendment case, because there's so much protected expression which could be chilled, people who would have spoken but decided not to speak, decided to self center, we're going to allow pre enforcement challenges if a substantial number of potential applications of the law are unconstitutional. Restrictions.
00:28:50.562 - 00:28:51.266, Speaker H: On speech.
00:28:51.378 - 00:28:52.786, Speaker F: And in this case, if the rule.
00:28:52.818 - 00:28:55.126, Speaker H: Was published as it is, that's a.
00:28:55.148 - 00:28:58.214, Speaker F: Very easy bar to meet. A substantial number of applications of that.
00:28:58.252 - 00:29:02.278, Speaker H: Standard would be barriers to protected expression.
00:29:02.374 - 00:29:14.814, Speaker F: So this is what I meant by we the community. Somebody in the community, maybe Coins Center, somebody in the community could probably bring a challenge. The minute the rule becomes final, assuming it's the same rule that we've seen so far, because the Court would say.
00:29:14.852 - 00:29:19.546, Speaker H: Look, under the standard in banta, pre enforcement challenges are allowed.
00:29:19.738 - 00:29:25.486, Speaker F: We can sue the SEC, we don't have to wait for the SEC to sue us. And then we just go from there.
00:29:25.588 - 00:29:28.258, Speaker H: Go from the district court level to.
00:29:28.264 - 00:29:42.966, Speaker F: The circuit court level, maybe in a circuit where the judges care a bit more about free speech, and then all the way up to the Supreme Court, where the judges, the justices, rather care very deeply about free speech. I'll briefly say there's another section of our comment which I hope everyone will.
00:29:42.988 - 00:29:44.742, Speaker H: Read if they're interested in this, that.
00:29:44.796 - 00:29:53.178, Speaker F: Analyzes the Court Supreme Court as it existed in 1985 when they had the Low decision, which already unanimously protected speech rights against the SEC.
00:29:53.344 - 00:29:56.426, Speaker H: To today, with sorrel and cases like.
00:29:56.448 - 00:30:07.710, Speaker F: It, where they're protecting the rights of pharmaceutical data brokers, the Court is extremely interested in vindicating speech rights, especially even in the more capitalistic or free market.
00:30:07.780 - 00:30:10.094, Speaker H: Type areas where you have people making.
00:30:10.132 - 00:30:11.754, Speaker F: Money off of speech or using speech.
00:30:11.802 - 00:30:14.126, Speaker H: To do things like securities trading.
00:30:14.158 - 00:30:25.234, Speaker F: So I'm very optimistic that if this rule was not changed before it became final, there'd be a very promising case to be brought against it.
00:30:25.272 - 00:30:29.326, Speaker H: Obviously, this would all be worse than if they just didn't have the rulemaking.
00:30:29.358 - 00:30:39.560, Speaker F: Because there'd be this legal chaos in the midst. But I guess that is the part of me that is a lawyer. Even though I'm not a practicing lawyer, I kind of like chaos and the fight.
00:30:41.370 - 00:30:49.046, Speaker D: All right, well, we will have to see what happens next, but thank you so much for explaining all of this. It has been a delight to have you on Unchained.
00:30:49.238 - 00:30:51.740, Speaker F: Thanks, Laura. It's been great being here, as always.
00:30:52.130 - 00:30:56.474, Speaker D: Don't forget, next up is the weekly news recap. Stick around for this week in Crypto.

00:31:40.510 - 00:32:37.658, Speaker C: Thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap. Beanstalk lost $182,000,000 to a governance exploit on Easter Sunday. Beanstalk, a stablecoin project on ethereum, suffered an exploit worth $182,000,000 rather than a smart contract bug or theft of private keys. This was a governance attack. The Beanstalk hacker was able to get away with roughly $76 million in assets by taking out a Flash loan to purchase 70% of Beanstalk governance tokens, publishing and voting for a proposal that sent all treasury funds to the attacker and then paying back the Flash loan all in one transaction. The attack was rather sophisticated. To pull it off, the attacker took out $1 billion worth of assorted tokens on Ave and Flash loans and exploited Beanstalk's emergency commit function, allowing them to immediately execute their proposal without going through the typical lifecycle of a governance proposal.
00:32:37.658 - 00:33:08.520, Speaker C: Both of these moves required a high level of DFI knowledge and skill in the aftermath of the hack. Beanstock's bean stablecoin, which traded at $1 last week, was trading below $0.10, according to its Twitter account. Beanstalk is offering the attacker a 10% white hat bounty. For more information and discussion on Beanstock, check out this week's episode of The Chopping Block, where Tom Schmidt, Tarun Chitra haseeb Karashi and I go in depth on the Beanstalk hack and DeFi security in general.
00:33:09.530 - 00:33:10.982, Speaker G: An OFAC first.
00:33:11.116 - 00:34:15.754, Speaker C: A Russian miner sanctioned the US. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control for the first time added a crypto miner to its list of sanctioned entities on Wednesday. BitRiver, the Russian crypto mining firm, along with ten subsidiaries, has now been added to OFAC's special Designated Nationals list OFAC also sanctioned the publicly traded TransCapital Bank and 39 other individuals and entities. Treasury is also taking action against companies in Russia's virtual currency mining industry by operating vast server farms that sell virtual currency mining capacity internationally, these companies help Russia monetize its natural resources. Russia has a comparative advantage in crypto mining due to energy resources and a cold climate, wrote treasury in its press release. However, mining companies rely on imported computer equipment and fiat payments, which makes them vulnerable to sanctions. The United States is committed to ensuring that no asset, no matter how complex, becomes a mechanism for the Putin regime to offset the impact of sanctions, treasury.
00:34:15.802 - 00:34:18.922, Speaker G: Concluded in a statement shared with CoinDesk.
00:34:18.986 - 00:34:34.930, Speaker C: BitRiver CEO Igor Runits pushed back against the sanctions by calling them unfair. Runitz claims that BitRiver, whose parent company is based in Switzerland, has never provided services to Russian government institutions or sanctioned entities.
00:34:35.670 - 00:34:36.350, Speaker G: The US.
00:34:36.440 - 00:35:30.630, Speaker C: Going after Russia based miners could have massive implications. Russia is the third largest source of mining power in the world, accounting for over 11% of hash power, according to the latest statistics out of Cambridge. Furthermore, Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, expressed interest in Russia's crypto mining potential in late January. Additionally, the news comes shortly after the International Monetary Fund published a paper explaining how Russia could avoid sanctions levied in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine via crypto mining. Over time, sanctioned to countries could also allocate more resources toward evading sanctions through mining. Mining for energy intensive blockchains like Bitcoin can allow countries to monetize energy resources, some of which cannot be exported due to sanctions. The monetization happens directly on blockchains and outside the financial system, where the sanctions are implemented.
00:35:30.630 - 00:37:12.070, Speaker C: UST is now the third largest stablecoin terra's native stablecoin UST is now the 13th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and third largest stablecoin, narrowly climbing past finance's BUSD this week. The news coincides with a burst in price from Terra's Governance token Luna, which increased 17% between Monday and Tuesday. UST is still much smaller than Tether and USDC, which command an $82 billion and $49 billion market capitalization, respectively, compared to only $17 billion for UST. However, UST is now far and away the largest algorithmic stablecoin, meaning instead of being supposedly backed one to one with dollar equivalent assets like USDC and USDT, UST is designed to keep its peg to the dollar through a mint and burn mechanism. That being said, one reason that UST has become so popular lately is its transformation from a purely algorithmic stablecoin to a token with some backing, as Luna Foundation Guard has purchased over $1 billion in BTC to back the UST peg in times of crisis. Furthermore, Terra is now one of the largest buyers of CVX Governance token that plays a significant role in the liquidity of stablecoins on ethereum, which should give UST more applications outside of being used on Anchor, a borrowing lending protocol offering almost 20% interest in the Terra ecosystem. For example, on Thursday, the Terra and Fraxbacked four pool yield farm went live on Phantom, bringing in over $30 million in total value locked just hours after launching.
00:37:12.070 - 00:37:29.130, Speaker C: For more information on Terra, check out two recent episodes of Unchained with Terra cofounder Doe Kwan, who discusses LFG's decision to back UST with BTC, and then Galwa Capital's Kevin Zhou, who analyzes the risks associated with UST's dependence on Anchor.
00:37:29.470 - 00:37:33.066, Speaker G: In related stablecoin news, Tron founder Justin.
00:37:33.098 - 00:38:22.074, Speaker C: Sun announced plans for a new algorithmic, stablecoin USDD for Tron, which he claims will have a $10 billion backing from assorted assets via Tron dow. Moonbirds is mooning. Data from Cryptoslam shows that Moonbirds, a new NFT collection has accrued more volume in the last seven days than the following ten collections combined. And it's not even close. The 10,000 piece collection, which launched and sold out on Saturday, has racked up over 113,000 ETH in volume in the past seven days, equating to $344,000,000. For context, Mutant API Club, the second largest collection by volume during the same period, only did $64 million worth of volume. Moonbirds minted at 2.5
00:38:22.074 - 00:39:23.600, Speaker C: ETH, and less than a week later, the floor price for the entire collection is over 30 E, marking a quick twelve X return. The hype surrounding Moonbirds seems to be derived from its team proof collective founded by Kevin Rose, a partner at True Ventures. Proof's previous 1000 piece NFT drop, which grants access to an NFT investing and collection group, currently has a floor price of 97 E to join. According to the Moonbirds Roadmap, holding a Moonbirds NFT gives access to the proof discord where exclusive Moonbird related drops meetups in real life events, and most importantly, access to upcoming proof projects will be available. The project, however, did not go off without a hitch. As reported by CoinDesk, the project faced complaints about its expensive two five ETH mint price, along with claims of raffle manipulation and rarity sniping by developers. Coinbase NFT is here, and it's social.
00:39:23.600 - 00:39:51.782, Speaker C: Coinbase's muchanticipated NFT Marketplace was beta launched this week to a select group of customers. While only a small percentage of users from the 1.5 million waitlist were granted initial access to create a profile, buy and sell NFTs and so forth, anyone is able to check out the platform. For now, Coinbase's NFT Marketplace only supports Ethereum, but has plans to support other blockchains and fiat on ramps. Sanchez Sexina, VP of product at Coinbase.
00:39:51.846 - 00:39:54.986, Speaker G: Told the block Interestingly, the exchange made.
00:39:55.008 - 00:40:29.560, Speaker C: The choice to embed its NFT marketplace with social media tools. However, according to CEO Brian Armstrong, these social mechanisms are far from finished products. Coinbase NFT has a social component to it. Just want to acknowledge that we need to make social more decentralized over time. We're stuck in a web two five world still moving toward web3, he tweeted, adding assets are decentralized and identity can be decentralized, but follower graphs, comments and some of the post content are still centralized. Opportunity is about to move more of this on chain over time.
00:40:30.410 - 00:40:33.794, Speaker G: Time for Fun Bits Oops A DFI.
00:40:33.842 - 00:41:22.470, Speaker C: Hacker pulled off a self rug Zed A DFI protocol running on BNB chain was exploited on Thursday after an attacker successfully triggered a distribution vulnerability that three xed any rewards earned from the protocol. Overall, it was a smaller hack, with the block reporting that the hacker was only able to derive $1 million in volume from the vulnerability. That being said, data from BSc scan shows that Yid's token price crashed all the way to $0 in the aftermath. Now, why is this a fun Bits? Because the hacker ended up rugging themselves, according to Blocksec, a cryptosecurity firm. Blocksec explained. Interestingly, the attacker did not transfer the obtained tokens out before self destructing the attack contract. Probably he or she was too excited.
00:41:23.130 - 00:41:26.150, Speaker G: Robinhood CEO wants bigger Doge blocks.
00:41:26.490 - 00:42:23.830, Speaker C: Can Doge truly be the future currency of The Internet and the people? Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev wondered aloud on Twitter last week as currently constituted, according to Vlad, the answer is no, and for a familiar reason. For anyone who has been in the blockchain space for a while, tenev believes that Doge's block size limit and transactions per second metric of 40 is holding Doge back from being a global currency. Tenev is now arguing for Dogecoin to move from a 1 block size and later 10GB to compete with Visa's 65,000 transactions per second, even though it would increase hardware requirements for nodes to do so. A tradeoff that Tenev believes is fair. Tenev also pointed out that Dogecoin's inflationary supply comes out as being less than that of the US dollar. Thanks so much for joining us today.
