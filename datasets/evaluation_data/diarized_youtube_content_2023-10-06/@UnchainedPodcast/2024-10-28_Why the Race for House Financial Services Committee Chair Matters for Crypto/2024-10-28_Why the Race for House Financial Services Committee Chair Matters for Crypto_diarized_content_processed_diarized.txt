00:00:01.000 - 00:00:01.424, Speaker A: Hi there.
00:00:01.424 - 00:00:10.841, Speaker B: I'm Veronica Irwin. I'm the regulatory reporter at Unchained. And I am here with Wong Yanmin, the director of government relations at the Bok Chi Association. How you doing, Mom?
00:00:10.953 - 00:00:22.321, Speaker A: I'm doing great. It's a gorgeous day. I love it. So I'm doing fantastic. And crypto is still the election to prevent the worst. So it's busy as hell.
00:00:22.433 - 00:00:43.299, Speaker B: Definitely is. And I know a lot of people have been focused on the presidential election for obvious reasons, but I want to take a little bit of time today to talk about some of the committees in Congress that are also very important to crypto. And specifically the House Financial Services Committee. So just to start, why should we care about this committee? Why should we pay attention?
00:00:43.467 - 00:01:13.507, Speaker A: Well, there is a view that if you know one presidential candidate, particularly no activity, just sign up to figure or executive order, all of a sudden all problems go away. But actually, as we all know, it comes down to a lot of law that's growing on the books, all these laws in the 1930s. And so that's why it takes map commerce to change lead out to imposter fishing technology. And so we send them the Internet. And now crypto is going through the same issue. AI is coming after us, it looks like, too. So that's.
00:01:13.507 - 00:01:39.395, Speaker A: Our Congress is really important here. And the committees itself are even more important because the committees really are the destruction of who is chairing. So whoever is the lead party and that lead person who is in charge of that committee, they can really decide which direction they go. And you gotta remember things like the Agricultural Committee, vice services, they have plenty of other things they have to worry about as well. So, no, it's really important who is that chair and where they see crypto as the priorities.
00:01:39.695 - 00:01:49.303, Speaker B: And it seems like the House really could go either way. Could be Democrats or Republicans. So can you kind of go over who would be in charge? Let's start with the Republicans.
00:01:49.359 - 00:02:04.595, Speaker A: Controller, House. Okay, so the Republicans, there's four candidates right now. So for those who don't know, Patrick McClellan is retiring. He's the elite champion right now. So los something else, overseeing. That's why it's making. And so especially for the crypto industry, you want somebody who's a champion, just like M to carry that.
00:02:04.595 - 00:02:31.599, Speaker A: And the good news is that actually all four candidates right now have very heavy issues in crypto. I've talked to all the individually staff. They're very engaged. But. But once we look at French Mar, he's the Digital Asset Subcommittee chair right now. So he did lead a lot of state coin negotiations and he is working a little under Zipartisan. So even though we're if it were a Democrat administration Republican House feel he got to work across the aisle there.
00:02:31.599 - 00:03:10.715, Speaker A: So a lot of towards him especially his crypto knowledge is a really strong contender here. And the other one we'll look at is Andy Barr from Kentucky. He's more trapped by issues and so debating is kind of more of this main pet project you'd say. And so I would look at more stable coins, national security as well items anything on the wall front that's going to be a lot of these main concerns. The last two folks we have Frank Lucas Oklahoma now he's chaired the act committee and he's actually one of very few members who sits on House ad and financial services. So FIP 21 was going through both those committees. He was involved pretty heavily.
00:03:10.715 - 00:03:47.507, Speaker A: So look at Frank Point this is the competitor and the last is Bill Huizenga. He's from his chin now you can do the model in markets and oversight and so especially if there's a Democrat administration or against their genzer remaining at the sec. You know he could definitely someone that could speak the fire has done so the past four years and life will continue. So all worthing very well crypto on the Paladin side and I think we'll probably know probably December of new chair maybe you'll be in January. But all four of us men overall with them pretty confident crypto is going to be on the right path at least in the House.
00:03:47.691 - 00:03:49.891, Speaker B: And how about epic crowds control?
00:03:50.043 - 00:04:52.199, Speaker A: Well that's the good news actually it doesn't really matter using control here now again in terms of priorities that's where we'll see difference. But Maxine Waters at least how the House of GR she's going to retain the chair that she take over and she knew groups have stable points so stable warnings have been done this year was again scrap sheet and really talk about what the chess was going to look like. But she said stable points be the number one priority for her in this space. Now market structure that's where it's a little convoluted and a little different because she voted against it and was out really opposed to it every step of the way of the 21 so I look less water choker. But let's not forget Caris as well as the current White House when they are vening various Advertisers without veto bit 21 they did say they wanted to work in new record towards raining work and that has to go to maximum waters committee in some way, shape or form. So she could be all March structure. But I would definitely be more looking at stable coins achieved here.
00:04:52.307 - 00:05:04.511, Speaker B: Okay. And you know, we were speaking before video today a little bit about how just Republicans and Democrats have different rules for how this chair is selected. Can you talk about the differences a little bit there?
00:05:04.583 - 00:05:24.285, Speaker A: Yeah. So Congress did that, you know, a whole variety of rules. But there's also rules that apply to their own individual Congress and the parties. So Democrats, they more experienced. They like to have experience. They really do value that. And so there's a rule that if you are a schedule committee or ranking member, the leader of your party for that committee, you can stay there as long as you want.
00:05:24.285 - 00:06:07.805, Speaker A: Now, there's other books down war 2 year especially for growth enterprise more younger who are saying it could be 30, 40, 50 years until they get to that point because they have to wait till that person leaves chair for one reason or another. Whereas the Republicans is different. It's every six years for child. Now, this has been a controversy national unit for fine Twitter as a whole, where a lot of people say, hey, I was in my board for six years and I didn't do anything because the chair runs everything. So technically, now that we're in power, I want to be a chair and make decisions. And by the rules of conference, they can't do that. But there are some waiters, sleeping gigs, rules Senate, Congress.
00:06:07.805 - 00:06:30.801, Speaker A: But you get a lot more fresh blood which has to grow pops. So at least crypto states it does trend more young cooks and augers. But overall, you know, the time is turning significantly in D.C. that build very confident no matter who's in charge. Especially in a house we're getting some predator. Oh, so that's good.
00:06:30.833 - 00:06:31.257, Speaker B: Nate.
00:06:31.361 - 00:06:32.081, Speaker A: Hey, trust.
00:06:32.193 - 00:06:33.425, Speaker B: Thanks so much for walking us to.
00:06:33.425 - 00:06:35.025, Speaker A: Me with you, of course. Anytime.
