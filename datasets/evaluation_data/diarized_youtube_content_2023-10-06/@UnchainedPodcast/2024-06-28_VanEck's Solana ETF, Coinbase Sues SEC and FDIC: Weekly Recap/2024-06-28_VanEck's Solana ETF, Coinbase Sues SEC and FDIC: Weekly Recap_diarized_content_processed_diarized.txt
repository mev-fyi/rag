00:00:00.920 - 00:00:53.522, Speaker A: Welcome to this week's crypto roundup. In today's recap, we cover Vaneck's new Solana ETF filing and its fee waiver for the Ethereum ETF coinbases, lawsuits against the SEC and FDIC, and the latest updates on FTX's reorganization plan. We'll also discuss Julian Assange's release, funded by crypto donations, Blast's major airdrop, and the new tools unveiled by the Solana foundation. Additionally, we'll touch on the increased bounty for the crypto queen Ruja Ignatova and ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse's criticism of SEC chair Gary Gensler. Thanks for tuning in to the weekly news recap. Let's begin Vanek files for Solana ETF declaring sole a commodity investment manager Vanek filed for a spot Solana exchange traded fund in the US. This follows the SEC's approval of spot ETF's for bitcoin and Ethereum.
00:00:53.522 - 00:01:47.906, Speaker A: If approved, Vaneck's proposed Solana Trust would be listed on the CbOe BZX exchange and would value its shares based on the market vector Solana benchmark rate. Matthew Siegel, head of digital assets research at Vaneck, announced the filing on Thursday, claiming that SOL functions similarly to bitcoin and Ethereum, thus categorizing it as a commodity. This contrasts with the SEC's stance, which has previously classified Saul as a security and enforcement actions. Vanek waves fees on Ethereum ETF as SEC approval nears Vanek didn't stop with Solana this week. The investment firm also plans to waive fees on its proposed spot Ethereum ETF, until 2025, or until the fund's assets under management reach $1.5 billion. Vanek Siegel said the strategy aims to establish the firm as a leader in crypto ETF fees and drive investor interest into Ethereum.
00:01:47.906 - 00:03:04.732, Speaker A: He highlighted the potential for increased decentralized finance activity to boost ether prices, which will also benefit Vanex holdings. The SEC could approve several spot ether ETF's, including Vanex, as soon as July 4, according to readers. Discussions are in their final stages, with only minor issues left to resolve. Meanwhile, Ethereum entered its longest inflationary period since the merge, with its circulating supply increasing steadily for over 70 days. Coinbase sues the SEC and FDIC for regulatory information on Thursday, Coinbase, the largest us crypto exchange, filed lawsuits against the securities and Exchange Commission and the FDIC for failing to comply with Freedom of Information act requests. These lawsuits, filed in Washington, DC, seek to obtain documents about the agency's approaches to crypto regulation Coinbase alleges that regulators, including the SEC and FDIC, have deliberately pressured banks to deny crypto firms access to the federal banking system. The lawsuits aim to reveal the SEC's internal stance on Ethereum and the FDIC's pause letters, which instructed banks to halt crypto related activities.
00:03:04.732 - 00:04:16.320, Speaker A: Coinbases actions reflect growing tensions between the crypto industry and federal regulators over the transparency and fairness of regulatory practices. FTX to poll creditors on reorganization plan amid bankruptcy proceedings FTX bankruptcy advisors will begin soliciting creditors for feedback on the crypto exchange's chapter eleven reorganization plan during a bankruptcy hearing on Tuesday, where lawyers for both FTX and its creditors debated a disclosure statement. Judge John Dorsey gave FTX's advisors the green light to solicit creditors to vote on the plan, despite some creditors opposing it and demanding payouts in cryptocurrencies rather than the dollar value as proposed. Creditors have until August 16 to vote on the plan. Andrew Diederich, who represents FTX, highlighted the lack of major objections at the hearing, calling the plan largely consensual. Conversely, David Adler, who represents three creditors, criticized the disclosure statement as woefully inadequate and raised concerns about significant tax implications if payouts are made in cash instead of crypto. Judge Dorsey is set to make his decision on whether to approve the plan on October 7.
00:04:16.320 - 00:05:04.792, Speaker A: Blast's airdrop goes live, drawing attention to Linia and scroll Blast, an ethereum L2 scaling network, distributed 17 billion blast tokens in its eagerly awaited airdrop. The distribution began on Wednesday, with over 35% of the tokens claimed within hours, according to Parsec Finance's blockchain Explorer. This airdrop comes as Blast hit an all time high in daily transactions and active addresses. In a notable allocation, Blast also provided 3 billion blast tokens to the Blur foundation, enhancing their governance participation. Both protocols were founded by Titian Roquer, also known as Pac man. As of now, blast is trading at 2.4 cents, valuing the airdrop at approximately $400 million.
00:05:04.792 - 00:05:59.654, Speaker A: With the blast airdrop underway, attention is shifting to other ethereum L2 networks, such as Linia and Scroll. Both networks have seen increased activity and total value locked as users anticipate potential future airdrops. Linea has grown by 15% in ether deposits over the past month, while Scrolls TVL has surged by 40%, indicating strong interest in these platforms. Julian Assange's released travel costs were funded by crypto donations. Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, has agreed to plead guilty to a charge of illegally obtaining and disclosing national security material, resulting in his release from a british prison. This plea deal, expected to end his long standing legal battle with the US, involves Assange serving a sentence equivalent to his time already spent in detention. Assange's release travel expenses were nearly covered by a significant bitcoin donation, and 8.07
00:05:59.654 - 00:06:49.320, Speaker A: BTC, or $496,000 contribution, quickly met most of the $520,000 needed for his charter flight to Australia. Additional funds were raised through various cryptocurrencies and fiat donations. The free Assange campaign stated, Julian's health is in dire need of recovery. We are launching an emergency appeal to seek donations to help him cover the flight debt and ensure his recovery and well being upon his arrival. Every contribution counts. Solana foundation unveils, blinks the Solana foundation introduced innovative tools that can turn any website or app into a gateway for crypto transactions. The first tool, named Actions, enables users to perform on chain transactions directly from websites, social media platforms and even QR codes.
00:06:49.320 - 00:07:57.614, Speaker A: Another tool, blinks, short for blockchain links, converts these actions into shareable links, making any URL a starting point for transactions on the Solana blockchain. These tools aim to enhance mainstream adoption by integrating blockchain functionality into everyday digital platforms. Initial testing and utilization will involve teams such as cubic, tensor, Jupyter, Helios and several others. Despite potential risks of malicious links, the Solana foundation assures users that only trusted partner domains are whitelisted, adding an extra layer of security to these new tools. FBI increases bounty for crypto queen Ruja Ignatova to 5 million the US Department of State has raised the reward for information leading to the capture of Ruja Ignatova, also known as the crypto queen, to $5 million. Ignatova, who vanished in 2017, was the mastermind behind Onecoin, a fraudulent cryptocurrency scheme that defrauded investors of over $4 billion. Despite reports of her alleged murder, the FBI remains committed to finding her.
00:07:57.614 - 00:08:45.700, Speaker A: Onecoin, launched in 2014, was marketed as a revolutionary cryptocurrency, but was actually a Ponzi scheme. Ignatova disappeared after a us warrant was issued for her arrest. The FBI suggests she may have altered her appearance or started using a false passport. Meanwhile, other onecoin associates have faced justice. Co founder Carl Sebastian Greenwood received a 20 year sentence, and legal chief Irina Dilkinska was sentenced to four years. The increased bounty aims to bring Ignatova to justice and provide closure to the victims of Onecoin's fraudulent activities. Ripple CEO criticizes SEC chair predicts political impact Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse claimed that SEC chair Gary Gensler will cause President Joe Biden to lose the upcoming election.
00:08:45.700 - 00:09:46.244, Speaker A: Garlinghouse's comments followed Gensler's remarks at the Bloomberg Invest summit, where Gensler highlighted significant noncompliance occurring in the crypto industry and the legal troubles of several prominent figures. Garlinghouse, responding on X, criticized Gensler for his stance and handling of past incidents such as the FTX collapse. He argued that Gensler's actions are detrimental to both the crypto industry and the Biden administration's political prospects. On this week's Tuesday episode of Unchained, crypto lawyer Sam Enzer called Gensler one of the most controversial chairs in recent history, citing multiple missteps, including the SEC's misrepresentations to a judge in the detbox case and Gensler's evasive responses to Congress about investigating ether. Enzer questioned the Democrats commitment to being pro crypto and pro innovation while keeping Gensler in his position. And that's all. Thanks so much for joining us today.
