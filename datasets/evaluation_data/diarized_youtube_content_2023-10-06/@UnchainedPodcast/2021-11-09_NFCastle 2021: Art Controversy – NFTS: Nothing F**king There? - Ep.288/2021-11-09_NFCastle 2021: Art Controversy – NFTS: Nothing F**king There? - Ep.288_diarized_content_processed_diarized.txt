00:00:04.090 - 00:00:10.846, Speaker A: Hi, y'all. Before we begin, just a quick reminder that if you want to preorder my book, the Cryptopians Idealism greed lies in.
00:00:10.868 - 00:00:13.034, Speaker B: The making of the first big cryptocurrency craze.
00:00:13.082 - 00:00:59.610, Speaker A: You can do so at bitly cryptopians. That's bit ly cryptopians. And second, today's episode is a really fun and controversial panel that I moderated at NF Castle, put on by the Czech Noble family, the Lopkovitz family, at their palace in Prague Castle. This panel was called Art Controversy NFTs nothing effing there. The speakers were maria Paola Fernandez, co founder at Jpg. Kavita Gupta, co founder of Fintech TV oliver Halzman Rosenberg, an artist and Gmoney NFT collector. This discussion is definitely one to remember given the surprising and sometimes even shocking stances of some of the panelists.
00:00:59.610 - 00:01:28.230, Speaker A: And as I mentioned last week, I am excited to tell you more about the Lopkovitz family and why they've turned to NFTs in a future episode. But for now, enjoy this super fun discussion from Nfcastle. Buy, earn and spend crypto on the crypto.com app. New users can enjoy zero credit card fees on crypto purchases in the first 30 days.

00:01:48.290 - 00:02:07.242, Speaker B: All right, well, this is going to be a really fun panel because, as we all know, since no t's burst onto the scene, they've been doing pretty much nothing but creating a lot of controversies and there's a lot to cover. Why don't we just do a quick spin around the panel so everyone can make their introductions? Should I go first? Yeah, go ahead, Vicky.
00:02:07.326 - 00:02:39.034, Speaker C: Okay, so I am Maria Paula. I've been in the blockchain space for a while. I got to know NFTs in 2018, where I also bought my first ones. And I didn't think it was a big deal, but I was super interested because I'm interested in culture, and it sort of solved the problem with provenance in the art world. Then I continued researching about them. I published two papers. I am still working blockchain infrastructure.
00:02:39.034 - 00:03:02.920, Speaker C: I serve at the board at Golem. So I didn't think this could become a business until this year, where NFTs started booming. And I started my own business that's called JPEG or Jpg. But we pronounce it JPEG as Web three natives. And, yeah, it's a curation protocol. So, super excited to be here. Thank you, everyone, for having me.
00:03:04.490 - 00:03:05.014, Speaker D: Thank you.
00:03:05.052 - 00:03:05.618, Speaker B: Laura.
00:03:05.714 - 00:03:46.118, Speaker D: Hi. My name is Kavata Gupta. I started my journey in crypto back in 2013. But I think ethereum is what made me realize a lot of excitement in the space for NFTs. I was very fortunate, which feels now to be a part of the first ever standard paper back in end of 2017, early 2018, which actually a lot of people over here would know. The first time when we did the Standard paper, we got bashed by half of the crypto community because most of the people felt like how the asset collateralization is going to work on it. But I'm very, very excited to see how NFT has come up in the space.
00:03:46.118 - 00:04:00.330, Speaker D: We also did one of the first checks into the top NFT companies today with OpenSea, Dapperlab, Dada, Soraya, et cetera. And now I recently launched my own early stage venture fund, Delta Blockchain.
00:04:00.830 - 00:04:52.154, Speaker E: Okay, thank you, Laura, and thank you to William Jr. For inviting me here to be with you all. My name is Oliver Halzman Rosenberg. So I'm a Gemini. I have like, multiple personalities, so I'm an artist and I'm an estate manager, and I'm a tech startup founder. And I can talk about all those projects extensively, but I've been doing art and technology since 2004, 2005, doing interactive pieces with communities using pre Skype laptops set up in streets and cities. And we would ask people to come to the laptop and we'd draw their dreams and wishes, live for them.
00:04:52.154 - 00:05:21.140, Speaker E: So I've always been engaging in what art and technology can be and also from a philosophical sense. I write papers about consciousness and the metaverse and quantum physics and spirituality and identity. So I'm just approaching this space from so many different angles. And also, as an NFT artist myself, I started making NFTs like a year ago. So lots to say about all this.
00:05:21.750 - 00:05:33.430, Speaker F: And I'm g money. I'm a collector in the space. Investor. I currently run in VC Infrastructure Fund with Delphi Digital and just an all around NFT advocate.
00:05:33.850 - 00:05:34.310, Speaker C: Okay.
00:05:34.380 - 00:06:01.694, Speaker B: And so for those watching in the live stream, also, Gmoney asked not to be on video. So if you are just hearing a voice coming out of nowhere, that is who is speaking? All right, so let's just start with a super basic question. And this one has sparked a lot of conversation pretty much throughout the life existence of NFTs. But what are NFTs? Are they actually valuable cultural objects or are they just a new vehicle for speculation? Oh, yeah, expound on that.
00:06:01.732 - 00:06:03.120, Speaker C: I mean, why not?
00:06:05.010 - 00:06:36.426, Speaker B: But do you think that NFTs will retain their value because right now in Ether rock or not right now, but as of like a month ago, which, by the way, if you don't know what an Ether rock is, it's basically a clip art of a rock. And there are different colors, I guess, but it's just clip art. And the cheapest one, as of a month ago, was going for a little over $3 million. So I don't know what you want to say about do you really think that an ether rock is still going to be worth $3 million or more in the future?
00:06:36.528 - 00:07:16.450, Speaker C: I didn't say that. I just think that people are actually we are talking about a new universe, however you want to call it, metaverse or any other less cringe sort of denomination. We're talking about a future where people are deciding their own mediums of exchange. And within these mediums of exchange, NFTs happen to be the prime and most COVIDable asset. And it happened with spices before. Maybe cardamom was hot back then. And then people decided to adopt cardamom and paid shitloads of money for cardamom.
00:07:16.450 - 00:07:44.320, Speaker C: And it didn't have to make sense. It was about the value that people gave to the spies or to the rock or to the punk, obviously, because that is culture exchanging stuff between people and creating economies. It's part of the culture and growth culture as well at the same time. So why not both things?
00:07:47.110 - 00:08:36.130, Speaker D: I would say exactly what Paula actually tried to say is the value is defined by the market, right? Even for a currency, a gold or platinum, it is supply and demand and it is what do you really like? But I think NFT overall for me get divided into two categories. One is play and earn, and the other one is collectible. Now play and earn is completely going to be driven by gaming and metaverse. Industry more than just speculation when it comes to collectible, I think demand is speculation. Why is Picasso much more important than ten other artists, right? Somebody came and decided this is way more valuable than anybody else and this is going to be the base price for it. And I think for Ethroc. I have been actually waiting to see if Ethroc value going to go down.
00:08:36.130 - 00:08:53.254, Speaker D: But the more people an NFT comes in, looks like that clip art still has way more value than lot of new interesting metaverse project coming out. So I don't see at least for one or two more crypto winters for the ETH rock prices to go down.
00:08:53.292 - 00:09:17.566, Speaker B: Laura well, but I find it interesting what you said about the Picassos because I feel like the view is that there's something kind of inherently valuable in a Picasso and the talent of that person that created that cultural object in a way that I don't think you could really attribute to ether rock. Here we have an actual artist and then right next to a collector. So I'm curious to hear I'm going.
00:09:17.588 - 00:10:24.994, Speaker E: To give you an artistic answer, which is I'm going to zoom out a little bit and look at NFTs more like a means of communication. We're living in a new mythological age and I see it's the myth of decentralization that's happening. And the NFTs are like the medium of distribution of this idea and this concept. If you look back through the history of culture, mankind has always been using art to communicate something. And art has been married to technology from cave painters in the last Co caves, figuring out how to get palm prints to stick for 60,000 years, or whether it's sculptors or the pottery wheel and just the advancement of the different tools to create a permanent record of something. So no matter what the content of the NFT is itself, it points back to the blockchain. And what is the blockchain? It's this decentralized David versus Goliath like mythological time period that we're living in now.
00:10:24.994 - 00:11:24.360, Speaker E: And I think we can get into the nitty gritty about which artists doing what with what technology. But the zoomed out view, I think NFTs are you look at the Homer's Odyssey or Gilgamesh's or even the Bhagavad VAD Gita. These are chanted songs that are repeated through repetition. And all these transaction on the blockchain and the repetitions and the minting of multiples, it's all reinforcing this concept of the blockchain and as this new form of communication that we have as a culture to communicate with each other. So the art is just like one example now of what it is and I think it's fascinating and I'm so excited by it, but I also think there's like a much larger narrative happening that we're all participating in whether we realize it or not.
00:11:25.210 - 00:12:09.974, Speaker B: And actually, before we turn to G money, I do want to ask you, though, because you were saying when we did the prep for this panel, something that is nowhere near as kind of highfalutin as what you just said, which is you were like, oh, I got this grant to do NFTs on Polygon. Which, for those of you who don't know, is a side chain on Ethereum, where essentially the fees are just so much cheaper. So it's like much, much cheaper to mint NFTs. And you told me that collectors said that they weren't going to be interested because it wasn't on Ethereum itself. And so to me that says something about just how NFTs really are more about status, right? Because if that's what they're interested in, then essentially they're trying to say we have the money to buy NFTs on Ethereum where the fees are high. Am I wrong? What's your interpretation of and can I.
00:12:10.012 - 00:12:17.574, Speaker D: Just quickly add which I added during that time that I was so hurt because we are early investor in Polygon and you don't think polygon is no.
00:12:17.612 - 00:13:04.278, Speaker E: No, I love polygon and I think we'll get to this later. And I know you have a lot to say on the status flexing, but just to wrap up the polygon part, I think, okay, for the green aspect on blockchain, it's smart to find a low cost, transactional, environmental friendly alternative to Ethereum. But I also realize that because the gas fees are so expensive for Ethereum, it keeps a certain level of market entry. Not everyone can enter into the market. So because Polygon is so inexpensive, people were getting spammed AirDrop polygon. So that's why there was a disdain against it, not because of the technology at all. I think it's a great technology.
00:13:04.278 - 00:13:15.254, Speaker E: I think they're going to be around and maybe not so much in the art space, but as a blockchain layer, two protocol, for sure, polygon are a great alternative. But I know you have a lot to say on ethereum.
00:13:15.382 - 00:13:56.342, Speaker F: So I guess one thing as a collector, the reason why I prefer ethereum over other chains is just because the provenance of it, right? So much stuff has already been on there besides just NFTs. It's a very secure protocol. Why wouldn't I want my art to be on the most secure protocol out of anything out there that I collect? And I do think that there is status in art, right. Whether the art world cares to admit it or not. If you're spending 100, $200 million on a painting, it's not necessarily because it's the best painting of that period. It's because there's a story behind it. It means something to you and your counterparts, and you're trying to show that off.
00:13:56.342 - 00:14:05.142, Speaker F: Right. So NFTs, if NFTs are about flexing, they're about flexing just as much as the contemporary art world is, as far as I'm concerned.
00:14:05.286 - 00:14:32.530, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, I wanted to ask you about this really funny tweet that you tweeted. So basically, crypto punks were originally on ethereum, but when they showed up on solana, there was an investment group that tweeted about how it spent a quarter of a million dollars on one of these rare punks, but was on Solana and you tweeted back at them. Imagine going to Chinatown to buy a fake Chanel bag and then tweeting about it. So tell us what you were thinking when you tweeted.
00:14:33.270 - 00:15:32.498, Speaker F: Like, I personally, as a crypto punk holder, I loved it because any other you don't go and buy fake products of something that is not valuable, right. So if you're willing to spend money on a fake version of something, that means the real version is worth a lot, right? So anytime somebody will do a copycat project like they do on a bunch of all these other side chains where you see all these crypto punk projects pop up, it just reinforces the crypto punk meme. Right. It makes crypto punks that much more valuable because you have people telling that narrative. But I just think it's funny because if you think that the story behind crypto punks isn't necessarily that they're these cool eight bit digital pictures, it's the story behind it. The community that reformed naturally around it. The group of people that I'll admit, when I first found punks, I thought they were ugly, right? And now I look at the punks that I own, I'm like, oh, that's a beautiful punk.
00:15:32.498 - 00:15:53.882, Speaker F: I really like that one right. There's this really intricate community that is really involved with it. So when you're sitting there and you're buying like a knockoff and then bragging about it, I just think that's really funny because people, like I said, if somebody buys a fake bag or fake something, they don't brag about it. They try to hide the fact that it's a fake.
00:15:54.026 - 00:16:11.586, Speaker B: But isn't that a little bit against maybe the democratizing ideal of blockchain? Everybody likes to claim that that's one of the reasons that they got into this. And so if you're just trying to keep things rare and only for certain group, how do you kind of yeah.
00:16:11.608 - 00:16:33.834, Speaker F: But I mean, that's the nature of the project, right? They made 10,000 of them and they weren't going to make any more. Right. That was the concept of the whole project itself. They weren't like, oh, we're going to make 10,000 and we'll keep on releasing more over time. Nouns is a great example, right. They make one every day in perpetuity. Right.
00:16:33.834 - 00:16:51.482, Speaker F: And that's the rules of that game, right. And so it's like when you sign up for the game or you sign up for the project to be a collector, these are the rules. If tomorrow Larva labs announced that they were making 10,000 more CryptoPunks, I'm sure the market would tank for crypto punks.
00:16:51.546 - 00:17:13.698, Speaker D: But I think I want to add to another layer to it. Isn't it also about the provenance, like the ownership rights and the IP rights associated with it? So if I created something and I am the creator or the owner of it, and then some new chain comes in tomorrow and just copy paste it without having me or my dao associated with it, how is that even blockchain world legal?
00:17:13.794 - 00:18:20.466, Speaker C: I mean, why are we talking about intellectual property when we are actually building on the base of cyberpunk's ideals where intellectual property is not going to be a thing? I don't think that's actually the right way to see crypto punks. I do appreciate a lot than the initial CryptoPunks, and it's about he had said it so well. It's about the community that's around them. It's about the fact that they were the first ones and taking a little bit more into the philosophical sort of realm. There was this guy a long time ago, his name was Walter Benjamin, he wrote a book that was an essay, sorry, that was called The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction. And basically what it proposes is that an artwork can be reproduced infinitely, but the original piece retains the aura. And the more it's reproduced, the more the aura is diluted.
00:18:20.466 - 00:18:41.054, Speaker C: So that's the way that I see crypto punks versus binance punks or solana punks or whatever chain punks, the original crypto punks, have that aura, have that community. You can't take that away from them. The others, like intellectual property or not, they can change it a little bit and it's not going to be intellectual property anymore.
00:18:41.102 - 00:18:48.258, Speaker D: But no, I wasn't talking about intellectual property. I think it's more about the ownership rights on NFT, like the whole idea of NFT.
00:18:48.354 - 00:18:52.246, Speaker C: But what does the ownership actually on NFTs give mean?
00:18:52.348 - 00:19:25.954, Speaker D: That's why I was going to that the whole idea of the NFT. If you read the original standard paper or the whole ownership rights or the provenance right is between the creator, how many pieces you are doing, and then using the blockchain. The idea of putting it onto blockchain is to basically having that whole ownership chain built on there so that tomorrow, if you have one of the rocks, which is now very expensive piece, you can know whether this is an original one or this is the fake one. You can still buy a fake one.
00:19:26.152 - 00:19:52.650, Speaker C: We're talking about fake ones. They not only have that provenance, but they also don't have the community and everything associated. So there's two parts of the whole thing, of course. There's the ownership part that's publicly on record forever, all the attributes of the blockchain you want to give them, but there's also the erratic sort of permanence of the actual you want to say something?
00:19:52.720 - 00:20:28.022, Speaker E: Yeah, I just think the zoomed out view is that there's a lot of new people in the space that don't know that the original punks were on ethereum and they're just like, oh, that's the thing to get. Oh, it's on Solana. So there are people behind these launches that are taking advantage of newcomers into the space. And it's not unique to crypto punks. It happens in Mechaverse and whatever project, even with the board API club. So what it is, is there are people that are taking advantage of newcomers in the space.
00:20:28.156 - 00:20:34.934, Speaker C: It's not taking advantage, it's giving them the ability to purchase whatever they want and give them the subjective value.
00:20:34.972 - 00:20:40.106, Speaker E: But if you buy a board ape on Solana that doesn't come with the.
00:20:40.128 - 00:20:47.690, Speaker C: IP, that the board will they sleep at night? I think they will be happy. They just have an ape.
00:20:48.910 - 00:21:05.466, Speaker E: If a project gives the IP to somebody and then the owner, if you have the ownership of an NFT and you get the IP rights as the owner, and then someone just mints the same thing on a different chain, and that new buyer is going to think that they have the IP, that creates confusion.
00:21:05.498 - 00:21:05.694, Speaker D: Right.
00:21:05.732 - 00:21:07.006, Speaker E: That's all I'm how do you know.
00:21:07.028 - 00:21:14.510, Speaker D: You have a fake currency till actually somebody doesn't come and prove it. But if that currency is still getting accepted and has a community behind it, it's a currency.
00:21:14.590 - 00:21:26.790, Speaker C: Let's take it to the time where you couldn't afford designer bags, but you really wanted sort of like the vibe around it and you bought the fake designer bag. I had no problem designer bags, okay?
00:21:26.860 - 00:21:28.326, Speaker D: That's what I could afford.
00:21:28.518 - 00:21:58.740, Speaker C: Well, some people would buy the fake designer bags and pretend they were that, because it's a little bit of a LARP as well. And this world is about flexing wealth and pretending things. There's so many people out there in crazy places like San Jope or elsewhere pretending they have money and having dupes of things is actually more pretending. And that's their whole existence. So we shouldn't really judge them.
00:22:00.630 - 00:22:27.082, Speaker F: I think what Oliver is getting at, though, is the fact that you have people. It's almost like when you fork a project, right, and the fork isn't as. It's trying to take advantage of the same name that the original project have. And so somebody that doesn't know any better is buying in thinking, hey, I'm buying a crypto punk. It's a cheaper version of a crypto punk, but it's not a crypto punk. Right, but I understand what you're saying in the sense that the provenance is on chain. To me, provenance is key, right.
00:22:27.082 - 00:22:49.378, Speaker F: We're moving towards a world that code is law, right. At some point there won't be IP law that gets handled in legal courts down the future, and we're setting the road for that, but we're not there yet. Right. But right now, if I'm coming into the space, I'm like, okay, I can buy a crypto punk for $1,000. You're not buying a crypto punk, you're getting scammed. Right.
00:22:49.464 - 00:22:51.250, Speaker C: It's not our job to protect people.
00:22:51.400 - 00:23:02.402, Speaker F: Right, but then at some point, then at some point, what you're inviting for regulators to come into the space and say, hey, now we have to have hard consumer protection laws if we can't regulate the space ourselves.
00:23:02.546 - 00:23:10.890, Speaker C: Well, clearly if regulators can't actually figure out anything about our space, I don't expect them to figure out the difference.
00:23:10.960 - 00:23:12.554, Speaker F: Between that doesn't mean they're not going to try, though.
00:23:12.592 - 00:23:15.974, Speaker C: Crystal punks, that's your first controversy.
00:23:16.022 - 00:23:17.370, Speaker D: Laura, congratulations.
00:23:18.750 - 00:23:46.838, Speaker B: This is the perfect segue because I was going to ask next about rug pulls and there have been so many rug pulls in NFTs as well. And I mean, you just said that it's not your job to protect people, but I mean, some of this stuff is really pretty terrible. Promising. I can't remember what was iconics where they proposed, oh, we're going to do this 3D thing and then people just got emojis. I mean, it's like terrible. Or the one where they sold and.
00:23:46.844 - 00:23:49.494, Speaker D: Then they $5 t shirt for two.
00:23:49.532 - 00:23:53.798, Speaker C: E. Wait, I didn't yeah, but there.
00:23:53.804 - 00:24:02.838, Speaker B: Was another one where they literally swapped the file and it was photos of rugs, which is like terrible. They did that. I mean, it's like, it's awful.
00:24:03.014 - 00:24:04.380, Speaker E: Conceptual piece.
00:24:05.230 - 00:24:07.690, Speaker B: So you think that that should be allowed?
00:24:09.630 - 00:24:17.882, Speaker C: Raise your hands if you have never been rugballed in your whole crypto life. If you're a crypto native, you have never been rugballed.
00:24:17.946 - 00:24:18.270, Speaker D: No.
00:24:18.340 - 00:24:47.400, Speaker C: Okay. I'm proud of you. I have, and I've been in crypto for almost four years working, five years working, and I had to make mistakes and that's how you learn as well in the real world. Also, no one's going to protect you. Banks will say that they're going to protect you, but then in the end, they're going to be the ones that they're going to screw you the most. So really, if you don't build your own thick skin, who will do it for you?
00:24:48.330 - 00:24:53.414, Speaker B: What do the rest of you think should there be no protections for rug pulls? I don't know, self regulatory?
00:24:53.462 - 00:25:17.486, Speaker F: I think it's a fact of life. Right? They're going to be rug pulls. It happens. But we can try to stop that as much as we possibly can or try to educate people as much as we possibly can, right? Not everybody needs to learn the same lesson the hard way. Right. And when people get hacked, they always share the story of how they ended up getting hacked. So more people don't get hacked.
00:25:17.486 - 00:25:25.620, Speaker F: Right. It's a sad fact that there will be rug pulls but what can we do as a community to make that better over time?
00:25:26.470 - 00:26:31.130, Speaker D: I think it's a combination of both, right? Of course there are going to be fake projects. There are going to be projects which even after being fake going to get a lot of reputation for one or the other reason, going to have big community. But I've seen different behaviors from this community which has sometimes pleasantly surprised me and sometimes like maybe that's the way I think. There was a project which one of my friend who is in the audience actually was telling me about that somebody took an open source quote from one of the NFT project, copy pasted it, 90% of it and created a whole dow and an NFT project around it. But when the original artist actually realized, he complained and the dow for the second project made the founder to share 50% revenue with the first founder and it's like three weeks back actually when it happened. So I think there are going to be more and more dow oriented, sort of like legal supervision which is going to happen, which is amazing because that's the core of the decentralized crypto world. But there are also going to be issues which Dao will not be capable or informative enough to be able to do it.
00:26:31.130 - 00:27:07.330, Speaker D: And I do feel like the more regulation going to come into the space, the more ownership rights we're going to really value. This is going to get better. But I also funnily do agree with you that when we're going to have projects which are going to be copy of something or 20% copy of something I think at the end of the day they are your expression. If you don't call exactly the same. Like if there is some Silvet change in CryptoPunk and you call it crypto Silvet. It's a new project. But then at least you're not comparing it to the original.
00:27:07.330 - 00:27:09.890, Speaker D: And then I won't judge them, I promise.
00:27:09.970 - 00:27:46.900, Speaker C: No, for sure. But also what you said about dows coming into the scene and deciding what's right and what's wrong in the context of a Dow being sufficiently decentralized and not just like an elite club which is really important. I think that's actually the key. If we can create dows that are sufficiently decentralized and able to make their own decisions and do the social condemnation for the users that are getting scammed or are just dumb or they just want to flex, then that's actually a really pretty decent world.
00:27:47.350 - 00:27:49.540, Speaker D: Yeah, but as an artist, what do you.
00:27:55.030 - 00:28:23.662, Speaker E: Look? They're fake paintings in the art world. I just saw a Netflix documentary about this gallery that had to close in New York because of all the fakes that they were know DYOR. It's a big acronym in the crypto space. Do your own research. It's a rite of passage, I think talking about the zoomed out mythological thing. Okay. You get burnt and you learn and everyone's in the discords and everyone's sharing like, hey, watch out for this.
00:28:23.662 - 00:28:57.650, Speaker E: Oh yeah, that mechaverse. Did a fake pre launch page. And if you connected your MetaMask, it pulls everything out. Or don't open that. If anyone gets AirDrop this token, don't open it because it has some malicious code that empties your wallet out. So it's a very open space. I think that's the beauty of the whole crypto NFT world is that it is a lot about community and then people get exiled and if they get doxed for being behind a project that did a rug pull, it's like game over.
00:28:57.650 - 00:29:02.140, Speaker E: So it's going to happen. But that's part of life.
00:29:02.750 - 00:29:21.870, Speaker B: Well, this is definitely like the crypto anarchist panel because I feel like in crypto itself and in DeFi, there was a lot of talk about self regulation and I think there actually were a few different self regulatory bodies that said they were going to set up. And you guys are all like, no people just tough luck for them if they get screwed.
00:29:24.630 - 00:29:59.370, Speaker C: There's good things coming out of all of that. When Uniswap got vampire attacked and then we all got rug pulled, that was not fun. We were all part of the Sushi Farming crazy fever. But then actually Sushi Reorganized understood that was fucked. And they're actually a fully fledged business right now. They have a fully operational Dex. Miso is a platform for auctions that's functioning.
00:29:59.370 - 00:30:56.958, Speaker C: They had some obstacles as well, but it's going really well. They have onsen as well, so good things can come out of all of that. Yam is another example founded by actually one of JPEG's co founders. They didn't get rug pulled, but there was like a main flaw in their code and huge mess happened. But then Yam reorganized based on the community that they had created and now it's also a fully fledged project. So the thing that I believe not from the crypto anarchy side, but more from the we are super flexible and also have temporary amniches side, is that you can create things out of almost nothing because there's so much going on in the space that, yes, there are rug pulls, but at the same time, people tend to forget, and then that's time to build for you. It's all time.
00:30:56.958 - 00:31:13.780, Speaker C: You can create your own things, you can reborn projects. There's a great capacity. For redemption and for acceptance of that redemption. So, yeah, nothing is the end of the world in this weird world.

00:32:35.490 - 00:33:18.554, Speaker B: Yeah, clearly so many things have happened and it still marches on. But I do wonder there have been some other controversies, like around kind of a form of what we would call insider trading, but I don't know if that term applies because at least in the US. It specifically applies to stocks. But there was the head of product at OpenSea who was caught kind of, like, trying to profit from what he knew was going to be featured on the OpenSea homepage. And I'm just curious, what do you think are maybe some best practices that the community should adopt or should there is it just common sense or what's your take on?
00:33:18.752 - 00:33:53.894, Speaker F: I mean, obviously I'm not a fan of right. Like, I think that that's an internal decision policy that needs to be made at OpenSea and any of those marketplaces. I haven't really thought about it that much because I'm not an internal policy maker. Right. I think it sucks. But I also know that when I buy stuff, I try to do my own research, especially now that I know my wallet gets tracked and people will see me mint something or buy something and buy it just because I'm buying it, regardless of maybe I'm just buying it because I'm like, oh, I like the art. Right.
00:33:53.894 - 00:34:30.482, Speaker F: I think that this is cool whether I think it's going to make money or not irregardless. But I know that I have that responsibility to people because I'm a public figure in the space of people, like, tracking my wallet. And I think that all these marketplaces and organizations need, these founders need to make decisions, being like, okay, well, I know that this could be market moving information and we have to develop policies internally for it. A lot of it comes down to ethics. Like you said, it's not regulated, so there's no necessarily breaking the law. But it's ethically dubious at best. Right.
00:34:30.482 - 00:34:52.418, Speaker F: And it's like, how do you want to be perceived by the community and do you want them to trust you? Right? Because once, especially as a marketplace, if you lose that trust, then people just won't want to transact on your platform and you're going to lose volume over time. So these are ethical decisions that need to be made, but they do have long term consequences to each business owner.
00:34:52.594 - 00:35:01.580, Speaker B: But one question is, do you feel that this kind of thing makes NFTs financial products? And should they be regulated as such.
00:35:02.350 - 00:35:15.310, Speaker F: Then you'd want to regulate? I mean, I think everything in the world is an NFT. So if you want to relate, I mean, it's true, right? Like you're wearing a shirt, I'm wearing a shirt. If we were to exchange shirts, we don't have the same value. Right. So they're non fungible.
00:35:17.890 - 00:35:20.242, Speaker B: If we exchange the shirts, they don't have the same value.
00:35:20.376 - 00:35:22.654, Speaker F: Yeah. Like you're wearing a shirt right now and I'm wearing a T shirt.
00:35:22.702 - 00:35:22.866, Speaker B: Right.
00:35:22.888 - 00:35:25.138, Speaker F: If we were to exchange our T shirts right.
00:35:25.224 - 00:35:27.922, Speaker B: We don't necessarily have the T shirts themselves. Don't have okay.
00:35:27.976 - 00:35:28.194, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:35:28.232 - 00:35:48.140, Speaker F: So we have different values of our T shirts. So they're non fungible. Right. So my thesis is that over time, as the world becomes more digitized, they will be coming on chain as non fungible tokens right? Because everything in the world is non fungible. So if you want to regulate NFTs, you have to regulate pretty much every industry and commodity and product in the world.
00:35:48.830 - 00:36:50.190, Speaker D: Can I go back to your first question where I think we talked about OpenSea? What I'm going to say is a very unpopular stan, but I want to say in this particular case, in just this particular case, I don't think the individual did it knowingly. When I think of insider trading coming from trading flow regulated background, when you think of insider trading, you think of insider trading. It's something which you have planned, through which you have done it with steps, by talking to somebody. Like there is a whole process around it. In my completely personal opinion, I feel like this is someone who got super excited about a particular product, bought it, and then whether he knew it at that point of time or didn't know it at that point of time, that this is about to go on the main page, but this is actually going to increase his value. Or not to the extent, but for 18 e, this is a very good learning lesson for the rest of the NFT community. It's not a big amount, to be honest.
00:36:50.190 - 00:37:55.700, Speaker D: If I would tomorrow have to do insider trading, I hope I'll do it at least for 1000 E. But I hope I add some value. But like for 18 E, whatever happened to the individual who is actually one of as much as I know about him, directly or indirectly, a very hardworking individual? That happened and unfortunately, or whatever happened in that case, but I believe that it did open the floodgate of talking about insider trading. But then to the core of your question, if there is a value associated with any product, whether you are buying a milk from the street, whether you are buying a burger from a restaurant, if you are paying anything to that, there is a value associated with that. There is also expectation of a fair game associated with that. So of course you expect that fair game. Does it have to be regulated all the way to SEC CFTC level at this part when we are still figuring out what NFTs are and what is actually going to be the future and potential of it? I'm not 100% sure.
00:37:56.390 - 00:38:04.006, Speaker C: What hurts the most is that they were so dumb. Good OpSec would have do you think.
00:38:04.028 - 00:38:04.726, Speaker B: What he did was okay?
00:38:04.748 - 00:38:34.160, Speaker C: It's just no, I think it's bad. But what hurts the most is the bad OpSec. The same with the case that we had this past week. Everything traceable to ENS addresses. In a world where we know how to be anonymous when we don't want to be anonymous, we also know that it's just as if they were naive enough.
00:38:35.490 - 00:38:51.026, Speaker D: I think he's a smart enough guy, right. I personally really think he just really didn't think that it is going to be perceived as insider trading, whether that was a smart move or not. And I'm not trying to defend that people should do insider trading if this is an insider trading.
00:38:51.058 - 00:38:53.638, Speaker B: Wait, but so you know him personally? Is that what you're saying?
00:38:53.724 - 00:38:58.520, Speaker D: And you have I know the guy. It's not like I was with him when he was doing this.
00:38:59.450 - 00:39:02.310, Speaker B: But is that how he presented it to you?
00:39:02.380 - 00:39:02.842, Speaker D: I'm sorry?
00:39:02.896 - 00:39:04.218, Speaker B: Is that how he spoke about it to you?
00:39:04.224 - 00:39:29.586, Speaker D: No, but I think this is the way I see it, knowing whatever I know limited about the guy firsthand or secondhand that I don't think in this space if you are such a crypto native and you want to do as she's saying. Some sort of a fraud. First for 1718 ETH and secondly, not even a single attempt to mask it whatsoever. Just doesn't even make sense in a practical space.
00:39:29.768 - 00:39:47.282, Speaker B: Okay, well, this actually goes to another question that I was going to ask about, which was about privacy. What's your take like G money when you were saying that people are now following you? Do you have kind of like your own private other address that no one knows about or do you feel comfortable.
00:39:47.346 - 00:40:41.574, Speaker F: Just no, I definitely have an undoxed wallet. Right. Because I also know that, like I said, sometimes I just want to mess around and I think something like I want to mint something just because I think it's cool and whatever. I don't think much of it. I will do something in there, or if I want to trade something, I'll do something in there. But I'm very cognizant and I think this raises a really interesting question of because things happen on chain and because things are on chain forever, your ethics matter so much more in crypto than necessarily the law, right? Because whether obviously at this point in time there's no laws regarding NFTs and insider trading or whatever it is, I think what was done was wrong. I know that if I was in that situation, the way I see it is you have one reputation and there's no amount of money that will pay for that reputation.
00:40:41.574 - 00:41:01.600, Speaker F: But I think that this is an interesting part of the world of the movement that we're currently in where it's people realizing that you have to hold yourself to an ethical standard, right? Because people can view your actions on chain and that's what's going to matter in the long run, whether it's illegal or legal in the court of the law.
00:41:02.290 - 00:41:02.750, Speaker C: Okay?
00:41:02.820 - 00:41:51.934, Speaker B: So I also actually also wanted to ask a question for Oliver, just about creators. Because earlier today, I was talking with Will Papper, who was on the previous panel, the creator of Adventure Goals, and he was saying that when he had some ideas on how to do more adventure goals for additional communities that. I mean, he said some of this was probably ingest, but people were sending him death threats and other people were threatening that they were going to commit suicide, and that's kind of crazy. And I was just curious, even when you talked about building on polygon, how do you think about your responsibility to your community and how you kind of either preserve value for them, but then also, as we talked about earlier, pursue the democratizing ideals of blockchain technology, right?
00:41:52.132 - 00:43:21.562, Speaker E: So gosh, there's a lot to talk about here. So let's talk about value. Let's talk about we're all here because pretty much that beeple sale, right? I mean, let's be honest about it, everyone realized, okay, money like crypto NFTs and then everybody wanted to jump on board. So when I saw that, I realized, okay, here's a big opportunity to create a marketplace, taking that energy and that excitement around NFTs and teaming up artists with charities and doing, like, a charity marketplace and making that a dow so that we can take this energy and still release amazing art, but that we're supporting people on the ground doing the work. Because in ten years, if we all have the genesis this or that NFT and the world is like in climate crisis extreme, like, who cares about any of this, right? So there's an opportunity here to use this technology and all the amazing aspects of it to help support what needs to really be happening outside of this interest bubble. And I think essentially that will make more people support it when they see that it's actually reaching out. It's not just enriching early investors, but it's actually going out to support the rest of the planet in this moment.
00:43:21.562 - 00:44:55.642, Speaker E: And then I'm doing another project that's like kind of like a surrealist game, kind of similar to Loot, but also similar to Board Apes with the IP, where I'm just creating this addition is called Perpetual Epiphany Galactic Travel Agency. And I have all these assets that people can get from their passports to luggage to suitcase, and it's basically like a choose Your Own adventure thing. But I'm trying to give away these assets to the community so that they can then build and do something inspiring instead of just having a profile picture from a project. But it's like, okay, now you have the passport and the luggage and the boarding pass and this planet and this thing, and all the artwork is like Gan based. I'm very interested in artificial intelligence stuff, so I'm like, in that project, I'm trying to give my creative work to the audience that they can then create something outside of me. But then on the flip side of that, I manage my grandfather's photo archive, and I have to be very careful to not give up his IP and find innovative ways to make NFTs of his photographic work where I'm not selling it to someone who thinks that they have the IP. So then my brain has to totally restructure and think, okay, I have these physical objects, what can I do interesting with this physical object, how can I bring this into the metaverse? So then I'm very interested in metaverse stuff.
00:44:55.642 - 00:45:23.954, Speaker E: So there's so many ways I think there are just so many opportunities we have outside of just putting an image, like uploading a JPEG to these platforms and saying it's an NFT and putting an addition number on, like, it's such an innovative time. And I've just been nerding out on file types on YouTube because there's so many interesting file types that OpenSea can't even necessarily allow you to upload. So anyway, we're just at an innovative time.
00:45:24.072 - 00:45:47.930, Speaker B: I do actually want to ask about this question about taking physical world objects and making NFTs of them, because obviously William here is trying to do something similar with the collection here. But how do you do that in a way where, like, for instance, G Money, would you feel comfortable at this moment in time that if you bought something like that, that would be secure and that you wouldn't get rug pulled?
00:45:48.750 - 00:46:23.638, Speaker F: If I bought a physical asset linked to an NFT, it already exists. There are people and artists that have created physical works that are linked to an NFT. Beeple did his everyday right, like there was a physical part that was linked to an NFT, but they have since a lot of them have been broken apart. I think it's a really interesting case. Probably the tech probably needs to get a little bit better with regards to linking that physical in a tamper proof way to the NFT. But I'm really excited about it. I definitely think it's going to happen.
00:46:23.804 - 00:46:59.780, Speaker D: Actually, it recently happened in India. The royal family of Jaipur took some of the old pieces from the palace, and then they did the NFT, but they actually gave the option with different price points that you could also have the physical piece basically transported to you, which you can just keep it in the storage and only have the NFT piece basically displayed. Or they can keep the Elk, they can keep the physical piece there, which you are so called, like, donating it to the museum. But then there will never be another NFT or more than particular amount of NFT ever be printed of those.
00:47:02.790 - 00:47:12.870, Speaker B: Like, if you were to buy one and then the relationship would be broken between the physical art and the NFT, would that concern you? Do you still feel like the NFT would be valuable.
00:47:15.370 - 00:47:58.290, Speaker D: For these old pieces, which is by Ravi Raman, which is like a big Indian painter from 16th century. They said that the original physical piece is so called with this money donated to the museum, and so the physical piece will continue to be there. And they did three NFT for one piece for that particular piece. And you're never going to break the physical piece for sure, I hope. And one of my friend actually bought one of those pieces. And I think the idea that before there was not even a chance for anybody to display that piece because it has always been with government of India to now somebody authentically can have it in their living room is actually exciting.
00:47:58.890 - 00:49:25.390, Speaker E: I mean, also just there's so many like when this whole Afghani crisis was happening, I wrote to a director of the museum. I was like, hey, let's go into your archive of Afghani jugs and take something out of the basement that's collecting dust and make it into an NFT. Whether you do a 3D scan of it or a photograph of it and have that money go to support people in that country right now, there's just such a wealth of in real life assets that can be creatively integrated into this space to benefit people. And also creating metaverse objects where there isn't a real physical object, but you're creating an object that can then be brought into the metaverse is also just another interesting use case. Where is this a real physical object? I did an NFT project where I had a leaf, I painted on a leaf, and I minted that as an NFT. I said, if you buy this, I'll send you the actual physical leaf, which is going to disintegrate over time, and then you can choose to resell it and send it or keep it, and it was this kind of conceptual experiment like, well, what's the real art? Is the real art the fragile leaf that was painted on it? Or is it the photograph of that which is alive on the blockchain forever? So it's just like, it's a very playful space. And that's also as an artist that I want to bring to this conversation, is just that it's such a new space.
00:49:25.390 - 00:50:13.034, Speaker E: And I think when my grandfather was collaborating with Dali, it was like playful. It was just like it was about, what can we do? Like, how can we wow people? And there were no rules. It was like, rules are out the window. So I think the most innovative projects coming out of this space are like the Nouns project where you're just minting something every day and it's just the auction based per day. I mean, just for me, the coders are the Beethovens of the future. They're the ones who are writing these codes that are so fascinating. And in the first panel we were talking about who are the real Dalis in the space or the real Beethovens? And it's essentially, I think, like the technologists.
00:50:13.034 - 00:50:46.694, Speaker E: This is like a technically based art form. And I think that there are just some genius technologists out there and it's a very collaborative space too. So I think it's going to be about the team. We heard about on the second panel, the investor who only invest looking at the team. So it's just this idea of people coming together in this playful spirit. It doesn't have to just be about finance and valuable. And I think the most interesting projects are going to be the most playful and innovative and those will become the most valuable over time because they were the most innovative.
00:50:46.694 - 00:51:01.198, Speaker E: And it wasn't just a market grab. It wasn't just some celebrity coming into the space doing something to make money. It's just somebody like saying, hey, imagine if. And to me, that's where the real magic happens in this space.
00:51:01.284 - 00:51:11.938, Speaker D: Also, status. Now, I don't know if you have noticed, I have friends who have Ethroc and cyberpunk, and their biggest problem in life is which one to show off on their display picture. So I think there is a lot.
00:51:11.944 - 00:51:24.680, Speaker B: Of status associated with it. I think NFTs at heart are really about status. But okay, we're going to do a quick lightning round. We have two minutes left. What about NFPs and climate change? Does that concern any of you?
00:51:25.850 - 00:52:10.898, Speaker D: Actually, yes, but I don't know how many people know, like Maroon Five, the famous band So Smartly, did their NFT with a dow for all their followers with just $5 in, who could decide that every NFT they would sell? Which climate charity should that money go to? And I feel like there are so many different ways of doing Taos. But then, as you were talking about that big artists coming into the space to make money, you also have Maroon Five doing it completely for their charity and letting people decide which one is a good one. And I think that was so successful they were able to move multimillion dollars within a month of their launch.
00:52:11.074 - 00:53:32.670, Speaker C: I think there's also a lot of misinformation and opium around climate change, whether L2 solutions of that e two is going to fix it and we're all going to go green. Actually, no one has the required knowledge. I've yet to see any big VC or any big NFT company to have proper climate scientists coming into their team and advising them and giving them proper knowledge and maybe not what to do because it's such a hard problem but at least to back up all the shit that they're saying with a couple of actionable items or facts. I read one of my collaborators, he was brilliant. One of the VCs was saying, okay, what can we do about climate change and the NFTs? And my collaborator said, it actually boils down to basic chemistry questions that you're not answering and no amount of money can give you the answer unless you put the work and connect with those scientists. And we have not done, you know, just to try to guess things because we read it in a brochure or at the Guardian or we watched too many Greta Thunberg speeches. It's not fair.
00:53:32.670 - 00:53:49.938, Speaker C: It's not fair for them, it's not fair for us because we got burned at the stake as well. And it's really annoying to be part of like a harassment, I think, you know, since we have all this capital flowing, why don't we hire the people that are able to give us at least decent answers?
00:53:50.034 - 00:53:53.510, Speaker B: Yeah, I love that. I also agree there's not enough data. Go ahead.
00:53:53.580 - 00:54:25.522, Speaker E: Just elon. Musk. Love him or hate him, all the miners moved out of China, the bitcoin miners, and they went to Texas. And now Texas is all of a sudden talking about renewable energy because Elon Musk said, I'm not going to be into bitcoin till it's 50% renewable. Also, El Salvador just made bitcoin their currency and they're doing thermal dynamic volcanic energy. So I think if anything, the crypto space is like leading, pushing the green agenda. And I think it's great and I think more pressure should be put on it because this is the most innovative space.
00:54:25.522 - 00:54:42.086, Speaker E: I think the smartest people right now are working whether they're like fintech, DeFi or coders. I just think the mental energy of this time period is operating in this space. So why not make this an issue and let us solve it as a community?
00:54:42.188 - 00:54:44.598, Speaker D: We are out of time. Just adding one more stat very quickly.
00:54:44.684 - 00:54:45.510, Speaker C: Greenman.
00:54:46.570 - 00:54:58.758, Speaker D: Green, Canadian Green Mining Company is now actually delivering renewable energy driven heating system to 1100 properties in Vancouver out of bitcoin mining residual energy.
00:54:58.844 - 00:55:06.670, Speaker B: Interesting. Okay, good. A nice positive note for the future. Thank you all so much. This was a really wonderful panel, and we're out of time.
00:55:06.740 - 00:55:07.790, Speaker A: All right. Thank you.
00:55:07.940 - 00:55:08.380, Speaker F: Thank you.
