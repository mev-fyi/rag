00:00:02.730 - 00:00:21.226, Speaker A: Hey, everybody, welcome to the chopping block. Every couple weeks, the four of us get together and give the industry insiders perspective on the crypto topics of the day. So quick intros. First up we've got Tom, the DeFi maven and master of Memes. Next up we've got Robert, crypto connoisseur and captain of Compound. Then we've got Tarun, the gigabrain and grand Poohba at Gauntlet. And joining us today, a special guest.
00:00:21.226 - 00:00:38.834, Speaker A: We have Taylor Monahan, the matriarch of MetaMask, but not the CEO. Very important. Not CEO of MetaMask. And then we have myself haseeb I'm, the head hype man at Dragonfly. So the four of us regulars are early stage investors in crypto. But I want to caveat. Nothing we say here is investment advice, legal advice, or even life advice.
00:00:38.834 - 00:01:00.750, Speaker A: So we've been off for a couple weeks and we picked a really amazing couple weeks to not be talking about the news. And so now we have just the most just absolutely lurid backlog of stuff that we have to talk about, unfortunately. But Tay, it's nice to we've actually never met. It's great to meet you and thanks for coming to hang out with us on this really depressing podcast.
00:01:01.730 - 00:01:05.250, Speaker B: I'm so excited to be here on this really depressing podcast.
00:01:06.070 - 00:01:09.380, Speaker C: Also, the chopping block is now known as the.
00:01:12.950 - 00:01:14.610, Speaker D: Bear market rebrand.
00:01:15.590 - 00:01:22.262, Speaker B: We need it. I mean, this is going to be a tough show. The two weeks is a really long like these past two weeks have been.
00:01:22.316 - 00:02:01.938, Speaker A: Extremely yeah, so just by way of background so Tay, you were the CEO and founder of MyCrypto, which used to be combined with my ether wallet. You guys broke off, you ended up getting acquired by consensus, and now you're one of the masterminds behind MetaMask, but not CEO. But you're known for being one of the loudest voices advocating for UX and security in crypto. And that's how I think of you, is that very often whenever there's something that goes horribly wrong in crypto around security or UX, I always know that you're going to have an amazing hot take about it. What do you perceive as being your role in crypto? Because that's what I perceive your role as being.
00:02:02.104 - 00:02:34.494, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that that's pretty accurate. I think bigger picture is sort of like, I want to say the things that need to be said right, regardless of what they are. And I think that crypto needs a lot more mindfulness around UX security. Keeping in mind that there's people that are using these things with their real life money and that the things that we build have consequences. If the ecosystem were to suddenly become mindful and intentional and make purposeful design decisions, I'd probably be talking about something.
00:02:34.532 - 00:02:36.686, Speaker A: Else that's very fair, actually.
00:02:36.788 - 00:02:47.602, Speaker C: Just to start, what's the definition in your mind of like a mindful and purposeful design decision? Because I feel like that has changed in and of itself over the last probably two years.
00:02:47.656 - 00:02:52.914, Speaker D: Do you think EIP 1559 was good or bad for us?
00:02:53.112 - 00:02:58.200, Speaker C: Wait, that gets answered second. That gets answered second. We're answering these questions in order.
00:02:59.050 - 00:03:55.570, Speaker B: I think that it's actually quite a low bar, right? Like being mindful in this space only requires you to be aware that your actions could impact other people. That's the bar that it's so low. It is so low because so many people are just running around without a care in the world. I think if this industry matures the bar might be raised like a tiny bit and then you want to think about not just like how do you prevent bad, but how do you actually ensure that you're building things that are creating equality and creating the right incentives. Right? And with regards to 1559, it's turned out a lot better than I expected. I will say that, I will say that technically speaking, I was never doubting the technical side of it. It was more like the implementation and especially on the user facing products, specifically the wallets.
00:03:55.570 - 00:04:35.118, Speaker B: There was definitely like, I don't know, all of a sudden all of the wallets were like we have to do this thing and we're not prepared and the documents were not the greatest. And then as I was looking around there were so many expectations that had been set in the community that for example transactions were suddenly going to be way cheaper. That was the perception that I was seeing a lot of and I just saw this potential for a super mismatch of expectations and then not delivering on any of them and then everyone gets hurt or disappointed know, bad things like that. So just a little reset on the hype narrative.
00:04:35.214 - 00:05:23.714, Speaker A: Well we've got the same thing happening now with the merge where a lot of people seem to believe the merge is going to cause more block space or fees to go down or something. And we have what is it? Morgan that just issued a report, know, hot off the JP. Morgan has figured out that the merge is not going to lower transaction fees. So I'm glad we have TradFi to the I think, well, look, we've got a lot of wood to shop today because there's a lot of bad stuff that's happened in the world in the last few weeks. And I think a lot of it, unfortunately a lot of it is less connected to UX so much as it's connected to just the financial plumbing that makes crypto tick. And a lot of that has gone wrong over the last couple of weeks. And so I think that that's been the big story around one, the massive price decline we've seen, but also this broader just meltdown that we've seen in the crypto market.
00:05:23.714 - 00:05:50.694, Speaker A: So let's start from the top. So all this started with two big precipitating events. So you guys remember obviously last month in early May you had the collapse of Terra Terra, although it kind of scared everybody. It spooked the whole market. And we saw a broader drawdown because of the collapse of Terra. Terra was pretty isolated, or at least it seemed right, like nothing else really relied on Terra. Nobody else was really using UST outside of the small cohort of the atom sort of Cosmos community, as well as, like, the Terra satellites.
00:05:50.694 - 00:06:19.382, Speaker A: But most everything else was basically fine, or so we thought. So now it turns out there's a really big firm called Three Arrows Capital. Three Arrows capital. For those of you who don't know, three Arrows Capital was a prop firm, meaning that it's a firm that doesn't take outside capital, or at least mostly doesn't take outside capital, mostly trades their own money. And the own money was of two guys, Suzu and Kyle Davies, who were American expats who had moved to Singapore. They used to be forex traders. They got into crypto and they were some of the most successful crypto traders basically in history.
00:06:19.382 - 00:06:54.718, Speaker A: They turned single digit millions into over $10 billion at the height of the market. They were big investors into Terra Luna. And of course, Terra Luna went horribly south. They lost a lot of money on that, but by all indications, they were still a fairly large and very strong firm. And they were also very aggressive investors. So they kind of took on this tiger like strategy that they would invest huge amounts of money into private deals, kind know, talk their book, mark them up, be super aggressive. And so it turned out that after the decline of Terra, three Arrows decided that they wanted to try to make up their losses, they wanted to try to get back even.
00:06:54.718 - 00:07:36.162, Speaker A: And the way that they were going to try to get back even is through two particular trades. The first trade was a GBTC trade, which we've talked about before on the show, which is very briefly, GBTC Bitcoin Trust. It trades at a discount to par if the GBTC trust is converted into an ETF. Basically, if an ETF is approved, particularly grayscales, then this thing will you'll be able to immediately make up the discount and get out, make like 30% overnight. And so Three Arrows was betting really big on the GBTC trade, betting that the discount was going to close. And then second, they were also betting on the Lido St ETH trade, which is one that Tarun has brought up on a previous show, TLDR on that. Basically, it's leveraged staking.
00:07:36.162 - 00:08:11.750, Speaker A: You take some ETH, you turn it to St ETH, you borrow against it, and then you just lever up and you keep putting it into St ETH until you get really significant APY on your Ether, where the natural rate of interest on Ether is relatively low. So they were doing both of these trades, and both of these trades unwound in a really massive way. I don't think we have time to describe exactly why they unwound, but they totally unwound. They lost tons and tons of money. But it turns out they didn't just lose their own money. Normally, and I want to make this clear because I think a lot of people don't understand why the Three Arrow story is so bad. Normally, if you go make a big trade and you lose a bunch of your own money, it's fine.
00:08:11.750 - 00:08:43.106, Speaker A: It's not a big deal, right? Funds go to zero all the time. If you went to zero, somebody else made the money. Two people bet against each other. That's how markets work, right? But Three Arrows was borrowing tons of money from other people, and they were also not telling their counterparties exactly how much leverage they were taking on and exactly who they were borrowing from. And so it turned out they borrowed so much of other people's money that they lost so much money that they went into negative equity, meaning that they owed more money than they had. And that is really bad. That is way worse than going to zero.
00:08:43.106 - 00:09:10.918, Speaker A: Because when you go negative, that means that now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet. Somebody else is absorbing the loss that you took by gambling like crazy. And the people who are absorbing those losses are basically the crypto lenders. Or you can sort of think of the lenders as the crypto banks. These are people who are basically involved in the act of money creation. And so some of their big lenders include BlockFi, Genesis, Voyager, celsius also lendered to Three Arrows.
00:09:11.094 - 00:09:12.502, Speaker D: Highly likely.
00:09:12.646 - 00:09:38.182, Speaker A: Highly okay. Yes. Highly likely. And so it turns out that a lot of the money in crypto a lot of the lenders in crypto were extending credit to Three Arrows, and this credit was under collateralized. And so now they're massively in the hole. So when the banks lose money, this is extremely bad because this now means that the banks need to control their risk and the way they control their risk because they now realize they're down a ton. They need to start recalling their loans to other people because they don't know who else got hurt, they don't know who else is down.
00:09:38.182 - 00:10:00.278, Speaker A: So they start recalling loans everywhere. A bunch of people suddenly start getting margin called. And these people are getting margin called. They might not have the cash on hand. So they need to start selling some assets in order to meet the margin call or to go repay the loan. And in this situation, you get a bunch of people selling at the same time. And not only that, but liquidity is worse because the market makers who are managing the liquidity and keeping markets liquid, they're also getting their loans recalled.
00:10:00.278 - 00:10:36.290, Speaker A: They also have less money, so they can't keep markets liquid. And the end result is just a meltdown. And so that's what we saw over the last couple of weeks. We saw this massive fear around exactly how bad was Three arrows in negative. How much money did the banks lose? How much of these loans are getting recalled and how long is the selling going to take? And that's caused an absolute wreckage in the crypto markets, where at times we actually saw Bitcoin and Ether sell off more than the Alts, which is extremely rare. And that's a sign, basically, that what's happening is forced. It's not a people have lost confidence in bitcoin and Ethereum, it's that something really bad has happened in the market and now you have forced selling.
00:10:36.290 - 00:10:46.086, Speaker A: So that's a very, very broad TLDR of what happened with Three Arrows. There's more to come, but I'll stop there and take your guys reflections on the whole Three Arrow saga.
00:10:46.278 - 00:11:27.510, Speaker D: So a couple addendums, because that was an unbelievable summary haseeb, and I hope people just hit play to get the TLDR on it. A couple Clarifications, as I understand them, and I could be incorrect on this, so one, Three Arrows Capital was actually doing this levered GBTC Arbitrage trade for years. Not to make it all back from Luna, but this is something that they were heavily engaged in for an extremely long period of time, oftentimes using GBTC shares as collateral to borrow. This is a very long standing trade. They previously lost a lot of money on it, I know that for a fact. It's not a new trade. They've been doing it for years and years and years.
00:11:27.510 - 00:12:18.966, Speaker D: At one point, they were contributing borrowed bitcoin to get the GBTC shares at Par, hoping to sell them at a premium back in the days where it was a premium. And then later, I think, trying to borrow Bitcoin to buy it at a discount, but always with the same general concept of borrowing Bitcoin to speculate on this vehicle and then using the shares as collateral to borrow more Bitcoin. They were widely known to be huge borrowers with that structure. So that's the first clarification. The second clarification is that, as I understand it, their primary trade to make it all back was not like staked Ether, which is illiquid. It wasn't just the grayscale trade, but they were just directionally, extremely long crypto. They are widely and publicly very bullish on the future of crypto prices.
00:12:18.966 - 00:12:39.658, Speaker D: And I think they were caught borrowed levered long, a lot of L1s, and just big believers in the long term price targets that they had set. And they had such high conviction that they were willing to go all in on it, and they just got completely slammed and all the money they borrowed is not going to be repaid.
00:12:39.754 - 00:12:47.058, Speaker A: Wow, okay, I didn't realize that. I thought those two trades were big contributors, but if they just borrowed money and then bet on black, that's pretty mean.
00:12:47.144 - 00:13:40.002, Speaker C: Part of it is like GBTC had the structural change, right where it went from being net positive to net negative. And I think a lot of people assumed it would revert but actually in the last year we basically saw outflows net outflows of GBTC as each Bitcoin ETF application failed. And I think basically three arrows had made moved by that time to mainly L One speculation. But the problem is when the L One trade died and Luna basically killed all L1s, salana may be the only one that has any net inflows over the last six months and basically every L One kind of from an institutional standpoint has died. And so they were just basically like hey, let's go do the trades we know already that are just Bitcoin and ETH. Staked ETH is a trade you can get a bunch of leverage on. Bitcoin is a trade you can get a bunch of leverage on.
00:13:40.002 - 00:14:10.314, Speaker C: The other thing that's a little bit weird is under collateralized and really uncollateralized in a lot of cases. I think 3 Hours didn't put up any collateral with some of these lenders because they're like the GBTC trade is viewed as safe and so you could basically borrow putting up no collateral. Which obviously means that you're assuming that the trade reverts at some point because they were very successful with it when it was a positive redemption price.
00:14:10.512 - 00:14:17.774, Speaker E: Yeah, I think it's easy to on three rows, but this was a very, very popular trailer. Even like BlockFi was doing this right.
00:14:17.812 - 00:14:19.754, Speaker C: To like unsuccessful Bitcoin.
00:14:19.802 - 00:14:38.918, Speaker E: Yeah, right. And so it's like a lot of these consumer lending desks were also doing kind of Djen shit with consumer funds to get the yield that they were getting. And it's like this really dangerous arms race of like who can post the highest yield but not like who is posting the safest yield and that's kind of what we're seeing.
00:14:39.004 - 00:15:30.242, Speaker A: Well, interestingly, it's a great reflection of a credit cycle. Basically a credit cycle is when over the course of a financial cycle, credit gets easier and easier and people are comfortable taking on more and more risk because they have to in order to stay competitive. So all these crypto banks that were basically offering yield on deposited assets, all these banks were implicitly competing with each other. Right? So versus Celsius versus BlockFi, versus whatever all these earn type products, initially they were probably doing stuff that was relatively safe because you don't have to offer a lot of yield in order to attract a marginal deposit. Celsius, which is one of the biggest crypto banks, blew up and we were actually able to track a lot of Celsius's activities on chain. We know they got blown out in the Staked ETH trade, but also a bunch of other stuff that they end up losing a bunch of money on. Supposedly they also lost money in anchor.
00:15:30.242 - 00:16:09.922, Speaker A: So Celsius is now going through a bankruptcy. So it is very, very likely that Celsius is completely insolvent and that nobody's going to be able to save them. But the dynamic that contributed to this is that over the course of the cycle, right? So Celsius offers 8%. And let's say that this is a time of higher yields, right? Let's say that in that time it's actually pretty safe to get 8% during DFI summer, right? But yields start to go down and they say, okay, we should really lower your yield because safe yields have really gone down a lot. But somebody else is like, you know what, actually I'm going to offer 9%. It's like, wait, how are you offering 9%? And the answer is that, well, they're moving further down the risk curve. They're doing something a little bit crazier and they're like, man, if we don't increase our rates, we're going to lose all of our deposits to this other guy.
00:16:09.922 - 00:17:03.566, Speaker A: And so to Tom's point, you get this arms race, and this arms race in almost every secular market ends up in credit getting easier and easier and easier until it breaks. And then when it breaks, a bunch of people lose money simultaneously. And that's effectively what we've seen happen, is that even the lenders so Celsius is called we call Celsius a lender, kind of as a euphemism, right? It's not actually a lender. It's really more like a hedge fund where you give deposits to Celsius and then Celsius goes and does crazy shit on chain with it, right? That's a hedge fund, that's not a lender. Now, that being said, BlockFi is a real lender. BlockFi doesn't go do principal stuff on chain, but the people BlockFi is lending to are people who are going and doing crazy shit on chain, right? So in some sense, it doesn't really matter how many layers removed you are, the credit cycle forces you to take on more risk over time until that risk blows up on you. Small addendum.
00:17:03.598 - 00:17:18.098, Speaker D: BlockFi also did principal things from their balance sheet, including the GBTC trade, which they have disclosed. So they also did some hedge fund stuff themselves, but using their own balance sheet capital, which is investor capital.
00:17:18.274 - 00:17:42.910, Speaker B: Okay? So that's the difference. I'm looking at an article from January of 2021, okay? These numbers are insane. So three AC had just increased their position on GBTC to they now had 6.1%, which was 36,000 bitcoin, but Blockfly owned 5.7% not that far behind. So did Blockfly exit the position earlier?
00:17:44.050 - 00:18:51.202, Speaker C: Blockfly apparently didn't chase when it went negative, they basically were mainly doing the GBTC trade while the spread was positive, but when it was negative, they effectively stopped and then they raised. So like their fundraising timing with the like there's a lot of correlation between fundraising events for these centralized lending companies and basically when GBTC stopped being profitable. So GBTC, for the record, in the bear market was the main way. A lot of trading firms and sort of centralized entities who took some risk stayed alive because it was almost the only risk free ish, okay? There's no such thing as a risk free rate in crypto opportunity cost rate. It was the only opportunity cost rate that was like relatively low risk at that time, partially because DCG was doing everything possible to get it adopted. And it was also the only way for a lot of institutions to buy Bitcoin that had all sorts of restrictions on KYC, Sock, Two, whatever, all these types of things. Whereas right now it's like even endowments.
00:18:51.202 - 00:19:11.146, Speaker C: Just go to Anchorage or Coinbase or probably FTX soon and just go buy Direct so they don't need to buy GBTC. That's also a structural problem for GBTC is that all the crypto exchanges just met all the compliance needs over time. It just took a while, but once they did, there's like no reason to buy it per se.
00:19:11.328 - 00:19:22.542, Speaker B: Do you know when the shift happened from like because it was trading in a premium, right? And that's part of where the yield came from and then it shifted. Was that recently or was that like in 2021?
00:19:22.676 - 00:19:23.662, Speaker D: It was like a year ago.
00:19:23.716 - 00:19:24.734, Speaker A: It was like a year ago. Yeah.
00:19:24.772 - 00:19:24.926, Speaker B: Okay.
00:19:24.948 - 00:19:25.794, Speaker A: It was a little while ago.
00:19:25.832 - 00:19:31.010, Speaker C: Now that this just look at whenever BlockFi's fundraise was. I remember it was like a week after it crossed Euro.
00:19:33.990 - 00:20:11.566, Speaker A: Okay, so the aftermath of all of this, right? So Three Arrows goes negative about something like 2 billion of losses that has to get absorbed by their counterparties. Now their counterparties freak out. They need to get recapitalized. Otherwise if they don't get recapitalized, retail is going to lose massive amounts of money and confidence in crypto is going to get really, really hurt. So over the weekend before last, there was basically what seemed like just max fear. We were seeing a lot of these liquidations taking place in real time. Markets were melting down and there was a sense that nobody knows where the bottom is, nobody knows how much foreseling is really left in the market and how many people are dying in front of us.
00:20:11.566 - 00:20:59.226, Speaker A: Because they basically assumed that crypto bitcoin was never going to go below twenty k and it started tumbling to 17,000 over the weekend. Enter Sam Bankman freed. So SPF, the founder and CEO of FTX, basically stepped in Sunday before last and said, hey, we are going to backstop the market. And by that, what he means is that all of these lenders that have absorbed massive losses on the balance sheet, he is going to step in and try to make sure that they do not have to default on customer deposits. Okay? So it's worth illustrating exactly what is going on here. So in the event of a bankruptcy, almost always your secured creditors are senior to your unsecured creditors. What that means is that if you go bankrupt, first you have to pay back all the secured creditors.
00:20:59.226 - 00:21:23.906, Speaker A: Those are the actual lenders, right? So if Blockfly borrowed money from somebody else, they have to pay that person back before retail gets anything. You have to pay back everybody. If your hole is really big, then there is nothing to pay back retail with. Potentially you could pay back your lenders eighty cents on the dollar and retail gets zero. That's really bad. That means retail would get totally destroyed depending on the size of the hole. So Sam bankman, Free, basically stepped in and said, hey, this is unacceptable.
00:21:23.906 - 00:21:59.746, Speaker A: We cannot allow retail to lose all of their money in these crypto banks. So he essentially offered credit lines to BlockFi and Voyager and said, hey, if you draw down this credit line, this credit line will actually be junior to customer deposits. Meaning that in a bankruptcy, customers get paid first before we get paid back for our loan. And you need to use this to keep your operations running. And if you keep your operations running, we may decide to buy you. But if we buy you, it will essentially be for pennies on the dollar. Because your negative equity is so big, you have lost so much money that the enterprise value of your business might not even be worth the cost to save you.
00:21:59.746 - 00:22:36.254, Speaker A: So we are basically saving you effectively as a public service and we'll decide at a later date whether we want to do it and take on your liabilities and renegotiate with your creditors the liabilities that you currently owe them. So this is actually very analogous to what happened in 2008. So in 2008, you might remember the banks lost tons of money because of mortgage backed securities that ended up going becoming really bad loans. The banks lost tons of money and what they did was before they went to the Fed, they all went to Warren Buffett and they called him up. He was in his bathtub and they called up Warren and said, hey Warren, everyone trusts you. They don't trust us. Everyone's scared of the banks, but they trust you.
00:22:36.254 - 00:22:58.354, Speaker A: Will you backstop us to save the world? And Warren Buffett said no, it doesn't sound like a good deal. And so the banks went under and they ultimately ended up calling the Fed. Well, in crypto we don't have a Fed. We've got Sam. Sam is our fed. And Sam has basically said, yes, I am willing to backstop. He has managed to rally a bunch of other parties to come in and also try to bail out some of these companies.
00:22:58.354 - 00:23:27.040, Speaker A: And so for now, it seems to be that's what's booing the market and giving people a perception that credit markets will ultimately be okay. We're not going to have a total cris of confidence within the lenders and the crypto banks if we manage to save these companies. I think it'll be very, very good from a regulatory perspective. But if these companies go down, it's going to be really ugly for crypto regulation, especially in the US going forward. So curious what your guys'thoughts are about SBF stepping in and trying to backstop everybody.
00:23:27.970 - 00:24:22.030, Speaker D: I will use this opportunity as the DeFi founder to say that DeFi protocols don't have to get bailed out and were designed specifically to avoid this bullshit. Okay? And the reason why Celsius and Voyager and BlockFi are all in this pickle is because they're opaque. They're run based on the whims of people who are not very good managers, and they do not leverage any of the inherent new technological advantages of crypto itself to run their businesses. They're running their businesses the same exact way that Wall Street was running itself in 2007. And D Five protocols are the antidote to exactly this problem. And it's incredibly sad to see people.
00:24:22.100 - 00:24:26.674, Speaker A: Repeat the exact same mistakes when the.
00:24:26.712 - 00:25:15.886, Speaker D: Tools to avoid them are right there in front of their faces. And hopefully as an industry we all learn from this experience and everybody else can say in the future like AHA, this is why we should actually have DeFi protocols and not a business with a spreadsheet doing whatever it wants and making loans to whoever it feels like without any collateral and just praying that it all works before the house of cards collapses. This is why we actually like DeFi protocols that are transparent and autonomous and are not based on the whims of an incompetent manager. They just run themselves based on some open source code, and you can see exactly how it works, and it does what it says it's going to do. Unlike BlockFi, Celsius, Voyager, all these people that aren't doing what they said they're.
00:25:15.918 - 00:25:19.166, Speaker A: Going to do, lots of mistakes.
00:25:19.198 - 00:25:42.230, Speaker D: Intentional and unintentional. There a lot of unforced errors. Hopefully, this is the catalyst and the inflection point where people finally get it, or at least some people get it, or regulators get it or power users get it. But this is the moment that everyone should wake up and see that all of that nonsense can be avoid with DeFi.
00:25:42.990 - 00:26:07.842, Speaker B: Yeah. I don't know. How many times are we going to learn this lesson, right? Because we've mentioned the 2008 financial crisis. Let's go further back and say the whole reason that we have a Fed, right? Like 19 seven. Right? I was pretty good. That's right. Exact same thing.
00:26:07.842 - 00:27:11.682, Speaker B: Right? But Mount Gox was, like, also not that long ago where we all collectively realized how screwed we were if we put all of the crypto money in one single place. And we also saw that had contagion aspects, too, because it turns out that a lot of the smaller exchanges were actually storing all of their customer assets on Mount Gox. So when Mount Gox went down, there was this trickle for months of like, oh, yeah, even though you weren't on Mount Gox, you didn't realize that you were on Mount Gox because so and so had their funds there. So I don't like, I feel like Mount Gox was not that long ago. I get that the ecosystem has grown a lot, but we need to get better at sort. Of learning the lessons and internalizing them and then projecting them in the years to come so that newcomers entering the space don't forget these lessons. And specifically, I think that the bitcoin community tries to do this, has tried to do this right around Mount Gox, like not your keys, not your coins, like all of these sayings that are very much associated with the bitcoin crowd.
00:27:11.682 - 00:27:16.946, Speaker B: The problem is they kind of went down angry, annoying path.
00:27:16.978 - 00:27:27.114, Speaker C: Yeah, I was also about to say, let me tell you how many Bitcoin maximalists, self described bitcoin maximalists would just have blockfly logos on their podcasts because.
00:27:27.152 - 00:27:28.634, Speaker D: They got paid to.
00:27:28.832 - 00:28:09.602, Speaker C: Yeah, I would argue that like 90% of them were shilling all of these centralized lenders like Hodlanot or whatever, which just blew up today. The Canadian public company that's in Singapore that turned out to have a ton of sort of extreme uncloudorized lending exposure. That was being if I remember correctly, I remember there was a time where liquid, which is block streams, weird sort of semi centralized because it's effectively a multi SIG bridge type of thing, was showing how you should put your liquid BTC deposits in total or not. So I don't know. I would say that everyone has some blood on their hands, if we're going to be very honest, 100%.
00:28:09.676 - 00:28:53.266, Speaker B: And I think that one of the things that really got under my skin sort of during DFI summer and the period directly after. It was the sheer number of hardcore bitcoiners who would go on Twitter and chill narratives. And then throw a blockfly or a celsius ad, or even make arguments as to why these centralized providers were better than the DeFi stuff on this shitty chain called right. And like, I think that that is not the way to do it. I think you have to both you can't just shill the lessons, right? You have to internalize it and also externalize it, right, so that it comes from a place of authenticity, not of just trying to shill your narrative.
00:28:53.458 - 00:29:24.318, Speaker C: Do you think that the old school kind of bitcoin celebrities who were just shilling kind of a lot of the centralized lenders for the last five years, do you think they face any repercussions from this blow up? Because I'm sure a lot of people who, a significant portion of people who are trying to withdraw their money from these places right now may have put it in because they saw it on this podcast or this type of thing. I wouldn't be surprised if that's like the biggest marketing channel for some of these lenders.
00:29:24.494 - 00:30:16.638, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that for me, the thing that I'm watching right now and kind of very curious about is how did these players get so legitimate so fast? And then that legitimacy literally turned into money in some cases, like three AC. It seems like they were borrowing money sort of based partially or fully on their reputation, right? This impression that they're like the top dogs, the best people. Like, they're going to get you all the returns they cannot lose. Right? That's the only reason that someone like Voyager would give them hundreds of millions of dollars, apparently completely unsecured those types of things in order to get to that place. As far as I know. I don't know when three AC came on your guys'radar, but for me, they came on my radar in the last year. Same with Doe Kwan, right, was, like, September of last year when he came on my radar.
00:30:16.638 - 00:30:42.578, Speaker B: The amount of growth that we saw, not just in terms of the financial and the numbers, but legitimacy, and then it's like this positive feedback loop, right? Like, you get much, number go up, you get more money, you get more legitimacy, number go up, right? And then it all comes crashing down. If we can sort of, I don't know, stop that loop somehow, right, because it's a bad loop to get in, then we have a chance of I'm.
00:30:42.594 - 00:31:52.158, Speaker A: Kind of inclined to push back on the moralizing around failures like this, right? Because there's always wrong instinct to be like, I told you so. Why did you put BlockFi? Why did you talk about I mean, one, the people who were doing this, they had no fucking clue what was going on behind the scenes, right? So I don't think it's fair to say, like, well, those of you who had a Coinbase logo, you guys are okay because Coinbase is fine, but those who had celsius, you were evil because celsius blew up. It's not really fair to place that on people who are just trying to run a media business, right? Like, how else are you supposed to run a media business in crypto? But also, I don't think we should take the story from this in some sense. I think it's never a good solution to a systemic problem to point at individuals. Right? If you point at individuals and you say this person was wrong, this person was evil, this person was a bad manager, it's like these people were following their incentives. They were trying to do the right thing in the situation that they were in and their investors. I mean, look, we'll see what happens in the coming months when we learn, was there actual malfeasance? But the answer might have been like, look, yeah, if you lend to the biggest guy who has $10 billion balance sheet and they lie to you about it, what are you going to do? Yes, that's a place where you're going to lose money if someone lies to you.
00:31:52.158 - 00:32:21.046, Speaker A: Right? This happened in TradFi very recently with Arcagos, the big family office guy who basically just got indicted by the SEC. So it can happen anywhere. The question in my mind is more like, okay, where do we go from here? And how do we make sure that these lessons are collectively burned into our brains. And in DFI, it already happened. It happened in March of 2020. Like all of the DFI protocols that were around since then, they know to expect this. They're not like, oh my God, I can't believe prices went down 30% in a day.
00:32:21.046 - 00:32:49.966, Speaker A: How could that happen? They're like, oh yeah, I remember when they went down 50% in a day and we had to survive that, right? And so that resilience. Like most of these centralized lenders have not gone through that because their books were so small at that time that they basically came of age in this cycle. And that's how credit cycles work, right? If you survive a credit cycle, it's burned into your brain. You will never forget. It doesn't matter. You don't need regulation, you don't need people toting you on Twitter. You will never forget how much money you lost and how terrible that was when you didn't take on that risk.
00:32:49.966 - 00:33:10.220, Speaker A: And that's how you get great risk managers. Great risk managers come from losing lots of money. And so I kind of think the task as an industry is to make sure we all learn from this. But I don't think we're going to get there by digging the knife in further. These guys are already dead. They are going to have a very unpleasant next couple of years.
00:33:10.830 - 00:33:30.334, Speaker C: I would push back on the media outlet piece, though, because I actually do think the people who are broadcasting these things of like, hey, not your keys, not your coins, but blockfly is actually totally safe. Like earn 5% of your bitcoin. Those people deserve to be pilloried. Those people deserve to be pilloried in whatever sense you want.
00:33:30.532 - 00:33:32.270, Speaker D: If only a hypocrite.
00:33:32.770 - 00:33:36.322, Speaker A: Sure, yes. Hypocrisy is always a pleasure to call.
00:33:36.376 - 00:34:17.950, Speaker C: Another thing that of this whole story that I still am not personally, I don't understand enough is like there were also a ton of Chinese unsecured crypto lenders, some of whom who we know had issues, some of whom didn't. And I have not heard anyone actually give me the whole like, why is it only these, the US ones that seem to have had the public rug pull FTX had to whitenight them shaming? Where is the equivalent for Babel? Where's the equivalent for because some of the crazy minor derivatives that are being sold in Asia I think probably also blew up, but we just haven't heard they're just in the why.
00:34:18.100 - 00:34:45.750, Speaker A: Yeah, I think the reason why is that they're not retail facing. So most of the big lenders in Asia are institution facing or like high net worth facing. So if they go under, then their counterparties who are big whales in Asia lose money. But it's like, okay, they're big boys, they can take it's. Really? If you lose retail money, that's when the regulators come out, that's when the guns come out, that's when the industry gets marred. Know, for folks like Babel and CoinFLEX, most of their counterparties are institutional.
00:34:46.090 - 00:34:48.306, Speaker C: Roger Vera counts as institutional.
00:34:48.418 - 00:34:49.640, Speaker E: He's high net worth.
00:34:50.090 - 00:34:51.866, Speaker A: He's high net worth. He's definitely high net worth.
00:34:51.968 - 00:34:54.230, Speaker E: I have enjoyed the weird types of collateral.
00:34:54.390 - 00:34:57.130, Speaker A: Is he high net worth anymore? Is he still high net worth?
00:34:57.280 - 00:35:30.674, Speaker E: Yeah. I don't know. But yeah, you hear these stories about people posting random safes and chunks of equity as collateral and pledging those and it's not really what you sort of imagine when you're thinking about crypto lending. But I guess people do it. I do want to, again, reemphasize that. It's amazing to me how fine DFI is. I feel like they did go through this almost a hero's journey of March 2020, developing more robust systems, and now they're more robust this time around.
00:35:30.674 - 00:36:04.638, Speaker E: And really it's like a lot of the blue chips from that time are still the ones that are around, are still the ones that are like making and not all the crazy Dgen shit that blew up in the past year. And I think it's not totally without a fault or issue. There's obviously what happened with Soland, and I think Maple made a loan to Babel, and so they might have a hole in their balance sheet, but all this stuff is transparent and audible and we knew all this was happening and we can sort of design systems to remedy it. It's not like, oh, this thing might be insolvent. We have no idea where the liabilities are. We can sort of see in real time exactly what's happening and know how to adjust for it.
00:36:04.804 - 00:36:49.450, Speaker A: That's a great point, because Maple Finance, which is an on chain lending protocol, they kind of have a BlockFi like business model. But the gigantic yawning gap of difference between BlockFi and Maple Finance is that with Maple Finance, you can see the loan book. Like, yes, as a depositor, you get to actually see what the loan book looks like. If you want to deposit money in BlockFi, of course you can't see no, you have no idea what the loan book is. You have no idea what your exposure is. You just see the APY numbers, you see some marketing and maybe folks like us who can call up some of the higher ups at BlockFi, they might tell us what the loan book is, but they're not going to tell a random retail depositor. And so that democratization of information is such a huge difference between what DeFi offers and what CFI offers.
00:36:49.450 - 00:37:10.360, Speaker A: And I think that the story that I've gotten. I mean, I've talked to a bunch of journalists who keep asking about this, and very often they're like, oh, isn't this like an indictment of like no, no, it's an indictment of centralized finance. Right. That's what CFI stands. Centralized finance. Centralized finance absolutely messed up. But DFI, the pure play crypto stuff all worked beautifully and that's how it was supposed to work.
00:37:11.370 - 00:38:09.314, Speaker B: I also want to point out that if it turns out that three AC was basically a huge fraud, right? Regulation would not have caught it, right? Like if they were lying, if they were falsifying stuff, if they were doing that right, as we saw with Arcagos, it's almost exactly the same. Regulation would not have prevented that. So I think that's a really important thing that we talk about, right? It's not just that DeFi does all these great things that hopefully solve some of the systemic issues, but also that we might somehow be in a position where we're the best ones to regulate, to actually regulate ourselves and have the best outcomes. Somehow didn't see that coming, but somehow that's the case, right, where the SEC and every other one of those three letter agencies has failed in every totally.
00:38:09.362 - 00:38:38.590, Speaker A: Totally. And I think in a know, Sam right now is getting a lot of shit on Twitter because people are like, oh my God, Sam, you're like taking over the world. This is so bad. You're like an evil mastermind. Effectively, what Sam is doing is a kind of self regulation for the industry. He's basically saying, like, look, we are going to step in and we're also going to set the rules about what happens in this situation. And the rules he's setting, my understanding is that the credit line that they offered to Voyager, the credit line is contingent on them continuing to process withdrawals.
00:38:38.590 - 00:39:16.666, Speaker A: And if they don't process withdrawals, if they shut off retail, then the credit line shuts off, which basically says you have to keep the lights on, you have to keep the business running, you have to keep honoring retail withdrawals. If you don't, the money's gone. You're not getting this money. Also, the fact that he's subordinating the loans to customer deposits basically says very clearly, like, look, if we're going to be the lender of last resort, we're going to set the rules. And the rules are customers come first, period. Customers, retail comes first. I think that if we pull this off, or if Sam really pulls this off and the coalition that forms around him, I think the industry is going to end up looking much better off than we would otherwise.
00:39:16.666 - 00:39:23.682, Speaker A: I think in the alternative it looks really, really bad and we're in for a regulatory nightmare over the next six to twelve months.
00:39:23.816 - 00:39:39.634, Speaker D: And just to point out for the last time the difference between CFI and DeFi, a DeFi protocol like Compound or MakerDAO, there is no ability to halt withdrawals. This isn't even a conversation point. Compound cannot block withdrawals.
00:39:39.682 - 00:39:40.034, Speaker A: Period.
00:39:40.082 - 00:39:57.420, Speaker D: Full stop. Right? This is one more difference between what users should expect from CFI, which is the rules change whenever someone feels like it, or the rules change based on a backroom deal that gets made versus code doing what it's supposed to do.
00:39:58.350 - 00:40:00.490, Speaker B: Should we talk about very true governance?
00:40:00.830 - 00:40:01.658, Speaker A: Can we do it? Yeah.
00:40:01.664 - 00:40:06.462, Speaker C: I was about to be like, you brought up Maker and now we have the holy hell.
00:40:06.596 - 00:40:09.386, Speaker D: All right, who is the TLDR 30,000 foot summary?
00:40:09.498 - 00:40:21.460, Speaker B: Someone's going to have to do a better description of Maker than what I got this morning because I am so lost. But I was also thinking about like, the banker stuff, the solan stuff, right? Like, these are pretty interesting.
00:40:22.870 - 00:40:31.750, Speaker A: Should we delve into it? I feel like we just spent a lot of time building up how great DeFi is and turn around and done it. We can do that. I'm down.
00:40:31.820 - 00:40:35.634, Speaker C: The dialectic is a more honest form of discourse.
00:40:35.762 - 00:40:38.790, Speaker D: We should talk about Maker dow we should talk about Soul Land.
00:40:38.940 - 00:40:42.554, Speaker A: Okay, I'm behind the loop on Makerdow. I was trying to catch up yesterday morning.
00:40:42.672 - 00:41:10.658, Speaker C: Makers reminds me of the statement that I remember that Matt Levine used to have in 2015 or 16 about Bridgewater, which is like it's like a company where the machines go make all the money and then the people have to distract themselves with cult like rituals. And like, Maker has the same thing where the code is still working and people are using dai, but all the people who kind of care about it have to distract themselves with cult like rituals, which is the current Maker governance system.
00:41:10.744 - 00:41:14.306, Speaker A: So, Tarun, maybe you're best equipped to give the summary of what's going on.
00:41:14.488 - 00:42:06.378, Speaker C: I don't think I am anymore because I feel like every time I go to the post, the forum post, things keep changing. Honestly. Maybe we cover Maker next week because it actually is like a crazy situation. But I will say there's just a lot of debate about how Maker should distribute funds right now. There's this question of should Maker spend money on being more efficient versus should it keep to this credible neutrality aspect of having no one sort of manage its balance sheet. And then on the other hand, they are apparently going to also buy a lot of treasuries, but they're using some weird centralized third party to buy treasuries. Maker just has too much money and too many cooks in the kitchen and sort of this is why I was saying there's a lot of infighting and I don't totally understand all the politics involved.
00:42:06.378 - 00:42:12.930, Speaker C: There's clearly some stuff, but the point is the protocol just works and this thing is like a sideshow.
00:42:13.090 - 00:42:17.000, Speaker D: Next week we should have our guest be a Makerdow community.
00:42:18.010 - 00:42:20.198, Speaker C: Hasu or could have.
00:42:20.204 - 00:42:21.402, Speaker A: We could have Rune on as well.
00:42:21.456 - 00:42:23.660, Speaker D: Rune? Doesn't Rune work for you guys?
00:42:24.830 - 00:42:25.994, Speaker C: That's true.
00:42:26.192 - 00:42:28.278, Speaker D: Isn't Roon a venture partner at Dragonfly?
00:42:28.374 - 00:42:30.214, Speaker A: He is. He is a venture partner at Dragonfly.
00:42:30.262 - 00:42:33.178, Speaker D: Well, you can get your own venture partner to come on the show next week.
00:42:33.264 - 00:42:38.810, Speaker C: Yeah, I think someone who's actually well, steeped in the cult like rituals.
00:42:38.890 - 00:42:52.420, Speaker A: Oh, we should get Rune plus Hasu and get him duke it out. That would be very we could host like a presidential be. That would be pretty sick. Get them like little podiums that they could stand on.
00:42:52.950 - 00:43:02.342, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. Let's make them presidents while they learn how to run or an organization or not run or talk about nobody runs it.
00:43:02.396 - 00:43:06.870, Speaker A: Yeah, that's DeFi, right? Nobody runs organizations. To Robert's point, Makerdow is the least.
00:43:06.940 - 00:43:08.550, Speaker D: Run organization in the world.
00:43:08.700 - 00:43:21.110, Speaker A: We don't have a good enough explain. I think a lot of people are lost as we're kind of vaguely insinuating something's going wrong in MakerDAO, to be clear. Makerdow is fine. Please, nobody go run, start pulling deposits from Dire because you think that it's in trouble. There's just some drama in the governance.
00:43:21.190 - 00:43:27.786, Speaker C: It's just the MakerDAO has a lot of money to spend and they're very confused as to what the point of which is normal.
00:43:27.818 - 00:43:32.750, Speaker A: Which to be clear, is normal. Right. That's what governance supposed to look like when you have big decisions to make. Right.
00:43:32.820 - 00:43:50.486, Speaker B: And that's by the way, those conversations happen in all sorts of organizations all the time. It's just that now you have more people that are actually empowered to participate in the governance decisions and it's going to be messy. Right. Instead of happening behind closed doors, it's now going to happen on exactly.
00:43:50.588 - 00:43:53.266, Speaker A: I actually think it's great. I don't understand why people are so upset.
00:43:53.298 - 00:44:09.500, Speaker C: Well, there is some closed door thing here which has to do with the older MakerDAO, maker foundation members versus the new ones. And that's where I don't understand what's actually going on. There is a freemason cloak somewhere hidden here.
00:44:11.470 - 00:44:20.720, Speaker A: Even countries, right, that have diplomats. You have to allow the diplomats to go behind closed doors and come out and read how to communique, and then the people back home decide whether they like that or not.
00:44:21.650 - 00:44:25.374, Speaker C: I'm just saying I don't understand it. I get this feeling that there is.
00:44:25.412 - 00:44:42.502, Speaker A: That no, I get it, I get it. It's very opaque. It's very opaque. Okay, let's talk real quick about Soland because I want to get at least one good shot in against DeFi kind of shitting the bed a little bit. So, Tom, do you want to give the Soland summary? So I should caveat that we are investors into Soland? Yes.
00:44:42.556 - 00:45:22.366, Speaker E: That was a good call out. Yeah. So, Solend, they are the largest lending money market on Solana. They encountered an issue recently, again, talking about managing a loan book and thinking about concentration risks. Specifically, they ended up in a point where they had a massive whale on Soland who was borrowing 20% of all USDC on Soland. Basically, this whale had put down a bunch of Sol, borrowed a bunch of USDC and they were getting to the point of liquidation because Sol had been drying down so much. And the concern is with these on chain money markets, liquidation happens on chain happens automatically.
00:45:22.366 - 00:46:18.434, Speaker E: Generally, you have liquidation bots who are atomically selling some of the collateral for another asset using like an on chain Dex and then reclateralizing the system in order to sort of secure a profit. The issue is that there just simply isn't enough on chain liquidity for sol, on salana to effectively liquidate this position. And the concern was that if this amount of sol would be liquidated, which would have been I think 150 mil or so, that basically sol end would incur this huge debt and they would have to figure out some sort of restructuring, maybe they'd go to zero or there'd be some sort of issue. Basically you'd not have enough assets in the system to pay back your creditors. And so the Team had been trying to figure out what do we do about this whale that is soaking up so much of the money market. They've been trying to, of course, everybody's pseudonymous, which is maybe one of the potshots against DeFi, which is you have this one address, you have no possible way to identify this person. They tried all these different ways to try to get in contact with them.
00:46:18.434 - 00:46:42.234, Speaker E: There was no real way. This position was sort of slowly winding down. And so the Team was trying to figure out ways to resolve this. And the solution that they initially came up with was basically to effectively raise the collateralization rate for this position and then when the collateral is supposed to be liquidated, allow the solen team to liquidate it OTC with the market maker. So there's more liquidity off chain by.
00:46:42.272 - 00:46:44.430, Speaker D: Taking over the account and transferring.
00:46:44.770 - 00:47:15.046, Speaker E: I was getting to that. That's the centralized component. That's why it's so bad. But yeah, they would be taking over the account and basically at their discretion, selling this soul to recolateralize the system. And so not so good. I think a lot of the feedback and a lot of the criticism was basically it was sort of like was it like a Friday night massacre where they just said, hey, we're going to do this thing, push through this governance update and then just sort of take it over. They sort of spun up this Dow, this vote thing.
00:47:15.046 - 00:48:04.680, Speaker E: They're like, wait, this isn't real governance. You can't do a governance vote in 6 hours. This is ridiculous. And so they basically unwound it and luckily ended up getting in contact with the whale in this span of 48 hours, who then started to wind down the position and spread it across some other money markets. But it is again sort of an issue with onchain governance where it's not often as decentralized as you would think. Oftentimes a team maybe still has a multi SIG or a small number of people hold a large number of the tokens and can therefore often unilaterally or amongst two or three parties basically forced through changes. And so I think when a system is sort of in this infancy, it is DeFi in a sense and that is transparent on chain permissionless to access, but maybe not DeFi in the sense that you actually have decentralized governance and it's immune from the perils of man.
00:48:05.450 - 00:48:45.938, Speaker D: I would say the root cause is not an issue with their governance, which by the way, is absolutely god awful. The root issue is that if you're afraid that the protocol is not going to work, that's the root cause. The root cause is they were afraid of their protocol being unable to handle liquidation. Earlier we talked about Black Thursday 2020 and every single DFI protocol on Ethereum going through the grinder and coming out stronger. Imagine if March 2020, every Ethereum protocol said, oh, shut it down, change the rules. We got to take over the users accounts because we don't want to see them get liquidated and we don't trust our own systems that we built.
00:48:46.104 - 00:49:32.974, Speaker C: I would say another thing is the difference between Soland and other Salana lending protocols is they were probably one of the only ones that didn't have borrow caps and kind of had a slower development angle to making sure things worked before they kind of increase the amount of net leverage in the system. So I do think everyone has to make some growth versus risk trade off when starting these things and they went on the full growth standpoint and their treasury didn't grow fast enough to account for that. So I would say there were some things they could have done earlier that would have maybe mitigated having such a large position over a protocol that did not have enough assets.
00:49:33.022 - 00:49:46.230, Speaker A: Otherwise, I'm surprised they even had the ability to requisition an account from governance. That's like a crazy thing to be able to change directly. It's just like they can just decide to take over an entire account with no notice.
00:49:46.970 - 00:50:05.902, Speaker E: Yeah, I have to check how they're actually going to do that. But, I mean, I think in practice, a lot of the development patterns that you see are like a proxy pattern, right, where it's like the implementation contract gets swapped out over time. And so it's like you could imagine a version of implementation contract that does allow some people or some things to do something.
00:50:05.956 - 00:50:11.680, Speaker A: And so it's like, yeah, I'm sure you can hack it together somehow. I'm just surprised that that's even realistically possible.
00:50:12.130 - 00:50:12.986, Speaker E: Yeah, agreed.
00:50:13.018 - 00:51:10.094, Speaker B: And it's super interesting because I think we do forget sometimes that the blockchain is not actually immutable at all in any way, shape or form. You have to convince the majority of people to be on board, right? Majority of participants. How you define who is a participant, whether it's coin based or influence based or whatever changes. I think there's going to be a lot of growing pains around this, but this goes all the way to the core level. If anyone got a majority of the ecosystem on board with any change at any layer, basically anything can be changed. I think that with the newer protocols and the ones where you can really get this rapid ascent of fear, that's where we're going to see these messy outcomes. Right? Everyone's scared and this big looming scary thing can really easily convince, very easily convince the majority of people that this is the best route.
00:51:10.094 - 00:51:35.820, Speaker B: And you're so short term focused, you're so focused on preventing this loss, preventing this thing, that you're scared of that you fail to take a step back and look at the long term consequences. Look at the precedents that are being set, right? This is the law. We're building the law right now, guys. This is the choices we make today is going to shape everything, right? And so, yeah, be mindful of that, please.
00:51:36.430 - 00:52:22.950, Speaker A: I mean, the flip side of that. Look, I can very much understand why in a moment of just absolute fear that weekend, nobody knew what was going to happen. Nobody knew where this stuff was going. Soul drew down from 230 something dollars to almost $20, right? An absolutely like a mind boggling wind down in one of the most robust platforms that we've seen over the last year. And I can imagine everything that you have built, everything that you've worked on, everything that you and your friends and your sacrifice and whatever, and you see it flashing before your eyes and you're just like, it's Friday night. Everyone else is off crying about Bitcoin or whatever, and our protocol is about to explode. And not just lose money and not go into debt, but also take down Solana.
00:52:22.950 - 00:52:38.062, Speaker A: Their fear at that time was that the competition over trying to snipe the onchain liquidations was going to overwhelm salana itself and take down the network, as has previously happened, beyond just crashing the price on chain by like 30, 40%.
00:52:38.196 - 00:53:10.418, Speaker C: The best thing was my dad, because they wrote a Bloomberg article about the solon thing. My dad messages me and it's like, Solana is going to steal people's assets. And so there's some detriment to naming your protocol, sharing a prefix with the layer one, because then everyone thinks the layer one is also oh, I thought that was really funny because I guess Bloomberg that weekend was actually writing a lot more articles than normal and they wrote this soland one, and it was actually really I thought that was pretty hilarious.
00:53:10.514 - 00:53:57.606, Speaker B: That's amazing, Tishacho. And what Haseeb said, though, you're 100% correct, it was scary. It is scary still, to be frank. And that fear is 100% legitimate. And we should expect that when situations happen, there's always some potential for the environment to change rapidly and for fear to strike the hearts of all the people that have power over your protocol. And so then the question is, like, how do you react in that moment? And if you're not prepared, if you've never thought about it, if you've never discussed it, if you don't have a plan in place, the answer is they're going to do whatever makes sense in that moment and not think about anything else. One of the most interesting things I think about Maker back in March 2020 was.
00:53:57.606 - 00:54:12.186, Speaker B: Like they had actually talked about this. They actually had a plan where if the vault, my words are going to be off, but if the vault gets screwy and under collateralized, then the maker, the MKR holders right. MKR is sold on the market.
00:54:12.288 - 00:54:12.554, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:54:12.592 - 00:54:17.566, Speaker E: There's system debt. There's a debt like but the most.
00:54:17.588 - 00:54:46.120, Speaker B: Impressive thing about that was not necessarily the exact technicals of it, but the fact that somebody had thought about this and planned it so that in the moment of fear they could kind of point to that post. Right. And that helps settle things. It also when your head is not in a clear place, it helps clarify things. Right. You can rely on your past self that was thinking about the long term consequences. The short term consequences in a more prudent and mindful space.
00:54:46.730 - 00:54:47.478, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:54:47.644 - 00:55:02.620, Speaker E: To also tying it back to the first part of the conversation. It's nice to have it codified in the smart contract that die holders are senior to MCare holders. Right. We don't have to have a one off negotiation and hope everyone's in a good mood. It's just like no, that is how the smart contract works.
00:55:03.090 - 00:55:04.110, Speaker A: That's a great point.
00:55:04.180 - 00:55:36.694, Speaker C: Yeah, I wrote this tweet. That the DFI 3.0 of whatever. This bear market. I'm making fun of DFI 2.0 with that moniker, but is going to be about encoding paripasu clauses, which is like a certain type of how debt settles in these protocols. Because I actually think that's the main thing that's missing is these kind of, like edge debt settlement maker has one form of it, but I'm not convinced that this next generation of protocols will have way more things like that.
00:55:36.694 - 00:55:46.170, Speaker C: So I definitely agree though, that maker probably the only ones who thought it through, which is why they have a system so great that they can spend all their time fighting.
00:55:47.310 - 00:56:36.374, Speaker A: Well, look, at the end of the day, one of the takeaways for me is that anytime that there's lots of things that go wrong, people immediately jump to figure out whose fault it is and who behaved honorably and who behaved dishonorably. And I think there are some people who did the wrong thing and there are some people who did dumb things and I think it's an important difference between the two. Soland did really dumb things. It seems like three arrows did really wrong things and I think it's really, really important that we divide, we make a really thick divider between those two and the people who did dumb things will learn. Like God, they learned. That is one of those lessons that you cannot pay enough money to learn. Soland is going to figure their shit out now because the entire world has taught them this lesson in a way that I'm sure is impossible to otherwise receive.
00:56:36.374 - 00:57:11.720, Speaker A: But the important thing is to make sure that people cannot do wrong. And that's one of the values of crypto and DeFi and smart contracts is that you don't need to trust people to do the right thing. You trust the code is going to work. To your point, Taylor, is that nothing about the blockchain makes applications immutable. You have to decide to make them immutable. You have to decide to write your contracts or write your code or write your applications in such a way that they cannot be changed without going through legitimate processes to change them. And that, I feel like, is going to be one of the biggest takeaways from all of this.
00:57:12.490 - 00:57:33.494, Speaker C: One actual positive I learned from the Solen case is this is the first time I'd ever run into Solana's Dao Tooling of any form. I gotta say, their UX is better than most ETH things. I was actually extremely impressed by the UX of the Solana Dow Tooling that's.
00:57:33.542 - 00:58:09.240, Speaker B: Been, I think, the top sort of cited reason for people getting on board with Solana, especially people that were like, Diehard and Etheads that now have sizable positions right. Is that they seemingly care about the UX and the end user and the usability of the system. I'm not 100% sold on that narrative yet, but I do think that there's something worthwhile there. I think that ethereum in general, I'm definitely guilty of. This is, like, a little bit, I don't know, focus on the principles over the UX details sometimes.
00:58:09.930 - 00:58:22.030, Speaker A: All right, well, we're running up on time, but it's been, I think, for everybody in Crypto a pretty harrowing couple of weeks. So, Tay, do you want to close this out, give us some last words for everyone to take home about how they should feel?
00:58:22.180 - 00:59:07.978, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think that, personally, I've been in a very weird headspace because I'm simultaneously saddened by all the loss that we're seeing and the impact that we're seeing it have on actual people and sort of these seemingly existential threats right, that are circling around and when's the next shoe going to drop? And that is coupled with this feeling of like, oh, my goodness, thank God for a bear market. And I feel, like, very guilty for feeling that way. But I've done this before. Like, I got into space in 2013, right before Mount Gox crashed. So I've watched this now and been through it. I will say it's not just about sort of, like, shaking out the weak hands.
00:59:07.978 - 01:00:06.814, Speaker B: That's not what it's about. It's about truly having a moment to catch our breath, to be reflective on what worked and what didn't work. To clean up some of the tech debt or the social debt or the governance debt that we have accrued over the last couple of years and to really think about what and why we're building the systems that we're building and if we're being successful at that, right? It's a chance for us to be honest without sort of like the world looking on and kind of cheering us on to fail. In six months to a year, we're going to be in a much safer environment, right, where conversations can start to happen in public without this looming fear that you're going to be in the New York Times tomorrow. And I think that's massively important. And I would encourage everyone who's building or thinking about building or participating in these systems to think really carefully about why we're building the things that we're building. And then be honest with yourself about if we're on the right path to get there, right.
01:00:06.814 - 01:00:09.200, Speaker B: Because that's the only way that we're going to course correct.
01:00:09.650 - 01:00:30.886, Speaker A: That is an awesome message. Taylor, it was an absolute pleasure having you. We look forward to following all your many hot takes against both the people doing wrong things and the people occasionally doing dumb things. So for those of you who don't follow Taylor, go follow her. She's I think Tavano on Twitter. She's absolutely amazing. We're very lucky to have her in this bear market alongside us.
01:00:31.068 - 01:00:33.190, Speaker B: I am here for the long term.
01:00:34.570 - 01:00:38.790, Speaker A: Thanks for joining us and thanks for tuning in, everybody. Awesome.
01:00:38.860 - 01:00:40.420, Speaker B: Bye. Have a good one.
