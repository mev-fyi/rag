00:00:00.250 - 00:00:25.170, Speaker A: I think there's basically been no agency that has offered really complete clarity about how crypto ought to be regulated. And it's not as though this is an impossible task. If you look around the world at other first world countries that have robust regulatory regimes, there's a lot of clarity in different places, which shows that it can be done. Not a dividend, it's a tale of two quan. Now your losses are on someone else's balance.
00:00:25.290 - 00:00:27.842, Speaker B: Generally speaking, airdrops are kind of pointless anyways.
00:00:27.986 - 00:00:30.738, Speaker A: Unnamed trading firms who are very involved.
00:00:30.834 - 00:00:32.950, Speaker B: Alec ETH is the ultimate on this.
00:00:33.020 - 00:00:50.666, Speaker A: DeFi protocols are the antidote to this problem. Hello, everybody. Welcome to the chopping block. Every couple of weeks we get together and give the industry insightish perspective on the crypto topics of the day. This week we're running a little bit short. I think it's actually because it's conference season, people are getting sick. You might be able to hear my voice is a little bit sickly right now.
00:00:50.666 - 00:01:08.606, Speaker A: So we've got a skeleton crew today, but we've got a very interesting guest that's going to keep things very lively. So quick intros. First we've got Tom, the DeFi maven and master of memes. Joining us. Special guests, we have Will Warren, lord of liquidity at Zero X Labs. And you've got myself, I'm a SIB, the head Hype man at Dragonfly. So we are early stage investors in crypto.
00:01:08.606 - 00:01:32.938, Speaker A: But I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice, legal advice or even life advice. Please see Choppingblock XYZ for more disclosures. So, Will, it's great to have you on the show. For those of you who don't know, Tom and Will actually have there's a lot of backstory here in the relationship between Macha, the Zero X settlement that we're going to be talking about today. And Tom tom, do you want to go into that a little bit, what the origin story is here?
00:01:33.024 - 00:02:03.730, Speaker B: I feel like that sounded somewhat nefarious or something like I don't know the whole backstory. I was an early employee at Zero X and I was a product lead there for two years, worked on two different versions of the protocol and worked on the aggregator product, which turned into zerox API and later Matcha. So Will and I have known each other for a while. We are actually just catching up about some of the Zero X mafia and the other Zero X employees who are now doing cool stuff in crypto. So I'm excited to have him on today.
00:02:03.880 - 00:02:16.886, Speaker A: So actually, Will, why don't you quickly explain what is Zero X for those people who are sort of coming in, who only really know NFTs or whatever it is, who are not from the 2017 era, explain to us what is Zero X?
00:02:16.988 - 00:02:59.186, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. So Zero X is a protocol for exchanging ERC 20 tokens in a peer to peer way. It was one of the kind of first systems designed on top of ethereum where there was kind of an off chain component and an on chain component. Zero X protocol specifically specifies an order format for swapping one, ERC 20 token for another, and all of the kind of parameters associated with that trade. And this order can then be ingested within a smart contract on the ethereum blockchain to settle a trade atomically between two parties.
00:02:59.378 - 00:03:06.950, Speaker A: Got it. And tell us as well about Matcha and how that fits into the suite of products under Zero X. Yeah, absolutely.
00:03:07.100 - 00:03:48.120, Speaker C: So a lot has changed over the years. So, yeah, we've been around for seven years at this point. My co founder Amir and I started working on Zero X back in late 2016. And in the early years, and this was a really exciting time, this is when Tom was leading product. We were really focused on building a protocol. So an open protocol that anyone can build on top of, anyone can create their own, ERC, 20 token marketplace on top of the protocol, build like a front end user experience on top of it. And over the years, we got closer and closer to end users and building the things that they need.
00:03:48.120 - 00:04:42.166, Speaker C: And we started shifting our focus from building this unapinionated piece of public infrastructure for swapping tokens to also building a hosted service on top of it called Zero X Swap API. And the Swap API is basically giving developers exactly what they wanted and needed. They wanted to focus on building their consumer product. They wanted a simple way to support swapping between different assets within that product. And they didn't want to have to deal with smart contracts and all the complexity that comes with it. So our Swap API is just a way to very easily kind of plug in an API that kind of looks and behaves similar to others they've worked with in the past, developers have worked with in the past. And it aggregates liquidity across 100 different decentralized exchanges, most of them probably familiar with.
00:04:42.166 - 00:05:07.354, Speaker C: And ultimately, as we kind of worked our way up the stack and got closer and closer to the end user, we started building Matcha, which is a consumer product and front end interface at Matcha XYZ. And this is essentially a front end that sits on top of our APIs. And you can think of it as like a search engine for tokens and liquidity.
00:05:07.482 - 00:05:51.218, Speaker A: So it's a Dex aggregator, I think, people who are familiar with One inch or I guess uniswap X, soon to be also a Dex aggregator of some kind. It's funny, actually, when I first got into crypto, when I first came into space full time in 2017, the first meetup I ever went to was an SF meetup. I think it was like off meetup.com, but it was like, literally I just Googled crypto meetups in San Francisco. It was a presentation by zero X. And I remember there was this know, I think it was you and there was a slide deck that was like, everything is going to be tokenized, and in the future there's going to be a billion tokens and a Laundromat is going to have a token, and this country is going to have a token. And I was like, wow, we're fucking going places.
00:05:51.218 - 00:06:33.126, Speaker A: This industry is amazing. And it was a very different time. Obviously there was a degree of bullishness that has waxed and waned over time with respect to the tokenization story. But I want to shift gears a little bit and talk about not just broadly about DeFi, but specifically about what happened over the last couple of weeks when the CFTC announced a string of settlements. So there were three settlements that were announced. One of them was with you guys with Zero X Labs, the other one was with Open, the Onchain Options Protocol. The third was with some kind of some protocol called Deridex, which I'm not familiar with.
00:06:33.126 - 00:07:08.600, Speaker A: And they were all very small settlements. So all in the range of like two hundred k to one hundred and fifty k, something along those lines. And as far as I understand, all three of them were for offering basically not being registered as an FCM or a futures clearing merchant, I think is what it is, and offering derivatives that should otherwise be under the supervision of the CFTC. What I'd love to get from you Will, is just give me the narrative know, you guys are out there building matcha, you've been doing this for years. How did the CFTC get in touch with you? What happened as you were going back and forth? Tell us the story of how all this took place.
00:07:09.050 - 00:07:48.142, Speaker C: Yeah, it isn't a very dramatic story. We essentially received an email from the CFTC and as you can imagine, that's always scary as an entrepreneur when you receive any sort of contact from one of these agencies. But essentially the CFTC Enforcement Division reached out to us and they had issued a Wells notice basically alleging that Zero X or Macho was violating the Commodity Exchange Act. And this is really the meat of it, by facilitating margin trading for retail traders.
00:07:48.286 - 00:08:01.958, Speaker A: And so to be clear, the specific claim they were making was that you guys allow the trading of this two X levered bitcoin and two X levered ETH asset, which was who is the issuer of this thing?
00:08:02.124 - 00:08:03.238, Speaker C: I'm not sure.
00:08:03.404 - 00:08:04.838, Speaker A: Okay, so there's just some token out.
00:08:04.844 - 00:08:05.846, Speaker C: There that I'm actually not sure.
00:08:05.868 - 00:08:29.502, Speaker A: There's some token that's two X levered bitcoin or two X levered ETH, some ERC 20. And this was tradable through Macha's front end, right? And it seemed like there were two tokens that were issued by the same issuer. And they tracked down these two tokens. They're like, AHA, these are derivatives and you are allowing the trading of derivatives, therefore you're in violation of the Commodity Exchange Act. And so, okay, so they contact you, they say, hey, you're in trouble. What happened next?
00:08:29.636 - 00:09:14.542, Speaker C: Yeah, so interestingly, they actually didn't identify any specific tokens when they first reached out. It was a somewhat ambiguous message we received from them. They said, hey, we think you're violating the CEA and we need to talk a Wells notice. Essentially we had kind of two weeks to put together a letter to kind of respond to their allegations. If we were able to kind of swatch their concerns, perhaps they wouldn't recommend moving forward with an enforcement action. But typically a Wells notice is putting you on notice that we're thinking about recommending an enforcement action against you. And we weren't exactly sure why.
00:09:14.542 - 00:09:41.030, Speaker C: At the know next step, we started to work with an external legal counsel, Wilkey. And they really facilitated all of the direct communication between the CFTC and ourselves. But yeah, there was quite a bit of back and forth. This process began in February of this year and it only resolved with kind of the public announcement earlier this month.
00:09:41.100 - 00:10:16.722, Speaker A: I see. So when they reached out to you, this was basically like FTX had just collapsed a couple months ago. All the fraud stuff was coming out. Kind of sounds like this lines up with when the enforcement from the White House really started getting aggressive both on the SEC side and it sounds like as well on the CFTC side. So they sent you vague letter not exactly saying what it is that they're mad at you about. Did you get a sense of how they decided that you guys were violating CEA? Was it sort of like, okay, give us everything you got and then we'll tell you what you're in violation of? Did it feel like they were sort of fishing for something to get you with?
00:10:16.856 - 00:11:25.830, Speaker C: So actually we just really weren't sure what it was about. We had no idea. And so when we engaged with Wilkie, kind of the first task was, okay, let's talk to them, let's find out what they're concerned about. And so Wilkie, they contacted the CFTC to kind of understand the nature of the request, kind of explain what we're building and what our business is focused on. It became clear at that point that there were a few things they were kind of interested in learning more about, but in particular the primary concern was access to leverage tokens in matcha. And so when we reached out to them, it did sound like we had perhaps gotten caught up in maybe another investigation that had been going on and they had some questions for us ultimately kind of resolved and didn't really lead anywhere. But the thing that they really did focus in on was this allowing of trading these leveraged tokens within retail kind of consumer product.
00:11:25.980 - 00:11:31.346, Speaker B: Part of the concern of investigation is also around serving US users.
00:11:31.378 - 00:11:31.526, Speaker A: Right.
00:11:31.548 - 00:12:04.802, Speaker B: And there was a lot of sort of back and forth in the announcement that came out around what is good enough for how do you know if you're serving US users? What is good enough when it comes to IP blocking or detecting IPS or detecting geo? How do you guys think about that given that it's like Zero X protocols on Ethereum and you have this UI, walk us through how you guys think about sort of the US bit to this. And specifically what were their concerns around serving US users based know this piece?
00:12:04.936 - 00:13:30.046, Speaker C: How do we address this issue of US based people accessing these things and people outside of the know being okay to access these things? Well, it is worth noting too that a majority of Matcha users aren't based inside the. So it is kind of a minority of our customers that this could potentially apply to. We didn't really have a clear answer around how to proceed once they reached out. And so naturally we engaged with them and kind of over the next couple of months, we cooperated with the CFTC, kind of explained how Macho works and all of kind of pieces of the technology stack. And around May, the CFTC kind of came back and offered a settlement and a $200,000 fine if we agreed to prevent violations of the CA in the future. So at this point, it's like, okay, how do we prevent violations of the CEA in the future? This isn't something that there's necessarily like an instruction manual for. What we did is we worked with our legal team and with Wilkie and we put together basically a proposal on how we could automate token screening and essentially screen out leverage tokens from being accessible to folks in the US.
00:13:30.046 - 00:14:13.242, Speaker C: And we shared it with the CFTC for feedback. They got back to us and they offered constructive criticism. We kind of adapted our process in response to it and ultimately we arrived at a policy or a procedure that we felt comfortable moving forward with. And we obviously didn't get any sort of kind of official blessing from the CFTC. They couldn't say, now that you have put this procedure in place and you're preventing us folks from accessing leverage tokens, we're never going to bother you again. Definitely not that. But it was overall like a very constructive conversation and we arrived at a solution that we felt, I think satisfied both parties.
00:14:13.386 - 00:14:35.140, Speaker B: When you were doing this outreach to the CFTC and sort of putting this explainer of how matcha zero X API zero X work, did you get the sense there was a sophisticated understanding from them ahead of time? Or were you doing education as part of this and maybe clearing up misunderstandings or clarifying things that they did or did not understand?
00:14:35.930 - 00:15:58.782, Speaker C: Yeah, over time, as we continued engaging with them and really dug deep into our products and the technology, their understanding went from probably not very deep to they definitely understand exactly the kind of constraints that we're running up know for Matcha, I guess kind of the big constraint here. Matcha really is kind of like a block explorer. So in the same way that a search engine like Google kind of crawls and indexes all the different websites that exist out there on the Internet and make it really easy for you to find them, but they don't necessarily know the content of every single website from the get go, it's kind of a similar process. So Matcha is like a search engine for tokens and liquidity. So every single ERC, 20 token that exists on the different networks we support, we have scraped and indexed that token and you can search for it through Macho. Do we know what every single one of these 4 million plus tokens represents? We don't. And so coming up with a way to screen for leverage tokens and to make sure that they're not available for us folks, that was something that we had to work through at the end of the process.
00:15:58.782 - 00:16:09.966, Speaker C: We felt like they had a very good understanding of kind of the practical constraints and how Macho works. And overall, it felt like it was a pretty constructive conversation.
00:16:10.158 - 00:17:24.646, Speaker A: So if you zoom out a bit I think the way a lot of people took the announcement of these settlements was, you know, we were all very excited about getting the CFTC as a regulator instead of the SEC, but turns out the CFTC is just as bad and everything sucks and it's all going to hell, and blah, blah, blah. And to be honest, what I'm hearing from you is that actually the CFTC sounded reasonable to a first approximation in that one. They didn't go after you for having Zero X Protocol interact with leveraged tokens, right? Obviously, Zero X Protocol itself is permissionless and lives on chain and there's no front end that's being maintained that's making decisions about which tokens to list. And so they were sophisticated enough to make the distinction between Matcha, which is a sort of managed service that has backend servers that does stuff as opposed to Zerox Protocol itself. It's a little bit of a ticky TAC foul to be like, oh, hey, you had these two tokens that didn't do much volume and that nobody really cared about, but they were accessible through the front end, and therefore you're in violation of CEA. And obviously the settlement is pretty de minimis. And so it does look like they were looking to make a statement, and they made the statement effectively, but it sounds like they were sophisticated enough to understand, first of all, how it all worked, how it all plugged.
00:17:24.646 - 00:18:02.214, Speaker A: Together. And second, to be able to relatively constrain the enforcement action to a part that allowed you guys to continue running Macha and also let Xerox Protocol itself basically continue on unperturbed. In your interactions with the CFTC, did they feel constructive? Because it sounds like they were giving you guys feedback on a proposal to avoid future CA violations. It sounds also like they were open to hearing why this wasn't as big of a deal as it might have otherwise been. The settlement itself, they didn't tell you, hey, shut down. You guys obviously don't deserve to exist. It doesn't sound that bad.
00:18:02.214 - 00:18:08.360, Speaker A: And I think the way a lot of this was being heard by crypto Twitter was like, oh my God, the CFTC is after us. As.
00:18:10.250 - 00:18:58.498, Speaker C: Know when when they initially kind of reached out to us, they did issue a Wells notice, and that is like a fairly aggressive stance, but I think we engaged with them in good faith from the outset. We wanted to explain some of the realities that we're facing by offering a product like Matcha. And it did feel like the conversations were positive and constructive. It didn't feel hostile. And I think a big part of that was that we went into the conversation looking to educate, looking to proactively address any of these issues that were really important for them. Being a good actor and trying to engage with them in good faith, I do think that made a big difference in terms of the tone.
00:18:58.594 - 00:19:24.658, Speaker A: Yeah, it feels mean. So here is the speculation part. So obviously, okay, you've laid out what happened kind of step by step. My speculation is that it must have been that basically like Jan Fab after FTX was collapsing and all this stuff was happening. I mean, this is just before the banking crisis. If I recall. There was probably a very broad mandate from the White House to say, go scalp some people.
00:19:24.658 - 00:20:10.414, Speaker A: Let's make a statement to show that we're being tough on crime. Crypto is Wild West and everybody, whether it's SEC, CFTC, FDIC, OCC, everybody just goes start knocking people around and taking bodies. And the CFTC sounds like this was their idea of like, okay, what can we do? Who exactly can we shake down? And ah, you were in violation of the like all these violations that they rounded up for this thing. They seems pretty small. The settlements are small. These are not exactly industry shaking outcomes of, okay, well, we have to delist these two levered tokens or whatever, but my guess would be that's where it came from, that's probably what the impetus was. But as time drug on it was about six months.
00:20:10.414 - 00:20:36.834, Speaker A: It sounds like end to end for this whole thing to get to a settlement, to get announced. It sounds like maybe the level of aggression probably moderated over that period of time where they were like, okay, well, look, here's what we got. We can jack them up on having a couple vials of derivatives on them, but other than that, there's really nothing that egregious here. That's my speculation. I don't know if you feel comfortable speculating on what you think was happening at CFTC.
00:20:36.962 - 00:21:03.474, Speaker C: Honestly, I don't know. Yeah, I really don't know. It could very well be that all of the chaos that ensued with FTX kind of decaying over time. But yeah, I really don't know. It's pretty hard to speculate how these kind of large regulatory bodies function internally. They're quite large. The CFTC has teams in different parts of the US.
00:21:03.474 - 00:21:17.794, Speaker C: We were specifically engaging with the New York enforcement. So, you know, it very well could have followed know, the FTX and Luna craziness, but yeah, I really don't know.
00:21:17.912 - 00:21:43.486, Speaker B: Did you at all consider fighting this and maybe taking it to court instead of settling? I know it was not these two tokens did basically no volume for Matcha, but it seems in some ways, on face value, ridiculous. Like you said, Matcha is a block explorer. You allow people to make transactions, but you yourselves are not custodying it, you're not swapping it. It is like ether scan in some ways.
00:21:43.668 - 00:22:36.814, Speaker C: Yeah, I think ultimately we're a small team. Ultimately we kind of felt like the outcome of the entire kind of experience was something that we could live with. We aren't kind of a coinbase where we're kind of a publicly company. We have massive amounts of revenue coming in. We aren't default alive. We are getting to the point where we're building a sustainable business. And for us, it's super critical that we remain focused on our customers and getting kind of pulled into what could be like a multi year and extremely expensive lawsuit where ultimately, I don't know, that what the CFTC was asserting their jurisdiction over.
00:22:36.814 - 00:23:08.870, Speaker C: Leverage. Tokens, I don't think we don't contest that. And for us, we're not building a business around leverage trading or derivatives. That's not our focus. We're focused on offering the widest coverage of tokens. And really that's what we were focused working hard to continue offering on Matcha kind of throughout that entire process with the CFTC. How can we offer access to all the different tokens that exist out there in the world to the degree that we can do it in a compliant way?
00:23:09.020 - 00:23:25.360, Speaker A: Actually, Will, can I ask you, so working with your council, how much did it cost you over those six months? Just ballpark? Was it like a million, 500K? How much did that end up costing you just dealing with this whole thing minus the settlement itself?
00:23:26.210 - 00:23:35.230, Speaker C: I honestly don't know, but it was probably relatively expensive for us.
00:23:35.380 - 00:24:15.454, Speaker A: Okay, yeah. On the order, I would assume if you guys actually went to court, it would likely be in between five and $10 million, I would guess, to fight this thing end to end with the SEC or sorry, with the CFTC. Yeah, I can understand why you guys would not fight this, especially given that it's not core to your business and it doesn't really make a lot of sense to expend a huge amount of money over it. It is unfortunate that all the agencies essentially are mostly focused on startups. Right. Because startups, it's very easy to get them to roll over. They can kind of carve out little pieces of their business and say, AHA, this is the bad part.
00:24:15.454 - 00:24:59.722, Speaker A: We're going to cut this off and you settle and then you'd never touch this thing again. And sort of, of course, don't have the resources to be able to defend themselves against government agencies that have basically unlimited resources. I heard actually that so if you recall, I think it was, I want to say it was early last year or maybe it was 2021 that Uniswap ended up removing leverage tokens from their front end. And I heard that what happened was that they also got a visit from the CFTC, and the CFTC basically said, like, hey, you guys are giving access to these lever tokens on your front end. If you do not remove them, we are going to sue you, or something along those lines. And Uniswap was like, oh well, I think they more or less had the same reaction you did. We don't care about this.
00:24:59.722 - 00:25:27.734, Speaker A: Cool. We're going to remove them. And you might remember the news announcement a little while back that Uniswap had removed these leveraged tokens from the front end. And my understanding was that the CFTC never moved forward with a lawsuit against Uniswap, presumably because they weren't being demanded to. Like, hey, go take some names and go get some headlines. And I guess now they are. So it's a little bit unfortunate and obviously kind of capricious for if that's in fact what happened.
00:25:27.734 - 00:26:07.118, Speaker A: And I'm speculating, or at least relaying rumors that I've heard that if that's what happened to uniswap back in the day, then kind of switching their story and saying, actually, well, if you have a tiny violation by having a couple of tokens on the front end, we're not going to politely come to you and say, hey, can you please remove these? And we believe this is in violation, but obviously it's not. Willful like, you guys are not getting much of your volume from this thing. You're just doing, as you mentioned, a block explorer. You would think like, okay, well, be friendly. Just tell them, hey, take this off and then you guys are not in violation anymore. So it does seem like this is optimized around, making headlines, which know it is what it is. They're under pressure themselves as an agency.
00:26:07.118 - 00:27:09.958, Speaker A: But it makes one think, and we talked about this, Tom, I remember during the Tornado Cash story is Etherscan. Etherscan. Obviously it allows you to see any block, any token, anything on ethereum, right? And if you connect your MetaMask to ether scan or any web3 wallet to ether scan, it allows you to interact with any ERC, 20 token, right? And so an American could go on ether scan, interact, connect their Web three wallet, and then go and buy a leveraged token on ether scan. They could also go and interact with Tornado Cash on ether scan, which is sanctioned, which is not even just Americans, it's sanctioned. I mean, from the US perspective, it's sanctioned for anybody. It does seem that in order to be fully consistent, you would need to say the same thing is true for Etherscan, is that Etherscan is in violation of the CEA, ether scan is in violation of sanctions. It's a little bit of a far fetched argument, perhaps, but insofar as Etherscan does allow you to connect to your Web Three wallet and interact with any contract, I don't know, I'd love to get you guys reactions to that.
00:27:09.958 - 00:27:13.398, Speaker A: It's a little bit of like taking.
00:27:13.564 - 00:28:15.126, Speaker B: Something kind of reductive out of absurd, right? Yeah, it feels like we're just agreeing on the arbitrariness of what abstraction should be liable, right? Like, is Chrome liable because MetaMask is on an extension? Is your ISP liable because they relay the packets? We agree that's absurd, but somehow settling with Matcha is fine. I just feel like overall ignorance of the laws is not an excuse, but at will, as you were sort of describing, there isn't even really clear how to be in compliance. You guys basically made up your own sort of compliance proposal and went back and forth with the CFTC on it until they said, it looks okay. It's not like you drive on the highway until you feel like there's an appropriate speed, and the cop says, oh, that was a little too fast, it was a little too slow. And you just sort of feel it out. There aren't rules in place. And so everyone just feels like they're kind of making stuff up until we get to a good spot.
00:28:15.238 - 00:28:48.486, Speaker C: So I love the etherscan example. I think it's such a good mean because it's like you can read and write to any smart contract through Etherscan, and it is really kind of like the most generalized interface for interacting with things on the blockchain. I really think that what the CFTC takes issue with is facilitating margin trading to retail traders. Right. Is Etherscan a product that is designed to allow retail traders to come and trade leverage products? Absolutely not. Could you do that? Yeah, maybe you could. I don't know.
00:28:48.486 - 00:29:46.440, Speaker C: It'd be kind of funky and the user experience would not be the greatest, but yeah, I think it really comes down to what is the intent here? Are you making these things accessible and easy for retail traders to access? And we don't take issue with the conclusion of the settlement with the CFTC. These leverage tokens are probably within their, you know, like, probably within their jurisdiction, and they probably do have some degree of authority over these things. So, yeah, I think it feels like they are trying to protect everyday traders from going in and doing something that they shouldn't be or that perhaps the CFTC thinks they're not sophisticated enough to.
00:29:46.890 - 00:30:15.998, Speaker A: I mean, look, I'm going to push on this thought experiment a little bit further because I can tell you who uses Etherscan to interact with smart contracts. You said, okay, well, etherscan is not designed for retail. It's not designed for institutions either. Like, who is using etherscan? People who are technically sophisticated, maybe even to marginally. You don't have to be that sophisticated to use etherscan. But people who are technically sophisticated are not institutions. They're like people who know code or just knows some basics of interacting with smart contracts or interacting with EVM.
00:30:15.998 - 00:31:06.900, Speaker A: These are also retail, right? These are not institutions or sophisticated CFTC registered folks. So I don't know of any hedge funds that use etherscan, but I know a lot of people who use etherscan to interact with contracts. Anyway, the point is not so much that, hey, there's this one weird example that will break your brain. The point I think, is closer to what Tom was alluding to, which is that it's very hard to build stuff when there aren't a clear set of rules. And now they can argue like, well, look, now you know the rules. Now that we've done these three settlements, if you list these tokens that are leverage tokens, then you're in trouble and you're violating the CEA fine. I think one can acknowledge that that's a reasonable stance for them to take when it comes to what touches us customers.
00:31:06.900 - 00:31:43.770, Speaker A: That said, it took them basically until 2023, and these three settlements for that to happen, like my understanding, whatever it is that took place with Uniswap happened behind closed doors. It was not announced to the public. Like, hey, here's the rules. Now, again, these settlements are small. They did not try to get an arm and a leg from the three companies that they settled with. But it feels still part and parcel of the same story, which is a lack of regulatory clarity and regulation by enforcement. It's like, this is the exact same thing that we've been complaining about from the SEC that we're now seeing from the CFTC.
00:31:43.770 - 00:32:11.542, Speaker A: Now at least the CFTC is more consistent and their arguments are clearer and they don't imply the wholesale destruction of the industry. Right? The SEC basically wants to see this industry not exist. I think the CFTC wants to say, look, leverage tokens, that's our shit. You're not allowed to touch that. Everything else, go have fun. Which I can be down with that. I just wish that there was more clarity of communication beyond, hey, here are three settlements, go figure out what this means for yourself.
00:32:11.676 - 00:32:55.538, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that's fair. What I will say too, though, is the lack of clarity that we're all feeling as kind of enthusiasts and active participants in this space. I think within these regulatory agencies, they're kind of struggling with the same lack of clarity. Right? They also don't have a rulebook or an instruction manual for how do you deal with a disruptive new technology that flips your entire model of financial transactions on its head. And I think there are probably a lot of people in these agencies that are excited about crypto and probably participate in crypto, and we're all kind of trying to converge on something that makes sense, but it is hard.
00:32:55.624 - 00:33:30.974, Speaker A: And I think regulators but rulemaking is in their purview, right? If you're at the SEC or CFTC, you can make rules and say, hey, here's how it works. If you have front end you list leverage tokens, you're in trouble, right, that violates CA. They can do that. Obviously. I think there's basically been no agency that has offered really complete clarity about how crypto ought to be regulated. And it's not as though this is an impossible task. If you look around the world, at other first world countries that have robust regulatory regimes, there's a lot of clarity in different places, which shows that it can be done.
00:33:30.974 - 00:33:58.886, Speaker A: It's not as though this is some gargantuan living. It's not as though this technology is so impenetrable and so complex. I mean, it's been like six years since you guys started operating. Clearly there are ways that you can look at what's going on in the space and say, AHA, here's how it ought to work. Here are the investor protections we should put into place. As long as you stay within these bounds, you're fine. If the UK can do it, if the EU can do it, if the Middle East can do it, I have no doubt that American regulators can also do it.
00:33:58.886 - 00:34:13.120, Speaker A: They're choosing not to. And again, I'm sure that there are complex incentives that are playing into why it is that the agencies are not willing to do rulemaking and give more clarity to the industry, but they're doing so in a way that's really harming the innovation in the US.
00:34:13.490 - 00:34:13.902, Speaker C: Anyway.
00:34:13.956 - 00:34:59.914, Speaker A: All right, I'll stop soapboxing. So I wanted to move on a little bit. So first of all, Will, thanks for sharing your story about what happened with the CFTC. And I'm glad that you guys are able to move on with building out Matcha and the zero X ecosystem and not getting bonked down with everything that's happened here. I wanted to talk a little bit about this phenomenon that we've seen that you guys are in many ways a part of of these protocols that also have companies attached to them, where there's kind of two things happening at the same time. There's a company that has revenues, has investors, has a set of equity holders on the cap table, and then there's a protocol that of course has a token. And the two things might initially be aligned, they might initially be basically more or less the same, and they diverge over time.
00:34:59.914 - 00:35:31.154, Speaker A: So the most obvious example of this that was in the news recently is Uniswap. So Uniswap, obviously, the Uni token corresponds to Uniswap, the on chain protocol uniswap recently announced not recently, I don't know, a month and a half ago or something. Two months ago they announced Uniswap X, which is their aggregator RFQ system. Whatever it is that is not live yet, but is supposed to be coming live in the near future. And Uniswap X is going to be taking fees. But the fees do not go to the Uni token holders. They go to Uniswap labs.
00:35:31.154 - 00:36:26.322, Speaker A: The company? And Uniswap Labs, the company did a fundraise, they raised like 100 million or something led by, I think it was Polychain and a bunch of other investors. And so you would now have this divergence in Uniswap, the on chain protocol, and Uniswap Labs, the company, that is in some way in some way, not totally, but in some way in competition with Uniswap itself to try to accrue more fees on their front end rather than having the fees accrued to the protocol. Now, of course, Uniswap is weird. There are no protocol fees. So it's kind of I don't know, it's maybe a bad example in that regard, but this phenomenon, which also my understanding is that's that how Zero X works as well, where you have know it's under the purview of Zero X Labs, the company which did a separate fundraise. And then there's Zerox Token, which is more tied directly to the protocol that's on chain. Now, I personally have had a lot of criticisms of this structure.
00:36:26.322 - 00:36:40.710, Speaker A: I mean, we've seen the structure now arrives many times among many different protocols. I want to get your thoughts on how you think about this structure where you have a company, you have a protocol, and the two have differing assets and differing incentives.
00:36:40.870 - 00:37:54.174, Speaker C: Yeah, it's a good question and it's an interesting one too, because I don't know if you asked six years ago would we be here in this kind of current setup and would this kind of be the kind of the playbook for a lot of companies or kind of influential entities in the crypto space? I don't know that we would have thought this would be the outcome. I think this is the result of some tension between public goods building things that are intended to be infrastructure that anyone can use and anyone can benefit from, and other projects, incentives to either build on that existing infrastructure or to build their own, essentially and create their own infrastructure with their own token. Perhaps this is something that we kind of experienced ourselves in 2018, kind of found out the hard way the downsides of not having a direct relationship with the end customer. So we were building Zero X Protocol. All we're building is open source developer tools. Go build whatever you want with it. We're not charging you any fees.
00:37:54.174 - 00:38:47.974, Speaker C: This thing just exists for you to use. And really, if the thing is engineered well, there really isn't that much incentive to fork it and go kind of create your own version of the infrastructure. But that's when you start to add in lots of investment and funding available and kind of the model of success is creating a piece of public infrastructure with a token associated with it, like a governance token. There's a lot stronger incentive for newcomers in the space to kind of compete and introduce their own infrastructure versus building on existing infrastructure. And this is something that we saw in 2018. This product, DDEX, was the kind of most popular marketplace built on top of Zero X. They did an excellent job.
00:38:47.974 - 00:39:31.394, Speaker C: They built a really great consumer product. They had some decent traction, large user base in Asia, and we were thrilled. This is why Zero X exists. We wanted to help people build cool products and innovate and use this infrastructure. And ultimately, we invested so much of our time and effort into trying to help them. And ultimately, I think they decided to kind of create their own infrastructure. And some of their reasoning was they wanted to be able to build for their customers more quickly and effectively versus relying on a platform that sits underneath them or a protocol that sits underneath them.
00:39:31.394 - 00:40:19.698, Speaker C: So I think a lot of the big projects in the space, like the Uniswaps Two, for example, come in with the best of intentions, hey, let's create this piece of technology that everyone can use. And yes, protocol fees exist. It's a way to kind of fund the public good. It's like taxes. So everyone benefits from the services provided by the government, but the government needs to pay for the roads, pay for the firefighters, pay for the police, et cetera. And so you need to have some revenue. But if you can just kind of create a new nation, like a new government, and start bringing in your tax revenues without paying them to someone else, there's a pretty strong incentive to kind of fork and do your own thing.
00:40:19.698 - 00:40:22.242, Speaker C: Uniswap versus Sushi swap is a great example.
00:40:22.296 - 00:41:17.958, Speaker A: Yeah, so if I'm hearing you so back in the day, and I remember a lot of this playing out back in 2017, 20180, x, once upon a time, was super dominant in the deck space, and you guys really tried to be a platform. And this is something that nowadays, as a VC, I strongly discourage people from trying to be platforms. And Zero X is actually one of the it's one of the examples I give that I think is quite instructive of why that tends not to work. Because you guys were trying really, really hard to attract relayers, which were basically these people who built exchanges on top of the Zero X protocol. And the problem is that either one, the relayers that you were attracting to build on top of Zero X sucked. So they just weren't very good. Or the ones that were good, they were so good that they were like, wait, why are we paying Zero X? Why are we allowing their thing to be the back end? Why don't we just fork it and have our own back end and have our own token and do our own thing and middle finger to Zero X.
00:41:17.958 - 00:42:07.710, Speaker A: And it felt like that was probably the teachable moment for the Zero X team of like, hey, this is no good. We cannot try to get other people to build on our rails. We need to build on our own rails and start moving up the stack to directly own the consumer, right? Instead of attracting relayers. We are so much better than any like we're so much better at building products than anybody else who we're attracting to build on top of us. We should just build the products, we should just build the ecosystem. And I think that is in general the correct insight from entrepreneurs is that okay, it's fine to build infrastructure, but probably you are the best person who is positioned to actually be able to build something that is consumer facing, that is retail facing. And it seems like that's where Zerox eventually arrived at with Zero X API and then Matcha as the primary way in which people were going to end up consuming Zero X liquidity.
00:42:07.710 - 00:42:17.480, Speaker A: Now, all that being said well, so first of all, let me pause there, Tom. As somebody who's working on product at that time and making a lot of these, thinking through a lot of this strategically, what do you think of that story?
00:42:17.870 - 00:43:13.674, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that is pretty accurate. You need to kind of be in control of your own destiny. And I think overwhelmingly having it's sort of this bimodal distribution where either you are a true protocol network that has this nice flat distribution of millions of applications that serve you sort of like an ethereum almost or you are sort of true, almost vertically integrated in some ways of having that sort of experience with the user. And the in between is where you kind of get caught and you're sort of the worst of both worlds. I think in some ways it's also sort of a testament to some of the sometimes perverse incentives in the industry around launching a token. I think some of the forks or derivatives of Zero X that I saw were not meaningfully different or even better in any way. But it's a great story around we have our own protocol that complements our thing and we can have a token around it.
00:43:13.674 - 00:44:26.894, Speaker B: I think frankly, the DDEX fork was kind of in this bucket where it wasn't as if, oh, Zero X is too general, we need something more optimized for our use. Case it was we get this app and we may as well have a token and have our own protocol and kind of do it ourselves. But I think going back to your question around equity versus the protocol, I kind of see I'm of two minds of this one, right, is hey, Xerox, the protocol massively more successful as a result of Matcha than it would be otherwise, right? Matcha is driving volume through the protocol and it's bringing on liquidity and that all flows through the protocol. And so it's sort of like you can go run an instance of mongo through MongoDB the company and hey, that sort of supports the open source software. The other being hey, maybe this is in some ways a distraction and these people should be working for the protocol or owe the protocol in some way or the fee should be going to it. I can't help but think this is also frankly a byproduct of the regulatory environment that it be in, that we're in. Wouldn't it be sweet if swaps from Uniswap X went into a Dao and a treasury and went back to the token holders and hey, this whole thing sort of flowed nicely and we aligned incentives.
00:44:26.894 - 00:44:46.520, Speaker B: Unfortunately, that would most likely make Uni look like a security. And so instead it's just way simpler to have this front end take a fee, have it stay in the company. And so it's, I think kind of unfortunate but also just very understandable. If I were a founder I'd be in the same boat as to why you would maybe not want to do that.
00:44:47.530 - 00:45:37.954, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean I buy that story that it's a response to the regulatory pressure of not wanting to make your token to security if it's tied to some consumer facing front end thing that you're maintaining that has back end servers and stuff. At the same time, it strikes me as not just one thing that I really don't like is it's sort of double dipping in that you are raising money twice and you're getting this valuation twice. One for the token and then again for the equity. And the equity almost by definition, I mean perhaps not because if you can say, okay, well, it's creating more value net and it's helping the overall protocol. And so actually it's just creating value. But take Uniswap as an example. Uniswap is probably the best example because it's so dominant in know it's not as though Uniswap X is likely to increase the overall market for crypto or for DeFi trading.
00:45:37.954 - 00:46:19.374, Speaker A: It's very likely to take market share from the one inches or the other aggregators or whatever or other RFQ systems. If it's successful, maybe it's not. The NFT platform obviously was not successful, but let's assume that it is. If it is successful, then let's assume that it's taking fees. Those fees almost by definition must be coming at the expense of some fees that are being paid somewhere else. And given that most of the liquidity in crypto is on Uniswap itself, if more of that volume is going through their RFQ system directly to market makers and Uniswap is taking a fee for standing in between, then that's less volume going to uniswap the protocol. Which means that uniswap the protocol you need the token is going to be capturing less value.
00:46:19.374 - 00:46:24.630, Speaker A: Right? Again you could argue, well, but it's going to increase the market because it's so much more efficient, blah, blah, blah.
00:46:24.970 - 00:46:59.300, Speaker B: Yeah, I would say Uniswap X is maybe a weird example too, just because of the whole RFQ off chain component, which maybe get to get into a little bit, I think, of maybe more just like Uniswap.org. But the interface, I think uniswap is massively more successful and valuable. You need the token a result of having this amazing consumer product effectively. I think it would be great if consumer product development and protocol development could be more incentive aligned and more aligned in terms of where value captures. But I just don't see that today. I think it's very, very difficult to do that.
00:46:59.670 - 00:47:49.506, Speaker A: I agree with you. I think it is very difficult. And again, I feel for founders who are kind of put in this regulatory pincer that no doubt they want everything to be aligned. But the other thing, of course, when you have an equity company and you have a token and the cap table of your equity diverges from the sort of token cap table, so to speak, then now all of a sudden, you really do have two sets of stakeholders who are each vying for the same pie. Right? In some sense, you might want it to be that actually, you know what? Let's lower the Uniswap fees and let's increase the fees on Uniswap X. Now, literally, they're as low as they could be right now on Uniswap, which is zero. But in principle, let's imagine Uniswap did introduce a fee, right? Well, uniswap the foundation would kind of be like, well, look, we have some uni tokens, but we have a lot more uniswap equity or Uniswap Labs or whatever it is.
00:47:49.506 - 00:48:40.946, Speaker A: And so we actually really want for Uniswap Labs to accrue more of that value as opposed to uniswap tokens. Maybe we've already sold a, you know, whatever, maybe we don't own as much as we'd otherwise like to. And so you have these divergent stakeholders, and these divergent stakeholders ultimately, just economically, you would expect there to be tension and competition for the same sort of zero sum competition for the same fees between these two entities. Now, not every single protocol that has an equity and protocol or sorry, token component ends up in this kind of contest, but it seems like a very real risk to me that you'd expect to arise that there's no longer alignment between the equity holders and the token holders. So, okay, Tom and I have been going back and forth. Will, what are your thoughts on this, given the state of the Xerox ecosystem and how the token versus Xerox Labs interact with each other?
00:48:41.048 - 00:49:28.894, Speaker C: Yeah, there is absolutely tension. I mean, ultimately, if you're trying to build a public good infrastructure, you're not as close to the end customer. And I think the opportunity to capture value, the closer you are to the end user, the easier it is to capture value. And if you look at MetaMask as an example, they're able to capture 80 something basis point fees on swap volume. Yeah. Are their incentives aligned with kind of the swap or decentralized exchange protocols that their users are kind of using through MetaMask? No, not really. They're kind of trying to achieve different goals.
00:49:28.894 - 00:50:13.046, Speaker C: They kind of have different objectives. A couple of examples, I think, of open ecosystems where there is a Dow and it is proactively deploying capital in a way that grows and benefits the ecosystem. And there is an ecosystem, it's like ethereum. Some of these layer two networks, like Optimism is a great example. They have a big dow and very active and deploying lots of capital in ways that are probably beneficial for the ecosystem that's being built on top of optimism. That seems to work quite well. And I don't know, it feels like some of that kind of ecosystem incentive alignment gets lost as you work your way up the stack.
00:50:13.046 - 00:50:39.646, Speaker C: Maybe that's fair. Kind of an interesting opposite example is like OpenSea. So OpenSea kind of did the opposite. They started out as a traditional for profit company and ultimately kind of deployed their own protocol. Yes. Yeah, they deployed, you know, with the intention of kind of allowing anyone to build on top of it, including the NFT. Space is very competitive.
00:50:39.646 - 00:50:46.566, Speaker C: It's like fierce competition and yeah, I don't know, I'm curious, are there competitors using Seaport?
00:50:46.678 - 00:50:57.322, Speaker A: If I recall, Blur ended up using Seaport in large part to evade the OpenSea block there. Wasn't that a big part of Blur's early strategy.
00:50:57.466 - 00:51:38.374, Speaker B: Yeah, and they were seeing aggregators, so they get it through there. And there are some smaller marketplaces that also use you know, I hear that example. I think it's a question of, hey, how is value capture represented externally? Right. CPORT kind of looks and it is a public good, but I don't think there's an assumption that people can invest into it or accrue value into it some way. Just some software that you can use if you want to. And I think that's kind of the tension is right now, it seems like, and I think optimism is actually a great example. It seems like there's sort of this, like I said, sort of bimodal outcome in terms of value capture of equity or token.
00:51:38.374 - 00:51:48.814, Speaker B: Hard to see very many examples of sort of a nice happy split and that is sort of, I think, unresolved in the industry and it's not clear how to resolve it.
00:51:48.932 - 00:52:34.570, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't think this is something we're going to be able to get to the bottom of in this conversation naturally. But it's a tension that I see again and again arise as protocols mature, especially once the protocol has a sense that, okay, we're in a good place. From a regulatory perspective. I don't think that anyone wants to come after us or kind of break our door down, except maybe the SEC wants to break everyone's door down, but we still want to do more. We still want to create more things. We still want to be aggressive in building stuff that's retail facing and user facing. But if we have, as Tom mentioned, if we have the profits or the revenue from that go back to the Dow, then it looks super centralized now it looks like, okay, efforts of others, blah, blah, blah.
00:52:34.570 - 00:53:17.450, Speaker A: So let's just take a different structure. Let's use a traditional equity structure and just make this a regular business. And in a way it is cleaner from a legal perspective but it does end up impoverishing token holders to at least some degree. In an ideal world, we would like it to be the case that a company could decide that, hey, we are just going to donate our revenue to the token holders and you could have a company structure that continues to work on the protocol and create things that are built on top of the public goods. But all the value still flows back to the token holders without incurring any kind of regulatory concerns. But we're not there. We don't live in that world.
00:53:17.450 - 00:53:48.630, Speaker A: And so we're kind of stuck in the world we are in, which is that we're probably going to continue seeing more of this thing where you create this initial shell that is the token that is the public good. You build the protocol out and then you set it off to sea and then that is just floating out there. It's just floating out there in the ocean and then you start building your company on the shore. I don't love that model but I think it might be a model that we're stuck with for the foreseeable future until there is significantly more clarity around how you can do these things without violating securities laws.
00:53:49.370 - 00:54:43.314, Speaker C: I'm actually not sure that it's securities laws that are making it hard to kind of align incentives. I think it just has more to do with who's doing the hard work and who's getting paid for it. Like there's a lot of Dows out there that they have capital to deploy and they do deploy it. Is it being deployed in a way that is beneficial for everyone that's potentially building on top of that platform or that protocol? It takes a ton of work to build something that people want. And the people that are doing that hard work ultimately the value should probably flow back to them. And in a lot of cases the people that are doing that hard work are employees at a company. And I don't know that there are too many examples of Dows that can justify their existence long term.
00:54:43.314 - 00:55:26.338, Speaker C: Yet I think there are a lot of Dows that have a significant treasure trove of capital at their disposal. Are they going to be able to bridge the gap to sustainability long term? Their protocol, their platform is creating enough value people are paying to use it that this thing can kind of reach. Kind of like, get the flywheel spinning? I don't know. It's pretty hard. I don't think we've seen any examples. Maybe the closest thing is, like yeah, I think layer two networks are probably the closest thing we've seen because they actually do have economics that seem to maybe be sustainable. Layer two networks generate decent revenue and that can be reinvested into the ecosystem.
00:55:26.338 - 00:55:53.950, Speaker C: And having an ecosystem actually makes sense for layer two networks if they support generalized smart contracts. But I don't know. The entire space has just been so flush with capital and everyone has been operating at a loss for so long that I just don't know that we've actually seen a steady state where value creation and value capture are sustainable.
00:55:54.370 - 00:55:55.120, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:55:55.890 - 00:55:57.040, Speaker C: Does that make sense?
00:55:58.370 - 00:56:43.920, Speaker A: It does. I don't know that I totally agree, but I see where you're coming from, and I agree with you that being able to align incentives, especially when a protocol has existed for a long time and has a very divergent set of stakeholders, can be challenging without creating a different structure for the company that's actually trying to accrue revenue or the product. I should say that's trying to accrue revenue and really become profitable. That said, we're up on time, so we got a wrap. But Will really wanted to thank you for being as candid as you've been with us and walking us through everything that took place at Zero X. You guys are the OGS among OGS and really hope you guys continue to crush it and that we that we get another seven years out of you guys continuing to build in the space.
00:56:44.370 - 00:56:51.760, Speaker C: Thank you, Haseeb. And thank you, Tom. Awesome chatting with you and yeah, excited for the next seven years.
00:56:52.370 - 00:56:54.380, Speaker A: Always. All right, take care, everybody.
