00:00:46.374 - 00:00:48.314, Speaker B: Thanks for having me. It's great to be here.
00:00:48.432 - 00:01:03.598, Speaker A: Electra Capital recently published its annual Developer report. Before we dive into all the findings, just give us a quick reminder of how you're defining your terms, such as developer activity and the various metrics that you are measuring versus what you're not.
00:01:03.764 - 00:01:25.890, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the biggest caveat that we want everyone to take away from is that this is going to be an undercounting of developers. We put a lot of work and thought into counting open source developers, but there's a lot of people working in closed source. So who works in closed source? Coinbase is closed source. OpenSea is closed source. Magic. Eden is closed source. Alchemy is closed source.
00:01:25.890 - 00:01:53.334, Speaker B: Some of the biggest companies in crypto are closed source. So this report shows us two things. One is it looks at trend lines in terms of how developers are trending. Also, I think it's important to understand the health of open source in crypto because crypto is unique in that bitcoin. Launched as open source code, Ethereum is open source. Some of the most important projects are open source. It's a very key part of the crypto DNA.
00:01:53.334 - 00:02:38.270, Speaker B: And so understanding and evaluating the health of that core part of crypto's DNA is really important. So to define some of the terms in order to find a developer, we actually start from the commit code commit level. Code commit is when a developer creates a code update. Within that code update, we get information like the files that they change, the lines of code that they changed, the types of programming language that they use, the time at which they changed it. And we coalesce a lot of this information to fingerprint every single code commit. Within our internal databases, we have 250,000,000 code commits. And so for any new code commit that comes in, we actually compare it to previous ones.
00:02:38.270 - 00:03:05.494, Speaker B: And for this report, we only look at original code. So that means that if the code is forked, if it's copy pasted, it will not count towards a developer. This is not malicious, by the way. Like code is forked all the time. That is not a bad thing. But simply for ourselves and being able to understand the actual number of new open source developers or active open source developers. It's really important to actually sanitize the code in this way.
00:03:05.494 - 00:03:36.574, Speaker B: And so most of the numbers that we'll look at include monthly active developers. A monthly active developer is any developer who has committed code in a 28 day period. We also do further segmentation into full time, part time, and one time developers. A full time developer is anyone who's committed code ten or more days in a 28 day period. Part time is two to nine days, and one time is going to be actually a very strict definition, which is you only committed code once in a three month period.
00:03:36.702 - 00:04:02.780, Speaker A: All right, so now let's talk about this report, because obviously 2022 was quite possibly the worst year in crypto history, at least when it comes to the industry's reputation. So I'm super interested to hear what the results were from this past year, especially because, like I said, reputation is one thing, but developer interest is another. So what would you say are the top takeaways from the 2022 report?
00:04:03.230 - 00:04:44.870, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, this points to why we look at developers as a measure in the first place. Developers are a fundamental measure of the health of an emerging industry, more so than prices. Prices fluctuate and they're very, very prone to change. Developers tell us how many people are actually building, how many people are pushing new code, how many people are creating protocols and useful things, dev tools to bring in more developers, applications to bring in more users. And so that's why that developer number is really important. And of course, one of the really interesting things we've seen is that year over year, developers actually increased. So prices fell 70% from peak this time around.
00:04:44.870 - 00:05:21.458, Speaker B: In 2022, developers increased 5% year over year. And that's very consistent with our findings in the past bear market as well. In the 2017 2018 cycle, after prices peaked, in January of 2018, prices fell 90%, more than 90%, as I'm sure a lot of people painfully remember. But developers stayed flat, which is incredible. Right. What that means is that prices fell, but developers are sticky. And so that means that we're actually able to grow developers really significantly over time.
00:05:21.458 - 00:05:36.706, Speaker B: Prices today are back at where they were roughly in January 2018 levels, but developers have increased by 297%. So that's the kind of retention and growth that we're seeing when developers stick around like they do in crypto.
00:05:36.818 - 00:06:01.882, Speaker A: Yeah, one thing also that struck me is when I was looking at the kind of, like, line graph of the growth and the number of developers. When you look at 2021 and the first half of 2022, it just was growing at this especially fast rate. And I was curious if you could talk about that 18 month span, like if what you think caused that or just anything else about it. It really stands out in the chart.
00:06:02.026 - 00:06:35.946, Speaker B: Yeah, one of the things I find really fascinating is what you're alluding to, which is the speed of growth. Crypto grew very slowly in the beginning. It took us close to seven years to get to 1000 monthly active developers. So from the first time that Satoshi open sourced bitcoin code to when Ethereum launched, we had 1000 open source developers. In the next seven years, we actually added 22,000 more monthly active developers. And so these are kind of step function differences. And so that's one of the things that we definitely saw.
00:06:35.946 - 00:07:25.302, Speaker B: In the 2021 2022 period, a record number of new developers joined crypto. Between 2021 and 2022, more than 109,000 new developers committed code to open source crypto. So again, this is an undercounting, right? This is not counting the new Coinbase employees or new Alchemy or Magic Eden employees versus 2017 to 2018, 44,000 new developers. So we had a massive influx of new developers in that 2021 to 2022 period, which is where you see that chart kind of going vertical for developers. And we also can see a lot of ecosystems grew significantly since 2018. Bitcoin grew three x. So bitcoin is three x bigger than it was in 2018.
00:07:25.302 - 00:07:55.730, Speaker B: Ethereum is five x bigger. A lot of the ecosystems that we kind of talk about as really big players today that have more than 1000 total developers. So this would include, like, polygon, cosmos, polka, dot. These ecosystems barely existed in 2018. They had fewer than 200 total developers, monthly active total developers. So there's really been a kind of a tremendous shift since that 2018 period.
00:07:56.070 - 00:08:28.554, Speaker A: So let's now, of course, talk about the second half of 2022, which obviously, for various reasons, looks quite a bit different. Talk a little bit about how you believe the crypto bankruptcies have affected either developer interest or at the very least, developer activity. And I was just kind of curious if you think some of those declines that you noted were attributed directly to things like job layoffs or if it was really more a reflection of just sort of like a natural decline rather than sort of a direct forcing.
00:08:28.682 - 00:08:54.050, Speaker B: I think there's kind of two things we can look at here. One is just all up developer numbers, and then we can actually go into a terra anecdote. So for all up developer numbers, we had a peak of all time high. So this is a historical high for monthly active developers. In crypto. That happened june of 2022. That peak had 26,323 developers.
00:08:54.050 - 00:09:46.998, Speaker B: Since that peak, we have fallen 11%. One of the core things we tried to understand is who left, right? When developers fall by 11%, what happened? So the segmentation that we did was through the frequency of commits, we want to understand not all developers are contributing code at an equal rate. Some contribute more code than others. It turns out that what we define as full time developers. So developers who are active for ten or more days in a 28 day period, they contribute 76% of the code. So they're a really important metric to track for the actual health because they're the ones building the core protocols, keeping the lights on, moving things forward in a very fundamental way. Full time developers only accounted for 5% of the churn, which means that 95% of the developers who left were part time and one time.
00:09:46.998 - 00:10:26.980, Speaker B: And I think that intuitively makes sense, right? Who is a part time developer? They are the hackathon participants. They are the ones hacking on something in a weekend, playing around tinkering. One time developers are the ones who maybe made a documentation change, maybe they added their validator profile. And those are the types of people that we are seeing leaving in these types of market conditions. But I think the most important sign of health is are those full time developers staying. And I think by looking at the fact that only 5% of the developers who churned were full time, that gives us a lot of confidence that the people who are writing 76% of the code is continuing to write code.
00:10:27.510 - 00:10:57.582, Speaker A: All right, so before we hop into the Terra anecdote, we're going to take a pause to get a quick word from the sponsors who make the show possible.

So obviously, probably what kicked off the beginning, at least, of the decline of developer activity in the second half of 2022 was the collapse of Terra Luna. And you said you had some interesting data around that in terms of developers.
00:11:21.266 - 00:11:52.730, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. Going into this year, one of the things we definitely wanted to analyze was what happened to Terra and where did Terra developers go, what happened after the collapse? And so from the time that Terra launched to when their network halted in May of 2022, terra got up to 175 total developers. So actually not a huge ecosystem, but that growth is very fast.
00:11:52.820 - 00:11:53.074, Speaker A: Right.
00:11:53.112 - 00:12:38.650, Speaker B: I think these decentralized networks take a very long time to come together and to really kind of hit a critical mass. And so Terra actually grew developers incredibly quickly. And they had 175 very healthy monthly active developers at the time when their network halted. After their network halted, they had seven days of kind of deliberations around what to do. And then after seven days, Terra Two created its first commit. So Terra Two then emerged as the successor to Terra. Since then, we see that Terra has 67 monthly active developers.
00:12:38.650 - 00:13:21.690, Speaker B: They have seven full time developers. And so I think a lot of people think oh, maybe Terra doesn't have developers anymore. There actually continue to be people building on Terra too. But obviously that is a tremendous decrease from where they were before their network halted. So one of the things that we did look at is, okay, let's look at the developers who were there before network halt and then after network halt. How do we account for this delta? So, over the first half of 2022, 323 developers committed code to open source Terra repositories. And of those, 56% seems to have stopped contributing code to open source crypto.
00:13:21.690 - 00:13:45.342, Speaker B: They could have left. Maybe they're working in closed source. At the very least, we no longer can track them. We don't know. They're not contributing new code to open source crypto at all. The remainder went to other ecosystems, and by far the most went into the Cosmos ecosystem. A handful went to continue to work on Terra 2.0,
00:13:45.342 - 00:14:04.902, Speaker B: and five developers went to Salana, two developers went to near. So it's really interesting to see that 56% seems to maybe have left or just stopped contributing to open source, and the remainder continued to work, but are just now in other ecosystems.
00:14:05.046 - 00:14:29.346, Speaker A: Yeah, I find it amazing that 56% just stopped contributing to crypto altogether. That's pretty incredible. So now let's obviously talk about kind of the biggest developer ecosystem. Ethereum has historically dominated when it comes to attracting developers, but during this time period, it also faced a lot of competition from other layer ones. So how have you seen its ability to attract developers? Hold up?
00:14:29.528 - 00:14:58.074, Speaker B: I would say very well. But you can see in the numbers that there are other chains emerging. First of all, I think what we've noticed is this is our fourth annual report now and year after year, ethereum is the biggest developer ecosystem by a long shot. So even today, their developer ecosystem is 2.8 times larger than the next biggest ecosystem. So they dominate. And they don't dominate just by a little bit.
00:14:58.074 - 00:15:55.562, Speaker B: They dominate by a lot. And a lot of that has to do with how easy it is to be a developer in Ethereum. I think solidity may not be the easiest, working in blockchain may not be the easiest, but there are amazing learning resources for anyone who wants to get started in Solidity, for anyone who wants to get started in EVM compatible kind of ecosystems, that resource is probably the richest that we have in crypto. And so we kind of see that 16% of all new developers that come into crypto start in the Ethereum ecosystem. So Ethereum is kind of this starter pool for anyone who's coming in, and they're able to retain a lot of developers that way. But one of the really interesting things we see where, hey, it's possible that there's kind of this chipping away is actually when it comes to DFI developers. During DFI summer, ethereum had 70% of all DFI developers.
00:15:55.562 - 00:16:32.118, Speaker B: So 70% of all developers that was building anything in DFI, built it on Ethereum. And DFI summer was summer of 2020. By December of 2022, Ethereum no longer had the majority of DFI developers. They only have 50%. And 50% are now working in other chains, including places like Cosmos, BNB, Salana, polka Dot, Polygon, Avalanche and Kusama. These are the other biggest ecosystems for DeFi developers. And so that's where you begin to see kind of this multi chain universe starting to emerge.
00:16:32.118 - 00:16:42.586, Speaker B: Ethereum is by no means unceded, but I think you see the emergence of other very healthy ecosystems by developer standards outside of Ethereum.
00:16:42.698 - 00:16:51.162, Speaker A: And out of curiosity, how do you see Ethereum's dominance playing out or the competition it faces playing out in EVM compatible chains?
00:16:51.306 - 00:17:28.214, Speaker B: EVM was a really interesting ecosystem for us to look at. I almost think of it as kind of like a EVM universe at this point. It turns out that 37% of layer ones and twos that have more than 50 developers, full time developers, are a VM compatible chain. And so that's a pretty significant number. And it speaks to the strategy that different ecosystems are taking to get developers right. So there's tremendous benefit to being part of the EVM ecosystem. It means that your ecosystem gets to access the really excellent developer resources that everyone has already created for EVM.
00:17:28.214 - 00:18:22.650, Speaker B: And it also means that it's very easy for anyone to extend an existing application to your chain. So the way that we measure this sort of like multi chain behavior is through looking at multi chain developers and what we call primary developers. Arbitrum is an excellent example where someone like GMX is counted as a primary anyone working on GMX would be a primary developer on Arbitrum, but Uniswap also supports Arbitrum. There's a host of other types of applications that support Arbitrum. It's not know there's some work involved to actually extend your application to that chain. And so we count that as multi chain developers versus primary developers. So if you segment developers in this way, it's very clear across the biggest EVM ecosystems that there is tremendous benefit that comes from being EVM.
00:18:22.650 - 00:19:13.306, Speaker B: So Polygon, Avalanche, BNB, Celo, Arbitrum and Optimism are the biggest developer ecosystems in EVM. And all of them across the board have more multi chain developers than they do primary developers and their own primary developers. And multi chain developers kind of grow at different rates. So if we go back to that Arbitrum example, Arbitrum has grew 38% year over year, which is very significant. But let's remember that by absolute numbers, this means they now have 215 monthly active developers. So, very healthy, strong growth, but relatively still kind of in that emerging state. That being said, they have four times more MultiChain developers, so they have 839 monthly active MultiChain developers.
00:19:13.306 - 00:19:47.670, Speaker B: And that's a really kind of interesting dichotomy where you can look at the number of developers that's supporting Arbitrum versus the number of developers that's building on Arbitrum optimism. Very similar optimism has five times more MultiChain developers than they do primary developers. And primary developers grew by 73%, meaning that optimism now has 183 total developers, while MultiChain developers fell by 8%. So we're starting to see kind of these interesting divergences come out between MultiChain and primary developers.
00:19:48.410 - 00:20:08.894, Speaker A: Yeah, that seems like definitely an area to watch because Ethereum's dominance is definitely a storyline, and yet the competition nipping at its heels is also a storyline. So one other area that I definitely wanted to ask that was bitcoin developers remained flat from December 2021 to December 2022. Why do you think that was?
00:20:09.012 - 00:20:52.474, Speaker B: I would say it's because bitcoin is a very mature ecosystem already, and bitcoin is an ecosystem that actually does not encourage a lot of change. And that's by design, right? They're very resilient. It works. It's not an ecosystem where you're looking to shake things up or there's a very, very high bar to make any sort of change. And so, correspondingly, I think there's a difference in the types of trends that I'm looking for in bitcoin. I'm not looking for did bitcoin grow by 50%? I'm actually looking at was bitcoin able to hold on to its existing developers? And it did. And I think what's really remarkable about bitcoin is, unlike almost any other ecosystem, it has a very different chart.
00:20:52.474 - 00:21:25.080, Speaker B: If you look at the new developers that come into the space, it's very resistant to market cycles. It's almost flat at 100 new developers every single month since November of 2017. So in a good cycle, in a bad cycle, it's 100 new developers. They have over 900 monthly active. And so I think that's what's really interesting. It's the steadiness and the stability of bitcoin, which is what you would expect to see in a healthy kind of mature ecosystem like that.
00:21:25.930 - 00:21:33.962, Speaker A: I believe this is a new area of your report is you also talked about NFTs and development in that. What did you find there?
00:21:34.096 - 00:22:25.306, Speaker B: Yeah, we touched upon the development of NFTs. And the reason we did that is because we looked at the change in or we looked at what new wallets did on chain, and it turns out that before 2021, new wallets on chain did a lot of stuff on DFI. Right? So they would swap on a decentralized exchange. Maybe they would do something with stablecoins, they would use a lending protocol, and then that completely flipped, where now new wallets are actually doing more things in the NFT universe than they are in the DFI universe. And so, of course, we're naturally curious about what's happening with developers there. So developers grew 299% since January of 2021. Year over year, they are flat, although year over year, their full time developers grew 30%.
00:22:25.306 - 00:23:22.998, Speaker B: And most of the losses come from one time and part time developers. That being said, I think we actually ended on a note saying that we're not sure that looking at developers is the right lens for NFTs and Gauging NFT Health because so much of NFTs, if you think about it, are based on games or ecosystems where the smart contract for creating the tokens is a fairly minimal amount of code. But the work comes in for maintaining the community, encouraging activity in the community, having a very active membership. And so for NFTs specifically, we continue to think that perhaps looking at open source code in NFTs is not the right metric. It's shown a lot of growth. And so that trendline is really interesting. But we think NFTs, unlike many other sectors, need other signals.
00:23:22.998 - 00:23:46.946, Speaker B: And so one of the things we've been doing internally and we want to push more publicly, is what we call a community signal. And so what is the health of your discord? What is the health of people who's engaging with you on Twitter? How many people are talking about you? How many people are actively participating and actually doing something? So we think for NFT ecosystems, that might actually be the right set of data to look at.
00:23:47.048 - 00:23:56.774, Speaker A: All right, well, this has been an amazing discussion, and there's just so much in your report. I did also want to ask if there's anything that we didn't get to touch on that you think people should know about the report.
00:23:56.892 - 00:24:19.120, Speaker B: Yeah, I would say the last part is this is the first year where we launched Developerreport.com. And so this is a site where you can not only explore the data from the report, but also go very deep. We have actually time series on developer change across 100 different ecosystems and projects. And so that's a resource that we hope can be really useful for the community.
00:24:19.730 - 00:24:31.278, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, I enjoyed digging around that site. Yeah, that's where I saw some of these eye popping charts. All right, Maria, I have enjoyed this so much. Thank you for coming on Unchained.
00:24:31.374 - 00:24:33.154, Speaker B: Thank you so much for having me.
00:24:33.352 - 00:25:13.486, Speaker A: Don't forget, next up is the weekly news recap. Stick around for this week in Crypto after this short break. Thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap. New FTX leadership is considering reviving the exchange. According to the Wall Street Journal, the new leader of the failed cryptocurrency exchange, FTX John Ray II, announced that he has established a task force to investigate possibly restarting the platform. In an interview for Unchained Premium two weeks ago, Sunil Kavuri, an FTX creditor, claimed most of the creditors were in favor. The idea was also mentioned in an Unchained episode with Thomas Brazil and Wasi lawyer.
00:25:13.486 - 00:25:54.014, Speaker A: Ray said, Everything is on the table as FTX explores the options for reviving the exchange. This includes examining whether relaunching FTX's international exchange could potentially provide greater recovery for customers than liquidating assets or selling the platform. Currently, the market for bankruptcy claims on FTX's crypto deposits is not optimistic about their value. Data from Xclaim shows that FTX claims are selling for 15.5% of the face value of account balances. However, this week, the FTX debtors group, represented by law firm Sullivan and Cromwell revealed that it has identified $5.5 billion worth of assets, which includes $1.7
00:25:54.014 - 00:26:49.914, Speaker A: billion of cash, $3.5 billion of crypto assets and $300 million of securities. It is worth noting, however, that the firm is counting FTT FTX's Exchange token as a liquid asset, which is somewhat questionable. Moreover, in order to repay creditors, the company has been granted permission to sell some of its assets, including its subsidiaries LedgerX, Embed Technologies, FTX Japan and FTX Europe. Sam Binkman Fried reiterates FTX US is solvent as SEC charges him with fraud. Former FTX CEO Sam Binkwin Fried is disputing claims made by Sullivan and Cromwell that the exchange has a substantial shortfall. In a post on his recently launched substack newsletter, Binkman Fried asserted again that FTX US is solvent and that the numbers presented by Sullivan and Cromwell do not accurately reflect the exchange's financial status.
00:26:49.914 - 00:27:59.650, Speaker A: He provided an Excel spreadsheet that he created as evidence, which he claims shows that customer balances, bank balances and net asset value have been understated by the litigation firm. On Thursday morning, the securities and Exchange Commission filed charges against Bankman Fried for allegedly defrauding equity investors in the platform. The SEC's complaint alleges that SBF orchestrated a years long fraud to conceal from FTX's investors the undisclosed diversion of customer funds to his privately held crypto hedge fund Alameda Research, as well as the special treatment afforded to Alameda on FTX. The complaint seeks injunctions against future securities law violations, disgorgement of vilgotten gains, a civil penalty and an officer and director bar. The SEC's ongoing investigation is being conducted in conjunction with the US. Attorney's office and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. In other FTX news a week after the new management of FTX requested all political donations to be returned, CoinDesk reported that 196 members of the new Congress, roughly one third of the total, took cash from the former FTX CEO and other senior executives.
00:27:59.650 - 00:29:06.998, Speaker A: Only 27% responded to queries about what they planned to do with the money. In a Twitter thread, former President of FTX US, Brett Harrison claimed that Bankman freed showed emotionally volatile behavior and avoided conflict, ultimately leading Harrison to leave the company. A coalition of major news outlets submitted a petition to the court handling the FTX case requesting the release of the identities of the individuals. Besides his parents who signed Bankman Fried's $250,000,000 bail bond. The media outlets include the Associated Press, Bloomberg, The Financial Times, CNBC, Reuters insider and the Washington Post publisher who argue that it is in the public interest to know who is financially backing Bankman freed. Genesis May soon file for Bankruptcy Major crypto lender Genesis Global Capital, part of the Digital Currency Group conglomerate, is expected to file for Chapter Eleven bankruptcy as soon as this week, according to Bloomberg. Sources familiar with the situation say that creditors of Genesis are currently in negotiations regarding a potential bankruptcy filing.
00:29:06.998 - 00:30:31.346, Speaker A: The negotiations involve a prepackaged bankruptcy plan in which creditors agree to a forbearance period of one to two years. In exchange for this agreement, creditors would receive cash payments and equity in DCG. Scott Johnson, a finance lawyer, said prepackaged bankruptcy would almost certainly mean little to no market impact and a very quick process about as good a resolution as one would hope for. The company froze customer redemptions on November 16, following the downfall of FDX, and this week it informed its shareholders that it will be suspending its quarterly dividend payments until further notice as the crisis has come to a head.
