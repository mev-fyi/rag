00:00:00.330 - 00:00:02.442, Speaker A: Not a dividend, it's a tale of Tupan.
00:00:02.506 - 00:00:05.162, Speaker B: Now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet.
00:00:05.226 - 00:00:07.722, Speaker C: Generally speaking, airdrops are kind of pointless anyways.
00:00:07.866 - 00:00:10.830, Speaker B: Unnamed trading firms who are very involved.
00:00:11.170 - 00:00:12.782, Speaker A: ETH is the ultimate on this.
00:00:12.836 - 00:00:15.840, Speaker D: DeFi protocols are the antidote to this problem.
00:00:16.610 - 00:00:32.898, Speaker B: Hello, everybody. Welcome to the chopping block. Every couple weeks, the four of us get together and give the industry insider's perspective on the crypto topics of the day. So, quick intros. First you've got Tom, the DeFi maven and master of Memes. Next we've got Robert, the crypto connoisseur and captain of Compound. Then we've got Tarun, the gigabrain and grandpuba at Gauntlet.
00:00:32.898 - 00:01:02.778, Speaker B: And then finally, I'm haseeb the head hype man at Dragonfly. So we are early stage investors in crypto, but I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice, legal advice, or even life advice. Please see Chopping blocks at XYZ for more disclosures. So we were just freaking out about this new Azuki drop that has got the internet completely lit up at the time that we're recording this. Robert, please explain for us we okay. Robert, please explain for us what happened with this Azuki drop. Can you just walk us through the storyline here?
00:01:02.964 - 00:01:57.394, Speaker D: So Azuki announced that they were going to be doing a new collection, and they did this by surprising everybody who held Azuki's with some token, some a bean NFT, and the bean NFT would become a new NFT called an elemental. And they decided that they were going to give out a bunch of elementals to existing Azuki holders and then sell a bunch more. And what happened was they raised a ton of money by selling these new elemental beans pre reveal to people in a Dutch auction. And obviously, almost every Dutch auction in crypto history sells out instantly at whatever the starting price is because everyone is so excited. I don't know why anyone uses Dutch auction mechanisms anymore. It's a facade, it's silly. Just set the damn price, it'll sell out.
00:01:57.394 - 00:02:09.320, Speaker D: But each one of these sold for two ether and they raised something like 36 or $40 million selling these new elemental NFTs. And everyone was excited. They're like, oh my God.
00:02:11.610 - 00:02:32.646, Speaker B: After the Dutch auction to the initial holders of the beans, which is this previous kind of low value Azuki collection, it was supposed to also go to a public auction so people in the public could also buy it. But it never got to that point because it got sold out immediately by the bean holders, which made the community already very upset about the way this was managed.
00:02:32.758 - 00:03:15.782, Speaker D: That's right. And then there were some issues with the website and it took a while to be able to reveal them. But the long story short is once they were revealed, the big reveal that everybody was waiting to see what these cool new NFTs were, well, they're shockingly similar to the original collection of Azuki's. In fact, I challenge pretty much anyone to go onto OpenSea or Blur or your favorite NFT platform and compare Azuki's to Azuki elementals. Basically it's the same collection. And so, in essence, what has occurred is they've, I think, like tripled, you know, the number of Azukis out there. Yes, they have a different name, but they're Azukis.
00:03:15.782 - 00:04:00.090, Speaker D: They're basically know Tom's flipping back and forth between Azukis and elementals and you won't be able to tell the difference. And there's a couple of differences. Like, there's a couple of new traits that the elementals have that the original Azukis don't have, and there's slightly more frequency of cool elemental things like fire and lightning and earth and all this stuff. But fundamentally they're Azukis and they basically use this as a way of massively increasing the size of the collection. And so everybody's up in arms. The price of Azukis dropped like 40 something percent pretty much instantly upon this reveal. And crypto Twitter is captivated by this new mechanism called Sell more of the original NFT.
00:04:01.550 - 00:04:07.050, Speaker A: There are two main lessons from this. First is Robert retiring from NFTs. Was a Psyop.
00:04:09.470 - 00:04:13.006, Speaker B: Total scam. Total scam. Clearly you are still very plugged in.
00:04:13.108 - 00:04:26.898, Speaker D: No, I'm an observer. I may dabble here and there. I will, for disclosure purposes, state that I do own two elementals. One that I got for free and one that I purchased below the mint price.
00:04:27.064 - 00:04:28.498, Speaker B: Okay, very good.
00:04:28.664 - 00:04:45.238, Speaker A: The second thing is, and I think I saw someone sort of hinting at this, but Azuki was maybe one of the only big of the large cap NFT projects not to do a fundraise. So maybe this is like they needed cash and all the other oh, they.
00:04:45.244 - 00:04:49.718, Speaker B: Were trying to do a fundraise, they were trying to do a were they were going out to market alongside the.
00:04:49.724 - 00:04:53.130, Speaker A: Same time you I don't remember. But did they get it? Did they close?
00:04:53.280 - 00:05:45.562, Speaker C: I think they did, but also I don't think they needed the money. I think they were making a bunch of money on royalties and even primary mints last year. So I feel like it's like NFTs, they're all trying to figure out their business model and how this whole thing works and looks sustainable. Like, do you try to turn this into a media business or like a gaming business? Or is this just a pure art play and you try to make money on royalties or you sell plushies, I guess, if you're penguins. But I feel like the trick here, really, the grail is being able to do continuous new primary issuance. Like being able to sell $40 million worth of JPEGs is like fucking crazy. And in theory, depending on the market or more true, historically, you're also getting some residuals and some secondaries royalties on secondary sales as well.
00:05:45.562 - 00:06:02.550, Speaker C: And so it's all kind of a question of like, well, how can I keep my community going by throwing events or doing some giveaways or doing something to sort of allow you to do new primary issuance and everything is almost sort of a game around that versus any of these other things in my opinion.
00:06:02.730 - 00:06:57.086, Speaker D: I agree. I mean the most concerning thing is that the standard playbook for an NFT project, regardless of if it's like media or whatever is make more. Like, that seems to be like the go to instinct for almost every single project that's successful and there's various degrees of success and credibility in that approach. But almost every project's instinct is like make more NFTs. It's almost like there was projects very early on that were like oh, what do we do next? We'll make another token and there's projects with multiple tokens. I feel like the instinct is just make more NFTs and I think that's the wrong instinct. I think to succeed projects would be better off instead of making more NFTs and making a more complex ecosystem and blah, blah, blah figuring out things that you could do for the existing NFTs, not just make more NFTs.
00:06:57.118 - 00:07:07.700, Speaker A: I know this show gives a disclaimer about not providing any investment advice, but I would love to know what your thesis was for buying one because I don't.
00:07:11.670 - 00:07:17.026, Speaker B: So what were you expecting them to look like when you were buying the Elementals?
00:07:17.218 - 00:07:32.950, Speaker D: I mean, honestly, I was expecting them to look like something different from Azuki's. Better than beans. I don't know if anyone out there is an NFT collector. They launched a know at some point called Beans. And the beans I think are the most ridiculous NFTs ever made by like a blue chip ish collection.
00:07:33.030 - 00:07:37.694, Speaker B: Yeah, they're not very cool. It's like very hard to imagine somebody making a bean as their PFP. No.
00:07:37.732 - 00:08:03.090, Speaker D: I personally think that mutants are extremely uncool. Like Board Ape was awesome and they made mutants and they're obviously very aesthetically unpleasing. They're not cool. They're kind of offensive. Beans were kind of like the mutants of Izuki. They were like silly looking and kind of stupid and why would you really want like it was almost like a joke that they were playing on their own. Like oh, you're going to want beans.
00:08:03.090 - 00:08:30.110, Speaker D: Right? And the beans were these little silly things and okay, it was a massive divergence from the original collection. So I just assumed incorrectly, I think everyone on Twitter assumed incorrectly that by releasing a third collection, the third collection would not be Azukis, it would not be beans, it would be like some other thing in the universe instead of just being more Azukis.
00:08:32.210 - 00:09:12.794, Speaker B: I really struggle one that they didn't understand that if you are trying to maintain the exclusivity of your brand that you don't just make more of the same thing. Right? Like if Rolex decides all of a sudden like, hey, we're going to create 100,000 of these this year just for the hell of it because whatever, we need some revenue. That is such a bad decision. Although it's kind of obviously going to make money right now. It basically torpedoes your business. It's hard to imagine that they didn't understand that. And I guess the other side of it is it does seem like a bit of a failure of imagination that they're just more anime characters that are also in profile.
00:09:12.794 - 00:09:31.780, Speaker B: Looking to the left, there doesn't really seem to be that much new. Like you mentioned, there's a few other animals. There's like raccoons or cats or something. There's two animals? Yeah. Most of them just look like ordinary I would not know those were not part of the original collection if you had not raised it to me that, oh, no, these are elementals. These are different.
00:09:32.310 - 00:09:34.958, Speaker C: I can't believe this is turning into an NFT podcast.
00:09:35.054 - 00:09:38.686, Speaker B: I feel like we have to be that NFT podcast now that NFTs are not cool anymore.
00:09:38.798 - 00:09:43.014, Speaker D: I agree. We have to embrace the least cool thing at all, right?
00:09:43.052 - 00:10:03.690, Speaker B: That's right. But what was so notable about this collection was that people were talking about how this is the revival of NFT primary sales. Because this is the largest NFT primary sale in like, six to seven months when NFT volumes have collapsed and volumes are super low. And this feels like a dagger in the heart of NFT collectors of just like why would you ever buy another mint, you fool?
00:10:03.770 - 00:10:11.818, Speaker C: You missed out on the lady Maker Fumo Mint, which is another notable did I primary issuance.
00:10:11.994 - 00:10:13.438, Speaker D: How much did that raise?
00:10:13.534 - 00:10:13.986, Speaker B: I don't know.
00:10:14.008 - 00:10:25.022, Speaker C: An aggregate, but they're going for like, 40K now. But it's very different. They're like plush animal stuffed animals.
00:10:25.166 - 00:10:26.500, Speaker B: You got to pull one. All right.
00:10:27.210 - 00:10:28.610, Speaker C: Okay, let me describe.
00:10:28.690 - 00:10:32.534, Speaker B: Can't do an NFT show without you showing us what you're showing us. A JPEG. Yeah.
00:10:32.572 - 00:10:33.302, Speaker C: Look at that.
00:10:33.436 - 00:10:34.360, Speaker B: Wait, what?
00:10:35.050 - 00:10:37.320, Speaker C: Anyway, they're redeemable for.
00:10:40.430 - 00:10:43.126, Speaker B: I see. So it's really like a collector's item.
00:10:43.238 - 00:10:45.850, Speaker C: Correct. And they sold on a bonding curve.
00:10:46.350 - 00:10:47.366, Speaker B: It's unisock style.
00:10:47.398 - 00:10:49.574, Speaker D: It's unisock for mulady plush toys.
00:10:49.622 - 00:10:51.210, Speaker B: Yeah, I see. Okay, got it.
00:10:51.280 - 00:10:52.700, Speaker D: Do you own one time?
00:10:53.150 - 00:10:56.906, Speaker C: I did not. I do not. I missed the mint and too far up the bonding curve.
00:10:56.938 - 00:10:58.526, Speaker D: Now you're no longer as cool as.
00:10:58.548 - 00:11:27.878, Speaker A: I thought you wait. Can I ask a more opinionated question? I was watching some documentary on Michael Milken the other day because I forgot he got pardoned or something recently, which I thought happened a long time ago. So I was just like, oh, let me go revisit some financial history. So the real question to me is, who's the milk in of NFTs to you? I have my answer, but I'm curious what everyone else's answer is.
00:11:28.044 - 00:11:38.470, Speaker B: Hold on. Before we get there, my first question is, is this what, like, a Friday night with a girl? Is this what you watch? A documentary about the history of financial?
00:11:38.630 - 00:11:40.794, Speaker A: Sometimes you just gotta do what you gotta do.
00:11:40.992 - 00:11:43.582, Speaker B: Okay, got it. Cool. Sorry, Robert. Go ahead.
00:11:43.636 - 00:11:48.254, Speaker D: So I was going to ask Tarun, since I've never thought about who the Michael milken of NFTs is.
00:11:48.292 - 00:12:10.238, Speaker A: Tarun, who is machi machi big brother in some ways has very similar style aesthetic in terms of the types of equivalent junk bonds, I guess, that exist in NFT land. It's neither a compliment nor an insult. It's sort of like a liminal sort thing. Yeah.
00:12:10.344 - 00:12:13.158, Speaker C: How would you describe the milkenness if.
00:12:13.164 - 00:12:52.418, Speaker A: You were to I think it's just that no one else ever sells a ton of things and then immediately goes and takes out loans on the same thing and takes leverage and buys them. Like, it just reminds me of the Ivan bosky and milken back and forth, where boski would manipulate some price and then milken would sell things into that price manipulation. And it's kind of amazing. People seem to be doing that directly. Maybe that's too niche of an answer, but I don't know enough NFT traders. I just know him because he's the most famous one.
00:12:52.584 - 00:13:02.774, Speaker B: I got to say, I am so outside of every aspect of this conversation. I'm going to vote that we end the NFT section for the show, but we're going to bring this back.
00:13:02.972 - 00:13:03.446, Speaker A: You know what?
00:13:03.468 - 00:13:06.230, Speaker B: Now that NFT is audible anymore, we should open every show.
00:13:06.300 - 00:13:12.650, Speaker A: Anyone has their own notion of who the milken is, please tweet at me. I'm curious.
00:13:13.710 - 00:13:14.810, Speaker D: Yeah, tweet it.
00:13:14.960 - 00:13:37.742, Speaker B: Please tweet it. Tarun for your milk and of. Okay, let's. So moving on to more traditional finance, prime trust, very much in the spirit of the times, there's another big failure, spontaneous combustion in the crypto realm, which is this custodian called prime trust. So I knew of prime trust. I never really knew that much about it. I knew it was kind of out there somewhere in the world.
00:13:37.742 - 00:14:04.426, Speaker B: So last week, the story was that they were going to get acquired by BitCo. They were in some kind of distress. It was very unclear exactly what was going on, but there were some rumors that things were bad in a bad state over at PrimeTrust. PrimeTrust, to be clear, is a fairly small custodian. I think the three biggest custodians in crypto are probably coinbase, BitGo and anchorage. So prime trust a much smaller player than any of those. Obviously, there's also fidelity and nasdaq and all these other folks who are launching custodians, but prime trust was always there.
00:14:04.426 - 00:14:35.986, Speaker B: So BitGo was going to acquire them and they sort of pulled the binance a little bit of they said, oh, we're interested in acquiring. We sent them an loi. They kicked the tires and they said, oh, my god, never mind, we're not acquiring these guys. And that caused anybody who had money at prime trust to be very sad. Now, I'm not totally clear who has money at prime trust, because everybody seems to claim they don't. So I think it was rumored that true. USD had money at prime trust, but then they've disclaimed having any money at prime trust, except now they've seen they have $26,000 at Prime Trust, which is basically nothing.
00:14:35.986 - 00:15:17.566, Speaker B: So just today, the Nevada financial regulator basically said that Prime Trust should be put into custodianship, and it's now reported exactly what went wrong at PrimeTrust. So we have a window into how this custodian ended up collapsing. Basically, they ended up at one point, so initially they had their own crypto wallets that they were managing on behalf of customers. They ended up moving over to Fireblocks and having Fireblocks manage all their wallets, except they had this concept of legacy wallets, which were basically their old wallet system, I guess. And for some reason, Fireblocks didn't have certain flexibility they wanted. And so they were creating throughout 2022 some of these old legacy wallets using their old system. But it turned out these legacy wallets were not being persisted or something.
00:15:17.566 - 00:16:07.886, Speaker B: And so they essentially were creating these wallets on their own interfaces, but they did not actually have the private keys to these wallets. And so they were telling people, ah, yes, we created a new wallet for you and your Bitcoin is over here, according to our internal ledger. But they did not have any of the crypto. And so when they realized this, they were like, oh, shit, we don't have the money that we keep telling our customers we have. Let's go use our cash deposits, which are being given to us by customers who are depositing fiat in their custodian, and let's use that to buy the crypto that we don't have to give people withdrawals and kind of keep the party going. So this looks like just a total, complete circus. Their liabilities, they have about $85 million in crypto liabilities and about $70 million in sorry, maybe I'm getting this money wrong.
00:16:07.886 - 00:16:08.858, Speaker B: What's the cash liabilities?
00:16:08.954 - 00:16:39.370, Speaker C: The other way around, it's $85 million in cash liabilities and like 69 mil in crypto liabilities. But the crypto is almost one to one and it's almost all audience tokens audio. The rest is like some Bitcoin and stuff like that. But yeah, they only have three mil in cash, so they're like 82 mil short. And so, yeah, it's like, where did the money go? Maybe it was all lost in sort of trying to buy back the crypto that they lost. But also their custodians should have insurance. So the whole thing seems very goofy to me.
00:16:39.520 - 00:16:51.840, Speaker B: I would be amazed if insurance pays out for something this retarded like this stupid. I cannot imagine how an insurance doesn't be like, yeah, sure, that seems like that falls within the bounds of your insurance policy.
00:16:54.050 - 00:17:01.586, Speaker A: Actually, this is a good question, though, because I thought insurance was actually still hard to get for a lot of custodians, I'm sure.
00:17:01.688 - 00:17:03.106, Speaker B: So I'm sure also their deposits are.
00:17:03.128 - 00:17:12.470, Speaker A: Like maybe they just went way over their cap and they are now not covered because they went over their total cap.
00:17:12.620 - 00:17:16.680, Speaker B: I mean, I also think they don't cover fraud, right? This is fraud, basically, right?
00:17:17.050 - 00:17:34.890, Speaker A: But it was all fraud when they just lost it. That was like business practice, insurance, I don't know. But when they fucked up the key management themselves, that wasn't fraud. That was like incompetence. But that was an accident.
00:17:39.170 - 00:18:16.346, Speaker B: At the moment you realize it, you tell your customers and you're like, yo, we don't have the money. We don't have crypto. Yeah, we threw your crypto in the trash can, but we'll buy some, buy some for you at that moment. Yes, the fraud claim could have been averted at that point. But when you keep the show running, when you realize and you start buying crypto with your cash that belongs to customers because it's a custodian, right? This is not their money. This is not like an exchange where it's all basically an omnibus account. And who knows really what the bankruptcy rules are for a custodian, the rules are very simple.
00:18:16.346 - 00:18:27.406, Speaker B: For a custodian, it is not your money. It is the client's money. Period. Full stop. So this kind of thing is taking their money and using it to buy crypto is theft. Yeah.
00:18:27.428 - 00:18:35.170, Speaker D: It's trading your customers assets without their awareness of it to try to make it all back. I mean, that's just crazy.
00:18:35.320 - 00:18:41.380, Speaker A: Well, to be fair, under what theory of all of the 2022 stuff was that?
00:18:42.230 - 00:19:15.062, Speaker B: Yeah, to be clear. So at least FTX, there was some theory of how you made the money back, right? FTX at least was like, oh, I'm going to go long my shitcoins and I'm going to trade it. I'm going to do these brilliant yield farming techniques with these guys. I'm like, why would you do this? Why would you think, like, this isn't going to immediately blow up in your face when you just have 3 million in cash versus 85 million in liabilities? Now, to be clear, these are all relatively small numbers. In absolute terms, this is a small custodian. So we can kind of point and say, ha, these guys are idiots. And audio.
00:19:15.062 - 00:19:47.826, Speaker B: So their crypto liabilities, the 70 million in crypto liability, obviously a lot of it's already been drained because people heard all the instability and so they were pulling their money out. So this might be a pittance compared to what they previously were custody, I don't know. But the crypto tokens, as Tom mentioned, 61.5 million out of the 69 million in liabilities are audience tokens. It's like something like 30% of the audience supply, which means that the non audience crypto is like $8 million of like bitcoin and ether or something. So this is very small amounts of money that these guys were holding.
00:19:47.858 - 00:19:57.610, Speaker A: But also, I think the true USD thing was kind of a little bit weird also, right? Because true USD is one of the they were kept a large portion of the true USD supply at PrimeTrust.
00:19:58.750 - 00:20:13.294, Speaker C: So, yeah, I don't know what's happening with True USD because I think some of these rumors around insolvency came out like a week ago. And then there was a big true USD short, but then Binance was also incentivizing true USD and not charging fees on the pair. So I don't know what is actually happening.
00:20:13.412 - 00:20:18.514, Speaker A: It wasn't all apparent trust. I think that's basically what people are.
00:20:18.552 - 00:20:48.762, Speaker B: Basically, yeah. I think they claimed they took their money out at some point quite a bit quite a bit ago, before even any of this recent instability. They took their money out. Then they said after Prime Trust went under that they had $26,000 at prime trust, which is again, like a rounding error for true USD. All in all, kind of a clown show. So now the Nevada regulator is saying, okay, let's put this thing under receivership and shut it down. Like, why is this still operating? I don't know.
00:20:48.762 - 00:21:28.450, Speaker B: But again, this is such a small custodian. In absolute terms, the big custodians are probably 100 times bigger than these guys, at least at this point. I don't know what they were at their peak, but just goes to show the importance of diligence and also the important thing of just knowing the competence of your business leaders. This is one of the things people don't give enough credit to for Coinbase. Coinbase has been around for how long has it been? Like eight years? Nine years since Coinbase inception. And they've never gotten hacked. And that is incredible.
00:21:28.450 - 00:21:50.234, Speaker B: An absolutely incredible record of custodying, that amount of bitcoin, being a honeypot for that many years and never getting don't. That is one thing I feel like people do not give enough credit to coinbase for, is just having absolute world class OpSec and robustness in the way they do things. That's part of the reason why they're so trusted by the industry. Agreed.
00:21:50.282 - 00:22:47.886, Speaker D: But the bigger issue here, beyond not getting hacked, because in essence, they got hacked. I mean, they didn't get hacked. They lost the assets. But there's the assets go into the black hole and then there's the COVID up, which is the consequence of it, right? Like, if Coinbase somehow had assets go into a black hole, which it always could, right? Like, there's no guarantee that any custodian can keep all the assets completely safe at all times. If the assets go into the black know, you're basically saying you would trust them not to cover it up and lie about it and fraud it. And so the real problem here that I see with Prime Trust is not it's hard to safeguard assets because it's extraordinarily hard to safeguard assets, right? Even as a custodian, it's how they handled it, which is like the truly disappointing like, it's so hard to safeguard assets. It's hard for individuals, it's hard for businesses, it's hard for custodians whose job it like it's just hard, right? It's hard for exchanges.
00:22:47.886 - 00:23:16.726, Speaker D: How many exchanges have lost assets? Mount gox lost assets, right? Like quadriga probably lost assets. There's so many instances of people losing crypto assets because keeping them safe is extraordinarily complicated. And from there, it separates into the good guys who own up to it and the bad guys who cover it up and dig themselves deeper trying to bake it all back somehow.
00:23:16.838 - 00:23:44.562, Speaker B: Well, I agree with you. Obviously, the thing that needs to be condemned is that they were hiding it and covering it up and trying to run this kind of Ponzi like structure. This is almost literally a Ponzi scheme where they're taking deposits from new people and using it to pay out folks who had their crypto black hole. The thing, though, that the core root of it is that these guys had no business custody in crypto if they could not figure out how to make sure that when you send them money that there's a private key associated with the address receiving it.
00:23:44.616 - 00:23:46.034, Speaker A: By the way, this has happened once.
00:23:46.072 - 00:23:48.034, Speaker B: Before, also, not even the one on one.
00:23:48.152 - 00:23:53.494, Speaker A: I don't know if you remember, there was this like, stakehound thing, which was like an early ETH staker, right, which.
00:23:53.532 - 00:23:55.330, Speaker D: Also got locked out of their fine block.
00:23:55.410 - 00:24:02.386, Speaker A: BLS key shares are much harder than normal private key. But if you're going to be doing them, then know how the fuck a pairing works.
00:24:02.508 - 00:24:05.626, Speaker B: Do not there's no way this has anything to do with no, but you.
00:24:05.648 - 00:24:18.990, Speaker A: Have to understand how to maintain them, make sure you understand which share to keep, which one to dispose of, which one is trusted setup. If you fucking can't understand what a pairing is, you should not be managing key money using them.
00:24:19.140 - 00:24:39.800, Speaker B: Yeah, no, that's right. And look, I mean, ultimately they kind of made the right choice in moving to fireblocks and saying, okay, we're going to outsource the technology part of the custody to fireblocks, which is, wow, great move. But then they second guessed themselves. They're like, oh, wait, no, we need this other feature. Who knows what it was and that caused them to just completely screw over all their customers and themselves.
00:24:42.010 - 00:25:09.306, Speaker D: Well, anyway, my takeaway from this is I always go back to first principles. This is yet again, one of the reasons why DeFi has the long term advantage. Because if a DeFi protocol somehow black hole assets, everybody would know right away and there would be no ability to cover it up. There would be no fraud next steps, there's radical transparency, and this would not happen with a smart contract.
00:25:09.498 - 00:25:23.778, Speaker B: That is true. But okay, there's another conversation to be had here about self custody, right? And that custody is hard. That's part of the reason why people want to outsource their custody to fireblocks or to coinbase or to whatever.
00:25:23.864 - 00:25:29.446, Speaker D: It's extremely hard. That's why I gave all my crypto to Tarun and he keeps the private key safe. It's still safe, right?
00:25:29.468 - 00:25:32.440, Speaker A: Tarun? You're not supposed to ever answer that.
00:25:33.770 - 00:25:35.394, Speaker B: That's the beauty of trusted third parties.
00:25:35.442 - 00:26:28.406, Speaker A: They solve all mean, I do think, I hope that stuff like this forces people who are aiming to be custodians to actually understand how cryptography works. I feel like the problem is there are a lot of people who are like, oh, this is going to be just like running a random software company, or like, oh, this is going to be running like a trading desk. I don't have to think that hard about the cryptography stuff. Isn't it just like, call this library and hit encrypt and decrypt and it works and I don't have to think about what other fucking files it's generating, how I generate the entropy. And then I think there's a lot of people who are very over eager and think they already know that stuff without realizing they don't. Which I think was also kind of true in the FTX case, too, in some ways.
00:26:28.588 - 00:26:46.638, Speaker C: I feel like it's been a while since we've actually had a large amount of crypto get black hole. Like the Parity wallet stuff was kind of like the last thing that comes to mind. But beyond that, it's usually almost always hacks, right? Somebody's stealing it, but very rarely does it actually get stuck somewhere because someone lost access or lost the private key or something.
00:26:46.804 - 00:26:50.606, Speaker B: Wasn't there. Winter Mute Didn't they do something?
00:26:50.788 - 00:26:52.310, Speaker D: Oh, with the multi SIG?
00:26:52.490 - 00:26:53.220, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:26:56.470 - 00:27:00.194, Speaker D: That was someone else was able to get their address and take the money.
00:27:00.312 - 00:27:08.214, Speaker C: Yeah, they deployed the nosisafe to optimism to the address that they should have deployed to on main net.
00:27:08.252 - 00:27:11.640, Speaker B: And so yeah, anyway.
00:27:13.610 - 00:27:29.466, Speaker A: But the thing to Robert's point, earlier that Winter Mute thing was observed almost immediately by tons of people, right? It was not like you found out a year later this Prime Press thing has been going on for a while, right? It wasn't like two weeks ago they started doing that.
00:27:29.568 - 00:27:33.610, Speaker B: Yeah, this was last year, 2022 that they were doing this.
00:27:33.760 - 00:27:40.910, Speaker D: Listen, every Ponzi scheme starts with someone like losing a little money and being like, oh, I'll make it back before anyone finds out. That's like Bernie Madoff.
00:27:41.330 - 00:28:03.346, Speaker A: That's like half the hilarious thing to me was like in 2021 when people were overly bullion, anytime there'd be a tiny market downturn, people would say, the make it back in one trade, meme. And I sort of think they really I thought it was a joke. And then now I've come to realize two years later that all these people took that shit seriously.
00:28:03.458 - 00:28:05.590, Speaker B: A lot of people did not get the joke.
00:28:06.010 - 00:28:08.780, Speaker A: I can't believe yeah.
00:28:11.070 - 00:29:01.126, Speaker B: But here's the other thing, too. To ruin your earlier point about Custodians should be scared of this industry because it's hard. And getting one little thing wrong can mean basically the end of your business or loss of massive amounts of customer funds. It's one of the reasons why when we started on the investing side, basically looking at Custodians, because there were, of course, a lot of custodians back in the day. That you could conceivably custody your digital assets at. And now there are even more. The number one thing is just how strong is your tech team? Like, how strong is your paranoia, how strong is your OpSec? And that's one of the things that despite the fact that there are all these great stalwart financial firms that are now getting into crypto custody for us, one of the reasons why we default to the Coinbases and the Anchorages of the world is that they've been doing this for so long and they take it so seriously.
00:29:01.126 - 00:29:14.570, Speaker B: Like, for them, it is absolute of prime importance to never underestimate the task that's in front of you, which is keeping your crypto safe, not messing it up yourself and not getting hacked. And it's so easy. You get it wrong once.
00:29:14.640 - 00:30:09.082, Speaker A: This is also I'm quite negative on some of the traditional finance custodians doing it themselves. I think they're going to end up just buying someone because they are not going to be able to. They all seem so overly optimistic of like, oh, we're just going to hire like five people and do it and good luck. But the one thing that's funny about it is none of this stuff is very static, right? Like if you look at the choice of public keys, even through the ethereum merge, understanding the changes to the curves, whether you should be expecting the same public key or not, whether you should be expecting the signatures to look the same. All of that stuff in this space changes much faster in web two land and definitely in finance land. Everyone always tells you the following adage, which is like, never roll your own cryptography, never make your own cryptography. Like, just use some other library.
00:30:09.082 - 00:30:51.526, Speaker A: And cryptocurrency is the only space where actually every fucking chain is writing its own new thing because they are actually implementing some new cryptography that had never been used before. And if you, the user, aren't cognizant of that in and of itself, when you're doing it, you're just going to completely fuck up. And I think somehow Tradfy people have this, we already know this, we're so smart attitude towards this and I don't think they appreciate the nuances in these systems. From a math standpoint, from a CS standpoint, from an engineering standpoint, there's like so many layers to it. It's not just like press encrypt and decrypt in the library, which I don't know, sorry for my little bully pulpit.
00:30:51.558 - 00:30:53.934, Speaker B: But Tom, you can add something.
00:30:54.052 - 00:31:20.866, Speaker C: Yeah, I was going to say, I think obviously having a great tech team is important and all is equal, better than not. But I think independent of that, I would actually much rather take a team with an insurance policy from Lloyds over a team as a great tech team, but no insurance any day. And so I think there is something to just like falling back and having some sort of sort of recourse because it is sort of the nobody's insuring.
00:31:20.898 - 00:31:22.850, Speaker B: Custodians for the entire assets.
00:31:22.930 - 00:31:32.634, Speaker D: No, not yet. Probably not even for like 20 years. Not until the science of keeping the assets there is like but this gets.
00:31:32.672 - 00:31:58.050, Speaker A: To my point of like I don't think this industry is not like stationary cryptography. Every single time there's some new signature scheme, there's some new encryption scheme and that's most of the advances in this space that are not found anywhere else. Is that so? Because of that, I don't think we're anywhere near some crystallization point except for bitcoin keys. Like bitcoin basically is not changing.
00:31:58.710 - 00:32:35.230, Speaker B: It's plausible that if you have a mega player like a Fidelity, that they could potentially self insure and basically say like, look, if you want an insurance policy, you pay extra and we'll use the rest of our balance sheet to ensure your deposit. That seems plausible to me. And maybe that is a structural advantage that somebody like Fidelity could lord over a coinbase or Anchorage or a BitGo, but right mean, for those of you who are not in the industry and don't realize this, it is almost impossible to get insurance in crypto. Like underwriters just do not know how to underwrite crypto. They don't know what the risks are. There's too little history. The blow ups are big and dramatic, but then a lot of things are just fine for a very long time.
00:32:35.230 - 00:33:12.540, Speaker B: It's very difficult to underwrite this space. So anybody ask anybody who's in crypto and trying to get insurance, mostly you're just going to get the door slammed in your face or you're going to get crazy, crazy premiums which for a startup just don't make sense, right. That you can't be paying half your runway in insurance premiums. It doesn't make any sense. So that will someday change. I don't know if it's ten years, five years, 20 years. I hope it's not the longer side of that, but the TradFi players who are very big and have different diversified businesses, I could see them gaining an edge there in basically saying, look, we're going to self insure, but yeah, Lloyds is not going to be insuring a custodian anytime soon.
00:33:12.540 - 00:34:00.022, Speaker B: Okay, let's move on. So it was a little light on news this week, so we thought we'd check in with a little bit of a different angle and do kind of a broader examination of the state of crypto. And we wanted to talk about layer twos because there's a lot of conversation going on right now about layer two is one of the most dynamic areas within the broader crypto smart contracts ecosystem. So we wanted to talk a little bit about the state of the market and some of the interesting things that are going on in the layer two world. So I'll start with a little bit of exposition and then we'll just kind of kick off a broader discussion. So l two s for those of who are not aware of what an L two is an L two short for a layer two. A layer two is basically anything that roots its trust in the layer one, but creates sort of another layer of blockchain block space that you can interact on that's not directly on the layer one itself.
00:34:00.022 - 00:34:31.502, Speaker B: So the way that I like to analogize it is that a layer two is kind of like a skyscraper that creates more real estate on top of the underlying city. So in the case of layer twos, mostly today, we're talking about roll ups, although lightning on bitcoin is growing quite a bit, actually. There's a lot of news about that, but let's mostly focus on roll ups. So roll ups there are today call it four main players. There's more now, but we'll say that the big ones today are there's Arbitrum, which is the leader. It's got most TVL, I think they've got like 5 billion. Plus they've got a lot of daily actives.
00:34:31.502 - 00:34:57.530, Speaker B: So arbitram huge player. Then there's optimism. Both of those are optimistic roll ups. And then we've got Zksync, which is kind of newly on the rise or growing very quickly, which is a ZK roll up. And then there's Starkware, which is not EVM compatible. Unlike the other three, they have their own totally separate language and ecosystem. So there's a few things that are going on right now, and I'll have the first topic of discussion be about layer threes.
00:34:57.530 - 00:35:18.850, Speaker B: So layer threes have kind of become this meme that's become increasingly popular. Everyone's announcing their new layer three. Arbitrum has orbit chains. Zksync has hyperchains. Starkx, they have Validiums, which they've been kind of advertising for a while, and some of them obviously already out there. And then optimism, they have what is optimism called their layer threes? Is it hyperchains as well?
00:35:19.000 - 00:35:19.838, Speaker A: Superchain.
00:35:19.934 - 00:35:23.102, Speaker B: Superchain. superchain. superchain. Sorry, I forget the prefixes.
00:35:23.166 - 00:35:33.080, Speaker A: No, but the reason that you might is that one of the newest superchain entities used to call everything they built.
00:35:39.870 - 00:36:09.826, Speaker B: So Zora recently announced that they're launching their own Op stack, which is a fork of optimism, and they're building a super chain on optimism. So layer three, simply put my understanding, tarune, correct me if I'm wrong, my understanding of a layer three is that basically it's a layer two on top of the layer two. So you build a skyscraper on top of the skyscraper, but there's a fast exit. So that basically, if you want to go from the super mega skyscraper on top of the other skyscraper all the way down to ground floor, you can take one elevator and go all the way down.
00:36:09.928 - 00:36:14.340, Speaker A: The skyscraper analogy, I feel like, doesn't quite recurse as well.
00:36:16.230 - 00:36:18.098, Speaker B: I thought it actually recurs quite beautifully.
00:36:18.194 - 00:36:25.480, Speaker A: How many times have you seen someone build a skyscraper on a skyscraper other than, like, that failed hotel? Yeah.
00:36:27.450 - 00:37:03.038, Speaker B: Go to the Middle East, you're going to see a lot of very interesting structures that's basically layer three layer three is becoming more popular and the Op stack has become kind of a meme at this point, is that lots and lots of people are now building on the Op stack. One of our portfolio companies called Dara, which is like a roll up as a service company, facilitates people launching their own roll ups. Base, of course, is an Opsack roll up. Zora is opsack. Roll up. I guess these are all going to be super chains now. What do you guys think of this layer three concept and the proliferation of the Op stack? I should also caveat.
00:37:03.038 - 00:37:05.720, Speaker B: You guys are investors in Op. Yeah, I believe dragonfly is not.
00:37:06.490 - 00:37:52.834, Speaker A: I would say in the same way that in the 1999 tech bubble, webvan was a good idea, but like, wrong timing, wrong execution. Arguably all of this stuff actually existed in 2017 under the name of Plasma. And a lot of the exit games and stuff are the same, but people didn't understand how to implement these things and where the interfaces were and which things were necessary components in the same way. Hopefully the thesis is that cell phones were necessary for these types of businesses. That didn't work in 1999 when no one had cell phone. And now Ethereum is sufficiently strong to be this base piece, whereas it was.
00:37:52.872 - 00:37:57.502, Speaker B: Not development wise that Ethereum was sufficiently strong. Why Ethereum?
00:37:57.566 - 00:38:30.430, Speaker A: Well, because, I mean, to use as a DA layer, to use it as the final exit layer of like your assets are really stored there. You need to build all these contracts for doing that. It was very hard to do that in 2017. Bordering on impossible. And I think a bunch of different other things in Ethereum ecosystem, developer, ecosystem wise, have made it a lot easier. Whereas in 2017 you could see the idea, but the idea of implementing it was impossible. Which is why you saw the Amisa goes over the world kind of try and fail and stuff like that, right? There were so many people who tried.
00:38:30.500 - 00:39:10.086, Speaker B: I would characterize it differently. I would characterize it differently. So I think in 2017, Plasma, for those of who you don't know, those of you who came in in the last three years probably never even heard this term. So Plasma was kind of the predecessor of all the layer two s that have taken place, the optimistic roll ups and all the roll up stuff. Plasma was basically a very primitive version of a roll up that had a lot of problems around data availability. Basically, they didn't really have an answer for data availability and they didn't have good solutions for general computation. So a lot of the initial ideas around Plasmas were that you could transfer UTXOs on Plasmas and then the exits were a gigantic nightmare.
00:39:10.086 - 00:39:27.842, Speaker B: But as a user, you had to track your own UTXO and then manually exit it. And it was a whole thing that was just very unrealistic for users to be able to manage all this. So omissa Go was one example. There was Loom, if you remember. I think Giorgios used to be at Loom and that's how he first became Mr. Georgios, mr. Lair Two is from all his work there.
00:39:27.842 - 00:40:05.326, Speaker B: So there were some folks that were really trying to launch these plasmas, but they weren't really working. And I think the biggest thing that was holding plasmas back is that there wasn't really a good answer for general computation. So you couldn't do a Turing Complete or do EVM, right? And that's ultimately what we've seen is now massive, massive product market. Fit is EVM? If you cannot do EVM, you're just not going to get use, right? People do not want to build. I mean, there are obviously some kind of application specific blockchains like dYdX and so on, that do have some traction. But for the most part, the vast majority of block space is EVM. Block space, that's what most people care about.
00:40:05.428 - 00:40:12.270, Speaker A: Majority of used block space, there's a lot of not used blocks. There's a lot of empty blocks in some places.
00:40:12.690 - 00:40:45.126, Speaker B: That's true, yes. The majority of demand for block space is for EVM block. I think the reason why this happened, one was that we needed to actually develop the ideas behind roll ups, which took a while, there were a lot of false starts. So, like optimism, they started with the OVM, which was like a shim between EVM and their own internal representation or whatever, and then they abandoned that. They kind of scrapped the whole thing and then just did what Arbitrum was doing with the direct EVM compatibility. So, long story short, has been just be EVM compatible. That's number one rule.
00:40:45.126 - 00:41:34.410, Speaker B: And then the second thing also is that optimism is still not really done right? Like the Op stack doesn't have fraud proofs and almost all the roll ups are still highly guarded, right? Like they're protected by multisigs. The upgrade process right now is still not being done through decentralized governance. Arbitrum does have fraud proofs, but the fraud proofs are whitelisted, so only certain parties can actually submit the fraud proofs. So the reality is that for Op stack, in particular, for Base Zora, whatever, these things are not even really roll ups because there's no fraud proofs, right? So you are not getting the guarantees from Ethereum without any fraud proofs. Right now it's just basically sidechain that spits out data availability on some other layer. So the point I'm making is that I think it really is about R-D-I don't think it's about Ethereum.
00:41:35.470 - 00:42:08.760, Speaker A: They were sort of coupled, right, like Ethereum's roadmap at that time with trying to do what sort of full sharding, like I guess some people like Nier did, right, was just very different in the sense like some of the design decisions being made were made for that use case. Whereas right now it's very clear, okay, we need to make storage blobs cheaper. We need to do all this stuff to make roll ups better. Right, but a lot of that just came. I agree it's R and D, but the R and D actually was initially all at the base layer and getting.
00:42:10.090 - 00:42:14.182, Speaker B: But what has Ethereum even done that facilitated roll ups in the last three years?
00:42:14.236 - 00:42:25.526, Speaker A: I mean, making developer tools so you can do the verification contracts. There's like lots of little tiny things that are annoying that I would say that 2018, 2019 you could not implement.
00:42:25.558 - 00:42:25.706, Speaker B: Right.
00:42:25.728 - 00:43:35.630, Speaker A: 2019, 2018, you could implement usop, you could implement compound. Took a lot of work. You had contract limit sizes, you had to do all this stuff. And the logic for a lot of the L two stuff is actually quite complicated comparatively. I'm just saying I think that there was quite a bit of Ethereum core development needed and a focus not on sharding at the base protocol and a focus on this kind of almost like distributed sort of form of that now. Yeah, again, I agree with you that it remains to be seen that if we get like, how do you deal with fraud proof, how do you deal with data availability? And so, yeah, data availability for, I guess the listeners who don't understand, I know we kind of tossed that term around like three times, is the idea that the base chain where your assets are on is the one that's really providing the data for these other chains. So you're posting the data both to the base layer and to the other chain, such that if you wanted to exit or there was some type of fraud which is what? A fraud proof or fault proof.
00:43:35.630 - 00:44:22.000, Speaker A: Kind of shows you then that way the layer, one can say, okay, well, you can exit. You can take your assets out. Like something wasn't working there. So your assets are still tethered to the main initial chain. A lot of the earlier designs to haseeb's earlier point kind of were focused just on doing payments, right? Like Bitcoin's Lightning Network is just payments and doesn't really have contract functionality or putting conditions or covenants on things. But I think the idea of having tightly coupled shards that were each an application versus this kind of you can add your own. And in the average case, you don't have to interact with the expensive layer one very often.
00:44:22.000 - 00:45:11.390, Speaker A: There was a lot of things that needed to go right to get to this point. But I think that the question to me is what's the level of interoperability between these chains? Because in Cosmos you do technically already have the interoperability. You just have zero demand for block space, basically. And the question here is there seems to be some demand, like, I guess Base and Arbitrum obviously has some of the most highest organic demand. Optimism has a lot of demand from sort of incentivized demand. So the real question, I guess, is how much do these things need to talk to each other? And if there's 20 of them, are they really going to be all 20 used or is it still going to concentrate to the ones that have the most liquidity user apps?
00:45:11.730 - 00:45:18.466, Speaker D: Well, I think it goes to the ones with the most liquidity and user apps and reason to be there. Why wouldn't it? Like, what else is going to for.
00:45:18.488 - 00:45:30.840, Speaker A: Sure, but we kind of have this boom right now, right? And people who are like, I'm going to build my own app chain, but now it's called X roll up. Like Op Stack roll up, arbitrage roll up.
00:45:32.010 - 00:46:04.640, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that is a lot of it, frankly, is people want their own chain. But normally if you're rolling your own Cosmos chain, you can make an argument around, oh, well, here's all the reasons why this chain is going to be optimized or tailored to my specific use case or these Validators going to be perfect for my specific thing. I kind of struggle with that a little bit more with roll ups. I don't even know how much customization we've seen amongst some of the Op Stack deployments that have come out so far. It just seems like there's less customizability. And so it's like, why this thing versus just doing it on sort of the main L two?
00:46:05.090 - 00:46:49.454, Speaker B: So one other element of this that I think is interesting to talk about is Polygon. So Polygon, they kind of sit in this weird no man's land where they're sort of they're an L one, but they also have other products underneath the same product suite. So they've got Zkevm, which is there. There's Zkevm, which was built by Jordy Balina. And they recently announced that they're going to be transitioning the sort of Polygon mainnet, which is ostensibly a layer one, into being a ZKE EVM Validium. So Validium basically is basically a roll up. A ZK roll up that has the data availability totally off chain in some other place.
00:46:49.454 - 00:47:40.478, Speaker B: So the bridge is on Ethereum, but the data availability is somewhere else. So it's cheaper to run a Validium than to run a kind of full ZK roll up. And the interesting thing so there know Sundeep, the founder of Polygon, was just complaining that people treat them like the ugly stepchild of the ethereum community in that no matter what they do, the ethereum community always finds some. Way to poke a hole in it or to tell them that they're not really decentralized, they're not really a layer two, they're not really whatever. How do you guys see what Polygon is doing and how it fits into the layer two story? Because they're definitely one thing that's very clear is that they're not Ethereum cool kids, they're not the Anointed, they're not blessed by Vitalik and all these other folks. How do you contextualize that into everything that's happening in the blockchain world?
00:47:40.644 - 00:48:13.290, Speaker D: I mean, I don't think you have to be anointed. I don't think you have to have some social proof. You just have to have a reason for something to exist. Right. And I think it goes the other way, where if there's a reason for something to exist, some roll up, some app chain, some whatever, then later people will say, oh, it's here for a good reason, it's anointed or blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I would say to any builders out there, screw what people on Twitter say. If it needs to exist, it should exist.
00:48:13.710 - 00:48:34.798, Speaker B: Yes, that is true to an extent. But the roll ups on Ethereum are unlike a lot of other technology races in that they are very, very political. Particularly on ethereum. Roll ups are super political. And I think part of the reason why roll ups are so political is that it is deeply tied with the long term roadmap of ethereum. Right.
00:48:34.964 - 00:48:38.274, Speaker A: Sharding to roll up around Shard transition was a big deal.
00:48:38.472 - 00:49:17.182, Speaker B: Exactly. The original story was that ethereum was going to transition to a bunch of shards like a bunch of little baby ethereums that would all talk to each other. That was the big vision of how to scale ethereum. And then they gave that up because they basically said, look, doing a bunch of roll ups is going to be easier, okay? You guys will be able to move much faster than we as ethereum can. So let's just embrace the roll up vision that instead of a thousand baby ethereums, there's going to be a thousand baby roll ups on top of a thousand ethereums. And we'll just be like the substrate on which all these skyscrapers will get built, okay? In that vision of the world, it really matters. It really matters who ethereum embraces as being like, yes, we will support you.
00:49:17.182 - 00:49:32.770, Speaker B: We will make the opcodes that you ask for cheaper. We will convene our blob storage around your particular ideas. We will tell people there are a lot of things that are not so subtle about the way in which ethereum is influencing the outcome of the roll of wars.
00:49:33.430 - 00:49:37.640, Speaker D: But the op codes that they roll out benefit everybody.
00:49:39.610 - 00:50:00.300, Speaker A: You're really talking about two kind of separate things. The EIP process for making changes to theorem is extremely politically motivated, politically generated, but arguably arbitram's organic kind of very natural success comes from the fact that they just built the most reliable roll up first, right?
00:50:01.310 - 00:50:08.906, Speaker B: Totally. Totally. Which also shows the chasm that they had to overcome. Right? Like optimus, they were so far ahead of optimism.
00:50:08.938 - 00:50:27.038, Speaker A: My point is technical, sophistication can get you past these political that's kind of the beauty of crypto. You built this thing that was better for Oracles and so then the purpose protocols are better, so then they get brought there and that was completely unrelated to Ethereum politics.
00:50:27.214 - 00:50:33.042, Speaker B: But what you're acknowledging, Tarun, what you're acknowledging when you say that is that optimism was the one that was preferred by the Ethereum.
00:50:33.106 - 00:50:41.910, Speaker A: But I'm saying in spite of that, it didn't change the outcome. The outcome was like you built the best thing, right? Like whoever built the thing that found users.
00:50:43.390 - 00:51:01.086, Speaker B: Imagine if the Ethereum Foundation was like, actually, Arbitrum is better and we love Arbitrum and we're going to pose with them for photo ops, we're going to tell everybody that Arbitrum is the way that Ethereum is going to scale. And Vitalik mentioned Arbitrum in every single blog post. Optimism would have no oxygen, they would not be able to breathe from how.
00:51:01.188 - 00:51:52.800, Speaker A: Dominant if they made some technical advance. That was really good for applications that had users, like in the case of Arbitrum making it, having all these features such that perps were actually much more reliable there than perpetual futures. DeFi protocols were more robust than they were on optimism. Then if the opposite thing happened, I still think the same outcome happens because people who are the developers who are building these apps are just looking for particular properties, right? It's like, why do I choose AWS or GCP as my Amazon Web services or Google Cloud for my cloud hosting? It's like, oh, maybe they have some particular feature or they have a particular type of GPU and it's reliable and I can get it and I'm always able.
00:51:53.890 - 00:51:56.462, Speaker B: What exactly is that difference between arbitrary and optimism?
00:51:56.526 - 00:53:06.054, Speaker A: Well, I think the optimism bedrock upgrade kind of fixes a lot of the things that people complained about. But the block time reliability wasn't as good. The latency reliability, the way the message passing to the end user was for mev, stuff was just better. I think it was the learning path of going from OVM to different things. So my point is there's a sense in which arbortrum did really get a lot of these engineering decisions, right, at the time, that there were these applications that really needed them and had this amazing organic growth story, right? They really did have organic non incentivized via tokens growth and that built up their ecosystem. My point is, I think the roll up wars there is some real politic, no doubt, right? It certainly shows up. But I do think your technical capabilities are the most important thing eventually, right? If you make the technical capabilities that are exactly what the developers at that time are demanding, it's going to be hard to compete with that.
00:53:06.054 - 00:53:43.140, Speaker A: Now. I think your point about Polygon is polygon was sort of started as early and they were effectively their own L, one that happened to be an EVM, right? And then now they're kind of backing into it. So it's just a different Gestation story, right. They didn't start purely on the mothership. They kind of started with this thing that use a little bit of substrate and a little bit of cos. Their code base also doesn't look like we are purely in ETH. I forget what that law is that's like how your code base looks reflects the communication pattern at your company.
00:53:43.140 - 00:54:06.650, Speaker A: I feel like that's actually true in blockchains. That's true in roll ups too, is like how your code base looks is a reflection of your contributors community and the applications that want to build on you. And you should strive for that to look like the thing, you know? And I think that will be the ultimate determinant. Anyway, I'm done ranting.
00:54:07.310 - 00:54:08.634, Speaker B: Tom, you were to say something.
00:54:08.752 - 00:54:54.726, Speaker C: Well, I think Matic started it out as like a sidechain, right? And so they've always been close to the Ethereum ecosystem and they've been trying to figure out, I think, there was not an answer for years as to how you actually go about building a real business and company like this. And the answer for a while was, we just jerry rig this thing and kind of make something that looks like what people want. And it's like, yeah, if you don't do that and you try to have some sort of purity test, you probably just die because it's straight up not functional or not even possible to do what you're trying to do. So it's like navigating this weird balance of trying to find something that has immediate PMF but also trying to build for this long term path. It's not, I think, as simple as just building to some pure R D vision and hope know, it works several.
00:54:54.758 - 00:55:37.718, Speaker B: Years down the line, PMF being product market. So I really like that point, Tom, and I totally agree with it, is that in a way, being able to just build tech that nobody wants and nobody uses and just hang around and wait for the world to change is basically a privilege that can be afforded to you in an environment that's awash with mean. The one thing that I will give them a lot of credit for, they came from India. Obviously, the entire team is Indian, and a lot of their usage is outside of the First World. That's where their stronghold is kind of non First World users. And they had to scrimp and scrape for everything that they got. And I have a huge amount of respect for that.
00:55:37.718 - 00:56:03.482, Speaker B: It doesn't appeal very much to the Ethereum intelligentsia, but because it's not this sort of pristine, like, wait, why didn't you start as a roll up? And immediately blah, blah, blah, blah. And they're like, look, we try to build the things that people wanted. You guys are building the things that each other said that each other should want. And nobody was using any of your shit. Two, three years ago, we were building the things that people actually wanted. People wanted block space. They wanted to have, I don't know, whatever, all the stuff that Polygon has launched.
00:56:03.482 - 00:56:54.330, Speaker B: They obviously have a large product suite. And you guys said you wanted Web Two kind of traditional companies and brands to partner and do stuff in Web Three. Well, okay, we're doing that's. Exactly what we're doing. That hustle is what I really respect about polygon, but it is certainly true that they don't have this kind of pristine, kind of evolutionary origin story the way that so many people in the kind of Western technology world would very much prefer them to. So, okay, last thing I want to talk about on the tarun, you mentioned mev with respect to what was going on with optimism versus arbitram. One of the things we've been seeing a lot of just as VCs getting a lot of pitches about sequencers, shared sequencers.
00:56:54.330 - 00:57:48.126, Speaker B: So, okay, what the hell is a shared sequencer? Let me see if I can come up with a okay, I'm going to use a skyscraper analogy for this. When you're running a layer two, there is some entity that is basically deciding the ordering of all the transactions in the layer two, and they're kind of doing the work of processing stuff. They're kind of the CPU of that mini blockchain. You can sort of think of this as like the leasing office of the skyscraper, right? You need somebody in there who's, like, kind of doing the work of allocating all the rooms or whatever. And so a shared sequencer is this idea that you can have multiple skyscrapers that are controlled by the same leasing office. And the advantage of this there are a few advantages of this, but one of the nice advantages of this is that you can basically do a deal, do like a transfer across chain transaction, a bridge or some kind of cross roll up mev. So basically say I want to do this and that across these two blockchains.
00:57:48.126 - 00:58:11.914, Speaker B: And if both of them cannot be done, I want to cancel the transaction outright. So you can get some atomic guarantees across multiple blockchains or multiple roll ups. You can do that through one leasing office, right? You can be like, I want this room in this skyscraper and this room in this skyscraper. But if I can't get both, I don't want either of them. That can only be done if you have one party to negotiate with. So these are these sort of shared sequencers. These are becoming kind of a new hot thing.
00:58:11.914 - 00:58:37.310, Speaker B: There's also decentralized sequencers, which is kind of the story for all these guys that not only are these sequencers going to be shared across multiple roll ups, but also they're going to be decentralized in some way today. They're all pretty much centralized. How do you guys think about decentralized sequencers? Is this an interesting thing to invest in? Do we think it's going to be big? Do we think that only small roll ups are going to have shared sequencers, or is this going to be the new future? I'm sure, Tarun, you have very strong opinions. I can see you smiling.
00:58:37.470 - 00:59:59.930, Speaker A: I think the funny thing that we learned is a lot of companies we invested in last year started saying they were doing different things and then all of a sudden converged on, hey, we're all going to do shared sequencers, which I thought was funny. When you see the market pivot into something, there's some sort of at least idea level demand for it. I think it's just very hard to get right. Your goal is to be as lightweight as possible without just making another blockchain that's intermediating between all these chains. But yeah, the dream is that one of the most beautiful things in crypto, and especially in DeFi that you don't really have in normal finance at all, is this concept of a flash loan where you can borrow capital and your loan only exists if your activity, your arbitrage or whatever your function is able to return profitably. Then the loan happens. And it's sort of a way of guaranteeing atomicity, guaranteeing execution in a particular order of a sequence of transactions, but it's also a way of doing sort of like risk free lending because it really is risk free, right? Like it only executes if these things conditions covenants work and are profitable.
00:59:59.930 - 01:00:56.414, Speaker A: And obviously, as the blockchain ecosystem got much more complicated post 2020, people always want ways to do the same thing. They would like some guarantees of that form. And there's always sort of this inherent problem where if you have two machines that are independent, they don't quite have to respect one another. And you could kind of think of if you think of these chains as nations, the idea of the bridges are bridges are kind of like when you go at the airport and they check your passport and they're like, no, we're denying you. They're sort of the sense of like you're moving between regions that are different, they have different rules and maybe in that new region your assets will have different kind of covenants or lack thereof, added to them. The goal of the shared sequencer is somehow to pick some subset of things that are free trade agreements. At least that's how I like to think of them.
01:00:56.414 - 01:01:03.840, Speaker A: It's like guaranteeing atomicity over these two different regions is a little bit like NAFTA. It's like we agree that these two.
01:01:06.370 - 01:01:09.822, Speaker B: Think, okay, I like the leasing office better, but I'll take NAFTA.
01:01:09.886 - 01:01:11.294, Speaker A: I just think the fair trade versus.
01:01:11.342 - 01:01:13.518, Speaker B: Not fair, that's either very Tarun esque.
01:01:13.614 - 01:02:18.754, Speaker A: Fair trade versus not fair trade is like the bridges have to handle all possible things, handle all the tariffs. Fair trade is like whatever we guarantee you, this will always go across. And so I think there's a sense in which that's sort of where it's hard. It has some of the same problems of like, how do you remunerate the shared sequencer for doing this action of making it feel like a fair trade zone and how do you make it so that it's easy to verify on both sides? But yeah, there's clearly a ton of interest in this. I think there's also a lot of debate over this. I think people in the land where people don't want things to be asynchronous like solana, they sort of view the shared sequencer as like well, aren't you just going back to what we're doing? Because you're like guaranteeing these atomicity guarantees that we always guarantee because everyone's on the same chain and there's no separation of church and state. And on the other hand, you have people in Ethereum who are like hey, we're a bunch of Op Stack roll ups.
01:02:18.754 - 01:02:31.840, Speaker A: We're likely sharing a lot of assets on Ethereum that are being used in our chains. Can we make some extra guarantees on both sides? And that's sort of this fair free trade agreement type of thing.
01:02:32.610 - 01:03:40.226, Speaker B: So the first thought that I have about shared sequencers is that one, it feels to me like it's interesting but it feels a little bit bike sheddy. Like it feels like this is the amount of interest and attention and energy going into this problem feels a little bit overweight to its actual importance to user experience of these things. The reality is optimism. Stack does not have fraud proofs, right? That seems like a really big problem but so much brain power is being expended on how to create shared sequencers. It feels a little bit like a kind of misdirection of just because it's intellectually interesting. The other side of it of course is that the problem with shared sequencer is also the kind of the noisy neighbor problem which is that if you are an Arbitrum or you are kind of optimism Mainet, you got a lot of shit going on. You're very full, right? You don't necessarily want to be adjoined at the hip to 20 other roll ups that are also going to be kind of sending their transactions to the same sequencer that's you've got the Passport Stamping Office.
01:03:40.226 - 01:04:19.118, Speaker B: If you have 20 security lines going to the same passport office, it's just going to be more of a shit show and like, you're going to have latency problems, congestion problems, all that sort of stuff is just going to wear down on you. And so the biggest roll ups I have to imagine are going to be fairly selective in who they allow to share sequencing with them. And then these folks who are going to be on shared sequencers are going to be folks who are like well, I really want to be on a shared sequencer with Arbitrum because that's where all the action is. But Arbitrum doesn't want me to be sharing their sequencer. And so there is kind of a little bit of know, people want to be part of a club but the clubs they're going to be invited to are not the clubs they want to be a part of.
01:04:19.284 - 01:04:31.554, Speaker A: I think though, if you have any desire to decentralize the execution you kind of have to have this kind of sense in which anyone can do it.
01:04:31.592 - 01:05:14.014, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that's kind of the bigger point people make. I mean, that's always kind of the classic criticisms of ll Two is like, haven't we kind of just gone all the way full circle when now we have just a single computer processing all the transactions and we have one point that does go down, not infrequently and can censor transactions. And so it's like, yeah, it's not as bad as sort of having arbitrary statewriting capabilities, but there are sort of downsides to having sort of a single sequencer. And so I think that's kind of more the angle that I guess I think of this coming from in terms of benefits. But to your point around performance, it feels like we're so far from being.
01:05:14.052 - 01:05:19.634, Speaker B: At a point where but decentralized sequencers and shared sequencers are two totally orthogonal things.
01:05:19.832 - 01:05:32.440, Speaker A: Sure, one will cause the I can't join the club problem, and then the other one will kind of be like where most of the income is, wait.
01:05:35.690 - 01:05:46.102, Speaker B: If ZK Sync has decentralized sequencer, why would that have any impact on the I can't join the club problem? Right? They can still decide with decentralized governance. No, you can't join our club.
01:05:46.166 - 01:06:24.920, Speaker A: I mean, theoretically, the shared sequencer itself should be allowed to be joined by anyone who's a sequencer member in one. Like, if you had a decentralized sequencer, I can't give you any of the shared guarantees unless all the pools of possible sequencers is overlapping because otherwise I'll lose some of those guarantees. I think it's like if you actually are decentralized, then anyone can always give these evidence to guarantees. So I'm saying the decentralized sequence, the desire to decentralize a sequencer will cause the shared part to not be as clubby as you might think is my guess.
01:06:25.690 - 01:07:10.760, Speaker B: Okay, let me understand your mental model here. So you're saying, let's say that optimism, let's say Opsac optimism, mainet moves to a decentralized sensor, not a shared sequencer. Okay? They move to decentralized sequencer. You're saying that once they have a decentralized sequencer, then anybody will be able to say, hey, I want to add myself to the shared sequencing conduit so that I'm also being entered into the same decentralized sequencer. Why would that be the case? Why wouldn't it be the case that the plurality of the people who are sequencing for Op Stack would say, no, we strictly only want to have one blockchain that we're sequencing, or we want to have three, or we want to have five, and we're not inviting you to that five.
01:07:12.170 - 01:07:45.630, Speaker A: I think if they're doing a free trade agreement with Arbitrum in order to give those Adamicity guarantees whenever to any application that requests it, to have that liveness for that, they effectively have to let anyone in the Arbitrum sequencing pool who is sequencing at that time be providing the shared guarantee on the leg on the other leg. Right. I believe Arbitrum already does have this implemented for having multiple sequencers rotating for epochs, fixed epochs.
01:07:46.450 - 01:08:00.654, Speaker B: See? I see. So if it's your epoch, as long as you're also on the Arbitrum, like it's your epoch on Arbitrum and your epoch on optimism, then in that moment that you line up on both rotations, you can be the shared sequence.
01:08:00.702 - 01:08:08.700, Speaker A: Yeah, that's kind of where I kind of think if they really are going to decentralize, that the shared part ends up having to inherit that property.
01:08:10.590 - 01:08:13.770, Speaker B: Kind of. Okay, I see your point. Sorry, Tom, I interrupted.
01:08:15.550 - 01:08:37.614, Speaker C: Was pretty much done. I think it's more like it feels like we're so far from sort of the performance required for these things to be sort of mainstream and successful to then, I think, consider basically performance degradation for the sake of decentralization. I don't know. It just also feels like a thing that, yes, we should get to in the roadmap, but not as sort of critical.
01:08:37.742 - 01:08:45.700, Speaker A: I kind of agree that it's a little bit web vanny in that you probably need applications that are really demanding it, right?
01:08:48.330 - 01:09:04.074, Speaker B: Yeah. The amount of times I've heard the hotel and train problem as an explanation of why we need these is telling that right now this is more an intellectually interesting problem than it is, like the most important thing that, well, maybe.
01:09:04.192 - 01:09:13.834, Speaker A: If we step back from this infrastructure kind of conversation. What are the applications that you think you're most excited about that are coming in this format?
01:09:13.882 - 01:09:14.094, Speaker B: Right.
01:09:14.132 - 01:09:15.902, Speaker A: Because there's a ton of them coming.
01:09:15.956 - 01:10:03.950, Speaker B: Out in this format being app chain rollout wires, cross appchain roll up. Well, I think we've established that I am not as bullish on appchain as you are. Look, I think Duidx moving to Cosmos is really interesting. I'd love to see how that plays out. I think right now, the Duidx, they have a lot of confidence that they're going to be able to pull people away from Ethereum and move into their own infrastructure. I think that'll be an interesting experiment to see how robust this sort of app chain thesis is for a product that has really strong brand, really strong user base, really strong metrics like Duidx. What are you guys seeing? Are there things that you guys are excited about that you think are interesting app chain opportunities? Is that a no? I'm hearing silence.
01:10:04.290 - 01:10:06.782, Speaker D: Well, let's continue this one on the next show.
01:10:06.916 - 01:10:26.680, Speaker B: Okay. All right, we're over and I think we're starting to flag a little bit. Okay, we're a bit overtime, so we're going to call it there but Interesting Times in l Two Land. This is a story that we'll continue checking in on as it continues to evolve. For now. That's it for this week, you thank you, everybody.
