Today's topic is the SEC lawsuit against Ripple and two of its executives. Here to discuss are Stephen Powley, partner at Anderson Kill, and Gabriel Shapiro, partner at BSV Law. Welcome, Stephen and Gabriel.
00:01:14.446 - 00:01:17.160, Speaker B: Hey, Laura, nice to be here. Thank you.
00:01:18.010 - 00:01:39.274, Speaker A: So, let's set the baseline for listeners. On December 22, the SEC announced a lawsuit against Ripple and Chris Larson, who is the former CEO and current chairman, and Brad Garlinghouse, the current CEO. Steven, why don't we start with you? Do you want to give a brief summary of what the SEC is suing them for and why this lawsuit is a big deal?
00:01:39.392 - 00:02:22.154, Speaker B: Sure. And actually, the SEC does a very nice job summarizing it itself. In the beginning of the lawsuit, it was filed in federal court in New York, in the Southern District of New York, which is in that courthouse is in Lower Manhattan. And the SEC alleges that from about 2013 to the present, the defendants, which you correctly identified as Ripple Labs, bradley Garlinghouse and Christian Larson, sold over 14.6 billion units of a digital asset security that's the SEC's words called XRP, in return for cash or other consideration worth over $1.4 billion to fund Ripple's operations. And this is, I think, important.
00:02:22.154 - 00:03:09.186, Speaker B: And according to the SEC, to personally enrich Larson and Garlinghouse, who later in the lawsuit, the SEC alleges took in about $600 million from their sales. And this is problematic, according to the SEC's complaint, because allegedly, and as discussed in detail, XRP is actually security. And under us. Securities laws, in order to sell a security, you either have to register it or it has to be subject to an exemption. And the SEC says neither of those things were the case. So they sued Ripple for violating the registration requirements of US. Securities laws, and they also sued Garlinghouse and Larson personally, as there are two counts to the complaint.
00:03:09.186 - 00:03:30.510, Speaker B: The first is violation of the registration requirements under the securities act. The second is for aiding and abetting that violation under something called a Control Person Theory, which basically says that people in an organization who have sufficient control over the organization can be personally liable for securities laws violations. That's it in a nutshell.
00:03:31.010 - 00:03:38.290, Speaker A: And, Gabriel, would you like to add to that? What do you think is the significance of the lawsuit and also of the fact that it named two executives?
00:03:39.350 - 00:04:11.982, Speaker C: Yeah, well, I think this is the first time in one of these suits there have been a number of these token actions. This is the first time when the SEC has gone personally after the founders. It didn't do that in the Kick case relating to the Kin cryptocurrency. It didn't do that in the Telegram case. It didn't name the Durov brothers as defendants. So I think that speaks to what they feel is the level of egregiousness of the violations. And I do think it's noteworthy in that regard.
00:04:12.116 - 00:05:14.960, Speaker B: And it's not a fraud case either. So there have been token related cases where individuals are named personally, but those were securities fraud cases. What's really interesting about this is, to use Gabe's words, there's a certain level of egregiousness that's wound through this, but it's not a fraud case. But in order to make a control person claim against people involved in a securities act registration violation, you have to show mean, I think Gabe hits it exactly hits the nail on the head. The SEC, I think, sees the egregiousness that they describe is that these guys, they made $600 million, and there was sort of an information asymmetry, right. They knew things about this asset that people, regular people who are buying consumer buyers wouldn't know. And if this had been registered as a security, you'd have reporting requirements which were not followed here.
00:05:14.960 - 00:05:15.866, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:05:15.908 - 00:05:55.274, Speaker A: And actually, Stephen, you did tweet the Ripple case is the most fraudlike, non fraud filing I think I've seen. And you said it's full of evidence about market manipulation and control, all to the benefit of the issuer and execs and to the potential detriment of the buying public. And then you said, so where I come down is not, will it be delisted and will the thing die? You wrote, Good chance of both, but are there other more serious charges waiting in the so, like, why do you think the SEC didn't just perceive this as a fraud case? And what makes you think that potentially they could still so I'm not suggesting.
00:05:55.322 - 00:07:06.986, Speaker B: That there was fraud here. I think what I pointed to earlier, if you look at the complaint and you see it took me a minute, it took me a few minutes when I read it to understand why they did this. The reason why there are allegations of trading on inside information or information asymmetry or suggestion of willfulness is because that's what you need to do in order to satisfy the proof requirements for a control person claim. And I think the reason why they brought that claim is because if you want to recover money, these guys, according to the SEC, they personally made $600 million. So if you're going to try and claw back money to distribute to smaller investors, you have to go after them because they have the cash, they have nearly half of proceeds, and they're entitled to a presumption that the SEC, the government, has to prove its case. But if all of these allegations are true, this was not about freedom. It was not about changing commerce or liberty.
00:07:06.986 - 00:07:29.034, Speaker B: It was about personal profit for a couple of people who made a huge amount of money. And there's nothing wrong with making a lot of money. I'm not suggesting that there is, but that's I think why the SEC went after these people personally. And I think it might have felt personal to them in part, too, because this was basically filed on Christmas Eve, right? Yeah.
00:07:29.072 - 00:07:39.486, Speaker C: Brad Garlinghouse noted that in his Twitter response right. As like a particularly egregious factor to show how heartless the SEC is.
00:07:39.668 - 00:07:40.910, Speaker A: Merry Christmas.
00:07:41.250 - 00:07:41.758, Speaker B: Right.
00:07:41.844 - 00:08:12.714, Speaker A: Here's your so why do you think that the SEC didn't just pursue fraud know, as you also tweeted, you said that there was a very bad fact. And that fact is that as early as 2012, ripple got advice that XRP could very well be a security and even advice to consult with the SEC about it. And they didn't do that and then instead went on to make $1.38 billion in sales.
00:08:12.832 - 00:09:07.402, Speaker C: Well, fraud is very hard to prove because it requires what's called C enter. The c enter standard. Under securities law, fraud is a little weaker than under common law fraud, but there is still this element of an intention to deceive and there's also a class action securities lawsuit against Ripple going on concurrently with this. And in that fraud, there were a number of fraud causes of action and a couple of them survived the initial motion for dismissal, or at least one. So there was some possibility of bringing a fraud claim, but it's just much harder. And I think the SEC has close to a slam dunk on the registration claims. So why would it muddy the waters by bringing a weaker claim when it doesn't really have to?
00:09:07.456 - 00:10:03.998, Speaker B: Yeah, and it can achieve the same thing by making a control person claim. You still have to prove I think it's clear and convincing evidence. So you still have to prove some. You know, one of the things getting back to the most fraud like non fraud claim according these are all allegations. I just want to remind people who are watching and listening but the SEC alleges that Garlinghouse repeatedly said that he was quote very long XRP, meaning he had significant positions expected to rise in value without disclosing the fact that he was selling. And Gabe can speak more to how this works in the public securities context, but typically there are some restrictions on what you can do in terms of selling securities if you are management and you have inside information. And I think that's where it's about information.
00:10:03.998 - 00:10:06.010, Speaker B: Asymmetry. Go ahead, Gabe.
00:10:06.090 - 00:11:03.806, Speaker C: That's right, yeah. If Ripple Labs was a public company, that is, if it was complying with the Exchange Act. And if XRP was a security, then whenever Brad Garlinghouse sold his own XRP, there would have to be something called a Section 16 B report. Sorry, a Section 16 report filed with the SEC for the entire public to see that reports those transactions. And that's the case whenever, if Tim Cook of Apple sells us Apple stock, he's filing those and so on. And that's a very important piece of disclosure because it puts the market on notice that the executives are selling, which could impact the market or could indicate that they have some extra information that the market doesn't have. Now, in addition to that, they're also blackout periods where they're not allowed to sell.
00:11:03.806 - 00:11:46.862, Speaker C: Right. So they have a limited window to sell when they ought to have the same information as the public, basically, because the company has just recently filed one of its periodic reports, and they have to do the disclosure on top of that. And there are other limits as well. And so all of those protections that a typical investor in a typical security would have, XRP holders were deprived of. And so if XRP is a security, you can see how they really lose out, relatively speaking, by not having this disclosure. Because if they did have the disclosure, they could time their own buys and sells in a more advantageous way.
00:11:46.916 - 00:12:21.478, Speaker B: And let's give a very tangible example of how that might or might not be important. So SEC investigations are confidential. I don't believe that it was publicly disclosed that there was an ongoing investigation. Towards the close of an investigation. You have the ability, in something called a Wells Act response, you have the ability to persuade the SEC in a letter that the SEC will come to you and say, we've finished our investigation. We think we're going to charge you. You can let us know why we shouldn't.
00:12:21.478 - 00:13:08.930, Speaker B: So that all happened behind the scenes. Ripple and the executives knew that was going on at around the time they were drafting their Wells letter. Their response to the SEC XRP went up to, I think, seventy cents in price. So there was a huge spike in price. And then when the information came about the SEC lawsuit so basically, Ripple said the day before the lawsuit was filed, they said they were going to be sued, the price tanked. So they knew for the last two years that they were under investigation. They also knew that they had been told by, I think in two different memos by law firms, that XRP was probably security and the general public did not know about that now if I had bought XRP at 60 or $0.70,
00:13:08.930 - 00:13:15.210, Speaker B: it's trading now at $0.27, which is peculiar to me. I'm not sure why I think I'd be kind of pissed off.
00:13:15.360 - 00:13:16.746, Speaker C: As opposed to zero.
00:13:16.928 - 00:13:17.980, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.
00:13:22.510 - 00:13:56.946, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, speaking about a kind of like asymmetry of information, okay, first of all, people really should read the SEC's lawsuit because yes, I understand it's 70 pages, but you can like skim that. You can kind of figure out which parts you can skip and which parts you can read. So it's not actually 70 pages. But the point is there's just so much in here. It's literally like a 70 page list of all the ways in which Ripple itself kind of like made itself guilty. And yeah, I mean, it's really a doozy, frankly.
00:13:56.946 - 00:14:51.740, Speaker A: But one of the many, many anecdotes that they have in here is one in which Ripple was having conversations with a big market maker and Ripple was freely talking about how it wanted to sell XRP timed to some of Ripple's big announcements. And so Ripple's VP of finance told the market maker and so here I'm going to quote from the SEC lawsuit. Ripple would like to go to sales at 1% of trading volume and ask the market maker to, quote, be thoughtful, opportunistic around the timing of implementing 1% because Ripple did not want to, quote, depress the rally, but rather capitalize on the additional volume. So it's like literally they're literally saying like, we want to make money when the news hits, so be sure to sell when all the retail people are going to be buying on our news. And so there's so many eye opening moments like that.
00:14:52.110 - 00:15:05.614, Speaker B: Also example of paying for listings on yeah, it's hard to see. I mean they have very fine lawyers who are defending them.
00:15:05.732 - 00:15:06.378, Speaker A: Ripple.
00:15:06.474 - 00:15:26.434, Speaker B: Yeah, ripple does. They're represented by really good lawyers who specialize in defending securities lawsuits and enforcement actions and class actions. But I just don't see how you, I don't see how you win. I mean, I guess what is there, Gabe? There's a limitations argument perhaps? What are the arguments that can be made? I know that one of the things.
00:15:26.472 - 00:15:42.954, Speaker C: That they've said I think the arguments they'll have to focus on are things relating to cryptocurrency and the fact that the Howie precedents don't squarely address. I think their arguments will be very policy based.
00:15:43.072 - 00:16:15.022, Speaker B: Yeah, that's right. One of the things they've argued that for example, that XRP is currency and therefore it can't be a security, which is I don't think is accurate. That was an argument that was raised in either the kick or I think that was the same argument was made in the kick case and the judge found that that was not that. I know they argued that they were going to go to the Supreme Court and there would be the Ripple case instead of the Howey case. I think that that's someone's huffing their own supply. It seems unlikely.
00:16:15.166 - 00:16:15.634, Speaker C: I'm sorry.
00:16:15.672 - 00:16:16.366, Speaker B: Go ahead.
00:16:16.488 - 00:16:40.986, Speaker A: All right, well, let's actually just because maybe not all listeners will know how a security is defined, especially if there are new people, because as we all know, crypto is coming up. So let's just talk about how is a security defined in the US. And then if you could walk through how you think or how the SEC makes its case that Ripple's actions with XRP do fit that definition.
00:16:41.178 - 00:16:42.830, Speaker B: Gabe, why don't you take this?
00:16:42.980 - 00:17:43.966, Speaker C: Sure. So, yeah, the term security is actually defined under a few different laws, but aside from very subtle variations, they're mostly the same. So under the securities act of 1933, which is the first major federal securities law, it includes a long list of things such as stock, such as evidences of indebtedness and so on. Among those things is the term investment contract. And investment contract is the one among that list that the SEC and others have most focused on as a theory for how tokens or token transactions or token offerings can constitute securities or securities offerings or securities transactions. And the principal test for whether an investment contract exists is called the Howey test. It's the name of a Supreme Court case involving orange groves.
00:17:43.966 - 00:18:49.130, Speaker C: And the test is quite simple. It basically says that an investment contract is a contract transaction or scheme in which there is an investment of money in a common enterprise with the reasonable expectation of profits from others. So there are essentially four elements, and that test has been further interpreted over time. So, for example, investment of money doesn't just mean giving money. It can also mean other forms of value or benefit that someone contributes to the issuer. So essentially what the SEC is saying is Ripple created this in effect, or in any event, they had a lot of it, they were selling it, and when people were buying it, they were buying it because this company, Ripple, exists. The company was saying, hey, we have all these great products that we're going to put in place with banks through commercial deals and those products are going to use XRP, the cryptocurrency and that blockchain.
00:18:49.130 - 00:20:00.226, Speaker C: And as a result of that, there's going to be a lot of demand for XRP and therefore the price will go up because this will essentially become the new de facto universal interbank settlement method. Which is a great thesis. But the problem with that thesis is that without Ripple there to supply these other technologies and do the deals with the banks, that XRP wouldn't have that value proposition and probably a lot less people would buy it and they would spend a lot less money on it. And so that's the basic thesis of the SEC's arguments. In addition to that, the SEC didn't really get into this heavily in the complaint, although it's hinted at. Shortly before the lawsuit was filed, there was a report from several computer scientists at the University of Byrne, where they basically analyze that the Blockchain itself, the technology is centralized because although Ripple Labs claims that its list of trusted nodes is just sort of optional. It turns out if you don't follow exactly that list, the blockchain just wouldn't be secure.
00:20:00.226 - 00:20:07.920, Speaker C: Or it wouldn't be live. And so it's also centralized in that way. And that's another distinction. Know, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, and.
00:20:09.730 - 00:20:10.046, Speaker B: You.
00:20:10.068 - 00:20:48.380, Speaker A: Know, the SEC really hammers home that Ripple was the one that was responsible for whether or not XRP was successful and that they themselves kind of made that case for the SEC. I mean, there's just so many choice quotes here. What are some of the good? And not only that, but like Ripple keeps talking about how they have this asset, but then after having the asset, then they try to develop a use for it, which again, it's like that's if it were the tail whacking the dog. Yeah, exactly.
00:20:49.230 - 00:21:29.974, Speaker B: The problem with Twitter, I say this is a litigator, it's a benefit if you handle disputes, is that it's like it's such easy evidence. Everything is there. So paragraph 47 of the complaint, the SEC says this cryptographer number one, who I believe actually somebody it's Schwartz. I actually think he made his yeah, David Schwartz. David Schwartz actually changed his Twitter handle to cryptographer number one. As cryptographer number one. We're well respected and known ripple spokesperson stated in a recent tweet on Twitter, quote, the people who created XRP are pretty much the same as the people who created Ripple.
00:21:29.974 - 00:22:18.642, Speaker B: And they created Ripple originally to, among other things, distribute XRP. You have to back up for a second to think about how this is going to be resolved. Just imagine a federal judge who's got a big docket and handles all kinds of cases, criminal and civil commercial disputes, whatever. This is not a person who's like deep in the weeds in crypto, the universe closes. It becomes more narrow when you're in litigation. I think if you read that, if that proves to be true, it's very difficult to take statements like that. And that statement is probably, there's an evidentiary theory basically that statement is probably attributable to Ripple as what's known as a party opponent statement.
00:22:18.642 - 00:23:06.214, Speaker B: In other words, it probably can be said that that statement made by the SEC will argue that that statement made by somebody very high up in Ripple is attributable to them. So if that's a statement that Ripple made, statement after statement like that from being read by a federal judge, it makes it very hard to see how this wasn't something other than a centralized money making proposition. Now being a centralized money making proposition doesn't make you a security necessarily, it doesn't make you an investment contract necessarily, but it becomes evidence of that. It's sort of indicia of that because you have to look through this and ask what was the purpose of this thing other than to be a speculative asset. It doesn't really add up.
00:23:06.412 - 00:23:49.538, Speaker A: Yeah, there's a number of these choice quotes. I'm not going to list them all, but there was another one. Again, it's Cryptographer one who explained an XRP chat in response to the question, if Ripple failed, would XRP die? And he said that he didn't, quote, think it's likely XRP would succeed without us, though. It's yeah, and there's just so one thing then I also wanted to break down is so we did talk a little bit about the cases against Chris Larson and Brad Garlinghouse, but in this case, what do you think of the SEC's evidence and how likely is it that they'll be held responsible in some way as well?
00:23:49.624 - 00:24:00.810, Speaker B: So this is a prediction, and I guess I could be wrong. I have to hedge because I'm a lawyer. Ripple's going to lose. Garlinghouse and Larson are going to lose. They'll monkey around. They'll file motions to dismiss. They'll be denied.
00:24:00.810 - 00:24:55.690, Speaker B: They probably do some discovery. Maybe they take some depositions. Presumably in the enforcement action, they took depositions. So that depositions for people not familiar with the way litigation works in the United States, those are statements under oath, the examinations of witnesses, and they will probably file cross motions for summary judgment. And they're going to lose unless there is a limitations argument or unless the judge must they get a sympathetic judge who reads through this and is convinced that this was not an ongoing securities offering. They lose, and they probably settle. Now, obviously, if I had inside information about the litigation, I wouldn't be talking to you, but it seems like a reasonable way for this to be resolved is I don't know, they got 600 million, so maybe they pay 550 to the government.
00:24:55.690 - 00:25:25.614, Speaker B: They keep 50, and something called a fair fund is set up and people can basically get reimbursed for the cost of their XRP. It sounds like they were talking settlement. You can kind of see that. I think they actually talked about that publicly on Twitter. I think the case ultimately has to be settled. I don't see it going up to the Supreme Court. If they take it up to the 9th Circuit, they probably lose.
00:25:25.614 - 00:25:50.006, Speaker B: I don't see the Supreme Court taking cert on this, because think about it, too. Like, does anybody really care about these guys who made $600 million selling this digital asset? It's not like if I were going to take a case to change the law and to change how we look at digital assets, this isn't the one that I would take, because they're not sympathetic. Now, we haven't seen their answer, their motion to dismiss.
00:25:50.038 - 00:25:51.478, Speaker C: But what about the remedy?
00:25:51.574 - 00:25:52.570, Speaker B: Yeah, go ahead, Gabe.
00:25:52.650 - 00:26:40.670, Speaker C: What about the remedy, though, Steven? I mean, what about the interests of the XRP holders? I do wonder about this and sort of worry about, you know, who's a former SEC that's right. Who's a former SEC commissioner himself. And now teaches a lot at Stanford, has talked a lot about token stuff and is no pro token guy. You can find his videos on YouTube at one point arguing that Bitcoin is a security, which is the one thing that everyone now agrees is not a security. He wrote a letter to the know. Now he's an advisor, advisor to Ripple, but he's a credible guy, he doesn't just do things. And he expressed a concern like, well this is really harming XRP holders who are supposedly the victims in all this.
00:26:40.670 - 00:27:06.230, Speaker C: And so part of me does wonder is a satisfactory remedy here to just destroy all of this and compensate people? How could you ever compensate people? So many people have bought and sold this and many won't want to KYC themselves. So personally, what I would think is a much more reasonable remedy is that Ripple becomes an Exchange Act reporter.
00:27:07.370 - 00:27:08.438, Speaker A: An exchange what?
00:27:08.524 - 00:27:09.286, Speaker B: An exchange act.
00:27:09.308 - 00:27:20.678, Speaker C: Reporter Basically an SEC reporting company. An SEC reporting company like Apple or like any other public company. And then XRP holders would get the disclosure that investors where would you be.
00:27:20.684 - 00:27:22.710, Speaker B: Able to right, so if that happened.
00:27:22.860 - 00:27:24.490, Speaker A: But then I think that kills.
00:27:26.270 - 00:27:30.346, Speaker C: Might still but they might be able to find ways to generate value for it.
00:27:30.368 - 00:27:41.866, Speaker B: But it kills the utility of it also. Where would you trade it? I know that Coinbase has a they've got a broker dealer, but I don't think they've been given the green light to use it. None of the exchanges or broker dealers.
00:27:41.898 - 00:28:17.174, Speaker C: Are these things are going to emerge, right? These things are going to emerge. I mean, I think it's inevitable that many of these tokens will be securities, right? So this issue has to happen. It has to be faced at some point anyway. Right, you're right. There will be challenges to keeping it valuable or maybe finding some new utility for it as a potential security, but is completely destroying it for sure, really better than giving it some fighting chance. I mean, most of the XRP holders, you see them on Twitter, they're actually not mad. I mean they have every right to be mad, but the only thing they're mad at is the SEC and they see Ripple as the victim.
00:28:17.174 - 00:28:25.438, Speaker C: So they clearly want this to go on. So maybe let it go on and just make Ripple Labs an Exchange Act reporting company. Would that really be so bad? I don't know.
00:28:25.524 - 00:29:08.186, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I think the SEC really makes a strong case that Ripple didn't really have much by way of revenue except from selling XRP and so their big cash cow would be killed. And so I have a feeling Ripple wouldn't be super excited about making XRP a security because then it's like, then they cut off their big flow of cash that has been coming their way. $1.38 billion worth. But one other thing actually before we go to a break that I just want to ask quickly, Steven, when you said you thought what was most likely is that they would have to discourage 550,000,000 and they keep 50 million. Why would they even keep 50 million? That's a huge well, I don't know.
00:29:08.208 - 00:29:31.826, Speaker B: If that's likely or not. What I'm thinking is, if I were the defendants, in the end, if you are pushed to settle so fine, maybe once you have that much money, $50 million doesn't seem like very much. But if there's a way I know of other cases where people disgorged a significant amount but were also able to keep a significant amount.
00:29:32.008 - 00:30:03.782, Speaker C: Keep in mind, as know, Ripple's fighting a multi front battle. Yeah, that's right. Because it has the class action, it has this case against the SEC and now it's equity investors doing it, arguing that Ripple is required to redeem their stock. Now at the investment the and it probably has creditors, it probably has commercial partners, it has employees right there at, you know, there are going to be a lot of people with their hands out here and most likely this will be a total disaster.
00:30:03.846 - 00:30:10.174, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't know, maybe we should explain what that lawsuit is by their investors. Gabe, do you want to talk about that?
00:30:10.212 - 00:30:50.700, Speaker A: Well, let's do that right after this break.

They were the lead investor in Ripple's most recent fundraising round. So what is going on there?
00:31:35.470 - 00:32:20.950, Speaker C: Yeah, so there's not a lot of detail because the complaint has been filed confidentially in the Delaware Court of Chancellory, which is the biggest corporate law court in the world, the most prestigious, the best, all those things, because Ripple Labs is a Delaware corporation. But what one can infer from the press reports is that Ripple. Has in its certificate of incorporation and other investment documents from its last preferred stock financing a provision that says that if XRP says something like if XRP is found to be a security, then Ripple is required to redeem the preferred stock at presumably its original investment amount or something very close.
00:32:21.020 - 00:32:46.114, Speaker B: Basically they got to pay the money back that their investors gave them. Exactly. And what Ripple said was, well there hasn't actually been a finding that XRP is a security and we don't have the investment docs, we don't know what they say, but that's what they're fighting about. And to Gabe's point, there are probably other people out there too. I mean it's interesting. I don't know how typical is a covenant like that in financing documents. Gabe, I guess you'd only have that.
00:32:46.312 - 00:32:57.650, Speaker C: Well, redemption provisions are common but not tied to some regulatory finding and it shows that everyone knew for a long time that this is a real tangible risk.
00:32:58.070 - 00:33:18.810, Speaker A: I know even just knowing that that clause was in there, I was like, if I were an investor and I was about to sign a contract with this clause in it, I would be like ding ding ding, maybe I shouldn't sign this contract, maybe this is not a good investment to make. That was just my opinion. But maybe I would be a very conservative well, I was going to say that investor, but maybe I'd actually be a good investor.
00:33:19.630 - 00:33:23.566, Speaker B: People wanted big returns and they were.
00:33:23.588 - 00:33:44.530, Speaker C: Willing to it's actually the opposite. I mean, if you can get that deal and you know, it's Ripple. Ripple has a lot of money. Ripple had a lot of money back then. It's going to keep selling these things. It's almost like a risk free investment. So far from being a red flag, I bet the investors were more like going kuching.
00:33:44.530 - 00:33:49.262, Speaker C: Heads we win, tails they lose. You know what I mean?
00:33:49.416 - 00:34:39.942, Speaker A: Yeah, I see. Yeah, that is true. But it is kind of funny everybody seemed to well so just while we're also talking know kind of like other entities that are affected by this I was just curious because as you're reading through the lawsuit the SEC just keeps mentioning all these other entities. And I mentioned earlier this market maker that they were emailing about the timing of the selling to time it to announcements so they could make the most money from those announcements. But I was just wondering, do you think would any of these other actors that are named in it be affected in any way? Like, would the SEC, I don't know, go after them or I'm not sure how this works, but could it affect any of them or any of the exchanges that are now delisting XRP or anything?
00:34:39.996 - 00:36:13.300, Speaker C: Like you know, just to your last point, one interesting factor here is that Know just filed for its IPO a week or two before this XRP lawsuit, and one wonders a little bit about the timing of the lawsuit in light of that. And Coinbase has suspended XRP from trading, but the SEC has a lot of leverage over a company that is looking to IPO, because in order for a company to IPO, the SEC has to approve its S one, also called its registration statement that registers the shares. The SEC has very broad discretion in the reasons why it can deny that approval. And so the SEC can use that process as leverage against Coinbase, either to get Coinbase to atone for its past sins or to have tighter controls that it won't repeat them. And so obviously, if XRP is found to be a security, that'll make it even easier for the SEC to do that. On the other hand, in all these past cases, like the Telegram case, for example, was really all about underwriting concerns that the investors were acting as underwriters and none of those investors were registered as underwriters, and yet doesn't seem like the SEC is going after any of the investors under, underwriting theories. So what they do tend to do is they tend to rack up a win and once they've won, they tend to move on to other things.
00:36:13.300 - 00:36:31.958, Speaker C: One might call that unfair in some ways, and perhaps it's not even a smart enforcement strategy, because if the money is sort know, never suffering the consequences, it'll just keep flowing into the same types of schemes. But in the past, they haven't really gone after these ancillary players.
00:36:32.134 - 00:37:28.650, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, there is that lawsuit against Coinbase, although I did see Stephen, you tweeted that you didn't think it was serious or well done. But it is true that there are a lot of companies that made money off of trading XRP. Even as I would say, some huge percentage of people in the industry thought XRP was a security. We've thought that for years. I remember when I first learned about the Howie test, as I really learned about it, I kept thinking, if all these things are what makes a security, then how is XRP not a security? And there have been like a ton of articles people have written about this forever. So given that most people were of that, like, do you think that the SEC is just going to be like, oh, well, it's just too much to go after? All these people that were making money off of what they knew was know, just going to be a short, fun, free ride?
00:37:29.310 - 00:38:17.660, Speaker B: I can't speak to who else the SEC might or might not go after, but I think as far as I know, there's only one exchange in the United States where XRP can still be bought and sold. I guess I'd be surprised if they went after exchanges. So the issue is, if something is a security, you need to either be registered as a broker dealer, you need to be a national exchange, or you have to have appropriate registration, and none of these exchanges did. And presumably, I mean, I know that some companies looked at the lawsuit and just immediately said no and delisted, but others may have been in touch with the SEC. I'd be surprised if there were follow on enforcement actions by the SEC against exchanges. I don't know. Gabe, what do you think?
00:38:18.670 - 00:38:28.080, Speaker C: Other than maybe this Coinbase thing where it'd be very easy for them to do something because Coinbase is at their mercy for the IPO? Yeah, I agree.
00:38:29.090 - 00:38:54.674, Speaker A: Yeah. I think what was interesting to me was that Coinbase is suspending trading in XRP the day that this episode comes out, tuesday, January 19. And so I actually thought because their reputation is of, or it used to be at least of being kind of the conservative exchange and very regulatorily compliant, and because of the fact that it's going public, I would have thought that they would have delisted much sooner. So, yeah, I found that a little curious.
00:38:54.802 - 00:39:11.498, Speaker B: It's complicated because you have to give people time to get their assets off the exchange. I don't know if they're still doing buy sell, but if they are, maybe you have to give people the opportunity. Did they shut off the money?
00:39:11.584 - 00:39:15.534, Speaker A: So Tuesday is when that it seems.
00:39:15.572 - 00:39:51.514, Speaker B: Like you have to balance between you've got to balance between skill and cheribatus, basically. You're sort of damned if you do, damned if you don't. But I think it's fair and reasonable to give retail consumers the ability to cash out or move their stuff, and maybe somebody hasn't logged in for a while. They don't check their email right away. There are plenty of people who don't check this on a daily basis. Having a couple of weeks to give people the opportunity to move their assets off of the exchange I think, makes sense. I'm not mean, I don't know that the SEC would be too upset about that.
00:39:51.712 - 00:40:04.650, Speaker A: So one thing that I want to go back to is we talked at a few points about Ripple's Wells submission. So can one of you describe what Ripple's arguments were in the Wells submission?
00:40:05.070 - 00:40:53.338, Speaker B: I think one argument was and to be at, I actually haven't looked at the Wells submission in a little while, but one was the argument that Kick made, which was that it's currency and therefore can't be a security. They also argued that they'd been selling it for a long time and the SEC had never complained. And there's almost like sort of a regulatory estoppel argument. But the parallel argument to that is, look, I've been going into the like, I've been robing the bank every day. I've been ripping off this ATM every day for the last five years, and the police car drives by and they never say anything. I'm not sure that that's a terribly it's not a really persuasive argument. There is a theory in law called regulatory estoppel by which you can I.
00:40:53.344 - 00:40:54.540, Speaker A: Don'T even know what that means.
00:40:54.910 - 00:41:27.894, Speaker B: Estoppel. It's an equitable theory. It's basically the notion that you can prevent someone from taking a position because you relied on them doing something else or saying something else. It's nearly impossible to make that argument in the United States. That because a regulator did or didn't do something and you relied on them, that they're basically stopped or prevented from taking action going forward. There was nothing in their letter that I was terribly persuaded by, but it's been a while since I've read it.
00:41:27.932 - 00:41:33.146, Speaker C: And I don't know that the full letter was actually published. I think they published that's right, they.
00:41:33.168 - 00:41:35.180, Speaker B: Published an outline summary. That's correct.
00:41:36.110 - 00:41:59.826, Speaker C: Yeah. And there were a lot of I'm just refreshing my memory now. A lot of it was about how useful XRP is without Ripple and stuff, which is just not true. Right. Because, again, Ripple pays almost every node on its trusted list. They're almost all paid by Ripple. They're a bunch of universities, ripple commercial partners, companies that Ripple have invested in.
00:41:59.826 - 00:42:13.160, Speaker C: There's only one that claims to be independent. Right. And so I think if Ripple goes away, I just don't know how even the technology itself would safely function.
00:42:13.690 - 00:42:33.354, Speaker A: Going back to the well submission, the one part of the summary that I saw some people tweeting about, and that really struck me as a really bad argument, frankly, was that if the SEC finds XRP to be a security, then, quote, innovation in the cryptocurrency industry will be fully seeded to China.
00:42:33.482 - 00:42:35.520, Speaker B: I mean, yes, I remember that.
00:42:35.890 - 00:42:56.280, Speaker A: That's a crazy argument, but let me finish. The Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains are highly susceptible to Chinese control because both are subject to simple majority mean. I'm not sure.
00:42:59.450 - 00:43:04.818, Speaker C: Especially considering the caliber of lawyers they have, it's shocking that that would be their argument.
00:43:04.914 - 00:43:21.020, Speaker A: Yeah, and especially because the SEC has already deemed that Bitcoin and Ether are not securities. So to rely on that, it just was like, okay, if you're going to try and make a good attempt here, why did you go down this path? But anyway, okay.
00:43:23.550 - 00:43:48.454, Speaker B: There'S a saying that the lawyers have, which you've probably heard. When the facts aren't on your side, you pound on the law. When the law is not on your side, you pound on the facts. When neither the law nor the facts are on your side, you pound on the table. So that's basically what they're doing here. The law and the facts are bad. And the best lawyers in the world, people have a mistaken understanding of what lawyers can do.
00:43:48.454 - 00:44:27.522, Speaker B: Gabe and I are both very good, I would say among the best. But if you're caught on video robbing a liquor store, I can argue that you had a troubled childhood. I actually had a case that reminds me, when I was in law school, I clerked for the public defender. This was a PD case, and we actually had a client who was, in fact, caught on video robbing a liquor store, and he wanted to go to trial. And we were like, but the video shows you that's you he's like, It's not me. It's like, it's you. So it's kind of like so we tried that case and he lost, but he got to be out of jail for a couple of days.
00:44:27.522 - 00:44:30.658, Speaker B: So it's kind of like sometimes people.
00:44:30.744 - 00:44:33.826, Speaker A: There'S an epidemic of this type of behavior in our society right now.
00:44:33.848 - 00:45:13.246, Speaker B: I feel actually, I think that they may believe this. Right? I think they may have like, oh, wait, Ripple. Yeah, no, I think that Ripple and Mr. Garlinghouse, they believe that China will control I think they believe that they have created some sort of revolutionary technology. I think they probably believe at this point that it's not a security and that they're being unfairly targeted and the law should change. I think that they actually probably believe this. It's preposterous, but if you tell yourself a story for long enough, sometimes you believe it.
00:45:13.246 - 00:45:15.002, Speaker B: I'm just a simple country lawyer that's.
00:45:15.066 - 00:45:50.394, Speaker A: Yeah, no, there definitely was a lot of cognitive dissonance in the SEC's lawsuit. Like I said, it's literally just quote after quote. It's a pretty damning document. But it's very interesting because even while Brad was saying things like, oh, I'm extremely long XRP, I mean, he was selling it, but not disclosing it and making tons of money off of retail investors. So I don't know him personally. I've never met him. But for him to keep saying that he's extremely long XRP, meanwhile, he's doing all these sales behind people's back.
00:45:50.394 - 00:46:02.574, Speaker A: I mean, it's a little bit like, okay, either you just sort of lived with that cognitive dissonance and didn't recognize it as such, or I'm not going to speculate what was going on in his head, but I think I would.
00:46:02.612 - 00:46:39.626, Speaker B: Also say so just to be devil's advocate here, somebody else pointed this out. I can't remember who I was talking to, but one of the allegations is that, okay, one of the things that the SEC puts out there as being problematic is that Ripple was paying people to use XRP. And it is true that is not an unusual Silicon Valley play to get adoption. PayPal did that. I think Stripe did that. So paying people to use your product or use your service is something that other companies have done. So maybe that's something that we'll hear them come back with.
00:46:39.626 - 00:46:42.240, Speaker B: So, for example, in paragraph 123.
00:46:44.530 - 00:46:54.922, Speaker A: But to use PayPal or to use Stripe or whatever doing that isn't engaging in some kind of unregistered securities offering.
00:46:54.986 - 00:47:05.780, Speaker B: No, it's not. Right? I can't remember what it was, but I think when PayPal first came into use, I think people were paid was it $5?
00:47:06.390 - 00:47:53.922, Speaker A: I think it was $10 if they got a friend to sign up. Yeah. So we did also reference a little bit some of the other big SEC enforcement actions in the cryptocurrency industry. I think the ones probably that are most relevant for this case are Kickkin as we mentioned, maybe EOS simply because that was one that a lot of people thought it was pretty egregious because it was a year long ICO. I think they claimed to block US investors but then they had that big advertisement in Times Square and then of course Telegram. So when you look at like if you were to read the tea leaves, how do you think, I mean, I know Steven, you want to give your opinion but just in that like this.
00:47:53.976 - 00:48:28.494, Speaker B: Is more like Kick or Telegram. Oh it so like with EOS, whatever you think about the technology or the company or the folks involved, they settled and also according to the, I think it's the consent agreement, the consent order, they really actually did try and block US persons. I know they had that fine in Times Square, it was stupid, but they did do some form of geo blocking. They did actually try and block people in the US. They paid $24 million and they settled and they took the other difference is.
00:48:28.532 - 00:48:56.502, Speaker A: That Kick and Telegram were companies that existed before they tried to do this token and Ripple in a way. So Ripple was actually how does it go? It was a little bit different where the company was incorporated after, but it's similar in that the company was just so closely associated with the cryptocurrency and obviously they have, what is it, 55%.
00:48:56.556 - 00:49:46.710, Speaker B: Of I mean Kick had a social media app, right? Telegram is used by 500 million people to communicate. I mean they are real enterprises that have real users that do real things. And here I'm sure Ripple would say, look, we have enterprise software that's used by all sorts of banks, I'm not sure how much traction they're going to get. It does seem like at least if you read this complaint, the principal purpose of the company was to get people to buy and sell XRP and to create market value and create liquidity and that was not the principal purpose of Telegram or of Kick. They didn't come into existence to sell a cryptocurrency.
00:49:47.130 - 00:49:56.154, Speaker A: Right. So Stephen, you did talk about how you think this case will go. Gabriel, do you have any thoughts on what you think will happen?
00:49:56.192 - 00:51:08.226, Speaker C: I basically agree with mean I think Ripple will bit I would say I'm less certain that know that the founders will end up having personal liability. We'll have to see about that. But certainly Ripple will lose in my mind and I'm more just curious about what the remedy will end up being because in the case of Kick and right, they lost. But really now Kin is still out there and actually Kin holders were very happy with the outcome, right. No one was forced to become an SEC reporting know, they had to pay a fine, right, but they were left with some money like Steven was talking, you know, it's gone up. It's actually gone up since the know, it's gone up in price since the lawsuit end because it no longer has this cloud hanging over it that worried that Kin itself is a security for Telegram. On the other hand, it was completely disastrous, right? I mean, Telegram has, as Stephen was saying, it has a real app and so it'll be fine and it has money, but it had to give all the investment back.
00:51:08.226 - 00:51:52.446, Speaker C: Now it's raising a debt financing round and all of the value and time and opportunity costs that it put into this technology was a complete loss. They were just enjoined from doing it flat out. And so that's a huge loss. That's like a total wipeout of that part of their business history. And then with block one, it's kind of interesting, right? They're a little bit of a combination. They had much better lawyers, I will say much better deal lawyers, because the way they documented their thing just gave them much stronger arguments that they were producing software, that they walked away from it once it was done. And EOS is kind of a self sustaining thing.
00:51:52.446 - 00:52:50.018, Speaker C: You could say it's a bad blockchain because it has collusion and all that stuff, but it's not block one doing the collusion. If anything, you could morally fault block one because it's just not doing anything to increase the value of that ecosystem or not doing that much. So they're all very different. And I think the real thing that they all have in common is that a lot of ordinary people bought the token hoping to get rich in circumstances where they don't have all the information and where they're highly dependent and vulnerable upon other people who also are trying to get rich off of it but in a different asymmetrical way. And that's what all these things have in common, despite the apparent differences. And that's why the Howie test is kind of a genius test because it's very functionalistic and it's designed to capture this dynamic where people are vulnerable with their money and investment expectations in a particular way and they all have that in common.
00:52:50.104 - 00:53:21.180, Speaker B: And that again, I mean, going back to what we said at the beginning, that information asymmetry is one of the principal reasons for our securities laws to make sure that investors are, if not on parity or equal terms with insiders. They have a guarantee of some quality information so that they're not taken advantage of. And you can tell that that's one of the principal purposes or one of the principal themes in this lawsuit by the SEC.
00:53:21.550 - 00:54:08.902, Speaker A: Yeah, and they really make that case that the insiders knew certain things and were making money off of the fact that the people they were selling to didn't know those things. So Gabriel, something that interested me about what you just said is that you thought that there was a chance that XRP survives and then that would be good for XRP holders. And I did see, for instance, Japan's Financial Authority, I think, said that XRP is not a security. So I did wonder what happens in that case if the does. So either one, either that, like you said, somehow something happens to Ripple but XRP survives, or if the US just determines that XRP is a security, but other countries make a judgment, like different judgment, how would that affect XRP?
00:54:09.046 - 00:55:15.146, Speaker C: Well, in the second set of facts you mentioned, I mean, I'm just speculating, but you know, people are pretty creative, right? Especially if they have a fair amount of money or the ability to get more money. And certainly Ripple has a lot of fans. One thing they could do is just try to it's already, in my opinion, a centralized chain. They could just add KYC to, you know, and they could just really try hard to exclude US persons, get cozy with some other regulator that says it's not a security, and keep trying to do their thing with the US. Just almost totally blacked out. That's a possibility, I suppose, if they have enough money left over and so on. Another thing that maybe they could do, although I agree that this probably might be even more challenging, is to embrace that XRP is a security, or embrace that certain transactions in XRP are securities and to kind of keep doing their thing, maybe find some alternative uses for XRP that don't involve banks.
00:55:15.146 - 00:55:58.878, Speaker C: Because banks aren't going to want to settle all their ordinary transfers in a security. But maybe they could come up with some stuff. I mean, tokens people are good at coming up with ideas of stuff to do with tokens that sound good to people and maybe they can become an Exchange Act reporter and they could just openly put forth efforts to drive value to this token. Right. One of the ongoing metaphysical issues, right. And I've had debates with another lawyer named Lewis Cohen about this is what is the security, right? Is it this token? Is it always a security or is it only certain transactions in it which are a security and so on. And the SEC's complaint fudges that a little bit.
00:55:58.878 - 00:56:44.400, Speaker C: It does call XRP a security, but on the other hand, it's really talking about these times when Ripple or Garlinghouse sold it. Right. And so it's possible that a judge could craft a remedy that says, well, this is a security, or transactions in it are securities in certain circumstances and not others. And Ripple, you become an Exchange Act reporter, so everyone has the information and when you sell it, it's a securities transaction, but when it's in the secondary market, something like that is possible. So we have to see I'd be interested to see what the remedy ends up being, because the judge ought to care about the XRP holders, in my opinion. Right, and he ought to try to do the least harm to them possible.
00:56:44.770 - 00:56:52.190, Speaker B: So the question there is who is going to make I guess the people who will make that argument will be Ripple's lawyers.
00:56:53.090 - 00:56:54.394, Speaker C: Yeah. At the remedy stage.
00:56:54.442 - 00:57:09.240, Speaker B: At the remedy stage. But I mean obviously out of self interest in minimizing harm to their own. So the SEC will response will be, yeah, right, you don't care about just you're arguing out of self interest. But yeah, no, I think that's a fair point.
00:57:09.770 - 00:57:18.474, Speaker A: Interesting. Yeah. It strikes me as like incredibly complicated to say, oh, it's a security in certain transactions but not in others.
00:57:18.592 - 00:57:20.170, Speaker C: It's incredibly complicated.
00:57:21.790 - 00:57:29.334, Speaker A: Is there another digital or any other asset that for certain transactions there are other tokens?
00:57:29.382 - 00:57:55.810, Speaker C: I mean this flavor of thing is something that's been embraced by some securities lawyers and to a certain extent by the SEC itself. This more functionalistic interpretation where a given thing can be a security and not other. I talked about Grunfest earlier. I would take him to be sort of the leading proponent of this in the way that he talks about tokens that certain transactions and bitcoin isn't.
00:57:55.890 - 00:58:01.906, Speaker B: The argument is that we have to parse security and say we're talking about an investment contract.
00:58:02.098 - 00:59:08.294, Speaker C: Well, that's Lewis's thing. But there is an example, right, because one token, the stacks token from Blockstack, they did an actual reggae plus offering for their token and that means that they qualified it as a securities offering. And the SEC asked them a lot of questions as part of that. One of the questions they asked, for example, is well, does the fact that you're holding a bunch of stacks tokens that you're later going to sell, does that mean you're an investment company or something like that? Or does the fact that some of the tokens are being burned at the same time as you're selling them, does that mean you're buying and selling your own securities at the same time? Which can be a violation of regulations. And they made a lot of nuanced arguments that are very functionalistic about well, when it's here, when we hold it in this circumstance, it's not a security. When it's being burned, that's not a securities transaction. For this other reason, even though the Issuance is being treated as a securities transaction personally.
00:59:08.294 - 00:59:28.226, Speaker C: Although yes, it's complex and nuanced. I actually think that type of thing makes a heck of a lot of know because sometimes the securities laws just aren't implicated in a particular transaction and you don't need to be so essentialist and literal about it.
00:59:28.328 - 01:00:30.600, Speaker B: But we'll I mean and I think the argument that I think you were going to say that Lewis makes is that and this is Lewis Cohen, who is a very fine securities lawyer in New York, practices a firm called DLX Law. The argument is in order for these tokens to fall within the definition of security, we have to consider whether or not they are part of an investment contract. And I think he would distinguish between the transaction, which involves a contract, and the asset itself. So he would say, sure, when Ripple buys and sells it, it is part of an investment. That transaction is an investment contract that covers this asset, but the asset itself is not an investment contract, so therefore it's not a security. Whether or not a judge buys that argument, there may be something to that that from the standpoint of kind of getting a good result for retail investors, you can see that argument having some.
01:00:32.170 - 01:01:15.406, Speaker C: I mean, I think where I disagree with Lewis, though, right, is that when the retail investors are buying it, that's the time it's most like a you know, he thinks that's when it's least like a security. But for example, if banks were trading it amongst right. As a form of mean, the reason why they're doing it is actually not why the banks would be trading. There's no security to invest in it. And so maybe you could treat the retail ones as a securities transaction, make Ripple Labs a securities reporter, but when the banks are trading it, that's not a securities transaction because they're just using it as like a monetary know it probably won't go there. But I'm just saying that if someone were inclined to be creative and fashion, they're doctrinally coherent possibilities.
01:01:15.598 - 01:01:49.520, Speaker A: Yeah, even just listening to that right now, I'm a little bit like implementing that is going to be such a headache. I can't imagine somebody actually this is what should happen. It's like way too complicated. All right, well, so we've covered a lot of things here, but I guess just to sum up, both of you think what's most likely to happen is there's going to be some kind of settlement and ripple, and the executives will discourage, but maybe not everything, because there are other sharks circling the waters and they need to be paid to. Is that kind of what you think is most likely to happen?
01:01:49.890 - 01:02:12.674, Speaker B: I think they monkey around with this litigation for a year. Maybe they have some motion practice. I think Ripple and I actually agree with the the securities act violation is strict liability. There's no center requirement. If it's security, you have to register. It has to be exempt. There is an intent requirement for Garlinghouse and Larson for the Control Act claim.
01:02:12.674 - 01:02:22.506, Speaker B: So those are harder to prove. I think it's more likely than not they lose on motion practice there too, just based on this very detailed complaint. And then maybe it goes up to.
01:02:22.528 - 01:02:27.194, Speaker A: The 9th Circuit, meaning Chris and Brad lose to SEC.
01:02:27.392 - 01:02:51.230, Speaker B: I think so. It may go up to the 9th Circuit, but it settles at some point. I doubt that the Supreme Court takes it on Cert, so it's just a matter of time and expense and these things like the litigation cost to get through a year of litigation and complex discovery and motion practice. Five. To $10 million probably is a good estimate.
01:02:51.310 - 01:03:45.042, Speaker A: Okay, so then, last question before we say goodbye on this super fascinating case is XRB has been around like the third or fourth largest cryptocurrency for quite a long time, and it's quite well known, especially when there's a bubble. I think a lot of us in the industry hear from people outside the crypto world, like, what about XRP? So obviously this case is going to have huge implications, as big as EOS or Kick or Telegram were they're just not anywhere near the level of something like XRP because of where XRP has been in the crypto rankings for such a long time. So once this case is decided, however it's decided, what do you think the implications are for the wider crypto world? What ripple effects do you think it will have?
01:03:45.176 - 01:03:46.260, Speaker B: Go ahead. Good.
01:03:46.870 - 01:05:10.862, Speaker C: Fair enough. It's a tough question. I think that's why I think it's very hard to say. I mean, in many ways, the way it has worked so far, this is what I'll say, is that every time one of these cases gets decided, everyone in the ecosystem seems to very quickly become confident that the distinctions between their circumstances and the decided circumstance are just very different and the case means nothing to them. I struggle with this a lot as a transactional lawyer, because part of my job in negotiating some of these deals is convincing people to do certain things in order to have a better regulatory treatment of a token. And I will do something like point to the Telegram case, and what I found is that in many cases, some of the people around the table are just very convinced that it is completely different and that it has no implications to the current circumstance. And I just think the power of the industry to engage in self denial and also to engage in proactive things, what some call decentralization theater, or these maneuverings to try to make each new circumstance look as different as possible from the last, it's just part of the culture at this point.
01:05:10.862 - 01:05:22.980, Speaker C: And so I don't think it will immediately have some big dramatic effect that changes a lot of people's behavior. I think there would have to be a lot more blood in the water before something like that happens.
01:05:23.590 - 01:05:58.666, Speaker B: I kind of tend to agree. I mean, I find the same thing. Somebody will propose something and we'll point out Telegram and Kick and they'll tell us all the reasons why it's different. And unfortunately, there are lawyers out there who will give people the advice, give people the opinions that they want to hear that perpetuates this sometimes. One of the really interesting things actually, about this complaint, one of the most interesting things to me is that it cites the opinions that the lawyers gave back in the day. I'm really curious how they got that. Yeah, I tend to agree with Gabe.
01:05:58.666 - 01:06:17.250, Speaker B: I don't think it will be. It's just another case we've seen over and over again. The law is pretty clear. And this is another case where I think the conclusion is somewhat inevitable, and I think people will continue to believe what they want to believe at their own peril.
01:06:17.990 - 01:06:36.630, Speaker A: Yeah, actually, just ask one last question about what you were saying about how did they get that information about the opinions given by the lawyers back in Ein Hall, the way in 2012, you were saying that they've been under investigation for two years. So I'm assuming is that where most of the information came from in the lawsuit?
01:06:36.790 - 01:07:08.598, Speaker B: But legal opinions that lawyers provide are confidential and privileged, and they would not typically be something that you have to disclose. Now, it could be that they relied on an advice of counsel defense, which seems silly given the fact that this advice was contrary to what they ended up doing. But unless there was a waiver of some kind, or unless, like, a third party turned it over, typically, no, you wouldn't get those. You would not get a privileged legal memorandum. I don't think you could hold that back. Interesting.
01:07:08.684 - 01:07:16.040, Speaker A: Well, I have my own theories, but anyway, they're just theories. Okay, well, where can people learn more about each of you and your work?
01:07:16.810 - 01:07:27.770, Speaker B: You can follow me on Twitter. Stephen d pally. And I am Kill, and I've got a very fancy and impressive bio on my law firm website that I don't know who wrote.
01:07:28.590 - 01:07:29.462, Speaker A: Gabriel.
01:07:29.606 - 01:07:49.058, Speaker C: I'm Lexnode. L-E-X underscore N-O-D-E on Twitter. And I have a website. I think it's called Deal Ninja Law. Anyway, it's linked on my Twitter bio. I have all my writings and stuff up there, and I have a, uh I never stopped talking, so you could.
01:07:49.064 - 01:07:54.002, Speaker B: Definitely you have a man. You're very try.
01:07:54.056 - 01:07:56.146, Speaker C: I'm a little tardy on it, to be honest with you.
01:07:56.248 - 01:08:02.040, Speaker B: I think I'm too late. I think substack is kind of like TikTok for me. I just don't think I'm cool enough.
01:08:03.850 - 01:08:05.842, Speaker A: Steven, I think we're in the same club.
01:08:05.906 - 01:08:06.230, Speaker B: Yeah.
