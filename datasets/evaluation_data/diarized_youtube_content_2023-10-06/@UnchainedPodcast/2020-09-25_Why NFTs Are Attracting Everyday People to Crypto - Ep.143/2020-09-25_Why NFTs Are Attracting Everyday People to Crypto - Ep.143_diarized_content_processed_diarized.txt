00:01:04.530 - 00:01:07.700, Speaker C: Hi, Laura, nice to see you again. Thanks again for having me.
00:01:08.070 - 00:01:29.450, Speaker A: Everyone's been talking about NFTs or non fungible tokens this week. For those in the audience who aren't sure what those are, if you remember CryptoKitties, which were unique, collectible digital cats, and I still think they exist, that's just one example. Jake, can you define what a non fungible token is and then we can dive into why there's so much chatter about them now.
00:01:29.600 - 00:02:09.560, Speaker C: Absolutely. I mean, the simple definition of a non fungible token is a token that represents a unique asset. We're used to cryptocurrencies where we have many units that are all worth the same. Like if I had one ether, Laura, and you had one know those are the same value. But if I had one CryptoKitty and you had another CryptoKitty, they actually might be valued totally differently. Your CryptoKitty might be really scarce and valuable and my CryptoKitty might be run of the mill and common. And so non fungible tokens, they really represent this asset class of unique assets that's out there.
00:02:10.010 - 00:02:14.390, Speaker A: And so what's been going on with them recently? Why has there been so much chatter?
00:02:15.210 - 00:02:31.642, Speaker C: Well, as someone who's been watching this space for a very long time, from really the very beginning when rare pepe images started to be traded on counterparty, it seems like about a million years ago.
00:02:31.776 - 00:02:34.830, Speaker A: That was a long time ago. That was before CryptoKitties.
00:02:35.170 - 00:03:18.166, Speaker C: I think what's actually happening is that the space of non fungible assets is maturing a little bit. And what we've seen is actually a little bit of interesting early conversion of digital creators who are creating art and collectibles and other kinds of NFT assets and they're starting to trade them on marketplaces and the volume on these marketplaces is going up a bit. And related to that, I think investors have matured a little bit in their thinking about the NFT space and they've started to position and make investments venture style mostly. So far in companies that are in the NFT space and it's been very exciting.
00:03:18.358 - 00:03:46.520, Speaker A: Yeah. And there's even a little bit of the yield farming thing going on with NFTs. So I think that's another reason people are getting excited, because even though the craze has died down from the fever pitch, I still see people interested in it. But you actually wrote a really interesting blog post about NFTs and you had another definition that you gave, which is you said that NFTs were liquid intellectual property for digital content. So what do you mean by that?
00:03:47.290 - 00:04:46.050, Speaker C: Yeah, so this is exactly what I've been sort of saying, is like most people have so far brushed off the NFT spaces, people trading funny pictures on blockchains. And if you sort of thought experiment a little bit and you start to understand a little bit of kind of the financial use cases that NFTs enable, you start to realize that if you take this view of NFTs as strong ownership of digital content, things get quite interesting. And the first thing to observe is that there's just like a lot of different kinds of digital content. Certainly there's art, certainly there's collectibles, but there's also 3D models or metaverse assets. There's also stock photography, there's also blog posts that people write and then monetize through syndication. There's music on which artists earn royalty. There's movies which get distributed on platforms like Netflix and so on and so forth.
00:04:46.050 - 00:06:08.370, Speaker C: And if you start to count up the number of digital objects on the internet and in the world, you actually start piling up quite an asset class of objects. And if you start to think of NFTs as being kind of a very fitting technology to denote ownership of these objects, to denote the royalty streams of these objects, then you start to get away from a little bit of the speculative aspects like, oh, I buy a crypto, kitty, I'm going to flip it to somebody else later. And you start to get into the more fundamentally valued aspects of non fungible assets, which is like, hey, maybe I'll own the revenue stream to Taylor Swift's song or album or something like that. Or maybe I'll own the movie rights to a certain digital character that I'll be able to license out. And when you take that view of NFTs as liquid intellectual property, what you start to realize is that most intellectual property doesn't live on secondary markets today. It's kind of illiquid and what blockchain enables is the liquidity of these markets. And so the reason that I'm super excited about NFTs as an investor is I think that we're about to unlock a whole lot of value that previously has been in these non traded like paper rights, but is about to get a lot more digital.
00:06:08.950 - 00:07:09.110, Speaker A: So I have so many questions about what you said, but before we get into those, I do just want to make one comment, which is I noticed in your blog post that you had a chart of different kinds of content. And one of them said written content and under written, it was like movies and videos. And I was like, what about articles and ebooks? As a writer, I just had to point out that you missed right there, because I would not call videos and movies written content. And also, even just now, in your example, when you mentioned blog posts, I was like, there are professional writers, too, who make a living writing. But anyway, okay, so you were talking about NFTs from the creator's perspective, but I wanted to ask also. So right now, as a consumer, I already have multiple libraries of music that I can tap, like music I can stream from Apple or Spotify or Pandora SoundCloud, et cetera, or I can go onto these different stock photography sites or whatever. So what's in it for the end? Like, what would get them to make a switch?
00:07:09.770 - 00:08:21.280, Speaker C: Well, because it basically democratizes the ownership in this kind of content, right? So if you think about a stock photography site today, like Getty Images or Shutterstock or something like that, I mean, you're talking about a private business that is facilitating a marketplace between stock photographers and purchasers of stock photography, like designers who are making websites and so on and so forth. And this marketplace model is exactly the thing that blockchain technology, in my opinion, was really born to disrupt. And basically what can happen is we can replace that proprietary provisioning of the marketplace with a decentralized, smart, contract based system, which is exactly what marketplaces like recently Rarible have done. And we can give the ownership and the governance of that system to the community of people who are participants in that marketplace. And that's a really powerful value proposition that blockchains in general, I think, give to the world.
00:08:22.210 - 00:08:50.582, Speaker A: Interesting. Okay, but how would that work exactly? Because as I'm sure you're well aware, it's very easy to create a screenshot of a piece of digital visual art. Like, if I go on the CryptoKitty site, I can just create a screenshot of a CryptoKitty. Same with a photo. I can pirate a song or a movie. I know writers get upset. I get upset if people make copies of my articles or try to get a PDF of an ebook or whatever.
00:08:50.582 - 00:09:01.480, Speaker A: So how would creators of NFTs protect against copies and actually make money from these so called non fungible tokens when it's so easy to create a copy of?
00:09:01.790 - 00:09:36.100, Speaker C: Yeah, so, again, I think when someone purchases an NFT, and maybe that's not totally true today, but I do think this is exactly where the space is headed. They're not buying the image. In my opinion. What they're buying is the intellectual property rights of the image. And so if you think about the Mona Lisa, the Mona Lisa lives in the Louvre of France and Paris. It's worth $800 million. But of course, I can go online and download a picture of the mona Lisa and put it on my wall, that doesn't mean that I can resell that picture for $800 million.
00:09:36.100 - 00:10:32.386, Speaker C: So why is it that the Mona Lisa is worth that much, but a copy is not? Well, in that case, this is physical art, right? And it sits in a museum, and people go to that museum every day. Millions of people go every year. And of course, they all pay to see the Mona Lisa. So the Mona Lisa has a revenue streak, right, that could be valued and figured out. How you enforce that in the digital realm becomes a really interesting think. I think that existing law and property rights are perfectly acceptable ways of enforcing the actual legal rights of these works. Now, what's super interesting is that projects like Aragon are working on this idea of a global digital jurisdiction and global on chain dispute resolution.
00:10:32.386 - 00:11:03.790, Speaker C: If you've ever seen Aragon court, if you've seen Aragon agreements, those speak to how we might be able to ensure and enforce off chain property rights in the future using blockchain technology also. So the short answer is short term, I think it's just we're going to allow creators to give the purchaser of their NFT legal property rights, and in the long term, those property rights might actually be enforced on chain. Wow.
00:11:03.860 - 00:11:12.260, Speaker A: Okay. There's just so much to unpack there. But let's take a commercial break first. So first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible.
00:11:13.350 - 00:11:22.374, Speaker B: Inter blockchain communication will be launching on Cosmos soon. Join Hack Atom Five, the two week Cosmos virtual hackathon where you can play.
00:11:22.412 - 00:11:24.646, Speaker A: With inner blockchain communication before it is.
00:11:24.668 - 00:11:30.082, Speaker B: Launched and be amongst the winners of a $50,000 prize pool valued in Atom.
00:11:30.226 - 00:11:32.826, Speaker A: Hack Atom Five, coming soon to a.
00:11:32.848 - 00:11:35.446, Speaker B: Dev post near you this October.
00:11:35.638 - 00:11:38.566, Speaker A: Visit five. Hackadom.org.
00:11:38.678 - 00:11:45.530, Speaker B: That's fivehackatom.org.
00:11:46.450 - 00:12:42.794, Speaker A: Back to my conversation with Sheikh Bruckman. So I have interviewed Luis Quende of Aragon. I understand how that works. I find it super fascinating. But I would imagine that for this sort of digital jurisdiction to have any kind of teeth would be that they would need to get sign on from actual physical jurisdictions, like the physical jurisdiction where the Mona Lisa exists. So I don't know if they can just sort of claim that they have this jurisdiction, right? And so I just imagine that let's mean actually, the Mona Lisa isn't a great example, but let's start with some of the because there's been these different crypto art things. I've been seeing that there are these auctions, and they're selling actually for a fair bit of money, like $7,000 or higher, which for something that can be copied and spread everywhere all over the Internet.
00:12:42.794 - 00:13:04.966, Speaker A: I'm a little bit like, why would you pay? So I don't know. Anyway, the point is, especially in this case, where you don't know if the jurisdiction will honor kind of this idea that you are the one who owns this. So how do you guys plan to kind of get around that mean?
00:13:04.988 - 00:14:08.426, Speaker C: I think look, again, we're super early and to be totally honest, no NFT platform has yet gotten to the point where they're actually integrating legal rights. But I actually don't think it's that unlikely. I think you basically kind of agree on the jurisdiction where the creator is operating and where the buyer is operating and you kind of agree to the set of rules. And I think you'll find that there are definitely kind of default property rights that will come into effect in those jurisdiction, in that jurisdiction. But more specifically, I think what you really want is the creator. And this is probably going to be facilitated by the platform. Just like we have an open source today, you'll sort of choose a license and this license will say things like, hey, I give the buyer the right to resell this work or modify this work, or sell the rights of this work to a movie, or another artist or creator might opt to not do that.
00:14:08.426 - 00:15:08.670, Speaker C: They might say like, this work is provided as is, but you have strong ownership of it, you have the right to lend it, to make a return on it, to create a royalty stream for yourself on it, but I don't want you to modify it. Right? And all of those kinds of property rights might just be enumerated in a legal contract. And there's actually a number of precedents in blockchain today where people are combining legal jurisdictions and sort of traditional entities and contracts together with tokens. If you're curious on that topic, check out what OpenLaw is doing with the Lau on chain Dao venture funds. There also have been ICOs where by purchasing tokens, you're also signing a legal agreement in a certain jurisdiction. And the same kind of legal technology can be applied to NFTs. We need a company in the market to do that, and I think that will happen fairly soon.
00:15:08.820 - 00:15:39.900, Speaker A: Yeah, I think the question of whether or not those agreements will be enforced as they are written probably comes down to the courts. But I am not a legal person. So if there's a lawyer watching this who's like Laura got that wrong, let me know. So just to go back to some earlier comments you made, you were talking about this ability to have fractional ownership and governance by communities. So you gave some examples, but where do you think this could go in the future?
00:15:40.430 - 00:16:34.380, Speaker C: Well, like I said, I think that the core value proposition that blockchain technology gives to marketplaces is it removes the middleman, it removes this sort of proprietary need to extract profit from the marketplace. And what it can do is it can redirect that ownership of the marketplace to the community and using blockchain also in a very efficient way. So I always like to say you can buy someone's attention by paying them money, but it's very hard to buy their loyalty. The way that you buy people's loyalty is you make them a partner, you give them equity in the firm. And I think what liquidity mining has shown recently in DeFi and what volume mining, which is what Rarible, an NFT marketplace, has really been the first project to showcase in the market.
00:16:34.750 - 00:16:36.842, Speaker A: I don't know what volume mining is.
00:16:36.976 - 00:16:41.274, Speaker C: Oh, sure. So when Rarible launched, they decided to.
00:16:41.312 - 00:16:44.858, Speaker A: Launch by the way, they're an NFT marketplace for people who don't know that's.
00:16:44.874 - 00:17:22.422, Speaker C: Right. Rarible is an NFT marketplace, which was the first NFT marketplace to launch with a governance token. And when you transact in the marketplace, when you either make a purchase or make a sale as a creator, you're also drop tokens in a weekly AirDrop. And it's not that you're just getting paid for transacting on the platform, which is what I was referring to as volume mining. It's also that you're becoming a partial owner of the platform. By holding the token, you get governance rights in the voting system. In the future, you might be able to pay commission fees with this token.
00:17:22.422 - 00:17:37.710, Speaker C: You might be able to stake it and do things like that in future use cases. Right. So this idea of community ownership of the platform, I think is a very strong value proposition for users and participants.
00:17:38.050 - 00:17:55.370, Speaker A: And you also wrote in your blog post about something about how fractionalized tokens can be traded crowdfunded and incorporated into other financialization schemes to manage risk. I didn't know what that meant. Was that like using them as collateral or what are some examples?
00:17:55.390 - 00:18:44.302, Speaker C: Absolutely. So once you recognize, or if you recognize that NFTs are a financial asset class, then you start to realize that you need financial infrastructure to manage this financial asset class, just like you do in fungible tokens. And what does that look like? Well, it looks like in DeFi NFT crossovers, for example, there's a company called the Neftify where you can deposit your NFT and get a loan against that collateral because someone actually values that NFT. Another example is fractionalizing ownership in an NFT. There's a cool project called Arc Gallery and they created this thing called Wrapped Crypto Punks. So imagine, Laura, you see a Crypto Punk is a kind of blockchain collectible. And imagine you see one and it's like too expensive.
00:18:44.302 - 00:19:20.862, Speaker C: It's like $5,000. What you could do is you could start a crowdfunding page with your friends and as soon as you crowdfund $5,000, all of you together go and buy the Crypto Punk and you can co own it together. And the way that you co own it is you get an ERC 20 token that represent partial ownership in the collectible. So if you contribute like 1000 out of 5000, you'll own 20% of the asset. And so those are two examples of financialization schemes that you could apply to this new asset class.
00:19:20.916 - 00:19:32.980, Speaker A: And then once you do own that 20% of the crypto punk, then what can you do with it? You can license it to be used in a video or something and make money that way.
00:19:33.510 - 00:20:02.220, Speaker C: Well, so this is where, philosophically, I've been thinking a lot about what are the implications of fractionalization. But generally speaking, that means that whatever decision that the owners of the asset collectively make, like, let's say that you and I co own an asset and we want to sell it, well, that means that the proceeds of that sale will go proportionally to us, proportionally to our ownership of it.
00:20:03.410 - 00:20:06.634, Speaker A: Okay, so it's just about owning and selling, buying and selling.
00:20:06.762 - 00:20:33.622, Speaker C: Yeah. But there could be other decisions that we might want to make as asset. We might a museum might come to us and say, jake, Laura, will you lend us your crypto punk to put on display in an art show? And we might say, yes, but you have to pay us $10 or something for the privilege of doing that. And again, we will split that revenue stream between us. Okay.
00:20:33.676 - 00:21:11.730, Speaker A: $2 apiece. So there are a few NFTs that are also combining with D Five, which is pretty interesting, like Avagochis, which are a combination of Aave, the lending platform, and Tomagochis, which are these digital pets. And the Avagochi will actually earn interest. And then Rarible has this Y NFT, which is like an NFT based insurance cover written by Nexus. I actually didn't fully really understand that, but can you just talk a little bit about this trend and where you think what they're calling NFT phi, where you think it could yeah.
00:21:11.800 - 00:22:25.354, Speaker C: Well, I love the idea of Avagatchi because it's precisely this way of combining this really fun, very grassroots, very artsy, and cutesy and collectibles focused side of the blockchain space with the much more serious kind of financial application side of the blockchain space. And the one thing I take away from all these efforts that look a little bit cute today is that it educates a larger number of people about finance. Finance historically, has always been something in the realm of academia and industry. And these days, with the advent of the Internet, and especially with the advent of blockchain, we're being a lot more social about finance. Finance is spreading, like if you've been reading about how the younger generations have been trading on Robinhood. Right. And so when I look at Avagatchi, I think this is, like, a great way of starting to educate younger folks about what finance is and how it could be used as a tool.
00:22:25.354 - 00:23:12.410, Speaker C: So Avagatchi is a combination of collectibles and on chain lending. There's also a project recently called Meme where you stake a token and you earn these things called pineapples, and then you can redeem the pineapples for rare limited edition artworks that they've created, which is very interesting. And there's a ton of thinking about, like, NFTs as a generally less liquid asset class than fungibles. How do we make them more liquid. Right. And this area of NFT Phi or NFT times, DeFi, whatever you want to call it, is doing a lot of work to make that asset class more liquid and sort of more accessible to users.
00:23:13.070 - 00:23:32.830, Speaker A: All right, well, we're going to have to see where this goes. It's definitely an interesting trend. I don't know how much I believe it's going to take off, but we'll see. I could see it happening maybe in gaming. As a creator, I'm definitely interested. But yeah, as you can tell, I have a lot of questions. Yeah, go ahead.
00:23:32.900 - 00:24:14.702, Speaker C: Can I give you an idea? Sure. I'm going to make a bold prediction, and my bold prediction is that there's a very good chance that the NFT space can get on par with what's happening in DeFi. Let me tell you why I think that if you've been following Zapper, zapper is sort of the premier wallet for DFI opportunities that's out there. Recently on Twitter, they published their August numbers from their website. And what those numbers showed is that they have about 20,000 daily active users and about 300,000 monthly active users. And most people were kind of surprised. They were like, we thought there was like 100,000 users in D Five.
00:24:14.702 - 00:24:45.138, Speaker C: We thought maybe there's 200,000 monthly users in D Five, but we did not think 300,000. And of course, it doesn't count everybody. There's probably a bit more. Now, if you take a look at Rarible, Rarible has been doing really well lately with the Token. They've gotten a lot of attention over the last couple of weeks. These guys are doing about 100,000 monthly active users in the last month. And that doesn't even count all of the other marketplaces for NFTs.
00:24:45.138 - 00:25:35.126, Speaker C: It doesn't count. Super rare and Makers place and known origin and Mint base and everything else. And what you start to get a sense of is that attention wise, there's not a lot of growth that might have to happen in NFTs for the number of people in NFTs to get on par with the number of people in DeFi. And that's kind of an amazing fact that probably most people don't quite realize. And I'll tell you why I think that is. I think that's because this idea of trading digital art or collectibles is a very natural idea to people who aren't naturally tech and finance focused. So if you go look at the D Five people, they're all putting the Y token into the Z token, into the X pool, into that thing.
00:25:35.126 - 00:25:59.280, Speaker C: And I love doing that like I'm a finance nerd. But most people, they don't have the slightest idea of how to do that. But if you tell them, hey, you could go online and buy a piece of art, that's actually a very natural thing for them to do. So I think the NFT space is building a lot of customer affinity and early mainstream adoption that DeFi just won't do as quickly.
00:26:01.170 - 00:26:28.258, Speaker A: That'S fascinating. Yeah, I'll say your theory sounds plausible. Clearly, this is a space I need to explore a little bit more because I was a little bit confused this week. I was like, Why is this all taking off? What's going on? But also, I spent the last weekend at the beach, so maybe I just wasn't on Twitter enough. Anyway, all right, well, this has been so fun. Thanks for coming on unconfirmed.
00:26:28.434 - 00:26:30.750, Speaker C: Yeah, thank you for having me, Laura.
00:26:30.930 - 00:26:54.590, Speaker A: Don't forget, next up is the weekly news recap. Stick around for this week in Crypto after this short break.

00:27:09.210 - 00:27:46.334, Speaker B: Thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap. First headline national banks can hold stablecoin reserves. Big news regarding Fiat backed stablecoins such as USDC and Tether. On Monday, the Office of the Controller of the Currency said that federally chartered banks can hold the reserves for such coins. Although stablecoin issuers have been using US. Banks for years, the regulatory environment surrounding such use has been murky. The OCC guidance has now made it clear that federally regulated banks should feel comfortable providing this to stablecoin issuers as long as they are backed on a 101 basis with Fiat Currencies Publishing.
00:27:46.334 - 00:29:01.542, Speaker B: Concurrently, the securities and Exchange Commission released a statement from its FinHub unit, which focuses on digital assets, noting that certain stablecoins might not be securities under federal law, but each case would be decided on, quote, a facts and circumstances determination. Presumably, Fiat backed stablecoins are not securities, but from previous cases, such as basecoin basis algorithmic ones, could be. Next headline is the Uniswap token a Security In the latest twist to the SushiSwap saga, Uniswap went live with its token Uni last week. Immediately, crypto lawyers began saying they believe Uni looks like an unregistered security. First, it was airdropped, and Airdrops quote, may not spare you from securities regulation, according to a 2017 Coin Center blog post, which Niraj Agrawal, its communications officer, felt compelled to tweet out the night of the Uniswap AirDrop. Second, as the price has shot up, people may be interested in obtaining Uni with the expectation of a profit rather than to utilize the network. And the value of Uni could be influenced by the efforts of an identified party, uniswap.
00:29:01.542 - 00:30:00.586, Speaker B: And that would trigger the final prong of the so called Howie test, which determines whether or not an investment contract is a security. Greg Lisa, a partner at Hogan Levels who worked on a case involving Ether Delta, a crypto exchange that billed itself is decentralized, but which the SEC determined was not said to the block. Quote this really looks like a blimp crash. It can be seen from a mile away. The biggest question is when, not whether the SEC and other regulators or law enforcement are going to say do something about this. On a related note, two bipartisan bills introduced to Congress this week could clarify how the SEC and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission handle tokens, since tokens can sometimes start out as securities but evolve into commodities once their networks are sufficiently decentralized. One bill, called the securities Clarity Act, would explicitly define SEC jurisdiction to token pre sales.
00:30:00.586 - 00:31:27.720, Speaker B: As Coins Center puts it quote A non security is being sold the future decentralized token, but it comes with a contractual promise from the issuer, which is the promise to build the token network as specified so that tokens will actually do something of value in the future. The second bill proposes a way for the CFTC to regulate US based crypto exchanges and would give crypto exchanges the option to register as a digital commodity exchange, or DCE. And any pre sold tokens, meaning those that started out as securities, could only be traded on these CFTC registered exchanges, but only after the network is live. A token is sold to the public there, and at that point it would lose its security status. Next Headline High Gas Fees Have Forced Uniloggin to Shut Down Uniloggin co founder Alex Vandersan announced that the DAP onboarding solution is closing up shop due to high gas fees on Ethereum, with the cost of onboarding a new user soaring to over $130 on some days. Although the provider considered a pivot to a L2 DFI focused wallet, it would have required an almost total restart of the project. Uniloggin has decided instead to return its remaining cash to investors, adding that even if gas prices were to improve and its uncover lessened, it still can't imagine a way forward because Ethereum's high gas fees do not appear to be a temporary problem.
00:31:27.720 - 00:32:46.734, Speaker B: In related news, a progress report on EIP 1559 Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1559, which promises a significant change to Ethereum's fee market, was posted on Wednesday, first proposed by Ethereum creator Vitalik. Buterin in 2019, the transaction pricing mechanism for EIP 1559 would offer a quote, fixed per block network fee that is burned and dynamically expands, and contracts block sizes to deal with transient congestion. The main concern is that since the EIP 1559 could stretch blocks up to three times their current size, any denial of service attack could now be three times as effective. Next up Analytics Roundup Dune Analytics secures $2 million in funding Dragonfly Capital led a seed funding round in Ethereum centric analytics platform, Dune Analytics, which enables people to create their own charts and dashboards and share them with others. For those of you who haven't yet tried Duna Analytics, I highly recommend this resource, which a. Lot of my own sources use to explain things to me. Next up in the roundup, Block Native announces Mempool Explorer, calling it a missing link in the ecosystem.
00:32:46.734 - 00:33:53.954, Speaker B: Block native unveiled Mempool Explorer on Wednesday, which enables people to, for instance, detect when more than $10,000 of liquidity moves into or out of a specific protocol, or to find out when someone's smart contract is party to a pending transaction and more. If you recall the story by Dan Robinson of Paradigm about the $10,000 that he tried to rescue from a smart contract but could not because a bot spotted his rescue attempt in the Mempool and stole the money first. That helps in explaining how this tool could be useful. Next DFI roundup MakerDAO will not compensate victims of March's flash crash after initially deciding in early April to refund washed out investors for March's Black Thursday crash on Tuesday, larger MKR holders dominated a vote and decided against making whole those same investors who lost a cumulative $8.33 million. Only 38 unique votes were cast, the equivalent of 8.7% of all MKR token holders.
00:33:53.954 - 00:34:40.578, Speaker B: Participants were incentivized to vote against any compensation because additional printing of MKR would dilute the value of their holdings. TBTC is now live. The TBTC network, which launched earlier this year but quickly pulled the plug, has relaunched. Quote with unprecedented security measures in place, allowing users to deposit and redeem bitcoin in DFI without intermediaries. Users can now exchange BTC for TBTC, which is an ERC 20 token for use on DFI platforms at a one to one ratio. Quote Each TBTC is fully backed and matched by at least one bitcoin held in reserve. Yam looks forward after relaunch after a wild three day launch and then crash in August.
00:34:40.578 - 00:35:24.820, Speaker B: Last Friday. DFI token yam. Relaunched. By Monday, it had its first rebase with $571,000 in YUSD added to its treasury. Next Headline A New Alternative to Buyback and burn in a blog post, Joel Monegro of Placeholder Capital examines the common buyback and burn model and points out that though this model works for currencies, it has pitfalls, particularly for governance tokens. He writes quote when it comes to capital assets like governance tokens issuance is key to capitalization, and burning can get in the way of growing fundamental value. He defines currency as an asset whose value comes from exchange, such as to consumer goods or to services.
00:35:24.820 - 00:36:13.294, Speaker B: However, an asset used for governance or equity participation is capital. He cites MKR and ZRX as examples of networks that generate income in ETH, but then redistribute value via their governance tokens. He says if you draw an analogy to buybacks in equities world, stock buybacks typically do not result in shares being destroyed. They tend to be held by the company as treasury shares and just reduce the number of outstanding shares. On the flip side, issuance is how a crypto network such as a Dow or a protocol can obtain the resources it needs to scale he says, quote this is why tools like mining, proof of stake and liquidity rewards can work so well. There's far more upside to smart issuance than there is in clutching to scarcity. He then proposes a balancer smart pool.
00:36:13.294 - 00:36:42.126, Speaker B: Balancer is one of those automated market makers, and he proposes a smart pool that would be 10% ETH and 90% of a capital token. That could function as what he calls, quote, an automatic buyback machine token issuance pool and liquidity provider, since it would automatically rebalance by selling excess ETH or the capital token to retain a specific ratio, and that would function as a buyback. His post gets even more in the weeds than this.
00:36:42.308 - 00:36:43.934, Speaker A: Hopefully I haven't lost you all, but.
00:36:43.972 - 00:38:08.434, Speaker B: It'S definitely worth checking out for creative ways to provide liquidity in a token. Next Headline How to Value the Wi Fi Token The Wi Fi Token, which governs yearn or yearn, was launched with a disclaimer that the token itself, quote, has zero value. However, investors disagreed with that initial assessment, and FYI, limited to only 30,000 tokens, has reached a price as high as $44,000 since its launch. But how should such a wide ranging crypto network be valued? The newly formed Mechanism Capital did a deep dive into potential valuation methods, first dismissing the usefulness of total value locked, which is a common metric, as well as price to earnings ratio. The article then makes a case for two future oriented valuation models forward price to earning and discounted cash flow. It presents base conservative and aggressive forecasts for the price of WiFi, with the Bear case being for a token that's worth $15,800 and the aggressive case for a much higher price token $315,500.
