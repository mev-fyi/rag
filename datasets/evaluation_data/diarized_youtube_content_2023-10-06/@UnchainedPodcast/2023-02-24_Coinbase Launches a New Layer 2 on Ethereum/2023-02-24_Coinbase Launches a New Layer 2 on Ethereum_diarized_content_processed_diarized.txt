00:00:00.170 - 00:00:07.802, Speaker B: Coinbase is launching a new layer two on Ethereum called Base. What does that mean? Jesse Pollock, Head of Protocols at Coinbase.
00:00:07.866 - 00:00:17.326, Speaker A: Explains base is an ethereum layer two blockchain. That's the onchain home for Coinbase products, users and assets, and also an open ecosystem where anyone can build.
00:00:17.428 - 00:00:37.922, Speaker B: But Coinbase is the onramp for the fiat world to the crypto world. And most Coinbase customers are not transacting with blockchains from their own wallets. They generally trust Coinbase to manage their own private keys. So what does it mean that there is a layer two that, as Coinbase puts it, also connects to the Exchange's 110,000,000 users?
00:00:37.986 - 00:00:55.746, Speaker A: We have Coinbase Wallet, which is self custodial, and then in the Coinbase app we have the DAP Wallet, which is also a fully web3 native experience. And so Base is going to integrate into both of those people are going to deploy their applications on Base and then users are going to be able to access those applications through Coinbase Wallet and through the Coinbase app DAP Wallet.
00:00:55.798 - 00:01:02.510, Speaker B: There's already a bunch of layer twos. So why would a developer choose to build on Base as opposed to on an existing layer two?
00:01:02.580 - 00:01:29.714, Speaker A: Base is an Ethereum L two like optimism and arbitrary. The thing that we think is going to be really different about Base is because Coinbase has this suite of products like our developer tools and our consumer front ends like Coinbase and Coinbase Wallet. We have the opportunity to bring all those things together around Base and make it so it's really easy for developers to build and then it's really easy for those applications that the developers do build to actually get access to the users that are coming through. Coinbase client.
00:01:29.842 - 00:01:42.380, Speaker B: Whether or not this launch takes off or falls flat like Coinbase NFT is anyone's guess. Let us know in the comments whether you think Base can help Coinbase capture crypto natives in or whether the Dgens have already moved on.
