00:00:51.286 - 00:00:53.200, Speaker A: Hi, Laura. Thanks for having me.
00:00:53.650 - 00:01:02.800, Speaker B: The NFT world has been all about Bitcoin ordinals recently, but you're launching a new product on the OG chain for NFTs. What is mint fun?
00:01:03.350 - 00:01:43.360, Speaker A: Mint Fun is a aggregator where we show every NFT project on Ethereum that's releasing right now, like on the primary market, like new Mints in one interface. And from this interface you can mint directly onto smart contracts. So, yeah, we show NFTs that people are launching today and we let you mint them from our website. It's kind of like the reddit of web3. Or like I like to think about it that way because we show the current moment of web3 and let you kind of interact with it right from our website.
00:01:43.730 - 00:01:48.240, Speaker B: And so why would users be interested in Mint Fun? What problem are you solving for them?
00:01:48.770 - 00:02:35.182, Speaker A: Yeah, so we solve a couple of different problems. One problem is I mentioned this kind of reddit use case. I think that a number of people kind of want to understand what are people doing with hot, what's going on right now? So just as kind of a view interface, like, oh, these are the NFT projects people are using right now. I actually have heard from a lot of people, even project creators. Hey, it's really important for us in our strategy to get noticed on this Mint fund homepage just as kind of a visibility thing because people want to know what's going on. The other problem we solve is discovery is kind of the first thing we solve. The other problem we solve is interacting with different smart contracts and things like that.
00:02:35.182 - 00:03:10.098, Speaker A: So we actually build the interface for NFT collections automatically. We can take a smart contract and we let people mint right from our website. And so the advantage to that is a couple of things. I think in general, web3 front end, like the websites themselves are getting better. But for a long time, most front ends didn't work on mobile or would have really subtle weird bugs, or they wouldn't work with this one wallet. So just by having a very polished front end, we support every wallet. We support mobile really well over half of our traffic is actually mobile web.
00:03:10.098 - 00:03:56.486, Speaker A: And I think that's because we support mobile really well, which I think is higher than most web3 DApps or websites. And then the final thing we solve is kind of security. So that's one nice thing about Mint Fun is when you see a project on Mint Fun and you click, like, the mint button, you can be confident that what that will do is mint an NFT to your wallet, as opposed to maybe sign away your assets or do something like kind of sketchy. Because we're also on our back end verifying what's going on. We're like, okay, this function mints an NFT, it's not going to be doing anything else. So those are kind of the three things we kind of help with, like discovery, like actually helping you go from discovery to minting an asset really fast. And then we do vetting and security just on a technological level.
00:03:56.668 - 00:04:00.918, Speaker B: So how does this differ from like a Blur or an OpenSea?
00:04:01.094 - 00:04:47.474, Speaker A: The primary difference between Blur or OpenSea is the main use case for Blur or OpenSea is the secondary market. So usually projects have already released and people are trading the assets post release or they're not generally available. We focus on the moment that NFTs first come out the primary market. So our focus is just almost entirely on how can we help you discover the stuff that's still releasing. You could imagine a scenario where one common story is like, oh, the crypto punks took a few months to mint out, and that's because the market was much smaller, not a lot of people knew about it. We can kind of surface those moments as they're happening. In my opinion, NFT Mints are kind of like really exciting cultural forces.
00:04:47.474 - 00:05:00.442, Speaker A: This is a really fun moment. And so by focusing on that, that's how we're different. Blur and OpenSea are both great at kind of the secondary trading experience, and I think we can complement those products also.
00:05:00.576 - 00:05:22.820, Speaker B: And so I was curious on the backend, is this really challenging in the sense that I know for exchanges, that integrating coins from different blockchains can take a fair amount of work, but is it that since everything's on ethereum and it's all following the same standard, that it's pretty automated for you? Or is there more complexity to that?
00:05:23.190 - 00:06:08.690, Speaker A: It's both probably easier than integrating different chains and harder than building a marketplace. It's in between. So the way it works is there is a standard for NFTs on Ethereum, ERC 721 or ERC 1155. Those are standards that are composable and easy to build upon. The thing that there's not actually a standard for is how do you create an NFT, how do you mint an NFT? How do you sell an NFT? So the clever part that we do is we actually look at, okay, looks like NFTs are being created here, this contract. And then our software kind of parses what's going on? And then looks at the chain, looks at the smart contract. And this is this function.
00:06:08.690 - 00:06:42.190, Speaker A: If you call it and send it this amount of ETH, you will get an NFT back. And so the thing we solve there is we automate the entry point to minting an NFT. So that's kind of the clever bit that we figured out. And we can even do this without having access to the source code or the abi. We can do it if you don't see an option on Ether scan to do it. So it's kind of like somewhere in the middle between supporting 20 blockchains and supporting the standardized functionality of NFT contracts.
00:06:42.770 - 00:06:55.070, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, in my personal experience, and I'm not an experienced NFT person, but I have minted NFTs on Etherscan. So prior to Mint Fun, what were the main ways that people minted?
00:06:55.970 - 00:07:35.770, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. So I think there's a couple of mean, I would say the most common way, like number one is people would make websites, like one off websites. And as I alluded to earlier, sometimes even really great Ethereum smart contract developers don't know how to make a great website. That's kind of a different orthogonal skill set. So probably number one would just be websites and so some would be great, some would be poor, maybe again, maybe it wouldn't support the wallet that you decided to use. And then yeah, Etherscan, I think those are probably the two main. And then of course, the longer tail platforms you can think of the foundations and the Zoras of the world, the manifolds, all these platforms that kind of give creator tools.
00:07:35.770 - 00:08:03.542, Speaker A: I think that's kind of what the landscape looked like a couple of years ago. It's still what it looks like now. Although I will say that we've seen, for example, smart contract devs. They don't want to put together a website, they're saying, hey, you can mint our NFT on Etherscan. And I've seen this happen organically like maybe a dozen times. Someone in the replies is like, actually, you can also mint this on Mint Fun. And then the smart contract developer is like, oh yeah, here, like I'll share that link because that's a lot easier than figuring out the Ether scan UI or something like that.
00:08:03.676 - 00:08:28.606, Speaker B: Yeah. For me, I just cover crypto, which is different from being in crypto. It is a challenge when I go to try to do these things and it's like, I know in theory what they are and everything, but then the actuality of trying to use the tools is totally different. Ballgame so you also launched a reward system called Fund Drop. What is that?
00:08:28.788 - 00:09:02.130, Speaker A: Yeah, so Fundrop is our reward system. We thought it would be really fun to experiment with different ways of rewarding our users. So we launched this mid April. The way we launched this was we announced the Fund Drop, like this series of rewards and we said okay, if you want to be part of these rewards, you can mint a Fund Drop Pass, which is an NFT that has no value. It's just kind of your membership into the program. It's actually soul bound. Like you can't transfer it.
00:09:02.130 - 00:09:37.030, Speaker A: It's just meant to be commemorative to show that you did something on chain and on chain is really important to us as a product. You did something on chain to join. And so that was really exciting. In the first month that we launched the Fund Drop pass, just announcing the pass, really. And we showed a leaderboard with points. We gave people points both for their retroactive ethereum usage and continued usage of Mint Fun. We saw about 200,000 passes get minted in the first month, which was really cool to see like 200,000 people, or 200,000 wallets, I should say, signed up for rewards.
00:09:37.030 - 00:10:29.974, Speaker A: And the idea that we've been doing is so we've been giving points for, again, ethereum activity before we started the Fund drop using Mint Fun. And we've also been encouraging people to keep up like a streak on the website, which is like, minting an NFT every day, just trying to make it like a fun little game of how can you get to the top of the leaderboard, how can you get points. Now, one question we get a lot is like, okay, well, what are the points good for? They're just numbers in a database. The points themselves aren't even on chain or Tradable. Well, the points we've been giving out weekly rewards based on the points. So the first Fun Friday was on, I think it was May 19. Yeah, it was the first Fun Friday, which is our like now we're giving rewards for the points.
00:10:29.974 - 00:11:17.518, Speaker A: Stop me if you have any questions, but I'll just wrap this up and say that we announced the first Fun Friday with an NFT drop. That was like an exclusive NFT drop. We gave that to about half of the people admitted an NFT to kind of make it somewhat exclusive. And then we gave an even rarer version of that to, I think, 4000 people we put on the allow list. So we worked with this pixel artist, Numo. He made this really fun animation of an arcade machine, and we kind of gave that out to every single person who had met that criteria. The other really exciting thing we did, which has been really fun, is we announced this thing called gas rewards.
00:11:17.518 - 00:11:59.570, Speaker A: And on the 26th, which might be the day this comes out, we're going to be giving the first gas rewards to the users, which more or less we're going to be reimbursing people's gas that they've used to keep their streak alive on the website. We're doing the math. We've been modeling this out on our end. Paying for people's gas mint NFTs can get very expensive very quickly. And we don't view this as like the long term goal. We definitely don't have unlimited money to give out, but we thought it would be cool to, again, give people a reward for participating on the platform. And hey, you've been minting NFTs every day, you've been supporting the Duff Fund.
00:11:59.570 - 00:12:38.014, Speaker A: Gas has been kind of all over the place lately. Can we give you a rebate? And so we're going to give out the first gas rewards on Friday. We're going to keep revisiting what that means in future weeks, but the long term or medium term goal over the next couple of months is we will also launch Mint Fund on layer twos, where gas is a lot cheaper. That's another thing we're building towards. So gas rewards right now is kind of a way of saying thanks. While us and all the other NFT platforms migrate from more expensive ethereum layer one to layer two technologies, I talked for a while, so I'm curious if you have any thoughts or reactions from there. But that's what we've been working on.
00:12:38.014 - 00:12:43.262, Speaker A: It's been a lot of fun and people have been very excited about it, so it's been exciting to work on. Yeah.
00:12:43.316 - 00:13:09.350, Speaker B: My main reaction is that it reminds me that for certain banks, if you use a different ATM, then they will reimburse you your ATM fees. So it's something like that. But you're right that in the case of certain banks that do that, I think they're doing it because they save on brick and mortar branches. And in your case, as you mentioned, this is probably not sustainable because you're not like, saving other costs that you would have otherwise, right?
00:13:09.420 - 00:13:10.040, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:13:10.810 - 00:13:52.610, Speaker B: So in a moment, we're going to talk about the wider NFT market. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible. Meet Stator Labs, the noncustodial MultiChain liquid staking platform transforming the liquid staking landscape. With over $120,000,000 in assets staked and more than 40k users across six chains. Stator has partnered with 40 plus top DFI protocols like Abe, Balancer, et cetera, with a unique multipool architecture and Tokenomics Efex. Their liquid staking token on Ethereum empowers stakers everywhere to run a node with as little as four E and earn 35% more than solo staking. Sign up for their ETHX Alpha list today and be the first to know about $1 million in D five rewards.
00:13:52.610 - 00:14:07.974, Speaker B: Back to my conversation with Luke. So NFTs were the catalyst to the last bull market, but we're not quite in that same mania that we were in in late 2021 and early 2022. So how would you describe the last twelve months in NFTs?
00:14:08.102 - 00:14:51.878, Speaker A: Yeah, I think the last twelve months have been it's been kind of like the evening off of the cycle. I think that there was this moment and I wasn't around for the ICO bubble. That wasn't exactly something I was participating in. But I feel like with what I do know, there might have been some parallels where it seemed like there were so many NFT projects that sold their NFTs on this vision of we're going to have this really fantastic roadmap, and here's what the project is. We're going to do great things with the community. And I think some projects actually made good on that promise. I think probably the best example is the Basi, the Yuga Labs.
00:14:51.878 - 00:15:59.760, Speaker A: They had their eight best. They're making their video game. It seems like they're doing the roadmap that they promised. Unfortunately, it seems like a lot of other projects weren't so lucky. I think 2021 was the year where he saw a lot of these kind of like PFP projects that once had a lot of attention, say, actually, no, we're going to decentralize the community, or we're going to actually not do the roadmap, or it turns out we don't have as much money as we thought. And so 2021, I think, was marked with a lot of, I would say kind of like we woke up to maybe a more unpleasant reality, especially if trading volume goes down, if there's not as many secondary royalty or revenue streams, and even just if the price of ethereum is not where it once was. I think 2021 was kind of like a repricing moment across the board, the positive or the upshot or the thing that also was happening, I think kind of like mid 2021 towards the end and beginning of 20.
00:15:59.760 - 00:17:09.922, Speaker A: I've been saying 2021, and I mean 2022, but yeah, I meant to say last year, 2022, I think there was like this huge repricing. And then the beginning of this year, 2023, the end of it to the beginning. There was also kind of a moment where Open Editions became really hot. And that actually seemed really interesting to me for a couple of reasons. One, because it kind of marked a shift from this PFP project being like the primary hotness in NFTs, where, okay, everything has to be like this Hype, ten E, four PFP project. I almost feel like one of the last big PFP projects was probably Paradigm's Art Gobblers project, which saw this immense hype, and then it leveled off kind of quickly for a couple of reasons that I won't probably get into right now. But point being is it kind of felt like something shifted where the idea of the PFP project being like this organization that's going to do a roadmap for you is kind of now dissolving more back into the single creator narrative.
00:17:09.922 - 00:17:58.082, Speaker A: Which I think is probably good because I don't think all NFT projects should or can be companies to thread it back through to open editions. Probably the most successful recent example of this is Jack Butcher's Visualized Value, his Checks project, which started off as a series of open editions, released on, I think, both Zora and Manifold's platforms. And I think he kind of released those as a satirical response to kind of what was happening with Twitter and the check marks. Plus, I think that his style of explaining stuff through infographics, it all was kind of a perfect storm with also people wanting to mint open editions. And then I think he just kept building on it and just added more and more mechanics. I think actually he's doing more auctions. He's making physical pieces.
00:17:58.082 - 00:18:44.370, Speaker A: And I think that's kind of like a refocusing where I think he had done NFTs before. But I think this addition format, we're going to actually make a time window where as many of these NFTs as you want can be minted. There's not necessarily a roadmap, but maybe we'll build some cool stuff later, is kind of becoming more of the norm. And I guess to summarize, I think this kind of heavy model of we're going to create this big NFT project with a roadmap is kind of evaporating in a sense of, okay, no NFTs maybe shouldn't be these ten ETH floor assets. Or maybe not all of them can be these ten ETH floor assets. So let's try to make NFTs that are lighter weight and fun. I mean, to give other quick examples of open editions that's seen a lot of attention.
00:18:44.370 - 00:19:24.106, Speaker A: When Coinbase announced Base, they made an open edition that saw a ton of mints. I know nouns. They minted an ad. And also, I think, WorldCoin. I think those examples are both interesting because it shows a lot of appetite for these assets. But on the other hand, I have wondered if some of the excitement around those three I just mentioned are because people want some sort of token to speculate on. The Base open edition kind of happened in the wake of Base announcing also mentioning there's no token for the Base chain, and then we're going to do an open edition.
00:19:24.106 - 00:19:43.366, Speaker A: I think there was a moment where people thought, oh, I can speculate on this NFT instead. And I think that that also I think Base really tried to stomp that out, but I'm digressing a little bit. But what I'm saying is I think people are now kind of figuring out how to speculate on these lighter weight assets and I think hopefully having a lot of fun along the way.
00:19:43.548 - 00:19:55.286, Speaker B: And I was curious, with a limited edition, typically that meant it was capped at like 10,000 or 7000 or whatever. So in the open editions, how many NFTs are we seeing minted?
00:19:55.478 - 00:19:57.820, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a great question.
00:19:58.190 - 00:20:00.380, Speaker B: Is it a lot more than like 10,000?
00:20:00.990 - 00:20:49.174, Speaker A: Yeah, it often is. So I think usually the most common release format is like a times open edition where, okay, we're going to have a week as many can be mentioned in the week. So for the most successful ones, we've seen anything from 10,000 to I think Coinbase recently had a we stand with crypto charity commemorative NFT that has like hundreds of thousands of mints. I think that people yeah, they see a lot more quantity because I think people like collecting these I guess, like souvenirs or stamps. And it doesn't really matter that there's a huge limit or a huge supply. I think people want to just collect these assets. So that's been an interesting shift.
00:20:49.174 - 00:21:08.222, Speaker A: I also think that maybe we're towards the end of Open Edition season just because gas has been so high and collecting these cheap or free assets became a lot more expensive. But maybe this would be a good time to also talk about where layer twos are going and what that could mean for NFTs. Unless you have more questions on this topic.
00:21:08.286 - 00:21:09.460, Speaker B: No, go ahead.
00:21:10.790 - 00:22:02.274, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I don't have any grand big predictions. I think there's something in the air when I talk to other founders and builders working in the NFT space, I think that layer twos, such as Optimism, such as the upcoming Base, which is also built in Optimism, and there are others, layer twos are potentially about to have a moment. I mean, it's kind of like a knock on wood. This is the summer of layer twos, I think some people have been saying for the past three years or something like that. So I think that it's very possible layer twos will have a moment in the next few months. I know a lot of platforms. I've heard through the grapevine, people are seriously deploying their platforms to optimism, seriously considering base again, those are the top ones I hear about the most.
00:22:02.274 - 00:22:52.274, Speaker A: I think polygon also remains to be a very viable option. And so I think that NFTs, they went from this moment with the apes and the punks of being these really expensive, super desirable luxury assets. And I think the shift we're seeing is they're becoming a lot cheaper. Like, okay, let's just collect something to commemorate this fun moment. And because they're becoming these cheaper assets across the board, it means that the economics of paying $15 to collect $15 in ETH, in transaction fees to collect one of these assets makes a lot less sense now. And so I think layer twos kind of are poised to have a moment alongside the broader shift we're seeing in NFTs. So it remains to be seen.
00:22:52.274 - 00:23:18.554, Speaker A: What I can say is Mint Fun is building towards integrating layer twos, as I mentioned earlier, because high gas and expensive gas is very crushing to this wave of experimentation we're seeing in NFTs. And ultimately, I think the name of our product is Mint Fun. And we think it's important that people can have fun, like collecting crypto and NFTs. So we just want to enable. Yeah.
00:23:18.752 - 00:23:29.200, Speaker B: And so you're adding layer twos on Ethereum, but obviously we've also seen a lot of activity on Salana and Bitcoin for NFTs. So I was curious if you were going to add those chains as well.
00:23:29.890 - 00:24:15.278, Speaker A: So I definitely have been carefully watching ordinals I think that they're potentially one of the most interesting use cases of Bitcoin ever. I mean, I like bitcoin as an asset, but as an application chain, it's definitely not had a ton of huge moments. And ordinals was really awesome. Yeah, the first couple of weeks it launched, I synced a bitcoin node and ran the Ordinal software, did an inscription. It's something that we definitely look at. I think. It's not something that we're going to support right away, but I mean, who knows? I think that as more and more activity moves to bitcoin or even Litecoin, that could be really interesting for us to support.
00:24:15.278 - 00:24:54.460, Speaker A: I think for us, the way we're thinking about it is, okay, all we support is Ethereum mainnet, so we kind of need to build a product around supporting multiple chains and then the conversation gets a lot easier. I actually recently made a dune dashboard. I could maybe link it to you. I tweeted it recently that shows all of the layer two chain NFT activities, and someone kind of thought it was being silly, but I also put bitcoin ordinals like the NFTs. I even excluded the I think people are doing fungible coins on Ordinal. So I excluded BRC 20s. Yeah, the name was escaping me.
00:24:54.460 - 00:25:59.450, Speaker A: I just kind of showed that as a baseline because actually, yeah, there's more activity on bitcoin ordinals for NFT assets than a lot of layer twos right now. And so I have the hunch that just for a number of reasons, because again, I own some ordinals I've interacted with, it's kind of my job, I think, to at least see what's going on. I think we will see more adoption with ethereum layer twos, mostly because I do think bitcoin Ordinals are pretty difficult to use on a number of levels, and I think they're really cool. But it is cool to see people like Magic Eden and other marketplaces support them and build stuff that I think some people didn't even think was possible a few months ago. So it's really exciting because I love experimentation, I love when people have fun. I think what's something that we will probably if we do support it, it'll be a little bit later, but I definitely keep tabs on it. And with Solana NFTs, to be honest with you, I haven't actually done as much digging in Salana with NFTs specifically.
00:25:59.450 - 00:26:28.200, Speaker A: It's just not something we get a lot of requests for. Weirdly enough, we've got more requests for bitcoin Ordinals. It's just when we talk to our users, people care a lot about layer twos. We've even had some requests for Ordinals and things like that. We just haven't seen kind of a broader artist or community on Salana in the same way. But again, I never say just it's probably something we'll support down the line if we do.
00:26:28.890 - 00:26:38.854, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah, I think that wave was really more earlier before Mint Fun was around. All right, Luke, this was a fascinating conversation. Thank you so much for coming on Unchained.
00:26:38.982 - 00:26:40.780, Speaker A: Okay. Thank you, Laura. Great.

Finance commingled Funds Reuters says Finance is being accused by three insiders who allege that the firm commingled customer funds with company revenue in 2000 and 22,021, Reuters reported this week. Though the article cited an insider who said the commingling ran into the billions and happened nearly daily. Reuters saw evidence only for a transaction in February 2021 of $20 million in a Binance corporate account being mixed with $15 million from an account that also had received customer money. Finance spokesperson Brad Jaffe denied the allegations and said the funds were corporate and used for purchasing the BUSD stablecoin.
