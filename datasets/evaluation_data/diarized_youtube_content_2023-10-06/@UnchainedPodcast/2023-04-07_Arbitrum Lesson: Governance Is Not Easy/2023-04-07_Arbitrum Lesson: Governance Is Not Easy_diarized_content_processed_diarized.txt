00:11:25.746 - 00:12:10.114, Speaker B: As they always say, if at first you don't succeed, be a rich dude in crypto. Sue Zoo and Kyle Davies, the founders of the bankrupt crypto hedge fund Three AC, are back. They're launching an exchange for insolvent crypto claims, which feels a little bit like giving people paper cuts and then charging for overpriced bandaids. One of the premises of their company, Open Exchange, is to offer claimants for bankrupt funds like FTX and Celsius the chance to be made whole. Given that FTX claims right now are trading at $0.20 on the dollar, it's possible that their definition of whole is the same as SBF's. The venture successfully raised $25 million from investors, which does make me wonder if the vibe in VC right now is like, what's there to lose? CEO Leslie Lamb has said that the goal of the new fund is to help the crypto industry.

You know that Twitter could be used to issue subpoenas. I didn't. But to me, it's no crazier than the idea that FTX claimants could be made whole.
