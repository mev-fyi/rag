00:00:00.330 - 00:00:02.398, Speaker A: Not a dividend, it's a tale of two fun.
00:00:02.484 - 00:00:05.162, Speaker B: Now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet.
00:00:05.226 - 00:00:07.722, Speaker A: Generally speaking, airdrops are kind of pointless anyways.
00:00:07.866 - 00:00:10.618, Speaker B: Unnamed trading firms who are very involved.
00:00:10.714 - 00:00:12.782, Speaker A: Alec ETH is the ultimate on this.
00:00:12.836 - 00:00:34.130, Speaker B: DeFi protocols are the antidote to this problem. Alright. Hello everybody. Welcome to the chopping block. Every couple weeks, the usually four of us get together and give the industry insiders perspectives on the crypto topics of the day. So we're broadcasting this one live here from Palo Alto. We're all in town for the Stanford Blockchain Conference, so quick intros.
00:00:34.130 - 00:00:57.018, Speaker B: First of all we've got Tom, the DeFi maven and master of Memes. Actually, Tarun couldn't make it today. So Jill is our sand in Tarun, so she is the Empress of Espresso. Thanks for joining us, Jill. And then we've got myself, I'm Haseeb, I'm the head Hype man at Dragonfly. So we are early stage investors in crypto. But I just want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice, legal advice, or even life advice.
00:00:57.018 - 00:01:05.118, Speaker B: So Jill, it's great to see you. It's been a long time since we've seen you in person. I think since the pandemic, we haven't seen you. How's pandemic life been?
00:01:05.204 - 00:01:26.534, Speaker C: It's been pretty good. Yeah. I mean, San Francisco itself, which is where I've been based, it's felt like I've been like the last woman standing in the Bay Area at times. But SBC this week has been so refreshing to have all of the old crowd kind of back in town, be able to see the likes of you guys in person. So that's been great.
00:01:26.652 - 00:01:48.474, Speaker B: I think in a bear market, you need an event like this that is not about hype. Because almost every conference you go to, it's like consensus, permissionless. They're all about like, oh my God, this crazy thing is going to happen. Stanford Blockchain Conference is great because it's slightly sleepy. It's like the people who are there, they're there to give talk. It's mostly researchers and academics.
00:01:48.522 - 00:01:50.110, Speaker C: There's all this gravitas around.
00:01:50.180 - 00:02:00.034, Speaker B: Exactly. So you go up and you're meeting all these Stanford dropouts who are like, I'm starting an Oracle project and blah, blah, blah, and you're just like, okay, yeah, they're still here. People are still doing stuff.
00:02:00.072 - 00:02:10.626, Speaker C: Yeah, there's real stuff happening. It's also just been a nice reminder that you see people in person and generally people are a little toned down from their Twitter personalities.
00:02:10.738 - 00:02:11.222, Speaker B: That's true.
00:02:11.276 - 00:02:26.300, Speaker C: Reddit discord personalities, whatever. And you're just like, yes, there is sanity in this industry and you can relate to these people. It's not just know all of the tomato throwing that you get on social.
00:02:27.470 - 00:02:56.702, Speaker B: It's also, it's weird being around a lot of Stanford kids because there's a lot of Stanford kids at SBC. So many of them are dropouts and it's like, I guess it's like, I mean, you were telling me about this because Tom is also a Stanford kid or was once upon a time back in his. It seems like if you drop out of Stanford, they're just like, oh yeah, of course. Why wouldn't you drop out? You're supposed to drop out of Stanford. What's, like the culture around startups?
00:02:56.766 - 00:03:03.686, Speaker A: Yeah, that's like top tier. Top tier is like, oh, you dropped out, you're too good. And then middle tier is maybe graduating three years.
00:03:03.708 - 00:03:04.262, Speaker B: That's like middle.
00:03:04.316 - 00:03:08.534, Speaker A: Yeah, and then it's like, oh, you're working at a fang startup or fang company or something like that.
00:03:08.572 - 00:03:10.310, Speaker B: Okay? That's like CT.
00:03:10.650 - 00:03:29.758, Speaker A: I was kind of disheartened to learn recently, so I did computer science and it was very popular. As I started to be there, I was talking to some recent CS grads and they said 20% of all the CS grads now are going into product management. And I'm like, I think that's cool, but I would like to see more engineers coming out of the CS department or something like that.
00:03:29.844 - 00:03:31.054, Speaker B: What was it in your day?
00:03:31.172 - 00:03:32.846, Speaker A: Probably like sub 5%.
00:03:32.948 - 00:03:34.786, Speaker B: Sub 5%. Wow.
00:03:34.888 - 00:03:35.954, Speaker C: You did not drop out.
00:03:35.992 - 00:03:40.130, Speaker A: I did not drop out. I'm a loser. I have an undergraduate degree.
00:03:40.870 - 00:03:41.950, Speaker B: Such a nerd.
00:03:42.110 - 00:03:44.290, Speaker C: Me too. And mine's not even from Stanford.
00:03:47.670 - 00:03:59.158, Speaker B: It does feel like product manager at a fang startup is like the new management of consulting. Yes. If you're just like kind of clean cut, respectable, smart, but you don't want to be doing some boring nerdy stuff.
00:03:59.244 - 00:03:59.730, Speaker C: Totally.
00:03:59.810 - 00:04:04.022, Speaker B: Product manager is like the elite job. Especially West Coast.
00:04:04.086 - 00:04:04.650, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:04:04.800 - 00:04:28.514, Speaker B: Although I don't know, now that we're in this broader bear market, I mean, it's not just crypto, obviously, tech is also feeling it. We just saw yesterday, I think we saw Snap, like, lay off 20% of their workforce. Yeah. Which is crazy. So it's pretty dreary all around in tech land. So maybe things will be coming back around. Maybe finance will get hot again.
00:04:28.632 - 00:04:35.542, Speaker C: Although are you guys feeling bullish or bearish on a macro level? Because you ask this of everyone who comes on the show we do.
00:04:35.676 - 00:05:05.710, Speaker B: That is the one question we're known for, is asking, what do I feel about macro? Dude, I don't know. The thing is, I think I had a view on macro that I felt like it was interesting to articulate six months ago. Now everybody knows everything there is to know, right? Like everybody's watching these inflation numbers. Everybody understands that. Okay will the fed pivot Will the Fed not pivot? So I think I have zero alpha in predicting where macro is going to go. What do you think?
00:05:05.860 - 00:05:54.046, Speaker C: I don't know. It is just kind of wild that we've come full circle from sort of the quantitative easing days where everyone was watching the Fed then obviously to see how big the buybacks or whatever were going to be that month. And now here we are watching the Fed try to drain all of that liquidity out of the market. And I feel kind of the same way. I mean, in general, I think that I skew bearish just because it feels like there has been such a pump into the money supply and whatever over the last several years that is only just starting to get mopped up. And again, maybe it's partly living in the Bay Area, but I don't know, my coffee gets more expensive every day still. I've yet to feel like that liquidity is being mopped up out of the market.
00:05:54.046 - 00:06:00.670, Speaker C: But as you say, it's a very unoriginal take at this point. It's just sort of trying to read the Fed tea leaves.
00:06:01.010 - 00:06:25.410, Speaker B: I was bearish on the market back in December, January. I remember telling a lot of our LPs that I think the market's going to turn and things are going to get rough. And at that time I was very proud of myself about Prognosticating, about macro when it was relatively quiet. Now it's just like, I mean, every single one of our LPs is thinking about nobody at this point. Everybody is kind of a macro armchair analyst.
00:06:25.570 - 00:07:12.066, Speaker C: I will say watching the macro environment, especially everyone paying so close attention to Fed speak and all of that, it does kind of renew my hope and faith in these new models that we're creating in crypto because it's very easy sometimes to look at. I don't know, you go on the Maker Governance Forum and you're just like, what the hell is going on here? This is a total show. This is going to be no way to create the future of money. And then you realize we're all hanging on the every word of these suits hanging out in Jackson Hole, and that is driving literally the undulations of the entire global economy. And you're like, all right, you know what, I'll take the Maker Forum. Actually, this is maybe an improvement.
00:07:12.258 - 00:07:26.042, Speaker B: I could see that. It is definitely weird that, okay, the intonation you hear in a speech ends up moving markets by hundreds of billions of dollars at the same time.
00:07:26.096 - 00:07:52.082, Speaker C: All such word cell energy. And I say that as a word cell, but I don't know, I feel like monetary policy, it feels so not based in actual data. Where is that analysis? And I mean, I guess it comes down to the fact that this data is actually very hard to get, let alone clean up and actually analyze and form policy off of. But yeah, I don't know, that's my take.
00:07:52.216 - 00:08:41.234, Speaker B: It's funny because this very much mirrors one of the big stories of the week, which we might as well jump into. So Avalanche ended up going down 20% a single day because of a new story that came out, which is again, not about data, not about numbers, but about a story. So the story I'll give the TLDR because it's kind of a long and kind of winding narrative. But basically what happened was that there's this class action lawyer named Kyle Roche, I think his name, he's kind of one of these like chasing after big class action. A lot of spurious lawsuits against, I think there's one against Binance, there's one against Solana. And so apparently this guy was caught drunk talking to somebody who videoed him just kind of drunkenly rambling who was.
00:08:41.272 - 00:08:43.134, Speaker C: Apparently an associate of Dominic Williams.
00:08:43.182 - 00:09:32.478, Speaker B: Exactly, apparently who was employed in the employ of Dominic Williams, who's like a bitter enemy of Emmy Gonzair, who's the founder of Avalanche. And so it looks like there's some kind of oppositional research because there's some kind of lawsuit that is going on with ICP that Kyle Roche is participating in. It's very vague, there's all these weird innuendos and conspiracies around this stuff. But TLDR so he was caught on film and he basically claimed that he was the attack dog of Avalanche, that he owns a bunch of Avalanche and that he's intentionally suing other people in order to deflect attention away from Avalanche by regulators. Soon after this, basically the Avalanche team came out and said, this is not true. This guy, we use them as an early law firm. He owns some equity because we paid in equity in the very early days back in our seed round.
00:09:32.478 - 00:10:04.810, Speaker B: But we have like twelve law firms. He's just one of them. He's not our primary guy and we definitely don't approve of any of the class action bullshit he's doing. And in fact, the Solana lawsuit that was announced not too long ago, the Avalanche team actually published a blog post against the lawsuit saying that this was a spirit's lawsuit and this is bad for the industry. And then Kyle Roche also went out and said this was opposition research by the ICP guys. The website that leaked this called Cryptoleaks Info is apparently funded by ICP in some way.
00:10:04.960 - 00:10:19.886, Speaker A: It's very blatant. They have three releases and they're all going after people who are going after ICP. And it's like if you want to have sort of like an outlet like that, that know, just trying to know pro news stories, you feel like you'd be a little bit less blatant.
00:10:19.918 - 00:10:44.490, Speaker C: Well, did you notice though, on this latest one, the headline was not about ICP, it was about Solana. Oh, this guy's going after Solana. But then you read through it, I thought that that was kind of a hilarious such a weak attempt to mask the ICP leaning of this crypto leaks website by just putting Solana in the headline.
00:10:45.390 - 00:10:50.746, Speaker B: So it's all very mean. When I initially saw this, I was like, this is such a ridiculous did.
00:10:50.768 - 00:10:51.722, Speaker C: You watch the videos?
00:10:51.856 - 00:10:52.570, Speaker B: I did watch.
00:10:52.640 - 00:11:26.840, Speaker C: It's so painful. It's so painful. I don't know, I felt like, oh my God, I've had so many of these types of conversations with just these, I don't know, people in the industry who want to feel super important and like, okay, maybe they are in the middle of things to some degree, but the ego is what's coming first. They want to flex on you about how much of some token supply they have and how their work is driving the way that the industry is going. You're just like, oh, my God, please.
00:11:27.450 - 00:11:28.870, Speaker B: I know what you mean.
00:11:29.020 - 00:11:32.662, Speaker C: How do I get out of this dinner right now? That was how I felt.
00:11:32.806 - 00:11:35.130, Speaker B: People in crypto love to take credit for things.
00:11:35.200 - 00:11:35.670, Speaker C: Totally.
00:11:35.750 - 00:11:37.302, Speaker B: And magnify their own importance.
00:11:37.366 - 00:11:38.022, Speaker C: Totally.
00:11:38.166 - 00:12:01.278, Speaker B: But look, by and large, so we were early investors into Avalanche. We were early investors into ICP. We own both. This whole thing just seems incredibly stupid to me, and it's grown to such a crazy firestorm. I think Avalanche Price recovered a little bit once the denial started coming out and the market kind of gathered a bit of steam. But I don't know, it feels like we're in a pretty slow Newsweek if this is the main thing that people are excited.
00:12:01.374 - 00:12:43.518, Speaker C: Yeah, no, totally. Totally. But to me, I don't know, I read through the whole thing, and I was like, okay, I don't think, based on reading it, that Avalanche was telling Kyle Roche to go do these things. There didn't seem to be any sort of evidence of that, even in the videos. But it would be totally believable to me that, okay, this guy has some outside stake of some L. One, yes, it is in his personal best interest, whether he's even processing that on a cognitive level or whether it's just subconsciously to go out and cause a bunch of storms around other competitive projects. Like, yes, this is how incentives work.
00:12:43.518 - 00:12:58.962, Speaker C: For an industry that is entirely founded on game theory and incentives, it is bizarre to me that there is, like, I don't know, all of this naysaying that someone may be acting in line with their own incentives. This should not be surprising.
00:12:59.026 - 00:13:03.766, Speaker B: Look, I understand the hatred toward Kyle Roche because for sure, all you have.
00:13:03.788 - 00:13:04.950, Speaker C: To do is watch these videos.
00:13:05.020 - 00:13:33.134, Speaker B: Yeah, he's clearly a douche. And these class action lawyers in general, I don't know, they're like one step removed from injury lawyers or something. Yeah, you can tell when you watch the videos in this guy. He's extremely predatory and kind of just braggadocio, and it's just like, okay, whatever. This is your jam. This is what you do. You find weird plaintiffs and you kind of magnify cases and try to get people in trouble, which is fine, okay.
00:13:33.134 - 00:14:03.706, Speaker B: You got to earn your bread. I get it. But I agree with you. Like, okay, class action lawyer is an apple, and he owns some AVAX. That's the story. And okay, that doesn't seem like much of a story to me, but I think there's a high likelihood that after all of this, this guy might get disbarred or might get some kind of disciplinary action. Just like as a lawyer saying public, I think that one of the big pieces that I think most of the press and most of the users don't care about the users, like this conspiracy that AVAX is pulling the strings and causing all these.
00:14:03.706 - 00:14:30.818, Speaker B: But the thing that I communities love a conspiracy. They do. Now, courts don't necessarily care, right? Because where you get your funding from doesn't matter. But what does matter is that one of the claims he made was that he was using information he got in discovery from filing some of these lawsuits with other L1s and using that, feeding that back to other people. And that's extremely illegal. That's like super not cool. So if he was doing that, he will get in a lot of trouble for that.
00:14:30.818 - 00:14:34.082, Speaker B: But that didn't seem to be the thing that crypto Twitter cared about.
00:14:34.136 - 00:14:35.394, Speaker C: Yeah, that's being highlighted here.
00:14:35.432 - 00:14:42.998, Speaker B: Exactly. So whether or not that's true, I don't know. To me, this feels like probably something that nobody will be talking about in two weeks.
00:14:43.084 - 00:14:44.726, Speaker C: The fact the price moved, what was it?
00:14:44.748 - 00:14:45.766, Speaker B: 20%?
00:14:45.868 - 00:14:48.950, Speaker C: That is massive bonkers. That is insane.
00:14:49.370 - 00:15:02.922, Speaker A: Sometimes it's like just very pure retail reflexivity where everyone's like, oh, this is bad, and therefore other people think it's bad, other people will sell. And it's like you see this around just random miscellaneous news items around different coins as well.
00:15:03.056 - 00:15:04.506, Speaker C: It's greater pool theory on the way.
00:15:04.528 - 00:15:05.614, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly.
00:15:05.732 - 00:15:07.898, Speaker C: Yeah. Totally bizarre.
00:15:08.074 - 00:15:45.782, Speaker B: Anyway, okay, I'm going to make an executive decision to move on because I feel like I've already lost too many brain cells talking about this. So I feel like the other big news has been the continued fallout from Tornado Cash. So, quick reminder, tornado Cash privacy protocol. They were sanctioned by OFAC the Office of Foreign Asset Control. So there have been many differing responses to how people deal with the Tornado Cash sanctions. So we mentioned, I think in our last episode, that right out of the gate, one of the first things that happened was that Circle blocked some of the addresses that were in tornado cache. There was Infura and what was the other one? Alchemy.
00:15:45.782 - 00:16:25.606, Speaker B: Alchemy also blocked API requests to Tornado cache. But the damage has started to grow, started to become more and more people who are increasingly convinced they need to do something to prevent retail users from getting access tornado Cash. One of the things that we've seen is that the natural thought you might have is that, okay, if Infuria is blocking Tornado Cash and Alchemy is blocking Tornado Cash right. Those are two big RPC endpoints people use to interact with the blockchain. Then maybe we need some decentralized RPC endpoints that can give you decentralized API access to the blockchain. Enter in pocket network, which is a decentralized RPC network. That's the idea.
00:16:25.606 - 00:17:05.102, Speaker B: The decentralized Infuria pocket network decided to also block Tornado Cash. We're just like, wait, what? Why are you there then? What are you doing that's different than the centralized ones? So when I saw that, my brain just broke. It was like, why do you exist if you are also blocking Tornado cash. And so Pocket network has blocked Tornado cash. And then we also saw a bunch of drama in Flashbots land. So Flashbots TLDR flashbots is an auction for minor maximal value, minor tractable value, also known as mev. Basically it's a very integral part of the Ethereum kind of mempool these days.
00:17:05.102 - 00:17:45.150, Speaker B: Happens on flashbots. And Flashbots, the company Flashbots, they run the largest relay for these kinds of off chain auctions and their relay now integrates OFAC restrictions. Now apparently it had been integrating OFAC restrictions for a long time, but I can't remember what exactly what the precipitating event was. Maybe they just noticed this at the time of the Tornado sanctions. So they must have updated the OFAC sanctions list. It used to be there was just a bunch of individual addresses that were sanctioned by OFAC that were tied to terrorists or whatever. And now they've added Tornado cash contracts.
00:17:45.150 - 00:18:07.990, Speaker B: So now you cannot send tornado cash interactions through the Flashbots relay. And the last thing along this thread was Ethermine. Ethermine also started one of the big mining pools. They also started blocking tornado cash transactions from their own blocks. So we've seen a lot of different varying responses here's to get your guys thoughts. Tornado cash sanctions widening.
00:18:08.330 - 00:18:15.226, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I think the big complication you're right is it's much simpler to in the past an individual address gets sanctioned, right?
00:18:15.248 - 00:18:15.578, Speaker B: Okay.
00:18:15.664 - 00:18:58.482, Speaker A: This person, this entity can no longer interact with my application. Now it's saying anybody cannot interact with this sanctioned smart contract, which is sort of the precedent that's set. And now it's like for Flashbots, for example, they have to inspect the bundle and say, hey, are you actually doing anything in this transaction that interacts with the smart contract? So it's like a very different precedent. I think the other thing that has been happening over the past few weeks has been different DApps that also run their own front end. So someone like Ave, for example, they build the smart contracts. They also run ave.com. They integrate with services like TRM for example, which maintains sort of compliance tooling for crypto, basically blocking on the front end people who interact with Tornado or people who are one hop from interacting with tornado.
00:18:58.482 - 00:19:14.314, Speaker A: And I think there's been sort of a shitstorm around that of, hey, I get that, maybe I can't, if I've recently used Tornado, maybe use your thing. But even if I'm one hop, which is I think like 30% of all Ethereum addresses or one hop from a Tornado address or two hops from a Tornado address, they can't use that.
00:19:14.352 - 00:19:14.662, Speaker B: Really?
00:19:14.736 - 00:19:15.360, Speaker C: Yes.
00:19:16.370 - 00:19:53.978, Speaker A: Three hops is like 90%, and I think four hops is like 95% or something like that. Someone had a chart. So it's just like, what are we doing here? How reasonable can you sort of expect people to sort of comply? And this is all voluntary as well, right? No one is making them do these things. They're just thinking about, hey, how can I sort of minimize my potential risk? How can I sort of protect myself? Which I empathize with, I think running a front end, you're still taking active service, you're hosting this thing. But it does feel like once you're looking at three hops out from a tornado interaction, it feels very far.
00:19:54.064 - 00:20:29.590, Speaker C: I think it's worth mentioning, though, there are players, at least one major player, if it comes to mind, who is not going the route of risk aversion over compliance. And that, of course, is our good friends over at Tether. I love that you can just always count on Tether to just be like, shooting from the hip, like keeping it Wild West crypto, even though they've also come out and made statements in the past, was like, yes, we work within US regulatory frameworks and we are fully US. Regulatory.
00:20:30.250 - 00:20:39.574, Speaker B: In their defense, they claim that they were in contact with OFAC, with treasury oh, yeah. And that treasury told them, hey, do we need to sanction these? And they were like, yeah.
00:20:39.612 - 00:21:34.070, Speaker C: And I think that look, I'm not a lawyer. I don't understand all of the ins and outs of this. But something that I have come to have a greater appreciation of is that oftentimes OFAC is using sanctions as almost like a negotiating chip or a bargaining tool to try to influence the behavior of the party that's being sanctioned. And so they don't necessarily even want over compliance. Right? They don't want third parties in this case like these on and off ramps or front ends or whatever to be taking steps that they have not been asked to make, right? Because that then starts to influence, like, okay, well, we as OFAC then no longer have this lever to pull because all of know whatever individuals, companies have already pulled that lever for us. That makes sense. So again, I'm not a lawyer.
00:21:34.070 - 00:22:03.790, Speaker C: I'm not one of these Washington DC mucky mucks. But based on my understanding, tether's position may not be totally unreasonable. Again, I just kind of love that they're willing to stand there as sort of the mavericks to be like, no, when we get orders to take certain steps, we will take those. But until then, we're not freezing Tether. That your USDT that has touched the contract.
00:22:03.870 - 00:22:35.018, Speaker B: Well, it's not just that, right? The Tether that's in tornado cash is really tiny. It's like in the short digit thousands of dollars. So relative to, I mean, the overwhelming amount of assets that were in tornado cash were ether and then dai, right? And then there was a little bit of USDC. The tether was like almost nothing, very small amount. One of the things that I think what this whole episode has really demonstrated is that, of course, the day that the sanctions were announced, everyone was scrambling. Nobody knew what to do. Nobody ever seen this before, clearly.
00:22:35.018 - 00:23:01.894, Speaker B: What the hell does it mean that you're sanctioning tornado cash and a set of smart contracts, people. And I think what really happened is that there was probably a snowball in that the first person who decided, okay, we're going to block reads and writes to the contract. The next person act looks at that as like, oh wait, that we're supposed to do? Are we supposed to block reads and writes of the contract? Because if we don't do this, people will look at us and be like, wait, they did it. Why didn't you do it?
00:23:01.932 - 00:23:09.170, Speaker C: And it's a little bit of an outrun. You don't have to outrun the bear, you just have to outrun the last person running from the bear mentality.
00:23:09.250 - 00:23:56.806, Speaker B: Exactly. Now, in the case of Tether, look, I tend to think that Tether got this one right, which is that the way that you deal with sanctioned addresses is that the way you deal with illegal activity generally is that you don't let them cash out. So who cashes people out? The answer is exchanges cash people out. And of course the stablecoin issuers themselves cash people out. But you don't cash out by just transferring tokens, right? There are a lot of tokens that don't ever get cashed out because they're like, look, you can't pass KYC or like, you've done some really shady looking stuff. I'm not going to turn your Tether back into dollars for you. But stopping Tether in circulation in some way, that's kind of forcing every single layer of the financial stack to enforce sanctions, which we don't do.
00:23:56.806 - 00:24:40.386, Speaker B: We don't do that in the normal system, right? In the normal system, that's right. Swift does not enforce sanctions. Your bank enforces sanctions. Right? We don't tell the Swift Network, which is an international and supposed to be kind of apolitical system, we don't tell Swift to enforce sanctions. We also don't tell your browser to enforce sanctions. So when your browser can tell, oh, you're sending stuff to a sanctioned entity, your browser doesn't try to figure that out and nobody tries to go sue Google Chrome because, oh, you let the sanctioned person interact with a browser to do banking stuff, right? We realize that it's stupid and counterproductive to try to enforce sanctions at all of these layers. You pick one that is the right layer at which to enforce sanctions and you leave everything else alone.
00:24:40.498 - 00:25:09.182, Speaker C: So I agree with all that. But at the same time, I can also totally empathize with people who are running companies, who have fiduciary duties to their investors to make sure that the company can still keep running and doing business in maybe its largest market in the United States. And also who, on a personal level, are like shit OFAC like, 30 years in prison. As much as I believe in the space OFAC is not going to put.
00:25:09.236 - 00:25:36.422, Speaker B: An RPC endpoint into prison for 30 years, I want to push back on this, right? That's bullshit OFAC might fine you like 5000 $10,000 because like, oh, you should have done this. We don't know. We don't know ether scan. Okay? Ether scan still lets you read the Tornado Cash contract. Inferior won't let you read it. Inferior won't even let you look at it. You want to ask what is the state of Tornado Cash contract? Inferior says off.
00:25:36.476 - 00:25:41.618, Speaker C: We can talk about the layers of over compliance here because I agree, I think that there are layers of overcompliance.
00:25:41.714 - 00:25:48.986, Speaker B: If that's true for Inferior, why is it not also true for Etherscan? Etherscan lets you read, it also lets you write. You can go connect your web3 endpoint in Ether scan and interact with.
00:25:49.008 - 00:26:02.942, Speaker C: A contract different comfort levels with the risk that you're taking. Again, that's not just about facing potentially 30 years of prison time. Although, let's be honest, I mean Jeremy Alair, the CEO of Circle, called that out directly in his Tweet thread about this.
00:26:02.996 - 00:26:03.406, Speaker B: Right.
00:26:03.508 - 00:26:06.754, Speaker C: That is a real consideration, I think, if you're Jeremy. But it is also very different story.
00:26:06.792 - 00:26:08.174, Speaker B: Than if you're an RPC endpoint.
00:26:08.302 - 00:26:42.678, Speaker C: Sure. But it is also about your business model and your considerations to your board, to your investors, all of these things. And I don't know much about the business around Etherscan itself, but knowing what I do know about Ether scan doesn't surprise me that there would be very different considerations and very different line drawn about the comfort level versus is infuria a US domiciled company. They are, yeah, that has a very real substantial business model around them that I know has sort of like Ethospn.
00:26:42.694 - 00:27:04.786, Speaker B: Also does business in the US. Of course, because we're of course a massive market and there's a lot of customers here. But I mean, look, obviously one difference might be why they're Domiciled. Another big difference is that one has a front end, the other doesn't. One is API based. Ethercan also has an API, but mostly we think of it as a front end web application. To me this is like a distinction without a difference.
00:27:04.786 - 00:27:49.342, Speaker B: At the end of the day, both of them let you read and write to smart contracts, right? If you tell Etherscan, hey, why are you guys allowing people to see the front end of Tornado Cash when all these other people have complied? All these other people understand the precedent that we've all set as an industry, which is that you pretend Tornado Cash doesn't exist. Somebody sends you something about trainer cash, you drop it doesn't even matter. You are complicit because of the fact that you facilitated the transaction by forwarding it along to the Mempool or just reporting even the state of the trainer cash contract. To me that's a crazy interpretation of all this stuff. And so this brings us also to Eric Wall. So Eric Wall brought up the idea which know, the Ether mine thing. So Ethermind has started to block ofax restricted things.
00:27:49.342 - 00:28:00.834, Speaker B: And there's funny, a long time ago there was. A bitcoin mining company. What was the company? Marathon, I think it was Marathon that proudly announced that they were starting to do OFAC compliant block mining.
00:28:00.882 - 00:28:02.018, Speaker C: Gosh, I'd forgotten that's.
00:28:02.034 - 00:28:06.246, Speaker B: Right. So there was a press and then they backed off from it because they were like, wow, that was stupid. Never mind, we're not going to do that.
00:28:06.268 - 00:28:07.622, Speaker C: This is not a cool marketing move.
00:28:07.676 - 00:28:10.122, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. Nobody's excited about us now.
00:28:10.176 - 00:28:11.020, Speaker C: Back now.
00:28:12.270 - 00:28:57.890, Speaker B: So Ethermine was the first to start. Ethermind? I think they're European, right? Yeah, I believe they're European. I believe they're European mining firm or a mining pool. So Ethermine was the first to start blocking to cash addresses in their pools. And as we're moving into the transition to proof of stake, which is coming up very soon, the question started to get asked, okay, are there going to be now OFAC compliant Validators? That the Validators will themselves start blocking transactions from people interacting with OFAC sanctioned addresses, contracts? Now we've not seen that before. That's a totally new concept that you would start enforcing. The natural idea behind blockchains is that they're censorship resistant.
00:28:57.890 - 00:29:32.978, Speaker B: Meaning that even if there is one miner out there somewhere that's willing to include your transactions that you will eventually get into a block. You might not get into the first block because maybe the next person who mines is OFAC compliant, but the fifth, 6th, 7th person who mines a block, they're in Tanzania or something and they'll mine your block. So in proof of stake land, what we've seen is that there's a huge amount of concentration of the stake in a small number of players. Right. So Lido obviously, which is a consortium. So there are a bunch of underlying miners there or Validators there. Of course, Coinbase is going to be huge, binance can be huge, kraken is going to be huge.
00:29:32.978 - 00:30:45.190, Speaker B: And there's maybe good reason to believe these Validators will think like, look, I definitely cannot be violating OFAC the question is, is including a transaction into a block violating OFAC am I facilitating the violation of sanctions by including things into a block? So Brian Armstrong came out and said, look, we're not going to do this if our lawyers told us that there was no way to run a Validator without violating OFAC restrictions, we'd have to censor we would either not run a Validator at all or we'd find some other solution. Right. So he's kind of vague about what that might mean, but okay, maybe there's some way to outsource it or something. So Eric Wall brought up this notion that I think people hadn't been talking about so much about, okay, well how do you actually enforce this norm? How do you enforce the norm of the idea that, hey, businesses by default are going to be risk averse because they have a lot to lose, they're scared of jail time, they're scared of fines, whatever. And so for them it's like, look, it's not like I really care whether or not I include tornado cash transactions. There's not a lot of money in that. So I would much rather take 99% of the reward and take 0% of the risk and just be OFAC compliant.
00:30:45.190 - 00:31:28.440, Speaker B: That is the game. Theoretic equilibrium is to just say, okay, well of course you just don't tell everyone becomes OFAC compliant. And the question is how do you stop that as a community, as a culture? And Eric Wall's answer to that is like well, we have this concept that we haven't touched in a very long time of what's called social slasher. It's basically the idea that we decide to hard fork the network and delete this person's stake because they were doing something that is not in line with ethereum principles. And this kind of started up this conversation about hey, maybe this is the only tool that the community really has to change the dynamic such that the default doesn't become ethereum is OFAC compliant by default. What do you guys think about this.
00:31:30.730 - 00:33:18.182, Speaker C: Is, okay, firstly, I think that the idea of social slashing itself is problematic because okay, well then how do you get to consensus on who the bad guys are? Here the thing that gets missed. And I think that this goes to your point around pocket network and all of these other sort of decentralized systems that like oh, now you're censoring stuff. A decentralized system doesn't mean nobody controls it and now it's just running out there and it cannot be censored. And all of these things that we want to believe it means, all it means is that there's a network of nodes coming to consensus about what reality and the source of truth is. And you wind up at the same quagmire if you institute something like social slashing because you again have to come to consensus about, okay, well then who's getting slashed, how do we fork this? And so on and so forth. So I think that it's problematic on that level. I also just think that this is just classic case of technologists wanting to technologize it's like how do we actually approach this as an industry? How do we actually solve this problem? Well we go in and we make sure that lawmakers and folks in Congress staffers on the Hill, we make sure that Treasury Department all of these folks are educated about what is tech stack and what is sort of equivalent of a Swift like system here, just running, processing a payments network versus what has I think the word is like, specific intent behind it to enable things like money laundering.
00:33:18.182 - 00:33:49.906, Speaker C: And we're going to have to figure out as an industry sort of where exactly that line gets drawn. But I think that it's pretty clear that things like running nodes should be in the category of like this is tech stack. This should not be touched by financial regulation and enforcement and there are all kinds of other areas like the on and off ramps of the front ends and so I guess that's where kind of my sort of in the background my eye rolls over here.
00:33:50.088 - 00:33:54.040, Speaker B: Stop that. Right. So we're already there now we could have argued about this.
00:33:54.570 - 00:34:00.570, Speaker C: We're already there in the sense that okay, Ethermine is leaving transactions out of their blocks.
00:34:02.670 - 00:34:06.778, Speaker B: Once Coinbase is like the single biggest miner or validator on Ethereum what do.
00:34:06.784 - 00:34:25.102, Speaker C: You think is going to mean? Maybe I'm naive but I back. Maybe not Brian himself but the legal team around him to do that engagement and know find the merge is in two weeks.
00:34:25.236 - 00:34:27.634, Speaker B: Clean tells me that treasury is not going to give them an answer within.
00:34:27.672 - 00:34:35.780, Speaker C: Two weeks for sure. Is your position that in two weeks time they're going to be leaving tornado cash transactions out?
00:34:37.030 - 00:34:47.526, Speaker B: Very high likelihood. Very high likelihood. Because I just give you the calculus right? Like why you're a public company. Yeah they're not but we also just.
00:34:47.548 - 00:34:53.130, Speaker C: Had this whole conversation about over compliance. Coinbase is the tether approach.
00:34:53.950 - 00:35:24.066, Speaker B: I mean Coinbase is like they weren't always yes in the very early days they're the only public company in crypto. Of course they're going to respect OFAC restrictions when they're mining blocks. Right. Because when you're validating a block that means you're literally getting paid by the person who's violating sanctions. Right. They are sending you fees. So if there's anything that you could argue this thing is violating would that.
00:35:24.088 - 00:35:26.770, Speaker C: Be your position on it? I'm really surprised.
00:35:27.190 - 00:35:28.898, Speaker B: Again my position is that this should.
00:35:28.904 - 00:35:31.394, Speaker C: All be I would say this is tech stack this is neutral.
00:35:31.442 - 00:35:42.762, Speaker B: I agree with that. I agree with that. But what do you think? That is what I guarantee you their lawyers will be telling them we are accepting payments from people who are violating sanctions. That's what their lawyers will be telling them. We cannot do that.
00:35:42.816 - 00:35:48.650, Speaker C: We'll see. I'll take the other side of that I want to follow up into okay come back on the show.
00:35:48.720 - 00:36:27.726, Speaker A: I think of it a little bit sort of like an analog like I think about sort of comping it to Tor. Right. And it's like if you run a Tor exit node you might get rated by the police at some point because someone's accessing some illegal content or whatever off of your node but you're not liable for that. Right. And why is that the case? It's because you literally cannot inspect the content that you're relaying and the request that you're relaying it's completely private. And so speaking of technologists I think that might be a more constructive use of people's energy and time is like speaking to Miss Espresso here. I think it's like looking for better scalable solutions for private transactions.
00:36:27.726 - 00:37:25.046, Speaker A: And I think privacy again privacy has had this really long difficult journey in crypto to go through the entire history. But it's always had this difficult part where people don't want to pay for privacy. And it's like, privacy from whom? Generally in the past, it's been other people looking at your transactions on chain. Maybe the story here is, hey, if the compliance burden for these validators starts to get so high, the privacy is almost like a requirement in order to get your transaction mined, period, right? It's not that some transactions need this, some transactions don't, but it's just like, yeah, if you're coming from a particular IP, if you're trying to interact with a particular address, I can see sort of this bar continuing to get higher for what is a valid transaction and what's not. And maybe the only solution now is just completely remove that even censorship ability by making the validators not able to think about what is a valid transaction.
00:37:25.158 - 00:38:21.790, Speaker C: Thank you for bringing us back to constructive territory there, because we're about to get into fisticuffs over what's maybe going to happen with Coinbase in two weeks. Yeah, I do have a tendency to sort of go off on like these are all human problems. But I do think that you're right that there are constructive ways to think about technological solutions to some of this. I don't think it's going to solve what's happening here specifically with Ethereum with the merge in a couple of weeks time. But I do think longer term, something that has just become super obvious to me over the course of the last few weeks with all of this fallout is the importance of not only transactional privacy, but also the importance of application layer privacy. And this is something that we've been talking about at Espresso now for like a year and a half. It's something that the folks at Alio have really spearheaded as well.
00:38:21.790 - 00:39:46.262, Speaker C: We're not the only ones working on this. The concept is called decentralized private computation. Howard Wu and company out of Berkeley primarily, and again working on Alio now kind of spearheaded this with their work on Zexi, and we've built off of that at Espresso. What it does is it enables you to achieve again not only transaction level privacy, which you could achieve, obviously on ethereum with something like tornado cash, where nodes and validators and the general public wouldn't be able to go and see who you're sending to whom. But it would also mean that actually, what applications are being called, what smart contracts are being called, will also be obfuscated and obfuscated even from Validators. And look, I think that what you're painting is kind of a worst case scenario here of Ethereum is just fucked because Coinbase decides to go with what are people calling it, USA chain instead of ETH main chain, and we wind up with this crazy fork of realities. But in a way, it's also, ironically, perhaps the future that we are kind of building for, or at least a possibility that we're kind of building for with Espresso and with, again, DPC or decentralized private computation, the ability to mask what applications are being called.
00:39:46.262 - 00:40:26.062, Speaker C: And I think that that's what the next generation of blockchains are going to look like. I think that Ethereum is going to have to find these types of solutions at some point down the line. Because I agree, Tom plausible deniability is, I think, the best defense in all of these cases. Now. Do I also hope and think that we will be able to fight the good fight and keep nodes and validators on the tech stack side of things, at least for the foreseeable future? Yes, for sure. But I think it's important that we also have that more constructive and I think realistic conversation outside of social slashing about the technological.
00:40:26.126 - 00:40:34.406, Speaker B: It seems like the tornado OFAC restrictions, they've definitely struck fear in the hearts of a lot of privacy builders that I've been chatting with.
00:40:34.428 - 00:40:34.982, Speaker C: Oh, for sure.
00:40:35.036 - 00:40:37.586, Speaker B: Where people are just like, okay, well, what tornado is illegal?
00:40:37.618 - 00:40:44.666, Speaker C: Even though it's fully not to mention the guy who got arrested in the Netherlands. That's right, by the way, who still.
00:40:44.688 - 00:41:25.046, Speaker B: Don'T know exactly no charges. They extended his holding period for another 90 days, which is insane. So it's scary. A lot of privacy folks I know are scared because they're just like, what are the rules? Are you saying privacy is illegal if you're not? What are you saying? So you see, actually FTX, so Aztec, which is privacy L2, FTX started blocking Aztec, which Aztec? I mean, basically it's not a mixer by any meaningful sense. It's just like a private pool. The same way that Zcash might be that also allows you to interact with DeFi. So how are you guys thinking about that given the stance that OFAC has taken against, at least nominally against the notion of privacy as being something that you're allowed to engage in.
00:41:25.148 - 00:42:46.366, Speaker C: Yeah, no, totally. So we have one product that's in market only on Ethereum's testnet. And so in a way we are in a privileged position that at know sort of Waller development time know, getting us towards mainnet we can start to work out some of this and some of where we again as a company with shareholders and all of these considerations, and I as someone who's living in the United States and what have you, where we're going to be comfortable drawing a line. I don't envy the companies that have these live products that are now facing this storm in real time with my senses. Pretty limited communications from these really important kingmakers and gatekeepers, these exchanges and whatnot that are just sort of, it seems like arbitrarily blocking them. But the way that we're thinking about it and the way that we've been approaching privacy from the outset is to say, all right, we want to deliver to developers and deliver to end users the tools to be able to choose what stays private, to whom and under what circumstances. And so I think the best kind of example to explain this that I often turn to is, let's say you're a stablecoin provider, right? And let's say you're one of these risk averse stablecoin providers.
00:42:46.366 - 00:43:48.014, Speaker C: You're not tether who's happy, again, to kind of play a little fast and loose, and I think the industry needs that too. But you're a relatively risk averse stablecoin provider. You want to start enabling merchant payments and b to b payroll and supply chain payments and all of these types of things. And in order to do that, in order to just meet basic user needs, you need to implement some level of privacy for them. Right? Now, those types of players are obviously not, by and large, looking for sort of government level privacy, right? They're totally comfortable with whether it's Circle or another stablecoin provider, paxos, whatever, still having insight into their transactions. They just don't want all of their competitors to know about all of this stuff. And so you, as the stablecoin provider, can then build that into either a wrapper for your existing ERC 20 token or a brand new token contract and say, okay, we can see everything that's going on with these payments.
00:43:48.014 - 00:44:25.406, Speaker C: No one else can see anything that's going on. You can get more granular than that. You can say, okay, above $3,000, which I think is the travel rule threshold, which is this guidance around at what point you have to start reporting KYC information and stuff. Above $3,000, we can see everything that's going on for more de minimis payments, nobody can see anything, blah, blah, blah. You can get into having all of these kind of granular, fine tuned controls. Now, my personal kind of philosophy around all of this, and a lot of people hear that, to be clear, and they're like, you're building backdoors. You're a freaking narc.
00:44:25.406 - 00:44:34.334, Speaker C: Why are you doing this? Well, that's still much better privacy than you can get on the Ethereum main chain today, right? That's still a huge improvement.
00:44:34.382 - 00:44:34.786, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:44:34.888 - 00:45:32.626, Speaker C: If you do care about privacy. Again. My personal philosophy on this is that we should be building more privacy tools in general is that commercialization is a big part of the fight for keeping privacy as something that we can all have as a protected right. That being able to demonstrate, like, look, there are legit uses going on here of this technology in general and of privacy approaches to it. I think all of that helps, and I think it helps move the overton window away from where we are today, which is that everything needs to be transparent to everyone all the time. But being in the trenches of how to actually roll that out and implement it in these circumstances where everything is so uncertain is a very scary thing. And our code base is open source.
00:45:32.626 - 00:46:31.590, Speaker C: I've had engineers on the team ping me, mostly, thankfully, ping our general counsel, not me asking like, I have no control over this is zero knowledge privacy tech. I have no control over whether someone copies and pastes some of this and goes and implements it in a way that we are totally not comfortable with it. And how is that going to come back on me? So, yeah, it is a very scary time. It's very uncertain. But again, I think that in a way we are in a more comfortable position. Not only because we're only on testnet right now, although Main Net coming soon, but also because we are taking this more kind of, I think, nuanced approach to privacy as opposed to having positioned ourselves and kind of backed ourselves into this corner of like we believe in all private all the time and then having to walk back from that. I think that's a really hard place to be right now.
00:46:31.660 - 00:46:57.598, Speaker B: It is. And it's where a lot of the kind of gen one privacy coins and kind of the more cypherpunk original Ethos was in crypto. So you look like the Moneros and the Zcash. They're like, no, screw you guys, come and take it kind of energy. And it does feel like that's not going to age well in the era of OFAC restrictions. The idea that, okay, well, tornado sanctioned by default. If you interact with it, you're a bad dude.
00:46:57.774 - 00:46:58.574, Speaker C: Totally.
00:46:58.702 - 00:47:08.150, Speaker B: And the interesting thing now you mentioned about the secondary, which I didn't know, the front ends that start blocking you if you're one hop removed or two hops removed from tornado.
00:47:09.290 - 00:47:20.610, Speaker C: Is that going back in history, by the way? Post sanction? Okay, I'm like, do I not access my because vitalik interacted with totally.
00:47:20.690 - 00:47:44.766, Speaker B: But of course it's such an obviously broken concept because it opens up the ability to grief. Anybody, because anybody can just go put 0.1 ETH in tornado cash, send it to anyone, and now that person can't use anything in DeFi because the whole point of trainer is that you can't tell who sent it. Right? It breaks the link. So somebody who's using trainer cash to launder money looks identical to somebody who's getting griefed by getting sent .1 E.
00:47:44.788 - 00:48:05.526, Speaker C: It is funny how it brings out all of these potentially fundamental flaws. We have not really given any thought, I feel, like, on a product front as an industry, to the fact that you can just send and there's no sort of notion of like, right. Was it Grin that had the whole thing where you had that's true.
00:48:05.708 - 00:48:08.342, Speaker B: Which is a very bad UX because you have to be online. You have to be online.
00:48:08.396 - 00:48:13.398, Speaker C: Totally. Yeah, no, it was a terrible UX. But it is interesting that you can.
00:48:13.404 - 00:48:31.018, Speaker B: Decide model makes it cleaner because then it's like, okay, this one, this is the money I got sent for generic cash. I will leave that over there. I'm definitely use it in ethereum, right? It's all just one big pile of ether that looks like the same. We also don't have a standardized way. Like, let's say you do get griefed. Someone does send you 0.1 ETH.
00:48:31.018 - 00:48:47.422, Speaker B: How do you be like, no, that's not mine. Do you burn 0.1 ETH and then does TRM pick that up? Does Chainalysis pick that up? Do you send it to a different address? Does TRM understand that we don't know what you're supposed to do? There's no playbook.
00:48:47.486 - 00:48:47.902, Speaker C: Totally.
00:48:47.966 - 00:49:30.034, Speaker B: So treasury just jumped all this stuff on us, probably had no idea how the industry was going to react, and now we're all setting these stupid precedents that everyone else is copying because they're like, oh, well, if Infuria did that, they probably better lawyers than I do. So I'll just do whatever Infuria did and as a result, we end up in this moronic equilibrium. And now we have to talk about social slashing, which is why, to be clear bring it back to social slashing. Okay? Bring it back to social slashing. I tend to agree with Eric. I tend to agree with Eric that I think at some point you need a sort of revolt of the public so that people know ethereum is not run by corporations. It feels like it is.
00:49:30.034 - 00:49:43.366, Speaker B: It certainly seems like it is. It seems like Etherscan, Infura and Coinbase have the real say over what right. And like, I feel like Ethereum has not really had that SegWit moment when you realize, like, wait, no, I thought.
00:49:43.388 - 00:49:47.560, Speaker C: That was a very apt comparison that he drew to the SegWit moment.
00:49:50.190 - 00:50:01.694, Speaker B: Users matter and the users are very clear and unanimous in what they believe, which is that Ethereum should not censor are they you think there's people are divided on that?
00:50:01.732 - 00:50:08.366, Speaker C: I genuinely don't know. Certainly the loudest voices on Twitter are very I mean, who do you think.
00:50:08.388 - 00:50:12.574, Speaker B: On Ethereum is pro OFAC restrictions in Ethereum itself?
00:50:12.772 - 00:50:37.542, Speaker C: I think that there are a lot of people who use this stuff as speculative asset as a fun, cool, new way to fuck around on the internet and playing around with NFTs the same way that I played around. With Neopets when whatever back in the think that there are all of these sort of emergent ecosystems of end users who don't give a about.
00:50:37.596 - 00:50:39.002, Speaker B: I agree with that. Okay, they don't care.
00:50:39.056 - 00:50:42.150, Speaker C: Libertarian resistant.
00:50:42.230 - 00:50:48.506, Speaker B: Most people don't care. But the question is, do they want the restrictions? Is there anybody who wants I think.
00:50:48.528 - 00:51:27.506, Speaker C: That there are a lot of folks both within the ethereum user base right now and also who could be within the ethereum user base but are not because they're uncomfortable with some of these dynamics around. Like, there's even people who are very sophisticated and spend all day on this stuff. Many have the misunderstanding rather that if I deposit funds into tornado cash, I might be withdrawing North Korean funds. I'm uncomfortable with that. Or I'm contributing to the privacy pool for uniswap.
00:51:27.698 - 00:51:30.482, Speaker B: If you put money in Uniswap, you might also trade with North Korea.
00:51:30.546 - 00:51:31.010, Speaker C: Totally.
00:51:31.090 - 00:51:32.562, Speaker B: Like, nothing in crypto.
00:51:32.706 - 00:51:38.406, Speaker C: That's not even true. With tornado cash. If I deposit in tornado cash, I can only pull out my own deposit.
00:51:38.438 - 00:51:43.050, Speaker B: This feels to me like something you solve with education, not with enforcing sanctions at the network.
00:51:44.510 - 00:51:46.294, Speaker C: Like, to me, this seems like that.
00:51:46.352 - 00:51:54.842, Speaker B: SegWit as well, right? SegWit? Most people didn't care. Most people didn't even know what SegWit means. SegWit was just like a big rallying cry for people to fight on Twitter, right? Most people have no clue.
00:51:54.906 - 00:52:02.530, Speaker C: I remember spending hours trying to educate myself as to what it just seemed like the cool thing to be fighting.
00:52:03.430 - 00:52:45.598, Speaker B: You just have an opinion about this very technical question of whether segregated witnesses in Bitcoin and whether the block size will do this or that. And in retrospect, it was a philosophical and political and religious battle that was ultimately being waged in Bitcoin, and we have not had that in Ethereum since the Dow Fork, which was a long time ago. And this feels to me like as close as you can get to the spirit of what blockchains are about, which is that is there a monopoly by one country's interest, which look, I'm an American. I love America. I think America is awesome. I think the OFAC restrictions on tornado are stupid, but I think the restrictions on the other things that they sanctioned make total sense that you probably should sanction the Lazarus group. You probably should.
00:52:45.684 - 00:52:47.486, Speaker C: The difference being that they sanction the address.
00:52:47.508 - 00:53:14.554, Speaker B: Sanctioning the address. And we've talked at nauseam about why we think it's a bad idea. Even if you think that, look, if you sanction tornado cash, it may be reasonable for exchanges and kind of off ramps and things like that to prevent people from cashing out with tornado cash. All that aside, should the network basically be ingratiated to treasury into OFAC? I think the answer is be. The network should be distinct from that the same way that the Internet does not enforce US sanctions, which is why.
00:53:14.592 - 00:53:16.646, Speaker C: We need to go and educate policymakers.
00:53:16.678 - 00:53:27.466, Speaker B: I agree with that. I agree with that. But this is happening now. It's happening in two weeks from now. There's not enough time to educate people. Like, at some point, ethereum can't rely on American lawmakers.
00:53:27.498 - 00:53:29.242, Speaker C: Just don't overcomply, folks.
00:53:29.386 - 00:53:44.654, Speaker B: I agree with it, but no one's listening to me. Look at the point which people have already overcomplied. Like, Daniel, how do you stop someone from overcomplying? The answer is that there needs to be a stick. There's only carrot for over compliance, right? Which is that there's no risk, nothing bad happens, and I don't lose any revenue.
00:53:44.702 - 00:53:45.550, Speaker C: There is a stick.
00:53:45.630 - 00:53:47.470, Speaker B: You need to make it. What's the stick?
00:53:47.630 - 00:53:52.354, Speaker C: I mean, Brian Armstrong acknowledged it. I think even that said something on Twitter.
00:53:52.402 - 00:53:54.422, Speaker B: What does that mean? I mean, let's see what happens in two weeks.
00:53:54.476 - 00:53:56.230, Speaker C: You've got this wry smile going on.
00:53:56.300 - 00:54:17.294, Speaker A: No, I agree. I think ultimately it's like the market will know there's nothing stopping anyone from making Fed chain today or a year ago or anything like that, but there was not that pressure. Also commenting a little bit of like the e proof of workfork. It's like, yeah, I guess you could do that. Will anyone use it? Will the market respond to it?
00:54:17.332 - 00:54:17.630, Speaker B: Maybe?
00:54:17.700 - 00:54:20.974, Speaker A: I don't know. I think it's sort of on happened.
00:54:21.012 - 00:54:24.078, Speaker C: With the Dow back and so I.
00:54:24.084 - 00:54:33.090, Speaker A: Think it's like, sure, maybe you could employ social slashing, but it's sort of on you to convince the people who matter in the market that this is the way to go forward.
00:54:33.240 - 00:55:09.946, Speaker B: But look, I think even the conversation scares people, right? Because if you're like, look, if there's a 20% chance that our ETH gets flat, we have a lot of ETH at Coinbase that is a much bigger risk to our business than that. We don't run staking and make a little bit of yield or whatever. We outsource it to some other party, right? Or we just put in DFI and get some more yield. So just the conversation alone is enough to do a lot of the work to scare people because the concept of social slashing obviously is a coherent one. And if people realize, look, the community, the core community believes this, right, it won in bitcoin. It's not too late to say the same thing. Can win in ethereum.
00:55:09.946 - 00:55:52.986, Speaker B: Now, it's certainly true that it's not true that two forks will be viable. If you have a minority fork in Ethereum, that minority fork will die on arrival the same way that the Ethpath fork will die on arrival. But if there's enough of a movement internally that starts generating pressure, these guys will roll over very quickly if they think that there's real energy there because they can't risk it. They can't risk getting slashed for that amount of money relative to the relatively small awards because most of the stake rewards they pay out to their customers, they don't keep it for themselves, they take a small spread. So to me, that's why I think you can't just say like, well, okay, let's rely on the blockchain association to go talk to lawmakers. In the meantime, Ethereum will just do it.
00:55:53.008 - 00:55:55.200, Speaker C: I think it's got to be all of the above, right?
00:55:56.210 - 00:55:57.134, Speaker B: I agree with that.
00:55:57.252 - 00:56:29.382, Speaker C: To come back and be like conciliatory here, but very genuinely too. I do think that it's got to be all of the above and I think that the conversations that are playing out are important and healthy. I am myself deeply skeptical of how social slashing would actually be implemented and I'm very skeptical of the fact that you just would wind up back at the same problem of like, well, who's creating social consensus around the social slashing then? Right, but I'm not against the debate happening.
00:56:29.516 - 00:56:31.530, Speaker B: Yeah. The debate, I think, alone does a lot of work.
00:56:31.600 - 00:56:31.978, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:56:32.064 - 00:56:54.350, Speaker B: And at the end of the day, somehow these norms need to be in place. Because they can't just be like it's kind of like when Trump came into office and started doing all this crazy stuff that nobody had ever you kind of expected, like, okay, well, every president before has released their tax returns. And he was like, I'm not going to do it. How do we stop you from doing that?
00:56:54.420 - 00:56:55.626, Speaker C: How do we social slash?
00:56:55.658 - 00:57:18.822, Speaker B: Yeah, how do we social slash the president? And the answer is, there's no social slashing for the president. Well, it's like, okay, well, we know what happens, which is that the overton window just expands slowly, push by push, until at certain point, we're just like, wait, we're like in this tiny little enclosure now. And Ethereum is just like, compliance itself into becoming this totally different thing than what started.
00:57:18.876 - 00:58:08.620, Speaker C: As I just come back to you need to be waging this war on all fronts. You need folks like Tether to be comfortable taking risks. And like Coinbase in this situation, too. You need Coinbase to be comfortable taking on a little bit more risk than they might otherwise be comfortable with because there's pressure from the community and all of this. You need to be engaging in Washington and Brussels and wherever, I think, you know, to the point around even developing the idea of social slashing, to the point of developing things like decentralized private computation Zexi. You do need to be fighting on the technological front, but all of these things, as you like, they have these very different timeframes. Like, DPC is not coming in the next two weeks, two months even.
00:58:08.620 - 00:58:23.100, Speaker C: We're not going to solve the legal thing in the next two weeks either. And so, yeah, I think you need to keep some faith that some of these actors, anyway, will be down to go risk on.
00:58:23.710 - 00:58:29.294, Speaker B: I hope so. I hope so. It's hard to be it's rare that.
00:58:29.332 - 00:58:30.622, Speaker C: I'm the optimist in the room.
00:58:30.676 - 00:58:31.440, Speaker B: I know.
00:58:32.290 - 00:58:34.094, Speaker C: I'm impressed that he's a weird place to be.
00:58:34.132 - 00:58:41.778, Speaker B: I am usually, like defending the man. Yeah, defending the man, which is good. It's a good place to be. Very diplomatic tone for a private is.
00:58:41.784 - 00:58:44.626, Speaker C: That why you separated me? That is yeah.
00:58:44.648 - 00:58:47.870, Speaker B: We've got the Crypto people and then we got the man over. Kidding.
00:58:47.950 - 00:58:50.102, Speaker C: Yeah. That's going to be my intro next time I come on.
00:58:50.156 - 00:58:50.582, Speaker B: That's right.
00:58:50.636 - 00:58:52.454, Speaker C: Got Jill Gunter. The man.
00:58:52.652 - 00:59:11.840, Speaker B: The man. Okay, well, I think we're up on time. Jill, thanks so much for coming on and sharing with us your totally wrong views about privacy and compliance. It's been another interesting week in Cryptoland. Thank you to all of you for tuning in, and we'll see you in a couple weeks. Take care, everybody.
