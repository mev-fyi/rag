00:00:00.250 - 00:00:12.734, Speaker A: Token economics can do way less than the industry on the whole has claimed that it's able to do. And so, for the most part, I sort of consider token economics to be a little bit of a dirty word today compared to how I saw it two years ago.
00:00:12.852 - 00:00:15.082, Speaker B: Not a dividend, it's a tale of two quan.
00:00:15.146 - 00:00:17.754, Speaker A: Now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet.
00:00:17.802 - 00:00:20.362, Speaker C: Generally speaking, airdrops are kind of pointless anyways.
00:00:20.506 - 00:00:23.210, Speaker A: Unnamed trading firms who are very involved.
00:00:23.290 - 00:00:25.826, Speaker B: Alec Eat is the ultimate DeFi.
00:00:25.858 - 00:00:28.440, Speaker D: Protocols are the antidote to this problem.
00:00:29.770 - 00:00:45.622, Speaker A: Hello, everybody. Welcome to the chopping block. Every couple weeks, the four of us get together and give the industry insider's perspective on the crypto topics of the day. So, quick intros. First we got Tom, the DeFi maven and master of Memes. Next we've got Robert the Cryptoconnosur and Czar of Superstate. Then we've got Tarun, the gigabrain and grandpuba at Gauntlet.
00:00:45.622 - 00:01:08.642, Speaker A: And finally I'm haseeb the head hype man at Dragonfly. So we're early stage investors in crypto, but I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice, legal advice or even life advice. Please see Chop and Block at XYZ for more disclosures. All right, so it's been a crazy couple of weeks. There's been a lot of conferencing going on. I think most of us, minus Robert, were at Token 2049 in Asia. I guess Tom and Tarun, you guys are back in the States.
00:01:08.642 - 00:01:16.402, Speaker A: There was also main net in New York. What's been the vibe? Give me the brain dump. Of what conferencing has felt like in the last few weeks.
00:01:16.536 - 00:01:36.006, Speaker B: The US is dead as a doorknob for crypto. It seemed like the US conferences had less attendance than they normally do, amongst other things, whereas the Asia conferences were crazy. I just didn't think there were 12,000 people who wanted to go to a crypto conference in 2023. And clearly there was much more in Singapore. Singapore was insane.
00:01:36.118 - 00:01:55.378, Speaker A: Yeah, I Think Token 2049 had more people than ETH Denver. It was pretty wild. I mean, it is like the premier event in Asia and it sold out. Yeah, it was a gigantic venue, right? I mean, obviously ETH Denver was a very large venue as well, but it was absolutely massive. Robert. You were at permissionless. How did permissionless feel?
00:01:55.464 - 00:02:23.890, Speaker D: I mean, compared to prior years, permissionless felt pretty quiet. Really high quality group of people. The conferencegoers that were showing up to a conference in Austin, Texas, during a relatively hot week in September were not totally like, broad retail audience. It was mostly people that were closer to industry, closer to things happening in the space, and a little bit more informed than I've seen elsewhere. So small.
00:02:23.980 - 00:02:58.798, Speaker A: Felt like Token 2049 pulled a lot of people last minute from permissionless. I think a lot of people were planning to go and then decided, like, oh, shit, this seems like there's so much happening in Asia, I got to go out there. So I think the timing was a little unfortunate for permissionless, but there was a clip of Eric Voorhees giving, I guess, what was like, the keynote. It was pretty amazing. If you haven't seen it, I would strongly recommend watching it. It's got like a couple million views or something, and it's essentially just like a rallying cry, just sort of a credo of, hey, screw the government. Like, we're trying to build a decentralized alternative financial system and it really kind of plucked to the heartstrings.
00:02:58.798 - 00:03:00.118, Speaker A: I don't know. Did you see that live?
00:03:00.204 - 00:03:06.962, Speaker D: I did not see that live. I actually had to take off right before that speech, but I was able to watch it online afterwards.
00:03:07.106 - 00:03:20.278, Speaker C: It reminded me a little bit of his debate with SBF, I think, like a year ago. It was like a month right before FTX collapsed. And it was similarly kind of getting back to kind of the core religion ethos of crypto.
00:03:20.374 - 00:03:45.234, Speaker A: Yeah, we got to get him on the show at some point. He's a very good bear market. In a bull market, I always feel like Eric is a little too centered and too grounded. Bull markets, they kind of demand a bit more craziness and levity. But in a bear market, I feel like he's got this gravity that is very clarifying. I really appreciate the role that he's come to play as, like, the elder statesman of the industry. Any other takeaways from Token 2049? I mean, we were out in Asia for a couple of weeks.
00:03:45.234 - 00:04:17.738, Speaker A: The videos have just started going up for Token 2049, and I did one panel that I moderated with a bunch of L1s, and it was actually probably the most entertaining panel I did. I did several panels while I was out there, but most of them were kind of they were great. But this one, it was aptos. Sui, Avalanche and near, all of whom were on stage, and Goon, who's been on the show a couple times, goon was just like he just basically was ready to pick a fight. And so they just got on stage. They were scrapping. They were like, interrupting each other and getting super aggressive.
00:04:17.738 - 00:04:29.822, Speaker A: And it was honestly the most entertaining panel I think I've ever moderated just from how angry everyone was on stage. So any other highlights or anything that stood out to you guys while you were giving talks or moderating?
00:04:29.886 - 00:05:19.730, Speaker C: I don't know about being on stage, but I will say there was a little bit of a bizarro world moment with Token 2049, too, where obviously a lot of high quality projects, a lot of good representation throughout the industry. And then there were a lot of random projects I'd never heard of that had these massive sort of neon lit up booths that they clearly spent a bunch of money on. I believe Islamic Coin was one of the large sponsors. I'm not an Islamic Coin expert, but there was another sort of meme floating around. They're doing a public crowd sale for Islamic Coin, purportedly a $30 billion FDV. Like $60 million wait, but they went on Twitter to explain that this is a 100 year FDV. And so in reality, the near term FDV that you're investing into is not near term FDV, the near term market cap.
00:05:19.800 - 00:05:26.930, Speaker A: I think we need to add some extra FDV numbers into CoinGecko just so we can start out near term FDV, long term FDV.
00:05:27.090 - 00:06:05.502, Speaker B: I think an interesting thing related to this that's a tiny deviation, but important to note is the history of finance actually has had a lot of things where the introduction of a new financial metric as a form of reporting completely changes company structure. Like EBITDA. Right. Why does EBITDA exist? Like earnings before income tax depreciation amortization. And it's like because it was just some company that was losing money and they started reporting EBITDA instead of like true profits, but that kept them afloat for long enough to raise financing and then EBITDA now became like the accounting standard over time.
00:06:05.556 - 00:06:05.774, Speaker A: Right?
00:06:05.812 - 00:06:16.534, Speaker B: So I kind of think that these FTV games, we're going to just see this war of all these metrics and whichever metric is like the market wants will eventually be the standard and everyone will just try to optimize that.
00:06:16.652 - 00:06:55.030, Speaker A: Yeah, this is 100% what happened to TVL. Yeah, TVL in principle makes sense as a number, right? But how do you count TVL? Do you count your own token? Do you count wrapped versions of your token? If somebody wraps your token and puts it back in your protocol, is that double the TVL? DFI llama just decided how TVL gets counted and then the rest of the world just warped around the way that these metrics decided to get reported. And of course, you saw that on Salana where all these people were recursively kind of putting TVL from one protocol back into another one, back into another one. Now, I think we've gotten better at not double counting, triple counting, but back in 2021 when DFI was in full thrust, it was just whatever goes like that's TVL.
00:06:55.130 - 00:07:05.010, Speaker B: The other chart crime that exists that really irks me is when people show cumulative charts instead of like instantaneous charts.
00:07:06.070 - 00:07:07.140, Speaker C: Kills me.
00:07:07.670 - 00:07:35.822, Speaker A: I will say as a VC, let this be like a little one on one lesson. As a VC, we absolutely hate cumulative charts. We understand that cumulative charts look good. So for those who don't understand a cumulative chart, normally when you have a chart, you look at look, here are the number of transactions every day, right? Only a cumulative chart is here is the total number of transaction volume ever, if you add it all together. And the nice thing about cumulative charts is that they look like they're going up into the right always, no matter what, because they're adding it's like the number of how many trades have been done.
00:07:35.876 - 00:07:37.310, Speaker B: Adding positive number. Yeah.
00:07:37.380 - 00:07:50.734, Speaker A: Exactly the problem is that it is useless to look at as a VC when you're as a VC and you look at a cumulative chart what I assume is that your actual chart looks like dog shit and that's why you're showing me a cumulative chart? So, in general, don't show cumulative charts.
00:07:50.862 - 00:08:04.662, Speaker D: However, if it's a chart with multiple dimensions shown, if it's a cumulative chart and a daily or time period flow together, then it's cool. Is it?
00:08:04.716 - 00:08:06.530, Speaker A: I would rather just have a daily.
00:08:06.690 - 00:08:09.510, Speaker C: I'm already doing the first derivative of the community.
00:08:09.660 - 00:08:20.442, Speaker D: Okay, let's say you have a daily chart and it's like net inflows where some days are positive, some days are negative, some days are positive, some days are negative. You don't know the total ramification of it.
00:08:20.496 - 00:08:32.430, Speaker A: That's a net chart, not a cumulative chart. Right? So if you're netting gains and losses and you're getting like PNL or something like that or net inflows and outflows, that's not a cumulative chart. That's very different because that does not go up into the right. I agree.
00:08:32.500 - 00:08:39.426, Speaker D: No, I think then it's well complemented with a cumulative on the other access behind it.
00:08:39.608 - 00:08:41.346, Speaker A: Net and cumulative are two different things.
00:08:41.448 - 00:08:43.614, Speaker C: I did see. I agree, that's just AUM.
00:08:43.742 - 00:08:45.730, Speaker B: We should have a chart crime episode.
00:08:47.510 - 00:08:48.194, Speaker A: This is it.
00:08:48.232 - 00:08:50.870, Speaker D: This is the chart crime episode.
00:08:51.610 - 00:08:53.810, Speaker A: This is the truest of VC true crime.
00:08:53.890 - 00:09:10.822, Speaker C: It was inflows for friendtech but they didn't take out the outflows so it was literally just any deposits into Frontech added to the chart. And so of course you assume you're going to be looking@a.net chart and in fact it's any sort of deposit adds to the overall chart which is kind of a useless metric.
00:09:10.966 - 00:09:16.922, Speaker A: Chart crime, chart crime, chart crime. Any other chart crimes that come to mind as long as we're on the topic.
00:09:17.066 - 00:09:44.850, Speaker B: I think these fee accumulated ones where they're like people who are trying to annualize, I think people annualizing certain types of fee accrual in crypto sometimes makes no fucking sense because it's very event driven. Like oh, there's a ton of fees from one event and then zero forever. But they always choose the right timescale so that they can say we have at least x of fees. I understand how integrals and derivatives work and you're just trying to play with the boundary conditions.
00:09:45.010 - 00:10:16.526, Speaker A: Yeah, I saw a lot of this in 2021 when a bunch of people like a bunch of businesses that had a bunch of random core businesses, but almost all of them had Tokens on the balance sheet and those Tokens went up and they counted that as revenue. And so they're just like, oh, I had 50 million of revenue this year. And if you chart that forward another 50 next year and it's going to ramp this much. And I'm like, dude, your core business made like 3 million and 50 million just came from Tokens going up on your balance sheet. That's not your business. It's kind of charity. I don't know if it's chart crime.
00:10:16.558 - 00:10:28.486, Speaker B: Per se, but it's like EBITDA, right? I think crypto still is so nascent and the idea of what should count and what shouldn't and what flows, it's still kind of an open thing of what the accounting should be.
00:10:28.508 - 00:10:28.838, Speaker A: Right.
00:10:28.924 - 00:10:56.250, Speaker B: So I kind of think I'm kind of curious what EBITDA? Like, the thing that becomes a meme that sticks, that's not TVL and that's not just like fees. What do you think you guys think it is? Because I do feel like this bear market, my prediction is this bear market will end when we have invented what that is. Like, the last bear market ended when TVL started becoming a metric and then people started monitoring it and not gaming it as much and it was just kind of going up slowly.
00:10:56.330 - 00:11:05.954, Speaker D: I feel like the Solana stuff gamed, it even more where it was like, oh, here's the metric that everything's measured on. So what if we come up with these crazy ways to like that's usually.
00:11:05.992 - 00:11:10.046, Speaker B: The end of a bubble, right? When it goes for the bubble?
00:11:10.078 - 00:11:13.630, Speaker A: Baby, that was like the kickoff of the bubble.
00:11:13.710 - 00:11:43.930, Speaker B: I know, but my point is, once you start getting kind of a shelling point around a particular metric, it doesn't get gamed for a little while. There's like a certain amount of time where it becomes a good real standard bearer, but then someone eventually realizes that it's the thing to game and then you get this kind of capital bubble around that like AI. You're having that happen with tokens per second right now, which is also a fucking useless, meaningless thing because the choice of architecture means the tokens aren't really the same. There's not fungibility of them.
00:11:44.000 - 00:12:19.382, Speaker A: Sure. I think it feels like right now there's more and more fixation on revenue. And so you're seeing like token terminal. If you're looking at there's just revenue, there's annualized revenue, there's price to sales, price to earnings. So it does feel like we're sort of morphing more closer to traditional revenue and underwriting metrics, which is a good sign. However, these metrics aren't totally normalized in the sense that for example, for Uniswap, does Uniswap have revenue? Like, obviously the token holders aren't capturing anything, so the revenue is flowing entirely to, you could say, like, cost of goods sold is like 100% because all the revenue is going to the liquidity providers.
00:12:19.446 - 00:13:03.880, Speaker D: I would say one of the biggest issues is that you have protocols that are not businesses and people are trying to strap business metrics or accounting metrics on them and they're just not like Ethereum bitcoin. People are like, oh, fees paid. Is that revenue? No, it's not revenue. Right. I don't think anyone thinks that the transaction fees on Bitcoin are revenue. Are they on ethereum? No, but I've seen platforms that talk about that alongside something like Uniswap and it's like none of these really make sense. It's just like someone trying to build not to knock any one particular company, but someone trying to build a company about standardizing data is like, oh great, let's standardize how we look at everything.
00:13:03.880 - 00:13:23.018, Speaker D: And I don't think it fits, personally. I don't think these protocols living on top of blockchains are necessarily businesses or need business metrics. I don't think it's that helpful. I think projects and protocols might have their own unique metrics for success, like how many people are doing X, Y and Z and it won't always translate to this.
00:13:23.104 - 00:13:35.578, Speaker A: What do you think are metrics that should be adopted in lieu of revenue or price of sales or whatever? All the stuff that people are doing to try to account for, particularly in DeFi. I think for layer ones it's a little more nebulous.
00:13:35.674 - 00:14:12.982, Speaker D: I think it comes down to exactly what the protocol is. Right, so a great example is even taking two things that seem like they're the same, let's say like uniswap versus synthetics. You're like, well, both of them are for trading, one of them is for trading spot tokens and one of them is more like derivatives. Right. So would you say total notional traded? That might look crazy to use that as a comparison. I guess my point is even two things that look the same are going to be vastly different when you think about how you judge them or measure them. And so all I'm trying to say is let's slow down and not trying to come up with one size fits all metrics.
00:14:12.982 - 00:14:14.602, Speaker D: I don't think there is some EBITDA.
00:14:14.666 - 00:14:48.278, Speaker B: Type, but for DeFi, broadly trying and when people get any shelling point on one of those, that's when you see capital formation happen because it's like, hey look, there's this metric, we can optimize it. We see the growth curve, right? Like growth implies you have a number or a set of numbers and a derivative, like a gradient and the gradient can go up and you're like, yes, pour more money in it. And I do feel like there's like a psychological human behavior element to this and crypto somehow plays with that in a lot of ways. And some of its beauty is that the fact that it kind of plays with these.
00:14:48.444 - 00:15:24.398, Speaker C: I think the revenue thing also is like a good I agree it's really difficult to sort of compare across different types of companies, but generally it's a good heuristic for understanding product market fit and desirability, just showing willingness to pay, right? You can't fudge it because I'm literally burning money, I'm spending money to use this protocol. Same thing with net dollar retention, net revenue retention overall, just like user retention. Yeah, I think that's generally sort of a good heuristic because it's showing that people are actually using these things consistently because they want to use it. Not because ideally you're sort of tying out any sort of yeah, I'm inclined.
00:15:24.414 - 00:15:56.046, Speaker A: To agree with this is that, although it is an abuse of nomenclature, I think you're better off thinking of protocols as products and thinking about, like, if you can just applying very kind of dumb simplistic. Like, yeah, they don't work perfectly, but they're way better than just, like, finger in the air. What's TDL? And kind of, how do I feel like the vibes are trending for this particular protocol? I think at the very least, it keeps you honest. If you look at the era pre when people had concrete metrics that they were looking at, like protocol revenue and things like that, there were just a lot of things that had take for.
00:15:56.068 - 00:16:02.266, Speaker B: Example, then you had four Chan economics, because whatever was posted on four chan was the truth.
00:16:02.378 - 00:16:29.518, Speaker A: Totally. And also not looking at net of emissions, looking at willingness to pay net of emissions, you just end up with this crazy time where it's like, oh, there's basically like a negative cycle where people are making money by using your product and you're like, wow, I have product market fit. There was basically an entire year where every hot product in Crypto was that. It was being like, wow, look how much adoption this is getting, when it's really just people clicking a button that pays them every second. To be fair, it's so fucked.
00:16:29.554 - 00:16:33.782, Speaker B: The enterprise SaaS bubble also had the same thing. It was just the way the capital.
00:16:33.846 - 00:16:37.862, Speaker A: Was distributed was totally, totally agreed. Agreed.
00:16:37.926 - 00:16:40.086, Speaker B: It's not unique to Crypto, right?
00:16:40.128 - 00:17:32.778, Speaker D: That was just every industry that has abundant capital has the risk of distorting the demand for the underlying product, right? Like, a great example is like, Uber subsidized all of its rides early on with that sweet venture capital money so that people would take a lot more Ubers than they would if they had to pay a full market rate, right? And it worked, and it was glorious, and it built an incredible company. And that was in a totally random industry like transportation, when there was the appearance of plentiful capital. And so I don't think any industry that has external financing is like, immune from this. I think at the end of the day, every industry in some sense uses capital to grow more rapidly than it could without the presence of that capital. And that's obvious and it's good. And it's the whole reason that markets agreed.
00:17:32.874 - 00:18:30.334, Speaker A: I think where I would part company with, I think the direction you're taking that is that if you look at basically liquidity mining, farming, whatever, that's kind of been one of the core innovations in capital formation within Crypto. And I think part of what made it confusing is that, okay, when you're subsidizing a product, right, you're subsidizing some enterprise sales thing or, I don't know, you're paying doctors to prescribe your shitty drug or whatever it is. It's pretty easy to look at the substance of that economic transaction and realize, here's where the dead weight loss is happening. Here's where everything's being greased, right. We didn't really understand it in crypto. Maybe we should have maybe it should have been obvious, but we really didn't understand the negative cycles that existed in this whole thing until it was pretty late in that process when we realized, like, ah, okay, subsidizing something on chain can actually mask the fact that this thing doesn't have product market fit and people are just farming it. Right? Like these concepts, within probably a year, I think we got the hang of it.
00:18:30.334 - 00:18:48.390, Speaker A: But before that, people really did believe, oh, people are farming it's. The old SBF put a thing in a box and tokenize it analogy. Exactly. It's a box analogy. Right. If people are farming the box, the box is valuable. We really kind of took a while to understand, like, no, that's not true.
00:18:48.390 - 00:19:46.022, Speaker A: This financial alchemy is just masking this bullshit underneath. And once the market got the hang of that, I think we ended up in a more subtle place, which is that, hey, now you have I mean, Tarun, obviously, you guys do this with gauntlet is look at on chain emissions and try to figure out how valuable are they? Are you getting good ROI as a dao for emitting tokens in order to attract a certain kind of behavior that you want. You know what, I'd go a step further is that I think a lot of what the industry was talking about in 20 20 20 21, 20 22 was how amazing token economics are and how token economics can create completely different kinds of innovation and products and this and that. And I would argue that the record of token economics is absolutely fucking awful. And token economics can do way less than the industry on the whole has claimed that it's able to do. And so for the most part, I sort of consider token economics to be a little bit of a dirty word today compared to how I saw it two years ago. Curious to get you guys take on that.
00:19:46.076 - 00:19:55.146, Speaker D: Do you feel that I think this is where you start to get into differences between the L1 and the application layer. Okay. Do you think that token economics of.
00:19:55.168 - 00:19:58.506, Speaker A: Ethereum are no, I think they're fine, but they're also quite simple.
00:19:58.608 - 00:20:01.726, Speaker B: They also took a while to change, if you think about it.
00:20:01.748 - 00:20:01.886, Speaker A: Right.
00:20:01.908 - 00:20:05.614, Speaker B: Like, they've iterated on it slowly over eight years.
00:20:05.812 - 00:20:10.000, Speaker D: Do you think the token economics of bitcoin are broken? I mean, I'll personally say yes.
00:20:10.530 - 00:20:31.030, Speaker B: Actually, you know, one interesting thing, actually, I was just at this conference today and Neil Ferguson talked and he was so pro DFI and kind of shitting on bitcoin. I was very impressed by that. I was surprised to hear that. And part of his rationale was the bad tokenomics.
00:20:32.010 - 00:20:56.570, Speaker C: I generally agree with you, but I think there are you could certainly argue for an L1. Like, hey, isn't having high blockboard emissions in the early days to boost out this network. Isn't that just like liquidity mining for validators for miners and then sort of slowly tapering off over time? And arguably Ethereum did it correctly here. And so there are success stories, but it's not easy. It's not a one size fits all kind of thing and most people just don't.
00:20:56.650 - 00:21:16.878, Speaker A: Bitcoin, in a way, was kind of lucky that it turned out. Bitcoin had an exponential growth curve in its price and it had an exponential decay in its emissions. And the two kind of lined up perfectly. I mean, you could argue like maybe well, it was faded to do. I don't think it was faded. It kind of seems like x ante. It would be better if there were some PID or something that bitcoin tried to target some security ratio.
00:21:16.878 - 00:21:24.998, Speaker A: Instead it just kind of happened to work out. But it obviously will probably not continue to happen to work out as the emission goes to zero.
00:21:25.164 - 00:21:33.354, Speaker D: I don't think so. I think a Bitcoin Maxi is going to hear this show and be like, well, of course it's going to work out because the price of Bitcoin is going to double every four years.
00:21:33.472 - 00:21:40.220, Speaker A: If the rate goes to zero, the price has to go to infinity, otherwise it breaks. So we need infinity by 2100.
00:21:40.590 - 00:21:46.474, Speaker D: Well, unless the transaction fees no, I disagree. Unless the transaction fees really replace the block.
00:21:46.522 - 00:21:46.686, Speaker A: Yes.
00:21:46.708 - 00:22:30.618, Speaker D: So the thing that I always found from an idea perspective, especially if you're going to write a white paper and design a system, it actually seems like a pretty good process. Because you would assume that if this thing was alive 20 years from its creation. Clearly someone's using it and there's a lot of usage and there's a lot of transaction fees that are going to obsolete the block reward itself. And so I don't know, I think it probably sounded brilliant then. Does it sound brilliant now while the transaction fees are not replacing the block reward? But we'll see. I also think that there's going to be security risks in eight years, in nine years, like major ones, but we'll see.
00:22:30.704 - 00:22:55.682, Speaker A: Tough to say. Okay, let's roll forward. So we have a couple of stories that I wanted to get to today. So one of them is that there's been, once again a very large hack in crypto. This hack is of a protocol called Mixon Network. They were hacked and they claimed they lost about $200 million. And it appears that their cloud service provider was attacked and they contacted Google and they don't have the money.
00:22:55.682 - 00:23:24.062, Speaker A: And so they've been kind of just roundly laughed at for basically kind of this thin veneer of decentralization when reality, it seems like they're just a centralized database in some data center somewhere. It kind of feels like a similar story to MultiChain, as we learned. So this is also a Chinese MultiChain crosschain bridge and MultiChain kind of same story. They had just some centralized server that had the keys, that had all the money, and the money was stolen and the sister and something. It was kind of a ridiculous since.
00:23:24.116 - 00:23:55.000, Speaker B: We'Re on the trope of Tarun tells you rumors he heard in Asia. What I heard about the Multi channel, I was waiting for the segment, basically. And again, this is just a complete like, I'm disclaiming that for all the shit I've said about this type of stuff this week is that apparently the Yunan Wichita province and China government had like a $1.2 billion hole or something in their budget, and then they realized this guy was there.
00:23:56.650 - 00:23:57.400, Speaker A: No.
00:24:00.490 - 00:24:14.254, Speaker B: Let me just tell you, I was surprised at the type of person who was telling me this. So I was like, either they have gone down the Snopes.com four chan world, or it's like 100% real that it was like an organized thing against this guy.
00:24:14.372 - 00:24:22.042, Speaker D: The rumor you heard, the person who created that rumor believes that a local government was trying to plug a shortfall.
00:24:22.106 - 00:24:24.922, Speaker A: By taking through Cryptocrime MultiChain.
00:24:24.986 - 00:24:29.890, Speaker B: I know it sounds ridiculous. Just a podcast. We're trying to create entertainment here.
00:24:29.960 - 00:24:34.754, Speaker A: I figured anything for the views, anything for the whatever. Whatever it takes.
00:24:34.872 - 00:24:39.262, Speaker D: This has now become the no no chart crime.
00:24:39.326 - 00:24:41.534, Speaker B: Chart crime. Do you have any more rumor whisper?
00:24:41.582 - 00:24:42.998, Speaker A: You're very good. Very good.
00:24:43.084 - 00:24:45.170, Speaker D: Any other hot rumors you got from China?
00:24:45.330 - 00:24:55.580, Speaker B: I think those only Islamic coin and multi chain thing. Yeah, first of all, mixon. I didn't even see them there. Did any of you hear of Mixon before that?
00:24:56.670 - 00:25:33.122, Speaker A: I always thought it was a privacy thing because the word Mixin makes me think of Monero, but apparently not. All right, well, you know what? We will move on because this story does not seem to have much substance beyond the shocking headline. There was another story. We were a little bit late on this one, but there was a story about Stoner Cats. So Stoner Cats, if you remember it was this what was it? Like Ashton Kutcher and a bunch of celebrities that got together and made this NFT collection of these Stoner Cats. I think Vitalik did like some cameo in it. And they were going to be using the proceeds of these NFT collections to fund a TV show and a bunch of other IP that they were going to do from the Stoner Cat series.
00:25:33.122 - 00:26:07.282, Speaker A: This is very early in the NFT bull market that Stoner Cats was around. They raised about 8 million selling 10,000 Stoner Cats in 2021. The SEC recently settled with Stoner Cats, and they had to pay a civil penalty of $1 million and offer a fund to return money to any purchasers who wanted to get a refund, as well as destroy all of the NFTs in their possession. So the SEC basically said, look, stoner cats are securities. Why are they securities? They're securities because Stonercats highlighted the ability to. Sell them on secondary marketplaces. They had 2.5%
00:26:07.282 - 00:26:29.762, Speaker A: royalties, and they encouraged trading of the NFTs in order to collect more royalties. And the phrase they used was, the more successful the show, the more successful your NFT. So the NFTs, the show didn't actually exist. There were six episodes that were produced. You got 4.5 stars on imbdb, which is not wait, is that out of ten or is that out of five? So it's not a good show. That's maybe why they got sued.
00:26:29.762 - 00:26:30.982, Speaker A: Yeah, okay. A lot of complaints.
00:26:31.046 - 00:26:40.794, Speaker B: I mean, the idea that a high cat is a security is just almost like art. It feels like performance art. Thinking about this entire case, I feel.
00:26:40.832 - 00:27:03.326, Speaker C: Like the facts of the case actually aren't that bad. The show does exist. You can go watch. It functions as NFT gating mechanism. It works. And I think in isolation, the idea of selling a pass to watch your show if it's an NFT is fine. But it was everything they did around that in terms of marketing these NFTs that just like so many red flags.
00:27:03.326 - 00:27:24.426, Speaker C: I mean, they were talking about sweeping the stonercat floor on Twitter and talking about they were sort of like encouraging trading of the NFTs themselves. And obviously, the more successful the show, the more successful your mean. I just feel like they were getting bad legal advice or no legal advice or something, but it's not like know, promised some game and then they never delivered on it.
00:27:24.448 - 00:27:46.798, Speaker B: On the other hand, by the way, did you see that Paris Hilton launched some new NFTs? This conversation about celebrities getting a ton of stuff, know, ton of bad stuff happening to them from the last cycle because they mindlessly endorsed shit that they didn't really think about, like trump trading cards. That was the first ever disclosure in a presidential candidacy of ethereum holdings. So let's give it some credit.
00:27:46.884 - 00:27:49.970, Speaker A: But the I didn't know trump did disclosures. That's news to me.
00:27:50.120 - 00:27:52.322, Speaker B: Well, no, I think he had to.
00:27:52.376 - 00:27:56.260, Speaker D: For yeah, he held the ether and did not dispose of it.
00:27:56.790 - 00:28:05.346, Speaker B: But yeah, Paris Hilton has a new one. So I was like, that was the first sign of light I saw in the bear market of a celebrity trying to make a thing or just Paris.
00:28:05.378 - 00:28:12.854, Speaker A: Hilton is kind of desperate. I don't know. I take that as a bull market sign that Paris Hilton has launched more NFTs.
00:28:12.982 - 00:28:25.282, Speaker B: I mean, the fact that she's doing it is I don't mean are they selling? I have no clue. But the point is, I would have thought the stonercat settlement would have scared the shit out of every celebrity.
00:28:25.366 - 00:28:31.610, Speaker A: That seems like a sign that Paris Hilton is kind of desperate to make some money and hasn't gotten the memo that NFTs aren't selling anymore.
00:28:31.690 - 00:28:39.026, Speaker B: She's a smart businesswoman. I don't think she's actually quite capable. And this actually is, to me, a bright sign.
00:28:39.208 - 00:28:43.778, Speaker A: Okay, well, tarun, I would recommend that you start copy trading Parasilton if you.
00:28:43.784 - 00:28:47.558, Speaker B: Really believe that she has copy traded me before.
00:28:47.644 - 00:28:49.560, Speaker A: Is that right? How's that?
00:28:50.170 - 00:28:54.406, Speaker B: She joined pleaserdao. Much later at a much higher price.
00:28:54.588 - 00:28:56.760, Speaker A: Okay, very good. Okay.
00:28:58.730 - 00:29:01.590, Speaker B: Robert and I both were copy traded by Parasol.
00:29:01.670 - 00:29:23.438, Speaker A: Okay. So, look, if Stoner Cats is a security, like, yeah, okay. They know, oh, you should trade the thing, and we're making a show. You could argue like, well, okay, they're making a show. They're raising money to do some outside thing, and that really looks like fundraising. It still feels like, look, if Stoner Cats is a security, then everything is. I mean, what besides crypto punks is not a security?
00:29:23.604 - 00:30:10.106, Speaker D: Yeah, Roblox would be a security. I mean, this goes to the fact that I believe two out of the five commissioners wrote a pretty scathing rebuke of this. Is that it's a very tenuous, this line between a stoner cat NFT and most other art. On a blockchain and things that a couple years ago you would have laughed if someone said that that was a security and that it also implies most things off chain could potentially be securities that no one expects are. And so it seems like a pretty stretched interpretation that was settled. It never went to court. Who knows how it would have turned out? But I don't know if in ten years, we're going to say, like, oh, yeah, stoner cat NFT.
00:30:10.106 - 00:30:13.670, Speaker D: That's very clearly a security structure.
00:30:13.770 - 00:30:22.382, Speaker B: Why did you guys watch Richie Torres's grilling of Gensler yesterday about Pokemon cards?
00:30:22.446 - 00:30:24.946, Speaker A: I feel like that can you what exactly happened?
00:30:25.048 - 00:30:55.578, Speaker B: Representative Torres from New York basically said, like, hey, do you think a Pokemon card's a security? Like, Gensler was doing this hearing yesterday, and he said, hey, do you think a Pokemon card is a security? And Gensler's like, no. And they said, do you think a tokenized version of a Pokemon card security? He says maybe. I'm not like but he caught him in a way where Gensler looked kind of like a fucking moron when he responded, and it was quite elegant. It was like a very elegant line of questioning.
00:30:55.674 - 00:31:10.420, Speaker D: Yeah, but these are the things that defy the public's expectations and logic and common sense. If you asked a random person on the street if a Pokemon card was a security, they would say, Absolutely not. What are you talking about?
00:31:10.870 - 00:31:13.538, Speaker A: Yeah, random person on the street does not even know what a security is.
00:31:13.624 - 00:31:15.202, Speaker D: And what is a Pokemon card?
00:31:15.336 - 00:31:27.714, Speaker A: I will say, speaking of Pokemon cards, I mean, this is a total aside, but I did not realize how popular Pokemon cards still are, especially in Asia. You find Pokemon cards everywhere, like, every 711, they're just sitting there right by the cash register.
00:31:27.762 - 00:31:29.986, Speaker B: What's the FDV of Pokemon cards?
00:31:30.098 - 00:31:36.810, Speaker A: That is a good question. I don't know. Also, there's so many Pokemon now, I feel like the card game must be impossible.
00:31:37.150 - 00:31:39.194, Speaker B: That is an insane inflation rate.
00:31:39.312 - 00:31:46.846, Speaker C: If you think about we need some, we need some more disclosures, we need know supply schedule, we need like what.
00:31:46.868 - 00:31:58.594, Speaker A: What if they actually did securities? Like it would be here are the risk factors for cards instead, like, look, we know what we need. We need the inflation schedule, we need the team allocation, we know how to do this.
00:31:58.712 - 00:32:23.538, Speaker D: I mean, to that point, the reality is if you're buying Pokemon cards with an expectation of profit, right, you have no idea what the Pokemon company is going to do. The Pokemon company could change the Rarity, change the supply, ban prior cards, make new ones, add Pokemon, take away Pokemon, maybe Charizard's no longer in the that's.
00:32:23.554 - 00:32:34.090, Speaker A: Why we need the SEC to protect us, to make sure that that can't happen without proper registration and disclosures. So. Thank you, Daddy. Gensler.
00:32:34.170 - 00:33:02.546, Speaker B: I highly recommend watching the interrogation of Gensler yesterday by Torres and then Emmer. They were just very it just for the comedic value of like I feel like little is like clearly someone who gets ruffled by or seemingly someone who gets ruffled by very aggressive question asking. You would think he would be used to it by now, but clearly he's not. And the Pokemon one was like Dagger. It was very funny.
00:33:02.738 - 00:33:06.806, Speaker A: Tom, tell us about what is happening in the Malady verse. We must know.
00:33:06.988 - 00:33:49.158, Speaker C: There's a lawsuit between two of the Romelio co founders. One, Charlotte is suing the other for misappropriating proceeds from these bonkler sales. Or like the Mulady nouns equivalent where they have an auction and you can buy them and they said stole a million dollars and now they're countersuing and say, no, actually you were the one who stole the funds and stole the IP. And I think it kind of goes maybe there's a broader story or idea here around sort of the extra protocol off chain ongoings of NFTs are really interesting right now. Like pudgy. Penguins are in Walmart. They announced they're doing these plushie sales, so they're selling these in Walmarts across the country now.
00:33:49.158 - 00:34:30.820, Speaker C: But it's like very just orthogonal to what's actually happening with the NFTs themselves and sort of like the proceeds from those. And so I think overall NFTs and NFT collections are kind of in this soul searching phase where royalties are kind of dead, primaries are kind of dead, you're not really generating the revenue you're not really going to be generating. And so everyone's kind of trying to look for the next thing and it's not really clear what that is yet. And so you get these sort of weird off chain shenanigans or like BAPE did some collab with Board Ape and they got panned very aggressively on social media. Just like universally they're like, no one wants this crap. And so everyone's trying to figure out what the next business model is for these things.
00:34:31.830 - 00:34:37.158, Speaker A: What would be your advice to a struggling NFT founder who's going through the valley of Darkness right now.
00:34:37.244 - 00:34:39.906, Speaker B: Everyone here has to give one cohen of wisdom.
00:34:40.018 - 00:34:42.290, Speaker A: Each person one coon of wisdom.
00:34:42.450 - 00:34:45.314, Speaker D: Yes, one molecule of wisdom.
00:34:45.442 - 00:34:52.906, Speaker B: There's not enough brain cells that exist in NFT buyers, so we don't have that much to give.
00:34:53.088 - 00:34:57.530, Speaker A: Okay. All right, Tom, you're up first. Give us your advice.
00:34:57.870 - 00:35:46.186, Speaker C: I mean, obviously a lot of NFT founders are looking to become media businesses or merchandise businesses or fashion businesses or whatever. I think the downside there is that these are not tend to not be amazing businesses based on multiples or margins. And so, yeah, you can go sell plushies, but they don't have the same kind of great unit economics that selling NFTs do. And so I think ultimately, in my mind, doing primary sales of NFTs and doing Mints is kind of the best business model ever. And everything else is almost sort of a loss leader into doing that. All the events and all the media and all the stuff you do around the community. And so if you can figure out a way to do sort of sustainable primary issuance and Mints are actually still reasonably healthy, but they just are not the sort of ten K PFP drops that they used to be.
00:35:46.186 - 00:36:08.654, Speaker C: I think that's like an amazing model. I mean, that's kind of the model that most sort of luxury goods go down where it's like, yeah, we'll do some press around our new watch, but ultimately it's about these limited drops and that's sort of how you make your money. It's like through this scarcity and everything else is sort of supporting the buy pressure to allow you to do that. So that would be my kernel of wisdom.
00:36:08.782 - 00:36:13.470, Speaker D: Okay, so do more like Azuki type new drops.
00:36:13.550 - 00:36:31.466, Speaker C: I think Azuki had the right idea. I think the execution was maybe off. But yeah, I mean, selling $40 million of NFTs in a bear market and that's all profit, that's incredible. So anything you can do to allow you to keep doing that I think should be kind of the goal. That's almost like the loss leader versus the actual business model.
00:36:31.568 - 00:36:35.318, Speaker A: Daruin, what's your advice to struggling NFT founder?
00:36:35.414 - 00:37:42.346, Speaker B: I guess there's two angles to this that I would say are worth looking at. The first is, well, let's consider Bernard Arnaud. So Bernard Arno, founder of LVMH, louis Vuitton, Moyet Hennessy, their name already portends where most of the value came from, which was aggregating a bunch of luxury brands, some struggling, some not, into one house, finding economies of scale for them and then maximizing distribution. There's a sense in which I wonder if the NFTs are too disaggregated and actually aggregating, some of them merging, some of them actually would be able to extract more value distribution wise, would have a better chance with these media type of engagements. And I kind of think M A and NFTs land someone will be just as activist investors in public markets are the disaggregators they always fight for people to split up or to return capital or whatever. There's always the people who are the aggregators in the private markets who roll up a bunch of things and are able to create more value. I think there's a huge opportunity and it's pure financial engineering.
00:37:42.346 - 00:38:47.270, Speaker B: It's not necessarily making a new thing. Like maybe it's actually literally just rolling them up together and sharing distribution, but I think there's a lot of P style tactics that are likely successful. I guess the second thing I would say is that the line between NFT Mints and Airdrops and games is kind of like getting much more hazy lately. So if you think about how people are doing AirDrop farming right now, say for like ZK Sync, right, which doesn't have a token yet, people are putting in liquidity doing actions in the chain because they expect to get an AirDrop later, right? And there's obviously the big Celestia AirDrop this week, which really rewarded developers who contributed more than just users. And one interesting thing about that is you're sort of making shitty mobile game dynamics in Airdrops where it's like, hey, there's some metric we're not telling you that we're using to decide what you get. And it depends on some number of actions. And it's almost like a video game, like you have to try to do all those actions in time before the random payout comes out.
00:38:47.270 - 00:39:15.302, Speaker B: And the reason I bring this up is like NFTs could be useful in this kind of blurred line between complicated AirDrop and crappy game. And I think that's another space that people should explore. So just two things, aggregation, aggregate of effects, like some PE style roll up stuff and then B kind of play with the line between Airdrops and games because the line is getting blurrier.
00:39:15.446 - 00:40:08.254, Speaker A: So, okay, I will say probably of the four of us, I am the least NFT literate. I don't feel like I know very much or spend very much time in this market, but here would be my two cent. I would take the opposite side of what Tarun is saying is that I don't think roll up, like rolling things up or financial engineering is going to save the NFT market. I think that's probably a fast path to nowhere. I think if you understand what you're selling, NFTs are on chain luxury goods and how do you innovate in luxury goods? The answer is that you have to move with where people are going and with what makes people feel important and special. I think when the market was indexed onto royalties and everybody was trying to encourage more and more trading, that really works when the market is basically speculation. We're no longer in a speculative market and that means that secondary volumes, trading volumes are down and they're going to stay down because the volatility just is not there to support.
00:40:08.254 - 00:40:49.190, Speaker A: This being a great way to just flip stuff and make a bunch of money very quickly. Now, in the world of luxury goods, that's pretty normal if you're buying expensive watches, if you're buying expensive wines, if you're buying expensive paintings, people are not doing it so that they can do quick flips like some people do it sometimes and there are some assets that do that. But the vast majority of luxury goods, they don't move around as much, actually. They're largely treated as stores of value. And you can kind of see that in that the floor prices for a lot of these assets for the blue know they've gone down, but they have not gone down to zero. They've gone down know, thousands of dollars, but they're still thousands of dollars worth of JPEGs. And so I guess what I would encourage you to do is the way you innovate in luxury goods is to keep moving, keep plumbing new areas, keep having new ideas.
00:40:49.190 - 00:41:47.402, Speaker A: And like Tom was saying, you want to really think about this being fundamentally a primary business. You sell the NFT once, but you keep people coming back and you give them a reason to stay part of the club and to keep the club exclusive and exciting and novel and interesting. And maybe it also means that the people that you need to sell to are beyond just the crypto kind of core inner circle, right? It's possible that, hey, who are the other big spenders? Their lives and identities are very much online, but they're maybe not crypto Djens, right? Crypto Djens just have less money now than they did two years ago. So it may well be that, look, there are people who spend hundreds of thousands of dollars in mobile games playing something like genshin impact or playing whatever. There are other pockets where people have a lot of money online. So if what you're fundamentally selling are online luxury goods, then I think you maybe have to bet on these people showing up in different places but still being willing to signal with the kinds of assets and the kind of branding that they get from owning a really cool NFT. That's my two cent.
00:41:47.402 - 00:41:50.906, Speaker A: That's it. Robert, I'll give you the last word. Given that you're probably the deepest on the NFTs.
00:41:51.018 - 00:41:52.606, Speaker D: Yeah, I would just say don't do.
00:41:52.628 - 00:41:55.460, Speaker A: What everyone else I thought you going were to say. Don't do what any of these guys said to do.
00:41:57.910 - 00:42:32.406, Speaker D: No, if you're an NFP project, no more 10,000 PFPs, no more generic bullshit. Like if every artist made the same type of art, no artist would have any fame or success. Art is all about breaking the mold and doing things that people haven't seen before and trying new things and getting weird with it. So I would say if you're an NFT project, go wild, have some fun, do something crazy, do something radical like reinvent yourself. Just don't do something because you think that there's a playbook to do. It run away from anything that you think is a playbook.
00:42:32.518 - 00:42:40.522, Speaker A: I like that. I think that's a great note to end on. And if you do ping Robert, he will be the first in line to mint your radical new NFT.
00:42:40.666 - 00:42:43.870, Speaker D: I'll at least hover my finger over the button.
00:42:43.940 - 00:42:44.270, Speaker A: Great.
00:42:44.340 - 00:42:51.920, Speaker B: And if any of our advice was useful to you and you start a company, don't forget to tweet at us 100%.
00:42:52.370 - 00:42:57.240, Speaker A: Okay, we got a wrap. We got a hard stop. Thank everybody. See you all next week.
