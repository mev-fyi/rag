00:00:00.170 - 00:00:04.586, Speaker A: How can the crypto community rebuild trust in the industry after the collapse of FTX?
00:00:04.698 - 00:00:12.062, Speaker B: FTX, like Tessie said, was a centralized exchange run by a very small amount of people. That's not what crypto and web3 stands for.
00:00:12.116 - 00:00:19.502, Speaker D: FTX is a big blot on our entire industries, you know, face. So definitely it's a big issue.
00:00:19.636 - 00:00:29.110, Speaker A: I'm Laura Shin reporting for Unchained. I asked a few people at east Denver how they think the industry will recover from what has been its biggest black eye.
00:00:32.330 - 00:00:41.270, Speaker C: Trust has no place in this world, in this crypto ecosystem. This technology was created so we wouldn't have to trust.
00:00:41.420 - 00:00:53.020, Speaker B: That going down, being as opaque as it was, was very similar to banks. And so if anything, it shouldn't have hurt crypto as much as it did. Right?
