00:00:56.458 - 00:01:00.106, Speaker B: Today's guest is congressman and house majority whip Tom Emmer.
00:01:00.218 - 00:01:01.818, Speaker C: Welcome, representative emmer.
00:01:01.914 - 00:01:02.954, Speaker E: Good to see you, Laura.
00:01:03.002 - 00:01:03.966, Speaker A: Great to be with you.
00:01:04.068 - 00:01:17.270, Speaker B: You said on a bankless podcast recently that you believe the government is trying to enact an operation choke point two, point zero to cut crypto off from the banking system. What do you, as a congressperson, plan to do about it?
00:01:17.420 - 00:01:20.594, Speaker E: Well, we've got to continue to raise awareness, Laura.
00:01:20.642 - 00:01:24.118, Speaker A: If you look, literally, we had people.
00:01:24.204 - 00:01:45.482, Speaker E: Telling us that they've been running into problems trying to bank crypto. This has been an ongoing problem, especially under this administration. But let's not kid ourselves. It's been there for a while, but it really was ramped up. And then you had the three largest crypto banks in the country silvergate, Silicon.
00:01:45.546 - 00:01:49.006, Speaker A: Valley, and signature, all, for lack of.
00:01:49.028 - 00:01:56.298, Speaker E: A better term, go down within a short period of time. Silvergate first, and then silicon valley and.
00:01:56.324 - 00:01:58.642, Speaker A: Signature right after that.
00:01:58.776 - 00:02:28.634, Speaker E: Look, nobody lost anything in silvergate, but the silvergate owners decided to simply unwind and give everything, return all deposits to their customers. Why is that, Laura? Well, because they decided it was better to do that than to be fighting with regulators over the next several years and incurring all the legal costs that the government is going to require. If you're going to take on the government.
00:02:28.832 - 00:02:29.290, Speaker A: Again.
00:02:29.360 - 00:02:41.898, Speaker E: That's Tom Emmer's interpretation. You'd have to ask them. But it seemed interesting that that certain senator from Massachusetts seemed to be dancing on the grave of silvergate even though there were no losses.
00:02:41.994 - 00:02:43.274, Speaker B: You're talking about Elizabeth Warren.
00:02:43.322 - 00:03:22.686, Speaker E: I might be. I usually say the senator who shall not be named from Massachusetts, but yes, I think the owner of twitter refers to her as something else, too. But when you go to silicon valley, clearly there was a mismanagement issue, but there also was an oversight issue. Again, it is a large tech startup banking firm signature. I believe 30% of the assets, its signature were crypto assets. I think back to the initial press, Laura, that came out, and this is your business, so you can correct me if I miss it, but with Signature. The first thing we heard over the.
00:03:22.708 - 00:03:25.610, Speaker A: Weekend when they were declaring it insolvent.
00:03:25.770 - 00:04:08.954, Speaker E: Our government was, was former chair of the Financial Services Committee in the House. Barney Frank, co author of DoD Frank by the way, he was is I don't know what his status is today, but on the board its Signature, and I believe Barney Frank said something to the effect when this was first happening. I don't know how my government declares a solvent bank insolvent shortly after that it's some type of rumor or press statement that crypto was one of the problems with this bank because it was 30% of the deposits. Laura within 24 to 48 hours, I believe the head of the New York.
00:04:09.072 - 00:04:13.006, Speaker A: Financial Department came out and acknowledged that.
00:04:13.188 - 00:04:58.810, Speaker E: Those holdings were not, they didn't have anything to do with the alleged failing of Signature Bank because they weren't leveraged, they weren't using them as part of their loan portfolio, et cetera. And then we hear that some reporters are told that anyone who buys Signature, any bank that wants to buy Signature has to agree not to bank crypto. Long story, there are other warning signs along the way. But when we got to that one, it was really interesting that the FDIC was apparently telling prospective buyers at Signature that if you're going to buy the bank, you have to agree that you will not deal in crypto. Really interesting too.
00:04:58.880 - 00:05:02.960, Speaker A: They have signet, I believe it's called the technology.
00:05:03.650 - 00:05:16.278, Speaker E: It's twenty four seven real time closing of payments. Kind of funny that I asked the head of the FDIC last week, groonberg, what you've done with Signet?
00:05:16.314 - 00:05:20.174, Speaker A: And he said, oh, I believe we sold it. Guess what Laura?
00:05:20.302 - 00:05:38.120, Speaker E: They hadn't sold it. He either was ignorant or he was not telling me the truth on purpose. And I just wonder you got fed now that our federal government has announced they're going to be rolling out sometime this summer as a time payment system.
00:05:39.290 - 00:05:41.538, Speaker A: I don't know, we got to wait.
00:05:41.564 - 00:05:56.174, Speaker E: And see what these people are doing. But I do believe there's been a real attempt, you can call it choke, .2.0, whatever you want by our federal government to close out crypto, at least recently in our country.
00:05:56.372 - 00:06:06.738, Speaker B: I was curious because you have a very deep knowledge, especially from the crypto perspective, about the industry and about these kinds of issues.
00:06:06.904 - 00:06:08.786, Speaker C: And I was curious, when you look.
00:06:08.808 - 00:06:15.322, Speaker B: At other members of Congress, your colleagues, what are the general perceptions that they tend to have about crypto?
00:06:15.486 - 00:07:05.874, Speaker E: Well it's changed obviously. As you know, I've been doing this now for a little bit more than seven years. When I started with, for instance, the Blockchain Caucus, which was a new thing, two of its original founders were Jared Pulis, the current governor of Colorado, Democrat from Colorado, and Mick Mulvaney, a Republican from South Carolina who worked in the Trump administration. Back then. Laura, there were probably four or five people that I would see the same ones when I'd go to those meetings, in addition to those two, you'd see someone like David Schweiker today completely changed. And maybe there's one more intervening example I can give you. Republicans were in the majority, so this has got to be about five years ago.
00:07:05.874 - 00:07:31.742, Speaker E: There was a hearing in the financial services committee, which then was chaired by Republican Jeb Hensling out of Texas. And I was amazed back then to listen to republicans and democrats sound almost exactly the same. Back then, they were talking about crypto in the context of Silk Road. And this is where all the drug dealers hang out. This is where all the nefarious individuals are. Clearly, they hadn't gotten up to speed with what was going on.
00:07:31.876 - 00:07:35.118, Speaker A: And I would say since August of.
00:07:35.284 - 00:07:47.422, Speaker E: 2022, when the infrastructure bill was moving through the senate, the US. Senate, and they put a tax provision in which would apply to digital assets.
00:07:47.566 - 00:07:49.266, Speaker B: I think that was 2021.
00:07:49.368 - 00:07:59.878, Speaker E: Thank you. When you get to my agenda. But it was you're right, august of 2021, because I'm going back to the election year, which isn't right, 2021.
00:07:59.964 - 00:08:04.086, Speaker A: That infrastructure bill really what put the.
00:08:04.108 - 00:08:30.574, Speaker E: Jets on people's interest in getting up to speed. And I would say that now, especially in the house, I've got a whole bunch of Republicans on the committee that they've got their skepticism, but they're very open to understanding what the digital asset space is all about, what crypto is all about, how it works, why it's important, what are the pros, what are the cons. And it's not just republicans. You look over on the other side.
00:08:30.612 - 00:08:33.086, Speaker A: Of our committee, you get past the.
00:08:33.108 - 00:09:21.546, Speaker E: Former chair, the ranking member, who seems to want to have nothing to do with this, and you've got some very thoughtful democrats who are exploring the same things with digital assets in the crypto community. So I think there's been a huge growth in the knowledge base within, especially the house. I've seen it over on the senate side, know, with Lumis, and give Ted Cruz some credit because, boy, that guy's worked hard to get up to speed. And crypto is a big deal. Mining is a big deal in Texas. So I do think we're moving in the right direction. But unfortunately, we've got a federal government right now, Laura, that I literally believe they have weaponized market chaos to kill crypto.
00:09:21.546 - 00:09:31.678, Speaker E: It's exactly why I sent the investigative letter to FDIC chairman Grunberg requesting more information, and I asked him again last week if he could please respond to my letter.
00:09:31.774 - 00:09:59.846, Speaker B: You've said that crypto is nonpartisan, and yet at the moment, it feels like it's becoming more partisan. You just did name a number of Democrats that are pro crypto, and I would add Rokana and Richie Torres to that list. However, it seems like the louder democratic voices on crypto, for instance, those of, for instance, senator Elizabeth Warren, or even Sherrod Brown. Warren has tweeted that she's building an anti crypto army. Sherrod Brown did at least at one point, float the idea of a crypto ban.
00:09:59.958 - 00:10:01.478, Speaker C: And I wondered what you thought you.
00:10:01.504 - 00:10:03.306, Speaker B: Could do to prevent crypto from becoming.
00:10:03.338 - 00:10:36.342, Speaker E: A partisan know, I don't think it is yet. I mean, I think you're talking about a couple of central banking. Uh, Elizabeth Warren. She may not love central banks, but she does love the design. I believe she ultimately wants banks to be a utility, a government utility, and not privately owned. But that part aside, she desperately wants to hold on to the centralization the control that comes with central banking. And while I'm not opposed to central banking, I think it does serve an important function.
00:10:36.342 - 00:10:48.694, Speaker E: And we're always going to have the traditional, in my mind, two tier banking system that we've become accustomed to. It's going to have to evolve into the 21st century. And when you talk about digital assets.
00:10:48.742 - 00:10:55.482, Speaker A: And crypto, they can't stop it if China can't stop it when they outlawed.
00:10:55.546 - 00:11:31.862, Speaker E: All mining, which they haven't been able to completely accomplish. What do you think the country that still practices freedom is going to do? This is not a Republican Democrat thing. This is literally control freak senators who do not want to lose their power over this. It's her people that occupy the White House primarily and her people that sit in these different cabinet positions. I mean, let's just talk about Gary Gensler at the SEC. He's a Warren disciple. This guy, in my mind, is a bad faith regulator.
00:11:31.862 - 00:12:00.254, Speaker E: He's been blindly spraying the crypto community with enforcement actions while completely missing the true bad actors. And people ask, what are we doing? We're going to continue to raise the siren of hypocrisy to show how hypocritical their behavior is. We're going to rely on some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle. You mentioned Rokana. You left out Soto.
00:12:00.302 - 00:12:00.466, Speaker A: Who?
00:12:00.488 - 00:12:28.698, Speaker E: I do work with Richie Torres. There are a whole bunch of nonpartisan. I mean, they definitely have their political perspective, Laura, but it's not a partisan issue for them, and that is alive and well. Those of us that are interested in seeing this digital asset crypto community, if I can talk that broadly, continue to grow in this country, will continue to push against what these guys are doing.
00:12:28.784 - 00:12:30.640, Speaker A: I believe they're just trying to protect.
00:12:31.170 - 00:12:49.346, Speaker E: Their control over this entire system. And the idea that they want to push forward a central bank digital currency that exposes them further. Laura because a CBDC is nothing more than a potential surveillance tool for a large, oversized central government run by a.
00:12:49.368 - 00:12:50.978, Speaker C: Few in a moment, we're going to.
00:12:50.984 - 00:12:52.578, Speaker B: Talk about other regulatory actions in the.
00:12:52.584 - 00:12:55.810, Speaker C: Crypto space and the geopolitical implications of what's happening.
00:12:55.880 - 00:12:58.680, Speaker B: But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible.

00:13:35.336 - 00:13:38.180, Speaker D: At Railway XYZ to find out more.
00:13:38.630 - 00:13:59.450, Speaker B: Back to my conversation with Representative Emmer. So you just brought up Gary Gensler, and he has said that Ether and other cryptos besides Bitcoin are securities. And as I'm sure you know, the CFTC said in its lawsuit against Binance that Ether and a few of the other cryptos are commodities. What can you do in Congress to create clarity about this?
00:13:59.600 - 00:14:29.170, Speaker E: Well, I mean, we can start moving some legislation through the House Financial Services Committee, which I think Patrick McHenry is committed to do. But it's interesting, we don't argue that enforcement is a bad thing. As you probably are aware, Laura, enforcement, when it's appropriate, is actually a good thing. And the CFTC's recent enforcement action that you referred to against Binance seems to, on its face, look like an appropriate use of the enforcement authority of that agency.
00:14:29.510 - 00:14:32.418, Speaker A: As you know, within the last week.
00:14:32.584 - 00:15:20.258, Speaker E: CFTC sued Binance for knowingly offering registered crypto derivatives products in the US to US customers, despite not being registered to do so, and saying publicly that it registered Americans from using the platform. So the enforcement action alleges that Binance did some shady things to conceal their customers'locations with VPNs and the like. This is different from what Gary Gensler has been doing over at the SEC, where he says he's got an open door, Laura, but a company like Coinbase, right, which accessed that open door and started working with Gary Gensler's SEC. By the way, Coinbase, I would argue, is one of the most regulatory compliant crypto companies out there.
00:15:20.424 - 00:15:21.698, Speaker A: Well, guess what?
00:15:21.864 - 00:15:30.834, Speaker E: Gary Gensler might have an open door, but it is an enter at your own risk door. Because what he does is, despite several.
00:15:30.882 - 00:15:34.566, Speaker A: Meetings over several months, gary Gensler's SEC.
00:15:34.668 - 00:16:23.558, Speaker E: Refused to provide feedback on a product. It was called the Earned Product, that Coinbase was looking to list. And instead, after all these meetings and nothing happening, the SEC slapped Coinbase with a Wells notice regarding the very issues on which Coinbase was asking for their feedback. Clearly not the way the government should be serving Americans. And it sends a clear message, I believe, to the broader crypto community. And that directly is Gary Gensler is not regulating in good faith. So you got the CFTC example, but then you've got this ongoing stuff with the SEC, which is not good for innovation and entrepreneurial activity right here in.
00:16:23.564 - 00:16:25.558, Speaker C: The US, as the US appears to.
00:16:25.564 - 00:17:00.450, Speaker B: Be becoming less friendly to crypto and even driving the industry offshore. We are on the other hand seeing that China is going full steam ahead on a number of blockchain projects as well as its digital yuan and China and Russia recently agreed to use the Chinese yuan for settlements between Russia and the countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America. So when you take those facts into account with what seems to be happening now in the US around crypto, where do you think this could end up in terms of the effects on the US's economic power globally?
00:17:00.790 - 00:18:04.774, Speaker E: Look, we're under attack right mean you probably have seen the know there are offers by other nations to replace the dollar with their currency because of the potential problems that they're alleging with our banking system and obviously some challenges that we are creating with our inability to govern ourselves at the federal level going back because it's interesting. I'm not so worried about the digital yuan. Russia can do that at their risk. The Chinese you do not want to deal with kind of like when they were hosting the Olympics, they were going to give every Olympian some digital yuan. That's like telling them that here's this great new technology called TikTok, don't mind us, we're just going to harvest all of your data and we're going to track you on our stuff. Doesn't end well. Typically for us it's disturbing because you didn't ask directly about it.
00:18:04.774 - 00:19:05.802, Speaker E: But the Biden administration's recent economic report, if you took a look at that they talk about, well we know crypto technology is in its infancy and the White House in this report concluded that crypto has no real value to our society. Well they conclude that crypto doesn't offer any value to our society. But then they turn around and say that fed now their real time payment settlement system and central bank digital currencies will look Laura, crypto will thrive with or without the United States. It's unfortunate to see this administration and unelected bureaucrats try so hard to polarize a technology and pursue regulatory actions that are only going to limit the US economic development and opportunities for Americans. Which goes directly to your question. That does not put us in the lead, it puts us in the back of the line.
00:19:05.936 - 00:19:08.780, Speaker C: And do you feel that your colleagues agree with that.
00:19:10.510 - 00:19:16.880, Speaker B: Just from what's happening and it seems like they're trying to push crypto offshore. It feels like they don't recognize that.
00:19:17.250 - 00:19:42.114, Speaker E: Some I mean I think you got three different kinds and you've got members that I've described, republicans, Democrats, take away the partisan Jersey, they understand how important this is. Right. It's funny, I had someone high up in our government tell me last week, which you might have heard me talking about in a different interview, that crypto is wampum.
00:19:42.242 - 00:19:43.222, Speaker A: And I said, really?
00:19:43.276 - 00:20:11.322, Speaker E: Well describe that to me. And he went through describing how it's not real and then got to the end and said, well Gold, well you can make the argument. And then he stopped. He said, look, we've had gold for a long time, and everybody accepts that. You got to break out of the way you've looked at finance in the past. We are moving into a completely different era of finance. The old, as I've talked about, in some fashion, we will always have intermediaries, in my belief.
00:20:11.322 - 00:20:46.842, Speaker E: You will always have some form of the two tier traditional banking system that we've become accustomed to, because there will be value that you want to derive from that. Somebody to watch over the transaction, to verify the transaction. But the future is you and myself, Laura, doing business directly with one another. We don't need the central authority because we have a blockchain that is open, permissionless, and transparent. Everyone can see what's happening on it. Self policing. This is where we're headed, and it should happen in the United States.
00:20:46.842 - 00:20:59.566, Speaker E: There is a group that believes this. There's another group that I just think they're still skeptical. I had somebody tell me that the problem with crypto is it's the wild, wild west of finance. And as I'm talking to them, trying.
00:20:59.588 - 00:21:02.800, Speaker A: To explain, to know the regulations all apply.
00:21:03.490 - 00:21:32.970, Speaker E: Yes, there are some updating things that some of us have proposed, but you have the regulations in place, and it's not the wild, wild west. And then there's a third group. To answer your question. The third group, unfortunately, is very partisan. And I mean, we've had the problem on the Republican side, but we don't have the White House right now. When we did have the White House, we had people in the White House that were adamantly opposed. There were people in the White House that were actually trying to help us move this forward.
00:21:32.970 - 00:22:11.974, Speaker E: Now we've got a new administration, and they have their soldiers in the House and the Senate that they're willing to take whatever marching orders the White House gives them without regard for what is in the best interest, in my humble opinion, and just march with those orders. I prefer to work with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and Republicans who have an open mind and understand that this is not only going to happen with or without us, but we want this to happen right here on the shores of the United States where Americans can derive the benefits that would be associated with it.
00:22:12.092 - 00:22:19.338, Speaker B: Last quick question, Fed. Now, the upcoming Federal Reserve Payment system is going to launch this summer. You've been quite critical of it.
00:22:19.424 - 00:22:19.770, Speaker D: Why?
00:22:19.840 - 00:22:21.340, Speaker B: What would you prefer to see?
00:22:21.870 - 00:23:12.890, Speaker E: Let the private sector do this stuff. This is our government once again trying to compete with the private sector. This is our government once again, I believe, controlling all finance. You control the money and you control the water and you control the people, right? This is literally what defines our freedom, is our ability, our financial system in this country, our ability to be able to create an idea and then go out and solicit startup capital. By the way, I don't need my government's permission or I should not need my government's permission or oversight to go out and seek that. That's the definition of freedom in this country. That's how we create tomorrow's small business that turns into I'm sorry, today's small business that turns into tomorrow's big business in this country.
00:23:12.890 - 00:23:55.218, Speaker E: That's why we have been so successful. And literally, whether it's Fed now, which I've never seen the federal government do anything as advanced in technology as the private sector, but FedNow and CBDCs are nothing more to me than the government trying to consolidate its authority over the financial system. And quite frankly, that means over the individuals that access that system. And I would like to see it be decentralized. I think that's the whole purpose is to put people back in charge of their own decisions without regard to what their government may want them to do or not do. Give us back our freedom.
00:23:55.394 - 00:24:00.274, Speaker B: All right, well, it has been such a pleasure having you on the show. Thank you so much for coming on Unchained.
00:24:00.322 - 00:24:01.846, Speaker E: It's always good to be with you, Laura.
00:24:01.878 - 00:24:02.700, Speaker A: Thank you.

Mev blocker routes transactions through a network of searchers structured to block front running and sandwich attacks. Users will receive 90% of the profits that searchers bid to backrun transactions, while Validators will receive 10% of the profits. Mevbots have reportedly extracted more than $1.38 billion from users, impacting traders, liquidity providers and NFT minters alike.

Of course it's the bitcoin. White paper. A user by the name of Burned 178 1st discovered this back in April of 2021. Buried within the image capture utilities virtual scanner two function. Alongside a nondescript image of a San Francisco bay lies a PDF copy of Satoshi Nakamoto's bitcoin white paper.

00:36:02.666 - 00:36:49.546, Speaker F: As they always say, if at first you don't succeed, be a rich dude in crypto, sue zoo and kyle Davies, the founders of the bankrupt crypto hedge fund Three AC are back. They're launching an exchange for insolvent crypto claims, which feels a little bit like giving people paper cuts and then charging for overpriced bandaids. One of the premises of their company open exchange is to offer claimants for bankrupt funds like FTX and celsius the chance to be made whole. Given that FTX claims right now are trading at $0.20 on the dollar, it's possible that their definition of whole is the same as SBF's. The venture successfully raised $25 million from investors, which does make me wonder if the vibe in VC right now is like, what's there to lose? CEO Leslie Lamb has said that the goal of the new fund is to help the crypto industry. And let me just say, we love a pivot.
00:36:49.546 - 00:37:02.882, Speaker F: Three AC case is not settled, and US. Authorities have actually issued a subpoena to Kyle Davies via Twitter. You know that Twitter could be used to issue subpoenas didn't, but to me, it's no crazier than the idea that FTS claimants could be made whole.
