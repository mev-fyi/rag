00:00:00.400 - 00:00:10.805, Speaker A: I think that there are a lot of benefits potentially that could come from this, especially given who's backing it and who is running it, that can make it get to the next level in terms of new user adoption.
00:00:11.145 - 00:00:16.913, Speaker B: Oh, interesting. Like, meaning you feel that they can onboard kind of like new crypto people.
00:00:17.089 - 00:00:59.085, Speaker A: Right. And this is exactly why, this is the reason that I agreed to come and help on this is because I think there's going to be a lot of new people come in because of the people who are running it, who I've known for a while, and because of the people who are backing it, you know, such as the Trumps, for example. Almost certainly this is going to bring in a whole new breed of people who are going to have no idea what they're doing. Right. And so onboarding, like from a UX perspective is like super complicated for most people. And it's really, you know, they're prone to make mistakes. And I think that one place where I was really hoping that I'll be able to be helpful with this is advising them on ways to make sure that the people who are coming on board, the new people who would have no idea what they.
