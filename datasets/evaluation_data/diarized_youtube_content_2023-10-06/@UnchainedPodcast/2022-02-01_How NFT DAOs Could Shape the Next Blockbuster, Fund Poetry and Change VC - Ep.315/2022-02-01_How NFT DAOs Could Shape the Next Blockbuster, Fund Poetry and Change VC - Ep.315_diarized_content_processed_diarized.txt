00:00:00.410 - 00:00:00.670, Speaker A: It.
00:00:00.740 - 00:00:49.462, Speaker B: Hi all. As you know, my book The Cryptopians comes out February 22. I wanted to share a blurb that Michael Casey, chief content officer at CoinDesk and coauthor of The Age of Cryptocurrency, wrote about it. Michael said Laura Shin's compelling blow by blow account of the remarkable birth and growth of Ethereum shows that its spectacular wealth generation was not without struggle. By Shin's, telling the story of Ethereum is a grand human drama. Its lesson is that for all the talk of decentralized codebased virtual machines, a successful crypto project's biggest challenge is that it must survive its user communities, internessine conflicts, and rise above the egos of its brilliant but humanly flawed founders. If that intrigues you, then preorder the cryptopians idealism.
00:00:49.462 - 00:01:26.758, Speaker B: Greed lies in the making of the first big cryptocurrency craze today at Bitly Cryptopians. That's bit ly cryptopians. And the book comes out February 22. And again, you can preorder it at bitly cryptopians. Hi all. As you may know, a few months ago I started a Facebook Bulletin newsletter.

00:04:12.130 - 00:04:13.840, Speaker A: Hi, thank you for having me.
00:04:14.210 - 00:04:26.830, Speaker B: Thanks for being here. So you used to be a DJ and you also created the famous CGI influencer, Lil Michaela. Tell us about your background and what you were doing before you got into crypto.
00:04:27.810 - 00:05:25.870, Speaker A: DAOs, I typically say in these kind of like, tech interviews, I have an Atypical background, but I feel like folks in crypto come from all walks of life. Maybe mine is more typical than Atypical, but yeah, I grew up in the Midwest. I grew up in Davenport, Iowa and moved to Los Angeles when I was 16. And while I was in La, I was playing in bands and I was doing some kind of like web dev stuff, building mom and pop shop websites and real long story short, went to university, played football, quit and stumbled into music. I was in a rap group called Schweze that ended up putting out a Top Ten album in 2008, which was totally surreal. I never had a passport before 23, was getting to go to Europe to play music, and in parallel I was building software tools for myself and for other friends and artists who needed things. I've kind of always lived at this intersection of music and technology, really media and technology, culture, industries and technology more broadly.
00:05:25.870 - 00:06:09.140, Speaker A: And I toured as a solo artist, a DJ. After that, band produced music. A bunch of pop acts played music festivals, did all the things that folks who are kind of doing music full time do and got a phone call from some folks of Spotify saying, hey, we need someone that can translate between a bunch of Swedish engineers and the music industry. And took a job at Spotify in, I think, 2011, which seems surreal now, and got to see what it's like to be a part of a massive and to ship a really incredible product. And from there we're on to start Bread, which created Little Michaela and kind of a modern Disney or Marvel with some virtual celebrities, and more recently started Friends of Benefits about a year and a half.
00:06:09.750 - 00:06:17.330, Speaker B: Yeah, let's explore that Bread period a little bit. What was Bread and what was the goal with Lil Michaela?
00:06:17.910 - 00:07:10.340, Speaker A: Yeah, so Bread still very much exists. So the goal was really to try to create a celebrity and really scalable narrative there's started with this idea that media can be transformative, that in my lifetime I had seen more change from television programs that have grabbed kind of crazy dominant narratives versus public policy. So television programs like Will and Grace that are largely responsible for gay marriage in the US. Or even programs like the Jeffersons or other programs that help shape the way Americans understood African Americans. And so the dream was to say, hey, in an era with more global issues than ever, whether it be economic or climate or pandemic, if we could create celebrity and narratives that scale like software that can touch billions. Perhaps we could kind of nudge the whole world into being more empathetic or more tolerant or more effective at creating the change that we want to.
00:07:11.210 - 00:07:15.858, Speaker B: And do you feel that you achieved that goal with Lil Michaela? Like, what was the impact?
00:07:16.034 - 00:08:04.034, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I still feel like we're in the first inning thus far, we've had a ton of impact. I mean, 10 million plus fans across Socials Michaela's released songs that have been like top of viral charts on Spotify globally. And so across all mediums from still images to video and audio, we've had a ton of impact. Again, we're just getting started. The bet was really kind of on this emergent, I guess what folks are calling now, the metaverse, what I called kind of like spatial computing era, this next shift in computing. And we always saw virtual goods and virtual economies as being a big part of that. And so, in parallel, I spent a lot of time in crypto and Web Three, and we were pretty quick to embrace the NFT thing and really see decentralized governance and virtual economies as being a big part of enabling that next Disney or that next Marvel.
00:08:04.034 - 00:08:10.840, Speaker A: And so we're just getting started. We've got a long way ahead of us and decentralizing bread and turning it into a Dao is next on the.
00:08:14.090 - 00:08:26.058, Speaker B: You know, as you just mentioned. So Dapper labs acquired bread and launched Dapper collectives from that So why did you decide to sell bread to Dapper? And then what is the vision for Dapper Collectives?
00:08:26.234 - 00:09:13.870, Speaker A: Yeah, certainly a I've been a fan of Roham's for a very long time. I often joke that when we were fundraising, we'd be, like, walking into these very serious Silicon Valley boardrooms and pitching like, fake people on the Internet. And I'd always feel kind of guilty, but then I'd watch a guy walk out of room who was, like, pitching selling pictures of cats on the Internet. And so we were kind of always the weirdos in these very serious boardrooms asking for large sums of money. And I always thought what he was doing was quite brave. I thought that the thing that Rohan recognized quite quickly was that most of our world is non fungible. And I thought that was a really unique insight to double down and to work through the bear and to ship a product that onboarded lots of people into crypto and Web Three was really, really compelling.
00:09:13.870 - 00:09:57.350, Speaker A: That said, the acquisition came really from us raising around. We were raising around that was going to be a little more crypto focused because we're decentralizing the company. And in talking about partners that we wanted to work with, we fell in love with flow. We wanted to build it on flow. They had bigger ambitions than just a single Dao on flow. I think they and Rohan, the rest of the team, understand how impactful this stuff can be and how DAOs will be at the center of all of this stuff going forward. And so to have really incredible resources, people that are really aligned culturally, I always kind of joke that our team is a bunch of soft spoken, really nice brainy people to meet even nicer Canadian versions of us was a little compelling.
00:09:57.350 - 00:10:09.440, Speaker A: And so all in all, I think it allows us to do what we want to do and to build these primitives that other folks can use and really kind of help shape this future that we all want to see come to the past. And so that was why this came together.
00:10:10.130 - 00:10:14.298, Speaker B: So what is the vision for Dapper collectives? Like, what are you trying to achieve?
00:10:14.474 - 00:10:49.670, Speaker A: Yeah, so we're going to be mainstreaming DAOs. As kind of vague as that sounds, the dream is to build the primitives that others can use to recognize and capture the value that they create. And that sounds intentionally big as well because I think it's really big. The opportunity folks in my world, creative people kind of joke about how people selling JPEGs for $70 million. But I think if you were to start from first principles and say what is really valuable in this life of ours, I don't know that you'd start with equities and bonds. You'd probably start with art and music and media and food. These things give our lives meaning.
00:10:49.670 - 00:11:40.666, Speaker A: And there have been a lot of obviously rent seeking middlemen and platforms in the middle of that creative process who've captured a lot of that value. And so we think DAOs can enable media companies like our own to recognize and realize that value and to make sure it flows to the edges of the network. It also allows us to bring our fans and our peers really into the fold. Traditionally, they've been siloed. There have been Disney on one side and then Star Wars fans on the other. And every now and then Disney's calling Star Wars fans to figure out what the weather in Tatooine would be like because they have more knowledge than the folks internally at Disney. And we know kind of blowing up those silos and bringing people under one roof and aligning incentives such that people can work together could be really meaningful and hopefully solve a lot of the pain that's especially felt in media orgs, but really in any collective or any organization.
00:11:40.666 - 00:11:54.180, Speaker A: And so that's why we're thinking about collectives people coming together, trying to realize important things and using consensus and web3 and the privilege that we create to organize and realize them.
00:11:55.830 - 00:12:08.340, Speaker B: Just in your vision of whatever this future is, of all these different Dows, all these different collectives, what will they be doing? What is kind of the variety of different types of Dows that you see?
00:12:09.350 - 00:12:58.530, Speaker A: Oh gosh, they're endless. I mean, somewhat we can probably talk about principles of benefits is kind of an easy answer to that question. But I think the really compelling stuff for people that are especially in our industry in media is we have a generation of kind of web, two media orgs that are probably quite frustrated. I think if you're an employee at Vice or at Refinery 29 you've probably seen some stock options depreciate tremendously. If you're an investor, you're probably quite frustrated and if you're an operator, you're probably quite frustrated. And I think that's because there clearly is demand for this media and this content and I don't know that there are effective business models. One of the things that the attention that I've always lived with is this idea that information wants to be free, that people and ideas should be able to spread virally and touch people and change the world.
00:12:58.530 - 00:13:48.120, Speaker A: But at the same time the people that are creating those ideas should be able to make a living and feed themselves. And so I think NFTs as a primitive solve for that thing that they allow people ideas and allow for media to be both individually ownable and universally accessible. And so with that at the center of this potential business model, can we start to create primitives that incentivize people to create those assets, participate in creation of those assets, and then see an outcome that rewards them but also has, like, funds flow to a treasury that can allow this thing to exist and to continue to expand? And so, in short, incentivizing people to create media assets and then making sure if they participate in that creation, they get a piece of the upside of the sale of that media asset as an NFT and then fund flowing to a treasury that allows us to or any other to build better tooling and do things better, faster, cheaper, whatever they see fit.
00:13:48.730 - 00:14:25.082, Speaker B: Yeah, you are definitely preaching to the choir. As a creator and as a journalist whose career started with the Internet, like I worked@newsweek.com, that was my first job. And then the wallstreetjournal.com and then the New York Times.com. And I think roughly a decade after I started@newsweek.com, newsweek was sold for a, you know, to go from because also the year I started working there was the year that Newsweek had been leading this story with Monica Lewinsky and President Bill Clinton.
00:14:25.082 - 00:15:16.466, Speaker B: And so it was kind of like a very cool place to be working then. And then just to see that brand kind of collapse. And not because the work wasn't good, but just because of how somehow this fallacy that information wants to be free was what the media companies glommed onto, and they were wrong. You can charge money and people will pay for things that they know. When Dapper Labs acquired bread and they announced Dapper Collectives, dapper Labs CEO Roham Karagoslu, who you've been mentioning here, told Decrypt, quote, the space of DAOs is probably the most interesting space to us after NFTs and very complementary to the work we're doing, both with big brands as well as our own IP. So how do you see NFTs and DAOs coexisting or converging or otherwise complementing each other?
00:15:16.648 - 00:16:30.566, Speaker A: Yes, they're probably really simple, obvious ways, right? Like investor dows, flamingo dows, other examples of people that have come together to collect and share on the upside of the NFTs that they built or that they've created or pardon me, that they've bought and brought into their dow. But beyond that, like I mentioned before, I think there are examples where NFTs at the center of a business model that a Dao is organized around, is a really important primitive that I think is yet to be unleashed in the world. And so we're really thinking about that. I often talk about how powerful it is that the DeFi folks might be familiar with like a yearn where if you're creating a new strategy for a vault, you can participate in the upside of that vault. There is a world where a dow is putting up bounties for coverage of a certain topic and people are executing against coverage of that topic, whether it be in video or written form, whatever it is, and then publishing that as an NFT. And folks are collecting that because it's an important work. At FWB, we sold Matthew Ball's metaverse essay for half a million dollars, which is nuts, right? It's an essay that lives for free on the Internet.
00:16:30.566 - 00:17:16.402, Speaker A: But I think there's obviously a collectible nature to all of these things of history. People collecting time, magazines, other important assets. I think you're going to see them get fragmented. I often think of someone like yourself or even like Eric Weinstein is coming up with Neoloticisms all the time. If you could own the first clip of a podcast as a catchy phrase as we're all going to make it, or something that's become a battle cry, is that important and collectible? I think so. And so I think there's a ton of opportunity around taking media and all the things that we're creating on the internet because all of us are creators and allowing people to collect bits of them or parts of them. And then as you extend know, all the things that we're creating and sharing online make us storytellers.
00:17:16.402 - 00:17:35.120, Speaker A: And so I think a lot about what we do at Bright as kind of being this kind of uber storyteller or Uber creator. And if we can solve for ourselves, there's lots of things that we can kind of hand down to the individual creator or smaller creator to help enable and kind of improve their lives.
00:17:36.050 - 00:17:48.722, Speaker B: And just on a technical level, for the work that Dapper Collectives is doing, will that all be on the Flow blockchain? Or are these products that you'll be building for any chain or how will that work on the back end?
00:17:48.856 - 00:18:10.570, Speaker A: These are all going to be on Flow. Another reason I'm really excited about Dapper is that we are very excited about Flow. Obviously, Deeter, who's spearheading it, is the person that invented the NFT. And so I think to be with visionary folks who could see the future and help us think about how blockchains can be built, such as scalable and mainstreamable, was a really big part of the decision.
00:18:11.710 - 00:18:17.980, Speaker B: All right, so now let's talk about Friends with Benefits. Tell people what that Dow is.
00:18:18.430 - 00:18:55.350, Speaker A: Yeah. Wow, it's so ambitious. Now, it's probably hard to contain in a couple of sentences, but Friends With Benefits is an ethereum based Dao. We often talk about like a virtual city. Some people describe it as like a virtual social club where we minted some tokens, and if you have 75 of them, you're allowed to participate in a private discord in our governance and then attend live events around the world. Beyond that, there's software products and other things that are being developed. But the nuts and bolts of it are if you own tokens, you get to be a part of this private club or community and participate in shaping its trajectory where it heads.
00:18:56.010 - 00:19:18.480, Speaker B: So at times in the past, the entry fee to the highest level of 75 FWB was more than $10,000. Right now, it's like slightly under $4,000. What do you say to people who criticize Friends With Benefits as just being an expensive or exclusive online social club or even chat group?
00:19:19.170 - 00:20:03.750, Speaker A: I usually say fork it. That, to me, is the beauty of Web Three, is that all these things exist so that people can kind of build their reality. That said, I can understand how it can be a contentious thing. And one of the things that our community has done is create fellowship programs and other programs that make sure that underrepresented people in the space are a part of our community. And so my opinions haven't always been in alignment with the community, and I think that's the beauty of the Dao. In my day to day life, I'm a dictator in FWB. I am just another mere citizen of this virtual city who thinks that creating robust, sensible boundaries are one of the most important parts to defining a community.
00:20:03.750 - 00:20:41.820, Speaker A: I think what the community has said is we agree ish like, we want there to be boundaries that make this a space where people can have conversations they might not be able to have in other places. We want a space where people are challenged and their ideas are elevated, but we also want it to be a space where anyone who could improve this space can exist and so that's why things like fellowships come to pass. That's why we see lots of people in the community know buying NFTs on zora in FWB so that those artists can join, other things like that. In short, I understand that they're concerns, and I think that the beauty of web3 is you can fork this stuff and build whatever kind of better thing you want to build.
00:20:42.190 - 00:20:48.810, Speaker B: And so when you look at the applications for the fellowships, what kinds of qualities are you prioritizing?
00:20:49.390 - 00:21:12.802, Speaker A: That's a great question. I wish I could answer it accurately. We have a fellowships committee. One of the things that's cool about FWB is these different subcommittees. There are local city groups, there's a membership committee that's betting anyone who applies to join. And there's a fellowships committee that's actually headed up by a few folks, one of them being Pat Locke, who's a very influential artist, DJ, and producer. And those folks are looking for lots of things.
00:21:12.802 - 00:21:29.020, Speaker A: I think most importantly, they're trying to create a community that reflects the real world. I think there are definitely folks who got a head start, but women, people of color, other folks who might not make up the FWV community yet, that we can identify and bring in and bring it up to speed. We absolutely want to do that.
00:21:29.870 - 00:21:33.930, Speaker B: And at the moment, how many members are at that highest tier?
00:21:34.670 - 00:21:46.720, Speaker A: That's a good question. It's constantly evolving, usually around 2000 that are in FWB and hanging out. I probably shouldn't fire up discord and look now, because it may slow this thing down. We'll say 2000.
00:21:49.250 - 00:22:06.614, Speaker B: Yeah. Definitely don't want to cause us any technical issues. So since FWB votes are one token, one vote, they can be dominated by whales, do you think that model should be changed, or are you happy with that model, or what do you think of that fact?
00:22:06.812 - 00:23:01.382, Speaker A: Yeah, and so some votes are one token, one vote, other votes are one account, one vote. I'm interested in all of these little petri dishes of governance, trying lots of different things. That's one of the things I'm most excited about in web3 is we kind of get to speed run wall street and yeah, the global art market, but more importantly, governance. I've seen some cool things around one account, one vote that does open you up to civil attacks and some other things. One of the things that we've kind of innovated on that I'm quite proud of is this proof of raver concept where people that come to our live events, they're token gated. So if you come out and dance, you're effectively validated that you're a real person. And so there's a world where if we're throwing enough events, we effectively have this civil proof of raver list that we can then have vote on things.
00:23:01.382 - 00:23:24.030, Speaker A: And so there are lots of trade offs and I think trying to build novel solutions like throwing fun parties. People want to come to where you can kind of validate humanity with honey versus with vinegar or another kind of creepier ways that may be being funded out there, people may have talked about on Twitter, a whole bunch. We can solve for some of these things and build better governance models because it's all jump ball right now. It's all to be defined.
00:23:24.610 - 00:23:34.020, Speaker B: And I do know that at the start, I think you had somewhere in the ballpark of 10% of all the FWB tokens. What percentage do you have now?
00:23:34.710 - 00:23:46.790, Speaker A: That's a good question. Providing liquidity means il for days. And so, I don't know, I think probably somewhere in the ballpark of 5%, but again, it fluctuates.
00:23:47.690 - 00:24:02.170, Speaker B: And is that something that people just seem okay with because you are the creator? Or do you see kind of more, I guess, initiatives to try to democratize things even further?
00:24:02.910 - 00:24:36.930, Speaker A: I would love for the tokens to be as democratized as possible. I think thus far, what we've tried to express to the community, I think what they've expressed back, is that we're going to iterate quickly and change things that don't feel right. And so we do these things called seasons. So every season we basically come up with a theme and we say, hey, in the previous quarter, previous three months, these things went well and these things went poorly and just things went poorly. We're going to do x and double down. The things went well, we're going to do x. And so I think one of the things that we've had a lot of success with is not trying to set really fixed ways of understanding how this thing will look.
00:24:36.930 - 00:24:46.600, Speaker A: We want to be able to change, we want to be able to tweak things. We want to be able to build the most sustainable, resilient FWB we can, even if it gets started. It's kind of a weekend ha ha project.
00:24:47.690 - 00:24:53.930, Speaker B: And so what are some of those things that went well and then what are some of the things that you guys have been trying to improve upon?
00:24:54.430 - 00:25:30.162, Speaker A: Yeah, I think live events have gone really well, candidly. We've been able to bring in a bunch of really special people. Alex Chang is the mayor of FWB, and he really oversees day to day, and he was very bullish on live events. I think my crypto history and scars of the past have led me to be wary of things that are off chain. But there was a clear demand. People had built really meaningful relationships in discords and on Telegrams and on twitter, and they wanted to hang out in person and hug each other. And so doing events that were, I think that looked felt different than a lot of crypto events.
00:25:30.162 - 00:26:03.466, Speaker A: And bringing people together in spaces has been incredibly bullish for our community. People want to be a part of those things. Beyond that, I would say the fellowships program has been incredibly well received. People have really enjoyed that. We've tried other things, even things as simple as discord channels. In the era of clubhouse, when there were lots of really hyped clubhouse, like, say, Elon Musk in a clubhouse channel or whatever it was, we would create these discord channels. People would kind of like, chat about it happening in real time and, okay, fine, not that compelling.
00:26:03.466 - 00:26:23.160, Speaker A: And so we shut it down and forget about, you know, beyond that, every day is an experiment. Right now, some of the people in the community are making an urban Mate drink, an FWV branded drink. There's an FWV festival coming to pass, so the community takes this thing wherever they want to take it.
00:26:24.170 - 00:26:38.234, Speaker B: And I have seen that currently FWB has a $53 million market cap. So I'm assuming that's sort of like what your treasury is. Maybe I'm wrong about that.
00:26:38.432 - 00:26:48.720, Speaker A: That, to me, I think is the token price times the amount of tokens that exist. So a million tokens times $53 is probably how Coin Gecko is getting that.
00:26:51.010 - 00:26:53.790, Speaker B: What then is the treasury for the Dow?
00:26:54.550 - 00:27:40.590, Speaker A: I need to go look as far as USD terms, but I think you may have seen the community voted on a treasury diversification where Andreessen Horowitz pays Capital, Legion, others kindred came in and purchased FWV tokens that were locked up in exchange for USDC. And so in that treasury, you'll find ethereum, actually some whale, which could be a cool thing you discussed as well, is different Dows doing treasury diversifications, I think, to kind of hedge against outperformance of either or kind of larger communities at whole. And so in our treasury, you'll have some whale, some ethereum, some USDC, and maybe some AirDrop shitcoins.
00:27:43.910 - 00:27:46.660, Speaker B: Just describe the whale in more detail.
00:27:47.270 - 00:28:39.940, Speaker A: Yeah, so for folks that aren't aware of whale, but early on in our journey, there weren't a ton of community tokens, and it was largely ourselves and Whale, which was started by, I believe, a pseudonymous character named Whale Shark who wanted to create this token that could have a say or participate in all this NFT collecting. And so Whale Shark had a ton of really important stuff, and we were really excited about the ways they were exploring their community. They're actually doing things that are pretty different than what we had done. And so actually, Cooper Trolley on our team and Whale Shark had known each other and they talked about, hey, maybe we should float it to the communities of doing kind of a token. So, you know, we can hold X amount of whale, you can hold X amount of, you know, that way, as this thing plays out, we kind of have this incentive to go support each other and help each other.
00:28:41.350 - 00:29:01.382, Speaker B: Okay, it's interesting. One other aspect of all this that I find fascinating is the VCs that you mentioned that now are participating, andreessen, as you mentioned, legion a variant fund. So what is the purpose of having venture capital. Involved in this basically like a social.
00:29:01.436 - 00:30:01.702, Speaker A: Club dow you're asking, like, a very good question. And I think one of the questions that the community asked over and over and over again, it's like, yeah, they want to be involved. Why? And so one of the things that was very intriguing for me was traditionally in my life, I've had to walk into a boardroom full of 13 scary, impressive people and pitch them as to why they should give me money. And I think for the first time in my life, what we had I think the first time my life, we had VCs pitching the community. So we had a discord meeting where investors like Brian Watson from Spark and Chris Dixon and Steve Chang, Tina from Pace and others came in and basically made their case. And I don't want to speak on behalf of them, but I think some of the things the community really recognized and really resonated with was these weren't trading funds that were going to buy tokens and dump on us. They're interested in holding these things for four to seven years minimum.
00:30:01.702 - 00:30:48.134, Speaker A: They've got quite a bit of expertise in building organizations. They know how to navigate some of the things that might come up, whether it's hiring a regulatory or X, Y, or Z. And more than anything else, I think the community vibed with them, which is maybe I don't know how you would build a taxonomy of vibes, but Steve Jang especially had really interesting, good snacks. One of the things the community asked is, what snacks do you guys like throughout the day? And so Steve, his snacks resonated, and the community was like, we like this guy. He gets it. We want to give him more. And so, look, these are some of the novelties and the interesting things that come up with direct democracy, is people having a say and sometimes snacks way to vote.
00:30:48.262 - 00:30:52.954, Speaker B: Wait, you mean like actual physical snacks that he's munching on throughout the day?
00:30:53.072 - 00:31:38.630, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a discord, so it can be kind of ship hosty, right. And people were like, okay, what do you want to do? You guys seem shady. I don't know if I should trust you. And they dissuade a lot of those things and I think made really compelling cases for how they add value. And by the end, it was like, all right, so you guys are saying the right things, but as a real litmus test, like, what do you do on the weekends? What do you enjoy for snacks? And I think some people could have said, seeing as I'm on the carnivore diet and trying to run a hundred mile marathon, I only eat X, Y, and Z. But no, these are FWB kids. And so an appreciation for Japanese kauai snacks or other rare snacks made them think that these folks were real heads.
00:31:38.630 - 00:31:47.040, Speaker A: And so, yeah, having a good snack game can get you exposure to a Dow in this wild world we're being a part of.
00:31:47.890 - 00:32:24.326, Speaker B: I love it. I find this hilarious. So, as you mentioned, Alexander Zhang is dubbed the mayor of FWB, and he said actually in an interview that he used to hate crypto and the people in it. And I guess he obviously feels very differently about FWB. So who are the people that are involved in FWB? Obviously, besides the VCs that we mentioned, just in general, kind of the everyday person that's in it? Are they people who are normal crypto people? Are they non crypto people who just heard about this or what's the mix?
00:32:24.518 - 00:33:34.074, Speaker A: Yeah, I think one of the things that FWB has kind of been known for is having quite a different makeup. I would imagine for most of FWB, if you were to say, what's a zero knowledge proof they'd be like, I don't really know, and I don't know if they're interested. I think what really spoke to them was this world where you could create value for people that are putting it into the ether. And so as a result, a lot of them are artists, a lot of them are musicians, a lot of them are folks that have kind of lived adjacent to technology, maybe not in it full time. And then there is a good cross section of pure technologists that I think want exposure to people they wouldn't find at a traditional crypto conference. Some of the most vibrant channels in FWB are like the parenting and skincare channels, and so the selfies and fit channels, as much as NFT general chat goes off, people are as interested in figuring out how to be better parents. And there's something about the signal to noise ratio in a group of people that all have ownership in a thing that really kind of increases the signal and reduces the noise.
00:33:34.074 - 00:33:48.280, Speaker A: And so there's all kinds of little magic this stuff has clicked up that I can't put my finger on and definitely can't take credit for, but I think one of them really is a high signal to noise ratio in all of these little subsets and little mini burrows inside of our virtual city.
00:33:50.090 - 00:34:09.020, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess the way you're talking, it sort of makes me think of how people have their crypto sorry, their Twitter lists. And if you could just kind of have that one contained list as its own chat group that then has its own channels, I guess it's sort of what it's like anyway. All right.
00:34:10.590 - 00:34:31.474, Speaker A: Like a group chat. Like if you had hugged most of those people in that Twitter list and there were some kind of real interactions that kind of tied you all together and made you want to go above and beyond responding to how to help a child that's teething. That's how I would describe yeah, yeah.
00:34:31.592 - 00:35:30.214, Speaker B: Because yeah, it starts offline, but yeah, you're right. Or online, but then it goes offline, which I find very interesting and fun. All right, so in a moment we're going to talk about some of the questions around FWB. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible. Bosonic is the new decentralized financial market infrastructure. Bosonic eliminates counterparty credit and settlement risk for institutions. Do you want to gain maximum capital efficiency with the lowest possible risk? Do you want to separate custody from liquidity provision?

00:37:17.670 - 00:37:48.290, Speaker B: Back to my conversation with Trevor. So I have been wondering, are there concerns that FWB could be a security? Because just like based on the definition of a security as applied to crypto tokens, if it's an investment contract with the expectation of profits dependent on the efforts of an identifiable party, then wouldn't the value of this token FWB be determined by the group members of FWB?
00:37:49.030 - 00:38:17.370, Speaker A: It's a good question and probably one I would leave up to the lawyers. But in our understanding and our talking with lawyers, really what we're offering is a ticket, right? And so a ticket into the club. And oftentimes tickets have like secondary speculative value, but they all kind of have this utility of coming into the club. And so I'm definitely not a lawyer, and this is not legal advice or financial advice or whatever other disclaimer I'm supposed to give. But I've talked to some and that's how they describe.
00:38:19.310 - 00:38:32.430, Speaker B: Then when FWB is trying to figure out what it's going to do or not do, are there any particular activities that the group either tries to discourage or stay away from in order to not cross any of those lines?
00:38:32.770 - 00:39:02.680, Speaker A: Yeah, certainly. I mean, it's a very common thought, like, hey, we should start a fund from FWV, and we're pretty quick to be like, hey, that probably feels like a regulatory no, no, I don't think that we want to be in the business of that, and so we don't do that. I think what we try to do is, like, there are events, and some of those events happen on Discord and some of them happen IRL, but having those tickets in the form of tokens allows you to participate in those things.
00:39:03.530 - 00:39:18.206, Speaker B: And so Fabb did recently publish a post on its plans for 2022. And one of the more interesting aspects was you mentioned you're going to have an FWB directory. Can you describe that? And also the technology that will enable that?
00:39:18.388 - 00:40:06.014, Speaker A: Yeah, and really I should have, like, Mike Bodge and Dexter and others on the product team speak to that more accurately because I'll probably flub it here. But at the core of it is like, we have a lot of interesting folks throughout the years. Anyone from Virgil Abloh to Holly Herdin is participating in conversation. I think the idea that you could more accurately find these folks, engage with them, and figure out things to collaborate on has always been compelling. It's quite tricky with the kind of limited service area you have inside of Discord and building Discord bots. But beyond that, I think reputation on chain is important and people are thinking a lot about that. And so we have an opportunity to kind of create a membership directory that says, hey, here are the things that I've expressed that I'm great at, and here are things that I participated in.
00:40:06.014 - 00:40:34.520, Speaker A: Here are things that my on chain activity says I have domain expertise in. And then allow folks to connect dots and try to do cool stuff together. I think that's actually one of the cool things. One of the cool things to me is stuff like Sound XYZ, the music NFT platform largely born out of FWB, people hanging out and meeting in there and saying, hey, we should build stuff. And so it'd be amazing if we could facilitate more of those interactions and create more teams and partnerships to go build cool stuff.
00:40:35.930 - 00:40:51.270, Speaker B: Yeah. Something that I thought was so cool is that the identity badges are non transferable NFTs and they'll just dynamically evolved based on the activity. Is that like an automated thing or must be automated if it's based on your activity?
00:40:51.430 - 00:41:09.700, Speaker A: Yeah, and I imagine part of it will be automated. Maybe some mail slip as well. Candidly Bodge and Dex have been kind of chipping away at that, and I haven't been nearly as involved as I should be in that product stuff, but I can do a little follow up with you and send you some notes. I imagine a lot of it will be automatic if it's done on chain, and there's probably pretty simple ways to structure those.
00:41:10.630 - 00:41:59.170, Speaker B: I just I think it was really you know, we've been talking about kind of like issues of exclusivity inclusivity. And obviously recently in the news there were tweets by one of your co founders, Cooper Turley. These were nine year old tweets, and so he was probably about 16 at the time he made the tweets, but they did express racist and homophobic sentiments, and FWB ended up announcing that it was removing him for a minimum of two seasons. I did notice there were a lot of critical comments on the Twitter announcement calling the thread sanctimonious, criticizing FWB for punishing him for actions from almost ten years ago, or saying things like these punishments amounted to cancel culture. What's your response?
00:42:00.630 - 00:43:00.702, Speaker A: I never want to speak on behalf of FWB, but I think what I was really proud of is that FWB had plans in place for any of these kind of things. The code of conduct that was built by members that were participated in the community made a decision, and that was that. Now, as far as me personally, I can't really speak to how the comments will be interpreted as being homophobic, but as far as the racist stuff, people the things people were really upset with were him using the, you know, saying nigga in tweets. And as a black person, I know Cooper extremely well. I've known him for years, and there's not a racist bone in his body. Did a stupid white kid say n words because he likes listening to rap music? In my opinion, absolutely yes. And I think what I wanted to see happen was someone who made some big mistakes, pay their debts and then get reintegrated into a community they can contribute to to make it better for a lot of those marginalized groups.
00:43:00.702 - 00:43:42.850, Speaker A: And I think that's why any of us or a lot of us do this stuff, is we see an opportunity to help people that could use that help. And Cooper, while he can write some silly, know people, said all these kind of fortune cookie tweets where he's talking about how dows are going to change the world and maybe hyperbolic. He's a young person who I think really believes a lot of those things. And so what I'd love to see is Cooper pay his debts, get back and get involved and contribute and help people. And I think that's the path that he's on. And I'm proud of FWB for setting the tone and creating a playbook that hopefully others can use and improve to make sure that we all feel safe and that we all feel heard and that we all want to participate inside of this thing that we're all co creating.
00:43:43.430 - 00:43:54.840, Speaker B: Yeah, and the homophobic part came from, I think, a CoinDesk article, but they didn't actually show those tweets, so maybe that was misinformation or something.
00:43:55.930 - 00:44:09.914, Speaker A: It was correct. He was using an F word, a slur that I didn't want to speak on it because I'm not queer. I don't persuade that community, and I don't want to interpret how it would have been felt by others who are. But as far as the racism stuff goes, I can speak to that.
00:44:10.112 - 00:44:53.100, Speaker B: Okay, so kind of on the same note, I did see that back when you were with Bread doing Lil Michaela, New York magazine reported that Bread only accepted venture capital from firms with a woman or person of color in a position to write them a check. The magazine also said that you and your then co founder, Sarah Deku said that you hoped that the impact you would have was similar to the impact of well, yeah, you mentioned this earlier, will and Grace. And I obviously am very well aware, as a woman myself and as a woman of color, that the Crypto and NFT space have been criticized as not being very diverse. So what do you think can and should be done about that?
00:44:54.990 - 00:45:45.990, Speaker A: To me, the best thing that can be done is onboarding and kind of handholding as many people as you possibly can into the space. I think the demographics are such that if you go out and you bring in the best people, the most talented people you can find, you're going to be identifying people of color and women because they're really freaking talented. And so one of the things that I think people talk about is how difficult user interfaces are for a lot of these things. And I think that can be kind of paternalistic in that the idea that people can't pick these things up if they're kind of shown how to do it, to me is incorrect. And I think it actually facilitates really nice each one teach one dynamic. And so what I often do is just sit down with people and show them how to get onboard into web3. Here's how to install MetaMask, here's how to install Phantom, here's how to figure out what this crazy flow blockchain is, what we're building, how to buy a top shot.
00:45:45.990 - 00:46:10.050, Speaker A: And I do a lot of that stuff. I think that's the kind of tactical, on the ground stuff. But beyond that, I think some of the stuff that we've done at Dapper and FWB by creating products that are maybe more compelling to folks outside of traditional finance or technology, whether it's buying NBA highlights or coming to parties, is a great way to pull people into this pipeline and get them involved.
00:46:10.550 - 00:46:24.840, Speaker B: Yeah, that's true, because it's just more integrated into kind of their normal activity, whereas I feel like some of the more financial stuff, it just feels a little bit overwhelming for kind of an average person.
00:46:25.210 - 00:46:26.790, Speaker A: Certainly it can be intimidating.
00:46:27.290 - 00:46:57.700, Speaker B: So you have such an interesting background. I mean, we only glossed over that at the beginning, but because you have so much experience in the music space and with friends of yours who kind of started out as just an everyday person, who then became household names as musicians, I wanted to ask you what your thoughts were about this passion economy or creator economy. And before we actually get into this question, can you define those terms as you see them?
00:46:58.070 - 00:47:49.410, Speaker A: Oh, man. So I think largely attributed to Legion, who's defined this kind of like, passion and creator economy. And as I understand it, when it was originally defined, it really was designed to represent creators who were now trying to build businesses around their output in ways that the kind of more mainstream platforms wouldn't have enabled. Instagrams TikToks YouTubes of the world. I'll just focus stuff like Patreon, only fans substack, and I kind of see them as like Web 2.5, as like these interstitials where it was clear that consumers and fans wanted to buy things directly from creators that they liked and there weren't very effective tools for doing so. I think what we've seen with Web Three is the evolution of that, where it's like, yeah, I want to buy something from this creator that I love, but I also want to have ownership of that object.
00:47:49.410 - 00:48:07.480, Speaker A: I like to be able to have a say in what this person is doing. And I think that's what people are expanding on now, and it's become such a compelling experience that you've seen communities, whether it's board apes or FWB or whale sharks, whatever it is, really pay attention and then you'll move quite quickly.
00:48:08.670 - 00:48:23.840, Speaker B: And so what problems do you think that this technology will solve for creators? And kind of what are some of the more creative things that you expect to see them do that wasn't possible with Web Two or even 2.5?
00:48:24.370 - 00:49:54.278, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I would say the really exciting things I'm pumped on are like, creators being able to buy a home or start a family, things that should not be crazy, just get back to square one, be able to make a living. It's a sad reality that a lot of our favorite creators are really skating by and are really on this treadmill where they have to crank out enough output to stay top of mind so they can capture attention and platforms can still add to get that attention and they can get a small cut. What I'm looking forward to is people creating interesting economies. I often joke that when I was first playing in bands, like hardcore bands, we had to decide between a drummer who was 16 and not very good at playing the drums and a drummer who was 14 and really good at playing the drums. But none of us could drive and the 16 year old could drive and so we had to make a decision and there were trade offs and we brought him into the band and we were able to play other places. I often think that creators down the road are going to see someone like Blau, someone who has a traditional finance background, who can think really uniquely about the economies he can build around his own DJ, his music and think, man. As part of our band, as part of our team, maybe we need public relations, but maybe more importantly, we need, like, a community manager with tokenomics chops who can help us think about how we can take our output and build economies against it, such that we can not only survive, but thrive.
00:49:54.278 - 00:50:06.720, Speaker A: And so I think you're going to see the makeup of creative organizations and bands and creators change as people recognize that there's a lot of value to be captured here if they have the tools and the know how to realize it.
00:50:07.090 - 00:50:18.658, Speaker B: And what are some of the things that you feel that technology could do someday for creators that are not yet possible that you hope would be developed? I guess in the next year or two?
00:50:18.824 - 00:51:41.894, Speaker A: Yeah, I think in the next year or two you're definitely going to see narratives that are not only precipitatory but potentially shaped by fandoms. So you could imagine a world where a Spider Man comic is being unveiled panel by panel and in a choose your own adventure style way, a governance token is deciding the outcome of this narrative. I also think allowing communities to participate inside of your media is something I'm pretty excited about. So oftentimes there are YouTubers that are finding editors and I think there's ways to engage community to participate in the edit of what they're doing and as that asset performs well, having them participate in sharing some of that value and upside and then the really simple stuff. I think there's opportunities for NFTs to create markets for creative works that otherwise might not have had markets. So my friend David Rudnick talks a lot about poetry and I couldn't agree know, I think we live in a world where the value that poets create is really not reflected in their quality of life or the way they live. And so I think the idea that I could participate in kind of collecting poet poetry or different written text and I could potentially speculate the time arising that's 30 to 100 years versus the really kind of short windows.
00:51:41.894 - 00:52:17.160, Speaker A: We have now in an attention economy where we don't know if vine will be here tomorrow or Flickr will be here tomorrow, I think really changes the game. And so the major themes for me are creating economies around markets and markets for things that otherwise wouldn't have had them like poetry or contemporary dance choreography or whatever you'd like. And then the flip side of that is allowing capital to think with longer time horizons because we have decentralized networks that are going to exist for far longer than Flickr or any of the other kind of like graveyards of digital media companies of the last 20 years.
00:52:18.430 - 00:52:42.238, Speaker B: For the poetry and you mentioned music and also the choreographed dance moves. What does that look like? Obviously the NFTs that have taken off so far really tend to be visual, either art or video. So what do NFTs look like when it's applied to something different like poetry or I mean, I think it's going.
00:52:42.244 - 00:53:41.774, Speaker A: To take a market maker to come out and signify that these things have value. But the poetry wanted to meet is pretty straight ahead. There are platforms like Zora that allow you to mint text and then collect and trade that text. If someone is able to create a work and have that work gain a ton of cultural significance and that work has some provenance on chain, I imagine people are going to want to collect that. And I think the kind of really obvious ways I imagine the kind of point of entry will be kind of mean neolologisms, whether it's stuff like we're all going to make it or you got rugged or things that feel more crypto native but then expanding out into whatever 2020 three's equivalent of Bling. Bling is right like these slang terms that capture and kind of rise from cultural zeitgeist into becoming mainstream. And if you can kind of collect that and own that, I imagine it would inspire others to come up with other phrases or ideas that could be collectible.
00:53:41.774 - 00:54:12.960, Speaker A: As far as contemporary dance, I mean, it's clear that dance trends on TikTok are really important if you're someone who's able to shape that, if you're someone who's working at a ballet who's doing really impressive works. I'd like to hope that in the near future, people recognize how important that stuff is and they want to put it inside of their wallet because it will become a status symbol of a different kind. And they can play status games that maybe have a more historical bent than an astronaut floating through space or whatever is trending now on.
00:54:15.090 - 00:54:32.100, Speaker B: You know, obviously you did work at Spotify, so what do you kind of see happening when you look at something like Sound XYZ, which you mentioned, like an NFT version of music gaining popularity against the current models for consuming music.
00:54:33.190 - 00:55:28.630, Speaker A: I love a lot of folks at Spotify and I love Dan and I think what I'm excited about in music, NFTs is just another outlet for creativity. I think you've seen certain artists really thrive, the kind of Billie Eilish's of the world who have made music that's kind of genreless that can live across playlists, that is built for kind of a certain type of listening experience. I think in TikTok you've seen the same. These mediums allow for certain artists to thrive. And what's great for me is while at Spotify we talk about how myself as an artist, I always knew that I had fans that would spend maybe one or two that spend $10,000 on a release and I'm sure plenty that would spend nothing on it. But by charging the same fee for all of them, there are probably some inefficiencies there, right? And so I think what you're seeing is more experimentation is going to allow for artists to find different ways to capture as much of the value they can in the work they're creating.
00:55:29.930 - 00:55:36.680, Speaker B: Out of all the different kind of NFTs at the moment, what are your favorites or which ones are you watching?
00:55:38.010 - 00:56:22.358, Speaker A: I'm a huge fan of the folks at catalog. I think they're doing really great stuff and they have a really great curatorial ear. As far as music NFTs go sound I'm very inspired by as well and I guess disclaimer investor in both primarily because we're all talking about how to solve this music pain point, especially in real time. There's a marketplace on the Solana form function I'm really pumped on. I kind of see it as like an etsy, a kind of more indie space for artists to create work that otherwise might feel out of place contextually in like an open sea or a swarm PFP projects or something like that. And beyond that, huge fans of the Coordinate team. I think thinking about different models for compensating people is a really fun design space.
00:56:22.358 - 00:56:51.790, Speaker A: We're all working in different ways. I don't know that getting a check every two weeks standardized is like the way it needs to look. So anyone who's thinking about that stuff, people who are saying, hey, here are norms that were created in the industrial era, I think we're doing things differently now. Maybe we could approach this piece differently as well. So it's really wide open and that's the joy and maybe kind of the pain of Web Three is just trying to keep up in all these novel ideas and trying to make sense of what's real and what's graphed.
00:56:53.090 - 00:57:10.374, Speaker B: So obviously after this last fall, seeing the Constitution, dow just kind of come up out of nowhere, catch on very quickly. I think a lot of people are expecting to see a lot more interesting and crazy initiatives out of Dows this coming year. What are your thoughts on where you think Dows could go?
00:57:10.412 - 00:58:18.922, Speaker A: This I think, you know, I'm intrigued heading into some midterm elections in the States, how people will think about using Dows to potentially shape public sentiment or have influence in the outcomes of political elections. I've been impressed watching Coin Center and seemingly unknown lobbyists in DC raise awareness about crypto and Web Three. And I think as folks recognize that there's a couple of trillion dollars that have flowed into this new influential group of young people primarily, they might want to kind of bend their will towards those folks. And so I think there's a lot. Of discontent and latent discontent in this country that could be mobilized by engaging with the Web Three community. And so that's one thing I'm excited about for Dows is governance, informing macro governance, especially around things like Climate that I'm quite passionate about. Beyond that, I do think the kind of not so novel ability to raise dollars quite quickly for causes, whether it be buying a constitution or other things, isn't going away anytime soon.
00:58:18.922 - 00:58:42.210, Speaker A: And so I think you'll see more attempts to raise dollars to do really novel things. I'm hoping it lends itself more towards open sourcing dialysis versus, I don't know, buying rare video games. But that's the kind of stuff that I'm really excited about for Dallas, is like governance, thinking about new future of work stuff. And then if you're going to pool a bunch of dollars, can you use them effectively to create real world impact?
00:58:44.870 - 00:59:00.646, Speaker B: Yeah, when you talk about the dialysis thing, I mean, I guess that would assume some kind of specialized knowledge or working with people who have that specialized knowledge. So is it just more like a fundraising effort to then connect to the right people or what would something like that look like?
00:59:00.748 - 01:00:02.198, Speaker A: I think that's one of the major challenges right when we get into kind of bio. These are all hypothetical, far outside my pay grade. I think we've joked about on Twitter, like buying the rights to medications and open sourcing them through Dows, but there are all kinds of challenges in that and bringing it to practice in real life. But I think pooling capital, it seems quite silly to folks in Crypto because ethereum flies around, mazars fly around for zombie JPEGs every day. But being able to pool that capital is often one of the most difficult parts of realizing any of these kind of more outlandish moonshot ideas. And so if you can kind of drum up support and you have these giant coordination mechanisms like Twitter or something with a layer of capital on top of them, you can do more than just show up and flash dance in a flash mob in the early 2000s. You actually can put that capital together and try to change something systemically.
01:00:02.198 - 01:00:39.240, Speaker A: And so that is directionally. What I'm thinking about it would be identifying talent, hiring them and realizing things. It could be as simple as saying, hey, there's a really rare illness and the medication costs $10,000 a pill and we could probably buy it $50 million, and maybe it only helps 100 people a year but changes their lives. So that's the kind of stuff that's far outside of my pay grade. But I think the ability to pool capital is meaningful and novel, and I think it doesn't feel quite that novel to us. We've been in Web Three for a long time, but for folks outside of it, it's a big deal.
01:00:40.730 - 01:00:50.460, Speaker B: And finally for social tokens, which I think are very relevant creators, what are you kind of looking forward to this coming year? Like, where do you think those are going?
01:00:51.550 - 01:01:48.666, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, there are seemingly lots of platforms and protocols that are taking on. I think a lot of folks always talk about, which is know, the stock market for rappers or whatever it is. There is some demand for speculating around talent or kind of allowing folks to participate in markets they understand probably better than like a Goldman Sachs executive. I do think that NFTs have an opportunity to kind of step on into the community, tokens the turf and maybe shape what that looks like as well. You kind of seen some of that with the PFP projects where if you hold an NFT, you can participate inside of discords and other kind of governance in a different way. And where I'm kind of most intrigued is seeing how people can extend some of these token benefits on chain versus kind of the easy stuff. IRL, I think it's great to say if you hold this token, you come backstage forever.
01:01:48.666 - 01:02:05.140, Speaker A: But I'd like to see people kind of extend and maybe challenge themselves such that like, hey, if I live in the right regulatory environment, can I allow you guys to participate in the creation of this tour and the upside of the ticket sales? But that's all pipe dreaming stuff. We'll see if that comes to pass.
01:02:06.150 - 01:02:11.960, Speaker B: All right, well, this has been such a fascinating conversation. Where can people learn more about you and your work?
01:02:12.410 - 01:02:32.540, Speaker A: Oh, man, I'm generally just kind of like trolling and shit posting on the Internet, but if you want to participate in some of that, it's WH A-T-D-O-T-C-D what CD on most of them. And then, yeah, if you want to email me, you can just do Trevor Mcfedries@dapperlabs.com.
