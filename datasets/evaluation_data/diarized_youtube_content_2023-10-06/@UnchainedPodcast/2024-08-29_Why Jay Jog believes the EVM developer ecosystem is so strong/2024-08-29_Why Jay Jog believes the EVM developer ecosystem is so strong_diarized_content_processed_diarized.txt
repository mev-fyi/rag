00:00:00.160 - 00:00:39.788, Speaker A: If you look at kind of developers out there in crypto right now, around 80 to 90% of them are EVM developers. So a huge majority of devs right now are EVM devs. And if you actually ask them to go to a new execution environment and I mean we actually went through this with CosmosM last year, most of them are very strongly opposed to going from the EVM to a different execution environment. And it's not just like technical reasons. Part of it is technical. If you're writing code for a new execution environment then it's easier to introduce bugs if you don't understand how things work. And a bug in a smart contract can result in your entire project getting gray and your entire company essentially shutting down.
00:00:39.788 - 00:00:58.300, Speaker A: So it is scary from a technical side but even beyond that it's more for ideological reasons. The EVM is not just a tech stack, it is more fundamentally an ecosystem. And there's all the tooling the developer mind share everything else that is there around the EVM that really makes it sticky.
