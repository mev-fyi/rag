00:00:00.330 - 00:00:00.880, Speaker A: You.
00:00:02.290 - 00:00:50.538, Speaker B: Hi, it's it's me, Laura. At the end of 2021, we here at Unchained introduced a new show called The Chopping Block, where insiders chop it up about the latest in crypto. And this show features four crypto investors who are haseem Koreshi, managing partner at Dragonfly Capital, tom Schmidt, partner at Dragonfly robert Leschner, founder and CEO of Compound Labs and managing partner of Robot Ventures, and Tarun Chitra, cofounder of Gauntlet and managing partner at Robot Ventures. In each episode, Haseeb, Tom, Robert, and Tarun will discuss recent events in crypto. They will be live streaming their conversations every other Tuesday at 06:00 P.m. Eastern and 03:00 P.m. Pacific on the unchanged YouTube channel.
00:00:50.538 - 00:01:39.690, Speaker B: And we will then later release these conversations on the podcast. But the live stream is where you can participate in the chat, perhaps affect the conversation, and also catch all the visuals. So you've already had a chance to watch the first two or listen, and both of them are super fun and insightful conversations. I am now here to introduce this third episode and just generally explain to anyone who happens to be on the channel why I have these four people here discussing crypto events without me. But in the future, I will just leave them to dish about the latest in crypto on their own. So thanks to all of you for tuning in, and I hope that you enjoy listening to their discussion as part of your regular crypto news intake on Unchained. And now I will turn things over to Haseeb.
00:01:40.510 - 00:01:59.890, Speaker A: All right. Thanks, Laura. Okay, so hey, everybody, welcome back to the chopping block. Every couple weeks, the four of us get together and give an industry insiders perspective on the crypto topics of the day. So, quick intros. Tom is the DeFi maven and master of memes. Then we've got Robert, crypto connoisseur and captain of Compound.
00:01:59.890 - 00:02:24.938, Speaker A: Then we have Tarun, the gigabrain and grand Poohba at Gauntlet. And then we have myself, Haseeb, chief hype man at Dragonfly. The four of us are early stage investors in crypto, but I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice, legal advice, or even life advice. So, Robert, we failed a couple times in trying to get this show started, but you were telling us in the pre roll about your new NFT profile pick.
00:02:25.104 - 00:02:57.282, Speaker C: Let's kick it. So, last night, I got peer pressured into buying a new NFT by Kane of synthetics. It turns out that all the other DeFi founders were purchasing crypto coven NFTs and making them their Twitter avatars. And I love rotating. You know, it's something I do frequently. And so I left it the opportunity to buy the least attractive crypto coven witch I could find out of the entire collection the most demonic, least traditionally.
00:02:57.346 - 00:03:00.374, Speaker A: Appealing tom, can you throw it up on the screen?
00:03:00.572 - 00:03:07.350, Speaker D: Yeah. Let's take a peek at this. Bad girl, bad boy, bad girl, bad girl.
00:03:07.500 - 00:03:16.330, Speaker A: It's a coven. Yeah, I actually looked up. I didn't know what a coven was. I just sort of knew it was kind of a dark, evil thing. But apparently a covenant. Plural for witches. Yeah, exactly.
00:03:16.330 - 00:03:19.146, Speaker A: It's a plural of witch, which I did not know.
00:03:19.328 - 00:03:20.620, Speaker C: Yeah, there we go.
00:03:22.290 - 00:03:23.578, Speaker A: She's a butte.
00:03:23.754 - 00:04:01.180, Speaker C: But the thing that makes this interesting is this is not a hexagon. What I find interesting is that I am somebody who recently paid Twitter $3 to get Twitter blue so that I could hexagon my photos, but I actually have multiple Ethereum wallets, and you can only link one wallet easily to Twitter. So highly experimental feature. There's been a lot of people on Twitter complaining about the ability to link wallets. There's people, because they have to link it on their phone, who are taking a QR code and moving it to their desktop and importing it into their ledger. Live app. It's just a mess.
00:04:01.180 - 00:04:26.770, Speaker C: So multiple addresses. Some of the profiles I use have the hexagon. Some of them don't have the hexagon. Obviously, this feature created a lot of controversy this week. A lot of non crypto folks were really dunking on. It pretty strong. But I'm proud to rock hexagon NFTs as profile picks and brand new ones that don't yet have the hex.
00:04:27.190 - 00:04:45.254, Speaker D: I think we need to take a minute and just appreciate how crazy it is that Twitter actually added verified NFT profile pictures independent of the quality of the implementation, which I also have issues with. It's insane that this actually exists in this year.
00:04:45.372 - 00:05:04.990, Speaker C: It's awesome. I mean, the minute that Jack left and he's a bitcoin master as soon as he was gone, I mean, like, weeks later, they're rolling out Ethereum integrations with the most popular Ethereum wallet providers. So that should say a lot about the sort of internal direction of the organization and where they want to go.
00:05:05.140 - 00:05:09.838, Speaker A: I don't know if that's true. I mean, they teased this while he was still there, so it must have.
00:05:09.844 - 00:05:38.806, Speaker E: Been think about how long it would take to depose a public company CEO. You think that this is not a Guillotine French Revolution, like, throw them into the guillotine. This is like the board has to publish enough evidence, and they have to have 20 billion meetings, and then you have to go insult all your detractors on Twitter, who probably convince your board to fire you. Don't forget about the body politic involved here.
00:05:38.988 - 00:05:56.910, Speaker A: Understood? Yes. I think it's likely that this is happening for a while, but I don't think I mean, Jack remember, Jack bought the Twitter NFTs on what was that site that was doing? Jack bought something on send. I don't think he's a diehard. Like, screw the NFTs.
00:05:58.850 - 00:06:15.666, Speaker E: Have you read the description of the really shitty decks that Square put out? That thing is like a worse RFQ than zero x V one to 2017. It's actually, like, a horribly designed system. I can't believe Tom used to be.
00:06:15.688 - 00:06:16.680, Speaker A: At zero x.
00:06:19.770 - 00:06:32.730, Speaker E: Anyway, I'm saying worse than zero x v 10. That means they didn't even do any prior art. They didn't even read the zero x paper. They were just like, oh, we had to reinvent science. And actually we're back in the Stone Age. Forget about electricity.
00:06:33.230 - 00:06:39.274, Speaker C: Describe what Square's Dex does looks like and how it works.
00:06:39.472 - 00:07:41.550, Speaker E: Yeah, so it's a request for quote type decks. So basically, people who want to sell place orders and they place sort of like a thing that says, like, hey, I want to buy ten bitcoin and I want it to be filled within a certain amount of time. And then basically they have a sort of simple matching algorithm that happens off chain with trusted sort of like a Federated trusted network of people who handle the Fiat on ramp and then also do the matching. It's not a Dex in any sense of decentralized. BISC is more decentralized than this thing because it effectively requires KYC all of the people who are doing matching as well as all of the people doing Fiat on ramps. I thought it was a lot more hype and bluster than anything realistic. Like, the paper just reads like someone just ignored all of the advances in automated market making and on chain lending and derivatives that have taken place since 2017.
00:07:42.210 - 00:07:52.850, Speaker A: It felt a little bit like when Visa or Mastercard put out like white papers about crypto. The story is that, look, they did something and they felt it was worth publishing.
00:07:53.190 - 00:07:55.800, Speaker E: Can square do something. Is that the.
00:07:58.170 - 00:08:59.574, Speaker A: I mean, look, long story short, to Tom's point, it is certainly a big milestone for the industry that NFTs have been legitimized to this extent that now once Twitter integrates with OpenSea and by the way, it's also huge boon for OpenSea to be the place where it's not even that Twitter is going themselves, it links directly to OpenSea. So you look at someone's Twitter profile and it is basically an advertisement to go sort of buy now on OpenSea, which is to my mind, pretty incredible. So I think to Tom's point one, it's a real moment of legitimization for the industry that it's going to be hard to look back on all this and say like, oh, NFTs were just a flash in the pan. I think it's fairly clear that NFTs are not going away, even if sort of the V zero of PFPs end up becoming less popular over time. Which there was a thought. Actually, one of the interesting things that kind of bring into the big news of the week was the market drawdown. And there's going to be a lot to talk through about all the different elements of what happened.
00:08:59.574 - 00:09:52.730, Speaker A: But one of the interesting things coming in from NFTs is that NFTs actually did pretty well during the market drawdown, which was the most surprising thing because you would think, generally speaking, this market drawdown was incited largely by fears of the interest rates set by the Fed increasing faster than otherwise expected. And naturally, we talked about this last time, is that when interest rates go up, that generally means that demand for risk assets goes down because the opportunity costs safer assets are now they pay more because there's a higher interest rate on them. So you would think that, okay, NFTs are the farthest out the risk curve you could possibly be. They're the riskiest things in crypto and therefore they should have gotten totally hit. But instead what we saw was that NFTs held up really mean. Robert, you're probably the biggest NFT connoisseur of anybody on this show. What are your thoughts about why this happened?
00:09:52.880 - 00:10:20.546, Speaker C: Yeah, so they didn't necessarily go up in dollar terms, they went up in Ether and crypto terms. Right. They outperformed other crypto assets. And I think the psychology of this is actually really simple. When Ether got smoked, I mean, we watched it go from 4700 to 2200 in a relatively short amount of time. You didn't see NFT prices in Ether terms drop by that much. Right.
00:10:20.546 - 00:10:47.020, Speaker C: And suddenly there's a lot of people who are holding assets who said, wow, NFTs got a little bit cheaper in some cases in Ether terms, or a little bit more expensive, but they feel a lot cheaper. Right. All else equal, the price of an NFT just dropped by half. And so psychologically, the Ether you're holding, you may as well put it to work once it goes down in price. Right.
00:10:47.390 - 00:11:17.826, Speaker D: I think there's a component of that to it. But OpenSea is also posting all time high volumes this week, which is generally not true of the crypto market. Right. If Bitcoin falls in price by half, generally, you're going to see volumes could go down as well, just as a result of sort of the unit of account falling in value. Whereas NFTs, these things are going down in US dollar terms, but the exchange volumes are going up in US dollar terms. So it's a really weird dynamic. But I do generally agree with you that we're seeing every pricing in ETH terms, but not in dollar terms.
00:11:18.008 - 00:11:33.366, Speaker C: Yeah. In terms of OpenSeas volume, someone's going to have to double click on this. But I read an interesting thread online recently where someone was saying that a lot of the Dune queries that were being used to generate these reports became inaccurate.
00:11:33.398 - 00:11:35.900, Speaker E: As he someone, that was me.
00:11:39.070 - 00:11:40.942, Speaker C: Break it down for us. Break it down.
00:11:41.076 - 00:12:31.750, Speaker D: All right, here's the deal. So disclosure dragonfly recently invested in Gem, which is a NFT aggregator, NFT marketplace aggregator. So go to Gem, you'll see NFTs across every different NFT exchange that exists, including things like Nftx, and they help you bulk buy. So if you want to buy five cryptocoven, you can do it in one transaction and you actually save a bunch of gas, sweep the floor. And so I was digging through some of their data, trying to see who's using this thing, what are their volumes, blah, blah, blah. And I kept noticing weird discrepancies between the Gem volume that was seeing on Dune and the OpenSea volume that was on I believe Richard Chen has like, the main OpenSea Dune dashboard. And so I was diving into it and it turns out that the Openc dash that was initially made didn't really account for the idea of there being multiple fills per transaction.
00:12:31.750 - 00:12:59.474, Speaker D: So that's what's happening right now. Normally, right, you see an NFT on Openc, you buy that's one, fill that's one transaction, it's done. But with something like Gem, you can buy five or ten different NFTs in a single transaction. And normally, okay, maybe this creates some double counting. In this case, just because of the way the Dune query was written, it generated a squared number of transactions. So five buys would turn into 25 buys and ten buys would turn to 100 buys. And so I basically put in a small patch.
00:12:59.474 - 00:13:25.230, Speaker D: There's like a one line fix to the query, but it sort of caused the estimated Openc volume to fall by like 30 or 40%, depending on the day. So sort of a weird little quirk. You got to look in the data, you got to do your own research. But I don't know, I think it's a testament to the rise of these aggregators. They're doing, I don't know, four or 5% of Openc volume every day. And I expect that to keep going up as they just provide a really great experience for buying and selling NFTs.
00:13:26.210 - 00:14:43.560, Speaker C: Yeah, there was a really good thought piece as well by I think it was Scott Lewis, who know the rise of more marketplaces from OpenSea to looks rare to whatever is going to necessitate the rise of aggregators. Right? The rise of aggregators is going to then enable the rise of more AMM liquidity pools for NFTs that wouldn't otherwise get any flow, right? Because no one's going to go to, let's say, nftx or whatever directly. But if you have aggregators that become more popular in the primary use cases as how you interact and purchase NFTs, you'll be able to more easily interact with small niche or passive pools of liquidity as well. So I think in terms of the evolution of this, there's a lot of design space for NFT AMMS and either niche or strategy specific like ways to create NFT liquidity that will start getting a lot of volume when they might not have any retail go to a know, click a button, direct flow. So I'm excited to see where this leads. I think aggregator is going to change NFT markets radically, and I think it's starting to it makes them more fun. I mean, just sweeping the floor with one click makes NFTs more like ERC, 20s in a lot of ways.
00:14:44.170 - 00:15:34.280, Speaker A: It used to be incredibly difficult to do these floor sweeps, right? There was a lot of fancy, kind of smart contract level stuff that you had to do in order to effectively complete a floor sweep in a single transaction. And now that stuff is all getting commoditized, like anybody can now do a floor sweep. So it is a market transformation that I think we're starting to see the very beginning of. It feels to me like one of the things that we were expecting for a very long time. So another disclosure, we're investors into 1inchh. 1inchh is the leading DFI aggregator of trading, ERC, 20 tokens. And for a long time we thought that DFI and for the trading of normal tokens, especially at spot markets, that almost certainly it's going to transition to becoming majority driven by aggregators as opposed to people going directly to the most popular front end, like something like uniswap and interestingly, that hasn't really happened.
00:15:34.280 - 00:16:08.980, Speaker A: The aggregator market share has been stuck for most of DFI, somewhere between like ten to 20% market share. And it kind of floats around depending on what's going on in a given day. And our belief is that probably that will trend upwards over time as the market gets more sophisticated. But right now it doesn't really seem like that's happening. And the question is, for NFTs, do we expect that to change? Certainly it's been the case that OpenSea has just run away with it. They've just been so completely dominant in NFT volumes. And the two sided marketplace nature of OpenSea makes that work really well.
00:16:08.980 - 00:16:24.150, Speaker A: But do you guys think that the market structure of NFTs is going to evolve such that it's going to be a winner take all where there's one OpenSea and nobody else can really stand up to them, or that there are going to be other challengers to Opensea's dominance?
00:16:24.890 - 00:17:29.926, Speaker D: I think every founder working on an NFT marketplace needs to read the Cold Start Problem by Andrew Chen from Think. I see a lot of founders who are building new NFT marketplaces thinking they'll win on tech. And really that's not how you break through a liquidity mode, right? Like a two sided marketplace mode. Do you need to get really aggressive going after one vertical and starting the liquidity there early? If you look at where do you actually see volumes that aren't on OpenSea? Maybe outside of some of these AMM platforms, it's exchanges that are vertically integrated, right? Like the punks marketplace or like Katana on Ronin for like Axie, things like that, where it's sort of specially designed for these assets and they sort of go after these assets alone. I think that's where you could kind of start to see liquidity fragmentation. But I think for the most part, teams are trying to compete on having a nicer UI, but if there's nothing to buy, it's not really compelling enough to sort of overcome that activation energy to sort of break out the moat. Maybe this is actually a good segue to talk about looks rare.
00:17:29.926 - 00:17:33.438, Speaker D: I don't know if you guys have been looking at them this week.
00:17:33.604 - 00:17:40.398, Speaker A: Yeah. So maybe I can briefly summarize the Looksrare story. Actually, Tom, maybe you should, given how close you've been to it.
00:17:40.564 - 00:18:37.182, Speaker D: Sure. So Looksrare is a I think now that Openc has recently raised at around at $13 billion, it has a huge bullseye in its back and all these founders are looking for ways to go after this sort of giant. And one of the more popular things we've seen recently is idea of vampire attacking Openc or basically making a competitor and trying to suck up all of its liquidity and then eventually sort of overtake it. And Looksrare is sort of the latest and arguably most successful in this category, where they're starting out giving a big AirDrop to everybody who's traded on OpenSea with their own proprietary token and trying to get people excited and build a long tail token distribution. And then what Looksrare has implemented is basically trade mining. So they're compensating people with fees for trading on Looksrare with the idea of basically generating enough volume over time to slowly sort of wean off of OpenSea and sort of wean down on their rewards. And I think for the most part they've been successful in generating volume.
00:18:37.182 - 00:19:05.900, Speaker D: If you look at Day over day, they're doing several times more volume per day than OpenSea, which is pretty impressive on the face of it. I think the maybe flip side of this, if you look at it, is that a lot of people are accusing them of wash trading or basically people washing on looksrare to get their rewards. Because the rewards are basically much higher than the fees that you pay to actually trade, which is kind of the peril that you need to avoid when you're designing, like a trade mining program.
00:19:06.830 - 00:19:53.322, Speaker A: Very briefly, for those who are not aware, wash trading is basically when you essentially trade with yourself to give the impression of trading in order to get some kind of auxiliary benefit. Right. So wash rating is generally illegal in normal regulated exchanges because you are sort of pumping up volumes with illegitimate trading activity. In the case of something like Looksrare, the reason why people might be washrading is because by trading on Looksrare, you can earn some of the Looksrare token. And so it turns out that the Looksrare token is priced such that if you just list an NFT yourself and you trade with yourself to buy the NFT, even if you pay the 2% fee or what is it, two and a half percent? 2%, something like that. I think 2%, yeah, less. Exactly.
00:19:53.322 - 00:20:36.370, Speaker A: Once you pay the 2% fee, you actually come out ahead with the Looksrar AirDrop and so that's why you're seeing so much incentive for there to be all this wash rating. And so to be clear, the accusation is not that the Looksra team is wash rating, but that random people who are trying to make money off of the looksra. Token are wash rating. And one of the strongest indications of this wash rating that, Tom, you were pointing out to me earlier is that the collections that are seeing the most volume of trading on looksra are not the same collections that are being traded on OpenSea. So if you expected it to be organic volume, what you would see is that people are trading on looksrare, the kinds of things are trading on other platforms. Right. It's the same kind of popular things, but instead what they're doing is they're only trading collections that have 0% creator fees.
00:20:36.370 - 00:20:40.054, Speaker A: So a creator fee, what is it called? The creator tax or what's the name for royalty?
00:20:40.102 - 00:20:41.094, Speaker E: Yeah, royalty.
00:20:41.142 - 00:20:45.100, Speaker A: Royalty. Royalty. Creator royalty. I guess the term is important.
00:20:45.950 - 00:20:50.118, Speaker E: You'll definitely get offended if you say creator fee and not royalty.
00:20:50.294 - 00:21:30.026, Speaker A: Please excuse me. So, the creator royalty, basically, the idea is that if you transfer or you affect a sale of an NFT, the original creator of that NFT will get a percent of every single transfer that happens. Hence, and this, famously, we talked about last week, what happened with pudgy penguins when they were wrapped to avoid this creator royalty. So what's happening is that the only collections getting traded in volume on looksrare are these that don't have a greater royalty, which is a dead sign that, okay, the reason why they're trading these things that don't have a creator royalty is because they don't actually care about trading the collections. They're just trying to mine the AirDrop. So, what are you looking at, Tom?
00:21:30.208 - 00:22:10.190, Speaker D: I was just showing off sort of exactly what you're talking about looking at looks rare versus openc volume segmented by royalty versus royalty free volume. And it's just like night and day. Like, looks rare is like 99% royalty free, and openc is like 1% royalty free. I actually heard a crazy story recently, which is loot as a switch that could be flipped to basically add a royalty to loot trades. And it's historically been traded turned off. But I think the loot community got kind of pissed about people watch trading loot on looks rare that they basically very sneakily flipped it on before people could notice. And they earned like 500 e in fees into the looks into the loot treasury.
00:22:10.190 - 00:22:19.538, Speaker D: So, yeah, now they have, like a few mil in east in the loot treasury to spend on whatever they want to spend on. So you got to be careful when you're wash. Trading is maybe the lesson.
00:22:19.634 - 00:22:37.914, Speaker A: How dastardly? How dastardly? Yeah. Well, it turns out this is the chopping block, the number one place for wash traders to get their tips on which assets to choose. Yeah, lookser, I think, is probably not the primary example of how to take on the open sea monopoly right now, although it's getting a lot of attention.
00:22:38.042 - 00:22:39.040, Speaker C: Time will tell.
00:22:39.730 - 00:22:40.720, Speaker A: That's true.
00:22:41.170 - 00:23:38.334, Speaker E: I feel like it's not even clear that their Monopoly status can be. We can't really say that until the Coinbase thing launches, right? Because I feel like the like, if that if Coinbase is unsuccessful with launching their NFT platform, then I think it's like Crown, OpenSea, Monopoly. But I feel like we have this kind of looming big event that we haven't really figured out how to factor in. And it does seem like Coinbase is trying to get a lot more celebrity involvement and sort of more mass market appeal, I think, than a lot of what's on OpenSea. And so we'll see if that has an NBA TOPSHOTS like effect or not. I do think one thing that's interesting is towards the aggregator market is one of the benefits of being non fungible, right, is like you buy portfolios of things, right? So it's like a real estate investment trust. I bought a portfolio of houses.
00:23:38.334 - 00:24:51.058, Speaker E: In this case, it's like I bought this portfolio of NFTs. The problem is most pricing mechanisms are hard to have a lot of liquidity in if you have too many different types of bundles, right? Like, oh, I want arbitrary subset of board apes. I want all the apes with this quality, but not this quality and this quality. And as you add more of those, you kind of blow up the state space in a way that makes it much harder to source liquidity for every single bundle. But I think the interesting thing that's to the point, to Robert's point with the aggregators is sweeping the floor is sort of like a bundle that's random to some extent, right? It's a bundle of subsets of the NFTs that's like somewhat random, somewhat signal, and somehow the market has cohered on that bundle as being worth buying one unit of, roughly. And so I think the NFT markets will probably standardize to some extent a little bit like the way the real estate market or commodities markets do, where there's just certain types of bundles that get bought as like a unit, like a floor price type of thing. If you think about oil, there's like three different types of oil futures.
00:24:51.058 - 00:25:07.360, Speaker E: You can trade one that's like the really shitty oil, one that's like the medium grade, and one that's a high grade. But what does it mean to be the shitty grade? There could be some good batches in the shitty grade ones, just they all came from the same place. And I kind of think we're going to see a lot more market structure in NFTs that looks like commodities and real.
00:25:10.450 - 00:25:19.218, Speaker A: Mean Nftx was doing exactly this. And I think they were a little early, designed very well, they were early.
00:25:19.304 - 00:25:40.060, Speaker E: And I think this idea of the floor being the right portfolio was just not really totally known at that time. Everyone was just like, oh, you want an equally balanced portfolio of punks. But when you have punks, the max over min price ratio being like 100 or something, it's like, not really right.
00:25:42.190 - 00:25:56.298, Speaker A: Yeah, that's definitely true. That's definitely true. They got a lot of things wrong. But I do recall Nftx having like, tiered rarity indexes for some of the different NFT collections, but I do think.
00:25:56.304 - 00:26:15.018, Speaker E: They were like, it's hard to figure out what bundle people want, right. OpenSea memed the floor into a bundle. And that was actually the sticking point in my mind for them and why everyone is instead trying to copy by these vampire attacks that incentivize floor trading on aggregators.
00:26:15.214 - 00:26:41.520, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree with you that the one potential savior here is Coinbase's NFT marketplace. But I worry that we've just seen such bad execution so far from everybody, like all the traditional companies trying to get into NFT marketplaces. I mean, I was, I was worried for a while about the FTX's NFT marketplace, and I haven't heard a peep about it since it went live.
00:26:42.050 - 00:26:51.950, Speaker E: The news flash, if you're trying to make Solana NFTs thus hallmark of your NFT platform, spam issues will make it very hard to be usable.
00:26:53.330 - 00:27:33.758, Speaker A: Yes, indeed. Okay, that takes us back. So let's rewind a bit, move away from the NFT conversation, and go back to the carnage that we saw this week, because it brings us actually quite nicely into some of the stuff that you were talking about. So, a lot of stuff during the market downturn, we saw a lot of stuff break. We actually saw MakerDAO, which is the largest lending protocol on Ethereum by TVL. We saw MakerDAO get very dangerously close to basically having a massive liquidation that would have totally caused the entire market to buckle. I think it was something like $600 million of Ether that was extremely close to getting auctioned off.
00:27:33.758 - 00:27:46.340, Speaker A: We saw, ohm, Olympus Dow, which we've discussed a few times before on the podcast. We saw Olympus Dow draw down to something like $60, up from a high of near, what, 1000, something like that.
00:27:49.430 - 00:27:59.542, Speaker D: The market cap. And so the market cap is down from 4 billion to 600 mil right now. So, yeah, quite a drawdown for ohm, yeah.
00:27:59.676 - 00:28:24.640, Speaker A: And so basically what you've seen is that every instance of on chain leverage, which Olympusdao is a good example of sort of implicit on chain leverage, but then of know MakerDAO and many other lending protocols on chain are the same thing. We saw lots and lots of both massive drawdowns and some near death experiences in other parts of the market. What were some of the things that you guys were paying attention to during the market drawdown that you thought were interesting?
00:28:25.890 - 00:29:30.174, Speaker C: Well, Makerdow was fascinating, mostly because you had to see Rune, the founder of MakerDAO, get on Twitter and start saying we have to contact one specific borrower. That was absurd. Solend had major issues on Solana. Solana had uptime issues during a disastrous market environment, which, if your blockchain is not live, DFI doesn't work right, and that's fine if you're a Dex. Okay, you can't trade boohoo, like, wait 12 hours and trade. But if it's a protocol that relies on risk and collateralization and leverage and borrowing, if your blockchain is not up, bad things happen, right? If you can't be liquidated where liquidations aren't orderly or the price feeds are off or delayed or whatever, you're going to get events that ruin traders and users. So we're in our infancy of seeing the interactions of DeFi on unstable platforms.
00:29:30.174 - 00:30:08.794, Speaker C: It could have been a lot worse. It's not a plug, but a couple of years in protocol like, Compound was like the most boring and uneventful participant. It had like $15 billion of liquidity and you wouldn't have even noticed anything during the market sell off massive liquidations. But everything was just like completely humming, right. I think the areas of the market that are newer are going to see the most craziness. It was a little surprising to see Maker sort of running around, but the system at Maker performed correctly. It was just the size of a position that was at risk.
00:30:08.794 - 00:30:41.050, Speaker C: So I think we'll continue to see people talking about DeFi. Like, is it working during massive market sell offs in the newer corners of the market? Next time, it might know. Is DeFi on avalanche working? Now that it's large enough, there's the risk of it not working. So that's what impressed me was that in general, the Ethereum ecosystem performed pretty well, albeit one massive, massive borrower at risk in Makerdow. But aside from that, it was uneventful.
00:30:42.110 - 00:31:25.046, Speaker D: Yeah, I think in some respects this kind of reminds me of March 2020 for Ethereum, when it's like the Maker Oracle broke and then Maker had to issue a bunch of more MKR. And so that was sort of like a little bit of a growing up moment for Ethereum DeFi. And I think maybe this is sort of the equivalent for Solana DeFi. I think in Solan's case, again, disclosure, we're an investor. It wasn't like their fault. It was like the Pit Oracle, which everybody in Solana uses couldn't get through because there's so much transaction spam. And so it's like thinking through, how do you make both the blockchain more robust but also adding more backup mechanisms in the past? Because I think luckily, in this case, it wasn't too bad.
00:31:25.046 - 00:31:47.230, Speaker D: I think they refunded people who got liquidated because of the Oracle, but in the future, it might not be so lucky. Maybe it's going to be even too large to sort of fix, as we saw with Ethereum this time around. If this Maker liquidation happened, that's 600 mil in sell pressure on the market. I don't know if there's actually enough to sort of mend that back up if some of that is liquidated incorrectly.
00:31:48.610 - 00:32:32.110, Speaker E: I do want to correct you guys a little bit on the 600 million dollar liquidation. I actually almost feel like Rune overhyped it because we spend a lot of time monitoring liquidity on different markets and how much slippage you can actually tolerate when there are liquidations in this world. And it was roughly about $60 million every 30 minutes. That was like the max that the auction was actually doing. So it would actually auction off over 6 hours. And at that sort of time, there was roughly, like, close to a billion dollars of open liquidity for ETH. So doing 60 million every 30 minutes was not so it's not so crazy.
00:32:32.110 - 00:32:55.330, Speaker E: It actually would have been fine. I think. Rune, maybe, in order to wake up, mr. Seven siblings decided to overhype it as $600 million in 3 seconds. But if anyone has ever bothered reading the maker auction documents or read the code, it can't do that. So I just want to point out that everyone very good factor. You didn't check the chain.
00:32:55.330 - 00:32:58.580, Speaker E: It's true.
00:32:59.270 - 00:33:22.694, Speaker A: It's interesting. So I agree with what's been said. I did not know that about the maker auction. So I'm glad that we got the reality check there. On the Salana side, I thought it's a very good point. Look, Ethereum has been through this. Every major protocol in Ethereum went through March 2020, which was much more violent and much more sudden than what happened this week or earlier over the weekend.
00:33:22.694 - 00:33:56.530, Speaker A: I think for Salana, what it showed us is that, look, Salana is not done. It's not a finished protocol. And one of the most obvious failures of Solana that contributed to so much of the turmoil that happened over the weekend was that Solana doesn't have a fee market. And if you don't have a fee market, this shit is just going to keep happening. So for those who are not aware right now on Solana, solana does not have a gas model. There is no metering that happens the way that it happens on Ethereum of, oh, if you do this much transaction, then you have to pay this much gas. Solana has a fixed fee for every single transaction.
00:33:56.530 - 00:34:21.402, Speaker A: And if you are consuming a lot of gas or a little bit of gas, it doesn't matter. You pay the same fee even if you want to pay more. You're like, hey, my vault is about to get liquidated, and the entire market is going to get screwed if I don't top up this vault. Let's say you were the maker guy who was just like, look, everyone is yelling on Twitter for me to top back up. Everyone wants me to top back up, or I'm pissed. And I'm like, Everyone wants me to submit this Oracle update. I'm willing to pay $100 to get this thing on chain.
00:34:21.402 - 00:34:54.906, Speaker A: But you can't because it just so happens that there is no way to tell the blockchain that, hey, my transaction is really important compared to everybody who's like, trying to snipe cheap NFTs because the NFT markets are not getting repriced. And so as a result, people are spamming. The transactions that are getting through are not the most important transactions. That's why fee markets are so important. Basically, when you don't have a market, what you get is you get breadlines. You get people sitting and waiting because there's no marketplace. So people who have the most willingness to pay cannot actually get their transactions done.
00:34:54.906 - 00:35:24.546, Speaker A: That is why Solana failed. Solana did not fail because it's not fast enough or it's not whatever. It failed because it doesn't have a fee market. And that's what caused this over congestion of spam transactions, because the spam transactions don't cost anything more than they normally cost during an outage. So all the people who are running Solana bots trying to snipe AMMS are still running those bots while everyone else is running for their dear life. And that's just a sign that, look, your blockchain isn't finished. So we had a ton of news here.
00:35:24.546 - 00:35:26.158, Speaker A: Oh, sorry. Go ahead. Go ahead. Tarun.
00:35:26.334 - 00:36:13.630, Speaker E: Yeah, I just wanted to add one thing to this, which is know, the interesting thing is that in a lot of ways, the no fee market, they do have a sort of fee market, but it's not like a mempool, right? There's not actual congestion at that level. You do still have to pay a transaction fee. And it does float somewhat. It's not perfectly constant, but it's kept artificially low, so you might as well treat it as a really low constant fee. And the interesting thing is, A, it looks like normal finance, right? This is exactly when I worked in HFT. This is like what happens on the days everything goes down, which is like five routers at the CME are down. Oh, except for like three people who found this one extra route through the data center, and they're over everyone because they're causing everyone to take a huge liquidation.
00:36:13.630 - 00:37:01.570, Speaker E: This actually looks very similar to traditional I mean, maybe not totally surprising, but this actually really does look like what the CME looks like. This looks like what Urex looks like. This looks like traditional trading, less like crypto trading. And the other thing that's interesting to note, I think, about the DeFi protocols on Solana is that a lot of the people who've built them, I don't think a lot of them are coming from high frequency trading. A lot of them are coming from sort of like fang manga, whatever it's called now places. I think they didn't spend time understanding why Ethereum DeFi kind of evolved the way it did. They didn't maybe do the anthropological and historical survey of why did this uniswap thing come in? They just kind of were like, oh yeah, we're going to make something better.
00:37:01.570 - 00:38:06.258, Speaker E: That looks like what our systems look like in our old jobs. And in the process, what happened is people made a lot of DeFi protocols that have a ton of transactions needed to do a single action, right? So in Ethereum, one of the reasons uniswap really beat out everything else at that time in late 2018, early 2019 partially was it only took one transaction to do an arbitrary sized trade, right? In an order book, you can't do that. You may have to send like tens transactions to clear out the order book to make a huge trade that might be like a liquidation. And something like Pith, which is, I think, a really nice protocol. It's like a very clean protocol. Mathematically, it has infinitely more transaction volume generated on chain than a chainlink or a traditional kind of simple spot price oracle because it does this confidence interval calculation on chain. And so there's a sense in which a lot of the DeFi protocols on Solana were built with this idea that, hey, transactions are really cheap.
00:38:06.258 - 00:38:32.378, Speaker E: Who cares? Do as many transactions as you need, regardless of scenario. And that kind of ignores a lot of what people learned in ETH. DFI, right? Like the ether delta. A lot of the Pith failure does resemble a little bit like a lot of the Ether delta failures in January 2018. And so I think this is a learning lesson for that ecosystem in terms of hey, there's a reason that some of these inefficient things are done in ETH.
00:38:32.394 - 00:38:32.806, Speaker A: DFI.
00:38:32.858 - 00:38:39.918, Speaker E: It's not because the developers are dumb, necessarily, right? It is actually because there are these extreme cases.
00:38:39.934 - 00:38:41.170, Speaker C: Some of us are dumb.
00:38:42.470 - 00:39:02.098, Speaker E: I'm just saying there's a lot of hubris in that ecosystem sometimes of people like, oh yeah, these ETH people are all dumb. They made this kind of inefficient thing. And I think sometimes it does help to make sure you understand the history and anthropology of why those mechanisms evolved.
00:39:02.274 - 00:39:48.038, Speaker A: I think the Solana Ethos has done a lot to convince people that Salana is not even a blockchain, that it's basically just a computer and you can just run an ordinary program on it and expect perfect uptime. You can expect availability. You can expect the idea is that, well, everything's 400 millisecond or 500 millisecond blocks. So you don't even need to think about the kind of trade offs that someone on Ethereum would normally think about, about liveness and availability. And that leads to things like today or not today, but this weekend during the market drawdown. If you are building a financial system, the first rule, the first principal rule is that it's got to be robust in the times when it most matters, which is of high volatility. And everything in Ethereum is built with that in mind because everyone remembers March 2020 and Salana wasn't even around in March 2020.
00:39:48.038 - 00:40:08.720, Speaker A: This is kind of the first time that they've actually gotten punched in the gut of hey, when shit goes really haywire, you're just another blockchain and you behave exactly like one in that oh crap, market's going nuts and there's downtime and no one can get their transactions through. And suddenly the things that we thought were buttery smooth are exactly the things we are not working. And the things that we most need.
00:40:09.250 - 00:41:18.986, Speaker E: That being said, I do want to give them a lot of credit for actually, I think I was in the discord throughout the kind of their resolution of things and you got to give them a lot of credit for actually getting the hard fork through. Like in EOS times, the EOS developers never showed up and no one cared enough to actually go fix things and try to make these updates. And I don't think it's like, Malcolm, I want to give them a lot of credit for taking a really shitty situation and actually kind of pulling through. And I think they understand these problems, right? At the end of the day, they just wanted to build the fastest thing ever. And unfortunately, the fastest thing ever does look a little bit like Equinix NY Five, right? It doesn't really look like Geodistributed Blockchain as much and you're making this trade off, that's fine. But I do think there is a sense in which the developer community in Solana is actually extremely strong. And I certainly think it doesn't feel like the EOS days where anything bad would happen on EOS.
00:41:18.986 - 00:41:33.942, Speaker E: Everyone would just point fingers at each other and no one would push an upgrade and no one would fix their protocols. So I want to give a lot of to all the devs up 24 hours a night. Props, mad props.
00:41:34.006 - 00:42:32.366, Speaker A: Absolutely nothing but respect for the Salana Core team. What they've done in terms of building performance and building a great community has been amazing, right? And it's early days and it's very, very clear. Like, look, Ethereum has gone through so many faceplants in its history that, look, every blockchain is going to go through that, especially when you'rebuilding the stack piece by piece. So I think you make a great point, Tarune, and I don't want to belittle the work that any of these developers or entrepreneurs are doing in trying to build robust systems. So with that being said, my hope is that the Solana ecosystem is going to learn from this and realize that, look, you guys are a blockchain too, and the problems that every blockchain worries about, about sort of uptime and scalability and decentralization and blah, blah, blah, you got to worry about that shit too. Because no matter how high your TPS is and no matter where you sort of sit on that trade off spectrum, at the end of the day, when markets are going down 25% in a single day, every blockchain basically looks the same and they all suffer from the same problems.
00:42:32.548 - 00:42:47.214, Speaker E: Yeah, for sure. And I think that, like I said, there's some times in history in this industry where we've seen chains that was their disappearing event, effectively. And I don't feel that way. I really do. The community really came in here.
00:42:47.252 - 00:43:36.110, Speaker A: It's definitely not the case. I mean, we're still seeing there was a lot of press coverage around that time. There were some traders who were going and talking to all the press outlets like, oh, I can't believe that Solana is not being performant at the time when it most matters. And that felt a little it felt a little BS to me because everything is doing terribly right now. Why would Solana be any different? And all this stuff is obviously very new. And look, the Solana team has been relatively clear in saying, look, this is beta software, the blockchain is not done yet, so chill out, use it at your own peril. It does make very clear that, look, the Solana story people are now, I think, coming to appreciate that the Solana story is not quite as not quite as magical as was originally portrayed.
00:43:36.110 - 00:43:48.422, Speaker A: To try to get a system with this kind of performance is going to come with downsides and you're going to see some of that come up, especially when you build an entire stack from scratch and then try to put billions of dollars of TVL into it. Yeah.
00:43:48.476 - 00:43:54.898, Speaker E: One thing that is kind of interesting that I'm kind of hoping we see in the next crash when there's more bridges.
00:43:54.994 - 00:43:56.178, Speaker A: The next crash?
00:43:56.354 - 00:43:58.098, Speaker E: There's always you're the only one who's.
00:43:58.114 - 00:43:59.858, Speaker A: Looking forward to the next crash at this point, Tarun.
00:43:59.954 - 00:44:05.514, Speaker E: I'm just saying, there's always you can't assume there's not going to be one. There will be one in some finite time.
00:44:05.552 - 00:44:05.754, Speaker A: Right.
00:44:05.792 - 00:44:38.950, Speaker E: But I guess the interesting thing is, once we're in this more interconnected, interweb looking set of blockchains, there's way more volume in the bridges higher throughput. It'll be interesting to see if the networks that are less spam resistant somehow have all their flow sort of pushed off into the ones that are more spam resistant. And you have this sort of like, in very calm times, you can use these kind of Solana style things and then the moment things are bad, everything just crosses and goes to the higher fee networks.
00:44:39.290 - 00:44:44.834, Speaker A: I mean, wouldn't that happen with Bitcoin and Lightning or Bitcoin and DSV?
00:44:44.882 - 00:45:00.790, Speaker E: Maybe if you actually saw real usage there, sure. But the usage there is just exchanges dumping their coins or moving between wallets. Yeah, there's not many real Bitcoin users other than exchanges now and Custodians nowadays.
00:45:00.950 - 00:45:03.530, Speaker A: Tom. Robert, any thoughts on the Solana drama?
00:45:04.270 - 00:45:24.706, Speaker C: Well, it won't be the last time there's Solana Drama. Just like anytime there was Ethereum Drama, it wasn't the last time there was Ethereum Drama. I think there's going to be some growing pains for salana for Ethereum as it migrates to blockchains are fragile. Right.
00:45:24.888 - 00:45:27.090, Speaker A: No more these two. By the way, you're not allowed to say that.
00:45:27.240 - 00:45:29.934, Speaker E: Yeah, isn't it consensus layer or something now?
00:45:29.992 - 00:45:32.466, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. I don't know if you got the memo, Robert.
00:45:32.498 - 00:45:57.520, Speaker C: Don't make me change my ways. The magic of Bitcoin is that it's not fragile, right? But smart contract platforms are exponentially more complex and they are still fragile. Right? And so I think it'll be a decade before these systems really harden to the degree that we look at Bitcoin as so more drama ahead.
00:45:57.890 - 00:46:48.106, Speaker D: I think of it a little bit in traditional software, I feel like there's always this sort of tension between doing things sort of the native way and then people saying, oh, that it's really hard and complicated. Let's build an abstraction that allows any developer to come on. Right? This is like Electron or the Adobe thing. In the early mobile days, we're like, oh, we just write it in Flash script, and then you can deploy it on iOS and Android. And it turns out, actually, that's really hacky and inefficient and bad, and then after a certain point, you end up just rewriting it natively. And I feel like Solana is in a similar point where they're like, yeah, it's just like your normal HFP job. Just bring the same exact architecture people are discovering, hey, maybe this isn't super efficient, and then sort of finding ways to actually speak to the way the system's actually designed.
00:46:48.106 - 00:46:52.154, Speaker D: And so maybe that's kind of we're going through a similar path right now with crypto.
00:46:52.282 - 00:47:20.540, Speaker A: Fair enough. Well, I think the one thing we can all agree on is that it's still early days, and there's a lot more that we're going to learn about all of these platforms over the coming years. Solana hasn't been out for that long, and so, if anything, it's a testament to how amazingly that team has done to get as far as they have and to get the attention. And usually the history of technology tells you if there's one thing that people keep getting mad at, it's probably going to win at something important.
00:47:22.110 - 00:47:40.480, Speaker E: Can I add one last market comment? Cosmos ecosystem really killed it during all of the turmoil. Yeah, and also transaction rights. Osmosis had, like, almost ten x its ever volume it ever had and was, like, totally fine.
00:47:42.050 - 00:47:46.050, Speaker A: Is there a broader story beyond just like, nothing in Cosmos broke?
00:47:46.630 - 00:48:04.870, Speaker E: I mean, I also just think it's actually hard to short things in Cosmos other than there's a market structure issue there. But I do think the interesting thing is the validator set stood up. This was probably the biggest test, because Cosmos never really had that many apps that were using IBC.
00:48:05.450 - 00:48:12.042, Speaker A: Well, Luna got hit pretty hard, right? But Adam and some of the other things in the Cosmos ecosystem did well.
00:48:12.176 - 00:48:39.314, Speaker E: Yeah, Luna got hit that's more for economic reasons, for Luna. Not that the Luna validator set had issues processing things, but I think this is the first time we saw IBC cross chain bridges, really get 100 x the volume of their normal thing, and see if they can actually survive. I think that was actually we should give a shout out. I want to give a shout out to the Cosmos ecosystem for having a good time.
00:48:39.432 - 00:48:56.600, Speaker A: Well done. To Cosmos. And so as we close out this episode, obviously markets are still pretty choppy out there. In the spirit of not offering investment advice, not being investment advice, where do you guys think the market is going from here? We'll just go around real briefly in one sentence, Tom.
00:48:58.090 - 00:49:29.060, Speaker D: I am definitely not the person to be asking about mean, I suspect we are close to bottoming out. I think there's probably still more room to go. But overall, I was saying in our team meeting this week, it feels very different from 2017 in my mind, in that you actually have real usage of these protocols. There's like actual real traction. I mean, even just like the Twitter NFC thing this week. So it's not like we're going to zero. But I certainly think we're seeing secular repricing within the crypto as well as sort of macro issue that we've been talking about.
00:49:29.910 - 00:50:05.518, Speaker C: Robert, crypto is an asset class, just like equities and fixed income and all the macro, macro things right now across the board for every asset. Prices down, volatility up, implied volatility way up. Right. So I don't think that crypto is unique. I don't think a lot of the sell off is even because of, you know, specific properties of crypto. I think it's just because risk assets in general have just gotten smoked and liquidity. Whether it's in equities or crypto is the same thing, right.
00:50:05.518 - 00:50:45.654, Speaker C: And more and more there's interconnectedness and shared ownership between equities and crypto. Right. Whereas five years ago that really wasn't the case. So I think in general, what equities do, crypto will do more than people expect. I think that correlation is probably higher than most people expect going forward. I think it's probably going to rebound because risk assets generally always do rebound. And I don't think if there is a bear market that it's a bear market that's unique to crypto, I think it would probably be shared and coupled more closely with other asset classes, especially now, especially with inflation.
00:50:45.654 - 00:50:50.910, Speaker C: And the Fed is like the primary drivers of everything. Crypto is less unique.
00:50:51.730 - 00:51:58.146, Speaker E: Okay, well, I did just see that Danielle of Wonderland got liquidated for $18 million. So that seems like an interesting observation to note in this chat since we mentioned ohm, earlier. I think this is the year of the next Alt L one right there's. This really good I thought there's quite good podcasts with Hasu and Suzu on the mercenary Alt L One rotation of people who have big size, like sue kind of keep moving to whichever new L one has new stuff. And I think this does seem to be like, at least from the DFI standpoint, the year of near and Cosmos. I think the Saluna Vax 2021 becomes Cosmos near 2022 and you're seeing a lot of stuff on Aurora starting to actually exist. Overall market structure, I don't know, I don't think I have some great prediction, but I do think in those two ecosystems, it seems like there's a lot.
00:51:58.168 - 00:52:34.940, Speaker A: More growth happening very briefly. I think that probably we'll see crypto give a little bit more away as interest rates creep up, but I don't think it's going to be too much worse than where we are today. But, yeah, my view similar to Robert's. I think that you're going to see crypto kind of stapled to growth tech stocks for a while until I think eventually you're going to see a decoupling. But I don't think we're there yet. But overall, I think, like Tom said, fundamentals look good. And so, although I think you're going to still see private valuations really high, I think the public markets are going to be relatively cheap for a while.
00:52:34.940 - 00:52:56.706, Speaker A: And at the end of the day, I don't think rates are going to be elevated forever, especially kind of going into midterms. There's going to be demand for the S P to bounce back. And I think political positioning being what it is, I don't think that either party is going to be accepted, is going to be happy with rates being super low and the S P not doing know over the next few.
00:52:56.808 - 00:53:02.518, Speaker E: So, yeah, actually, do you think rates will go up at all? Just quick binary question.
00:53:02.684 - 00:53:08.120, Speaker A: Yes, rates will definitely go up from where we are right now. I don't think so.
00:53:08.730 - 00:53:12.170, Speaker E: I'm pricing in a KFAB from Uncle Powell.
00:53:12.750 - 00:53:16.700, Speaker C: I would bet you any amount of money that rates get hiked at least once this year.
00:53:17.550 - 00:53:20.186, Speaker E: Maybe marginally, but I kind of feel.
00:53:20.208 - 00:53:23.982, Speaker A: Like the market make a bad right now. I'm very pro this.
00:53:24.116 - 00:53:27.310, Speaker E: The market is trying to manipulate Powell by crashing.
00:53:29.490 - 00:53:31.600, Speaker C: Pretty bad way to manipulate him.
00:53:32.050 - 00:54:00.390, Speaker E: I just have been getting a lot more of a sense that inflation seems to be very heterogeneous right now, or the crash has caused people to measure inflation very differently. And it seems to not be like this. The transitory narrative thing has clearly there's some truth to it. It's not totally a lie. And I'm not convinced it's going to be like this big interest rate increase because some sectors of the economy are really crashing.
00:54:01.450 - 00:54:17.530, Speaker A: Okay, well, in the interest of time and also in the interest of subject matter, I think we'll have to revisit this as the year goes on, but this expect this to continue to develop in future episodes. So for now, thank you, everybody, and we'll be back again in a couple of weeks. Bye.
