00:00:00.090 - 00:00:00.640, Speaker A: You.
00:00:03.650 - 00:00:33.538, Speaker B: Hi, everyone. Welcome to Unchained, your no Hype resource for all things crypto. I'm your host, Laura Shin, author of The Cryptopians.

Today's guest is Abraham Eisenberg, blogger at Deep Phi Value, and more commonly known as the Mega Markets Attacker.
00:01:06.014 - 00:01:07.294, Speaker B: Welcome, Avi.
00:01:07.422 - 00:01:08.100, Speaker A: Hey.
00:01:08.470 - 00:02:04.718, Speaker B: So I should let listeners know that Avi agreed to chat with me as long as I did not ask him direct questions about what happened on Mango Markets. So I'm just going to give a little bit of an explication for those of you who don't know what happened here. Some people called this a hack, some of them called this a market manipulation. Avi tweeted that he believed it was a highly profitable trading strategy. Essentially what happened is that Avi and a team he was working with took out $114,000,000 on Mango markets that was not meant to be taken out by them. The way that this happened was that he essentially had a loan and he drove up the price of the collateral so that he was able to take out much, much larger loans, which effectively wiped out all the value on Mango Markets. A slightly more detailed description is he just funded one account with 5 million USDC.
00:02:04.718 - 00:02:55.810, Speaker B: Then he offered 483,000,000 units of Mango perps. He founded a second account with 5 million USDC collateral, and then took out a huge, long position that moved the price of the Mngo spot market. And that was what enabled him to take out the huge amount of loans and effectively drain Mango Markets. Avi this kind of thing happens a lot in DeFi, where there's kind of an intent behind the code and then a way that the code actually works that differs from that intent. And as we just mentioned, some people would have said what you did was a hack or market manipulation. You called it a highly profitable trading strategy. So in general, how do you view these events when the way the code actually functions is different from the intent?
00:02:56.410 - 00:03:30.958, Speaker A: So, first of all, I think a lot of these, just speaking in generalities, sometimes it's very unclear what the intent might have been. Sometimes the code doesn't match docs. Sometimes the docs say something and it's just not implemented. And sometimes the code does exactly what was intended. It's just that what was intended isn't what anyone wanted. Which is there's a couple of different lines. Like for a lending platform, they're willing to lend at whatever the price of the token is.
00:03:30.958 - 00:04:01.400, Speaker A: There's no intent that this it kind of explicitly depends on what the current price of the token is. There's no intent that the price of the token should be non volatile. It's hard to say, oh, the intent was that the token price should never change. I mean, crypto prices change all the time, so it's kind of hard to even define where your intent is in some of these cases. Kind of would partly reject the premise here.
00:04:02.430 - 00:04:24.386, Speaker B: So you are saying that essentially because the loan was taken at the time that the price of Mngo was reflected at what other people perceived to be this unfair or manipulated price, that you're saying that was the price and therefore taking that amount of loans was like a fair and square deal or any situation that resembles this?
00:04:24.568 - 00:04:42.530, Speaker A: Well, I think in general, you'd have to define if a protocol uses, for example, a TWAP, then their intent is that the average price of a circular token over a particular period of time is what they're going to price off protocol uses.
00:04:42.610 - 00:04:47.654, Speaker B: A spot price swap is time weighted average price or something. I forget what that is for.
00:04:47.692 - 00:05:27.090, Speaker A: Okay, it's an average price over a period of time. Or some protocols will use the instant price. It won't take an average but whatever methodology they use to determine the price, that's what that tent is. Now, if you were able to get it to recognize a price that didn't reflect what the actual average price was or what the actual spot price was, then it could be said that you're doing something that doesn't reflect the intent. But if the actual price was that way under whatever rules they had, then it's not clear what it means to say it doesn't reflect the intent.
00:05:27.510 - 00:06:04.080, Speaker B: It sounds like, again, this goes back to how in your Tweet you said that you felt that this was a highly profitable trading strategy. And maybe this takes us to sort of the next kind of event in this story, which was that you then made a proposal to return $67 million to investors as long as they agreed to a condition, which we'll talk about later, but just overall, because this isn't the first time that a hacker has returned some of the money. So why do you think that people who are in this type of situation offer to return some amount of it back?
00:06:04.630 - 00:06:30.570, Speaker A: I can't speak for anyone else in this case. As I stated publicly, I wanted to ensure that other users weren't hurt. And so I helped negotiate the settlement and make sure that everyone, all the users of the platform would be able to withdraw even though the platform was technically insolvent.
00:06:31.150 - 00:07:03.682, Speaker B: And so why not do something a little bit more similar to what someone like Sam's Son does, where you identified something in the code that would enable one person to kind of profit from it at the expense of others? And with Sam, as I'm sure you're aware, he often will either warn the community about these kinds of potential attacks, or more often, he'll try to rescue the money before someone can exploit those situations. So why not approach it that way?
00:07:03.736 - 00:07:17.190, Speaker A: Instead, I think he's mostly looking at different kinds of stuff. I'm mostly looking at arbitrages and trades, and he seems to be looking more for exploits, so I don't know that it's directly comparable.
00:07:18.570 - 00:07:24.218, Speaker B: Also, if you believed that what you did was legal, then why is it that you decided to return some of.
00:07:24.224 - 00:07:36.510, Speaker A: This money for what? I said earlier that I wanted to ensure that the users would be able to withdraw and access their funds.
00:07:37.490 - 00:07:49.054, Speaker B: Okay, well, one other thing I wanted to ask was there was a condition that you had on returning the money, which was that Mango should repay some bad debt that it used to save Soland in June.
00:07:49.182 - 00:08:37.060, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a misconception. I think someone at some firm told the journalists, and it just went everywhere, and it has no basis in reality. As far as I know, Mango did not have significant bad debt as of a couple of weeks ago, prior to whatever happened. The soul instinct is just I don't even know where it came from. Yeah. The settlement was just related to the current insolvency or the insolvency as of a few weeks ago, in which it was trying to make sure that users would be able to recover funds that had been deposited at the time. Had nothing to do with Soland, had nothing to do with the account that moved over from there.
00:08:37.060 - 00:08:39.940, Speaker A: That wasn't bad, as far as I know.
00:08:41.110 - 00:08:57.750, Speaker B: Okay. And so, in general, when we see these kinds of situations, you proposed what some people view as an extremely high bounty amount, and I was curious for your thoughts on how these kinds of bounty amounts should be decided.
00:08:58.430 - 00:09:06.570, Speaker A: I don't really view it that way. I think bounty is kind of more relevance to different situations.
00:09:07.470 - 00:09:09.420, Speaker B: So what term would you use?
00:09:09.890 - 00:09:29.906, Speaker A: The ultimate agreement, as I said, was a settlement to ensure that users would be able to recover funds and the exchange would remain capitalized to continue operations. It was just something that all the parties were able to agree on. Okay.
00:09:30.008 - 00:09:37.480, Speaker B: Yeah. And ultimately, it was 47 million that was decided upon that you and your team would receive, is that correct?
00:09:37.850 - 00:09:45.160, Speaker A: It's somewhat more complicated than that because of initial capital and other various things and yeah, I can't really comment on the specific numbers.
00:09:46.170 - 00:10:23.906, Speaker B: Okay, right. I think I saw some commentary that you had spent about 10 million on the attack, therefore it would ultimately be 37 million. Okay, so in a moment we're going to talk about some other conversations that were happening around this event. But first a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible. For years you've heard about the promise of blockchain technology and yet high fees, security risks and unreliable chains have been the reality. It doesn't have to be this way. Avalanche believes innovators deserve web3 infrastructure they can count on with the flexibility and tooling to build anything they want, any way they want.
00:10:23.906 - 00:11:09.460, Speaker B: Chosen by global leaders like KKR, Deloitte, Lemonade and Mastercard, avalanche has built a strong reputation as one of the world's fastest, most reliable blockchains. To learn more about Avalanche, visit Avox network or follow on Twitter at avalanche. Avox explore the platform millions are using for its speed, stability and scalability. Avalanche create without limits. Back to my conversation with Avi. So I was know one of the conditions was that the Dao agreed that no criminal investigations would be pursued against you or your team and I was wondering what your thoughts were on how much influence DAOs really have over that kind of situation.
00:11:09.990 - 00:11:23.640, Speaker A: Yeah, I can't comment on the legal aspects of this. They're just settlement agreement and the terms of that are out there will account beyond that.
00:11:25.050 - 00:11:50.750, Speaker B: Okay, and I was also curious, and this is probably also for other people in a similar situation to you, but what are your thoughts on people who I guess perpetrate these types of economic attacks or these types of arbitrages? What are your thoughts on how comfortable they should be about coming out and claiming that they were part of those trades?
00:11:51.650 - 00:12:18.860, Speaker A: I think when there's any profitable trader is going to attract some jealousy and some hate and like you look at some of the stuff people say about Sam and he's obviously made billions of dollars with various highly profitable yes, and he gets lots of hate. Rex had a whole article calling him out recently. Yeah, if you're out there in your public you're kind of painting a target on yourself. But here's what it is.
00:12:20.750 - 00:12:29.158, Speaker B: So you feel basically people are going to hate on them anyway so they should feel comfortable just owning who they are. Is that the conclusion?
00:12:29.254 - 00:13:10.140, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean I have a post from almost a year ago talked about some of my profitable arbitrages NFT sniping and interest rate arbitrages and other lending protocols and some people weren't happy. I remember when I was flipping NFTs, people were annoyed because the bots which I was running about was making it harder for people to win their own gas wars. So I was getting ahead of them and there's a lot of hate for that, for scalpers. Just like if you ever look through the farms there's always hate for ticket scalpers. Well there's some selection of people just don't like seeing other people make money is what it is.
00:13:13.550 - 00:13:28.986, Speaker B: That is true actually. I'll definitely agree with that. So I was curious, can you just talk a little bit more about your history with crypto and how you came to be so just highly skilled and knowledgeable about DFI?
00:13:29.098 - 00:14:11.740, Speaker A: So I've been coding for a long time, just kind of as a hobby, and I got into crypto early 2021. I was looking at prediction markets, a lot of fun on Polymarket back in the day, their prediction market on Polygon. And then I started looking into yield farming. I started looking into NFTs back when they took off last year. And I just kept researching and figuring out how ERP 1559 works, which is which is key to the NFT sniping. You have to figure out how to get the cheapest gas possible. Had to figure out how the different chains worked.
00:14:11.740 - 00:14:49.610, Speaker A: Everything moved so fast last year that everything was all kind of happening at once, and you just had to learn all the protocols. And then over time, you kind of just get used to it and there's less and less novelty. And every new protocol is a copy of the same three protocols, so it takes less and less time to pick up. And then you find the loopholes, you find the Arbitrages, and it's in a very wide variety of trades, as you can see from my blogs and my tweets.
00:14:50.270 - 00:14:56.060, Speaker B: I have to say that I'm absolutely amazed that you only got into Crypto in early 2021.
00:14:57.310 - 00:15:32.760, Speaker A: Yeah, well, that's when I got really serious. When I was like 19, I think I was doing Arbitrages between Coinbase and Circle, back when Circle used to sell Bitcoin, and it was like you would buy Bitcoin for $500 and then you would sell it for $505 on Circle and then send it back to the bank. This was, I don't know, 2014, 2015, something like that. And then I gave it all up and I quit and I sold all my Bitcoins, and now they're way higher. And then I kind of got back in last year.
00:15:33.930 - 00:15:37.462, Speaker B: When was that period when you sold like 2015, 2016 or something?
00:15:37.596 - 00:16:15.106, Speaker A: I thought I was doing this Arbitrage. And then I think I remember looking back at my emails and at one point I had 13 bitcoins back when they were worth $200. And then I think I had like, three bitcoins kind of left over, and then they had this incredible pump and I sold all my Bitcoins at 2500. So that would have been, I guess, early 2017, during the first kind of or I guess that was the second Bull Run, but the first kind of institutional one. And then I said, Got it, I'll take my eight grand or something. And I went into other areas and then look at crypto. For a few years, crypto went down.
00:16:15.106 - 00:16:25.400, Speaker A: I went to say, hopefully it goes below 2500 so I can feel good about selling. And if it ever went, like the lowest it went was, what, 3000 in march 2020.
00:16:27.610 - 00:16:57.860, Speaker B: Well, so you talked about how you've been a coder all your life. And I was curious because when you tweeted that you were taking responsibility for this maneuver, ari Paul tweeted a friendly suggestion to you that you quote, spend your talent building instead of playing zero sum or negative games. And then he said that he felt you would have a lot more pride in what you had done with your life in the future. You responded something about how you've already thought about this. Can you elaborate on that?
00:16:59.030 - 00:17:40.160, Speaker A: Yeah, so, I mean, I talked about my earlier Ecommerce business which was building, but that kind of got destroyed. How so? There's still some active litigation, so I don't want to get into too much detail on that. But basically we were selling a few million dollars a year on Amazon and one of our competitors just shut us down and told Amazon false things about the quality of the products and got the account shut down. And that business was over. Basically. Very nasty world out there.
00:17:41.810 - 00:17:53.394, Speaker B: So basically that kind of made you feel that it was impossible to make a living in what Ari would call a not zero sum game.
00:17:53.432 - 00:18:40.340, Speaker A: Is that what you're I think it's definitely possible. It's just very hard to actually enforce your the legal system is extremely slow. I guess I feel that once I had that experience, I'm just going to happy to get into any industry, any area. And I'm not so concerned about building distinction. It just doesn't feel that I need to care about that. I care about running my business and trades and whatever properly and make sure everything's by the book. But I don't see this kind of artificial builder distinction doesn't really seem relevant to me.
00:18:43.110 - 00:19:19.840, Speaker B: You've argued in our conversation that what you did was just a trade or an arbitrage. But as I'm sure you're aware, a lot of people, as I mentioned, view this as market manipulation. I mean, you're here on this interview, but you're wearing sunglasses. I'm sure you're aware that people would at least view what you're doing as being more like a gray hat hack, if not flat out black hat hack. And like you said, you would do this interview as long as you didn't have to actually talk about the event. So doesn't that sort of show that you understand that there's some risk here and that maybe this isn't fully on the up and up?
00:19:20.450 - 00:19:27.010, Speaker A: I can't talk about that because there was a settlement agreement, like I said, and go into details on that, unfortunately.
00:19:28.630 - 00:19:49.914, Speaker B: Okay, well, let's talk about something else, which is that this week Compound decided to pause for assets that have low market liquidity. And basically that was because they didn't want to have the kind of event that happened on Mango Markets. And I was curious to hear your thoughts on the fact that essentially what you did with Mango Markets is what prompted this change.
00:19:50.032 - 00:20:23.614, Speaker A: I guess that and mean I was also tweeting various potential trades on Aza and others. I think that it's good that the various big protocols have taken a closer look and decided to clear off some of their lower quality collateral. I'm a heavy user of some of these ava. In particular, I've used heavily many good trades with ava, and I'm happy that they're starting to clean up their risk.
00:20:23.662 - 00:20:29.702, Speaker B: Exposures, even though that basically removes these kinds of opportunities for you.
00:20:29.756 - 00:20:56.190, Speaker A: Well, I've had many other opportunities with Ava. The interest rate arbitrage on ample from a year ago. I used them to borrow UST extremely profitable. Recently I did this great SW AirDrop play with Ava. Just borrowed a few million worth of s. And then before the merge after the merge, I got this free FW that I could dump.
00:20:57.970 - 00:20:59.950, Speaker B: You'Re like a mini Kevin Zoe.
00:21:01.410 - 00:21:09.710, Speaker A: I've just had a lot of cool opportunities over the year, and I wouldn't want them to get drained.
00:21:10.550 - 00:21:18.440, Speaker B: All right, well, last question. Is there any particular message that you have for the DeFi community or the crypto community in general?
00:21:19.850 - 00:21:22.120, Speaker A: I don't think so, no.
00:21:23.690 - 00:21:34.314, Speaker B: Oh, like, nothing about maybe, I guess, shoddy construction of these smart contracts that enable these opportunities? Nothing like that.
00:21:34.512 - 00:21:39.690, Speaker A: I mean, I have opinions on all this stuff, but I don't have any kind of overarching narrative.
00:21:40.430 - 00:21:43.742, Speaker B: All right, well, is there anything else that I didn't ask you that you'd want to say?
00:21:43.876 - 00:21:44.560, Speaker A: No.
00:21:46.050 - 00:21:49.370, Speaker B: Okay, well, thank you so much for coming on Unchained.
00:21:49.450 - 00:21:51.040, Speaker A: Thank you for having me.

Reddit onboards 3 million users to NFTs. Since the launch of Reddit's NFT marketplace in July, users of the platform have created 3 million wallets. According to Reddit chief product officer, Polly Bot, the methods by which the social media platform achieved this adoption in such a short time caught the attention of many. The company's strategy was to avoid blockchain terms like crypto or NFTs.
00:22:58.130 - 00:23:44.690, Speaker B: Reddit refers to NFTs as digital collectibles and only briefly mentions that they will be available on the blockchain. With the more user friendly approach, trading volumes have soared over the past few days, reaching a sales volume of $2.5 million. On Monday, Kane and Linder, cofounder and CEO of gaming company Stardust, told the Bloc, I think that decontextualization, that these are just games, these are just collectibles. These are just items you can take from one game to another. It's going to make this technology so much more accessible. Updated Policy Terms give Apple a hefty cut of NFT app purchases Tech giant Apple updated its App Store policy terms to give more clarity on how to sell NFTs and crypto within the iOS ecosystem.
00:23:44.690 - 00:24:33.214, Speaker B: As per the new terms, applications offering trading of NFTs will be restricted from including buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct consumers to purchasing mechanisms other than inapp purchases. Although Apple is showing interest in working with crypto assets, it seems determined to get its share, which is 30% of all inapp purchases, a fee that has long been criticized. Daniel Mason, partner at Framework Ventures, tweeted that this decision harms NFT marketplaces like Openc and Magic Eden or quote, anyone trying to get in the payment flow. Mr. Mason also mentioned that the winners are likely to be crypto exchanges, Web three games, and infrastructure providers. NFT royalty drama continues. Looks rare.
00:24:33.214 - 00:25:34.230, Speaker B: An NFT marketplace on ethereum decided to remove mandatory royalties from its platform, joining others like Pseudoswap X Two, Y Two and Magic Eden instead. Each quarter, the protocol will distribute to creators 25% of the platform fees charged by Looksrare. The pseudonymous Looksrare Cofounder, known as Guts, said with this change, Looks Rare wants to buck the trend with our solution that actually enforces income for creators while still remaining attractive to traders with an effectively zero fee offering, it's a way to turn all that zero royalty volume into something that still benefits the creators. In related news, a new research report from Galaxy Digital showed that Nike and Yuga Labs are the entities that earned the most in NFT royalties, raising the question of whether small creators or big corporations benefit from royalties. MakerDAO partners with Coinbase. But not everyone is on board. OG decentralized lending protocol MakerDAO had some interesting developments this week.
00:25:34.230 - 00:26:15.358, Speaker B: First, the Community ratified a Coinbase partnership, which consists of depositing $1.6 billion worth of Maker's USDC into Coinbase Prime, the exchange's institutional arm. In this way, Maker will earn a 1.5% annual yield, which will account for $24 million of revenue per year. The decision was not supported by everyone in the MakerDAO community. Chris Black, a recognized delegate and Community member, tweeted the proposal, quote, will permanently end MakerDAO's claims of decentralization and censorship resistance. Second, a governance proposal was passed to support the endgame plan of Rune Christensen, the founder of MakerDAO.
00:26:15.358 - 00:27:02.898, Speaker B: As a consequence, the Dao will break into smaller units called Metados with the intention of building a more decentralized project. Lastly, the Community also voted in favor of a plan to accumulate staked ether, or Steeth lido's liquid staking derivative of ETH. A jump in prices triggers talk of a bull market. The crypto markets experienced some relief for a couple of days after weeks of falling prices. Ethereum jumped by 20% in the past seven days, reaching premerge price levels. Meanwhile, the price of bitcoin rose 8% in the same period, and the total crypto market cap surpassed the $1 trillion mark. Once again, this rally wiped out almost $1 billion worth of short positions and already triggered talks of an incoming bull market.
00:27:02.898 - 00:27:45.870, Speaker B: A potential reason why ETH has outperformed the market is that the token has gone deflationary over the past few weeks. With its supply getting close to pre merge levels. The market share of bitcoin against Altcoins hit a two year high this week. Some believe that this is a good sign for Altcoins, since BTC usually leads the way prior to an Altcoin pump. Crypto trader and analyst Arthur Hayes thinks this pump in the markets has to do with the possibility of the US. Treasury, quote, supplying the market with more short term T bills to alleviate a shortage. Other people mentioned, perhaps jokingly, that the reason the prices spiked was the publication of Matt Levine's 40,000 word article on crypto.
00:27:45.870 - 00:28:46.482, Speaker B: However, that seems quite unlikely since other assets in traditional financial markets also experienced massive gains. Despite prices rising in the past few days, there's still a long way to go to recover all these losses. Recently, newsbrook that VC firm A 16 z's first crypto fund is down 40% in the first half of the year. Additionally, Pantera Capital, one of the big players in the industry, has also suffered significant losses. Pantera's early stage token fund has lost 71% of its value since the beginning of the year, according to the block. The Debate about how to Regulate crypto Spices Up last week, FTX CEO Sam Bankman Fried published an industry norms manual in which he proposed enforcing regulation on DeFi protocols via their front ends, thus setting off a heated debate on crypto regulation. In a long rebuttal, Eric Voorhees, founder and CEO of Shapeshift, said that Binkman Fried's proposal would put crypto on a path to tyranny.
00:28:46.482 - 00:29:40.920, Speaker B: However, SBF claimed that his plan is, quote, better than the status quo and better than we're likely to get. Gabriel Shapiro, general counsel at Delphi Labs, disagreed with SBF's take on the difficulty of determining whether a website is a broker, saying mere websites must not be regulated. Broker dealers Shapiro and Bankman Fried have agreed to come on unchained to debate everything about crypto regulation.
