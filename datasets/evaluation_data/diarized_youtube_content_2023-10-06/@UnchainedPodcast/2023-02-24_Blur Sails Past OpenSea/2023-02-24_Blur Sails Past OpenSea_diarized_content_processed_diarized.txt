00:00:00.090 - 00:00:00.640, Speaker A: You.
00:00:02.130 - 00:00:49.158, Speaker B: Thanks for tuning into this week's news. Recap blur leaves Openc in its wake upstart NFT marketplace Blur overtook category leader OpenSea in transaction volume this week, ending Opensea's longtime dominance. Over 80% of NFT trading volume occurred on Blur. Dwarfing opensea's 13%. Blur officially launched last fall, but its very 14th governance token, AirDrop, helped boost trading to frothy levels and put pressure on OpenSea. The project's pseudonymous founder Pacman also revealed his name, Tshen Roquer, after appearing on the chopping block this week. He told the block, we focus on the NFT natives first, and from there we can expand, similar to how finance expanded downmarket and broadened the offering.
00:00:49.158 - 00:01:28.870, Speaker B: Blur, however, faces obstacles. Onchain data suggests that Wash trading could have helped generate that high trading volume. A more recent analysis shows that 25% of Blur's total volume comes from 50 traders. Compare that to OpenSea, where the top 250 NFT traders make up 11% of volume. For now, Openc maintains a larger user base, even though it admits it's lost some customers. Since Blur came around in October, we started to see meaningful volume and users move to NFT marketplaces that don't fully enforce creator earnings. Tweeted OpenSea last Friday as it moved to an optional royalty model.
00:01:28.870 - 00:02:07.330, Speaker B: Today, that shift has accelerated dramatically. Despite our best efforts, OpenSea is taking steps to regain dominance. In addition to restructuring royalties, it is temporarily eliminating its marketplace fee. Blur, meanwhile, is doubling down on its strategy. It's planning to distribute another 300 million Blur tokens for season two. In related news, bitcoin Ordinals continue to garner interest On Wednesday, Bitcoin mining company Luxor bought Ordinal hub a Bitcoin NFT marketplace Coinbase optimistically jumps into L2 wars. Coinbase is looking for creative ways to generate interest in crypto and increase revenue.
00:02:07.330 - 00:03:16.470, Speaker B: The Crypto Exchange announced Thursday that it has launched a testnet for its own L2 network base eventually, this blockchain, which is built using Optimism's open source software and could be extended to include salana, could serve as a hub for scores of decentralized applications. Check out Unchained's video on the announcement for more information. There's plenty of demand for Ethereum Scaling Solutions and for Rollups in particular. On Tuesday, for the first time, a L2 has posted more transactions than Ethereum, with Arbitrum taking the mantle. Meanwhile, proof of stake sidechain polygon users got a scare on Wednesday when several trades temporarily fell out of sync and the Polygon Scan Block Explorer stopped updating. In related news, Ethereum's Shanghai Capella upgrade will be rolled out on the Sepolia test network by the end of February before launching on main net in March. As for Coinbase, its foray into L2 S reflects a desire to create an onramp to the exchange on Tuesday, it reported a $557,000,000 net loss in the fourth quarter of 2022 despite beating analysts revenue expectations.
00:03:16.470 - 00:04:05.494, Speaker B: Though quarterly transaction revenue was down 12%, the exchange pointed to lower crypto prices as a culprit. On a positive note, subscription revenue and staking revenue were both up. TOPSHOT basketball NFTs may be securities judge rules. A federal judge on Wednesday denied Dapper Labs'motion to dismiss a lawsuit alleging its NBA TOPSHOT NFTs are unregistered securities. The class action could represent a significant hurdle for how digital collectibles are bought and sold. While Dapper argued that it's fundamentally selling digital versions of a basketball card, the judge wasn't so sure. Using the Howey test, a method for determining what constitutes an investment contract, District Judge Victor Monero found that, quote, purchasers'fortunes were tied to the overall success of Dapper Labs.
00:04:05.494 - 00:04:52.650, Speaker B: If the company can't convince him otherwise, he may roll them to be securities. Dapper Labs has until March 15 to respond. Finance Separates Reserves from Customer Tokens Last month, Finance admitted it had accidentally been storing some customer funds, with the collateral backing its B tokens. Finance on Wednesday said it had implemented a semiautomated process to prevent this from happening again. It theoretically allows Finance employees to intervene in case the reserves are at risk. Finance the top crypto exchange by trading volume mints 97 different types of tokens. These B tokens are wrapped versions of, say, Bitcoin, meaning you can swap your BTC for BTC B and use it on Finance's bespoke blockchain.
00:04:52.650 - 00:05:30.630, Speaker B: The company's previous system for backing BUSD, which is issued by its partner paxos failed, and at least once more than $1 billion in collateral went missing. Last week, the securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Department of Financial Services put pressure on Paxos to stop Minting BUSD. Paxos has severed its relationship with the crypto exchange. It now says it's having a constructive discussion with the SEC. If all that weren't enough, Finance USD very briefly lost its peg. Compared to the Dai stablecoin Wednesday, it dropped to $0.20 on the exchange before immediately going back to $1.
00:05:30.630 - 00:06:31.210, Speaker B: Voyager's Sail to Binance US in the Balance as creditors fight over FTX loan this week, creditors of Voyager Digital seemed ready to back a plan to sell the bankrupt crypto lender to Binance US when the Federal Trade Commission filed an objection with the bankruptcy court. The agency is investigating Voyager Digital about what it alleges were deceptive and unfair marketing of cryptocurrency to the public. The SEC followed suit, alleging that some transactions required as part of the proposed Binance US deal, particularly those involving Voyager's token VGX, could violate securities law. Meanwhile, Voyager's creditors approved the plan, which could result in them recovering around half of their assets. But that's only if all goes according to plan they have. Subpoenaed. Former FTX CEO Sam Pinkman freed over FTX's attempts to get back a $446,000,000 loan repayment from Voyager no surprise that Voyager creditors would rather have it in their pockets.
00:06:31.210 - 00:07:11.846, Speaker B: Lawyers for SBF called the subpoena procedurally deficient because it was delivered to his mother. SBF Gets Hit with More Indictments U. S. Officials filed new charges against the former FTX chief, including bank fraud and the unlawful operation of an unlicensed money transmitter. SBF was already facing nine charges, including wire fraud and conspiracy to commit securities fraud. The count is up to twelve in support of its bank fraud allegation. The government said that when opening a bank account, SBF, quote, falsely represented to a financial institution that the account would be used for trading and market making.
00:07:11.846 - 00:07:41.258, Speaker B: It alleges. The account was instead used to receive and transmit customer funds. Bankman Fried also faces a modified charge on his political involvement. Prosecutors alleged he and his conspirators made corporate and committee contributions in the name of others. Last Friday, Bloomberg reported that FTX's former director of engineering, Nishrad Singh, is expected to plead guilty to fraud charges. More FTX fun and games. The FTX saga continues to take down investors.
00:07:41.258 - 00:08:22.618, Speaker B: Galwa Capital, a cryptocurrency hedge fund which had half its capital trapped on the exchange, unwound all of its positions this week. Galwa's investors are said to do slightly better than their Voyager counterparts. Galwa says they will get back 90% of their funds that aren't on FTX. Crypto lending firms weren't the only ones left holding the bag after Terra and FTX collapsed. According to the bank of International Settlements, investors in emerging economies took the biggest losses. On a related note, funds that buy distressed assets are purchasing FTX bankruptcy claims for $15 to in private OTC markets. According to an FTX creditor quoted by CoinDesk.
00:08:22.618 - 00:09:09.526, Speaker B: Buyers are likely eyeing a recovery of $0.50 on the dollar within the next five years. Speaking of CoinDesk, the crypto outlets ian Allison and Tracy Wang won a prestigious Polk Award for their work. The George Polk Award committee said Allison's and Wong's three winning stories quote, brought young Sam Bankman Fried and his supposed $32 billion cryptocurrency empire crashing down in just ten days. Congrats CoinDesk. More crypto layoffs hit the sector following the lead of Coinbase Consensus and other crypto companies, Polygon Labs laid off around 100 employees on Tuesday, or 20% of its workforce. Polygon representatives, maker of the popular Ethereum sidechain, insist its treasury is healthy.
00:09:09.526 - 00:10:03.002, Speaker B: They say it has $250,000,000 and 1.9 billion of its native matic tokens, which trade for well over $1. Masari, which aggregates and analyzes blockchain data, is cutting 15% of its workforce. CEO Ryan Selkis told CoinDesk on Thursday that while the company will continue hiring for some open roles, it needs to restructure. Australia based gaming firm Immutable also announced layoffs of 11% of its workforce to improve its cash position. According to Immutable, which earned unicorn status last year, it has $280,000,000 on hand, equivalent to about four years of spending at current levels and disclosure Immutable is a former sponsor of Unchained. On a slightly different note, the Information reports that eight employees have left venture capital firm Paradigm within the last five months, including two of its six investment partners and four of its 13 engineers.
00:10:03.002 - 00:10:59.710, Speaker B: The cryptocentric VC firm had invested $278,000,000 in FTX. It subsequently wrote the value of that investment down to zero OneCoin's Crypto Queen May Have Been Murdered The FBI has been hunting Ruja Ignatova, better known as the Crypto Queen, since 2017. It added her to its Ten Most Wanted list after she cofounded the OneCoin Ponzi scheme and allegedly made off with $4 billion from victims. Ignatova has thus far eluded authorities and hasn't been seen in five years. New evidence suggests a potential reason she might have been killed back in 2018. This evidence comes from documents recently acquired by the Bureau for Investigative Reporting and Data. A Bulgarian news outlet, Bird, claims that a Bulgarian drug kingpin put out a hit on Ignatova and that she was killed on a Greek yacht in November 2018.
00:10:59.710 - 00:11:23.974, Speaker B: Prior reporting from the BBC suggested OneCoin might have been affiliated with Eastern European mobsters. Ignatova, who was born in Bulgaria, may have been found hiding out with the wrong people. Time for fun bits. This week, Tim Berners Lee, creator of the World Wide Web, made some disparaging comments about crypto. Jenny from Unchained has some commentary about.
00:11:24.012 - 00:12:03.050, Speaker A: That on a recent CNBC podcast episode, worldwide web creator Tim Berners Lee referred to crypto as dangerous and compared it to the.com bubble, which feels unfair to me because the.com bubble at least has the decency to be over. Listen, I believe in anyone's right to criticize anything, but is this not a little bit of a Frankenstein and his monster situation? If he wants to take credit for all the people who got laid because of Tinder, he's also gotta accept responsibility for whatever happened at NFT Miami. Tim Berners Lee also wanted listeners to know that he is dissatisfied with the way that his original vision for the Internet played out. We know. Have you been on the Internet recently? It's all pop up ads.
00:12:03.050 - 00:12:24.490, Speaker A: No shit. He didn't intend for that to happen. I don't mean to be too hard on Berners Lee. He is doing his best to write the Internet. For instance, he created a startup with the aim of giving people more control over their data. Only problem with his startup is that he named it Interrupt, which I have to imagine is supposed to evoke images of disruption within oneself. To be honest, I'm just thinking about that time that I ate four Fiber One bars in one sitting.
00:12:24.830 - 00:12:46.330, Speaker B: Thanks so much for joining us today.
