00:00:03.738 - 00:00:11.566, Speaker B: From numerous Blackrock ETF developments to rumors of a US IPO that could change the industry, this first full week of.
00:00:11.588 - 00:00:16.074, Speaker A: November had us on our toes. I'm Michael del Castillo, a night badget.
00:00:16.122 - 00:00:18.846, Speaker B: Fellow at Columbia University, and this is.
00:00:18.868 - 00:00:20.990, Speaker A: Your weekly crypto recap.
00:00:21.330 - 00:00:41.946, Speaker B: In a one two punch this week, we learned that asset management giant Blackrock has filed paperwork not only to form a new entity called the iShares Ethereum Trust, but paperwork that would result in the first Ethereum ETF if it's approved. Though BlackRock declined to comment on the filing, the move suggests the company is.
00:00:41.968 - 00:00:45.274, Speaker A: Serious about expanding its presence in the crypto space.
00:00:45.472 - 00:00:49.754, Speaker B: If the ETFs are approved, they will let investors gain exposure to the two.
00:00:49.792 - 00:00:55.230, Speaker A: Largest cryptocurrencies by market value without having to buy and store the assets directly.
00:00:55.970 - 00:01:00.558, Speaker B: This week, a contentious dispute has emerged between market maker Winter mute and the.
00:01:00.564 - 00:01:04.114, Speaker A: Switzerland based nonprofit near foundation, set up.
00:01:04.152 - 00:01:07.230, Speaker B: In 2019 to support the near protocol.
00:01:07.310 - 00:01:14.740, Speaker A: Which has raised $500 million and created a cryptocurrency now valued at $1.4 billion.
00:01:15.430 - 00:01:21.410, Speaker B: Winter Mute's CEO Evgenny Gavoy has publicly accused the near foundation and development firm.
00:01:21.490 - 00:01:29.126, Speaker A: Aurora Labs of renegging on the an $11 million redemption deal involving the USN stablecoin.
00:01:29.238 - 00:01:33.834, Speaker B: Gavoy's series of tweets outlined what appears to be a complete breakdown of trust.
00:01:33.952 - 00:01:42.746, Speaker A: Between firm leadership, alleging that the near foundation had initially committed to backstopping USN and had earmarked funds for this purpose.
00:01:42.858 - 00:01:48.094, Speaker B: That means, despite public and private commitments, Wintermute has so far been unable to.
00:01:48.132 - 00:01:51.898, Speaker A: Redeem USN for USDT on a Onetoone basis.
00:01:52.074 - 00:01:57.902, Speaker B: After months of waiting, Gavoy alleges the near foundation's offer to redeem was reduced.
00:01:57.966 - 00:02:01.102, Speaker A: To a mere 20% of the original sum.
00:02:01.246 - 00:02:12.054, Speaker B: Gavoy's public airing of grievances was apparently intended to gain public support, Gavoy said, quote, by not making it public, we would effectively contribute to bad practices being.
00:02:12.092 - 00:02:14.786, Speaker A: Tolerated and repeated, end quote.
00:02:14.898 - 00:02:17.186, Speaker B: The near cryptocurrency fell off a cliff.
00:02:17.218 - 00:02:24.710, Speaker A: On Thursday, dropping over 10% in less than 1 hour, reaching a recent low of $1.37.
00:02:24.870 - 00:02:54.786, Speaker B: Boston based Circle, the powerhouse behind the $24 billion USDC stablecoin, is reportedly in discussions to go public next year. While the company has kept a close lid on its latest valuation, it's worth noting that in February 2022, it was valued at $9 billion during a previous failed SPAC deal. In September, Circle CEO Jeremy Alair told Laura on an unchained episode quote we're definitely on the path to be an.
00:02:54.808 - 00:02:57.198, Speaker A: Independent public company, and we've had the.
00:02:57.224 - 00:02:59.442, Speaker B: Benefit of having a number of strategic.
00:02:59.506 - 00:03:02.950, Speaker A: Investors in the company over the years, end quote.
00:03:03.450 - 00:03:07.974, Speaker B: Circle's aspirations to list publicly have been part of a long term strategy, as.
00:03:08.012 - 00:03:13.690, Speaker A: A spokesperson told Bloomberg, though they refrained refrained from commenting on current speculation.
00:03:14.030 - 00:03:19.174, Speaker B: Despite the setback of a failed SPAC, Circle's growth has been punctuated by substantial.
00:03:19.222 - 00:03:22.906, Speaker A: Investments from financial giants like BlackRock and Fidelity.
00:03:23.098 - 00:03:29.006, Speaker B: In spite of Circle's promising developments, the USDC market value is down 55% from.
00:03:29.028 - 00:03:34.100, Speaker A: Its alltime high of $55 billion in June 2022.
00:03:34.470 - 00:03:38.462, Speaker B: Over that same period, stablecoin competitor tether.
00:03:38.606 - 00:03:40.994, Speaker A: Has increased by 30%.
00:03:41.192 - 00:03:44.174, Speaker B: The new leadership at FTX, the cryptocurrency.
00:03:44.222 - 00:03:46.450, Speaker A: Exchange that filed for bankruptcy last year.
00:03:46.520 - 00:03:50.614, Speaker B: Is seeking to sell approximately $744,000,000 in.
00:03:50.652 - 00:03:54.162, Speaker A: Assets held on grayscale and bitwise trusts.
00:03:54.306 - 00:04:14.250, Speaker B: This move is part of the exchange's efforts to repay creditors efficiently and mitigate potential price fluctuations. The assets include $691,000,000 in Grayscale trusts holding $597,000,000 in BTC and $90 million in ETH and $53 million in Bitwise.
00:04:14.330 - 00:04:16.560, Speaker A: Ten crypto index fund.
00:04:16.930 - 00:04:32.302, Speaker B: FTX's November 3 filing with the US bankruptcy court indicates that the sale would enable the preparation for, quote, forthcoming dollarized distributions to creditors and allow the debtors to act swiftly to sell the assets.
00:04:32.366 - 00:04:35.386, Speaker A: At a high price, according to the documents.
00:04:35.518 - 00:04:40.818, Speaker B: FTX's legal team also hopes the proposed sale will reduce the costs and delays.
00:04:40.914 - 00:04:44.050, Speaker A: Associated with separate motions for each sale.
00:04:44.210 - 00:04:46.694, Speaker B: This step is another significant move by.
00:04:46.732 - 00:04:54.874, Speaker A: FTX's bankruptcy managers to address customer and investor losses following the firm's collapse. The news comes in the wake of.
00:04:54.912 - 00:05:00.702, Speaker B: FTX founder Sam Bankman Fried's conviction last week on charges relating to defrauding customers.
00:05:00.836 - 00:05:03.470, Speaker A: And misusing client funds.
00:05:03.810 - 00:05:10.282, Speaker B: Meanwhile, venture capital firm Proof Group, part of the Fahrenheit consortium that acquired cryptocurrency.
00:05:10.346 - 00:05:15.170, Speaker A: Exchange Celsius, is now a contender to help revive FTX.
00:05:15.590 - 00:05:20.894, Speaker B: Also in the hunt, former New York Stock Exchange president Tom Farley's crypto exchange.
00:05:20.942 - 00:05:34.760, Speaker A: Bullis is among the bidders in the bankruptcy auction, according to a Wall Street Journal report. Cryptocurrency exchange Kraken is hiring, and the position has people talking.
00:05:35.610 - 00:05:44.154, Speaker B: The posting for a senior cryptography engineer hints that the company might be developing cryptographic protocols and L2 solutions that.
00:05:44.192 - 00:06:00.042, Speaker A: Make it easier to scale applications built on slower blockchains. Though the reports are unconfirmed, such a move would not be unprecedented. Coinbase launched its own Ethereum L2 in August. News site Coindesk cited the proverbial quote.
00:06:00.106 - 00:06:05.182, Speaker B: People familiar with the matter in a report claiming Kraken was in discussions with.
00:06:05.236 - 00:06:10.450, Speaker A: Potential partners, including Polygon matter Labs and the Nil foundation.
00:06:10.790 - 00:06:13.694, Speaker B: Despite the buz, a Kraken spokesperson maintained.
00:06:13.742 - 00:06:32.422, Speaker A: A veil of secrecy, telling Telegraph and Coindesk, quote, we're always looking to identify and solve new industry challenges and opportunities. We don't have anything further at this time, end quote. We've all heard that before. The crypto community has had mixed reactions.
00:06:32.566 - 00:06:34.762, Speaker B: With some questioning the need for another.
00:06:34.816 - 00:06:45.362, Speaker A: Layer two network in an already fragmented landscape. The L2 market is currently dominated by optimistic rollups, according to data site L two beat.
00:06:45.446 - 00:06:53.634, Speaker B: But Kraken's foray into the space could signal a shift towards zero knowledge proof solutions, which offer distinct advantages such as.
00:06:53.672 - 00:06:58.370, Speaker A: Increased privacy and immediate transaction validity.
00:06:59.670 - 00:07:03.874, Speaker B: The US securities and Exchange Commission is pushing for a summary judgment in its.
00:07:03.912 - 00:07:15.494, Speaker A: Case against terraform labs and its CEO Doe Kwan. In February, the SEC sued the exchange, alleging securities law violations on Friday. That's last Friday, November 3.
00:07:15.612 - 00:07:20.218, Speaker B: The regulator said there was no need for a full trial, citing, quote, clear.
00:07:20.304 - 00:07:35.302, Speaker A: Undisputed, and overwhelming unquote, evidence of fraud and misrepresentation in the marketing of terra and its tokens. Kwan and his lawyers asked the case be thrown out, saying they didn't violate U. S. Securities laws.
00:07:35.446 - 00:07:45.694, Speaker B: The SEC contends that Kwan misled investors about the stability and usage of the Terra USD stablecoin, which collapsed in a high profile event that saw the stablecoin.
00:07:45.742 - 00:08:09.000, Speaker A: Lose its peg to the US dollar, then disintegrate to almost nothing, triggering a broader market downturn. The SEC also challenges the unregistered public sale of Luna and Mir tokens, arguing that they were marketed as investments that would appreciate, based on the company's efforts, a criteria in the Howey test for securities law.
00:08:10.010 - 00:08:16.794, Speaker B: Also this week, jump crypto President Kanav Korea pleaded the fifth when asked about.
00:08:16.832 - 00:08:25.120, Speaker A: A deal with Doe Kwan to help restore the UST stablecoin peg, fueling even more speculation about the case.
00:08:26.130 - 00:08:33.074, Speaker B: Decentralized finance protocol AvA temporarily suspended several markets due to a reported issue with.
00:08:33.112 - 00:08:36.110, Speaker A: A feature across its platform over the weekend.
00:08:36.270 - 00:08:39.106, Speaker B: The so called Ava Guardian, a community.
00:08:39.208 - 00:08:45.378, Speaker A: Elected body, has paused Ava two on Ethereum and frozen specific assets on AvA.
00:08:45.394 - 00:08:50.274, Speaker B: Three across change, including avalanche, polygon, arbitrum.
00:08:50.322 - 00:08:53.110, Speaker A: And optimism on social media.
00:08:53.180 - 00:08:55.574, Speaker B: Ava's team sought to assure users that.
00:08:55.612 - 00:08:57.874, Speaker A: Quote, no funds were at risk, end.
00:08:57.932 - 00:09:00.234, Speaker B: Quote, and that a governance proposal to.
00:09:00.272 - 00:09:03.030, Speaker A: Resume normal operations would be forthcoming.
00:09:03.190 - 00:09:09.114, Speaker B: The proactive measures allow users to manage and withdraw existing positions, but restrict new.
00:09:09.152 - 00:09:12.998, Speaker A: Deposits and borrowing, Ava's founder, Stadi Kulachov.
00:09:13.094 - 00:09:19.614, Speaker B: Wrote on social media. Quote within hours, measures were taken to mitigate the risk, resolve a patch, and.
00:09:19.652 - 00:09:28.260, Speaker A: Review and deploy the first proposal, incident management at its best. End quote only time will tell of how that works out.
00:09:28.710 - 00:09:30.226, Speaker B: At the time of this recording, the.
00:09:30.248 - 00:09:39.446, Speaker A: Details of the vulnerability had not been disclosed, supposedly to prevent potential exploitation. According to the posts, especially considering the.
00:09:39.468 - 00:09:42.674, Speaker B: Existence of multiple AVA forks, each fork.
00:09:42.722 - 00:09:57.930, Speaker A: Marks a potentially separate target using the vulnerability. Despite the operational pause, Ava's native token AvA remains stable at the market. A detailed postmortem is expected once the issue is fully resolved.
00:09:58.990 - 00:10:01.486, Speaker B: This week, the cryptocurrency market witnessed a.
00:10:01.508 - 00:10:25.538, Speaker A: Significant surge in the Ordi token linked to the bitcoin ordinals protocol, with a 77% increase in value following its listing on the finance exchange on Tuesday, trading at around $12. Ordy's rise underscores the growing interest in tokens that utilize the bitcoin network beyond its traditional use. The ordinals protocol, introduced in January, allows.
00:10:25.554 - 00:10:27.222, Speaker B: For the inscription of data such as.
00:10:27.276 - 00:10:40.682, Speaker A: Text, images and even audio or video onto bitcoin's smallest denomination, called the satoshi, effectively bringing NFT like fungibility to bitcoin. Binance has categorized OrTi under its so.
00:10:40.736 - 00:10:47.830, Speaker B: Called seed tag, indicating the status as a supposedly innovative but highly risk asset.
00:10:47.910 - 00:10:59.370, Speaker A: Due to its novelty and potential for volatility. Binance's team has cautioned investors about the risks, advising thorough research and risk management for those considering trading the token.
00:10:59.530 - 00:11:09.394, Speaker B: In related news, Kucoin and gate exchanges announced plans to list the memecoin SAts built using the BRC 20 standard for.
00:11:09.432 - 00:11:12.526, Speaker A: Assets that rely on the bitcoin blockchain.
00:11:12.718 - 00:11:17.846, Speaker B: Moody's analytics has reported that large cap stablecoins, each with a market cap of.

00:11:24.604 - 00:11:26.690, Speaker B: However, that is in fact a slight.
