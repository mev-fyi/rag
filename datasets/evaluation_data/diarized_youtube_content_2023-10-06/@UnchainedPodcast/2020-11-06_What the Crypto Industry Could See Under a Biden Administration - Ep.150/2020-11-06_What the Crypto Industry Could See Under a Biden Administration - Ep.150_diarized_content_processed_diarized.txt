Today's guest is Kristen Smith, executive director of the Blockchain Association and board member of Hodlpack. Welcome, Kristen.
00:00:55.890 - 00:00:57.630, Speaker B: Thanks for having me, Laura.
00:00:57.970 - 00:01:55.060, Speaker A: This week the whole world has been watching the US presidential election or it is still currently probably one of the more momentous ones in recent memory, if not the most momentous. And that's due to many reasons, among which are the pandemic historic levels of civic unrest and intense levels of polarization in the country. And I should just let the viewers know because events are sort of changing in the moment that we are recording this at around 03:00 p.m. Eastern time on Thursday. And at this moment it looks most likely that former Vice President Joe Biden will be elected our 46th president. And so I thought it would be good to check in with you on how advocating for the crypto industry will change. But before we actually get to that question, let's just talk about what it is that both the Blockchain Association and Huddlepack are and what they do.
00:01:55.590 - 00:02:49.986, Speaker B: Yes. The Blockchain Association is a trade association based in Washington, DC. We have 24 member companies and the goal of the organization is to change public policy to benefit the crypto industry. So we work with regulators, we work with lawmakers, sometimes we participate in the court process if needed, but we want better public policy. Hodlpac, which I am a board member of, is a different organization. It's a political action committee that is designed to bring together donations small and large across the crypto industry and in turn donate those money to congressional candidates that have good stances on crypto issues. Another part of Hodlpack is helping to educate the community about what's going on.
00:02:49.986 - 00:03:09.130, Speaker B: And we're working towards building out more grassroots functionality so that we can have people who want to take action and participate have kind of a constructive, meaningful, organized way for them to do so. So Blockchain Association is for crypto companies, Hodlpac is for crypto individuals.
00:03:09.950 - 00:03:31.550, Speaker A: And so to the question I'm sure everybody's wondering about, as for advocating on behalf of the industry or the community, how will that change? And to describe that, why don't you sort of set the baseline by describing what that strategy was under the Trump administration and how you think that will change under a potential Biden administration.
00:03:31.970 - 00:04:03.254, Speaker B: Yeah. So you have to remember, the biggest barrier to getting better policy in Washington is an education barrier. This is a really new, fast emerging space. It's complicated. It's difficult for policymakers to find the time to learn the ins and outs of how it works. Another challenge we have is that most of your everyday average consumers don't really do much with crypto yet. So it's not top of mind for most policymakers.
00:04:03.254 - 00:04:29.762, Speaker B: But our strategy over the past couple of years has been to grow the base of champions on these issues and work with them to put forth what we think are thoughtful, good solutions. Another important piece of what we do is we try to stop bad things from happening, which we've succeeded at a couple of times on the legislative side because it's just as important to stop bad things than it is to get good things going forward.
00:04:29.896 - 00:04:32.274, Speaker A: And what would be an example of that?
00:04:32.472 - 00:05:40.118, Speaker B: Well, there have been a couple bills that have been floated or introduced, like the very early version of the Managed Stablecoins or securities act, for example, that would have defined stablecoins in a way that it wasn't intended to. So the spirit of the legislation might not have actually been that terrible, but the way it was drafted would have been very harmful to the industry. And so we were able to work with that office, get some of those definitions changed, but ultimately it stalled. And so we were able to sort of prevent that from going forward. Because these are such niche issues for policymakers, we've really had to rely heavily on those who have a personal passion for this. You know, Hester Purse, who I know you've interviewed multiple times, Brian Brooks, they have been fantastic allies and champions to have. And having them in those spots know, not only have they been able to put forth their own ideas, but they've been able to educate their peers, their regulator peers on crypto.
00:05:40.118 - 00:06:26.662, Speaker B: So that's positive. And in Congress, we have some good champions that are continuing to put ideas forward. But the reality is it's a long way towards actually getting a big, comprehensive legislative package across the finish line. So as we look to the Biden administration, if that is indeed what we're dealing with, I mean, who knows? Anything could change. I actually think the combination of a Biden administration with a Republican Senate, which I think is where we're going, but again, that could change too. But that is really good for crypto, and there are a couple of reasons for that. The Trump administration is a little bit mixed, right? Like, as I mentioned, we have Hester, we have Brian, they're great.
00:06:26.662 - 00:07:25.034, Speaker B: But we also have Secretary Mnutian, who's not a big fan of this space. We have trump himself. We have Jay Clayton, who has been a know manousian and clayton are appointed by Trump and they've been standing in the way of getting something done. So as we look through the Biden administration, we're hoping to be able to get educated, crypto educated regulators in key positions at the SEC, the CFTC and the OCC and doing what we can to try to influence those. So Biden will play an important role in picking who those people are. But because we have a Republican Senate, those choices I think are going to be much more moderate than they would have. If the Democrats take the Senate under a Democrat controlled Senate, then the progressives have a little bit more of a say in who those people are.
00:07:25.034 - 00:07:59.430, Speaker B: But if the Senate Banking Committee is controlled by Pat Toomey and Mitch McConnell is running the Senate floor, those guys are not going to approve of somebody that's too left wing and they're going to need to get some Republican votes for those positions. So I think that's good for crypto because the support we've had from Democrats tends to be those that are a little bit more open to business, that are open to private sector innovation and I think that that is actually a winning combination and there's potential to get some great regulators in those key slots.
00:08:00.090 - 00:08:08.330, Speaker A: And so for this next administration, what are the main issues that are at the top of both the blockchain association and hotel PAC's agendas?
00:08:08.750 - 00:09:05.990, Speaker B: So on the defensive side, and this is for the blockchain association, we are very concerned about any unnecessary regulation of self hosted wallets or for transfers into and out of self hosted wallets. There are not specific proposals out there on that right now. But because FADF has highlighted this and because what we've been hearing out of some of the senior folks from treasury, we think that this is going to be an issue that we have to watch like a hawk because it goes at the core of what crypto is. And so being ready to be on the defense for that is really important. And we're working on a report right now that we hope to get out the door in a couple of weeks on that issue. I also think securities law clarity continues to be an issue that we would like to have addressed. I don't think it's as urgent as it was when we spoke, I guess what was that a year and a half ago on this subject?
00:09:06.070 - 00:09:07.100, Speaker A: Something like that.
00:09:08.030 - 00:10:14.222, Speaker B: Time flies. But that is something that I think finding a pathway for projects to raise money on the front end, to give them a period of time like Hester Purse has proposed and then to be able to go and freely trade that token as a commodity is still a really important issue that needs to be addressed. And so that's on our list. There's been a lot of activity on Stablecoins. I think that's good for the industry, but more importantly, that is what policymakers are interested in right now and part of that is driven by China and CBDCs. And I think getting an appropriate Fiat backed stablecoin policy in place is going to be important and we've already seen some good steps by the OCC on that front and then I do think there are some outstanding tax policy issues that need to be addressed and so those would be maybe our top four there's. Also, Europe right now is doing quite a bit with spot market regulation, so the US may decide to jump in on that.
00:10:14.222 - 00:10:52.720, Speaker B: And what we saw with the Digital Commodity Exchange Act a couple months ago is that there are starting to be some ideas about how to do that here. So there's definitely a lot going on and a lot of those decisions in the next couple of years I think are going to be regulator level decisions. But Congress is still a useful tool because they can put pressure on the regulators, they can signal to the regulators what they would want and what they would do. And so I don't anticipate getting a new bill signed into law, but I do anticipate getting some great bills introduced and debated and hopefully that will influence action at the regulatory level.
00:10:54.130 - 00:11:13.154, Speaker A: So fascinating and there's so much to unpack there. But first we'll take a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible. Crypto.com, the crypto super app that lets you buy, earn and spend crypto all in one place. Earn up to 8.5% per year on your BTC. Download the Crypto.com
00:11:13.154 - 00:11:35.270, Speaker A: app now to see the interest rates you could be earning on BTC and more than 20 other coins. Once in the app, you can apply for the Crypto.com Metal card which pays you up to 8% cash back instantly. Reserve years now in the crypto.com app. Back to my conversation with Kristen Smith. So you mentioned that Stablecoins is pretty much at the top of the regulator's agenda.
00:11:35.270 - 00:11:38.700, Speaker A: Why would you say that and what exactly are they looking to do there?
00:11:39.230 - 00:13:10.714, Speaker B: I think that it's at the top of their agenda because it's something that they can understand, which is when you look at the universe of what you can do with crypto networks, minting a digital dollar on a blockchain is something they can wrap their heads around. It is really difficult to go in and talk about Orchid being a decentralized VPN or Filecoin being a decentralized storage system. I mean, there are just so many different pieces there that they aren't able to fully wrap their heads around it. But I think because there's so much attention to what's happening in China, I think because of John Carlo's initiative on the digital dollar project is sort of forcing some of these conversations that when we look at sort of the pure crypto world. I think having something like USDC is a really good sort of private sector driven effort to get all of the benefits that we would have with the CBDC. But that's available here and now and is starting to be more widely adopted for different uses. And so I think for us we've been able to pivot the CBDC conversation into a conversation about stablecoins and getting the right framework around there because the reality is the Fed takes a really long time to do things.
00:13:10.714 - 00:13:32.430, Speaker B: If you look at their faster payments initiative, their Fed Now program that's been years in the making and isn't done yet. And so I think if we can use American values and the American way of private sector innovation to get to some of the same ends, that we can still keep the dollar strong and be competitive with China.
00:13:33.750 - 00:14:06.060, Speaker A: And just to go back to the Senate question, I do think you're right. Probably we will end up with a Republican controlled Senate. However, at the moment it does look pretty likely that we'll end up in two runoff elections in January and so those two could potentially change the control of the Senate to the Democrats. And I just wondered if you thought that that would change much of the agenda that you mentioned the regulators or Congress is interested in at the moment.
00:14:06.670 - 00:14:54.920, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I do think it will change. I mean, I think if the Dems take the Senate then we may have less friendly regulators in key positions. Not necessarily, but the ODS of getting somebody who is more progressive in those spots doesn't necessarily hurt us. But there's a higher likelihood that it does. And in terms of the legislation that Congress could consider is going to be much more significant. I mean, I think that they will have a pretty strong agenda that could include getting more people on the Supreme Court, getting new states in seats in the Senate, first on their list.
00:14:55.710 - 00:15:01.818, Speaker A: Okay, I meant the crypto agenda. But you feel like basically their attention will just be elsewhere.
00:15:01.994 - 00:16:09.570, Speaker B: Yeah, I think their attention will be elsewhere. Now we do see some proposals that are sort of coming up in the House. Rashida Tlaib's office is looking at a bill that I think is well intended but at the moment as defined would really limit the type of entity who could issue a dollar back. Stablecoin, something like that would not be good for crypto, at least in its current form. And so what we don't want are these ideas that are sort of maybe driven by modern monetary theory and sort of the taking banking and making it more public I think is going to have ramifications for crypto as well. But I don't think that's going to be the top thing on our list and I don't think that's something that can happen in two that I think that crypto will be much lower down the agenda item the agenda. But if something does go, we don't have the ability to stop it like we would with a Republican Senate.
00:16:10.390 - 00:16:30.200, Speaker A: And there is one new senator who is a fan of Bitcoins, or at least one new one. There might be others. Cynthia Loomis from Wyoming apparently is, I guess the first senator to own Bitcoin. I did see some people tweeting, which I also thought like, oh, we thought that Kelly Leffler would have some.
00:16:33.770 - 00:17:42.698, Speaker B: No, I think Cynthia Lombis is fantastic. I actually haven't spoken with her in a long time, but she was the congresswoman from Wyoming when I worked for the lone congresswoman or congressman from Montana. And so on occasion our offices would get together and she would come over with what she called a Wyoming five pack, which was basically a six pack of beer with one missing to bring it to the congressman I worked for. So she is down to earth, she is really smart and she is a huge fan of Bitcoin and having somebody like that in the senate is great. I'm eager to see what committee assignments she would know. Sometimes states like Wyoming are interested in the agriculture committee, which would be great because the agriculture committee has jurisdiction over the CFTC. And so there are a lot of good things we could work with her there on if she goes to the finance Committee, which typically freshmen don't get assigned to the finance committee, that's kind of an A level committee, but that would have jurisdiction over tax policy and then the Senate banking committee.
00:17:42.698 - 00:17:58.920, Speaker B: Wyoming is very innovative on that front and that might be a desirable position for her as well. So senators typically get anywhere between three and five committees and so I'm super eager to see where she lands because I've got a lot of ideas for her when she shows up.
00:17:59.850 - 00:18:19.100, Speaker A: And recently we have seen some antitrust action from congress such as with Google. And I wondered do legislators have an awareness of how something like web3 could potentially address these monopoly type issues or do they tend to lump crypto in with big tech?
00:18:19.890 - 00:19:25.438, Speaker B: They don't lump crypto in with big tech. But there is still a disconnect between seeing crypto as sort of a solution to big tech. Early on in particular, this was kind of the core of our messaging was that hey, crypto is going to come along and it's going to fix everything you hate about the Internet. Where we started to run into problems was with Libra because when Facebook came in all of a sudden big tech was affiliated with crypto and we I think, did a pretty good job of separating the two. But I think there's still some confusion on how we could have these crypto networks that are these sort of organic competitors to what we see in that space that maybe treat privacy differently than big tech does that are more secure. I mean there are a lot of wonderful sort of theoretical or not theoretical in the case of filecoin alternatives to big tech. But there is a disconnect.
00:19:25.438 - 00:20:06.160, Speaker B: Macon del Rahim, who is the man in charge of antitrust policy at DOJ gave a speech on it recently and I think he is starting to see that there are some opportunities there. But this kind of goes back to our earlier conversation. Most members of Congress and maybe sort of average regulators aren't yet wrapping their head around that piece of it. It's just a little bit too, it requires a little bit too much imagination and too much background for them to make that connection. But I think that over time that will start to shift and we can see crypto as part as a solution and not a problem.
00:20:07.250 - 00:20:54.830, Speaker A: The crypto industry also maybe is not even fully aligned with itself or within itself about how to approach compliance and regulation. For instance, after Binance US joined the Blockchain association, Coinbase left and Forbes recently wrote an article saying that perhaps Binance US might have been set up as a decoy for US regulators. And of course, as I'm sure you're well aware, coinbase has this long standing reputation for being one of the most compliant exchanges. Although of course it also does push back against overreach, such as when the IRS tried to make a broad request on all its users'transactions over a three year period. But I wondered what are the main divisive issues within the crypto industry that need to be resolved when it comes to how it approaches regulators?
00:20:55.250 - 00:21:29.240, Speaker B: Yeah, no that's a great question. I think that for most companies operating in the US. That at least the ones that I have dealt with in my universe, they do want to comply. And part of why they work with the Blockchain association is they want to get more clarity on when they need to comply. Right. I mean I think that if you don't want to deal with that, you don't operate in the US. Which is I think what most people do.
00:21:29.240 - 00:22:40.062, Speaker B: It's really hard to get all the key people in a room, I'll put it that way. I think that there are a lot of rivalries that whether it be primarily, I think with the exchanges, but there are competitive rivalries that are getting in the way of having substantive policy conversations. I think that's starting to shift. I think that as some of these companies are building out their teams and bringing in sort of seasoned general counsels, there's this understanding that they're going to have to work together. I don't think it's as closely coordinated as it needs to be to win. And the reality is we're not going to get anything super positive until there is agreement on a strategy. And whether that be hey, we all want to be regulated as banks under some sort of special bank charter or we want to expand the CFTC jurisdiction to play a greater role or we need to create a self regulatory organization that is kind know, running point on regulating the space.
00:22:40.062 - 00:23:27.040, Speaker B: I think there's still disagreement on that. But I'm hopeful in the months ahead that we can get the key. People sitting know they don't have to be a member of the Blockchain association to do this. So I'm always accepting applications for new members for me to pass along to the board because the board decides membership, not me. But I think that it's really important to work together because we are so small compared to most industries that are operating in Washington that the nuances of the rivalries are just really lost on those policymakers. They just want to see kind of a unified position and so it's incumbent upon us to develop that and push that forward so we still have a ways to go on that.
00:23:27.650 - 00:23:44.270, Speaker A: And last question with the news about PayPal integrating cryptocurrencies, there's been increased noise about the need for a de minimis tax exemption and I wondered if that was something that the Blockchain Association or Hodlpac is advocating for and what you thought the ODS were that such a thing would be passed.
00:23:44.430 - 00:24:27.102, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I think that is something that the Blockchain Association supports. We got legislation worked very closely with Coin Center to get that introduced last year. I think that it looks like Dave Schweiger is probably going to get reelected. Who's the lead Republican on that bill and the lead Democrat, Susan Del Venet was also elected. So I think getting that reintroduced is important. The problem with tax policy is it tends to get done in packages and so there needs to be some sort of tax bill moving to attach something like that to it. Would also be helpful to get something introduced on the Senate side so that there's kind of agreement between both chambers when they get to negotiations around a tax package.
00:24:27.102 - 00:25:13.860, Speaker B: So there's more groundwork to be done there. I think it's an important step. I think there's some other tax issues that need to be addressed as well around crypto lending, around treatment of staking rewards and those are other issues that we're going to be looking at. And from the Hodlpack perspective, what's the beauty of holdlpack is those are individuals and so they can support and vote for champions in Congress or candidates that have different positions on different issues. So Hodlpack itself doesn't take positions, but the contributions will go towards those candidates that have favorable positions. So it's very much a very open sort of community governed process there.
00:25:14.230 - 00:25:20.930, Speaker A: Okay, interesting. Maybe it's something where you guys could use like quadratic voting to decide.
00:25:21.270 - 00:26:22.278, Speaker B: We do use quadratic voting actually. Yeah, I didn't know what that was until recently, but yeah, we actually on Hodlpack. We just held our first community ballot right before the election. And people who wanted to participate in determining where the contributions would go would do so by using Hodl votes, which you would receive a token, and then you would vote with their tokens. And few people in the DC world had to download MetaMask wallets to participate for the first time, but there was a lot of cool experimentation going around there. But the idea being that most political action committees have a committee or a single person that sort of determines, okay, we're going to support these people and give them contributions. And holdlepack is really opening that up to kind of a community vote, which is really wow.
00:26:22.364 - 00:26:43.502, Speaker A: Wow. I love it. I love it that you guys are already using this technology in really interesting ways. All right, well, we will see what happens with the election. Yes, I'm sure we'll have you back again to talk about how it's going once whatever the changeover is, whatever that is.
00:26:43.636 - 00:26:58.980, Speaker B: Yeah, I definitely think there are definitely going to be some changes. I think we have some good opportunities and I think we're in a position to play defense when we need to play defense. So I think 2021 and 2022 are going to be exciting years for crypto policy.
00:26:59.510 - 00:27:03.090, Speaker A: Great, well, thank you so much for coming on Unconfirmed.
00:27:03.590 - 00:27:04.850, Speaker B: Thanks, Laura.
00:27:05.210 - 00:27:48.750, Speaker A: Don't forget, next up is the weekly news recap. Thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap. First headline $1 billion in Silk Road bitcoin seized by the US. On Tuesday. 69,369 bitcoins worth almost $1 billion had been moved out of a wallet associated with a Silk Road marketplace, sparking speculation around who might be behind the activity. The wallet had held until the move, the fourth highest balance of bitcoin on any address. That mystery was solved Thursday when the Department of justice announced what they are calling, quote, the largest seizure of cryptocurrency in the history of the agency.
00:27:48.750 - 00:28:10.380, Speaker A: DOJ has seized and is seeking forfeiture of 69,370 bitcoins and an equal number of bitcoin gold, bitcoin SV and bitcoin cash. And the bitcoins had been allegedly hacked from the Silk Road by a person they referred to as Individual X, who has now signed a consent and agreement to forfeiture with the US. Attorney's Office.
00:28:11.310 - 00:28:11.722, Speaker B: US.
00:28:11.776 - 00:29:10.534, Speaker A: Attorney David Anderson said in a statement that after the prosecution of Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht in 2015, a billion dollar question remained regarding what had happened to the market's stash of money. Anderson said, quote, Today's forfeiture complaint answers this open question, at least in part. $1 billion of these criminal proceeds are now in the United States possession. Next headline election News Roundup while all eyes were on the US presidential election this week, the crypto and blockchain industry participated in its own way. For the first time in history, the Associated Press has been posting election results on the Ethereum and Neo's blockchains. The AP is also using the blockchains in its own application programming interface, or API, which enables anyone wanting to view official AP results to verify the accuracy by calling up the blockchain data. The AP voting data has also been published to Everopedia, a blockchain based version of Wikipedia built using chainlink.
00:29:10.534 - 00:30:21.762, Speaker A: The AP's use of these networks is the most extensive use of blockchain technology in elections to date. Prediction markets also made waves this election with estimates that crypto exchange FTX would collect as much as $1 million in fees from election betting on its platform. Both FTX and Polymarket offered traders the opportunity to place bets on the winner of the presidential election, and volumes surged in these markets leading up to election day. In other FTX related election news, founder Sam Bankman Fried is counted among the top donors to Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, having contributed more than $5 million to the former vice president's campaign. Finally, as voters across the US prepared to cast ballots, CME Group's bitcoin futures market hit a record, with overnight trading on election eve reaching 6700, the equivalent of 33 500 bitcoin in value. The number of large reportable interest holders throughout October also increased 20% leading up to election night. The discussion around blockchains and elections hasn't stopped there, though.
00:30:21.762 - 00:31:23.880, Speaker A: Finance CEO Changpeng Zhao posted on Twitter that a blockchain based mobile voting app could have prevented the days of vote counting. Americans have been enduring vitalik. Buterin the creator of Ethereum chimed in that although, quote, the technical challenges around a secure cryptographic voting system are significant, the potential is there for such a system to one day be implemented. In my personal opinion, the main issues here are of course, identity and security, and I'm pretty sure those will not be resolved as CZ implied they would be within four years. Next Headline Bitcoin flirts with 15K On Thursday, bitcoin surpassed $15,000 for the first time since January 2018, a symbolic milestone for bitcoin bulls who have been rallying since October. Activity on the bitcoin blockchain had been steadily increasing since midoctober. In addition to greater network activity, October was a big month for bitcoin options, with open interest reaching an alltime high.
00:31:23.880 - 00:32:29.078, Speaker A: Next headline ethereum 20 Phase Zero launch is imminent. In preparation for the arrival of Ethereum 20, the deposit address for ETH Two was released on Wednesday. The address allows future Staking participants to prepare their funds for the beacon chain, aka the Phase Zero launch of Ethereum 20. According to a blog post from the Ethereum Foundation, the earliest potential date for ETH Two's genesis is December 1, depending on how soon the required amount of ETH is deposited by staking participants. Next Headline PayPal CEO says demand was almost triple expectations during its Q Three earnings call. PayPal CEO Daniel Schulman discussed the company's plans around crypto, saying, quote this is just the beginning of the opportunities we see as we work hand in hand with regulators to accept new forms of digital currencies. Although crypto functionality is only available to 10% of PayPal customers, the waiting list demand has been two to three times what the company expected.
