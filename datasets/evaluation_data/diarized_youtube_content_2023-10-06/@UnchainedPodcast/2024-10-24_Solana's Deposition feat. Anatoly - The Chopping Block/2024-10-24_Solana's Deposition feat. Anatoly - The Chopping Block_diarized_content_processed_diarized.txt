00:00:00.280 - 00:00:10.489, Speaker A: If you look back at the history of Solana, it was very not obvious that Solana was going to have a second act. Right. Like most chains don't have a second act. Like they're in the spotlight for a period of time.
00:00:10.617 - 00:00:12.125, Speaker B: Wasn't to me at all.
00:00:13.305 - 00:00:13.897, Speaker A: What's that?
00:00:13.961 - 00:00:31.419, Speaker B: It wasn't obvious. I mean, in a way, we like, it made no sense to me why it came back, but it also. No, there was no doubt in my mind that we were going to survive. In some weird way, I just didn't know it was going to be, like, relevant. As relevant as it is today.
00:00:31.507 - 00:00:32.403, Speaker C: Not a dividend.
00:00:32.499 - 00:00:33.691, Speaker D: It's a tale of two quant.
00:00:33.763 - 00:00:36.379, Speaker A: Now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet.
00:00:36.467 - 00:00:38.203, Speaker C: Generally speaking, airdrops are kind of pointless.
00:00:38.259 - 00:00:56.983, Speaker A: Anyways, I named trading firms who were very involved. Defi protocols are the antidote to this problem. Hello, everybody. Welcome to the chopping block. Every couple of weeks, the four of us get together and give the industry insider's perspective on the crypto topics of the day. So, quick intros. First we got Tom the Defi Maven and Master of memes.
00:00:57.119 - 00:00:58.075, Speaker C: Hello, everyone.
00:00:58.735 - 00:01:02.035, Speaker A: Next we've got Tarun the Gigabrain and Grand Poobah at Gauntlet.
00:01:02.375 - 00:01:03.195, Speaker D: Yo.
00:01:04.495 - 00:01:29.531, Speaker A: And then, special guest today, we have Anatoly, the Czar of Solana. Welcome back, Anatoly. Hey, if you remember, that was actually your title the first time that you were on the show. So I want to bring that back. And I mustif the head hype man at Dragonfly, we are early stage investors in crypto. But I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice, legal advice, or even life Advice. Please see ChoppingBlock XYZ for more disclosures.
00:01:29.531 - 00:01:56.959, Speaker A: So I put out a call about this episode because I wanted to see what people wanted us to ask you because you were actually on the show two years ago. Two years ago, of course, was a very different world. Two years ago, if you remember, this was in the pre FTX collapse era. It was like summer of summer of summer of 2022. This was like, I think, before Luna collapsed. So it was still. We were all in our collective childhoods as an industry.
00:01:56.959 - 00:02:30.643, Speaker A: And that was the time when, you know, Solana was falling over. There was a lot of stability issues. There was still, you know, there was a big conversation about fee markets, of whether it makes sense to finally capitulate and start adding fees on Solana. And so I was listening back to that episode before coming here to this one, because a lot of people, when I asked Them. Hey, what should we talk about with Anatoly? I kind of thought people would be like, oh, you know, talk about the Solana phone. Let's talk about, you know, meme coins or something. Most of what people want us to talk about is they want us to grill you.
00:02:30.643 - 00:02:43.691, Speaker A: And so there's a. There's a tweet by Austin, Austin Federa that said, use this opportunity as a deposition. I'm tired of Solana friendly episodes. Treat him as a witness and make your hardest case against Solana.
00:02:43.883 - 00:02:45.135, Speaker B: Let's do it.
00:02:45.665 - 00:02:52.641, Speaker A: Should. Okay. Thoughts? I mean, I don't know. I don't know. Tom and Tarun, I feel like. So let me. Let me give a little bit of context.
00:02:52.641 - 00:03:20.681, Speaker A: Let me give a little bit of context because this has been kind of a recurring theme on this. On this show. So back in 22, we had a number of episodes that were very critical of Solana. I remember there was one episode in early 22 where I think, like, the key excerpt from the show is where I compared Solana like the Solana mempool and not mempool, whatever transaction market as akin to breadlines, where people were just sitting around waiting, trying to get through, and they were.
00:03:20.713 - 00:03:22.125, Speaker B: That stuck in my head.
00:03:22.425 - 00:03:23.393, Speaker A: Did it really?
00:03:23.529 - 00:03:24.245, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:03:25.465 - 00:03:28.009, Speaker C: So there's some, like, post Soviet trauma kind of thing.
00:03:28.137 - 00:03:33.845, Speaker B: Yeah. And that had impact on the design decision. Really, what happened later.
00:03:34.505 - 00:03:45.355, Speaker A: No kidding. That. I find that very surprising. Okay. But that was. That was like. That was like a zinger that came from the show when Solana was having trouble with, like, managing all the defi activity that was happening in.
00:03:45.355 - 00:04:07.995, Speaker A: In lieu of having a fee market. And so we had. We had a number of shows where we criticize. You know, so let me. Let me run through this because I. This is a litany that I've recounted once before on the show when Mert was here. So what did we criticize Salon about before? One, that Solana insisted on having no fee markets for a very long time until it was basically forced to capitulate because of the rise of Defi.
00:04:07.995 - 00:04:36.611, Speaker A: Obviously there are all the critiques about sbf, ftx, kind of being this sort of vassal chain of an exchange. Obviously, that was not very long lived at the time. Like in 22, there was a weak culture of open source on Solana. Very few of the top projects in Solana were open source. It was also hard to be open source in Solana because even if your source was open, you couldn't actually verify that the builds on Solana were equivalent to the open source code. Because there were non deterministic builds. That is very different today.
00:04:36.611 - 00:05:12.405, Speaker A: But at the time you couldn't really tell what you were interacting with. You couldn't even see the code on Block Explorers. On Solana at that time, builder experience was pretty painful. Obviously there was all the stability issues. There were a lot of people, including us, critiqued the performance claims of Solana, of talking about transactions as equivalent to vote transactions, which normally are considered more kind of metadata within most other blockchains. So those are mostly critiques that I made of solana back in 2022 today. Now, you know, I think from Austin's perspective it's like, okay, now we have this Mickey Mouse kind of a positive attitude about Solana.
00:05:12.405 - 00:05:38.189, Speaker A: I think a large reason for that is that all of those criticisms are no longer things that I critique Solana about because they're all changed. Literally every single one of those things has really significantly improved. Not all of them 100%, but pretty much every single one is very different than what it was in 2022. And that's part and parcel of why I don't consider myself to be any more a critic of Solana the way that I was in 22. I think Solana has really come a long way.
00:05:38.237 - 00:05:50.765, Speaker B: That worries me. Why does that worry you? Our secret is that we absorb the negative feedback. We internalize it. Not just me, but everyone in the ecosystem. We love the negative feedback.
00:05:50.845 - 00:05:53.765, Speaker D: I had seen Quick show some other L1 right now.
00:05:53.845 - 00:06:20.323, Speaker B: Yeah, things change and they improve. And this is how people iterate. We called it fire driven development. Is that sometimes if you overthink and over design a solution, it's like tightening. I don't know if you ever change a tire, you don't want to tighten all the bolts at the same time. You tighten one bolt, it screws it up. So kind of leave it open to failure to see how it's going to fail.
00:06:20.323 - 00:06:22.483, Speaker B: And then you look at it and change it.
00:06:22.579 - 00:06:24.907, Speaker D: Blockchains are tires. You heard it here first.
00:06:25.051 - 00:07:10.857, Speaker B: Building a complex system is hard because you just don't know all the ways it's going to be used, all the ways it's going to fail. And if you like, the fee markets is a great example. We didn't have a solution for fee markets that wasn't a copy of Ethereum's. And we saw the problems there and we're like, we don't want the same problems because you have a global fee spike, then all this parallelism is useless. It is literally, what the hell's the point? Might as well, build L2s or whatever, right? So sometimes, like, doing the wrong thing at the right time is like, really, really important in the journey of product iteration. If you can afford it. If you, if you do the really, really wrong thing, you have a safety violation or stuff like that, then that's bad and that could be catastrophic.
00:07:10.857 - 00:07:19.345, Speaker B: So you kind of. You need to know what, what things are, like, what kind of failures are survivable and you can learn from them.
00:07:19.725 - 00:07:41.461, Speaker A: And it's really hard to know in advance. Right. On some level, you kind of have to get lucky that your failures are forgivable failures. And on some level, if you look back at the history of Solana, it was very not obvious that Solana was going to have a second act. Right. Like, most chains don't have a second act, like they're in the spotlight for a period of time. What's that?
00:07:41.613 - 00:08:01.325, Speaker B: It wasn't obvious. I mean, in a way, we, like, it made no sense to me why it came back, but it also. No, there was no doubt in my mind that we were going to survive in some weird way, because I just didn't know it was going to be as relevant as it is today.
00:08:01.485 - 00:08:25.407, Speaker A: Yeah. And I guess the thing is, if you look at the way that Solana figured itself, right, originally, I remember the story you also used to tell about Solana is that Solana is supposed to be the NASDAQ of blockchains. And if you take that North Star seriously, okay, Salon is a NASDAQ of blockchains. That means obviously that one is going to be used primarily for, by the way, financial activity.
00:08:25.471 - 00:08:28.075, Speaker D: NASDAQ on the blockchain, not NASDAQ.
00:08:31.335 - 00:08:46.603, Speaker A: Speed. All of us got it wrong. Okay, fine. NASDAQ of blockchain speed. Um, so of course, the implication of the NASDAQ is that one, it's going to be, you know, very high throughput, Two, it's going to be primarily financial activity happening on. On. On Solana.
00:08:46.603 - 00:09:05.887, Speaker A: And three, it's going to be serious financial activity happening on Solana. Right. Like, that's. All three of those things are implied by that framing. Right. Instead, Solana became first kind of a. You know, first it became serum, which was the closest thing to like, okay, this, this kind of sounds like what you mean by NASDAQ on the blockchain.
00:09:05.887 - 00:09:47.801, Speaker A: Um, but then we went from serum to then, okay, the dominant application on Solana is NFTs and NFT trading, which is like, has none of those properties, doesn't really need to be super fast, isn't really very serious. Doesn't. Doesn't you know it. It has a. Obviously has a flippancy relative to NASDAQ that you, you probably weren't expecting when you were going and building the system. And then now the dominant application on Solana is meme coin trading. And most of the meme coin trading is not happening on Order Book Dexs, it's happening on Amex, which is also like the cheap or the peak state contention, like exactly the wrong way to build the Nasdaq relative to like.
00:09:47.801 - 00:09:54.009, Speaker A: I remember the conversations having with you, I think it was on the previous show where you're talking about like, yeah, you don't want that. You don't want.
00:09:54.097 - 00:09:54.577, Speaker D: No, no.
00:09:54.641 - 00:09:57.143, Speaker A: They are horrible at state contention, but.
00:09:57.329 - 00:10:18.291, Speaker D: There'S state contention if they're the same assets. The fact that you're adding new assets means that you're creating. You have to be very clear about that. The state contention for AMM is if you're going for the same asset. But here it's like, I'm creating new assets all the time. That fact that the asset creation rate is faster than the contention rate is very important.
00:10:18.443 - 00:10:20.003, Speaker B: Yeah, it is bizarre.
00:10:20.179 - 00:10:23.811, Speaker A: So how do you think about this NASDAQ of blockchain thing, given how Solana has evolved?
00:10:23.963 - 00:10:59.961, Speaker B: Like, again, the we like. I would wish to say that Labs or anyone even like that worked for me was even remotely responsible for any of this. We just unblocked founders. We had no idea what they were building. And the way that you unblock them is like price and features are the two main things and then content. But like, content is what the founders create, some meme coins or whatever. But like people at Labs or whatever or Helios, they see a customer that's trying to do something and it's too expensive or takes too long or whatever, and they go fix it.
00:10:59.961 - 00:11:34.017, Speaker B: And once they fix it, that problem scales out and it kind of blows up. And what people want to do is trade meme coins. They want to trade digital assets, they want to have fun. A lot of this stuff is basically just activity that's fun. I see it as no different than loot boxes and iOS. Like you have $100 billion gaming market that iOS services that take a 30% fee of that, that's the vast majority of iOS revenue is from those kinds of apps. The serious apps that people think about that Apple is indispensable for is Uber or whatever.
00:11:34.017 - 00:12:04.097, Speaker B: Because that's the magic that I have a logistics pipeline created in the moment's notice from any point around the world. To me Anywhere I am that. But, like, Apple takes like, what, 2% cut of that fee or something if people use Apple pay? So it's weird. The joke that I make is that the number of rational markets is countable, but the number of irrational markets is uncountable. So eventually the.
00:12:04.161 - 00:12:08.009, Speaker D: This is like your fifth diagonalization joke this month, buddy.
00:12:08.177 - 00:12:30.105, Speaker B: That side is going to be bigger in size than the rational size. It's just inevitable. So, like, here we are. Also, I like to remind myself that when Steve Jobs shipped iOS in the app Store, he had to look at the top 10 list and see the fart apps in this beautiful thing that he built and be like, okay, this is what we're shipping with.
00:12:31.845 - 00:13:10.379, Speaker C: I think it's actually a very good sign for platforms when they take on a life that was not predicted by their creator. Honestly, if you look at a lot of the ideas and apps that Vitalik gets excited about, they're kind of crap. It's like did shit or Reflexer and just kind of useless garbage or they're bad product ideas versus the stuff that people actually use. Or Instagram, actually, when it started to get really big, it was not latte art pictures, it was memes and people posting their marketplaces and the shit they were selling on Instagram. And, you know, it's like, okay, this is not what it was really designed to do, but people are sort of hacking it to do the thing that they wanted to do that the founders didn't really imagine.
00:13:10.507 - 00:13:53.357, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, the other thing that was interesting is I was like reading all these. There's kind of an interesting divide that I've noticed between sort of like Ethereum, the Ethereum world, and Solana worlds, which is in the Ethereum world, everyone says it's like 1975 for the Internet. In the Solana world, everyone says the 90s because meme coins are like porn taking up all the bandwidth we had to build the fiber to make the porn faster, which I think is the same as having to have enough capacity to have more meme coins. As weird as that. That's the same as the fart app. Right? The porn and fart app thing are the same.
00:13:53.421 - 00:14:39.097, Speaker B: Ebaum's world. This is like, I don't know if somebody's going to figure out how to take Ebam's world and turn it into YouTube. This is the stage that I feel cryptos in. But the founders that I talk to that are in that space, like, are making a lot of money in revenue, but they have no intention of, like, quitting and they have big dreams. Like they want to build like next gen financial institutions for zoomers and the next generation. They feel like this is a way for them to go and onboard those users and build those things. So like, I mean that, that's great, right? Like it's hard to, yeah, hard to predict how that stuff is going to play out.
00:14:39.201 - 00:14:47.953, Speaker A: But if you. Okay, so if you think of this as Ebaum's world, it sounds like you are implying that this is a transitional phase in Solana's journey.
00:14:48.089 - 00:14:50.085, Speaker B: But eBam's world never went away.
00:14:50.425 - 00:15:05.227, Speaker A: It did, but it stopped being the cultural center. Right. Like YouTube and Instagram and all these things sort of became these, these lodestones of how Internet culture was formed. Do you think the same thing is going to happen to meme coins with respect to Solana?
00:15:05.411 - 00:16:00.443, Speaker B: I think. Well, I'm very bullish on crypto so I think there will be the next trillion dollar networks or whatever protocols will be crypto based or not going to be corporations or at least I think there will be some that are crypto based and those just by sheer scale have to serve a very large audience. And that's mid by definition, right? Just by the size of it. I don't think the weird stuff is going to go away, but I think you're going to start getting into, I don't know, all the ideas that we try. It's going to be loyalty points or whatever. None of that stuff is penned out yet, but people are trying it and I think they're just a little too early. My guess is that within 5, 10 years every business in the world has some service that can manage their wallet and create assets and consume assets.
00:16:00.443 - 00:16:51.329, Speaker B: They're going to start with these experiments and they expect all their customers to have wallets and stuff like that. It'll just become part of their day to day business activity and then we'll see that more mid level content where yeah, I'm getting taco NFTs from taco bell and I'm converting them but it's loyalty points. A little bit more flare or whatever, but we'll see like I think the space will mature and get bigger simply as crypto gets bigger. I honestly don't think there's going to be a ton of new protocols or a ton of new asset types. I think we've probably discovered 95% of them. NFTs and coin and tokens cover the vast majority of things you can do. And then AMMs or whatever, all the different markets for them already exist.
00:16:51.329 - 00:16:56.393, Speaker B: All the ways you can remix them already exist. Like, it's all been kind of proven out.
00:16:56.569 - 00:17:09.105, Speaker D: I will say that the way you said that reminds me of the famous patent officer in the 19th century who said like, everything useful has already been invented. So that's a big statement to make there.
00:17:09.225 - 00:17:11.201, Speaker C: 10 megabytes is enough for everyone.
00:17:11.393 - 00:17:22.383, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. Paul Krugman talking about the Internet and like, oh, you can't do anything with the Internet. You can do it. A fax machine. I don't know. I don't know. That history of technology bodes well on people saying like, yeah, we've discovered everything.
00:17:22.383 - 00:17:26.279, Speaker A: It's pretty much done. Pack it in, we'll see.
00:17:26.367 - 00:17:29.055, Speaker B: We haven't discovered. Okay, fair enough.
00:17:29.215 - 00:17:30.479, Speaker C: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
00:17:30.647 - 00:17:34.167, Speaker D: We haven't done our inquisition as you guys are being.
00:17:34.231 - 00:17:49.485, Speaker A: We're in the process. We're in the process. We're in the process. Okay, okay. So speaking of scaling on the last show, you claimed that. So this is 2022. 2022, you claimed that you did not think of the Ethereum or the EVM ecosystem as competitors.
00:17:49.485 - 00:17:58.665, Speaker A: You thought your only competitors were aptos and sui. Okay, fast forward today, two years later, would you revise that statement or would you say that's still correct?
00:17:58.785 - 00:18:29.163, Speaker B: Base is probably the closest competitor. Now I would say when looking at activity, I think basically like my how I break this problem down is you can compete on, you can have like your killer thing. Components of PMF as price, features or content. And Ethereum's like was weakness was price and Solana had a killer price that just Ethereum could never get to. So on price, there was a killer.
00:18:29.219 - 00:18:30.643, Speaker A: Price, meaning transaction fees.
00:18:30.739 - 00:19:07.833, Speaker B: Yeah, just fees to users and then feature set. I think it's arguable which has better feature set. But I think honestly just the integration between a standard. There's weird things that we didn't intentionally create but happen to have been huge advantages in SVM that ended up being, I think, partly killer features. And you can kind of deal with them and I think the base guys are smart enough to figure it out. So that was part of it. But content is what Ethereum had the huge advantage in because they have all these legacy.
00:19:07.833 - 00:19:27.907, Speaker B: They don't want to say legacy, all these great OG assets that people want to trade with network effects that you cannot move to Solana and there's no way you can do that to give the same effects. So that network effect is the content that was the killer thing. And when you have that, you can increase price to as far as the market.
00:19:28.011 - 00:19:31.691, Speaker A: When you say content, you don't mean like social media content, you mean like assets?
00:19:31.843 - 00:20:03.649, Speaker B: Yeah, stuff for people to do. Right. Like what is unique about Ethereum is the assets issued there. And I think now that's shifting over somewhat to Solana 1 meme coins or new content being created every day. We saw that with NFTs, even if the Solana NFTs didn't hit the same valuation, it's just the activity was astronomical. Like in terms of users, stuff like that. Base I think is the biggest competitor that I think of to the Solana ecosystem.
00:20:03.649 - 00:20:42.515, Speaker B: And I honestly do look at the other alternative L1s because the disadvantage that the Ethereum ecosystem still has is they're like everyone uses Metamask. You can't move as fast in feature set and stuff like that. You're kind of like moving your features are moving as fast as the slowest part of the standard's body, which is not great. Right. I think that generally tends to be while an advantage because you can have more scale because everyone's in the same standard. You're kind of losing a bit on features and stuff.
00:20:42.595 - 00:20:48.683, Speaker A: So okay, so you think of Base as being the biggest competitor. Base of course is a roll up sponsored by Coinbase or launched by Coinbase.
00:20:48.699 - 00:20:52.455, Speaker B: Or whatever GUI and Aptos, how they call it also are doing really well.
00:20:52.755 - 00:20:54.527, Speaker A: They're on the R, they've cut up.
00:20:54.551 - 00:21:26.413, Speaker B: On features and price. Right. Like I don't even if the problem that they have is that Solana had such a huge difference on those from Ethereum, there was a 10 order magnitude improvement. Now the improvements are marginal and not enough to like be the killer part. Right. If you improve Solana's feeds by 100x, you might get some weird use cases that go run there, but they're not the, the major use cases that people care about. And then it's not enough of a differentiator.
00:21:26.509 - 00:21:34.005, Speaker A: Dropping freeze from a fraction of a cent to a fraction of a fraction of a cent is just not economical economically relevant for most use cases.
00:21:34.165 - 00:21:59.495, Speaker B: And there's just some fees like this goes down later to my theory of where value accrual happens in these networks. There's just some fees that you cannot get rid of. And it boils down to database hotspot problem. If you have state contention, somebody has to go first and no matter what you do, that is a fee that somebody pays. Either it's through a backroom deal to a validator or a priority fee.
00:21:59.535 - 00:22:44.539, Speaker A: Right, Right. So okay, comparing yourself to base. Base of course is a roll up and one of the questions actually that MERT posed is what is Solana's moat in a world where every blockchain is fast, scalable and cheap? And I think this connects a little bit with the rise of this new generation of blockchains. So we see things like obviously Aptos and SUI being using the Move vm. You also see the rise of things like Monad, things like Mega Eth, which of course is a roll up and of course Base, which also has very high performance, very low latency because of the sequencer setup. How do you think about how Solana continues to push its edge in a world where the EVMs and the move.
00:22:44.619 - 00:22:53.087, Speaker B: VMs are catching up and even SVMs and Solana forks, Somebody could take the Fire Dancer code, just that code base, and run Solana.
00:22:53.151 - 00:22:54.635, Speaker A: Is there a Solana City?
00:22:55.375 - 00:22:58.623, Speaker B: I think there's a couple that are small.
00:22:58.719 - 00:23:00.635, Speaker A: But are they live?
00:23:01.495 - 00:23:29.045, Speaker B: Yeah, there's one called Xen. Yeah, there's a bunch. There's like a, there's like a long tail of little ones and I think there's some bigger ones in the works. My, my theory there is again, content is like when everything is marginally the same on features and price. YouTube is as good as features and price, as Netflix as TikTok. Content is what starts dominating. And this is where I think incumbents have an advantage like Ethereum.
00:23:29.045 - 00:23:47.035, Speaker B: If, if it could be have parity in features and price, it would just grow through natural growth of like crypto market. But because they kind of gave that up to the L2s, I think this is where the Achilles heel of the Ethereum roadmap.
00:23:47.455 - 00:23:50.215, Speaker A: So you think the Ethereum scaling roadmap was a mistake?
00:23:50.335 - 00:24:34.197, Speaker B: This is the big question. If I was put in charge of the influence in the Ethereum ecosystem and somebody said that you have to beat Bitcoin, I would probably make the same design decisions. If you have to build a world computer, it would make the Solana design decisions. The thing is I don't care about competing with Bitcoin because I can't. I don't think it's an engineering problem. I think it's just a beautiful accident that it exists and let it be. But my engineering skill set throughout my life was into making things faster and lower latency.
00:24:34.197 - 00:24:51.875, Speaker B: So I can understand the world computer, understand how it makes money, I can make it faster. So like that's just the easier path for me personally, like for me to try to go beat Bitcoin, I would have to have like that mind virus of monetary premium. I just don't have it.
00:24:52.175 - 00:24:58.475, Speaker A: Yeah, I like the phrase bitcoin is a beautiful accident. So bitcoin is kind of like the slurf of blockchains.
00:25:01.175 - 00:25:02.995, Speaker D: That'S like anachronistic.
00:25:06.975 - 00:25:09.039, Speaker A: Guys, give me some room for this, give me some room.
00:25:09.167 - 00:25:39.721, Speaker B: Like, if I had to like academically get into it, I'd be like, okay, well, making sure that there's only 21 million. Bitcoin is the primary use case of Bitcoin because this is what scarcity is, its number one thing. So I need the cost to validate scarcity to be as low as possible. So that means the smallest possible chain to do that and push everything else away. Right. So that would be like the engineering path that I would go under. But I'm not a believer in that.
00:25:39.721 - 00:25:54.525, Speaker B: There needs to be another better form of you're only going to get marginally better at solving scarcity questions than Bitcoin. And I'm like, there's nothing to gain there. How am I going to beat Bitcoin by 10x at doing better scarcity?
00:25:54.945 - 00:25:57.125, Speaker A: But isn't that also true for Ethereum then?
00:25:57.905 - 00:26:28.205, Speaker D: I think Bitcoin is like for trans. I think they should analyze. It's like, I think analogy to programming languages because that's like, it's like a cleaner analogy. And I feel like Fortran is like this thing that like sits every time you install any math package. There's 5 million lines Fortran run right like it's there and no one gets rid of it because no one wants to rewrite that shit. And that's like the scarcity thing. Like it's just like there's no, you can't really beat that at its own game.
00:26:28.205 - 00:26:30.677, Speaker D: But no one's like writing new stuff in Fortran.
00:26:30.741 - 00:27:08.969, Speaker B: I can beat Ethereum at latency and throughput and I can be marginally competitive with all the other L2s. As an engineer I can see a path there. So then to me that's like, that's easy. That's almost like. No, it's people. You can hire L7 engineers and they'll go punch out the code and go through Grafana and solve all the problems. To answer Mert's question, there's basically like two long term things that I think are going to happen is that one is once feature and price are marginally the same across all the ecosystems, content is going to matter and then you have incumbent advantage.
00:27:08.969 - 00:27:53.101, Speaker B: And simply the network effects that people talk about in Ethereum now exists in Solana from people that launch products here get benefit from all the other products in the network and those I haven't seen translate between L2s. This is probably again one of the Achilles heels in the Ethereum roadmap is that there is fragmentation that makes it harder for like a meme coin launched on pump to get revenue in Jupe and Radium and for that to benefit all three companies, right? Like you have to move all three of them into the same L2. But then like, how is that marginally better than them all just existing on Salon or launching there? So you kind of run into this.
00:27:53.133 - 00:28:38.965, Speaker A: Okay, so let me push back on this concept because this is only that. I remember in the last episode you also mentioned that one of the foundations of why Solana works and why at that time there was more of a conversation around horizontal scaling versus vertical scaling. And of course Solana is kind of the poster child of vertical scaling. Whereas Ethereum was classically horizontally scaling originally through shards, now through roll ups. So the story for vertical scaling is that, well, with vertical scaling, everything's on the same machine or everything's on the same kind of logical substrate. And therefore you can have atomicity and composability and all this stuff. And here's my claim is that atomicity and composability is overrated.
00:28:38.965 - 00:29:20.995, Speaker A: And over time, what we have found is that there's actually not that much stuff that people do that's like really, really atomic. Right? There's like Flash loans and all the stuff that we imagined in the past that like really needed atomicity and that without that it just wouldn't work. And the reality is that most people, when they're interacting with blockchains, they like click three buttons, you know, like actually there's not that many things. It's just like one button and then everything happens. And if one of those clicking three buttons is like, well, I move from this chain to that chain or I like, you know, grab a lock on this other chain and then do this thing. From a UX perspective, I've become more skeptical of the story that composability atomicity is the killer use case. What's your take?
00:29:21.115 - 00:30:10.665, Speaker B: You're not wrong. I think just a single transaction that can lock a bunch of stuff and execute atomically. It's arbitrage bots that care about this in Jupyter because it can create routes that are very, very efficient. Anytime you add asynchronous costs there, you just can't do these kind of, this kind of routing. So how much that matters, I think is less important than being in the Same computer and literally just the APIs and everything else. Just being so easy for founders to like go do this stuff because like in the early days of Pump or whatever they were literally just moving, using a wallet to move shit from their bonding curve into radium. And to do that between chains would be a major pain in the ass.
00:30:10.665 - 00:30:40.533, Speaker B: And then having users then switch chains and stuff, there's just so much plumbing that you have to solve there that it becomes not the path of least resistance. And being all in one state machine, the path of least resistance. Just go use your next door neighbor. Right. That is literally right there. I think there's a lot to be said there whether that like, because you can, you can do all this stuff even between all ones. Wormhole is good enough.
00:30:40.533 - 00:30:57.709, Speaker B: Like there's. This is what it ends up being. Is that like the bridge going through Ethereum because it's data validating with fraud proofs or ZK is no better than wormhole for the end user. For the vast majority, 99.9999% of the cases. Right.
00:30:57.837 - 00:31:29.545, Speaker C: What do you think of than the relationship between apps and chains? Because the other sort of recurring topic is sort of like audience capture or platform risk for applications where it's like yeah, you get big enough and you spin off and you do your own chain. And it's like people who are trading on pump, it's like, okay, they actually think they're trading on Phantom or Photon or Trojan. They don't know that they're on Solana on this thing. It's just like, yeah, we're trading coins. You know, what's to stop them from leaving? Which is kind of a trend that we've seen in other chain ecosystems.
00:31:29.665 - 00:31:41.985, Speaker B: I think the chain needs to have enough bandwidth so the extraction is basically so low that it doesn't make rational sense to leave. Like if you're.
00:31:42.145 - 00:31:58.901, Speaker C: Well, I think it's not so much, hey, this is a, you know, rent seeking relationship with the chain. It's more, yeah, I get a premium if it's pump chain instead of pump the app. And like that's kind of the kind of incentives that we've seen. I think in part why people are.
00:31:59.013 - 00:32:02.029, Speaker A: Leaving this app chains internalizing the mev.
00:32:02.157 - 00:32:03.317, Speaker C: Yes, that too.
00:32:03.461 - 00:32:47.055, Speaker B: I don't think the MEV can be that big of a revenue source compared to a chain that can charge a percentage on each on the value transfer. Like ultimately they have the most control about value capture and the MEV is going to be like a fraction of that. And like so I think it's going to be a better split than Apple and their 3070 split. My guess is closer to like 1090, 10. But the goal of the chain is to create an environment where it is as low as possible. And in my dream, the apps have the biggest validators because they're capturing part of that MEV anyways. And they can easily just do that.
00:32:47.055 - 00:33:23.305, Speaker B: They run a validator and tell people to delegate there and they earn a return. So in some ways, if you care about mev, you can just go boot up a validator and get halfway there just from that. I think you're going to see a bunch of apps creating their own chain simply because there is valuations that give them a multiple. But all that stuff collapses to where one or two survive and then you're like, shit, I'm on my own. I don't have enough users. Like, so like that. That's just part of the normal cycle.
00:33:23.305 - 00:33:50.835, Speaker B: You have like investment dollars that help everyone to unbundle and then a whole bunch of stuff fails. 1 in 20 survive and then everything bundles back. That's part of the natural cycle. The advantage that Solana as an ecosystem has is we're only focused on bundling always. It is one giant state machine. We need to increase its bandwidth. Everything needs to be as integrated as possible.
00:33:51.295 - 00:34:24.171, Speaker A: If the story is that Solana is one giant state machine, there was a kerfuffle, I think it was last month or a month before, about network extensions. Exactly. Which is this loose rebrand of L2s, but also like L2 like things and or, you know, non SVM virtual machines running on Solana. So given the way in which Solana has been very critical of this horizontal scaling story in EVM land, how do you think about how network extensions as a concept fits into that story that you just told?
00:34:24.243 - 00:35:21.095, Speaker B: The goal for the L1 is to increase its bandwidth to the point where the price is so low that the stuff that's off chain is just not really designed for running in this composable state machine. Like PITH is a great example. Like they're 1 to 2000 TPS in their pith network. The price that they want to pay for recording those Oracle updates per transaction is so low that it's not just like a business worth hunting for. Right. It's not like all the Solana L1 engineers need to bend over backwards and test the chain at 10x capacity just to win that, to get a few extra dollars per month or whatever. So that's the goal of the L1 is like increase its bandwidth to the point that the stuff that's off chain is priced so low that it's irrelevant to the actual value accrual to the L1.
00:35:21.095 - 00:35:55.505, Speaker B: And those things then are like just, this is a database for this particular game instance. Great. There's reasons to do that. You might want to have that record and validity and all this other stuff and do some interesting games around correctness of how everyone played whatever. That's a business model. Go hack it out. But does Solana L1 need to increase its scale to go move each one of those game instance transactions to the L1? Like how much value would it bring? Like, pretty minimal.
00:35:55.505 - 00:36:20.481, Speaker B: But this is very different than let's have OP and Arbitrum create their own general purpose VMs with all the same defi applications, all the same kind of things and super chains to wrap them all together and basically compete with Solana. Right. So the goal for mainnet is to not allow for that to happen. Right. Increase its bandwidth.
00:36:20.553 - 00:36:30.105, Speaker A: How do you not allow it? Like if somebody says, I'm going to create a network extension that is a fork of Solana that bridges back to Solana. And this is for, you know, meme coins.
00:36:30.265 - 00:36:38.593, Speaker B: Absolutely. Here's all the code to fork it, here's all the support. It's all part of the same open source community. Go do that. Have a ball.
00:36:38.649 - 00:36:40.233, Speaker A: But, but that's not the strategy.
00:36:40.329 - 00:37:11.741, Speaker B: L1 is going to increase its bandwidth to, to make it so there's no rational price difference. Like the users are not going to get a better experience in this other thing. So there's no reason for them to switch over. There's no reason for you to run that business there unless there's other more, less engineering reasons. Maybe you think you get better valuation Capture and your VCs tell you go launch your own L1 or whatever. That's fine. That is like as a founder, I'm like, go take a shot at that.
00:37:11.741 - 00:37:34.705, Speaker B: Maybe it'll work, maybe not. Right. But that's not the same as like Ethereum. L1 is at capacity. We're not going to increase L1 bandwidth because we're afraid of losing home stakers. So go move all of your users and business into L2s. Literally like bankless guys were saying, L1 is not for users, it's for L2s.
00:37:34.705 - 00:37:48.095, Speaker B: Never going to say that. That's never going to come out of my mouth. I'm going to say, always going to say that. Ethereum Mainet. I mean Solana Mainet is always for users Right. It's the primary goal is to have Freudian flip.
00:37:50.875 - 00:38:15.629, Speaker A: Okay. All right. So in the spirit of deposition, so your claim is that okay, well, Solana Mainnet is always for users. The fees on Solana Mainnet will never rise. So my counter that is that that's a function of supply and demand, right? Once you have fee markets, it's not up to you whether or not fees on Solana rise. Fees on Solana will rise if demand outstrips supply. Solana is already at the point where network congestion has been pretty consistently high, especially lately.
00:38:15.629 - 00:38:36.615, Speaker A: Actually we had just another all time high of activity I think over the weekend on Solana. And the stability of the network has been much stronger than what it was a couple of years ago. But there's still a lot of network congestion such that many transactions fail of just normal people trying to send transactions through RPCs. Now this hasn't resulted in fees.
00:38:36.995 - 00:38:59.145, Speaker B: You can actually look at the stats like go to validatorsapp.com and that is a uncontested transaction that is just, no, it's not touching any congested state. And those are priced at like medium, like medium fees going through stake with QoS they have zero failures because they're not touching hotspots.
00:38:59.185 - 00:39:06.049, Speaker A: Right? But if someone's trading something on Jupiter or someone's trading a meme coin, their experience is that okay. A lot of times transactions fail.
00:39:06.177 - 00:39:41.145, Speaker B: So those fees are inescapable to some extent. There's obviously engineering reasons to make it better, but there is a limit to how far they can go. Because you have a single piece of state that's globally replicated that you have low liquidity, high volatility and many different users trying to touch. There's no way to fix that problem. And the only way to resolve the breadlines is to have people pay priority and get ahead. And that person gets the trade. But their trade pushes everyone else to failure because their slippage setting is set too low.
00:39:41.145 - 00:40:16.103, Speaker B: And the only way we can improve upon that is go to 200 millisecond blocks, multiple concurrent block producers. All of this stuff you have to do anyways. An L2 will not solve this problem. They can hide it with priority lanes to a single server or like effectively what NASDAQ does, right? You have your 10, 10 jumps or whatever they pay you for like ethernet cables of the same length. But there's no. It's a fundamentally a physics information problem. You have to synchronize all the state and get everyone to go submit it.
00:40:16.103 - 00:40:30.751, Speaker B: Like if you ran an OTC Desk for any of these MEME coins, your fee from Spot would be much higher than everyone's slippage settings for you to take those orders.
00:40:30.783 - 00:42:01.563, Speaker D: Upside, I will, I will say one thing related to this that is sort of the thing I think that really kind of changed my mind and opinion on Solana from early 2022 to now is just like looking at the evolution of the scheduler code base within the client to the scheduler. If you look at how it's evolved based on demand and based on adjusting to some of the events that have happened, and how it's more tied to the MEV part of the system than in Ethereum, you can see that by coupling MEV with how you're doing, scheduling can actually generally load balance your contention a lot better, have a lot lower contention. Whereas I do feel like one problem of being completely agnostic to that in the way that L2s are, is that you kind of fragment your MEV in some weird way such that if I add up all the mev, there's actually like worse losses for users across all the chains in aggregate. So I do think there's one of the things that's. And you see this in SWI and Aptos too, right, where their scheduling is much more complicated. And I think there is this one kind of annoying thing in EVM chains, which is when you look at how they deal with scheduling in parallel and how they look at the interaction, when there is state contention, it tries to take a stance that's completely agnostic to what type of contention you have. But if you're agnostic, there's no free lunch.
00:42:01.563 - 00:42:44.435, Speaker D: Like if you're agnostic, then you're going to have this fee problem, right? There's sort of like uncertainty principle there. Like if you're, if you're perfectly agnostic, then your fees will have to be perfectly elastic. You can't have both fees bounded and your kind of like contention service bounded. And I think if you look at the evolution of the Solana scheduler, that seems to be a principle. I would say I like see as an outsider reading the code base, looking at how it's constructing this dag, looking how it's traversing it, looking at how it's like doing the local ordering. And I think learning that lesson live from production failures is a very different thing than trying to a priori design it. And so I think that's where I see the yin and the yang of the Ethereum philosophy or Swana philosophy.
00:42:44.435 - 00:42:51.967, Speaker D: I don't know if that's it's. Kind of related to this thing you're bringing up fee wise, but maybe it's a little more in the weeds.
00:42:52.071 - 00:43:14.145, Speaker C: So it always reminds me of what's that essay? It's like a day in a libertarian paradise where it's like I call the police and I haven't paid my subscription to shoot my son and then my house is on fire, but I need to pay another subscription. And like, you know, it's like you remove any sort of basic support and it's like, oh, you let the market figure it out. And you know, it works to a certain extent.
00:43:14.225 - 00:43:47.051, Speaker B: There is a lot of competition in that space too. So there's just a lot of input from. Because that's, that's like the beauty of it is that is very revenue. There's a lot of revenue to capture there. So a lot of smart people are all trying to solve what is like effectively a knapsack problem heuristic. How do I pack these blocks with all these different limits and contention between all these things to maximize revenue? And they're forced to look multiple layers deep into the content of the transactions to do it.
00:43:47.123 - 00:44:21.955, Speaker D: And I think as a sign that I think Solana scheduling and dispatch are more attuned for MEV and optimizing experience for a user at the same time is you uni chain kind of the flashbots design copies, shreds. Right. Like they basically have a lot of the stuff that makes it easier to do scheduling in parallel starting to hit L2s. But my point is a base layer not having that does have some cost. Right. Especially when you're going cross L2. There's no way around my like long.
00:44:21.995 - 00:45:44.385, Speaker B: Term answer to mert. The short to medium term is I think like there's content in scale and the size of the network, there's network effects and that is the killer content that Solana has that I think is much harder to bootstrap now because one, we got the opportunity to do it five years ago when there was just a lot less stuff and now all of these next generation networks are competing with themselves plus the survival the grizzled survivors of the last cycles. Right. I think long term though my belief is that the kind of end state design for Solana is what finance needs and doesn't matter what layer it is. I think it's multiple concurrent writers that are globally distributed like a large a set of them that are so large that the latency to get your transaction included anywhere in the world to go to the nearest block producer is shorter than Sending it to New York. This is kind of like my dream is that we basically built Spanner for finance with like, trusted, not trusted, but trust, minimized atomic timestamps for all the important financial events, and all this stuff gets zipped together and priced as efficiently as possible. That's, I think, the end state for finance.
00:45:44.385 - 00:45:47.803, Speaker B: And it doesn't matter if you do it in L2 or not.
00:45:47.929 - 00:46:41.145, Speaker A: Yeah, you made an interesting point that your claim is that, okay, part of the answer to Mert's question of how does Solana win in a world where everybody can catch up with respect to performance and speed and scalability? The answer is, in part, we got there first. We were the first ones to figure out that this was the thing that everybody really wanted, and we just delivered the fuck out of it. And I wrote a tweet a week ago where I talked about that crypto doesn't really seem to have a first mover advantage. First mover advantage, I think in general is kind of a bit of a meme in that it doesn't really exist across most markets. But I think what you see in crypto is almost like instead of a first mover advantage, it's not quite a second mover advantage so much as a second cohort advantage. Is that the first cohort, these are the pioneers who go out and make the first set of mistakes. So this is the people who basically immediately followed Ethereum.
00:46:41.145 - 00:47:46.621, Speaker A: And we're all, if you think about like, eth Classic and, I don't know, just people who are copying Bitcoin or Counterparty or people who just didn't quite have enough of a difference and didn't really understand totally what people wanted. And that second cohort of you guys and Avalanche and Near, they were all able to really effectively realize what Ethereum got wrong and what the people who are immediately trying to innovate on Ethereum got wrong and like, sort of just gradient descent toward, aha. Here's what people really demand, and I'm going to give them as much of that as I possibly can. That second cohort gets to do the land grab because they actually got the price signal from customers of what they really want. And that land grab is a lot harder to do in the third cohort because everything is way harder when people already have an empire that you're fighting against. So increasingly, I think if you look across many different verticals, whether it's Blur versus opensea or whether it's AAVE versus Compound, or all these things, where you see the second mover ends up Winning. They weren't even literally the second mover in many cases.
00:47:46.621 - 00:47:58.709, Speaker A: There were many other movers who came after the first mover, but they were part of that class that got to observe the first mover and iterate against them. And I feel like that's a lot of what Solana has done really well.
00:47:58.797 - 00:48:09.827, Speaker B: If the things you're building are like on a sigmoid, you get to the point of the curve where now improvements are marginal to the user and that's much harder to win tam that way.
00:48:09.931 - 00:48:10.419, Speaker A: Totally.
00:48:10.507 - 00:48:56.713, Speaker D: Although to your comments about new content, if this is still ebam's world, then there's still many networks that are created after that where they had completely new content that didn't get copied fast enough and then they were able to create a new niche moat. You know, I eat. You know, you brought up the YouTube example. I also think of Vimeo, right? Like Vimeo, even though it's small, has a much smaller pain but like highly paying user base and like has somehow survived from that. And I, I kind of think like there's, it's not clear that you, you know everything that all the content that ever needs to be on chain is already known. Like I, I feel like that, that that's the one thing I will disagree.
00:48:56.769 - 00:49:01.817, Speaker B: I didn't say content, I said asset type. I think everything will probably.
00:49:01.881 - 00:49:05.737, Speaker D: That is sort of the same thing. I think that is kind of the same thing.
00:49:05.801 - 00:49:12.445, Speaker B: It's going to be a token or an NFT, like even LP positions in Uniswap or NFTs.
00:49:14.345 - 00:49:35.589, Speaker D: I just think it's going to be more like state is going to be less fixed and it's going to have more streaming like behaviors. It's like the rest of the Internet. You look at the 90s Internet, it's all static content everywhere, right. And then it became dynamic content. I feel like there's some notion of an asset type we don't know of. That is that transition. Right.
00:49:35.589 - 00:49:38.773, Speaker D: And that completely changed how people made websites. That changed how people.
00:49:38.829 - 00:50:04.423, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm gonna take Anatoly's side here is that I don't think we are going to discover new types of content. Like if you think about streaming, like it wasn't as though streaming was inconceivable in the, in the 90s, right. It was just hard. It's just we didn't have the bandwidth for it. But like all these kinds of content, oh, short form video, long form video, images, games, these were all concepts that we were readily available. They just didn't have the bandwidth for it.
00:50:04.479 - 00:50:19.519, Speaker D: But it wasn't just bandwidth. Right. It was a lot of like, routing, a lot of like other types of optimization, a lot of like local caching. Like, my point is like, there's a whole system of optimizations that isn't just very incremental.
00:50:19.687 - 00:50:36.123, Speaker C: These are like very primitive interfaces too. It's like saying, oh, the Internet still runs on HTTP, you know, it's like, well, yeah, but the stuff that people are using it for today was like, not really imaginable, you know, 30 years ago. And so it's like, yeah, like prediction market tokens might be tokens, but that's not really how people kind of conceived of tokens.
00:50:36.179 - 00:50:52.203, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, that's kind of why I'm like, I don't want to. I don't think a lot like, there's no new asset. Yeah, look, I too can also call H tons on a bit string and shove it somewhere and send it somewhere. Right. That's not the notion of content.
00:50:52.259 - 00:50:52.451, Speaker B: Right?
00:50:52.483 - 00:51:06.081, Speaker D: The. The notion of content on the Internet is actually the entire, you know, abstract thing. It's not just like the bytes that are sent. It's like how you interpret the byte in the same way. I don't think the notion of a single token is like the end all be all in the long.
00:51:06.153 - 00:51:25.269, Speaker A: Sure, there may be kinds of tokens that represent things that are surprising to us that they end up on a blockchain or surprising to us that people care about them or that they're valuable. I. I think I agree with Anatoly here that I think this is going to be a relatively small pocket of what happens in blockchains in the next 15 to 20 years. The reality is that almost everything that we see working today.
00:51:25.317 - 00:51:26.557, Speaker D: How much Red Bull do we want?
00:51:26.661 - 00:51:33.285, Speaker A: Idea. Hold on, let me finish my point and then we can conceive a bet. If you want to take one.
00:51:33.445 - 00:51:33.957, Speaker D: I'll take.
00:51:34.021 - 00:52:02.047, Speaker A: Almost everything we see that works on chain that is any meaningful scale is an old idea. Dogecoin is old as shit, right? Stablecoin is old as shit. Prediction markets, old as shit. These have all been around for a very, very long time. Now, the way in which meme coins are happening or the way in which we see these individual stories playing out are surprising. The details are difficult to anticipate in advance, but is the idea that, yeah, we'd be using them for real world assets and stablecoins and treasuries and meme coins and da, da, da. No.
00:52:02.047 - 00:52:22.223, Speaker A: All this menagerie of things that we might buy and sell on chain, we figured it all out a long ass time ago. In the same way that people talked about there being TV on the Internet and voiceover IP and all this stuff. Old, old ideas, you know, these were not like, oh my God. In the. In 2006, we suddenly discovered that you could put video on the Internet and it changed everything.
00:52:22.319 - 00:52:30.207, Speaker B: Bonding, curves, MMs, clubs, all those things are covered kind of most of the market, I think.
00:52:30.271 - 00:52:36.519, Speaker D: Okay. The reductivism to everything as a token or NFT is like missing a lot, right? Like the examples you gave.
00:52:36.567 - 00:52:45.713, Speaker A: Like I'm arguing at a stronger level than that. That I'm not arguing. Okay, yeah, token. I'm saying literally the use cases for the tokens have almost all been articulated in the past.
00:52:45.809 - 00:53:14.979, Speaker B: That drives the requirements for the chain, right? Like this is kind of the biggest flack that we get is that Solana SVM development just sucks ass. It's a pain in the ass. You have to spend a lot of time onboarding it. But to a business, to those developers, they're not the important developers. I love them. They're all important to me individually, but they're the plumbers. They're.
00:53:15.067 - 00:53:16.603, Speaker A: Pretty soon there'll be AIs.
00:53:16.739 - 00:53:55.595, Speaker B: That part I don't know about, but they're basically building Windows drivers, right? It's the people that consume that stuff in JavaScript and all. As soon as that stuff is in JS, that's the developer experience. It's like the company that takes a bunch of JavaScript code and glues it together. They don't give a shit if the developer spent two nights like on Red Bull optimizing SVM stack allocations or whatever. It's already in js. To them, all that stuff is hidden and gone. So like the developer experience that matters is as soon as you're done with smart contracts, it's like all that stuff is already baked.
00:53:55.595 - 00:54:43.491, Speaker B: And the number of smart contracts you need to write gets smaller and smaller every year because there's already a token implementation. And when there were a whole bunch of weird things that people wanted to do with tokens, there's now token 22. Right? Or token extensions that cover that tail. And I don't know when the next set of tokens will need to be written by maybe 2030. Right? Just the amount of featurization that you need to do in the driver level in the plumbing gets smaller and smaller every year. And that drives kind of the design decisions and everything else that people need to do in us in the L1. Do you need more VMs do we need WASM? That seemed like really important two years ago that we're going to need to support multiple VMs and all this other stuff.
00:54:43.683 - 00:54:48.323, Speaker A: But optionality, I remember that being a big story a couple years ago.
00:54:48.499 - 00:54:49.843, Speaker B: It's just, there's no demand.
00:54:49.899 - 00:54:56.131, Speaker D: The entire 2017 ICO boom was about alternative VMs. If you think about it, there's like.
00:54:56.163 - 00:55:05.251, Speaker A: Pretty much why VMS running sideways? Well, there was like supposed to be a movie within Solana and all this other stuff and there's interoperable, there's.
00:55:05.283 - 00:55:12.443, Speaker B: I totally forgot like the team that got to main, that was Neon. So they have like an EVM implementation. But.
00:55:12.579 - 00:55:19.265, Speaker A: But that's like a virtualized evm, right? That's not at the. That's not like a side. A sort of parallel VM.
00:55:19.425 - 00:56:07.911, Speaker B: What the 99% developers want to do is they want to create a token and there's already an implementation of tokens that nobody even like forks and re uploads like they do on Ethereum. They literally just use the API, create new token in JavaScript and they're done. And there's no need for a new VM. You're not going to spend 30L5 engineers for two years to build a new virtual machine just to have that use case be another token. And that's, I think, kind of like a lot of this optionality and all these other things collapse when the use cases become much more fixed. You have markets, you have tokens, you have NFTs. And what matters maybe is speed and cost.
00:56:07.911 - 00:56:43.553, Speaker B: And compression was one thing that seem to matter because there's like 500 million compressed NFTs now in Metaplex, like Merkle Trees. But to a developer, once that stuff is done, they're like, oh, this is a cheaper API with different markets that run it and they go plug it into JavaScript and it goes, right, that's it. Do they care what VM that is? Do they care if it's built in solidity or like any other? None of that stuff starts mattering less and less.
00:56:43.689 - 00:57:08.731, Speaker A: Granted. Right. But my understanding, I mean, I mean, I don't really care. It's not something that I think is particularly strategic. But the vision behind it, I assume at the time that it was originally conceived, was that if you can have these VMS running, you know, in parallel, side by side with each other in this sort of segregated state space, then Solana can eat everything. Solana can eat the VM, Solana can eat all the move VMs.
00:57:08.843 - 00:57:17.147, Speaker B: They're not even segregated. They're you can atomically move state between them in a transaction, can hit instruction 1 VM like SVM.
00:57:17.211 - 00:57:21.267, Speaker A: Right, right, right. So there's a, there's a sort of cable connecting them. Right. But they're foreign.
00:57:21.371 - 00:57:22.875, Speaker D: Foreign function interface.
00:57:22.995 - 00:58:06.855, Speaker B: Yeah. The problem is like, it's like Windows could run JVM and every other VM or Linux right from. I spent 20 years working in operating systems, I can build this 20 different ways. The thing is there's just no demand for it. What people actually like, weirdly what happened with SVM is it's a very restrictive environment. There's no interfaces unlike Ethereum. So once there was one implementation of Token called SPL Token, there was no second or third implementation that ever got any meaningful market share because everyone would literally just use the JavaScript command to go create another token, just call the same program.
00:58:06.855 - 00:59:11.029, Speaker B: And in a weird way that allowed for the success of things like Pump and these other things. Because when you're creating a bonding curve or whatever or a market, you can consume any instance of SPL Token because you trust the implementation. There's no way for implementer of that interface to screw up or maliciously code the implementation to go fuck with your customers. Right. If you're the front page for the markets and you're presenting markets, you have to basically allow list every version of ERC20 to make sure that when people click Deposit LP Capital they're not getting screwed because somebody like made an implementation that steals their funds. Right? By the sheer like weirdness of SVM that just doesn't happen because everyone just reuses existing primitives. So there's no, there's no optionality that devs actually need.
00:59:11.029 - 01:00:23.893, Speaker B: There's no need for another VM because what is it going to do? Is it going to build a better version of Token? If there was literally demand for a VM to go do something, you could just code this up into one standard implementation that everyone reuses and that plumbing work is done as soon as it's in JavaScript. So weirdly, I think some shortcuts that we took by skipping all these things that made a lot of sense to our. Like if you were to tell me like these choices that you're making are actually going to be end up beneficial, like three years later, I would not have believed you because as a Operating system designer, VM designer or whatever, you want to give developers maximum optionality, there's just kind of like this developer instinct. Like I want my devs to have the most widest power tools possible. I want Them to be as pluggable and whatever, yada yada. That ends up actually being a net negative. In smart contracts, you want to limit the contracts to be as harder to modify, like as easy to like.
01:00:23.893 - 01:00:38.129, Speaker B: Basically what we're trying to do is make it easier for businesses to talk to each other with the least amount of friction. And that means you're standardizing over implementations that everyone agrees upon are correct and cannot be attacked.
01:00:38.237 - 01:01:15.335, Speaker A: Okay, so let's switch gears a little bit and let's talk about phones because I know this has been a passion project of yours and I know you have a long background working in telecoms. So Solana originally. So originally there was the sagaphone and actually when we brought you on two years ago, one of the topics that we discussed was Saga, the original Saga phone, which was back in 2022. So a brief history of the Saga phone. Saga Phone originally launched, had okay sales, didn't fully sell out. Then Bonk the meme Quantum Solana launched and did an airdrop to Solana phones. All the Solana phone original lineup of Saga phones sold out because Bonk was just so.
01:01:15.335 - 01:01:40.049, Speaker A: Bonk just ran up so much and basically the phones were worth more than the retail price. And so a new lineup of phones has now been announced called Seeker Seeker. Solana Seeker Seeker's gonna be launching in 2025 and there have been 140,000 pre orders which is pretty incredible number how many total sold of the Sagaphone?
01:01:40.137 - 01:01:40.918, Speaker B: 20,000.
01:01:41.091 - 01:01:48.885, Speaker A: 20,000. So a 7x jump in the total amount of at least in the pre orders. And these are full price preorders.
01:01:49.465 - 01:01:53.545, Speaker B: This is like your. The preorder is a full price of the phone, right?
01:01:53.585 - 01:02:00.909, Speaker A: So this is like 50, 60 million in total pre orders, I believe. Yeah. So you're pretty, pretty incredible USCC too.
01:02:00.957 - 01:02:06.345, Speaker B: We're like the, the probably the number one merchant for Circle.
01:02:06.965 - 01:02:52.791, Speaker A: Nice, nice. And it seems like many people are anticipating that there will be more airdrops and there's like an NFT that's now bundled with a phone to like make it very easy to airdrop to to phone holders. So in response, seemingly in response to this, just in the last week we had the announcement of an Ethereum phone called Ethos. And this Ethereum phone, it's derived from Lineage os, a fork of Android and it's a mobile device for Ethereum on chained apps, runs a light client for runs an Ethereum Lite client and it's seemingly not gotten anywhere near the kind of reception that the Solana phone has gotten. Tom, I don't know you were making some comments. What's your take on the, the new Ethereum phone?
01:02:52.863 - 01:02:58.743, Speaker C: Well, I mean they call it like an EDC because they're not trying to position it as a phone. Like they don't really sort of hype.
01:02:58.759 - 01:02:59.215, Speaker D: Up any of the.
01:02:59.255 - 01:03:11.995, Speaker C: So what is an edc like everyday Carry. They're trying to invent a new category I think. And you know, I think they're, they're downplaying any of this sort of telephony kind of stuff. I think they've actually kind of, I don't know how much of it is actually shipping with the phone.
01:03:12.655 - 01:03:15.015, Speaker A: Is this like those AI like the, like the rabbit.
01:03:15.055 - 01:03:16.071, Speaker D: It's a little bit like a rabbit.
01:03:16.183 - 01:04:04.517, Speaker B: Shipping sucks. The certification costs like all of the stuff. Like 20,000 units is a loss effectively. So basically you need to break like 100k units to not be a loss on just building out the hardware. So we debated heavily on whether the Saga should have been like a non phone, like kind of a. To skip all the certification, all this other stuff. But my feeling is that like the prize, the biggest prize is taking a chunk out of meaningful chunk out of Apple and Samsung, a Google kind of ecosystem by building an alternative app store with devs and like and you need this to be a daily driver kind of thing.
01:04:04.517 - 01:04:12.603, Speaker B: So if you're going to go build hardware, might as well. I mean if you can afford it, might as well go like take the bigger swing.
01:04:12.739 - 01:04:20.187, Speaker A: What do you, what do you think of the Ethos Phone then Anatolia, given that? My understanding is that Saga as well as Seeker have been your personal passion projects.
01:04:20.291 - 01:04:26.787, Speaker B: I don't know if it's going to like it's. I, I feel like I want to give those guys a hug.
01:04:26.971 - 01:04:29.295, Speaker A: Oh. Oh, that bad?
01:04:29.595 - 01:04:42.213, Speaker B: No, like they're not. No, not because of like it's just the journey of building hardware sucks. Like it is so painful and I want them to succeed.
01:04:42.389 - 01:04:48.065, Speaker D: I never want to tape out a chip again in my life. That was the worst experience ever.
01:04:49.365 - 01:05:27.431, Speaker B: If they need any help with anything, I will happy to give them all the support that we have with their hardware journey, whatever resources we can give them. I think it's just such a painful process. I hope they succeed because I think if you can find an opportunity to create a new device category that's huge, that. But it's really, really tough because you don't just. The iteration cycles are so slow and this is why, especially going for a new device type. The obvious question is why isn't this just an app Effectively or a light client.
01:05:27.543 - 01:05:42.351, Speaker D: Or if you have a really good light client, can I just have a mobile app that only uses the light client? And why do I need the. I get it for the te and the custom hardware piece. So like, how do you differentiate like the needs of the phone between those two?
01:05:42.423 - 01:06:32.493, Speaker B: So I sincerely wish them like the best of luck and like whatever, if they listening to this, if they DM me or whatever, I'm happy to connect them to all our hardware people and like help them in any way. I think it's just going to be hard and it's really hard to predict success or failure there. But for us, like the thesis remains the same, is like Apple and Google are going to fight any kind of like open app stores tooth and nail and it's going to be like act of Congress effectively, I think to really open them up. And even if they do like they did in Europe, the fees are like, I don't know if you saw their docs on, like, if you link out to pay, to pay through the web, you have to pay Apple 28% and then show them all your books and stuff. It's just insane.
01:06:32.669 - 01:06:38.265, Speaker A: It's definitely going to be a long fight before we have like the final, final version of all this.
01:06:38.645 - 01:07:22.447, Speaker B: So crypto is disruptive because it can create digital scarcity and that changes the revenue model for people distributing digital assets. So you're not, you don't have to be as reliant on this giant distribution channel to find the 1% of your whales. I think the interesting part here is that you can literally give a whole bunch of your digital assets to your whales to move them over to a better platform with lower fees. That was, that's the idea. That's the best. Maybe we saw like a sliver of that with Bonk, because what we saw was people that received bonk, bought, sold the bonk and bought the phone because they were getting the equivalent bonk back. That was the weird part that happened.
01:07:22.447 - 01:07:37.321, Speaker B: It wasn't that they were like, I'm going to. Because like the arbitrage doesn't make sense. The you're paying a thousand bucks to get a phone a week later on this meme coin that is priced right now. Like most people are not dumb enough to do that.
01:07:37.513 - 01:07:39.649, Speaker A: I mean, you can short the meme coin, right?
01:07:39.697 - 01:07:54.023, Speaker B: Like so. But effectively that's what they did. They already had bonk. They sold a little bit of it to get the bonk back and then they got a whole bunch of other rewards. So but we need that Loop to actually work repeatedly and consistently and with.
01:07:54.119 - 01:07:58.915, Speaker A: Have you considered maybe just keeping the phones? Like, just make the phones and then just keep all the airdrops.
01:08:03.455 - 01:08:04.295, Speaker B: So this.
01:08:04.455 - 01:08:08.991, Speaker D: Why. Why would they still airdrop? There's no. Just don't tell them.
01:08:09.023 - 01:08:12.355, Speaker A: Just don't tell them. It's all sold out. Sorry you didn't get yours.
01:08:14.295 - 01:08:16.755, Speaker D: You announce the addresses first.
01:08:17.775 - 01:08:20.829, Speaker A: If you do. I will invest in this. I will invest in this.
01:08:20.957 - 01:08:25.557, Speaker D: I. This seems like this won't work because, like, this is. Why would you get air drops.
01:08:25.621 - 01:08:38.945, Speaker B: The Bitcoin mining as 6 of 2016. This was my first drug. Is the. Was this company that made the, like, one of the first Asics. They taped it out and then they mined for six months before they sent it.
01:08:40.885 - 01:08:43.517, Speaker D: That's if I remember. If I remember. If I remember.
01:08:43.701 - 01:08:48.551, Speaker A: Delay the delivery so long that you get the airdrops, sell them, and then give people their phones.
01:08:48.623 - 01:08:51.303, Speaker D: If I remember right, that was Avalon, maybe.
01:08:51.399 - 01:09:10.359, Speaker B: Yeah. If we can get like a million units out with a developer ecosystem that is competitive in revenue to anything remotely of that ratio of Apple and Google, that is such a bigger prize than picking up, you know, meme coins in.
01:09:10.367 - 01:09:26.855, Speaker A: Front of a steam pretty well. I don't know. We'll see. But all right, I respect that. I respect that. Okay, so we're running up on time. We were originally planning to talk about news, so we were literally planning to talk about Trump's failed World Liberty finance raise as well as goat token.
01:09:26.855 - 01:09:37.691, Speaker A: We've had no time. We spent the whole time on this deposition thing. Well, first I wanted to take. How do you rank that deposition? I'm sure you've been on a lot of. It was weak deposition podcast.
01:09:37.803 - 01:09:42.741, Speaker B: What is the worst thing about Solana? What do you guys think is like, the Achilles heel?
01:09:42.893 - 01:09:54.893, Speaker A: Look, I'm telling you, I am not that critical of Solana anymore. This was a. Here's my biggest criticism. Here's my biggest criticism. Solana is. I think you guys do not take criticism that well. I think you take criticism very well.
01:09:54.893 - 01:09:56.181, Speaker A: I think most of the people.
01:09:56.293 - 01:09:58.893, Speaker D: My biggest criticism is you can't take criticism.
01:09:58.949 - 01:10:06.243, Speaker A: There you go. There you go. I mean, I think it's. I think it's very valid. I think it's very valid. Here's the thing. Solana is.
01:10:06.243 - 01:10:14.863, Speaker A: Solana still feels, I think, internally like it did in 2023. Right? I think internally they nearly feel like a sort of.
01:10:14.919 - 01:10:15.875, Speaker B: It's just like.
01:10:16.255 - 01:10:34.329, Speaker A: No, no, what I mean is that they feel like a minority. They feel like they're sort of on the back foot. They've been through a lot of pain and I think they hold onto this mentality, which is very real. Right. It went through a super tough, dark night of the soul through 2023. But Solana now is the big boy on the block.
01:10:34.377 - 01:10:34.537, Speaker B: Right?
01:10:34.561 - 01:10:52.193, Speaker A: Solana is fucking $80 billion. You know, it's a massive network. Yeah. It's terrifying. It's a success story by any stretch of the imagination. But I feel like psychologically the Solana community doesn't feel like that. They feel very like, you know, sort of high, high on their guard.
01:10:52.193 - 01:10:55.285, Speaker A: And I think that could, that could stand to improve.
01:10:55.825 - 01:11:02.065, Speaker B: No, they should. Every founder needs to feel like they're a wounded, hungry animal. And winter's coming.
01:11:02.965 - 01:11:09.677, Speaker D: Okay, I have a criticism that's not as dumb as Haseebs, because Haseebs is actually stupid criticism, to be honest.
01:11:09.781 - 01:11:10.069, Speaker A: Great.
01:11:10.117 - 01:11:34.845, Speaker D: I'm going to be very blunt. It's like, okay, fine, I think Fire Dancer is a bit of a LARP slash useless. I actually think like Agave and the Jito client are actually sufficient. And that's awesome as an engineering project. It's awesome as an engineering project. I don't think it will change any developer or user's experience on the network.
01:11:35.585 - 01:11:57.697, Speaker B: That's absolutely not like. So that I agree with you there. But what it does is a second implementation literally means that the bus factor is not one, it's two. Just the probability of a catastrophic bug, like a guess down exponentially. Binance can run both nodes, Coinbase can run both nodes, Wormhole can run both nodes.
01:11:57.841 - 01:12:11.993, Speaker D: But keeping development cycles synchronized on new patches in response to events like making sure all the people. I think you really do slow down your development process this way. That's fine.
01:12:12.049 - 01:12:13.417, Speaker A: I 100% agree with that.
01:12:13.521 - 01:12:14.321, Speaker B: Maybe in the theory.
01:12:14.393 - 01:12:15.577, Speaker A: Almost certainly true.
01:12:15.681 - 01:12:25.485, Speaker B: I almost feel like they should be able to ship faster because they know that another team also built this thing. And the probability of them.
01:12:27.945 - 01:12:31.257, Speaker D: Divergence between rest and death is a great example of this.
01:12:31.361 - 01:12:33.857, Speaker B: But liveness is not as important as safety.
01:12:34.001 - 01:12:50.021, Speaker A: But that's the thing. You have so much experience in software engineering among organizations. When you have two organizations that have to agree on how to build something, of course it's going to slow down. There's no fucking way you're going to move as fast when you have a single implementation that you can kind of be, you know, benevolent dictator.
01:12:50.133 - 01:13:37.293, Speaker B: Liveness is not as important as safety, obviously. I think the difference here with Solana is that everyone is like okay with aliveness failure, like a future one, like we're willing to eat that as an ecosystem. Everyone is like, internalize those to the point. They're like, if it means double the capacity, block capacity or if it means no safety violations or whatever. So like be it right, obviously trying to minimize them and do your best. But if there's a Fire, like we need to double block capacity next week and both Fire Dancer and Agave shipped implementations and three months later they diverge because they rushed us out. Like everyone has kind of internalized that cost already.
01:13:37.389 - 01:14:01.941, Speaker D: I think you split developer, you split developer mindshare though. And like, don't get me wrong, Fire Dancer from an engineering standpoint is very beautiful. I think it has like the best Reed Solomon implementation of any client anywhere in crypto. Like, if you look at that thing, it is like by far the fastest. It's very efficient. You can tell KJB wrote it and I just like. But I kind of look at that.
01:14:01.941 - 01:14:24.717, Speaker D: I'm like, okay, great. We've really optimized the wrong. We focus all these really smart development cycles on redoing like forking and doing the same thing twice effectively. Right. Like, and I get that there is a benefit, but there's also this like cost of future features you can add. But with that you, you have when you split, divert people's energy.
01:14:24.821 - 01:14:49.551, Speaker B: My, my counter to that is if anything, Firedance is showing me that all this other stuff is marginalized. But you can just like if the performance that we saw at like fire dancer demo, 1 million TPS that was on mainnet now would anyone give a shit about any other protocol changes, like at all, ever or it's done.
01:14:49.703 - 01:14:55.875, Speaker D: I mean it doesn't matter. I want to see that in a realistic setting where you're getting lost and spammed.
01:14:56.255 - 01:14:56.735, Speaker A: Sure.
01:14:56.815 - 01:15:15.881, Speaker B: To be clear, those are all like, like day to day engineering problems. But like from a protocol perspective, how much do you care about anything else? Like all these other improvements have become so marginal compared to just raw horsepower that does it even matter to change anything?
01:15:16.073 - 01:15:46.711, Speaker D: I do agree that if Fire Dancer is successful at achieving that type of number in production and it becomes a default client, it does become much harder to Mert's question of what is the moat to just to get around that. On the other hand, there's this, this problem that two clients could also slow down your feature development. That makes it easier for developers to write new software. Like your devex might get worse because now I have to have to support two platform interfaces. And that is devex was a point.
01:15:46.743 - 01:15:48.195, Speaker B: Devex doesn't matter.
01:15:48.575 - 01:15:53.671, Speaker A: Ok, but my point, guys, we're on time. We've just hit that.
01:15:53.743 - 01:15:57.455, Speaker B: We should have started with it. This. That would have been like, yeah, yeah.
01:15:58.395 - 01:15:59.747, Speaker A: What can I say? What can I say?
01:15:59.771 - 01:16:04.935, Speaker D: Yo, you guys. You guys were. You guys were rolling for so long, I was like, quiet, saying nothing.
01:16:06.195 - 01:16:32.135, Speaker A: We gotta. We gotta bring you back at some point and we'll do part two of the deposition. Until then, I want to say congratulations on all the success. A lot of respect for, of course, Salon, and for you in particular. I think I said this last time to close out the show, but I think you are one of the treasures of the crypto industry. Not a lot of founders who've gone as far as you have, not a lot of founders who've gone as far as you have have this kind of positive, positive sum. Optimistic mentality.
01:16:32.135 - 01:16:43.207, Speaker A: And I think it does a lot for an ecosystem that can sometimes be jaded and dark and, you know, misguided. So I want to say we all appreciate you for that, and we welcome you back on anytime.
01:16:43.271 - 01:16:44.035, Speaker B: Appreciate it.
01:16:45.015 - 01:16:53.775, Speaker D: And hope. And hopefully Raj doesn't. Hopefully Raj does. Eventually realizes this isn't the Hater podcast, as he's once called it.
01:16:53.935 - 01:17:06.015, Speaker A: Solana season, where the Hater podcast. So we got it. We just got to own it. We just got to own it. Although somebody also did say, we're Solana VCs now, so we kind of, you know, we're sort of a chameleon that way. Anyway. All right, we got a wrap.
01:17:06.015 - 01:17:08.375, Speaker A: Thank you, everybody. We'll be back next week.
01:17:08.535 - 01:17:08.815, Speaker B: Yep.
