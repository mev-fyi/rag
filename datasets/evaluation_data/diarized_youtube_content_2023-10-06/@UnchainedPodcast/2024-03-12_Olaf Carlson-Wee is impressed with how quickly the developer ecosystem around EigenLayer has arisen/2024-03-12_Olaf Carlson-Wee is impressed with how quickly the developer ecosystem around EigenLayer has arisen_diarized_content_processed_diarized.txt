00:00:00.170 - 00:00:58.940, Speaker A: I'm not sure I've seen a dev ecosystem with so many new ideas come up so quickly since Ethereum itself, where with Ethereum itself, it unlocked this whole universe of kind of a multi asset blockchain, smart contracts. And in those early days, we had things like crypto collateralized stablecoins, non crypto collateralized, like offline collateral stablecoins, early DFI contracts, early NFTs. Like all those things were emerging around the Ethereum blockchain. I'm seeing very similar early, extremely promising ecosystem built around Eigen layer today. And since the system has gone live, it's really gotten a ton of traction very quickly. I think that there's over $10 billion now at stake in the Eigen layer system. I tweeted something like a year ago, if Eigen layer works, it should absorb most Ethereum information.
