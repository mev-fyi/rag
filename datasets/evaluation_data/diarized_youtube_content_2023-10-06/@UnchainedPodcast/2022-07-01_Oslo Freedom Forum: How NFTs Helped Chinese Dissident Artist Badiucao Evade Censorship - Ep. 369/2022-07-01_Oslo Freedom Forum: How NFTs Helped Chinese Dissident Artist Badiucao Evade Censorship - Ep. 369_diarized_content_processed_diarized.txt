00:00:00.650 - 00:00:51.966, Speaker A: Hey y'all. This recording is from a panel I moderated at the Oslo Freedom Forum back in May. The panel was about the work of Bario Cho, a Chinese dissonant artist who has used NFTs in his artwork. You absolutely must listen to this discussion. Bario Cho is one of the most interesting and creative people I've ever interviewed and the story of how he became the artist he is today is riveting. I think you'll also love the twists and turns in his journey to use NFTs and learn a lot from the challenges he and Nikki Selkin, the director of Creative Development at Gray Area with whom he worked on his NFT projects, faced. One other note due to the upcoming holiday and the fact that after four months, I think my book tour and catching COVID and everything else that I've been doing in the Whirlwind ever since I released my book has all finally caught up to me.
00:00:51.966 - 00:01:21.334, Speaker A: So there will be no weekly news recap today other than that. Happy 4 July everyone. And now onto the show. Hey builders.

00:01:46.930 - 00:02:30.170, Speaker B: Hi everyone. Thanks so much for coming. So I had actually never heard of Buddy at So before being asked to do this panel. But I have to say I was really taken by the kind of life story that brought him to his distant art, especially for me as an American. I remember as a teenager watching what happened on the screen, on the TV in my living room, or maybe it was my bedroom at that time, what was happening in Tiananmen Square in 1989 and his experience of that, even though he was living in China, was completely different. So can you just explain that story and how that kind of set you off on this path to becoming an artist?
00:02:31.410 - 00:03:20.006, Speaker C: Well, that's exactly why I want to enter in different community, including the community of Crypto brothers and sisters. I feel like now we are really living in our own grids. Like I can have a great followers and the reputation from the disciplined community, the new circles, the China related circles. But maybe I'll be a completely stranger to the people who are into the cryptocurrency or NFT unless I bring my art to the community to introduce myself. Well, the very reason for me to paying attention to NFD or the blockchain is because the very censorship that is happening in China. I grew up in China. When the Tiananma massacre happened in 1989, I was only three years old.
00:03:20.006 - 00:04:08.540, Speaker C: So for me, I wouldn't have a real memory if no one from my life, like teachers, doctors, parents, schools, TV publication mentioned that. And that is the reality in China. So up until university time, I never have any idea that what happened in 1989 during the movement and the massacre. In the end, I only know the event because I accidentally downloaded Pirated, the film from Internet, and then someone inserted a documentary about a tenor massacre into that Pirated file of film. And that's how I know it. And when I know it, I was already like, 22. So in 22 years, nobody mentioned it.
00:04:08.540 - 00:04:57.418, Speaker C: And when I'm watching those students marching on the street, protest and eventually gone down, crashed by tanks by the Chinese government, I'm really shocked because I'm also in the university time and like those young kids being killed by the government. However, in this gap, nobody fill this black hole for me. Nobody tells me what happened. And if not for some genius doing their own things in the Pirating film industry, I would never know it. It's really shocking and make me angry. That how the Chinese government can easily erase memory like that and just steal away from the people. So that in the future, we cannot reflect on that.
00:04:57.418 - 00:05:00.006, Speaker C: So in the future, we'll remain in the darkness.
00:05:00.198 - 00:05:44.220, Speaker B: Yeah. And actually, one comment I want to make on that is people know that HRF is really known for using technology in its work. And you may know that they have worked with sending flash drives into North Korea in this very same subversive way. So I actually find it so fascinating that the way that you discovered this historic event that is known around the world but happened in your home country was through something that was a very, very similar strategy to what HRF uses. So the other part of your story that was so interesting to me was that later you went to Australia, and I think most people in your personal life thought that you were like a preschool teacher. So talk about that period of your life.
00:05:44.830 - 00:06:15.742, Speaker C: So I actually started in a law school in China. Believe it or not, there are still law schools in China. And when I grow up, because my family history, my grandparents were actually, like the first group of filmmaker in China, and they all got persecuted during a campaign against intellectuals in 1957. So for me, this is a family lesson. One is don't be an artist. It's dangerous. Two is don't stay in China.
00:06:15.742 - 00:06:44.160, Speaker C: It can be dangerous in any time. So I end up going to Australia. But it's not easy to be immigrant. You have to choose a major that allow you to stay. And in Australia, nobody want to be a teacher, especially preschool teacher, because it's very hard work, it paid very bad, but that gives me a chance to stay. So that's why I choose to be a preschool teacher. I started master's degree for education and kind of doing this detour for four years until I have the green card and started making art.
00:06:44.770 - 00:07:16.422, Speaker B: And so talk about that period, because you were not known as an artist at that time. There's an amazing documentary about Barioso and in the beginning he is wearing a mask and it's not the kind of mask we've been wearing in COVID and you really were hidden. And I think during this conference we've been talking a lot about privacy and you really lived that lifestyle for a while. Tell the audience a little bit about that why you were doing know, not.
00:07:16.476 - 00:07:51.966, Speaker C: Like know he is being anonymous for its commercial trick. For artists who want to seeking the truth from China, you have to hire yourself because once your identity is revealed, then your family will be harassed. Then personally you will be putting into the danger. And I learned this in 2018. So from the first cartoon that I did in 2011 to 2018, I remain anonymous. I would not having event like this. If I have to do a public like performance, I will have to wearing a mask.
00:07:51.966 - 00:08:01.170, Speaker C: Actually, I have a whole collection of masks that I weared for these seven years and it was turned into installation. Now exhibiting in Prague.
00:08:01.330 - 00:08:17.580, Speaker B: Oh, wow. Yeah, they're like full on masks that cover his entire face. You can sort of see his glasses through them. But talk a little bit about the art that you started making. What were the messages you were sending? And was your hope that people in China would see them or what was your intention with that art?
00:08:18.430 - 00:08:50.658, Speaker C: I think as an artist, it's something very important that we want to express things. I do not just believe art should only for the sake of art. Art is a form of language. It's because you want to communicate with the people outside of China and inside of China. But I guess the difficulty that being an artist in China is you have to dealing with the censorship. And this censorship is very hard going around, especially when your language is written language. Because in China they have this huge internet censorship.
00:08:50.658 - 00:09:39.158, Speaker C: It's called Great Firewall and it's much based on words. So they have a database that goes through every vocabulary like Tiananmen Massacre, nobel Peace Prize, OPA du Sao by Rs name. They are all sensitive words. So if these words appear in any sentence, we're taking down swiftly. However, I think art providing this very unique chance because every time we create a new image, we do not use the old language or vocabulary that we use in literature. So in that way the Chinese authority have to find this artwork, recognize it, understand it, log it, then delete it. So regardless how efficient they will be, there will always be a window for me as an artist to talking about those issues.
00:09:39.158 - 00:10:27.346, Speaker C: And among these years, another I think Silver Bullet I found is if you manage to kind of bonding a very political censored image with something very popular and lovely, like Winnie the Fools. I don't know how many of you knows, but online there's a meme that compares Xi Jinping with Winnie the Poohs. And then the Chinese authority just freaked out. They're like, oh, shit, we have to be serious. This is the Supreme Leader, right? We have to take it down. But when they take it down, people ask questions because it's so common, because it's so loved, because it's so welcome. And then every time you manage to do that, you create a catch 22 for the authority, because if they do not take it down, then the joke goes on, the power being diminished.
00:10:27.346 - 00:10:35.750, Speaker C: But if they take down, people ask questions. And whenever people are starting to ask questions, you create cracks in this authority.
00:10:36.410 - 00:10:36.774, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:10:36.812 - 00:11:04.660, Speaker B: And just a few other examples of some of the artworks. There was one kind of showing how it was when Xi Jinping, I guess, became what was it? Dictator for life, or it's probably not that phrase, but that's what we would say. And he did three portraits, and one looks just like Xi Jinping does now. And then one is of him older, and then the last one is like a skull. And then what did the phrase say?
00:11:05.190 - 00:11:12.050, Speaker C: She forever. But actually I cheated because I used the face oh, okay. To make it look older.
00:11:12.390 - 00:11:55.346, Speaker B: And then another one was like, talking about China's influence in Australia, and he showed the know, which is this symbol of Australia, with a painter painting it into a panda, which, again, is this kind of commentary on the influence of China in Australia. So in general, it sounds like in your know, there's this blend of elements. It's like criticism of China, but also trying to get around the censorship regime in there to get your message out. Oh, by the way, actually, before we go on, let's just explain to people how you made the shift from wearing the mask to now revealing your identity, what happened at that time, and then I'll go to my next question.
00:11:55.528 - 00:12:40.746, Speaker C: I think it's so hard to keep anonymous. I managed to do it for seven years. But in 2018, I supposed to have a very large exhibition in Hong Kong, and we were inviting, like, Joshua Wong and Pussy Rides to the opening. However, just three days before the show, my family in Shanghai got taken by the police to the police station, the National Security Police. So it means my identity got compromised at some stage, and the message was sent to me via my family saying that I have to cancel the show, otherwise I will be in trouble. My family will be in trouble. Well, they also say they are going to send in the police to Hong Kong in 2018.
00:12:40.746 - 00:13:32.794, Speaker C: Now, Hong Kong is a very different city because the whole national Security Law. But in 2018, Hong Kong still has its freedom and autonomous. It is kind of unthinkable that the Chinese authority is saying they're going to sending police to Hong Kong so that makes everyone freaks out. And the show was actually canceled in 2018 but then the question was wrote to me obviously I can choose to stopping making art that I believe in. In exchange maybe I can have some extent of safety authority. A dictatorship like that they never forgive, they never forget. And also if I giving up the art that I've been working on years and years it's a betrayal to my own identity and I do value myself as an artist.
00:13:32.794 - 00:13:50.840, Speaker C: But the bottom line for artists I think is the freedom of speech is that I do not compromise because of some pressure, I do not draw red lines in the creation. So I decided to reveal my face after half a year and here I'm now how I look like.
00:13:52.170 - 00:14:33.474, Speaker B: So as I was saying earlier, you see these themes of kind of trying to stick it to the regime in China, getting around the censorship and also thinking about technology. I just love what you said about how the censorship regime is really built around the words and so using images is such a powerful and sneaky way to get your word out. So at some point, obviously you ended up turning to NFTs and now you've done two collections as NFTs. How did you stumble upon NFTs? What problem did you think that solved for you and why did you decide to issue some art as firstly, when.
00:14:33.512 - 00:15:46.780, Speaker C: I firstly hear about NFT, I think it's a great idea. I do not see it as a genre or style of art. For me, NFT is a form of ownership that kind of authorize a possibility of original digital art and for that it really opens the door to all art and artists. And however, I think now it really goes into a kind of weird end that when you think about NFT, it's not a diversified world, what do you think about it is those bought APAD and the boring collection just repeating itself. For me it's problematic. But the original, the possibility of NFT that authorize the digital original version or limited edition is actually opening door to all artists and all kind of art. And also I think with my collaboration with Humanized Foundation and particularly with Gray Area that give me a chance not just practice as an artist but also knowing or exploiting this technology to extending my platform from just traditional social media, street art gallery practice to a new community.
00:15:47.390 - 00:15:53.062, Speaker B: And Nikki, can you tell us a little bit more about Gray Area's role in helping him with the NFTs?
00:15:53.206 - 00:16:24.642, Speaker E: Yeah, I met Baratao or Gosh over a year ago and saw your work. That was in the last year's Freedom Forum in Miami. It was a series of posters and ones you see above me. And I had seen that year of doc and other work of yours. But I decided that that would probably be the best set for us to launch as an NFT collection. And you and I had a lot of discussions about how that could be made interesting or activist. Right, because many people are using NFTs for monetary gain.
00:16:24.642 - 00:17:14.530, Speaker E: They're not thinking about them in a way that they're protest pieces. But what we decided to do was do a custom contract, which means that we wrote our own blockchain contract where in which the participants who purchased an NFT, also the price was pretty inexpensive for them. They were allowed to write a message that was irrefutably written into the blockchain, a message of protest against the CPP. And so every single person who bought one of those NFTs, they minted them themselves. And that went into their crypto wallet and also on OpenSea. And those messages will live in China. This is my favorite part about what we did is, first of all, it was the first large mass protest action written into the blockchain, which is the tech stack that runs crypto and NFTs.
00:17:14.530 - 00:18:00.514, Speaker E: But the cool thing is that if China doesn't like something you do, for example, there is somebody who made a fake Baichow website that we try to take down and other things. They do all kinds of stuff to discredit Chow all the time, but they cannot turn off his artwork. They cannot turn off things that are listed into the blockchain because the blockchain, as you guys, if you went to any of the talks before this, all those Bitcoin talks, they were discussing how it's a bunch of servers all over the world. It's a decentralized server network. So you can shut off all the servers in China like they did. They shut down all the Bitcoin servers, but you can't shut off all the servers all over the world because they're everywhere. It's like playing Whack a Mole.
00:18:00.514 - 00:18:16.822, Speaker E: And so what we did was make something that was pretty impossible to stop and a message that can't be taken down. So I think that that was the power of what Chow did in having hundreds of people mint these NFTs and make protest messages against China.
00:18:16.966 - 00:18:20.614, Speaker B: And just out of curiosity, do you remember any of the messages that people wrote?
00:18:20.742 - 00:18:45.540, Speaker E: Yeah, there was a lot. I mean, some of them were just saying, solidarity to Chow. Take down China. There was some that were like longer and kind of poetic. But the issue is that they're actually written into the code. So you have to kind of go into Etherscan and click decode and then it will reveal the messages. But the value of them is that they are written into the code.
00:18:45.540 - 00:19:27.780, Speaker E: And also, like you were saying, they can't just scan them as language because of the way they're encoded. So it's a really cool tech stack. And I love the idea of Badassa using blockchain. I know one of your mentors and folks you've worked with before who I think did he win the Iweiwe? He was here for something, yeah. So he did a blockchain artwork protest Peace Pussy Ride also did an NFT series but nobody has done something like what Botticho just did. No one has done a protest message NFT collection. So it was a really exciting experience.

00:20:50.430 - 00:20:56.030, Speaker B: Ben, can you just talk a little bit about the artwork that you chose like what these images represent?
00:20:56.930 - 00:22:31.690, Speaker C: Sure. Probably in the very beginning of this year the most discussed China related topic is this winter Olympics is going to host in Beijing. A lot of us actually call it genocide Olympics because it really disgraces shame for the international community to allow in a country that have a genocide against wiggle community ongoing and still have this chance to celebrate humanity. So I decided to launch this kind of fake advertisement for the games using each of the sports but discussing about different human rights issues in China like the wager genocide, the Hong Kong cracking down, the suffer of Tibetans, the very censorship in the early stage of COVID-19. I think this is the thing that the people should know and also people should know it because it seems like it's inevitable the Olympic will be on, but at least we should use this as a opportunity to discussing those works. And this is not just NFT. It was firstly released in Miami last year in the Freedom Form then it has merged as street art, it has merged as posters all over the world, a lot of major cities and then the last step was also moving those works into the NFT world and also the difficulty is it's very hard to exhibiting those works in a conventional venue.
00:22:31.690 - 00:23:08.898, Speaker C: I just had a show in Prague last week, it's opening and the Chinese government is calling the museum as well as the Foreign Minister office of Czech Republic in order to kill the show. So this is the pressure that I'm facing in a conventional art venue. But obviously in the digital world on the blockchain, the gatekeeper is much lesser. I think the Chinese influence is much lesser. So in a way, that helped me to dodging all those censorship and easily creating a new community that introduced those very important message to new groups and peoples.
00:23:09.074 - 00:23:22.010, Speaker B: And do you have a sense of how much your art actually gets through to China and whether or not when you use the NFTs, if that had any kind of material impact on how easily people were able to see the images?
00:23:22.430 - 00:24:03.638, Speaker C: Well, I think it has two stages. Firstly is we need to make sure it's still online, it's still accessible, and for traditional platform, yes, I can put it on Twitter, on Instagram, on Facebook, even on Google, but we all know all those companies more or less have a history of compromise. Google has its Dragonfly project, facebook, come on. Mr. Mark Zagba is running in a Tiananmen Square and pretending he really enjoys the bloody kind of air on that massacre site. So it's not stable. I do not think the traditional even online space would be that safe.
00:24:03.638 - 00:24:13.950, Speaker C: But for me, I think the cryptocurrency world, the blockchain are providing some mechanism much stronger and safer than those conventional venues.
00:24:14.450 - 00:24:35.460, Speaker B: So there's one criticism of using NFTs in this way, which for those of you who understand the technology, actually what it is, is kind of this indelible pointer, but it's to a file that is stored elsewhere on the internet. And so just like any other file on the internet, it could technically be taken down. How did you address that issue?
00:24:36.150 - 00:25:28.786, Speaker E: Well, one thing we did was it goes to something called IPFS, and that is a file storage system. So the record of your NFT is pointing back to that. And actually, because Body Chowlike is really interested in open access, you actually gave the files on Twitter for anyone to print. So people all have print quality files already all over the internet. They've been distributed and people printed them. So one of the things I actually did for record holders and non holders, anyone who joined our discord was create links to files and send multiple links through, I think, Google Drive and other ways for them to download, like multiple. So, you know, a lot of the protest activity that is going on and just in general, like the crypto community and NFT community is going on through things like Signal, Discord, Telegram, Twitter.
00:25:28.786 - 00:26:20.498, Speaker E: So we are doing ad hoc and community organizing on the tech stack tools. And frankly, we're constantly jumping from tool to tool depending on what's safest. So we have a discord, we shared it through that. But also the other thing to keep in mind is that even if we lose the pointer to the actual file in China, the blockchain record with the protest statements are not images and they are in the blockchain and they can't be deleted. And even if China wants to say, oh, I'm going to take down Ether Scan, you guys remember if you were anyone of any certain age, like how we used to have like we still have but Pirate Bay and Torrents and all that stuff, and there'd always just be a new Pirate Bay. Pirate Bay, Dot, whatever, we could do the same thing. And the same thing does happen with Etherscan.
00:26:20.498 - 00:26:53.040, Speaker E: So they'll just make a new website that points to the same files again and again and again and again. So in a way, the value, like I said again, of blockchain is that it's almost impossible to take down the actual servers holding the things and then you can just keep making new domain pointers repeatedly from different locations to the same information, just like we've seen with Torrents. So I guess it matters, but it doesn't matter because it's so easy to distribute information using the technical tools we have today.
00:26:53.410 - 00:27:27.100, Speaker B: Yeah, because Ether Scan is basically just a website for looking at the Ethereum blockchain, which is of like you could sort of think of it as you could use Firefox or Chrome to look at some domain that you own or even the New York Times website or whatever. So, yeah, if either scan went down, no worries, somebody else will create some other block explorer. So you actually did a second campaign using NFTs. Can you talk about that and why you chose to do this? And it's slightly different.
00:27:27.630 - 00:28:16.054, Speaker C: The second drop was not that carefully planned because it's right start from the Ukraine war by the Russian invaders. So once the news outbreaks, I guess it's really haunting everyone around the world, especially the people in Europe. And I starting to making art alongside with the development of the invasion. And among the invasion, there are a lot of online means merged. Like this very famous sunflower seeds. The old lady like giving a handful of sunflower seeds to a Russian soldier said like, well, at least when you fall down here there will be sunflower popping out. So a lot of those very interesting and powerful elements has merged and become my inspiration.
00:28:16.054 - 00:28:56.646, Speaker C: And I created a body of new work that is dedicated to the fighters from Ukraine as well as denouncing the support from the Chinese government to put into war. And now this work has been released as NFT on the super rare as one on one works. And I'm going to donate all the profit from the selling to the people in Ukraine. I mean, because of the NFT technology, because the existing platform allow you to act this very fast. Imagine if you have to do an exhibition and then sell in an auction. It takes a long time, two weeks, one week.
00:28:56.748 - 00:29:09.194, Speaker E: Yeah, we did it in one week and we've already sold thousands of dollars in ethereum and we just sent one to what was the group we just sent it to that we were talking on Signal, right?
00:29:09.232 - 00:29:16.554, Speaker C: Actually Ukraine government have they posted their wallet to accepting cryptocurrency right on Twitter.
00:29:16.602 - 00:29:39.670, Speaker E: It'S like send us your money right here and we just worked with another aid group, we just sent another piece for auction from the collection and we did it in like a week and a half. That's unheard of in the art world and to make that kind of revenue directly going to aid someone and it was just me back and forth so it's pretty inspiring.
00:29:40.570 - 00:29:45.560, Speaker B: I love it, it's super interesting and do you plan to work with NFTs more in the future?
00:29:46.090 - 00:30:50.350, Speaker C: Definitely I think well now I guess most of people are kind of worried the market is crashing but I think the ones crashing are those boring monkey heads. It's kind of a good thing, I mean yeah, well this evolves and then at the end of the day you should see what's really valuable and meaningful. I mean buying NFT is almost like buying two things. One is you're buying a piece of art, an image. So firstly you should understand the value of the art. For me, I think political art and art about our time particularly important because of course there are art for the sake of art, there are art exploring the sensory beauty but there are also a history of world art that is talking about the most important issue in the time. It is like a footnote that of our history and because of a certain regime like China they're deleting almost every existing footnote and then art become one of the voices can be left it.
00:30:50.350 - 00:32:22.522, Speaker C: So that is why political art particularly has its value. And secondly for NFT and because all the things that we've discussed on the online censorship and everything that makes political art very rare and it makes it very hard to be purchased in conventional venues like galleries. Because the chinese government could just call and cancel the show and then it makes the NFT probably is the most valuable platform and way for political artists to uploading and make this into a collectible artwork. So I'm not here just to calling help to the political artists who are trying to ft I also want to shelling to the people and the collectors that you need to learn about art, you need to learn about why political art will be important and valuable in the longer term. Yes, you should earn some money by flipping with monkey hats but you should also think about diversify your investment, think about some blue ribbon stocks which will be the political art. I mean let's imagine after 20 years you have to explain to your grandchildren that what you collect as NFT. Do you have to say that oh, you know, Justin Bieber have that monkey hat so that's very valuable and important.
00:32:22.522 - 00:32:55.170, Speaker C: Then you. Have to go through the whole trouble to explain who Justin Bieber is. But imagine if you collect something that recording the changing time of our world, that recording the brutality of one of the most powerful country like China, and foreseeing the change which is coming, then it will be much valuable and easy to explain to your grandchildren. So for the sake of a future, try to diversify your investment, not just monkey heads.
00:32:55.930 - 00:32:56.342, Speaker D: Great.
00:32:56.396 - 00:33:00.120, Speaker B: So we started quite late. Does anybody have any questions?
00:33:01.210 - 00:33:19.738, Speaker D: What if you're not a formal artist, but enjoy doing art on the side and then decided to post an NFT? What's the rationale behind that? If there's a project you're working on but don't have a platform, but just doing it for fun or just want to get started?
00:33:19.904 - 00:34:04.826, Speaker C: I think platform is always a problem for not just political arts, for any merchant artists. And what NFT providing is a platform, a showcase as well, but also a possible way to help you financially. So why not try that? I think the most important thing is, as artists, you should be faithful and truthful to your art. Do not just create art that can be sold on NFT platform. Do your own art, put it on the NFT. That's how you be truthful as an artist. But that's also how you can help the NFT market to not just making the same standard work and make it an interesting and diversified word as any artwork outside of the digital space.
00:34:04.928 - 00:34:08.634, Speaker D: But what if you're truthful to your art, see if it does well and.
00:34:08.672 - 00:34:18.890, Speaker C: Then keep replicating that, then you're a businessman, you're not an artist. Artists have to do new works. Yeah, that's my understanding.
00:34:19.050 - 00:35:07.310, Speaker E: The other thing I would say is, if you do well, let's say you minted NFT and you do well. One of the most important things about the NFT community of artists that I've been part of for a little while is that you support other artists. So using your voice, your platform and your energy to tweet, retweet, repost, share the work of others and buy their work. I know this is like a very blockchain heavy conference, but Tezos and Hickeyunk, which is now defunct, but that community of artists on that chain, which, by the way, it's like $2 to buy a Tezos. So it's much more affordable and a great entry point for new artists. They are all about we're all about retweeting buying. And there's a movement called Object for Object or Tezos for Tezos to retweet buy and share the work of others.
00:35:07.310 - 00:35:35.400, Speaker E: And particularly diverse groups, women, people of color, queer people making sure that you're creating a space for the voices of not just the Hegemony or whatever, the mainstream, like Bottle Chow saying the monkey heads, but know diverse people and amplifying their voice, using your power to do that. So if you do suddenly get power, use that power. Share retweet bottle, everybody. It's all about collective action and NFTs are no different.
00:35:36.010 - 00:35:41.020, Speaker C: But just share the work you like. Don't share the work for their support.
00:35:42.030 - 00:36:17.270, Speaker F: So I'm really curious as we're making this movement from NFTs as revenue for artists who are operating commercially into the realm of political artists who are raising money for causes socially engaged artists who are raising money for communities they're working in. What you've seen out there in the world and what you're thinking through this experience about revenue split models that can benefit artists who also need support while supporting communities that they are caring for, want to stand up for and what you've seen out there.
00:36:17.420 - 00:37:16.726, Speaker C: So for me, because I am not an NFT artist, I can only talk through my little experience as political artists. The censorship does not just coming from you do not have chance to exhibiting, but also the collector will have hesitated buyer work because once the financial record reveal who they are, they will be revenged by the Chinese government. But NFT and Blockchain was providing this possibility for buying things anonymously at least. It's very hard to tell or trace. So that definitely opening supporters and in that way, it actually supporting young artists like me. And for me personally, what I really want to achieve in the future is somehow establish this platform to encouraging merchant artists like myself when? 510 years ago. Because when I started making political art, it's really no money and no support, no platform.
00:37:16.726 - 00:37:40.720, Speaker C: And I only insist and continue this work because somehow, sometimes someone helped me give me a hand. So I do think it's very necessary to actually establish this platform dedicate to political art, dedicate to art that serve in a community and kind of bringing them together as a way to support each other.
00:37:42.770 - 00:37:55.140, Speaker B: All right, well, I think that's everything. Thank you all so much for coming. Thank you to Bobby Town. Have a great rest of your forum. It.
