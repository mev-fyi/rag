00:00:00.840 - 00:00:20.874, Speaker A: Hi all. I'm excited to launch our new crypto and macro podcast, bits and Bips today. It's in the fun conversational style that I know many of you enjoy. And we have a great set of hosts with different backgrounds across both crypto and tradfi. It'll come out every other week on Wednesdays to give the scoop on the latest news and how crypto and macro are coming together. Let us know what you think of the show.
00:00:21.374 - 00:00:37.450, Speaker B: Alex, where do you think we are in the cycle right now? We had a ripper of a Q one. We had a pretty big draw in April. May seems to be some recovery. Where's your head at as it relates to the cycle right now?
00:00:37.522 - 00:01:01.904, Speaker C: I think it's a different kind of cycle, to be honest. I'm on the super cycle boat, so people like to hate about that, but it just makes sense. On one hand, the thing is, on the macro side of things, on macroeconomics, the global economy is what you could call early stage. This could be something like the nineties and we're like 1997.
00:01:05.644 - 00:01:30.720, Speaker A: Hi everyone. Welcome to Bits and Bips, exploring how crypto and macro collide one basis point at a time. I'm your host, James Seyffert tradfi Archmaester Lord of Bloomberg's end, here with Alex Kruger. Kruger, macro of House Asgard, protector of the Realm, and Joe McCann, lord commander of asymmetric and master of Banq. We're here to discuss the latest stories in the worlds of crypto and macro news. Just remember that nothing we say here is investment advice. Check unchained crypto.com
00:01:30.720 - 00:01:46.814, Speaker A: for more disclosures. Let's get into it. Alex and Joe, you guys are both portfolio managers, traders. This last week we had a fed meeting. We had some other economic reports, non farm payrolls. What were your takeaways? I guess we'll start with you, Joe, and then go over to Alex.
00:01:47.154 - 00:02:33.812, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So, I mean, Wednesday I thought was pretty clear what Jerome Powell was articulating and communicating to you directly. He's literally saying, you know, more or less, there's no stagflation, there's no chance of more hikes. I don't want to say no chance. There's very few slim chance of hikes going forward. Um, and, you know, because what they did with their actions of, of moving the, um, the balance sheet tapering down from 60 billion to $25 billion a month, that's a net improvement of $35 billion of liquidity on a monthly basis. It's, it's just doesn't make any sense for him to be hawkish at his press conference if they're tapering their balance sheet reduction.
00:02:33.812 - 00:03:30.224, Speaker B: Um, so, you know, our view, and my view, I guess, uh, has been for quite some time that employment data is actually the most important thing for determining if and when the Fed will have coverage to actually start cutting rates. And this kind of leads into the NFP report that came out early Friday. Well, lo and behold, you saw a tick up in the unemployment rate and a miss on NFP. And almost instantaneously you saw two rate cuts get priced into the Fed funds futures curve. Right. So from my perspective, this is kind of what I've been expecting for quite some time, is that, yes, inflation is important and if the Fed has a dual mandate. Right, but the employment data has just been so strong for so long that the Fed has literally signals, the FOMC more broadly, has literally signaled that we want to cut rates at some point.
00:03:30.224 - 00:04:24.304, Speaker B: This kind of gives them, I guess, a reason to. And so, you know, the, I think, I think that what you saw also in price action on Friday was indicative of that. Like the day of the Fed, bitcoin finally cracked fifty nine k and a brutal washout, if you will, that had fallen from the last day of April, which appears to effectively be the bottom, based on what happened with the macro last week, particularly with the Fed. And so I think that there's probably a good chance, based on what happened with the price action on Friday, which is a full, more or less reversal in risk. But also, more importantly, the dollar is topping out, has topped out, started to reverse pretty heavily, started to see fixed income get bid. This all suggests, at least from my perspective, the end of the feds tightening and also a strong US dollar cycle.
00:04:24.604 - 00:04:55.476, Speaker A: Steven? Yeah, I mean, you said NFP there a few times. Just so anyone who doesn't know that's just non farm payrolls. It's basically just looking at employment data that we're getting from here. And you also talk about tapering. The thing there was that he said that basically they were going to decrease the amount of bonds that they were, or debt assets that they were unloading onto the market. So that should be more liquidity, I guess, which we all know bitcoin and crypto love anything that pumps liquidity. So, Alex, anything different from Joe, in your point of view, or anything to add?
00:04:55.500 - 00:05:42.354, Speaker C: Alex? No, I actually see things, unfortunately, very, very similarly. I say unfortunately because it would be fun to, to disagree and are you here? But yeah, it's pretty much the same view. The bottom is very likely in. Powell has signaled very, very effectively and clearly that he's not concerned with inflation the way some people in the market want to be concerned about personally. Something else I would like to add is that more important than actually we get one cat or two cats or three or whatever? More important is there's two things. One is the direction, the fact that the direction is down. And secondly, the fact that we have a Fed put basically something that's been in place since December.
00:05:42.354 - 00:06:15.140, Speaker C: Basically, the moment back in December was the moment in which the Fed, before MC via Powell, told us very, very clearly that they are equally concerned about employment and inflation, which was not the case basically since January of 2022. That basically means that if things go bad, there is a put. The put basically means the head is going to cover our losses and ensure that markets don't implode.
00:06:15.332 - 00:06:33.384, Speaker A: Real quick, I just pulled up to echo what you're saying. This is showing what Joe and you were hinting at, that basically the markets now are expecting one to two cuts. You can see these orange lines are just basically the, the number of cuts that we're expecting. So you can see by January, pretty much the market is expecting at least 225 basis point cuts.
00:06:33.684 - 00:07:11.950, Speaker C: And the other thing I'd like to add is that it's all one trade. Now. This is something new that we just started seeing now is bitcoin for actually all of 23, or most of 23 did its own thing, kind of like correlated on a very zoomed out basis. But you zoom in and it's doing entirely its own thing. And this started changing recently with Israel and Iran. And we saw it very clearly last week. FOMC and payrolls, it traded hand in hand with equities, which in my humble opinion, many people disagree.
00:07:11.950 - 00:07:32.090, Speaker C: But if you're bullish on equities and risk assets, this is very good because it means that. And if you think that there is a fed put this is very good because it means equities won't collapse. Therefore, the probability, always talking improbabilities of bitcoin actually doing its own thing and imploding 80% becomes very dim.
00:07:32.202 - 00:08:22.856, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, I agree. Another thing to point out as it relates to some of the macro stuff, over the course of the entire month of April, actually heading into the end of March, we started to see global liquidity actually pull back. This is not just, say, the Fed or just the bank of China. This is the shadow monetary system. This is the volatility index associated with treasuries, as known as the move index. All these things come together with the various central banks kind of restricting and reversing the q one advance, if you will, of global liquidity. And for those who may not necessarily understand the value or the purpose behind why global liquidity is so important, is that when you have more liquidity in a system, it tends to juice risk assets.
00:08:22.856 - 00:08:55.352, Speaker B: Now, when you have a strong dollar, um, you know, sometimes those risk assets will not sort of rise as high as they possibly could. However, one of the things that's happened in, just in the past, uh, kind of week plus, certainly last week, uh, was, uh, the japanese yen, the dollar yen trade got up to 100, 160, which was the 1990 high. So we're talking whatever, I don't know, however many years. That is a lot. I am not a mathematician. Um, it's a long time ago, right? 33 years or something. 34 years, something to that effect.
00:08:55.352 - 00:09:28.632, Speaker B: Right. And at that moment, the Ministry of finance intervened and smashed the yen shorts from 160 down to 153, which is a major move in foreign exchange. Like this isn't crypto, this is a market trades $4 trillion a day. And a move the yen like that is, is remarkable. And more importantly, on April 29, we actually had the second highest net short interest in the yen ever. So it was almost perfect time to squeeze the shorts. And the Ministry of Finance in Japan certainly did that.
00:09:28.632 - 00:10:18.714, Speaker B: And they also did it again a couple of days later. And the reason this is important to Alexs point, at least from my perspective, is it being all one trade, is that we have actually seen emerging market effects, certainly Asia effects, EM effects. So these are your India rupee, the thai bot, the south korean won, et cetera, et cetera. These kind of like, call them smaller developed, developed or developing economies currencies. They've just gotten decimated by the us dollar, including the chinese yuan. And all of that is reversing post FOMC and certainly post NFP. And this is, I think, very, very, very important because we have some precedents of this that occurred back in 2016.
00:10:18.714 - 00:10:48.494, Speaker B: Janet Yellen was the head of the Fed at the time. She flew out to Shanghai in late February, and the same sort of thing was happening. You had sort of EMFX getting kind of unfairly affected by the us dollar. She was talking about hiking rates. Rates were zero then. Remember the gory days? And China basically nuked the us stock market by devaluing the currency. And so she had to go back there and kind of like, lets all get together and figure out something.
00:10:48.494 - 00:11:42.932, Speaker B: Now, you cant find anything official about this. Its called the Shanghai Accord, but it happened one way or the other because it actually marked the tick lows in the S and P and the dollar weekend. Well, she was in Southeast Asia a few weeks ago, about a month ago. And since then, what weve noticed is a pretty dramatic shift, certainly in the past couple of weeks of Asia affects currencies and their values relative to the US dollar. So the long story short here is from my perspective, you're getting a repeat of the Shanghai accord. Again, whether or not that actually took place, the market is suggesting that. And when you have basically a bottom in the yen and you have a bottom in the chinese yuan and other emerging markets currencies, that means that tends to imply a weaker dollar.
00:11:42.932 - 00:12:36.590, Speaker B: And when you have a weaker dollar, to Alex's point, you have a better chance of things all being one trade because people are going to have less, you know, holding the dollar is less desirable, at least from a short term to intermediate trading perspective. And so what's the furthest thing out on the risk curve? Well, it's crypto. So bitcoin should do well in this type of an environment, assuming that the dollar strength has actually kind of come to its end. And I think it has, especially given what the Fed has stated going forward, I think you have to be looking at how the dollar trades towards these other currencies and use that as a proxy for how to evaluate how much money will flow into risk assets. Two more really quick things. One, there's actually flows now heading into Asia, Hong Kong and China, particularly for the first time in months. So we have net flows into investment dollars into those areas.
00:12:36.590 - 00:13:06.794, Speaker B: And then last night, so it's Monday today, so late Sunday night, early Monday, I guess China time at a 300 pips move in the yuan, which is an enormous move for the foreign exchange currency, especially something like yuan. So there appears to be the market sniffing this out that the dollar's reign, at least in the intermediate to immediate term, has kind of paused. And this is, in my opinion, incredibly bullish for risk assets.
00:13:08.654 - 00:13:15.278, Speaker A: For those of us who are not fully in the macro world. What was that? Did you say Pitts trade? What was that number you used?
00:13:15.326 - 00:13:24.654, Speaker B: Pips. So pip, it's kind of like how a satoshi is the unit of a bitcoin. It's like that for foreign exchange when you're trading it.
00:13:24.774 - 00:13:26.514, Speaker A: So even smaller than bips.
00:13:26.934 - 00:13:27.574, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:13:27.694 - 00:13:53.602, Speaker A: Yeah. All right. Well, one, I hope you're right, because I do have a trip this fall going to Europe, so I'd appreciate some of that, to be quite honest. This honestly echoes things for me from like 2013, when I first joined the industry. The number one ETF in the world back then was the was wisdom trees Japan equity hedged ETF, which basically shorted the yen and went long. Yen companies, japanese companies. And it was on fire.
00:13:53.602 - 00:14:02.832, Speaker A: It absolutely took over the ETF world. Kind of giving me a flashback to that. Before we move on, Alex, you have anything else left on macro on that side of things?
00:14:02.848 - 00:14:56.146, Speaker C: Alex, on the yen, I just wanted to add one thing that I think is maybe interesting for people is the fact that when the yen was basically plummeting, dollar yen going up, right, there is this tendency among traders, circles and the media to basically find a reason to just panic about anything. In this case, the thing is actually dollar yen. The yen weakening is actually in the benefit of Japan because weaker yen basically means that Japan is importing inflation. Wages go higher, eventually inflation expectations go higher, which is actually happening. And this is exactly what Japan has been trying to achieve for over two decades. So it's kind of like they want this. What they don't want is volatility and the depreciation or appreciation of the currency.
00:14:56.146 - 00:15:14.654, Speaker C: That's what they care about a lot, is keeping volume rather subdued. But it's not really the yen plummeting that hasn't getting concerned. It's actually, they actually want it, or maybe not wanted, but it's beneficial for them.
00:15:15.474 - 00:15:54.564, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, it makes things that we get as Americans and others from Japan a lot cheaper for us to get. Exposure to those assets helps those, any companies that export. So I guess we'll move on a little bit to a little bit more. My area of specialty real quickly on Ethereum ETF's levered future Ethereum ETF's, there's been a bunch that have been filed, we're almost a month in since they were filed. Typically when these futures ETF's, they go through a different process than spot bitcoin ETF's. When these levered futures ETF's are filed, it's this other process. And usually when the SEC isn't going to allow something under this process, rule six C eleven, which we don't really need to get into, it's a special ETF rule.
00:15:54.564 - 00:16:18.602, Speaker A: But usually what the SEC will do is they'll be like, all right, you have to withdraw this. We're not allowing this through. This isn't going to happen. And you just see people just withdraw en masse. What happened with the first Ethereum futures ETF's is volatility. Shares and others basically said they were going to run the red light, and if the SEC wanted to stop them, they were going to have to sue them. And the SEC likely knew that they were going to lose because they were already in the, at that time, they were going to lose the grayscale.
00:16:18.602 - 00:16:53.954, Speaker A: So that means to us that we're a month in, it seems likely that we're going to see levered Ethereum futures ETF's. And the question I've been getting all week and the week before is like, well, if those are going to be approved and we're going to talk about the Hong Kong ETF's and that's happening, doesn't that mean that, like, the spot Ethereum ETF's are going to get approved here? So you're going to see delays for other ETF's here, for spot Ethereum. The deadline, the only deadline that matters is May 23, 24th for Vanek and Ark. That's the equivalent of the spot bitcoin ETF rate, which was the January 10 deadline. Um, we're like 1015 percent odds of these things going through. It's just not going to happen. There's been no movement.
00:16:53.954 - 00:17:00.342, Speaker A: We just think that these things are likely to be denied. I don't know if you guys have a different view there.
00:17:00.518 - 00:17:20.913, Speaker C: Curious. Like wanted to interrupt and ask you what, what do you think if you had to say, what is the most likely high for an ETH ETF to be approved? Spot one? Right. When would that be? Sometime in 25. Would it require new applications, that kind of thing?
00:17:21.373 - 00:17:45.373, Speaker A: Yeah, so, I mean, what we saw with this about bitcoin ETF's and what we're going to see here is they're going to get, as I said, I think they're going to be denied. And just like this, by bitcoin ETF's, everyone just refiles. We have some that aren't due until November. Like, bitwise is one of the last ones to enter, and they're not due until the end of November for a decision. I mean, you have to take a step. I don't think these things are going to get through until 2025. I'd say by the end of 2025, I think it could happen.
00:17:45.373 - 00:18:18.182, Speaker A: That said, if the SEC goes out and like, as the, we, we can talk about the consensus lawsuit real quick if we want, but basically, consensus is suing, going out and proactively suing the SEC, trying to get clarity on the fact that they believe the SEC thinks ethereum is a security. So basically, the SEC has three options here, coming up on May 23, they either approve, which, as I just said, not unlikely to happen, right. Or they find some other reason to deny these things or kick the can down the road further. I think that's what they're going to do. I think that's what they're going to do. I think they might use correlations to do that, but there's no way to know for sure. I think it's basically going to be a word salad.
00:18:18.182 - 00:18:42.518, Speaker A: Legal jargon. Uh, might be something that they like, particularly if it's correlation and it's fact based. Like, I don't think anyone can bring a lawsuit the way that grayscale did on bitcoin. So then all of a sudden, you just need the data to prove that the SEC's argument then doesn't matter. Which I think the data, if you look at the correlation data by the. By this time next year, by early 2025, the correlation will be strong enough, even stronger than the bitcoin ets when they were approved. So that falls to the wayside.
00:18:42.518 - 00:18:46.194, Speaker A: The third option is just denying saying it's a security.
00:18:47.294 - 00:19:09.206, Speaker C: I gotta say, it's crazy. The emphasis on correlation that has been placed. I mean, it's absolutely insane. The year is 2024, and we're talking about this thing. It's insane that it was such a big driver for the bitcoin ETF. And I'm saying this because the futures and spot series are quite integrated. They're kind of like the same series driven by the same thing.
00:19:09.206 - 00:19:13.554, Speaker C: So, of course, the correlation is going to be almost perfect almost all the time.
00:19:14.434 - 00:19:49.538, Speaker A: Yeah. So, like, I've gone in the weeds pretty deep on this correlation stuff. What you need to realize is Gensler and the SSE were backed into a corner, as far as I'm concerned. Even the democratic commissioners, Caroline Crenshaw, and I'm blanking the other one, they still dissented. They didn't want to approve bitcoin ETF's, but Gary had to, like, all right, we need to find a way that we can approve this. And they came up with this correlation analysis in their approval letter, and, like, the last three years, has been sufficiently correlated between futures markets and spot markets. But as you said, Alex, like anyone in these markets know, like, that's just kind of bonkers in a way, because the futures price is determined off of the underlying spot price based on a bunch of exchanges.
00:19:49.538 - 00:20:17.362, Speaker A: So it's literally like an index that's based off underlying spot markets that determine the price of futures. So, like, they are co integrated as you said this argument is wild. The problem is the futures themselves didn't really trade enough. You go back three years, they weren't trading enough. So if you look by minute by minute correlations, or every five minute and like five minute candles, the correlation's all wonky. It's not great because there just weren't trades. But when anytime there is trades, there's like a near 99% correlation between futures and spot.
00:20:17.362 - 00:20:39.266, Speaker A: The argument the SEC would make is like, well, if theyre not trading, then we cant detect any manipulations that happen in the spot market. But anytime there is trade. So my recommendation would be just make sure every time theres a minute that goes by and a futures contract doesnt trade, just trade it. And all of a sudden the SEC loses the argument. So I think theyre going to lean on something like that. It might not necessarily be exactly that. I think theyre just going to look for to kick the can down the road a little bit further.
00:20:39.266 - 00:21:13.714, Speaker A: And consensys is trying to force them into a corner. Theres a lot of people trying to push them into a corner on declaring whether ETH is security or not. One of my pet theories is I think that the SEC, I don't think they'll be able to call Eth the security. In many ways that would put them at odds with the CFTC. They have complete opposite stance. So I wonder if they're going to try to thread some needle and basically say that staked ETH specifically is a security and regular ethnic, which, again, I'm not saying that's a logical way to look at things, but I think that's something that they're trying to do. I also think that Genzo and SSE likely, no, they're going to lose some of these lawsuits.
00:21:14.304 - 00:22:03.104, Speaker B: Do you think that there's, do you think the lack of institutional interest in Ethereum is having an effect here? I mean, let me kind of like walk you through my hypothesis here. Right. Like GBDC was more or less the way to kind of get exposure to bitcoin from an exchange traded product sense for the most part. Yes, I know there's futures and all that kind of thing, right. But there's also ethe. And if you look at the aums of each of those, call it pre spot approval, bitcoin, ETF spot approval, it's like a fraction of bitcoin. And if you talk to a lot of folks in tradfi, which I'm sure you do, James, I know Alex and I do as well.
00:22:03.104 - 00:22:56.380, Speaker B: When they think of crypto they think there's interest in bitcoin. There has been interest in bitcoin, right. And that's the stuff that you see folks like Tom Lee at Fundstrat have been talking about for a long time. Yes, they start, fundstrack covers other cryptocurrencies as well, but it just feels like there was this sort of obvious pent up demand institutionally for this product. And yes, you have Blackrock, and yes, you have all of these other, you know, call them conspiracy theories or not as to why the bitcoin ETF would get approved, but from my anecdotal experience speaking with folks in trad five, particularly asset managers or PM or portfolio managers, like, there just isn't a ton of interest as it relates to Ethereum. And do you think this is true or is this, does this have any influence on like part of the reason why you guys have like a 10% approval chance in late?
00:22:56.412 - 00:23:17.128, Speaker A: Maybe it doesn't have much of an impact, to be honest. Actually, no matter what, even if there was immense demand, I don't think it would matter. Interestler basically is only going to do it when he's forced to, it seems like. And basically that's what happened with Grayscale and the bitcoin ETF's. That said, I wholeheartedly agree with you. I mean, you don't even need to look at just ETH. You can look at the ETH futures ETF's launch.
00:23:17.128 - 00:23:39.372, Speaker A: Like you probably don't even remember it happening. It happened in early October and we thought our argument was that it was going to be a dude. So I thought it was going to be a dud and it was even more of a dud than I expected. Right. So basically no one really even cared. And I thought maybe it was because they were expecting spot to come, because we think spot bitcoin, no one really likes futures. ETF's for the most part.
00:23:39.372 - 00:24:04.818, Speaker A: They're inefficient. They have to roll. There's a lot of inefficiencies there, right? But no matter how you slice it, when you talk to people, I talk to advisors at these different conferences, they just get the idea of like a digital alternative to gold that makes more sense. Even if it's like a 5 million times more volatile than gold and what have you, there's just this overwhelming, like understanding there of they're just. I don't see the same interest for true Defi on the Ethereum world.
00:24:04.986 - 00:24:09.746, Speaker B: Could you imagine trying to explain to a baby boomer the Ethereum roadmap and why you should buy the futures.
00:24:09.770 - 00:24:13.574, Speaker C: ETF is the world's supercomputer, right?
00:24:14.034 - 00:24:35.410, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. I have another stat for you, though, ironically. So, like the go into Hong Kong ETF's, the Hong Kong just launched spot bitcoin, ethereum ETF's. They're allowing in kind and cash us. We only have cash, but in Hong Kong, you're going to be allowed to, like, exchange the underlying asset, Ethereum bitcoin, for shares of the ETF, which is huge. Everyone was talking about how this was going to be a massive launch.
00:24:35.410 - 00:24:48.002, Speaker A: It honestly wasn't that big of a dud. It kind of was. On a trading side of things, it didn't trade all that much, but to give you some numbers. So I've argued. So I think. Do you know the number? What's Ethereum's market cap as a percentage of bitcoin? 30 something percent. Right.
00:24:48.002 - 00:24:49.516, Speaker A: Right around 30. Is that about right?
00:24:49.650 - 00:24:54.032, Speaker B: You guys know, I think mid twenties, you're somewhere in that ballpark. Yeah.
00:24:54.088 - 00:25:24.174, Speaker A: So, like, my view is, like, I think whatever the interest is in spot bitcoin, I think the interest for spot eth will be, like, less. So when I last looked, it was 30%. So I was arguing we'd see 15% to 20% of the demand for ETh. My boss thinks it's going to be 10% or less because he's not paying attention to space really much at all, unless it's in the ETF world and he's just not hearing any interest. But if you look at the Hong Kong one, so they launched in the same day. So far they've been trading. There was a holiday last week, so it was a bit of a dud, so you can't pay attention too much to the volume.
00:25:24.174 - 00:25:54.846, Speaker A: But as a percentage trading, the ethereum ETF's in Hong Kong are about 15% to 16% of the total trading volume, but the assets are about 20%. So we have about $267 million in the bitcoin ETF's there and about 55 million in Ethereum ETF. So it's not a complete wash, it's not completely nothing. It's just the people thinking that this was going to be a massive multibillion dollar market immediately, in the way that the US was. Just didn't really understand the size of the markets here. I mean, the US spot bitcoin ETF's are about 50 billion in assets. The entire Hong Kong market is less than that.
00:25:54.846 - 00:26:17.514, Speaker A: Every ETF, not just these crypto ones. That said, these things are trading heavily compared to their market, they're doing exceptionally well for their market. It's just like, you can't control. You can't compare a market that's $47 billion in size to a US ETF market that is nearly 9 trillion in size. It's literally all the orders of magnitude. It's not really comparable.
00:26:17.974 - 00:26:25.806, Speaker B: You mean to tell me that the people on crypto Twitter sometimes get ahead of their skis on things? No, that's insane, dude.
00:26:25.870 - 00:26:53.492, Speaker A: Yeah, well, the other problem is these things aren't going to be available to mainland chinese investors. There are stock connects out there and different things like that. There are a few ETF's that are on there, but it's hard to get on there. I think there's only six or seven ETF's in those stock connect programs. One, it takes a long time for that to happen. From what my colleagues in Asia, who are covering this a lot more closely than I am, they're literally based in Hong Kong. They see, like, no, there's no timeline for when they think these things could even be available to mainland chinese investors.
00:26:53.492 - 00:27:01.012, Speaker A: The one difference is, like, I guess if Xi Jinping decides that he wants mainland chinese investors to have access to these things, it'll happen immediately.
00:27:01.148 - 00:27:13.414, Speaker B: Alex, weren't you. I thought, I feel like you were way out in front of the Hong Kong thing being like a total nothing burger, and it wasn't gonna affect anything, was that you were, you were out on, you are way out in front of this. Right. Why did you have that view?
00:27:15.274 - 00:27:46.786, Speaker C: By speaking to people from Hong Kong, basically in Beijing that work in crypto there, and the view that I got that it made total sense for me was that a couple of things. One is the two things. The first one is Hong Kong investors. They already have access to us ETF's. In fact, I think we checked the other day. We saw the other day that if we look at the. The top holders of ibit, the number one guy or the number two guy is a Hong Kong counterparty, so they already have access to us ETF's.
00:27:46.786 - 00:28:29.650, Speaker C: So why Hong Kong EtF's? Unless you need to have it denominated in Hong Kong dollars. And the other one was that the 401K industry or the 401 ks and pensions in Hong Kong is tiny. So that is not there anymore. But anyhow, something I wanted to add here. It's just an interesting data point. It's not precise, but I recall looking at ETF's, launching an ETF and what it would take to basically break even the number was about 30 million in AUM dollars to basically break even. So at 50 mil, you're doing very well.
00:28:29.650 - 00:28:32.614, Speaker C: And all the us ones, they're all doing extremely well.
00:28:33.544 - 00:28:54.444, Speaker A: The manager, yeah, they're all doing just fine. I mean, it depends on the fee that you're charging and like, who your partners are and stuff like that. But for the most part, our rule of thumb is if you're over 50, you're probably doing at least okay. And if you're over 100, you're almost certainly making money, unless you're in some, like something that's costing you a real ton of money, like GBTC.
00:28:55.744 - 00:29:10.194, Speaker B: Well, actually, James, that brings up a good point. I mean, I think Grayscale recently announced some like, lower fee options option, bitcoin, ETF through grayscale. Have you guys looked into that at all? And what the difference is there?
00:29:10.814 - 00:29:41.592, Speaker A: They're going to launch a GPC mini trust. And actually I have proof from three years ago arguing that this is what grayscale should do. They're doing a little differently. My argument was they should cut the fee a little bit when they launch GBTC and then just keep it relatively high, like keep it way above the market and then launch a competing mini product, which is something we've seen ETF's issuers do a bunch in the past. So basically they become these liquidity kings. Everyone uses them. There's people that are trapped in them for capital gains reasons if they're in taxable accounts and the money will just stay there and they can milk those fees.
00:29:41.592 - 00:30:08.280, Speaker A: But when then what they'll do, rather than letting other people cannibalize their own assets, they'll be like, all right, we're just going to launch a very similar product at literally a fraction of the cost. And then we'll let people, if they're going to leave our stuff, hopefully they'll stay with us and they'll go to other product and we can attract flow so that other cheaper product can still compete. What they're doing is unique and something I have never seen before in this way is they're launching a GBDC minitrust. It's going to be ticker BTC. I think the fee they said is 0.15%. Don't quote me on that. Exactly.
00:30:08.280 - 00:30:38.030, Speaker A: And like 10% of GBTC's assets are just going to spin off directly into that thing. So that's a way to. Basically they're funding this mini trust. They're giving people who have stuck with them a long time what will be the lowest cost ETF product for bitcoin in the world, actually, I guess there's technically zero fee ones, but they're lending out bitcoin and stuff in Europe, but the lowest cost one in the US at the very least. So it's a very unique strategy. They're trying to keep people, and then we'll see how it plays out for them long term. But I think it's a smart move long term.
00:30:38.030 - 00:30:56.368, Speaker A: I mean, if the way to think about everyone's like, they need to lower the fee is one they do. They've seen a lot of. I'm going to show a chart of their outflows, but it's been brutal for them. This chart is just absolutely insane. Um, but at the same time, if you're making. If you're used to making. So 2% fees and you cut to 150 bps, or 1.5%,
00:30:56.368 - 00:31:24.404, Speaker A: that's a lot to, like, cut. Like, let's go in from two hundred k a year to year, let alone going down to 15,000 a year, which is what 15 bps is, which is what they're doing with this GBTC mini trust. So they're basically just trying to make sure they keep the revenue up without coming belly up. And as you see, that's been brutal for them. But on the end there, you can see that little green blip. So in the bottom chart of those bars, that's GBTC finally saw an inflow on Friday. We saw basically every ETF across the board see inflows on Friday.
00:31:24.404 - 00:31:53.324, Speaker A: Even despite that, you were talking about the outflows and things getting hammered midweek. The ETF saw over 400 million in outflows last week, even with the Friday inflow. So last week was brutal for the bitcoin ETF's, but they operated exactly as they're supposed to. They basically gave you exposure to the underlying asset. And anytime demand and supply were outstripped in one way or the other, we end up with inflows and outflows, and they've been operating very smoothly.
00:31:53.744 - 00:32:32.948, Speaker B: Yeah, I love this one green blip here on the histogram. Everybody I know in bitcoin and crypto has just been hating on grayscale for so long because of how punishing they have been to the bid side of the order book. And here we go. The week that we have a break of 59k, they run the stops down to 56 and a half. And I think it was like 500 million plus in outflows on May 1, the day of the Fed. On Friday, you have the NFP print cuts get priced back into the market. And GBTC actually has inflows.
00:32:32.948 - 00:32:51.374, Speaker B: I mean, you can't make this stuff up. This is only possible in a place like crypto, where the kind of villain forever is now seen as almost a hero. Right when the bottom is in, I will say bottom and air quotes, just because you know where we're trading today as opposed to on Wednesday last week, May 1.
00:32:52.074 - 00:33:16.738, Speaker A: Yeah, I would also add that I was talking about how efficiently they were operating. There is this one unique thing Bloomberg actually wrote about at Bloomberg News. And they got this kind of got things wrong. You can see that there was this massive discount when all that selling was happening. But the way that only really happened because of the way that these ETF's and their nav is calculated. So the underlying value, the bitcoin, is calculated over a time weighted average from 03:00 p.m. to 04:00 p.m.
00:33:16.738 - 00:33:46.216, Speaker A: because that's how the CME bitcoin futures market works. The CF benchmarks bitcoin rate. And so what happened is bitcoin was just tanking every single day. So basically it was starting 03:00 at one price and ending 04:00 at another price. And it made it look like there was these discounts and all these ETF's were mispricing and people were latching onto that. But really it was just like, no, the underlying value of the bitcoin is taken at an average of over that hour. And those two days, both days, we saw massive selling into the close of equity markets.
00:33:46.216 - 00:33:59.222, Speaker A: So that's one unique thing. I would point out to people that were concerned about issues with these ETF's, they're still operating exactly as they're supposed to. And if you look at the underlying value of the bitcoin, the ETF's are tracking them neck and neck very, very, very closely.
00:33:59.358 - 00:34:20.090, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, for me, it seems like flows continue to drive the story here. I mean, Alex, what do you think? Where do you think we are in the cycle right now? We had a ripper of a q one. We had a pretty big draw in April. May seems to be some recovery, like, where's your head at as it relates to the cycle right now?
00:34:20.162 - 00:34:54.664, Speaker C: I think it's a different kind of cycle, to be honest. I'm on the super cycle boat, so people like to hate about that, but it just makes sense. On one hand, the thing is, on the macro side of things, on macroeconomics, the economy, the global economy, is what you could call early stage and you could see this by basically industrials and manufacturing for the first time in years. And it just started a few months ago, starting to grow. And not just grow it. This is happening across the world. It's not just the US.
00:34:54.664 - 00:35:28.588, Speaker C: And you can also see this in basically the price of copper ramping up. So on the econ side of things is early cycle. On the risk asset side of things, we got ahead of ourselves, as we always do. I mean, that's how markets operate. It makes sense for the slope of things to be shallower with periods of volatility coming in every now and then. Like we just happened, making people panic about the end of things. I think bitcoin has a long way to go, and I think equities have a long way to go.
00:35:28.588 - 00:35:38.424, Speaker C: This could be something like the nineties and we're like 1997. The bursting of the bubble is. I don't see it. What do you think?
00:35:39.194 - 00:36:20.066, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, depending on how you define super cycle, it's whether or not I agree with you, but I think you're bang on with the commodity cycle. Even construction in the United States is just ripping right now. The price of lumber is collapsing, the price of oil is collapsing. I saw a stat that blew my mind today, that there's only two states in the United States where home inventory is dropping. So you have inventory rising in every single state except Nevada, which I think is -12% and the state of New York, which is minus one. So call it flat, if you will. 48 states are seeing rises in inventory of homes.
00:36:20.066 - 00:36:53.826, Speaker B: So they're just. I don't know. To me it doesn't feel like from a macro perspective, we're anywhere close to this sort of cycle top. If you. I was chatting with a friend over the weekend, he's like, you think s and p goes to 6000? I was like, minimum. Look at what just happened with the Fed this past week, that the treasury's adding liquidity in the system. If Jenny Eligon can buy off the run bonds in the market, particularly the long end of the curve, like 30 year, it's not YCC, it's not yield curve control, but kind of looks like it.
00:36:53.826 - 00:37:42.478, Speaker B: She can kind of, if she can kind of keep a lid on that interest expense 30 years out, that's great. The Fed can handle the front end of the curve if they end up cutting rates as well. So to me it feels like just looking at it from that perspective suggests we've got a pretty long way to go. And I was chatting with Raoul Paul last week, and he had an idea that I tend to agree with. Id love to get your guys thoughts on this, that I think a lot of people are underweight, the right tail of the distribution of outcomes, meaning just, just crazy bonkers rise, particularly in crypto, to say something like 10 trillion total market cap or something to that effect. I see a lot of chatter. Some folks, I completely discount saying that the top is in for bitcoin.
00:37:42.478 - 00:38:11.624, Speaker B: That's nonsense, in my opinion. Other folks saying that we're probably getting to get to 100k, bitcoin maybe 110, 115. I don't see hardly anybody really beyond like Cathie Wood. Right. Like anyone suggesting that bitcoin could be trading 200, 5300k, that ethereum's trading 10,000, Solanas trading 1000. I don't really see a lot of that. And that actually makes me even more bullish.
00:38:11.624 - 00:38:30.258, Speaker B: And increasing the probability of the right tail actually occurring over the course of the next, call it 12, 18, 24 months, something, something to that effect. Are people actually, from your perspective, James or Alex, like underweight, the right tail here as it relates to, you know, potential super cycle or bubble.
00:38:30.426 - 00:38:48.586, Speaker A: Yeah. All right, well, you guys are getting ready to start up the second 3 hours capital with all the super cycle talk I'm going to throw out there. Just to be clear, Cathy's, I think, said 3.8 million was the number, like, over some extended time period, and 1.5 million by 2030. So, yeah, she's definitely not. She's definitely not underweight.
00:38:48.586 - 00:38:51.534, Speaker A: The right tail. But I'll let Alex answer the question first.
00:38:52.674 - 00:39:20.140, Speaker C: Oh, I think it's a matter of. I mean, we keep on repeating this, but it's simple PTSD. I mean, when you suffered such an insane drawdown and crisis as we did in 22, it's very hard to trust what comes afterwards, especially when actually things don't look that great. And you're always concerned about inflation, you're concerned about housing, you're concerned about everything. Geopolitics. There's so many things going on to keep people that overthink it. Very concerned.
00:39:20.140 - 00:39:30.124, Speaker C: Now back into where we're in. The cycle is like we are at 5200 on DS and P, and the Fed hasn't even started to cut rates.
00:39:30.544 - 00:39:31.424, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:39:31.584 - 00:39:55.342, Speaker C: That's the point. And they will. 100%. They will. Okay, maybe not 100%, maybe 90%. Maybe something really bad happens and inflation starts spiking up again. I haven't seen you guys, I haven't seen a single solid analysis justifying for inflation to basically reverse trend started going up.
00:39:55.342 - 00:39:56.674, Speaker C: I haven't seen it.
00:39:57.494 - 00:40:08.854, Speaker B: Well, yeah, look at lumber and oil, all of these things that went limit up seemingly every day. Those are all crashing, collapsing now. Right?
00:40:08.894 - 00:40:35.144, Speaker A: Yeah, it's the services stuff that's going up right now. I think that's what's keeping everything. And housing, ironically enough, the high rates are almost keeping housing high because the building is almost completely stopped in certain areas, which is ironic enough. I mean, the flip side of this, I would say, is we're at record levels of assets and money market funds. So there's a lot of cash on there. So I guess, yeah, maybe you're right. There is a lot of people that still haven't fully bought in on the same side.
00:40:35.144 - 00:41:10.630, Speaker A: I talked to plenty of people, and it really, particularly in this space, when I talk to people at different, these crypto type events, it doesn't seem like anyone's underweight, the right deal. It seems like people are very risk seeking in this space, I guess do with that information with you, and that's completely anecdotal. But, yeah, there definitely seems to be a lot of tepidness from, from like, the data that I look at in the tradfi world. I mean, rates are so high, why, if you can get over 5% in a money market fund right now and like, yeah, maybe you could earn like double that or maybe more in like, equities or something else, but there's plenty of people that are just fine sitting on that.
00:41:10.822 - 00:41:50.934, Speaker B: So, yeah, your point about the money market funds is super, super important because, you know, Jani Ellen said she's going to continue to issue t bills. Right? She's, she's basically going to continue to fund the government by issuing short dated paper. And if you can still earn five and a half percent annualized for a four week t bill, I mean, that's pretty good. Right. But at some point, at some point, you know, I think folks are going to end up, you know, emptying the coffers or certainly starting to slowly drain it out of there because they're going to see the mag seven ripping again. S and P makes new all time highs. And five and a half percent.
00:41:50.934 - 00:41:55.106, Speaker B: If you're a pension fund and you need to hit your seven 8% annual target.
00:41:55.170 - 00:41:55.538, Speaker A: Sure.
00:41:55.626 - 00:43:14.004, Speaker B: Right. They have loads of fixed income already in their portfolios, but other folks, retail portfolio managers, et cetera, you're going to end up seeing that cash chase risk, especially if the dollar actually starts to drop in value, which it's, it, in my opinion, has, has topped. And as that continues to decline in value, people are less likely going to just be parking their cash in a five or five and a half percent money market fund, which also, if you look at real rates right now, for the Fed to be running real tightening policy as high as they have for this long, with real rates as high as they are, something's got to give there. And when the cycle turns, the real rates tend to not stay as high as they have been for this long. So that's another thing I think is an important indicator to keep track of, is how real rates actually respond to a weakening dollar, potentially rate cuts, as well as, I would say, lower volatility in the bond market if they can do this. You know, you kind of think of Yellen and Powell as like Kobe and Shaq, one controlling the front end of the curve, the other controlling the back.
00:43:14.504 - 00:43:45.374, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, talking about real rates, I guess we should explain to make sure people understand. Basically, he's talking about the difference in the fact that I know there's probably a lot of people listen to this, don't trust the government data on inflation, but essentially, the interest rates that the Fed is offering right now is above what the official inflation rates are there. It's technically, what's the word? Restrictive, if you will. So by cutting rates, that would be less restrictive or dovish or what have you. So that's what Joe was speaking about there. For those of you who weren't able to follow, we're finishing up here. We only got a couple of things left.
00:43:45.374 - 00:43:54.614, Speaker A: Robinhood just got a Wells notice. Does anyone have any strong opinions on seeing Robinhood getting wells notice here? Relation to some of their crypto movements?
00:43:54.954 - 00:44:18.934, Speaker C: Not really. I mean, it was kind of like prime for a little correction, tiny correction, if you're looking at interest day charts. It's like the news hits right after bitcoin does a little stops run on the upside and reverses. So you have a little trap longs, and then you get the news, and it kind of, like, makes sense to have a correction here. But that aside, it looks like a minor story.
00:44:20.274 - 00:45:15.324, Speaker B: Yeah, I feel like these things are going to continue. It's almost like, are they kind of politically jockeying themselves because they know the cat is out of the bag, so to speak, or the genie is out of the bottle, however you want to look at it, because almost to the tick, the headline hits. And these momentum ignition algorithms, which are market abuse algorithms, just hammered bitcoin. But other assets, they pulled back, too, from a correlation trade. But pretty much as we sit here now, bitcoins down 90, bps on the day, and it was down quite a bit more after the headline came out. And during us stock trading hours, some of these other alts are brushing it off. I think that is actually pretty telling.
00:45:15.324 - 00:45:53.284, Speaker B: And also, we saw this last week when altcoins and bitcoin specifically plunged to the deaths that they did. There was bad news, if you will, and the market was starting bottom on bad news. And so it feels like we're in one of these scenarios now where bad news is good news and good news is good news. Everything is good news. Because let's be honest, if this would have been the second week of April, I think. I think the market would have reacted very differently to the Wells notice for Robinhood.
00:45:53.784 - 00:46:29.346, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, it's just kind of like, I think everyone's kind of respecting it. Like Coinbase, Kraken, Robinhood is also publicly traded and doing this stuff, it's like, oh, yeah, it kind of makes sense. I mean, I'm of the opinion that one, this stuff isn't going to stop anytime soon. It's evident that this is the desire of the left wing and democratic party specifically. It looks like this is what this SEC administration is going to keep doing. And the only way some of this stuff might change, even then, there's no guarantee, is if we get a different administration in the White House come the fall. So, yeah, in my view, I was, like, just fitting, like, everyone just kind of like, okay, we know the government isn't a fan of this stuff.
00:46:29.346 - 00:46:44.122, Speaker A: It kind of is what it is. And we know they have problems with broker dealers touching this stuff. And there's no. They don't really have any rules anyone can abide by. But what's that? What's that one company that was able to get the special purpose broker dealer, I'm blanking on it. He's been on a bunch of podcasts. Yeah, exactly.
00:46:44.122 - 00:46:54.732, Speaker A: The only ones, they don't even have a business, and they're the only ones that were able to qualify for this. So I don't know. It's kind of crazy to me. It's kind of crazy to me that this is the world we live in, but here we are.
00:46:54.868 - 00:46:57.700, Speaker B: They don't even have a business, and they were able to get approved.
00:46:57.852 - 00:46:58.492, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:46:58.628 - 00:46:59.344, Speaker B: Perfect.
00:47:00.404 - 00:47:05.820, Speaker A: Yeah. And everyone who does have a business says it's unworkable and can't make it work. And here we are.
00:47:05.852 - 00:47:07.524, Speaker B: Yes, exactly.
00:47:07.684 - 00:47:22.676, Speaker A: All right, next one. Tether earnings real quick. I feel like we have to look at. Can we talk about the fact that tether, like, reported earning $4.5 billion in Q one with. I don't. Does anyone know how many employees they have? It's got to be like less than 20.
00:47:22.676 - 00:47:23.828, Speaker A: I don't even know what it is.
00:47:23.956 - 00:47:24.340, Speaker B: Tiny.
00:47:24.372 - 00:47:25.464, Speaker C: Supposed to be 20.
00:47:25.764 - 00:47:39.024, Speaker A: Is it 20? Okay, there you go. I mean, that is. That has. That has to be the most profitable per employee company in the entire world. I mean, I mean, maybe. No, even then I was going to say some, some oil company in the Middle east. But.
00:47:40.764 - 00:47:41.964, Speaker B: They have a lot of workers.
00:47:42.124 - 00:47:56.860, Speaker A: Yeah, they have too many workers for them to take over. But yeah, this is. I mean, that's. That's after earning 2.9 in Q four of last year. I mean, that's one use case. Everyone's like, where is the use case for blockchain and crypto in this world? And it's like, well, Heather's found it.
00:47:56.860 - 00:48:02.584, Speaker A: However, whatever sketchiness you might view and look at that space for, it's definitely found a product market fit.
00:48:03.404 - 00:48:20.306, Speaker C: And the way things work, by the time everybody has their own stable coins, rates going to go down, the yield is going to compress, and basically it's going to still remain. You see, what I mean is right now is so profitable to be running your own stable coin.
00:48:20.410 - 00:48:22.934, Speaker A: Oh, my gosh. And if you're not offering yield.
00:48:23.514 - 00:48:51.392, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. Look, I mean, the two killer use cases for crypto thus far, speculation and stable coins. So I'm not surprised. I'm not surprised if you have as much tether issued as tether does and they go buy short dated paper from the federal government, earning 5% on it. I mean, that's a pretty good business, especially when you don't have to share any of the interest that you're earning. Right. I mean, circle has a very similar business.
00:48:51.392 - 00:48:58.784, Speaker B: Right. But they're running towards regulators, whereas tether is clearly not, at least from my understanding, they're working with them a little.
00:48:58.824 - 00:49:05.124, Speaker A: More now than they used to, for sure, but still not. It's still not in the same way that USDC and Circle have, have gone about things.
00:49:05.424 - 00:49:45.186, Speaker B: Yeah, but I mean, it's just, it's a similar business, certainly on like the net interest income. Circle makes money off of the USCC that is issued by taking that cash and marketing in their Blackrock money market fund that earns whatever, call it roughly 5%, something to that effect. That's a great business. I think Circle has a much bigger business, especially with what they're doing with web3 services to make USDC permeated as the dollar protocol, if you will, within the Internet and web3. More broadly. Tether, on the other hand, just has an enormous reach. They were first and they're seemingly everywhere.
00:49:45.186 - 00:50:24.492, Speaker B: And you can go to certain parts of the world where merchants, I think in Dubai, people just transact with tether. There's lots of places where you can actually. Just, at a coffee shop, some merchant, et cetera, accepts tether. And that is actually very sticky. Hats off to the tether team for, you know, printing as much money, pardon the pun, in what they're doing. Because, man, what an unbelievable story, especially given how so many people have been forever trying to, you know, poo poo this business. Yeah.
00:50:24.492 - 00:50:40.056, Speaker B: The number of people that have been trying to short tether for so long and just not happening. I mean, at some point you just got to throw in the towel and say, all right, they're either here to stay, there's going to be competition in the space, but those numbers just, they don't lie.
00:50:40.160 - 00:50:52.456, Speaker A: I mean, imagine if they were to short the equity of tether, the company, or whatever the actual company name is for shorting. I mean, they just pumped out a $4.5 billion quarter. Those people would be into oblivion.
00:50:52.600 - 00:50:53.564, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:50:54.024 - 00:50:55.832, Speaker A: Sorry, go ahead, Alex. You were going to say something.
00:50:55.928 - 00:51:32.444, Speaker C: I was just going to say, yeah, people been hating on, especially macro people, and trat. Five people been hitting on tether for so long, to the point that many fans would even not even get into crypto just because of tether. And it's quite remarkable how we've gone from absolute heart rate towards tether to acceptance to now incipient admiration from people from the outside. So, yeah, what they've done is incredible. Hats off. And it's going to be very hard to displace them because they have network effects now. They are everywhere.
00:51:32.444 - 00:51:33.264, Speaker C: It's.
00:51:33.344 - 00:51:57.192, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. The one thing I would add here is, like, all the stuff we talked about. One, there's obviously a lot of other things that tether has done in the past that is part of the reason why everyone's scared of them, which we don't need to get into. But one thing I just don't understand is why the us government and Congress, like, they just get a stable coin build. Sounds like it's likely to happen actually potentially this year. But, like, it just makes so much sense. Like, people want your dollar around the world.
00:51:57.192 - 00:52:17.688, Speaker A: It will help keep dollar hegemony, which we already have in the world. I just don't know why they're so against, like, promoting this and setting up rules and regulations around it. It's basically like another euro dollar market. I'm nowhere near the first person to say this, but like, you're, you're exporting dollars around the world. Like, I don't understand the argument here against why you think this is a bad thing, as long as you know how it works.
00:52:17.816 - 00:53:25.954, Speaker B: The thing is, the problem is that you're making sense. You can't make sense. This is Washington, DC, right? It's all, there's all this force trading that goes on. Right? I mean, I heard from a source of mine who works in DC that, and this is now after the fact that Chuck Schumer was looking at getting cannabis legalized at a federal level as kind of this bargaining chip as it relates to getting a stablecoin bill passed. But which stablecoin bill or the version of it? Would it be the Republicans version or, you know, a bipartisan one, et cetera, et cetera? Well, so far the stable coin bill hasn't been passed, but he got his cannabis legalization right. Or at least it's, I don't know where the process is right now, but that's what's so, you know, frustrating, certainly, as, as an american taxpayer and voting citizen, to see something that is so clearly beneficial to the United States be horse traded back and forth while the rest of the world is kind of moving on without us. It's just so frustrating.
00:53:25.954 - 00:54:10.844, Speaker B: I think we will eventually get there as well. I don't know if it'll happen in the election year, but I do feel like there's a path in some way, shape or form that a stable coin bill is going to get passed and look like PayPal is involved. Obviously, circle is involved. There's going to be other folks that are going to be trying to go down this path. And when PayPal put their hat in the ring, this is a publicly traded company of material size, and they're willing to take the risk to go down this path. It's hard for me to see a scenario that PayPal makes that decision if they feel that they're going to get slapped by the SEC for something or that a stable coin bill isn't going to actually pass.
00:54:12.004 - 00:54:36.116, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, my colleagues down in DC, I have a colleague, Nathan Dean, who covers this, and he thinks theres, he basically said theres almost no shot of a market structure bill for crypto getting through. But he does think theres a decent chance that we get some sort of clarity for the first time in this space on whats going to be required and happen to stable coins or crypto dollars, as I like to call them sometimes. Anything to add, Alex?
00:54:36.300 - 00:54:40.110, Speaker C: No, no, ive been hearing the same thing. Exact same thing.
00:54:40.292 - 00:54:57.794, Speaker A: And then last thing before we go, last week, CZ got sentenced to four months in prison, right after holding on to number four right after. He also paid $4 billion in fines, I guess. Quick thoughts, Alex. What was the way you were looking at that?
00:54:57.874 - 00:55:12.884, Speaker C: And his net worth is 44 billion Singapore dollars. Nothing. I'm just. I don't know, ZC. I'm just happy for him. He's been an incredible figure for the industry. Everybody who knows him speaks so well of him.
00:55:12.884 - 00:55:38.594, Speaker C: And Binance is still out there. Fans have been safe with us, he says, and clearly they have had so many chances to run away with the money and still there. So I think it's a good ending for the story, and hopefully the industry can use that to move forward to the next stage, which is very welcome. Increased regulation right across the world.
00:55:39.334 - 00:56:16.066, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, only in crypto could CZ tweet years ago. Four. End up $4 billion in fines and get four months in jail. It's just, you know, I had this running joke with friends of mine, especially people that work with me at asymmetric. I'm like, once you work in crypto, can you possibly work in any other industry? You cannot get this level of entertainment anywhere. And the fact that it was four months, I mean, at first I thought it was fake news, and then I was like, no, no, it's actually real. He's getting four months.
00:56:16.066 - 00:56:16.914, Speaker B: Unbelievable.
00:56:17.034 - 00:56:30.010, Speaker A: Yeah. The headline that I saw initially said five months. Cause I think people were saying he was thinking about five months, and then the judge changed it to four months. So, like, they got it wrong. And then I was like, mike got. The guy sitting next to me was like, did you hear you got four months? It's like, no, he didn't. I just saw five months 30 seconds ago, and I sure enough went back.
00:56:30.010 - 00:56:49.250, Speaker A: I was like, this. You cannot make this shit up. But, I mean, honestly, he blatantly broke the law and, you know, he needed. They weren't just going to let him go without serving any time whatsoever, but it's basically a slap on the wrist. So he definitely gave somebody a lot of information and obviously kept people's assets safe. So, yeah, I'm sure. Well, this won't be the last we hear of him or of it.
00:56:49.250 - 00:56:59.626, Speaker A: So he'll still be around. I mean, he's. I think they said he's going to be the. He's going to be the richest person ever in US history to be in prison, which is just fitting for. For this industry, honestly.
00:56:59.690 - 00:57:02.614, Speaker B: Yeah, totally. I can't wait for the Netflix series.
00:57:03.954 - 00:57:05.814, Speaker A: I wouldn't be surprised if there is one.
00:57:06.604 - 00:57:07.824, Speaker B: Four seasons.
00:57:09.564 - 00:57:19.544, Speaker A: All right, I think that's about it for this week. Thanks for joining us for this episode of Bits and Bips. We'll be back in two weeks to discuss more about how the worlds of crypto and macro are colliding. Until then, talk soon.
00:57:20.084 - 00:57:21.060, Speaker C: Thank you, guys.
00:57:21.212 - 00:57:22.364, Speaker B: Thanks, guys.
