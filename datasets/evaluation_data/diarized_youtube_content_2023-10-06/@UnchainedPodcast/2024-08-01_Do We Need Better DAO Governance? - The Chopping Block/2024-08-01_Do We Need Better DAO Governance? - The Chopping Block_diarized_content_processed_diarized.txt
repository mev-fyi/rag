00:00:00.200 - 00:00:23.718, Speaker A: I think it's always good to have a pessimistic view on governance, because people love hating on collective decision making. It's a very easy thing to hate on. But I think the optimistic view is that there's a lot of innovation in these types of ways. And crypto is the only place I see in the world that bothers experimenting with this. The rest of the world is instead fighting over whether Nicolas Maduro rigged the election or not.
00:00:23.814 - 00:00:24.758, Speaker B: Not a dividend.
00:00:24.854 - 00:00:26.374, Speaker A: It's a tale of Tukwan now.
00:00:26.462 - 00:00:28.710, Speaker C: Your losses are on someone else's balance sheet.
00:00:28.790 - 00:00:31.250, Speaker D: Generally speaking, air drops are kind of pointless anyways.
00:00:31.890 - 00:00:34.178, Speaker C: Trading firms who are very involved.
00:00:34.274 - 00:00:36.810, Speaker A: Alec dot eth is the ultimate defi.
00:00:36.850 - 00:00:39.350, Speaker B: Protocols are the antidote to this problem.
00:00:40.850 - 00:00:50.690, Speaker C: Hello, everybody. Welcome to the chopping block. Every couple weeks, the four of us get together and give the industry insiders perspective on the crypto topics of the day. So quick intros. First, we got Tom, the defi maven and master of memes.
00:00:50.850 - 00:00:51.790, Speaker D: Hello, everyone.
00:00:52.610 - 00:01:01.480, Speaker C: Next, we've got Robert, the crypto connoisseur and tsar of Superstate GM, everybody. And we've got Tarun the Giga brain and grand poo bah at Gauntlet.
00:01:01.820 - 00:01:04.480, Speaker A: Yo. Happy to be back. It's been a while.
00:01:05.060 - 00:01:25.822, Speaker C: And finally, I'm Haseeb the hype man at Dragonfly. So we're early stage investors in crypto, but I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice, legal advice, or even life advice. Please see choppingblock XYZ for more disclosures. All right, so it's been a little bit. We've been kind of off and on for the last few weeks. Just, you know, a lot of us have been quite busy. Crypto world has been equivalently busy, as has the world of politics.
00:01:25.822 - 00:02:21.170, Speaker C: So let's check back in with our friends vying for the White House over in 2024. And it turns out that very recently, we had a blockbuster appearance by Trump, as well as RFK, the, you know, the guy who's running as an independent for the upcoming election. And everybody now seems to be making speeches about the idea of the United States buying a strategic bitcoin reserve. So now, what is a strategic bitcoin reserve? I don't quite know what is strategic about the strategic bitcoin reserve, but the what is contemplated. And this was a given first by a speech by Trump and then also echoed by another speech by RFK, as well as a bill that was proposed by Senator Cynthia Loomis. Is the United States government basically going in and buying a bunch of bitcoin on the open market until they have a big pile of bitcoin numbers have been floated. RFK said 4 million bitcoin out of the 21 million, which is a massive amount.
00:02:21.170 - 00:02:30.244, Speaker C: Senator Loomis proposed 5% of the total bitcoin supply. Trump. I don't know, just. I don't know if he said anything very specific. I think he just kind of alluded to it.
00:02:30.372 - 00:02:31.524, Speaker D: I think he just said, no selling.
00:02:31.572 - 00:02:32.372, Speaker C: He's like, we're not going to sell.
00:02:32.396 - 00:02:33.324, Speaker D: The bitcoin that we have.
00:02:33.372 - 00:02:43.068, Speaker C: We're not going to sell the bitcoin. Okay, so basically, the bitcoin is on the balance sheet. It just doesn't get sold. I guess that's bitcoin that was seized from, like, the Silk Road, and that becomes a strategic bitcoin reserve, which is.
00:02:43.084 - 00:02:52.660, Speaker D: Funny, because this week they started moving some of the Silk Road bitcoin to start selling it. So it's. I don't know if it was intentional. I'm sure it was already scheduled, but, uh, funny timing, right?
00:02:52.700 - 00:03:00.548, Speaker C: Okay, so, boys, is this final? Is this finally it? We hit the point of institutional adoption? Is this what we meant?
00:03:00.684 - 00:03:37.436, Speaker B: Yes, this is what we meant. Um. I don't think anyone a few years ago would have envisioned a 50 50 probability based on a coin flip of an election, which is going to be a very tight election. A coin flip that the largest economy in the world would declare that bitcoin is strategically important to the balance sheet of the largest economy on earth, and that it must respect the asset. I mean, that's like the biggest sovereign adoption that's possible. The US is, without question, at the top of the stack. And so that would be the largest domino.
00:03:37.436 - 00:04:24.868, Speaker B: If the US actually implements such a thing, I think many other countries would follow, not in any particular order or timeframe, but it would give a massive amount of legitimacy to the asset as a global asset. I don't think bitcoin is necessarily a strategic asset in the way that oil is a strategic asset, where it must be stockpiled so that your country can physically go to war or fuel its transportation. I see it as a financial asset. And countries do make financial investments all the time. Central banks have a diverse array of policies on what assets they put onto their balance sheet. Treasuries do as well. I mean, making financial investments is not new.
00:04:24.868 - 00:04:36.948, Speaker B: Gold has always been a financial investment for economic security. So I think it's a little bit of a misnomer and weird marketing to call it a strategic reserve, because that.
00:04:36.964 - 00:04:40.000, Speaker C: Makes, when do you release the strategic reserves?
00:04:41.670 - 00:04:57.090, Speaker B: Correct. And so I think that's a little bit awkward. But as a bitcoin holder, most people who are listeners are likely bitcoin holders in some way. The idea of the us government becoming a bitcoin holder and or purchaser is massive news.
00:04:57.590 - 00:06:13.912, Speaker C: So I agree with you in the long run, if you can get other government. So, obviously, if Trump is elected, he is not proposing that the us government becomes a marginal buyer of bitcoin, but rather that it just doesn't sell the bitcoin that it currently owns. Maybe that is the gateway drug to getting more bitcoin at some point, or diversifying into bitcoin. But at least for the moment, it seems like markets are, they reacted a little bit to Trump, a little bit of red meat, but it wasn't like, oh, my God, there's now a 50% chance that bitcoin is going on the balance sheet of every sovereign in the world. I see it more as the gateway drug thing is that it's legitimation. At the same time, of course, many, many people around the world see this as kind of ridiculous and like, okay, well, first of all, how much ability does Trump have unilaterally to create a strategic bitcoin reserve? Like, maybe if it's like, okay, can you get treasury to, like, not sell their bitcoin? I guess, you know, Treasury's under control of the executive, but can you do anything more than that, really, that, I just don't know. Um, but, you know, if you look at, like, what Cynthia loomis is proposing, uh, which I believe is, uh, proposing that the Fed do this right to, to buy 4% of the bitcoin supply, or, sorry, 5% of the bitcoin supply.
00:06:13.912 - 00:06:41.888, Speaker C: That is absolutely insane. But it's potentially possible if the stuff that Trump has been, or that has been leaked in the New York Times and so on about Trump considering some kind of takeover of the Fed in principle would be possible, I think insane, and I think very unlikely that he would even do it, because whatever, hes already elected, so what does he care now? But that would be absolutely earth shattering relative to, okay, they dont sell the bitcoin, and we call that a strategic bitcoin reserve, Preston.
00:06:41.904 - 00:07:15.754, Speaker B: Yeah. Its also interesting because the strategic petroleum reserve was created through an act of Congress. It was essentially us policy to stockpile oil. You know, it's a question for the policy people who listen to the show about whether the executive branch can just do something similar, or he would have to convince lawmakers to make it a us policy to stockpile bitcoin in some way, but for comparison sake, the strategic petroleum reserve was created by Congress.
00:07:15.882 - 00:07:28.800, Speaker C: Yeah. The power of the purse is controlled by Congress. So they can't spend net new money to go buy stuff and just put it on the government balance sheet without Congress. Pretty much for sure. Right. You can maybe dig around some weird executive orders somewhere that.
00:07:28.840 - 00:07:34.232, Speaker B: Yes and no. Like the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve is able to put new assets on its balance sheet without acts of Congress.
00:07:34.296 - 00:07:44.180, Speaker C: The Federal Reserve is. Right. But that's not under control of the executive branch, right? Correct. So the executive branch explicitly controls treasury. So treasury, like, it's not independent. Right.
00:07:44.760 - 00:08:18.708, Speaker A: Although I will say, and like, I'm not saying this is likely, but during COVID when there was all the crazy central bank buying every possible asset, there was a lot of coordination between the central bank and the executive orders to kind of do that type of stuff. So in a situation where they're both aligned, I feel like they can help each other do that. Now, of course, if they're both aligned, you need a crisis. Yeah, I feel like you need a crisis for that. But I think Trump, Trump doesn't let crises go to waste. It seems so far.
00:08:18.884 - 00:08:21.740, Speaker C: But what kind of crisis would make.
00:08:21.860 - 00:08:25.044, Speaker A: I mean, the pandemic was a great example of bitcoin. No, no, the penny.
00:08:25.052 - 00:08:28.244, Speaker C: Instead of buying bitcoin, that was also.
00:08:28.292 - 00:08:48.278, Speaker A: A great time to have done that, to buy bitcoin. Well, I mean, if you have countries increasing their gold reserves during that time, I don't see why they would not necessarily consider it, especially if they're already have. I think it's like a zero or one thing. Like, once they start, they can't stop. It's like, even if they don't, it.
00:08:48.294 - 00:09:26.580, Speaker D: Does strike me as it's kind of like school elections and one candidate promises chocolate milk from the water fountains and the other is it's free recess. And then it's like kind of making up claims and everyone's like, trying to, like, out, out bitcoin each other. But I think the other parts of Trump's speech were actually kind of more interesting. And it feels like somebody is somebody well informed, is kind of feeding in crypto policy. I mean, you talk about, like, firing Gary Gensler and commuting Ross's sentence, and he said ending operation choke, .2.0 which is like Nick Carter's whole thing. And so it's like very kind of crypto shibbolethy coded.
00:09:26.580 - 00:09:38.160, Speaker D: And that, I think, was actually more interesting to me that it's not just, oh, I say bitcoin, and people cheer and thumbs up, and that's kind of the end of the speech. But it's like, okay, maybe there's, like, a little bit more nuance to kind of the crypto policy in perspective.
00:09:38.200 - 00:09:58.788, Speaker A: There's kind of a funny, like, I am Satoshi type of thing happening here where, like, at least three different people have told me that they or their boss is the one who told him to fed him this. And it's like, funny. Like, everyone wants to take credit for doing it. So, like, I find that also kind of this, like, very funny thing.
00:09:58.964 - 00:10:10.864, Speaker B: Of course they do. Like, this is the transformation of, you know, a major party candidate into being pro crypto. How could you not want to take credit for that if you were a Jason?
00:10:10.992 - 00:10:18.504, Speaker A: It's just funny because there's this DDos effect where Sybil attack where everyone is saying, I disassociate totally, but it's now.
00:10:18.552 - 00:10:21.780, Speaker B: Officially a part of the Republican Party platform to be pro crypto.
00:10:22.440 - 00:11:05.412, Speaker C: Yeah, that has been a real transformation. Interestingly, along the same weekend, obviously, there was bitcoin, this gigantic bitcoin conference in Nashville where two presidential candidates attended. There was supposed to be a third, which was Kamala Harris. So Kamala Harris, of course, is now the presumptive democratic nominee. And Kamala Harris supposedly was in talks with the bitcoin conference organizers to also appear at the bitcoin conference, but ended up deciding against ultimately attending. It sounded like, from the noises that I'm hearing from some of the folks who are more politically active in the US, that the Kamala team is interested in crypto. They're trying to wrap their head around it.
00:11:05.412 - 00:11:39.104, Speaker C: They're trying to get more input from the industry to say, hey, what's going on here? This seems really important, and it seems like so far, our policy stance has maybe been not constructive. We want to hear from you guys, and we want to get an idea of what we can be doing differently. But they're sort of. It sounds like they're still undecided, but they're open to conversation and they're willing to, like, you know, take meetings in a way that the Biden administration was just really not open to. So that also seems good that both parties seem to be moving towards something closer to the middle ground. But Republicans clearly have fully embraced the crypto platform at this point.
00:11:39.272 - 00:12:03.070, Speaker A: It pains me to say this as someone who's born in Delaware and hates California, but I would obviously think the California Democrat is much more crypto than someone from Delaware. I might. Me and Ansem might be the most crypto people from Delaware possible. Everyone else is not going to make it.
00:12:04.570 - 00:12:05.510, Speaker C: Fair enough.
00:12:05.850 - 00:12:09.310, Speaker D: I haven't even known anyone else from Delaware, so you automatically win.
00:12:11.330 - 00:12:16.378, Speaker A: Yeah. The only first person I ever met in crypto is from Delaware is Ansem. So I will say it's like, wow.
00:12:16.474 - 00:12:19.938, Speaker C: I didn't know they allowed non white people in Delaware. That's very.
00:12:19.994 - 00:12:32.920, Speaker A: You know, that's funny you said, because the third most popular religion in Delaware, most common religion is Hinduism. It's like, yeah, they're all going for the tax saving tax money.
00:12:33.820 - 00:12:50.240, Speaker B: I just remember. Do you all remember Wayne's world, the original, where they have a fake backdrop and they're, like, pretending to visit different states, and they visit Delaware, and they go like, Delaware. Okay. Not sure what we're doing here. All right, next state. You know, one thing for each state, you know.
00:12:50.600 - 00:12:52.632, Speaker C: Yeah. They incorporate in Delaware and they move on.
00:12:52.736 - 00:13:10.140, Speaker A: Delaware also has a great slight tangent scam in that it has one of the shortest amounts of federal interstate highway, but it has the highest toll to number of miles you drive ratio. It's only like 15 or 20 miles, but the toll is like $6. Like, not counting a.
00:13:10.720 - 00:13:14.752, Speaker C: Thank you for that Delaware trivia that keeps all our viewers tuned in.
00:13:14.896 - 00:13:16.408, Speaker D: There should be a recurring segment, I.
00:13:16.424 - 00:13:23.932, Speaker A: Think Delaware, we would run out very quickly. It's like, of a shit state. It's kind of a shit state.
00:13:23.996 - 00:13:37.396, Speaker C: Okay, all right, all right. Well, hold on. We're going to lose all our Delaware viewers. Jeroen, you got to slow down. Okay, all right, all right, all right. So let's move on. So, very interesting week this week in on chain governance.
00:13:37.396 - 00:13:53.466, Speaker C: And this is one that I think it's got a few sort of twists and turns in the story. So let me. Let me set this up. So, compound, of course, governance protocol. Some of the people on the show may have some prior affiliation with compound. So compound is a lending protocol. It exists on chain.
00:13:53.466 - 00:14:44.560, Speaker C: It's fully decentralized. So it is governed purely through on chain votes of people who own the comp token. So there is a gentleman by the name of Humpy who turned out, over the previous weekend, voted on a proposal that was going to allocate 500,000 comp, which is worth at that time, about $25 million from the protocol treasury to a new yield bearing protocol that was designed by this group called the Golden Boys. And this group, the Golden Boys, was going to establish this wrapped comp token called gold Comp, which would do some kind of mining yield thing. Don't quite totally understand what the idea was. Originally, they made this proposal with, I think, 100,000 comp, and it was defeated in governance. And then they came back a few weeks later and then made another proposal in which they five x'ed the amount of comp that they were requesting.
00:14:44.560 - 00:15:33.116, Speaker C: And this proposal, I guess it went to a vote over the weekend, and people in governance just kind of didn't see it, or didn't get around to voting on it, or the alarm didn't get raised. And this proposal passed. And this proposal passed in large part due to a large amount of comp that was purchased on the open market, presumably by Humpy, in between the time of the first proposal and the second proposal. Now, this guy Humpy, uh, is not a. This is not its first rodeo. Okay? So Humpy has a history of going after Dow governance and pushing them as a, quote unquote, activist investor, uh, for his own, or, you know, his or their personal gain. Uh, first it was balancer in 2022, where Humpy cornered like the cream weth pool, and then, uh, used, uh, his battle tokens to get a bunch of emissions to the cream weth pool, and then fought with.
00:15:33.116 - 00:16:25.990, Speaker C: There was like a detente at some point, and it was like a whole thing. And then did the same thing, most recently with Sushiswap in 2024. And so he's basically like a kind of known actor in activist governance stuff. So there was a bunch of people on Twitter being like, oh, my God, how could this happen? There was this kind of thing that just went on and nobody paid attention. And now all this comp is owned by the golden boys. Well, so in the end, there was some kind of, let's say, midnight negotiating with humpy and broad community backlash, and they decided instead to withdraw the proposal, which had already passed governance. The proposal was withdrawn and cancelled and replaced by a new proposal, which is basically, everybody's happy now we're doing some kind of compound staking, and 30% of token reserves go to state compound holders.
00:16:25.990 - 00:17:10.950, Speaker C: Basically no now, weird thing. And no more golden boys involved in this. And everybody kind of counts it as a win. So it seems like all is well. Whatever bad thing people thought was going to happen has not happened, but it's caused a lot of consternation and a lot of activist, or a lot of discussion about, one, the role of activist investors in daos to the role of active governance, and whether this is an indictment against daos or whether there's something wrong with Dao governance or something like this could happen in an OG Dao such as compound and what it means for thinking about dow governance going forward. So let's go around the horn and take people's perspectives on this whole compound governance humpy episode. Robert, why don't you kick it off?
00:17:11.110 - 00:18:04.122, Speaker B: I'll kick it off. In full disclosure, I've been quite removed from the project for over a year. So most of my views were just as an outsider, but as also someone that was involved early on in helping to design the governance system that has become one of the standards. So as background for folks, the compound governance contracts and frameworks are the most widely used in crypto today. They're copy pasted repeatedly, openzeppelin has standardized them, and it's basically a library that a huge number of projects are using for on chain governance. This is done because the contracts are relatively simple, easy to understand, easy to reason through, and they don't have complex parameters. It really comes down to one token can be delegated.
00:18:04.122 - 00:18:40.918, Speaker B: Whoever is entrusted to vote that token. It's one vote, one token. So it's a very simple system that's easy to understand. When it was designed originally, it was done not knowing what to expect, because governance on chain circa 2020 was incredibly new. There was very few working examples at that time to use as prior art. Since early 20 to 2020. Sorry, early 2020, there's been, in a lot of ways, huge advances.
00:18:40.918 - 00:19:02.812, Speaker B: It's been four and a half years since the system was designed in on chain governance. And so, you know, my first thought is, you know, this is one of the oldest on chain governance systems that exist. Like, so many improvements have been designed in the years since. This was almost like chapter one or chapter, you know, one and a half of on chain governance systems. You know, one token.
00:19:02.916 - 00:19:07.044, Speaker C: What do you think has gotten better in on chain governance since, like, the Kona Bravo days?
00:19:07.172 - 00:19:55.528, Speaker B: Yeah, there's a few things. One is I like some of the models out there that have time based voting. I actually like Curve's governance contracts in a lot of ways. I like that the longer you commit to being a stakeholder, the more your vote counts, so to speak. I think that actually prevents certain types of negative behavior like systems that do have some, like, external safeguards in place. You know, the compound governance system has very few, like, checks and balances and intermediaries. It was designed that way, you know, deliberately, but there's very few things that allow people to cancel proposals.
00:19:55.528 - 00:20:50.680, Speaker B: You know, back when these were first created, the idea that, like, you know, multisig was going to have to approve each governance proposal. Seems crazy now. It's almost the norm where it's like, oh, a trusted council can prevent bad actors from being involved in the protocol. Well, at the time, from the crypto philosophy, that was considered absurd. There's very few safeguards or very few checks and balances that are in place that allow a council or whatever to cancel proposals or screen them or censor them. It's really a censorship, censorship, not allowing process for the creation of proposals. And so this was always a theoretical possibility that somebody would just become an extremely large stakeholder and push through their will.
00:20:50.680 - 00:21:18.984, Speaker B: It's hard to say in this particular situation. Like, is the system working? Is it not working? I don't know. I mean, this is one of the most widely debated things on crypto Twitter. But it's interesting that someone was able to accumulate just so much of a governance vote very quietly and very discreetly and really putting a major system like this to its test for the first time. In a lot of ways.
00:21:19.152 - 00:21:48.004, Speaker C: Tarun, I know Gauntlet has been very deeply involved in compound governance, and you guys were also participant in the. Or not. I don't know exactly what the role was of Gauntlet, but Gauntlet was like sort of in the governance forums, advocating for the eventual resolution that Humpy or Humpy's emissaries proposed to bring the whole thing to a rest with this new staking proposal. So I'm sure there are things you can't say. You can't say whatever, but give us what is your take on this whole drama and how did you guys view it?
00:21:48.132 - 00:22:32.300, Speaker A: So I would say this wasn't a thing. Out of nowhere. There had been two prior attempts. And I think in all these attempts, we had spent a lot of time trying to explain to voters what this proposal was trying to do and claim to do and try to encourage people to participate. I think we were able, in the first vote, to corral sufficient support. I think there's sort of a combination of factors that led to the second one. First, obviously, the increase in size certainly helped.
00:22:32.300 - 00:24:00.256, Speaker A: Second, a lot of the largest holders are still us funds, and us funds are extremely afraid, due to some regulatory actions have taken place against daos, to vote in Dao governance votes. And so I think you're in this very weird predicament where, hey, to reach quorum, it's extremely hard to do it without one of the us funds, who owns x percent and sufficient to have the vote go through, who doesn't really want the takeover, but they're afraid of their own liability, and so they won't vote. And so then it becomes kind of corralling work of trying to get the group of active participants, you know, as a kind of, kind of, maybe not disclaimer disclosure, but just like, you know, we've made, like, the most proposals in the last few years. Like, we're making proposals, like, weekly or every other week. So I think we are quite deep in the weeds there. And I think we've definitely observed this chilling effect from each of the actions against dows where, like, funds slowly stop voting. And I think if funds own a large percentage of the float but then don't vote, it actually makes this, makes them susceptible to this.
00:24:00.256 - 00:24:35.224, Speaker A: So there's, you know, I can understand the fund's perspective. There's a kind of, you know, unbounded legal liability thing in participating. On the other hand, if an attack is successful and there's funds lost by users in some indirect way, then the funds are also probably liable to other types of lawsuits. So it's kind of a weird situation, and I would partially blame the regulatory uncertainty for us entities. So daos that have a lot of us participants are very different than daos that don't have many us participants.
00:24:35.312 - 00:24:38.340, Speaker C: So what you're saying it's all Gensler's fault, no matter what happens?
00:24:38.960 - 00:25:48.840, Speaker A: I mean, I think it's partially Gensler's fault. I also think it's the fact that these funds own these stakes, and they haven't quite figured out the correct way to participate in these networks, whereas much more foreign participant daos have much higher participation rates of. I would say that. I'd say the second thing is, and this is something we spend a lot of time trying to advocate for, but sometimes it's a little bit hard in Dao governance, which is if a DAO is earning a lot of fees or has a lot of accrued fees, I think those fees should be either delivered to the suppliers, the participants in the protocol, or they should be used as insurance or something, but they shouldn't just collect and not get used in some way. Right. And I think in this case, there were quite a large amount of accrued fees, which made it a sort of natural reason for someone to want to do this. Now, other lending protocols, other perpetual protocols have added fee switches.
00:25:48.840 - 00:26:29.856, Speaker A: And again, this gets back to this us entity thing, where, like, if you look at the uniswap V switch thing, it was us fund, large us funds, who sort of blocked the vote, even though, like, most of the community, was very pro turning on the fee switch. So there's some combination of large US funds and Gensler, who I think are in a lot of ways the culprits of this. I do think there is value, though, that in, you know, again, like, people bringing this type of stuff to attention. I think it's just sometimes would have been done a little more carefully or gingerly, but it's crypto, so I think you're always dealing with cowboys.
00:26:30.008 - 00:26:31.140, Speaker C: Tom, what's your take?
00:26:31.720 - 00:27:18.278, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, I think it's this classic, like, people want to have their cake and eat it, too, where they don't like the dead weight in governance of these large funds who might not want to vote for various reasons, but then, you know, obviously they also don't like the idea that, hey, one large actor can basically dictate the direction of the protocol. And so it's sort of like you close one eye and you see humpy, and you close the other eye and you see Andreessen. And in some ways it's like that is the nature of on chain asset weighted voting. And there's ways, as Robert was saying, to deter or mitigate bad actors. But it is ultimately like kind of. It comes with the territory. I think the workaround, obviously, has been more delegation.
00:27:18.278 - 00:28:08.276, Speaker D: Delegation to university blockchain clubs, university, or delegation to paid delegates. And I don't quite know how that system is working. Obviously, in some ecosystems and some daos, they're very vibrant and there's always new proposals and there's good treasury management, and then in others, it just feels like everyone is asleep at the wheel. And this is sort of a very egregious example of somebody who maybe didn't have the best intentions trying to pilfer the dao for its riches. But I think there's minor examples people have talked about, hey, this is a ridiculous budget for this particular item, or some contractor is building the DAO, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars for very simple work. And I think that stuff probably goes on more frequently, but doesn't get the attention that someone like compee does.
00:28:08.468 - 00:28:34.210, Speaker A: Well, I think at the end of the day, daos that earn fees, that don't redistribute the fees to different stakeholders will always be kind of face this type of dilemma. I think if I look at something like Rookdao, where there was a real hostile takeover, that was much crazier. I think it's just that this, because it was one of the more is much more well known, was kind of in this vein.
00:28:35.390 - 00:29:04.570, Speaker C: So it seems like the views here are between Robert pointing out, okay, governance has grown up and this is kind of a very, this is sort of a more primitive governance system that could probably improve from some mechanism. Improvements. Tarun, I think kind of saying like, well, if you keep a bunch of assets on the balance sheet, you're a honey pot. You're going to track this kind of behavior. That's no good. People should pay more attention. And Tom, just saying like, well, whatever, it's wild west, like, what do you expect?
00:29:04.990 - 00:29:07.810, Speaker A: I also do place some of the blame on the us funds, right?
00:29:08.470 - 00:29:36.416, Speaker C: Yes, yes. And I think that is definitely, absolutely right. And full disclosure, Dragonfly is an investor in comp and we own some comp. We did not vote. And in that vote we didn't know the vote was going on. It was a weekend, which is obviously a lame excuse, but is true. But also to your point, Tarun, we try not to vote directly on things because of the exact same reason that you mentioned, which is that there's been case law within the US that claims that when funds participate in DaO.
00:29:36.416 - 00:30:30.204, Speaker C: So you remember very famously the Uki Dao case in which a judge actually, this is not actually Gensler, this is like some district judge who said that if you voted your tokens, you are basically liable for the actions of the DAO. And what effectively that says, I mean, maybe there's some rationale to that theory, but of course, what it incentivizes is don't vote if you don't want liability. And that has created this really messed up equilibrium where the overwhelming incentive for investors, whether they're retail investors or institutional investors, is don't vote your tokens if you don't want to take on liability for what happens afterwards. And of course, nobody wants liability for what happens afterwards when some crazy guy creates a vote about golden coin, golden boys, whatever the hell is going on. And the interesting thing I think is fewfold. I should also note that we're very small investors in comp. We're not even in the top 20 owners of comp.
00:30:30.204 - 00:31:32.166, Speaker C: Relative to some of the other funds that people were yelling at, I think we're pretty de minimis relative to those guys. But the general point, I think is correct. And I don't know what is a good answer to that besides just more delegation and paying delegates. I think the answer is that you need to make sure that theres a healthy ecosystem of delegates that big players like ourselves or other investors can delegate to and that theyre compensated for doing good work. And I think also to Roberts Point, this is nowadays a best practice to have some kind of council of trusted community members that cant just wholesale do things, but can at least veto bad actions. The reality is that in corporate law, and we sometimes analogize daos to corporations in a kind of loose way, in corporate law you cannot just pass anything that you want that goes through a shareholder vote. There are certain things that are not allowed, such as something that, for example benefits certain people in a class of shareholders over others.
00:31:32.166 - 00:32:05.574, Speaker C: You're not allowed to do that. You can't say, well, we are the preferred shareholders and the common stock shareholders don't own as much. So we're going to vote the preferred shareholders, like get a giant dividend that the common doesn't get. Right. Can't do that because obviously that would incentivize essentially a kind of corporate rating or stripping or tunneling, which is basically you buy a company and you strip out the assets and sell it or give it to certain people over others. If you do that, that basically is an incentive to just go, as Tom said, just raid the piggy bank. But daos dont have this mechanism by default.
00:32:05.574 - 00:32:56.486, Speaker C: There is no way programmatically to say this is unfair to a certain class of token holders, such as this proposal for the golden boys. Its actually pretty unclear what the golden boys were going to do once they had this gold comp thing. They claimed in ostensibly in the governance forum. They were like, no, no, no, we have really genuine reasons to believe that what were doing is for the good of the protocol. And for all I know, maybe they did have genuinely honest incentives that maybe just looked kind of weird on paper, but maybe they were really trying to do the right thing and they're just weirdos. At the end of the day, the cleanest way to avoid that is to just say, look, whatever it is you're proposing has to be able to get by a council. And that council is not unilaterally competent, but it can at least say in the worst case, hey, your job is to stop weird stuff from happening in the.
00:32:56.486 - 00:33:14.462, Speaker C: In the worst case that somebody does end up getting this 51% of governance votes and it ultimately acts mostly as a disincentive to even try. Right. It's not that there's a bunch of proposals going through any of these Daos or people trying to vote themselves all the money in the DAO, but just happened though.
00:33:14.566 - 00:33:16.174, Speaker A: That has happened though right?
00:33:16.182 - 00:33:18.094, Speaker C: But it's very rare. Right. My point is that that's very rare.
00:33:18.182 - 00:33:22.230, Speaker B: There's also cases where like take all the money has happened like Beanstalk was.
00:33:22.270 - 00:33:23.370, Speaker A: One of the examples.
00:33:24.790 - 00:33:32.330, Speaker B: There was a voting contract and somebody won a vote and took all of the assets backing the beanstalk or whatever.
00:33:33.150 - 00:34:14.060, Speaker C: Yeah. So to be clear, obviously that has happened before, but these things are rare. If you have this kind of veto mechanism, it basically becomes just not even worth trying. So it does feel like it's a teachable moment for Defi and for governance generally. I don't know if it, like, I think there's been a lot of sentiment lately of like, hey, dow, governance kind of sucks. And like, maybe we should just move away. We should just move to these governance light systems, or just like, embrace the multisig, you know, and just say, like, fuck it, right? Like, if it's, if it's gonna be multisigs, just make multi sigs all the way down.
00:34:14.060 - 00:34:21.079, Speaker C: I don't know. Turin, what's your, what's your, what's your view on the people who are sort of anti Dao governance?
00:34:21.539 - 00:35:18.170, Speaker A: I mean, I think DAos can work if they have active in general, I think it's like active teams and founding teams seems quite crucial to their success, just mainly because it's like the vote distribution is not. It's hard to take pure community members and get the vote distribution to be real sufficient for such dao. I think there's some version of the world, I think, in Solana, there's a lot of examples of people trying to do more wilder governance mechanisms. Actually, I think I would actually put Solana as much further out. I saw a lot of people talking about how dual token voting will solve everything. I don't know about that. We've seen just as many problems with the dual token votes.
00:35:18.170 - 00:35:21.222, Speaker A: And that, to me, is, what problems.
00:35:21.246 - 00:35:25.850, Speaker C: Have you seen with dual token votes? You're talking about op or Lido?
00:35:26.590 - 00:35:53.210, Speaker A: Yeah, no, Lido is actually fine. It's just op. I think the way the grant distribution worked and stuff was quite unfavorable. They have an anti. They had some sort of, I would say, liability issues. The type of stuff tom was talking about where people found ways to abuse the system and get paid a lot. It's sort of like a very.
00:35:53.210 - 00:36:16.574, Speaker A: It actually makes the dual token thing, I think, actually makes it more opaque as to when such a thing is happening versus the single token. So I'm not sold on that. I think the Solana experiments are far more interesting, to be totally honest, because people are trying futarchy again there. In governance, people are trying a lot of. Who's trying futarchy drift drift.
00:36:16.622 - 00:36:20.038, Speaker C: Governance drift is doing futarchy on governance?
00:36:20.214 - 00:36:20.934, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:36:21.102 - 00:36:24.366, Speaker C: Wait, didn't they just launch the prediction markets like a week ago?
00:36:24.518 - 00:36:58.150, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, but they're dog fooding their own protocol. I'm telling you, I think people in ethereum land don't spend enough time looking at Solana stuff because I think it's actually worth looking at because it is a huge community of people. It's like, definitely the second biggest by number of people. And they are doing interesting things there, too. I think their governance contracts look very different. Their multisig and governance are more integrated. I think if I look at no so safe, it's more isolated from, say, something like compound gardens to Aragon.
00:36:58.150 - 00:37:33.090, Speaker A: And you have to glue them together in the right way. The way the Solana code looks is quite a bit more integrated. So I guess my long story short is I think people in Ethereum on l two s have been taking more aggressive steps than applications on governance. And I think we'll see the fruits of that, hopefully. But I think there are people still doing experiments. I don't think there's reason to be totally negative. It just feels like, you know, it's like saying, I hate politics because, like, everything sucks, but then what's the next best alternative? It's like equally bad.
00:37:33.090 - 00:37:46.750, Speaker A: Right. So I think if you take a slightly more optimistic view, there are people still innovating governance. They're just not where you think they are. And I think it's really worth, really worth making sure those experiments happen.
00:37:47.370 - 00:37:59.020, Speaker C: So, Robert, let's say a founder comes to you, they're building a brand new DeFi protocol, and they say, okay, what is the best practice today on governance? What should I be doing and when should I be doing it?
00:37:59.720 - 00:38:52.240, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, at a really high level. In general, my view is there should only be governance in place once a system is relatively hardened on its own and doesn't need constant governance, because the ability of pre governance to make changes, to edit, to update, modify, to tweak, is vastly superior to that of a decentralized community. Right now, you probably cannot find an example of a decentralized community that's quick and efficient and effective at decision making. It's very. Governance is almost an end of a process, not the beginning. I think one of the biggest mistakes I see is people start off and they're like day zero. There's governance sometimes even before there's a protocol.
00:38:52.900 - 00:38:53.640, Speaker A: Right.
00:38:54.020 - 00:39:40.700, Speaker B: It's like people are putting governance way too early in a process, not where I believe it belongs, which is at the end. And so I think that's the first like, major mistake the second. You know, I do think that, you know, so much has changed over the last four years with governance. I think a lot of the philosophical perspectives that people have, have evolved. I think at this point, good governance is limited in how much you want or should have a very broad community making decisions. I think it's great for certain decisions ratifying something new, deciding a versus b. A crowd is very good at that.
00:39:40.700 - 00:40:27.404, Speaker B: A very large dispersed community is not efficient at modifying the risk parameters of a protocol. They're not efficient at calibrating a lever. I think at this point, protocols should be designed, and this is both governance light and governance complex. But to have specialists in place, it's like this specific team, whether it's a multisig or some custody address or whatever, has powers to change x. This other thing has powers to change y, this other thing has powers to change z, and not, okay, it's a broad community. It does everything at all times for all the cities. Like, that's incredibly inefficient.
00:40:27.404 - 00:40:43.370, Speaker B: It's almost like, you know, committee of control. And I think there's a lot of ways to do it natively. In protocols, the only times you need very broad token holder governance is for major decisions.
00:40:44.350 - 00:41:39.634, Speaker A: And I will say there is a move in newer DeFi protocols in ethereum and a little bit in Solana, but I think this is more of an ethereum thing to having these layered protocols where each layer is governed differently and some layers will be governed by a smaller group or even one person. Some layers are governed by the overall Dao, you know, like things like Morpho mellow, et cetera. And then they have competition between the different layers. You might have multiple participants who offer a different service at each layer. And I think we're going to start seeing innovation of that form, which is more like. I think Dao governance in 2020 was like, here is an arbitrary function that you can execute on the state owned by the governance contract, and people vote on it. Now it's much more like, here's access controls, here's certain types of users, certain types of groups.
00:41:39.634 - 00:42:34.998, Speaker A: I think in 2021, in the euphoria, there are a lot of people who are trying to build tools for daos around this very basic primitive of. We have a function that can be executed on the Daosh state, and people vote on whether that function gets executed or not. And I think the tooling was sort of. You're kind of in a rock and a hard place because it's like, very hard to build that off such a basic primitive. Whereas what we're seeing now of, like, these layers, each having a more well defined scope of what types of functions can be executed, when can they be executed, what level of granularity do you need? Those are actually providing a lot more efficiency. I think we, you know, I think it's always good to have a pessimistic view on governance because people love hating on collective decision making. It's like a very easy thing to hate on.
00:42:34.998 - 00:42:51.750, Speaker A: But I think the optimistic view is that there's a lot of innovation in these types of ways. And crypto is the only place I see in the world that bothers experimenting with this. The rest of the world is instead fighting over whether Nicolas Maduro rig the election or not. Right.
00:42:53.010 - 00:43:25.962, Speaker C: Well, I love seeing these examples of convergent evolution, and I feel like in daos, I was reading a little bit about the history of the SEC and the independent agencies that arose in the US. And these agencies, these independent agencies were part of the reason why they're independent. It means that they're not under the executive branch formally. The president can't fire the head of the SEC, per se, unless it's for cause. They have to have done something wrong. I think part of the reason for that is that they were originally understood to be delegations by Congress. Right.
00:43:25.962 - 00:44:07.746, Speaker C: The idea is that, okay, Congress, parliament, it's kind of too hard for a big group of 200 people to agree on complex questions. They can't decide on every little thing. And so they're supposed to delegate the authority to a smaller group of people who are outside the remit of the executive branch, but have almost like executive like authority to make rules. And, you know, that's supposed to be what the SC is doing, is making rules, which obviously one of the things we're complaining about is they're not making rules about crypto. But that concept feels very similar, in a way, to what we're now arriving at for Dao. It's like, yeah, yeah, don't have every little decision go through all of Congress. Right? That's crazy.
00:44:07.746 - 00:44:33.992, Speaker C: That's like a massively terrible way to make decisions. Is like a gigantic Ouija board that we're all, you know, pulling around collectively on every little decision. Um, we need some degree of delegation, some degree of specialization, some degree of like, you know, let there be grandstanding and, you know, big arguments over big political questions of the day that really do require group input, but otherwise, like, yeah, let's, let's agree to specialize and delegate effectively.
00:44:34.056 - 00:45:09.240, Speaker A: Yeah. But at the end of the day. I still think there's just a lot more transparency in what is happening, even when you have the specialization, which is a, which I think is clear difference between. Between this and I think people just don't, like, especially people who are, like, pure traders within crypto and, like, or pure, like, only think of the financial aspects of these and not how the code looks and, like, what actually goes on under the covers. You know, they have a kind of, like, hey, like, everything should be as fast as me being able to make a dex trade. Right. And, like, it's.
00:45:09.240 - 00:45:14.740, Speaker A: That's just not, that's just not the way software development works. Like, no matter how you. How you cut it.
00:45:15.480 - 00:45:16.420, Speaker C: Fair enough.
00:45:17.000 - 00:45:32.304, Speaker A: Okay, well, and it's also like, crypto is filled with a lot of, like, angsty 20 year olds who, like, I feel like, have never had interpersonal conflict in their life and then turn out to have very crazy interpersonal conflict, you know, in their first ever encounter with it.
00:45:32.432 - 00:45:35.620, Speaker B: There's also 15 year olds and 85 year olds, you know?
00:45:36.340 - 00:45:43.320, Speaker A: Yeah, right, right. Both sides. Sorry. I shouldn't just discriminate against you. It's just there's no 85 year old crypto users as far as I know.
00:45:43.620 - 00:45:45.260, Speaker B: I think there's some. For sure.
00:45:45.300 - 00:45:47.612, Speaker C: I'm sure they're out there. I'm sure they're out there.
00:45:47.796 - 00:45:58.764, Speaker A: It's hard to imagine Biden even being able to, like, you know, when you buy a hardware wallet and they make you retype your phrase, like, he's not going to. He's like, he's gone.
00:45:58.812 - 00:46:02.052, Speaker C: Like, you know what? That is not accessibility friendly. I will. Yeah. That is.
00:46:02.156 - 00:46:06.400, Speaker A: It is like, there's no way. That's what I'm saying. I feel like if 85.
00:46:06.700 - 00:46:09.680, Speaker C: I can barely do those. I'm sure. Yeah. Anybody is in their eighties.
00:46:10.700 - 00:46:18.160, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, real on chain, like your self custodying, whatever. Okay, fine. You're doing it through Coinbase. There's 85 year olds, I'm sure.
00:46:18.780 - 00:46:53.262, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. Okay. All right, well, let's switch gears a little bit. There's one more story that I want to get to that's a little bit more somber. So there was a story that broke today that the SEC, as well as the DOJ, unveiled complaints against the founder of bit clout Nader Al Naji. So I should caveat that Nader, I think, is somebody who I'm pretty sure all four of us know Nader, and I've known Nader for many, many years. We were not investors in bit cloud, but we were investors into basis, which was the previous project that he ran that he shut down in 2018.
00:46:53.262 - 00:47:14.978, Speaker C: So this is many, many, many years ago. So Nader, he is the founder. He was originally the founder of basis, which was the original. The original implementation of senior shares, which was a stable coin. That's kind of Luna like. I mean, Luna is not really a perfect analogy for it, but it was sort of loosely adjacent to Luna. Yeah, it was Luna like never end up launching because they thought that regulatorily it could make it.
00:47:14.978 - 00:48:11.714, Speaker C: But they raised over 130 million for that token, but then gave all the money back. Then Nader emerged many years later to build something called Bitcloud, which you can think of roughly as a predecessor to Friendtech. So it was a social fi app, one of the first really big social fi apps. They raised something like 40 million, 30 million from a 16 z sequoia, a number of other funds that invested, and they basically allowed you to speculate on the demand for a social token corresponding to somebody on Twitter. So you could buy an Elon token, you could buy a Hester purse token, as we later learned, that apparently pissed some people off, and so made a lot of people mad in the way they went around, went about what they were doing with bit cloud. But the charges that have now been filed against Nader were for a couple of things specifically that they did. So, first of all, Nader through Bitcot, which later rebranded to DSO.
00:48:11.714 - 00:49:07.820, Speaker C: If you don't know the name bitcoin, you might know the name Deso. They were charged with one having raised $257 million, which they claimed was purely going to be held on chain. So there was basically like a bonding curve where you could buy bit cloud on chain using bitcoin. And the wallet that you were sending this into was supposedly a decentralized wallet owned by the network dao something, something. This turned out not to be true. It was actually Nader who had unilateral control over this wallet, and he was taking money out of this wallet in contravention to what he was telling to investors as well as to the investing public, that he was taking this money and spending it on influencers personal expenses. He gave some money to his family, he apparently rented a mansion in Beverly Hills, as well as using it to just pay developers and do kind of normal kind of things that one does when one launches a crypto project.
00:49:07.820 - 00:49:52.910, Speaker C: And so he apparently all sorts of stuff that they found in messages that he said to investors, basically denying that he was doing this. And then when they went through all the money, they found out, yes, in fact, he was doing this he was just arrested yesterday in California, and these charges were unveiled today. So curious to get responses from people, because I think this is one that, although I'm not close close with Nader, he literally one of the very. I think I met him the very first year that I came into crypto, and he's sort of been in circles that I think many of us know very well, being in part of the New York cryptocene. New York and then La Cryptocene. So curious to get responses to this. Tarun, I know that you know Nader very well.
00:49:53.530 - 00:49:58.850, Speaker A: What's your take on seeing this? I guess I met him in 2013 because I.
00:49:59.010 - 00:49:59.986, Speaker C: 2013?
00:50:00.178 - 00:50:28.738, Speaker A: Oh, yeah. At D. Shaw. Yeah. And although he was only there for a month and then he, like, left, so I was never really sure what happened. But yeah, he went to this math and science high school that a lot of people I knew went to, and I think he was very. He was one of the few people I met at that time who was a good developer, but also just like a good showman salesman.
00:50:28.738 - 00:51:06.040, Speaker A: And so it was kind of natural he ended up in this vein. I think. He obviously was very aggressive with how the protocol was launched. I think a lot of people were sort of unhappy about their twitter likeness was automatically copied and stuff. I think the allegations in the filing by the DOJ and Sec seemed very different than what I had portrayed realized. I think he must have pitched all of us on investing and no one here invested.
00:51:06.460 - 00:51:07.004, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:51:07.092 - 00:51:24.732, Speaker A: Despite knowing him and whatever. Something was very weird about the pitch also. It was very, like, aggressive, like, you know, closing. Closing. Yeah. But, you know, I think, yeah, it was. It's.
00:51:24.732 - 00:52:09.192, Speaker A: It's the action. The. The, like, raising money than sending money to his family members was kind of the more egregious, surprising thing. I guess I also didn't realize they raised that much money. The other weird thing is a lot of that money was just held in, like, a bitcoin wallet that probably was controlled by one person because it was like a. Maybe I actually forget if it was a multisig or whether it was even just like a single address. Never really understood why it needed its own chain because it was in some ways, but, yeah, people do things you don't expect from the outside.
00:52:09.192 - 00:52:17.340, Speaker A: That's my takeaway. After 8 hours of thinking about. After reading the DOJ filing.
00:52:18.240 - 00:52:49.170, Speaker C: Yeah, I read through everything this morning, and I. I think the first crypto event I ever went to, the first real crypto event, was this IC three boot camp in Cornell, and that was where I first met Nader. That was right after he just published the basecoin whitepaper. I remember he just raised the seed round from naval and a bunch of other folks. And that was when I first met him. And he seemed like an impressive guy and obviously very smart. And I remember he was trying to hire me to join basecoin.
00:52:49.170 - 00:53:25.932, Speaker C: Like always, he was very aggressive, he's a very charismatic guy, and I didn't want to join in. My buddy Yvonne at the time, he also was being very aggressively recruited to join basecoin, and he's very close friends with Nader. At that time. I was just very convinced that basecoin didn't work, that the mechanism was broken and that this thing would eventually break. Little did I know that would end up mattering a lot more many years down the road. But he was always kind of in the loop. He was sort of in these circles of people who are just kind of early in crypto and very, I don't know, connected Silicon Valley types.
00:53:25.932 - 00:54:15.322, Speaker C: And again, he obviously has not. These are the allegations made by the DOJ and by the SeC. He has not obviously had the opportunity to make his counter allegations, but these allegations also seem pretty strong. And they also, these were also things that I was hearing privately that some of the investors who were in bit cloud were very unhappy with the way that he was treating the reserves or the money that was raised. And it was also very clear what he was doing. Looked basically like an ICO, which I think at this point everybody knows is incredibly illegal to just raise money from retail and say, well, buy the bitcloud token. And I'm this pseudonymous person that was very clearly, at the very best, playing extremely fast and loose with how these things are understood to be done.
00:54:15.322 - 00:54:52.450, Speaker C: So, I don't know, on some level, it kind of doesn't surprise me that we got here. I'm kind of like, okay, this guy is kind of cutting way too many corners for this not to catch up with him, especially with how many people were initially pissed off by bit cloud. And then you do this ICO like thing, and then I hear the money is not being used in a way that is totally in line with what he said he was going to do. But it's just, it's just really sad to see shit like this, right? Because, I mean, Nader, by all indications, extremely smart, very talented guy. So it's kind of like, why? Why would you fucking do this? It's so stupid.
00:54:53.550 - 00:55:53.786, Speaker B: The one thing I'll say is I actually thought the way he handled basis was quite ethical. And I say that as a total outsider who wasn't involved in the closing of it, but I actually thought it was remarkable at the time. It's one of those things that left an impression on me as an entrepreneur, is that he raised one of the largest sums of money in crypto history for a project, realized it wouldn't work, and then returned all the capital to investors. Most people would not do that. Most people a, would pivot, find something else to do with it. Broke crazy parties for, like, you know, 100 years, whatever, right? And so it always, like, sat with me that he, as, I think the first startup of his career, raised such a monster amount of capital, never turned it, you know, burned through, like, you know, one or 2% of it, you know, whatever. People got 98% of money back or whatever.
00:55:53.786 - 00:56:38.316, Speaker B: It was like, I always thought that was remarkable. And so I passed on what's now deso, bitcloud, whatever. But I didn't think that a project would go off the rails or would wind up in that direction that bit cloud did after watching how he handled basis, because I thought basis was actually handled very well. It was extremely respectable, in my opinion, how it was handled. You know, I was. I've seen a little bit of back, you know, in the early days of bit cloud when it was like, the things crypto founder finds unnerving are different for everyone, but for me, it was like how they were managing private key security to interact with this blockchain. Like the.
00:56:38.388 - 00:56:42.644, Speaker A: Yeah, I think the text based private key stuff was, like, a little bit weird, right?
00:56:42.692 - 00:57:20.668, Speaker B: It was, like, horrifying to me as a founder where the way you interacted with, you know, bitcloud Washington, the most haphazard approach to, like, asset security and fund security on behalf of, like, pretty retail users, which was like, you know, we, like, click here with your Google. We make like, a text based password for you and, like, upload it to your Google. Like, it was horrifying. And I was like, oh, my God. Like, the biggest corners have been cut in ways that, like, no crypto founder should be cutting corners. Like, a crypto founder should not be jeopardizing user assets, like, so brazenly, so early on. And, you know, I think he learned from it.
00:57:20.668 - 00:57:33.348, Speaker B: The response and the feedback was pretty quick. And, like, you know, I think at some point they changed, you know, the security mechanisms. But, you know, that was the second thing, you know, as an outsider that stuck out to me.
00:57:33.404 - 00:58:43.178, Speaker D: Yeah, I think, as Robert was saying, I think anyone or maybe all of us that looked at DSO, there were like, so many yellow flags that just seemed very sus, like even this bonding curve thing that they used to sell the tokens, there was no accreditation checks, just like you, Chuck Bitcoin and the nodes for the network were closed source for the longest time. And I was like, why is it this thing? And even the platform itself, as you mentioned, got in trouble for having basically a token issuance platform using celebrities likenesses without them opting. I feel like there are so many things about this that just took these flags, which is, but really most of those were not the basis of the complaint. They were mentioned, but they were more as subheaders, really. It was about this misrepresentation to investors and misappropriation of funds. It's don't break the law while you're breaking the law kind of things. And so I think you could duke it out in court if Deso was sufficiently decentralized or if like, hey, you are able to sell Elon Musk coin if you're not the one issuing it.
00:58:43.178 - 00:58:51.990, Speaker D: But the other stuff, it's like, yeah, obviously you can't do that. So yeah, it was a bit surprising to see everything in the chart of the day.
00:58:52.490 - 00:59:33.596, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, look, every startup, it's hard to get everything right. And actually startup, you have few resources and you just got to make a run at it and do your best. And people will usually assume good faith, but if you're fucking with money, there is just so razor thin a margin of error. And if you are appropriating money that is not supposed to be yours and you're spending it on stuff, that shit will come back at you. So it doesn't matter if you're a startup or a billion dollar company, just don't even think about doing anything like that, no matter what size you are, no matter what industry you're in. So crypto is no exception to that. And at the time I was genuinely surprised.
00:59:33.596 - 00:59:47.348, Speaker C: I mean, it's been like four years or something since bit cloud launched. So it took a while for this to eventually come back around, but it did. And eventually, yeah, I guess they clear the backlog cases and they're like, man, we're going to, we're going to get deal.
00:59:47.524 - 00:59:55.758, Speaker A: From reading both cases, do you think it was like an investor who was pushing kind of clearly the dojits kind.
00:59:55.774 - 00:59:59.630, Speaker D: Of one, yeah, yeah.
00:59:59.670 - 01:00:24.514, Speaker C: So somebody who invested 3 million. So if anybody wants to work backwards from that cap table and figure out who's the snitch, I've never seen the cap table, but yeah, no idea. It also could not be investor one. It could just be that they subpoenaed investor one. Right. So we don't actually know. What's pretty clear is that they subpoenaed the records of Nader and they have like almost everything.
01:00:24.514 - 01:01:09.480, Speaker C: I mean, you just see all the messages. So they seem to have done a very, very good job reconstructing the timeline. So if you're a token founder and this is scaring you good like this, if you're fucking with other people's money, that is scary shit and you should take it very, very seriously. And to underscore this as much as we possibly can, absolutely no room for anything like that in this industry or in any industry. So. Well, we'll see where this ends up, but for now, obviously we will be waiting to see how this and the many other cases that are working their way to the courts play out. So I guess that's a wrap on a somewhat somber note.
01:01:09.480 - 01:01:13.440, Speaker C: Until next time. See everybody.
01:01:13.780 - 01:01:15.560, Speaker A: Ciao. Ciao.
