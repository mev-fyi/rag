00:00:00.330 - 00:00:10.474, Speaker A: So right now, the validators and stakers that are running judo Solana are making roughly two and a half to three times more per block than non judo Valders.
00:00:10.522 - 00:00:12.926, Speaker B: Two and a half to three times more?
00:00:13.108 - 00:00:14.826, Speaker A: Yeah. Holy shit.
00:00:15.018 - 00:00:22.186, Speaker B: To be clear, that's like net of inflation. That's not just two to three times more fees. It's two to three times more. Including the block.
00:00:22.218 - 00:00:45.954, Speaker A: Reward. Yeah, I'm just talking about the block reward figure. And then it's kind of up to validators on how they want to distribute them. Ev, do they want to keep it all? Do they want to share it with their stakers? It's all kind of encoded on chain and all the tip programs and stuff like that handle it. So I think the average validator not running Jeto is making around. I think it's 0.1 sol per block.
00:00:45.954 - 00:00:54.220, Speaker A: Ones that are running Jeter are making 0.3 and they kind of distribute it to stakers as they want. And they can choose 0% to 100%.
