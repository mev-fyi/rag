00:00:00.400 - 00:00:24.274, Speaker A: Welcome to this week's crypto roundup. In today's recap, we delve into Changpeng Zhao's sentencing a dip in post airdrop valuations tethers record breaking profits Hong Kong's spot bitcoin and Ethereum ETF's a 16 Z's major investment in optimism and legal challenges facing figures like Roger Ver and the founders of privacy centric crypto Services. Let's begin.
00:00:24.814 - 00:00:27.166, Speaker B: Binance founder Chang Peng Jo sentenced to.
00:00:27.190 - 00:01:20.698, Speaker A: Four months in prison Former Binance CEO Changpeng CZ Zhao has been sentenced to four months in prison by a federal judge in Seattle for failing to comply with the Bank Secrecy act. During the sentencing, Judge Richard Jones emphasized the unprecedented nature of the case in terms of the volume, scale and massiveness of the noncompliance. Despite the prosecution's push for a three year sentence and the defense's argument for probation, Zhao was ordered to serve time in a low security federal prison near Seattle. The sentence concludes a years long Department of Justice Binance investigation, which found systemic anti money laundering failures. Zhao and Binance reached a joint plea deal in November 2023, resulting in a hefty $4.3 billion in penalties for Binance. Zhao personally was on the hook for $50 million.
00:01:20.698 - 00:01:32.724, Speaker A: Justin Paperny, a former broker and advisor to white collar criminals, noted that while the sentence is lenient, Zhao will face significant collateral consequences as a convicted felon.
00:01:33.744 - 00:01:35.840, Speaker B: Steep decline in Renzo and Kamino tokens.
00:01:35.872 - 00:02:31.674, Speaker A: Post airdrop recent airdrops from Defi protocols Renzo and Kamino resulted in sharp declines in their respective tokens, which traded far below their initial expectations. Following their debut on Tuesday, Res plummeted 54%, trading at $0.16, while Camino fell by 78% to just $0.04. Illustrating the challenges facing newly launched tokens, these drops occurred amidst a broader crypto market downturn, which declined almost 10% in April. Even so, Renzo's total value locked grew by over 37%, whereas Camino experienced a 25% reduction in its TVL. Experts point point to a trend where Airdrop recipients quickly sell off their tokens, a strategy favored by short term traders capitalizing on low initial supplies for quick gains. This behavior reflects broader market skepticism toward the sustainability of high valuations set during launches.
00:02:31.674 - 00:02:43.380, Speaker A: Mark Weinstein, a partner at digital assets investment firm Mechanism Capital, noted that investors don't believe there is upside potential if a project launches with an eleven figure valuation.

00:02:46.012 - 00:03:40.942, Speaker A: One profit tether, the company behind popular stablecoin USDT announced a record breaking net profit of $4.5 billion for the first quarter. This impressive financial performance was primarily driven by its substantial holdings in US Treasuries, bitcoin and gold, according to an assurance opinion conducted by global accounting firm BDO. Tethers CEO highlighted the company's commitment to transparency, stability, liquidity and responsible risk management. Noting that tethers financial strength and stability continue to set industry benchmarks, the company reported an increase in net equity reaching $11.37 billion through March 31, up from $7 billion at the end of 2023. Despite these gains, Tether has seen its market share on centralized exchanges decline to 69%, reflecting intense competition within the stablecoin sector.
00:03:40.942 - 00:03:50.870, Speaker A: However, the firm maintains a strong liquidity position, with 90% of tether issued tokens backed by cash and cash equivalents, consensus.
00:03:50.902 - 00:03:54.366, Speaker B: Alleges SEC shift on Ethereum consensys filed.
00:03:54.390 - 00:04:36.344, Speaker A: A complaint alleging that the US securities and Exchange Commission reversed its previous position that Ethereum was not a security. According to the unredacted complaint released Monday, the SEC had already begun investigating Ethereum as a potential security in March 2023. In a related development, Representative Patrick McHenry, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, accused SEC chair Gary Gensler of misleading Congress about the agency's view on Ethereum. McHenry highlighted that the SEC was actively investigating Ethereum as a security days before Gensler's appearance in Congress, suggesting a deliberate attempt to avoid disclosure of the commission's evolving stance.
00:04:37.444 - 00:04:40.588, Speaker B: Hong Kong's spot bitcoin and Ethereum ETF's.
00:04:40.636 - 00:05:36.676, Speaker A: Launch with moderate success Hong Kong's financial markets witnessed the debut of six newspot bitcoin and Ethereum ETF's, recording over hk$80 million or $10 million in traded shares on their first day. This marks Hong Kong as the first market in Asia to allow trading of spot virtual asset ETF's. The trading volume in Hong Kong pales in comparison to the us counterparts, which saw $4.5 billion on their inaugural day. However, the introduction of these ETF's still represents a considerable achievement, outperforming the region's previous bitcoin and Ethereum futures ETF's, which had an average daily turnover of $6.5 million in the first quarter of 2024. These ETF's, managed by Harvest Global Investments, China Asset Management and a partnership between Bocera and Hashke, offer investors the unique feature of physical redemptions.
00:05:36.676 - 00:05:43.464, Speaker A: Aligning closely with the practices of traditional ETF's and allowing for direct investment from bitcoin miners.

The purchase includes a two year vesting period, suggesting a long term commitment from the VC firm to the Optimism project. This move coincides with optimism's increasing adoption, notably by celo developers, who recently selected Optimism's op tech stack to develop their L2 blockchain solutions and Coinbase's base, which also chose the op tech stack. Us stablecoin regulation efforts stalled efforts to pass us stablecoin regulation encountered another setback as attempts to attach the bill to the Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization were blocked by congressional leaders. Advocates for the stablecoin legislation, including House Financial Services Committee chair Patrick McHenry and ranking Democrat Representative Maxine Waters, had hoped to expedite its passage by linking it with the must pass FAA legislation. Despite the setback, there is momentum to find another legislative vehicle for the stablecoin regulations, possibly aligning it with high profile marijuana legislation. Simultaneously, us representatives introduced a separate bill aimed at clarifying the taxation of staking rewards.
00:07:05.394 - 00:07:18.384, Speaker A: The providing tax clarity for Digital Assets act seeks to ensure that taxes on these rewards are only applied at the time of sale, aiming to simplify the current complex taxation landscape and prevent double taxation.
00:07:18.544 - 00:07:21.056, Speaker B: Roger Ver, known as bitcoin Jesus indicted.
00:07:21.080 - 00:07:55.050, Speaker A: For tax fraud Roger Ver, an early bitcoin investor and advocate nicknamed bitcoin Jesus, has been indicted for tax fraud by the US Department of Justice. The indictment alleges that Ver failed to file tax returns and did not pay taxes on capital gains from substantial bitcoin sales in 2017, totaling about $240 million. Although no longer a us citizen, ver was still obligated to report and pay taxes on certain distributions from us corporations. He was arrested in Spain with the US seeking his extradition.

00:08:46.813 - 00:09:51.894, Speaker A: Keon Rodriguez, co founder of the privacy focused Samurai wallet, pleaded not guilty on charges of money laundering and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. Arrested in Pennsylvania, Rodriguez was released on a $1 million bond and has been confined to house arrest until his trial. The DOJ alleges that from 2015 until the recent seizure of Samurai Wallet servers, the app facilitated over $100 million in illegal transactions from dark web markets. Rodriguez's next hearing is scheduled for May 14 in Manhattan. This case parallels the DOJ's actions against Tornado Cash, where developers face similar allegations of facilitating unlawful transactions through their crypto mixing service. Like Rodriguez, Tornado cash developer Roman Storm is also contesting DOJ claims, arguing that Tornado Cash did not operate as a custodial financial institution. This week, the DOJ challenged storm's motion to dismiss charges, reaffirming the services role in money laundering and unlicensed money transmission.
