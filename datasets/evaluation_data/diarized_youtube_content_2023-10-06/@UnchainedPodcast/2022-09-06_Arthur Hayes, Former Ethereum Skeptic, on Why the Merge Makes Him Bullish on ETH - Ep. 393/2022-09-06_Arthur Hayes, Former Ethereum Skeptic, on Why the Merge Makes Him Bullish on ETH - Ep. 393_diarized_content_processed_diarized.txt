00:01:29.250 - 00:01:33.974, Speaker C: Here to discuss is Arthur Hayes, cofounder of BitMax. Welcome, Arthur.
00:01:34.102 - 00:01:35.130, Speaker A: Thanks for having me.
00:01:35.200 - 00:02:25.162, Speaker C: A quick note before starting, my Twitter followers might have seen that this episode was initially supposed to be a conversation between Arthur and Willy Woo. However, Willy sick. So even though this is what I think of as a topic episode, which is usually conversation between two people on various topics, we are going to do it with a single guest. But for those of you who are familiar with Arthur's blog, I'm sure you're quite well aware that he is expert enough to handle all this alone. So, Arthur, this has been one of the most tumultuous times in crypto history. Not only are the crypto markets just a shade above their all time highs at the top of the 2017 28 bubble, but we've also seen multiple spectacular implosions and bankruptcies terra, Luna, Three Arrows, Capital, Celsius, and Voyager. Meanwhile, amidst historic inflation, some say Bitcoin has failed to act as the inflation hedge who has touted me.
00:02:25.162 - 00:02:47.140, Speaker C: And on top of all, Matt, we are heading into Ethereum's merge, quite possibly the most anticipated upgrade to a blockchain ever. You have been in the space for a very long time, as far as I can tell, at least as early as 2014, if not earlier. So I was just kind of curious for your overall thoughts on this kind of crazy moment in crypto years from now. How will we look back on this time?
00:02:47.830 - 00:03:21.978, Speaker D: I think that this is no crazier than the melt gox failure in 2014 in February, no crazier than the Ethereum and bitcoin and ICO implosion in early 2018. This is new technology. We're reconfiguring how humans want to do finance over the Internet. It's extremely speculative, it's extremely religious and exciting and there's haters and there's people who love it. There's all this emotion, then you mix money with it.
00:03:22.064 - 00:03:24.846, Speaker A: And so I think these events over.
00:03:24.868 - 00:03:30.330, Speaker D: The last six months let's call it 2022, I would say are par for the course for crypto.
00:03:30.490 - 00:03:48.630, Speaker C: All right, so let's just start talking about the merge, because this is what everyone's been talking about. In general, I find your trajectory around Ethereum quite interesting because you used to think ethereum was worthless. So let's just start at that time. What was your thinking about Ethereum initially?
00:03:48.970 - 00:04:05.834, Speaker D: So, initially, when the presale happened, 2014 or 2015, whenever it was, it was probably the first major ICO of this ecosystem. And I didn't really see value in going out to the market and saying.
00:04:05.872 - 00:04:08.122, Speaker A: Hey, give me a bunch of money.
00:04:08.176 - 00:04:15.326, Speaker D: And I'm not going to fix the price or the supply of what I'm offering. And so it's almost like if we take $100 million or we take $10.
00:04:15.348 - 00:04:17.966, Speaker A: Million, you as a person who's putting.
00:04:17.988 - 00:04:32.754, Speaker D: In this money aren't really to me, it didn't seem like you're getting anything beneficial. So I'm like, well, why would I want to invest in something like that? Where's the scarcity? How do I know that I'm actually like committing my scarce capital today and I'm going to be better off than.
00:04:32.792 - 00:04:37.058, Speaker A: Somebody who comes in six months from now? And I didn't see that and I.
00:04:37.064 - 00:04:38.838, Speaker D: Wrote about it and I said, this.
00:04:38.844 - 00:04:42.534, Speaker A: Is complete dog shit. I'm not investing in this.
00:04:42.732 - 00:04:49.094, Speaker D: And of course I was wrong, which is fine. That's the name of the game. When you're talking about financial markets, you're wrong more than you're right.
00:04:49.132 - 00:04:50.826, Speaker A: You just hope that you bet on.
00:04:50.848 - 00:05:04.750, Speaker D: The things that you're right on more than the things that you're wrong on. So, thankfully, I didn't short ethereum. That would have been not such a good idea. But, yeah, I missed it. I missed the presale, which is fine. You can't beat everything.
00:05:04.820 - 00:05:10.090, Speaker A: And subsequently, I think I wrote a piece called Two Digits Coin.
00:05:10.250 - 00:05:17.106, Speaker D: When Ether was around five or $600, whenever that was, in 2018, I got that one right. It went down to below 100 for.
00:05:17.128 - 00:05:18.386, Speaker A: A period of time.
00:05:18.568 - 00:05:35.666, Speaker D: And then as sort of the DFI ecosystem started to have some green shoots after the March 2020 meltdown, there was somebody posted on Twitter, or I saw an email, I don't remember where it was, and there was a chart, it showed the complete value of all DApps.
00:05:35.698 - 00:05:41.882, Speaker A: Built on ethereum was greater than the value of ethereum. So one of two things has to be true.
00:05:41.936 - 00:06:03.540, Speaker D: Either all these DApps, which were down 95% from the highs of 2017, are just completely worthless, or Ethereum is extremely undervalued. And I took the road of Ethereum is extremely undervalued. And so I went long, a lot of it, and very good trade covered up a lot of the other bad things that I did with my portfolio over the same period of time.
00:06:03.910 - 00:06:13.026, Speaker A: That's sort of my rocky road of Ethereum. And starting in early 2020 and then.
00:06:13.128 - 00:06:28.982, Speaker D: 2021, you really had this explosion of DFI and all these new financial primitives people actually starting to use these things, hundreds of billions of dollars of Total Value Locked. And you're starting to see the real value proposition of what Ethereum can do and what it's enabled some really smart.
00:06:29.046 - 00:06:35.850, Speaker A: And innovative engineers and financial technologists to build for this new ecosystem.
00:06:36.190 - 00:07:08.180, Speaker C: And I've seen you talk and write about this, about how you feel that DeFi or Total Value locked is a proxy for the value of Ethereum. And I've also seen you talk about how you could value a blockchain or the price of its token by comparing it to the revenues of existing financial services. So I was wondering because in the case of Ethereum, obviously there's more than just DeFi. So I was curious, do you also factor in other things like NFTs or Dows or in general, how do you think about kind of like other types of activity and their relationship to the price?
00:07:08.550 - 00:07:11.822, Speaker A: So I'm extremely bullish on the concepts.
00:07:11.886 - 00:07:14.498, Speaker D: Or the technological concept of NFTs.
00:07:14.594 - 00:07:19.298, Speaker A: And I think I've written that I think allows us to trade human culture.
00:07:19.474 - 00:07:44.626, Speaker D: Now, obviously people think some of the human culture that is currently being traded is extremely vulgar. I have a crypto dick butt on my Twitter profile and all sorts of JPEGs that are worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. And people like, what is this? Why are these people trading these images that I can copy and paste? And I don't think they get the point. It's the same as why do you have a luxury watch? A swatch is just fine. That's $100 that you have, $100,000 watch, right?
00:07:44.648 - 00:07:53.218, Speaker A: It's all the same stuff in my opinion. And so I think the NFT technological construct is going to unlock trillions of.
00:07:53.224 - 00:08:03.858, Speaker D: Dollars of value in the ways in which we interact socially with each other over the Internet. And we can now trade these things that are representations of communities and culture and whatnot.
00:08:04.034 - 00:08:07.638, Speaker A: But again, extremely early NFTs have kind.
00:08:07.644 - 00:08:18.186, Speaker D: Of gone through like half a market cycle of the first one. So obviously most of this stuff is going to go down 99%, if not completely worthless, but that's just how it goes. But I do see extreme promise in that.
00:08:18.208 - 00:08:22.982, Speaker A: But I don't think the NFTs are really driving throughput.
00:08:23.046 - 00:08:28.446, Speaker D: Obviously Openc. Openc looks rare and a few other platforms are doing quite well in terms.
00:08:28.468 - 00:08:31.646, Speaker A: Of activity generated, but they're not at.
00:08:31.668 - 00:08:55.138, Speaker D: The same level as the total value of all of the financial aspect of Ethereum. And then you haven't really even gotten to the Self sovereign identity and Ethereum name service. Can we replace DNS and all these other things, which is still extremely early. So I think the financial aspect is very easy to understand, especially for a former financial markets professional. I understand trading, I understand markets.
00:08:55.314 - 00:08:57.158, Speaker A: You charge a training fee, people come.
00:08:57.164 - 00:09:05.002, Speaker D: On there, they exchange assets. It's quite easy to understand some of this other more meta stuff. I think it's going to take a little bit longer to be recognized as.
00:09:05.056 - 00:09:07.206, Speaker A: A big value driver for the network.
00:09:07.398 - 00:09:43.026, Speaker C: Okay, well, I will keep reading your blog post. I'm very interested down the line when you come up with a way to figure out how to add that into the value to see how you do it. All right, now let's talk more directly about the merge. One of the premises of your thesis, and in general, kind of the main thesis behind this ultrasound money meme, is that after the merge ethereum's monetary supply could become deflationary. However, for the last month or so usage on ethereum has actually been down. And so actually at current rates of usage, ETH will still be slightly inflationary after the merge. I mean, if that level is maintained.
00:09:43.026 - 00:09:51.846, Speaker C: And I was just wondering how you thought about that. Do you think that most likely usage will increase, that this is just sort of a blip or at a macro.
00:09:51.878 - 00:09:56.570, Speaker D: Level it doesn't matter, right? Because if we take the bitcoin example.
00:09:56.720 - 00:10:01.738, Speaker A: The bitcoin inflation rate reduces. It doesn't go to deflation after at.
00:10:01.744 - 00:10:02.842, Speaker D: Least it hasn't yet.
00:10:02.976 - 00:10:08.686, Speaker A: After a having yet, the price still goes up. Right? And now we expect that every having.
00:10:08.788 - 00:10:11.946, Speaker D: Over a period of many years, the price of bitcoin will appreciate.
00:10:11.978 - 00:10:14.314, Speaker A: Whether or not that continues to hold true, who knows?
00:10:14.362 - 00:10:36.726, Speaker D: But it has in the past, was it three or four times that it's happened previously? So ethereum doesn't need to go to deflation. I mean that's even better if that happens, right, in terms of the procyclical nature of the reflexivity of the price and the usage and the price and the usage. But even just reducing the inflation rate, what is it, like 90% or whatever that number is in terms of the.
00:10:36.748 - 00:10:38.614, Speaker A: Amount of ether that's going to be.
00:10:38.652 - 00:10:41.558, Speaker D: Emitted versus the consumption that's happening, versus.
00:10:41.654 - 00:10:44.954, Speaker A: The applications on the blockchain, it's still.
00:10:45.072 - 00:10:48.506, Speaker D: A massive reduction, a massive change in the inflation. That's what we care about.
00:10:48.608 - 00:10:50.902, Speaker A: We don't care about the absolute target.
00:10:50.966 - 00:10:57.358, Speaker D: At the end of however many decades or hundreds of years. We care about the change today and what that portends to the future.
00:10:57.444 - 00:11:00.122, Speaker A: And so cool, okay, maybe it's not deflationary.
00:11:00.266 - 00:11:06.386, Speaker D: Doesn't matter if the inflation rate was at X and now it's at 0.1 of X.
00:11:06.568 - 00:11:11.234, Speaker A: That to me still means that at the margin you're going to have more.
00:11:11.432 - 00:11:16.850, Speaker D: Demand from people who need to spend money on gas than there is supply being emitted naturally through the network.
00:11:17.830 - 00:11:31.958, Speaker C: And also the merge won't really do much to improve scaling issues. So that could potentially lead other layer ones to continue to take market share from ethereum. Do you think that could have a depressive effect on the price of ETH? Or is that not something that you're.
00:11:32.054 - 00:11:34.362, Speaker D: I mean, that's just par for the course, right?
00:11:34.416 - 00:11:38.300, Speaker A: Everyone knows that ETH doesn't scale, whatever that means, right?
00:11:38.670 - 00:11:41.626, Speaker D: If you're the Solana guy, well, ETH doesn't scale, but then your network goes down.
00:11:41.648 - 00:11:42.574, Speaker A: I don't know.
00:11:42.772 - 00:11:58.722, Speaker D: We can talk about that one another day, but that meme hasn't changed today or tomorrow or yesterday, who cares? That is what it is. But we have a one discrete opportunity. We have a proof of work blockchain going to proof of stake, and you have this massive reduction in the amount.
00:11:58.776 - 00:12:02.622, Speaker A: Of ether emitted and no other blockchain.
00:12:02.686 - 00:12:04.354, Speaker D: Has this set up like this.
00:12:04.472 - 00:12:06.606, Speaker A: And that's why I like this trading.
00:12:06.638 - 00:12:25.642, Speaker D: Opportunity or this value play for ether, because it's just so idiosyncratic to ether and there's only these one time events. And so who cares if ETH doesn't scale? Unless you're telling me that after the merge, no one's going to use Uniswap, no one's going to use Aave, no one's going to use OpenSea and that the network uses goes down to zero.
00:12:25.696 - 00:12:29.802, Speaker A: Who cares if Solana's advertised TPS is higher?
00:12:29.856 - 00:12:33.726, Speaker D: It was the same advertised TPS before the merge, the same one after the.
00:12:33.748 - 00:12:36.366, Speaker A: Merge, so it doesn't matter.
00:12:36.548 - 00:13:05.990, Speaker C: Now, let's talk about the trades that you've been talking about or kind of your plan going in, which I find it fascinating that you reveal this publicly. But anyway, in your essay ETH Flexive, you walked through the way the ETH futures contracts are currently trading and then what that means about the market believes what that means about what the market believes about the merge. And your conclusion was that the market's confidence in a successful merge is understated. Walk us through how you reach that conclusion.
00:13:06.490 - 00:13:11.814, Speaker A: Well, I say I take myself, for example, right? I still don't believe it's going to happen.
00:13:11.852 - 00:13:16.986, Speaker D: I mean, obviously I believe in the macro sense that it's going to happen. But if you ask me today, is.
00:13:17.008 - 00:13:21.980, Speaker A: The ETH merge 100% going to happen? No. I don't know. Tech is hard.
00:13:23.150 - 00:13:29.626, Speaker D: I have faith that these guys can pull it off. But as somebody who has run a tech company, stuff's always late, stuff doesn't.
00:13:29.658 - 00:13:36.318, Speaker A: Work, and so I'm fully prepared for it happens. And then something fucked up they didn't.
00:13:36.334 - 00:13:58.598, Speaker D: Really anticipate and we could be talking about a massive rollback of these changes. I literally cannot give you a probability on that happening now. Obviously, people much smarter than me say, no, it's fine, they did all the testing, blah, blah, blah. But if you've been around in this space for as long as I have, you get a bit jaded because everyone's always talking about what they're going to do. Well, do it and show me, prove it to me that you did it.
00:13:58.604 - 00:14:01.240, Speaker A: And then it worked, and then I'll believe you.
00:14:01.710 - 00:14:04.506, Speaker D: And I think that's where a lot of people are in the ecosystem is.
00:14:04.528 - 00:14:07.306, Speaker A: Like show me that it works, and.
00:14:07.328 - 00:14:12.986, Speaker D: Then I'll believe you. And then I'll be really okay with probably going even longer than I thought.
00:14:13.008 - 00:14:15.006, Speaker A: I was going to going into it.
00:14:15.028 - 00:14:16.206, Speaker D: And so I think that's where you.
00:14:16.228 - 00:14:19.290, Speaker A: Get the hedging from people who have ETH.
00:14:19.370 - 00:14:21.214, Speaker D: It's like, okay, I have this discrete event.
00:14:21.252 - 00:14:29.842, Speaker A: I know that it'll happen on around this Septemberish time frame, and it's either going to work or it's not going to work.
00:14:29.976 - 00:14:34.482, Speaker D: So why don't I just hedge away maybe a few months of that time.
00:14:34.536 - 00:14:37.320, Speaker A: Period, see what happens?
00:14:37.850 - 00:14:48.360, Speaker D: Worst case scenario, doesn't work. Okay, I've completely hedged myself, and so then I can uncover my hedge once things the dust settles and then reevaluate my position.
00:14:48.730 - 00:14:50.694, Speaker A: Best case scenario, oh, boom.
00:14:50.742 - 00:14:52.406, Speaker D: Go swimmingly. Just buy back my hedge.
00:14:52.438 - 00:14:57.882, Speaker A: Okay, I lost 1020 percent, but that's better than being down 50%, right?
00:14:57.936 - 00:15:03.274, Speaker D: So the risk reward for a lot of people who can't have 100% confidence.
00:15:03.322 - 00:15:09.486, Speaker A: In this very technologically difficult event, it makes sense to hedge it.
00:15:09.508 - 00:15:20.434, Speaker D: And that's why I believe you see the curve on the futures contracts. The futures contracts trade below the spot price because there's a lot of pressure from people who are long eve saying, I just want to hedge this time.
00:15:20.472 - 00:15:27.220, Speaker A: Period when it's know good or bad, then I can know what to do with my position.
00:15:27.530 - 00:15:45.146, Speaker C: So in early August, you gave some price predictions for ether based on what the Fed did and how successful the merge was. Can you walk us through how you came up with those different scenarios and also talk about how roughly a month later, your projections have changed, if at all?
00:15:45.248 - 00:15:48.650, Speaker A: So, yeah, I mean, I guess at the end of the day, there's the.
00:15:48.720 - 00:15:55.134, Speaker D: Macro liquidity dollar issue, right? And I think that's represented by Bitcoin, because Bitcoin is just pure crypto money.
00:15:55.332 - 00:15:59.662, Speaker A: And it's a mirror image of the US. Dollar financial system.
00:15:59.716 - 00:16:01.134, Speaker D: We want to do something different.
00:16:01.252 - 00:16:03.994, Speaker A: We think it's better. Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.
00:16:04.042 - 00:16:16.894, Speaker D: And so it's a reaction to this system. And so obviously, it's going to be very tied to liquidity considerations of that. So you have essentially the Federal Reserve holds all the cards. They either can turn it on or turn it off in terms of US. Dollar liquidity.
00:16:16.942 - 00:16:18.038, Speaker A: And right now it's off.
00:16:18.124 - 00:16:20.726, Speaker D: Right? And so the question is, are they.
00:16:20.748 - 00:16:23.590, Speaker A: Going to turn it on very soon or not?
00:16:23.660 - 00:16:25.958, Speaker D: So that's a binary outcome when the.
00:16:25.964 - 00:16:27.798, Speaker A: One we know, Powell will get up.
00:16:27.804 - 00:16:32.698, Speaker D: There and tell us we've achieved our targets and we're going to make money easier or not.
00:16:32.864 - 00:16:35.286, Speaker A: Right. And then you also have the ethereum.
00:16:35.318 - 00:16:37.610, Speaker D: Merge either going to happen successfully or it's not.
00:16:37.680 - 00:16:42.118, Speaker A: So you have two outcomes, four possible possibilities.
00:16:42.214 - 00:16:48.542, Speaker D: And so you kind of just have to think through what each one of those represents in terms of your idea of what a price is and then.
00:16:48.596 - 00:16:53.966, Speaker A: Put a handicap probability on those, and.
00:16:53.988 - 00:16:57.086, Speaker D: Then you get your expected value. If your expected value is larger than.
00:16:57.108 - 00:16:59.922, Speaker A: The current spot price, then you go long.
00:16:59.976 - 00:17:08.974, Speaker D: And if it's not, then you either do nothing or you go short. And so want to approach it from that perspective because I can't sit here and say that I'm going to be right on my calls.
00:17:09.102 - 00:17:10.258, Speaker A: If I've looked through all the calls.
00:17:10.274 - 00:17:13.382, Speaker D: I've ever made with my portfolio, I've been wrong more than I've been right.
00:17:13.436 - 00:17:15.026, Speaker A: But I just have to bet correctly.
00:17:15.058 - 00:17:16.600, Speaker D: On the ones that I'm right about.
00:17:17.050 - 00:17:28.060, Speaker C: So your ultimate call was that by March 31, ETH would have a price of $2,800. Can you talk us a little bit through your thinking around why that is?
00:17:28.830 - 00:17:40.126, Speaker D: I don't have the math in front of me that was just purely take 25% probability of each outcome. I had an expectation of a price and I had a rationale behind it. And then I just plugged in the math and then out came that number.
00:17:40.228 - 00:18:19.302, Speaker C: Okay, yeah, we'll just link to it in the show notes. I find it fascinating because I think so much of the crypto world just is looking kind of narrowly at what's happening in crypto. There are obviously certain players in crypto who have that more macro perspective, but I liked how this analysis sort of combined the two. One thing that is looking like it's going to cause a little bit of chaos in Ethereum, or maybe not. I don't know what your opinion is, is that the Ethereum proof of work chain, it looks like, will continue? Who knows how kind of robust it will be? But I wanted to hear your take on that. How will that affect events as they play out around the merge?
00:18:19.446 - 00:18:21.306, Speaker A: I don't think again, this is all.
00:18:21.328 - 00:18:22.986, Speaker D: Predicated on the reason why Ethereum is.
00:18:23.008 - 00:18:24.646, Speaker A: Valuable is because people use it, right?
00:18:24.688 - 00:18:26.334, Speaker D: And the majority of people who use.
00:18:26.372 - 00:18:29.578, Speaker A: Ethereum are not very technologically savvy.
00:18:29.674 - 00:18:32.846, Speaker D: So if I come to you and I said, hey, there's ETH proof of.
00:18:32.868 - 00:18:41.154, Speaker A: Work and there's ETH proof of stake, which one do you want to use? Like, I don't know. What does that even mean? I just want to use Ethereum, right?
00:18:41.192 - 00:18:42.146, Speaker D: I just want to go on my.
00:18:42.168 - 00:18:46.562, Speaker A: MetaMask and go on uniswap and buy some not.
00:18:46.616 - 00:18:55.558, Speaker D: There's this thing of what's going on and the details of how consensus is arrived at and security considerations. Essentially they don't give a fuck about that.
00:18:55.724 - 00:18:57.686, Speaker A: I just want to do what I want to do.
00:18:57.708 - 00:18:59.922, Speaker D: I want to use this new ecosystem.
00:18:59.986 - 00:19:01.226, Speaker A: And it's pretty cool that I can.
00:19:01.248 - 00:19:02.666, Speaker D: Just go on my browser and go.
00:19:02.688 - 00:19:08.058, Speaker A: To MetaMask and do stuff. So to the extent that from what.
00:19:08.064 - 00:19:09.226, Speaker D: I've observed, and maybe you can correct.
00:19:09.248 - 00:19:11.226, Speaker A: Me if I'm wrong, majority of the.
00:19:11.248 - 00:19:14.158, Speaker D: Service providers or the major DApps in.
00:19:14.164 - 00:19:20.718, Speaker A: Ethereum are all following the proof of stake merge. They're not following the proof of work.
00:19:20.804 - 00:19:30.562, Speaker D: Some of the major stablecoins, like I think Tether and USDC have come out and said we're not following the proof of work. So you have some of the major assets, some of the major services that.
00:19:30.616 - 00:19:34.066, Speaker A: The average user interacts with are not.
00:19:34.088 - 00:19:56.278, Speaker D: Going to be supporting these other chains. So where are the users going to come from? Are they going to go and configure the MetaMask so that they can get on the proper chain and find a proper node provider who's up to date with the proof of work chain and go through this whole process? Maybe they're going to try to set up their own node or it just gets really complicated really fast. And what you get to the conclusion.
00:19:56.294 - 00:19:59.786, Speaker A: Of is they will have no users. Now they may have a bit of.
00:19:59.808 - 00:20:09.290, Speaker D: People wanting to trade it like me because it's interesting and if it has a value above zero, it's just free money. But how are you going to convince the average person who's currently using Ethereum.
00:20:09.450 - 00:20:13.482, Speaker A: Why they should be using the Ethereum proof of work chain?
00:20:13.626 - 00:20:32.114, Speaker D: And I think you could have a similar sort of analysis of Bitcoin cash and some of these other go back to the forks of all the different Bitcoin forks that happened back when we were talking about the block size debate and was that 2017? How many of those have actually done very well in price performance versus the asset they were supposed to supplant bitcoin.
00:20:32.242 - 00:20:33.650, Speaker A: From that period onward?
00:20:33.730 - 00:20:37.270, Speaker D: And the answer is none of them because the users don't care.
00:20:37.340 - 00:20:39.766, Speaker A: I mean, we care because this is.
00:20:39.788 - 00:20:50.118, Speaker D: What we do for a living and this is all these tribes on social media and people are slinging mud at each other and all that kind of stuff. But the person who's using it, the person who gives value to these networks.
00:20:50.214 - 00:20:52.874, Speaker A: Couldn'T give a about proof of stake or proof of work.
00:20:52.912 - 00:20:55.818, Speaker D: They just want to use Ethereum. So if MetaMask has Ethereum as proof.
00:20:55.834 - 00:20:57.934, Speaker A: Of stake, that's the Ethereum that they're using.
00:20:58.052 - 00:21:02.000, Speaker C: And so how will you be trading the proof of work coins that you get?
00:21:02.370 - 00:21:27.702, Speaker D: If I get some proof of work coins, I will try to sell them at a very opportune time. Maybe that's as soon as they come out, maybe it's not, I don't know. It depends on the hash rate where they're trading on different exchanges. It's such an interesting trading opportunity and just making sure that you're all set up and ready to go and looking at the derivatives and the spot and there's going to be mispricings everywhere assuming that this happens. So maybe you're closer to it than I am.
00:21:27.836 - 00:21:29.906, Speaker A: I don't know if one of these.
00:21:29.948 - 00:21:32.954, Speaker D: Mining consortiums have gotten together to really.
00:21:33.072 - 00:21:35.754, Speaker A: Put forward a credible proof of work.
00:21:35.872 - 00:21:45.110, Speaker D: Split that's going to be traded and the blockchain is actually going to work. So we can actually send different coins around to the different centralized exchanges and obviously the centralized spot exchanges are going.
00:21:45.120 - 00:21:46.870, Speaker A: To have to support this thing whether or not.
00:21:46.880 - 00:21:49.898, Speaker D: They have the same appetite to do that today versus back in 2017.
00:21:49.994 - 00:21:50.862, Speaker A: I don't know.
00:21:50.996 - 00:22:00.610, Speaker C: Yeah, now that I think I should have checked the facts on this before because I thought that there was a centralized exchange that said they would oh, yeah, it was polo. Polo.
00:22:01.350 - 00:22:08.362, Speaker D: But it's an IOU. If it doesn't happen, then your IOUs.
00:22:08.446 - 00:22:13.206, Speaker A: Is worthless because they actually are going to have this. And you lock your ethereum, you get.
00:22:13.228 - 00:22:15.190, Speaker D: To split it into this IU token.
00:22:15.850 - 00:22:18.006, Speaker A: But if the IOU token, if the.
00:22:18.028 - 00:22:20.566, Speaker D: Eigth POW, whatever that is, whoever launches.
00:22:20.598 - 00:22:24.650, Speaker A: It never happens, then that IU tokens are worthless.
00:22:25.310 - 00:22:29.434, Speaker D: Great. You've had a trading opportunity between now and September the 15th or whenever it is.
00:22:29.472 - 00:22:32.234, Speaker A: But post that, who knows?
00:22:32.362 - 00:23:18.730, Speaker C: Okay, one thing that I find fascinating is that Kevin Joe made so much noise about this because he traded the Dow Classic, or Ethereum Classic, I should call it coins, I think, to his benefit back in the day. But my take is that that worked because it was a surprise. And so I was kind of like, why was he signaling what he was going to do? But anyway, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe by making noise about it, he got more people interested. But anyway, one other thing that I saw that you wrote about, which was fascinating, was you talked about how LDO was another way to kind of bet on the merge. You talked about how it was like a riskier but still attractive bet, and I wanted you to talk a little bit about that. What's your thesis there, and why is it riskier?
00:23:19.070 - 00:23:21.686, Speaker A: So they're the number one validator.
00:23:21.798 - 00:23:24.378, Speaker D: People stake their ETH into this pool.
00:23:24.554 - 00:23:27.166, Speaker A: And they stand to benefit that's their.
00:23:27.188 - 00:23:32.654, Speaker D: Only business is doing this, right? So if the merge doesn't happen or it's corrupted or it doesn't work, then.
00:23:32.692 - 00:23:43.378, Speaker A: Their business model is completely whereas ethereum, if Ethereum merge doesn't work, ethereum right now works. It works just fine. I mean, I'm sure some people would say it doesn't work just fine, but.
00:23:43.464 - 00:23:45.250, Speaker D: The apps are used, people use them.
00:23:45.320 - 00:23:52.694, Speaker A: The blockchain exists, network operates. So, okay, they fuck it up real bad and doesn't work, they can always.
00:23:52.732 - 00:23:54.246, Speaker D: Go back to what they were doing before.
00:23:54.428 - 00:23:58.466, Speaker A: But LDO doesn't have a business model other than please give us your ETH.
00:23:58.498 - 00:24:00.518, Speaker D: So we can validate on this new.
00:24:00.604 - 00:24:03.318, Speaker A: Proof of stake instance of so that's.
00:24:03.334 - 00:24:08.250, Speaker D: Why it's extremely risky because there is no fallback option. If this doesn't work, then there's no value there.
00:24:08.400 - 00:24:52.394, Speaker C: And you've probably heard about how Lido is potentially a centralizing force on Ethereum after the merge, to the point where, in effect, let's say there's some huge percentage of people that not only stake but want to get liquidity out of their stake tokens. And there's this perception that there will be sort of a winner take all liquid staking provider. And many people expect that will be Lido. And because Lido has on chain governance but ethereum doesn't. Some people are worried that Lido will effectively be a centralizing force and sort of kind of almost be like having on chain governance just amongst the LDO token holders. So I was curious for your thoughts on like is that something you're worried about or concerned about?
00:24:52.512 - 00:25:01.934, Speaker A: Not really, it's kind of a free market. Someone can obviously spin up a new value or service, charge a lower fee and offer more incentives, whatever those are.
00:25:01.972 - 00:25:04.240, Speaker D: Maybe it's governance tokens of their own.
00:25:04.930 - 00:25:13.326, Speaker A: Making, a creation and spirit trading volume away or so not trading volume, but locked ethereum or mindshare, whatever.
00:25:13.428 - 00:25:14.938, Speaker D: So I don't really think maybe there's.
00:25:14.954 - 00:25:23.858, Speaker A: A period of time where they would have a lot of influence, but I think the amount of different ways in which people can change the game would.
00:25:23.944 - 00:25:29.238, Speaker D: To me, point to there's going to be competition in this validator space because it is a very lucrative business if.
00:25:29.244 - 00:25:31.894, Speaker A: You can get it right. Similar to how we all freaked out.
00:25:31.932 - 00:25:34.646, Speaker D: About one minor having 51% of the.
00:25:34.668 - 00:25:37.686, Speaker A: Network back in the day with some.
00:25:37.708 - 00:25:39.646, Speaker D: Of the Chinese miners and those fears.
00:25:39.698 - 00:25:42.220, Speaker A: Came, they passed, we're still here.
00:25:42.670 - 00:25:46.940, Speaker D: So I think maybe that's a wall of worry that people could climb over.
00:25:47.390 - 00:25:52.326, Speaker C: So you don't think Lido will be like 80% of liquid staking derivatives or anything like that?
00:25:52.368 - 00:25:55.806, Speaker D: It could. What I'm saying is that situation is.
00:25:55.828 - 00:25:57.150, Speaker A: Not going to persist forever.
00:25:57.570 - 00:26:16.382, Speaker C: Okay, yeah, we'll have to see how that plays out. That's something that I'm definitely watching. So one other issue is that after the merge, the Shanghai upgrade which will occur like maybe six months or a year after the merge will begin to allow stakers to withdraw. And I wondered how you expect that to affect the price of ETH.
00:26:16.526 - 00:26:17.490, Speaker A: I have no idea.
00:26:17.560 - 00:26:22.162, Speaker D: I think it's too far in the future to understand what the price implications.
00:26:22.226 - 00:26:23.766, Speaker A: Are and more thing, I don't think.
00:26:23.788 - 00:26:25.334, Speaker D: It really matters for today in terms.
00:26:25.372 - 00:26:28.966, Speaker A: Of what you're going to do if you're taking a more short term view.
00:26:28.988 - 00:26:38.506, Speaker D: On this merge of the price impact over the next three to six months. All this supply supposedly unlocking in six months. You have to assume that they're actually.
00:26:38.528 - 00:26:39.482, Speaker A: Going to do it on time.
00:26:39.536 - 00:26:43.710, Speaker D: Right? Which is a big assumption given that everything's always delayed.
00:26:44.370 - 00:26:49.486, Speaker A: So six months maybe if they do it, I think we'll get cross step.
00:26:49.508 - 00:26:52.334, Speaker D: Bridge when you come to it if we have some confidence that that is.
00:26:52.372 - 00:26:54.958, Speaker A: Actually going to happen in that time frame.
00:26:55.054 - 00:27:21.898, Speaker C: So it seems like you're very bullish on Ethereum, at least so far. I haven't heard you say anything where you're looking at any kind of risk. Sorry, not that you're not looking at the risk, but you don't seem to see that there's any big risk to Ethereum. It sort of feels like at least at this moment, maybe I just haven't found what it is. But it almost feels like you feel like. It's the leader, and there isn't really anything that will sort of undercut it.
00:27:22.064 - 00:27:28.906, Speaker D: My bullishness is predicated on the supply demand imbalance. There's lots of bad things that are.
00:27:28.928 - 00:27:31.226, Speaker A: Going on that could be bad for.
00:27:31.248 - 00:27:33.934, Speaker D: The price of Ethereum. But for the simple fact is, under.
00:27:33.972 - 00:27:38.894, Speaker A: The current usage, even though it's down, the supply is going to go down.
00:27:38.932 - 00:27:42.814, Speaker D: By 90% of what's emitted. Therefore, if usage continues, even at these.
00:27:42.852 - 00:27:47.154, Speaker A: Levels, the inflation rate drops a lot, therefore the price goes up.
00:27:47.192 - 00:27:53.826, Speaker D: That's as simplistic as I want to frame it. And that's what gives me confidence, because I don't have to care about all.
00:27:53.848 - 00:27:56.530, Speaker A: This other stuff unless I believe that.
00:27:56.600 - 00:28:02.582, Speaker D: Usage of ethereum is going to go down, drop off a cliff, go down 95% at the same time the merge is happening.
00:28:02.716 - 00:28:10.620, Speaker C: And what about for usage that shifts to L2? Do you feel that's additive still to Ethereum's price, or will that take away from it?
00:28:11.070 - 00:28:31.674, Speaker D: I don't know. I'm just looking at the change from T minus one to T plus one, and you tell me that changes 90%. Okay, well, I don't care if it's inflationary deflationary. That's a big change in the structure of the market. Now, obviously all these other things are going to be very pertinent 612, 18.
00:28:31.722 - 00:28:33.182, Speaker A: Months down the line, right?
00:28:33.236 - 00:28:38.062, Speaker D: But from a discrete change today, this is massive.
00:28:38.206 - 00:28:39.538, Speaker A: And it allows me to be a.
00:28:39.544 - 00:28:50.546, Speaker D: Lot more confident in the face of a lot of other negative things, like US. Dollar liquidity. That calls looking more or more like I'm going to be wrong on the short term, on the Fed pivoting, we'll.
00:28:50.578 - 00:28:58.870, Speaker A: See what the liquidity situation looks like. So absent this very unique structural change.
00:28:58.940 - 00:29:12.794, Speaker D: In the supply demand imbalance, I would not be doing any trades in Ethereum over and above, just holding the position that I already hold, because I would think that the liquidity considerations of the dollar is going to overwhelm all of that.
00:29:12.992 - 00:29:21.600, Speaker C: Okay, so we'll talk about that a little bit later. And in fact, I also want to ask you some questions about Bitcoin. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make the show possible.

00:31:39.798 - 00:32:04.850, Speaker C: Back to my conversation with Arthur so as you mentioned, the upcoming merge is being called a triple having and many know make that comparison between how Ethereum will likely go deflationary. Obviously Bitcoin will still be slightly inflationary and I just wondered how you thought this whole narrative around ETH becoming deflationary or the ultrasound money meme is going to affect Bitcoin's narrative of being digital gold.
00:32:06.310 - 00:32:09.030, Speaker A: Well, I think people in my opinion.
00:32:09.370 - 00:32:11.334, Speaker D: Don'T understand what Ethereum actually is.
00:32:11.372 - 00:32:15.766, Speaker A: Ethereum is not money because money has no use. Ethereum has use.
00:32:15.868 - 00:32:33.066, Speaker D: You use it to use to power the applications on this network. Bitcoin has no use, it's just money. Just like the dollar has no use. It's just money. And that's why it's a good form of money because its value cannot be conflated with actual utility of other stuff. And so because Ethereum's goal is to.
00:32:33.088 - 00:32:40.366, Speaker A: Be this decentralized compute for this digital existence, let's say that the deflation gets.
00:32:40.388 - 00:32:42.730, Speaker D: So severe that it becomes so expensive.
00:32:42.890 - 00:32:45.566, Speaker A: That nobody uses it because gas prices.
00:32:45.598 - 00:33:12.074, Speaker D: Are just too high because of the inflation rate. Well, guess what's going to happen? They're going to change the inflation rate because it contradicts the goal of Ethereum being a decentralized computer that people can actually use, the average person can actually use. And I go back to what happened in 2016 with the Dow incident where they had this Dow and the code wasn't properly written or properly written, however.
00:33:12.112 - 00:33:18.730, Speaker A: You want to characterize that. And they did a rollback to protect.
00:33:18.800 - 00:33:33.506, Speaker D: Some of the value of people. Now, that's not money. When you do something like that, that means that your priority is not being some money. Your priority is allowing the average person to use this network and to feel some sense of security and that's completely fine because they didn't advertise Ethereum as.
00:33:33.528 - 00:33:39.106, Speaker A: Being the digital gold of the Internet. That's bitcoin. And so I think people are sort.
00:33:39.128 - 00:33:40.354, Speaker D: Of conflating the two yes.
00:33:40.392 - 00:33:44.430, Speaker A: Right now because of this monetary issuance.
00:33:44.510 - 00:33:51.654, Speaker D: Issue and how it's changing with the merge. If it's inflationary, people using it to buy gas usage and this whole reflective process.
00:33:51.772 - 00:33:55.046, Speaker A: But if that gets too aggressive, if.
00:33:55.068 - 00:34:01.366, Speaker D: The price goes too high, then it actually is detrimental, in my view, to everyday person being able to use Ethereum.
00:34:01.398 - 00:34:03.610, Speaker A: And the applications built on top of it.
00:34:03.760 - 00:34:09.914, Speaker C: Oh, interesting. Wait, just the price of Ethereum and not gas prices. You're literally just talking about the price.
00:34:10.112 - 00:34:11.580, Speaker A: We got to buy it.
00:34:12.670 - 00:34:21.166, Speaker D: You have to spend Ether to use the application like you want to use uniswap. Imagine if the price of Ethereum was a million dollars and you had to.
00:34:21.188 - 00:34:24.174, Speaker A: Spend an obscene amount of money and.
00:34:24.212 - 00:34:28.978, Speaker D: Gas terms even know some fraction of an ETH right, to use an application.
00:34:29.144 - 00:34:30.850, Speaker A: That'S obviously not good.
00:34:31.000 - 00:34:43.206, Speaker D: It's almost like, okay, imagine if you're Saudi Arabia and oil now is $2 million a barrel. Yes, that'd be great to sell all this oil, but nobody can buy it. And so people are going to use.
00:34:43.228 - 00:34:44.422, Speaker A: A different form of energy.
00:34:44.556 - 00:34:49.350, Speaker D: So the cure for high prices is high prices. That's what they say in commodity terms.
00:34:49.420 - 00:34:49.810, Speaker A: Right.
00:34:49.900 - 00:34:55.562, Speaker D: You actually spur innovation away from the source of energy that you're using.
00:34:55.696 - 00:34:59.734, Speaker A: If it gets too expensive for people to use, that's not money. That is a commodity.
00:34:59.782 - 00:35:00.694, Speaker D: Ethereum is a commodity.
00:35:00.742 - 00:35:01.478, Speaker A: It's not money.
00:35:01.584 - 00:35:28.790, Speaker C: Right? Yeah. I think it's slightly different because Ethereum can the decimal points go out like 18 places and the gas is still sort of basically priced in US dollars. But one thing I would just want to ask about that was so essentially what you're saying is that you feel that bitcoin's narrative as digital gold is going to hold even though Ethereum might be more deflationary or at least the scarcity will be decreasing.
00:35:29.450 - 00:35:46.394, Speaker D: Yes, because I think Ethereum is trying to solve a different problem. It's not trying to be money. To the extent that I think the core developers or whatever the political will of Ethereum displayed this very clearly to us in 2016 when they bailed out.
00:35:46.432 - 00:35:49.286, Speaker A: Everybody after the Dow by doing a hard fork, etc.
00:35:49.318 - 00:35:50.266, Speaker D: If you want to say, is the.
00:35:50.288 - 00:35:53.420, Speaker A: Real Ethereum money, right, no one uses it.
00:35:54.610 - 00:36:01.374, Speaker D: And that should tell you all you need to know about whether or not Ethereum wants to be money. And it might not be the inflation rate.
00:36:01.412 - 00:36:04.862, Speaker A: That is what the thing that shows.
00:36:04.916 - 00:36:08.498, Speaker D: Everyone that Ethereum is not money? There may be some other compromise that.
00:36:08.504 - 00:36:10.126, Speaker A: They have to make because the goal.
00:36:10.158 - 00:36:11.694, Speaker D: Of we want to be this decentralized.
00:36:11.742 - 00:36:18.546, Speaker A: Computer for everybody in the world conflicts with immutable money. I don't know what that is, but.
00:36:18.568 - 00:36:23.046, Speaker D: I think we have a one on one sample set of what they did when they were confronted with that sort.
00:36:23.068 - 00:36:25.526, Speaker A: Of choice, they made the choice on.
00:36:25.548 - 00:36:28.954, Speaker D: The side of let's be the power of the decentralized computer.
00:36:29.072 - 00:36:31.290, Speaker A: I believe they continue to have that vision.
00:36:31.630 - 00:36:36.282, Speaker D: And so that's why I don't believe ethereum is digital gold or the money.
00:36:36.336 - 00:36:38.540, Speaker A: Of the cryptos first.
00:36:40.750 - 00:37:06.530, Speaker C: But I was curious for your thoughts even more around bitcoin's narrative, because this idea that bitcoin could be an inflation hedge was a long held theory that some people now say it's sort of improved. Wrong. Obviously, bitcoin actually decreased from its all time high of 69,000 in November down to about 18,000 in June, the same time we had high inflation. So I wondered what your thoughts were on the inflation hedge theory of bitcoin.
00:37:06.870 - 00:37:13.874, Speaker A: I think everything it's a cherry picking of timing, right? So if we take if we compare.
00:37:13.922 - 00:37:18.294, Speaker D: Apples to apples and we say, okay, there's a universe of these risky assets.
00:37:18.342 - 00:37:23.718, Speaker A: That are supposed to protect our money from inflation.
00:37:23.894 - 00:37:30.006, Speaker D: So we go back to bitcoin 2009, right? And we take bitcoin and we deflate.
00:37:30.038 - 00:37:34.238, Speaker A: It by the fed's balance sheet. We take SP 500, we deflate it.
00:37:34.244 - 00:37:39.306, Speaker D: By the fed's balance sheet. We take the nasdaq deflated by the fed's balance sheet. We take gold deflated by the fed's balance sheet.
00:37:39.418 - 00:37:49.602, Speaker A: We take US treasury bonds, whatever. Bitcoin outperforms everything over the time period as when it has existed, deflated by.
00:37:49.656 - 00:37:53.166, Speaker D: The increase of the global reserve currency by its central bank.
00:37:53.198 - 00:37:55.646, Speaker A: That said, bitcoin has beat inflation.
00:37:55.838 - 00:38:00.086, Speaker D: Now, okay, take a particular time period, and that might not be true, but.
00:38:00.108 - 00:38:05.174, Speaker A: Over the history of the asset it has and I guess that just goes.
00:38:05.212 - 00:38:08.040, Speaker D: To if you're trading something like this, timing is everything.
00:38:08.730 - 00:38:18.458, Speaker C: So essentially you feel that, like, on longer time periods, this will become more evident and that really the macro driver was the main cause for that.
00:38:18.544 - 00:38:19.786, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, it's one of them.
00:38:19.808 - 00:38:21.866, Speaker A: But I think that is the thing, right?
00:38:21.888 - 00:38:27.274, Speaker D: If you look at the whole history of bitcoin and you deflate it by the system that it's trying to replace.
00:38:27.402 - 00:38:33.042, Speaker A: The dollar, then it's done. Well, okay, yeah, it overshot its value.
00:38:33.096 - 00:38:34.642, Speaker D: And then came down 75%.
00:38:34.696 - 00:38:36.354, Speaker A: But it's still over.
00:38:36.392 - 00:38:40.558, Speaker D: The entire lifespan of what has existed has outperformed.
00:38:40.734 - 00:38:41.074, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:38:41.112 - 00:39:02.250, Speaker C: So basically you're sort of zooming out. I alluded to this theory a few times here about how the bitcoin price is just a measure of us liquidity. Can you talk a little bit more about that just to unpack that for listeners? We've been referencing it throughout the episode, but I wanted to make sure people heard it. Yeah.
00:39:02.400 - 00:39:03.846, Speaker D: Everything is in phases where you can't.
00:39:03.878 - 00:39:10.266, Speaker A: Say that something is misrepresentation forever. But over the last, let's call it.
00:39:10.288 - 00:39:20.974, Speaker D: 18 months, bitcoin has juked and jived as the liquidity conditions of the dollar have changed. And then I wrote an essay about.
00:39:21.012 - 00:39:24.646, Speaker A: This a few weeks ago, putting up my little index.
00:39:24.698 - 00:39:28.146, Speaker D: And this is literally just like a compilation of stuff I've read in other.
00:39:28.168 - 00:39:45.682, Speaker A: Places, but at the high level, the Fed and different governmental agencies provide the dollars, the base money of the world, for banks to leverage and leverage into the financial economy.
00:39:45.826 - 00:39:47.826, Speaker D: Stocks, bonds and whatnot.
00:39:47.938 - 00:39:53.686, Speaker A: And so the more credit created by banks, the more business activity, right?
00:39:53.708 - 00:40:02.634, Speaker D: Because business kids can borrow money and they can hire people, and we can borrow money in our credit cards and we can get a house and we get a car and all these different things. We can buy all this stuff because.
00:40:02.752 - 00:40:06.734, Speaker A: There'S just all this credit available. And then things get out of hand.
00:40:06.772 - 00:40:09.598, Speaker D: Like, okay, we got to rein it in. And they started raining in the credit.
00:40:09.764 - 00:40:15.038, Speaker A: And because it's leveraged, the downside is just like, whoa, holy shit.
00:40:15.134 - 00:40:24.482, Speaker D: And then you get things crashing and you get three arrows and you get celsius and you get all these different things, which are just a derivative of.
00:40:24.536 - 00:40:40.642, Speaker A: Dollar liquidity dollars for less dollars supplied as credit throughout the world. And these liquidity goes to where it's best catered to, just like water. And as they removed that, then everything that depended on the credit collapsed.
00:40:40.786 - 00:41:12.546, Speaker D: And obviously Bitcoin is just supercharged to that because it's this new system. It's only a decade and a bit old, a bit unproven, and so it's going to oscillate very violently with how that goes conceptually. And I created this index. I put the little Bloomberg thing on my Twitter. I think some people created a trading view, but yeah, that's the overarching theory, and I think it fit quite well with the peaks and bottoms recently, since.
00:41:12.648 - 00:41:20.134, Speaker A: Sort of like early 2021 to today, ish in terms of how bitcoin has.
00:41:20.172 - 00:41:26.454, Speaker D: Responded as dollars became more or less available in the global economy. And I don't think that's going to change anytime soon.
00:41:26.572 - 00:41:34.234, Speaker A: So I think that's the thing that I'm focused on and not the rate of which the Fed does, the Fed funds rate.
00:41:34.272 - 00:41:39.446, Speaker D: Because as I've done more research and talked to more people and learned a bit more about how US money markets.
00:41:39.478 - 00:41:41.658, Speaker A: Work, it's almost like a smokescreen.
00:41:41.754 - 00:41:45.710, Speaker D: This whole quarter point here, 75 basis points there.
00:41:45.860 - 00:41:51.566, Speaker A: It doesn't matter. It's just for show. It all matters. Are there more dollars available to be.
00:41:51.588 - 00:41:54.900, Speaker D: Leveraged by the financial economy or are there not?
00:41:55.350 - 00:41:57.826, Speaker A: And track that and literally, you can.
00:41:57.848 - 00:41:59.374, Speaker D: Forget everything else about economics.
00:41:59.422 - 00:42:03.262, Speaker A: Doesn't matter. You might as well not even look at earnings.
00:42:03.326 - 00:42:03.950, Speaker D: Who cares?
00:42:04.030 - 00:42:06.446, Speaker A: It doesn't matter. That's all that matters.
00:42:06.638 - 00:42:44.850, Speaker C: I find that absolutely incredible. And yeah, I just love how I feel like the whole first half of the episode was me asking all these questions about the merge and you're just like, none of this matters. It's just like this one change. That's the important thing. And so I love how you've simplified this down as well, even for Bitcoin, which is interesting. But one thing I want to ask was, it seems like the crypto world would like to get more institutional money in or just in general, more mainstream people into crypto. But as we've seen, the correlation between bitcoin and the stock market is very high.
00:42:44.850 - 00:42:58.360, Speaker C: So why would either hedge funds or everyday investors, why would they add bitcoin to their portfolio if it seems to act so similarly to Nasdaq? And do you think that these will ever decouple at any point?
00:42:59.290 - 00:43:00.626, Speaker A: I'm sure they will decouple.
00:43:00.658 - 00:43:01.894, Speaker D: There's always changes.
00:43:02.012 - 00:43:03.800, Speaker A: Do I know why? I don't know.
00:43:05.290 - 00:43:08.914, Speaker D: Why do institutional investors want to trade this or large money managers?
00:43:08.962 - 00:43:10.760, Speaker A: Because it goes up a lot.
00:43:11.210 - 00:43:18.778, Speaker D: And so they're all trend followers. So if they see like, some kid who gets bought a Ferrari because he or she put a little bit of.
00:43:18.784 - 00:43:20.074, Speaker A: Money in bitcoin and it went up.
00:43:20.112 - 00:43:22.934, Speaker D: Or some coin or sheba or dogecoin.
00:43:22.982 - 00:43:26.078, Speaker A: Or whatever it is, right, look at.
00:43:26.084 - 00:43:30.206, Speaker D: Me over here, like slaving away trying to make 5% on my portfolio. Maybe I should add a little bit.
00:43:30.228 - 00:43:33.834, Speaker A: Of that, get some of that juice. And they're just trend followers.
00:43:33.882 - 00:43:47.634, Speaker D: That's all they are. And so when we talk about institutional money managers, they're just highly paid FOMO advertisers. They're just aggregators of money. I don't think they are any smarter than anybody else. They're just plugged into a particular way.
00:43:47.672 - 00:43:49.926, Speaker A: Of raising money, and they have their.
00:43:49.948 - 00:43:52.854, Speaker D: Own sort of objectives that they need to hit.
00:43:52.892 - 00:43:54.886, Speaker A: And one of them is if people.
00:43:54.908 - 00:43:57.846, Speaker D: Are doing something and it's going well or has gone well and I'm not.
00:43:57.868 - 00:44:06.762, Speaker A: Doing it, then I'm at risk of my job versus if nobody else is doing it, I'm not going to risk my job if I'm wrong investing in this thing.
00:44:06.816 - 00:44:25.838, Speaker D: And so on the upside, there's career risk of not being technologically innovative and investing in these new things. And on the downside, there's career risk of believing in it and sticking with your guns and staying and nursing these losses. So the institutional investor, or whatever you.
00:44:25.844 - 00:44:29.106, Speaker A: Want to call it, they'll come in at the top, buy at the top.
00:44:29.128 - 00:44:30.850, Speaker D: And then they'll sell at the bottom every single time.
00:44:30.920 - 00:44:36.130, Speaker A: It's just how their incentives are structured as money managers.
00:44:36.650 - 00:44:50.406, Speaker C: This is hilarious. I find it funny because you used to be an investment banker. I don't know if you would put yourself in that category, but you feel like at least for crypto, they're just sort of following.
00:44:50.598 - 00:44:51.098, Speaker A: Absolutely.
00:44:51.184 - 00:44:58.646, Speaker D: Because it's not in their best interest to be early. Because if they're early and they lose.
00:44:58.678 - 00:44:59.770, Speaker A: Money, they lose their job.
00:44:59.920 - 00:45:05.790, Speaker D: If they're late and they lose money or they're coincident, then who cares? Everyone else lost money too.
00:45:05.860 - 00:45:07.120, Speaker A: You can't blame me.
00:45:07.890 - 00:45:14.526, Speaker C: Okay. And are you worried at all about a recession in the US. And how that might affect the price of bitcoin and ether?
00:45:14.718 - 00:45:17.186, Speaker D: No, because the real economy, whether it's.
00:45:17.208 - 00:45:22.958, Speaker A: The Europe, Russia, Africa, whatever, is irrelevant.
00:45:23.054 - 00:45:32.854, Speaker D: To the financial economy, unfortunately, in most respects. Right, because the financial economy cares about the supply of dollars. And that's a political decision made by.
00:45:32.892 - 00:45:35.746, Speaker A: The treasury, the Fed and the elite.
00:45:35.778 - 00:45:40.506, Speaker D: Politicians in the US. Of what the policy is going to be around the amount of credit of.
00:45:40.528 - 00:45:42.826, Speaker A: Dollars expended to the world.
00:45:43.008 - 00:45:49.642, Speaker D: And at a very high level. The politicians in not just America, but.
00:45:49.696 - 00:45:53.034, Speaker A: Most advanced economies don't actually want recessions.
00:45:53.082 - 00:46:00.078, Speaker D: And are perfectly happy to print more money to cover up the structural flaws and how we've arranged things globally in.
00:46:00.084 - 00:46:02.686, Speaker A: The real economy such that the real.
00:46:02.708 - 00:46:10.146, Speaker D: Pain is put off to the next administration. And so there is the, okay, well, things are going bad.
00:46:10.248 - 00:46:12.786, Speaker A: Hand up more money, stimulus, print more.
00:46:12.808 - 00:46:44.762, Speaker D: Money, let's get the stock market to go higher, let me get elected or let me keep my unelected position, whatever, it doesn't really matter. And then when the things are felt 510 years out of that, I'm not involved, I'm not around, but let me just get elected. I think that's the impetus around the world and the easiest thing, and every single time is print money. Governments know how to do one thing very well. They have a very powerful thing called the money printer and they will use it every single time to avoid having to do things that are difficult, like actually sell to the population.
00:46:44.826 - 00:46:47.406, Speaker A: Like why we need to change things.
00:46:47.428 - 00:47:01.102, Speaker D: Like energy policy, or why we made these assumptions about population growth and dependent to working age population. We need to change our assumption. Those are hard decisions, not very popular.
00:47:01.166 - 00:47:03.940, Speaker A: Though, much easier to print the money.
00:47:04.310 - 00:47:24.730, Speaker C: Something I also found fascinating in your writing is that you wrote that you believe central bank tightening up liquidity is the indirect cause of the Terra Luna collapse. We don't have to go into all that. I feel like you kind of have explained this theory, but I was curious whether or not you thought an algorithmic stablecoin would ever work, or if you think that type of stablecoin is forever doomed.
00:47:25.150 - 00:47:26.394, Speaker A: Anything's possible.
00:47:26.592 - 00:47:41.786, Speaker D: The track record has been 100% to the failure rate due to the fact that an algorithmic stablecoin is the same thing as a government fiat money, except the algorithmic stablecoin doesn't have an army with guys with guns who can enforce.
00:47:41.898 - 00:47:43.338, Speaker A: The usage of their currency.
00:47:43.434 - 00:47:46.978, Speaker D: And so that is the problem. How do you get demand for the.
00:47:46.984 - 00:47:50.162, Speaker A: Currency when there is nothing behind it?
00:47:50.296 - 00:48:12.726, Speaker D: Now, obviously, Do Kwan's innovation, if you want to call it that, was let's offer a really high interest rate and then people are going to plow into this thing and that's how we're going to generate that excess demand. And maybe somehow in the future we'll have some intrinsic demand for our currency that will paper over this issue of what happens when the peg breaks.
00:48:12.758 - 00:48:16.874, Speaker A: On the downside, he tried and he failed. And that's just that.
00:48:16.992 - 00:48:33.966, Speaker C: So speaking of kind of all of these recent collapses, you've also written about how three AC collapsed and took down a lot of other players in crypto with it. And I was just wondering, as you watch this whole thing play out, what are your main takeaways for the crypto space? And in particular, I think, for crypto.
00:48:33.998 - 00:48:37.026, Speaker A: Lenders, we're all human, we all make.
00:48:37.048 - 00:48:57.830, Speaker D: The same mistakes, different flavors, the whole credit collapse. I was reading a book by Russell Napier, he was a CLSA research analyst in the late 90s in Hong Kong and he was covering Southeast Asia during the financial crisis.
00:48:58.170 - 00:49:01.242, Speaker A: And it just struck me how the.
00:49:01.296 - 00:49:25.098, Speaker D: Same things that caused this credit collapse of crypto are the same things that caused the Asian financial crisis, are the same things that caused the LDC crisis in the 1980s, are the same things that caused over lending to Argentina over the money time that has defaulted to international lenders. The same things that caused the Russian debt crisis. It's all the same thing at the beginning.
00:49:25.194 - 00:49:31.038, Speaker A: There's value, and credit is allocated to that value, and you make good loans. And then as people see that it's.
00:49:31.054 - 00:49:37.038, Speaker D: Successful, they give you more money and you run out of credible stuff to invest in. But you have to ship the money out the door.
00:49:37.134 - 00:49:39.910, Speaker A: Otherwise you don't get paid as the intermediary.
00:49:41.770 - 00:49:54.906, Speaker D: And it's the same story every single time. And your lending standards get less and less and less and less and less. Same thing happened in Subram, right? Living against houses, it's a decent business. Lending against every single house. People with income that don't match the.
00:49:54.928 - 00:49:57.114, Speaker A: House that they're buying, maybe not so.
00:49:57.152 - 00:50:01.934, Speaker D: Good, but it always started with a good business and then they got to be a bad business because there's just.
00:50:01.972 - 00:50:04.830, Speaker A: Too much money chasing the past amazing.
00:50:04.900 - 00:50:10.894, Speaker D: Returns to the opportunities that are available today. And that's the lesson and we'll never.
00:50:10.932 - 00:50:12.480, Speaker A: Learn it and we'll do it again.
00:50:13.090 - 00:50:21.586, Speaker C: When you say we're going to do it again, you feel at some point in crypto there's going to be like another big blow up down the line, because some people were saying things as.
00:50:21.608 - 00:50:22.818, Speaker A: Credit, because at the end, of the.
00:50:22.824 - 00:50:25.826, Speaker D: Day if I can earn 3% on.
00:50:25.848 - 00:50:29.062, Speaker A: A government bond in domestic fiat currency terms.
00:50:29.116 - 00:50:31.846, Speaker D: But I can earn 20% lending to.
00:50:31.868 - 00:50:35.926, Speaker A: This new fangled technological thing. Could be the railroad, could have been.
00:50:35.948 - 00:50:46.886, Speaker D: The telegraph, could have been radios, these all happened back in late 19th century, early 20th century, could be three arrows in the super cycle, could be crypto.
00:50:46.918 - 00:50:51.174, Speaker A: Lending this like smokescreen over these centralized.
00:50:51.222 - 00:50:57.582, Speaker D: Entities that we're trying to say overall decentralized and blah blah blah, right? It's the same stuff. People want the higher rate of return.
00:50:57.636 - 00:51:01.598, Speaker A: That'S offered in the domestic bonds, especially.
00:51:01.684 - 00:51:05.278, Speaker D: If inflation is higher than these bonds and they're like, okay, I got to do something.
00:51:05.444 - 00:51:06.626, Speaker A: I can't just STIP my money in.
00:51:06.648 - 00:51:25.122, Speaker D: The bank and lose money in real terms. Look at this new technology over here. And we've been conditioned as everyone's like, oh yeah, where's the new technology? The new technology is going to make all the money we got to be in the new technology. So let's lend to the new technology. And at a certain point, the lending.
00:51:25.186 - 00:51:31.238, Speaker A: Standards do not represent what the actual value is. And then we come down and it's.
00:51:31.254 - 00:51:33.690, Speaker D: A cycle, and hopefully the trend line.
00:51:33.760 - 00:51:36.346, Speaker A: Is up and to the right in.
00:51:36.368 - 00:51:38.586, Speaker D: A much slower fashion than you probably would want.
00:51:38.768 - 00:51:41.334, Speaker A: And then we have extreme observations around the trendline.
00:51:41.462 - 00:51:58.866, Speaker C: So pretty much this whole conversation we've really talked about Bitcoin and Ethereum, and I think I've read in your blog post that you kind of really are betting on those. But are there any other either blockchains or other technologies that you find interesting that you are also either betting on.
00:51:58.888 - 00:52:05.282, Speaker A: Or just keeping an eye on on a routine basis? I like not to plug this particular.
00:52:05.336 - 00:52:12.230, Speaker D: Service, but I think they do a good job. Token terminal. I open it up, I go to revenues, and I go to seven days.
00:52:12.380 - 00:52:17.846, Speaker A: I look at which protocols are making the most money, which people are actually.
00:52:17.868 - 00:52:21.482, Speaker D: Using, which people actually spend real money, right?
00:52:21.536 - 00:52:24.554, Speaker A: Maybe it's Bitcoin, ETH, stables, whatever, not.
00:52:24.592 - 00:52:30.794, Speaker D: The actual currency that they've created out of thin air to hand out to people, but who's spending real money to.
00:52:30.832 - 00:52:32.970, Speaker A: Use applications on the network.
00:52:33.390 - 00:52:41.866, Speaker D: And then I go down the list and then I like, okay, do I own any of those? Why or why not? Do I not have a position? Or maybe they're not actually a coin.
00:52:41.898 - 00:52:46.114, Speaker A: It'S just like a service and I can't own a coin in that particular thing.
00:52:46.152 - 00:52:48.020, Speaker D: Or maybe the tokenomics of a particular.
00:52:48.390 - 00:52:54.430, Speaker A: Ecosystem or project aren't to my liking, but whatever I want to earn, yield.
00:52:54.510 - 00:52:56.354, Speaker D: Real yield, based on people using these.
00:52:56.392 - 00:52:58.926, Speaker A: Things, on this ecosystem that I believe in.
00:52:59.048 - 00:53:00.182, Speaker D: Actually, that's kind of where I spend.
00:53:00.236 - 00:53:05.366, Speaker A: Most of my time because I'm not super, super technical. So being able to assess out whether.
00:53:05.388 - 00:53:09.654, Speaker D: Or not some particular new layer, one could be the Ethereum killer or not.
00:53:09.692 - 00:53:15.610, Speaker A: The ethereum killer, this is beyond my abilities. Focus on things I am good at.
00:53:15.680 - 00:53:35.140, Speaker C: And so earlier we did touch on NFTs, and you talked about how you felt they were valuable because they were ways of monetizing culture. What are any particular trends in the NFT space where you're kind of feeling like those are poised to either take off or where you're expecting more growth in the future?
00:53:35.590 - 00:53:37.070, Speaker A: I honestly have no clue.
00:53:37.150 - 00:53:44.162, Speaker D: But that's why I particularly just focus on where the places where people congregate to trade these discrete objects, right?
00:53:44.216 - 00:53:46.114, Speaker A: And so that's all I care about.
00:53:46.152 - 00:53:51.830, Speaker D: Because at the end of the day, I don't know. I can't predict where human culture is going to go or whether or not.
00:53:51.900 - 00:53:53.990, Speaker A: Some famous artist is going to take.
00:53:54.140 - 00:54:02.300, Speaker D: This protocol or that protocol, or how you can issue concert tickets in NFT or loyalty programs or all this kind of stuff, right?
00:54:02.830 - 00:54:03.900, Speaker A: I don't know.
00:54:04.910 - 00:54:14.862, Speaker D: I can't really handicap that. It's not really my area of expertise. But is there a central point where a lot of people go to actually trade these assets and purchase them and experience them? Okay, I want to know where that is.
00:54:14.916 - 00:54:20.266, Speaker A: I want to know where can I get in on that game? Because then I don't have to predict.
00:54:20.378 - 00:54:26.740, Speaker D: What the new thing is. Or is Yuga Labs going to come out with a new project that's going to be hot?
00:54:27.190 - 00:54:29.986, Speaker A: I don't know. I'll buy one of them if it's cool.
00:54:30.088 - 00:54:36.274, Speaker D: But being able to make a real concerted business on that and a big.
00:54:36.312 - 00:54:39.410, Speaker A: Bet not really my forte.
00:54:39.930 - 00:55:14.030, Speaker C: That's fascinating because I don't know, I don't know you super well, but I would have imagined you'd be someone who would be good at predicting that kind of thing. But anyway, so I wanted to ask you about your writing process. I'm a writer and I'm a fan of your writing, and I always find it really impressive when people who are not professional writers are great writers and you fit that category. You're an investment banker, turn, crypto entrepreneur, and I and many other people in the crypto space just love your blog posts. So I was just wondering for a bit of personal history, how did you become such a good writer?
00:55:14.370 - 00:55:16.302, Speaker A: I mean, I don't really like writing.
00:55:16.366 - 00:55:27.730, Speaker D: That much, but I had some very good English teachers in high school. And there's one guy I remember deceased now. We had a class on British literature.
00:55:27.810 - 00:55:30.674, Speaker A: And I think we were studying Shakespeare.
00:55:30.722 - 00:55:39.942, Speaker D: Or whatever it was, and he was famous in the school for having spot tests. So we literally get in the class.
00:55:39.996 - 00:55:43.946, Speaker A: We were supposed to read a particular set of pages in a play, and.
00:55:43.968 - 00:55:45.078, Speaker D: Then he would print out a section.
00:55:45.094 - 00:55:49.546, Speaker A: Of that play, and then he would remove certain words from it.
00:55:49.568 - 00:56:00.190, Speaker D: And you had to supply the word from the dialogue. And then you'd have to give definitions of particular turns of phrases or whatnot.
00:56:00.770 - 00:56:06.898, Speaker A: From a piece of Shakespearean literature. And so got very pedantic in particular.
00:56:06.984 - 00:56:15.374, Speaker D: About certain things, took British literature through him. In high school, we had to write a 3000 word essay on a poem.
00:56:15.422 - 00:56:17.442, Speaker A: I forgot which poem I wrote it on.
00:56:17.576 - 00:56:24.994, Speaker D: I took a Russian literature class from here. I had to write a paper on the art of Leo Tolstoy, which actually got an A on, so I was quite surprised.
00:56:25.122 - 00:56:27.446, Speaker A: So yeah, I think I had good.
00:56:27.468 - 00:56:29.418, Speaker D: Training in high school, and then I just like to read a lot of.
00:56:29.424 - 00:56:31.626, Speaker A: Stuff, and so I copy what other.
00:56:31.648 - 00:56:45.270, Speaker D: People who are better than me at it, their style, turns of phrases, different concepts, I guess. Try to read Riley fiction, nonfiction, I love Sci-Fi, all sorts of different things, a lot of history.
00:56:45.440 - 00:56:46.558, Speaker A: And then at the end of the.
00:56:46.564 - 00:56:47.166, Speaker D: Day, I'm trying to.
00:56:47.188 - 00:56:48.894, Speaker A: Write something that I have an idea.
00:56:48.932 - 00:56:52.798, Speaker D: Of an investment concept or a thesis, I have a position on it in.
00:56:52.804 - 00:56:55.406, Speaker A: My portfolio and I also I'm having.
00:56:55.428 - 00:57:01.010, Speaker D: A conversation with myself through the writing and I'm trying to justify to myself why do I have this position on?
00:57:01.160 - 00:57:02.786, Speaker A: And a lot of times as I.
00:57:02.808 - 00:57:04.162, Speaker D: Start writing something, I had an idea.
00:57:04.216 - 00:57:12.946, Speaker A: Of something I wanted to write and I'm like, this sounds like this argument is weak. And I sell the whole position, I get out of it because I can't.
00:57:12.978 - 00:57:19.922, Speaker D: Even explain it to myself, much less offer it out to thousands of readers of why I'm in this particular trade.
00:57:19.986 - 00:57:21.430, Speaker A: And therefore I need to be out of it.
00:57:21.500 - 00:57:22.634, Speaker D: And so I think it's a very.
00:57:22.672 - 00:57:26.106, Speaker A: Cathartic process of writing and because I.
00:57:26.128 - 00:57:27.238, Speaker D: Use it as sort of a litmus.
00:57:27.254 - 00:57:33.418, Speaker A: Test for my own ideas because I'm trying to make money on them, maybe that's why the quality is good.
00:57:33.504 - 00:57:40.554, Speaker C: I just love what you said there. But I was curious wait, did you say that you previously didn't like writing or that you currently still don't like writing?
00:57:40.682 - 00:57:46.420, Speaker A: No, as a kid I wasn't really into English class.
00:57:47.030 - 00:57:51.186, Speaker C: Okay. Yeah, because now it seems like you take great pleasure in it.
00:57:51.368 - 00:57:52.866, Speaker D: It's fun, I like it.
00:57:52.968 - 00:58:35.306, Speaker C: Yeah, from the humor and all that. Actually, something that you just said reminds me of something that I did want to ask you about. It wasn't in my script, but I think this is a perfect time to ask it. You at the beginning talked about how crypto is quite religious and bitcoin maximalism recently has been kind of undergoing a change. There are prominent people who either previously were known to be bitcoin maximalists or at least just considered themselves bitcoiners, if not maximalists, who now have publicly kind of renounced maximalism. And it almost feels like there's like a narrative changing around that. And I wondered what your take was on that.
00:58:35.306 - 00:58:50.326, Speaker C: Some of these people are saying that a lot of the bitcoin maximalists now their arguments aren't sound, that they're sort of chanting these different mantras or whatever and it's just sort of a religious thing, but there's no evidence to back it up. And I was curious for your thoughts on what's been going down with all.
00:58:50.348 - 00:58:57.462, Speaker D: That not really follow the consternation of emotion around like oh, is he a maxi or not?
00:58:57.516 - 00:59:00.102, Speaker A: Or to me it doesn't really matter.
00:59:00.156 - 00:59:03.686, Speaker D: But the fact that there's people who believe strongly about something and believe strongly.
00:59:03.718 - 00:59:09.466, Speaker A: About the opposing opinion to me is evidence of the thing that we're doing right.
00:59:09.488 - 00:59:11.590, Speaker D: It's money, it's all fake, it doesn't exist.
00:59:11.750 - 00:59:13.806, Speaker A: It's this thing that we're trying to.
00:59:13.828 - 00:59:18.846, Speaker D: Connect the future of human productivity today. I'm trying to give you this thing.
00:59:18.868 - 00:59:21.006, Speaker A: That I call a bitcoin that has.
00:59:21.028 - 00:59:29.234, Speaker D: Some value and I want you to do some work for me or give me a real asset or give me a slice of bread or whatever right? And same thing with a dollar, any of this other stuff.
00:59:29.272 - 00:59:31.438, Speaker A: And so it doesn't exist.
00:59:31.534 - 01:00:00.842, Speaker D: It's completely made up. It's complete myth and fiction. And that's why I think it lends itself to religion. It lends itself to people being super about it and then they change their mind and they become the prodigal sons and daughters and maybe they'll come back into the fold later. And so it does feel extremely religious. And you change. You have the reformation, right? You have the enlightenment, you have this change of energy around the different religions, and then you have the orthodoxy who never changes, and then these schisms, and it's just the same thing.
01:00:00.896 - 01:00:01.980, Speaker A: It's all the same.
01:00:02.430 - 01:00:10.382, Speaker C: And so you don't feel that any parts of the crypto world are more religious than others, meaning more faith based rather than evidence based?
01:00:10.516 - 01:00:14.734, Speaker D: It depends on what you're trying to the ecosystem that you're involved in. Bitcoin is pure money.
01:00:14.772 - 01:00:19.442, Speaker A: There is no utility as of yet other than being money. Right. That's what it is.
01:00:19.576 - 01:00:24.994, Speaker D: And so, of course, you're going to have to be very religious about things because you don't have any other real.
01:00:25.032 - 01:00:26.258, Speaker A: Thing to back it up.
01:00:26.264 - 01:00:36.006, Speaker D: It's not like Ethereum, where, okay, there are these applications that are being used. We're lending, we're trading, we're all on this network. We have this value here because, hey.
01:00:36.028 - 01:00:47.866, Speaker A: We'Ve got this network, we have this immutable chain of data, therefore it's valuable and that's it. Right? And so I think depending on what.
01:00:47.888 - 01:00:51.226, Speaker D: You'Re actually involved in, will determine how.
01:00:51.248 - 01:00:53.294, Speaker A: Much religion, if you want to call.
01:00:53.332 - 01:01:00.586, Speaker D: It, that has to be imbued to give it that value. And the more you tend towards a thing that's monetary in nature and pure.
01:01:00.618 - 01:01:02.426, Speaker A: Money, it's pure fiction.
01:01:02.538 - 01:01:08.946, Speaker D: It's purely a construct of humanity and the way we want to organize ourselves socially and we have these units of.
01:01:08.968 - 01:01:15.266, Speaker A: Account that we use to confer value amongst ourselves. And that's going to be very religious. Yeah.
01:01:15.288 - 01:01:33.834, Speaker C: And I wanted to ask about when you keep saying bitcoin is money, people typically say that that will have sort of like three features, like store a value unit of account just used for exchange. So I was curious where you see bitcoin fitting that or not quite fitting that yet.
01:01:33.952 - 01:01:38.666, Speaker D: Depends on what you're using it for. Right? Some people are like, oh, bitcoin is not useful because I can't go pay.
01:01:38.688 - 01:01:46.590, Speaker A: For a cup of coffee. Okay, can you pay for a cup of coffee with a bar of gold? Probably not.
01:01:46.660 - 01:01:52.606, Speaker D: But if somebody gave you a bar of gold, would you consider it valuable? Yeah, I would. Why? Because everyone else said it's valuable. Right.
01:01:52.628 - 01:01:53.870, Speaker A: It's the same argument.
01:01:54.850 - 01:02:03.474, Speaker D: So it's like, oh, yeah, the dollar is going to explode today because of all this rampant inflation, but you need to pay your taxes and dollars if you're American, right?
01:02:03.512 - 01:02:03.906, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:02:04.008 - 01:02:07.310, Speaker D: So it's useful. Yeah. Right? Yeah. Okay. It's useful. Right. That's all context.
01:02:07.390 - 01:02:10.178, Speaker A: So I think people again, it's like religion.
01:02:10.194 - 01:02:19.180, Speaker D: You take a context, you extrapolate it to the maximum, and then you look silly. And I think that's what people do with bitcoin and every other form of monetary value.
01:02:20.270 - 01:03:01.206, Speaker C: I love it. I just feel like throughout this episode, you've always just gone for the simplest explanation, which I think is what makes you a very clear writer as well and why people like your writing. Because I always say, as a professional writer, I do have to say people generally don't value writing. So many times writers will try to get a gig and they'll be told things like, oh, we'll pay you for exposure, or, we won't pay you, but you'll get exposure, or whatever. What I take away has been that people think that typing is writing. And I am always trying to tell people, no, writing is actually clear thinking. That's what writing actually is.
01:03:01.206 - 01:03:13.420, Speaker C: And if you can find somebody who's a very clear thinker, that's extremely valuable. So I just love how you've done that through this episode. And I think that explains also why it is that people just love what you write.
01:03:14.030 - 01:03:15.178, Speaker D: I think it's also a thing of.
01:03:15.184 - 01:03:23.626, Speaker A: Like, people people don't recognize the power of ideas, right? If you think about the total wars.
01:03:23.658 - 01:03:38.894, Speaker D: That we fought over the 20th century, this Marxism, right? Look at the impact Karl Marx has had on world history or Keynes Keynesian economics and all this crap that we learned in school. It's all these ideas of these dead.
01:03:38.942 - 01:03:42.946, Speaker A: People who wrote these essays, and people latched onto them.
01:03:42.968 - 01:03:47.474, Speaker D: And these ideas are still around with us today in religions, ideas of humans.
01:03:47.602 - 01:03:52.806, Speaker A: On different things that wrote some books, and billions of us, believe it or.
01:03:52.828 - 01:03:59.938, Speaker D: Not, believe it, and we'll kill each other for it. And so I think at scale, our writing is extremely powerful.
01:04:00.034 - 01:04:02.246, Speaker A: But the unfortunate part is, just like.
01:04:02.268 - 01:04:04.342, Speaker D: Crypto, 99% of our writing is trash.
01:04:04.406 - 01:04:06.874, Speaker A: And so you just assume that everything.
01:04:06.912 - 01:04:08.586, Speaker D: Is trash and you pay accordingly, which.
01:04:08.608 - 01:04:11.200, Speaker A: Is good or a bad thing.
01:04:12.770 - 01:04:32.562, Speaker C: Wow. I love it. Now, you've also explained my experience over my writing career. All right, Arthur, it has been such a delight to have you on the show.
