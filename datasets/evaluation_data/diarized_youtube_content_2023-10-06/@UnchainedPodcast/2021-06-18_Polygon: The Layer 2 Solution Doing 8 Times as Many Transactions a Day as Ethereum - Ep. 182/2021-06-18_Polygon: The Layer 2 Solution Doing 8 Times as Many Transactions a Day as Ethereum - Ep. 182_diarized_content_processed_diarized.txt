00:01:11.758 - 00:01:15.090, Speaker B: Welcome, Jane T. Thank you Laura, for having me.
00:01:15.240 - 00:01:31.020, Speaker A: Polygon has had quite a few months, especially considering that the overall market has kind of been in a bit of the doldrums. So can you tell me from your perspective the story of how Polygon has taken off these last few months?
00:01:31.950 - 00:02:02.514, Speaker B: Definitely. So we have been working on Polygon since 2017 and launched our main net in last year May. And since then we are working with Taps to onboard them on Polygon. And we had like 100, 200 Tap applications at the time before three months ago. And then the NFT boom came, right? And D Five was there. D five. Boom was there.
00:02:02.514 - 00:03:24.110, Speaker B: And everyone was trying to send a transactions on Ethereum. Right? And at the time Ethereum gas fees went like 100K or something, right? And people were spending a lot of USD, a lot of ETH on Ethereum as a gas fees. And at the same time Ave deployed on Polygon and we created a pool incentives pool for the Ave liquidity and it brought a huge liquidity to the Polygon. At the same time the sushi schwab curve and multiple other DeFi came and started doing the same and it kind of blew the whole DFI boom on Polygon from Ethereum and it just got crazy and crazy. Currently we have like 500 plus applications, DFI, NFTs, every kind of different applications and in the latest few days ago it crashed happen. Right? And the matic was only the token who was sustaining its value. We were seeing no huge investor interest in Polygon institution, investors, retailers.
00:03:24.110 - 00:04:01.210, Speaker B: And what we did is kind of creating the path for layer two. If you see layer two ecosystem, there was no other layer two solutions ready for the production as we are. And that's what happened in the last few days and I would say weeks that Polygon paved the path for the layer two. And so that on ethereum you can scale right away. You don't have to wait for any other applications. You can just go and deploy your applications on polygon and you can scale right now. And that, I think, was a major part of the success of polygon.
00:04:02.030 - 00:04:15.710, Speaker A: So as I'm sure most of our listeners are aware, there are multiple ways to scale and a lot of layer two scaling solutions on ethereum are taking one specific approach. How has polygon decided to scale?
00:04:16.690 - 00:05:10.430, Speaker B: Yeah, so we started with plasma. So in late 2017, I was doing research on scalability and plasma specifically. And then we started with a plasma. But in plasma, we didn't want to do UTXO based plasma. So what we did is account based plasma, which is similar to ethereum, right? And for that we took the EVM approach, right? What we thought like, let's take the EVM and change it to make the plasma compatible. And by doing that, what happens is that any developer can just move their applications from ethereum chain to plasma polygon chain in few minutes. But in plasma currently we are supporting only transfers, not any arbitrary state changes.
00:05:10.430 - 00:06:02.186, Speaker B: And if you want to support any arbitrary state transfer state changes, you need to create the predicates contract on the ethereum chain. So we thought it's very hard for developers to create each kind of specific predicates for the use cases. So what we did is created proof of Stake Bridge from ethereum chain to polygon chain. And polygon chain is before the Proof of Stake bridge. It has 100 validators, right? Polygon chain has 100 validators. It runs in kind of simple parallel EVM mean but faster to ethereum. And with polygon, with proof of Stack Bridge, you can have any kind of state changes on the polygon.
00:06:02.186 - 00:06:56.526, Speaker B: It's just the same as the EVM chain. Right? So let's say if you have a bunch of contracts on the ethereum and if you want to migrate to polygon, you can just take those bunch of contracts away, contracts and deploy on the polygon and that's it, you are done. You don't have to change anything at all. You can move your tokens, you can move your state changes, any kind of arbitrary state data, right? You can move that from ethereum chain to polygon chain using the bridge generalized bridge. And you can also move back using the checkpoint mechanism. So checkpoint is nothing but a hash of blocks of the polygon. And we do that, we push those checkpoints on the ethereum chain so you can prove that your transaction is there on the polygon in this block, at this index.
00:06:56.526 - 00:07:31.390, Speaker B: You can do that. And with that you can prove any kind of receipt, any kind of logs and exit those. You can prove that state data and retrieve those data on the ethereum chain. And that's how the withdrawal works. Right? So the whole thing is kind of no, we started with plasma. We added the proof of Stake bridge, a simple bridge. Now what we are trying to do is having expanding our ecosystem and with that we are also going to support roll ups, zika roll ups and multiple app specific chains.
00:07:31.390 - 00:08:10.566, Speaker B: The approach is that we don't not going to just take the simple roll up approach. We want to focus on the usability for the DAP developers. Right. And with that we think that pushing all the data on the Ethereum chain for the roll ups is not sustainable at all. And that's why we are also creating our data ability chain in house. And the data ability chain basically helps tap developers to reduce the cost for the roll up. So let's say if you want to use the roll up arbitram roll up with a Polygon DLA, you can do that.
00:08:10.566 - 00:08:31.600, Speaker B: So it's kind of no mix and match approach. We are taking a more kind of generalized approach where tap developers can use the whole layer to very securely. Plus they don't have to worry about the cost of pushing the data on the Ethereum chain. So that's what we are going to do in the next few months.
00:08:32.450 - 00:08:49.640, Speaker A: Wow. Yeah. Just listening to that, it's very easy to understand how so much activity has shifted very quickly and why. And I was curious, how are you seeing users on Polygon differing from those who have stayed on Ethereum? If there is any difference.
00:08:51.370 - 00:09:15.586, Speaker B: User face is similar, 100% similar. It's just kind of no, you had to add the URL on the MetaMask if you want to use MetaMask. But if you are using the wallet link or on the kind of mobile wallet, wallet connect, you don't have to worry about it all. It just works seamlessly as you are working on the Ethereum, but faster and your cost is pretty cheap.
00:09:15.718 - 00:09:57.690, Speaker A: Okay. I do think I did see that there was some data showing that some of the users on Polygon or that a greater number of them were transacting in smaller amounts and that whales were sticking around on Ethereum. But then I did also see more news saying that whales also seem to be moving over. And what types of projects do you see typically taking off on Polygon? I just noticed it seems like there's quite a lot of gaming and NFT apps on Polygon and obviously DeFi is also popular. But I was surprised about the number of gaming and NFT apps.
00:09:58.590 - 00:10:25.170, Speaker B: Yeah, as I say, we have 500 plus applications right now and most of them are like D five NFDS in NFDS. I think my popular is one is Zedron. Right. So Zedron is quite popular at the time and people were using the buying the horses and they're putting the horses into races and win the race.
00:10:27.050 - 00:10:36.194, Speaker A: Yeah, just for people who don't know. You said it. But it's where people can bet on these digital horses.
00:10:36.242 - 00:11:16.420, Speaker B: Yeah, digital horses. And in the DFI side we have Aave right away is biggest D five right now on the Polygon, and it has 7 billion plus USD worth of tokens locked in our market on Polygon. With that, we have Quick swap, Sushi swap. Both have 1 million plus liquidity. We have curve. And multiple other DeFi is also coming deploying as we speak on the Polygon. So I think we pretty much covered the all or popular Ethereum applications as we speak.
00:11:17.830 - 00:12:07.142, Speaker A: All right, so in a moment, we'll discuss what's next for Polygon. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible.

So one thing that a lot of DeFi protocols were discussing kind of, I don't know, maybe a year or several months ago was about the Composability issue in DFI and how going to layer two could break that. And some different projects have just gone with one layer two solution or another.
00:12:56.742 - 00:13:02.600, Speaker A: And I wondered, do you feel that Polygon addresses that issue, and if so, how?
00:13:03.450 - 00:13:43.730, Speaker B: I think Composability was an issue when people were talking about app specific roll ups or app specific side chain or chain. Right? Simple chain. Like cosmos cosmo has launched IPC, but still, it's not that popular as we see or we predict in Composability. Of course. DeFi needs composability. Right? If you think about the Curve protocol, simple as Curve, it needs multiple DeFi protocols to work. Aave needs, let's say chain link oracle.
00:13:43.730 - 00:14:22.634, Speaker B: Other DeFi application needs other DeFi applications to work on. Right. So in general, of course, DeFi needs Composability. And if you break down the applications into the multiple chains, it also brings a problem of liquidity fragmentation. Right? So those two problems go hand in hand, like Composability and Liquidity. But what we are trying to see on the specific to Polygon proposed check chain, we have a one chain, right? We don't have an application specific chain. So you just deploy as you deploying on Ethereum.
00:14:22.634 - 00:15:21.550, Speaker B: It's like you can say, okay, hey, this is the sister chain of Ethereum. Right? Polygon is sister chain of ethereum you can deploy, you can use the liquidity the same way you do on ethereum in the roll up. And secondhand, currently arbitrary and optimism are there, they are coming and there will be the same as a proof of stake chains. There will be multiple applications in the same chain so there won't be any composability issue. But I will see some liquidity fragmentation between the polygon chain and the arbitrage chain and the optimism chain. If you deploy different kind of applications, same applications on the different platforms, that's exactly what we are experiencing right now. What happens is, let's say if you have liquidity on the binance chain and if people want to move the liquidity from binance chain to polygon chain, it's very tricky.
00:15:21.550 - 00:16:19.670, Speaker B: Right? And I feel that it will be same problem when we have multiple roll ups, multiple chains in the future. Even the composability, composability is kind of the liquidity is part of the composability, I assume, because it's just same thing, part of the composability. So what we are trying to solve in the polygon is to how to do the state call between the chain at the protocol level. When I say protocol level, it means that similar to IPC, IPC kind of works underneath of Cosmos SDK or tendermint level. You don't need application level changes to do the transfer or composability. To achieve the composability you need to make it at a protocol level. That way you don't break the composability, you don't break the liquidity as well.
00:16:19.670 - 00:17:03.060, Speaker B: You can always move your liquidity from here to there very easily without creating the synthetics on the different chains. But I think it's very tricky in general because you have to change or maybe fork your chain or it's very hard to change because if you are, let's say application level transfer, state transfer or token transfer, it's very easy. But if you go on the protocol level, on the lower level, it's hard to change and I think it can be tricky to implement. But I think we have to do that. Otherwise it will be a problem when we have a roll ups and multiple roll ups and multiple chains. I'm hoping I make sense.
00:17:03.910 - 00:17:36.730, Speaker A: Well, yeah, I think we're going to have to see how this all plays out. I mean, I think it is a tricky issue and kind of a big vision that you have there. So speaking of Polygon has gotten a lot of investment recently in and around it. Au 21 announced a $21 million ecosystem fund. Billionaire Mark Cuban announced that he had invested, although he didn't disclose the amount. And UN Zero X announced you two together will send $10.5 million to bring more users to Polygon.
00:17:36.730 - 00:17:42.670, Speaker A: So what do you plan to do with this money and what are your strategies for bringing more users to Polygon?
00:17:43.090 - 00:18:50.506, Speaker B: Yeah, we have a different agenda for different kind of funds. So for Zero X and for Zero X dow fund we are specifically looking to bring more applications on the exchange side and the DeFi side. And with DeFi we are hoping to spend those money on the supporting multiple startups, multiple crypto projects which are just starting out and bring them on Polygon with Au 21 Capital It's general fund for the specific focused on the Polygon, right. And with that I think they are planning to deploy those funds in multiple projects on Polygon. It can be DeFi, it can be NFTs, it can be any other projects. We also just announced Polygon SDK so we are also focusing crypto projects who are using the Polygon SDK and building their own crypto projects. So we're also going to fund the projects using those funds.
00:18:50.506 - 00:20:01.994, Speaker B: And on the Mark Cuban side, of course, it's a strategic investment from him because he was very much a user of Polygon. He was using multiple applications so it was great to be on board and he is good at technology, right. So we were talking to Mark Cuban and he was very keen like understanding the roll ups and secure ups and everything so we were surprised to see his ideas around the tech. So I think having him on board is a good addition to Polygon ecosystem in. And with that we have multiple other fund also coming up focused on Polygon. And with that what happened, we want to expand our Polygon ecosystem with roll of CK, roll up Polygon SDK, current proof of shake chain and we want to bring more applications who reach to non crypto users. Currently we have a people users who are using Polygon.
00:20:01.994 - 00:20:25.300, Speaker B: But what we are going to do is we're going to launch NFT focused fund as well in the near future. With that we are going to target the specific two games like web two games. So those kind of different agenda we have with the funds, specific funds and just see how it pans out in the future.
00:20:26.170 - 00:20:48.650, Speaker A: And just for listeners who may not know, SDK stands for Software Developer Kit, right, to get more people building on Polygon. So what is the future for Polygon? Once Ethereum 2.0 shifts because obviously that will scale Ethereum at the base layer. So at that point, what would that mean for Polygon?
00:20:48.990 - 00:21:41.102, Speaker B: Yeah, what I'm thinking is that let's say even if Ethereum scale system won't reach like in millions of transactions per minutes or per second or per day, I would say it will have obviously increased some capacity of the current chain. But I think it will also allow our users, layer two users to withdraw more space for the withdrawal and deposits. Right. Also what I think is that for example, let's say for example, two years back Ethereum was making let's say thousands of transactions per day. Currently it's making 1.5 million transactions per day and Polygon is making 7 million transactions per day. If you see finance chain it was making like 12 million transactions per day before it got problem.
00:21:41.102 - 00:22:30.990, Speaker B: Right? What I am seeing is that if in the future, let's say if crypto market expands, it will need more transactions per day. You need bigger and bigger, more and more scalability. So even if Ethereum 2.0 will come, I'm 100% sure it will get jammed in few days or few weeks for sure. It's like you Uber, right? When Uber came, you were taking the Uber and you got the Uber in a few seconds. Right now I know, like in Bangalore, in India, if you ask for Uber or Ola, it won't come because it's so much demand there because people traveled a lot more because of the pandemic. It got down, but the supply came also.
00:22:30.990 - 00:22:46.660, Speaker B: Demand also increased higher than the supply. So it's the same situation will be in the future. I'm 100% sure we'll be helping Ethereum 2.0 scale as well in the future.
00:22:47.990 - 00:23:07.666, Speaker A: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense and is also kind of funny, frankly. Anyway, well, it has been such a pleasure talking with you. Thank you so much for illuminating us on this hot new layer two of Ethereum and yeah, thanks so much for coming on Unconfirmed.
00:23:07.698 - 00:23:08.342, Speaker B: Thank you.

First headline taproot, the biggest upgrade to bitcoin in four years is locked in as lightning doubles.
00:24:04.038 - 00:25:27.086, Speaker A: Last Friday Bitcoin's Taproot upgrade, the most significant protocol improvement in years, officially locked in after passing the speedy trial parameters, which required 90% of the blocks mined in a two week window to signal support for the upgrade. The full implementation of Taproot, however, is still a ways off, as the next step in the activation process is a five month waiting period. This dead period is designed to give miners and nodes the opportunity to upgrade their software to contain the logic for the Taproot soft fork when bitcoin reaches block number 7000. When bitcoin reaches block number 709,632, which is estimated to happen in November, taproot will activate, allowing nodes to begin recognizing transactions made using Taproot. The integration of Taproot will be the first major upgrade to bitcoin's code since 2000 and seventeen's segregated witness taproot hopes to improve bitcoin's privacy, multisick wallets security and scaling. On a related note, bitcoin's lightning network has continued to grow since April, when it hit 10,000 operating nodes for the first time, nearly doubling within a year, though May and June were slow for the markets, according to Bitcoin visuals and oneml over the past 30 days, Bitcoin's layer two solution has seen growth in three major statistics. Number one, number of nodes grew by 5.25%
00:25:27.086 - 00:26:09.918, Speaker A: two, number of channels increased by 9.2% and three, network capacity jumped by 15%. Zoom out even further and the growth becomes even more substantial. As of June 11, 2020, there were only 5916 nodes with channels, and the cumulative network capacity, which is the amount of BTC locked into Lightning channels, sat at 936 bitcoin, according to Coinsquare's Kevin Rook part of the excitement around Lightning network could stem from El Salvador. On Twitter, he pointed out that two of the most popular finance apps in El Salvador are Lightning enabled. Bitcoin wallets. He tweeted it's lightning season.
00:26:09.918 - 00:26:58.050, Speaker A: Lightning network capacity just broke 1500. BTC networks knows channels and capacity are at all time highs. Next Headline The crypto market may be down, but private investments continue flowing. In this week, three crypto companies alone announced over $350,000,000 in funding. The largest raise totaled $230,000,000, with Peter Thiel leading a high profile group of investors to back. Bitdao, a decentralized autonomous organization designed to invest in DFI projects bybit an Asian cryptocurrency exchange, also got in on the project, pledging future shares that could amount to $1 billion a year. Bitdao token holders will be able to vote on which projects to invest in, and the Dow aims to employ hundreds of people in its R and D centers, according to the block.
00:26:58.050 - 00:28:04.002, Speaker A: Bitwise also announced a significant raise, closing a Series B of $70 million led by Henry Kravis, the founder of private equity firm KKR, billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller, and Bridgewater CEO David McCormick, among others. According to CNBC, Bitwise recently became profitable after four years of business when it hit $1.2 billion in assets under management at the end of the first quarter, rounding out a big week in funding. dYdX, a decentralized derivatives exchange secured $65 million in a Series C, led by Paradigm after its January raise of $10 million with a new influx of cash. Antonio Giuliano, the founder of dYdX and also a previous guest on Unchained, expressed interest in decentralizing the protocol, telling the block quote, Our goal really is to get to a point where we're only publishing open source code and all of dYdX's run natively on the blockchain. Next Headline MicroStrategy's macro strategy is pretty simple bitcoin Monday was a busy day for MicroStrategy. The software company turned corporate hodler.
00:28:04.002 - 00:28:44.514, Speaker A: Early that morning, MicroStrategy announced the completion of its 500 million dollar offering of secured notes, bringing in a total of $488,000,000 after fees to purchase more Bitcoin. According to reports, the company received more than $1.5 billion worth of notes for the first time more than tripling the original offering of $400 million. Hours after completing the debt offering, MicroStrategy also unveiled a plan to sell $1 billion worth of its stock, with the proceeds being used for, quote, general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of More bitcoin. The software firm currently holds 92,000 bitcoin on its balance sheet, worth roughly $3.7 billion. With the addition of $1.5
00:28:44.514 - 00:29:46.002, Speaker A: billion in potential capital available, MicroStrategy could afford over 35,000 bitcoin. Next Headline Crypto's first large scale bank run according to data from Coin, Gecko Iron, titanium, token, or Titan, crashed from $60 to just a sliver above $0 in less than 24 hours on Wednesday. Titan is linked to the Iron Finance project, which mints Socalled stablecoins by locking in a combination of 25% Titan and 75% USTC. CoinDesk reported that, quote when new iron stablecoins are minted, the demand for Titan increases, driving up its price. Conversely, when the price of Titan falls dramatically, as was the case on Wednesday evening, the peg becomes unstable. In a postmortem blog post, Iron Finance described the event as, quote, the world's first large scale crypto bank run. As Titan began free falling from $60, so did the pegged value of iron, falling to under $0.70.
00:29:46.002 - 00:30:26.130, Speaker A: As a bank run was initiated on Titan, creating, as Fred Shabasta, founder of Finder.com Au and an Iron Finance investor, told CoinDesk, quote, a crypto vortex of money. Iron Finance explained this vortex as a, quote, negative feedback loop and the worst thing that could happen to the protocol, where panic selling led to more Titan creation, which drove Titan prices down, which caused more panic. For context, at one point, Iron Finance had $2 billion in value locked into the network. That number has dropped to $238,000,000 as of press time. Titan and Iron finance were available on polygon and finance. Smart chain.
00:30:26.130 - 00:31:14.194, Speaker A: Mark Cuban, billionaire investor and avid DFI user, recently admitted to being a liquidity provider on Quickswap, an automated market maker native to Polygon for the Dai Titan trading pair. In a blog post on DeFi, which I recommended in the daily newsletter earlier this week, in a response to a tweet referencing the Titan crash as, quote, a rug pull, Cuban replied that he, quote, got hit like everyone else. Later on, in an email to Bloomberg, he called for regulation in the industry, quote, to define what a stablecoin is and what collateralization is acceptable. Preston Byrne, partner at Anderson Kill tweeted back at him. Mark Cuban this stuff is already regulated. That Coin is more likely than not an unregistered security. You should have known it and you bought it anyway.
00:31:14.194 - 00:31:43.850, Speaker A: Don't call for regulation just because your crypto investment team doesn't know what they're doing. This one is on you. Speaking of regulation, next we have A-U-S. Regulatory roundup. On Tuesday, Congresswoman Maxine Waters announced a new working group for House Democrats focused on crypto regulation. The group's goal is to, quote, work together on legislation and policy solutions on such matters as crypto regulation, the use of blockchain and distributed ledger technology, and the possible development of a US. Central bank digital currency.
00:31:43.850 - 00:32:41.770, Speaker A: On Wednesday, Waters team released the group's roster, which will feature blockchain caucus and fintech task force leadership members. Bill Foster, a member of the working group and a blockchain programmer, told the bloc, quote, The United States is playing catch up to the rest of the world when it comes to digital currency, and if we're going to protect the US. Dollar status as the world's reserve currency, we need to make the development of secure and privacy preserving digital currency a priority. Also this week, the SEC delayed its Van Eck Bitcoin ETF decision, indicating it would like additional feedback in the filing. The SEC is specifically looking for public comments on the susceptibility of an ETF to market manipulation, along with whether the regulatory landscape has changed significantly since 2016, when Bitcoin ETFs first gained popular traction. Next headline can and should a Dow go to court. Welcome to the Metaverse.
00:32:41.770 - 00:33:55.650, Speaker A: A recent proposal on the governance form for Curve, a DFI project for stablecoin trading, calls for enforcing its intellectual property rights in court. Hydro Sam, the author of the proposal, believes that Curve's Dao should protect its IP on behalf of its stakeholders, just as centralized exchanges would protect IP on behalf of a shareholder. He writes, quote Centralized exchanges protect their IP on behalf of their shareholders, and there is no reason why Curve, just by virtue of its Dao organization, should not protect itself for the benefit of vote escrowed CRV token holders. Written on Wednesday, the proposal takes aim at Saddle Finance, a competing automated market maker, which, as the proposal notes, has been accused of wholesale copying of Curve code.
