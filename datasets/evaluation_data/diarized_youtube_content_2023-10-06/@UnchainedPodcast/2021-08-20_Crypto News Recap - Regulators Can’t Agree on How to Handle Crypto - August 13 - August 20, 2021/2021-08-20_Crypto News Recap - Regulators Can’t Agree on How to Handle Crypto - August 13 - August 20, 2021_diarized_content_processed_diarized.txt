We have secured licenses or approvals for Novi in nearly every state, and we will not launch anywhere. We have not yet received such clearances. The DM Association has become an independent entity for those in need of a refresher. Novi initially launched back in 2019 under the name Calibra as a wallet designed to host Facebook's stablecoin project Libra, which was started at roughly the same time.

Next Headline DeFi hack roundup, including the hack that never was just pulled off maybe the biggest white hat rescue ever. Paradigm researchers Sam Sun tweeted cryptically earlier this week before dropping a post titled Two Rights Might Make a Wrong Outlining a crazy sequence of events that went into patching a vulnerability in SushiSwap's fundraising platform Miso.
00:05:18.290 - 00:06:13.470, Speaker A: According to sun, the vulnerability centered on a flawed auction process and could have resulted in a loss of 109,000 Ethereum worth $350,000,000. Essentially, a hacker could have reused the same ETH in a bid over and over again and quote, bid in the auction for free until the entire token sale, which in this case was Bitdao's. Bit was drained. Luckily, Sam and a group of colleagues were able to identify and patch the bug in the platform in less than 5 hours with the help of the Sushi team. The bitdao auction therefore went off without a hitch, raising over 112,000 ETH. In related news, the Japanese exchange liquid lost $74 million in a hack that saw its hot wallets exploited in a security breach.

The hacker appears frustrated that Polygon has not yet unfrozen $33 million in stablecoins quote Your essays are becoming very convincing while your actions are showing your distrust. What a funny game. You don't even think to unlock my USDT account, the hacker wrote to the Polygon team before adding that they are, quote, not ready to publish the key in this week which would return the funds. On Polygon's side, it seems they are trying their best to get the funds returned safely.

Next Headline Polygon and Hermes complete the first blockchain merger Polygon, an Ethereum scaling project, has acquired Hermes network, a ZK roll up layer two solution for $250,000,000. This, to the best of our knowledge, is the first ever full blown merger of blockchain networks where one network will completely absorb the other, including its token. As Polygon Cofounder Mahalo Bielek told the block Hermes or HEZ will now become Polygon Hermes. With the 26 members of its staff moving over to the Polygon team as part of the merger, HEZ token holders can swap for Maddox at a ratio of 3.5 matic to one. HEZ.
00:07:53.090 - 00:08:58.470, Speaker A: Polygon has allocated roughly 12.5% of its treasury to pay for the acquisition. The Polygon Hermes merger is the first part of Polygon's new focus on ZK technology, which helps scale Ethereum by bundling transactions outside of the Ethereum main net, making for cheaper transactions, Bielic said. Quote we consider ZK cryptography the single most important strategic resource for blockchain scaling and infrastructure development, and we have a clear goal of becoming the leading force and contributor in this field in years to come.

Next Headline SEC Chair Gary Gensler thinks DFI can be regulated in an interview with the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said that DeFi projects that reward users with tokens or incentives could be regulated no matter how decentralized they say they are. According to Gensler, DeFi quote is a bit of a misnomer, as many platforms are similar to the types of centralized entities the SEC oversees.
00:08:58.470 - 00:09:55.322, Speaker A: There's still a core group of folks that are not only writing the software like the open source software, but they often have governance and fees, said Gensler. There's some incentive structure for these promoters and sponsors in the middle of this. Earlier this month, Gensler made similar comments, stating that, in his view, quote the legislative priority should center on crypto trading, lending and DeFi platforms. However, not all regulators feel that crypto should be treated with such a heavy hand. In an open letter to Gensler representatives Patrick McHenry and Glenn Thompson profess their belief that increased crypto trading would be a quote concerning roadmap that will have long term implications on the country. The two added quote rather than regulate innovation and job creation out of this country, we should promote an active dialogue between regulators and market participants. Additionally, representatives Tom Emmer and Darren Soto are working toward creating better crypto legislation in the US.
00:09:55.322 - 00:10:57.710, Speaker A: By reintroducing the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act on August 17. It aims to provide a safe harbor for blockchain firms that do not hold customer assets, which would be very helpful in light of the infrastructure bill's broad language concerning crypto brokers. In a statement on the announcement, Emmer said, quote Certain blockchain developers and service providers, like miners and multi signature service providers, should not have to register as money transmitters because they never custody consumer funds. And lastly, to round out the hard news of the week, a CFTC commissioner Brian Quintens, who is known for being pro crypto and was a recent guest on the show, just announced that he will be leaving office at the end of August.
