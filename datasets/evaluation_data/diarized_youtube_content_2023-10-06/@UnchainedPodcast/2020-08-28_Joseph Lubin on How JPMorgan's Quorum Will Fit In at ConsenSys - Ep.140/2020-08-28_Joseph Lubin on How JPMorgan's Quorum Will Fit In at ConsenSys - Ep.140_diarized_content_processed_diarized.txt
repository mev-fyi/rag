00:01:01.162 - 00:01:03.780, Speaker C: Hey, Laura. How are you? Thanks for having me on.
00:01:04.150 - 00:01:07.550, Speaker A: Consensus made a big acquisition this week and also got some investment.
00:01:07.630 - 00:01:08.478, Speaker B: Congratulations.
00:01:08.574 - 00:01:09.940, Speaker A: Tell us your big news.
00:01:10.790 - 00:02:15.730, Speaker C: So Consensus has been working with Morgan for quite a long time, more recently, to discuss how we might work together more intimately and sort of change the nature of the Quorum project. Quorum is essentially a blockchain infrastructure platform that Morgan created based on the Ethereum Go client, and they use it for their application needs. So they build a bunch of applications, blockchain applications on Quorum. A while ago, they decided that it maybe didn't make sense for them to be a blockchain protocol company. Consensus has now acquired that project and we are essentially the stewards of that open source project, merging it in terms of technical roadmap with our own enterprise Ethereum activities which are based on Hyperledger or Beisu. So we are providing support for Quorum. We are building out the Quorum roadmap.
00:02:15.730 - 00:03:01.810, Speaker C: And Quorum now constitutes consensus's. Enterprise ethereum offering. Whether the client chooses hyperledger Beisu as the foundational element or Geth as the foundational element, we're excited to offer for the first time really a fully comprehensive enterprise blockchain solution, including developer tools, security audit tools, customer success and support, sophisticated cloud configurations which are coming, and a bunch of applications that sit on the Quorum platform. In addition, JPMorgan has made a significant strategic investment and JPMorgan is a sizable client of Consensus.
00:03:01.970 - 00:03:20.730, Speaker B: And for listeners who aren't aware, hyperledger Besu is an enterprise Ethereum client that Consensus built. So if Geth is kind of like a software version for the public chain, then Hyperletrobisu is similar, but for enterprise.
00:03:21.570 - 00:04:03.766, Speaker C: Let me just add a little bit of detail without getting too much into the weeds. So both of these enterprise ethereum solutions have two layers. Layer one is Hyperledger Besu, which is a Java Ethereum client which connects to mainnet Ethereum. So it's a full fledged Ethereum client and it also has enterprise ethereum augmentations. And on the formerly Morgan side, Geth is a slight modification of the Go Ethereum client. So it doesn't, it's not currently able to connect to Mainnet. And that's been important to us to enable hybrid solutions to be created.
00:04:03.766 - 00:04:52.934, Speaker C: So private permissioned systems and with roughly the same client also connecting into mainnet. The layer two solution for both of those platforms, which are now all called Quorum, is called Orion, that sits on top of Hyperledger. Beisu provides confidentiality of transactions to a subset of actors. And Tessera that JPMorgan built, does the exact same thing on JPMorgan side. So the ultimate configuration of the Quorum client will see Tessera, which is a Java based Apache Two licensed confidentiality solution. It'll sit on top of Hyperledger, basically, which is also Java based, and Apache Two. So maximum permissivity in terms of licensing.
00:04:52.934 - 00:05:02.890, Speaker C: So no real constraints. There were a small number of institutions that weren't that comfortable with the GPL licensing of the Geth client.
00:05:03.050 - 00:05:18.834, Speaker B: Yeah, so getting into this licensing is getting a bit into the weeds. But as far as I understand, Apache Two enables private companies to make contributions to these open source, do whatever you want with it and keep them for themselves without having to contribute them back.
00:05:18.872 - 00:05:21.026, Speaker A: Which is sort of like being able.
00:05:21.048 - 00:05:29.086, Speaker B: To keep their secret sauce. And as you mentioned, JP Morgan will be a customer of Consensus's going and.
00:05:29.128 - 00:05:31.414, Speaker A: Or what are they using Quorum for?
00:05:31.612 - 00:06:30.854, Speaker C: So the publicly announced applications are their Interbank Information Network, which has north of 400 financial institutions around the world. And it's essentially a messaging layer similar to what Swift does. JPMorgan, I believe, has around 4000 financial institutions in their correspondent banking network. So one could imagine that all of those organizations, and perhaps more, will eventually end up on IIM. So Consensus is supporting that network and Consensus is also supporting JPM Coin, which is a stable Coin solution. So that's a separate network that Morgan has built on JPMorgan is if you do a little research, they're hiring very aggressively in blockchain. They've made it very clear, very public that they're doubling down on blockchain and enterprise Ethereum.
00:06:30.854 - 00:06:42.880, Speaker C: So it is very exciting for us to be a significant part of that. And it's exciting to see Morgan build probably a whole bunch more applications on the Quorum platform.
00:06:43.570 - 00:06:53.078, Speaker B: And for the acquisition of Quorum, are you only acquiring the Quorum open source code base, or will the Quorum team from Morgan also be joining Consensus?
00:06:53.274 - 00:07:19.820, Speaker C: So, the Quorum team is heavily engaged with us for at least a year to facilitate transition. And we're working together on a shared roadmap that we've defined and will continue to define together. I can't say much more of a detailed nature about that right now, but we are working intimately with those people.
00:07:20.510 - 00:07:36.986, Speaker B: Okay, so I guess we'll have to have you back or talk to somebody to find out how that will all work. And so just to circle back about the Beisu, so customers will be able to choose between Hyperledger Beisu and Consensus Quorum.
00:07:37.018 - 00:07:37.566, Speaker A: Is that?
00:07:37.668 - 00:08:43.154, Speaker C: Yeah, that's correct. And part of the work that we're doing together over the next year with high intensity is to affect plug and play interoperability between the two versions of Quorum. So we've been working on that for a long time in the context of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance defining standards that would enable those two clients and other clients from Block apps and various other organizations to essentially either sit on the same network simultaneously or potentially enable a customer to switch from one to another if they felt that necessary. We remain pretty passionate about interoperability about building standards based clients. It's really the only blockchain technology in the world that's focused heavily on standards based approaches and we haven't pulled back at all from that. In fact, we're doubling down on that.
00:08:43.192 - 00:09:10.418, Speaker B: As so just so I'm clear, and the listeners are clear, essentially the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance is setting standards and then it's not clear to me actually how Hyperlink Besu and Consensus Quorum will be differentiated or like, why one would choose one versus the other. Is it just similar to how, for instance, on the public chain there's Parity and Geth and people sort of choose based on features?
00:09:10.614 - 00:09:11.470, Speaker A: Is that it?
00:09:11.540 - 00:10:07.534, Speaker C: It's a little bit different than that. There is a pretty sizable cohort, hundreds of organizations that use the Geth version of Quorum and a sizable cohort that use the Hyperledger besu based version of Quorum. And we need to support both in parallel going forward. During that period, we are going to work to make them plug and play interoperable or compatible so that we can essentially substitute one for the other. At some point, potentially twelve months from now, potentially longer, we do hope to move the layer two JPMorgan piece called Tera and put that on top of Hyperledger Basu so that that configuration will be the long term configuration going forward.
00:10:07.732 - 00:10:15.840, Speaker B: All right, so in a moment we're going to discuss more about the news, including aspects of the investment. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible.

00:11:19.210 - 00:11:29.442, Speaker B: Back to my conversation with Joe Lupin. The Bloc reported that JPMorgan Chase is making a $20 million investment of convertible debt into Consensus.
00:11:29.506 - 00:11:30.970, Speaker A: Is that figure accurate?
00:11:31.390 - 00:11:38.490, Speaker C: I cannot confirm nor deny that that figure is accurate at this point, but I might have something more to say at some point in the future.
00:11:38.640 - 00:11:39.340, Speaker A: Okay.
00:11:40.270 - 00:11:51.214, Speaker B: And it's been reported for a while that Jpmorgh sorry, that Consensus is raising money and $200 million was the figure reported by The Information last year.
00:11:51.252 - 00:11:52.590, Speaker A: Is that still the target?
00:11:53.170 - 00:12:04.690, Speaker C: I've seen lots of different numbers reported. If we are in fact continuing to raise, I cannot confirm nor deny that any of those numbers that I've read publicly are accurate.
00:12:05.270 - 00:12:10.006, Speaker B: Okay. All right, well, I guess we'll have to circle back for yet another reason.
00:12:10.108 - 00:12:15.606, Speaker C: Yeah. Happy to come on the show again in some period of time and discuss that.
00:12:15.708 - 00:12:17.062, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah.
00:12:17.116 - 00:12:30.214, Speaker B: I mean, there's plenty to discuss, but we're going to actually dive into some of these other things right now because obviously Consensus has been going through a larger restructuring for quite a while, for a couple of years. So how does this I think since.
00:12:30.272 - 00:12:38.400, Speaker C: We were born, really for five years, we were a very different company in the first year than the second year. So yes.
00:12:38.850 - 00:12:39.600, Speaker A: Okay.
00:12:39.970 - 00:12:44.450, Speaker C: The latest incarnations of Consensus are very exciting.
00:12:45.030 - 00:13:08.490, Speaker B: Well, given the, I would say, the downsizing that's been happening since December 2018, you've been through a series of layoffs. You're now restructuring to kind of focus more on software development on one side of the business and venture activities on the other side. So how does this acquisition fit into those goals?
00:13:09.550 - 00:13:50.006, Speaker C: So, a short while so the main organization all along has been Consensus AG. It house investment activities, portfolio management activities, software development activities, professional services activities. We just recently spun out a company called Consensus Software. Consensus Software houses our blockchain stack. So it's a coherent, integrated software product company. That's what it focuses on. It does a bunch of professional services largely centered around our products.
00:13:50.006 - 00:15:09.182, Speaker C: It consists of products like those created by our Pegasus Group, our Protocol Engineering and Systems Group, which now is the steward for Quorum. It consists of, infura our Infrastructure Group, which handles on some days up to 10 billion queries from the ecosystem, from the IPFS and Filecoin ecosystem. It consists of Codify or Commerce and Decentralized Finance Group, which has a number of products on the DFI side in sort of enterprise business process elements, consists of MetaMask, which is sitting around 500,000 monthly actives and about 1.2 million slightly less active installs. And we have a set of developer tools, so the Truffle suite of developer tools and Diligence, which is security audit tools, and a group of brilliant people that manually security audit. We have the ability to do quite a bit of customization work in our professional services group. And actually, maybe one of the most important groups that I almost didn't highlight is our Customer Success and Support group.
00:15:09.182 - 00:15:44.838, Speaker C: So you don't often think of that as a star in a group like that, but it's led by individual who did the same at HP Enterprise. It's been running for two and a half years, approaching three years, and it has been already supporting Quorum on many different networks. So smaller networks run by individual organizations, or larger networks like the Comgo Commodity Trade Finance Consortium or the Covantis Commodities Trading Consortium.
00:15:45.014 - 00:16:08.820, Speaker B: And this is all happening at a very interesting time, not only in the industry but also in the world. And obviously we've seen that the Coronavirus Pandemic has affected all kinds of businesses. And it was reported that Consensus received between 1 million and $5 million in the payroll protection program due to COVID. How has the Pandemic affected your business?
00:16:09.430 - 00:17:19.580, Speaker C: So we saw a set of complicated discussions with both customers as well as some organizations that we're speaking to about investment. We had projections that would have seen us double our revenue this year, and we have had to scale that back a little bit. We're still going to almost certainly achieve revenue that is a good chunk, larger in percentage than last year. But we've certainly seen slowing down and dropping of some projects and we've seen a lot of new interest. Actually, some of the new interest may be related a little bit to COVID. So there have been some identity projects that popped up and some specifically around health passports and things like that. But this news has been under the radar for a little while, and Consensus bringing this comprehensive enterprise ethereum solution with full support, which is something that Morgan as a bank wasn't really configured to do.
00:17:19.580 - 00:17:30.006, Speaker C: It's already been circulating and so we've actually seen quite a lot of new interest around the Quorum acquisition.
00:17:30.198 - 00:17:57.910, Speaker B: And one other piece of news that a Consensus project kind of created a little bit of a small outcry, I would say, at least on crypto. Twitter was that MetaMask was changing its licensing. And from what I could see, it seemed that maybe this is part of Consensus's restructuring to focus more on software development or no. Do you want to?
00:17:57.980 - 00:18:43.986, Speaker C: It really has nothing to do with restructuring of Consensus, and we've been an integrated software company, increasingly integrated and really firing on all cylinders for approaching a year now. And we just moved into a separate legal entity with that group. MetaMask has been working towards commercialization or Monetization. It is a heavily open source project. It is by far the most open project of all the wallets out there. In fact, all the other wallets are proprietary, not even in the same category. We have a handful of Monetization strategies, some of which are going to land extremely soon.
00:18:43.986 - 00:18:47.940, Speaker C: A number of days from now. One very exciting one.
00:18:49.030 - 00:18:51.046, Speaker B: Do you want to tease what that is right now?
00:18:51.148 - 00:18:57.382, Speaker C: There's a tease. I've been told that I'm not allowed to, but that's the extent of the tease that I can do.
00:18:57.436 - 00:18:57.846, Speaker B: Okay.
00:18:57.948 - 00:18:58.778, Speaker A: All right.
00:18:58.944 - 00:20:19.970, Speaker C: There are upstream projects, browsers that make use of the MetaMask code base and strip out the name and modify it in other ways and strip out reference codes and essentially remove the ability for MetaMask to monetize in the context of that project. And so the MetaMask license hasn't changed for anybody except users with more than 10,000 monthly actives who are effectively trying to commercialize with the code base that we built. So the act of modifying that license just slightly has had positive impact already. And the community had some really great ideas. The community stani Ivave put together a great sketch of a token model and we've been thinking quite a lot about token models within MetaMask for a long time. And I think we're zeroing in on something that's pretty exciting. So it's not going to hit anytime really soon, but it's almost so we do hope to go in that direction and enable the community to get much more involved in the governance and potential monetization of MetaMask.
00:20:20.470 - 00:20:21.986, Speaker B: Sounds very interesting.
00:20:22.168 - 00:20:25.234, Speaker A: We'll keep my eye out for what happens there.
00:20:25.352 - 00:20:37.800, Speaker B: And one other big thing that happened, obviously recently was the five year anniversary of Ethereum. When you look back, what are your thoughts about the journey so far and where Ethereum is headed with Ethereum 2.0?
00:20:38.110 - 00:21:46.000, Speaker C: I guess nothing but excitement. I think many of us thought that the technology was so powerful and the particular representation, the particular configuration that Vitalik put forth initially was just so spot on that it was likely to be the programmable expressive blockchain that became very significant, if not dominant. So not surprised by how well it's doing. It is astonishing how it's not mainstream yet, but so many people have heard about Bitcoin, so many people have heard about Ethereum and it's turning into a sizable and very rapidly growing industry that I think is going to eat the world in a very positive way or enable the world to reconfigure itself in healthier ways. And with respect to Ethereum too, we're really on track. Testnet is showing great results. I was hoping that we'd run into some serious and ugly problems on Testnet, and we did.
00:21:46.000 - 00:23:12.490, Speaker C: I would have been very uncomfortable if we didn't discover a handful of bugs and if we didn't have situations where we needed to respond in real time, have the team solve problems, have the teams coordinate the solution to the problem and have the network heal itself with the pushing of new code. And that's exactly what happened. It was a pretty nasty issue, but the network did end up after a few days figuring out how to heal itself and start finalizing again. So super excited about that. I think we're on track to launch before the end of this year, and I think data availability, shards and execution environments are likely to follow relatively quickly, I think faster than more skeptical people might believe, just because a lot of the complexity is resident in phase zero and we can put together a more simplified version of data availability shards. They're going to be especially helpful initially for Ethereum One. For layer two roll ups on Ethereum One they will be able to use that guaranteed data availability.
00:23:12.490 - 00:23:48.550, Speaker C: And I do believe that we'll see some not too complicated one or more execution environments appear very quickly, possibly alongside phase one. Very bullish. Ethereum One is doing great as it stands. We have a number of different layer two scalability solutions live and coming online. So Scalability is getting addressed right now and Scalability is going to get a massive shot in the arm, say twelve months from now.
00:23:48.700 - 00:23:58.774, Speaker B: Yeah, well, hopefully for Ethereum it will be just in the nick of time because there's clearly a lot of demand and the fees are high and people are getting a bit antsy.
00:23:58.902 - 00:25:02.990, Speaker C: Sure. But throughout the history of information technology technologists have built out new hardware and software solutions and other technologists have maxed them out virtually instantly. So unless we have massive utilization and real uncomfortable straining of the system we don't know exactly where needs the attention to build out with respect to Scalability. So it's going to be as it has been with so many technologies from memory to CPUs to screen size to internet connections. It's going to be a constant cycling of greater capability that gets eaten up immediately by the application developers. And so very excited to see that we're bumping up against the ceiling yet again. The ceiling will continue to be raised and we'll continue to try to bump up against it and raise it higher.
00:25:03.140 - 00:25:11.418, Speaker B: Great. Well I look forward to seeing Ethereum and Consensus too on that journey. Thank you so much for coming on Unconfirmed.
00:25:11.514 - 00:25:12.390, Speaker C: Thanks, Tor.
00:25:12.490 - 00:25:15.250, Speaker B: Don't forget, next up is the weekly news recap.
00:25:19.430 - 00:26:34.794, Speaker A: Hi everyone, thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap. First headline fidelity bets on Bitcoin with New Fund forbes reports that Fidelity president and head of consulting Peter Jubber filed paperwork Wednesday for a new Bitcoin dedicated fund with a minimum investment of $100,000 likely aimed at institutional and accredited investors. Called the Wise Origin Bitcoin Index Fund, it does not yet have investors and is unclear what the relationship is between Fidelity Digital Asset and an organization called Wise Origin Funds. Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC is to be the fund's custodian. Fidelity's Intellectual Property vice president has filed a trademark application for the name Wise Origin Funds. Frank Chaparro of the Bloc wrote that a Bitcoin fund by Fidelity could be the next best thing to a Bitcoin ETF because although the fund will not be available to retail investors it could potentially become available to investor advisors to sell to their own clients. Next Headline Shifting approach to inflation by Fed could bolster bitcoin A new policy unveiled Thursday by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell would lead inflation rates and thus the cost of borrowing to stay low for longer.
00:26:34.794 - 00:27:55.742, Speaker A: The change would allow inflation to run higher than usual for certain periods to target an average inflation rate of 2% over time. Bitcoiners such as the Winklevoss twins pointed to the change to bolster their contention that the US dollar is an increasingly unreliable store of value and coming inflation will devalue the dollar, further, allowing bitcoin with its cap supply to potentially overtake gold. Bit briefly in value after Powell outlined the Fed's new tolerance for higher inflation, but so far there has been an otherwise muted reaction to Powell's comments. Analysts previously speculated that Powell's speech could help boost bitcoin and lead to further drops in the power of the dollar, but the long term effect of the new policy remains to be seen. Next Headline SEC expands the definition Credit investor The securities and Exchange Commission revised the definition of accredited investor, which determines who is able to participate in private investments such as token sales. Now, not only are income or net worth acceptable qualifications, but so are certain designations or credentials based on professional knowledge or certifications. For instance, holders of series 765 and 82 licenses which have to do with private security sales and investment advising are now included.
00:27:55.742 - 00:29:09.354, Speaker A: However, because this would not significantly increase the pool of accredited investors, response to the news was mixed. Athena Blockchain general counsel Drew Hing tweeted that'll be not meaningful, at least not yet. Cardozo School of Law professor and Open Law co founder Aaron Wright tweeted, however, that the news was, quote, a big step in the right direction, setting up a framework for technical accreditation in the future. SEC Commissioner Hester Purse issued a statement calling for even greater expansion to the definition. She said, quote Why shouldn't mom and pop retail investors be allowed to invest in private offerings? Why should I, as a regulator, decide what other Americans do with their money? Next Headline FTX acquires Blockfolio for $150,000,000 Crypto Derivatives Exchange FTX has acquired popular crypto data app Blockfolio in a $150,000,000 attempt to expand its retail footprint. The deal came out of initial discussions between the companies about how they might collaborate and is one of the largest acquisitions in crypto this year. Blockfolio, which has 6 million users and receives 150,000,000 impressions a month, will receive a mix of equity, FTX's, native token and cash.
00:29:09.354 - 00:30:24.558, Speaker A: It remains unclear how Blockfolio will fit into the FTX ecosystem, although the firms are working on a retail trading feature and the deal is seen as akin to Binance acquisition of coin market cap and that coin market cap and Blockfolio could bring in a lot of traffic that then funnels down to their respective exchange partners. Next Headline DCG to invest $100 million in bitcoin mining Digital Currency Group revealed a new mining subsidiary called Foundry that will invest $100 million in mining bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in North America. Foundry has been operating its own mining operations since 2019, plus offering crypto startups, mining equipment and financing, and it also plans to move into staking. DCG founder and CEO Barry Silbert hopes to increase the US's. Share of global bitcoin production, especially compared to that of China, as there are currently few significant mining operations in North America. However, a number of failed efforts here previously could indicate that it may be a hard road ahead. The firm expects DCG's network deep experience in crypto and support from federal and local officials, who may also not want to cede production of bitcoin to China to help it succeed.
00:30:24.558 - 00:32:10.690, Speaker A: Next Headline How Will copycat projects fare in DeFi the yield farming? Craze has raised a question if it's easy to fork code and launch a project that promises advantages over the original, and if it's so easy for users to move from project to project chasing the highest yield, then what will survive the block's? Stephen Zhang notes that August saw a number of copycat projects that piggybacked off other projects'code to launch their own tokens, along with Catchy memes and Enticing yield farming schemes. Yearn and Yam are great examples of this, and in the area of DEXs, or automated market makers, Munaswap and SushiSwap are near clones of current heavyweight Uniswap. Munaswap claims to improve on Uniswap by preventing arbitrage ores from taking all the slippage and instead keeping most of it in the pool to redistribute to liquidity providers. Meanwhile, SushiSwap has a governance token, Sushi, part of which will be set aside to fund development, which at Uniswap is currently funded by VCs and Steven's. Conclusion is quote at the end of the day, like the mania of 2017, these often uninspired forks of other forks will attract liquidity into the ecosystem, and as a result of a sector flushed with cash, we may see some truly useful projects flourish. Next Headline Fun Bits Arthur Hayes Weighs In on Yield Farming Arthur Hayes of BitMax, or what is now called 100 X Group, is always entertaining to read, and his latest misf on his adventures in DFI, as well as his breakdown of what drives demand and supply and crypto credit is no exception.

After describing the main players in the crypto ecosystem miners, speculators, borrowers, lenders, exchanges, et cetera he talks about how DeFi has decentralized all of it and then says that he is enjoying yield farming meme tokens. However, like any smart investor in crypto, he fully expects to lose all his money. Quote in my head, I like to believe I can read market sentiment and get out at the top of the bull market. But in reality, like most other traders, I will buy high, hold hold and sell well after the top all right, well, thanks for tuning in.
