00:01:19.130 - 00:01:24.390, Speaker A: Today's guest is Ben Sellermeyer, index manager at Coimetrics. Welcome, Ben.
00:01:25.050 - 00:01:26.934, Speaker C: Thank you, Laura, for having me.
00:01:27.132 - 00:01:55.810, Speaker A: This week, Coimetrics came out with a new metric that addresses a tricky issue with crypto assets, especially when it comes to market capitalization. But before we dive into the details on that news, let's just give a big picture overview, because CoinMetrics has actually developed a number of supply metrics. As far as I can tell, I think there are at least four. So why so many? What problem or problems are you guys trying to solve when it comes to the supply of blockchain based tokens?
00:01:56.870 - 00:03:00.790, Speaker C: Yeah, so it's a super interesting problem. And I think that one of the things that we're trying to overcome is that there are just numerous ways that blockchains can be analyzed and looked at and observed, and when the most transparent and the most obvious way to look at blockchains is just what's looking on ledger. So that's the very first supply metric that we came out with and that's what we call current supply. And it's just all tokens that are observed from looking at the ledger. And then once you start to understand that, you understand that that is not the most optimal way to look at the supply that's in the market, especially when you're considering indexes, which is a lot of what I do. And when you're looking to rebalance indexes, you're really trying to represent the real market dynamics and the liquidity that's within the market. And that's a lot of the reason why we came up with free flow to kind of get that better understanding of what's available to market participants, which makes managing an index or tracking a portfolio a lot easier for individuals.
00:03:00.790 - 00:03:34.820, Speaker C: One of the third ones is the future supply. So by looking at future supply. What we hope to do is we hope to have that forward looking view of how the market perceives or how the market values the issuance of new tokens high inflation can lead to a depreciated value today. So we kind of look at what that future supply is to get to hopefully reduce index turnover and index issues down the future by having that forward looking approach. So they're the three primary ones that we have.
00:03:37.030 - 00:03:44.500, Speaker A: And so now let's talk about the new metric that you announced this week, free float supply. Tell us about that.
00:03:45.110 - 00:04:49.770, Speaker C: Yeah, so free float supply is a lot of work in the making and super happy to have it out in the public now and available on our community tools. But what we hope to do is, again, there's no industry standard for supply across the market. And in traditional capital markets, it's very easy. You look on Yahoo, you look on Bloomberg, you look in the newspaper and there's just one supply figure everywhere you go with crypto assets that's up for debate and that's anyone's guess at the minute, depending on which data distributor you go to, you'll get a different value for the free float or the supply in the market. And what we hope to do was come up with a standardized methodology that can be applied across the plethora of crypto assets that are out there that very objectively looks at what the supply that's available in the market currently is. And the way we do that is we look at that on chain supply, that current supply, and we subtract coins that belong to holders that we feel restrict supply to markets.
00:04:52.030 - 00:04:57.850, Speaker A: But why are you doing that? What problem are you trying to address with this free float supply?
00:04:58.190 - 00:06:09.134, Speaker C: Yeah, so the key issue that we're trying to address, or the key problem is that by having a better understanding of what's available to the market, investors can be more informed on what a true picture of market capitalization is. Or index managers can have a better indication of how they should be weighting portfolios and balancing portfolios and allocating their dollars across assets. Because what you get is if you were to, for example, some of the, some of the ones that deviate most from their on chain supply are ones like Ripple, Stellar, crypto.com where they have these huge issuances, but there's potentially between 15 and 30% that's actually available to markets to trade. So by having that disparity, it makes it very hard if you take the bigger number, if you're trying to allocate and weight a portfolio with that. So by looking at the free float supply, you do get that better picture and you do get that better idea of what the liquidity in the market is and therefore you can make smarter investment decisions.
00:06:09.262 - 00:06:34.490, Speaker A: And I should disclose that stellar and crypto.com, I know that crypto.com is a sponsor for this. If I'm not sure if stellar was or currently is, but it has at some point been whether or not that's still. So when you calculate the free float, like, what are you taking off the table when you do that, what do you subtract?
00:06:34.990 - 00:07:20.202, Speaker C: Yeah, so we're subtracting big categories of investors that we deem again as those strategic long term holders that aren't providing liquidity to markets. So the classical ones that we look at are the foundations themselves. So in a lot of instances, foundations are known to hold a lot of tokens at the time of ICO or the time of issuance. We're looking at team members. Going back through the team member wallets, it becomes evident that a lot of them do act as long term holders. So therefore we subtract their tokens as well. We're subtracting tokens for individuals who do hold the crypto asset without transacting it for over five years.
00:07:20.202 - 00:07:59.510, Speaker C: So that's more relevant. For some of the older coins, like bitcoin we subtract, I'd say they're the three primary categories. And then there are some smaller categories. One that's particularly relevant to stellar is we subtract lost tokens or burnt tokens. So for stellar, for example, they burned, I think it was around 55 billion tokens within the last year, and that we wouldn't include in free float supply, but it's still visible on chain. So therefore there's again a reason why we look at the free float supply as opposed to on chain supply when looking at indexes and investability.
00:08:00.650 - 00:08:15.306, Speaker A: And one thing that I found interesting is that it excludes some of the tokens that you say are provably lost. So how do you figure out if funds are provably lost? It seems, at least for some of them, it would be kind of hard to figure it out.
00:08:15.488 - 00:09:01.930, Speaker C: Yeah. So there are very few tokens that do fall into that provably lost category. It's not an individual saying, hey, I've provably lost my keys. But it's more ones like the smart contract failures, like the parity wallet, like the parity wallet hack, or like the stellar foundation, where they did send it to an unspendable address. So they're deemed to be provably lost. And I think they're the two biggest categories, or potentially the only two categories of tokens that we consider in that provably lost. One of the other things we do apply to that is we do apply a minimum, which I think it's a minimum as a percentage of the total supply, so that we're not chasing 0.2
00:09:01.930 - 00:09:23.650, Speaker C: bitcoin that are provably lost in somewhere. But yeah, so what we did strive to do is with a lot of the methodologies and a lot of the categories of token holders that we do exclude, we look to leverage a lot of what's done in traditional capital markets. And that has worked very well for us, being able to leverage that knowledge.
00:09:23.990 - 00:10:02.250, Speaker A: Okay. And I actually just wanted to kind of break out a little bit more the differences between the traditionally reported supply versus the free float supply. And as you mentioned, so Bitcoins is somewhat large, probably simply because it was the first cryptocurrency. So I think a lot of coins were lost. You hear those stories about people who decided to go dumpster diving their hard drives, but that one, let's see. So it's typically said to have like, 18.4 million coins, but the under free float supply, it only has 14.3.
00:10:02.250 - 00:10:35.830, Speaker A: And the difference in market cap would be something like, we might say, like, 168,000,000,000. But in the table that coin metrics had in its chart, it was actually 130,000,000,000. If you're using the free float, as you mentioned. Also, the XRP one was really big. That one was 44 billion coins in the standard industry reported supply versus 30 billion in the free float supply. That takes the market cap from 8 billion down to 5 billion. So that's like 30% less.
00:10:35.830 - 00:10:49.260, Speaker A: But the biggest one actually was Bitcoin SV. The difference, the standard industry reported supply was 18.4 million versus 10 million in the free float supply. I was just so curious, why is that one so large?
00:10:50.110 - 00:11:48.880, Speaker C: Yeah, so what we did for a lot of the fork coins was we look at this concept of what's being activated post fork as an indication of how many people are actually using the network or how many people are actually providing supply to the network. So if you look at Bitcoin SV and Bitcoin cash, what we're trying to identify is which of the UTXOs have been activated or partially spent. And that gives you an indication of how many people have actually claimed those tokens and therefore have the right to be considered as sellers or suppliers of BCH or BSV to the market. It's not to say that that won't change in the future if someone who hold or who held 50,000 BTC at the time of the BCH fork, or it's not to say that they won't activate it in the future. But it's to say, with the current knowledge that we have, this is our best guess or this is the best estimation at what can be considered supply in the market.
00:11:49.410 - 00:12:01.140, Speaker A: All right, so in a moment, we'll look a little bit more at that difference between the free float versus the traditionally reported supply when it comes to other coins. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible.
00:12:02.070 - 00:12:29.450, Speaker B: In this crisis, many investors aim to keep and grow their digital assets. Others seek to maximize the yield on their cash. Nexa allows you to achieve both of these goals. The company offers instant crypto credit lines against all major cryptocurrencies, with interest rates starting from only 5.9% Apr. Nexo also allows you to earn up to 8% annually on your Fiat and digital assets. What's more, interest is paid out daily, and you can add or withdraw funds at any time.
00:12:29.450 - 00:12:31.366, Speaker B: Get started at Nexo.
00:12:31.478 - 00:12:50.980, Speaker A: IO back to my conversation with Ben seller. Meyer so one other one that was pretty interesting to me was tether. So for some reason, like in your chart in early 2019, the amount of tether issued did not match the amount of tether in the markets. Why was that?
00:12:51.590 - 00:13:45.940, Speaker C: Yeah, so this was a super interesting finding that I learned as well. But what happens is when tether mint new USDT, they don't necessarily issue it. So they've got their tether treasury. And similarly, when tether is out there and existing in the market, if people send it back to the treasury, tether don't necessarily burn it at the same time it's sent back. Which means that there can be this big discrepancy between how many USDT is on chain and minted versus how many is actually in the market, because the tether treasury holding it isn't a representation of what's available and trading in markets. So that's what happened during 2018. 2019 is the tether treasury started either minting coins without issuing them, or when it got coins back in the treasury, it didn't burn them.
00:13:46.410 - 00:14:22.726, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah. And so actually, then in that chart, it becomes pretty clear kind of how free float really is relevant for how the coin will trade, because the graph then showed a correlation between the free float tether supply and the bitcoin price, whereas the total supply was not as correlated. Why is that? It's just because it was the most liquid stablecoin or the correlation.
00:14:22.858 - 00:15:00.990, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that's for traders and speculators. But, I mean, there has been a lot of research done around the supply of stablecoins in the market in relation to the price of bitcoin. And especially if demand for stable coins increases, there's a lot of speculation that sorry. If supply increases, there's a lot of speculation that that means there's demand for a USDT on ramp so that people can buy bitcoin. So that speculation can hopefully be better informed by looking at the free float figures as opposed to the on chain figures.
00:15:01.730 - 00:15:32.840, Speaker A: Okay. And in the same blog post where you introduced the free float supply, you also talked about some of these common valuation methods that do rely on the market capitalization. And so the first one that you guys talked about was NVT ratio, which is the network value to transaction ratio, and that measures the total value of bitcoin against the value transmitted through the network. So when you looked at that using the free float supply against the traditional market cap, what did you find?
00:15:33.770 - 00:17:12.710, Speaker C: Yeah, so what we found was using traditional market cap, you've got this natural appreciation of bitcoin's market value just by virtue of the issuance or the mining activity in bitcoin. But that doesn't again, if you're looking at free float versus traditional market cap or traditional crypto asset market cap, it doesn't necessarily mean that the network's value is increasing. If coins that are over five years old that haven't been transacted either aren't in the market or they're lost or for whatever reason, they're just not contributing to the trade. We found that by reducing those or subtracting those, it potentially gives slightly better signal and it gives you a better indication of what the true market cap is for the asset class by which you can then measure a ratio of true market cap versus or I won't say true market cap, but available market cap versus the transactions. So for example, if you're trying to measure transactions today versus transactions a year ago, even if transactions haven't changed, there are just more bitcoin that are being mined and more bitcoin that are being created. So it does have that natural appreciation. So what we found is by having the free float, it hopefully gives you a better or a sharper indication of signal, especially in I think at the minute it's the overbought region is where.
00:17:12.860 - 00:18:01.110, Speaker A: Yeah, people, I'll include the link to this post in the show notes because you can easily see the difference. And I would say, as we would expect, that the difference does increase over time. So the more recent part of the graph is where that distinction is more clear. And yeah, frankly I'm not a trader and I don't think the traders listen to my show very much. However, looking at that I was like, oh yeah, if I were a trader I definitely would probably prefer to use this metric for NVT ratio and then let's talk about the other one, the market value to realized value ratio. How did that differ when you use the free float supply?
00:18:01.690 - 00:18:50.870, Speaker C: Yeah, by a similar logic you've got a market value that's perpetually increasing. Well, assuming price stays constant, your market value just naturally increases given the inflation rate. And therefore, again, by looking at what's available to the market, what we found was that you get a sharper signal this time on the buy side signal where we found that you again have that natural appreciation in the metric. And by just looking at what's available to the market, you do potentially get a better indication of, well looking historically of where you could look at opportunistic buy entries for Bitcoin.
00:18:51.530 - 00:19:17.600, Speaker A: So one thing I was thinking about is a lot of these networks are looking well, I should say the newer networks are looking to govern via tokens and so those decisions could have an impact on things like the emission rate or lockups or whatever. So is your team just going to continually update this free float number for all these different coins? There must be so much work.
00:19:18.850 - 00:20:30.246, Speaker C: Yes, so we will and we will look to expand our coverage of the assets. One of the neat things for me, at least, working at CoinMetrics is there's no shortage of skill or no shortage of expertise in the team and what the team has been able to do, leveraging most of the network data capabilities and the nodes we run and all the other metrics we run. Is there's real time monitoring of these addresses? So every time we get daily reports for each of the transactions in and out of any of our tagged addresses so that we can very much monitor, just have this laser focus on what the addresses of interest are, and we can monitor the inflows and outflows from those wallets and make assessments on the Go as to whether they're just cold wallet Shuffles, foundation Wallet Shuffles, team Wallet Shuffles or whether they are actually providing liquidity to markets by going to exchanges or recently, some of the interesting ones have been token movements to compound for yield farming and activities like that.
00:20:30.428 - 00:20:31.682, Speaker A: Not surprising.
00:20:31.826 - 00:20:32.520, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:20:34.730 - 00:20:44.726, Speaker A: All right, well, so what new indices or financial products could you see making use of this free float supply metric or any of your other recently introduced metrics?
00:20:44.918 - 00:21:23.670, Speaker C: Yeah, so we hope to launch the CMBI ten in the next, I'll say month or two. And what that will be is that will be our version of a top ten weighted market cap and that will use free float. So again, we hope to better represent the liquidity of the market through using this metric. But the metric is available for any index that does want to wait with free float as opposed to company reported or on chain market cap. Yeah, that's what we hope to do with it. We just hope to provide transparency. We hope to provide a standard to the market.
00:21:23.670 - 00:21:39.500, Speaker C: We hope to provide education so that users or participants of the Crypto Asset network can have that or can have an informed metric that does follow a standardized methodology across the crypto asset class.
00:21:40.030 - 00:21:44.490, Speaker A: All right, well, we will look out for that. Thanks so much for coming on Unconfirmed.
00:21:44.650 - 00:21:46.206, Speaker C: Cheers. Thank you so much for having me.
00:21:46.228 - 00:21:53.520, Speaker A: Laura, don't forget to stay tuned for the weekly news recap. Stick around for this week in Crypto after this short break.

00:22:26.270 - 00:22:59.798, Speaker A: Hi, everyone. Thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap. First headline PayPal and Venmo to launch crypto buying and selling. You guys. So this was actually a story from last week and due to a copy paste error yes, I know, that's kind of crazy. In my recap last week, I neglected to include this story, which was the biggest news story last week, which is, as the headline says that PayPal and Venmo will be launching crypto Buying and selling. Although it's not clear which tokens will be available.
00:22:59.798 - 00:24:14.602, Speaker A: The service could roll out in as soon as within the next three months. All right, so now on to the headlines for this week DeFi hacks continue. With half a million dollars hacked from Balancer, the hacks in DFI continued this week with another multi protocol attack, draining about $500,000 worth of tokens from automated market maker Pools. On Balancer, the attacker took out a flash loan of wrapped ETH on dYdX and swapped it for a so called deflationary coin called Statera ticker sta, which meant that there would be a 1% transfer fee charged from the recipient per transaction. However, the balancer pool did not recognize that with each transaction, it was receiving 1% less of sta. And the hacker made this transaction 24 times to drain sta from the pool and then used the last single one way sta to get the pool to release more wrapped ETH and drain that pool. The hacker repeated this with WBTC SNX and Link, the wrapped bitcoin synthetics token and link for chainlink tokens.
00:24:14.602 - 00:25:07.406, Speaker A: And then, because Balancer is actually giving out liquidity mining rewards right now, the attacker also obtained more balancer pool tokens and then used to get even more wrapped ETH. If you followed all that, then good for you. So this actually was similar to the lend FME attack in that this stems from a certain type of technology being used in a system that could not account for that technology. And also what was similar is that this potential problem was actually flagged beforehand or known beforehand. Someone had previously flagged this as a potential issue to the Balancer team. In the end, Balancer decided to fully reimburse all liquidity providers who lost funds during the attack. Next headline dex's surging hit a new all time high.
00:25:07.406 - 00:25:58.800, Speaker A: Monthly trade volume on DEXes reached $1.51 billion in June, up 70% compared to May's volume, which was just shy of $900 million. It's also up 46% compared to the previous all time high of $1 billion in March. Uniswap and Curve led the pack when it came to Dex volume, although total Dex volume is still just 2% of the volume on centralized exchanges. The block also did a nice deep dive on Dex aggregators such as One Inch Exchange, Toddle and Paraswap. Unsurprisingly prices are best on the aggregators, as opposed to single DEXs, especially for larger orders. And this week, the Zero X Protocol launched its own Dex aggregator called Matcha, which I think is a really good name.
00:25:58.800 - 00:27:18.446, Speaker A: All right, next headline the bitcoin stock to flow theory turns out to be nonsense well, the graph certainly looked credible. People may have heard of the stock to flow valuation model for Bitcoin, espoused by the pseudonymous plan B Twitter account. We mentioned it here on the show, such as in the Bitcoin having episode, and potentially also in the episode with Dan Moorhead of Pantera Capital on Unconfirmed. In case you don't recall, the stock to flow theory says that bitcoin has an unforgivable costliness because it takes a lot of electricity to produce new bitcoins, and that means that bitcoins cannot be easily faked. It then posits that since there's a large supply of gold compared to the new supply introduced to it, that gives it a high stock to flow ratio, and that bitcoin's stock to flow ratio is about half that of gold's currently, but will someday be even higher, and that will eventually result in the price rising. So theory seems to make sense since we all know that the new bitcoins minted with every block will asymptotically reach zero eventually. However, a few posts, including an op ed this week by Nico Cordero, the chief investment officer and fund manager at Strix.
00:27:18.446 - 00:28:07.000, Speaker A: Leviathan, points out a fundamental flaw in the theory There is zero correlation between the stock to flow for gold and its price. There's an extremely striking chart in the op ed that shows this. In the op ed, he says, quote we believe the model's accuracy will likely be about as successful at forecasting bitcoin's future price as the astrological models of the past were at predicting financial outcomes. Eric Wall. The CIO of Arcane assets pointed out. Or he wrote of a post chronicling all the people who determined the model was flawed. All right, next headline ethereums and investors beat the drum for EIP 1559.
00:28:07.000 - 00:29:10.460, Speaker A: In his newsletter at the Daily Guay, Anthony Cessano of Set Protocol, ETH Hub and into the Ether broke down how he thought that if Ethereum Improvement Protocol proposal 1559 were passed, it would both improve the user experience on Ethereum as well as help ETH accrue value. First, EIP 1559 would make it less common for people to overpay miners fees while maintaining the ability to skip ahead in line by paying a tip to miners. There's also a function by which the base fee is burnt so that only the tip goes to miners. Anthony breaks down how apps are currently parasitic on Ethereum. As he puts it, quote Their on chain activity does not add fundamental value to ETH. What now happens is that the fee basically just goes back and forth between users and miners. He explains the cycle thus, quote User buys ETH, user pays fee, miner takes fee, miner may sell the fee ETH back into the market and cycle begins again.
00:29:10.460 - 00:30:24.530, Speaker A: If EIP 1559 were to be implemented, however, since the base fee would be burnt, the rewards paid out to stakers in Ethereum 20 will be less than what miners currently make. And overall, that would have a deflationary effect on Ethereum since the issuance would be smaller than what is burnt. On a related note, BlockTower Capital's re Paul tweeted that he thinks EIP 1559 is make or break for Ethereum. He said the reason was because right now the main issue for Ethereum and DeFi is to get big fast since the space is still so small. And he said, quote Growth and ETH market cap has to keep up with the growth in the market cap of tokens on Ethereum, or you incentivize a wide range of game theory attacks. Next headline 500 BTCs stolen traced to Zappo and Indodax, resulting in lawsuit A German trader named Dennis Noak sued bitcoin wallet provider Zappo and Crypto Exchange in Indonesia called Indodax after 500 BTC stolen from him, which was about 4.5 million at press time, were found to have been moved to wallets at Zappo and Indodax.
00:30:24.530 - 00:31:32.634, Speaker A: As the block puts it, quote While lawsuits arising from hacks and stolen funds are common in the crypto space, this one stands out due to the degree to which it relied on asset tracing. Firms like Chainalysis and Elliptic have developed proprietary systems for analyzing blockchain data, tracking the flow of illicit funds, and even identifying the individuals behind it, but they tend to cater mostly to exchanges and law enforcement agencies. The NOAC versus Zappo case suggests that crypto asset tracing may start making regular appearances in civil lawsets, too. All right, time for fun bits. First headline daily transaction fees on Ethereum higher than bitcoins for record 26 days. Stephen Zhang, head of research at the blog, tweeted a chart showing that Ethereum transaction fees have only surpassed bitcoins twice, and the current streak is for 26 days and counting, which is a new record. He says that since the start of the streak, the average daily fees on Ethereum have totaled $791,571, while in bitcoin they've been at $341,000 430.
00:31:32.634 - 00:31:58.814, Speaker A: Similarly, it turns out that the Ether options market has now reached the size of the bitcoin options market in December 2018. All right, thanks for tuning in.
