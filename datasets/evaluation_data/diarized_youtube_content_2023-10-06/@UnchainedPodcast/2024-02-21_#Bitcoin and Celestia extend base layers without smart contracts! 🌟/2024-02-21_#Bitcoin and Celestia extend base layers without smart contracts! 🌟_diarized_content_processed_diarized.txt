00:00:00.170 - 00:00:41.490, Speaker A: Because right now, Celestia, as I mentioned, does not have smart contracts. So right now, you cannot do a trust minimized bridge from Celestia to a roll up. Right now, you have to kind of go through an intermediary third party, like Hyperlane or Axelr. Unlike Ethereum, you can have a direct kind of bridge between Ethereum and a roll up because it has got smart contracts. There's this proposal to have these ZK smart accounts on Celestia, so you can create accounts on Celestia controlled by ZK program. And the reason why I think this is exciting is because it's very similar to bitcoin roll ups. Because right now, the bitcoin roll up that you mentioned by the chainway team does not have a trust minimized bridge with bitcoin.
00:00:41.490 - 00:00:59.130, Speaker A: It's like a sovereign roll up in bitcoin. But in the future, bitcoin will need to have a hard fork or a soft fork to add a new ZK opcode to bitcoin to allow ZK roll ups to kind of bridge to bitcoin. And Celestial is kind of like a very similar mechanism.
