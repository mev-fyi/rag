00:00:00.170 - 00:00:42.294, Speaker A: The main statistic I would give you is that the IRS itself has told us that it's expecting 8 billion reports from this proposed set of regulations themselves. So this is from the IRS commissioner's office. And that tells you something because the current entire information reporting regime, everything that's received from all, not just brokers but w two s, like all the information the IRS gets relative to taxpayers is about 5 billion today. So just for crypto alone for a nascent new industry, the IRS is expecting 8 billion. I didn't invent this number. This came from them. So I think, just think about the cost associated with building a system like that.
00:00:42.294 - 00:00:58.220, Speaker A: Essentially, it's just, as I said, it's unadministerable in its current form. I'm not suggesting that we don't have a broker reporting regime. I could think of alternatives. But in the current iteration, I think it's important that what was proposed in the 2021 statute that Shahan mentioned.
