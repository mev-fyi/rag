The securities and Exchange Commission is charging Library, a decentralized publishing platform, for allegedly selling unregistered securities. The charges stem from the library team selling tokens as investment contracts before the project was developed to raise money with the assumption that the token's value would go up. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction against Library from selling further tokens, along with a discouragement of the $11 million it received in the alleged security sale. Library CEO Jeremy Kaufman, in a statement shared with Decrypt, said quote, The SEC complaint against Library reflects an outdated view of the economy that stifles innovation, accessibility and creativity.

Recommending that Texas should lead on this like we did with a gold depository. While positive news for the industry, Long pointed out the gaping hole in the Texas crypto proposal that would create a lean mess, meaning a mess around potential liens on Bitcoin. If passed, Long recommends that Texas follow Wyoming suit and amend the bill's language to better map how, quote, Bitcoin lending actually works, so that the passage of Bitcoin receives the same blank slate as cash after each transaction, rather than lenders retaining the right to any Bitcoin issued as debt.
