00:01:15.038 - 00:01:15.442, Speaker E: Hi.
00:01:15.496 - 00:01:15.846, Speaker F: How are you?
00:01:15.868 - 00:01:16.630, Speaker E: Laura?
00:01:17.050 - 00:01:18.760, Speaker D: Great, nice to have you.
00:01:19.210 - 00:01:22.054, Speaker B: So there was some regulatory news this.
00:01:22.092 - 00:01:23.334, Speaker A: Week, but I think many of us.
00:01:23.372 - 00:01:34.490, Speaker B: Were expecting bigger enforcement actions from the SEC and or CFTC than the ones that we actually saw. So why do you think we didn't get any big enforcement actions?
00:01:35.070 - 00:01:52.158, Speaker F: Well, I don't have regulatory telepathy, so I can't see into any of those agencies. Of course, I can tell you that investigations, they take a particular what's the word that I'm looking for? They have a particular trajectory. So you start with something called a.
00:01:52.164 - 00:01:55.074, Speaker E: Matter under inquiry or a mui, where.
00:01:55.112 - 00:02:17.426, Speaker F: The SEC basically asks some questions to figure out if there's a potential violation that then moves into an investigation. An investigation can take a couple of years sometimes. We saw that, for example, in the Ripple case, where it's clear that for years before the lawsuit, the SEC was undertaking confidential, non public investigation of Ripple.
00:02:17.458 - 00:02:19.766, Speaker E: So it may be that the cases.
00:02:19.798 - 00:02:40.526, Speaker F: That the SEC may or may not be investigating, I think perhaps in the DeFi space or related to yield products, they may just be in early stage and the commission may not be ready to make decisions and to bring charges. It's also certainly possible that cases where.
00:02:40.548 - 00:02:43.326, Speaker E: There were sort of graver harms, where.
00:02:43.348 - 00:02:53.298, Speaker F: There were fraud related issues as opposed to failure to register issues took precedence. That's all speculation on my part, but those are some of the thoughts that.
00:02:53.304 - 00:02:54.420, Speaker E: I have on that.
00:02:55.430 - 00:03:13.290, Speaker B: Well, at this moment in time, certainly I think the space really is watching what's happening at the SEC. And from various statements that Chair Gensler has made, it seems he's quite eager to regulate the space. What areas do you see him or the SEC in general, particularly wanting to target?
00:03:14.030 - 00:03:20.826, Speaker E: I think that they are likely to follow the lead of or follow a.
00:03:20.848 - 00:03:30.654, Speaker F: Path that state regulators have taken. I'm speaking specifically of BlockFi and looking at yield related products. I think that's one approach. I think they're also trying to really.
00:03:30.692 - 00:03:34.366, Speaker E: Wrap their heads around and understand DFI.
00:03:34.478 - 00:04:21.070, Speaker F: And the challenge in that area is that they are in doing so, applying circa 1930s rules to technology that doesn't really neatly fit the descriptions. Things like an exchange, for example, or a security and perhaps don't actually neatly align those efforts might not neatly align with the policy, sentiment or purpose behind the enactment of those statutes in 1930, 319, 34 and 1940 post the Great Depression. But I think that's what we're going to be looking at. We're going to be looking at the SEC and other agencies evaluating new types of financial technology and figuring out if they fit within current statutory and regulatory rubrics.
00:04:21.730 - 00:04:37.526, Speaker B: Yeah, I did see an interview that former chair Chris Giancarlo did with CoinDesk where he did say he felt that there needed to be new regulations and that the old ones don't really apply here. So I actually have a few more.
00:04:37.548 - 00:04:39.542, Speaker D: Questions for you about that.
00:04:39.596 - 00:05:31.670, Speaker B: But in a moment I want to cover first the crypto lending issue because we also saw that Coinbase talked about how they had sought out permission to launch a yield product called Coinbase Lend. And the SEC said if you do, we're going to sue you. And then also in addition to BlockFi, there's also state regulators going after Celsius. And I did see that. So the coinbase lend product involved USDC the Stablecoin. And Frank Shaparo on CNBC said that there might be concern that USDC itself is a security since it's not one to one to cash, but backed by multiple assets. And I was just curious kind of what your take was on the theory around what happened with Coinbase Lend and if you had any thoughts on the USDC theory.
00:05:32.410 - 00:06:04.226, Speaker F: Well, I mean, what happened with Coinbase Lend is the founder went on rampage on Twitter, attacked the SEC, called them sketchy because they got sent a Wells letter, basically a letter saying tell us why we shouldn't sue you for violating securities laws. I don't think that Wells letter was ever made public, so we don't actually know what the full investigation was of. Those things usually come at the end of a non public investigation. So I think in the know they must have decided that they didn't want.
00:06:04.248 - 00:06:06.274, Speaker E: To spend two or three years in.
00:06:06.312 - 00:06:09.922, Speaker F: Litigation with the SEC. Maybe it wasn't in the best interest.
00:06:09.976 - 00:06:19.362, Speaker E: Of the company's shareholders and so they dropped it. I have heard talk of certain Stablecoins.
00:06:19.506 - 00:06:31.398, Speaker F: So stablecoins that are not fully reserved and there are some that are fully reserved with dollars in bank accounts. I have heard talk that some of those things may be under close scrutiny.
00:06:31.494 - 00:06:36.234, Speaker E: By the SEC as securities and I.
00:06:36.272 - 00:06:37.882, Speaker F: Wouldn'T be surprised if we saw some.
00:06:37.936 - 00:06:39.450, Speaker E: Activity in that space.
00:06:39.520 - 00:06:41.534, Speaker F: I think that's actually quite good news.
00:06:41.732 - 00:06:47.710, Speaker E: For stablecoins that are fully backed and that are transparent about their backing.
00:06:48.770 - 00:07:05.140, Speaker B: Okay, so maybe Frank's theory is a good one and so that could be quite interesting to watch play out because obviously those businesses are doing that for their own business models to make that something that is worth them spending time on.
00:07:06.570 - 00:07:10.178, Speaker E: I think in fairness to, I don't.
00:07:10.194 - 00:07:11.478, Speaker F: Want to say necessarily in fairness to.
00:07:11.484 - 00:07:15.030, Speaker E: The SEC, but I think some products.
00:07:15.100 - 00:07:18.802, Speaker F: That exist are easy to fit into an existing rubric.
00:07:18.866 - 00:07:32.234, Speaker E: So a stablecoin that is not fully backed, that has an unclear backing might be something that we can understand why there might be scrutiny of that and.
00:07:32.272 - 00:07:45.742, Speaker F: Why that might in the views of state or federal regulators, be a security same as so perhaps of certain yield products. I think the problem is when you get into more esoteric areas, more decentralized.
00:07:45.806 - 00:07:47.906, Speaker E: Products, when you move away from the.
00:07:47.928 - 00:08:21.962, Speaker F: Blockfis and the celsius and the Coinbases to fully decentralized protocols where you don't have a centralized order book. Or you have matching by an algorithm those areas. Perhaps some of the older securities regulations and laws don't make the same kind of sense. The technology is different. I don't know if I agree with Giancarlo that that means we need more regulation. Maybe, and call me crazy, maybe we need less regulation in certain areas, or maybe we can rely on existing laws about fraud or misrepresentation.
00:08:22.026 - 00:08:24.494, Speaker E: Maybe there are things that don't and.
00:08:24.532 - 00:08:35.280, Speaker F: Should not fall within the rubric or within the scope of traditional securities and commodities regulators because they're really not those things.
00:08:36.850 - 00:08:38.878, Speaker E: That's sort of my thinking on that.
00:08:39.044 - 00:08:44.320, Speaker B: And I'm sorry, when you say that you mean for the decentralized versions or for even the centralized ones?
00:08:45.050 - 00:08:50.994, Speaker F: I'm less skeptical of regulation of centralized.
00:08:51.042 - 00:08:54.918, Speaker E: Platforms using existing rules because they do.
00:08:55.004 - 00:08:57.358, Speaker F: Maintain things like centralized order books.
00:08:57.474 - 00:09:01.306, Speaker E: They are doing things like aggregating customer.
00:09:01.408 - 00:09:22.954, Speaker F: Capital, reinvesting it somewhere else, making money on the spread between their investment return and what the consumer gets. Maybe that's fair game. I would say decentralized protocols where there is not a centralized company, you don't have a public company, you don't have a centralized order book, you're using an automatic market maker algorithm, you're using liquidity pools.
00:09:23.002 - 00:09:25.182, Speaker E: I'm perhaps a little bit more skeptical.
00:09:25.246 - 00:09:29.874, Speaker F: About the application of conventional existing securities laws to those things.
00:09:29.912 - 00:09:31.714, Speaker E: I'm just not sure that not only.
00:09:31.752 - 00:09:40.966, Speaker F: Do they not fit those statutory and regulatory frameworks, I'm not sure if you went back to Congress in 1932 and described this stuff that they would feel.
00:09:40.988 - 00:09:43.990, Speaker E: That it was really within their ambit.
00:09:44.330 - 00:10:00.460, Speaker F: So I'm skeptical of extending securities or commodities regulators power to regulate purely peer to peer transactions that are facilitated using.
00:10:01.330 - 00:10:03.630, Speaker E: Algorithms that exist on the blockchain.
00:10:04.210 - 00:10:07.230, Speaker F: Why should that be within Gary Gensler's scope?
00:10:07.810 - 00:10:23.300, Speaker B: Okay, well, he did write a letter to Senator Elizabeth Warren basically saying that he probably does need more regulatory power to go after such things, but I'm going to ask you about that in a second. But first a quick word from the sponsors who make the show possible.

00:11:32.190 - 00:11:44.158, Speaker B: Back to my conversation with Stephen Palley. So speaking about what jurisdiction the SEC really does have here, as we mentioned, Chair Gensler did kind of request more power.
00:11:44.324 - 00:11:47.230, Speaker D: And I just wondered, do you think.
00:11:47.300 - 00:11:49.166, Speaker B: At this moment the SEC does have.
00:11:49.188 - 00:11:50.398, Speaker A: All the power it would like to.
00:11:50.404 - 00:11:53.314, Speaker D: Have to regulate the space or no.
00:11:53.512 - 00:11:57.298, Speaker E: He wants much broader power, so I.
00:11:57.304 - 00:12:04.900, Speaker F: Don'T think he feels that the SEC necessarily has the power that it needs to regulate DeFi, for example.
00:12:05.930 - 00:12:14.230, Speaker E: But I'm not sure why software creators, people who are making platforms that allow.
00:12:14.300 - 00:12:22.010, Speaker F: Individuals to transact with each other on a one to one basis using software I'm not sure why the SEC should be involved in that.
00:12:22.080 - 00:12:30.258, Speaker E: And it is galling I think to many to see very wealthy former Goldman.
00:12:30.374 - 00:12:45.730, Speaker F: Sachs banker sending letters to a very wealthy senator talking about consumer protection when that consumer protection recently prevented US persons from being part of a major AirDrop basically free money.
00:12:45.880 - 00:12:51.726, Speaker E: So I am all for regulators, countering and battling fraud.
00:12:51.838 - 00:13:01.286, Speaker F: I'm all for companies that are centralized or platforms that operate order books. Being within the scope and ambit of.
00:13:01.308 - 00:13:04.630, Speaker E: Those circa 1930s laws, I think it's.
00:13:05.210 - 00:13:08.982, Speaker F: Questionable whether they should apply to decentralized.
00:13:09.046 - 00:13:12.550, Speaker E: Finance when it truly is decentralized.
00:13:12.710 - 00:13:29.230, Speaker F: And I think that it's actually contrary to the consumer protection purpose that was behind these protocols to prevent consumers from transacting on a peer to peer basis, using liquidity pools, using algorithms.
00:13:29.810 - 00:13:33.294, Speaker E: Perhaps it's crazy, but perhaps there are.
00:13:33.332 - 00:13:43.006, Speaker F: Parts of our financial world that we don't need regulators to be involved in. And that's all the more so when you're using platforms that have where transactions.
00:13:43.038 - 00:13:44.834, Speaker E: Can be seen on the blockchain and.
00:13:44.872 - 00:13:54.280, Speaker F: Where code is available on GitHub, which is certainly not true, for I won't name them, but any of the large banks or financial institutions in this country.
00:13:55.850 - 00:14:02.074, Speaker B: So I just want to give some context to listeners. Because as I'm listening to you speak about this, what's remarkable to me is.
00:14:02.112 - 00:14:05.546, Speaker D: That you're sort of kind of, I.
00:14:05.568 - 00:14:32.926, Speaker B: Would say one of the lawyers who were more skeptical or in the past have been more skeptical of things like ICOs and of Tokens that different projects wanted to launch. And when I say that, they were saying that they wanted them to be decentralized. And so I'm just curious to know kind of what is different for you between those projects in the past that you were skeptical of during the ICO Craze versus the DeFi space now, I'm.
00:14:32.958 - 00:14:37.814, Speaker F: Still not a fan of centralized ICOs token sales, right? And if you want to do something.
00:14:37.852 - 00:14:43.190, Speaker E: Like that, you need to comply with existing securities laws.
00:14:43.610 - 00:15:15.538, Speaker F: I'm also not suggesting that anyone should break the law. My arguments are more directed towards policy, and they're more sort of a normative evaluation of policy and what the law should be than what the law actually is. And I was around practicing in 2016 and 17, and I did live through the ICO Craze, and most of those projects were about self enrichment of a small group of people. I don't think that that is what the significant DeFi platforms or protocols are about.
00:15:15.704 - 00:15:20.180, Speaker E: So I'm not opposed to innovation, right.
00:15:21.350 - 00:15:26.162, Speaker F: In and of itself when it's useful. And I can see that our securities.
00:15:26.226 - 00:15:29.666, Speaker E: Laws and our commodities laws maybe don't.
00:15:29.698 - 00:15:33.030, Speaker F: Need to be stretched further than they already are. They work just fine.
00:15:33.180 - 00:15:38.018, Speaker E: In responding to ICOs, you could make.
00:15:38.044 - 00:15:44.134, Speaker F: The argument that in some cases, enforcement actions may have hurt consumers, hurt purchasers.
00:15:44.182 - 00:15:47.546, Speaker E: I know well, anyone who knows me.
00:15:47.568 - 00:16:03.386, Speaker F: Or seen me write about this on Twitter elsewhere. I'm not necessarily a fan of Ripple or of XRP. I think that is a project that for the most part benefited a small group, which is why there are control person claims or individuals were named in that lawsuit.
00:16:03.418 - 00:16:05.106, Speaker E: However, there is a point to be.
00:16:05.128 - 00:16:06.466, Speaker F: Made that if you shut something like.
00:16:06.488 - 00:16:16.802, Speaker E: That down for a failure to register claim, you will hurt individual consumers. And if the purpose is to prevent.
00:16:16.946 - 00:16:25.510, Speaker F: People in the market from being hurt, I think that you have to balance that against the purported harm or violation.
00:16:27.050 - 00:16:36.006, Speaker B: Okay, so going back to the, you know, as we've been discussing, it's quite apparent that SEC is eager to regulate.
00:16:36.038 - 00:16:38.794, Speaker D: The space in a way that is.
00:16:38.832 - 00:16:48.910, Speaker B: Kind of more similar to the way the traditional financial world is in that it wants to go after intermediaries. And obviously DeFi protocols are trying to replace intermediaries with software.
00:16:49.570 - 00:16:51.918, Speaker D: But I'm sure you're aware a lot.
00:16:51.924 - 00:16:58.434, Speaker B: Of people on the outside look at DeFi and say, oh, these developers just want to avoid regulation, and that's why they're doing this.
00:16:58.472 - 00:17:00.594, Speaker D: So what's your take on that.
00:17:00.792 - 00:17:02.914, Speaker F: If you have regulation that applies to.
00:17:02.952 - 00:17:10.566, Speaker E: Intermediaries and that exists in order to regulate intermediaries, if you can create a.
00:17:10.588 - 00:17:18.206, Speaker F: System that doesn't require intermediaries, why should you still need that regulation? Now there are certainly people in DeFi.
00:17:18.338 - 00:17:21.866, Speaker E: Who are out to get rich and.
00:17:21.888 - 00:17:25.658, Speaker F: Are only in it for the money. But if you look at something like.
00:17:25.744 - 00:17:31.978, Speaker E: If you look at an automatic market maker function when it is and I'm.
00:17:31.984 - 00:17:58.450, Speaker F: Not going to name any I'm not going to call it any projects by name, but that functionality those algorithms are very, very different than the sort of centralized order book or order matching that you had, for example, in the Ether Delta case, which you probably recall from a couple of years ago, which was supposedly a decentralized exchange, but it really was. I think if something is different, it should be treated.
00:18:01.510 - 00:18:17.420, Speaker B: Mean. What we can name, I think different examples here because for a lot of these places, the companies that built the protocol then also did build a front. So, you know, in that sense, do you think they truly still are?
00:18:20.030 - 00:18:26.030, Speaker F: It's a that's an argument that I think the SEC is going to contend with, and there are certainly some companies.
00:18:26.100 - 00:18:27.646, Speaker E: That have done that, but there are.
00:18:27.668 - 00:18:48.440, Speaker F: Also groups of decentralized developers who are loosely organized who have done this and it is possible to exit. Here's another way to think about it. I don't think that anybody would argue that a protocol in and of itself on the blockchain is an exchange, right?
00:18:48.810 - 00:18:51.222, Speaker E: It doesn't fit by its terms within.
00:18:51.276 - 00:19:01.126, Speaker F: The definition of an exchange in the exchange act. It's not a marketplace. It's not a location where people come together to trade.
00:19:01.318 - 00:19:05.354, Speaker E: But let's step, one step away.
00:19:05.472 - 00:19:12.526, Speaker F: You can use something like Etherscan to interact with those protocols. I don't think there's any argument that.
00:19:12.548 - 00:19:14.910, Speaker E: Etherscan is an exchange.
00:19:15.570 - 00:19:19.726, Speaker F: These protocols are also available. Anybody can build a front end.
00:19:19.748 - 00:19:21.566, Speaker E: So I guess the question is, if.
00:19:21.588 - 00:19:52.486, Speaker F: You have a front end that simply provides functionality and allows access to what is truly a decentralized protocol that no single person has control over, how is that an exchange? Is a website really an exchange? Is that really what Congress meant in 1934? I'm on the fence about that. I can see. But I think there's a strong argument that it is not. And we need to come to terms with the fact that technology is different. And with different technology we need different rules.
00:19:52.598 - 00:19:56.534, Speaker E: I'm fully in favor of anti fraud.
00:19:56.662 - 00:20:08.602, Speaker F: Power and enforcement actions that target fraud. I've come around to Commissioner Hester purse's safe harbor. I think if you have a disclosure.
00:20:08.666 - 00:20:12.826, Speaker E: Regime and the commission has strong anti.
00:20:12.858 - 00:20:21.540, Speaker F: Fraud enforcement authority, maybe that gets you where you need to go without imposing a regulatory regime on technology that doesn't fit it.
00:20:22.870 - 00:20:23.620, Speaker D: Okay.
00:20:24.390 - 00:20:40.838, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean it sounds like obviously the fraud piece I think is necessary, but maybe there needs to be, I guess, like some definition or some bar that projects need to clear in order to be thought of as decentralized and.
00:20:40.844 - 00:20:42.730, Speaker D: That would kind of yeah.
00:20:42.800 - 00:20:44.826, Speaker B: Okay, so we're going to have to see what happens with that.
00:20:44.848 - 00:20:46.234, Speaker A: But last question for you.
00:20:46.352 - 00:20:57.518, Speaker B: How would you say the SEC's stance is affecting how developers are working in the space? Do you see them leaving the US or are they just trying to develop their projects here in a certain way.
00:20:57.604 - 00:21:00.046, Speaker D: Or I don't know what else?
00:21:00.148 - 00:21:01.406, Speaker F: That's a really great question.
00:21:01.508 - 00:21:04.050, Speaker E: I mean, I think you will see.
00:21:04.120 - 00:21:12.686, Speaker F: People leaving the US or going satoshi right, basically being totally anonymous. This is kind of funny, but I've.
00:21:12.718 - 00:21:19.720, Speaker E: Had potential clients recently in the space reach out to me and they don't want to give me their name.
00:21:20.250 - 00:21:23.682, Speaker F: Nobody else knows their name and it's problematic.
00:21:23.746 - 00:21:26.198, Speaker E: Like basically my response is, listen, in.
00:21:26.204 - 00:21:27.718, Speaker F: Order to represent you, I do have.
00:21:27.724 - 00:21:28.614, Speaker E: To know your name.
00:21:28.732 - 00:21:30.106, Speaker F: I'm going to need an address and.
00:21:30.128 - 00:21:31.900, Speaker E: A phone number, and.
00:21:34.270 - 00:21:39.110, Speaker F: I can't disclose that I'd lose my law license if I did that. But I think there is a genuine.
00:21:39.190 - 00:21:43.294, Speaker E: Interest in full decentralization and there are.
00:21:43.332 - 00:21:45.454, Speaker F: Some pie in the sky idealists out.
00:21:45.492 - 00:21:48.638, Speaker E: There who really believe in sort of.
00:21:48.644 - 00:22:01.380, Speaker F: An ethos of financial freedom and full decentralization. There are also people out there who are in it for the money. But I do think to answer your question a little bit more neatly, you're definitely seeing people thinking about leaving the US.
00:22:01.830 - 00:22:07.106, Speaker E: Or also you're seeing projects GoIP block.
00:22:07.138 - 00:22:11.106, Speaker F: The US and block VPN, including some DeFi projects.
00:22:11.138 - 00:22:13.494, Speaker E: I understand that one inch has done that.
00:22:13.532 - 00:22:21.514, Speaker F: I believe that dYdX GoIP blocked the US from its AirDrop. So we'll see Americans losing out on.
00:22:21.552 - 00:22:24.858, Speaker E: Opportunities and I just don't know that.
00:22:25.024 - 00:22:26.380, Speaker F: It'S really the place.
00:22:26.910 - 00:22:35.454, Speaker E: Know, no offense to Congress, but octogenarians in Congress stifling innovation by imposing the.
00:22:35.492 - 00:23:00.470, Speaker F: Wrong rules on new technology. There should be rules of the road, for sure, but the life of the law is not logic, it's experience. As a jurist said 120 or 130 years ago, that should be the case here too. And we should take the experience of DFI and of emerging technology, look at it for what it is, and determine whether or not our existing regs actually work or if this is something that needs space to grow and breathe.
00:23:01.610 - 00:23:04.102, Speaker A: Okay, well, we will have to see.
00:23:04.156 - 00:23:05.382, Speaker C: How all this plays out.
