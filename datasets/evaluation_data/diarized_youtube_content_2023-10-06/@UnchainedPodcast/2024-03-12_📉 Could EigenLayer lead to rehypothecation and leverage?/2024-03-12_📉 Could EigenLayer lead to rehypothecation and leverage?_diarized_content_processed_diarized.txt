00:00:00.170 - 00:00:58.620, Speaker A: Know, Laura, you were asking me earlier like what do you think about people, you know, expecting this to be like a new defi yield? And, you know, is there any Ponzi nature to it? Eigenve is designed to have zero principal risk. If you actually staked and the operators ran correctly, you don't take any principal risk. But the way our space is, somebody figures out how to take principle, we're actually going and taking leverage outside the protocol and going and doing this thing. This can be very dangerous. This is a very risky thing to do because there's all sorts of reasons why like a liquid restaked ETH will not be worth one ETH in the short term, even if it becomes equal to one ETH in the long term. There is liquidity crunches. There is, let's say there is a hack somewhere in their code which they can even have an upgrade console and upgrade, but who knows? That takes a week and within that.
