00:00:45.790 - 00:00:57.070, Speaker B: Today's guest is Camilla Russo, author of The Infinite machine how an army of crypto hackers is building the next Internet with Ethereum and founder of the Defiant. Welcome, Camilla.
00:00:57.490 - 00:01:00.880, Speaker A: Hi, Laura. Thanks so much for having me. Excited to be here.
00:01:01.250 - 00:01:07.010, Speaker B: I just want to say, first of all, congrats on the publication of your book. That must be so exciting.
00:01:07.430 - 00:01:12.660, Speaker A: It is. I'm so happy with it, so happy with all the feedback. It's been amazing.
00:01:13.110 - 00:01:21.320, Speaker B: So let's start with your background. You've done so much in crypto, but I don't know if people really know how you got started. So how did you come to be covering this space?
00:01:22.330 - 00:02:06.274, Speaker A: Sure. Well, before being full time crypto with The Defiant and The Infinite Machine, I was a reporter at Bloomberg News for around eight years. I started in an internship in New York, then I went to Argentina for over four years in Madrid and then back to New York. And in Argentina. I was there in Christina Fernandez's second term, and at that time, she imposed really harsh currency controls, and inflation, as always in Argentina, was in the double digits. And so I was covering Argentine markets and how people were protecting against inflation and currency controls. And that's how I came across Bitcoin for the first time in 2013.
00:02:06.274 - 00:03:05.874, Speaker A: So I wrote a story for Bloomberg on how Argentines were using this digital currency to protect against inflation. And after that, I was always really interested in crypto. To me, it was like a really powerful concept, this idea of having a parallel and independent financial and monetary system that especially after living in Argentina and living through all that, it made a lot of sense to me. So I always kind of kept track of it. But then it was back in New York in 2017 when I started really covering it again and focusing more on it. So at this time, I was at Bloomberg's Markets live blog, which is kind of a live feed of market analysis, and I mostly covered emerging markets, but I had the freedom to write whatever looked interesting. And 2017 was obviously huge for crypto.
00:03:05.874 - 00:03:34.318, Speaker A: So I started writing about crypto and then started writing for The General Wire, because Bloomberg didn't have dedicated cryptocurrency reporters or a dedicated crypto team. So I became kind of the de facto crypto reporter at the time, and that kind of dragged me into space. I had a front row view of the huge bubble of 2017, and I just was fascinated by it and kind of never left after that.
00:03:34.484 - 00:03:53.240, Speaker B: And earlier, when you said that having lived through the currency controls in Argentina, that that was part of the reason that you got fascinated with Bitcoin, what was it like living through that? What did you experience, and why was it that you felt that Bitcoin was related to what was happening then?
00:03:53.690 - 00:04:52.790, Speaker A: It was really interesting to be living through that because I'm Chilean, and in Chile, the situation was very different. Chile is a much more conservative country, like fiscally, and in its monetary policy, nothing ever happens there. The Chilean peso is pretty stable. So coming to Argentina, where there were all these stimulus and money printing and just very populist policies with the Kirchners and just living through currency controls firsthand, because I was earning in Argentine pesos, like Bloomberg paid journalists there in their local currency. They do that in every local bureau. You get paid in, obviously, the country's currency. So I got paid in Argentine pesos.
00:04:52.790 - 00:05:40.762, Speaker A: And when I first got to Argentina, the first thing I was told was, as soon as you get your salary, change it to dollars because of the huge inflation. So what happens with inflation in practice is that you get, say, 100 Argentine pesos in January, and that lets you buy a certain amount of stuff, but then at the end of the year, you can buy much less with the same 100 pesos. So effectively, you become poorer by holding your local currency. So that's why people in Argentina and countries with really high inflation are always seeking a more stable currency, and that's usually US. Dollars. So that's what I was doing. As soon as I got my salary in pesos, I exchanged it to dollars.
00:05:40.762 - 00:06:27.410, Speaker A: And then one day, I think it was just a couple of days after Christina Fernandez got reelected, I was at the Bloomberg office kind of covering this announcement where she know, now US. Dollar purchases are prohibited. And I was like, okay, I covered it. But then I went to my bank account to see if actually I wasn't able to trade pesos for dollars anymore. And that option was just gone from my bank. So I really kind of lived that. And then I was stuck with Argentine pesos and having to go to the black market and the US dollar black market in Argentina, it's illegal, but it's like everyone does it.
00:06:27.410 - 00:07:17.750, Speaker A: Everyone is using it, and it's just crazy. So people were doing all these schemes to try to get access to dollars. They would go overnight to Uruguay, to Punta Elese, and cash casino chips for dollars and do all this crazy stuff, including Bitcoin. Just seeing how frustrating it is to have a government dictate what you can and can't do with your own money and banks prohibiting and enforcing those laws and regulations. It was just amazing to me. It just didn't make any sense. It was like, this is my money.
00:07:17.750 - 00:07:46.814, Speaker A: I earned it. Why are they telling me I can't buy dollars with it? Especially because the reason why the peso is being devalued is their fault. So why do I have to pay for that? Right? It just felt like, so insane. And so, yeah, the ability to have a hedge against crazy governments and irresponsible policies was just groundbreaking. And, yeah, I think that's what Bitcoin enables.
00:07:46.942 - 00:08:14.246, Speaker B: But something that's so fascinating to me is that I obviously can see how your experience in Argentina would get you interested in Bitcoin. And I've seen this pretty much the same story happen with people like Juances Casares and Michael Casey who lived in Argentina. It just feels know, Mariana Conti, everybody who has experience with Argentina somehow finds their way to the crypto space. But why do you think that you instead ended up focusing on Ethereum rather than Bitcoin?
00:08:14.438 - 00:09:26.818, Speaker A: Yeah, so I think the reason is a practical one as well as not ideological one, but one that's focused on Ethereum itself. So the practical reason was that end of 2017, I thought, what happened this year is crazy and it needs to be documented. This is an incredible space. And I had always wanted to write a book, a nonfiction book, so I was on the lookout for what interesting stories I could tell. And so crypto was to me, like that opportunity to tell an interesting story in a book. And so I just started thinking, what's the most interesting story in crypto that hasn't been told? And the story of Bitcoin had been told before? Really well, I thought, with Digital Gold and other books, and it was just more widely known, but Ethereum people didn't really know much about it beyond it's a platform for ICOs. There was no history of Ethereum, which was crazy.
00:09:26.818 - 00:10:31.842, Speaker A: It was the second biggest cryptocurrency. It fueled much of the craziness of 2017, yet nobody knew much about it and how it got created and started. So that's the reason I started looking at writing a book on Ethereum. And then after my kind of initial research, I realized it is really a book worthy project, because while Bitcoin tries to do peer to peer money, ethereum wants to do peer to peer everything, like go beyond just the peer to peer transfer of money with smart contracts. So to me, it was whether Ethereum meant out winning or succeeding in its goal of becoming the world computer, it still won in the sense that it was the first to try this, to push blockchain technology forward. And so I thought that was a story worth telling.
00:10:31.986 - 00:10:38.570, Speaker B: And at some point, you also left Bloomberg. When was that, and why did you decide to leave Bloomberg?
00:10:39.070 - 00:11:24.760, Speaker A: So I left Bloomberg January 2019. And I left in part because I really wanted to focus on finishing my book. So Bloomberg gave me a few months of book leave and that was amazing and I'm really grateful to them. But then Beginning of 2019 was when I had to go back to Bloomberg and do my full time reporting job and I still hadn't finished writing the book. And so I just couldn't see how I would be able to do both well. And I didn't want to delay publishing my book. So that was like one side of the decision and then the other side was know, I was there for eight years.
00:11:24.760 - 00:12:03.086, Speaker A: I covered so many different markets. I was at three or four different Bloomberg offices if you count like some time. I was also in the Chile office. So I had a lot of experience covering financial news for Bloomberg and I just thought it's time to do something else. I was excited to freelance, to maybe start something on my own. I left without a clear idea of what I would do after finishing the book, but I knew I wanted a little bit more freedom to explore other things after all that time at Bloomberg.
00:12:03.278 - 00:12:10.200, Speaker B: And so you did start talking a little bit about your book, but why don't we just dive into the particulars? What is your book about?
00:12:10.970 - 00:13:07.838, Speaker A: So, yeah, my book is it focuses on the history of Ethereum, especially the early days. So how Vitalik came up with the idea of Ethereum, how he inspired a group of very diverse characters from different walks of life to follow him in this journey of building this new platform, the challenges they faced, how they overcame them, and then the 2017 boom and bust in 2018. And then also I come to pretty much a present day kind of hinting about the future of Ethereum with DFI and Web Three. But really the focus is on the early days and how Ethereum got started and launched.
00:13:07.954 - 00:13:12.140, Speaker B: And so what would you say were the most pivotal moments in Ethereum's history?
00:13:13.070 - 00:14:35.890, Speaker A: First, at the beginning of Ethereum history, there was this tension on whether on the very kind of soul of Ethereum, whether it should be a for profit company or a nonprofit foundation fueling development of this open public blockchain. And so I think the moment, the decision to make it a nonprofit foundation obviously really defined Ethereum going forward. So that was definitely a pivotal moment. Another key moment, I think, was the presale ICO pre mine, however you want to call it, the decision to structure the distribution of Ether in this way with a presale instead of just by the proof of work mining like bitcoin. So Ethereum has been really criticized for this. After that, it's always had this kind of sort of democlease hanging over its head with regulators on whether this was actual illegal, this was a securities offering or not. That was always in doubt until recently.
00:14:35.890 - 00:15:22.094, Speaker A: So I think that was another kind of big moment for it. Like that decision to do Ether distribution that way and also deciding to do it in the US. And that took a huge amount of time with lawyers to decide all the specifics of the sale. Also big, but I think less known, is the Shanghai attacks. So Ethereum went through kind of this phase of huge tests to it. And one was the Shanghai attacks when it was receiving these Denial of Service attacks and spam from hackers for an entire month. And then right after that came the Dow hack.
00:15:22.094 - 00:15:43.420, Speaker A: So it was like a really intense period of huge tests to the network. So I think these two kind of attacks were pivotal moments as well. And yeah, it kind of made Ethereum feel, I think, kind of more war.
00:15:43.870 - 00:15:53.710, Speaker B: Tested after they and just it was reversed that the Dow happened first and then the DDoS attacks were shortly.
00:15:55.330 - 00:15:56.080, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:15:56.850 - 00:16:03.940, Speaker B: As we approach the five year anniversary of the Ethereum network being live, how would you characterize where Ethereum is now?
00:16:05.830 - 00:17:04.500, Speaker A: It's been incredible to see the progress of Ethereum since when I first started writing the book until now. So when I first started writing, like I mentioned, it was like the main thing were ICOs and enabling this fundraising mechanism. But now it's really enabling this more complex and sophisticated financial system that goes beyond just fundraising and into lending, borrowing, exchanging and use cases that we never would have imagined on Ethereum. The birth of this new financial system is kind of proving that Ethereum is doing what it set out to do to be this layer for an unlimited number of applications built on top of it.
00:17:05.110 - 00:17:24.150, Speaker B: At this point, everybody's waiting for the launch of phase zero of Ethereum 2.0 and there was some chatter recently about the fact that that might be delayed until 2021 rather than coming out later this year. Do you see any risks to Ethereum due to these delays?
00:17:24.310 - 00:18:15.366, Speaker A: Risks? I don't think so, because Ethereum has been waiting for proof of stake and E two since forever. It's basically been the thing that they've been working towards since, I think, 2016 or so. Proof of stake is coming and it's been able to continue going forward even with all these delays. And I think now it's at a stronger place than ever to keep surviving even without East Two. Layer two solutions are in a really good place. Like, they're actually working. There's actual DEXes using zero knowledge proofs and optimistic roll ups.
00:18:15.366 - 00:19:30.846, Speaker A: And OMG Network launched recently with its plasma chain. So layer two scaling is actually a reality and I think that will really help bridge that gap between ETH One and ETH Two. So for that reason and also for the fact that right now the way that users are using Ethereum, it's been more of like whales using these financial platforms to transact. And so far it hasn't required that much scaling. I mean, it has put ethereum to the test with gas prices rising and the network occasionally being clogged up. But it's not as bad as CryptoKitties and thousands of people just piling on or even as crazy as the ICO days. I think it's like a much more measured use case of not like so many people using it at once, but it's a more sustainable way of transacting.
00:19:30.846 - 00:20:14.500, Speaker A: So between those things, I think Ethereum is in good shape to continue working well until E Two comes. So we'll see. I'm not sure whether proof of stake will launch this year or next year, but yeah, there has been some. Vitalik is really kind of pushing for a launch this year, and other prominent developers are too, so we'll see what happens. But I think it's a good sign that they're focused on having it done well instead of just pushing out something that's not ready.
00:20:15.110 - 00:20:31.510, Speaker B: Are you watching any of these other competing layer one protocols that used to be dubbed Ethereum Killers, but people haven't been using that term so much anymore. And do you think any of them have a chance of taking any market share from Ethereum?
00:20:32.330 - 00:21:36.358, Speaker A: Possibly, yes. It's hard to say. I think so far we can comment on what's happened and so far it's been really hard to compete with Ethereum. I think Ethereum has a really great advantage of a first mover advantage with a huge community there's, I don't know, like thousands of developers building on Ethereum. I think there's reports saying that there are even more Ethereum developers and bitcoin developers and just the level of connectivity between Ethereum applications will be really hard to replicate because of this composability of DeFi and other applications that they all start working with each other. It makes it harder for a single application to move to another chain and just be there by itself. So there's kind of these network effects, the communities there, builders are there, users are there, so it's been really hard to compete.
00:21:36.358 - 00:22:05.060, Speaker A: But that's not to say that if any of these new chains launches and it's just like many times better than Ethereum technically, and if Two keeps being delayed and maybe layer two solutions aren't fixing it, aren't fixing scaling as people hope, then yeah, I mean, they very, very well could start taking market share. We'll see.
00:22:05.370 - 00:22:10.950, Speaker B: And other than that, are there any other obstacles that you think Ethereum faces?
00:22:11.370 - 00:23:17.878, Speaker A: I think regulation is always a risk, especially if Ethereum's main focus is finance. Regulators are always going to be watching that closely. I think they haven't yet because DeFi is still pretty small, but with 2 billion now, it's not nothing. I think what kind of protects it a little bit is that so far it's really been crypto whales playing in these platforms, so you're not seeing kind of inexperienced retail users getting burned. But if we have some sort of like ICO boom type of frenzy where retail traders come to DeFi like to yield farm and they are paying $100 of gas fees and getting wrecked with their leveraged loans. You could see kind of regulators raising their eyebrows and taking a closer look at this. So I think that's one risk.
00:23:17.878 - 00:23:59.334, Speaker A: I think what happened with ICOs and what's happened in general with theorem and blockchain technology is that at least in the US. Regulators realize that they have taken this kind of soft touch to allow innovation to flourish. Because I don't think they want to stamp out this industry and have everyone go somewhere else. And I don't know, maybe China having be the center of blockchain innovation. So I think what will likely happen is that there will be regulators looking closer at the space.
00:23:59.532 - 00:24:35.720, Speaker B: One thing that interests me is when you said that the regulators have been having a light touch. There was a moment, I'm just trying to remember when this was, I think it was about a year ago, where I feel like the frustration from US entrepreneurs with the regulators was sort of at a peak. And do you feel like that's changed? Because I think at that time that's when a lot of entrepreneurs were saying, oh yeah, people are leaving to go to other jurisdictions. So do you think just that they were overreacting or do you think that things have calmed down since then?
00:24:36.330 - 00:25:52.638, Speaker A: Yeah, I think the peak kind of concern with regulators, I think came with think, you know, people were moving to other jurisdictions because US regulators really took a stance there that tokens can be securities and these sales are probably securities, illegal securities offerings. I think they were rightly kind of concerned the developers in this space. But I think that subsided now first because ICOs aren't being done in the same way anymore. I think the space has matured and realized that the way fundraising was happening in Ethereum wasn't really healthy. I don't think the incentives were placed in the right way, like giving a team of entrepreneurs millions of dollars write off just based off a white paper and website and expecting them to deliver everything they promised after you already gave them all your money. That didn't really turn out very well in many cases. In others they did.
00:25:52.638 - 00:26:22.838, Speaker A: And we have really good teams who raised money in the ICO days, like building right now, and some of the top DeFi projects raised money in the ICO days, but many, many others didn't and just didn't do anything and ran off with the money. So I think the crypto space has really learned from that and matured and is seeking other, more responsible ways to fundraise. And I think that's helping with regulators as well.
00:26:23.004 - 00:26:35.020, Speaker B: And so when you look back at all the history that you uncovered for your book, and you look at how far Ethereum has come, what's most surprising to you about the Ethereum story?
00:26:35.870 - 00:27:39.690, Speaker A: There were many surprising things. Okay, so one thing that was surprising was kind of this clash of the for profit nonprofit. The other surprising thing to find out was just that right now, Vitalik is the only one of the initial co founders who is still building for Ethereum, and everyone has gone off to do their own other blockchain things or non blockchain things. So that was also surprising, I think. Like I said too, watching this new kind of financial applications ecosystem thrive right now in Ethereum, after the bear market, when everyone thought Ethereum was dead, has been a really nice surprise as well. Yeah, I guess those have been like the biggest surprises.
00:27:39.850 - 00:27:48.900, Speaker B: All right, so in a moment we will talk about The Defiant, DeFi and crypto media. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible.

00:29:05.630 - 00:29:13.358, Speaker B: Back to my conversation with Camilla Russo of the Defiant. So tell us about the Defiant. What is it and what do you cover there?
00:29:13.524 - 00:31:00.510, Speaker A: Yeah, so The Defiant is a well, it started out as a newsletter, which I founded in June of last year, so it has a little bit over a year. And I started this newsletter because, like I said, I was watching this incredible financial ecosystem being built on Ethereum, and I really thought it wasn't being covered at all, or at least very well, even by crypto media, and much less by mainstream media. There were hardly even any newsletters focusing on DeFi at the time when I started The Defiance. So I really saw this incredible amount of innovation, growth, activity happening in the space, and to me it was these developers are delivering kind of the dream of crypto, like the Cipherpunk dream of being your own bank and having your parallel financial system and they're actually building it and it's working and nobody's paying attention. So to me, it was an opportunity to come in and after researching and learning about Ethereum for my book and also having covered markets for years at Bloomberg, I thought it's a good space for me to come and cover. And I was just like fascinated by it. So I started this newsletter and at first I thought, let me try to do it daily because I think that kind of helps build an audience that consistency, but without really knowing whether I'd have enough material or what would happen.
00:31:00.510 - 00:32:02.814, Speaker A: But I started it and yeah, there was so much going on that I never was lacking material to write a daily newsletter. And it grew really quickly. I had really good response to it. People really were needing this information source for DeFi, it's kind of evolved into more of a I want to make it into a media company for the open economy beyond just a newsletter. So I recently launched a podcast as well, looking to start a YouTube channel soon. And I'm building kind of the Defiant website to host all these things in one place. So, yeah, that's my idea with The Defiant to build it into a trustworthy content platform for decentralized finance.
00:32:02.814 - 00:32:59.582, Speaker A: And I think kind of the difference with other newsletters and people covering the space is that I really do want to bring my journalistic perspective to it. So I'm covering the space from the perspective and with the expertise of a journalist. And I do have contributors who are also writing for The Defiant now, and I edit their pieces always with that in mind. I'm obviously super bullish in this space and my bias will be towards this is amazing, but always keeping the objectivism and the standards that I had at Bloomberg, I'm not going to stop reporting the bad things that happened, the scams, the hacks. And I think that's especially important in such a nascent. Yeah.
00:32:59.736 - 00:33:08.042, Speaker B: And how would you compare doing financial coverage at Bloomberg to covering DeFi? How are they similar and how are they different?
00:33:08.176 - 00:33:52.230, Speaker A: Oh, my God. Let's see. It's obviously a much smaller market, so there's less to cover, but at the same time, it's like one market. I don't know because okay, so DeFi is just a global ecosystem and it's all part of the same thing. Whereas in covering markets for Bloomberg, you had very separate markets. So there's emerging markets, developed markets. Within emerging markets, you have Brazil or Latin America and Asia, and each country has its own specific rules and systems and securities and they're all like in little cages.
00:33:52.230 - 00:34:39.558, Speaker A: But in DeFi, because it's like a global network, it's all one thing. So I think that's a little bit different. It's also 24/7. So it's not like a Bloomberg, once the market closes, you can kind of go home and not worry about anything. In D Five, you can have hacks in the middle of the night on weekends, which is when they usually yeah, you need to be on all the time. And I think this is, I don't know, very personal and more of like a colorful statement. But I enjoy covering this space more because I kind of can communicate better with the people building these things.
00:34:39.558 - 00:35:30.680, Speaker A: I can relate better to them. So, just to put it more concretely, covering financial markets, at Bloomberg, I was always in a room with all men in suits in their 50s or whatever, just like old white men in suits. And it just felt like it was obviously just a job for them. There was no passion for what they were doing. And it's so different covering crypto and especially covering Ethereum and the DeFi community. It's much more diverse. So obviously still male dominated, but you still get women and female founders who are absolutely doing amazing stuff.
00:35:30.680 - 00:35:55.550, Speaker A: It's a lot younger crowd, and it's so nice to be covering a space where people are actually passionate about what they're doing and you can just see it come across interviews and their products. They're really putting their hearts into this. So, yeah, I think that's a big difference from covering traditional markets.
00:35:56.050 - 00:36:08.900, Speaker B: Yeah. I relate to you on so many different levels in everything you just said. And how would you say that launching and running your own crypto media company compares to working for traditional media?
00:36:09.910 - 00:37:11.762, Speaker A: Oh, I've been loving being my own boss. So I when I left Bloomberg, I always had in the back of my mind that I would one day start my own thing. And when I was thinking of it, I was like, am I glamorizing being an entrepreneur and having a startup? And actually it's been amazing. I'm glad that I took that step, but it's obviously very different because I'm doing everything. It's like I'm covering. Like, I'm doing the journalism, I'm also doing the editing. I'm running kind of the infrastructure, building the website, doing the podcast, editing, making sure, talking to substac people when the site is down or getting the crypto payment on board, all that kind of logistics.
00:37:11.762 - 00:38:04.950, Speaker A: That at Bloomberg there were like entire teams of people working. I had nothing to worry about are all on me now. But it's really fun because it's like I get to think of bigger things, like the strategy and where am I going to take this media platform and what does the future look like and who do I partner with, what sponsors do. Like, all of the business side of things, which I had no experience with before and now I'm doing, has been really fun to learn and it's exciting building my own thing. So at Bloomberg, I often stayed really late working on stories. And it was fine. It was still kind of my work that I was proud of to deliver a story.
00:38:04.950 - 00:38:17.020, Speaker A: But now it's even better because it's not just this one. Story, but it's working towards my own thing, my own brand. So, yeah, I've really enjoyed the experience.
00:38:17.550 - 00:38:23.486, Speaker B: So you are working directly with your sponsors or are you trying to do the oh, you are? Okay.
00:38:23.588 - 00:38:29.994, Speaker A: Yeah, I started taking sponsors in April. Like late April.
00:38:30.122 - 00:38:35.410, Speaker B: Okay, but are you trying to do the church and state separation between business and editorial?
00:38:35.910 - 00:38:37.234, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, definitely.
00:38:37.432 - 00:38:38.082, Speaker B: Okay.
00:38:38.216 - 00:38:55.682, Speaker A: Yeah, so I have sponsors who place kind of banners or logos at the top of the newsletter, but all the content that doesn't affect the content. I'm still covering the spaces. I would if I had no sponsors.
00:38:55.746 - 00:39:00.540, Speaker B: Oh, right, yeah. But yeah, I actually hired a separate person, so I don't even.
00:39:03.070 - 00:39:05.660, Speaker A: Yeah, I did do that. That comes next.
00:39:07.230 - 00:39:36.040, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I'm right now hiring more on the editorial side. So I think you seem to have built that out first. But also I'm still working on my book. So our timelines, we're probably doing similar parallel track things, but on different timelines. So I was curious, who are you finding is subscribing to the Defiant? Are they people who kind of already tend to be in the industry or are you also getting people who are just interested in DeFi but don't necessarily work in the space already?
00:39:36.570 - 00:40:27.414, Speaker A: So at first I think it was mostly people in the industry. So I had tons of VCs, a lot of the crypto funds subscribe to the Defiant. All of the big DeFi projects and Ethereum projects subscribe to it. So developers from these projects and team members subscribe and also just traders like users of DeFi platforms are also subscribers. But recently I've seen people who are more adjacent to DeFi and Ethereum subscribing as well. So not so into the core. So.
00:40:27.414 - 00:40:58.400, Speaker A: Yeah, I can tell. I have this subscriber chat on Discord. Sometimes people introduce themselves and now I'm seeing more people who are just like, oh, I'm just starting to learn about Defiant, Ethereum, and excited to learn with the Defiant. Whereas before it was just like, more people who were already in the space. So, yeah, it seems like we're getting kind of an influx of new people.
00:40:59.010 - 00:41:27.590, Speaker B: That's great. You also said in the Hidden Forces podcast, Overtime show that you think one trend that we're seeing in crypto media is people prefer to follow individuals rather than institutions. And I wondered, coming from a traditional journalistic background where obviously we try not to state our opinions or we try not to become the story, how are you dealing with becoming more synonymous with your brand or your publication?
00:41:29.790 - 00:42:33.040, Speaker A: Yeah, it's been like a weird transition and it's something that I wanted to do to be able to express my own opinion and just be my own agent at Bloomberg. I kind of struggled with that, especially because I was obviously a lot more interested in crypto and much more bullish in crypto than most people at Bloomberg. So I always kind of found that struggle with my editors who wanted to push this story one way, but I was like, no, that's not really what's going on. So now it's great to just be able to cover this space how I see it and not have to ask for permission to go to all these different events and even go on your podcast. I would have had to go through three layers of permission. So it's so great to just be able to say yes to everything at the same time. Like I said, because I want The Defiant to be a journalistic platform.
00:42:33.040 - 00:43:32.320, Speaker A: It includes my opinion, but I try to be a lot more measured with it, and if I have an opinion, I'm always going to back it with fast. It's not like, oh, I love this thing because and you should use it. It's like, no, this is great because it's tons of volume. It has never been hacked, it has artists and whatever. I'm going to provide more substance to whatever my opinion is. Yeah, it's something that I'm still kind of figuring out what the right balance is of me being the figure for The Defiant versus having kind of the brand take the front stage. And I think it'll be kind of a transition that will just have to happen organically with time as I bring in more contributors and the Defiance starts being The Defiant and not like Cami Russo's project.
00:43:32.320 - 00:43:56.230, Speaker A: But we'll see. I think for now, I'm happy to be kind of the face of it and pushing it and use my, I don't know, whatever influence I have in this space to build out the brand. But I think hopefully with time, the Defiance will become a bigger brand than my own brand.
00:43:56.810 - 00:44:04.490, Speaker B: And along the way, you've launched something called the Kami Token. Tell us what that is and how people can use it or earn it.
00:44:04.640 - 00:45:10.138, Speaker A: Yeah, well, I think it's just part of me testing these things out as I report them. And this is something else that's different from reporting at Bloomberg, because at Bloomberg, we were very restricted in owning the things that we cover. Rightly? So I think but that was so strict that it was hard for me to own even a little bit of crypto to test all these platforms out. But now I have more freedom to do that, and I've been using that to test different DeFi platforms and NFTs and all this stuff. So that's what kind of the idea of Kami Tokens came covering. I wrote a post on Roll, which is the platform that facilitates the issuing of your own personal tokens. And at Bloomberg, I actually had wanted to do my own ICO in the ICO bubble, just like I thought it'd be like a fun story, like what it actually takes to do an ICO.
00:45:10.138 - 00:45:48.822, Speaker A: But yeah, obviously I wasn't allowed to because everyone freaked out. You'll go to jail, you get a suede. So I couldn't do that. But now withdrawal and these personal tokens, I was able to finally have a Kami token. And yeah, it was just like more of a way to test how these things work. And it was actually super easy. The interface is just what's your token's name, how many tokens do you want to issue? And building kind of use cases for the token.
00:45:48.822 - 00:46:37.290, Speaker A: So I haven't been paying that much attention to it. But my idea was that people would be able that first I could reward my readers and audience with the token. So if people were recommending the Defiant or tweeting about it, or tweeting about my book, I would send them Kami tokens. And then the other side of the market would be that Kami tokens could be used to buy things like a subscription to the Defiance. And I think so far, one subscription has been bought by June, June Wong. So, yeah, it hasn't been like an exactly active market, but it's been fun to test it out. I should give it more attention.
00:46:37.950 - 00:46:45.550, Speaker B: And did you do any kind of legal work to make sure that the different use cases you had for it didn't run afoul of securities loss?
00:46:46.210 - 00:47:31.070, Speaker A: Well, I did talk to a couple of lawyers about personal tokens and where that line is, and as long as you're using them to exchange actual things, they're more like airline miles. But I think that line is crossed when you are promising future profits that come from your work. When it's more like a dividend kind of thing, that's where it becomes trickier. But if you're just using these tokens in exchange for a subscription or in exchange for an hour of my time, then it's safer.
00:47:31.570 - 00:47:40.320, Speaker B: And I also saw you participated in some of the Gitcoin grant rounds. Describe that process and what you've been getting grants for.
00:47:40.690 - 00:48:55.522, Speaker A: I think what they're doing is really amazing in enabling funding for different open source and Ethereum projects. What makes Gitcoin grants work is this idea that with donating a little bit of money of crypto, you can actually make a big impact because of the matching. So that really kind of incentivizes people to donate, even if it's one die, because of how the system works, you actually end up donating a lot more. So that's kind of generated this feedback loop of everyone in Ethereum donating to these grants. And yeah, I made the first grant in the previous round. That's when they opened it to media projects, and it was really great. I got over 4000 die in the grant and I've been using it to compensate my contributors, so it's been really instrumental.
00:48:55.522 - 00:49:37.350, Speaker A: And then this time around, I also got close to 4000 die in donations, and I want to use that to help build out part of my website. Yeah, I think in general, the whole kind of experiment in these types of funding rounds generates this sense of community that you're all kind of helping each other, building for each other. So, yeah, we'll see. I think I'm doing it quarterly. Feels like it's helping these projects be more sustainable in general.
00:49:37.420 - 00:49:43.430, Speaker B: How do you think media companies can take advantage of crypto tokens or decentralized business models?
00:49:45.450 - 00:50:49.820, Speaker A: That's interesting. I think there's a lot of work to be done in this space. I don't think anyone has really figured it out yet, but one of the big ideas and kind of Holy Grail ideas for media and crypto is this kind of model where users pay make micro payments for reading single articles, or this idea of streaming content as you would stream music or video. So I don't think that's been achieved yet, but that would be like an interesting model to try out. It would require kind of everyone being connected and very cheap transactions. So potentially in some layer two channel or something, it could work out. But yeah, that'd be interesting.
00:50:49.820 - 00:51:37.610, Speaker A: Unlock Protocol is this project that's focused on media subscriptions with crypto and they've been working on this idea of unlocking content with crypto. So that's another way for now. For me personally, unlock has allowed a way to give crypto subscriptions where substack hasn't yet. So it's like very basic, just like subscriptions but with crypto. But at least I've been able to implement that. But yeah, I think going forward, this idea of streaming content is where crypto can make a big impact.
00:51:38.590 - 00:51:57.140, Speaker B: So let's now talk again about Ethereum because obviously we have this five year anniversary coming up. You recently tweeted that the total market cap of ERC 20 tokens is now higher than the market cap of Ethereum. What do you think is the significance of that fact?
00:51:57.670 - 00:53:19.930, Speaker A: Well, what this obviously means on itself is that the economy being built on Ethereum is now more valuable than the token securing it, so it's more valuable than ETH itself. And that really signals the amount of innovation going on on top of Ethereum. That's one way to look at it. Another way to look at it is, wow, ETH is really undervalued because the platform should be more valuable than the applications on top. But that's a thesis, it's a hypothesis that's yet to be proven. So it's been kind of assumed that in blockchains, because the underlying layer one can now be made valuable with its own token, that this would allow the layer one and protocol layer to gain in value as applications are built on top. And I think that's different from non tokens, from layer one protocols that don't have tokens.
00:53:19.930 - 00:54:29.026, Speaker A: Obviously the internet is the best example. And so the idea there is that if the internet, like the TCP IP protocol had had a token, that token would be more valuable than all of the applications built on top, but because it didn't have a token, nobody could actually profit from this network. Right? And so that's the difference that blockchains are building to the table that now these layer one protocols can actually be made sustainable and people can invest in these protocols and that these tokens will become the most valuable. So I think it's interesting that with tokens on top of Ether becoming more valuable, this theory is being challenged. So I don't know if it's the case that that theory was wrong and that really the tokens on top of Ethereum can be more valuable than ether itself or that Ether is undervalued and it just needs to catch up.
00:54:29.208 - 00:54:35.758, Speaker B: Yeah. I wonder if it might switch back once we move to proof of stake or once ethereum moves to proof of stake.
00:54:35.934 - 00:54:49.514, Speaker A: Right, yeah, maybe kind of the economics of proof of work aren't kind of keeping up with the actual value of ether and once people start locking ETH up to stake, it will we'll see.
00:54:49.632 - 00:55:05.950, Speaker B: Yeah. And just going back to DeFi, there have been so many hacks in the DeFi space. How do you think about balancing your coverage of the risks against who your readers are and the fact that they're interested in DeFi?
00:55:06.450 - 00:56:11.998, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I think to me covering the hacks is probably the most important thing that I can do because everyone else is going to be covering how great the space is. You have their projects themselves doing that. You have their press releases, you have their Tweets, you have all these other newsletters covering kind of cheerleading for the space, which they're great, but I think you need to balance that out with a more kind of objective view and pointing out the good and the bad. And the hacks are definitely the bad. So I think it's really important, especially for new readers to realize the level of risk that there is here. And there is definitely really high risk in DeFi from code breaking, which it does, to just the volatility of the market, how illiquid it is. Yeah, there's just risks everywhere.
00:56:11.998 - 00:56:57.058, Speaker A: And I always say, as excited as I am for DeFi and Ethereum, these things, DeFi is just like two years old. How many years did the financial system take to be as secure as it is today? We're just like in the very early stages. This code needs to be tested, it needs to be audited, there needs to be some sort of protection for users. I think the main thing I say is I encourage people to check these things out, but with money that they can afford to lose, I think it's kind of the safest advice for sure.
00:56:57.224 - 00:57:08.550, Speaker B: And so for the next, let's say, year, do you have any predictions in DeFi or are there any particular metrics that you're keeping your eye on or projects or trends?
00:57:09.130 - 00:58:30.346, Speaker A: Let's see well, I think value locked is like the main metric that people are looking at, but in terms of trends, I'd love to see more like DeFi becoming more secure and I think that should be a big focus and I think it is. So there are projects like Nexus mutual building insurance for DeFi, others like open building kind of hedging options for DeFi. So hopefully a big trend in DeFi will be different ways to protect traders and users. And another trend I hope to see, which I think has been very much missing, is identity systems. The ability to have decentralized identity will unlock so many other new use cases which might enable kind of greater adoption beyond crypto whales. And specifically the ability of having loans that require less collateral than they do now. Because right now, borrowing in DeFi requires you to put capital upfront.
00:58:30.346 - 00:58:54.086, Speaker A: And so that, right off the bat, excludes a bunch of people who just don't have that capital. So having some sort of credit system, some way of verifying payment history, that will really kind of unlock so much more value and use cases in the ecosystem. So hopefully, that'll be a trend to look forward to.
00:58:54.188 - 00:59:00.460, Speaker B: And what about bitcoin on Ethereum? What are you looking for as you watch that?
00:59:01.550 - 01:00:07.390, Speaker A: That's such an interesting trend. Bitcoin on Ethereum has really skyrocketed and it's been interesting to see there's actual demand from bitcoin holders to put their bitcoin on smart contracts or deposits and using Ethereum tokens instead on Ethereum. So I think this will continue to grow as DeFi becomes more useful and secure. More bitcoiners will want to start using these applications, and I think that will be the case with other non Ethereum tokens. And even with maybe tokenized real world assets, there's this idea that Ethereum will start kind of sucking in assets into the platform. I think the first one is bitcoin, but going forward, I'd expect all types of assets to start kind of participating in DeFi.
01:00:08.130 - 01:00:31.810, Speaker B: Yeah, it's definitely a fascinating space. I think it's really great that you carved out this niche to cover because you're right, it's easily one of the most interesting beats within the overall crypto. Yeah. Well, it's been so great having you on Unchained. Where can people learn more about you? The Defiant and the infinite machine.
