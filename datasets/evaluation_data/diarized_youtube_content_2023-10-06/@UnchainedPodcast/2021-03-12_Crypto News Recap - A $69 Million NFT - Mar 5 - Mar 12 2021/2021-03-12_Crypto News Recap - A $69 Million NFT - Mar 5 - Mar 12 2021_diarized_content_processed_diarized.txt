00:00:00.000 - 00:00:42.522, Speaker A: Um, heads up, everyone. Before we get into the news recap, I wanted to mention that when we did the show last month, all about crypto taxes for 2020, I asked about taxes on NFTs. But I asked only about NFTs for creators. I neglected to ask about taxes on NFTs for investors. I reached back out to one of our guests, Shihan Shadrasekra of Coin Track, who graciously wrote up a quick explanation of how NFTs get taxed for NFT investors. To briefly recap how NFT creators get taxed, he writes, quote, creators get taxed at the time they sell NFTs. Say Sam created an NFT artwork and sold it for two ETH valued at $2,000.
00:00:42.522 - 00:01:16.910, Speaker A: He would report $2,000 as ordinary income. If he's in the business of creating NFTs, he can also deduct business related expenses to reduce the tax bill. And so, as for NFT investors, this is what she Han had to say about how they'll be taxed investors are individuals who buy and sell NFTs for speculative purposes. Most people fall into this category. For investors, taxes work very similar to crypto trading. There's a taxable event whenever you sell an NFT into cash or another. Cryptocurrency profits are subject to capital gains tax rules.
00:01:16.910 - 00:02:09.800, Speaker A: Say Sally purchased an NFT for two ETH worth $4,000 in January 2021. If she were to sell this NFT for $10,000 in March 2021, with a holding period of less than twelve months, she would have a short term capital gain of $6,000. And this $6,000 would be subject to her ordinary income tax rate. If she were to sell this NFT for $10,000 after holding it for more than twelve months, say in March 2022, the profit of $6,000 would be subject to more favorable long term capital gains tax rates. One interesting item to note is that some NFTs could fall under the definition of collectibles. Under the IRS rules, the maximum long term capital gains tax rate for collectibles is 20%. The maximum long term capital gains for crypto noncollectible NFTs is 20%.
00:02:09.800 - 00:02:48.878, Speaker A: All right, now, time for the news recap. First headline christie's auction house sells an NFT for $69 million. On Thursday, a digital artwork representing the first 5000 days of digital art created by artist Mike Winkleman, aka Beeple, was sold for $60.25 million at Christie's in New York, with the buyer's premium for purchasing an ETH. The total comes out to $69 million. In case you missed it, be sure to check out the unconfirmed episode with Mike last fall, when he first made $3.5 million from his digital art crypto.
00:02:48.878 - 00:03:22.134, Speaker A: Twitter was aghast when it first thought that Justin Sun, the founder of Tron, was the buyer. Blockchain Consultant. Maya Zahavi Tweeted. Why did it have to be Justin Sun? It's way too predictable and in the worst way possible. However, the story took a turn later when CoinDesk reported that Justin Sun was actually not the winning bidder. When I tweeted about this, Oli Chan tweeted back at me craig Wright has entered the chat. Another good guess was from a Twitter user named Mike with the handle 4K TV who suggested shamath.
00:03:22.134 - 00:04:28.626, Speaker A: Paula Hapatia, the billionaire, was the buyer. I guess we will find out later. The bidding for Everyday's the first 5000 Days, a mosaic of every image that Winkleman has made since 2013, opened at $100 on February 25 and was pushed to $1 million in under 20 minutes, with only three of the bidders previously known to Christie's. An hour before the sale closed, the online bids were sitting at around $14 million until they jumped from 22 million to 35 million before closing at a startling 60.25 million in a sale that is nearly unprecedented in modern auction history. Everyday's is now the third most expensive artwork sold by a living artist in auction, thanks in large part to a group of bidders using magic Internet money. Jack Dorsey is auctioning off his genesis tweet, quote Just setting up my Twitter from March 21, 2006 via the ethereum platform valuables the latest bid sits at $2.5
00:04:28.626 - 00:05:14.660, Speaker A: million. Dorsey announced that he will convert all proceeds to Bitcoin and promptly donate to give directly as part of its Africa response program. Crypto punk number seven eight four sold for 4200 E, which converts to $7.56 million this week, blowing the previous highest amount paid for a CryptoPunk out of the water at a mere 800 ETH. Last week, a banksy piece was purchased, burned on a live stream and then digitally resurrected as an NFT. This week, that artwork titled Morons sold for 229 ETH, which is $382,000. Taco Bell dropped five Ta collectibles on Rarible this week, and those sold out in minutes.
00:05:14.660 - 00:05:57.546, Speaker A: And lastly, a 16 z crypto is investing $20 million in NFT marketplace openc. Certainly looks like a good time for anybody in this space to get investment. All right. Next Headline Investors continue to pour money into crypto firms. Crypto lender Blockfly announced a series D funding round of $350,000,000, valuing the firm at $3 billion with $10 billion in outstanding loans and profitable operations. Zach Prince, BlockFi's chief executive officer, said, quote we are interested in becoming a public company. The latest round of funding means that blockfly has raised more than $450,000,000 in venture capital.
00:05:57.546 - 00:06:52.190, Speaker A: NYDIG, the bitcoin subsidiary of Stone Ridge known for getting insurance company mass mutual to allocate capital bitcoin announced a 200 million dollar growth round led by Morgan Stanley, Soros fund Management, Mass Mutual and New York Life amongst others. NYDIG will be working with its investors to explore bitcoin centric initiatives and expects, quote, an explosion of innovation in Bitcoin products and services, Robert Gutman, NYDIG CIO, said in a press release on Monday. In other news, PayPal confirmed the purchase of Curve, a provider of cloud based infrastructure, as the payment company's first acquisition in the crypto industry. Curve will join the newly formed crypto focused business unit that PayPal recently created. Next Headline More ways to get exposure to bitcoin in the capital. TP. Morgan is looking to offer clients a way to invest in crypto through structured notes linked to cryptocurrency focused companies.
00:06:52.190 - 00:07:49.250, Speaker A: The JPMorgan Cryptocurrency exposure basket will hold eleven stocks, including a 20% stake in MicroStrategy, an 18% waiting for Square, and a 15% allocation for both Riot Blockchain and Chipmaker Nvidia. The basket, curiously, does not include Tesla stock and will also not contain crypto assets directly. In a similar move, the simplify US. Equity Plus Bitcoin ETF is looking to provide a workaround to the SEC's reluctance to approve a straightforward bitcoin ETF. According to the SEC, the new fund would invest up to 50% of its overall holdings into Cryptocurrency indirectly via the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. If approved, the ETF would trade under the ticker SPBC and be administered by BNY Mellon. Grayscale, the world's largest digital asset management firm, posted nine new job openings this week, strongly suggesting the trust company is positioning itself to launch an ETF.
00:07:49.250 - 00:08:51.778, Speaker A: The vacant listings consistently reference an ETF business, but do not specify which assets the ETF will include. The ETF related job openings come during a period where both the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and Ethereum Trust are trading at a discount to the price of the underlying assets. Grayscale has roughly $36 billion in assets under management. On Thursday, crypto investment company CoinShares began trading on the Nasdaq First North Growth Market, an alternative stock exchange for smaller companies in Europe. Under the ticker CS, the IPO was oversubscribed by 400%, totaling $80 million in raised funds and bringing aboard 2280 news shareholders. Norwegian oil and gas company Acura announced a new unit dedicated to investing in bitcoin and bitcoin related projects. The new company, CT, plans to keep its liquid assets in bitcoin, establish mining operations to better utilize stranded wind, solar and hydropower and invest in projects within the bitcoin ecosystem.
00:08:51.778 - 00:10:21.970, Speaker A: CT will partner with Blockstream to accelerate the use of renewable energy used in bitcoin mining. In a tweet highlighting some choice quotes from the acre letter, Alex Glasdine, chief strategy officer of the Human Rights Foundation, said he thinks the acre announcement is a quote major step toward more Scandinavian bitcoin plus adoption. Next Headline Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1559 to be implemented in July Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1559, which could turn Ether into a deflationary asset, has been accepted in an Ethereum network upgrade and will go live in conjunction with the London Hard Fork this coming July or August. The proposal will change blockchain transactions on Ethereum so that a portion of the gas fee is burned in each transaction, potentially reducing the total supply of ETH. While EIP 1559 may sound exciting for ETH holders and application builders, a majority of Ethereum miners reportedly over 60% of the network's hash power oppose EIP 1559 as it effectively reduces minor revenue stream. Miners, however, have few options to stop EIP 1559 outside of a hostile 51% attack, which is a highly unlikely attack vector given the lack of economic incentives. Now that the proposal is approved, the reduction in minor compensation may lead to a rise in the implementation of minor Extractable value software, which takes advantage of a miner's ability to front run trades in the block it is currently securing.
00:10:21.970 - 00:11:11.166, Speaker A: Given miners opposition, it will be interesting to see how the Ethereum community handles the contentious proposal, though. Derek crypto researcher Hasu thinks that EIP 1559 will not be the issue that forces miners to fork the network. He tweeted quote Miners will 100% fork Ethereum, but not for EIP 1559. They have one bullet and they need to save it for the end of proof of work mining. Next Headline New crypto bills could give Dows and Tokens new life On Tuesday, the Wyoming state Senate approved legislation that would recognize decentralized autonomous organizations as companies. It will become law if passed by the Wyoming House of Representatives. The bill would allow DAOs to set up in Wyoming and further bolster the state's reputation as a blockchain friendly jurisdiction.
00:11:11.166 - 00:12:40.110, Speaker A: Aaron Wright, a professor at Cardozo Law in New York, believes the bill is a huge step forward. Tweeting Setting up a legally recognized Dao could cost hundreds of dollars instead of tens of thousands of dollars, and this should, quote Let millions, if not billions of Dows bloom. Preston Byrne, a partner at Anderson Kill Law, strongly disagreed, stating, quote The Wyoming Dow bill is slack jawed stupidity and that, quote Our laws already have concepts that cover algorithmically driven DAOs and their members unincorporated associations and partnerships. Gabriel Shapiro, a partner at BSV Law, seconded Byrne's opinion tweeting that the bill, quote, is a material step backward for LLC based DAOs because it imposes additional regulations on them that have never existed before. Meanwhile, the CFTC and SEC are working with Congress to clarify jurisdiction on different types of cryptocurrencies and tokens. A bipartisan piece of legislation called the Eliminate Barriers to Innovation Act of 2021, introduced Tuesday, seeks to define the parameters for digital asset securities, in which case the SEC would have jurisdiction over securities and digital asset commodities, in which case the CFTC would have jurisdiction. The bill would create a working group composed of SEC and CFTC representatives that would look at issues such as how the current regulations impact the US's competitive position, as well as issues around custody, private key management, fraud and investor protection.
00:12:40.110 - 00:13:51.138, Speaker A: Additionally, the Token Taxonomy Act was reintroduced by Representative Warren Davidson on Wednesday, aiming to exempt certain digital assets from federal securities law by amending the securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Token Taxonomy Act is making its third pass through Congress after being introduced first in 2018 and again in 2019. Representative Davidson, who says he believes the US's opportunity to be a global leader in blockchain tech is closing, sees the Token Taxonomy Act as a way to mend the patchwork of laws and regulations that currently create confusion and sometimes hostility for various blockchain businesses. Next Headline Hacker Token auction gets shut down on Monday, Matthew Hickey of Hacker House released a piece of highly collectible hacker artwork as an NFT. The token contains data that would allow the purchaser to exploit code that would cause a denial of service error in the 28 games that use free game software called Ioquake Three. Hickey describes this concept as a proof of concept exploit redeemable as an NFT. In an interesting decision for an application housed on a decentralized network, Openc promptly took the listing down after it was posted.
00:13:51.138 - 00:14:42.934, Speaker A: The Hacker Token, however, still exists in Hickey's wallet. Speaking of hacks, OpenZeppelin, a cryptocurrency software and security firm, released a software suite called Defender that will give DeFi teams real time alerts and automated scripts in response to Flash loan attacks. Flash loans have been one of the most common tools for hacking DFI applications, resulting in $150,000,000 in losses since 2020. The key to Defender is a set of automated responses that allows the smart contract to be paused or upgraded quickly. Defender cannot prevent Flash loan attacks from occurring, but it can be used to stop the exploit before the hacker can make off with a large number of coins. Time for fun bits. Grants for Rollups the Theorem Foundation is sponsoring a Wave of Rollup Community grants due April 16 to help Kickstart development on L2.
00:14:42.934 - 00:15:26.546, Speaker A: Scaling solutions. Anyone is free to participate. All the application requires is an idea and a passion for building along with a high level understanding of optimistic rollups. Some items on the Ethereum Foundation's wish list include making it easier for devs to deploy DApps on rollups, enabling interactions between rollups, and establishing rollup standards. Again, the deadline is April 16 for any developers interested in submitting a proposal. Second fun Bits crypto on Tim Ferriss popular author and podcast host Tim Ferriss has recently published two crypto related shows. This week, he had on Vitalik, Buterin and Ravikon to discuss Ethereum scaling plans, NFTs and more.
00:15:26.546 - 00:16:18.402, Speaker A: One of the more interesting moments of the show was when Vitalik said he thought there was some chance that some members of the Ethereum community, such as miners and perhaps some people who don't want to take the risks of moving over to a proof of Stake Platform will stay on Ethereum One instead of moving over to Ethereum Two. Also in February, Tim interviewed Catherine Hahn, general partner at a 16 Z Crypto, about her time prosecuting crimes involving the Dark Web and some rogue federal agents. Plus, she discusses NFTs in a highly accessible way to a mainstream audience. I very much recommend both shows and think that Tim is doing a great job introducing crypto to his mainstream audience.
