00:00:00.280 - 00:00:47.738, Speaker A: We do want to clarify something which is that the lock countdown for everyone in the team. For the team as well as for investors it starts after transferability so people are not in a different camp. People are in the same camp. We've seen what happens with other I don't want to name people because I know other people tried to correct it when they made this mistake. There's no reason why the community should be having their time kind of delaying the point of having the one year unlocking for insiders, the team and investors. It's a shared belief by everybody that that's a fair thing to do so that the stake drops have this initial Runway which is community focused. So of course that is what we are doing so thank you for asking that as well.
00:00:47.738 - 00:00:58.834, Speaker A: It's just really important. You have to align the incentives. If you don't have this for protocols that make the mistake of not doing this it could cause an issue because the community is taking.
