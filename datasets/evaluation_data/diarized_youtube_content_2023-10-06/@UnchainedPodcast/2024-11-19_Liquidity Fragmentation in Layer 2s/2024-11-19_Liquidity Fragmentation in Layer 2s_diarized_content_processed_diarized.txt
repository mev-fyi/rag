00:00:00.240 - 00:00:34.265, Speaker A: An easy way to understand that currently this high level of composability is not given is to just look at a protocol like aave, where you have currently separate instances of AAVE on. Yeah, kind of on Ethereum, but also all the big roll ups, and you will find that the very same assets, let's say uscc, have very quite different interest rates. So on, whatever. On ethereum is currently 7%. On base it's 12%. On Arbitra it's 9%. And that shouldn't really happen.
00:00:34.265 - 00:00:56.885, Speaker A: If it was kind of one ecosystem. If it was one ecosystem, then all those rates would immediately kind of even, or you basically would have one rate, and that one rate would have the deepest liquidity. So kind of just the fact that those different rates exist show already that there's all kind of friction to move assets across those chains.
