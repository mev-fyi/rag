00:00:00.170 - 00:00:44.214, Speaker A: You. Thanks for tuning in to this week's news. Recap some bitcoin Miners face Profitability concerns after weeks of negative price pressure for bitcoin and all other crypto assets, the profitability of bitcoin mining has been put into question. Miners have to pay for electricity and other fixed and variable costs in fiat currency. With bitcoin price trading at $20,800 as of press time and having plummeted 57% this year against the US dollar, it is getting harder for miners to have a sustainable business. Glassnode released a report highlighting miners current financial stress. According to the Blockchain research firm, bitcoin is trading near the estimated cost of production.
00:00:44.214 - 00:01:41.690, Speaker A: Hash rate has decreased significantly and incomes are below the yearly average. With this extensive financial pressure on miners outflow, volumes from their treasuries reached rates of between 5000 to 8000 bitcoins per month. This is now comparable with the 2018 to 2019 bear market capitulation event, Glassnode commented in its report. Arcane Research also stated in an analysis that the deteriorating profitability of mining has forced the public miners to start liquidating their bitcoin holdings. This week, bitcoin miner Bit Farms announced the sale of 3000 bitcoin to pay down part of a 100 million dollar loan with Galaxy. In consideration of extreme volatility in the markets, we have continued to take action to enhance liquidity and to deleverage and strengthen our balance sheet, said CFO Jeff Lucas. In a sign of how the depressed price has challenged miners, the bloc reported that bitcoin mining difficulty has decreased by 2.35%
00:01:41.690 - 00:02:13.030, Speaker A: since June eigth, which accounted for the second largest single fall this year. In the same period of time, the hash rate has also dropped 2.6%. However, it was not all bad news for the crypto mining industry this week. Miner Bit Digital reported $8 million in revenue in the first quarter of the year. In addition, Black Hill announced that it will start to power bitcoin mining in Wyoming. With Celsius's solvency still in question. FTX rescues BlockFi.
00:02:13.030 - 00:03:11.820, Speaker A: BlockFi CEO Zach Prince announced on Tuesday that the crypto lender had secured a $250,000,000 credit line from FTX. Today, Blockfly signed a term sheet with FTX to secure a $250,000,000 revolving credit facility, providing us with access to capital that further bolsters our balance sheet and platform strength, Prince said. Sam Bankman Fried, FTX founder, said that the intention behind this deal is to allow BlockFi to navigate the market from a position of strength. He added, we take our duty seriously to protect the digital asset ecosystem and its customers. The deal comes at a time of high turmoil in the crypto ecosystem. With prices plummeting, big companies like crypto lender Celsius and trading firm Three Earla's Capital being liquidated on their positions and a hard macroeconomic environment. Earlier in June, the Block reported that Blockfly was raising a down round at a $1 billion valuation after it was rumored last year to have been raising at a valuation of $5 billion.
00:03:11.820 - 00:04:07.980, Speaker A: Alameda saves Voyager Digital, which discloses three AC exposure. Last Friday, crypto broker Voyager Digital signed a term sheet for $200 million in revolving credit from bankman fried's Quant trading firm Alameda. The idea behind the loan was the same as Blockvis, as FTX intends to provide more flexibility to mitigate market conditions. However, on Wednesday, Voyager Digital disclosed involvement in Three Arrows Capital, causing a negative reaction in the markets. Voyager Digital may issue a notice of default to Three Arrows Capital or Three AC for failure to repay its loan. Voyager's exposure to three AC consists of 15,250 bitcoins and $350,000,000 of USDC. The company's shares at Ticker V-Y-G VF plummeted around 50% after the news due to questions about the solvency of three AC.
00:04:07.980 - 00:05:01.050, Speaker A: During the past few days, three AC has reportedly been liquidated by Blockfly, BitMEX and Genesis. In response to the situation, the crypto broker decided to limit daily withdrawals from its platform to $10,000, down from $25,000. Similarly, crypto exchange CoinFLEX halted withdrawals due to extreme market conditions yesterday. First short bitcoin ETF launched investment product issuer ProShares announced on Monday the launch of a new exchange traded fund that will make it possible to short bitcoin. In addition, the ETF will allow investors to hedge their crypto exposure. The ProShares short bitcoin strategy was listed on the NYSE on Tuesday. According to the company's website, the ETF's purpose is to avoid the significant costs and fees typically required to short bitcoin.
00:05:01.050 - 00:05:38.920, Speaker A: ProShares listed many of the advantages of having a short ETF over the current possibilities, such as futures and put options. For example, users now have the possibility to short bitcoin operating through a traditional brokerage account. Secondly, it removes the possibility of losing more bitcoin than what you can put in. Lastly, investors will not be required to add funds to maintain margin levels. ProShares is the largest provider of bitcoin linked ETFs in the United States. In October 2021, it was the first company to list a bitcoin futures ETF. At that point, BTC was going through a bull market and was trading at around $60,000.
00:05:38.920 - 00:06:46.638, Speaker A: The fact that the launch of that ETF was done so close to the end of the bull market caused some people on Twitter to joke that the launch of this new ETF could mark the end of this bear market. However, not everyone took the news so lightly. Will Clemente, a bitcoin analyst, tweeted So there's now a short bitcoin ETF, a futures ETF, a closed end fund trading at a 30% plus discount, a 401K option for bitcoin, but no spot ETF it is clear that Gary Glens, Gensler and the SEC have an agenda against bitcoin.
