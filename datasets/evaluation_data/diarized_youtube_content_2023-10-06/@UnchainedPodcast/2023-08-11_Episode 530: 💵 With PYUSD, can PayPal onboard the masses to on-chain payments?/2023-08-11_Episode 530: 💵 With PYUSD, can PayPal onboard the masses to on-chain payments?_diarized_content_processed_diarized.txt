00:00:00.170 - 00:00:43.380, Speaker A: The vision for the whole of PayPal has always been to be that conduit between fiat and web3 that can bring mainstream adoption to the system for payments. We are a payments company and we really care about the payments applications and the launch of Pyusd is the natural evolution of that journey. We started with enabling that in the app with traditional crypto tokens. Then we moved to onchain transfers, we moved to International Channel and adding now a fully backed and regulated stable instrument of value that can be used for payments is the culmination of that first phase. We do think that stablecoins are the killer application for blockchains right now and they are very close to the payments market that we care so much about.
