00:01:34.030 - 00:01:35.082, Speaker A: Thanks for having us.
00:01:35.136 - 00:01:40.170, Speaker C: Great to see you again, Laura. It's been a long time in this industry. You've been through it thick and thin.
00:01:40.990 - 00:01:59.858, Speaker B: I really haven't. It's been so fun. It's honestly been the ride of my life, and I just loved every minute. All right, before we get into the discussion, why don't we just start with a basic description of BitCo? BitCo has also been around forever, but just for people who may be new to the space.
00:02:00.024 - 00:02:38.320, Speaker C: Mike sure. Well, let's see. BitCo got started in one of the early generations, back in 2013. Started out technology company, pioneered multisignature technology, which is used almost everywhere today for securing large amounts of digital asset. We've grown to support over 20 different blockchains, several hundred tokens provide infrastructure to a large portion of the ecosystem, continuing to push forward on security and compliance. I guess that's why we're here today, talk about low compliance. We are a regulated trust company in two different states, both South Dakota and also New York.
00:02:38.320 - 00:03:03.350, Speaker C: We also have regulated entities abroad to about half our business here in the US. Half outside the US. And I think most recently, Bico and Galaxy have agreed to merge. So that deal is still in progress, hopefully closing in not too long, but that's where we're going next. And that's all about institutional adoption, digital assets, right. And so that's a little about Bico.
00:03:04.090 - 00:03:23.550, Speaker B: And so speaking of institutional adoption, Jeff, you spent many years in traditional finance before making the jump to Crypto. Some of those years were at Pershing City. Lehman brothers. Goldman. And then you did spend time at Coinbase before joining Bico. Why did you decide to leave traditional finance for crypto?
00:03:24.450 - 00:04:00.540, Speaker A: Great question. After being 25 years doing some of the same things every day, sometimes you'll look for something entrepreneurial or a little more innovative. And when I received the call to join Coinbase, I hadn't really researched crypto yet. But in taking the call, I figured I had to do some homework. And I found myself getting really enthusiastic about what was the promise of crypto, what could it do? And to have a seat at the table to help shape regulation for a brand new asset class was just too hard to turn up. And it's been exciting three years in the space and really looking forward to what the next five years will bring.
00:04:01.470 - 00:04:12.650, Speaker B: And so what do you do as a chief compliance officer? And how would you say that compliance in the crypto space differs from that of traditional finance?
00:04:13.310 - 00:05:00.838, Speaker A: Sure. I think the first question that gets asked when you're talking about crypto or regulation is, is it only used for bad guys? Why do we need know Venmo and PayPal and know payment processors work fine here? And I think the answer is it's a global challenge. We don't have PayPal and Venmo around the globe. It's very expensive to do remittance. And so the first thing I do is I set up an AML program. Right. How do we identify and find the bad actors? How do we report them to law enforcement and have a risk based, reasonably designed compliance program? And the other part of my job is working with regulators and whether that's getting new licenses, running a program which needs to have trading, compliance, surveillance, AML policies and procedures.
00:05:00.838 - 00:05:23.460, Speaker A: It's very similar to traditional finance. We're overseen by the New York DFS. They don't have a different rulebook for us than they do Citibank or bank of New York Mellon, who they also oversee. So it's really combining what you've done in traditional finance, but in a fast moving and brand new asset class where some of the technology is just different than the traditional market.
00:05:24.470 - 00:05:41.530, Speaker B: And Mike, since, you know, really, as a crypto custody, obviously, like, you were really a big pioneer in that, how would you say crypto custody differs from being a traditional financial custodian?
00:05:42.430 - 00:06:14.642, Speaker C: Well, as Jeff said, in a lot of ways it shouldn't. But a big part of what we do is help regulators kind of through the process. Right. So, look, we got into this space because we do see the opportunity to make a financial system that is far superior to what we've seen in the past in terms of transparency, in terms of fairness and equality and also being global. As Jeff said, this is the first time we've really had the pipes connected around the planet. So this creates a lot of confusion. People look at digital assets and they're like, this is just different.
00:06:14.642 - 00:07:00.354, Speaker C: I remember the first time, it was one of my early pitches to traditional finance was out at JPMorgan. It was really kind of an exploratory. They were learning what crypto was. It was probably 2015 or 16 or something like that, and just describing how digital assets work, what is multisig, how do the private keys work? All this, you start to see the light bulbs go off, where they get it. And when I started to segue that with like, well, here's how traditional markets work and here's how they should think about it, they could start to relate to it. I remember asking them afterwards, why am I teaching you guys about how market structure in digital assets should work? And they just said they've been so confused because it's such a different asset class. The technology is so foreign compared to what they'd looked at before.
00:07:00.354 - 00:07:36.762, Speaker C: So look, it's no surprise. I think we've all gone through this curve as we get into it. And it's a fascinating space because there's so many different angles of digital assets, from decentralization to what is the private key storage, to how do distributions work and whatnot that it's going to take a lot of education and we're definitely seeing that now from regulators. So kind of back to the chief compliance officer role. I would say actually, on one hand, the compliance officer role is probably supposed to be similar to what you'd see anywhere else. But actually in digital assets right now, it's different. And the thing that's different is it's problem solving.
00:07:36.762 - 00:08:03.990, Speaker C: It's helping regulators understand what's the metaphor between a particular activity and digital asset space compared to traditional markets, and then helping them get over the curve of accepting, like, yes, even though the technology is kind of upside down. Frankly, compared to how the banking system works, that we can actually manage these and we can have safe access and we can fulfill what we're trying to do as keep regulators and keeping money transmission safe.
00:08:04.810 - 00:08:44.850, Speaker B: Yeah. In what you said, it sounds like a huge piece of that is education. But obviously what we've seen in recent weeks with this huge storyline around regulation and this whole fight that went down over the crypto provision of the infrastructure bill, I wondered how you felt. That education piece has been going because the industry, even though it's still fairly new, it has been around for a while, companies like yours have existed for a while. So I just wondered what your sense was of the understanding of the technology from regulators.
00:08:45.430 - 00:09:33.634, Speaker C: Well, look, I applaud the Senate for trying to understand and working toward it. I think what we saw here in this bill was a lot less to do with crypto as it was to do with politics. As you know, they were spending a trillion dollars on an infrastructure bill and they needed to have ways to show that they were going to bring revenue coincident with that. And they decided to go and look in the crypto sector and I think what they thought was going to be relatively easy peasy. They realized, wait a minute, this is more subtle and complicated than we thought. And in particular, that bill would have classified a bunch of people that are clearly not brokers as being brokers. So making a payment in digital assets would now classify you as a broker, being a minor, all these other activities, it clearly doesn't match.
00:09:33.634 - 00:10:00.714, Speaker C: So I think this was more of an artifact of having done that very quickly. They're in a hurry to get the infrastructure bill out. Hopefully that's for good reason. And this kind of became a bit of a tag along. But now on the other side of it, I think there was a huge win for the digital asset space. Bitcoin crypto with this. The Senator saw firsthand how passionate people are about democratizing money.
00:10:00.714 - 00:10:39.210, Speaker C: And this is an area where we were able to mobilize we, the crypto digital asset community, very quickly. Obviously a lot of very technically capable people. But mobilizing on Twitter, they heard our voices loud and clear. And I think if anything, the best outcome for us in particular is that in the future they're going to be seeking out what is my position on digital assets and crypto and how should I be thinking about that for my constituents in a way that's going to help them? Obviously they want to get elected. I think they've recognized that this is a force that really, really matters.
00:10:40.030 - 00:11:24.230, Speaker B: Actually, I did want to ask about one point and what you said where you said that the language would have included some people that were clearly not brokers. And I think you're right that at least for some of those rules, the way the regulation was written, whoever wrote that did not intend to capture people such as miners. But I wonder if there is contention about whether or not or how to tax people participating in DeFi. And I did wonder if maybe the way the language was written was intended to capture those people and that that is a fundamental difference in the way that some regulators view how the space should be regulated versus how the industry views how those people should be regulated.
00:11:25.290 - 00:12:23.398, Speaker A: I think there was more of a lack of education than a targeted view of DeFi. A lot of the reports came out that Janet Yellen and treasury was advising some of the senators on the language. I do think they have an a behind the scenes view that they want to regulate this space as much as possible. But the way to do it for a tax bill and to rope in either miners or stakers or validators was not the best way to do it. And I look back to March of 2020. Secretary Minutian, who was a crypto critic, actually did convene a meeting of some of the same folks, leaders in the crypto industry in Fintech and some traditional financial services to discuss what were the risks in the space, how do we not stifle innovation? And it was all around, what are we going to do about unhosted wallets and the travel rule. And it was a really good dialogue.
00:12:23.398 - 00:13:08.040, Speaker A: And it was literally the week before the country shut down for COVID. But then you fast forward to December and we had the midnight regulatory report come out about transaction reporting and it kind of undid everything that we thought we had a good dialogue about. So I think we have fits and starts on the open dialogue and trying to educate. But this was another example of trying to rush regulation or legislation without partnering with the industry to get a better understanding of what it is they're asking. I don't think the industry is against people paying their proper taxes, but those are most likely exchanges who can do 1099. I don't like legislation that makes it impossible to be compliant with.
00:13:09.370 - 00:13:30.670, Speaker B: And I also wondered, as you mentioned, a lot of people were saying that that appeared to be driven by treasury. And I imagine as a chief compliance officer, maybe you interact more with kind of the rank and file regulators, presumably maybe in the IRS. And I wondered, do you have a sense of what their stance is on how this should be like?
00:13:30.740 - 00:14:05.626, Speaker A: We intersect with everybody multiple Finsen directors over the last couple of years. I sat in on the Minutiae meeting representing compliance and regulatory. So it starts at the top, but it is also the policymakers in between. And some of them have moved around government. Some of them are now advisors at Finsen come from DOJ. I think the challenge is there's always a rush to do this and it's not in a timely manner and the industry needs to mobilize. We sent 7000 letters the last week of December to stop regulation coming out that we just couldn't be compliant with.
00:14:05.626 - 00:14:25.090, Speaker A: That regulation is still floating around Washington and we're waiting for it to be reissued, but hopefully with some better definitions and something that achieves what the regulators are looking for, that's how do we manage the risk, but how do we not drive all this innovation offshore, lose jobs? And I think that's part of the conversation that's happening now in Washington.
00:14:26.150 - 00:14:56.300, Speaker B: Yeah. And I was also going to ask about when you mentioned FinCEN. Obviously the original, you know, was pretty clear in applying to companies that take custody of customers'funds. And I wondered if you felt that that was wavering because it does feel like in various places know, not just in the US. But even like FADF, that maybe that line is not as clear as it used to be.
00:14:56.990 - 00:15:24.370, Speaker A: I don't think it's wavering. I think the Fatif has done a couple of reviews. The Financial Action Task know, they're the global body that's trying to set some global standards. It doesn't apply to companies but applies to countries. And the US is a leader at the fat if they actually help form it. So I don't think treasury is going to back away of wanting more transparency in reporting. We just need to figure out a safe way to do this that we don't cause other problems.
00:15:24.370 - 00:15:58.906, Speaker A: If we centralize some of this travel rule reporting, it will be a honeypot of information. That's not a good solution. There are six or seven leading vendors that are trying to come up with a solution we're part of and a founder of the US Travel Working Group who's trying to do it within the US with companies that are all regulated under Finsen as a money service business. So we're on an equal footing. And long term we're going to need to have an interoperable solution. But that's not going to happen for a number of years. There are privacy concerns, there are cross border data concerns.
00:15:58.906 - 00:16:13.540, Speaker A: And really the conversation needs to happen is how much is this helping law enforcement? Are we going to do reporting for the sake of reporting or are we really going to partner and help law enforcement? And I think that's the open question that the industry and the regulators really need to grapple with.
00:16:13.910 - 00:16:37.480, Speaker B: Okay, yeah, we'll get more into fat up stuff, financial action, task Force stuff. But I actually want to ask one more question about this crypto provision in the infrastructure bill. Mike, I saw you tweeted that the bill claims it would generate $30 billion in tax revenue and you thought that that was preposterous and you said you suspected it would be closer to 50 million. So why do you think that?
00:16:38.010 - 00:17:07.246, Speaker C: Well, I think in the US. Actually, most participants in digital assets are law abiding, tax paying citizens. So the bill is hoping to get additional reporting to somehow capture people that otherwise would not have paid their full taxes. So it's got a premise there which is that somehow this is not happening. I don't know where those numbers came from. As I did back of the envelope math on trading and projections of how much in the US. It didn't get close to 30 billion.
00:17:07.246 - 00:17:27.260, Speaker C: I admit that the 50 million number was kind of just like this as well. I don't have any data behind it, but my point is that it's very easy to come up with some numbers here, but we don't really know or have a way to vet out whether that was a good estimate of how much revenue could be generated by doing this. So anyway, that was the genesis of that.
00:17:27.790 - 00:17:42.686, Speaker B: Okay. Yeah, I mean, it would be kind of hard to estimate that just because you would need an inside look at the books on certain exchanges. I would imagine that would kind of be the main way. Right.
00:17:42.788 - 00:18:41.060, Speaker C: You'd also have to know how much of this activity is happening with US. Taxpayers versus people that are know who's subjected to it, what are the cost basis of these transactions? And I think when you see an industry that's had such a positive success story in terms of growth in such a short period of time and we've never had an asset class grow from zero to this before, there's a natural tendency to think those people might not be paying their taxes. Especially right now in the political environment where obviously there's a lot of spending going on. People are talking about whether billionaires are paying enough or where we're going to get the money from. It makes it an easy target. But it doesn't mean that we should abandon our job of actually collecting data and figuring out, look, is this going to work for raising revenue, or is this just fitting in with the hyperbole? It doesn't seem like a lot of diligence was done, given the speed at which this came together and given the lack of details behind the $28 billion number.
00:18:41.750 - 00:19:22.270, Speaker B: Okay. All right, so let's dig a little more into this Financial Action Task Force stuff. So this is like a global body, and it's been looking at ways to handle DeFi, and the FATF tends to target its guidance against what it calls virtual Asset Service Providers, or VASPs. And traditionally, as I mentioned before, those were defined as those that custody assets. So before we get into kind of the full discussion around this, Jeff, do you want to just give us some background on what these FATF rules are and how they would apply to a company like Bico, which does custody assets?
00:19:22.770 - 00:20:02.982, Speaker A: Sure. So I attended some of the original Fat of Plenary private sector, public sector meetings going back to late 2018, when they started contemplating what would a travel rule mean and how do we define a VASP? And I don't think they were far off on their definition. We're a custodian. We move assets for customers. There are exchanges that move assets for customers. I think where we ran into trouble, though, is how do you define customers of VASPs and the privacy concerns with we're now tasked with sending information from one VASP to another. How do you know what VASP that is? All we have is addresses.
00:20:02.982 - 00:20:40.350, Speaker A: It's not like the Swift Network, which is what they based the travel rule implementation on, and that took nine years to build. A rule came out, and banks worked on it. We are still in the process of writing regulation for a white paper, and that's just not the right way to go. So I think the definition of VASP is the right definition. As a global industry, we are working to define that. And how do we share information in a secure way? Some are doing it in closed loops, just between three or four exchanges or custodians. A lot of them are being designed regionally.
00:20:40.350 - 00:21:38.246, Speaker A: There are a number happening in Singapore. We've got one in the US. And I'm sure there'll be others in Europe? The biggest challenge, though, is how do you define who exactly is a VASP? Are they regulated? And are you comfortable to share information with a VASP that's regulated and pick your developing country versus a framework like we have in the United States or Europe or Japan, where they've spent time trying to figure out what is the best way to regulate? That's the big conundrum we're trying to face because we're dealing with customers'information and the way the rules are written, we're required to send information on non customers. They did not consent that we would share their information with another regulated entity. And so we need to balance all of that with the money laundering and terrorist financing risk that does exist out there. I just don't know if all of this data sharing is really going to get us to the end game. We're all regulated, we can all receive subpoenas.
00:21:38.246 - 00:21:41.550, Speaker A: Do we really need to share that information to help law enforcement?
00:21:42.770 - 00:22:25.578, Speaker B: Wow. Yeah. I mean, it is, first of all, sensitive information, and then second, it sort of gives this picture of a huge global surveillance network. But I did wonder, so because under this travel rule, VASPs would be required to send personally identifiable information, or what's called PII. How do you do that for crypto transactions? Because I don't know exactly how this works. Where could that then associate a person with particular addresses on particular blockchains? And I'm sure it creates different risks. So can you talk a little bit about the security risks and how you guys are trying to mitigate those?
00:22:25.744 - 00:22:49.170, Speaker A: Sure. No, it's a great question. Right. So as a regulated exchange or custodian, we're subject to KYC our clients, so we have that information on the beneficiary. What the rule is proposed is that we send information on the recipient. And so I need to go out to an exchange and say, do you own this address? You do? Oh, great. This is who my customer wanted to send it to.
00:22:49.170 - 00:23:21.146, Speaker A: I'm now going to go into a private chat somewhere and we're going to share information on that client. Now, that exchange or custodian I'm sending it to, if that information gets lost in transmission, it's not secure, it's hacked. Somebody now has an address and a customer name. And yes, you can unwind that and figure out how to read the blockchain and figure out that this customer was a whale. This customer is whoever. That doesn't happen in traditional JP morgan's customers or Morgan's customers or name your bank. And it's not out there.
00:23:21.146 - 00:24:09.414, Speaker A: It's only in this network, which has rarely been hacked, sharing between two banks. That's where I'm really worried that we're trying to have an open and honest conversation with treasury that we could create a bigger problem than you're trying to solve if any one of these steps go wrong. So that's why here in the US, we've started with regulated VASPs. We have a process to vet them? Are they regulated? Have they had AML and KYC concerns. How long have they been in business? And we need to do that before I'm going to trust to send my customer information or any other VASP is going to do that. We're then going to go down and do some pen tests and check security. Because at the end of the day, the biggest risk here is that data gets out there on the Internet, and you can now take a look at the blockchain.
00:24:09.414 - 00:24:25.920, Speaker A: That's the whole point of crypto, right? It's pseudonymous, it's out there. And law enforcement, just in the recent cases today, is able to look at IP addresses and blockchain stuff and figure out who the bad guys are. I don't know that we need to do the travel rule to solve that problem.
00:24:26.390 - 00:25:29.410, Speaker C: And if I can add a little bit here, it's kind of reiterating Jeff's point, but there's a big change, which is because it's a digital asset. So if you were to go back in time to before travel rule was ever a thing and they were determining whether or not they should implement travel rule, they didn't have to worry about exposure of travel rule data exposing your entire balance at the bank. It wasn't a thing. It wasn't a risk. But if they implement the same travel rule that we have for traditional finance with digital assets, that now becomes a risk where your entire financial history could be exposed because of compliance with this law that actually was designed for a different system. So because we have a different system with digital assets, we need to rethink not only like, what does the regulator need, but what are the risks that accompany the collection of that data, however it gets handled. The second thing which has changed, and we've all seen this over the years, I don't think the regulators have fully acknowledged it or acknowledged their contribution to it.
00:25:29.410 - 00:26:06.850, Speaker C: Look, security is a huge problem. Digital security is a huge problem for our industry. Whether you're talking about digital assets or whether you're talking about information privacy or whether you're talking about corporate espionage, I mean, obviously there's a lot of digital security that we're now tuned into that we weren't in the past. The idea that this information can leak as a result of government collection of data is real. We have seen the government hacked and all personnel data from the military be leaked out onto the Internet. We have seen equifax leak all personnel data from all of the clients reporting credit information to them. I mean, these are huge, massive failures.
00:26:06.850 - 00:26:25.446, Speaker C: And why do these things happen? So, unfortunately, to just take the rule that was created a long time ago before we had this awareness around digital security, and apply it today as though those risks don't exist. I think it's a real misjustice to the people if we don't reevaluate kind of how we're doing that and the.
00:26:25.468 - 00:27:30.954, Speaker B: Risks and just to make it clear for people. So when I use an exchange and either I take a payment at that exchange or let's say that I have some crypto on my own hardware wallet and then I deposit it maybe to sell it or whatever, there's, like, a particular address on whether it's like the Bitcoin blockchain or Ethereum blockchain, where either on Ethereum you would call it an address or account, I guess. On Bitcoin it's still an address, I guess, but those kind of change a lot, I guess. But anyway, but the point is that that's associated with your account at that exchange. And so even though exchanges will kind of like commingle the funds in a hot wallet, and they always kind of keep account of what your balance is on their own ledger from the outside, looking at the blockchain, there can be a way to identify a person's own funds even in this commingled kind of state. Is that correct?
00:27:31.152 - 00:28:10.274, Speaker C: That's right. And there's dozens of companies that are building solutions to be able to analyze blockchain data and figure out who's who, as you point out. I mean, identifying who is the exchange is a little bit less sensitive other than it could have a particular user at that exchange being identified. But when it's going out of the exchange to somewhere else, that's where you can really expose a tremendous amount of data. So these analytics tools though, are also an interesting concept. Remember, we don't have analytics tools in traditional finance. There's no way to go and look at this data, it's all private, right? So they created the idea of travel rule in part because they didn't have other tools.
00:28:10.274 - 00:28:35.298, Speaker C: Right. Now if we live in a world where A, we have a blockchain so we can build these tools, which gives us a view that we've never had before. And by the way, this has been working already. I'll give a couple of examples in a moment, but in near real time, particular movements of money can start to be identified. There was a hack on the liquid exchange yesterday, some of those addresses are being blocked already instantly. Right. That never could have happened in the traditional finance system.
00:28:35.298 - 00:29:35.540, Speaker C: A we've got new tools that we never had before, and then B, applying the same old solutions is creating new risk vectors in terms of leaking people's personal information and personal finances, and then also creating honeypots of personally identifiable information, which, frankly and you mentioned earlier about regulators having slightly different views. Or is this undoing fin or whatnot? Pretty much every regulator is looking at crypto in different ways and it's no surprise that as they start to make definitions so that they can write their rules, that you sometimes see those definitions conflict. This is not new to crypto. Right. We have lots of conflicting rules on the books between state laws, federal laws and international laws about what. Different roles are. And especially when you think about things like GDPR and being an American company, it actually turns out to be hard to navigate a line where you can comply with all of the laws that you're required to comply with that is coming as a result of everybody trying to change all at the same time.
00:29:36.230 - 00:30:16.226, Speaker B: Yeah, this is clearly not an easy issue to resolve. All right, so in a moment, we're going to talk a little bit more about these FATF rules.

00:31:34.890 - 00:32:21.530, Speaker B: Back to my conversation with Mike Belshi and Jeff Horowitz. This whole discussion we've had about FATF has been for companies that do custody assets, which was who the travel rule was initially targeted to. But here we have now this emergence of DeFi. And in DeFi, it's not really the same thing, right? Instead of traditional intermediaries that are custody and customers'funds, you've got these smart contracts. So how are regulators looking at that? Are they looking to regulate that? Are they looking to redefine VASP in order to be able to target such things? How do you see that they're thinking about regulating DeFi?
00:32:22.590 - 00:32:57.506, Speaker C: Well, I think first and foremost, it's back to education. Just when you thought you might be getting a handle on layer one on chain bitcoin or ethereum boom income, smart contracts to really blow your mind. And it's a new level now. There's some things being done at a legislative level there. Wyoming is now starting to recognize a potential for a Dow, a smart contract to maybe be a thing. I think we could end up that way in the long run where actually a counterparty can have a legal status, even if it's code. But that's still coming.
00:32:57.506 - 00:33:45.490, Speaker C: Look, DeFi is really only a couple of years old now, so it's no surprise that we've got less information around it. We were talking about travel rule all the way back to 2013. When we got started, it was kind of like this elephant in the room. How is travel rule going to be applied to digital assets? We're farther along now, but it's still not fully finished. And I think the same is going to happen with DFI. We do see industries starting to push for different types of smart contracts that may require identity to be built in with them in order for the smart contract to interact with you, that's going to have some technology impacts, that's going to have some regulatory possibilities, both good and bad. So I think this space is still evolving.
00:33:45.490 - 00:34:03.020, Speaker C: I hope that they let it evolve a little bit longer before we start clamping down too much, because as Jeff said earlier, we could end up just pushing all this stuff outside the still. It still happens. It's just that now you've got no opportunity to participate and it hurts Americans and it hurts American business.
00:34:04.110 - 00:34:22.720, Speaker B: Yeah. And actually going back to the travel rule as applied to companies like yours, one thing I did want to ask was what would you like to see in terms of how the travel rule is implemented and how this sensitive data gets passed around or even the extent of what data is passed around?
00:34:23.090 - 00:35:07.440, Speaker C: I was going to say I actually think that travel rules shouldn't apply digital assets because we have a blockchain. Since you have the blockchain and you have the forensics that lasts forever, I think we really have to question whether or not it still applies. I know that might be a little bit hard for regulators to accept, but you got to go back and think about what was the purpose of travel rule and then you have to say, what did it accomplish and how is it working? What crimes and activities is it catching today in traditional finance that are not being caught yet in crypto? And if there is a big gap there, let's go look at that gap. But to say we're just going to apply the same reasoning, I'm sorry, the same solution, without thinking about the inputs and the risks, et cetera, I think actually ties everybody up for no good reason.
00:35:08.130 - 00:35:40.342, Speaker A: I agree with Mike. I think we need a kind of crawl walk run solution here. We don't want to do a travel rule if we're forced to do it because of enforcement or holding up new licensing. I think the industry has come together that we are trying to partner and figure out the best way to partner with law enforcement and what data do they need. But I think we got to go back to the original premise. Fatif is setting global AML standards. If every either VASP or Custodian has an AML KYC obligation, we're doing proper sanctions check.
00:35:40.342 - 00:36:21.590, Speaker A: You don't need to send the data to do that. I've done it on my part and the customer on the other side has done that. Sending the data is just a risk. I don't know how it really helps law enforcement given the way our technology works. I don't know how much of a choice we're going to have in the end game. But I've been lobbying and pushing for a sensible solution and let them evaluate and come back and go, yep, this is helping law enforcement or know at the FCC and others they have to do a review of did a new rule actually help? And I think they need to do that in some of the rules that they are putting on the crypto industry. Because at the end of the day, we need to be smart about the time and resources we're putting towards this.
00:36:21.590 - 00:36:39.146, Speaker A: And if we just send a lot of data either directly to the government or to other exchanges, I don't know what it's going to do. I don't think the government looks at all the SARS and all the CTRs and Vctrs that we file today. So why are we doing reporting for the sake of reporting? Yeah.
00:36:39.168 - 00:36:45.920, Speaker B: And a SAR is I can't even speak suspicious Activity Report. A CTI, I forget what that stands for.
00:36:46.610 - 00:36:58.194, Speaker A: Currency Transaction Report, which is what AML and the travel rule and all these things were based on. When you're sending $10,000 in cash or cash equivalent, you're supposed to file a report.
00:36:58.392 - 00:37:17.750, Speaker B: So essentially the solution that you're advocating for is one in which investigators just look at the public blockchain. They have their forensics tools and then they use other tools at their disposal such as subpoenas, or they can look at the SARS reports that you file or whatever it is, and you think that that's sufficient.
00:37:18.250 - 00:37:34.926, Speaker A: I think that's fine for where we are today. I think we could get into some additional reporting, but not the way these rules are laid out. There's too many variables, there's not enough definition. And until we're at a level AML playing field, there's no way for me to know who's a trusted VASP or not.
00:37:35.028 - 00:37:35.294, Speaker C: Right.
00:37:35.332 - 00:37:57.810, Speaker A: But to get into the Swift network, you need to be approved and you need to be a regulated bank. We don't have that global solution yet and I think that's what's going to hold this up. And I think we're doing a little cart before the horse. Let's focus on if everybody is regulated properly, they're examined, we can then get to this next layer of how do we safely send information that may help law enforcement.
00:37:58.330 - 00:38:34.158, Speaker C: I think the global template is important to consider here. As know, travel rules started here in the US. But Fatif has picked it up. Countries are applying it abroad. The global financial system is getting connected right now. It used to only be available to the likes of Morgan and the large banks, but now it's available to everyone. So if the US implements this and all other countries follow suit, which is more or less the path that we're currently on, that means American taxpayer information is going to be sent out abroad in order to be compliant with both US.
00:38:34.158 - 00:39:00.940, Speaker C: And foreign policy. Does the US have control over all of the entities outside the US in terms of how they will protect that information and take care of it? I mean, we all know that of course they don't have the ability to do that. But secondarily, think about whose hands your information is going to fall into if you actually implement this. And this is something that they didn't have to think about with the current US law, but it's very much important for what's happening right now.
00:39:01.710 - 00:39:27.300, Speaker B: So as far as I understand though, this Fat of travel rule, that's like an adopted form of guidance at the moment, so it's being rolled out. I mean, I did see a report saying, yeah, that maybe like a little less than half of jurisdictions have actually begun implementing it, but it almost seems like the ship has sailed. Is that correct or do you feel like there's a way to stop it at this point?
00:39:27.670 - 00:40:07.310, Speaker A: Yeah, so they published their guidance and it's written into their guidance, but their guidance is not law. It now is up to each country to adopt those Fat If standards. And if they don't, they can end up being named or shamed that they're deficient in a number of fat if best practices. But no country is fully compliant with all of the Fat if best practices. I don't think they're going to back away from it. But I hope that the fact that they've continued to have the dialogue, they've postponed, saying that they need to take a closer look. How are companies being compliant? What are the issues with being compliant? That ongoing conversation will help us develop one of these solutions.
00:40:07.310 - 00:40:45.318, Speaker A: The fear I have is that certain countries have been reluctant to license crypto exchanges or custodians because of this Fatif rule hanging over their head. But to Mike's point, until we have a global interoperable solution, we've only solved a small piece of this puzzle. So I think we can continue to chip away at it here in the US. We are driving to adopt a rule and come up with a solution for that rule. The US travel Rule is looking to start testing in October, but it's a small subset. It's 30 VASPs here in the US. But it's a good step and it showed treasury and Finsen.
00:40:45.318 - 00:41:09.570, Speaker A: Look, we understand that rules need to apply to us. We are giving our best efforts, but we need to continue to talk about how the technology differs and what are those challenges. I think Commissioner Clayton and others had said we have a rulebook that works. We don't want to rewrite the rulebook. I think we actually need to change some of these rulebooks. We didn't have some of this technology. We didn't have decentralized smart contracts.
00:41:09.570 - 00:41:34.330, Speaker A: As a country and as a financial industry, we need to adopt. And had we stifled the Internet in the early days, we wouldn't have Amazon and the Ubers of the world that have changed and made our life easier. I think the same promise for crypto of can we move assets around the globe, cut out a lot of the middlemen and make it cheaper. We need to make sure that we continue down that path.
00:41:34.910 - 00:41:41.950, Speaker B: And so just going back to DeFi, then, what would you like to see in terms of how DeFi gets regulated?
00:41:43.090 - 00:42:32.880, Speaker A: That's a great question. I wish I had a great answer, other than, from what I've heard, the regulators are starting to turn their heads towards how do they surveil decentralized protocols, how would they apply regs and rules? Some of the recent enforcement actions have come out and said, I didn't care whether you were half DFI or partially DFI. There are some controlling people and that may fall under the securities rules. So somebody who is 100% totally decentralized? I don't know that the rules could apply, but I don't know if we have any of those yet. There are still people behind some of these protocols that help make the decisions. And I think at the end of the day, we do need better consumer protection. We need better disclosures so that consumers know what they're getting into.
00:42:32.880 - 00:42:45.970, Speaker A: But I don't know if we need to do that for AML purposes or suitability purposes. But I think the regulators here in the US are not giving up on decentralized regulation.
00:42:47.030 - 00:43:31.150, Speaker C: I also think there's a first pass of this that actually industry will take on on its own. You can't deny that there's some element of reputational risk with working with unknown parties. So industry, in order to participate at a large level, is going to need some amount of help for this. And I think they'll come out with at least part of the solution by itself. I think DeFi is too early to really say, hey, here's the prescriptive route. If we do that, we could end up with a very complicated rule set that applies to some technologies, not others, and also stifles innovation in America. But let it play out for a little while, see what industry comes up with.
00:43:31.150 - 00:43:42.318, Speaker C: If industry stays away and doesn't participate, then that might actually answer some of the questions itself. But DeFi is definitely in the earlier stages than other parts of digital assets.
00:43:42.494 - 00:44:21.054, Speaker B: Yeah, it's almost like we don't even know what it's really going to look like. So one other regulatory question I did want to ask about was, as we've seen in recent months, there have been all kinds of warnings and actions from regulators against Binance. And I did see, Jeff, that you did an interview with CoinDesk talking about how Binance US hired Brian Brooks, the former acting control of the currency. And you called that a smart move. And I just wanted to get your reading on his abrupt departure and just in general, sort of this moment in time for Binance and the kind of situation you think it's in.
00:44:21.252 - 00:45:03.550, Speaker A: Sure. So I had the privilege of working with Brian for over a year at, you know, even when he was the controller. Right. He was doing a lot to try and manage risk. Come up with a way forward for the industry to allow it some room to grow and breathe. And we'll figure out what does regulation mean? Along that know the brief conversations I had with Brian before he left? He was trying to operate a standalone business here in the US. I can only tell you what I've read out there, that it may have been falling apart around his fundraise and that he wasn't getting the funding that he was trying to achieve, and that may have led to his departure.
00:45:03.550 - 00:45:44.726, Speaker A: Brian's a smart guy. He understands both sides of that coin. And if Brian couldn't be successful, I have my doubts of who could turn that around. Look, certain firms, BitGo and Coinbase and others, we took the long road. We worked with regulators on sensible regulation that will work for this industry and others haven't. And I think the level playing field is starting to happen now that you can outrun the long arm of the US. And we've seen some of those enforcement actions, and that the best thing for the crypto industry is sensible regulation where people feel trust and that their assets are safe.
00:45:44.726 - 00:46:05.086, Speaker A: And that's one of the things that Bico focuses on in our cold storage and safety of our customer assets. So I don't have too much to add in there. I'm looking forward to see what Brian does next. But I think long term, we need firms to embrace regulation that helps the entire yeah, okay.
00:46:05.188 - 00:46:29.190, Speaker B: Yeah. So maybe the writing is on the wall for Binance. I guess we'll have to see how that plays out. All right, so let's talk about BitCo. There's been so much regulatory news. Obviously having you here on the show was good opportunity to cover that, but obviously Bico had the big news about the $1.2 billion acquisition by Galaxy, and that was the first crypto deal greater than $1 billion.
00:46:29.190 - 00:46:35.050, Speaker B: And I was wondering, Mike, if you wanted to talk a little bit about why you thought that was the right move for Bico.
00:46:35.710 - 00:47:09.634, Speaker C: Sure. Well, we've seen a tremendous growth on the institutional space within the last twelve months. Bico has been after institutions, businesses, kind of this side of the client segment since our beginnings. And in some ways you could argue that maybe BitCo institutional access was too early, back in 20, 13, 14. But this last year we finally started to see it's really growing. To get there, we want to do more. So Galaxy has also been after the institutional mission.
00:47:09.634 - 00:47:42.080, Speaker C: They've got a fantastic team that a lot of them come out of traditional finance. They've got a great trading product, they've got great investment products. The combination of these two firms is going to take the tech that BitCo's got, apply it to the knowledge that they've got, and really hit hard on the institutional space. So we're building a very strong industry leading technology company. I don't think there's anyone in a better position to build a technology first prime brokerage for the future. And that's what we're after to do.
00:47:42.450 - 00:48:15.740, Speaker B: And talk a little bit about kind of where the institutional market is at. There was a period in a long time ago, like 2017, when we would often hear the phrase the wall of institutional money is coming. Didn't quite happen back when people originally said that. And then it looks like it's actually started to pick up maybe in the last year or so. But I was wondering, just what are you seeing now? How are different institutional investors thinking about the space and what are they interested in?
00:48:16.270 - 00:49:04.870, Speaker C: Well, I think even when you and I spoke, I always said it would never be a wall, it would be like just a growth. And I think that's what we've seen. The line has been heavy this last six, nine months, which is great, but of course it's not some binary on off switch step function that's going to happen. But no, I think the backdrop of Coronavirus actually has had pretty much everybody on the planet rethinking their portfolios and what they mean. Secondarily, with Bitcoin now over ten years running, I mean, frankly, how much money are you going to put into a system? And it's only five years old and people have all these questions, whether it's regulatory or technical or security. It was just hard back then. Today a lot of those objections are gone, but we now also have a very uncertain future in terms of the traditional assets.
00:49:04.870 - 00:49:57.594, Speaker C: So anybody that's been building a portfolio on a 60 40 mix of stocks and bonds transitioning over time, they have to rethink it. Obviously the stock market has had a very good run in recent years, and everyone attributes this to money being super cheap, incredibly cheap, and printing a lot of it, and everybody's waiting for the shoe to drop on that. We know it's going to happen sometime, we just don't know when and we don't know how bad. On the bond side, outside of the US. I mean it's negative yields completely even inside the know you can't make any money off of cash. So people are looking for an alternative. And if you have a model that requires you to return money to your retirees or investors, you're thinking like how am I going to meet that model? We've got pension funds that are going to go belly up unless they figure out something to do.
00:49:57.594 - 00:50:46.998, Speaker C: They simply will not have the funds that they are legally required to distribute to their investors. So to crypto's surprise, yeah, some of the most conservative assets out there, investors out there in retirement space with endowments and with pension funds, they are absolutely looking at crypto. So all of this has made it so that pretty much every sector of institutional, whether you're talking about hedge funds, whether you're talking about long term investments, whether you're talking about family offices or high net worth, everybody's looking at digital assets now. The more aggressive of those already have made their investments, and we just see more coming. So I think that's why this last twelve months have been so strong for crypto and digital assets.
00:50:47.174 - 00:50:59.790, Speaker B: And as you see this part of the industry develop, how do you think the institutional part of this industry can compete with traditional financial services firms that are trying to get into crypto?
00:51:00.130 - 00:51:30.938, Speaker C: Oh well, I mean that's the great thing about what we're doing. This is software. And software, when it gets into an industry it has a pattern of completely upending it. So we get to rethink how pretty much everything works. And I ask questions all the time of people, I say, hey, who here? Raise your hand if you love your bank. And nobody ever raises their hand. The fact is that these institutions on the traditional side were built a very long time ago before we had technology.
00:51:30.938 - 00:52:22.886, Speaker C: And then through regulation and through conservatism being conservative, they just haven't gotten to where people want it to be. We now have a global society. We are connected informationally in ways we've never been connected before and we need a financial system that's for the future. So the other thing that's mean we're lucky we're here in the US. We might be concerned about fiscal policy here, but if you're abroad you have real questions depending on where you live about whether the money that you earned yesterday is going to be useful to you tomorrow. And this happens over and over again when people are in charge. So can we use computers to apply fiscal policy in a way that frankly humans aren't as good at doing? I've said this one before, which is I think exciting.
00:52:22.886 - 00:52:54.980, Speaker C: I think the longest standing, unchanged fiscal policy in the history of mankind is bitcoin. Think of any society, anywhere that had a fiscal policy that stayed constant as for a period of a decade, I don't think it's happened. So that's a tremendous opportunity for what the future can hold. And it also comes with transparency and it also comes with smart contracts. We can barely even imagine all of the combinations of better service that we're going to get going down the line.
00:52:55.750 - 00:53:17.290, Speaker B: And the crypto markets have really ballooned this year, with the total crypto markets hitting $2 trillion again recently. A year ago they were at less than $500 billion. And as the industry grows, and as companies such as yours begin custing larger amounts of crypto, such as perhaps one day $1 trillion worth or more, how does that affect security practices?
00:53:18.510 - 00:53:57.474, Speaker C: Oh, great question. At our roots is security. It's where we started really kind of at a nuts and bolts level. You're never done with security, you just keep raising the bar. So one thing that's happened in terms of bringing more people into the space is we've had to address how do you secure assets for Fiduciaries that are holding money on behalf of other people? So we're huge believers in the benefits of decentralization, but we also want the industry to be able to participate everywhere, which sometimes requires more centralized storage. Would you want a trillion dollars stored in a single wallet or under a single vendor? Not really. Right.
00:53:57.474 - 00:54:26.482, Speaker C: So we've got to split that apart with backstops and insurance and ways to handle disasters. The industry is getting smart about this and we're seeing it. So crypto technology is going to get better. It's going to allow us to have decentralized holding of assets. It'll be interesting to see how regulation and legislation keeps up with that. Imagine a multi SIG wallet today that has a key in the United States, a key in Canada and a key in Europe. Whose jurisdiction is that? I don't know the answer to that question.
00:54:26.482 - 00:55:05.886, Speaker C: I'm not trying to be difficult for the regulators, but do people want their money protected by the judicial system of multiple countries? Absolutely they do. And it gets much more complicated than that. So we'll see things get more decentralized. And in terms of having any single vendor with trillion dollar wallets, of course we have to kick back ups to that. Part of what's happening is you're seeing safety funds get built and a couple of protocols have had safety funds that they actually needed to exercise. It's early days, there's still been some technology failures, some security holes. Right.
00:55:05.886 - 00:55:26.802, Speaker C: But I think we're going to find ways with technology where certain amounts of profit is held in publicly visible safety funds. And this is basically insurance, but now you can see it on chain and it's kind of as you go, you build it. I think we're going to get good at this over time and it's going to create a safer financial system in the end.
00:55:26.936 - 00:56:04.560, Speaker B: Well, speaking of binance, I guess that was one of the first exchanges that did that, right? Yeah, that's right. So now switching gears, wrapped bitcoin is a staple in bico's business and wrapped bitcoin actually accounts for more than 1% of bitcoin's circulating supply. And obviously we're seeing people wrap their bitcoin so that they can participate in DFI on ethereum, mostly to chase yield. Have you seen the drivers of that change in any way? Especially since we're not in the kind of crazy DeFi summer that we were in last year?
00:56:05.730 - 00:56:43.758, Speaker C: It hasn't really come down. It goes up and down with price, I suppose, but in terms of the number of coins you can see, actually, it hasn't really come down significantly. I think it's got real utility in terms of a centralized storage of this. As it grows, we're going to have to do other things, whether that means splitting across custodians in a still central way or hopefully get to more of a decentralized technology for holding it. One of these things is going to happen. You simply don't want to wrap all of the world's bitcoin and then have a big honeypot. We work too hard to decentralize this to create that model, so it will change.
00:56:43.758 - 00:57:08.386, Speaker C: One interesting thing that's happened as well there, though, and it's related to anything that's a stablecoin, and of course, WBTC is a stablecoin of bitcoin as opposed to a stablecoin of dollars is what happens when things go wrong. There was a hack at some, I'm forgetting which one it was, it was just a few weeks ago, and some wrap bitcoin, no fault of wrap bitcoin, but a smart contract was hacked and.
00:57:08.408 - 00:57:10.920, Speaker B: Then they reached the poly network one, I think.
00:57:11.290 - 00:57:12.006, Speaker A: There we go.
00:57:12.028 - 00:57:12.920, Speaker B: Thank you. Yeah.
00:57:13.850 - 00:58:04.034, Speaker C: And they reach out to us to freeze the asset. And the wrap bitcoin smart contract does not have a capability to freeze. We did not want that responsibility. We think that's a centralized digital asset technology that we don't want now when most of the US dollar backed stablecoins are implemented, they pretty much all have freeze capabilities behind them. What this means is that there's a single party that can freeze any asset regardless of where it is in the world. And this is a little bit like taking your email and instead of storing it, personally storing it now at Google and then having someone subpoena it from Google instead of from you, the same thing is happening with stablecoins. So this is an interesting development.
00:58:04.034 - 00:58:13.420, Speaker C: I can see why regulators might like that, that's one stop shopping. But in terms of centralization, I think it's not really the direction that we want to be in.
00:58:14.430 - 00:58:34.850, Speaker B: So another hot topic right now is NFTs, and we are seeing investors, including a number of hedge funds, that have been investing in these digital collectibles. And I wondered, do you see BitCo ever doing something like custodying NFTs? And if so, how would that differ from custodying traditional crypto assets?
00:58:35.750 - 00:59:09.020, Speaker C: Absolutely we do. I mean, custodians can hold all kinds of things from art to fire trucks, so there's no reason why we wouldn't do that. It's an emerging space. I think it's just getting started. The early days of NFTs, people associate with art. You're starting to see people realize, wait a minute, this is about proof of ownership and providence, right? As those things come true, a custodian is perfect solution. So of course we'll be supporting NFTs in a myriad of ways and helping people secure them.
00:59:10.510 - 00:59:28.500, Speaker B: Another big trend this year has been well, actually last year and early this year has been corporate treasuries holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets. And I noticed actually in the last few months, this has been kind of more rare of a news story. And I wondered if you had any insight into what the slowdown was.
00:59:29.830 - 01:00:10.590, Speaker C: I think it's still pretty difficult to put on your corp balance mean the two big prominent ones. We've got MicroStrategy, obviously he's got a corporate strategy around being a Bitcoin asset to and of itself. You've got Tesla, which I also think Bitcoin is very much a for the people type of thing. Elon has built a tremendous brand that people love. It doesn't surprise me at all that he would associate with Bitcoin as a way to build his brand. But I don't think most companies really want to have commodities on their balance sheet. It's not to say that Bitcoin isn't a great commodity.
01:00:10.590 - 01:00:23.762, Speaker C: We carry a lot on our balance sheet, but that's because we're in the space and we know what we're doing. Typically you don't see companies really investing in gold or other things. So that could change as the monetary situation in the US.
01:00:23.816 - 01:00:24.130, Speaker B: Changes.
01:00:24.200 - 01:00:43.050, Speaker C: If you really do need to get away from Fiat, which I think is going to be a growing concern, but in terms of why companies have done it so far, I think it's been more about kind of the brand wins and positioning than it is about actually wanting to have assets on the balance sheet.
01:00:43.550 - 01:01:05.970, Speaker B: Okay, well, so I know you can't talk too much about the Galaxy acquisition, but obviously you have an important role in the industry. And I just wondered, from your perspective, where do you think the industry will go through the rest of the year? Or what do you expect to be the major storylines? And this is a question for both Mike and Jeff.
01:01:06.470 - 01:01:08.098, Speaker C: Jeff, you want to take this one?
01:01:08.264 - 01:01:53.646, Speaker A: Sure. So we're excited about the merger and we can't get into too many specifics, but both Mike and I will have prominent roles at the combined firm. I think Mike said it early, right? It's Silicon Valley meeting up with Wall Street, and that's a powerful combination. They're very good at trading, we're good at security and custody. They've got a number of businesses, asset management, investment banking, and the combined effort of those two. If you really want to do prime brokerage, prime brokerage infrastructure, you need a custodian to do that. And the combination of the two players will be a force to reckon with as the institutional adoption grows and as we get more creative in this space you just mentioned NFTs, right.
01:01:53.646 - 01:02:02.594, Speaker A: There's a whole host of new and emerging technologies and ones that haven't even been thought of that will end up on the blockchain. So we hope to be a player in all of them.
01:02:02.792 - 01:02:40.080, Speaker C: Mike so I think we're going to enter a great build phase. I think in general, the interest is here to stay. I don't see it going away. The institutional interest in digital assets is not wavering at all, in spite of the price drop, really, it's more about timing. It's about continuing to figuring out logistics of how they're going to participate and how they're going to provide that to their clients. So it's all good. And then with DFI evolving, with NFTs coming with the next wave of layer two on the bitcoin side, this is going to be a great couple of years of build and grow.
01:02:40.080 - 01:02:58.360, Speaker C: I don't think we're really going to enter into a crypto winter quite like what we entered before because I think we've reached a critical mass. That's not to say it's not going to be volatile, it's going to be hugely volatile, but I don't think we're going to quite see kind of the two year bearish period that we've seen in the past.
01:02:58.730 - 01:03:15.370, Speaker B: Yeah, I've actually been thinking the same things because it's almost like the space is getting too diversified now for that to happen. Well, we'll see if we were right or wrong to check back in a couple of years. Yeah. All right. Well, where can people learn more about each of you and Bico?
01:03:16.110 - 01:03:35.230, Speaker C: Easy to find Bico.com. And as we move to galaxy, it's galaxydigital IO. So, anyway, happy to connect. You can find us there. I think Jeff is easy to find there as well and happy to answer questions for anybody that's got them perfect.
01:03:35.380 - 01:03:38.666, Speaker B: All right, well, thank you both so much for coming on Unchained.
01:03:38.858 - 01:03:40.750, Speaker A: Thank you, Laura. It was a pleasure.
01:03:41.250 - 01:03:52.290, Speaker B: Thanks so much for joining us today. To learn more about Mike, Jeff and Bicol, check out the show notes for this episode. Unchained is produced by me, Laura Shin, with help from Anthony Yoon, Daniel Ness and Mark Murdoch. Thanks for listening.
