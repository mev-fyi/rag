00:01:15.410 - 00:01:22.470, Speaker B: Today's guest is Justin Drake, researcher at the Ethereum Foundation. Welcome, Justin.
00:01:22.890 - 00:01:25.000, Speaker A: Hi, Laura. Thanks for having me. Again.
00:01:25.530 - 00:01:41.020, Speaker B: Congrats on a successful merge. This was a truly exciting event, a huge deal in the world of crypto. Tell us about your experience of the merge. What were you feeling beforehand and what did you feel once the transition happened?
00:01:41.390 - 00:02:35.786, Speaker A: I was a little nervous, to be fair, beforehand. Maybe the day before, I started feeling, hey, this is real. For a long time, it was just theoretical, and it's been so long that I've been used to thinking that it's in the future. But no, it was actually coming in terms of how I felt in the moment. I was extremely tired, and the reason is that we almost pulled a whole all nighter with the ultrasound money team. We were pushing as hard as we could to get this feature where you could basically track the supply after the merge and see how much it had decreased or increased relative to the point of the merge. And actually, my partner, who's here right next to me, Alex, Tessa, michael just pulled a whole all nighter, and so he's kind of the hero that we deserve.
00:02:35.786 - 00:03:16.540, Speaker A: And I am just so, so impressed by how the merge went, just so impressed by all the devs. As a researcher, I'm powerless, right. Because my job, in a way, was to help write the specs. And that was done two years ago, and so now it really all laid in the hands of the client developers and the node operators, and both have done a really steady job. The merge has gone way better than I expected. Participation rate is over 98%, which is really, really good. We haven't had any disruptions that I really know of.
00:03:16.540 - 00:03:18.666, Speaker A: Nothing major.
00:03:18.848 - 00:03:47.970, Speaker B: Wow. Yeah. It's really quite an achievement, and it definitely I mean, for someone who's not technical, just even from what I read, it seemed like everything was extremely smooth. So congratulations to you all. And I was curious, now that Ethereum is in this proof of stake world, is this sort of, like, done, or are there issues that you and other core devs are kind of watching out for to just make sure everything really went smoothly?
00:03:48.130 - 00:04:34.450, Speaker A: Yeah, so we'll be keeping an eye on participation rate. We'll also be keeping an eye on possible unexpected forks. So it could be that one of the consensus clients or maybe one of the execution clients kind of starts misbehaving, and so we would see some fraction of the validators going off on a separate fork. And actually, if it happens to one of the execution clients, one of the minor execution clients, that could give us insight into the distribution because it's relatively easy to tell the distribution of consensus clients, and actually there's a website clientiversity.org which gives us that distribution. But for the execution clients, that's much more hidden. But ironically, when there are failures, it allows us to glean into this distribution of execution clients.
00:04:34.870 - 00:04:40.482, Speaker B: And so for how long will you be watching that before you guys feel confident that this really went off without a hitch?
00:04:40.626 - 00:05:13.882, Speaker A: The way that the Lindy effect works, in my opinion, is kind of logarithmic. So the fact that the merge was successful for 1 second is already a huge breakthrough. The fact that it was successful 1 minute is a huge breakthrough. Ten minutes, a whole day, a whole week, a whole month, a whole year. And I think if it can survive the next few days, the next few weeks, next few months, this is high, high confidence that this is reliable. I must also highlight that the proof of stake chain has been running for a very long period of time. It's been running for over a year and a half now.
00:05:13.882 - 00:05:33.910, Speaker A: It's the most secure blockchain in the world. Now it has $20 billion of economic security. And also, unlike proof of work chains, it has the ability to recover from 51% attacks, thanks to slashing the ability to identify and remove attackers if and when there is an attack.
00:05:34.060 - 00:05:46.378, Speaker B: Yeah, and just to draw that out, it's because, in contrast, in a proof of work system, they would still have their equipment, so it's kind of, like, harder to keep them off the network. Is that the implication there?
00:05:46.464 - 00:06:44.058, Speaker A: That's correct. When you are under attack in proof of work, you cannot distinguish the good guys from the bad guys. All the hash rate is fungible, and so you can't just target the data centers of an attacker and kind of remotely burn them down. But this is effectively what we're able to do with proof of stake, because every unit of stake is identified and can be removed from the system either automatically. For example, in the context of two inconsistent finalized points there's an automatic process whereby anyone who voted on both sides of these finalized chains will get automatically slashed. And there's also a process, if required, called social slashing, whereby as a community we kind of observe, for example, that there's been censorship on the chain and we can react with a soft fork or hard fork that removes the attacker from the chain.
00:06:44.234 - 00:07:37.434, Speaker B: So I'm glad that you brought up this comparison to proof of work, because I'm sure you're very well aware that bitcoiners have long said that proof of stake can lead to more centralization. And as you probably know, even ethereum core developer Danny Ryan pointed out that one of those possible vectors would be the liquid staking derivatives market. People are saying that's a market that will tend to be more like winner take all. And obviously people will have a huge incentive to try to get liquidity out of their staked ether. And I did notice that already, Martin Coppelman, who he's obviously an ethereum person, he's been involved in the community for years. He tweeted that of the first 1000 blocks, 420 were validated by either lido or coinbase. So are you concerned about the potential centralization that liquid staking derivatives providers might cause in ethereum?
00:07:37.562 - 00:08:19.542, Speaker A: So zooming out on the comparison of centralization between proof of work and proof of stake. There are really big strong points for proof of stake. Specifically, one of them is that the barrier to entry to becoming a staker is actually very, very low. It's on the order of one e, let's say, or even less than one e. On the other hand, if you want to be a profitable miner, you need to make a multimillion dollar investment. And this is because there are economies of scale when you work with proof of work. And this is actually a second source of centralization because it means that the largest miners get the largest deals on the hardware, for example, or on the electricity, and they're able to gobble up all the other miners.
00:08:19.542 - 00:08:50.690, Speaker A: And actually this is something we're seeing right now. The proof of work. Miners are in the context of bitcoin are under stress. There's mergers and acquisitions happening and the big fish are eating up the small fish. Now, on the topic of liquid staking, it is true that people do want liquidity on their stake. And so far we've had exchanges that can provide this as a centralized service. And we've had more decentralized pools.
00:08:50.690 - 00:09:26.078, Speaker A: So we've had lido, as you highlight. We've had rocket pool. Now, the good news about lido and rocket pool is that they're very decentralized. If you look at lido, it's composed of, I forget exactly, but I think 28 operators. So the stake is actually not controlled by one operator, it's distributed. The lido itself is a dow, which is governed by a token. And in the long run, it will be especially difficult to attack lido.
00:09:26.078 - 00:10:34.242, Speaker A: One of the reasons is that the risk which, for example, is smart contract risk. What if there's a bug in? The smart contract will go away over time as the lindy of Lido increases. And also the Lido project is setting up this idea of the staked ETH token holders to put forward vetoes to any consensus decisions that are made by the LDO token holders. So even if the LDO token is subject to a 51% attack, they can't push through bad governance changes because those will get vetoed. Now, we still do want a huge amount of competition. We don't want to be in a position where there's one or handful of these decentralized staking pools. And this is something that I've done a little bit of research in, and it turns out that it is possible to simultaneously be a solo validator from home and to benefit from liquid staking.
00:10:34.242 - 00:10:52.310, Speaker A: Basically the ability of turning your stake teeth into a liquid token and being able to sell them at any point that you want. This is infrastructure that is still at the research level, but I expect that over time we're going to have more and more options and more and more decentralized options to have liquidity over your stake.
00:10:52.470 - 00:11:27.446, Speaker B: All right, there's just so many issues there. There's so much we could impact. Probably it would take another show, but there's also many other things that we can discuss about this transition. So we're going to cover all those later. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible. To swap crypto, a user has to choose among hundreds of DEXes on multiple networks, all offering different rates and fees.

Another issue that has been discussed a lot is mev or maximal extractable value. And I saw that someone who I think takes a certain kind of more anti mev view p McGoon tweeted that post merge Sandwich attacks had actually drastically dropped. I'm not sure how long that will last, but I was curious how you thought the merge would affect me.
00:12:30.590 - 00:13:47.534, Speaker A: Right so right now, well, pre merge, most of the mev went through Flashbots and there was these private auctions happening and that allowed for toxic mev like front running and Sandwiching to happen post merge. I think right now it's a minority of people that are using the Flashbot's infrastructure or proposer builder separation. And so what's happening is that they're not extracting as much value as they could, and in particular, they're not extracting some of that toxic mev. What I expect to happen is that ultimately, the incentives to participate in proposal builder separation will kind of dominate. And over time, more and more people will play this game of basically proposing blocks that are built externally by sophisticated so called builders that can extract as much value as possible from the blocks. Now, there's two pieces of good news in terms of the long term vision of PBS. One is that we have this research gadget which is called mev smoothing, is this idea that as a proposer, you don't get to pick the type of block that you select from the builder market.
00:13:47.534 - 00:14:52.040, Speaker A: You have to pick a specific block and you have to pick the highest paying block. And so that removes the discretionary power that proposers might have to do bad things like censorship. The other really exciting gadget is this idea of an encrypted mempool. It is that when you make a transaction on chain, before you broadcast it to the mempool, you encrypt it, it gets broadcast to the mempool, it gets included on chain, and only after it's been included on chain does it get decrypted. And so that removes the vast majority of toxic mev, which is only made possible because the sandwichers and the block builders can see the contents of the transaction. So once you remove that, you remove most of the mev. And what you're left with in terms of mev is the so called good mev, things like Arbitrage, things like liquidations, which are useful for the proper functioning of DeFi and don't directly harm any specific one.
00:14:52.490 - 00:14:58.646, Speaker B: Oh, okay. I think this is the first time I'm hearing that that was on the roadmap. Is it on the roadmap?
00:14:58.758 - 00:15:40.842, Speaker A: Well, one of the interesting things is that it doesn't have to happen in consensus on Ethereum layer one. Instead, it could happen for each individual roll up. So, for example, Arbitrum is looking to do something like that where they have these encrypted transactions that get decrypted in a batch after the batch has been included on chain. And they have so called threshold decryption, where they have a committee where when a majority of the committee decides to decrypt the batch, that's when it happens. And so no single bad actor within the committee can preemptively decrypt and front run the transactions inside. Okay?
00:15:40.896 - 00:15:45.850, Speaker B: So at the moment, it's not something that will be built into layer one on ethereum.
00:15:46.350 - 00:16:39.350, Speaker A: It's something that could be built into layer one. One of the things that we want to try and avoid in layer one is so called threshold assumptions, this idea that you need at least one half or at least two thirds of the actors to be participating in a specific way. The good news is that there is this form of encryption which doesn't have a threshold assumption, which is called delay encryption. It's this idea that you encrypt your transaction and then automatically after a period of time, it could be 10 seconds or it could be 20 seconds or 1 minute. This is configurable, the transaction gets decrypted. So the flow would be you send your delay encrypted transaction, it gets included on chain, and then once it's been included, kind of a few seconds later, automatically decrypts without the need of a committee or a threshold assumption.
00:16:39.510 - 00:17:07.762, Speaker B: All right, so we're going to just switch topics slightly because I myself just did an interview with a mainstream news outlet and what they were interested in was what this shift meant for bitcoin. And I know you started as a bitcoiner, you may still consider yourself one. And I wondered what you thought ethereum's transition of proof of stake and its decreased environmental footprint does in terms of pressure on bitcoin to also make a similar shift.
00:17:07.906 - 00:17:31.370, Speaker A: Right, so there is this, say I forget who said it, it could have been Anthony Sasano, which is that bitcoin is the idea and ethereum is the execution. And one of the things that hall said 13 years ago was that he was looking into ways to make bitcoin more energy efficient.
00:17:31.790 - 00:17:33.386, Speaker B: You're talking about Hal Finney?
00:17:33.498 - 00:17:57.510, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. And it's widely thought that Hal Finney could be Satoshi. And I personally believe that is the most likely candidate. And here we are 13 years later, after Hall Finney kind of wrote this. We now have basically a more secure version of ethereum which doesn't consume nearly as much electricity. It consumes roughly 5000 times less than bitcoin.
00:17:58.570 - 00:18:18.230, Speaker B: And I'm sure you're aware that also recently in bitcoin there's been this interesting trend where a number of previously hardcore bitcoiners have kind of come out against bitcoin maximalism. And I wondered now that ETH will likely be deflationary, what do you think happens to bitcoin's narrative as digital gold?
00:18:18.390 - 00:19:35.540, Speaker A: Right, so from a cultural standpoint, what I think is happening is that the bitcoin maximalists are becoming more and more extreme in their maximalism and the ethereums are just staying very, very open, which they have been since the very beginning. We have a culture of openness and welcoming. And so what's happening is that everyone in the middle is kind of gradually moving away. So Vitalik started as a bitcoiner and he moved away, I started as a bitcoiner, I moved away. And now we're kind of moving through this spectrum of kind of maximalism and one by one there's a brain drain towards ethereum and away from bitcoin. Now, I think that bitcoin was an amazing experiment for the world and it kind of showed us the way in terms of getting bootstrapped with key ideas for settlement layers. But I really do believe that moving forward, ethereum will be the settlement layer for the internet of value, and that looking back a century into the future, bitcoin might not have been the success that it could have been had the culture been slightly different.
00:19:36.310 - 00:19:43.942, Speaker B: And can you flesh out that vision a little bit when you say that Ethereum will be the settlement layer for the Internet of value? What does that look like?
00:19:44.076 - 00:20:44.582, Speaker A: The purpose of blockchains as a product is to deliver secure block space. And you have these network effects at play because the most secure block space is going to be the one that attracts all the applications. And we know now with research in sharding and roll ups that we can have a single blockchain scale to, let's say, 10 million transactions a second. And that's enough for every single person on Earth to do 100 transactions a second. And so if the scalability roadmap is correct, then there should be a winner take all dynamics where everyone builds on top of the most secure blockchain. And already today Ethereum is now four times more secure than Bitcoin in terms of economic security. It has roughly $20 billion of economic security versus Bitcoin's 5 billion.
00:20:44.582 - 00:21:38.006, Speaker A: And proof of stake, as I mentioned previously, has this magical ability to identify and remove attackers if and when there is a 51% attack. And what I think will happen over time is that as Ether increases its monetary premium and as the cash flows of Ethereum through the fee burn increase, the market cap of Ethereum will be and therefore the economic security of Ethereum will become so large that even nation states are not in a position to attack Ethereum. And at that point, Ethereum will become effectively part of the substrate of the Internet itself and it will be hopefully settling the Internet of value, which today we're seeing as DeFi, but is also going to include non financial applications such as ENS.
00:21:38.198 - 00:21:52.950, Speaker B: All right, so I just have to ask this. As you know, there was a lot of noise made by this Ethereum proof of work team that they were going to fork and launch a proof of work chain today. And I was wondering what you thought of that effort.
00:21:53.130 - 00:22:38.686, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I haven't been following very closely, but it seemed like the effort was extremely unprofessional. They made a lot of very basic technical mistakes and it seemed to be like the cheerleaders seemed to be some of the less savory community members. And I just saw on Twitter, I don't know if this is correct, but apparently Justin Sun and Poloniax have decided to declare the real Ethereum proof of work token to be yet another chain. So now there's two Ethereum proof of work chains that are competing with each other and it's a great big mess. I don't expect any of these proof of work chains to really have much legitimacy and therefore much value in the market.
00:22:38.868 - 00:22:44.638, Speaker B: And will that cause any technical problems for Ethereum under proof of stake or the users?
00:22:44.814 - 00:23:22.330, Speaker A: It doesn't cause problems, but I do want to highlight one thing, which is that if these blockchains are not configured properly, then there could be a risk to interacting with them. Specifically. What could happen is what's called a replay attack. So for example, if you want to try and sell your ETH proof of work tokens within a proof of work token and they haven't properly done the replay protection, then you'd also be doing the same exact transaction on the main chain itself. So be very careful if you do plan to sell these tokens. And keep in mind replay protection.
00:23:24.990 - 00:23:44.318, Speaker B: Like you said, you have been working on this for years and the part that you were really involved in is a while back. So I was wondering if you could give us some highlights of what Ethereum's Roadmap will be going forward, what the next focus areas are, and especially how any of those might help users dealing with, for instance, high gas fees.
00:23:44.494 - 00:24:45.282, Speaker A: So I think there's two big themes in the roadmap. One is this massive feature that we want to deploy, which is known as Sharding or bank Sharding, and that is going to dramatically increase the scalability of roll ups by roughly 100 x. And then there's this other kind of long tail of incremental security upgrades that we want to do and there's about a dozen of those. And I think the strategy moving forward is to try and focus on the big feature Sharding, unless we feel like there really is a pressing need to address some of the security weaknesses in the short term. So one example is secret leader election right now on the beacon chain. Every single validator address, and therefore IP address is known ahead of time. When you're proposing a block, the whole world knows that you will be proposing the next block.
00:24:45.282 - 00:25:30.482, Speaker A: And so it's possible for an attacker to perform a distributed denial of service attack using the networking and we can patch these attacks if we feel they're important. But if there are no attacks that really happen, I think the main focus will be proto Dank Sharding, which is the first step towards full Dank Sharding. As we know, Ethereum development is fairly slow, but I expect that these initial steps will happen in the months to come, maybe six to twelve months, and there will be some amount of relief with proto Dank Sharding now that the devs can move away their focus from the merge to the next big feature, which is Sharding.
00:25:30.626 - 00:25:37.480, Speaker B: And the Dink sharding is a way of kind of lightning the data load. How would you define it?
00:25:37.870 - 00:26:17.670, Speaker A: Yeah, so there's two resources, computational resources that blockchains provide. One is data availability, which you can think of it as bandwidth, and the other one is execution. And really what we're doing is we're dramatically increasing the bandwidth of the chain so we can just put more data on chain and have this strong data availability guarantees around it. And it turned out that rollups the resource that they consume is data availability to a large extent and almost little execution. Almost no execution. And Ethereum today provides enough execution for roll ups. So really, the focus is primarily on data availability.
00:26:18.170 - 00:26:30.780, Speaker B: All right, well, this is just such a great recap of what happened and where things are going and what this means for the space. I so appreciate that you took the time. I hope you get some sleep after this.
00:26:32.190 - 00:26:34.634, Speaker A: Thank you. Yes, we will sleep a lot.
00:26:34.832 - 00:26:40.490, Speaker B: And again, congratulations. This is a huge achievement. I think everybody in Ethereum should be very proud.
00:26:41.470 - 00:26:44.186, Speaker A: Thank you so much for having me. Bye.

Celsius CEO dreams up a Hail Mary to skepticism celsius CEO Alex Machinsky is pushing for a revival of the firm, according to a leaked recording handed to a Celsius customer who also gave it to The New York Times. According to the NYT, Machinsky outlined the plan in a meeting with employees last week. The CEO wants to revamp the company, building a business focused on crypto custody and charging fees on certain types of transactions. The plan's name, Kelvin Mishinski, compared his firm's bankruptcy to other companies'bankruptcies. Does it make the PEPC taste less good? He asked employees.
00:28:11.414 - 00:28:43.650, Speaker B: Delta filed for bankruptcy. Do you not fly Delta because they filed for bankruptcy? Thomas Brazil, bankruptcy expert, called the plan a joke and encouraged Mishinsky to step down. He also said Delta is not a financial firm that operates on faith or trust. That's the big difference between financial and non financial bankruptcies. Even though Machinsky seemed enthusiastic. The plan would require approval by Federal Judge Martin Glenn. In addition, the creditor committee has serious concerns about it and also about Machinsky's involvement with Celsius.
00:28:43.650 - 00:29:48.806, Speaker B: On Wednesday, the judge approved an order to appoint a neutral third party as an examiner of Celsius's financials. Using an examiner in Chapter Eleven bankruptcies is not very common. Lastly, on Monday, two lawyers from the Federal Trade Commission requested permission to represent the regulator in Celsius's bankruptcy case, though it's unclear what the agency's intention is. Treasury allows recovery of tornado cash funds, but leaves open questions. On Tuesday, the US Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, updated its Frequently Asked Questions or FAQ document, which provides guidance on how to remain compliant with the sanctions against tornado cash. As per the updated document, american citizens who used the virtual currency mixer before sanctions were implemented will be able to apply for a license to recover the locked funds. OFAC also provided an update on the issue of celebrities and famous crypto community members being dusted with small amounts of ETH from tornado cash and said it will not prioritize enforcement against them.
00:29:48.806 - 00:30:45.434, Speaker B: However, OFAC did not address the sanctions compliance responsibilities of various participants involved in validating transactions under proof of stake the exact questions many members of the crypto community have been debating since the sanctions. This week, crypto venture capital firm Paradigm laid out legal arguments against the sanctions on tornado cash. The company said, we believe that under current Ofat guidance base layer, participants are not required to monitor or censor these addresses as part of a risk based sanctions compliance program. According to blockchain security firms Pexhield and Certic, a hacker laundered $500,000 through tornado cash on Tuesday. The exploit happened in August of 2021 due to a bug in the dow makers smart contract. A South Korean court wants Do Kwan arrested. A court in South Korea issued an arrest warrant against Doe Kwan, CEO of TerraForm Labs and founder of the failed Terra Blockchain last month.
00:30:45.434 - 00:31:28.634, Speaker B: Kwon said in an interview with Coinage that he was not being sought by investigators. However, after the news of the arrest warrant broke, Coinage tweeted that Kwon told the media outlet he has yet to receive any warrant from Korean prosecutors.
