00:00:00.804 - 00:00:25.494, Speaker B: Heads up, everyone. This recording is a bit shorter than usual because it originally featured two guests.

If you're watching on video, you may notice some discrepancies since we had to rerecord a few questions. However, hopefully tweaks to the audio make for seamless listening. Despite this snafu, this turned out to be a great episode code.

Laura, the link is in the description. Today's guest is Peoplepleaser, a digital artist who has dropped quite a few popular NFTs over the past six months. Welcome, Peoplepleaser.
00:02:03.350 - 00:02:05.266, Speaker A: Hi, thanks for having us.
00:02:05.448 - 00:02:12.120, Speaker B: Let's start with you telling us what it is that you used to do before crypto, how you got into crypto, and what it is you do now.
00:02:13.850 - 00:02:43.178, Speaker A: Hi. So basically I'm a digital artist. I specialize in sort of like 3D animation. I've been doing it for the past six years plus. And previously I was working in sort of film and television and commercials. Also was on the cinematics team at Blizzard. And then starting last summer, I got into working with collaborating with DeFi protocols and just working crypto and also making NFTs.
00:02:43.178 - 00:02:47.506, Speaker A: And so that's what I'm doing full time today. Yeah.
00:02:47.528 - 00:03:10.170, Speaker B: And one thing I love about your story is that kind of what maybe I don't know if it was the precipitating event, but you had accepted a job at Apple and then that got rescinded because of the pandemic. And basically after that you stumbled into crypto. And so your life, I think, would be quite different if you ended up with that job at Apple.
00:03:10.590 - 00:03:18.570, Speaker A: We would not have be having this conversation right now and I would probably just be rendering iPhones somewhere in Northern California.
00:03:19.390 - 00:03:23.520, Speaker B: And you would definitely not be allowed to talk about your work, I'm pretty sure.
00:03:24.130 - 00:03:25.360, Speaker A: Probably not.
00:03:25.970 - 00:03:44.820, Speaker B: We can maybe talk about your Uniswap V Three video first. I mean, I know you had done DFI videos before then, but I think that was the one. Maybe that was kind of the first big one that you did. So why don't you tell us that story about how that came about and then what happened with it?
00:03:45.270 - 00:04:33.026, Speaker A: Totally. So basically what happened was starting from last summer, I was just collaborating with different DeFi protocols, same thing. I would just make animated short form videos or Hype videos. That just sort of is my visual representation of what I think the DeFi protocol represents and everything. And then in January, Uniswap had reached out to me asking actually they reached out to Tarun Chitra who asked if he knew me and he could put them in contact with me because they wanted to talk about something. And so when they did, they asked if I would be interested in making an animation for them for the V Three launch. Which obviously anybody who was in DFI at the time would have been like, this is the biggest announcement of the year, basically.
00:04:33.026 - 00:05:26.120, Speaker A: So I was like, of course, I can't believe you guys would put so much trust in me to basically help set off such a big announcement. And so conversations started kicking off like around end of January and then I really started production on it probably sometime in February. And my process usually, especially with bigger projects like this because they did give me a little bit more time, so I wanted to be a little bit more ambitious with it. I make a storyboard and then we go over the idea. I sketch it out. You can see this in my sort of behind the scenes video that you can find on Twitter. And then we move on from the storyboard to making what we call an animatic, which is just a very rough animated representation of what the animation might look like.
00:05:26.120 - 00:05:52.858, Speaker A: That was also when we kicked off scoring the video as well. So I originally put in a piece of music from this underground musician that I really like as sort of like a reference. And then we found an actual composer. His name is Isaac Kors on Instagram. But he's so Isaac's leader. But it's Isaac Kors on Instagram. He's so talented anyway.
00:05:52.858 - 00:06:45.966, Speaker A: And then know, he basically drew the one that I put in as a reference and then it was inspired by that. But I was doing the animation with the help of two of my friends because it was a lot of work. It was a 45 2nd long animation that overall, basically from start to finish took about at least a month and a half to finish. And so yeah, I mean, that was a whole process. I was also obviously directing it, like giving notes on everything, let's say, from the music to just creating the whole vision, really. And then when it came out in End of March, which is when they announced V Three, when they first tweeted out the video, it got more than half a million views within 24 hours. I think everybody on crypto, Twitter had probably seen that video at that point and it was a really special moment.
00:06:45.966 - 00:07:33.566, Speaker A: I think this is sort of like my magnum opus, I guess, and everybody it kind of following that. Obviously we sold it, or I sold it as an NFT, which all went to charity, but then that's sort of what put me on the map, like the NFT community. But a lot of people think that, oh, that was the headline of it saying, oh, people pleaser raised this much money after selling an NFT, because NFTs were all the talk at the time. Right. But to me, at least the most special part was just when Unisoft tweeted out the video before it was even an NFT. And just to see everybody sort of react to that and just that my animation has an impact on people was so cool and so, yeah, that was obviously like a project that has a very special place in my heart.
00:07:33.748 - 00:07:41.198, Speaker B: Yeah, and that NFT, if I recall, it went for like 300 and something. E?
00:07:41.364 - 00:07:43.102, Speaker A: Yeah. 310 Ethereum.
00:07:43.166 - 00:07:47.410, Speaker B: Yeah. So were you expecting that or was that a surprise?
00:07:47.750 - 00:08:41.966, Speaker A: That was definitely a surprise. I was speaking with a dear friend at the time about what we think what the piece would go for, and I set like a range. I said, okay, I think maybe on the low end of expectations, maybe we go for single digit ETH and then high end of expectations would be probably 100K in US dollar. Which at the time, because specifically when I sold the piece, the dollar value of ethereum was kind of low. It was like I actually almost didn't drop it that week because I was just like, the prices are so bad right now. I'm not sure if this is a good time in the market to drop an NFT, but at the end I was just like, you know what, I'm just going to go with whatever I originally planned, so let's just do it anyway. So yeah, that was the expectation, but obviously it ended up way exceeding my expectations.
00:08:41.966 - 00:08:46.386, Speaker A: So that was yeah, yeah, I think.
00:08:46.408 - 00:09:19.470, Speaker B: It'S an amazing story and I just love again, like, you know, a year ago you thought you were going to be working at Apple and said that you're your own brand and you're connecting directly to your fans. So I think it is a really good example of how NFTs are changing things for creators. Before we get into a broader NFT discussion, would you like to tell us about one specific project that you're especially proud of. You have a few to choose from, either your old DeFi videos or your Fortune cover. You can pick whatever you mean.
00:09:19.540 - 00:09:41.898, Speaker A: I think I can probably talk about the Fortune one because it's just like more recent and fresher in people's minds. Basically I think like a few months back, Alex, I'm going to butcher his last name. It's like mezmaj. He's like the founder of Showtime mezmaj.
00:09:41.934 - 00:09:44.934, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't know how to pronounce it, but that's what it looks like.
00:09:45.052 - 00:10:08.206, Speaker A: Sorry if I butchered. Yeah, so he originally made the connection. Basically he reached out and said that somebody from Fortune want to talk to me if I'd be interested. And then I said, yeah, sure. And then, so I think know that was a few months ago. I just thought that maybe they were just trying to do another NFT collaboration or something. I wasn't really know.
00:10:08.206 - 00:11:24.774, Speaker A: And then nothing happened until a few months later when their creative director Peter Herbert just cold emailed me and said, hey, do you want to do the COVID for Fortune magazine? The next issue that we have coming out is a special one that's covering cryptocurrency and DeFi. Yeah, they were just like and we watched your uniswap behind the scenes video and we thought that you would be really perfect for this. And then for me, I think right now, hopefully I'm trying to make all of my collaborations or NFT projects something meaningful or something that elevates the crypto community. And so this seemed like a perfect platform for it. I was obviously down, but it was a blank slate in the beginning. I didn't have actually any ideas for what I would actually do for the COVID And it's one of those things kind of similar to the unisoft V Three thing where I'm just like, I think this is going to have a lot of eyes on it so I better take it seriously or I need know really make the most of it. And then I was chatting with Layton Cusack, founder of Pool together a little bit later and then I was just sort of lamenting my woes about, oh, I don't have any ideas for the COVID and it's a lot of pressure, I don't know what to do.
00:11:24.774 - 00:12:47.902, Speaker A: And then he being a genius, obviously went home that night and then texted me the next day. He goes, oh, I was thinking about your Fortune cover and I thought it'd be kind of cool if you did something like a portal or something that represents going down the rabbit hole of crypto and then inside there's all these crypto anonymous Twitter avatars or something. Because we had previously floated around some ideas because around the time there were some NFT projects that were either including famous VCs or famous influencers crypto punks or something to sort of gouge so but know fortune were like oh, we had Elon Musk on one of our previous covers, and I think there were some legal issues with including actually famous real people or something. And so Layton was like, look, if you did it with anonymous Twitter people, you wouldn't have that problem. And then I was like, this is so, you know, I am full credit to him for the, you know, I still had to obviously think about how I was actually going to visually present this and put it together. And so that's pretty much what I spent all my time doing. And I made a tweet that was sort of, I guess you could say, crowdsourced, where I was just like, without any context, who are the most famous crypto, Twitter, anonymous profiles? And then obviously a lot of people commented and contributed.
00:12:47.902 - 00:13:36.414, Speaker A: So in the future, if people want to know about things like this, they should look out in my tweets. Sometimes there's alpha leak and then so yeah, I kind of sourced that together and put it together and then I obviously spent the rest of the time making sure that the artwork looks polished and professional and presented in a visually pleasing way because that is my job after all. And then I think, yeah, Fortune have been a really good sort of collaborative partner on it. They were so willing and open minded to learn anything more about crypto. And like I was saying, oh, I'll probably name these pieces, like something to do with a chad. And they're like, what does chad mean? And then they started using the term now themselves. It's great.
00:13:36.414 - 00:14:22.506, Speaker A: And then, so, yeah, when I posted on Twitter initially for the first time, I think it shocked a lot of people thought it was a joke at first. They were like, there's no way this is mean. I also feel like I can't believe they let me do this. I feel like I got away with murder or something. I was just like, this is not allowed. And it was a pretty provocative title as well, or tagline that they had on the COVID like Crypto versus Wall Street because I'm being Fortune and the Fortune 500 companies mostly are sort of not that. And so the whole issue, but I think meant a lot to me myself because obviously crypto awareness is something that I care about and I think the community as well.
00:14:22.506 - 00:14:51.180, Speaker A: And so that's kind of why this cover is currently still sold out at all new stands, because everybody just felt very represented by this issue and even just the articles inside, or sort of educating people about DeFi. The COVID art is merely just an initial means of attraction, but the whole entire issue itself is, I think, a meaningful one. So, yeah, I'm just glad that it turned out really cool.
00:14:52.110 - 00:15:05.760, Speaker B: Based on your experience, how would you say the way artists make or creators make or can make money with NFT differs from how they made money previously? And how has that affected your life?
00:15:06.210 - 00:16:00.350, Speaker A: Previously. Being a digital artist, I feel like sort of the direct path of monetizing your work is literally just posting. If you're doing your work for yourself, then you post art on Instagram, hopefully get engagement and likes, and then through traction, attract clients who then you do work for, if that makes sense. And otherwise, if you were sort of like, going my route, which was I was just trading my skill set to create other people's visions. So working on movies, TV shows, commercials, that kind of stuff. And so NFTs obviously really changed the game for a lot of digital creators because other than maybe physically selling prints of your work, that was kind of like the only direct way to monetize your digital work. And so that's where NFT came in previously.
00:16:00.350 - 00:16:43.520, Speaker A: I think I tweeted this once. In the old world, I guess digital artists were helping Instagram make money while they were paying us in likes. But now with sort of NFTs, you can actually have utility and value to the work that you're creating. Not to mention that royalties are a thing now with blockchain and everything. It's been wildly different for me, especially. Like we said, I would just be still rendering iPhones, like 3D iPhones right now if I didn't get into NFTs or I didn't stumble into crypto. So, yeah, that's my take on it.
00:16:43.520 - 00:16:44.622, Speaker A: Great.
00:16:44.676 - 00:17:05.682, Speaker B: Yeah. It's just been so fun researching this episode. All right, so in a moment, we're going to talk a lot more about kind of the financial aspects of NFTs.

00:18:39.842 - 00:19:05.338, Speaker B: Polymarket co unchained. Back to my conversation with people, pleaser. So I'm just so curious to hear how you feel the art world for NFTs is different than the art world for traditional artists. And by that it can be anything from, for instance, who the collectors are or how the artwork itself is different. Or you could tell me a little bit about what you think the technology is doing to your field so far.
00:19:05.504 - 00:20:09.678, Speaker A: It seems a lot of NFTs still very much rely on visual imagery to sell the work. And I think that the general public, when they think about NFTs, it's almost synonymous to them to NFT art or visual art. And it's gone to a point where even, like musicians or people who have previously been making creations or art and other mediums that are not visual are having to sort of reach out to visual artists. And it's almost like having a visual representation is a vital part to anything being an NFT. And I hope that that changes in the future just because NFT is just the technology itself, right? Like, if you're trying to NFT a book, it shouldn't have to also have a visual counterpart or something. The content is the content. But that being said, I think obviously, especially with smart contracts, I think it's created or opened so many doors as to what's possible.
00:20:09.678 - 00:20:52.480, Speaker A: And we are currently in the process of discovering that everybody together, I think. So just like an example of something cool that I experimented know, especially with the recent Fortune cover NFT drop that I did was I want if I'm going to do an drop, like, I don't want it to just be a drop of the COVID I think we have an opportunity to do something a little bit cooler here. And so one of the people or the guys that are best at doing the smart contracts for a lot of this stuff right now are manifold, which are they're like a smart contract, like NFT minting company.
00:20:52.850 - 00:20:55.120, Speaker B: I'm sorry, what name did you just.
00:20:59.090 - 00:22:14.486, Speaker A: Collaborate? I mean, they've collaborated previously with all the biggest artists like Pac and Fuckrender and Slime Sunday. And So what we did with them was that because The COVID Fortune Magazine that I did features So many different Crypto influencers as Avatars and A Lot Of Them with Their Wallet Addresses being public, we Fed Into the smart contract to target their wallet addresses so that the artwork will actually I made special versions that basically feature them, let's say really largely on the so, you know, for example, let's say if Laura Shin placed a bid, then it would just be Laura's face, like, plastered all over the COVID or something. And it was just meant to be a fun interactive experiment, especially just trying to do something a little bit new with NFTs. And even now, I think the APIs for a lot of the platforms are still a little bit limiting. For example, OpenSea was a little bit slow to update their metadata. So in an ideal world, when somebody places a bid, it would immediately update. But in this case, just because that was just not ready on Opensea's end.
00:22:14.486 - 00:23:09.062, Speaker A: So it was taking a few minutes to update. So in a really intense auction, actually, that wouldn't have really flown by well, because then be like, Laura would place an auction and I'll place one right after. It doesn't even have time to update to the Laura version. So that's how we know we're still early, I think, is just because so many of these things are so lacking when we have the ideas and we can taste the possibility of it happening. But a lot of the platforms and everything are just slow to catch up. I mean, OpenSea actually ended up having a lot of issues on their end, even just supporting the auction itself because there was too much traffic and then it got Dos attacked and so two of the pieces closed prematurely. There were all these issues with the auction itself, which is unfortunate, but yeah, like I said, it's just an indicator of how early we are.
00:23:09.062 - 00:23:53.590, Speaker A: And so hopefully in the future when all of this kind of like but these are things that affect it financially, right? Because of these two auctions being closed prematurely due to the platform, one of them sold for, I think, less than half of the value that it was supposed to sell for. This is a real financial impact. And so just talking about finance and NFTs, obviously it's great that there's this new way for us to monetize our work, but there is sort of a lot of other dependencies that factor into the finance of things with NFTs, for sure. So hopefully we're working towards a future where a lot of these things go a lot more smoothly.
00:23:54.730 - 00:24:23.706, Speaker B: One quick question before we move on. I really want to discuss Dows soon. However, during the week this episode was recorded, we saw two institutions buy NFTs. Visa bought a CryptoPunk and Budweiser bought Beer ETH, which is a domain name, NFT. Obviously, you have now worked with an institution, Fortune Magazine. And I was curious to know where you thought this institutional interest in NFTs would go. I feel like there's almost like two tracks of this interest in NFTs.
00:24:23.706 - 00:24:36.558, Speaker B: There's kind of the discord chat rooms where people are waiting for the NFT drops, but then you've got this other end. So I was curious to hear how you're perceiving these two constituencies that are interested in NFTs.
00:24:36.734 - 00:25:44.390, Speaker A: Well, I mean, I think clearly, I'm sure without a doubt, a lot of it is financially motivated. Let's be real us being in crypto, we find the technology really cool and everything in it for the tech. But what generates headlines is at the end of the day, all the headlines that you ever see are just this NFT sold for this much money or this company made this much money selling NFTs, NFTs money number. And so I feel like maybe that's what initially attracts a lot of these major corporations to sort of like dabble. But I do think that there is a difference between the ones that actually are open minded and willing to learn about what the space is really about. And honestly, I really felt that with fortune is just after this whole experience, they were like, we're going to open like a fortune vault and start just like holding NFTs now. So I thought that was really cool, right? We helped them set up their first on chain identity.
00:25:44.390 - 00:26:51.440, Speaker A: They bought fortunedia or fortune magazine e. They have a hardware wallet now and then I didn't even think that they would want to start collecting NFTs, but they do and they're holding their crypto. So this is just an example, right? I'm just using this because I directly work with them so I can actually say this or at least I know my information is accurate. And I'm sure there's other corporations who obviously, after having these experiences, also sort of like, opened up their eyes to what is possible within the space. And it's not just a come and do NFTs cash out and go back to their old corporate lives kind of situation, which I hope happens more and more because I think there's so much at this point, I feel like it's almost hopefully undeniable that this is just a technology that will be so existing in our lives constantly in the near future. And so the earlier a company can be onboarded, probably the better for them.
00:26:51.810 - 00:27:06.522, Speaker B: So a new trend in crypto is this trend of dows and NFTs specifically curation dows, though I don't know all the different terminology for these different types of DAOs. How do you see DAOs changing NFTs art, curation collecting, et cetera.
00:27:06.686 - 00:28:36.142, Speaker A: I guess the sort of elephant in the room that I should bring up at this point in the episode is that when I sold my uniswap NFT in march, it incepted the creation of pleaserdao, which are now sort of like one of the big players in sort of like collector DAOs. And honestly, I think that at the time it blew people's minds because around that time, even though NFTs were such a big thing and then everybody was buying and selling NFTs, but it was very much a collector's dominant, like whale collectors dominant game, right, as individual whale collectors. And sort of like at least anybody who's dabbled in the NFT space knew that there were a few notable collectors who are famous within the space. And then so when pleaserdao was formed, not just with my piece. But immediately after, when they bought the Edward Snowden NFT, it kind of woke people up to being like, okay, there's a new sort of player in the game now, which is a Dao, which at the time, even with my auction. It's like, how do you beat a Dow when a bunch of people have sort of like a collected common goal and then they're just like, we're going to stop at nothing to get this piece. It's a very similar kind of movement that you're seeing with the whole Wall Street Bets Subreddit thing that happened.
00:28:36.142 - 00:29:31.780, Speaker A: It's just collective coordination and the power of that, right? And when I was selling my piece, honestly, for me personally, I envisioned hopefully some whale collector was going to bid on it and win the piece. So when people were telling me, oh, there's this dow that's being created right now where people are pulling funds together to win the auction, it blew my mind in the sense that people were down to collectively own something. And I think that's what makes Dao so powerful and sort of like I didn't catch on to this until way later, but basically somebody explained it really well in pleaserdo. They were like, look, just imagine there's like a future Internet MoMA or something. But when you're going to all the people who visit the museum, they also own a bit of every piece of art that's in that museum. And I just think that's so special and cool at the same time. And so that's kind of like what they're doing right now.
00:29:31.780 - 00:30:10.074, Speaker A: Obviously, compared to old traditional corporations, dows are so scary because you can do everything over the Internet. You're pulling funds on the blockchain. Like with the Edward Zona piece, they got together that 5.5 million within 12 hours, which is insane and just doesn't happen in a regular company and you're recruiting members. It's like a monster or like a machine of a startup that just expands and recruits extremely fast and no one can stop. There's literally an unstoppable force. So I think that obviously we've already seen this happen with even Subreddits.
00:30:10.074 - 00:30:29.320, Speaker A: Subreddits honestly, are kind of a Dow. They're just not monetized or they don't have tokens or governance, but it's the same concept, right? And it's like you can't stop the army of the many is how they put it. And so, yeah, dows are a huge game changer. It's exciting to see where this is going to go.
00:30:30.090 - 00:30:55.600, Speaker B: So I'm so curious. Based on this discussion, I did see someone tweet something earlier today. And I don't have the exact tweet, but it was something like you could own one of a limited edition run of 500 of the same NFT, or you could own one 500th of a single unique NFT and kind of posing the question, like, which do you think is more valuable? And I was curious to hear your answers to this question.
00:30:56.290 - 00:31:28.838, Speaker A: I think that depends on. The project itself. Right. I feel like that's just such an obvious answer. But I can own one crypto punk. There's 10,000 of them. But owning that is going to be at least monetarily more valuable than owning a one of one of an art piece that maybe doesn't have that kind of value discovered or determined yet and is selling for one ethereum, for example.
00:31:28.838 - 00:32:18.280, Speaker A: And so there's no right or wrong answer to this question. I think it just depends on the piece itself. At the end of the day, value is speculative or subjective and it changes all the time. And to own, obviously, for example, the pieces that pleaserdal go after they hope are going to be pieces that everybody wants to own, like 1000 of or something, for example, like the doge NFT or any piece that they acquire is hopefully a very unique and significant one of one that is going to uphold its value down the line and that everybody wants to own part of. But at the same time, you can own a board ape, which is I think it's 10,000. Right, but that in itself has like a different set of values than owning a portion of something.
00:32:19.130 - 00:32:49.730, Speaker B: And out of curiosity, for Damien Hirst's latest project, the currency in which he sold 10,000 NFTs of hand painted dot covered works on paper, and then each buyer can decide if they want to redeem the NFT for the corresponding physical artwork. But they only have one year to do that, and if they don't request the physical artwork, then it'll be destroyed. I was curious what percentage of people you thought would choose to redeem the NFT for physical artwork.
00:32:50.470 - 00:33:24.126, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, being a digital native myself, obviously I'm biased towards anything digital. I also just don't like a lot of stuff. Right. So it's like, to me it's perfect that I can move artwork without any effort on the blockchain, as opposed to having to carry something physically, it's me more expensive probably to do that. And so just from a practical standpoint, but at the same time, I don't know, there's still a lot of real people out there who aren't like nerds, who live in a cave like me. All right.
00:33:24.148 - 00:33:33.200, Speaker B: Yeah. We'll have to see what happens then. Okay, so last question. Where do you think the NFT space will go in the next year or.
00:33:33.910 - 00:34:17.150, Speaker A: I have been saying this so many times that I am looking forward for it to be way bigger in the gaming space. I don't know why it isn't already. I think that it has something to do with the fact that our hardware technology has not caught up with what we imagine to be possible with metaverses and immersive. Yeah. You know, at least for me, like I said previously as well, with NFT being just like the technology. And it's not just art, right? Like NFT is know, art is one subset of what an NFT is possible for. I mean, we've seen some sort of real world implementations of NFTs already that are beyond just art.
00:34:17.150 - 00:35:11.950, Speaker A: But I hope to see way more of this trading of assets in game economies which already happens and is a huge thing. For example, I don't know, I think obviously Blizzard, they have their own ecosystem warcraft with even individual games that they have. It's just like there's a crazy economy that already exists for that. And hopefully in the future with the metaverse, it's like not only cross game but cross platform. It doesn't have to be like blizzard currency is only used in Blizzard games or like Riot maybe in the metaverse it's like all of those assets are transferable because, for example, 3D assets are at the end of the day, kind of all made the same way, more or less. And so there's no reason why, yeah, it can be cross transferable like in platforms and games. And I hope to see way more of that in NFTs.
00:35:13.910 - 00:35:16.370, Speaker B: Where can people learn more about you and your work?
00:35:16.520 - 00:35:36.310, Speaker A: I'm mostly spending my time on twitter. I'm people pleaser one on Twitter because when I created my account there was already people pleaser. But I'm just people, pleaser. On Instagram. That's where I post more of my sort of personal artwork and yeehaw.
00:35:36.810 - 00:35:50.620, Speaker B: To learn more about people pleaser check out the show notes for this episode. Unchained is produced by me, Laura Shin with help from Anthony Yoon, Daniel Nuts and Mark Murdoch. Thanks for listening. It.
