00:02:30.934 - 00:02:33.360, Speaker C: Hey, Laura. Thank you so much for having me.
00:02:34.130 - 00:02:39.600, Speaker A: You're at crypto Bahamas this week. What has the vibe been like and what are people talking about?
00:02:40.290 - 00:03:12.070, Speaker C: It's a great vibe here. There's so much energy. I feel like there's a couple of really big trends that are facing industry right now, and those are positive trends. One is that we're starting to see governments, policymakers, regulators starting to see that they're starting to support this and go on the offense. It really started with the biden executive order. So that thread of just governments trying to see this as an opportunity, not a threat, is big. And then institutional adoption.
00:03:12.070 - 00:03:24.480, Speaker C: There are a ton of institutions here trying to learn, get educated, and really embrace what we're seeing in crypto. So super exciting vibe here. Some amazing speakers as well, and it's just great.
00:03:26.130 - 00:03:47.490, Speaker A: So FTX is one of the organizers of the conference and that's led by Sam Ping vinfried and its US arm, recently ratled some financial industry big wigs. You know a little or really a lot about that world. Why don't you give us a little bit on your background and then tell us what it is that Sam and FTX US proposed.
00:03:48.310 - 00:04:05.142, Speaker C: Yep. Thanks Laura. So I started my career as A-U-S. Marine and I served in Battle of Ramadi. And then I transitioned into a company called Lehman Brothers, which many people have heard about. And I got myself into the derivatives industry. And by the time we went bankrupt, I was running our derivatives prime brokerage.
00:04:05.142 - 00:04:30.434, Speaker C: And I saw what happens when crisis hits derivatives. I was at the epicenter of the global financial crisis. I moved across to Citi the following day. They asked me if I wanted a job. I asked them what kind of package they had and they said it was a really great package, it's called a job. And so I started the next day and the first thing that I had to do is clean up my own mess at Lehman because all of my trades were defaulted. And then something happened.
00:04:30.434 - 00:05:14.026, Speaker C: It was called Dodd Frank. And governments around the world decided that they really wanted to regulate the derivatives industry. And so I was put in charge of that business where we had to take the 700 trillion dollar derivatives industry from unregulated to regulated. And a guy named Gary Gensler was my head regulator at the time. And by the time I left, I was running our futures business, our foreign exchange prime brokerage business, and then this clear derivatives business. So I was at the heart of that. Now when you step back and you look at how regulators and policymakers approached this financial crisis, it was caused by centralization and the regulatory response was even more centralization and concentration.
00:05:14.026 - 00:06:13.234, Speaker C: And I don't blame them because there were no technology alternatives at the time. And if you look back over the last 100 years, regulators really needed central nodes that they could monitor and collateralize and regulate because the idea of decentralizing derivatives just wasn't, there were no capabilities around that. And so we ended up in a world where today in the United States, you're seeing incredible innovation overseas. 90% of crypto derivatives are being transacted and overseas and it's incredibly difficult for our innovators to adapt this centralized policy to offer crypto derivatives. And so if you step back even further, what is this futures market? It can be very confusing to folks, but really what it does is it requires central clearing. So all derivatives have to face one central counterparty. You've probably heard of it before.
00:06:13.234 - 00:06:54.750, Speaker C: The CME is an example where they're the buyer to the seller and the seller to the buyer. So you create this big central counterparty and then members form around that central counterparty. And really what those are, are the banks. And what the banks have to do is guarantee the performance of that ecosystem. And so what it results in is a big centralization and socialization of risk. Because if one of those members goes bankrupt and there's not enough money in the system, then all those other members have to pay for it. And so the system that we have today is very centralized.
00:06:54.750 - 00:07:47.810, Speaker C: The intermediaries, to get into the system, you have to go through a member, and that member guarantees the risk of the whole system. And so it's a very socialized approach. What the FTX folks have proposed is something that's going to change this, turn it on its entire head. And they're saying, look, we don't need to have intermediaries anymore because we have the technology where we can open up access across markets and we can allow individuals to face the clearinghouse directly. This is a major, major change because it departs from that socialization ecosystem and it is causing a humongous stir amongst the banks, amongst the clearinghouses. And I'm happy to unpack it further.
00:07:48.710 - 00:07:57.990, Speaker A: Yeah, well, so talk a little bit more about who would be affected and kind of how they're reacting to this proposal.
00:07:58.810 - 00:08:46.630, Speaker C: So it's been really interesting because I said earlier, the law required this intermediation. And what we call those intermediaries, we call them Futures Commission merchants, those are the banks, right? And you would think that if your business is the law, that business would be great, but actually it's not. If you look back from 2004, there were 188 intermediaries, or FCMs. Today they're only 61. And at the same time, what happened was the amount of collateral that they've had to hold has gone through the roof. It's gone from like 60 billion in 2002 to 470,000,000,000 today. So what you're seeing is you're seeing the number of intermediaries come down, the amount of risk going up.
00:08:46.630 - 00:09:28.754, Speaker C: And so we're left with a very concentrated system. Now, the other problem that we've been watching is that the central counterparties themselves, they control all the collateral in the system and they calibrate it. And they're supposed to calibrate it such that if somebody goes into default, then their own assets stand behind their default. That's called default or pays. Even though it's a big socialization of risk, you really need to have this concept of default or pays. But what we've seen is we've seen a lot of under collateralization. We see that in margin breaches, which means that the movement in the markets isn't enough exceeds the collateral that's been set.
00:09:28.754 - 00:10:12.766, Speaker C: So we're seeing that as a trend. And we also saw with like Nasdaq OMX, that there have been instances as recently as 2018 where the other members have had to pay. So there's some issues in the system. And one thing that's really plaguing these intermediaries is their legacy technology, where it's very batch driven today. The problem here is that they really can't keep up with the crypto markets. And this is what's happening when people trade, the risk immediately hits the system. But collateral isn't called by the clearinghouse, it could be called from the intermediary right away, but then the bank has to wait until the end of the next day to collect the collateral back.
00:10:12.766 - 00:11:16.082, Speaker C: And so for crypto markets, right, these markets trade 24/7. They can be volatile, we know that and we like it. And it's a new asset class being born. But it's very hard to reconcile the dynamic risk management of crypto markets with these very slow, arduous, batch driven processes. And so frankly, the banks are really struggling to keep up with crypto derivatives. And so who stands to win here and who stands to lose? I think the people that stand to win are the US people, the US market participants themselves, right? Because what are derivatives? Derivatives have been around for centuries. They originally started by helping farmers hedge their risk for their crops, right? And so we're left in a situation in America where market participants are transacting in cryptocurrencies, but they don't have a viable dynamic derivatives market that allows them to hedge their risk.
00:11:16.082 - 00:11:56.558, Speaker C: And so to the extent that FTX can come in address those operational shortfalls, they can potentially offer the US persons the ability to better hedge their risk. Which is awesome for crypto markets. So for that reason, I think it's such a no brainer to really think through. Now the regulators are concerned about a couple of things. This model is different in that we do have this concept of auto liquidation in futures markets. But frankly, you have the same concept in traditional markets because if you miss a margin call, you can get liquidated. But here it's more automated.
00:11:56.558 - 00:12:46.530, Speaker C: And so what I think regulators are going to look at is a couple of things. Number one, are there appropriate disclaimers? Do people know what they're doing? I think that's very easy to solve for. And the second thing is, remember, you're departing from this old system where the banks are guaranteeing the performance of the system, and in this case FTX is know we don't need those guarantees because we're going to manage risk and collateralize risk in real time. And to the extent there is a shortfall, we're going to meet that shortfall through our own obligations, which is something that kind of aligns interest, if you ask me. So it's a big departure. It's something that I think if we're able to move forward with, it'll be very good for markets, it'll be good for US. Persons.
00:12:46.530 - 00:13:51.030, Speaker C: The other thing that I love about it is it introduces competition, right? When you have a new model that may be more inclusive. When I was running our futures business, there's times when you couldn't extend your services to hedgers that only traded a few times a year to hedge the risk, where you'd have to say, listen, I have to give you a big minimum because my costs are so high. So I think it'll lead to a more inclusive marketplace? I think it'll lead to a marketplace that's probably more cost effective because there are fewer toll takers around. Finally, I think the banks are having debates amongst themselves on the future. I think at the end of the day, it's my guess that the banks will actually support this model because it will give them the opportunity to get involved maybe in new and exciting ways. And I think it will also incentivize the legacy providers, maybe to kick their technology up a gear. And again, I think this type of competition and a move toward real time risk management is going to be really good for markets.
00:13:52.490 - 00:14:01.580, Speaker A: Yeah, it's incredibly fascinating. So in a moment, we're going to talk a little bit more about next steps. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible.

So one thing I just wanted to point out for listeners is that FTX recently made an acquisition, or I should say FTX US made an acquisition of Ledger X, which is kind of what enabled them to make this proposal. So can you talk a little bit about that maneuver and then just generally what this could mean for FTX US?
00:16:29.150 - 00:17:07.938, Speaker C: Yeah, we talk about it amongst a number of market participants to operate in the United States, you need certain licenses and spot markets in crypto. Some of the regulation I would say, is a bit gray at best. We're trying to figure out the right principles based regulatory framework. But the thing about derivatives is that they're fully regulated. And the law that was passed with Dodd Frank articulated exactly how the law works. So there's no ambiguity around the regulation of derivatives themselves. And when you unpack the law and regulations around derivatives, to operate, you need certain licenses.
00:17:07.938 - 00:18:02.962, Speaker C: And the license that LedgerX had was something called the DCO Derivatives Clearing Organization, which is a license that allows you to be the buyer to the seller, and the seller to the buyer, effectively the entity that controls the entire ecosystem and calibrates risk management. And so to operate, you need to have that DCO. You've seen that other folks like coinbase Purchase Ferex, which is a DCM. A DCM is a designated contract market. It's an exchange essentially for futures. And so in order to operate in the US derivatives market, you need to put together, I call them like these regulatory Legos, these licenses, in order to function from front to back. The last license that you need to operate in today's derivatives market is something called the FCM, the Futures Commission merchant that's the Intermediary and So Exchange need a license.
00:18:02.962 - 00:18:36.610, Speaker C: Intermediary, you need a license. Clearinghouse, you need a license. And what the LedgerX acquisition did, it gave FTX the license to operate as a clearinghouse in the United States. So it's a necessary ingredient. And now they're saying, OK, I've got the DCO, I don't need the FCM because I can risk manage the system without it. And again, I think it's very exciting and I think it's an innovation that could revitalize derivatives markets which have largely migrated overseas.
00:18:37.830 - 00:18:57.400, Speaker A: Yeah. And I do know. So the Bloomberg article that broke this news said the industry seemed concerned that the proposal could give FTX a toehole to expand into markets for everything from oil to gold to currencies. So what do you think of that concern? And why don't we actually just tie it in with the fact that already CME has come out against this?
00:18:58.830 - 00:19:48.280, Speaker C: So my thesis is that these markets are coming together. What's a better marketplace? One that settles on an arduous twelve hour batch cycle or one that leverages tokens to settle in real time? Right. And so I believe that traditional finance and crypto, at the end of the day they're going to come together. And I think in many cases crypto technology is going to eat the legacy technology, but why wouldn't we want to ultimately extend it to other asset classes? Now you can't just race into it. And I think there needs to be a lot of thought that goes into it. At the end of the day, derivatives are incredibly important from a risk management perspective. And so when you move to 24 hours markets seven days a week, which is happening and has happened.
00:19:48.280 - 00:20:24.530, Speaker C: I think unique risks could emerge, like what happens if a commodities contract with a low liquidity at two in the morning, a trade gets done and it triggers an off market valuation that leads to liquidations. These are the types of things that need to be thought through. But I think it's inevitable that the entire world is going to move to 24 hours, seven day a week markets. And I think the US derivatives market is going to be part of that. I mean, it just doesn't make sense otherwise. Derivatives help you risk manage dynamic risk management is what we owe to US. Persons.
00:20:25.510 - 00:20:45.340, Speaker A: So there's going to be a comment, or there is a comment period that will end on May 11. And this Wednesday, the CFTC announced that there would be a public discussion on this proposal on May 25. So what do you think this signals? Is this kind of standard operating procedure or does it give some indication of how likely the proposal is to pass?
00:20:45.710 - 00:21:52.190, Speaker C: So, in my discussions with the CFTC, they're a very thoughtful regulator and they're asking all the right questions and they're trying to get educated to reach the right principles based conclusion. I think when you look at that in the context of President Biden's executive order and Secretary Yellen's discussion around, hey, let's go from the defense to the offense and let's focus on responsible innovation, this fits right in the wheelhouse. And derivatives are a cornerstone of the US economy, frankly the cornerstone of our national security. And so I'm very excited about these public hearings, about the desire to be educated, to understand the opportunity and the risk. My personal belief is that I'm very hopeful and encouraged that we are able to move forward, perhaps starting with crypto derivatives, because right now the ability in the United States is very limited to a couple of cash settled products. But I would love to come away from these hearings with an opportunity for US persons to hedge the risk.
00:21:52.630 - 00:21:58.260, Speaker A: And at the time of this public discussion, what will you be watching for in terms of Tea leave?
00:22:00.390 - 00:22:49.950, Speaker C: I'm really interested to hear reasons why we shouldn't move forward. In my mind, I saw a comment today by one of the CEOs saying principles based innovation, right? And as I look at that, the principles that we're able to deliver through the FTX proposal would be perhaps more inclusivity. It would be better risk management. And so I would love to hear the arguments around why we shouldn't revitalize our futures markets because I need to understand them better. To me, it's kind of a no brainer that we should embrace technology and unlock its promise while understanding the risk and come up with regulatory guardrails to make sure that those risks are mitigated. So that's really what I want to see. And then, of course, interested to see how the commissioners react.
00:22:49.950 - 00:23:37.250, Speaker C: The other thing to watch, right, is the partisan nature of the dialogue. And in my experience in talking to regulators and policymakers, I actually don't see too much of it, right? And if you look at historical decisions made by the CFTC, they're typically along party lines. Not always, but a lot of times I'm guessing that in this case, that may not be the case. And so if there's any partisanism that's introduced, that would be very curious to me because from my experience, even if you look at recent congressional races, it's very much a bipartisan phenomena where Eric Adams and Ted Cruz are agreeing that we need to embrace this technology. So that would be something that I would watch, but I don't expect it to be partisan.
00:23:37.990 - 00:23:46.114, Speaker A: All right, well, we will have to see what happens at that time. This has been an incredibly fascinating discussion. Thanks so much for coming on unchained.

00:25:04.270 - 00:25:49.770, Speaker A: The central African republic car, a country home to 4.9 million people, has adopted bitcoin as legal tender within its borders. According to the AFP news agency, car president Faustin arkansh tuadera signed a law legalizing all cryptocurrencies and recognizing bitcoin as legal tender. This week, finance minister erve nboda was proud of the country's move. He explained to Bloomberg there's a common narrative that sub saharan African countries are often one step behind when it comes to adopting new technology. This time, we can actually say that our country is one step ahead. Car is the first country to legalize bitcoin as legal tender in Africa and the second in the world, joining El Salvador.
00:25:49.770 - 00:26:53.658, Speaker A: Notably, the car news came during the same week that former BitMEX CEO and noted analyst Arthur Hayes made the case for the doom loop. In his most recent article arguing that bitcoin adoption at the country level would lead to a $1 million price per coin, he wrote flags meaning nations will pursue a savings policy mix that includes storing commodities and purchasing gold. Bitcoin the fact that USD and EUR assets are not part of this mix, combined with entrenched real goods and energy inflation, puts the Doom Loop into motion. The Doom Loop will usher in $1 million bitcoin and $10,000 to $20,000 goals by the end of the decade. Elon Musk is buying Twitter. Here's why that's important for crypto Twitter is set to go private after formally accepting a $44 billion bid from Tesla CEO Elon Musk. The news was announced in a press release Tuesday with the Twitter board unanimously approving the deal that will see every shareholder receive a payout of $54.20
00:26:53.658 - 00:27:47.342, Speaker A: per share. While there are still some details to be worked out before the Elon deal officially goes through, the news had some instant implications for the crypto market and could have far reaching effects as well, just as I did in a bulletin newsletter this week. Let's break down three ways Musk's bid for Twitter is noteworthy for crypto. First, as usual, Musk's action pumped the price of doge, with the Monday news release, pushing the meme coin up by about 20% before coming back down rather quickly. Dogecoin fanatics are most likely excited about the news, as Musk recently showed interest in doge tipping, a Twitter native feature. Furthermore, Tesla accepts doge for certain merchandise, setting a precedent for Musk to utilize the currency at his companies. Speaking of Tesla, the electric car manufacturer in the Musk Led SpaceX holds BTC on their balance sheets.
00:27:47.342 - 00:29:00.038, Speaker A: Adding Twitter to that list does not seem crazy, especially considering the app has already integrated Lightning payments. Musk made it clear that eliminating bots will be a priority for Twitter under his leadership. This will be a major user experience upgrade for crypto twitter as impostorbot accounts frequently scam new or unlucky users via phishing links and private key ploys. On that note, I'm personally interested in how crypto tools like Zero Knowledge technology could be used to help authenticate users. Fidelity Bitcoin 401 KS are on the Way Fidelity Investments will allow clients to add bitcoin to their 401K retirement plans later this year, the firm announced on Tuesday. Employers will be able to cap bitcoin savings at 20% of an employee's account. There is growing interest from plan sponsors for vehicles that enable them to provide their employees access to digital assets in defined contribution plans and in turn from individuals with an appetite to incorporate cryptocurrencies into their long term investment strategies, said Dave Gray, head of workplace retirement offerings and platforms at Fidelity Investments, in a press release.
00:29:00.038 - 00:29:50.810, Speaker A: Crazy stat. According to CoinDesk's Research, Cerulei Associates estimates that Fidelity held around $2.4 trillion in 401K assets in 2020. That's nearly triple bitcoin's market capitalization. The Michael Saylor Led software firm MicroStrategy is at the front of the line for Fidelity's offering and announced on Tuesday that it plans to offer employees access to bitcoin via Fidelity 401 KS. MicroStrategy looks forward to working with Fidelity Digital Assets to become the first public company to offer their employees the option to invest in Bitcoin as part of our four hundred and one K program.

Vitalik seems optimistic about optimism. Optimism, the third largest ethereum layer two by total value, locked fourth if you count polygon announced plans for governance this week.

Aguitaris, a much anticipated NFT project headed by digital artist and former Major League Baseball player Micah Johnson, underwent its initial drop with a faulty smart contract, leading to $34 million worth of ether being locked away from both creators and purchasers. Two smart contract errors were found shortly after the drop started, though Aku developers denied anything was wrong. The first was rectified after a hacker froze and unfroze the refund capability of the Akutar mint. However, the second error, which miscounted the number of NFTs necessary to unlock funds, proved fatal and led to 11,539 ETH, or $34 million, being locked into a smart contract. I'm so sorry.
00:32:36.270 - 00:33:06.786, Speaker A: I'm so sorry to the Aku family. I care so deeply about the Aku family. I let you all down and I'm so sorry, wrote Johnson on Twitter. Since then, the Aku team has refunded affected users and successfully finalized an AirDrop of the NFTs. Despite the shaky drop, the 15,000 piece collection holds a floor price of 1.9 e on openc. A Tale of Two Cities new York passed a law looking to pause new nonrenewable energy based proof of work mining.
00:33:06.786 - 00:34:08.810, Speaker A: The New York State Assembly passed a law that would place a two year moratorium on the approval for new mining operations utilizing the Proof of Work consensus algorithm and powered by non renewable energy. Furthermore, the bill would prevent existing operations from renewing their permits. This could stymie new bitcoin and ethereum mining in New York if the law passes in the State Senate and if many of these miners don't use renewable energy. Of the total hash rate in the US, 19.9% is housed in New York Fort Worth, the first mining City On the opposite end of the spectrum lies Fort Worth, Texas, which is set to become the first city in the United States to start mining bitcoin in a pilot project. Through a partnership with Texas Blockchain Council, the city will be maintaining three mining rigs in a climate controlled location in City Hall. $77 million in BTC will be donated to Ukraine in Fiat Earlier this week, it was reported that Finland was considering ways to donate up to $77 million worth of seized bitcoin to Ukraine.
00:34:08.810 - 00:34:59.850, Speaker A: Notably, there was disagreement about whether the bitcoin should be sent over the bitcoin network or whether customs should cash out the bitcoin and donate the resulting fiat. On Thursday, it was confirmed that Finland would be doing the latter and will give Coinmotion and Tesseract, two crypto firms, the 1890 BTC by early summer for them to sell for euros, which will then be donated to Ukraine. Deuce Dow down 13.4 million due to a hack deuce Finance a DFI application was exploited, with the hacker getting away with $13.4 million. According to CoinDesk, the hacker utilized it with a specialized $143,000,000 flash loan attack to artificially inflate the value of assets, borrow funds and make a profit after selling. This is the second exploit in 2022 for deuce.
00:34:59.850 - 00:36:03.894, Speaker A: Time for fun bits. Whoa. Edward Snowden played a role in the birth of Zcash the founding of Zcash, a much covered story that involved six participants breaking up a private key controlling the ability to mint tokens in a plan called The Ceremony, just got a little bit crazier. The publicly known Zcash founders have so far included Zuko and Nathan Wilcox, coin Center's Peter Van Valkenberg, security engineer Derek Hinch and Bitcoin developer Peter Tod, who each went to great lengths via overseas flights, burned equipment, tinfoil and air gapped computers to make sure the ceremony was completed without a nefarious hacker gaining access to the key controlling the supply of Zcash. However, until this week, it was not known that rounding out the Group of Six was the famous whistleblower and former US defense contractor Edward Snowden. Stone's involvement in the 2016 event occurred three years after the US. Charged him with espionage and was done under the pseudonym John Darberton.
00:36:03.894 - 00:36:56.930, Speaker A: However, according to Snowden, it was not the opportunity to invest, but his interest in Zcash technology, which is privacy focused and helps users obfuscate blockchain transactions through dark pools, which led to his involvement. As long as it is clear that I was never paid and had no stake, it was just a public interest thing. I think you can tell people wrote Snowden. Thanks so much for joining us today.
