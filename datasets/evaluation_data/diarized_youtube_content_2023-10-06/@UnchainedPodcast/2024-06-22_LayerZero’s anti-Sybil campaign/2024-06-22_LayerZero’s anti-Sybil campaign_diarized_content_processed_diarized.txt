00:00:00.160 - 00:00:33.966, Speaker A: Even in the best of reports, there's still people who are submitting false positives. And then you have to kind of accept like what is the false positive rate that's acceptable? Are you going to go through and vet, you get 1.1 million people reported as Sybil and you have a bunch of individuals saying, but I swear I'm a real person and here's why. And here's all of this proof. And now you have a cluster of 1000 people and one person looks pretty different, like they might be a real person. Like, do you take them out individually? You're going to deal with millions of appeals. Do you throw out the entire cluster? That whole process, again, is just messy.
00:00:33.966 - 00:00:52.494, Speaker A: But for sure, somebody can take this entire thing, turn it into a business. And I promise you, every person running a project going forward doing any kind of distribution will immediately pay for it. If there was something that existed in the world like that, I would have paid for it in a heartbeat and would have loved to not have to actually do the work myself for sure.
