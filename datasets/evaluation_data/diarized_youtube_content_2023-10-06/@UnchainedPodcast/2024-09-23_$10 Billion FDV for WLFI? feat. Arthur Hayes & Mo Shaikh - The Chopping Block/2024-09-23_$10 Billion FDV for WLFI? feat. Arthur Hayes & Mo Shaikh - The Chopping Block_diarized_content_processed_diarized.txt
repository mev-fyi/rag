00:00:00.280 - 00:00:09.585, Speaker A: It's just not fun. I feel like if you had tasked me with creating a Trump defi protocol, we could have all sorts of fun stuff we could do, like, Trump fun. You know, we could on Trump swap.
00:00:09.625 - 00:00:10.649, Speaker B: Oh, wow, that would be great.
00:00:10.697 - 00:00:10.857, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:00:10.881 - 00:00:15.441, Speaker A: You know, it's supposed to be, like, fun and approachable, and this is like.
00:00:15.473 - 00:00:17.881, Speaker D: Whichever one of you assholes starts Trump fun.
00:00:17.913 - 00:00:20.633, Speaker A: You owe royalties, not a dividend.
00:00:20.729 - 00:00:21.921, Speaker D: It's a tale of two quant.
00:00:21.993 - 00:00:24.609, Speaker B: Now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet.
00:00:24.697 - 00:00:27.121, Speaker A: Generally speaking, airdrops are kind of pointless anyways.
00:00:27.273 - 00:00:30.017, Speaker B: I named trading firms who were very involved.
00:00:30.121 - 00:00:32.709, Speaker D: Alec eth is the ultimate defi.
00:00:32.757 - 00:00:35.305, Speaker B: Protocols are the antidote to this problem.
00:00:36.085 - 00:00:38.293, Speaker C: What the fuck's on your legs? What is that?
00:00:38.469 - 00:00:45.557, Speaker D: It's shit that gets you in trouble at the airport. That's all I got to tell you. Like, you always get Covid in and. Yeah.
00:00:45.621 - 00:00:46.745, Speaker C: Plus toy form.
00:00:48.565 - 00:01:00.673, Speaker B: All right, well, hello, everybody. Welcome to Chopping Block live at token 2049 in Singapore.

I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice, legal advice, or even life Advice. Please see ChoppingBlock XYZ for more disclosures.
00:01:24.675 - 00:01:30.259, Speaker D: It's very true that this disclaimer matters more live because there's only financial advice at this conference.
00:01:30.387 - 00:01:33.643, Speaker B: That's true, that's true. We're getting a lot of advice today from Arthur.
00:01:33.779 - 00:01:34.451, Speaker D: Just saying.
00:01:34.523 - 00:01:43.027, Speaker B: So, okay, so we're here live in Singapore. Token 2049. What's the vibe been so far? This is like the flagship Asia event. What's the feeling on the ground?
00:01:43.131 - 00:01:44.483, Speaker C: A lot of fucking traffic.
00:01:44.579 - 00:01:45.067, Speaker B: A lot of traffic.
00:01:45.091 - 00:01:48.539, Speaker C: I had to walk my ass out of my car today to get in here. I was sweating like a motherfucker.
00:01:48.587 - 00:01:48.803, Speaker B: This is.
00:01:48.819 - 00:01:49.475, Speaker C: What the fuck?
00:01:49.555 - 00:02:00.275, Speaker D: Yeah, I think. Conferences during F1. It's a dumbass idea. I'm not going to lie, because the infrastructure sucks. They're closing all the roads. It's just like. It's a nightmare.
00:02:00.275 - 00:02:01.335, Speaker D: I Don't get it.
00:02:01.835 - 00:02:15.931, Speaker B: I don't know. It gets people to come out. But I agree with you. I, like, missed. I actually literally just missed a panel that you were on because I was trying to get a taxi that normally would take five minutes. It was like 45 minutes to get across just, like, two intersections.
00:02:16.003 - 00:02:20.175, Speaker E: I had to sub in and be haseeb. I was going to go bald for that one, but they wouldn't let me do it.
00:02:20.855 - 00:02:48.827, Speaker B: You just get a ball cap and basically the same. Yeah, okay. Damn. Well, so one of the things happening at token 2049 is, of course, breakpoint happens right after token 2049, which is the big flagship Solana event. And there was just a little bit of drama taking place on Twitter that Iggy Azalea, friend of the show, she. It turns out she was going to do a debate on stage with Eric Wall, and they were going to debate whether or not celeb coins are good for crypto. Now, everyone was very excited.
00:02:48.827 - 00:03:13.403, Speaker B: I was very excited about this debate. Unfortunately, this debate has been canceled. And it was canceled because Iggy Azalea was planning to plant strippers in the audience wearing business suits, and they were going to jump out in the middle of the debate and start twerking on stage. And apparently this was not allowed by Singaporean regulators. And so she was like, look, I can't actually do a debate. Wait, wait, wait, wait. The whole plan, Was it for it.
00:03:13.419 - 00:03:19.919, Speaker D: To be a joke, put regulators in quotes? If you read the tweet, just saying.
00:03:20.047 - 00:03:21.635, Speaker B: I don't know. I don't know. Thoughts?
00:03:22.295 - 00:03:25.919, Speaker A: This sounds like something I would do if I were going to lose a debate and find some bullshit excuse to.
00:03:25.927 - 00:03:26.527, Speaker D: Get out of it.
00:03:26.591 - 00:03:29.311, Speaker A: So I'd be scared, too, if I were going. Eric.
00:03:29.503 - 00:03:30.383, Speaker B: Eric's pretty fierce.
00:03:30.439 - 00:03:33.471, Speaker C: Maybe she just pump her tokens some more and people wouldn't eat the strippers. I don't know.
00:03:33.623 - 00:03:41.075, Speaker E: I mean, if that's what it takes to get people to break point. But now apparently not happening. So who's going to sub in now? Is that going to be totally on stage twerking?
00:03:42.015 - 00:03:42.751, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:03:42.903 - 00:03:48.415, Speaker D: I mean, now Tom Schmidt is an enemy of the mother community based on that comment he just made.
00:03:49.395 - 00:03:52.723, Speaker A: Community. Still, I feel like when your token goes down, you're even more of an.
00:03:52.739 - 00:03:54.163, Speaker D: Enemy for saying that one.
00:03:54.299 - 00:04:06.643, Speaker B: I will say, since we criticized Mother, Mother has actually been kind of down, only. Well, I rebounded a little bit. But I think it's like, at the time that we were talking about on the show, it was worth like 250 million now it's like 40 million, something like that.
00:04:06.739 - 00:04:08.011, Speaker C: It's still above zero, though.
00:04:08.123 - 00:04:20.949, Speaker B: It's still. It's still above zero. It's still above zero. And to Iggy's credit, she has been grinding. Clearly, she was planning to grind on stage, so it's like, you know, she was really going at it. You were just telling us a story about another celeb here in Singapore. Do you want to recount that story?
00:04:20.997 - 00:04:34.229, Speaker C: Yeah. So I get this message from my chief of staff. He's like, this motherfucker, Jason Derulo wants to have a meeting. I'm like, I don't know who the fuck this guy is. I'm an EDM house guy. So I looked this motherfucker up and said, oh, okay. I guess he's kind of famous.
00:04:34.229 - 00:05:02.795, Speaker C: And so my chief of staff has a meeting with this guy, and he's like, yo, I'm coming to Singapore, and I want to come to your party, and why don't you pay me $100,000 to get on stage and sing a song? And I was like, how about no? And then I get a message from his man. He's like, yo, Jason had some deal with some decks, and it fell through. And he was supposed to make 80 grand to come to Singapore. Why don't you do him a solid and pay him to come to your event? We'd owe you one. Nah.
00:05:05.375 - 00:05:08.687, Speaker B: Is this how business gets done in Singapore? Is this the. I don't know.
00:05:08.711 - 00:05:09.063, Speaker C: I guess.
00:05:09.119 - 00:05:10.423, Speaker B: All right, all right.
00:05:10.599 - 00:05:13.075, Speaker E: Everyone in the audience wants to know which exchange.
00:05:14.815 - 00:05:16.111, Speaker C: I'm not going to flip them like that.
00:05:16.183 - 00:05:17.359, Speaker B: We're not going to sell them out.
00:05:17.527 - 00:05:18.183, Speaker E: Sorry, sorry.
00:05:18.239 - 00:05:20.183, Speaker B: We want them to get. We want them to book subsequent celebrities.
00:05:20.239 - 00:05:21.079, Speaker E: Okay, okay.
00:05:21.127 - 00:05:21.623, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:05:21.759 - 00:05:30.415, Speaker A: The lesson here is you can't be dependent on somebody else's Dex. You know, you got to do your own decks. You got to do your own token Iggy. You know, I give her credit for that. No, no. Dex partnership is going to fall prefer.
00:05:30.535 - 00:05:43.387, Speaker B: So, yeah, I mean, the. The celebs at crypto events. Meta does feel like it's. It's evolved over the years. We went from. I mean, what would you say was, like, the high points and the low points of celebs in crypto Meta, was.
00:05:43.411 - 00:05:44.815, Speaker D: There ever a high point?
00:05:46.155 - 00:05:49.055, Speaker B: I mean, we're about to hit a new high point with Donald Trump.
00:05:49.635 - 00:06:00.735, Speaker A: That is kind of true. Someone was joking that when you see Diplo performing at the conference, that's the top. But Diplo is coming back in, so maybe he's like, evergreen, there's Always going to be Diplo no matter what you do.
00:06:01.195 - 00:06:09.213, Speaker B: I don't know. Diplo is not a down bad kind of. Yeah. You know. Yeah. I don't know. But bear market, there must have been, like, some really bad celeb bookings.
00:06:09.269 - 00:06:12.269, Speaker D: No, it's always like, do you like.
00:06:12.277 - 00:06:13.813, Speaker C: To lose money on the stage? I don't think so.
00:06:13.869 - 00:06:14.461, Speaker B: Yeah. I don't know.
00:06:14.493 - 00:06:14.677, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:06:14.701 - 00:06:16.229, Speaker E: I don't think any of us do that. Yeah.
00:06:16.317 - 00:06:30.903, Speaker B: All right. I'm the wrong person to ask. I don't go to any of these things, so I'm pretty boring. Okay. So speaking of celeb coins, let's talk about the elephant in the room. World Liberty Financial. So World Liberty Financial, for those of you who've been under rock, that is the Trump family Defi product.
00:06:30.903 - 00:06:57.475, Speaker B: Okay. So they very recently, I think it just, as of yesterday, they did a Twitter spaces. So they've been teasing a lot of stuff. They've been kind of, you know, hinting that this thing is going to happen, but there wasn't a lot of detail. And so everyone was very excited about this Twitter space that was going to go live by the guys at Rug Radio. And this happened the day after the Trump assassination attempt. They were supposed to go to Mar A Lago to do this Twitter space, but it was delayed by a day because someone tried to kill him.
00:06:57.475 - 00:07:09.175, Speaker B: And so they were like, no, no, just come back tomorrow. It's cool. So they went to Mar A Lago the next day and they did this Twitter space. And so, Tom, you listened to the Twitter space. Talk us through what you learned about World Liberty Financial.
00:07:09.755 - 00:07:31.677, Speaker A: It was pretty crazy. I, you know, I wanted to withhold judgment because I want, you know, you know, wait till see what they launch. And I feel like you still have to withhold judgment because it was like two hours of just like, no content. It was like, you know, you put, it's like, you know, sometimes people put like five sims in a room and they start kind of like interacting in weird ways. And kind of felt like that, like, there's nothing to do. There wasn't like a job. But there's kind of like playing off each other.
00:07:31.677 - 00:07:47.109, Speaker A: And there's like, this is the most like, like, asinine, like, non sequitur, like, clips of our. Like, one that's kind of going right now is Trump was talking about Baron being like a defi genius because he has like four wallets. And I was like, what the fuck is going on right now? Yeah, it's incredible.
00:07:47.157 - 00:07:47.597, Speaker B: Incredible.
00:07:47.661 - 00:07:51.021, Speaker C: Does he have an Aptos wallet? Is it an Aptos wallet?
00:07:51.093 - 00:07:57.365, Speaker E: I could be one that. We don't comment on that, but maybe so my.
00:07:57.945 - 00:08:21.649, Speaker A: I think everyone is waiting to get more details and the only good news is, yeah, there was this article that went out maybe about a week ago talking about how 70% of the token was going to be pre allocated for insiders. It sounds like that's now flipping. But this is the other weird part. They're doing a reg D sale. Like they're registering with the SEC for the sale of this token, which I don't even know why or how they're doing that. The whole thing is just like it's from Mars. I don't like it.
00:08:21.657 - 00:08:22.889, Speaker B: Is it coinless sale?
00:08:23.057 - 00:08:24.321, Speaker A: I have no idea.
00:08:24.433 - 00:08:25.365, Speaker B: Okay. Wow.
00:08:25.905 - 00:08:27.605, Speaker E: This is going to be a buyer.
00:08:28.185 - 00:08:28.945, Speaker C: I was going to say it's going.
00:08:28.945 - 00:08:32.561, Speaker E: To be a very interesting deal memo coming out of that Twitter space from top.
00:08:32.753 - 00:08:35.609, Speaker A: I just, you know, I'm hoping for the best.
00:08:35.697 - 00:08:39.041, Speaker B: So what, so what does the protocol do? Do they explain what the protocol does? No, they've not.
00:08:39.073 - 00:08:40.825, Speaker A: That was not part of the discussion.
00:08:40.945 - 00:08:45.841, Speaker C: But that part of crypto. Right, you don't tell them what it is, what it does, just launch it.
00:08:45.873 - 00:08:46.725, Speaker E: Yeah, yeah.
00:08:47.505 - 00:08:52.511, Speaker D: Well, did they at least say before the election or after the election? When's the launch?
00:08:52.703 - 00:08:54.743, Speaker A: I think it's coming up because.
00:08:54.879 - 00:09:07.047, Speaker B: Well, no, no, no. So there's a poly market market on whether or not Trump will launch a token before the election. And before the Twitter space it was trading at 80% and during the. After the Twitter space it plummeted to 25.
00:09:07.191 - 00:09:27.707, Speaker A: Maybe people are skeptical of the overall sort of shape of it. I mean, we know it's going to be a lending protocol. Initially there was some teasing that it's going to be somehow RWA real estate related. Seems like that's not likely to be the case. Seems like it is going to be this kind of like doe finance ave kind of fork. But like why now? Why this is kind of unclear. I do kind of like the.
00:09:27.707 - 00:09:40.455, Speaker A: They have this kind of like populist message though to World Liberty Financial of like, you know, the big banks, they're ripping you off and we're going to, you know, give finance back to the people. So they're leaning with that, which I guess is better than nothing.
00:09:40.795 - 00:10:01.237, Speaker B: That resonates. Yeah, I can feel that. So okay, how, what do we think? Let's say, let's say World Liberty Financial were to drop tomorrow and let's say, let's say fully diluted valuation, there's 10% floating, you know, Standard crypto. Crypto launch. What do you think the fully diluted valuation would be, Arthur pursue 10 billion. 10 billion.
00:10:01.381 - 00:10:01.989, Speaker D: 10 billion.
00:10:02.037 - 00:10:03.757, Speaker B: So a billion floating. A billion floating.
00:10:03.821 - 00:10:04.461, Speaker C: Billion floating.
00:10:04.533 - 00:10:05.981, Speaker B: Okay. Mo, what do you think?
00:10:06.093 - 00:10:10.585, Speaker E: Oh, man, that's. I mean, 10 is really 10.
00:10:10.925 - 00:10:12.149, Speaker C: People are Muppets.
00:10:12.317 - 00:10:21.469, Speaker D: But it's a meme coin. Like, what meme coin hit 10 billion? That this wouldn't be the first one on launch. Wow, that's crazy. I don't know. I'm. That's.
00:10:21.517 - 00:10:26.557, Speaker E: I'm dumbfounded, I guess. Based on Tom's DD, I think I'll go with 7. 7.
00:10:26.700 - 00:10:27.637, Speaker B: 7 billion.
00:10:27.701 - 00:10:32.705, Speaker D: Yeah, I go a little under that. Well, I have to play place prices. Right. Rule 6.9 billion.
00:10:41.935 - 00:10:43.835, Speaker E: Like, jokes in that one.
00:10:44.375 - 00:10:57.807, Speaker A: I'm going to be a little bit more bearish. I'm going to go, too. I think part of the problem is it's just not fun. I feel like if you had tasked me with creating a Trump defi protocol, we could all sorts of fun stuff. We couldn't like Trump dot fun. You know, we could run Trump Swap.
00:10:57.871 - 00:10:58.799, Speaker B: Wow, that would be great.
00:10:58.847 - 00:10:59.007, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:10:59.031 - 00:11:04.287, Speaker A: You know, it's supposed to be, like, fun and approachable, and whichever one of.
00:11:04.311 - 00:11:08.795, Speaker D: You assholes starts Trump dot fun, you owe me.
00:11:10.175 - 00:11:11.595, Speaker E: I'll get 20%.
00:11:12.895 - 00:11:15.695, Speaker C: Just make sure Shrek, he's on it. It's going to do well.
00:11:16.635 - 00:11:17.011, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:11:17.043 - 00:11:19.379, Speaker A: Be a little whimsical with it. It's just a little boring, you know?
00:11:19.427 - 00:11:33.815, Speaker B: Okay. Okay. Yeah, I guess I'll go in the middle. I'll go with, like, 404.5. It feels to me like. So Trump, to be clear, is the most famous man in the world. Maybe Elon Musk, but Trump is more famous than Elon.
00:11:33.815 - 00:11:49.441, Speaker B: That being said, it doesn't feel like he's trying that hard. And that's the thing that feels like the most disappointing about this is how lazy it feels. You know, he's doing, like, one Twitter space every, like, month, and then one tweet a month, and that's about it. And besides that, it's like, compared to.
00:11:49.473 - 00:11:57.925, Speaker D: Most other meme coin creators, he has a lot more going on, though, to be. To be honest. Right. Like. Like, Jason Drill doesn't have shit to do other than Master Jar.
00:11:59.105 - 00:12:01.625, Speaker B: That's fair. That's fair. Okay. Interesting.
00:12:01.705 - 00:12:03.365, Speaker E: People don't have to work as hard, man.
00:12:04.545 - 00:12:25.761, Speaker B: Be lazy. Yeah. All right, all right. So the interesting thing also is that we've seen this parade of advisors for World Liberty Financial. So a few of the advisors who have been announced so far, one of them is Sandy from Scroll, co founder of Scroll. Another one is Cryptogle, who's a crypto security person who's been on the show before. Third person is Luke Pearson from Polychain.
00:12:25.833 - 00:12:27.233, Speaker A: I think it's a different Luke, but.
00:12:27.329 - 00:12:30.921, Speaker B: Different Luke. Yeah, some Luke from Polychain. Yeah. Any other advisors have been announced?
00:12:30.953 - 00:12:31.905, Speaker E: I think it's Luke Pearson.
00:12:31.985 - 00:12:56.137, Speaker B: I think. Oh, it is Luke Pearson. I think it's Luke. So it's like kind of a random hodgepodge of people. And I remember I was chatting with somebody who was one of the. Who was one of the advisors to World Liberty Financial. And what they told me was that the advisors to World Liberty Financial, the way they're thinking about it is that they know the project is kind of shady, but they're joining because they see the other advisors all kind of feel the same way.
00:12:56.201 - 00:12:58.685, Speaker D: So it's a Canadian beauty contest for advising.
00:13:00.265 - 00:13:16.413, Speaker B: No, no, no. The way they described it is like we're sort of the adults in the room. And as long as we have, like, these people around the table, we can nudge the project in the right direction. And if it's not nudging, then we can all walk out and make that, like, a signal to everybody else. I'm like, okay, get away from this thing.
00:13:16.509 - 00:13:26.065, Speaker D: I, too, have seen an episode of Rugrats where all the kids convince themselves they're the parents. Like, what? This is a ridiculous kind of, like, fallacy.
00:13:26.765 - 00:13:29.491, Speaker B: I'm not defending it. I'm just saying that's. That's. That's what.
00:13:29.563 - 00:13:38.187, Speaker D: Okay. Would you have been an advisor if someone, like, suppose in a world where. Where you could say yes would. What would make you. What would push you over the edge?
00:13:38.291 - 00:13:41.323, Speaker B: I mean, so we have a kind of a blanket thing at Dragonfly. We don't advise.
00:13:41.419 - 00:13:41.939, Speaker A: Yeah, sure, sure.
00:13:41.947 - 00:13:42.495, Speaker D: I.
00:13:43.715 - 00:13:55.067, Speaker B: Let's say that wasn't true. I don't know, man. I just feel like it would just shave years off my life to be advising World Liberty friendly. I just feel like. I feel like it, like, does not invite good juju in your life to be associated with.
00:13:55.131 - 00:13:59.405, Speaker D: Now let's go to the other side. Arthur, what would it take for you to advise World Liberty Financial?
00:13:59.555 - 00:14:00.245, Speaker C: Billion.
00:14:00.665 - 00:14:01.777, Speaker D: Yeah, billion.
00:14:01.841 - 00:14:02.849, Speaker C: I bought 10 more.
00:14:02.897 - 00:14:04.017, Speaker B: 10 of the token supply.
00:14:04.041 - 00:14:06.953, Speaker E: He's already done this math. 10 billion, FTV. I want 10.
00:14:07.129 - 00:14:07.457, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:14:07.481 - 00:14:10.565, Speaker A: I feel like Jason Derulo might be a value player there. You know, Bring on.
00:14:11.185 - 00:14:13.777, Speaker C: That's the right question. What's my cut?
00:14:13.881 - 00:14:16.889, Speaker B: Yeah. All right. You just need. You need 100 derulos and then you're in. Yeah.
00:14:16.977 - 00:14:20.329, Speaker D: All right. Donald Trump Jr. If you're listening, Arthur's lines.
00:14:20.377 - 00:14:21.585, Speaker B: For sale. Yeah, for sale.
00:14:21.665 - 00:14:22.873, Speaker E: What about you? What about Tarun?
00:14:22.969 - 00:14:23.265, Speaker D: Huh?
00:14:23.305 - 00:14:24.165, Speaker E: What about you?
00:14:25.315 - 00:14:28.015, Speaker D: Would never do it, really. I'm too afraid.
00:14:29.715 - 00:14:30.867, Speaker B: What are you afraid of?
00:14:31.011 - 00:14:43.787, Speaker D: Imagine there's a rug. Pull on that shit. You will get chased down by the people who threw shit at Citadel's headquarters on Fire. After GameStop, you're going to get, like, the craziest people following you. I don't want to be anywhere near.
00:14:43.811 - 00:14:46.455, Speaker E: That for a billion dollars, so I'll live there.
00:14:47.835 - 00:14:49.691, Speaker B: You buy a lot of lawyers a billion dollars?
00:14:49.723 - 00:14:52.061, Speaker D: Man, I don't know.
00:14:52.133 - 00:15:07.821, Speaker B: Yeah, well, you were mentioning so on a previous show, you were talking a lot of shit about the Trump family coin. The Trump family meme coin, as you put it. Or a meme coin with a lot more steps, I think is the way that you described it. Talk a little bit for the audience about what that experience was like.
00:15:07.853 - 00:15:24.557, Speaker D: Afterwards, my DMs were just filled with a lot of anons telling me how much they think my opinions suck. So I was just like, all right, you know what? I gotta stay the fuck away from this asset. Asset class. It deserves its own category.
00:15:24.741 - 00:15:25.853, Speaker C: They hurt you so bad.
00:15:25.909 - 00:15:29.933, Speaker D: Yes. I don't know if they're worth 10% of the supply. Maybe.
00:15:30.029 - 00:15:30.745, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:15:31.405 - 00:15:32.905, Speaker D: I got to get to your level.
00:15:33.285 - 00:15:35.845, Speaker B: All right, so the asset class being celeb coins.
00:15:36.005 - 00:15:38.693, Speaker D: The asset class being presidential celebrity coins.
00:15:38.749 - 00:15:44.845, Speaker B: Presidential celebrity. That's a pretty narrow. Yeah, pretty narrow asset class. Arthur, what's your take on celebrity coins as a category?
00:15:44.965 - 00:15:49.157, Speaker C: They're great, but I guess most of them aren't doing so well price performance wise.
00:15:49.261 - 00:15:51.481, Speaker B: Yeah. So. And why are they great?
00:15:51.673 - 00:15:56.645, Speaker C: Attention to the space, activity on chain, new people using stuff. It's great.
00:15:56.985 - 00:16:00.913, Speaker B: You don't think that attention is like, okay, short term it's good. Long term, it ends up reflecting badly.
00:16:01.009 - 00:16:07.085, Speaker C: I mean, if we convert 10% of people who logged on to one of these chains and we've done something valuable.
00:16:07.625 - 00:16:10.001, Speaker B: Or whatever it is, all onboarding is good onboarding.
00:16:10.073 - 00:16:10.545, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:16:10.625 - 00:16:11.313, Speaker B: Okay. All right.
00:16:11.369 - 00:16:17.015, Speaker D: Okay. So what's your celebrity coin plan? Now that. Now that for aptos.
00:16:21.275 - 00:16:37.379, Speaker E: I thought I had a celebrity coin for Aptos coming up. I mean, I agree. I think. I think they are good at capturing attention, but they all have. I mean, we just talked about the price appreciation for Iggy and like, that. That sours a lot of people too. And so I think, like, what is.
00:16:37.379 - 00:16:54.441, Speaker E: Is it. Is there a net benefit? Because if the people lose money like, yes, you captured a couple, but the. The rest of the mob crowd that's sliding into your DMs like, that to me, is just so net negative. And we haven't pursued any celebrity coins. No plans in the short run, but we can't stop anybody, right?
00:16:54.513 - 00:16:59.273, Speaker D: I'm waiting for dollar sign, Arthur, because, like, clearly you could get one right now.
00:16:59.369 - 00:17:03.565, Speaker E: One billion. I'll take the other nine.
00:17:04.745 - 00:17:06.033, Speaker B: If you watch any coin, as they.
00:17:06.049 - 00:17:07.441, Speaker C: Say, don't get high on your own supply.
00:17:07.513 - 00:17:08.285, Speaker E: That's right.
00:17:08.864 - 00:17:09.576, Speaker B: All right.
00:17:09.720 - 00:17:12.484, Speaker E: What does that break up look like on the pie chart?
00:17:13.704 - 00:17:16.704, Speaker C: Greater than 100%, you know, because I'm good at math.
00:17:16.824 - 00:17:17.616, Speaker E: It's a square.
00:17:17.680 - 00:17:18.088, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:17:18.176 - 00:17:56.855, Speaker B: So I remember. So a while back, we talked about this on the show. There was all this drama about, you know, Ansem being this kind of gateway for a lot of celebrities coming into crypto. And I remember, I think it was Kobe who was criticizing Ansem and saying, you know, look, if a celebrity wants to get into crypto, is the right way to get a celebrity into crypto to get them to launch a token with their name on it? Or is it just do what everyone else does and just, like, buy bitcoin and ether and, like, do the normal thing that everybody else does is, like, invest in the space? Mo. I want to get. I want to get your take on this. As somebody who runs an ecosystem, what do you think about the healthiness for an ecosystem of getting, you know, people from outside who are like, oh, I can make a quick buck.
00:17:56.855 - 00:18:06.257, Speaker B: I can monetize my fame coming into an ecosystem saying, great. You know, the sort of Jason Derulos of the world pop in and say, yo, will you do me a solid? And, like, you know, I mean, about that.
00:18:06.401 - 00:18:08.725, Speaker E: Ansem's backstage, right? I think he's coming up next.
00:18:10.545 - 00:18:11.925, Speaker C: Don't worry, you can't box.
00:18:15.145 - 00:18:24.537, Speaker E: I did more tie, so I don't know. I'd be down to explore with him, but I guess, like, what's the question is. The question is, how do we get those people on board?
00:18:24.561 - 00:18:43.233, Speaker B: And then the question is, like, you know, with respect to meme coins, there's a lot of criticism now of meme coins as well. Yeah, it's kind of same category in that when you get into the late cycle of meme coins, in the beginning, it's like, oh, it's fun. It's getting people in the space late cycle of meme coins, people are like, oh, pump fun. It's kind of extractive. It's pulling money out of the ecosystem. How do you think about that as somebody who's trying to cultivate an ecosystem?
00:18:43.289 - 00:18:55.601, Speaker E: Yeah, I mean, I think what's fun about it? I think what's fun about meme coins is like, you see price going up and people piling in and people talking about things. And sure, you get some fun components on Twitter, but that's really the fun is making money.
00:18:55.633 - 00:18:55.897, Speaker C: Right.
00:18:55.961 - 00:19:19.553, Speaker E: Let's be honest. And so how can you actually achieve that beyond just doing, you know, meme coin activity, celeb coin activity, NFTs, ICO, you know, go back to every cycle. I mean, for our perspective, we think applications, whether they're defi applications that offer economic incentives, those are much more interesting for us. They show demonstration of our protocols, performance. They bring in people that get economic value, they're having fun trading.
00:19:19.609 - 00:19:19.801, Speaker C: Right?
00:19:19.833 - 00:19:45.229, Speaker E: Like making money. And that's awesome. From there, like, how do you cast a much wider net from a distribution perspective? I mean, you were in Korea with us, right? We're working with South Korea Telco, 30 million phone subscribers. They built t wallet going to be in, you know, potentially 30 million devices. If you think about that, like an Aptos is the preferred blockchain. Of course I got to do the plug. But imagine all those people having fun making money on aptos products.
00:19:45.229 - 00:20:16.465, Speaker E: Like that is a little bit more sustainable and I think far more interesting. And then you can of course pile on and bring in all the meme coin stuff, all the fun NFT stuff. But there's so much more beyond that, right? Like webtoons, for example. I don't know how many people in the audience are listening know about webtoons. Webtoons is a comic strip that just, you know, has an episode every week. A bunch of different artists contribute to it. If you have a mobile device that allows you to make money and also take that money and deploy it into your favorite artist that has the next cartoon episode or a comic book episode coming, you can make money off of that too.
00:20:16.465 - 00:20:25.577, Speaker E: So, like, there's fun, there's actual entertainment versus like chasing the hype of a meme coin or entertainment coin that we think is shorter fueled.
00:20:25.681 - 00:21:03.917, Speaker B: Right? Okay. You were mentioning what's going on in Korea, and I wanted to switch subjects a little bit to talk about a recent report that was dropped by Chainalysis, which was the global crypto adoption index. So every year, Chainalysis, they rank all the different countries in the world using a bunch of signals from like both on chain data as well as, you know, website and kind of online visits to try to get a sense of how different countries are adopting crypto with respect to total number of users and total amount of online activity. Now, someone had my doubts about their methodology, but here's the list of countries that they had by ranking. Okay, number one. Anyone want to guess what the number one was? Does anyone know?
00:21:04.021 - 00:21:07.865, Speaker C: Is it percentage, penetration, or nominal notional number of people?
00:21:08.565 - 00:21:20.815, Speaker B: It's kind of unclear. They don't actually specify exactly what they're doing, but it seems like it's mostly about people. Okay, it seems like it's more about people. Does anyone want to guess what the number one country was? Philippines. Philippines. No. Good guess, though.
00:21:20.815 - 00:21:23.787, Speaker B: Number one was India.
00:21:23.931 - 00:21:24.475, Speaker E: India.
00:21:24.595 - 00:21:32.691, Speaker B: India was number one. So I'll go down the list. India, then Nigeria, then Indonesia. Number four is USA. Number five. Vietnam. Six.
00:21:32.691 - 00:21:36.747, Speaker B: Ukraine. Seven. Russia. Eight. Philippines. Nine. Pakistan.
00:21:36.747 - 00:21:42.445, Speaker B: Ten. Brazil. 19th is Korea. And then 20th is China.
00:21:42.565 - 00:21:43.709, Speaker E: 19Th is who?
00:21:43.837 - 00:21:55.589, Speaker B: Korea. Wow, 19th is Korea. So now I'm kind of doubtful that this methodology, like that just doesn't really seem true to me that India is like the number one country for crypto adoption.
00:21:55.677 - 00:21:59.981, Speaker C: I mean, they put a 1% tax on trading and volume went to zero. So I don't know.
00:22:00.013 - 00:22:01.905, Speaker D: I mean, yeah, there's no volume there.
00:22:02.285 - 00:22:18.615, Speaker B: Look, I have no idea. I'm just telling you what the report says. So I think Nicarta recently did a piece, like, analyzing some of this, but it feels like it may be that they're over indexing on like website visits. Just like the raw number of people in India and the fact that China, you know, China, everyone has to use a vpn.
00:22:18.735 - 00:22:24.515, Speaker D: Maybe, maybe this is really an index of where developers of all this shit are not actually users.
00:22:24.895 - 00:22:28.943, Speaker B: The website clicks an index of click farms. Basically.
00:22:28.959 - 00:22:29.367, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:22:29.471 - 00:22:38.963, Speaker B: Yeah. I don't know. Okay, interesting. But so. But you were in a Korea blockchain. Would you also go to Korea? I was, yeah. Okay, so what was the vibe that you guys saw in Korea? How did it differ from what you're seeing here in Southeast Asia?
00:22:39.019 - 00:23:05.701, Speaker C: I mean, the Koreans love to trade. The Koreans trade the most of any country per capita for crypto in the world. It started with traditional financial markets. The Cosby options market was the largest options market in the world until the regulators banned it because everybody was just gambling like crazy motherfuckers. And so they love crypto. And as much as the politicians want to push back on it, the young population wants it so bad that they have no tax on it yet they've been.
00:23:05.733 - 00:23:06.021, Speaker B: Keep.
00:23:06.093 - 00:23:31.433, Speaker C: Keep delaying it. You know, they basically introduced some new rules to codify how listings happen on, you know, the upbeats and the bit thumbs of the world. And you know, from Maelstrom's perspective, we get a lot of questions from our portfolios like how do we get on a Korean exchange? Because that's where the traders are, that's where the people who want to own these assets and trade them and ad liquidity and all that sort of stuff. So I am, I'm very surprised at the, that reports at 19th. I think they're, they've got to be top three.
00:23:31.529 - 00:23:32.097, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:23:32.161 - 00:24:16.269, Speaker E: I think we definitely need to look into the asterisks and how they calculated this thing. I mean India is not a surprise just by sheer volume, but I would say Korea probably, definitely should be higher. I mean we had aptos experience there last two weeks ago and you know we've been really big in Korea, right, like you and you've seen all the momentum that take place before over the last five years. So we like, we have not only the largest corporate sponsors or partners working in that region but you know, we see a massive sense of appetite in terms of volume and you know, propensity to try new things. And so I mean Korea like the vibe is completely different on the ground. Like you were there, we were out every night, everyone is interested. We launched something called the aptos card, a cold storage that ties to your Petra account.
00:24:16.269 - 00:24:43.621, Speaker E: You get APT on it or USDT now that USDT is available and people were lining up trying to get a card because they knew that there's so many cool things that they could do with it. And so like the interest, the young generation there that's so open to trying new things is rampant there. And so and I would say India is probably very similar, right? Like the consumer behavior, the propensity to try new things is really high in these markets. So that's not a surprise for India. But Korea, that we gotta talk to Sergey about that.
00:24:43.733 - 00:25:04.435, Speaker B: I mean one thing that's always confused me is that Korea and Japan are kind of similar culturally. Like they're both like, you know, sort of these conglomerate driven countries, low birth rates, you know, it's like you're both kind of similar type economies. Korea loves crypto. It's like you know, 15 to 20% of adults, only one of them had magic.
00:25:04.475 - 00:25:08.895, Speaker D: The gathering online exchange though, let's be real, like what the fuck are you talking about?
00:25:09.355 - 00:25:15.095, Speaker B: But the weird thing is that Japan like crypto is just like not nearly as much of a thing there. Taxes.
00:25:15.955 - 00:25:24.523, Speaker C: Japan used to be a massive crypto trading market and the regulators there put a tax on trading and destroyed the market. And so that's why you don't see the.
00:25:24.579 - 00:25:29.091, Speaker B: Is that what it is? I see. Interesting, interesting. So why does Korea have no taxes on crypto?
00:25:29.243 - 00:25:35.055, Speaker C: Because the population is so agitated for crypto that a politician proposing that is not going to get reelected.
00:25:35.875 - 00:25:49.325, Speaker B: Okay, so it's just like you. I mean, what's the theory of the case there? If you. If you had to make the crypto germ spread more through different countries, like, how did Korea end up there and Japan ended up totally in the opposite direction? Like, what's your theory of the case?
00:25:50.145 - 00:25:54.673, Speaker C: I don't know. I mean, yeah, let people trade and they're going to love it. It's fun.
00:25:54.849 - 00:26:07.333, Speaker D: As Mo was saying, I think pensioners got burned out on all the Cardano and XRP they were buying back in the day. Like, let's be real. Like, that's like the Japanese pensioner meme thing is a real fucking.
00:26:07.449 - 00:26:10.341, Speaker B: You think it was either choice of coins that led them in? Different.
00:26:10.413 - 00:26:12.197, Speaker D: I think they were just a little too early.
00:26:12.301 - 00:26:13.145, Speaker E: I feel like.
00:26:15.565 - 00:26:19.197, Speaker D: It was like a little too early. And so then they bottled the dog shit.
00:26:19.301 - 00:26:20.557, Speaker B: I see. Okay. Actually.
00:26:20.621 - 00:26:23.093, Speaker D: And then they lost Mount Gox. Come on.
00:26:23.149 - 00:26:23.709, Speaker E: That's true.
00:26:23.797 - 00:26:25.901, Speaker D: That's like seared into national memory.
00:26:26.013 - 00:26:29.345, Speaker B: Maybe, maybe. I mean, it was so tiny at that time. Like, not that many people.
00:26:29.805 - 00:26:31.669, Speaker D: It made the news everywhere there.
00:26:31.757 - 00:26:33.949, Speaker B: Sure. Well, so I heard Mark's launching a.
00:26:33.957 - 00:26:37.945, Speaker A: New exchange too, so this might be coming back. Yeah, second act.
00:26:38.525 - 00:26:42.065, Speaker C: You learn double entry bookkeeping, accounting. You know, he learned some things.
00:26:43.205 - 00:27:16.637, Speaker B: So I heard. I was chatting with somebody today who's like this Korean, you know, guy who's very connected in Korea, and he was telling me that. So apparently Korean retail, like the sentiment in Korea shifted a lot after Terra collapsed, but even more so, not. Not actually Terra so much as Clayton. So Clayton, if you remember, it was Kakao's blockchain in Korea. And Clayton, apparently, like the chairman of Kakao or something, like some CEO of Kakao. Do you know the story? Basically, he was embezzling money from Clayton and he was like indicted or something.
00:27:16.637 - 00:27:33.857, Speaker B: And it's like this huge scandal in Korea, and as a result of that, Clayton ended up rebranding and fusing with some other Korean blockchain. There's like the whole. It's like a whole thing. And I had no idea that any of this had happened. But yeah, Clayton is no longer Clayton and now is a new name because of this scandal. Do you know the Story.
00:27:34.001 - 00:27:51.065, Speaker E: I mean, we know a little bit of the story. I mean, it's the reason Aptos, I think, ends up becoming an exciting option for everyone. But yeah, there are probably these types of stories across not just Korea and many markets. I mean, we talked about other new products.
00:27:51.145 - 00:27:53.441, Speaker B: I'm not trying to sell you down the river with your Korean friends. Sorry.
00:27:53.473 - 00:28:40.073, Speaker E: Yeah, I'm getting sweaty up here. But I do think going back to the point of just, you know, consumer behavior, I mean, you've seen Korea come out of a war many decades ago and go from, you know, one of the lowest GDP producing countries to one of the top, where they're top 11 now. And, you know, I think there's definitely a lot of pressure from the young generation to continue to allow for crypto to participate in these economy and be part of the economy. But I think what's more important to any, like political system or government system is to make sure that they are in that top tier ranking when it comes to gdp. And there's no denying across the globe that crypto is a big part of GDP now. And so whoever continues to facilitate the right structure, the right setup is going to win. And I think Korea is doing a piece of that.
00:28:40.073 - 00:28:44.305, Speaker E: And I'm probably a lot more. When the elections in the US you know.
00:28:44.385 - 00:28:46.265, Speaker B: Okay, materialize. All right, fair enough, fair enough.
00:28:46.305 - 00:28:56.003, Speaker A: I'm sure there's a group of Korean crypto podcasters who are discussing World Liberty Financial, similarly incredulous. Did you hear about this president and he's doing DeFi in the U.S. well.
00:28:56.019 - 00:29:12.055, Speaker D: I have to say your description of the Clayton story actually did remind me of Terra, because I don't know, this is a deep cut, but I don't know if you remember DegenBox, which the Tara foundation borrowed against and sent to. That was the same type of embezzlement as the Clayton embezzlement.
00:29:12.635 - 00:29:41.861, Speaker B: That's kind of true. That is kind of true. Okay, well. All right, well, speaking of embezzlement, let's talk about macro and the Fed. So, Arthur, you have, you've become now kind of in your. I'd say you're sort of this elder statesman of crypto at this point, and you write these long treatises talking about macro and given the moment that we're in right now. So just for, I mean, this show is probably going to come out on the podcast probably in two or three days, and by then everyone's going to know the size of the Fed rate cut and how the market responded.
00:29:41.861 - 00:30:01.205, Speaker B: Right now, we still don't know, so there's a lot of speculation that it's going to be 50 basis points as opposed to 25. But you wrote in a post recently that the story may be less about the size of the rate cut as the other channels of liquidity entering into the economy. Talk to us about what your thesis is of how people should be thinking about macro that they're ignoring.
00:30:01.325 - 00:31:02.481, Speaker C: So as I said today on stage in my keynote, the only thing that you need to look at is the dollar yen exchange rate. And so if the Fed's going to cut 50 or whatever it is, that's narrowing the differential between the Fed funds rate and the BOJ deposit rate. And the faster that the market believes that that rate is going to narrow, the more the yen is going to strengthen, the more traders who borrowed yen to buy assets around the world, US stocks, Treasury bonds, real estate, crypto as well, they're going to have to cover and sell what they can as fast as they can buy back yen to not lose a lot of money. And so if the Fed comes out and says, yeah, 50 basis points and the dot plot is super aggressive, I think that maybe the initial reaction is yay, rate cut. And then it's fucking slaughter. People are going to get absolutely carried out as yen goes through 130 because people are like, oh well, why the fuck? Why do I want to own this pair, have this trade on when I know that they're converging and the rate, the yen should strengthen. And so I think that's going to be a big problem.
00:31:02.481 - 00:31:28.559, Speaker C: And the response is they're going to cut more because they believe that that's the response to everything. Oh, if something's fucked up, oh, let's just cut some more. The reason why it didn't work is because we didn't do enough of it, so just do it more. Which obviously is good for us in a medium term perspective. But I do believe that crypto could be a bit correlated with all the other assets. If we do get a generalized sell off due to everyone now knowing, okay, the Fed is cutting rates, they cut, maybe it's 50. Right? That was aggressive.
00:31:28.559 - 00:31:45.211, Speaker C: They said the economy's weak or jobs are weak or whatever, they're going to cut more. $yen goes fucking 200 at some point, which again causes financial calamity. And then bad girl yelling to the rescue, let's print some fucking money. Because Kamala Harris needs to win the election.
00:31:45.403 - 00:31:53.255, Speaker B: So how do you position for this? Let's assume that they. Let's assume the audience completely believes you what? What's the portfolio position they should do?
00:31:53.795 - 00:31:56.227, Speaker D: I thought we're saying no financial advice.
00:31:56.331 - 00:31:58.051, Speaker B: We said those who are not giving.
00:31:58.083 - 00:32:03.935, Speaker D: Financial advice, just, just, just double checking.
00:32:04.955 - 00:32:28.893, Speaker C: Number one, obviously I'm long as fuck and it's more like, okay, do I want to take a tactical position while I'm at the bar, all fucked up? I'll just go short some bitcoin into the, into the Fed announcement and wait for a few days. If Yen responds as I think it's going to respond, then wait for the market to drop and then go long as fuck. Because the response is more money. We know what the response is. If there's any sort of hiccup before the election, they will print more money.
00:32:29.029 - 00:32:32.865, Speaker B: Right. Okay. Tarun, what's your, what's your take on this story? Do you believe this?
00:32:32.965 - 00:32:37.121, Speaker D: All I have to say is that Elizabeth Warren letter that asks for the.
00:32:37.153 - 00:32:39.765, Speaker B: 75 basis points describe this letter.
00:32:40.105 - 00:33:21.533, Speaker D: So I guess Elizabeth Warren wrote this letter to Jerome Powell that was, I want to say groveling almost for a 75 basis point cut and said it was needed in a lot of ways that were just like, we can't win the election without this cut. That would be my summary if you like, ask me to summarize it. Which is funny because this might actually be the first time there's like bipartisan support in this direction for anything like this. Macro wise. I don't know, I feel like the market's been pricing this in forever. I mean, you just look at all the implied spreads. It's like everyone thinks it's 50 basis points at least.
00:33:21.533 - 00:33:30.595, Speaker D: So I don't know. I don't think you're going to see some shock type of thing because I feel like the market's been feeling like this is going to happen for last month.
00:33:30.935 - 00:33:32.175, Speaker B: Tom, what's your take?
00:33:32.335 - 00:33:50.495, Speaker A: Yeah, the Warren thing was, that was very weird. I think, I don't remember like a time in my adult life when people have been this focused on the Fed, which is also very kind of unnerving. Like you have senators, you have random retail people kind of like watching like fomc, like you know, every single month. I'm like, this feels a little weird to me. Like, I don't, I don't.
00:33:50.615 - 00:33:53.023, Speaker C: But they should be watching it. It's so important.
00:33:53.159 - 00:34:01.869, Speaker A: So, yeah, maybe, maybe that's in a fucked up sort of way. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I don't know, I think it's always bizarre when it becomes kind of like top of mind for everybody again.
00:34:01.917 - 00:34:04.501, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, that is very true. Mo, what's your take?
00:34:04.653 - 00:34:19.277, Speaker E: I mean, Arthur said it. Well, I think. And it. And I think I agree with what Tarun is saying too. It's bizarrely a good thing for us short term and then maybe not medium term, but maybe longer term. And so that's. Yeah, that's kind of my view.
00:34:19.381 - 00:34:49.399, Speaker B: Okay. Yeah. I mean, it does feel like. So this rate cut aside, obviously a lot is going to be dependent on this election. And we're now getting closer and closer to November, and it's a story that everybody around the world is now talking about. At this point, it's just dominating headlines. We just saw Trump have a second assassination attempt against him, and it feels like we still don't know what comma, platform is going to be for crypto.
00:34:49.399 - 00:34:58.243, Speaker B: So, Arthur, again, as the kind of, you know, macro guru of the industry, how do you think about a common presidency and how it's going to end up playing for risk assets into crypto?
00:34:58.339 - 00:35:22.223, Speaker C: Well, first, I don't understand why crypto bros and gals are so pro Trump. Because Trump was president for four years and he did fuck all. And so now he wants a bunch of crypto donations. And so he says the right things out of his mouth, launches some defi dog shit or whatever he's doing. Right? And all of a sudden people are like, oh, yeah, you were president for four years. You had all this opportunity to do all these things and you did nothing. And so all of a sudden you're going to do something now? I don't think so.
00:35:22.239 - 00:35:24.319, Speaker B: You don't believe it. You think. You think he's just going to.
00:35:24.367 - 00:35:24.895, Speaker C: I don't believe any.
00:35:24.935 - 00:35:25.951, Speaker B: Sells crypto down the river.
00:35:26.023 - 00:35:52.477, Speaker C: Zero. And so then if you think what's the opposite that Kamala Harris. Well, the Democrats in their administration has been hostile to crypto. And my point is, who cares? It doesn't matter, right? Bitcoin went from 0 to whatever 1.5 or 1 point or 2 trillion, whatever the market cap is, with no regulatory clarity, with no support from any government regulators. We don't need them. Why grovel to these people to like, beg for scraps off of the table? Like continue building the stuff that you should be building.
00:35:52.661 - 00:35:55.141, Speaker B: Fuck them. Okay, all right, all right. We gotta.
00:35:55.253 - 00:36:16.099, Speaker C: So it doesn't matter at the end of the day. Cause the Republicans in the US Are gonna cut taxes without cutting spending. So the government deficit widens. And then the Democrats are gonna have more welfare payments and the government deficit widens. So at the end of the day, the US Government will borrow more bonds and will have to print more money to finance that debt. And so crypto will benefit. It doesn't matter who wins.
00:36:16.099 - 00:36:19.355, Speaker C: It's just a popularity clown contest on tv.
00:36:19.515 - 00:36:31.779, Speaker B: So you think that all the stuff that happened in 22, right, of, you know, Operation Choke Point and the SEC going after all these companies, you think it didn't matter and it didn't slow down the propagation of crypto?
00:36:31.947 - 00:36:50.257, Speaker C: No, absolutely not. Maybe, yeah. Of course it impacted some individual people and their individual projects, but we still have more wallets than today than there were in the past. We still have more people building. We have 20,000 tickets sold at this conference. 10,000 were sold last year. So more people are coming into this ecosystem.
00:36:50.257 - 00:36:54.577, Speaker C: They don't need Gary Gensler or someone to give them a stamp of approval, like, yes, you can invest in crypto.
00:36:54.641 - 00:36:59.433, Speaker B: Fuck you. All right, let's get it, let's get.
00:36:59.609 - 00:37:04.165, Speaker D: The only, only thing I'm disappointed about is you didn't use the word muppet, which you usually.
00:37:07.235 - 00:37:28.235, Speaker E: I mean, it is an interesting thing. Like people didn't stop building. People continue to build. We launched right in 22. And so despite all the sort of confusion around what is right, what is wrong, and the gray area, like, we continue to build. I think the sad thing is we did slow down though, right? We slowed down in the US and we were forced to. You know, I came to Korea eight times, I was in Singapore four times, Japan four times.
00:37:28.235 - 00:38:02.149, Speaker E: And so like you just kind of took people that are in New York and California and like pushed them out to 19 hour flights to Singapore. And everyone loves it here. So, like, that's going to continue to happen. I think that's good for the globe though, because now this innovation is disseminating in pockets where they can take things forward in much more interesting, more creative ways than we would have typically seen if this would only happen in Silicon Valley, although we're based in Silicon Valley, or only in New York, which was obviously the hub of crypto for a bit. So I think that's kind of good, right? Like, if the basis for your business.
00:38:02.197 - 00:38:12.341, Speaker C: Is that you require like, you know, to suck on the government tea to survive, then you shouldn't be doing crypto. Go back to traffic. That's how it works. Very profitable. No knocking it. Right.
00:38:12.453 - 00:38:14.533, Speaker B: All right, what's your take on the ETFs in that case?
00:38:14.629 - 00:38:15.149, Speaker C: And the what?
00:38:15.197 - 00:38:16.305, Speaker B: The ETFs.
00:38:16.845 - 00:38:39.427, Speaker C: The good things make the price go up, you know, more buying pressure. But I think if we will see how the ownership changes in the next. Was it, the 13F or whatever. I think a lot of the buyers of the ETF are basically just delta neutral basis trades. And so if the bitcoin basis comes down, they've unwound their positions. And so we'll see the millenniums and the 0.72s. And those sorts of folks have probably reduced their crypto exposure because they never really.
00:38:39.427 - 00:38:43.683, Speaker C: You're in it for the price appreciation of bitcoin, they're in it for a basis trade.
00:38:43.779 - 00:38:51.403, Speaker B: Yeah, but I mean, the reason why I'm asking is that the ETF was a result of basically sucking on the government teeth, as you put it. Right? Yeah.
00:38:51.499 - 00:39:21.237, Speaker C: And that's Larry Fink's business. Hey, we want to buy bitcoin, let you use your retirement account and put your money with us. It's just as if BlackRock and Vanguard are another arm of the US government, just like any other asset manager regulated by a domestic entity is an arm of their government. And so if you want money to stay within your system and not be in the hands of the people, then let the same trad five muppets come in. There you go, Muppets come in and take your money and say, we'll give you this piece of paper. Here's this bitcoin thing. It goes up in price, goes down in price.
00:39:21.237 - 00:39:35.513, Speaker C: You get this thing. But if you actually want to like, I don't know, buy some coffee from a single origin producer in Guatemala who doesn't have a bank account, this is not for you. So again, it's okay, you know, price number go up. Cool. But you're not actually using crypto.
00:39:35.609 - 00:39:44.025, Speaker E: Yeah, but it's still good though, in a way that it's at broader access and distribution and awareness to people that typically would not be willing to or may not feel comfortable going to an exchange.
00:39:44.065 - 00:39:51.457, Speaker C: Right, Yeah. I mean, I'm not knocking it. I get it. Passive investing is the thing. If you have money in a retirement account and you can't get it out, this is the only thing you can buy then.
00:39:51.561 - 00:39:52.177, Speaker B: Okay, cool.
00:39:52.241 - 00:39:53.365, Speaker C: Makes sense. Yeah.
00:39:53.825 - 00:40:02.425, Speaker B: Tom, what's your take on this? On this claim that Arthur's making that crypto, it's basically path independent. It's going to get to the same place either way. Government's a distraction.
00:40:02.465 - 00:40:40.091, Speaker A: I was a. It reminds me kind of your blog post Kaiseki. You know, the destination is known, but the journey is not. And I kind of agree with that to a certain extent. I think you can't really kill crypto at this point, but I do think GDP creation Value creation is a fragile thing. I don't know if you saw this report from former Italian Prime Minister, basically talking about all the different ways that EU has kind of destroyed value and killed innovation and what they can do to sort of change it. And people can say, oh, regulation in the grand scheme of things doesn't really matter.
00:40:40.091 - 00:41:11.059, Speaker A: That is kind of true. But there is a very sort of practical, potentially negative downside to having a bad regulatory environment. You can basically destroy value or stop value from being created. And so I agree with him in the sense that, yeah, this whole thing is designed as to be isolated from government. That is sort of the whole thesis, but everything else that sort of accelerates it and makes it maybe that path faster, I think the government can actually meaningfully slow it and sort of destroy value there.
00:41:11.167 - 00:41:34.251, Speaker B: Yeah, I think, yeah. The point that you just made resonates with me in that, like, it's definitely true for bitcoin, that bitcoin, like, it's there. We all know what it is. It has its role in the global kind of financial firmament at this point. And it's a little bit like, you know, when China bans bitcoin mining and, okay, there's no more mining in Sichuan and it just pops up now in, you know, Kazakhstan or in West Texas or whatever. You can't kill it. Right? It's like whack a mole.
00:41:34.251 - 00:42:06.045, Speaker B: It just pops up somewhere else. But that's not true for companies. It's not true for founders. Right. If you basically go through and do a sweep and just say, every single one of you motherfuckers is dead now and we're fining you for all the money that you're worth. It really does slow things down and make it more difficult that the marginal entrepreneur is going to be like, all right, well, I'll just go build a fintech thing or I'll just go in AI and, you know, get easy money over there. And it does feel like it's not guaranteed that we all get to the same place with respect to the total amount of new things, applications, use, cases that people end up building in crypto.
00:42:06.045 - 00:42:13.685, Speaker B: Maybe it's true that we get to the same place eventually, but it does feel like it really matters. Whether it takes like five or 10 years longer.
00:42:14.585 - 00:42:46.329, Speaker C: I mean, we don't build stronger applications, right? So if you survived because, you know, of a favorable funding environment or whatever, you built a product based on your own personal gravitas or whatnot, and then you get sliced by the regulators for whatever reason, I mean, is that really, decentralization. And what have we built? We just built another way of building centralized companies. But they've got this funny token thing that. That rides on chain. Right. I don't think that's what we're here for. We value decentralization, and projects that preach that and back it up with, you know, real vigor are the ones that are most successful.
00:42:46.329 - 00:43:03.313, Speaker C: And I'm sure in your portfolio as well, and same in mine, right? It's. But the guy who's like, yeah, I'm really good at raising money from the traditional Silicon Valley VCs. And as soon as the winds change and I went to AI, then I mean, okay, you got a zero in that, but you probably deserve to get a zero because that wasn't really about what we're trying to do here.
00:43:03.369 - 00:43:04.489, Speaker B: Right, right.
00:43:04.617 - 00:43:27.149, Speaker E: I mean, the decentralization part is a very important one, and I think that really matters. But looking at the Nakamoto coefficient at the same time, you also have to look at what are the use cases. And I think you're. I mean, not only can you not kill crypto, I think all these large companies, not all, but like, some of the large companies that have put their roots down are really starting to see things come to fruition. Right. Like, take a look at someone like BlackRock.
00:43:27.197 - 00:43:27.381, Speaker B: Right?
00:43:27.413 - 00:44:00.829, Speaker E: They have the Biddle Fund on ETH. And that is a pretty significant, you know, stake in the ground for them. And, you know, you have Larry Fink going out there talking about what crypto can do. And so not only is there products being built that add value to financial products or underlying infrastructure that reduces, you know, costs. And so they have margin improvement or potentially helps them with distribution of new financial products, helps them grow top line. That's P and L impact. And so I think a lot of these larger companies, whether it's BlackRock, whether it's PayPal, whether South Korea, Telco, all these folks are going to continue to push crypto forward because there's real business value.
00:44:00.829 - 00:44:08.349, Speaker E: And they're going to continue to push, you know, their stakeholders and constituents along the way, too. So I don't think there's. There's no way you're killing crypto at this point.
00:44:08.477 - 00:44:20.275, Speaker B: Fair enough. All right, well, we're. We're running up on time, so we're going to wrap it up. But I just want to ask real quick, anything that you want to plug, Arthur, for folks who are in Singapore or people in your portfolio that you want to shout out?
00:44:20.355 - 00:44:25.843, Speaker C: Well, I'm going to plug my party on Thursday. The location is coming out tomorrow. It's going to be fucking lit.
00:44:25.939 - 00:44:27.787, Speaker B: No Jason Derulo. No Jason Derulo.
00:44:27.851 - 00:44:28.459, Speaker C: Get ready to go.
00:44:28.507 - 00:44:32.043, Speaker B: You're excited. He's not going to be there, unfortunately. Anything you want to plug?
00:44:32.139 - 00:44:55.997, Speaker E: I was going to plug my party, but my party conflicts with Arthur's party, and I'm trying to figure out which party to go to. We have. We have our party at C. So go to Arthur's party after my party, because I think there's going to go much later, probably. But I think, you know, the only thing to plug is probably what everyone cheered about, right? Like, you got to keep building. And I think that's just, like, a really good message. And if you want to build, build on aptos, love it.
00:44:56.101 - 00:45:10.175, Speaker B: Okay, that's it from us. Thanks, everybody.
