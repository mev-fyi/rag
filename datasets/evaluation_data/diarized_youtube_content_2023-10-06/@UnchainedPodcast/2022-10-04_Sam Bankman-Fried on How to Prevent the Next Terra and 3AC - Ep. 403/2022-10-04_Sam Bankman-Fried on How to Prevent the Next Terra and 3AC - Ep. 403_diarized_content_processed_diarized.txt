00:00:00.810 - 00:00:31.670, Speaker A: Hey, y'all. For this week's show, I talked to Sam Bigman Fried, founder and CEO of FTX, who, as I'm sure you're aware, spends more time in Washington, D. C. Than most crypto entrepreneurs. He had some surprising things to say about crypto regulation. First, he's actually pretty sanguine about the prospect for regulatory clarity to come soon in the US. Second, he also said, and this was a big shocker to me that the implosions of Three Arrows Capital and Terra haven't changed the conversation about crypto very much in Washington.
00:00:31.670 - 00:01:30.234, Speaker A: Given that he's so active in talking to regulators and lawmakers, plus a huge political donor, I asked him a bit about his views on that how much of his giving is driven by his belief in effective altruism, and how much of it is driven by his interest in helping the crypto industry grow. What I enjoyed about this part of the conversation is the nuance with which Sam spoke. We also cover some of the big line top news in crypto the bear market, the merge, stablecoins, etc. And I asked him about the vision for FTX as a centralized company in a decentralized space. Just FYI, we recorded before news broke that he'd reached out to Elon Musk expressing interest in potentially buying Twitter as part of a joint effort, and before FTX had won Voyager's assets, and before it was reported that FTX was considering purchasing Celsius's assets. However, I've put links to all these developments in the show notes. This was a super fun conversation, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.

00:02:44.270 - 00:02:51.454, Speaker A: Today's guest is Sam Thankvin Fried, founder and CEO of FTX. Welcome, Sam.
00:02:51.582 - 00:02:53.060, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:02:54.070 - 00:03:22.550, Speaker A: Right now, the crypto markets are in a major slump. The total global crypto markets are only a bit above where they were at the peak of the ICO craze in January 2018, and the day that we're recording Bitcoin is where it was at that time around $19,000. And this is also true for Ethereum, which basically dropped hard after its very successful merge. So I was wondering, do you think, is this the bottom or what do you think needs to happen to turn this bear market around?
00:03:22.720 - 00:04:04.666, Speaker B: Yeah, totally. So the first thing is that it's going to be responsive to general macro environments and that's the position we're in. And the big reason really is that what we're seeing driving markets is changes in interest rates, which is leading to the strengthening and weakening of fiat currencies. And so whenever you have the dollar moving right, if the dollar strengthens, it's going to strengthen against Exxon, it's going to strengthen against Amazon and it's going to strengthen against bitcoin. And when you have it weakened, you're going to see the inverse. So because a lot of macro is being driven by moves in currencies that's going to move the sort of crypto prices against dollars. So one sort of boring answer to the question is, well, if markets go up, probably crypto will go up.
00:04:04.666 - 00:05:00.540, Speaker B: If markets go down, it'll go down. But let's maybe factor that out for a second and sort of talk about relative to whatever happens to stock markets. And from that perspective I think we've more or less stabilized. We're not seeing sort of continuous outflows, we're not seeing acute pain in the same way that we were for the week to month after sort know, Terra Luna and the Three Arrows incident. And so things are in a little bit of a holding pattern and I think the sort of thing that know, could potentially see on the horizon that would have the biggest impact would be if we saw basically regulatory regimes clarity. And particularly in the United States, regulatory regimes come out that sort of allowed the industry to operate with clarity in the country while protecting consumers. That's been sort of the biggest white whale for years and I think we might be close.
00:05:00.910 - 00:05:08.670, Speaker A: Wow, wait, for what type of legislation? Like something more sweeping or just the stablecoins aspect or what?
00:05:08.820 - 00:05:59.098, Speaker B: It's interesting, it's a lot of aspects separately, but at a similar time. And so over the last, let's say six to nine months, all of a sudden after a whole lot of dormancy, progress is starting to be made on a lot of different fronts here. And so you have staff now Bozeman, which if that fell passed, it would provide clarity for non security token, spot markets. You have pending actions from the SEC that might provide clarity around spot markets. For security tokens, you have a stablecoin bill which could provide a regulatory framework for stablecoins. You have pending registration including Arts with the CFTC for crypto futures. And so sort of simultaneously, each different piece of this is actually in line to potentially get clarity.
00:05:59.274 - 00:06:30.786, Speaker A: Okay, so I'm going to circle back to you in a little bit on policy because I have a number of questions about that. But let's keep talking about these recent months because obviously it's been a historically unprecedented time in crypto. As you mentioned, it started with the Terra luna collapse. I wanted to know what's your takeaway from that debacle? Is it that algorithmic stablecoins will never work? Or that maybe it might have if they'd gotten a bitcoin backstop in place or that the ecosystem wasn't decentralized enough or anchor had too high of a yield or something else entirely or all of it, or what, right.
00:06:30.908 - 00:07:35.098, Speaker B: There's a lot of things going on that all contributed at least a little bit to this that had impact on how much exactly there was a crash. But the way I think about it really is I divide stable points into kind of four different categories. On the one hand you have fully, 100%, totally cleanly backed stablecoins. This is like USDC, USDP tokens that are just backed one to one by the US dollar, by treasuries in a US bank account. And those, if you're seeing a crash in those currencies, something really bad has happened because those should not ever have any volatility. The second category is if you look at things which are backed by kind of like debt instruments but maybe not always exactly treasuries, right? Historically I think Tether had been in that category, although I think it's transitioning more to the first category when you see that. I sort of think of that as being, look, in volatile times, maybe it drops to $0.98
00:07:35.098 - 00:08:20.166, Speaker B: on the dollar, right? Like maybe there's some worry that 10% of its portfolio has just dropped 20% in value or something like that. So maybe it's not perfectly tied to the dollar one to one, but it's going to kind of wobble around that dollar. The first version is sort of the optimal version from many perspectives. The second version is a totally fine product. Now it should be properly disclosed. Like people should understand that there's a little bit of risk inherent in that but it's not like an inherently evil product or anything like that. Now you get to the third category and these are the sort of like traditional algorithmic stablecoins things like maker, not what maker is today, which is largely backed by USDC, but maker when it was backed entirely by ethereum, let's say.
00:08:20.166 - 00:09:07.114, Speaker B: And that is only somewhat stable. And what I mean by that basically is, well, maker was supposed to be one to one to the dollar. And the thing back in was that you could redeem it out for a dollar worth of ethereum and it was back like $1.3 of ethereum or something like that. And so in a big market crash, right, if ethereum went down 50%, right, then you could see certain extreme cases, maker ultimately being worth $0.60 on the dollar, although in theory you could be redeeming it along the way. Now it probably only would happen in extreme circumstances, but extreme times happen that is traditionally what algorithmic stablecoins are.
00:09:07.114 - 00:09:54.678, Speaker B: And again, I don't want to sort of give like a moral judgment on the product idea because it's kind of cool, but it should definitely have really fucking heavy disclaimers, right? Because we're no longer talking about a risk of a 2% depegging. We're now saying in a really extreme case, there might be a 20% depegging of it. And that's not what people are usually expecting when they see a stable coin. Right? Okay. So that's sort of like traditional stablecoins. And then you get to Luna and Luna is actually a bridge further if you look at what Luna actually is. It is well, okay, so you start out with a bunch of Luna Tokens USD, which are paid in theory, 120 to the dollar.
00:09:54.678 - 00:10:24.610, Speaker B: And a common misconception is that they're backed by Terra Tokens, which would be sort of the maker model. They're actually not backed by Terra tokens. Exactly. They're backed by the ability to mint new Terra Tokens. Right? If you were to redeem out Luna, what would happen is the treasurers would go mint a bunch of Terra and give it to you and this is even less stable. Right? Because the problem with this is that it's not like there's sort of like a going market well, there was a going market price for Terra Tokens. Right, but that was with the old supply of Terra, right.
00:10:24.610 - 00:11:26.962, Speaker B: When you redeem it, that old supply is not the new supply. All of a sudden you're introducing new Terra and in fact, in sort of a death spiral, right? You're hyperinflating Terra because as Terra falls, you need to mint more and more Terra Tokens every time that you want to be redeeming Luna and people are going to be redeeming more and more Luna, that's a death spiral. And that's what can happen when you're dealing with something like Terra in particular. And in fact, that is exactly what happened with Terra and Luna on the time it crashed. And so that is, again, it's even less stable than a traditional algorithmic stablecoin is. And again, without necessarily making a moral judgment on whether such a thing ought to have a right to exist, to say that it's volatile is an understatement. That is the kind of thing that might go to zero, to actual literal zero, not just down 20% or something like that in a crash.
00:11:26.962 - 00:12:07.186, Speaker B: And, and that is in fact what happened. And so at the very least, such a thing should be sort of backed by a really extreme number of disclaimers, shall we say. And you really have to be holding yourself to a high standard to think that that's the kind of thing that customers should understand. So, okay, as a backdrop, Luna was always at risk of hyperinflation and that's what happened and it's not what people were expecting. So you can say, well, was the yield too high on anchor? Yeah, it was. That was definitely a problem that was not a good part of this story. Right.
00:12:07.186 - 00:12:16.470, Speaker B: It exacerbated things. There was already a problem. There's always a potential problem there. But that did make it worse. Each one of these things does make it worse.
00:12:16.810 - 00:12:27.834, Speaker A: Yeah, but do you think that type of algorithmic stablecoin could ever work? Or do you think that pretty much they're always going to end up with this downward spiral effect that depends on could work?
00:12:27.872 - 00:13:06.562, Speaker B: I mean, it was kind of a cool thing, right? It was like a cool concept, but it's super fucking risky. And I think it's always going to be super risky, right. You're not going to escape that part of it. And so I think I just wouldn't even think of it as a stable coin. I don't know whether it's the kind of thing that if you wanted it to exist, it would have to exist in such a way that was not really being branded as a stable coin. It was being branded as an algorithmic, weird kind of thing in Jigger that was not all that stable, and it should be thought of as an investment, not as a store of wealth that is kind of safe.
00:13:06.706 - 00:13:50.726, Speaker A: I like that weird kind of thing. In majigger, we'll add that to the crypto dictionaries. So, as you mentioned, Three Arrows Capital also was a huge story these past few months, and a lot of people were shocked, of course, to find out how much the firm had borrowed. And then, interestingly, after the meltdown, there were a number of people that came out of the woodwork and said they'd seen red flags with three AC, but they hadn't spoken up. One person noted that they had seen three AC try to sell an equity investment by wildly inflating the valuation to prospective buyers. Someone else saw, hey, this is a multibillion dollar fund. Why are they taking on a small investor of $20 million? It doesn't seem worth the hassle for a firm of that size.
00:13:50.726 - 00:14:10.060, Speaker A: I did also see you told New York Magazine that you now suspect the firm even tried to pledge the same piece of collateral for multiple firms. So what do you think the industry could do going forward so that people either feel more comfortable speaking up about red flags or just to prevent this type of insane sort of borrowing happening again?
00:14:10.670 - 00:15:03.038, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a really good question. And one more thing that I'll add to this is if you look at Voyager, which ended up going through bankruptcy right now, right? It's going through bankruptcy because of unpaid debt from 3 Hours Capital. But if you look at when it took that debt on, when 3 Hours took that debt on, it was, like, three weeks before its collapse. So this is not like a very long running engagement. This is like yet another thing that happened right before, at the end. Probably not as a coincidence. These are reminiscent, to some extent, of some of what you saw in 2008, where you basically have nontransparent systems and you have people who are putting on an amount of leverage that was not well understood and ultimately it came back to bite them.
00:15:03.038 - 00:16:08.274, Speaker B: I think what I would say here is, first of all, one of the reasons that crypto wasn't hit harder through all of this that it didn't get even worse, is that despite all of these problems that were introduced by three arrows, when you looked at some of the core infrastructure in the space, it was actually uniquely resilient to this. Right. Like on chain protocols don't have this sort of problem because there's transparency about the borrowing and lending. So that's one part of an answer here, which is like, crypto was sort of built in some ways to solve this, and in some ways it was the parts of the ecosystem which were least crypto like, which came back to bite people here. That's only a partial answer, but that is a piece of it. Having more transparency around borrowers and loans can be a piece of the answer here. Having people better understand the risks that they're taking when they put capital in something like a Voyager, and I think Voyager is sort of a clean example of this, where more or less they did exactly what they said they'd do.
00:16:08.274 - 00:16:48.042, Speaker B: Like the core thing here is not that they were recklessly gambling customer assets in a way no one anticipated they might even consider doing, but that there was quite a bit more of a risk to that semi expected behavior than I think their customers understood. And so I think that having disclosures, having transparency there, having more diligence on the places that are being lent to in this space, I think all of those would help. None of those are perfect. There should be a big distinction made between that and E two staking, which is a really different type of thing that one could be doing to get yield.
00:16:48.186 - 00:17:01.234, Speaker A: Yeah. So at this time, it looks like Blockfly may be acquired by FTX. This is going to happen at a pittance compared to its previous valuation. But now that FTX will be running a crypto lender, how do you plan.
00:17:01.272 - 00:17:46.142, Speaker B: To manage, you know, without explicitly commenting, know whether that acquisition would know what I'll say, know? We're working closely with the BlockFi team on figuring out what is an appropriate way to understand and measure and manage risk here. And I think there are a lot of things that you can do that help quite a bit. And I think that one piece of this is understanding the nature of the counterparties. Another is distributing the risk between many of them. A big piece of this is taking actual collateral and being careful about what that means. Right. One thing that was sort of odd that came up in this whole process around taking collateral is a lot of people thought that they had taken collateral from three arrows.
00:17:46.142 - 00:18:23.360, Speaker B: Some of those had actually taken collateral, others of those, although they believed that they had in fact, they had taken the same GBTC as collateral that six other people had taken. And it was not really meaningfully their GBTC in any. So that's another piece of this having policies in place that's sort of like a sort of bland way of saying it, but being ready to actually margin call people in a hurry if that's what's necessary. I think all of those are pieces to managing it in a more sustainable way.
00:18:24.370 - 00:18:44.340, Speaker A: So as you just mentioned, we kind of veered in this direction about how you think a lot about policy. You spent a lot of time in Washington and I wondered what effect you've seen these crypto collapses have on the opinion that lawmakers and regulators have of crypto or how it's affected your conversations with them.
00:18:44.710 - 00:19:33.182, Speaker B: Yeah, so it's had surprisingly little impact on the conversations. And the reason for that that was not at all inevitable. The reason for that is prior to this happening, the conversations that we're having in DC. Were already centered around how can we bring regulatory oversight to the space. That was already the focus. And when that's the focus, well, what's the right response to seeing these happen? The right response is getting more regulatory oversight in the so I think that to a decent know as a space, we're actually already working on the important things in DC. And I think that's something know lawmakers are well aware.
00:19:33.182 - 00:20:05.200, Speaker B: You know, at the end of the day, I think the biggest response that we've gotten from people know, roughly speaking, like, yeah, this probably just makes it, if anything, more urgent that we get some regulatory regime out for crypto in the United States. And I think it's added more impetus to the calls for regulatory oversight and clarity from federal regulators in a way that there had not been as much of before. Which is all just to say that's had surprisingly little impact, just given the nature of what conversations were going in.
00:20:05.730 - 00:20:26.094, Speaker A: And earlier when you were talking about how the parts of the crypto universe that got wiped out were the ones that look the least crypto like, meaning they're more centralized, they look more like the traditional financial institutions that went down during the GFC. Are you seeing that regulators understand that distinction as well, or not? Or in lawmakers?
00:20:26.222 - 00:20:46.518, Speaker B: I would say some do. I definitely wouldn't say that none of them do. But I also think that I wouldn't say that this is commonly understood. I think it's the kind of thing that those who are particularly plugged into the crypto ecosystem in the policy space do and those who are less plugged in don't. So I would say a fraction, but not a trivial fraction.
00:20:46.694 - 00:21:12.914, Speaker A: So you also have this proposal up with the CFTC about changing the way that derivatives are traded. Are you also talking with regulators about other hot button policy topics that the crypto community is focused on, such as the tornado cash sanctions, privacy, or how the SEC and CFTC divide up regulating crypto, or reporting requirements around self custody et. What else, what else are you talking about with them?
00:21:12.952 - 00:21:44.794, Speaker B: Yeah, we're talking about a bunch of things, and to some extent this is when you give someone your number, you should expect to get called. And we do, and we're comfortable with that. But yeah, we're having a lot of conversations with lawmakers, a lot of them are constructive. And the core of it is basically like, we want to be helpful any way we can here. And there are a bunch of places where lawmakers have pretty reasonable questions about how to think about the crypto ecosystem. And so we've been talking with them through all of those. And yeah, I think it's been super constructive.
00:21:44.794 - 00:22:16.370, Speaker B: I think it's been helpful that we've been doing it. I think that more than anything else, it really is the case that what lawmakers really want here is straightforward, constructive engagement. They want to make sure that they're well informed, they want to make sure they're having the important conversations, that they don't mess this up, that they sort of make intelligent decisions. And so that's been sort of the core of how we've been thinking about this, which is anything in crypto that we have sort of information on, we're happy to engage on with lawmakers.
00:22:16.530 - 00:22:23.914, Speaker A: And amongst those topics that I listed or any others, would you say that certain of them are more prioritized by your team than others?
00:22:24.032 - 00:23:04.498, Speaker B: So I think the biggest, a lot of this is looking like what are the priorities in general in DC and for the industry and for consumers? And I think we think the biggest things there are, stablecoin regulation is a big one, basically stablecoin regulation, marketplace regulation, and token registration I think are sort of like the three big pillars of this. And so stablecoin regulation is talking with the lawmakers the most and to some extent with the regulators, with the markets piece, it's a combination of the regulators who might regulate them and lawmakers looking at passing legislation to enshrine that. And with token registration it's been primarily with the regulators.
00:23:04.674 - 00:23:23.054, Speaker A: So as I mentioned, you have this proposal to change the way derivatives are cleared and you would like to do so using FTX's technology. And of course this setup would eliminate the role of several existing TradFi intermediaries. I was wondering, do you have an expectation of when you'll get an update on that?
00:23:23.252 - 00:24:00.860, Speaker B: So we don't know. At the end of the day we'll see when the regulators have updates for us on various parts, but I can say I think we're optimistic about it. I think it's been a long, very thorough process. We've submitted thousands of documents. It has been much more intense grilling than I think any other regulator we've seen has put people through. And the CFTC is certainly one of the hardest and most thorough regulators in the financial ecosystem. They're not an easy regulator, but they're a very knowledgeable one.
00:24:00.860 - 00:24:19.120, Speaker B: We appreciate sort of what they've been doing. So optimistically, I think that we've done a lot of what we need to do here and sort of are in the final stretch here of working through any last details with regulators and making sure everyone's on the same page. But we'll have to see.
00:24:19.650 - 00:25:05.200, Speaker A: Earlier this year, during a discussion at the CFTC about this proposal, I noticed that you mentioned that some of the other invited experts were purporting to protect investors, that actually the traders knew more than they did. And what I found interesting is, on the other hand, that sort of kind of has this maybe sort of libertarian feel to it. On the other hand, you are a huge political donor and the vast majority of your money tends to go to Democratic candidates. And as I'm sure you're aware, the Democratic Party tends to be the party that is more likely to support the need to protect consumers via financial regulation. So I was wondering what's your overall philosophy on financial regulation? Is it something that neatly fits into one of these categories or something totally different.
00:25:05.570 - 00:26:02.000, Speaker B: There's a lot going on there and there are a lot of interesting tangents there. In general, very few of my policies sort of very neatly fit into buckets. And this is included. I think what I would say the core way that I think about it is the following. I think people get distracted talking about more regulation versus less regulation. And I think that that's just not the most important axis. At the end of the day, I think the most important axis here is, is the regulation fit for purpose? Does the regulation successfully narrow in on the parts that are most important to have oversight with? And if it does, then the more the merrier, right? To the extent that it's addressing really big existing concerns that are potentially causing real problems if they go on addressed, then I'm all for having a really robust system there.
00:26:02.000 - 00:27:00.082, Speaker B: And if it's not, if it's focusing on dumb things that don't matter, then in some sense the less the better, but more meaningfully. You got to redirect it to be better protected. And the big things here is, is it protecting customers? Is it actually protecting customers, right? Is it focusing on the things where the biggest risk exists? And is it doing that in a way which will help mitigate that risk? And that's sort of the core of how I think about it. And I do really think that a lot of these debates just miss that, right? Like when people are debating an agency versus another agency or philosophically what the right approach is for getting crypto. I sort of feel like a lot of those conversations are just like, come on, guys, can we focus on looking at reserves of stable coins on that part? Yeah, be really thorough. I want regulators to be able to dive really deep into the number of dollars and or treasuries in the bank account of a stablecoin issuer. Right.
00:27:00.082 - 00:27:41.520, Speaker B: Like sort of like as much transparency as possible. Right. Like they want to enforce minute to minute transparency published in real time by the stablecoin issuers with hefty fines if they materially, misstate things and don't promptly correct it, and very hefty action if it drops below the number of tokens issued. Yeah, absolutely right. That means something wrong has happened with the stablecoin. And the more we can do to prevent and to alert around that, the better. If you look at having real disclosures around how a product that someone is trading works yeah, I think the more transparency you can get there, the better.
00:27:41.520 - 00:28:30.462, Speaker B: Totally in favor of that. And on the other hand, I think when you're saying, what if we introduce three more intermediaries? I'm kind of like, okay, you could regulatorily mandate that. I agree it would be strict in that it would make it harder to operate in this space. But is that protecting customers? Is there a way in which what's theory for how that makes the world better than the world before then? And sometimes there's an answer, right? Sometimes you have a specific answer like this is why these are necessary players that have to be separated out, but it should be motivated by that theory. It's not like all things that are awkward for operators in the industry also protect customers. There are things that are just bad and similarly there are things that are just good that protect customers and make it easier to operate. That is really at the core what my belief is.
00:28:30.596 - 00:28:50.818, Speaker A: You've said you want to turn FTX into a sort of financial supermarket and the potential BlockFi and Voyager well, BlockFi acquisition could help you do that. However, a financial supermarket sounds centralized and I was wondering why that was the vision when in crypto, the end game is generally decentralization.
00:28:50.994 - 00:29:19.502, Speaker B: It's a good question. And to that point, at the end of the day, FTX is a centralized company like it is. And we're not trying to pretend to be a decentralized voice. We're not. We have a board of directors, we have job titles, we have corporate entities, we're a company. And the product we're building is on AWS. It is a centralized product, but it's in a decentralized space.
00:29:19.502 - 00:30:47.100, Speaker B: And the way that I think about that and the way that I think about that interfacing is basically that well, you have it's sort of a hub and spokes model where a lot of things are more efficient if done in a centralized entity. I mean, one good kind of clean example of this is Netflix, right? If you want to deliver I don't even know how many bytes. A day of video content to people you can't fit that all on a blockchain, okay? That is what it so you know, the HFT firms are going to want to trade on exchanges that are probably going to require more throughput than blockchains will be easily able to handle. Okay? That is what it is. But while doing that and acting again in a centralized company, in a centralized way, we are hooked up via decentralized rails to the rest of the ecosystem, right? And so if you want to send your assets from FTX to anywhere else, you can do it 24/7 instantly by clicking a button. And that's how we are a part of the crypto ecosystem and that is something which I think is really important and is basically what makes us a part of a decentralized ecosystem. It's the fact that we integrate with blockchain rails and that we integrate with all the other centralized and decentralized players in this space that way.
00:30:47.100 - 00:31:09.620, Speaker B: And I think that's sort of like in general the model that I feel most compelled by, which is some things will be directly on Chain, directly decentralized, other things will be centralized entities done for computational reasons in a centralized way but then right out to blockchains that interface with them. That's how I see us.
00:31:10.950 - 00:32:24.794, Speaker A: In a moment we're going to talk a little bit more about the direction FTX is going and some of the policy directions. Also the country could move.

Back to my conversation with Sam. As I'm sure you're aware, crypto entrepreneurs in the US. Have been making noise for years that the US regulatory environment is inhospitable to them. You are one of the top US.
00:33:33.902 - 00:33:48.530, Speaker A: Business people in a generation. Your rise has been meteoric extremely fast, and yet your firms have operated out of Hong Kong, now the Bahamas, and at the same time you're often on Capitol Hill. What would it take for you to move back to the US?
00:33:48.680 - 00:34:43.078, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a good, you know, look, we're always going to have to have operations in a lot of countries, right? Like, we service Japanese clients and we do that through a regulated Japanese entity. And so the boring answer to your question is, well, we'll always have some US operations and some non US operations, whatever. Let's put that aside and give the real, right. And the way that I see the real answer here is, okay, but what would it take for us to be able to offer, effectively something like our full product in the United States, something that we felt good about, and to be able to do that in a way where we were able to operate with the US. As not just a us. Headquarters but as a global headquarters? Right. And morally speaking, what would it take for us to effectively have the company basically be us instead of basically be foreign? And to that point, I think there's sort of one big thing for us, and again, it's different for different people, right.
00:34:43.078 - 00:35:25.074, Speaker B: When you're looking at stablecoin issuers, obviously the big thing that they're looking at is stablecoin regulation and build. For us, the biggest thing is the markets piece, right? The most important thing for us is we operate a marketplace that's at their core product. It's an exchange, the clearing house, the matching engine. It's also a front end. And so the biggest thing is, well, for both spot and futures, ideally for things that both are and are not securities, we want to be able to offer those from our US. Entity to Americans. And if we can do that, I think that unlocks, frankly, most of what's remaining here.
00:35:25.074 - 00:36:16.420, Speaker B: And so that is just the core of the answer. It's like clear answers to how do we operate the futures and spot security and not security token exchange in the United States that's the thing we've been pushing on the hardest. And that's the thing where I won't say every country has given clarity on that because they haven't a number of countries. It's extremely unclear how one would do that. That being said, even in countries where it's not clear how one would offer those products, there is often an interim answer. There's often a sense of like, okay, there's going to be a forthcoming regime. It's not clear exactly what that regime will be, but while waiting for that, this is what you can do as a company to effectively offer the products.
00:36:16.420 - 00:37:09.458, Speaker B: There's not that sense in the United States. We don't have that sense of this is how we operate for now. And so that is to some extent, the big thing that I guess has been missing here is a sense of either as a permanent matter or even just as a temporary matter pending further licensure opportunities, what is the way that one operates these venues. But we're doing what we can here, right? Like, we have a pending application with the CFTC or I guess an amendment to our existing application to offer crypto futures. We're working with the SEC on security tokens. We're working with Congress on getting legislation for spot market oversight. And I really do think a lot of progress is being made on all of these fronts.
00:37:09.634 - 00:37:17.158, Speaker A: Wow. So it sounds like your roadmap is you're kind of working on multiple areas of the roadmap all at once.
00:37:17.244 - 00:37:19.340, Speaker B: Yes, that's certainly true.
00:37:19.710 - 00:37:25.740, Speaker A: Okay, so it seems like if you're successful, then you're saying that you might just move back here.
00:37:27.630 - 00:37:44.206, Speaker B: It's on the table. It's something that we have conversations periodically about what it would mean, what it would take, and every time we have the conversations, they seem like a little bit less fanciful and a little bit more like the pieces that would have to be in place to make that happen. Many of them are coming in place.
00:37:44.388 - 00:38:04.246, Speaker A: I wanted to ask you one more kind of political question, which is I'm sure you're aware that the loudest critics of crypto in Congress have tended to be Democrats, and yet that's the party that you've mostly supported with your political donations. Why do you think it is that you seem aligned politically with them but then disagree on crypto with them?
00:38:04.348 - 00:38:39.646, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a good question. The first thing I'll say I have given to both sides, and at the end of the day, it's policy, not politics, that I care about. And I'm totally happy to support whatever side and whatever people and politicians are supporting good policy that could go either. Right. Anyway, that's a boring answer to your question, but I do think that's worth noting that I don't see myself as having been born with a big D on my chest or something like that. Right. This is just a question of wanting to support good lawmakers and that can cut across the aisle.
00:38:39.646 - 00:39:30.238, Speaker B: But the other thing that I would say is that there are a lot of issues I agree with different people on different issues. I think that one of the issues I care about the most is pandemic preparedness. That's actually something which has cut across the aisle to some extent, but I think that no one issue is going to give a really clear readout as to where my overall politics lies. That's another piece of this. And then last thing that I would say there is I think that crypto has been somewhat surprisingly to me a somewhat bipartisan issue. It's been an issue where both sides I think have had constructive things to say. I think both sides are looking for ways to bring the industry onshore and to provide customer oversight.
00:39:30.238 - 00:40:09.600, Speaker B: Obviously there are some differences in execution and in the exact vision that people have for it, which is what it is and there are certainly some people who I disagree moderately strongly with on the right way to do this. But that's how politics is. You agree on some things, you disagree on others, you learn to live with it. And I think in this case there are going to be places where know disagree with a few members of both parties, certainly with the Democratic Party on crypto but I actually agree with how a number of the members are seeing you know, hopefully we can have a constructive debate about it.
00:40:09.970 - 00:40:55.018, Speaker A: I was also curious about those political donations. Obviously it's kind of well known that your motivation for the wealth that you've built and your career is to eventually give the vast majority of it away. You're an effective altruist and you are very interested in where each dollar will kind of have the greatest impact for the betterment of humanity. It's a very kind of rational way of looking at this. And so I was wondering, when you make those political donations and you mentioned you were looking for people who have good positions on policy, are you looking to support politicians with that rational lens or are you looking to support politicians who you think are supportive of crypto in ways that you think will be good for the industry?
00:40:55.194 - 00:42:07.160, Speaker B: So the biggest thing is just looking for politicians who are in general doing good policy work. Some of this could be on crypto but most of it is not. Most of what I'm looking at is more generally like how are they viewing the most important issues before us? I think the basic answer to your question is that it's not a crypto specific thing and it is a much more general one and it's one where I think that how they respond to pandemics, how they look at future technologies, how they try to have sort of rational economic policy. Those are all sort of among the most important things for me. I think at the end of the day there may come a point at which there exists a single issue which is so important that no other issues really matter. I don't think we are at that point. I think we're at a point where it is a much broader swath of things that matter and where I try and take a somewhat holistic view of how a policymaker approaches what policy they ultimately support and ultimately actually really fight.
00:42:08.090 - 00:42:17.318, Speaker A: Know, I have to say it sort of reminds me of the kind of Michael Bloomberg technocratic view. Am I getting that right?
00:42:17.404 - 00:42:36.206, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's pretty fair. I think that obviously he's had different views at different points in his life too, so won't hold off on being too dogmatic about exactly where he has been at various points. But yeah, I think it has a lot in common with how he has sort of often viewed these things.
00:42:36.388 - 00:42:57.138, Speaker A: So, in addition to your main crypto businesses and also working on this proposal with the CFTC, you in addition have a 7.6% stake in Robinhood. You've also invested in IEX, and I was curious to hear how you thought the crypto and TradFi markets will either evolve toward or away from each other and what role FTX will play in all that.
00:42:57.224 - 00:43:39.650, Speaker B: Totally. Obviously, I don't know for sure, we'll see what happens, but my guess is that they will evolve towards each other. That would definitely be my guess here. And I think the core reason is that when you look at where some of the first real applications of blockchain are, frankly, I think that some of the most compelling applications of blockchain are in market structure. And what I mean by that is, if you look at what happened to mobile brokers on the day that meme stocks went wild, right. What sort of thing is obvious is something bad happened, right. Somehow that didn't end the way people thought it was going to end.
00:43:39.650 - 00:44:22.800, Speaker B: Lots of retail got basically liquidated, which is actually fucking weird, because they didn't have leverage on. Right. Somehow, despite having unlevered positions, their positions were in some cases closed, and at the very least, they're not able to add to them. They're often locked out of the app. What happened there? Why did markets break down so much? Well, at the end of the day, I think there is basically, as it turns out, a limit to the amount of money that retail is allowed to make with current market structure. And what do I mean by that? Well, eventually retail bought a lot of AMC, a lot of GameStop. Eventually they'd made $10 billion in a one day period mark to market.
00:44:22.800 - 00:45:00.358, Speaker B: It takes two days to settle any equities transaction in the United States. So they're sitting there having, quote unquote, made this money, but going to be two days until that money is actually delivered to them. And in the meantime, they're sitting, uh, with marked market gains. Well, what happens know, a day and a half later, the other side comes and says, ha ha, just kidding, I don't have any AMC. I know I said I sold you some AMC. Like, interesting, you bought that choke. I never did have any.
00:45:00.358 - 00:45:55.118, Speaker B: Right. What happens then? Well, it's a mess, is part of the answer to that question. What happens then is, well, either retail didn't actually make the money they thought they'd made there, right. Either it's all kind of an illusion because the trades just get canceled. Or if that's not what happened, then I guess that somehow, someone else has got to fund that, right? Someone else has got to pay retail the $10 billion they think they made. So what you have is this world where every single broker, every intermediary separately has to be sitting there with like billions of dollars in regulatory capital in case there's a failure to deliver. And we're just talking about the stock side here.
00:45:55.118 - 00:46:42.666, Speaker B: In fact, it's even worse if you look at the cash side where it takes a month, realistically speaking, for cash to definitely settle. Okay, so you're sort of like starting from that position. Well then what happens when markets get volatile? The answer is like, the risk just overwhelms the system. How do you fix that? You fix that with clean, clear, unambiguous settlements that's fast and cheap. And that's what blockchain does. That's like its core, most obvious use case. And so one of the first things that I think blockchain may really help quite a bit is settlement, is financial settlement.
00:46:42.666 - 00:47:27.450, Speaker B: And excited to see that happen in traditional finance. And I think that we're going to start to see bleed over from that, if nothing else, in the not too distant future. And outside of that, I think there's a lot else that can happen here and I think we're just going to see this sort of intersection increase and increase and increase over time. But, yeah, I think we're going to see things bleeding together. And that's obviously one of the reasons that we've been doing what we can to build out our TradFi presence, because we think we have something to offer there using crypto rails, and we think it's also an area that obviously there's a lot of customer demand for.
00:47:27.600 - 00:48:03.138, Speaker A: It's so funny to hear you talk about this because the way I got into covering all of this was in 2015. That was the era of blockchain, not bitcoin. And I think it was my very first big article on all this and it was about how Wall Street was going to use this technology. And then all these years on it, it felt like I was wrong. And yet here you are again talking about this as the future dream. I wanted to ask you about an article that Bloomberg published a few weeks ago. A number of people in crypto have expressed concerns about the fact that you both own a major exchange and that you own almost all of Alameda, which is one of the largest market makers.
00:48:03.138 - 00:48:13.978, Speaker A: Although the article did point out there is no evidence of any preferential treatment. Obviously, this is something that a number of people in the crypto industry have observed. And I was wondering what your response is to them.
00:48:14.064 - 00:48:51.398, Speaker B: Yeah, so first of all, I think it's a totally reasonable thing to bring up and a totally reasonable thing to have some concern over at its core. It is really important that marketplaces act in a responsible manner here and that they act in an agnostic manner. And I think that there have to be controls in place, there has to be oversight of that what it says. We do have those controls, we do have that oversight and we're regulated in a large number of jurisdictions. This isn't news to regulators. It's not like they sort of read that and be like, oh shit, we forgot about that. We have a lot of policies in place for this.
00:48:51.398 - 00:49:46.498, Speaker B: We've gone over this with a number of regulators. And at its core, in line with the statement about it's also mostly theoretical, there aren't sort of like specific instances. I think one of the core things we value the most is that our marketplace is totally agnostic. And what I mean by that, by agnostic here, is that we don't care who sends an order, right? Well, sorry, they have to be KYC'd on the exchange. We care about that part. Right? But from like a matching engine priority perspective, from a latency perspective, the way we think about it is our job as an exchange is to facilitate orders hitting the exchange and to make sure that that happens in exactly the way that we say that'll happen, which is, say Bob has an order to send. Great, Bob can send the order straight to the venue and if anyone else has an order, they'll send it straight to venue.
00:49:46.498 - 00:50:18.180, Speaker B: Right? Everyone's going straight to the exchange here. We don't have sort of preferential treatment on that. And then it's just standard order book. We've matched the best buyer against the best seller and that does make it quite a bit easier that we don't have. Okay? But we try and match it against a core market maker if we can. And then it's like this group of people, we give them the access without the extra bullshit as much as we can, just clarify everything and make it just standard access. That makes it a lot cleaner to make sure that we don't have conflict of interest breaches here.
00:50:18.180 - 00:50:36.920, Speaker B: And then the last thing that I'll say is just that I don't actually work on Alameda anymore. I haven't for years and I don't trade for it. And I'm not involved in day to day management there either.
00:50:38.010 - 00:50:59.418, Speaker A: The Virian merge recently went off without a hitch, and yet obviously the price tanked, probably for other reasons, and the merge only slightly reduced. The problem with scalability solana, obviously, is a blockchain that you've been a big proponent of and it is one that is highly scalable. How do you think the merge affects Ethereum prospects?
00:50:59.594 - 00:51:19.074, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think it's an amazing technical feat. It's super exciting that it happened and it happened pretty cleanly, all things considered, which is also sort of impressive and really well done by the Ethereum community. I think it helped some. Right. As you said, it still isn't the fastest blockchain post merge, but it's a lot faster. Right. And it was kind of out of headroom before this.
00:51:19.074 - 00:52:00.318, Speaker B: Right. It was at a point where it just could not support the current level of DeFi activity. Now it can, and I don't think that it has six orders of magnitudes left on top of being able to sell to support current DeFi activity. Right. I think it has, like, I don't know, a quarter of an order of magnitude left or something like that, but it's still a big improvement overall. I'm super excited about it, although I will say, sort of in line with what you're saying, that I think this is anticipated, I don't think it changes the core narrative, which is that there are advantages and disadvantages to different blockchains. Ethereum's stick is not that it's the fastest blockchain, it's not that it's the most efficient blockchain.
00:52:00.318 - 00:52:29.610, Speaker B: It's meant to be a high trust, high sort of track record blockchain and now hopefully can be that plus a moderate throughput instead of a low throughput blockchain. It also obviously gets rid of almost the entire carbon footprint of Ethereum, which is quite valuable because Ethereum was a pretty significant carbon footprint before this, just given the level of demand on the network from DeFi.
00:52:30.430 - 00:52:44.478, Speaker A: So east now is likely going to be deflationary and at least the Issuance has been drastically reduced and in comparison to bitcoin, obviously, on those scores, it's improved. So I was wondering what you thought this did for bitcoin's narrative.
00:52:44.654 - 00:53:14.506, Speaker B: Yeah, bitcoin is what it is. Right. It's digital gold at this point. It's not the blockchain that you would use for high speed, low cost payments, although you could still use lightning or L2 or a wrapper on bitcoin to do it. But it is the most trusted, the most institutional and token that sort of hasn't changed. It is technically inflationary, but is very slightly inflationary. Right.
00:53:14.506 - 00:53:23.934, Speaker B: Like a thing worth noting is that the total amount of inflation ever is capped and it's capped at like 10%. Right. How many bitcoins have been mined so far? Is it like 19 million?
00:53:24.052 - 00:53:26.414, Speaker A: Yes. Something, I'm not sure, but something like.
00:53:26.532 - 00:54:13.840, Speaker B: And there's what, 21 million? There's only 10% more inflation over the entire rest of history combined. I mean, in this environment, that's about annual inflation for a lot of fiat currencies, so it's basically not inflationary on a longer timescale. And yeah, I think it's going to continue to play that role and it's a pretty different role than the kind of core high trust smart contract blockchain or than the high throughput smart contract blockchain does. I think the merge doesn't change that ton. If anything, it differentiates bitcoin a little bit more because Ethereum is not proof of work anymore. So bitcoin is sort of the only remaining really major top coin that is proof of work.
00:54:14.370 - 00:54:21.946, Speaker A: Okay, so you don't feel that Ethereum's more reduced inflation does anything to change bitcoin's place of digital gold?
00:54:22.058 - 00:54:23.600, Speaker B: I don't think so, no.
00:54:24.130 - 00:54:45.842, Speaker A: Okay, so as we mentioned earlier in the show, there's this kind of wild macro environment. Right now on the day that we're recording, the British pound has dropped to a record low. There's a lot of talk about recession and I wondered what you thought might happen on a macro level for the next year and what approach you planned to take with FTX during this period.
00:54:45.986 - 00:55:11.840, Speaker B: Yeah, so at its core, I mean, FTX obviously we're incredibly exposed to the crypto industry. It's what we are. I'm fine with that. It would be weird not to be, given the business that we're in. We do keep our reserves in cash. One of the sort of dumb answers here, again, I don't want to put too much in front of this answer is not really addressing the question is whatever happens, happens. Right.
00:55:11.840 - 00:55:40.566, Speaker B: But I think the real answer to the question is we want to be in a position where we can offer products that people want, whatever those are. Right. And so one piece of that is obviously we've branched out into equities internationally. We have tokenized equities in the United States. We have a broker dealer and clearing firm and are offering equities through that to Americans. We would love to have better FX support. We are working on that.
00:55:40.566 - 00:55:57.790, Speaker B: We already have pretty good FX support in a lot of places. But that's obviously something that is going to be in demand given what you're talking about. And so I think the core thing that I think about above everything else is being positioned to offer the products that people are going to want given a highly volatile and uncertain macro environment.
00:55:59.010 - 00:56:06.306, Speaker A: And it's recently been reported that FTX is raising funds for more deal making. So what types of acquisitions would you like to make?
00:56:06.488 - 00:57:06.674, Speaker B: Yeah, I think what I'd say without explicitly confirming or denying that, is that what are the things that would make the most sense for us as a company? Well, one thing that would make a lot of sense would be when you look at sort of the regulatory space, we've done a number of acquisitions that have been aimed at companies that have really impressive regulatory sort of know how, knowledge standing relationships. Licensure, obviously LedgerX is a big example of that. Now, FTX derivatives, but there are a number more as well. So that's one piece of this, a second piece of this. But frankly, that while has historically been a big piece, I'm not sure it will be as big of a piece going forward just because we've already done a lot of the acquisitions we want to do on that space. I think that acquiring great teams is always a thing we're excited about. Right.
00:57:06.674 - 00:58:02.582, Speaker B: I think with Storybook, for all that was a part of the story, and then the last thing, and maybe the biggest is looking at businesses that have really great user bases where we can potentially help round out the product suite or the licensing suite for them. And so that's going to be something we're going to have our eye on both in the United States and abroad. There are a number of companies that we have been in talks with at some point or that we have analyzed. And I think the big thing from our perspective is thinking about what would actually be a positive sum pairing, what would be a place where we think that sort of would be worth more together than apart and that it sort of makes sense to join forces. And so we have been digging around at a number of those. We will always be, but this is certainly a time that we are paying particular attention to that.
00:58:02.716 - 00:58:31.040, Speaker A: So as you've mentioned in the show, the guiding principle behind all the work that you do is to just make as much money as possible in order to give as much as possible away so that I'll have the greatest impact in the world. However, I'm sure you're very well aware that there's a number of critics of crypto who say that they believe it's a net negative for various reasons. And I was wondering kind of what your thoughts were on that and whether you thought there was any kind of conflict in the way you were making the money and your ultimate goal or not.
00:58:31.490 - 00:59:14.326, Speaker B: So ultimately I would not want to be doing something I thought was strongly destructive with my day job and I don't think I am. Look, there are good parts of crypto, there are bad parts of crypto that's true of everything that there are good and bad parts. Maybe it's a little bit more true, frankly, in both directions because of the newness of the field, the dynamicness of it. It means that you get a lot of really exciting new innovation. It means you get a lot of bullshit. Those come hand in hand and hopefully we can move more in one direction rather than the other. But at its core, I think that crypto and blockchain have the potential to make settlement a lot cleaner for people both domestically and internationally.
00:59:14.326 - 00:59:51.160, Speaker B: I think it has the potential to help empower a lot of people economically, to give them real financial access. Like one of our fastest growing jurisdictions this year has been Ukraine because there's a place where people are really desperate for global financial access and we're excited to help provide that.
