00:00:00.330 - 00:00:39.030, Speaker A: Hey, all. Before we begin, a couple quick announcements. First, I'm doing an end of year show with crypto predictions for 2022 by you. Please make a video or an audio recording of your 2022 crypto prediction or predictions and email it to hello@unchainedpodcast.com with the subject line Crypto Prediction by the end of day, Tuesday, December 28. And although I have asked people to send their name and where they're from, as somebody pointed out to me on Twitter, if you don't want to DOX yourself, I guess you don't have to do that either. Unfortunately, I do need to give a forewarning that if you excessively promote anything, we will not include your prediction.
00:00:39.030 - 00:01:03.630, Speaker A: If you just want me to read on air a prediction that you just email, that's okay too. It's just a little bit less fun. Don't forget, the deadline is Tuesday, December 20, eigth. And the email address is hello@unchainedpodcast.com. Please put crypto prediction in the subject line. Also, a reminder, my book is coming out on 222 22. If you're looking for a holiday gift, preorder it now to deliver later.
00:01:03.630 - 00:01:53.540, Speaker A: Preorder sales really help that book that first week to help establish further demand and get it on any lists. If you want to get a normie into crypto, this fun tale just may do it. Someone who worked with me on the book and knew nothing at all about crypto when we started, and after just two days of reading it and being nowhere near done with it, was asking me such intelligent questions about crypto that I asked, how do you know so much about crypto? Their response from your book. By the end, they were completely obsessed and had already ordered a hardware wallet. Preorder the cryptopians idealism, greed, lies and the making of the first big cryptocurrency craze today at Bitly Cryptopians. That's bit ly cryptopians. And now onto the show.

00:03:08.914 - 00:03:11.230, Speaker A: Welcome, Jess. Hi, Nora.
00:03:11.250 - 00:03:12.300, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:03:13.310 - 00:03:29.550, Speaker A: There have been a number of recent hacks in crypto and in DeFi, in particular, Elliptic just came out with a report giving an overview of crime in DeFi, which you dub D crime. In the report. Can you give us an overview of the state of crime in DeFi?
00:03:30.130 - 00:04:01.862, Speaker B: Sure. So, in terms of hacks, we monitor for two main types. That's with regard to exchanges and also, as you've said, with regard to DFI. So we've seen a vast increase in the hacks in the DFI space within the last year. So to give you some figures so of all time. So, since around 2016, when we started monitoring for these, there's been a total of over $12 billion worth of loss in the DFI space. And that's with regard to two different types of loss.
00:04:01.862 - 00:04:35.954, Speaker B: So one which we call direct loss. So that's the funds that were stolen directly from the DeFi protocols, and the second is called the protocol loss. So if a DeFi protocol is attacked by a hacker, the value of the protocol may drop in the days afterwards. So, for example, the value of the governance tokens may drop in the days afterwards. So there's a lot of that loss is accounted for by the protocol loss rather than the direct loss. So of that, 12,000,000,001.5 billion was lost last year, and 10.5
00:04:35.954 - 00:04:54.362, Speaker B: billion has been lost this year. So we've seen a vast increase in this loss in the last year. Not only are we seeing an increase in the value loss, but we're seeing an increase in the frequency of these attacks. So these days, it's not unusual to see sort of over ten hacks of this type per month. Wow.
00:04:54.416 - 00:05:08.830, Speaker A: And just to clarify about the $12 billion number, 10.5 billion lost this year, is that the direct loss, or is that the economic loss where it's the value of the protocol that decreased afterward?
00:05:09.170 - 00:05:17.762, Speaker B: The 10.5 this year is accounts for both, both the direct loss and the protocol loss. And then the 1.5 from last year, again, also accounts for both.
00:05:17.896 - 00:05:21.300, Speaker A: And if you were to just break out direct loss, what is the figure?
00:05:21.910 - 00:05:48.918, Speaker B: So we see generally the direct loss accounts for a much smaller portion of the total loss. So if we go back to those original figures, so 2 billion in direct loss of all time and 10 billion in protocol loss of all time. So you can sort of see how that would work out over this year. So if we're seeing around 10 billion total loss this year, we might see one to 2 billion in direct loss.
00:05:49.094 - 00:06:00.030, Speaker A: Okay. And so you said that the frequency is accelerating. What also do you see in terms of the size of the thefts in DeFi?
00:06:00.930 - 00:06:32.330, Speaker B: Yes. So the size of thefts isn't necessarily increasing at the same rate as the frequency. It really depends on the protocol which is attacked and the success of the particular hacker. We are seeing a number of very high profile, high value hacks though. So we can look at the polynetwork hack earlier this year in which the hacker stole $611,000,000 worth. So we are definitely seeing an overall increase, but not as easily as we're seeing in the frequency increase.
00:06:33.470 - 00:06:59.646, Speaker A: And for these different hacks, do they tend to be more the user's fault? Because obviously I know that everybody in crypto is aware that there are a lot of phishing scams out there on Twitter, in your email, on your text messages and telegram, like just pretty much anywhere you go on the internet there's phishing scammers targeting you. Or is it more often the case that the protocol or smart contract has flaws?
00:06:59.838 - 00:07:51.570, Speaker B: It's definitely more often the case that the protocol or the smart contract has flaws. So the biggest cause of loss, so the biggest exploit that the hacker takes advantage of is what we call bug vulnerabilities. So that consists of either code vulnerabilities, so there's been an error in the coding which the hacker takes advantage of in order to steal the money, or there's an error in the way in which the protocol was set up in the first place. So we call this like an economic vulnerability. So an example of that, the mono X hack recently occurred when a hacker artificially inflated the price of the monotoken and they used the artificial value in order to purchase all of the other assets related to that DeFi. So that's what we would describe as an economic vulnerability. But both of those types are under the umbrella term of a bug vulnerability.
00:07:51.570 - 00:08:36.930, Speaker B: So that's definitely the highest sort of category that accounts for the most hacks. Further down we have sort of unauthorized access to private keys and that's private keys of individual users as well as private keys of hot wallets belonging to protocols and exchanges themselves. And then we also have rug pools. The stats we have show that rug pools account for quite a small portion of the overall hacks. One of the main reasons for that is it's always quite difficult to verify rug pool and there's always accusations of rug pools whenever a DeFi protocol is attacked. But a really clear example we can see from this year is the Squid coin. So Squid coin was popularized due to the Squid Game Netflix show and received a lot of interest from users.
00:08:36.930 - 00:08:47.350, Speaker B: Shortly afterwards they rug pulled and sort of withdrew all the value out of that token. But that's a very small proportion of hacks are down to rug pools.
00:08:49.210 - 00:09:18.480, Speaker A: For the rug pool example, how do you prove that it was something that was intentional? Because as you said, I'm sure a lot of the various hacks people will accuse the developers themselves of having done it and in a way it probably isn't that difficult to, this isn't the normal meaning of civil attack, but basically fake your identity and pretend like it was somebody else. So how do you prove that?
00:09:19.010 - 00:09:50.060, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a really good question. So one of the ways you can try to prove a rug pool is to look at the behavior of the protocol around the time that the hack occurs. So some very clear examples might be that all social media, all telegram groups or discord groups are closed at the exact same time that the hack occurs and the sort of creator of the DeFi protocol is just trying to disappear. So that would be a very clear indicator that accusations of a rug pull may be correct.
00:09:51.150 - 00:09:59.660, Speaker A: And so earlier you were saying that code exploits are the number one most common way for these hacks to take place. What's an example of one of those?
00:10:00.110 - 00:10:23.694, Speaker B: Sure. So an example of a code exploit. So the difficulty with DeFi and the DApps that run these DeFi protocols is that a lot of DApps are based on previous DApps. So if you find a vulnerability in the code of one of them, chances are that vulnerability is going to be in existence in a lot of the other codes as well. So an example of a code hack?
00:10:23.822 - 00:10:39.610, Speaker A: Well, from your report you guys had Vswap, and when I saw that I was like, oh, this is a replay sort of of the first, not the second parity multisig wallet hack. I don't know if you do you know about the initializing, the contract?
00:10:40.670 - 00:10:42.666, Speaker B: No, I'm not sure what you're referring to.
00:10:42.688 - 00:11:16.946, Speaker A: Okay, well, so in the elliptic report it said that this Vswap code hack basically happened because I guess initializing kind of like makes you the owner of so I'm not going to be able to explain it on a super technical level just off the cuff. But then because they were able to make themselves the owner, then they pulled the funds. But the same thing happened back in 2017 with the second parity multisig hack where they were able to set themselves as the owner and so they did. So and then they locked the funds away.
00:11:17.128 - 00:11:18.260, Speaker B: Right, yeah.
00:11:19.510 - 00:11:24.082, Speaker A: But did you have another idea in mind of another code exploit?
00:11:24.226 - 00:11:32.966, Speaker B: Not off the top of my head. The example I was going to give you with regard to bug exploits was the poly network. But that was like an economic exploit rather than a code exploit.
00:11:33.158 - 00:11:50.718, Speaker A: Oh yeah, and those are really fascinating because I feel like they're only possible in DeFi or maybe not only, but especially very quickly with the Flash loans. So are there any particular chains that you feel are more susceptible to having their DeFi protocols hacked than others?
00:11:50.884 - 00:12:28.234, Speaker B: Yes, so what we see is the majority of hacks occur on the Ethereum blockchain and the reason for that is Ethereum is more established, it's more used in the DeFi space. But this year in particular we are also seeing a number of hacks on the Binance smart chain and on polygon network. So they're definitely diversifying across different blockchains. And another thing that we've seen quite commonly in recent instance is that a hack or an exploit will affect a number of different blockchains, so it might affect Ethereum and Finance smart chain rather than just an individual blockchain. Wow.
00:12:28.352 - 00:12:49.346, Speaker A: Super fascinating. Okay, so in a moment, we're going to discuss more about where hacks are going.

So, as we were discussing at the beginning, there's been a few big hacks recently. There was Vulcan Forged, which was hacked for 140,000,000. BitMart, which is actually a centralized exchange, was hacked for 196,000,000.
00:13:49.830 - 00:14:09.370, Speaker A: There was Badger Dow, 120,000,000 and another one, Ascend X for 83 million. And I know Elliptic will be publishing a blog post, I believe, Monday, noting that it's about $600 million in 14 days that's been stolen. So what do you make of this recent spate of attacks?
00:14:09.710 - 00:14:45.880, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it's certainly shocking and I think it doesn't quite receive the attention that it deserves. If this was like a traditional finance, maybe this would be more sort of front page news, but there is, like, a very, very high value losses occurring very regularly. And I think one of the aspects of that that might be slightly being lost is that it's not just these sort of decentralized apps that are losing funds. There's very human stories behind these as well. So whenever, like, a hack occurs, we see these very sad stories on social media or in telegram, groups of people losing their entire life savings. So that's one aspect of it that I think could also be focused on more.
00:14:46.650 - 00:14:54.570, Speaker A: And earlier this year, there was an uptick in ransomware and that really dominated the news. What's happened to that trend?
00:14:55.470 - 00:15:35.202, Speaker B: They're still very, very active in the ransomware space. We've seen a number of different trends this year. So particularly around summer or June, July this year, a number of very, very high profile attacks occurred. And as a result, a number of the top ransomware groups retired, rebranded in an attempt to avoid sort of law enforcement attention. So we've seen a very common trend this year has been these sort of like constant rebrandings after a very high profile attack. But another trend that we've seen this year is like increased law enforcement success. So recently we've seen funds being seized from reeval affiliates, we've seen individuals associated with those ransomware groups arrested.
00:15:35.202 - 00:15:38.810, Speaker B: So there's been a number of really interesting trends this year around ransomware.
00:15:39.710 - 00:15:50.426, Speaker A: And so now, once these various thieves get a hold of their crypto, how easily can they cash out and are you finding that they're able to at all?
00:15:50.608 - 00:16:53.594, Speaker B: Yes, so I think there's an interesting difference when you look at a type of crime like a DeFi hack versus ransomware. So with DeFi, there's a very clear method of cashing out, which if you're sort of on the more sophisticated end of the hackers, you'll identify and be able to use very easily. So the first thing you want to do if you steal a load of funds, and that's probably going to include native currencies like Ether and Finance coin, as well as tokens. So specifically, ERC, 20 tokens have stolen a lot in these type of hacks. Because you're stealing tokens, there are some token issuers that are able to freeze the funds and this is particularly with regards to stable coins, but also other types of tokens. So if you steal some tether and some USD coin, the first thing you're going to want to do is to swap that into either the native currency of the blockchain you're using or other potentially stable coins like dai, which don't have those freezing abilities. So that's the very first step that we see hackers take, is to quickly swap all of those tokens into the native currency.
00:16:53.594 - 00:17:52.254, Speaker B: And the second thing you'll probably want to do is use something like a decentralized mixer and on the Ethereum blockchain is one very, very clear standout leader in that space and that's tornado cash. So a lot of these funds are then laundered through tornado cash, which makes it tricky to follow the flow of funds and to see where they're cashing out. Interestingly, we don't see all DeFi hackers use that methodology. So some DeFi hackers keep hold of the funds and they might try to bounce it through a few different wallets, but they don't sort of make any attempt to cash out. And that might be because they were sort of focused on whether they could steal the funds and once they've stolen them, they're not quite sure what to do with them, or maybe they're just trying to lie low for a bit and not cause any huge transactions which might alert token issuers or exchanges. So that's sort of the DeFi space. If we look at ransomware, it's definitely becoming more tricky to cash out ransomware funds and that's because the majority of ransomware payments are still paid in Bitcoin.
00:17:52.254 - 00:18:36.930, Speaker B: And we've developed very sophisticated techniques to be able to trace the flow of funds on the Bitcoin blockchain. They are, however, able to utilize certain services which are still available to them. So unregulated exchanges, for example, we've seen some in person exchanges that are accessible by visiting particular offices in particular countries, or there's certain services available on the Bitcoin blockchain which are not regulated because they don't take custody of your funds. So particular services like Wasabi, which is a privacy wallet, is quite heavily used by ransomware groups because of its non custodial nature. It means it's not currently regulated and therefore they can use that service in order to enable their cashing out activities.
00:18:38.150 - 00:19:01.302, Speaker A: Wow, this is so fascinating. I just wanted to ask about one of the examples you gave of how people can do this in person, they can cash out in person. I'm assuming that those are either in jurisdictions where there isn't a lot of law enforcement around these things or what jurisdictions does that typically happen in?
00:19:01.436 - 00:19:39.998, Speaker B: Yeah, you're completely correct there. That is specifically in jurisdictions where there's not that sort of law enforcement appetite to crack down on ransomware. But interestingly, we've seen those services also operate in other jurisdictions. So recently we came across a service very similar to the two exchanges which have recently been sanctioned by the US. So those two exchanges were called Suex and Chatex and it's a very similar service to that which also has the ability to facilitate cash transfers in America. So we are sort of actively investigating those services as would.
00:19:40.104 - 00:19:49.274, Speaker A: Can you put a percentage on maybe how many of these thieves or what amount of the funds actually does get.
00:19:49.312 - 00:19:53.850, Speaker B: Cashed out in terms of the ransomware groups?
00:19:55.310 - 00:19:57.466, Speaker A: Yeah, all of Cryptocrime or both.
00:19:57.648 - 00:20:26.486, Speaker B: Okay, sure, I can give you an exact percentage. In terms of ransomware, we see like a much longer term cashing out strategy, so they don't necessarily move the funds as quickly as something like a hacker for a DeFi protocol. But yeah, unfortunately I couldn't give you a percentage on the exact number of all illicit funds that are cashed out. But we have seen very high usage of services like Wasabi wallet and who.
00:20:26.508 - 00:20:37.110, Speaker A: Do the hackers tend to be? Have you guys identified and maybe they differ depending on whether it's like DeFi versus ransomware or centralized exchanges.
00:20:37.470 - 00:21:46.750, Speaker B: Yes, I would say they differ depending not necessarily on the crime type, but with regard to DFI hacks, we don't necessarily always or most occasions potentially don't identify individuals behind the hacks. But there could be features of the hacks which might enable you to build like a profile of the type of hacker. So we see very sophisticated hacks that occur and then very sophisticated money laundering patterns that occur afterwards, which indicates they might be experienced in this, whereas we also see hackers who steal the funds and then sort of panic afterwards they might be in contact with the exchange. We see the use of messages on the ethereum blockchain, so messages are bouncing back between the hackers and the victims or they might sort of show off about their hacks on social media, particularly Twitter. So there's a very distinguished different groups of people that commit these sort of DeFi hacks with regards to crime types like ransomware. Again we see sort of variety of people engage in these kind of activities, but generally sort of young, sort of technically capable individuals.
00:21:47.730 - 00:21:53.150, Speaker A: Okay, and how well has law enforcement been able to go after these various thieves?
00:21:54.470 - 00:23:03.190, Speaker B: Yeah, so again, differs per crime type because crimes like ransomware occur in jurisdictions where sort of US UK law enforcement don't have easy access to. They're not always able to successfully conduct investigations. Although we have seen an increase in success this year, particularly and even where individuals haven't been arrested, they may have been sanctioned or they may have had funds seized from them. So there still are law enforcement activities that can take place other than the arrest of a suspect. So yeah, it really differs per crime type and it differs with regard to sort of the sophistication of the crime. So some hacks or some money laundering activities can be susceptible to very easy mistakes and if those mistakes occur, it makes it easier to follow the flow of funds and therefore it might be easier to identify identification opportunities. For example, if those funds then go to a regulated exchange which does conduct like KYC, then that might be an identification opportunity for law enforcement.
00:23:03.690 - 00:23:14.650, Speaker A: And does the fact that most of these blockchains or is the fact that most of these blockchains are transparent affect that ability or does it make it easier for law enforcement?
00:23:15.150 - 00:23:48.630, Speaker B: It's definitely a benefit to law enforcement. So if you think about the transparency of the flur funds on something like the Bitcoin blockchain versus traditional finance, so the benefit of Bitcoin is that we can all study the blockchain and we can look for patterns and identify sort of red flag indicators or identify suspicious activity. And we also blockchain analytics companies like Elliptic have been around for a fair amount of time now and have developed very sophisticated techniques to be able to follow the flow of funds. So definitely the transparency of blockchains is a massive bonus in these kind of cases.
00:23:48.970 - 00:23:53.480, Speaker A: And what would you say could be done to help prevent more of these hacks in the future?
00:23:54.490 - 00:24:40.440, Speaker B: Yeah, so that's a really good question. So because right now DFI is like a very new, very innovative space. Unfortunately that also means it's not particularly sophisticated yet in terms of regulation or industry wide agreed upon certain standards. So there are certain things as a user you might be able to look out for. So some DeFi services have their smart contracts audited, and that's just an indication that they are trying to avoid things like code exploits. So that might be something you can look out for. But really the onus on this potentially should be more on the DeFi protocol itself to ensure they are carrying out these checks, to look for any vulnerabilities so that they can be sort of closed off.
00:24:41.370 - 00:24:48.070, Speaker A: And what would your advice be for people who participate in DeFi, who don't want to become victims of these various crimes?
00:24:49.850 - 00:25:41.030, Speaker B: I think my advice would be, as always, with anything to do with crypto, if you're using it as an investment, don't invest more obviously than you're prepared to lose. So we see lots of stories of people investing their life savings into various cryptocurrencies or into DeFi protocols who are then obviously very distressed when they lose all of these funds. So that's very one general rule around cryptocurrency in general. Again, as a user, there's not a whole lot you can do other than look out for these things. Like, has the smart contract been audited? Is the issuer of the token or the creator of the smart contract? Is there any footprint about them that you could look at? Do they have, like, a website or is there like a telegram group that you could join and engage with the creator, but in general as the user? Yeah, it is unfortunately a little bit risky.
00:25:41.930 - 00:25:46.726, Speaker A: All right, well, this has been such a fascinating interview. Thank you so much for coming on Unconfirmed.
00:25:46.838 - 00:25:49.466, Speaker B: No worries. Thank you very much having me. It's great to speak with you.
00:25:49.648 - 00:26:23.762, Speaker A: Don't forget, next up is the weekly news recap. Stick around for this week in crypto after this short break. Did you know that exchanges take up to a 25% cut on your staking rewards? But you don't need an exchange to stake. You can run a validator at home, join thousands of solo stakers, get an Avato device, plug it in, deposit your stake, and earn the full reward. Avato created the best hardware and specific software to stake and keeps your validator on the latest version through auto updates. Onetime investment, 100% profit. Go to Avato.
00:26:23.762 - 00:27:31.630, Speaker A: That's ava do. Thanks for tuning into this week's news recap. In hearing senators go tough on stablecoins, this week senators took both stablecoins and DeFi to task during a Banking committee meeting. Senator and committee chair Sherrod Brown started the hearing with prepared remarks saying, cryptocurrencies advocates argue that crypto assets are superior to real dollars because they are decentralized and transparent, but stablecoins are neither. He added, Stablecoins make it easier than ever to risk real dollars on cryptocurrencies that are at best volatile and at worst, outright fraudulent. Senator Elizabeth Warren also chimed in, expounding upon the dangers of stablecoins and DeFi, saying stablecoins pose risks to consumers and to our economy. They're propping up some of the shadiest parts of the crypto world DeFi where consumers are least protected from getting scammed.
00:27:31.630 - 00:28:46.706, Speaker A: She went on to say, DeFi is where the regulation is effectively absent. And no surprise, it's where the scammers and the cheats and the swindlers mix among part time investors and first time crypto traders. Not every voice in the room was so negative, Senator Pat Toomey took the side of DeFi, citing cross border payments, programmability and efficiency as different ways that stablecoins improve upon fiat money. Toomey also emphasized that regulation should not stifle innovation and called for regulators to have the humility to recognize that many of our views about how financial services are delivered and how investments work are quickly becoming outdated.

Ave Votes to Close Source Code Token holders of Ave, the fourth largest DFI protocol by total value locked, voted to make the code for the upcoming Ave V Three release restricted by a business license. This vote is essentially a signal on whether or not the Ave community wants to protect its intellectual property from unauthorized use, or simply allow anyone to use the code in any way they prefer, explained the proposal that was passed by a slim majority of 55%. A business license restricting the use of code in DFI was first introduced by Uniswap, which most likely instituted such a practice due to being forked and vampire attacked by sushi swap during 2000 and twenty's DFI summer.
