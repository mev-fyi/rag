00:00:00.090 - 00:00:07.418, Speaker A: Don't think an exchange created slurf. I do think that the destruction of the contributions as a marketing strategy is plausible.
00:00:07.514 - 00:00:12.954, Speaker B: You think that's plausible? You think $10 million. $10 million burn is a plausible marketing strategy?
00:00:13.082 - 00:00:13.760, Speaker A: Yes.
00:00:14.130 - 00:00:15.210, Speaker C: Not a dividend.
00:00:15.290 - 00:00:16.474, Speaker D: It's a tale of two quan.
00:00:16.522 - 00:00:19.162, Speaker B: Now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet.
00:00:19.226 - 00:00:21.754, Speaker C: Generally speaking, airdrops are kind of pointless anyways.
00:00:21.882 - 00:00:24.570, Speaker B: Unnamed trading firms who are very involved.
00:00:24.650 - 00:00:29.880, Speaker A: I'll defi protocols are the antidote to this problem.
00:00:30.490 - 00:00:40.390, Speaker B: Hello, everybody. Welcome to the chopping block. Every couple weeks, let's get together and give the industry insider's perspective on the crypto topics of the day. So quick intros. First, we got Tom, the defi maven and master of memes.
00:00:40.550 - 00:00:41.580, Speaker C: Hello, everyone.
00:00:42.430 - 00:00:45.686, Speaker B: Next we've got Robert, the crypto connoisseur and czar of superstate.
00:00:45.798 - 00:00:46.700, Speaker A: Good morning.
00:00:47.470 - 00:00:51.130, Speaker B: Then we've got Tarun the gigabrain and grandpuba at Gauntlet.
00:00:51.630 - 00:00:53.420, Speaker D: Yo, what's up?
00:00:53.950 - 00:01:16.658, Speaker B: And finally, I'm Haseeb, the head hype man at Dragonfly. So we are early stage investors in crypto, but I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice, legal advice, or even life advice. Please see chopping blocks at XYZ for more disclosures. So bull market in full force. Although we had a little bit of retracement today, it seems like bitcoin is back at 60. What is it, 64 or something? 63.
00:01:16.744 - 00:01:18.146, Speaker A: 62 and a half.
00:01:18.328 - 00:01:46.910, Speaker B: 62 and a half. Yeah. So it kind of pulled back a little bit. Very disappointing. But we kind of went all the way to 70K Salana top 200. So lot of really strong bull market vibes that we're getting here, but things are kind of flailing around quite a bit, which is, I think, pretty standard for a market that's this wild. So did you guys hear the Laura Shin interview with Kyle?
00:01:47.410 - 00:02:17.480, Speaker A: I have it bookmarked. It's like one of these things. Really excited. Know, when I first saw that, it was announced, I was like, oh, no, Laura, what are you like? He's a terrible. Like, why are you interviewing him? But the response that I've seen on Twitter and online has just been really impressed with the quality of her interview and the fact that she asked hard hitting questions. And so when I get a free moment, I'm really looking forward to watching.
00:02:17.850 - 00:02:21.418, Speaker B: All right, well, if you guys haven't seen it, we can circle back when you guys actually.
00:02:21.584 - 00:02:46.000, Speaker D: I'm actually very afraid to listen to it just more, because, honestly, even the clips just sound like listening to a psychopath. I don't know. It's, like, a little too disturbing. I feel like I'm, like a person who hates watching horror movies, and this feels like you're trying to go see a horror movie. I don't know. Somehow I have that feeling about it.
00:02:47.090 - 00:03:17.910, Speaker B: It was pretty painful. Yeah. Funny enough, I listened to the Don Lemon interview, like, right after I listened to the Don Lemon view of Elon Musk, right after I listened to the Kyle interview, which are both painful listens, but in different ways. Anyway. All right, cool. So let's talk about Solana. So, Solana, as we have mentioned many times now, meme coin frenzy, and there's this new trend on Salana of, I guess, what are called presale tokens.
00:03:17.910 - 00:03:25.466, Speaker B: So presale tokens, basically, they seem to be, like, basically ICOs, but whatever, they have a name. The name is presale tokens.
00:03:25.498 - 00:03:27.194, Speaker A: They're 100% icos.
00:03:27.242 - 00:03:30.010, Speaker D: 100% icos. Without the contract.
00:03:30.170 - 00:04:16.718, Speaker B: They're worse icos. Yeah, they're worse versions of ICOs. Okay, so normally in an ICO, so you remember this is the 2017 vintage kind of flavor of the week at that time. So, in a normal ICO, you send money to a contract, and the contract essentially ensures that you will receive some amount of tokens based on the total amount that's raised. And that was more or less sensible forms of fundraising that you can imagine that eventually were deemed to be not okay by the SEC. Okay, now, what is a pre sell token? A pre sell token is you decide that you're going to launch a meme coin, and you tell people, send money to my address, and then later I will send you some meme coins. But there is no enforceability of, like, I sent you the stuff, and you send me the stuff.
00:04:16.718 - 00:04:40.626, Speaker B: It's kind of just like, bro, trust me, send me a shitload of money, and I will send you some amount of meme coins. And there's, like, multipliers often, so if you retweet the original tweet, then they'll give you more tokens. If you drop your address, you get more. So I don't know. It requires not even writing a smart contract at this point to launch a meme coin. You just need some Twitter game, essentially, to get off the ground.
00:04:40.658 - 00:04:48.182, Speaker C: To be fair, Ethereum, the greatest ICO, was also a trust me, bro, send me some bitcoin, and I will send you some ether, whatever the.
00:04:48.236 - 00:05:00.766, Speaker B: But that was cross chain. That was cross chain. So I'm going to give them a break on that. I'm going to give them a break on that. But when you're intrachain, I feel like, dude, this is why we invented these things, is to allow contracts without trust, right?
00:05:00.868 - 00:05:12.638, Speaker A: Ethereum was also before smart contracts existed. They raised the funds great points to create the EVM and contracts in the first place so that nobody would ever have to do that again.
00:05:12.804 - 00:05:23.390, Speaker C: There are a lot of things that devs and I think ICo participants should be doing that they're not doing, and I just feel like not having smart contracts is just one more step. It's just incredible.
00:05:23.470 - 00:05:40.370, Speaker B: Vitalik died for our sins. He did the first, trust me, bro, ico, so that we don't have to. But here we are, full circle. So there's been over $100 million sent to various meme coin presales over the weekend. The most notable of them is this meme coin called Slurf.
00:05:40.530 - 00:05:41.430, Speaker A: Slurf.
00:05:41.850 - 00:05:44.838, Speaker B: Slurf. Robert, are you a proud slurf holder?
00:05:44.934 - 00:05:47.622, Speaker A: No, I haven't bought any of these horrible.
00:05:47.686 - 00:05:55.806, Speaker D: Well, Robert, however, is the DGen lore master of this podcast, as we've learned over time. Maybe we should get him to give us.
00:05:55.988 - 00:06:00.506, Speaker B: Let's circle around the fire and let Uncle Robert tell us about the story of Slurf.
00:06:00.618 - 00:06:38.090, Speaker A: Okay, so Slurf originated, like many of these pre sale tokens do, with everybody sending their money to a random stranger on Twitter who simply posts a Solana address and says, send me all your money. Trust me, bro. And clearly there was some preparation and foresight that went into this. Slurf had a website that had a ugly picture of a sloth, hence the name Slurf. It's like a mispronunciation of sloth. And it was a relatively well built website. It had a couple of cool, innovative features that probably took a couple of hours to build.
00:06:38.090 - 00:07:48.500, Speaker A: Like there was a pie chart that showed the top contributions by sender, things that went beyond what these average tweet fundraisers that people spin up with zero preparation in 30 seconds generally hold. Slurf raised about $10 million with a somewhat cartoonish website, and all appeared, well, a short time later, the Slurf developer, and I don't have his name on the top of my hand, but the slurf developer announced something along the lines of, I'm terribly sorry, I messed up big. I took all the money from all of the presale contributions and I locked it in an LP contract and burned the entire lp contract and the entire supply. Now, normally what happens in these pre sales is the developer creates an LP token with the money and some tokens, and then gives the rest of the tokens to the presale contributors. In this case, he put all of the tokens into the buy buy bin. And the entire supply of Slurf was locked in this LP token, of which he didn't own anymore. And so there was a market.
00:07:48.500 - 00:08:29.454, Speaker A: The entire supply of Slurf and the original financial contributions in Seoul were all locked in this liquidity pool, which was an amm. And he announced that he messed up. I think it was like he cursed or said something to that effect, and everybody made fun of him. A short time later, trading volume and Slurf exploded. It was rapidly listed on finance after hitting a 700 million dollar market cap in a matter of hours. And at this point, there was a public analysis and investigation of the situation. A couple of really interesting details have come out.
00:08:29.454 - 00:08:36.010, Speaker A: And I only know this because I listened to a Twitter space. I don't have deep personal firsthand research on this.
00:08:36.100 - 00:08:37.426, Speaker B: Don't you have a job?
00:08:37.608 - 00:08:40.562, Speaker A: I do, but gather around the campfire so we can discuss like the.
00:08:40.696 - 00:08:42.980, Speaker B: Sorry, didn't mean to interrupt. Sorry.
00:08:44.070 - 00:08:47.954, Speaker D: Part of his job is being entertaining for this podcast, so I don't know what you're saying.
00:08:47.992 - 00:08:49.650, Speaker B: That is true. All right, I apologize.
00:08:49.730 - 00:08:52.258, Speaker A: Part of my job is being with it. Haseeb.
00:08:52.434 - 00:08:53.158, Speaker B: Okay.
00:08:53.324 - 00:09:52.662, Speaker A: So people came to the realization by doing some on chain analysis that the Slurth developer actually rugged his own pre sale immediately before vaporizing all the funds. So the Slurf developer was one of the first contributors to this presale. He put 1000 soul into the presale of his own money and used this to build confidence. And then immediately prior to the Slurf token being deployed and the presale contributions being locked forever, he actually rescinded his own contribution and took his thousand soul back. And this led many people to the expectation that this was a very premeditated event, that in reality this was marketing. It was something new and innovative to cut through the noise of all of these cookie cutter presales. And there's a widespread expectation, which I'm personally a believer in, that this was a non accidental set of circumstances.
00:09:52.806 - 00:09:59.754, Speaker B: So there's a conspiracy theory about the meme coin. That's correct. It was $10 million.
00:09:59.952 - 00:10:02.074, Speaker A: $10 million. That was $10 million.
00:10:02.272 - 00:10:05.006, Speaker B: $10 million of sold. Correct.
00:10:05.108 - 00:10:09.742, Speaker D: I believe Robert also overheard another conspiracy theory about the source of the.
00:10:09.796 - 00:10:11.760, Speaker B: Oh, there's more. Oh, good.
00:10:12.450 - 00:10:47.500, Speaker A: I also overheard another conspiracy theory. And this one, I put it a lower probability. But the other conspiracy theory was that a lot of these presale tokens are actually being created by offshore exchanges that are looking to build trading volume in new assets and build up excitement. This conspiracy theory comes from the fact that a lot of these tokens have been listed so quickly on these exchanges that it's led some people to believe that there's a relationship between the exchanges listing them almost instantaneously and the development of some of these assets. But I don't have any evidence there.
00:10:48.110 - 00:11:19.670, Speaker D: It just feels a little bit like the 2020 2021 era where some of the tokens were a little too close to exchange operators, as we learned in hindsight. And somehow the fact that these got listed really quickly and then also, I don't know if you saw Justin sun said Wobie HTX is donating all the fees to cover the. There was just so much that was done by the centralized exchange world around it that it's hard to believe it was organic.
00:11:21.050 - 00:11:34.842, Speaker B: All right, look, I'm not going to take a view either way. It would make sense in principle for a decentralized exchange to do it, but the fact that it got listed on Binance immediately, like, binance is not manufacturing meme coins. They make so much money doing all their normal stuff.
00:11:34.896 - 00:11:36.058, Speaker D: Well, it might not have been them.
00:11:36.144 - 00:11:37.190, Speaker B: I could see a long tail.
00:11:37.270 - 00:11:41.594, Speaker D: Lower down, lower down doing it, and then it just went up quickly.
00:11:41.792 - 00:11:43.666, Speaker B: Yeah, but I mean, d five protocol.
00:11:43.798 - 00:11:44.798, Speaker D: Get listed quickly.
00:11:44.884 - 00:11:57.054, Speaker B: Burning $10 million is not. That is not a good way to do anything. Well, surely there's a better ro. Yeah, but that's the core conspiracy, isn't it?
00:11:57.172 - 00:11:57.786, Speaker A: Well, the core.
00:11:57.818 - 00:11:58.994, Speaker B: What else is manufactured here?
00:11:59.032 - 00:12:06.830, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't think an exchange created slurf. I do think that the destruction of the contributions as a marketing strategy is plausible.
00:12:06.910 - 00:13:00.246, Speaker B: Do you think that's plausible? You think $10 million burn is a plausible marketing strategy? Yes, I think $10 million is like a great take for a meme coin. The other thing that I learned recently, I was chatting with somebody who was talking about memecoin fair launches, and there was some meme coin that was fair launched, and they were like, yeah, I'm part of this meme coin team, and we did a fair launch and it's doing really well, but I'm going to donate my share. And I'm like, wait, I thought you just said it was a fair launch. How's their share? And they were like, oh, no, it's a fair launch. But, like, in meme coins, fair launches are different. Fair launch in a meme coin just means that there's no VCs. And I'm like, what about that is fair, that there's no VCs, therefore it's fair.
00:13:00.246 - 00:13:34.606, Speaker B: And then I looked it up and there was an article in Coingecko because I don't know meme coins, I guess all culture, so it doesn't live document anywhere. But there was an article written by Coingecko that talked about what fair launches were. And I was like, all right, I was going to show this to them and be like, yo, fuck, this is not a fair launch. And there was a sentence there that said, for meme coins, fair launches often refer to that. There's no VC allocation, which is insane to me, just the bastardization of terminology. Fair launch used to mean literally like Satoshi style launch. Everybody gets on equal terms.
00:13:34.606 - 00:13:44.420, Speaker B: There's no dev allocation and now it just means no VCs. Which I'm like, what VCs are even investing in the meme coins? What does it even mean, no VC allocation? What VCs are doing these?
00:13:44.870 - 00:13:48.642, Speaker A: Yeah, that's definitely marketing to attract participants.
00:13:48.786 - 00:13:56.454, Speaker C: To be fair. I think I heard rumor that there's a round going around for DGen, the forecaster meme coin that VCs are looking at.
00:13:56.492 - 00:13:58.650, Speaker D: That wasn't a rumor that was announced.
00:14:00.270 - 00:14:01.226, Speaker C: Never mind. There you go.
00:14:01.248 - 00:14:02.486, Speaker D: That was a real round.
00:14:02.678 - 00:14:05.910, Speaker B: Okay, who's doing that round?
00:14:06.070 - 00:14:07.370, Speaker A: Not fair launch.
00:14:08.270 - 00:14:12.714, Speaker D: I think it was one confirmation. I think it was one confirmation. Yes, it's on.
00:14:12.752 - 00:14:15.098, Speaker B: It was one confirmation. Oh jeez.
00:14:15.194 - 00:14:17.134, Speaker C: Filthy DC coin. I want that.
00:14:17.172 - 00:14:19.178, Speaker B: Did you get the pitch? Did you get the pitch?
00:14:19.354 - 00:14:20.714, Speaker D: What is a meme coin pitch?
00:14:20.762 - 00:14:21.840, Speaker B: I want to know.
00:14:22.530 - 00:14:25.582, Speaker D: I don't think Memecoin founders talk to me. They launch before.
00:14:25.636 - 00:14:30.290, Speaker B: Yeah, meme coin founders, they pass us over. We're not cool enough for the meme coin teams.
00:14:30.790 - 00:14:37.620, Speaker A: I mean, the pitch has got to be like we're going to make good vibes and somehow make the meme coin go up.
00:14:38.310 - 00:15:03.760, Speaker B: I think the pitch is that we are going to take funds and burn them as a publicity stunt and that's how we're going to take off. And then we're going to take donations from exchanges. That would be pretty next level. Yeah, I feel like every time we talk about meme coins I get dumber and dumber. You're like spending your whole day on this stuff, dude. What are you talking about?
00:15:04.210 - 00:15:08.106, Speaker A: I spent like nine minutes listening to the slur.
00:15:08.218 - 00:15:12.190, Speaker B: You spent nine minutes and you got all of that in nine minutes out of Twitter space?
00:15:12.260 - 00:15:15.380, Speaker A: Of course, they covered the base really quickly.
00:15:17.590 - 00:15:40.166, Speaker B: So the meme coin teams are very to the point, very efficient with their communication. Okay, well, damn. Well, we're at a point now where so Solana is now at this point. I mean, it's a meme coin chain at this point. Like, almost all the activity on Salana is meme coin trading. The ETH and Salana volume are basically on par at this point. If you look at Dex volumes.
00:15:40.166 - 00:15:54.590, Speaker B: So I'm just looking at DFI llama right now. It actually looks like 24 hours volume. Salana is actually higher than Ethereum, although Ethereum is higher on seven day. But Salana has basically flipped Ethereum for total volume.
00:15:55.330 - 00:15:57.502, Speaker D: I mean, also Solana flipped bitcoin and.
00:15:57.556 - 00:16:02.010, Speaker B: Transaction fees recently, but still below Ethereum.
00:16:02.170 - 00:16:06.000, Speaker D: Still below Ethereum. But it's like a big accomplishment given their level of.
00:16:06.390 - 00:16:28.182, Speaker B: Yeah, so really dramatic. I guess the question is, how long do you guys think that this meme coin mania is going to persist? I mean, it's already at the point where Salana UX is very degraded, where I was talking with some folks who are telling me, like, 50% of transactions are dropping now on Salana. That's how just crazy the activity on the chain is.
00:16:28.316 - 00:16:50.542, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I saw people are obviously critiquing the UX right now of Salana and totally tweeted a video of him doing a transaction. And he was like, look, guys, it still works. And it took like 40 seconds to confirm a transaction. And I was like, okay, well, it definitely still works, but it just spun around for like, a 42nd clip, and.
00:16:50.596 - 00:17:05.170, Speaker C: People are setting, like, insane slippage limits. Like, I saw people talking Twitter, like, oh, you got to set your slippage like 50% so your trade goes through. And it's just like, what? Yeah, anything. I will fill my slurf at any price. That's.
00:17:06.250 - 00:17:09.960, Speaker B: Who knows what the price the fair value of slurf is? You never know.
00:17:12.490 - 00:17:39.360, Speaker D: I wish we could do anonymous interviews of people who try to ape into these presale things. I just want to hear their stories. I really want the real talk, like the Real Housewives. Imagine a reality TV show, like the real housewives TV show. But for Anon Djens who send money into slot, I would watch. At least it would be good as a podcast. Maybe there's nothing to see.
00:17:40.050 - 00:18:30.174, Speaker A: I think we're overthinking this. I have a friend of mine's younger brother who's much younger than me, and this person was lamenting the fact that they didn't ape some pre sale Solana meme coin, and all of his friends did. And all of his friends made like half a million dollars off of a he felt know a fool because he didn't participate. Now all of his young peer friends are suddenly rich, and he's not. And I think the people that are participating in this are basically just like yeeting their savings into these opportunities and hoping for the best. And because they've been working out, book of meme and all of these tokens that have come out of nowhere, I mean, slurf, even people are feeling like it's a positive sum game, when in the long run it's probably not, but in the short term it feels like it.
00:18:30.212 - 00:18:59.000, Speaker C: I think whenever a new meta gets discovered, the move is just exploited as much as possible, and it becomes tired. It's kind of like doing every NFT mint in early 2021, also probably a great idea. Doing every ICO in early 2017, also probably a great idea. And then when it becomes sort of played out and oversaturated and they have to exit. But the question is, just like, when is it a new meta versus a weird one off thing? When is it over? That's always kind of the trick, yeah.
00:18:59.770 - 00:19:48.790, Speaker B: All right, well, let's transition away from the excitement of Solana to the boring old Ethereum, which just shipped the long vaunted upgrade of Ethereum 4844, also known as the Denkoon upgrade, which enabled blob storage. So we talked about a little bit last time on the show. I'm sure most of our listeners fell asleep. Well, it's live now, and l two fees are super low. So now most l two s, I believe the fees are average. Fees are something like one cent to send ETH, and maybe a couple of cents, a few cents to swap. So fees are incredibly low now on l two s, they're sort of not quite salana level of fractions of a, fractions of a cent, but low enough to the point where these things are basically almost as good for most people as using some of the altar ones that had significantly lower fees.
00:19:48.790 - 00:20:30.550, Speaker B: So there's been basically almost all the major roll ups now have adopted Blob storage. There was a lot of speculation that maybe Blob storage was going to be more expensive than originally anticipated, and that, okay, in the very beginning, maybe the first couple of days or the first week, it was going to be relatively low. But it's been about a week now, and it seems like the demand on blob storage is actually fairly limited. And so we are seeing, at least for the moment, even with all these roll ups now using Blob storage. And obviously there are some rollups that are on Celestia and using external DA. But the ones that are using Blob storage or the blob stream of Ethereum, the fees are maintained as being pretty low. So I guess first question to you guys.
00:20:30.550 - 00:20:40.710, Speaker B: One, do you think that these fees for Blob storage persist, or do you think that people are going to find a way to do more stuff on blobs and drive up the fees?
00:20:41.290 - 00:20:49.094, Speaker A: Well, I think eventually people are going to find ways to do more stuff with blobs. Like, people will do things to take up a lot more storage.
00:20:49.142 - 00:20:52.938, Speaker D: There are already blob inscriptions, by the way, that people have made, for instance.
00:20:53.034 - 00:20:53.774, Speaker B: Yeah, I saw that.
00:20:53.812 - 00:21:09.620, Speaker A: Yeah, give it like three weeks. And there's some blob storage video game that just uses a ton of blob. But I think those use cases are slower than the l two s being like, oh, we can put more transactions in, like, hooray. Like, costs go down.
00:21:10.390 - 00:22:09.026, Speaker C: Yeah. I think people kind of kept citing this induced demand LA highway kind of meme where it's this sort of misconception. I think, particularly in LA, that's like if you have a highway that's super congested, you add one new lane and people think that's going to fix traffic. But of course, eventually the market renormalizes and people see that maybe there's reduced traffic for a period of time and then more people drive, and then it kind of gets back to square one. And I think we'll see a little bit of that with blob storage. But it is a little bit of a paradox because even though, yeah, there is induced demand and it will sort of maybe renormalize at some sort of market clearing price, which is probably similar to what it was before, you do have greater throughput, right? Like all those equal, it's better to have more storage for call data because you're just processing more transactions on these l two s than kind of what we had before. Similarly, even if the highway is still the same as slow as it was before, if you have five lanes instead of two lanes, you're technically moving more cars, but you haven't solved traffic.
00:22:09.026 - 00:22:09.990, Speaker C: Quote unquote.
00:22:12.570 - 00:22:19.690, Speaker B: Tarun, as the resident game theory expert, what's your view here? Where are we going with blob storage costs?
00:22:21.070 - 00:23:09.770, Speaker D: I think it's kind of interesting. I mean, one interesting thing you saw was l two teams that were posting. I mean, some of them completely fell over on the upgrade like blast and needed to get a lot of fixes. Some of them optimized how much they were posting over time, because they realized they were over posting like starkware. And then some people took a bit more time to see how the market developed before launching, like Arbitrum, which, you know, I think was probably the kind of most safe approach that we've seen. But I think what people have realized is, like, l two teams have a lot of incentive to optimize how much they're writing. I also think it's a good time to have launch because of how much demand has been taken away via Salana.
00:23:09.770 - 00:23:43.826, Speaker D: It just means that a lot of the kind of very dumb spam transaction type of stuff wasn't there during launch. There really weren't. Imagine if Slurf launched at the same time as 48 44. I guarantee you we would have seen some sort of very dumb thing like, hey, we're using blob storage. Send money to this wallet and it'll buy blobs. And those blobs will be somehow a future token, kind of like the inscriptions. What I mean is people would basically make some inscription like thing and try.
00:23:43.848 - 00:23:46.298, Speaker B: To do BRC 20s on Blob street.
00:23:46.334 - 00:23:54.390, Speaker D: Yeah, exactly. But I think because Salana seems to own that market has completely. At this point, you could arguably.
00:23:54.890 - 00:23:57.862, Speaker B: How would you reify that market? Is that like, stupid things?
00:23:57.916 - 00:24:54.620, Speaker D: Well, I think the meme coin market for new meme coins that are either tokens or promises of future tokens. I think if you look at the L two s, they've all been trying to have these meme coin economies, whether it's avax arbitrum or, I'm trying to think who else actually has been really base a little bit. And just like you look at the volumes, you look at the usage, it's not even coming close to where Solana is, right? Solana is clearly this. Remember when there was Pepe mania? That type of user seems to just completely have, like, I feel like whiff was the moment, like dog whiff hat that all those users were like, actually we're going to move. And it doesn't seem like they're coming back. And I think that's actually good for Ethereum, for launching this because you don't have that type of crazy spam, and you can have this thing grow a little more slowly. But the long term look on it.
00:24:55.470 - 00:25:08.974, Speaker B: I was going to say, I mean, that's kind of true. But if you look at the biggest meme coins, I mean, Shib is right behind dogecoin. Dogecoin is own chain. Shiba inu is on Ethereum. What's next? I think Pepe is next. Let me see here.
00:25:09.092 - 00:25:18.190, Speaker D: Whiff is right below Pepe, though in the peak last few weeks, they're very close. My point though, if you look at the long tail, there's like none like the Ethereum.
00:25:18.270 - 00:25:22.850, Speaker B: The long tail is all. Yeah, floki is on Ethereum. Where's Floki?
00:25:23.190 - 00:25:26.530, Speaker C: I believe so. But these are all the boomer dog coins.
00:25:27.990 - 00:25:29.986, Speaker B: They are the biggest, right? The only one in the.
00:25:30.008 - 00:25:36.086, Speaker D: No, they're the biggest, but they don't have the on chain transaction volume generated by them is not as high right now.
00:25:36.108 - 00:25:36.342, Speaker B: Right.
00:25:36.396 - 00:25:38.226, Speaker D: They have a ton of centralized trading.
00:25:38.418 - 00:25:39.750, Speaker B: I think in aggregate.
00:25:41.390 - 00:26:12.930, Speaker D: I think for the new issuances, I just don't feel like you're seeing like, even on base, right. There were like a ton of these random small meme coins, launched a ton of Armstrong misspelling meme coins, but none of them really got anywhere near the kind of bowden or Trump type of things in terms of the frenzy in terms of usage. So I would say Ethereum's probably lost this market for a while. Maybe it'll come back, maybe not. I'm not sure it's necessarily the market.
00:26:13.000 - 00:26:46.010, Speaker B: You always want to own, but, yeah, that's interesting. I suppose the difference is that although Ethereum does host more market cap of meme coins, it's mostly traded on centralized exchanges. It's not settled on chain, whereas on Solana, the number one place for price discovery of these things and trading is actually on Solana itself. Do you notice that actually, is that literally true, that there's more of this stuff traded on chain for like, wif, that there's more trade on chain than on binance?
00:26:46.090 - 00:26:50.906, Speaker A: It feels true. I bet we could quick check these numbers in like 4 seconds.
00:26:51.098 - 00:26:56.130, Speaker B: Okay, let's check these numbers in 4 seconds. I'm going to look at wiff, I'm going to look at Slurf. I'm going to pull up slurf.
00:26:56.870 - 00:27:04.874, Speaker D: Slurf has got to be on Slurf. Was weird though, because like I said, the listing was like, number one venue is radium.
00:27:05.022 - 00:27:06.226, Speaker B: Number one venue is radium.
00:27:06.258 - 00:27:10.246, Speaker C: For Slurf is graduate. Yeah.
00:27:10.428 - 00:27:11.938, Speaker B: You graduate finance.
00:27:12.114 - 00:27:22.682, Speaker D: Yeah, it does happen, but I think the launching aspect, the ICO like aspect, it does feel like Salana's won that pretty.
00:27:22.816 - 00:27:42.542, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay, so for WiF, radium does 29 million of volume a day. Finance does 320,000,000 of volume a day. So I think for like, once an asset gets out of that very initial critical period, then it does graduate to centralized exchanges, I think pretty much regardless of its.
00:27:42.676 - 00:27:44.558, Speaker D: I'm just saying, if you look at the.
00:27:44.644 - 00:28:04.290, Speaker B: It's like the stuff that was on. What was that website you showed last time that was like pump doom. Pump fund. Pump fund. Yeah, I feel like the pump fund stuff like everything that's sort of in the meme coin carousel of the first 2nd day of birth, that's what is primarily traded on Salana.
00:28:04.370 - 00:28:13.078, Speaker D: I'm just saying that in 2021, when Shib happened, that was on Ethereum. Right. It feels like that has like that entire market has shifted.
00:28:13.094 - 00:28:21.686, Speaker B: No, it is totally. I mean, the new generation of coins, 100% has shifted. And I think the on chain activity for meme coins has definitely shifted to Salana.
00:28:21.798 - 00:28:23.714, Speaker A: It's absolutely has shifted to Salana.
00:28:23.782 - 00:28:41.890, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay. All right, let's move on to Makerdao. So again, we're sort of moving from very exciting to moderately boring and now to extremely boring. So let's talk about Makerdao. So Makerdao, you know it, you love it. It's the biggest decentralized stablecoin been around forever.
00:28:41.890 - 00:29:25.466, Speaker B: Caveat. We're investors in maker MKR tokens since a very long time. So Makerdao has announced that they are going into the end game, and the end game has now been defined much more clearly than previously. I think previously it was kind of a word salad of various things that the rune has been saying that they're going to do, but now it's going to get a lot more definition. So what's going to happen? Supposedly in summer 2024, there's going to be basically rebrandings of a new stable token which will be replacing Dai. You can transfer from Dai into the new stable token. With the new stable token, you'll be able to farm the new governance token and the new governance token.
00:29:25.466 - 00:29:53.078, Speaker B: All these names are obviously TBD. This new governance token you can convert from MKR to the new governance token at 24,000 to one, lower price, more retail friendly. I see where they're going with this. So there's going to be farming DFI mechanics, bazoom. It's very much almost like DFI 2.0 type mechanics that they're kind of throwing into Makerdao. It feels like second more subdows.
00:29:53.078 - 00:30:10.010, Speaker B: There's going to be a new chain. That new chain is going to host new stuff. I don't know, honestly, I don't follow all the stuff here. I should have spent more time reading it. But there's going to be farming. There's going to be a new chain, there's going to be tokens. Everyone is excited.
00:30:10.010 - 00:30:19.070, Speaker B: Maker price is up. I don't know. Reflections on where Makerdao is going with this new endgame.
00:30:19.230 - 00:31:05.274, Speaker C: I feel like Rune was possessed by the ghost of Andre or Sifu. It's kind of like you said, it feels like very non makery and kind of very, oh, these are all the things that kind of more Djen e Defi founders would do, like the rebranding, the unit cost bias production, the new chain, the farming. In some ways it's very exciting because maker has been so boring for so long. But it worries me a little bit because I think part of the boringness is also why Maker has this brand. And I mean, frankly, Dai is still maybe the only decentralized stablecoin that people actually use as a, quote, currency. They actually use it for payments. And I think that's in large part attributable because it is so stable.
00:31:05.274 - 00:31:11.138, Speaker C: And that was part of what people got upset about last week when they were jacking up the rates, which was very out of character for them.
00:31:11.304 - 00:32:04.610, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I think the goal, if I were to phrase it really simply, is maker wants to transform from being dye and the system around it to being a brand that has every type of project all in one place. And I've seen a number of attempts at this over the years where there's like projects like, oh, we're going to do everything. We're going to have lending and amms and a chain and this and that, and they go through the list and they check every single one off and it's like, we're going to do it all. And my biggest concern is that maker turns into a sushi and completely dilutes what originally made Maker special. Now, that being said, obviously everyone's really excited about this because it's like, oh, we go from having one project to having seven projects. Hooray.
00:32:06.410 - 00:33:15.898, Speaker B: Yeah, it does feel like there's definitely an embrace of token mechanics and sort of cryptoification, let's say, of maker. Maker so far has been pretty stayed kind of this sort of August protocol that sits in the wings and never really enters into the popular attention unless it jacks up rates or something. That is what we think of as a scandal in Maker is that, wow, the rates went up too hot, too fast. But, yeah, this seems like Maker very much embracing a kind of new generation of, hey, we're back in a bull market. Like, it's time to start mixing things up and being, it's kind of like when, I don't know, when three M hires a social media guy and they start being subtweeting people and dropping in the comments and roasting other brands, I kind of feel like that's kind of a little bit what maker wants to be and like, look, maybe it's a good idea. I'm not totally sure. I don't have a super strong opinion for this stuff that doesn't seem to really affect the underlying mechanics of maker itself.
00:33:16.064 - 00:33:29.566, Speaker A: Yeah, it is a little bit like that. How do you do fellow kids type meme, where maker is very quickly reinventing itself to go from being a very mature project to being a new project.
00:33:29.748 - 00:33:31.566, Speaker B: Do you think it's net good or net bad?
00:33:31.668 - 00:34:12.954, Speaker A: My hunch? Net bad. Simply because I think if Maker were to put all of its efforts and triple down on the stablecoin dai and the systems around it, I think they have an opportunity to grow. I think they have an opportunity to build something really more special than they already have and it's already special. And so I just don't necessarily immediately appreciate the sort of distraction of do eight things when you have one thing that's almost working and they can triple down on that one thing that's almost at real scale.
00:34:13.082 - 00:34:15.200, Speaker B: Tom, what's your take? Net good, net bad?
00:34:16.770 - 00:34:53.170, Speaker C: I think a mix of both. I think the mean we'll see what they come out with. Hopefully it's not bad or, you know, at face value. I think it seems like a good idea. I actually kind of like what maker has been doing with the product spinouts. So like Oasis, or formerly known as Oasis, is now like summer, which is now actually one of the top defi apps. And same thing with spark reminds me a little bit of kind of like the gnosis model done right of you kind of incubate these products internally and then when they're mature enough, they have to swim on their own, they have to go find their own funding, they have to go find their own sources of revenue.
00:34:53.170 - 00:35:21.780, Speaker C: I think having too much of that stuff in house kind of coddles the projects and they don't feel as much pressure to find PMF. They're can be weird, conflicting incentives of maybe this is not the ideal solution for a DeFi aggregator or for a lending market, but it's really good for makers. We're going to do it anyway and instead having these things have some sort of stake in it, but have it be external, I think ultimately is going to be more beneficial for these things than trying to keep them in house.
00:35:23.190 - 00:35:26.482, Speaker B: Troon what's your take? Make your net good.
00:35:26.616 - 00:36:41.626, Speaker D: I don't have too strong of a take because I haven't actually spent enough time reading the forum posts because sometimes they're very long. And I feel like I wish I really have been meaning to actually go fine tune a simple model on some Dow forum posts so I can just ask stuff for summaries instead of reading through the detritus that is the minds of people in crypto within the minds of people in crypto. And so I find some of the diatribes very hard to distill to simple things, oftentimes because they go on all these kind of crazy tangents and they're really saying, like, we're taking a path from A to B, but instead it takes 10,000 words to say it. And so I've been a little leery for that reason. But it does seem like they're sticking a lot of things into this. I think the spin offs, to Tom's point, are probably like the best version of this. They have so many of them now, actually, like everything from Chronicle, the oracle, Ajna Spark, et find the, I find the kind of crazier side of things too hard to understand, and I try to stay away from that.
00:36:41.626 - 00:37:07.606, Speaker D: But I do think there is a version of this world where the spinoffs are a really good idea, and arguably the subdou concept is meant to make more of these and to make them efficient. Right. Whether that can continue remains to be seen. But, yeah, I feel like, Tom, that's the part that's like the shining light in all of, and maker has already.
00:37:07.628 - 00:37:33.262, Speaker C: Done the subdow transition, I think already that's been pretty beneficial. Instead of just getting this lump sum payment and telling some Dow, hey, go use this for productive purposes, the subdas have to apply for funding individually, and some of them get denied. They say, no, this is too much budget, or, we don't really think you've been effective, you're fired effectively. And so it feels like you're finally applying some market pressure to this part of the market.
00:37:33.396 - 00:38:20.220, Speaker B: I will say one of the upsides to this shake up is, and I know this is something that rune has personally been very oriented around, is there have been a lot of bureaucrats in Makerdao. Like, Makerdo is probably the single most bureaucratic.org in crypto, I would say. And a lot of those bureaucrats are just kind of like locked into this web of just all the stuff going on within Makerdao. And so there is something just kind of healthy about shaking things up and kind of just loosening the cobwebs around everything. And yeah, maybe it could be a bit cringe, maybe some of it's kind of a no op or it just is a kind of temporary excitement. And then when you actually see what gets delivered, it's kind of like, well, this is basically just still make it out just with some fancier gloss over it.
00:38:20.220 - 00:38:48.760, Speaker B: But I think some of that can be useful institutionally. We'll see how it actually plays out. But I can, I mean, right now, with the token price responding, maybe he's not going to get that much pushback on it, and it'll actually be pretty easy to get this through. But you can imagine if the market was responding in a very different way that it actually would be more of a struggle to get some of these things implemented. But right now it's bull market. If token go up, people will mostly get out of the way, is my sense.
00:38:50.010 - 00:38:54.390, Speaker A: Yeah. When one token turns into like seven tokens, people like that.
00:38:54.460 - 00:39:13.840, Speaker B: Always bullish. Always bullish. Yeah. Cool. So speaking of new tokens. So there was a story reported, actually, I think that Robert broke, which is that Blackrock is launching an on chain fund. So still not a lot of details about what this on chain fund is.
00:39:13.840 - 00:39:50.294, Speaker B: And I've heard around the. So again, this is all kind of shrouded in mystery at the moment, but I've heard from around the way that Blackrock is launching some kind of basically tokenized money market fund. And the idea is that, okay, you've got all these schlubs on chain who are holding stablecoins, they're not getting any yield. They should hold a tokenized money market instead. And then they would get yield, but still be dollar pegged, effectively make sure we don't break the buck on the money market. And we're Blackrock, so we should be able to beat all these losers and scale much bigger. So that's what I've heard is what they're doing.
00:39:50.294 - 00:40:00.300, Speaker B: But I don't have any first hand knowledge. This is all kind of around the grapevine. So first of all, anybody else have any finer grained detail?
00:40:00.670 - 00:40:07.902, Speaker C: Well, I have a question for Robert. Do you just get up every morning and read the new reg d filings or how do you find this stuff?
00:40:08.036 - 00:40:09.600, Speaker A: I mean, don't you?
00:40:11.410 - 00:40:15.918, Speaker B: Well, he's reading the reg d filings while he's listening to his Twitter spaces about meme coins.
00:40:16.014 - 00:40:32.040, Speaker A: Correct? Yeah, I like, multitask, like twelve streams of media at all times. No, I mean, it's interesting because I feel like the reg d filings are so much alpha on just like, who's doing what, when and where.
00:40:33.450 - 00:40:37.830, Speaker B: Yeah, of course. Do you actually read regular, regularly?
00:40:43.150 - 00:40:50.006, Speaker A: A lot of journalists read the reg d filings. I'm not a journalist, but a lot of journalists read these on a daily.
00:40:50.038 - 00:40:56.080, Speaker B: Basis because, Robert, how do you have time to do your job? Don't you run multiple companies?
00:40:57.090 - 00:40:58.494, Speaker D: This is actually part of it.
00:40:58.532 - 00:40:59.390, Speaker B: And a fund.
00:40:59.540 - 00:41:08.962, Speaker D: This is how you get diligence on other reg V filings vehicles? Yeah, of course. What are you talking about? That's like the old school hedge fund way.
00:41:09.016 - 00:41:12.340, Speaker B: Yes. That is the very old school.
00:41:13.190 - 00:41:18.770, Speaker D: There are services that just give you alerts for all this stuff, too, so you don't really have to.
00:41:18.920 - 00:41:22.386, Speaker A: Maybe there are services and you just put in some keywords and who knows?
00:41:22.418 - 00:41:30.300, Speaker B: Yeah, I've heard of a few of them. Okay. Wow. Hold on. Okay. Actually, I'm fascinated. I want to go a little bit deeper before you finish the story.
00:41:30.300 - 00:41:40.794, Speaker B: Okay. You wake up in the morning, you kiss your wife, you brew your cup of coffee. Do you just literally open up, Edgar, and just like, read?
00:41:40.832 - 00:41:42.640, Speaker A: No, I don't. No, I have some.
00:41:45.410 - 00:41:51.774, Speaker B: Right. All right. I wasn't sure how much of this is real because Tom seemed very taken aback and I was like, oh, fuck. Okay.
00:41:51.972 - 00:41:54.122, Speaker A: Not my wake up routine.
00:41:54.186 - 00:41:54.510, Speaker B: Okay.
00:41:54.580 - 00:42:33.214, Speaker A: But the reg defiling was interesting because there has been a lot of chatter in the market that there was going to be a fund that Blackrock is doing in partnership with securitize. And it's actually really interesting that the Regd dropped because it's the first definitive proof to a lot of the rumors that there's something happening. They're gearing up. It's exciting. And I'm personally really excited by this. I think seeing huge incumbents getting excited about new product launches on chain, seeing them get excited about tokenization, seeing them get excited about partnerships, seeing them try new things and experimenting. This is great.
00:42:33.214 - 00:43:05.350, Speaker A: This is great for the whole industry. This is great for everyone who's a listener. It's awesome. And so I'm really excited to see what the product looks like when it goes live. I saw there were some people talking about like, oh, we found the token contract and we found the wallet where $100 million was pre funded to it. I'm not sure which of those is accurate, but when the details come out, I think it's going to be really exciting to see what Blackrock is doing on chain because it's a great milestone. It's huge.
00:43:05.350 - 00:43:24.110, Speaker A: It's watching someone that's always been a little bit of a slow mover, embracing the crypto native life. And I think it's going to be inspiring to a lot of other institutions. I think it's going to be inspiring to regulators, I think it's going to be inspiring to investors. And I think people don't appreciate how cool it is.
00:43:24.180 - 00:43:30.830, Speaker B: I'm just waiting for Blackrock to tweet. Yo, send USDC to this address. Two x if you retweet.
00:43:31.970 - 00:43:33.078, Speaker D: Blackrock soul.
00:43:33.114 - 00:43:45.362, Speaker B: Blackrock soul. Okay, it's time. I think we're ready. And then Blackrock is like, sorry, guys, we lost the keys. You ended up burning all your USDC. One day.
00:43:45.416 - 00:43:48.020, Speaker A: One day. They'll become djins in like 30 years.
00:43:49.990 - 00:44:17.050, Speaker B: I can't believe it. Cool. Well, I think, unfortunately, we're up on time. We got to wrap early today, but very interesting. Hopefully by next week we'll have more clarity on this blackrock thing and see what it actually is and what's happening in the wild. Until then, hope your transaction fees go down and your salana meme coins go up very heavily and we'll see you all next weekend.
