00:00:00.330 - 00:00:23.054, Speaker A: It's like restaking, like all the things where everyone is going to be very angry about the rehypothecation. Implied, the sort of like implied leverage. The market always wants that in this industry way more than anything else. And the moment someone offers it even a tiny bit, there'll be like a ton of capital that chases it. I think there's no way back. I bet you we will see every other l two do the same thing. It's just like unfortunate in some ways.
00:00:23.054 - 00:00:31.686, Speaker A: There will be some extra systemic risk, unfortunately. But the point is, there's no way everyone doesn't copy it.
00:00:31.708 - 00:00:53.610, Speaker B: I think this is way too strong of a claim. These are airdrop farmers. Everyone here is literally, they're not using the product. There's no product. So if they launch the l two, and the l two gets developers and applications, then yes, maybe there's a ghost of an argument there, but this is like the airdrop to end all airdrops. That's why people are here. And every marginal dollar that gets know right now there's a futures market for blast on AvO.
00:00:53.610 - 00:00:56.970, Speaker B: Very, very low liquidity, but it's being priced at like north of a billion FTV.
