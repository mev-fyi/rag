00:00:02.970 - 00:00:22.346, Speaker A: Hello, everybody. Welcome to the chopping block. Every couple weeks, the four of us get together and give the industry insiders perspective on the crypto topics of the day. So quick intros. First we've got Tom, the DeFi maven and master of Memes. Next up we've got Tarun Gigabrain and Grand Poobot Gauntlet. We'll have joining us about halfway through, Robert, the cryptoconnosur and Captain of Compound.
00:00:22.346 - 00:00:46.262, Speaker A: He's in the middle of something, but he'll be joining us. And then we myself haseeb I'm the head Hype man of Dragonfly, and today, subbing in for Robert because Robert couldn't make it during the first half of the show. We've got Laura, the CEO of the show, as I know she loves to be introduced. Quick caveat. The four of us are early stage investors in crypto. But I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice or legal advice three. Or even life advice.
00:00:46.262 - 00:01:00.426, Speaker A: Three. The three of us. The three of us. Laura is not an investor, as she often likes to remind us. She is a journalist, according to herself. So according to yourself, you're in Majorca right now. We're doing majorca.
00:01:00.538 - 00:01:42.862, Speaker B: I know, and please excuse me, because, you guys, there's like, all kinds of pandemonium happening here. But yeah, I caught COVID and so I could not fly back to the US today like I had originally planned. I'm not very sick, which is good, frankly. Just going to enjoy a little bit of extra beach time. I'll have to work this week, but at least I'll be doing it in this really cute beach town. Yeah, I feel like it's sort of like a blessing from the universe. I just get this little extra time because ever since my book came out, I have been busier than ever before.
00:01:42.862 - 00:01:48.778, Speaker B: I think I mentioned this when I came on before, so, yeah, kind of nice for me, frankly.
00:01:48.954 - 00:01:51.278, Speaker A: I hope it's pretty mild. Is it?
00:01:51.444 - 00:02:02.306, Speaker B: Yeah, it is. I had, like, aches the other night and then I just slept 12 hours that night and then woke up and I basically just have a cold now and that's it.
00:02:02.488 - 00:02:08.680, Speaker A: Okay, well, I'm glad it's not too bad, but your voice sounds kind of raspy, which actually works well for you. I feel like it's actually pretty cool.
00:02:10.970 - 00:02:16.002, Speaker B: Okay. It's probably also because it's so late here, it's after midnight.
00:02:16.146 - 00:03:16.634, Speaker A: Yeah, it probably hour to start talking about it's been we actually had some comments in Twitter people telling us, why are you still talking about Luna? But unfortunately, they do it to us. They force us to do this. So for those, of course, last episode we talked about the collapse of Luna with Kevin Jo, and we sort of did a bit of a play by play of exactly how UST ended up collapsing. So in the interim, a lot has happened that I think we should probably discuss since it's kind of the defining event of this month. So there was a proposal that was passed that Doe suggested called the terra ecosystem revival plan. And the idea is that they are going to launch a new blockchain called just called Luna or called Terra. A lot of people are calling it terra two, luna Two, but on CoinMarketCap it'll just be called Luna from now on.
00:03:16.634 - 00:03:59.682, Speaker A: And this is the basically regenesis, it's the second birth of terra and there's going to be a big AirDrop to, sorry, I should say there was a big AirDrop to previous holders of Luna, as well as some of the people who kind of got wrecked through different parts of the ecosystem. Some of the AirDrop went to also staking derivatives. So people who had exposure to Luna, even if they weren't holding Luna directly. But there have been a number of issues. There were a lot of complaints about the governance process. There was a lot of complaints about the AirDrop being miscalculated, that the Terra Foundation had to go back and kind of issue some Maya culpas about the AirDrop having numerous issues where people who were supposed to get some didn't end up getting some, and so on and so forth. But the big thing is that it has mostly succeeded.
00:03:59.682 - 00:04:08.010, Speaker A: I believe the fully diluted market cap of the new Luna, luna 2.0, is something, it's like 6 billion last time I saw.
00:04:08.080 - 00:04:11.414, Speaker C: I think it's like 8 billion now. It's been moving up. Yeah.
00:04:11.552 - 00:04:44.390, Speaker A: So it's been gaining some momentum. So obviously it's a far cry from what it was before. Previously its FTV was very high, I think like 40 billion or so. But now it's a respectable showing. And there's a number of projects in the ecosystem, most of which were spun out of the TerraForm labs, which is the company behind Luna, are involved in building on top of Terra Two. But we've also seen a big migration. Many of the projects that were building on Terra Two or sorry, that were building on Terra originally did not decide to stick around for Terra Two.
00:04:44.390 - 00:05:34.882, Speaker A: And so many of them are shopping around for a new home. So, as Tarun, you were mentioning last time, a lot of the other foundations, whether they be the Solana Foundation or Avalanche or Polkadot, they're having engaged conversations with some of the new migrants from Luna. And so it seems like this thing surprisingly has gone off reasonably well, although there's always been some mistakes going on in that transition. The big thing that I've been hearing, chatting with some of the folks from the Terra ecosystem is that it seems like terra is doing everything they can to try to sabotage the old chain. So the old chain is now called Luna Classic. And there have been all sorts of issues with Luna Classic as the community has migrated away from the original Luna onto Luna Two. And so some of the things that we've seen, and I'll just be really brief because there's a lot of detail in some of these stories.
00:05:34.882 - 00:05:59.022, Speaker A: So first that Mirror Protocol suffered a massive exploit related to their oracle that ended up draining a significant amount of capital and is likely to drain more. There was also apparently a $90 million DFI exploit that was also on Mirror that was unnoticed for months that has only now recently been uncovered by a gentleman by the name of Fat Man, which is a great name, I guess.
00:05:59.156 - 00:05:59.774, Speaker D: Fat man.
00:05:59.812 - 00:06:45.562, Speaker A: Terra fat Manterra. There you go. And yeah, apparently this bug was fixed quietly by the team behind Mirror, but there was no acknowledgement of this actual bug until Fat Man was able to uncover it and describe it on Twitter. But broadly speaking, I've been hearing a lot of antagonism toward Luna Classic where the Luna team or foundation has been trying to, as much as they can, try to decommission things that are on Luna Classic and push all activity toward Terra Two. So it's been an interesting couple of weeks to see the machinations of this migration to Terra Two. What have you guys been seeing, what have you heard? And what do you think about this new regenesis of Terra?
00:06:45.706 - 00:07:28.534, Speaker C: Yeah, it's interesting to see how quickly people are willing to get this thing going again. Like, if you look at the Terra Twitter feed, it's all about all the new exchanges that are listing Terra Two, Terra Two perps, like all these kinds of things. I think one of the interesting things about this in my mind was unlike a lot of, I guess, forks that we see of L1s, like an Ethereum Classic type situation, the state was not preserved. It was like a full regenesis. And so you don't get all the old applications from Terra. Not that again. They would make sense, as Tarun pointed out, without UST most of the time, but it's know, really trying to start from scratch, like get people to redeploy versus like, oh, we still have the old uniswap clone that you love and it's just on this new blockchain.
00:07:28.534 - 00:08:01.526, Speaker C: Instead, you have to point your wallet over to this new thing. So I'd be curious to see if they can win people over or get some new stuff. I saw they had like a Phoenix decks thing which is supposed to be Rebirth, so it's kind of know, trying to get people over on Luna. But yeah, I'm not really sure. I did see one also funny thing on Twitter, which, know, it's called Luna Rebirth, but there's a very famous Trader Gigantic Rebirth, which bet very heavily against Luna. So it's like this kind of weird, kind of funny, I don't know, coincidence, but yeah, I'll be curious to see if they can actually rebuild a meaningful state from sort of scratch again.
00:08:01.628 - 00:08:40.354, Speaker A: I mean, it's weird because it's now a redefinition of Luna as just being a pure smart contract platform because of course the UST component of Luna is gone. They're not reconstituting that, at least not right now. So it's Terra as a competitor to ethereum, solana, avalanche, polygon, and to me it's not really obvious where they're going to get marginal demand from. So sure they're going to be able to have some of the folks who decided not to migrate away continue building on Terra, but where are new people going to come in? Like, what's their edge, what's their story? Other than that we're around and we have some TVL, so that seems a bit of mystery to me.
00:08:40.552 - 00:09:14.382, Speaker B: Yeah, everything I've read is just like, oh, it's the same chain minus UST. Which of course that's pretty much what the old chain was entirely about. And I haven't read anything saying know, in all the competition in this space here's, what sets this new chain apart. Granted, I also have been traveling like crazy, so it's not like I've been falling super closely. But it was something that I was wondering. It was like, this is a very crowded space, so how are you differentiating yourself? And I haven't seen anything like that. The other thing is that I was surprised by how quickly Doe Kwan began posting again.
00:09:14.382 - 00:09:50.940, Speaker B: I know multiple people have been talking about this, but I guess I kind of expected he might be a bit more humble, but I clearly was wrong. I think other people on Twitter were frankly surprised by that. And in general, I guess they sort of felt that maybe there would be some kind of effort to make it seem more decentralized or less reliant on certain individuals in that community. So those were all certain things that just kind of surprised me.
00:09:51.710 - 00:10:21.998, Speaker A: I definitely agree with that. It kind of feels like, look at this the, this is the hail Mary to try to make whole the folks who lost a lot of money in the UST. Debacle. And so it has to go right. And this is also the only chance at a redemption arc in a sense, is for them to kind of make this thing work. So I understand why from DOE's perspective, he has to go all in here. He can't hedge his bets, he can't be cutesy about it, he has to go aggressive.
00:10:21.998 - 00:10:58.666, Speaker A: So I think that feels sensible to me. But of know what I've heard from some folks who were building in the Terra ecosystem, that TfL is giving out grants to folks who are in the Terra ecosystem to stay in and not to go shopping around to other chains. Now of course the TfL doesn't have the resources it once had. So it's hard to be competitive with a avalanche or a salana or a near if your entire ecosystem just blew up. But they're competing on level ground. They're trying to do the exact same playbook they were before with respect to layer one competition.
00:10:58.858 - 00:11:31.062, Speaker B: Yeah, and I know that Delphi has a different role here, but I felt that their Tweets were being more measured and saying know, we can't necessarily say we endorse this. I forget the language they used. And granted, like I said, I know that they have a different role from Doe. So you're right. Maybe he just has to keep that sort of upbeat. Like, I believe in this, I'm going to build this kind of attitude. But Delphi's stance definitely seemed more measured and reasonable given everything that had happened.
00:11:31.196 - 00:11:54.530, Speaker C: I did think it was interesting in the blog post. They really try to position it as like, community owned terra. There was no explicit carve out for TfL in the regenesis, and obviously they own a bunch of Luna. They own a bunch of UST. And so they implicitly got an AirDrop, but it wasn't like, oh, the TfL is going to get a bunch of Luna and then everybody else gets an AirDrop. It was a true sort of fair launch, even distribution, quote unquote.
00:11:56.070 - 00:12:51.570, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, I think the hard part for someone like Delphi, right, is like, Delphi Labs was probably the biggest grant recipient from TfL, effectively, right? They built Mars. They built Astroport. They had like pretty much, I'd say, I think Labs in particular, I think Delphi wrote a blog post about how basically labs took 99% of the losses for them. And I think it's very hard to convince these teams, who you've convinced to moor their ship to your dock for two years that suddenly have had everyone lose everything all at once, suddenly continue to stay. And we've already seen. So, like, for Delphi, basically, I think Mars said they're moving to Osmosis. Astroport unclear, but they didn't deploy on Start.
00:12:51.570 - 00:13:14.086, Speaker D: Like a bunch of people had to deploy forks. It's actually an interesting opportunity for someone who wants to make a quick buck of just redeploying all these terror protocols that basically were like, hey, we're not going to go back because the UST. State is too valuable to our protocol, that it doesn't make sense to redeploy.
00:13:14.118 - 00:13:14.266, Speaker A: Right.
00:13:14.288 - 00:14:13.130, Speaker D: To Astroport, like, every single pool was like 18 month UST locked. So I think that there is sort of an interesting dynamic going on there. I think that also the overtures made by pretty much every other chain to Luna developers and Luna teams will, I suspect, be extremely successful. Now, the biggest question is how the cosmos ecosystem, I guess, can rebound from this, because in a lot of ways they really, really tied their ship to UST. Part of it was ideological, right? So if you talk to kind of the OG cosmos people who are not Jay so Ethan or Zaki, obviously the two, Kwan and Jquan both will forever live in Twitter infamy. But it's a tale of two, I think. I think there's sort of this interesting thing when you ask more on the people on the development side who are kind of still involved.
00:14:13.130 - 00:15:20.078, Speaker D: Sonny, Zaki and Ethan, they were all sort of no matter what, even if they were all like, hey, Luna is still unstable. They still kind of had to keep supporting it because it was literally the only driver of growth for the ecosystem. And then it did work for six months, right? It did really surpass in a lot of metrics from everywhere else. So I think replacing that is going to be quite hard, especially for the average degen type user who's going to be like, oh, well, this Cosmos thing blew up last time. Why would I put my money back in this again? And I think that there's this interesting consumer protection angle that, hey, we're not going to let USDC come on Cosmos or we're not going to make overturst a circle to have USDC deployed on Cosmos, which is effectively why it's the only one that has no native USDC. I mean, I think now they're trying to rectify that and they kind of were like, we only want this free money that doesn't have any tethering to the existing financial system. And that was sort of one of their core values.
00:15:20.078 - 00:15:29.862, Speaker D: So I think it's going to be interesting to see how they redeem from that Agoric, even though they've been taking the slow approach to building it. They actually have a really cool system.
00:15:29.996 - 00:15:34.614, Speaker A: But with Kava USD, aren't they also?
00:15:34.812 - 00:16:14.820, Speaker D: I think the Kava hack, the fact that Kava set their Oracle for USDX to UST equal one was not was it? Was not. No, it's not nail in the like I think they still have a chance, for sure. I do think that the problem is, again, there's this consumer protection angle. Like, if people lost money in minting USDX because of the fact that the Oracle was mispriced and they got liquidated anyway, are people going to come back? Yes, people do come back in crypto, right? We know that people love taking infinite pain. I think this is a level of pain that we haven't ever seen obliterated all at once.
00:16:15.450 - 00:17:26.394, Speaker A: Yeah, no, you make a great point, which is that beyond just the facts of exactly what happened in the Terra collapse, there's a kind of stank now that's hard to erase from Terra Two. And I think that's one of the reasons why it's going to be very difficult for them to attract new entrepreneurs and new developers to build on top of them. You may be able to retain some of the old community, but then it's a real question of, like, what is a community worth? How many of these people will actually be able to bring in new retail and new entrepreneurs and new builders? Because ultimately that's what layer One blockchains are about. They're about taking a shot at building the future platform that users down the road are going to care about, not just the people who are here today are going to care about. And then the other question is that how much of that stank rubs off on Cosmos? Now, I tend to think that in the long run it won't be that much just because of the fact that most users don't really know. If you're very technical, then yes, you'll have some understanding of like, okay, UST was built on top of Cosmos decay and then Osmosis had a lot of exposure to it and blah, blah, blah, and they all made these decisions that ended up looking bad in hindsight. But I think most users are not thinking that way.
00:17:26.394 - 00:17:48.818, Speaker A: And if, for example, I'm trying to come up with a tortured analogy, but if there was some company that attached itself to MySpace and then MySpace imploded, most people aren't going to draw. If you're living in the valley and you're thinking about the chess game of startups, then you might think like, oh man, these guys who attach themselves to MySpace, what idiots like they'll never be.
00:17:48.824 - 00:17:50.354, Speaker D: Able to call out of think most.
00:17:50.392 - 00:17:51.346, Speaker A: Users have no idea.
00:17:51.448 - 00:17:57.142, Speaker D: I think one difference between crypto and MySpace is that the wallets are very branded to the chains you're using.
00:17:57.196 - 00:17:57.462, Speaker A: Right.
00:17:57.516 - 00:18:41.246, Speaker D: And so in Cosmos'case, the interesting thing for the rest of the Cosmos ecosystem is probably the best M A deal in the history of crypto was Osmosis buying Kepler and then kind of like really vertically integrating and probably building the best wallet ever. I will stand by the falling swimming. Kepler is a better wallet than Phantom and MetaMask by a long shot. I just think it has figured out the cross chain UX perfectly compared to the other ones are like, you have to sign 50 million transactions. They don't hide all the call data. My mom's a relatively technical user who uses MetaMask, but she has had trouble basically bridging. And so I just generally think I don't think she can use Kepler.
00:18:41.246 - 00:19:09.558, Speaker D: She had definitely a lot of trouble using MetaMask to use optimism, for instance. So I would say that Kepler, I think, is really hit it out of the park. And the most important thing for Cosmos is that the Terra wallet, even though it was sort of a very widely used wallet, is not the most used Cosmos wallet anymore. Like Kepler really took over. And so I think that in and of itself is a little bit of a saving grace.
00:19:09.734 - 00:19:13.546, Speaker A: Right. Because Kepler is not branded luna or right, right.
00:19:13.648 - 00:19:47.662, Speaker D: And that was all a sort of interesting thing because terra had the first big Cosmos wallet, actually one of the first big Cosmos wallets. And so most people would see it branded as terra and associated with, you know, my point is you could have had something where the Terra wallet was the most used Cosmos wallet and almost every other Cosmos app was used through the Terra wallet. That would be horrible for, you know, does that make sense? There's a different brand risk here with the wallet to chain connection that I think from a consumer standpoint does sully.
00:19:47.746 - 00:20:41.930, Speaker B: Brand image yeah, actually, Tarun, because of your comments before, about how you felt that Osmosis and Kepler had the best UX. I did have Sonny on the show with the one that actually came out today. We actually recorded it before the whole Terra implosion. I obviously had to switch up the schedule to include all that. So this is coming out a bit later. But the point is that he was saying on the show that he felt that having UST in that ecosystem made it hard for other applications to compete because they couldn't use natural yield because there was this element in the ecosystem that had this artificial inflated yield. So I actually wonder if now, in a way, this might help the Cosmos ecosystem more, because then there won't be this kind of weird element that's sort of, like, causing kind of weird market dynamics for some of the other apps that are trying to compete in that ecosystem.
00:20:41.930 - 00:20:47.738, Speaker B: So who knows? And frankly, the fact that it happened this early probably better for the ecosystem as well.
00:20:47.904 - 00:21:17.810, Speaker A: Yeah. Yes or no? I mean, obviously the Fed does the same thing with the federal funds rate. So if the Fed raises the federal funds rate to like 5%, then that affects all sorts of private actors in the markets who might otherwise have a lower rate of return on what they're doing. So it's true in the real world too, although we've been in a low interest rate environment for a very long time, it seems like we might be exiting that. But it's certainly true that what you do in monetary policy at the base chain affects people upstream. It has to. But that's kind of the point now.
00:21:17.810 - 00:21:26.066, Speaker A: If you set monetary policy badly, you create all sorts of weird effects, which is exactly what was happening in the Terra ecosystem, was weird effects that ended.
00:21:26.098 - 00:22:14.760, Speaker D: Up causing this one weird kind of analogy of anchor. Plus, Terra is sort of like imagine if the central bank also was a commercial bank that took deposits and now had this incentive to create the oroboros because they were like, not on one side handing the deposits, on the other side, controlling the sort of rates for the deposits. And this has happened in a bunch of countries and it hasn't worked out. Weimar Germany is a great example of when the central bank started opening retail banks. This is, in fact, why in Germany, until very recently, the post office was like the biggest bank in the country. The Dutch post bank was really yeah, it used to be the highest deposits in Germany. So there's been some remnants of this type of stuff.
00:22:14.760 - 00:22:40.734, Speaker D: So from the consumer side, I think there's a lot of lessons to think about how wallets and protocols are associated. And this will be a good lesson to us of whether there's this affinity that's different than, say, the MySpace thing. Because if the wallet was really branded to that chain, then people start thinking like, oh, this chain is bad versus oh, this app was bad.
00:22:40.852 - 00:23:16.566, Speaker A: Well so speaking of learning lessons, the other thing that's happened as a result of the Terra fallout is we are seeing prosecutors starting to sniff around. So there was a report that Korean prosecutors are now summoning the employees of TerraForm Labs, the company that is behind the creation of Terra and asking them a bunch of questions about their involvement. I've heard that there's also a probe going around in the US. As well, although the details are still a bit hazy. So unsurprising that when you see a situation like this head's got a roll. Like this thing was global news. It was a cover of the Wall Street Journal.
00:23:16.566 - 00:24:13.162, Speaker A: It was just massive, massive story. It's now to the point when I talk to LPs, every single LP asks me about Terra and it's the one thing that everybody knows to talk about. Same way, like last summer the one thing everyone knew to talk about was Solana. This summer the thing everyone knows to talk about is Terra. Why did it collapse and what does it mean for the industry? And it's got me thinking a lot. And I'm curious to get your guys take on this. Know, we touched last time very briefly with Kevin on the idea of was Terra a fraud or I should say was USD a fraud? Because one of the questions I get all the time from LPs and I think this is often the way in which it's framed in the press is that Terra was like therados and there are all these comparisons to consumer protection, investor protection of like how can we create more disclosures? How can we stop this kind of malfeasance from ever happening again? And Tom, you made the point last time that everything about Terra was actually out in the open.
00:24:13.162 - 00:24:30.162, Speaker A: Everything was totally transparent, right? The deposits on Anchor, the yield, where the yield was coming, know, raising money into the LFG, the funds they were using to protect the thing, how the mechanism worked. Everything was out in the open. It was all in smart contracts. It was all on the website. Everyone knew this. Not everyone. Obviously there are many people who aren't sophisticated enough to understand it.
00:24:30.162 - 00:24:45.830, Speaker A: But all this was out in the open. The question is, should naturally there's going to be an attempt to try to punish the people who were involved in the creation and the promulgation of UST? Do you guys think that is good or bad?
00:24:45.980 - 00:25:29.758, Speaker C: We were talking about this a little bit in one of our team meetings too around this being also maybe reminiscent of GFC and not wanting to criminalize failure. That also just creates this massive chilling effect on the industry. And I think, as I sort of said earlier, this was super transparent. No one really lied, no one made misrepresentations around what this stuff does. I think externally, outside of Terra, there was a story actually about stable gains, which was like this YZ backed startup which is basically a front end for anchor. People were wiring in dollars initially. They were converting to USDC, and then eventually stable gains converted those to UST to get more yield to skim off and then sort of collapsed on the back end.
00:25:29.758 - 00:26:17.702, Speaker C: I think stuff like that where they actually went through and they changed the terms of service. They tried to obfuscate this from people. There might be fraud there, but I think in terms of the actual protocol TfL, it was all pretty transparent. I think also some investors obviously I think maybe misrepresented or overplayed how safe this was and downplayed some of the risks, but it's hard to say that anybody lied or anybody totally obscured what was actually going on on the back end. I think maybe only the thing I would point out is around the reserves, we still don't have a ton of clarity into how the reserves were used to defend the peg. Not that I even know that makes a material difference in terms of the outcome for UST or for Luna. But that does feel like maybe the worst part of the story is just with $4 billion in crypto, so went poof and we don't really know what happened to it.
00:26:17.836 - 00:27:08.146, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean the story of crypto has always been that people try to solve insanely hard problems and they mostly fail until someone succeeds, right? There were however, many attempts to create decentralized money before Bitcoin succeeded. And the same thing, there were many attempts to create kind of generalized computing platforms before Ethereum succeeded. And there will be many more attempts to create decentralized stablecoins that don't require the backing of real USD. And they will continue. There will be more attempts to do this because it is one of the Holy grails of crypto. But it may continue under a very different pretense if the idea is that if you fail, you get punished and we will throw the book at you and find every possible way to make your failure even more discouraging to the folks who will come after you.
00:27:08.248 - 00:27:55.374, Speaker D: I'm not going to be popular with the other people in this chat for saying this, but I think investors should be allowed to be sued for this to some extent. There is a sense in which in the theranos case, you could argue that there was information withheld that caused this sort of consumer harm if consumer harm is the basis of your legal system's form of punishment. But I would argue here that there's an ecosystem of that in some case. In this scenario that happened especially, I would say to some extent more the traders and the venture investors, the trading firms that started becoming venture investors quickly. I do think there was certainly some of them were misrepresenting things quite dramatically.
00:27:55.422 - 00:27:57.030, Speaker A: Anybody you'd like to call out? Tarun?
00:27:57.690 - 00:28:05.954, Speaker D: No, I don't think there's anyone I would want to. Directly say, but there definitely were people who were very some unnamed trading firms.
00:28:06.002 - 00:28:07.554, Speaker A: Who were very involved.
00:28:07.682 - 00:28:13.434, Speaker B: A couple of names came to mind based on the no, I'm not trying.
00:28:13.552 - 00:28:32.110, Speaker D: To basically know the ones who are subpoenaed, because I think there were more in Asia that were really described. I would say in Korea and Singapore, there were just a lot of people, a lot of funds that were just yeah, like, you know, pushing these kind of front end products.
00:28:32.260 - 00:28:41.742, Speaker A: The way that I have described it, LPs, is that the reality was Luna was more WeWork than it was theranos it was a dramatic failure.
00:28:41.806 - 00:28:45.954, Speaker D: But those are the only two examples of fraud that we can come up with.
00:28:46.152 - 00:28:49.894, Speaker A: WeWork wasn't an example of fraud. It was an example of incompetence what.
00:28:49.932 - 00:29:02.154, Speaker D: Investors would be like. Well, you could argue that the LPs would say that, hey, that's like Masa being incompetent, which is in their mind equivalent to the theraness thing.
00:29:02.272 - 00:29:36.530, Speaker B: No, but I agree with Haseeb. The sin here was hubris and definitely WeWork and Terra fit that much more. I don't agree. That was was a kind of theranos and I think like fraud is really difficult to prove and so maybe an investigation would turn something up. I have never looked into Know. The bar for that is pretty high. And given all of Kwan's swagger on Twitter, I would be super surprised if he actually internally kind of knew or was convinced that Terra would collapse.
00:29:36.530 - 00:30:00.006, Speaker B: Just from the way he spoke, it seemed like he was fully convinced that he had made it. He was like a gazillionaire and was set for life and this was his baby and his big success. That's how he seemed. So I would be super surprised if behind the scenes he was like, oh, this is never going to work. And I would just be surprised.
00:30:00.118 - 00:30:12.106, Speaker D: One thing from the financial crisis is a lot of the people who are kind of like high swagger apples were the only ones who are convicted or actually had legal trouble because they were just easy targets for regulators.
00:30:12.138 - 00:30:14.570, Speaker A: Yeah. If you're unsympathetic yeah, you're going to.
00:30:14.580 - 00:30:31.058, Speaker D: Get the I think don't underestimate in financial crime how much of the fraud case does sometimes revolve around who can be made an example of the most easily? And were they an asshole in a clear way that it's easy to convince a jury?
00:30:31.154 - 00:30:42.646, Speaker B: Yeah, but I just don't know then excuse me if the charge would be fraud itself, because if he was fully convinced it would succeed, then how is it a fraud? So that's why I agree with Haseeb.
00:30:42.678 - 00:30:43.066, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:30:43.168 - 00:31:34.602, Speaker D: I agree that there's a sense in which this was not really a fraud in the traditional sense. It was just more for the protocol itself. Right, the protocol itself. In some senses it worked correctly. But I would just argue that financial law, the way it gets enforced, at least in the US, is quite weird and people all the time can get the Shrelli case is a great example, a case where someone effectively actually made their investors money. So from the perspective of exactly how he got in trouble, it was sort of this very weird case to turn it into a sort of mix of consumer harm and fraud. And obviously him being an asshole made it very easy to construct this kind of roundabout case.
00:31:34.602 - 00:31:49.374, Speaker D: So I wouldn't be surprised if we see a lot of that where it's not fraud, but the trial gets represented in the media as fraud, and most people will just think it's that, even if technically it was like this very obtuse thing.
00:31:49.572 - 00:32:31.754, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's very likely, is that it probably won't be the big charge that you really want, but there's a feeling that something must be done. It's like, don't just stand there, do something for any kind of prosecutor in this environment. So we'll see something, and I think there's a good chance that it ends up becoming untenable to pendant with a really big charge. And so it's like, oh, you lied about this one really specific thing that we're going to nail you on, and it's going to be like some slap on the wrist, but it ends up wasting everyone's time and attention. That would be my guess. But it's more about sending a message, right? And feeling like, hey, crypto is not this lawless place where consumers lose a lot of money. We feel like we did something and the consumers feel like something was done.
00:32:31.754 - 00:32:35.786, Speaker A: And so therefore, we can all kind of agree to move on collectively.
00:32:35.978 - 00:32:58.578, Speaker B: And is that what you think it would be? Because before the SEC was trying to go after Doe Kwan because of, I guess, synthetic assets in, you know, they don't have jurisdiction, I guess because he's not a US citizen. In this case, it would be like some kind of consumer do you know what the charge would be or have you seen any commentary?
00:32:58.754 - 00:33:13.482, Speaker A: I don't know. My guess is that prosecutors are trying to figure out what can we possibly charge on this thing? I don't know what crime is involved here, but I'm sure there's something in one of these books that we can accuse them of.
00:33:13.616 - 00:33:26.558, Speaker D: Also, not to make a hard pivot, but we did bring up WeWork, and I hear that Adam Newman is back in crypto. And by back by back, I mean started I'm not sure what back in.
00:33:26.564 - 00:33:28.350, Speaker C: Front back in the startup game. Yeah.
00:33:28.420 - 00:33:39.858, Speaker A: Yes. So we heard a story that Adam Newman raised 70 million from A 16 Z for some kind of carbon credits on the blockchain, something, I don't know. Does anyone have color on this one?
00:33:40.024 - 00:33:48.340, Speaker D: I tried reading the A 16 Z memo, and it was mainly a personal story about carbon. I was like, Wait, I don't understand what this company does.
00:33:49.290 - 00:33:55.414, Speaker A: This sounds like what happened last time is that the announcement of why we're investing was a personal story?
00:33:55.612 - 00:34:01.660, Speaker D: I think personal stories justifying investments in things that are difficult. Makes a lot of sense sometimes.
00:34:02.030 - 00:34:02.874, Speaker A: Sure.
00:34:03.072 - 00:34:29.090, Speaker D: But I do think it was very unclear. I also heard this rumor from a friend of mine who said the same team, minus the Newman's were pitching the idea, like, four months ago, five months ago, and didn't say they were involved or something. And then something changed. I don't know what happened in the last four months, but it sounds like this team has been hustling on this idea for a while, and then they got a little star power to help out.
00:34:29.240 - 00:34:30.034, Speaker A: I see.
00:34:30.152 - 00:34:40.370, Speaker B: Okay, wait, so meaning they weren't, like, hiding their involvement and then suddenly decided not to, but actually they brought them on board to help them get investment?
00:34:40.970 - 00:34:49.660, Speaker D: I suspect it's the latter. Not the former. I saw the screenshots of this old deck that show the team without everyone except them.
00:34:50.110 - 00:34:57.750, Speaker B: That's amazing that having Adam Newman involved would somehow lead to investment. Okay. Anyway, I'm clearly not a VC.
00:34:57.830 - 00:35:00.970, Speaker A: You do not understand investors, if that's confusing to you.
00:35:01.120 - 00:35:06.686, Speaker B: Yeah, it really doesn't. Like, biggest failure of all. But anyway okay, whatever.
00:35:06.788 - 00:35:09.150, Speaker D: I don't know if it was that bad. If you think about it.
00:35:09.220 - 00:35:12.398, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, it's still like a several billion dollar company.
00:35:12.564 - 00:35:18.654, Speaker D: It's not theranos right it's closer to Uber at this point than I think.
00:35:18.692 - 00:35:27.266, Speaker A: Yeah, true. And you're 100% right. I mean, clearly Adam Newman is a bit of a nut job, but yeah, he built a really fantastic company. Like, I mean, you go around, you'll see WeWorks all over the place.
00:35:27.448 - 00:35:32.070, Speaker D: I've used a WeWork in the last two weeks. Sorry about the barking.
00:35:32.410 - 00:36:11.006, Speaker A: No worries. Okay, Tarun, before you have to run because I know you have to hop off early, this one, I felt like you would be able to give some good color. So CFTC held a roundtable on FTX us making a proposal for a new approach to clearing the settlement of trades. So the idea from FTX is, you know, all you guys who separate out your clearinghouse and your custody and exchange all into separate entities. That's the way it's done in the traditional financial system. That's kind of dumb. What about the idea that we verticalize everything and one party does all of them? And this was a big pitch to the CFTC.
00:36:11.006 - 00:36:40.490, Speaker A: CME was at the table. CME is a Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which is one of the largest exchanges in the world. And the CME basically started yelling at FTX, calling it ridiculous and claiming that they were going to take advantage of consumers who didn't understand what was going on. And so there was a bit of a back and forth and some roasting that was going in both directions between FTX and CME. Tarun, you're a lot closer to this from your TradFi days. What are your thoughts on this whole drama.
00:36:41.570 - 00:37:21.734, Speaker D: I just generally think I get what FTX wants to do. Obviously from a technology standpoint, clearly makes a ton of sense. I think the boomers though, who are in charge are just generally against 24 hours trading. Like FX has 24 hours trading minus some tiny blips. And the FX market has had a lot of weird behavior. FX is also just like a very bizarre market, right? Because it's like there's only certain primary dealers who do half of the market, maybe more of the market trades per. So like what I mean by that is, let's suppose I'm Microsoft.
00:37:21.734 - 00:38:26.650, Speaker D: I have Microsoft subsidiary in Europe, and every day for tax reasons, I need to get my revenue outside of the US into Ireland, right? So I need to sell dollars, buy Euros, ship it over, and in the process of doing that, I have to be like, hey, I need to sell a yard or a billion dollars. Basically you're like, okay, who wants to handle this? And there's usually only like four or five banks that will do it. So you go to the banks, they do this trade. There was a whole scandal of this post financial crisis about how all these banks would collude and they would tell each other like, hey look, Morgan Stanley would say Microsoft is giving me a billion, goldman would say, Facebook giving me a billion. And they'd be like, okay, let's agree that we're going to charge them at least this much. So as a fee, the Goldman guy in London is the one who went to jail for Tom something. So anyway, FX has this weird thing where because there's not really a jurisdiction that guides the security, like the European leg and the US leg might differ on what they consider insider trading, for instance.
00:38:26.650 - 00:39:10.690, Speaker D: Actually they do, and so you get all sorts of very weird stuff, but it is technically the only 24 hours market. And a lot of the weird stuff there, you can argue that if it was actually done on chain, for instance, that you wouldn't have that. There's just like a single consistent law. But I don't think I've ever talked to people who are as averse to using technology and still use blackberries as a lot of the people involved. So like, I just feel like it's a hard uphill battle. Sam's not exactly a sympathetic character, I think to a lot of them for a variety of reasons, probably mainly Alameda, but I just think that it will be an uphill battle. I wish them luck.
00:39:10.690 - 00:39:55.178, Speaker D: Obviously it should just be this electronic thing. And why do I have to deposit five different brokers to do just like one trade between exchanges? There's all sorts of middlemen in the middle, but just kind of like the pharmaceutical stuff in the US. Where it's like completely non transparent pricing. You don't understand why certain warehouses, why when you go to your local pharmacy, even though there's a warehouse that's like 3 miles away from you that has the drug. Your pharmacy actually has to get it from this huge ring of pharmacies that send it back. There's all sorts of weird middlemen stuff going on here and the middlemen are they are boomers too. So I just feel like it's really hard to convince these people to change.
00:39:55.178 - 00:40:22.690, Speaker D: The electronic trading boom really was in a lot of ways for equities. The reason that they had to just accept it was like people just started making exchanges on their own and just started trading and soon tons of volume left the regulated exchanges, which is sort of what you see in crypto. So I think if you make this argue, you can try to make the same argument, but I think it's going to be hard. But I wish them luck.
00:40:23.510 - 00:40:54.998, Speaker C: There are popular arguments against 24 hours trading, right? Like Matt Levine talks about this where it's like it's just hard for dealers to be online for that amount of time. And so generally it's like you see worse liquidity in the market and so it's sort of like in some ways self defeating versus just like having everyone who wants to make a trade online for a small amount of time every day. You have really deep markets, everything settles and then it's sort of over versus trying to trade when markets aren't super deep or requiring people to be posting liquidity constantly.
00:40:55.174 - 00:41:19.918, Speaker A: This seems like such a bizarre argument to me, right, because look, if it's not in your interest to improve liquidity at a certain time, then it's like, okay, well, at least it's better to have some liquidity than no liquidity, right? If most of the trading activity happens at 05:00 p.m. Or whatever it is, then fine. Most of it happens at 05:00 p.m.. But at least the people who want to be in the market can be in the market. And there's not this weird cottage industry around after hours trading and this thing and people betting.
00:41:20.094 - 00:41:52.302, Speaker D: End of the day, as much as I love Matt Levine as a writer, I generally think he has very boomer technology takes, and a lot of it has to do with the fact he didn't work in electronic trading. Right. He was a derivatives lawyer at Goldman. That's a very different thing than working at Tower, right? Like if you work at Tower or Jump, they have 24 hours coverage. Every team is quoting wherever they can. This is not a problem. You have an international team that's distributed and every single trading firm can do this.
00:41:52.302 - 00:42:22.140, Speaker D: This is just a very boomer bank nonsense thing in my mind of these people who want this very yes, there are all these mistakes that can happen, but it's crypto. It's like even less likely in some ways. You can at least analyze why they happen post hoc. You can't even really do that when you have these 5 million brokers who don't publish any information, and then they only publish information when the SEC is like, hey, we think that there was wash trading. Send us all your records. Come on.
00:42:22.750 - 00:42:29.386, Speaker C: What are your thoughts on the poor farmers angle? Which is basically like, look, if you look at what a lot of people.
00:42:29.408 - 00:42:55.780, Speaker D: Are trading futures for, farmers already sold off their entire rights to their farms to Cargill. Are we seriously the Koch brothers already own most of this agricultural future. It's like Glencore and the Koch brothers. Why do we even care about the individual farmer? They don't even do this themselves. They go to all these brokers, right? This is all a very strong lobbying arm. That's what I would tell you.
00:42:56.150 - 00:42:58.882, Speaker C: I agree. I was just curious if you had any other thoughts.
00:42:59.026 - 00:43:10.220, Speaker D: This idea that the poor farmer is going and sitting on interactive brokers and he's like, in the tractor selling a future. Like, what idiot thinks that's a world we live in?
00:43:11.070 - 00:43:56.118, Speaker B: In terms of the condescending attitude the boomers have, or whatever it was that you were saying and how the traders kind of know better. Did you guys see that little clip of when Sam Bankman Fried got upset at how condescending I think it was somebody from CME was being about people who use his platform. And he was like, I'm a little offended know, the people who use my platform, they definitely know much more about these contracts than you, DA. And you're pretending like you're trying to protect mean, he said it a lot more politely even than still. You know, it's kind of a tense moment. And I don't know if you saw the previous one. Well, I didn't see it, but Frank Chaparro tweeted a little clip of it.
00:43:56.118 - 00:44:24.610, Speaker B: But when the CME guy was asked by Congressman Rokana what a blockchain is, he was like, A blockchain is a node. And then goes on using word salad, crypto, basically trying to make it I mean, he must have heard a definition, but didn't actually know the definition, and so just threw a bunch of words together that made it sound like he knew what a blockchain was. But yeah, blockchain is not a node.
00:44:25.350 - 00:44:48.658, Speaker D: I thought it was funny. I had this friend who asked one of the GPT-3 thing where you ask it a question, it'll generate an answer for you, like what a blockchain was. And it was about 100 times better than CME. So we should just replace certain people with GPT-3, I guess, is what we've learned.
00:44:48.754 - 00:45:07.920, Speaker B: I was just going to say, if people have more questions about this I did have Chris Perkins, president of Coin Fund, on my show discussing it. And he used to work at Citi and knows all about this and actually supports the FTX proposal. And he spent 20 minutes explaining the whole thing. So you can check that episode out.
00:45:08.530 - 00:45:33.702, Speaker A: Yeah, the political economy of this doesn't look great because the decision being made by the CFTC is ultimately they feel like they're very beholden to an entire system that doesn't want FTX to do what they want to do. It might be better in some holistic sense for everyone involved, but regulatory capture being what it is, I feel like the ODS for FTX are not good. Tarun, how would you handicap them?
00:45:33.836 - 00:46:27.490, Speaker D: I also would say I give it like 20%. The Luna timing was horrible, right? FTX has been preparing for this for a long time. I think the pressure from the Luna stuff is just going to basically kick any of these things down the know. It's going to be like the bitcoin spot ETF. It's not going to be like, come on, if we can't get that approved, do you think they're going to do this much of a change? I agree it's the SEC versus CFTC, but it's still going to take a while. I'm more bullish on what kind of like the way the eurodollar happened where some other country made this product and then it grew really big and then people in the US were like, look, you can't have this if we don't get this rule change. But right now the US doesn't feel that way about crypto.
00:46:27.490 - 00:46:42.118, Speaker D: I don't know exactly what it is that's not giving them that imperative. I just don't feel like FTX has the enough boomer suits yet. It just takes a while to hire those people. Get that. I don't think the swamp is easy to walk through without boots.
00:46:42.294 - 00:47:21.130, Speaker A: Fair enough. All right, well, we're running toward the end of time. We were going to talk about the optimism AirDrop shenanigans, but in the interest of time, I don't know if we can cover it in two minutes. I guess I just wanted to end on I think last time we were talking about the collapse of Terra and kind of doing a post mortem on it, but we didn't have a whole lot of time to really delve into what it means for crypto now that we've entered into this broader bear market. So we're now pretty firmly in this new territory where we're seeing much fewer product launches. Trading volume is down across the board. We're seeing a lot less retail engagement.
00:47:21.130 - 00:47:37.950, Speaker A: Most assets in crypto are down 50, 60% for the majors, and then below that things are down 70 to even 90%. And of course, even steeper if you're Terra. How are you guys thinking about the present moment? How is it shifting your perspective on what's happening in crypto?
00:47:38.290 - 00:47:47.154, Speaker D: Sole Denominated Magic eden NFT volume shockingly Not Going Down Yeah, I had this.
00:47:47.192 - 00:48:35.482, Speaker C: Little Twitter thread talking about this where it's basically you sure? If you look at the prices, it's just sort of this broad drawdown and you assume everything is sort of going down the same amount in sort of the same way. But if you look, there are interesting pockets of outperformance of things that are doing well, one of them being ether sold denominated NFT volumes. Looking at NFT user numbers, like all really impressive stuff that is structured to do well in a bear market. People taking on more risk, like these dovs, like these Dows that are selling bonds or some bond issuances coming up over the next few months. Stuff that makes sense to do in a bear market is doing well. But of course, the hyper leverage, super speculative trading that everyone loves in a bull market is not doing well. So I think it's like too doom and gloom to say like everything is dead, everything is dying.
00:48:35.482 - 00:48:44.100, Speaker C: It's like you've got to kind of pick and choose and look to find those things that are structured to work well in a bear market and maybe be less attractive in a bull market.
00:48:44.630 - 00:48:48.498, Speaker A: I mean, I love the take, but are we moving the goalpost a bit to start denominating?
00:48:48.674 - 00:49:14.142, Speaker D: No, I don't think so at all. Because I think NFTs are a particularly unique asset in that they're one of the few crypto assets that is not dollar stablecoin denominated. It's acting kind of crazy, right? Like the average new user to crypto in 2021 probably traded an NFT. I would guess that that is like 40, right? Those people had to learn how to buy Ether Soul. That was not true before.
00:49:14.276 - 00:49:21.886, Speaker A: But how many of them are denominating their reserves in Ether Soul? Right. That's the real important question.
00:49:21.988 - 00:49:30.530, Speaker D: The ones who got rich off trading that they're still living in that ecosystem, keeping it up, it's like they are net new users, I think. Don't forget that.
00:49:30.600 - 00:49:37.694, Speaker C: If you think it's so important, then why aren't they trading in stablecoins? Because you can technically do that on all these platforms, but people choose not to.
00:49:37.832 - 00:49:41.286, Speaker A: Yeah, no, that's a great question and I'm really curious how long it's a.
00:49:41.308 - 00:49:48.326, Speaker D: Change in consumer behavior for some cohort. I think that cohort is like the key consumer to understand.
00:49:48.508 - 00:50:21.266, Speaker A: Right. The question though is like NFTs were able to grow to the extent they were because there were marginal new people coming in and being willing to buy and sell these things. Right. Increasingly, the OGS, the people who are there from the beginning, they denominate their wealth in Ether or in Seoul or whatever. The new user who's like, oh, this NFT thing is really exciting, and get MoonPay to buy me an NFT, so, you know, show it off to my celebrity friends. That person is probably denominating. Like they're not thinking the way that you're describing, which is no, no, the.
00:50:21.288 - 00:50:44.380, Speaker D: Difference is before it was whales, now it's Hypebeasts is Hype beasts who would go on high Snobiety. And those people are Denominating Ethan soul. That is a new demographic that didn't exist in this industry. Right. And the fact that they're building their own economy around that, that is something that's a green shoot. So the question is, like, what are the products that are around?
00:50:44.830 - 00:50:58.474, Speaker A: I mean, it is the only thing right now in crypto that is denominated purely in the native token. For whatever reason, it's NFTs It's the one element of crypto where crypto actually acts like currencies is in the NFT.
00:50:58.522 - 00:51:16.146, Speaker D: Marketplaces, which is crazy. And it has new users who are not necessarily have been around, care about the original privacy reasons, the kind of internet philosophy. None of them care about the philosophical things. So that's like an interesting well, do.
00:51:16.168 - 00:51:20.690, Speaker A: You think that that will continue, let's say three years from now? Do you think they will continue to be priced in the native asset?
00:51:20.770 - 00:51:26.920, Speaker D: Look, I'm not here to try to shill music NFTs or whatever people like.
00:51:27.370 - 00:51:29.986, Speaker A: I'm asking you to make an intellectual.
00:51:30.178 - 00:51:40.454, Speaker D: No, no, I'm just making fun of the music NFT people because it feels like very much like mean girls. They're just like really trying to make it happen. And it has been a rough slog.
00:51:40.502 - 00:52:27.690, Speaker B: For but like, don't you guys think that the reason that they're denominated in the crypto is because NFTs are all about status? And the way that's reflected is, I don't know, somehow putting it in dollars. That is nowhere near as cool as if it's denominated in ETH or and especially, especially ETH in particular. And the fact that that price was set by whales and that the reason that it's denominated in ether soul is because people got in on the ground floor when it was cheap and then now they have like tons of whatever this coin is and then so the newbies they want this status. And so that's why they're willing to pay in that coin, because NFTs are about status.
00:52:28.110 - 00:52:29.706, Speaker A: That's a good theory as I've ever.
00:52:29.728 - 00:52:35.902, Speaker D: Heard, but it did attract new users. Right? Whatever the way yeah.
00:52:35.956 - 00:52:45.038, Speaker B: And they're chasing status. And the way they achieve that status is by paying an ether soul like the whales. It's like being like a yeah, imitation whale.
00:52:45.134 - 00:52:58.982, Speaker D: Be like Mike. Be like the haseeb. One last thing. The chat is really asking about the optimism thing. So if we have two minutes, we should okay.
00:52:59.116 - 00:53:18.294, Speaker A: All right, let's shoot for the optimism thing. So real quick. So optimism today was launching their AirDrop. There were a bit of snafus around the optimism AirDrop. So first off, for those who are not familiar, optimism is a L2 optimistic roll up. They've been around for a while. They're kind of the second in command behind Arbitrum for TVL.
00:53:18.294 - 00:54:20.750, Speaker A: They announced their AirDrop, but their AirDrop they unfortunately had a lot of issues with getting the AirDrop up and running. So first of all, I think it was a few weeks ago they ended up calling a lot of the list of potential AirDrop recipients for folks who were perceived to be bots or perceived to be gaming the AirDrop. But when you looked at your AirDrop, when you looked at the AirDrop that you were eligible for, apparently their RPC endpoint went down or kind of spazzed out and got really weird. So it started telling people that although they were perceived to have gotten the AirDrop or been eligible for the AirDrop, it then started telling they weren't eligible for the AirDrop and so a lot of people mistakenly believed that their AirDrop was been pulled from them. Now second, the contracts were deployed long before any of the announcements were made and of course many people were monitoring for the contract and so a bunch of people started taking their tokens out, selling them. The price discovery started taking place with a bunch of folks getting early in and dumping even before the actual website to claim any of these things was actually available. There was an announcement by the exchanges they were going to list optimism today even though the team themselves didn't say anything.
00:54:20.750 - 00:54:46.130, Speaker A: So the whole thing has been a little bit of a shit show and a lot of people are kind of fish shaking about it. I don't know that this will by the time that you listen to this podcast this might be so many days in rearview mirror you're like okay whatever. I mean that happens with every token launch. I kind of take the view that doesn't seem like a big deal to me but everyone's talking about it today so I figured we might as well do DAFF of the hat to that. I don't know if anybody else feels more strongly about it but this feels like a standard clumsy token launch.
00:54:46.290 - 00:54:53.100, Speaker C: Yeah, it feels pretty clowny but I think generally speaking airdrops are kind of pointless anyway so it's like.
00:54:57.150 - 00:54:59.850, Speaker A: We might need to disentangle that. Why are airdrops pointless?
00:55:00.830 - 00:55:41.770, Speaker C: What is the purpose of the airdrop? I don't really feel like I've ever gotten a good explanation of what this is supposed to be for, other than maybe creating a small float, creating some community goodwill, thanking people, but then people go out and game it anyway, and so it's like, ultimately the product sort of lives and dies almost by itself. And this is almost sort of like a marketing stunt or way to breed some community goodwill. But I think if you look at try to draw some sort of correlation between the quality of the AirDrop and the outcome for the product, there's probably zero correlation between the two. So I think a lot of teams think about an AirDrop and plan on it but ultimately I feel like it's just so window dressing.
00:55:43.230 - 00:56:15.346, Speaker B: Well yeah, right before we hopped on, my assistant made the point that probably a lot of the people that were gaming things and interacting with the smart contracts because they realized that they were already live were the whales and so the whales probably benefited a lot and made a lot of money. And then now once kind of more retail users who don't really know these things get in then the token price will have dropped and they'll be left holding. The bag. So that's actually one reason why it does matter.
00:56:15.448 - 00:56:49.822, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean with an AirDrop, right? Does that make sense? Again, these kinds of things happen pretty much always, right? Even if it was done fairly, there would be people who are running bots that instantly take the AirDrop and then sell it faster than anyone can click buttons. So yes, it's true. It could have been better. I don't know. I think these things tend to get overplayed in terms of their importance to the long term success of the project. Like optimism will be successful if they build a great L2. I think how well their AirDrop was executed doesn't matter that much in the bigger scheme of things, I guess.
00:56:49.956 - 00:57:45.806, Speaker D: Disclosure, optimism, investor. The main thing I would say is I do think L2s are all launching going to launch tokens and the success of all the future L2 tokens is sort of predicated on like the market appetite for it will somehow depend on how well or poorly this went. I think a lot of the RPC stuff was kind of bad in some ways just in the sense of a lot of there were a lot of people on crypto, Twitter who were just like, solana sucks. Like RPC endpoints never work. Avalanche sucks, RPC endpoints never work. So I do feel like there's a little bit of that fact that, hey, look, the Lear two that is vitalik approved somehow wasn't able to get around. There's like this weird thing of like.
00:57:45.828 - 00:57:47.190, Speaker A: There was like and did the sequencer.
00:57:47.210 - 00:58:33.614, Speaker D: Also go down for a tiny amount of time. But I think that was way shorter than the RPC problem was a big problem because there were all these other contracts you could call that worked fine and other endpoints you could go to. So I think the main thing was just like I just kind of think there is a little bit of social salt there's, a little bit of desalinification needed. I just don't get why people are always on each other like, oh, your thing sucks because your RPCs didn't work. Because it's like, you know, every new one of these things is hard as to build and no lawn launcher going to have this. So anytime you make fun of someone, don't forget it will happen to you too, eventually, I hope.
00:58:33.652 - 00:58:35.114, Speaker B: Do Kwan is listening.
00:58:35.242 - 00:58:37.440, Speaker D: That's the Karmic force of the world.
00:58:38.690 - 00:58:51.366, Speaker A: Doe Kwan might be a slightly different story, but I completely agree with this. This happens to everyone and I think it's incredibly not a big deal, although yet it's annoying at the time that it happens.
00:58:51.468 - 00:59:34.658, Speaker D: I give Anatoli the most credit of everyone for this because for some reason he does not yell at people and doesn't go like, oh, your thing sucks all the time. Which I think a lot of people are always ready with pitchfork to be like, your doesn't work. And it's like especially, I think, a lot of e two researchers, not e two devs. E two devs understand that it's difficult to launch e two researchers love just, like, going and ribbing on all these things. And I'm like, you guys are just when you have your problem, like we did with the Beacon Chain testnet stuff, the Robson thing. I don't know. Why can't people just not be dicks about this?
00:59:34.744 - 00:59:39.286, Speaker A: Yeah, no, everyone gets their day in the well, everyone gets their day in the agree.
00:59:39.388 - 01:00:01.382, Speaker B: You know, Anatolia is probably a little bit more even killed than some of the other people when he's getting attacked. But I do have to say, sometimes his spin when Solana has issues, and then he's well, you know, back in the day, Bitcoin had a block time of blah, blah, blah. And I'm like, this is not the like, don't try to compare Solana to Bitcoin.
01:00:01.526 - 01:00:10.270, Speaker D: Everyone is at fault. I would just say he does not just go out of his way to constantly be like, your RPC failed. You suck.
01:00:11.170 - 01:00:30.838, Speaker A: Now that we have brought Anatole in, we did challenge Anatoly over Twitter to come on the show, so we'll have to bring him on next time. Now that the I'm hoping that next time there will be no more luna no more Luna news for us to work through, and we can start focusing on other things. So that'll be a good follow up to this.
01:00:31.004 - 01:00:37.378, Speaker D: I do know the soul, the sun is the opposite of the moon. So if he's on the show, can't mention the moon.
01:00:37.474 - 01:00:49.254, Speaker A: All right, I guess that's that. All right, well, let's wrap it up, guys, because I actually do have to run. Thank you, everybody, for tuning in, and we'll see you guys in a couple of weeks.
01:00:49.372 - 01:00:50.140, Speaker D: Sounds good. See it.
