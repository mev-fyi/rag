00:00:04.010 - 00:00:32.626, Speaker A: Hi, everyone. Welcome to Unconfirmed, the podcast that reveals how the market names in crypto are reacting to the week's top headlines and gets the inside scoop on what they see on the horizon. I'm your host, Laura Shin. One quick announcement before we start the show. Unchained now has a merchandise shop. We've got a few t shirts, a couple hats, a mug, some stickers, and I don't remember if there was anything else. Anyway, my team and I got creative with one of the t shirt designs and came up with an image of a crypto rabbit falling down a hole.
00:00:32.626 - 00:01:09.106, Speaker A: Swirling into the hole with the rabbit are playing cards showing some of the coins like Bitcoin, ethereum, and Monero, as well as a dow card ripped in half. There's a Guy Fox mask, a DeFi cake, a lambo, and a teapot that says Hodl, as well as teacups showing the reddit and Twitter logos. There's even a shitcoin the rabbit is wearing a big bitcoin key on a keychain, a unicorn and rainbow t shirt, and of course, is listening to Unchained. We've now got rabbit versions of the mug and some decals. Check it out at shop unchainedpodcast.com. Again. That's shop unchainedpodcast.com.

00:02:07.806 - 00:02:09.046, Speaker C: Hey, it's good to be here.
00:02:09.068 - 00:02:16.710, Speaker A: Laura, since we're closing in on the end of the year, what's your high level overview of what's going on at a macro level in the crypto markets?
00:02:17.530 - 00:02:51.118, Speaker C: Sure. So, like you already said, I'm the head of research at The Block, and so we're mainly a research company, and we just released our November report. So right now what we're seeing is that the markets are actually not that active. The trading volumes, which I think is one of the best indicators of the overall interest in crypto, are really low. So right now, they're 12% lower than last month. The daily average traded volume is about 1.4 billion.
00:02:51.118 - 00:03:40.482, Speaker C: Last month was 1.6, and if we look all the way back to June, it was close to 3.5 billion, so more than twice lower right now. So the interest in the crypto market is really low currently, and that's reflecting on the traded volumes and that's reflecting on the overall sentiment. So one really good thing to look at for trading volume is overall, it hasn't been a really reliable indicator because there's just so much faked volume. But since Bitwise came out with their report and they identified the exchanges that don't fake as much volume, we can get a really good approximation of what's actually going on in the market. And like I already mentioned, it's currently not doing so well.
00:03:40.482 - 00:04:14.000, Speaker C: And that's mostly for spot exchanges. But if we look at derivative exchanges, if we look at BitMax volumes, we look at GBTC traded volumes, all of these volumes are currently at eight month lows. So, yeah, the market is not doing that well right now, but as we both know, that can turn it out really quickly. So even though the trend is not super favorable right now in crypto, that doesn't mean much next month it can shoot up again and everything is going to be fine.
00:04:14.370 - 00:04:37.380, Speaker A: And one of the aspects that you mentioned is the Bitcoin derivative data. So that is self reported. I'm wondering what is it that is important about this data and what can you glean when you look at that as opposed to the spot market? Is there anything different that you're noticing? And how much can we trust that data?
00:04:37.990 - 00:05:12.894, Speaker C: Sure, so it depends. What kind of derivative data are you looking at? Right, so there are multiple derivative markets right now, and I think 2019 has been a really good year for the maturing of the financial infrastructure in crypto, especially for bitcoin. So there are currently multiple different derivative markets. One is the regulated one. So you have futures on the CME and backed backed launching fairly recently, and it's growing fairly well recently. It's currently at about 5% of the CME's volumes. So that's regulated.
00:05:12.894 - 00:06:01.598, Speaker C: You can trust that 100% because those are regulated futures. Then you have the unregulated markets. So the main player is BitMax. Those are self reported, but BitMax has historically been reliable with reporting the know, there are multiple things that you can do to cross check that. So, for example, for spot exchanges, what we do at the block is that we look at the reported trading volume and compare that to the website visits. So you get an estimation of how many people actually go on the site and then you compare that to the amount of reported trading volume and you get a ratio. And if the ratio is too high compared to other exchanges, it likely means that the self reported numbers are not correct.
00:06:01.598 - 00:06:35.094, Speaker C: But for BitMEX, that is not the case. BitMEX has been historically reliable and then you have options. So the biggest player is Terribit, and those have also been historically reliable. So quite on the contrary, actually, the spot exchanges are the ones that are the least reliable. So you really have to be careful. There 80% of all the volume, maybe even more, that you see on Coin market cap is fake. So you really need to just stick to the exchanges that have been reliable.
00:06:35.094 - 00:06:37.020, Speaker C: Most of them are regulated in the US.
00:06:38.110 - 00:06:48.350, Speaker A: One other thing that I saw in your report was that you noted that hedge funds are seemingly crowning into a short position right now. Why do you think that's happening and what could that signify?
00:06:53.090 - 00:07:40.718, Speaker C: It's really hard to say. What could that signify? But I guess the obvious position right now is like I already mentioned, markets are not doing that well. And what that means in crypto is that when volatility is really low and the prices haven't been moving drastically, it means that people are anticipating that the markets are just not going to recover. You can identify the cycles in crypto like the one we saw in 2017 and the one that we see right now in 2019. You can identify them through the volumes. And when the volumes are dropping, for a lot of hedge funds and for a lot of funds overall, that means that sends them a signal that we're entering into another downturn. And as we both know, that sometimes takes years.
00:07:40.718 - 00:08:04.040, Speaker C: And the market basically peaked in June and ever since then it's been going down and it's hard to tell when it's going to recover. So if I were to guess, these hedge funds are probably thinking we're in another down cycle and this could take multiple months. So that's probably why they're in short positions. But again, it's very hard to speculate on that.
00:08:04.650 - 00:08:21.680, Speaker A: And you mentioned that especially the infrastructure for bitcoin in particular has grown quite a bit this year. And I'm curious to know what you have been seeing in terms of just like the basic liquidity, is it that the infrastructure is there, but still there hasn't been a lot of interest?
00:08:22.690 - 00:09:23.102, Speaker C: Yeah, so the infrastructure this year has really improved drastically and especially in the regulated markets. So the CME and backed are now going head to head. Backed has been gaining a lot more interest lately and then you also start having Backed and CME also announced that they're going to launch options fairly soon. So you start having these regulated markets on top of the unregulated ones that we had before. And the reason why that's happening with bitcoin and not other cryptocurrencies like ethereum is that there's just the most regulatory clarity and bitcoin is by far the most liquid cryptocurrency. I did some research a couple of weeks ago and at that point bitcoin was four times more liquid than ethereum and I think about seven or eight times more than XRP, and then there's a big gap after that. So it's the most liquid by far.
00:09:23.102 - 00:10:00.060, Speaker C: And it's also, from my experience, at least institutional players that started joining this year. It's really the first year when the large players are starting to join. They're trading bitcoin, they're not trading anything else. So the liquidity has been there in May, June and July. Now it's a little bit lower again, but the infrastructure is getting better. And what that means is that when there is another market cycle, the infrastructure will be better. At that point, it'll be ready and that will help the market overall this year we have seen a lot of maturing on that part.
00:10:00.510 - 00:10:15.066, Speaker A: We're going to talk a little bit more about the differences amongst the exchanges. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible. Got an eeos. Crypto.com is adding more utility to it. You can top up their card with EOS and spend anywhere. Visa is accepted.

00:10:35.292 - 00:11:28.630, Speaker B: Will the world follow France and advocate banning privacy coins? Will government backed stablecoins become the new fiat? Are distributed and PeerToPeer exchanges just a flash in the pan? The answer is maybe. Virtual currencies can flourish and create a new, private and more versatile economy. But that grand vision can't happen without keeping crypto clean, and that requires support of governments and accountability for bad actors.

00:11:30.764 - 00:11:55.060, Speaker A: Back to my conversation with Larry Sirmac of the Block. So when we're talking about the liquidity of the bitcoin pairs, what are you seeing in terms of the difference amongst individual exchanges? And your report also breaks it down in terms of the depth at 1% versus 10%. And I'm curious also to know what those differences are between exchanges and what those differences mean.
00:11:55.670 - 00:12:39.310, Speaker C: Sure, so I already kind of mentioned this, but trader volume is not a very reliable metric. That's for multiple reasons. One is that a lot of exchanges are faking. Second one is that you have market makers that depend on each exchange, but it's not the most reliable metric for traders, because if there is more traded volume, it doesn't necessarily mean that there is more liquidity. And liquidity is more important for traders because they want to have the most liquid markets, they want to have the least slippage possible. So liquidity is really important. And what we're seeing there is that bitfinex overall, which doesn't have the most volume, not even close.
00:12:39.310 - 00:13:41.970, Speaker C: It's probably the 6th or 7th exchange by volume, but has the most liquidity on the bitcoin pairs, the ethereum pairs and XRP pairs. Bitfinex really stands out. You mentioned one and 10% order book depth difference so what that means is that you look at a certain section of the order book. So with 1%, you only look at a small section, you only look at 1% of the order book and Bits there, and on the 10% you look at a larger size. Usually in my experience, 10% seems to be a little more reliable for comparing all these larger exchanges because 1%, sometimes it's thrown off by all the market makers. So if you look at 10%, it seems to be, at least from my experience, more reliable. Get an understanding of which exchanges have the most liquidity and like I already mentioned, Bitfinex seems to be the most liquid.
00:13:41.970 - 00:14:12.880, Speaker C: Even though its reputation hasn't been that great lately, it still has the most liquidity and it's still the go to for the largest traders, mainly because of the liquidity and their trading tools and their trading algorithm. It's really advanced. And then you have the other exchanges. So Coinbase is, I think, trailing Kraken, Bitstamp and Binance as well, but all the other exchanges are usually fairly far away from these.
00:14:13.970 - 00:14:48.040, Speaker A: And you also talk about how some of these have more retail adoption and institutional adoption. And I also just wanted to link that to the depth issue because I don't know if I fully understand what it means to have greater liquidity at 10% versus 1%. So when you see that Bitfinex does have that even compared to the 1% metric, is that sort of saying that maybe there's a bigger diversity of traders, or is it saying that there's bigger traders like more whales? Or what does that mean?
00:14:48.410 - 00:15:30.418, Speaker C: It just means that there is more orders combined on that order buck. So if it's on 10%, it just means that there's just overall more trades that can be executed. So for Bitfinex, there's just the most traders with the most money on the line. So if you want to go to an exchange and have little slippage, which means that the price that you want to sell or buy doesn't change much, if you're selling a lot, then you go to those exchanges because they have the most to sell or to buy. So really the simplest explanation is it just has the most traders with the most money on the line in these order books.
00:15:30.594 - 00:15:39.850, Speaker A: And as I just mentioned, some of the exchanges have more retail adoption versus institutional adoption. Which ones are attracting, which markets.
00:15:40.510 - 00:16:55.780, Speaker C: Sure, so Bitfenex historically has attracted the largest traders, but in my experience that's mostly whales and not really large funds, but it could be as well. BitMEX has also historically been mostly focused on really large traders as opposed to retail ones. And the other side of the spectrum you have Binance is by far the most retail based exchange. So you can also see that I already mentioned this briefly, but if you look at the ratio between the traded volume and the number of website visits, binance is scoring really low on these, and Coinbase is trailing. So Coinbase and Binance seem to be by far the most retail based exchanges. But then you have some exchanges like LMAX for example, which is really unknown by almost anyone in the crypto space, and they're fully institutionally based spot exchange, and currently they're almost at the coinbase level in terms of traded volume, they just surpassed Bitstamp and Kraken. So they're a really good example of a purely institutional based, not even really accepting any retail customers.
00:16:56.790 - 00:17:06.542, Speaker A: And do you feel like any of these exchanges will have a tougher time in terms of their business model based on whether or not they're attracting the.
00:17:06.616 - 00:18:13.674, Speaker C: Institutional versus I think that's a really good question. And I think one interesting thing about this year, as opposed to 2017 and early 2018, about that bull run back then, is that before it was very retail based. So you had hundreds of thousands of really small retail investors putting their money into Bitcoin, Ethereum, ICOs, all of that really large amount of small traders as opposed to this year. All the data they have looked at this year indicates that there isn't any new retail coming in, or if there is, it's very small amounts of retail customers. This year has been really largely driven by large traders, whether that be bitcoin whales that have been holding bitcoin for years, or institutional traders, hedge funds. They're getting more important this year as opposed to retail. This hasn't been a good year for Binance because there just isn't that much retail customers.
00:18:13.674 - 00:19:06.490, Speaker C: They've done well when they did the iOS, but that's also been dying recently and their interest is decreasing. But the exchanges that have been doing well are the institutional base. So LMAX has done really well. The market has changed a lot, but I don't think that that's an indication of what will happen in the future. That could just mean that a lot of the retail investors that invest in bitcoin 20, 17, 18, they just got burned, they lost some money and they're discouraged from investing again. And if we ever surpass the price that was reached in 2017 or 18, that could mean that these people jump back in. So it's really hard to say which platform is better positioned right now, but there are clearly differences between these exchanges.
00:19:07.070 - 00:19:30.354, Speaker A: One other thing that your report talked about was how there are actually other exchanges aside from the ones that Bitwise noted as having real volume that you also believe have real volume. I think you named eleven, we don't have to go into all eleven, but are there any particular ones that you want to talk about? And also if you could talk about how you determine that they also have real volume, that would be great.
00:19:30.552 - 00:20:12.138, Speaker C: Sure. So I would have to pull up the list. So mainly these exchanges are the smaller ones and the ones that both you and I wouldn't really hear about if we didn't do this analysis, and that's because most of them are focused on one particular market. So the exchanges that we talked about, bitfinex, coinbase bitstamp, kraken, even though they're based in the US. They serve different markets. Most of them are open to trade for almost anyone in the world, europe, even Asia. But the exchanges that don't get included in the bitwise ten are the ones that are focused on specific markets.
00:20:12.138 - 00:21:12.638, Speaker C: So you have some exchanges in South Korea that are only focused on the South Korean market, and they do have a bunch of real volume. You have exchanges in Japan that have a lot of real value, you have exchanges in Indonesia that have a ton of real value, but they usually don't get included because they're just so market. And the way I determine this, and it's not an exact science, but yeah, by using the number of website visits, we used similar web as kind of the proxy of how much traffic each site gets. And so what you do is that you record the number of visits that each site gets and then divide it and do the ratio between that and then the traded volume. And so if the ratio is really low, that means that the volume is likely real. But then you get exchanges like, for example, like Huobi or Okx, where the ratio is really high. And what that means is that they likely are faking a lot of volume.
00:21:12.638 - 00:21:20.040, Speaker C: It seems like at least like 40% to 50% of the volume there just cannot be real because the ratio is just too high.
00:21:20.490 - 00:21:24.870, Speaker A: Yeah, the graphs on that are pretty striking.
00:21:25.210 - 00:21:26.294, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly.
00:21:26.492 - 00:21:35.702, Speaker A: It's very obvious that volume is a clear outlier from all the other exchanges.
00:21:35.846 - 00:22:22.310, Speaker C: And so some examples I know you mentioned, I pulled it up just so we have some examples for the listeners. But Indodex is one, luno, which is mainly based in Africa, CEX, Zafe, japanese exchanges, YoBit, GOPAX, Xmo, Corbett, so they're very unknown exchanges for the regular people, but they're fairly widely known in the countries where they operate. And one more exchange that I would like to add, finance us also seems to have real volume and it's not included in bitwise ten because it didn't exist back then, but it's not getting much traction so far. So almost all of these in terms of volume, they're not getting a big piece of the pie, but they do have a lot of real volume.
00:22:22.750 - 00:22:34.918, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah. And I'll make a plug for Indonesia. I used to live there, and it's the fourth most populous country in the yeah, you were just there, forgot about that.
00:22:34.944 - 00:22:37.200, Speaker C: I was in Bali two weeks ago.
00:22:37.730 - 00:22:54.500, Speaker A: Yes, very magical place. Highly recommend to everybody. Absolutely loves living there. Anyway, so we're coming up on time. But just the last quick question is one other thing is you looked at the value settled on bitcoin to kind of see the utility of it. And what did you find there?
00:22:55.110 - 00:23:45.954, Speaker C: So the value settled on bitcoin I think is a really good metric. And that's because it kind of shows you how much actual value gets actually settled on the bitcoin blockchain. And that's relevant because it's real transaction on the blockchain that cannot be faked in any way. So what I did is that we look at the value settled, adjusted to all the externality. So, for example, if you have some repeated transaction, that gets canceled out and we find that bitcoin gets by far the most value settled on it. We looked at multiple different cryptocurrencies. One was bitcoin and obviously Ethereum XRP bitcoin cash and then litecoin.
00:23:45.954 - 00:24:31.602, Speaker C: And when you look at the ratio, bitcoin gets by far the most. And when you look at bitcoin in relation to Ethereum, ethereum is actually falling in the ratio. So that means that there's less settled on Ethereum when compared to bitcoin. And then I also look at that when compared to the gold market and how much is sold in and gold OTC market. And it turns out that on bitcoin, there's probably going to be more than $900 billion settled in 2019. In gold, I think it's about $400 to $500 billion. So it's a little bit less, or not a little bit, but almost twice as less.
00:24:31.602 - 00:25:19.518, Speaker C: So the value that is settled is real on bitcoin. There's one cavit, though, which is that a lot of this is very closely correlated to trading volume as well. So that kind of supports the thing that everyone is saying, is that bitcoin is mostly used for speculation. And that, in my experience, is still true. I think the latest estimates are that about 90% of all the bitcoin transactions are used for sending money, sending bitcoin from wallets to exchanges and there and back. So that's still about 90%. And it's really good that you can see how closely the exchange volume correlates with the value settled on bitcoin.
00:25:19.518 - 00:25:55.326, Speaker C: So what that tells you is that when the value is high on exchanges, the value settled also is a lot higher on the blockchain. And that's not necessarily a bad thing. People often say bitcoin is only used for trading that's bad. I don't think it's necessarily bad. It's a use case and bitcoin is traded 24/7. It's a really good instrument for traders. So I don't think that's necessarily bad and I think if we continue going down this path, that will likely change in the future.
00:25:55.326 - 00:25:59.150, Speaker C: But, yeah, so far it seems to be mostly used for speculation.
00:25:59.730 - 00:26:12.526, Speaker A: All right, well, that was really fascinating about how 90% of it is going to exchanges, but it does make sense. Well, we will see if any of this changes in 2020. Thanks so much for coming on Unconfirmed.

00:27:17.750 - 00:28:01.858, Speaker A: Based on the responses on Twitter, I think a lot of other people felt the same way. While on the surface it doesn't seem to have a lot to do with cryptocurrencies, it most definitely illustrates why crypto people so often speak of the ideals of decentralization and censorship resistance. Christian Carlos said wow, what an episode. Jake Trevinsky tweeted, this might be the most important crypto podcast of 2019, even though crypto is barely discussed. Alex Vandesan said, this is such an important interview and someone with a handle Alex Boogie wrote jaw dropped and without words after listening to this. Now, on to this week's headlines. MakerDAO flaw allows attacker to turn 20 million into $340,000,000 in 15 seconds.
00:28:01.858 - 00:29:16.014, Speaker A: Micah Zoltu of Coin Monks wrote a how to that begins quote Anyone with about 40,000 MKR, which is about 20,000 USD, can steal all of the collateral in MakerDAO, both Dai and PSI, along with a good chunk of assets from Compound, uniswap and other Maker integrated systems over $340,000,000 USD. The MakerDAO Foundation moved up a plan to address this vulnerability after the publication of this blog post. Next Headline Understanding bitcoin bubbles looking at last on chain movement So I actually missed this post last week, but Coimetrics came up with a fascinating look at what they're calling cost basis, but defining as the last time a Coin moved on chain. It serves as a decent proxy of understanding how bitcoin bubbles work, and it shows when the cycle might hit its peaks and lows, and also when investors capitulate. You should just check it out to see all the different graphs. It's much more easy to understand if you're looking at those. It's a pretty involved analysis, but if you were interested in the discussion with Larry, you will definitely enjoy it.
00:29:16.014 - 00:29:59.450, Speaker A: Next Headline Telegram Advisor in UK sought by SEC CoinDesk reported that the SEC, in its effort to stop the launch of Telegram's crypto network Tun, has asked the High Court of England and Wales for testimony and documents from John Hyman. Telegram's former chief investment advisor. A filing by the SEC with the US. District Court of the Southern District of New York last Friday revealed some of Telegram's fundraising strategy during its $1.7 billion token presale. The documents quote Hyman is saying in one email that telegram, quote, decided for regulatory reasons that we will never do any form of direct public offering. The public will be able to buy grams once network is working, not from Telegram directly.
00:29:59.450 - 00:31:07.374, Speaker A: Also, even though ton investors were prohibited from reselling their allocations, there was an active secondary market, and hyman regularly asked about it.
