00:00:05.690 - 00:00:55.514, Speaker A: Thanks for tuning in to this week's news. Recap the second largest hack in DFI history, Wormhole was exploited on Wednesday for 120,000 wrapped ETH. According to Twitter user Tony Intern, the attacker was able to steal almost all of the Wormhole wrapped ETH, which accounts for 20% of the $1.6 billion in wrapped ETH locked into Salana. With Ethereum hovering at around two $600, the exploit is worth over $300 million and ranks as the second largest hack in DFI history. Data from Wrecked shows Wormhole is a crosschain bridge, meaning Wormhole locks assets into a contract on one chain and mints a wrapped version of the asset onto another chain. According to paradigm researcher Sam CZ.
00:00:55.514 - 00:01:35.626, Speaker A: Sun, the attacker spoofed a guardian signature and minted 120,000 ETH on Salana without having to bridge ETH in the first place. A guardian is a node that signs off on transactions between chains. By creating a fraudulent guardian signature, the attacker was able to mint wrapped ETH on Solana out of thin air and move the fake wrapped ETH to Ethereum in exchange for real ETH optimism's. Kelvin Ficter also came to the same conclusion. The Wormhole team announced that the vulnerability was patched at 07:41 P.m. On Wednesday night. By Thursday morning, the bridge was live.
00:01:35.626 - 00:02:18.082, Speaker A: Jump Crypto replaced the 120,000 ETH on Wormhole's ETH contract so that wrapped ETH was once again fully backed on Salana in the hours after the attack occurred. It appears the Wormhole team reached out to the hacker's address to offer a $10 million white hat bounty in exchange for returning the funds. As of press time, there is no update on this front. NFT volume in January skyrocketed despite a choppy, crypto market crypto started 2022 as a $2.2 trillion asset class. According to data from Coin market cap, 31 days later, the market sat at $1.7 trillion, a 22% decline.
00:02:18.082 - 00:02:59.246, Speaker A: Tokens that ended last year on a hot streak were particularly hit hard by the market correction, with 2021 darlings Terra and Salana down more than 40% on the month. Blue chips bitcoin and Ether were also hit hard in January, dropping roughly 20% and 25% respectively. Despite the drawdown, nonfungible tokens had a record month in January. NFT marketplace volume hit an alltime high of $6.75 billion, doubling last August's previous record of $3.31 billion, data from the block shows. Openc led the way, facilitating 60% of January's.
00:02:59.246 - 00:03:38.498, Speaker A: NFT volume, however, looks rare. An NFT marketplace that debuted on January 10 via a vampire attack on Openc saw over $2 billion in volume on its platform. Salana NFTs also had a big month, surpassing $1 billion in historical volume. And Magic Eden, an NFT marketplace, did a record $300 million plus in January. High NFT trading volume coincided with tons of mainstream adoption. Twitter implemented NFTs into profile pictures, and Reddit is testing a similar feature. YouTube and Meta are both rumored to be working on NFT products.

Stakers Could Be in for a Tax Reprieve Last year, Joshua and Jessica Jarrett sued the IRS for a refund, claiming that they erroneously paid taxes on crypto staking rewards as if it were income. The lawsuit argues that staking income should not be treated as income until it is sold. This week, the IRS offered the Jarrett's their refund without explaining the reasoning behind the refund, which would also mean that the IRS wouldn't be setting a precedent. However, Joshua said that they are not taking the refund, explaining, I refused the offer because I know that until my case receives an official ruling, I have no certainty they won't try to tax me again.
00:04:30.500 - 00:05:43.818, Speaker A: In essence, Josh sued the IRS for clarity on taxation of new tokens created through staking. The IRS tried to pay him off to drop the suit. He turned down the money to continue the case and seek binding precedent for us all, wrote the blockchain association's Jake Trevinsky on Twitter. According to Cointracker's Shehan Chandra Secura, if decided in favor of the Jarrett's, the case would only set a precedent for proof of stake staking income and would not cover interest mining or AirDrop income.
