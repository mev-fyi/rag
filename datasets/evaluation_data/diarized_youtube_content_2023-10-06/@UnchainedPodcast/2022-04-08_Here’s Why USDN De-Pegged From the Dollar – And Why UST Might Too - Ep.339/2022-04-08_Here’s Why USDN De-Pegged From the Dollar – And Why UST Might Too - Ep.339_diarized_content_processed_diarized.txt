00:02:34.458 - 00:02:37.120, Speaker E: Hey, Laura. How's it going? Thanks for having me on.
00:02:37.810 - 00:02:55.940, Speaker A: This was a pretty dramatic week in stablecoins. On Monday, a stablecoin called Neutrino Dollar, or USDN, lost its peg, falling to a low of $0.68. Why don't you begin by telling the listeners what USDN is and how it works?
00:02:56.710 - 00:02:57.086, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:02:57.128 - 00:02:59.906, Speaker E: So USDN is neutrino dollar.
00:02:59.938 - 00:03:02.742, Speaker F: It's basically a stable coin that's pegged to the US.
00:03:02.796 - 00:03:06.402, Speaker E: Dollar, and it's an integral part of the waves ecosystem.
00:03:06.546 - 00:03:08.506, Speaker F: The way it works is that the.
00:03:08.528 - 00:03:12.118, Speaker E: Creation, the minting or redeeming of USDN.
00:03:12.214 - 00:03:14.406, Speaker F: Is done through burning.
00:03:14.518 - 00:03:25.914, Speaker E: So if you want to create USDN, you burn waves. You burn an equivalent dollar amount of waves to get an equivalent dollar amount of USDN. And the reverse is true. When you want to redeem USDN, then you redeem it for waves.
00:03:25.962 - 00:03:28.602, Speaker F: So for every X amount of USDN.
00:03:28.746 - 00:03:31.150, Speaker E: That you burn, you get x dollars.
00:03:31.220 - 00:03:32.800, Speaker F: Amount of waves back.
00:03:33.670 - 00:03:45.090, Speaker A: This is what we would call an algorithmic stablecoin. And algorithmic stablecoins have historically had trouble. So in this case, how and why did USDN DPEG?
00:03:45.590 - 00:03:49.238, Speaker F: Yes, it was for a number of reasons, but the main reason is that.
00:03:49.324 - 00:03:56.306, Speaker E: People found that on chain there was a really large address that was doing what we call recycling right, or leveraging.
00:03:56.418 - 00:03:57.686, Speaker F: And the way that that works is.
00:03:57.708 - 00:04:01.930, Speaker E: That and many people think that this is the Waves team themselves that was doing this.
00:04:02.000 - 00:04:04.314, Speaker F: And the way that works is first.
00:04:04.352 - 00:04:17.578, Speaker E: You start with USDN, you put it into Virez. And Virez is basically like the ave of waves. So it's a borrow lending platform. You can deposit USDN over there, get some yield, you can borrow other types.
00:04:17.594 - 00:04:23.230, Speaker F: Of assets like USDC, tether veras itself waves a lot of different assets.
00:04:23.570 - 00:04:34.030, Speaker E: So the way that this loop works is that USDN is first put into Veras as deposit and then from that they're able to borrow hard assets like USDC and USDT.
00:04:34.190 - 00:04:36.398, Speaker F: They use that then to buy Waves.
00:04:36.494 - 00:04:40.566, Speaker E: And then use the Waves to convert it to USDN through the mechanism that.
00:04:40.588 - 00:04:42.374, Speaker F: We talked about right before, and then.
00:04:42.412 - 00:04:55.658, Speaker E: Redeposit that USDN back into Verus, completing the cycle and continuously do this until basically all the deposits for USDC or USDT are depleted because then the cycle can't continue anymore. So basically there was a lot of.
00:04:55.664 - 00:04:58.454, Speaker F: This recycling going on and that's what's.
00:04:58.502 - 00:05:10.126, Speaker E: Been causing this huge pump in the price of waves. And then afterwards, at some point, there are a lot of people on Twitter, for example, like Xerox Hams, for example. A lot of people have pointed this out, which is that this whole thing.
00:05:10.148 - 00:05:12.318, Speaker F: Is unsustainable because at some point the.
00:05:12.324 - 00:05:19.822, Speaker E: Whole thing has to come back down once this cycle stops because of the running out of deposits of USDC and USDT.
00:05:19.966 - 00:05:27.686, Speaker F: And also on top of that, there's more to the story because Sasha comes out, who's the founder of Waves, and.
00:05:27.708 - 00:05:41.706, Speaker E: He starts putting together this conspiracy theory that it's actually like Alameda that's causing a lot of problems for the Waves ecosystem, and saying that oh, these guys are really short. And he put out a proposal for.
00:05:41.728 - 00:05:44.842, Speaker F: A governance vote, which was basically without.
00:05:44.896 - 00:06:20.134, Speaker E: Getting into all the nitty gritty. The idea of it is that it would make it harder for shorts and it would be more possible for them to get liquidated because he wanted to liquidate the shorts. Unfortunately, this kind of backfired because Alameda responded in saying we're not actually just naked short on Waves or USDN. Really, they have this hedge play that's going on where they're taking out a borrow of Waves to short it, but at the same time they're long the perps. And the reason that they're doing that is that there's some basis to collect in between. In other words, like the funding rate was very favorable in this kind of hedge trade, right. So they're not actually having any net.
00:06:20.172 - 00:06:24.102, Speaker F: Kind of exposure on waves. They're really just doing this kind of hedge play.
00:06:24.236 - 00:06:27.638, Speaker E: And then on top of that, then the community also had a backlash against.
00:06:27.724 - 00:06:30.726, Speaker F: Sasha saying that we can't just, you.
00:06:30.748 - 00:07:01.154, Speaker E: Know, liquidate shorts just because they're, you know, it's a fair short. I mean, they want to express that bet, whether it's an actual short or whether it's a hedged, their that's their right to do that. And we shouldn't just change up the protocol rules just so that we can squeeze the price higher. So I think overall ended up backfiring on them. And then from sort of the revelations of this recycling, which is unhealthy, generally considered unhealthy, and generally considered these kinds of prices that were waves pumped to.
00:07:01.272 - 00:07:04.626, Speaker F: Was considered generally inorganic, then basically all.
00:07:04.648 - 00:07:07.278, Speaker E: This stuff had to get sold down.
00:07:07.384 - 00:07:08.546, Speaker F: And then on top of that, there's.
00:07:08.578 - 00:07:16.386, Speaker E: Some unwinding effects where as Wave starts collapsing in price, trust in the system starts to get depleted.
00:07:16.498 - 00:07:22.218, Speaker F: There's a lot of circular effects, just overall trust kind of erodes and a.
00:07:22.224 - 00:07:25.722, Speaker E: Lot of other people start selling too. So that kind of compresses the price.
00:07:25.856 - 00:07:28.330, Speaker C: So that's how it got depegged.
00:07:29.070 - 00:07:32.790, Speaker E: Yeah. So that's the reason that waves ran up and then crashed.
00:07:32.870 - 00:07:39.086, Speaker F: And then the depegging itself is that at some point, if you're looking for.
00:07:39.108 - 00:08:02.214, Speaker E: An exit from this sort of like spiraling or failing system, there's two ways to do it. If you have USDN, right? One is to convert it to waves and sell the waves, and the other is just to sell the USDN. So depending on whether the mechanism is gated or not, and we can talk about like Luna and Terra later, but depending on whether it's gated or not, if there are very strict restrictions on just how much USDN you can get.
00:08:02.252 - 00:08:06.950, Speaker F: Out into waves, then the USDN itself long.
00:08:07.020 - 00:08:26.910, Speaker E: So that's sort of like the end state. The end state is where there's not enough liquidity in waves itself or the convertibility between USDN and waves gets short circuited somehow and then the stablecoin itself depends. Otherwise people would just convert the stablecoin to waves and then get out through that angle.
00:08:27.410 - 00:08:37.940, Speaker C: So essentially though, like, people wanted to sell out of USDN and they couldn't. And so then they were willing to sell it at lower and lower prices. Is that basically what caused the.
00:08:40.550 - 00:08:55.190, Speaker E: It'S basically there's two outflows for capital in that kind of system, either through Waves or through USDN, right? So the DPEG happens because there was not enough bandwidth to go through waves.
00:08:56.170 - 00:09:21.166, Speaker C: Okay. Yeah. I mean such a fascinating story. Yeah. I was looking at the comments on the proposal. So by the way, the Wave CEO, Sasha Ivanov and Alameda Research is the market maker associated with FTX, founded by the CEO of FTX, Sam Bickman Fried. And I saw that the comments on the buyers proposal was like this would basically mean because it's supposed to be.
00:09:21.188 - 00:09:25.040, Speaker A: A borrowing and lending protocol. And people were like, okay, if this goes through, nobody's going to use.
00:09:28.690 - 00:09:32.526, Speaker C: Was it was fascinating. But in we've as I mentioned earlier.
00:09:32.558 - 00:09:37.400, Speaker A: We'Ve seen so many of these algorithmic stablecoins DPEG, so why is that so common?
00:09:38.250 - 00:09:40.454, Speaker E: Yeah, so I think the idea is.
00:09:40.492 - 00:09:44.166, Speaker F: That in crypto, there's a lot of.
00:09:44.188 - 00:09:48.546, Speaker E: Different ways to make money. And I think what people have found is that running sort of like grips.
00:09:48.578 - 00:09:51.434, Speaker F: Or scams generally is a good way.
00:09:51.472 - 00:10:02.526, Speaker E: At least in the short term, for these founders and these very short term oriented investors to make money. And at least historically, even though almost every single algorithmic stablecoin, which was not.
00:10:02.548 - 00:10:04.670, Speaker F: Backed by collateral, has so far failed.
00:10:05.170 - 00:10:20.226, Speaker E: Maybe with the exception of Luna, so far, it's still, like, in the process of doing that. Because of these giant pump and dump cycles, a lot of the founders and the investors are able to make a lot of money. So even though there's a lot of failure, and even though everybody kind of.
00:10:20.248 - 00:10:22.498, Speaker F: Understands the risk, with sort of like.
00:10:22.504 - 00:10:25.106, Speaker E: The advent of new capital coming into the space and a lot of new.
00:10:25.128 - 00:10:30.566, Speaker F: People coming into the space, I think there's always, like, a greater fool to.
00:10:30.588 - 00:10:32.038, Speaker E: Sell this kind of product to a.
00:10:32.044 - 00:10:34.598, Speaker F: Repackaged version of this product tool.
00:10:34.764 - 00:10:42.090, Speaker E: And as long as I think these founders and these investors continue to make money, I think that'll continue to happen. So I think it has to do.
00:10:42.160 - 00:10:52.234, Speaker F: With building a mechanism which is basically an obfuscation of basically trying to mint money out of thin air, right, through.
00:10:52.272 - 00:10:57.434, Speaker E: Like the very, very complicated contraption or mechanism or some kind of Rube Goldberg machine.
00:10:57.562 - 00:10:59.486, Speaker F: At the end of the day, you.
00:10:59.508 - 00:11:02.718, Speaker E: Can'T really generate value from nothing, right. And I think that's one of the.
00:11:02.724 - 00:11:05.238, Speaker F: Reasons why ultimately these things fail.
00:11:05.274 - 00:11:08.226, Speaker E: Now each one has a different mechanism, right? So if you look at like, for.
00:11:08.248 - 00:11:17.810, Speaker F: Example, basis in the past ample four ESD DSD ohm, to some extent and time and now like lunatera and waves.
00:11:18.230 - 00:11:30.440, Speaker E: All of these have slightly different mechanisms. But I think in my opinion, they all reduce down to kind of the same thing, which is that you're trying to get this weird flywheel going while basically minting money out of thin air.
00:11:30.830 - 00:11:37.002, Speaker C: So it sounds like you feel that UST then runs the same risks that eventually it will.
00:11:37.136 - 00:11:40.074, Speaker A: Like the way you're talking, it sounds like you feel like all of these.
00:11:40.112 - 00:11:44.510, Speaker C: Algorithmic stablecoins will fail and just none of them will ever succeed.
00:11:45.010 - 00:11:46.574, Speaker F: Yeah, I think at least all of.
00:11:46.612 - 00:11:51.454, Speaker E: These types of designs, right, so like this senior edge based, kind of like.
00:11:51.492 - 00:11:55.886, Speaker F: Supply contraction, supply expansion type of designs.
00:11:56.078 - 00:12:01.182, Speaker E: That don't have any external backing underneath it or any kind of external collateral.
00:12:01.326 - 00:12:04.834, Speaker F: I think pretty much those will all fail. I could be wrong.
00:12:04.872 - 00:12:15.122, Speaker E: I mean, maybe somebody comes up with some genius design and some kind of like skyhook thing that actually works, but for the most part it's all basically variations of the same theme.
00:12:15.186 - 00:12:17.734, Speaker F: Right, so because of that but then.
00:12:17.772 - 00:12:26.810, Speaker C: So UST, since it now is going to be partially backed by bitcoin, are you saying that then you don't think that UST is likely to fall into the same trap?
00:12:27.550 - 00:12:46.386, Speaker E: Yeah, I think that the risks are still there. I actually think the risks are much bigger than waves just because of the size of it. There's like 16.6 billion UST in circulation. I think 12.2 or 4 billion is now stuck in Anchor, so I think it's a much bigger problem. But I will say that I think the backing of having some kind of.
00:12:46.408 - 00:12:49.266, Speaker F: Bitcoin hard collateral or even just like.
00:12:49.288 - 00:13:05.826, Speaker E: Other types of stable coins or even like avalanche as they just did, basically any kind of backing which is not circular I think would be helpful. So I think they're going in the right direction. I just disagree about the size. I don't think a 3 billion amount of bitcoin is enough of a cushion on this kind of unwind on Anchor.
00:13:05.858 - 00:13:12.118, Speaker F: And Anchor is basically the Barn lending protocol. It's the ave of the terra chain.
00:13:12.294 - 00:13:15.980, Speaker C: Yeah, and the yield on that right now is about 20%.
00:13:17.390 - 00:13:18.858, Speaker A: Okay, so in a moment we're going.
00:13:18.864 - 00:13:26.960, Speaker C: To talk about a potential plan to try to make these kinds of stablecoins stronger. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible.

00:15:50.910 - 00:15:56.514, Speaker C: Back to my conversation with Kevin. So, as we've been talking about, Tara.
00:15:56.662 - 00:15:59.134, Speaker A: Might be feeling the heat given what.
00:15:59.172 - 00:16:01.498, Speaker C: Has been happening with these other stablecoins.
00:16:01.674 - 00:16:05.786, Speaker A: And this week we did see a proposal from someone on the TerraForm Labs.
00:16:05.818 - 00:16:11.182, Speaker C: Team, someone named Zan, who proposed something called fourpol.
00:16:11.326 - 00:16:12.702, Speaker A: What is fourpole?
00:16:12.766 - 00:16:16.760, Speaker C: And also, since it uses Curve, why don't you explain what curve is as well?
00:16:17.690 - 00:16:24.370, Speaker F: Yeah, so curve is basically an AMM, and it was originally used for stable swaps.
00:16:24.450 - 00:16:32.614, Speaker E: And what stable swaps are is it's a way to basically transform one stable coin to another with fairly low slippage.
00:16:32.662 - 00:16:34.986, Speaker F: So generally, I think it depends on.
00:16:35.008 - 00:16:36.474, Speaker E: Sort of like the context that your.
00:16:36.512 - 00:16:40.070, Speaker F: Viewers have, but assuming some understanding of uniswap.
00:16:40.150 - 00:16:57.986, Speaker E: It's basically like uniswap, but there's a lot of flatness on the bonding curve where it's kind of close to balance when the pool is kind of close to balance, hence allowing for really large sizes of stablecoins to be swapped against each other at very minimal slippage and minimal fees. So that's sort of what the curve model is.
00:16:58.088 - 00:17:00.498, Speaker F: And the idea behind four pool, I.
00:17:00.504 - 00:17:18.890, Speaker E: Think before that, we should talk about what three pool is because it's sort of like the game plan there is that they want to try and replace three pool, right? So three pool is a curve pool with the assets of USDT, USDC and Dai, right? And it's one of the most liquid pools on Curve.
00:17:19.230 - 00:17:22.234, Speaker F: And it generally not only is it.
00:17:22.272 - 00:17:28.630, Speaker E: Itself very liquid, but it also functions as a counter asset to some of these other stablecoins.
00:17:28.710 - 00:17:37.722, Speaker F: So, for example, right now, if you wanted to trade UST on curve, you could go to the UST three pool pool.
00:17:37.786 - 00:17:43.646, Speaker E: So that's basically a metapool. It's a pool that consists of, on one side, an asset UST, and on.
00:17:43.668 - 00:17:45.986, Speaker F: The other side this three pool, which.
00:17:46.008 - 00:17:48.622, Speaker E: Is itself a pool, right? So that's what makes it a metapool.
00:17:48.686 - 00:17:52.050, Speaker F: So because of three pool's use, first.
00:17:52.120 - 00:17:54.434, Speaker E: As a pool itself, and second, as.
00:17:54.632 - 00:17:57.490, Speaker F: One of the pairs in a know.
00:17:57.560 - 00:18:07.878, Speaker E: Has a lot of use and has a lot of liquidity. And the idea behind four pool and this is a proposal and basically a partnership between the Terra Luna guys and.
00:18:07.964 - 00:18:13.174, Speaker F: FRAX and USDC and UST, as well as Redacted cartel.
00:18:13.302 - 00:18:18.806, Speaker E: And the idea behind this is that they want to have these four assets, right? So the two kind of centralized stablecoins.
00:18:18.838 - 00:18:21.334, Speaker F: That are big, USDC and USD, fracs.
00:18:21.382 - 00:18:28.126, Speaker E: A new algo stablecoin, and then UST Luna's algo stablecoin, and they want to overtake three pool. They want to make this sort of.
00:18:28.148 - 00:18:31.934, Speaker F: The de facto pool where everybody goes.
00:18:31.972 - 00:18:39.874, Speaker E: To everybody uses as a pair in their own metapool for any new kind of stablecoins that come out. And the plan on doing that, and I think it has some merit, which.
00:18:39.912 - 00:18:42.514, Speaker F: Is that they're going to point well.
00:18:42.552 - 00:18:45.054, Speaker E: I guess we should talk a little bit about how convex works.
00:18:45.112 - 00:18:53.334, Speaker F: So both of these groups, FRAX and Terra Luna, have a lot of convex, right? CBX right.
00:18:53.532 - 00:19:12.586, Speaker E: And what that allows them to do is it allows them we're shortcutting a little bit, but basically allows them to point a lot of the rewards of curve. Right. So for using curve or staking to curve, curve itself gives out CRV tokens as an incentive to provide liquidity. But in order to decide which pool.
00:19:12.618 - 00:19:14.894, Speaker F: Gets how much, there is basically a.
00:19:14.932 - 00:19:20.586, Speaker E: Gauge which is voted on based on the state CRV or the Ve CRB.
00:19:20.618 - 00:19:23.278, Speaker F: Vote escort CRV that people hold.
00:19:23.364 - 00:19:28.050, Speaker E: So convix is basically a layer on top of that, long story short, basically.
00:19:28.120 - 00:19:31.794, Speaker F: Governs this kind of voting scheme and.
00:19:31.912 - 00:19:42.646, Speaker E: Can basically increase the yields of certain pools to the detriment of other pools. So in that they hold a lot of convex, both the FRAX guys and the Luna guys, they have a lot.
00:19:42.668 - 00:19:46.214, Speaker F: Of voting power on making their four.
00:19:46.252 - 00:20:02.862, Speaker E: Pool when it comes out, making it have a very high yield. They think that by having that they'll be able to attract a lot of capital from other curve pools to stake into their pool, hence drawing liquidity away from three pool and introducing it to four pool. And in that way, this is basically.
00:20:02.916 - 00:20:05.006, Speaker F: What'S called the curve wars, in that.
00:20:05.028 - 00:20:10.730, Speaker E: Way promote the success of increasing liquidity for their individual tokens.
00:20:10.890 - 00:20:18.402, Speaker C: Yeah, they say that this follows the ethos of stablecoin pegs are stronger together than competing against each other.
00:20:18.536 - 00:20:21.154, Speaker A: But you've been very vocal against four.
00:20:21.192 - 00:20:28.260, Speaker C: Pool and also UST, as we've sort of hinted at previously in the discussion. Why is that?
00:20:28.890 - 00:20:32.534, Speaker F: Yes, I think I should just qualify that and say I have been very.
00:20:32.572 - 00:20:58.554, Speaker E: Vocal against Luna and UST, but not actually against four pool. I think that is actually a good idea. And I think certainly the buying of Bitcoin collateral, even though it's too meager right now, 3 billion, I don't think is enough. I think it's a step in the right direction. So I'm actually fully in support of those two proposals. I don't know if I could say that they're basically trying to cover their asses because things have gotten a little bit too big right now. So I think it's a step in the right direction.
00:20:58.554 - 00:21:01.162, Speaker E: But I still don't think that the entire system is solvent.
00:21:01.226 - 00:21:03.694, Speaker F: I think that right now on anchor.
00:21:03.742 - 00:21:05.406, Speaker E: Which is the ave of the Terra.
00:21:05.438 - 00:21:13.506, Speaker F: Ecosystem, there's a reserve and that's basically bleeding out millions or tens of millions per day.
00:21:13.688 - 00:21:48.206, Speaker E: And it's basically subsidizing depositors to anchor. Right? So if you deposit UST to Anchor, you're getting a 19.5% yield, which is a very high yield, given that currently there's not many, quote unquote, safe ways to farm reasonable like double digit yields. It's basically a subsidy given out to people who bring capital and basically lock up UST. And in the hopes that they think that with this marketing spend, they're actually able to get people to actually use UST. And it's just a way to kind.
00:21:48.228 - 00:21:51.166, Speaker F: Of bring the customer in first, which.
00:21:51.188 - 00:22:14.246, Speaker E: I don't particularly have a problem with. It's just that they are bleeding a lot of money and then at some point that yield has to come down, right? The borrow rate is like 13%, something like that. The lending rate is 19 and a half percent. So there's literally free money there, right? You could bond Luna. There's another problem, which is the bonded Luna. You can bond Luna. You basically pay 13% and you can.
00:22:14.268 - 00:22:16.246, Speaker F: Reinvest the UST that you get from.
00:22:16.268 - 00:22:25.866, Speaker E: Bonding the Luna and staking it to anchor and you can reinvest it into the deposit to just get that extra juice. Right? So anytime the deposit yield is higher.
00:22:25.888 - 00:22:28.102, Speaker F: Than the borrowing yield is generally unsustainable.
00:22:28.246 - 00:22:33.086, Speaker E: So that has to come down at some point. I think they're going to gradually do it. Probably the correct choice to gradually do.
00:22:33.108 - 00:22:35.360, Speaker F: It, but it just won't be enough.
00:22:36.850 - 00:22:42.574, Speaker E: I think the equilibrium yield will be I think they did some analysis on this.
00:22:42.692 - 00:22:44.014, Speaker F: It's going to be somewhere between like.
00:22:44.052 - 00:22:46.766, Speaker E: Seven and 12% on the deposit yield.
00:22:46.878 - 00:22:50.354, Speaker F: And the question now is basically how.
00:22:50.392 - 00:23:05.506, Speaker E: Much of that UST that's currently locked up at 19 and a half percent is going to leave that ecosystem once it drops to seven to 12%, right? So what I think is that generously, and I think it could be my actual advocacy is way worse, much worse.
00:23:05.538 - 00:23:08.054, Speaker F: Than this, but I think generously 9.
00:23:08.092 - 00:23:21.674, Speaker E: Billion Luna has to leave the ecosystem, right? So if 9 billion leaves, and what are the avenues for it to leave? Well, people can dump some of it on curve, but how much can you really do? There maybe half a yard, 500 mil.
00:23:21.872 - 00:23:26.174, Speaker F: Maybe some of it is just not dumped, right?
00:23:26.212 - 00:23:39.074, Speaker E: Maybe people find some other uses of it because their marketing campaign worked, right? So there might be like a bill over there, but overall it's just like a lot of these avenues for exiting out of UST. There's just not much liquidity there, right?
00:23:39.112 - 00:23:42.238, Speaker F: So you're still stuck with multiple billions.
00:23:42.414 - 00:23:52.626, Speaker E: That need to exit. And they can either exit through the bitcoin that they bought is 3 billion, or they can exit through Luna. The 3 billion is covered by bitcoin at.
00:23:52.738 - 00:23:54.774, Speaker F: You're still left with a lot of.
00:23:54.972 - 00:24:01.450, Speaker E: UST, still multiple billions, maybe four, maybe 5 billion of UST left to unwind.
00:24:01.790 - 00:24:02.730, Speaker F: Generally.
00:24:04.510 - 00:24:05.818, Speaker E: I think we should take a.
00:24:05.824 - 00:24:07.210, Speaker F: Step back and talk about this.
00:24:07.360 - 00:24:21.966, Speaker E: Generally, when you buy an asset for every dollar that you use to buy it, the market cap goes up by some multiple. Right. It's not one for one, basically, right. If you buy an Apple stock, if you put like $100 in Apple, apple's market cap jumps by more than $100.
00:24:22.068 - 00:24:29.982, Speaker F: Right. So what exactly is this multiplier value? Well, they've done historical analysis on stonks.
00:24:30.126 - 00:24:32.882, Speaker E: And it's basically three to eight x.
00:24:32.936 - 00:24:35.170, Speaker F: Depending on the elasticity.
00:24:35.670 - 00:24:43.094, Speaker E: For crypto, I think it tends to be on the higher side and maybe even higher than that. And then for something as reflexive as.
00:24:43.132 - 00:24:45.686, Speaker F: The design of this algo stablecoin, I.
00:24:45.708 - 00:24:58.986, Speaker E: Think it might be even beyond that. Right. But even on the conservative side, let's say maybe like an eight x, right? So 5 billion leaving UST through Luna would probably compress the Luna market price by eight times 5 billion, which is.
00:24:59.008 - 00:25:00.438, Speaker F: Maybe like 40 billion.
00:25:00.614 - 00:25:08.654, Speaker E: So I see that there could be, in my opinion, when all of this stuff unwinds, I see that there could.
00:25:08.692 - 00:25:12.142, Speaker F: Be some very serious compression on the Luna price.
00:25:12.276 - 00:25:17.874, Speaker E: Now, that depends also on the Gating mechanism for how much UST can be.
00:25:17.912 - 00:25:20.450, Speaker F: Minted or burned per day for Luna.
00:25:22.150 - 00:25:33.094, Speaker E: If they release all the gates, then basically it's Luna itself that takes on the brunt of all this selling pressure market cap tanks. We could see huge drawdowns on the price there.
00:25:33.292 - 00:25:35.126, Speaker F: Now, if they gate it and they.
00:25:35.148 - 00:25:56.174, Speaker E: Say, okay, only 100 million UST can exit through Luna per day, well, then if more wants to exit per day, then you start to see UST dep. It's really kind of like a pick your poison. If you gate it, then it depegs. If you don't gate it, then the price tanks, right? And in the most extreme cases, where the solvency of the system itself comes.
00:25:56.212 - 00:25:59.614, Speaker F: To question, there might not be enough.
00:25:59.732 - 00:26:10.100, Speaker E: Luna market cap to be solvent for the entire amount of the UST to exit. Right? Because in the absolute worst case, let's say that.
00:26:12.070 - 00:26:13.346, Speaker F: All of the deposits and.
00:26:13.368 - 00:26:14.850, Speaker E: Borrows, they're recycled, right?
00:26:14.920 - 00:26:19.106, Speaker F: So all this 3.3 billion UST that's.
00:26:19.138 - 00:26:30.418, Speaker E: Borrowed is then reinjected as deposits to basically claim this hard on the yield. Then basically the amount that unwinds isn't 9 billion UST. It's like 12.2 billion UST.
00:26:30.514 - 00:26:36.618, Speaker F: Plus 4.8 billion of B Luna, which is bonded, right, because you need to.
00:26:36.624 - 00:26:53.134, Speaker E: Bond B Luna in order to do the borrows in the first place. On this 3.3 billion of UST borrow. So if the unwind is much greater than 9 billion, we're talking about maybe like 1617, maybe 17 billion. And let's say the multiplier factor on.
00:26:53.172 - 00:26:57.074, Speaker F: Selling against market cap is let's say.
00:26:57.112 - 00:26:59.042, Speaker E: Ten or 20 or something like that.
00:26:59.176 - 00:27:00.926, Speaker F: Then the entire system is insolvent.
00:27:00.958 - 00:27:03.714, Speaker E: We're not just talking about a crash in the Luna price.
00:27:03.832 - 00:27:13.334, Speaker F: It's basically Luna goes to zero one penny, $0.01 or zero one dollars and.
00:27:13.372 - 00:27:16.886, Speaker E: Then goes through hyperinflation to try and.
00:27:17.068 - 00:27:19.826, Speaker F: Create enough Luna for a full dollar.
00:27:19.938 - 00:27:23.742, Speaker E: For every dollar that exits. And on top of that, UST. Dpegs.
00:27:23.826 - 00:27:26.186, Speaker F: So in the worst case all of.
00:27:26.208 - 00:27:55.794, Speaker E: That stuff goes to zero altogether, right? So in the best case we're talking about a massive drop in the luna price. In the worst case we're talking about the entire unwinding of the entire system and the contagion effects from that, right? And namely being that when retail gets burned, first of all they go complain to regulators and then second of all the traditional media isn't as kind as you Laura. They're going to take this narrative and they're going to run with it and they already hate crypto so they're just going to slam us. They're going to say oh look at crypto, it's just filled with scams, this, this and that could have a very.
00:27:55.832 - 00:27:58.166, Speaker F: Big chilling effect on the market for.
00:27:58.188 - 00:28:03.622, Speaker E: A very long time. And I for 01:00 a.m. Not that interested in just bearing with like another.
00:28:03.676 - 00:28:06.482, Speaker F: Two, three year super cold crypto winter.
00:28:06.626 - 00:28:08.454, Speaker E: So I think for the most part.
00:28:08.492 - 00:28:11.674, Speaker F: We need to diffuse this bomb as quickly as possible.
00:28:11.792 - 00:28:17.626, Speaker E: If this thing is faded for failure then we might as well unravel it now and we should spread the word.
00:28:17.648 - 00:28:20.294, Speaker F: To unravel it now before becomes too late.
00:28:20.342 - 00:28:25.386, Speaker E: Now obviously the counterargument is that in fact it is not faded to failure. That if they can get enough usage.
00:28:25.418 - 00:28:28.302, Speaker F: Or utility out of UST then that.
00:28:28.356 - 00:28:31.022, Speaker E: Itself, that circulating effect of the actual.
00:28:31.076 - 00:28:43.634, Speaker F: Stablecoin for its use case will basically cause like a supply sink in UST and hence it won't unravel. I generally don't buy that argument. I think there's no real use for.
00:28:43.672 - 00:28:46.162, Speaker E: UST right now in size except for.
00:28:46.216 - 00:28:47.890, Speaker F: Farming on Anchor, right?
00:28:47.960 - 00:28:53.798, Speaker E: So you can literally talk to anybody. Everybody that I know, everybody that I've talked to, many of the firms that.
00:28:53.804 - 00:29:02.902, Speaker F: Are in the space, many of them swinging very big size, a lot of them are farming Anchor and they don't even use it for anything else.
00:29:02.956 - 00:29:09.050, Speaker E: I mean maybe like here and there for an ICO that's on the terra blockchain or whatever. But I mean we're talking like orders of magnitude less, right?
00:29:09.120 - 00:29:11.278, Speaker F: Like here in Anchor we're talking about.
00:29:11.444 - 00:29:13.694, Speaker E: High single digit billions or to low.
00:29:13.732 - 00:29:16.330, Speaker F: Double digit billions elsewhere.
00:29:16.410 - 00:29:25.474, Speaker E: We're talking about at most like double digit millions, maybe triple digit millions at best, right? So we're talking about orders of magnitude difference.
00:29:25.592 - 00:29:28.130, Speaker F: So I understand the play that they're making.
00:29:28.280 - 00:29:32.050, Speaker E: They're basically buying time. They're bleeding money, they're paying marketing costs.
00:29:32.470 - 00:29:38.018, Speaker F: They'Re buying time to try and get actual use from this thing but there's.
00:29:38.034 - 00:29:40.790, Speaker E: Not enough time and I don't think it'll work.
00:29:40.940 - 00:29:55.066, Speaker C: I wanted to ask obviously they're not going to cut the yield on Anchor all in one go down to 12%. So don't you feel that there would be kind of like a gradual way.
00:29:55.088 - 00:29:56.860, Speaker A: To do it where you wouldn't have.
00:29:57.470 - 00:30:12.362, Speaker C: All these people trying to close out their positions in terra and redeem for lunar or whatever super fast and so if you sort of ratchet down slowly. Wouldn't that be a way of preventing the scenario that you outlined?
00:30:12.506 - 00:30:13.326, Speaker F: I agree with you.
00:30:13.348 - 00:30:50.534, Speaker E: I think if they reduce the yield slowly, it'll be better. But overall, the net effect is nearly the same because it's about the amount that has to unravel over time to settle on, finally, an equilibrium point for what the yield should be on the deposit side, such that the reserve doesn't bleed. So I agree that it may be a little bit more gentler, but still, a lot of this money has to kind of leave, because if you think about it, they're sort of like marginal sellers along the way, right? Like at 19.5%, everybody who is in it is in it. Right. At 19%, some marginal group leaves, right. It might be small, but some marginal group leaves.
00:30:50.582 - 00:30:50.890, Speaker F: Right.
00:30:50.960 - 00:31:01.566, Speaker E: And then 18 and a half, then some marginal group leaves. If you sum up all the marginal groups, is that the same effect as immediately taking the deposit yield from 19 and a half to twelve?
00:31:01.668 - 00:31:02.030, Speaker C: Right.
00:31:02.100 - 00:31:16.280, Speaker E: So, on one hand, I agree with you in the sense that it's not as bad. I think the sum of the parts is actually less than having an immediate drop. I think the sum is actually less than the whole, but I don't think it's that much less than the whole.
00:31:16.970 - 00:31:48.430, Speaker C: Okay, well, this has been incredibly interesting. I guess we'll have to see kind of who ends up being right. Obviously, there's kind of a lot vested on one particular side, so they're probably thinking a lot about these issues and maybe trying to take your criticism and improve before anything bad happens. Well, it seems like that already. But anyway, yeah, it's much appreciated. Yeah, it's been great having you. Thanks so much for coming on Unchained.
00:31:48.850 - 00:31:49.966, Speaker E: Yeah, thanks for having me.
00:31:49.988 - 00:31:51.134, Speaker F: I appreciate it.

00:32:32.190 - 00:33:22.350, Speaker A: Thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap. Ronan will be reimbursing users eight days after losing $600 million to the largest exploit in DFI history, sky Mavis announced plans to reimburse all affected Ronan network bridge users. Sky Mavis will be raising $150,000,000 in a funding round led by Finance, with participation from Animoca Brands, A 16, Z, and others. That $150,000,000 in cash, along with balance sheet funds already owned by sky mavis, will replace the 173, 600 ether and 25.5 million USDC that was drained from the Ronan bridge last week in a social engineering attack that saw four of sky mavis run validators and a third party validator run by axie dow compromised.
00:33:22.850 - 00:33:24.462, Speaker C: The news comes just a few months.
00:33:24.516 - 00:33:34.490, Speaker A: After the wormhole bridge announced a similar reimbursement funding round from jump crypto following a 300 million dollar exploit. In the aftermath, Ronan Bridge will be.
00:33:34.500 - 00:33:37.426, Speaker C: Upgrading its security, which previously relied on.
00:33:37.448 - 00:34:33.038, Speaker A: Only five out of nine validator confirmations for a transaction to go through. According to a Sky Mavis blog post, the new validator group will be upped to 21 validators in the next three months, split amongst various stakeholders. Rather than just Sky Mavis, Ronan Bridge, which was shut down in the aftermath of last week's hack, will go live after a round of upgrades and audits that could take weeks. Meanwhile, Binance will be supporting ETH withdrawals and deposits from Ronan. Interestingly, the 56,000 ETH drained from Axidao will not be fully reimbursed by Finance or Sky Mavis's balance sheet. Instead, Sky Mavis explained the 56,000 ETH compromised from the Axidao Treasury will remain under collateralized as Sky Mavis works with law enforcement to recover the funds. If the funds are not fully recovered within two years, the Axidao will vote on next steps for the treasury.
00:34:33.038 - 00:34:39.842, Speaker A: In related news, the Ronan Bridge hacker was active this week, moving roughly $7 million through the coin mixer.
00:34:39.906 - 00:34:44.386, Speaker C: Tornado cash stablecoins are coming to bitcoin.
00:34:44.578 - 00:35:34.946, Speaker A: Lightning Labs, a Lightning network developer, announced a new protocol this week dubbed Tarot, which aims to make bitcoin's layer two solution a multiasset network, as explained by Lightning Lab CEO Elizabeth Stark in a blog post. In essence, Tarot's purpose is to Bitcoinize the dollar, Stark wrote. With Tarot, developers will be able to issue assets on the bitcoin blockchain and then move them onto Lightning for speed and scalability, making use of bitcoin liquidity to ensure interoperability between assets. Notably, according to Stark, Taro will also allow assets like stablecoins to route through the bitcoin network via Lightning. Interestingly, Terra was only recently made possible by bitcoin's taproot upgrade, which made significant improvements to contracting security and efficiency for the chain.
00:35:35.138 - 00:35:38.418, Speaker C: Fun fact the launch of Tarot was.
00:35:38.444 - 00:36:22.054, Speaker A: On April 5, aka Satoshi's birthday, the same day that Roosevelt ordered US citizens to return gold worth more than $100 for fiat in 1933. Major raises was the theme of the week. Crypto funding continued its rampant pace this week in conjunction with a Tarot announcement. Lightning Labs raised $70 million in a Series B funding round led by Valor Equity Partners and Bailey Gifford. Other participants included Robin Hood CEO Vlad Tenev, crypto infrastructure firm NYDIG and Brevin Howard. Lightning Labs did not disclose the valuation. Finance US raised a 200 million dollar funding round at a valuation of $4.5
00:36:22.054 - 00:37:07.570, Speaker A: billion, pre money. The block reports that a binance US spokesperson revealed that the exchange wants to raise more in the coming months and plans to go public in the next two to three years. Near Protocol announced a second nine digit raise in under three months on Wednesday. The protocol is bringing in $350,000,000 in a round led by tiger Global to decentralize the near ecosystem. Near foundation announced a $150,000,000 raise in mid January to support DFI development. Disclosure Near Protocol is a previous sponsor of this podcast. Boba Network, An Ethereum scaling solution, secured $45 million in a Series A, giving the protocol a unicorn valuation of $1.5
00:37:07.570 - 00:37:43.254, Speaker A: billion. Blockchain security firm Certec announced an $88 million funding round that saw participation from traditional behemoths like Tiger Global, Goldman Sachs and Sequoia Capital. Cerdic is now valued at $2 billion. Crypto payments firm Wire was acquired by Bolt in a deal valued at roughly $1.5 billion, reports the Block. The UK plans to be a global crypto leader. On Tuesday, Rishi Sunak, the UK's chancellor, laid out plans to make the UK a global crypto asset technology hub.
00:37:43.254 - 00:38:18.780, Speaker A: The UK is set to make moves to regulate stablecoins, introduce an infrastructure sandbox for crypto firms to experiment, establish a crypto asset engagement group, and explore UK crypto taxes. Notably, the UK announced that the Royal Mint would be creating an NFT project this summer. It's my ambition to make the UK a global hub for crypto asset technology, said Sunak. Somewhat contradictorily, the news comes as the UK's Financial Conduct Authority is reluctant to give firms such as Blockchain.com antimoney laundering licenses, leading many firms to pull out of the crypto asset licensing process.
00:38:19.950 - 00:38:23.898, Speaker C: Another week, Another multimillion dollar hack Inverse.
00:38:23.914 - 00:39:00.258, Speaker A: Finance, an ethereum lending protocol, lost $15 million to an exploit this week, making it the 34th largest hack in the DFI space, according to Rect. The manipulation was not a flash loan attack and was unrelated to Inverse's smart contract or front end code, wrote the team. Instead, the hack involved a capital intensive manipulation of the invayer price Oracle on SushiSwap. Once the Oracle was tricked into showing a fraudulently high price for inv, the hacker was able to borrow $15.6 million worth of Dola, WBTC and WiFi.
00:39:00.434 - 00:39:01.738, Speaker C: For those of you who missed out.
00:39:01.744 - 00:39:25.406, Speaker A: On this week's episode of The Chopping Block, I recommend listening as Tarun Chitra and Tom Schmidt do a great job of explaining how the price manipulation worked and how the hacker pulled it off in a single block. The Inverse Finance team has committed to reimbursing all affected users and is currently trying to figure out the most efficient way to repay users without affecting the peg of Dola inverse finance's algorithmic.
00:39:25.438 - 00:39:28.626, Speaker C: Stablecoin the headline for this section could.
00:39:28.648 - 00:39:43.270, Speaker A: Have been about a multibillion dollar hack. According to Open Zeppelin, the security firm uncovered and resolved a bug on Convex Finance that could have resulted in a $15 billion rug pool due to how Convex's multisig was configured.
00:39:43.690 - 00:39:44.198, Speaker C: Again.
00:39:44.284 - 00:39:55.610, Speaker A: For more information, watch this week's episode of The Chopping Block, which talks about how OpenZeppelin forced Convex Finance to add members to its multi stake before revealing the critical bug.
00:39:56.590 - 00:40:02.246, Speaker C: The SEC approved a new bitcoin ETF but the US.
00:40:02.288 - 00:41:24.582, Speaker A: Securities and Exchange Commission approved a new bitcoin futures ETF from Nizi, Arca and Tucrium on Wednesday, as reported by CoinDesk. Bloomberg's senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunis called it a good sign regarding the approval of a spot bitcoin ETF because previous Bitcoin Futures ETFs were approved under the Investment Company Act of 1940. While the Nic, Arca and Tucrium ETF is the first Bitcoin Futures ETF to gain approval from the SEC under the securities act of 1933, this is a market change. According to an early January thread from Bloomberg's James Seafort, the approval of an ETF under the 1933 act would hinder some of the SEC's arguments against spot bitcoin ETFs due to CME futures not being of significant size, subject to manipulation, et cetera. Interestingly, Seafort notes that the pricing methodology for futures and spot bitcoin ETFs will be the same, meaning the futures the SEC has approved are based on the pricing from exchanges that they say are subject to manipulation. In related SEC crypto news, SEC Chair Gary Gensler called for further SEC oversight on stablecoins in a speech on April 4. The three largest stablecoins were created by trading or lending platforms themselves, and US.
00:41:24.582 - 00:42:25.610, Speaker A: Retail investors have no direct right of redemption for the two largest stablecoins by market capitalization. There are conflicts of interest and market integrity questions that would benefit from more oversight, said Gensler. During the same speech, Gensler revealed that the SEC is working with the CFTC to potentially split duties regarding crypto purview. I've asked staff to work with the Commodity Future Trading Commission on how we jointly might address such platforms that might trade both crypto based security tokens and some commodity tokens, said Gensler. FTX US CEO Brian Harrison told the Decrypt Daily Podcast that the exchange is holding back from listing assets due to regulatory uncertainty regarding crypto tokens and securities law, which is spearheaded by the SEC. FTX US only supports 27 assets in comparison to FTX's 322. According to new guidelines, the SEC wants crypto exchanges to treat customer crypto holdings as liabilities on their balance sheet.
00:42:25.610 - 00:43:22.640, Speaker A: In related news, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen made her first speech about digital assets on Thursday in which he called Crypto Transformative. Bitcoin 2022 bitcoin's annual conference in Miami took place this week. In an onbrand move, the festivities were kicked off with Miami Mayor Francis Suarez unveiling an eleven foot, 3000 pound laser eyed robot bull statue. The event featured speakers such as peter thiel, Jordan Peterson and Jack Mallors. However, one prominent speaker, El Salvador's President Naim Bukele, canceled his appearance at the event due to unforeseen circumstances in his home country. On Thursday, Bitcoin 2022 experienced its first big announcement when Robin Hood Chief Product Officer Aparna. Chenna Pragada told the audience that the trading platform had activated crypto wallet functionality for 2 million customers.
00:43:22.640 - 00:44:21.386, Speaker A: Users will now be able to send BTC, ETH and Doge to self custody wallets. Robinhood will also add support for Lightning network. In other bitcoin news, two of the most prominent SATS stackers did what they do best this week they bought more bitcoin on April 5, MacroStrategy, the subsidiary of MicroStrategy, purchased an additional 4167 BTC, or $190,000,000 worth. And on the 6th, Luna Foundation guard added roughly 5040 BTC, or $231,000,000, to its $1 billion plus stack. In related Terra news, TerraForm Labs announced a 100 million dollar token swap of Luna to AVAX on Thursday between TerraForm and Avalanche Foundation. Time for fun bits. A novel Dow experiment Tweet Dow caught my attention this week due to a fun twist on NFT utility.
00:44:21.386 - 00:44:58.594, Speaker A: The Dow sold a batch of 1000 NFTs, each depicting the iconic Twitter egg, giving holders the ability to tweet once per day from the official Tweet Dow Twitter account with absolutely no restrictions. As this is Crypto Twitter, the content is still a bit unhinged, but somewhat humorous. The NFTs for those interested are selling for a floor price of zero 3119 ETH. For those who need a smile, I would recommend giving Tweet Dow's feed a scroll. It's quite funny. Thanks so much for joining us today.
