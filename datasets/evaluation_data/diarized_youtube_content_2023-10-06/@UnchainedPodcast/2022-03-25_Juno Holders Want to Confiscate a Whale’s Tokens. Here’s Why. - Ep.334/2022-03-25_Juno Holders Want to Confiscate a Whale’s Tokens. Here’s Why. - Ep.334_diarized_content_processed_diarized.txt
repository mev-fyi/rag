00:03:36.430 - 00:03:38.180, Speaker B: Hey, Laura, thanks for having me.
00:03:38.710 - 00:03:58.700, Speaker A: Everyone's been a buz about the drama with a smart contract blockchain in Cosmos called Juno, which launched in October. And this saga involves a big whale in that ecosystem. Tell us what happened in the beginning. It all started with Juno's AirDrop. Give us the context of what happened at that time.
00:03:59.390 - 00:04:02.218, Speaker C: Yeah, so the background for the story.
00:04:02.304 - 00:04:05.194, Speaker B: Actually started in the fall of last year.
00:04:05.232 - 00:04:08.234, Speaker C: So Juno, like a lot of new.
00:04:08.272 - 00:04:11.566, Speaker B: Projects in the Cosmos ecosystem, announced what.
00:04:11.588 - 00:04:37.174, Speaker C: They call a stake drop, which is where they AirDrop tokens to existing wallets that are staking atoms. And it also applied to wallets that were providing liquidity into osmosis too, but wallets that have some sort of locked stake in the ecosystem that Juno is building on top of. And it was a very generous AirDrop, it was a one for one.
00:04:37.212 - 00:04:40.658, Speaker B: So if you had 10,000 atoms staked.
00:04:40.674 - 00:04:42.440, Speaker C: In your wallet, you would get 10,000.
00:04:42.970 - 00:04:47.698, Speaker B: Juno airdropped to you. And the team very sort of wisely.
00:04:47.794 - 00:04:51.226, Speaker C: Imposed a whale cap of 50,000.
00:04:51.328 - 00:04:55.094, Speaker B: So even if you have 100,000 atoms.
00:04:55.142 - 00:05:35.986, Speaker C: Staked in your wallet, you were only going to get 50,000 Juno. That was the absolute maximum per person, per entity because they wanted to ensure a healthy distribution of the token, which is a pretty reasonable concern for any core team to have when they're thinking about token distribution and launch. Now, the snapshot for that was taken back in February of last year. So seven months before the AirDrop actually happened in October, the Juno team took a snapshot of all the wallets that were currently staking atoms and providing liquidity into osmosis. And so you had to have your atoms staked as of February. Shortly after the AirDrop, the Juno core.
00:05:36.018 - 00:05:40.314, Speaker B: Team and the community saw a group.
00:05:40.352 - 00:06:04.818, Speaker C: Of wallets, 52 in total, I believe consolidate airdropped Juno tokens into one address. And the majority of these 52 wallets had received the maximum 50,000 Juno. So they had received up to the whale cap. And in total, this consolidated wallet had.
00:06:04.904 - 00:06:07.874, Speaker B: Two and a half million Juno, an.
00:06:07.912 - 00:06:15.742, Speaker C: Order of magnitude above what the team intended to give to any single individual or entity.
00:06:15.806 - 00:06:17.746, Speaker B: And so they realized that there was.
00:06:17.768 - 00:06:19.954, Speaker C: A massive whale now in their ecosystem.
00:06:20.082 - 00:06:27.526, Speaker B: That controlled a large portion of the token supply. And so two issues off the bat, right? One, it violates the spirit of the.
00:06:27.548 - 00:06:30.406, Speaker C: AirDrop because they had very explicitly imposed.
00:06:30.518 - 00:06:43.054, Speaker B: A cap and the cap was known. It also poses some real risks to the network, especially if this whale doesn't have the best interests of the network at heart, right?
00:06:43.092 - 00:06:49.754, Speaker C: They control a significant amount of token supply that impacts their voting power. They also control a lot of liquidity.
00:06:49.882 - 00:06:53.886, Speaker B: They can delegate their stake and centralize the network.
00:06:53.918 - 00:07:03.810, Speaker C: So there's a lot of very reasonable concerns that the Juno core team and community were immediately worried about.
00:07:03.960 - 00:07:12.902, Speaker B: So in October, when they realized this, the community reacted pretty quickly and within.
00:07:12.956 - 00:07:16.150, Speaker C: A matter of days had put together a governance proposal.
00:07:16.730 - 00:07:23.610, Speaker B: And this was proposal number four, but we can call it the first proposal for purposes of this discussion.
00:07:24.110 - 00:07:29.434, Speaker C: And that proposal was seeking to confiscate 90% of these whales tokens and then.
00:07:29.472 - 00:07:31.210, Speaker B: Send them to a community pool.
00:07:31.370 - 00:07:35.966, Speaker C: And this was the community's attempt to.
00:07:35.988 - 00:07:39.098, Speaker B: Sort of get back to neutral that's.
00:07:39.114 - 00:07:55.170, Speaker A: Such an unusual step, was that controversial at all? Or was the consensus just that what this whale had done was so egregious and had basically cheated and flouted the rules that that was what they had to do, or kind of what was the talk at that time about that potential decision?
00:07:56.170 - 00:08:09.946, Speaker C: So, based on the community discussion on the forums, over other social media channels, it seemed like just the existence of the whale and any single person or.
00:08:09.968 - 00:08:13.738, Speaker B: Entity having that significant stake in the.
00:08:13.744 - 00:08:26.574, Speaker C: Network is just this it poses this existential threat, right. There's always this thing behind your shoulder that could start to impact things, liquidity voting, centralization, et cetera. And so I think the community just.
00:08:26.612 - 00:08:30.218, Speaker B: Wanted to deal with this, otherwise it's.
00:08:30.234 - 00:08:32.126, Speaker C: A risk that's always out there that.
00:08:32.148 - 00:08:33.470, Speaker B: You'Re always worrying about.
00:08:33.620 - 00:08:35.602, Speaker A: Yeah, like a ticking time bomb type thing.
00:08:35.656 - 00:08:46.494, Speaker C: Exactly. And you also have to think about, do we need to continuously sort of appease this whale to make sure that they're happy and they don't do anything to negatively impact the network?
00:08:46.542 - 00:08:47.380, Speaker B: Too right.
00:08:47.750 - 00:08:54.406, Speaker C: So maybe you start to cater your decision making as a community to make this one large token holder happy right.
00:08:54.428 - 00:08:55.478, Speaker B: Which you don't want.
00:08:55.644 - 00:08:57.766, Speaker C: So the first time the Juno community.
00:08:57.868 - 00:09:01.994, Speaker B: Tried to resolve the whale issue, they.
00:09:02.032 - 00:09:05.130, Speaker C: Wanted to confiscate or reclaim 90% of the tokens.
00:09:05.470 - 00:09:10.894, Speaker B: They were going to put those into a community fund. And the discussion around this was, did.
00:09:10.932 - 00:09:17.070, Speaker C: The whale intentionally game the AirDrop? That was one consideration.
00:09:17.810 - 00:09:18.846, Speaker B: And then there was part of the.
00:09:18.868 - 00:09:31.522, Speaker C: Community that, irrespective of whether they intentionally did it or not, right. It violated the spirit of the AirDrop and they essentially came into an amount of tokens that they should never have come into.
00:09:31.576 - 00:09:32.180, Speaker B: Right.
00:09:32.630 - 00:09:36.354, Speaker C: Once this proposal was posted, the whale.
00:09:36.402 - 00:09:41.894, Speaker B: Actually reached out to the Juno team and explained their position.
00:09:42.012 - 00:09:55.098, Speaker C: And so at the time, what the community learned was that the whale was actually not an individual, it was a fund or a platform that was holding atoms. And now Juno, on behalf of their.
00:09:55.184 - 00:09:58.906, Speaker B: Clients or users, they had distributed all.
00:09:58.928 - 00:10:15.042, Speaker C: The tokens across these 52 wallets, largely for security purposes. And so if you were confiscating funds, you weren't actually just confiscating the whales funds, you were actually confiscating their users clients funds. And they also tried to assuage the concerns of the community at the time.
00:10:15.096 - 00:10:22.898, Speaker B: By letting everyone know that they had no intention of threatening centralization and they.
00:10:22.904 - 00:10:24.306, Speaker C: Had the best interest of the network at heart.
00:10:24.328 - 00:10:27.438, Speaker B: And in October, I think the arguments.
00:10:27.454 - 00:10:29.238, Speaker C: That the whale was putting forth, I.
00:10:29.244 - 00:10:32.694, Speaker B: Think the community was buying. And so for a period of time.
00:10:32.732 - 00:10:41.754, Speaker C: They were comfortable with the fact that the whale was going to be a positive impact on the Juno ecosystem and.
00:10:41.792 - 00:10:44.586, Speaker B: Wasn'T going to throw their weight around like they could.
00:10:44.768 - 00:10:53.950, Speaker A: And a couple of weeks ago, the situation changed. So what happened that then prompted the community to kind of revisit this idea of taking the whales tokens?
00:10:54.530 - 00:11:04.786, Speaker C: Fast forward six months, from October to March, now 2022, and up until this point, the whale has followed through on.
00:11:04.808 - 00:11:21.718, Speaker B: Their promise to the community to respect decentralization and largely be sort of a passive sort of member of the community. In March, though, the behavior starts to change and the community sees that the.
00:11:21.724 - 00:11:27.090, Speaker C: Whale is now starting to sell on a daily basis, their staking rewards.
00:11:27.250 - 00:11:29.766, Speaker B: Now, for any other person, this doesn't.
00:11:29.798 - 00:11:39.850, Speaker C: Raise a red flag, but because the whale is earning such a large percentage of the daily staking rewards, I think their rewards were half a million dollars.
00:11:39.920 - 00:11:42.730, Speaker B: A day for a relatively new project.
00:11:42.800 - 00:12:02.894, Speaker C: Like Juno that doesn't have deep liquidity across the ecosystem. This is a lot of sell pressure on the market, and the community would have liked to see that the whale continue to restake their assets. Right? That would be a great signal that they were invested in the long term success of Juno as opposed to just short term gains.
00:12:02.942 - 00:12:03.394, Speaker B: Right.
00:12:03.512 - 00:12:33.642, Speaker A: So in a moment we're going to talk about what the community decided to do at this point in time.

Back to my conversation with Andy. So we're in this situation where suddenly the community realizes, okay, the impact of this wheel is a negative one. So what do they decide to do at that point?
00:13:40.870 - 00:13:43.986, Speaker C: So the community quickly mobilizes and all.
00:13:44.008 - 00:13:54.818, Speaker B: The fears from October come back and they decide to kind of revisit the proposal for this is now called Prop 16.
00:13:54.914 - 00:13:58.540, Speaker C: So if you're looking for this in the forums or online, for more information.
00:13:58.990 - 00:14:02.810, Speaker B: Juno Prop 16 is proposed and similar.
00:14:02.880 - 00:14:09.162, Speaker C: Terms to the original proposal, except this time they want to not confiscate 90%.
00:14:09.216 - 00:14:11.526, Speaker B: They want to confiscate all the whale's.
00:14:11.558 - 00:14:36.966, Speaker C: Assets except for 50,000. So they want to leave the whale with the original 50K whale cap. This is now 98.5% of the whale's assets. And the interesting thing about this, too is that from October to March, the price of Juno has gone from, let's say an average of seven to $10, up to $40 to $45. Right? So the whale's financial stake in the.
00:14:36.988 - 00:14:41.606, Speaker B: Network is now roughly $140,000,000.
00:14:41.788 - 00:14:48.458, Speaker C: So a significant amount of money. Now this obviously raises the stakes of.
00:14:48.544 - 00:14:53.146, Speaker B: The community's decision here, and also for.
00:14:53.168 - 00:14:55.642, Speaker C: Those listening to it, it raises some really interesting questions.
00:14:55.696 - 00:14:55.866, Speaker B: Right?
00:14:55.888 - 00:14:57.478, Speaker C: The first one is just why can't.
00:14:57.494 - 00:15:01.626, Speaker B: The whale sell immediately if they know.
00:15:01.648 - 00:15:06.126, Speaker C: That the community is going to vote to confiscate their funds? And the answer to that one is.
00:15:06.148 - 00:15:09.562, Speaker B: That they are currently staking their assets.
00:15:09.626 - 00:15:18.706, Speaker C: And there's a 28 day unbonding period in Juno, or unstaking period, and so they are locked up for four weeks.
00:15:18.808 - 00:15:25.942, Speaker B: And so that's the window of opportunity that the Tuna community has to issue.
00:15:25.996 - 00:15:32.166, Speaker C: A proposal, vote on it, and then remediate the situation. So there's a shot clock component here.
00:15:32.188 - 00:15:38.586, Speaker B: Which is somewhat unique to these situations. The other interesting question is can't the.
00:15:38.608 - 00:15:41.194, Speaker C: Whale throw their voting weight around to.
00:15:41.232 - 00:15:43.946, Speaker B: Influence the vote here and get the.
00:15:43.968 - 00:15:49.574, Speaker C: Outcome that they want? Yes. But they don't control enough to push.
00:15:49.702 - 00:15:59.070, Speaker B: Through a vote, or in this case, to vote down this proposal by themselves. And then the third question is practically.
00:15:59.490 - 00:16:10.402, Speaker C: How does a community seize tokens from an individual wallet? The obvious way to do it is with a hard fork, and we can get into that a little bit later when we talk about what the community.
00:16:10.456 - 00:16:18.818, Speaker B: Is doing to actually affect this change. After five days of pretty contentious discussion.
00:16:18.914 - 00:16:27.320, Speaker C: On forums, prop 16 is approved by the Juno community.
00:16:27.710 - 00:16:31.434, Speaker B: And interestingly, I think this is something.
00:16:31.472 - 00:16:33.366, Speaker C: That I'd love to talk with you about, Laura.
00:16:33.478 - 00:16:36.118, Speaker B: Prop 16 was just a text proposal.
00:16:36.214 - 00:16:42.910, Speaker C: So the community was sort of agreeing to a concept about what to do.
00:16:43.060 - 00:16:45.886, Speaker B: But it wasn't a software proposal that.
00:16:45.908 - 00:16:52.438, Speaker C: Could be immediately implemented. So now that the text proposal is approved, now the community needs to decide.
00:16:52.554 - 00:16:56.050, Speaker B: How do we actually affect this change.
00:16:56.120 - 00:17:04.210, Speaker C: That the community voted yes for? And it's opened the door to a bunch of other discussions and alternative proposals.
00:17:04.790 - 00:17:11.094, Speaker A: But is a hard fork one of them? Well, why don't you give us a quick overview of what those options would be?
00:17:11.292 - 00:17:22.886, Speaker B: So there's three sort of implementation proposals right now. One is very much in line with sort of the original intention of Prop 16.
00:17:23.078 - 00:17:26.794, Speaker C: So they want to immediately undelegate and.
00:17:26.832 - 00:17:37.694, Speaker B: Unstake the whales assets, and then they would burn them. They would send them to an address with a contract address of zero and.
00:17:37.732 - 00:17:39.566, Speaker C: Burn them so the tokens would be.
00:17:39.588 - 00:17:41.658, Speaker B: Effectively out of circulation.
00:17:41.834 - 00:17:54.542, Speaker C: The second proposal, which actually was put together by the core team at Juno, is a slight deviation from that plan, which would actually put the whale's assets.
00:17:54.606 - 00:17:57.470, Speaker B: Into an escrow account that both the.
00:17:57.480 - 00:18:01.366, Speaker C: Whale and the community would control. So you can think about this like.
00:18:01.388 - 00:18:03.894, Speaker B: A multi SIG, and the funds would.
00:18:03.932 - 00:18:09.634, Speaker C: Sit in that escrow account until all parties could agree on what to do with those assets.
00:18:09.682 - 00:18:12.122, Speaker B: So this is sort of a plan.
00:18:12.176 - 00:18:21.022, Speaker C: To delay the decision about what to do with the assets. Do we give them back to the community? Do we burn them, but we want to take them out of the hands.
00:18:21.076 - 00:18:36.786, Speaker B: Of the whale in the meantime, put them in a neutral escrow account? The third proposal is actually from the whale themselves, and they actually proposed an.
00:18:36.808 - 00:18:39.858, Speaker C: Amended version of the core teams that I just went through that had the.
00:18:39.864 - 00:18:46.894, Speaker B: Escrow component because they want to maintain the right to vote in the meantime.
00:18:46.942 - 00:18:49.154, Speaker C: So while the assets, while their confiscated.
00:18:49.202 - 00:18:51.686, Speaker B: Assets sit in an escrow account, they.
00:18:51.708 - 00:18:55.510, Speaker C: Want to maintain the ability to vote. And the reason they're asking for that.
00:18:55.660 - 00:18:58.754, Speaker B: Right, is so that it puts pressure.
00:18:58.802 - 00:19:11.306, Speaker C: On the community to actually push for a resolution rather than just locking up the funds in escrow in perpetuity and just sitting on their hands and not doing anything, right, which is effectively the.
00:19:11.328 - 00:19:14.142, Speaker B: Same thing as burning the tokens, right?
00:19:14.196 - 00:19:22.126, Speaker A: Right. So at the moment, where is the community leaning? And also, I realize we didn't really go into who this whale is, so.
00:19:22.148 - 00:19:26.238, Speaker B: Can you also give that context without sharing any names?
00:19:26.414 - 00:19:30.210, Speaker C: I think the whale has shared their name online.
00:19:30.360 - 00:19:34.594, Speaker B: They claim to be an exchange or.
00:19:34.632 - 00:19:38.518, Speaker C: A platform that holds assets for their.
00:19:38.604 - 00:19:42.386, Speaker B: Users, though, and if my memory serves.
00:19:42.418 - 00:19:47.670, Speaker C: Me correctly, they claim to have over 30,000 users.
00:19:48.110 - 00:19:51.580, Speaker B: And so that's another interesting element to this.
00:19:52.190 - 00:19:53.946, Speaker C: You have to ask yourself the question.
00:19:54.128 - 00:19:57.626, Speaker B: Are you confiscating an entity's assets or.
00:19:57.648 - 00:20:05.482, Speaker C: Are you confiscating assets that are collectively owned by 30,000 people, some of which just may be ordinary?
00:20:05.626 - 00:20:09.546, Speaker B: Retail traders who are expecting these Juno.
00:20:09.578 - 00:20:19.422, Speaker C: Tokens, right, and really haven't been involved in the process. Weren't responsible for gaming the AirDrop, weren't responsible for how the original atoms were delegated across wallets.
00:20:19.486 - 00:20:23.554, Speaker B: Right. So you don't want to unintentionally harm them either.
00:20:23.752 - 00:20:34.054, Speaker A: And why wouldn't you just name them if they've named themselves online? I don't understand. That's public information, so we can freely discuss it here. Are you saying that there's a question about whether or not that's accurate or.
00:20:34.092 - 00:20:38.566, Speaker B: What'S your no, I'll be honest, I.
00:20:38.588 - 00:20:41.238, Speaker C: Can look it up. I don't have the name memorized. Yeah, that's that's all.
00:20:41.254 - 00:20:42.474, Speaker B: All, okay.
00:20:42.512 - 00:20:43.446, Speaker A: It's CCN.
00:20:43.558 - 00:20:43.978, Speaker B: Yes.
00:20:44.064 - 00:20:50.560, Speaker A: Okay, got it. So at the moment, which way are people leaning out of the three options?
00:20:51.410 - 00:20:53.518, Speaker C: So there seems to be a lot.
00:20:53.524 - 00:20:55.950, Speaker B: Of support behind the core teams proposal.
00:20:56.530 - 00:21:06.786, Speaker C: Which is a, you know, it has both validator support, core dev support, and support from the community. This is the escrow account proposal, and.
00:21:06.808 - 00:21:10.366, Speaker B: I think there's acknowledgment that this Prop.
00:21:10.398 - 00:21:19.254, Speaker C: 16 was done pretty hastily. There was obviously a lot of urgency here. And so I don't think anyone is angry that it moved as fast as it did, but at the same time.
00:21:19.372 - 00:21:23.046, Speaker B: This is a sensitive issue and you.
00:21:23.068 - 00:21:37.610, Speaker C: Want to come to a sort of thoughtful resolution. And so if the escrow account model gives the community and the whale more time to come to consensus, then there's a large part of the Juno community.
00:21:37.680 - 00:21:39.818, Speaker B: That is supportive of that.
00:21:39.904 - 00:21:46.174, Speaker C: They are not supportive of giving the whale the right to continue voting their stake while it's in escrow, right?
00:21:46.212 - 00:21:49.754, Speaker B: Because they still can control decisions.
00:21:49.882 - 00:22:03.666, Speaker C: And then you have your purists of the Juno community that want to respect sort of the letter of the law that was stated in Prop 16, which is, we're going to confiscate and burn these assets and we only want to.
00:22:03.688 - 00:22:10.600, Speaker B: Consider remediation plans that confiscate and burn these assets. So not in favor of the escrow account.
00:22:11.050 - 00:22:16.198, Speaker C: My prediction is that the escrow account model will get approved, but we don't.
00:22:16.204 - 00:22:21.242, Speaker B: Have a formal proposal submitted for a vote. Just and so what are your big.
00:22:21.296 - 00:22:35.040, Speaker A: Takeaways for blockchains facing similar issues in the know? What do you think Juno could have done differently with its, like, how do you think this whale CCN could have handled the situation better? What are your thoughts on all that?
00:22:35.490 - 00:22:45.162, Speaker B: It's a good lesson for teams that are considering airdrops and mechanisms for know.
00:22:45.236 - 00:22:51.010, Speaker C: The original sort of justification for the whale distributing their assets across different wallets.
00:22:51.510 - 00:22:54.466, Speaker B: Is a reasonable one and one that.
00:22:54.488 - 00:23:04.454, Speaker C: You see a lot of larger platforms take. So to the extent that this really is an exchange or a custodian or some other trading platform that does have.
00:23:04.492 - 00:23:08.866, Speaker B: 30,000 users and are holding assets for.
00:23:08.908 - 00:23:20.782, Speaker C: Them, expecting those types of investors to pool all their assets into a single wallet obviously isn't reasonable. And so there's always going to be the possibility, right, that there's a single.
00:23:20.836 - 00:23:25.178, Speaker B: Entity that controls multiple addresses.
00:23:25.274 - 00:23:27.326, Speaker C: What you can do, and this might.
00:23:27.348 - 00:23:29.806, Speaker B: Not be the most popular approach, but.
00:23:29.828 - 00:23:40.834, Speaker C: You can impose more strict KYC processes as part of the claiming process of the stake drop. So when you're proving who you are and that you have control of the.
00:23:40.872 - 00:23:45.854, Speaker B: Wallets, juno could have asked the entity.
00:23:45.902 - 00:24:23.666, Speaker C: That controls the wallet for more information about themselves, right? And that way you could start to piece together, okay, this particular entity controls 52 wallets that amount to two and a half million cosmos, or atoms in this case, right? That's one way to do it, right. You can impose some other requirements in the claiming KYC process. You can also think about just your caps. This was a very generous AirDrop, one to one, and you can obviously play with that amount lowered if you wanted to, right, to ensure that's a failsafe way of doing it.
00:24:23.688 - 00:24:24.162, Speaker B: Right.
00:24:24.296 - 00:24:31.426, Speaker C: I expect a lot of teams, particularly in the cosmos ecosystem, that are very regularly doing these stake drop type of.
00:24:31.608 - 00:24:36.434, Speaker B: Airdrops, will experiment with different mechanics both.
00:24:36.472 - 00:24:55.926, Speaker C: On the distribution side and then on the claiming process side and the KYC side to try and prevent this. I think it's also interesting to point out, too, and this is another topic we can chat about, this whale was not the only entity that received more than 50,000. They just happened to be the largest.
00:24:56.038 - 00:25:00.746, Speaker B: Recipient of Juno by a long shot.
00:25:00.778 - 00:25:05.520, Speaker C: Right, so they attracted the majority of the scrutiny, but I think there was.
00:25:05.890 - 00:25:11.230, Speaker B: Roughly a dozen addresses that received more.
00:25:11.300 - 00:25:31.400, Speaker C: Than the amount for different reasons. And so there is a question should corrective action here just be taken against the whale? Or should we also apply that treatment evenly across these other ten or twelve addresses that received more than their fair share?
00:25:32.090 - 00:26:19.080, Speaker A: Yeah, I feel like this idea about cheating in blockchains is one that needs to be addressed because clearly if people are violating the law in these communities, I mean, that was one thing when somebody asked me what I thought of this. Obviously it seems like a very extreme idea to take such a huge percentage of tokens from somebody, and yet at the same time, well, if you flout the rules, then what are you going to expect? Well, this has been such a fascinating conversation. I mean, it just raises so many questions and I think it's something that a lot of DAOs in the future are going to have to grapple with. So I really appreciate that you explained all the ins and outs. Thank you so much for coming on the show.
00:26:19.450 - 00:26:21.398, Speaker B: Thanks for having me, Laura, I appreciate it.

00:27:32.450 - 00:28:47.974, Speaker A: Thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap. Yuga Labs's metaverse plans involve a 16 Z coming off a busy week that included the purchase of CryptoPunks and mebits commercial rights, along with the arrival of Apecoin, board Ape Yacht Club creator Yuga Labs kept the good times rolling with the announcement of a $450,000,000 raise led by a 16 Z. The funding round values the firm at $4 billion, which is interestingly, less than one third of the current value of Apecoin the cryptocurrency, with a $12 billion market cap that will act as the main currency for Board Ape Yacht Club, of which Yugalabs owns 8%. Yuga Labs will be using the influx of cash to build out its metaverse, dubbed Other side. Yuga dropped a trailer for Other Side over the weekend via Twitter, revealing that the project will launch in April. The trailer follows the journey of a board Ape after it chugs a potion labeled Don't Drink Me and takes a psychedelic adventure across a dystopian metaverse landscape. Notably, the video includes references to a few other popular NFT projects, including Mutant Ape Yacht Club, CoolCats CryptoPunks, Cryptodes Mebits Nouns and World of Women.
00:28:47.974 - 00:29:56.700, Speaker A: As an aside related to Yuka Labs, crypto, Potato calculated how much an original Board Ape Yacht Club member would have made by holding a single NFT from Mint until now. In total, an OG BYC buyer spent zero eight ETH in 2021. Since then, original Minters received a Mutant Ape Yacht Club NFT, a board Ape Kennel Club NFT, and rights to the Ape AirDrop, which all told as up to something close to $477,000 from an initial $500 investment. El Salvador's bitcoin bond put on hold El Salvador's $1 bitcoin bond offering is delayed, as Alejandro Zalaya, El Salvador's finance minister, told Reuters on Tuesday. Zalaya cited unfavorable conditions like Ukraine's defense against the Russian invasion and bitcoin's volatility as reasons for El Salvador pushing the launch date back. The bond was initially planned to go out between March 15 and 20th. Zalaya says El Salvador is still looking to launch before September 2022.
00:29:56.700 - 00:30:51.962, Speaker A: However, Adam Cochrane, partner of Cinempane Ventures, was unconvinced that El Salvador's decision to postpone its bond was due to market conditions. El Salvador postponing their bitcoin bond due to unfavorable market conditions is hilarious. If you actually believed in an asset and can drum up demand for your bond, a down market is ideal to sell. It pretty clear no one wanted this instrument, he tweeted once. Or if issued, El Salvador, which made bitcoin legal tender and holds the crypto asset in its treasury, plans to use $500 million to purchase more bitcoin, with the other $500 million going towards the construction of energy and mining infrastructure. The news comes during the same week as a bill looking to mitigate the risk of El Salvador's bitcoin adoption passed out of a Senate committee dubbed the Accountability for Cryptocurrency in El Salvador Act. The legislation would monitor remittances from El Salvador.
00:30:51.962 - 00:32:04.398, Speaker A: President Naib Bukele expressed disdain tweeting Never in my wildest dreams would I have thought that the US government would be afraid of what we are doing here. Goldman Sachs puts Digital assets center Stage Goldman Sachs made its first ever over the counter crypto transaction this week via Galaxy Digital. The traditional finance behemoth executed a bitcoin non deliverable option, says Galaxy, claiming that Goldman's Trade is the first OTC crypto transaction by a major bank in the US. Coinciding with Goldman's Trade was a change to the front page of its website Goldmansax.com. On Wednesday, Goldman featured digitalization as the key trend on its main website, counting research and insights from cryptocurrencies to the metaverse. On the topic of traditional finances adoption of crypto, CoinDesk reported this week that the world's largest hedge fund, Ray Dalio's Bridgewater, is preparing to back its first crypto fund. While CoinDesk reports that Bridgewater will not be investing directly in crypto assets itself, the $150,000,000,000 asset manager has plans to back an external vehicle.
00:32:04.398 - 00:33:00.134, Speaker A: Ray Dalio himself disclosed a Bitcoin position back in May 2022. Additionally, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink revealed in a Thursday shareholder letter that the $9.6 trillion asset manager is studying digital currencies after seeing increasing interest from clients. L Ones are going after Bitcoin Bitcoin is suddenly all the rage in DFI. Luna Foundation Guard, a developer supporting Terra's main stablecoin UST, revealed that it has already amassed a $3 billion treasury that it will soon use to purchase Bitcoin. LFG plans to use the purchased BTC as a forex reserve mechanism to help keep UST's peg at $1 in any market condition. According to TerraForm Lab CEO Doe Kwan, LFG plans to up its forex reserve to $10 billion by the time it is done, which would cover two thirds of UST's market cap.
00:33:00.134 - 00:33:54.066, Speaker A: LFG's actual plan to back UST with Bitcoin remained a mystery until Wednesday, when Jump trading's crypto arm published a proposal on Terra's Governance Forum outlining a Bitcoin reserve pool that illustrates how LFG will help keep UST's price pegged to the dollar. On the other hand, at the Avalanche summit in Barcelona Ava Labs, the firm developing Avalanche's blockchain, announced two significant updates. First, it will be launching a wallet called Core. Secondly, the firm will add Bitcoin bridging functionality to Avalanche. The beta launch of GameStop's NFT marketplace was weird. GameStop launched the beta version of its marketplace this week on top of Loop Ring, sowing confusion among anyone who has been keeping up with the gaming company's foray into crypto. According to Loop Ring, the new GameStop NFT marketplace is built atop the second layer of ethereum.
00:33:54.066 - 00:34:37.400, Speaker A: Specifically Loop Ring l Two. This is a bit surprising because in Q four 2021, GameStop announced a partnership with Ethereum Scaling solution Immutable Disclosure, a former sponsor of my show, to support the development of an NFT platform in a deal that included millions in IMX tokens, GameStop and Loopbrink's announcement prompted a response from Immutable. Claiming that this was the plan all along. LRC integrating was not a surprise, and we welcome them, explained immutable on Twitter. The GameStop marketplace will ultimately be an aggregator with immutable as its preferred partner. Not surprisingly, loop ring's native Token LRC shot up 27% on the day of the announcement. Immutable's Token dropped half a percent.
00:34:37.400 - 00:35:32.946, Speaker A: Cashio lost millions on Wednesday. Cashio Dollar, an algorithmic stablecoin project built on salana, was exploited for $27 million. On Twitter, Cashio described the bug as an infinite mint glitch. According to paradigm researcher Sam Sun, because cachio didn't establish a root of trust for all the accounts it used, an attacker was able to steal approximately $50 million by forging a chain of fake accounts. The result of the hack decimated the project with total value locked in the protocol, crashing from $30 million to roughly $500,000, according to data from DFI llama, and the price of a single cash dropped from $1 to far below a penny. The DOJ is going after Frosties The US. Department of justice is charging two individuals with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering related to an NFT project called Frosty's.
00:35:32.946 - 00:36:15.570, Speaker A: It is the first such action against an NFT project by A-U-S. Regulator. According to the DOJ, the two Frosty's founders allegedly abandoned the Frosty's NFT project within hours after selling out of Frosty's. NFTs deactivated the Frosty's website and transferred approximately $1.1 million in cryptocurrency proceeds from the scheme to various cryptocurrency wallets under their control in multiple transactions designed to obfuscate the original source of funds. Time for fun bits. Greg Types his Way to a Tesla If you are a crypto Twitter native, you probably follow the meme account at greg 1667-693-5420.
00:36:15.570 - 00:36:51.610, Speaker A: In a very humorous exchange with FTX founder and CEO Sam Binkman Fried, it appears Greg won himself a free Tesla after cheekily asking FBF for a free Tesla if Greg could type more than 100 words per minute. If you want a smile or a laugh, you should definitely check out the video Greg posted to show off his accomplishment. It's a riot. Thanks so much for joining us today.
