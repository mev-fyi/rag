00:02:56.090 - 00:02:56.754, Speaker F: Hi, Dora.
00:02:56.802 - 00:02:57.960, Speaker G: Thanks for having me.
00:02:58.650 - 00:03:11.206, Speaker D: You announced this week that Ethereum's long awaited merge would not happen in June, as was previously projected. Before we dive into the details on that, just to just catch any listeners.
00:03:11.238 - 00:03:13.254, Speaker A: Up to speed, explain what the merge.
00:03:13.302 - 00:03:15.146, Speaker D: Is, and then tell us how long.
00:03:15.168 - 00:03:17.834, Speaker A: It will be delayed and sure.
00:03:17.952 - 00:03:45.618, Speaker G: So to start with the first part what is the Ethereum merge? So today Ethereum basically has two chains running in parallel. One of those is a proof of work chain which uses mining just like Bitcoin to generate new blocks on the network. And this is the chain that most end users interacting with Ethereum would kind of know as Ethereum. This is where smart contracts get deployed where most of kind of users funds sit. Previously, we would call this ethereum One.
00:03:45.704 - 00:03:47.540, Speaker F: We've tried to move away from that.
00:03:48.230 - 00:04:00.378, Speaker G: In parallel to that we've also launched in December 2020 a proof of stake chain. So proof of stake, since the very beginning of Ethereum was on the roadmap we always knew we wanted to switch from proof of work to proof of.
00:04:00.384 - 00:04:01.786, Speaker F: Stake and it just took a ton.
00:04:01.808 - 00:04:07.126, Speaker G: Of words to get to something which we thought was secure and decentralized enough for Ethereum.
00:04:07.238 - 00:04:10.426, Speaker F: So even when we had that to.
00:04:10.448 - 00:04:26.818, Speaker G: Be sure that we would not kind of break the network and all the applications that are running instead of just switching directly we decided to launch a chain in parallel. And so since December 2020 that proof of stake chain has been running now has tens of billions of dollars kind of securing it and basically runs the.
00:04:26.824 - 00:04:29.746, Speaker F: Entire proof of stake algorithm but the.
00:04:29.768 - 00:04:44.418, Speaker G: Blocks don't contain any end user transactions. So all the blocks on this proof of stake chain they contain some metadata around proof of stake and the consensus algorithm itself but they don't run end user transactions. And so the idea with the merge.
00:04:44.514 - 00:04:50.714, Speaker F: Is that to move ethereum from proof of work to proof of stake, we're going to keep the current chain, which.
00:04:50.752 - 00:04:53.926, Speaker G: Has all of the applications which we call the execution layer.
00:04:53.958 - 00:04:57.146, Speaker F: Now and basically change the rules by.
00:04:57.168 - 00:04:59.898, Speaker G: Which it decides how to create a.
00:04:59.904 - 00:05:01.726, Speaker F: New block in the chain to go.
00:05:01.748 - 00:05:04.618, Speaker G: From proof of work to following the Beacon Chain.
00:05:04.714 - 00:05:07.902, Speaker F: And what happens in practice is we.
00:05:07.956 - 00:05:10.158, Speaker G: Set a total difficulty value which we.
00:05:10.164 - 00:05:13.054, Speaker F: Can dive into later once we hit.
00:05:13.092 - 00:05:33.698, Speaker G: The certain mining difficulty on the network. The current execution change basically stops listening to proof of work and instead will start looking at the proof of stake chain to tell it what is the next block. And from that point, from the proof of stake perspective validators will be producing blocks which now include transactions from end users and smart contracts.
00:05:33.874 - 00:05:36.518, Speaker F: And this whole process is basically going.
00:05:36.524 - 00:05:50.510, Speaker G: To be instantaneous from the Ethereum chain perspective. So you'll have the last proof of work block and then the next block gets produced by a validator on the beacon chain and we just continue that way. So it's been kind of years of work but now we have a design.
00:05:50.580 - 00:05:53.134, Speaker F: Which will be kind of seamless from.
00:05:53.172 - 00:05:55.470, Speaker G: A smart contract perspective for the transition.
00:05:56.450 - 00:06:07.218, Speaker D: And so most people thought and this wasn't official but most people expected it to happen in June but you tweeted that it will probably happen in the months after.
00:06:07.304 - 00:06:08.660, Speaker A: So why is that?
00:06:09.110 - 00:06:28.262, Speaker G: Right, so we never had like an official date for the merge. And I appreciate that. We've been saying it's soon for many years and the community is very eager to see this happen. And the reason why we don't have a date is just fundamentally it's impossible to predict these things because there's so many unknown. Unknowns, right? Like nobody has done this ever.
00:06:28.396 - 00:06:31.162, Speaker F: And so at best what we can.
00:06:31.216 - 00:06:35.306, Speaker G: Say is look at how well things are going and kind of project in the future.
00:06:35.488 - 00:06:40.282, Speaker F: But that assumes we don't hit some unknown issue which we kind of always.
00:06:40.336 - 00:06:52.574, Speaker G: End up doing because this technology is so new that there's so many moving parts. So we tried to shy away from giving dates but then there's always some pressure for when is this roughly coming?
00:06:52.692 - 00:06:55.766, Speaker F: And within Ethereum, this difficulty bomb.
00:06:55.818 - 00:07:13.800, Speaker G: So this feature that means we need to upgrade the chain every so often, otherwise the chain stops working and this will start kicking off around June. So when we get to June, we basically have to make a decision around are we ready to move Ethereum to proof of stake or do we want to push this bomb back again?
00:07:14.170 - 00:07:17.814, Speaker F: And so obviously no one on the.
00:07:17.852 - 00:07:26.166, Speaker G: Development side wants to move forward with the merge if it's not ready and if it's not safe for the network. So if we did get to June.
00:07:26.278 - 00:07:29.434, Speaker F: And we're not ready, then we'll just.
00:07:29.472 - 00:07:31.466, Speaker G: Push back the bomb and make sure.
00:07:31.488 - 00:07:36.074, Speaker F: That we are in a spot that we're comfortable with before we go to mainnet.
00:07:36.202 - 00:07:50.398, Speaker G: And I guess the thing that's also worth noting is this difficulty bomb is kind of a gradual process. So it doesn't make the network unusable overnight. It slowly gets worse and then it's an exponential curve. So at some point it gets much worse, much quicker.
00:07:50.494 - 00:07:52.302, Speaker F: So we kind of have this range.
00:07:52.366 - 00:07:58.802, Speaker G: Between June and probably late July, early August where you might see longer block times on Ethereum.
00:07:58.866 - 00:08:01.862, Speaker F: And if we thought that we were.
00:08:01.916 - 00:08:07.398, Speaker G: Just ready we might choose to not push back the bomb and have longer block times for a month or two.
00:08:07.564 - 00:08:10.370, Speaker F: And I think this is kind of where we're at right now.
00:08:10.460 - 00:08:13.340, Speaker G: We are pretty far along in the development process.
00:08:14.030 - 00:08:19.658, Speaker F: We're starting to think about deploying this to mainnet but we're definitely not at.
00:08:19.664 - 00:08:23.322, Speaker G: The point where it is completely bug free and there's no more issues.
00:08:23.376 - 00:08:25.134, Speaker F: And it's a no brainer to then.
00:08:25.172 - 00:08:36.434, Speaker G: Just deploy the main net. So we're kind of in this middle section where we might have to delay the bomb. There's a chance we might not. And we're obviously watching and testing very.
00:08:36.472 - 00:08:39.140, Speaker F: Closely to see exactly what to do.
00:08:40.150 - 00:08:47.810, Speaker D: So what needs to happen or what needs to be in place for Ethereum to feel comfortable actually executing the merge.
00:08:48.410 - 00:08:48.822, Speaker F: Right?
00:08:48.876 - 00:09:00.630, Speaker G: That's a great question. And historically, what we've done when we have upgrades is we'll write all these EIPS into clients, we'll run a bunch of tests for them. We'll sometimes deploy a couple new testnets.
00:09:00.710 - 00:09:02.426, Speaker F: To test them, and then we'll move.
00:09:02.448 - 00:09:22.538, Speaker G: To the existing testnets on Ethereum. So, like Rinkeby, Gorli, Robson and whatnot. The thing that's happened over the years, though, is these testnets now have a lot of usage. So Ethereum's testnets have as much usage as some actual layer. One blockchains, like Reddit, for example, has a ton of its infrastructure on one of the testnets.
00:09:22.634 - 00:09:28.066, Speaker F: And so we don't want to break these if we don't have to. So we kind of introduced a new.
00:09:28.088 - 00:09:31.086, Speaker G: Step in the process, which we've called shadow forking.
00:09:31.278 - 00:09:33.874, Speaker F: And what Shadow Forking does is we.
00:09:33.912 - 00:09:49.686, Speaker G: Basically launch an upgrade on an existing network, but only using a very small number of nodes. That basically the testing teams and client development teams control. And what happens then is these nodes will fork off when the block is.
00:09:49.708 - 00:09:53.226, Speaker F: Hit, but there'll only be a small number of nodes and they'll still be.
00:09:53.248 - 00:09:55.270, Speaker G: Able to replay all of the transactions.
00:09:55.430 - 00:09:58.586, Speaker F: From the main network. And that gives us kind of a.
00:09:58.608 - 00:09:59.994, Speaker G: Way to test as though we were.
00:10:00.032 - 00:10:08.670, Speaker F: Forking testnet, but without bringing the whole thing down if there are errors. So we've been running through this process. We first ran through it on Gordy.
00:10:09.090 - 00:10:14.866, Speaker G: This week or late last week or early this week. We had the first run on a main net shadow fork as well.
00:10:14.968 - 00:10:18.626, Speaker F: And so basically, those forks have been.
00:10:18.728 - 00:10:23.380, Speaker G: Successful in that we've managed to get the network to finalize after.
00:10:23.750 - 00:10:25.666, Speaker F: But the thing to note there is.
00:10:25.848 - 00:10:37.910, Speaker G: The way the proof of stake algorithm is done is it's meant to be resilient to a lot of things going wrong so that in case there's an attack on Ethereum or something like that, ideally the chain keeps chugging along.
00:10:38.060 - 00:10:41.346, Speaker F: So even though these testnets have shadow.
00:10:41.378 - 00:10:51.226, Speaker G: Forks successfully and they keep finalizing you on the other side, we have noticed a lot of issues with clients in a bunch of different edge cases and whatnot. And those are the things we're trying.
00:10:51.248 - 00:10:53.886, Speaker F: To fix now because I said this.
00:10:53.908 - 00:11:00.110, Speaker G: On Twitter yesterday, like, yes, we could ship this tomorrow and maybe the network wouldn't completely crash.
00:11:00.690 - 00:11:02.942, Speaker F: But that's not like the level of.
00:11:02.996 - 00:11:11.634, Speaker G: Certainty we want to have before we transition Ethereum, which just has a huge amount of value sitting on top of it. So the next few weeks to maybe.
00:11:11.672 - 00:11:13.762, Speaker F: Months for us is really like running.
00:11:13.816 - 00:11:26.790, Speaker G: These shadow forks, making sure that we catch all the issues. We obviously fix them. And once that is stabilized, then we can start looking at just forking the existing testnets and making sure those work all right. And once that's done, then we would fork mainnet.
00:11:27.450 - 00:11:27.862, Speaker F: Yeah.
00:11:27.916 - 00:12:02.260, Speaker D: And just to make it clear for people, obviously Ethereum is the second largest crypto. But as I heard some people discussing on CoinDesk, there are so many assets built on top of Ethereum as well. So when you add up all that economic activity, I mean, it's huge. So that's, you know, when you're just trying to shift that all over to this new chain, that obviously is a delicate transition. All right, so in a moment, we're going to talk a little bit more about kind of like the specifics about how this will happen. But first, wickword from the sponsors who make this show possible.

00:13:55.770 - 00:13:57.494, Speaker D: Back to my conversation with Tim.
00:13:57.612 - 00:13:58.854, Speaker C: So one thing that you kind of.
00:13:58.892 - 00:14:11.740, Speaker D: Said a little bit earlier was that will not happen at a certain block, but rather at this difficulty number. And we have talked about the difficulty time bomb, but just can you talk a little bit about how that transition will happen?
00:14:12.130 - 00:14:36.386, Speaker G: The difficulty bomb and the total difficulty are separate concepts which they have similar names. But the way that proof of work works is every block there's like a specific difficulty that it takes to mine it. And when more people try to mine on the network, we raise that difficulty so that the block time stays the same and blocks don't get mined too quickly. And similarly, when less people mine, we lower it so that it's easier to mine blocks and blocks don't take too.
00:14:36.408 - 00:14:38.998, Speaker F: Long, but we also keep track of.
00:14:39.084 - 00:14:47.474, Speaker G: What'S the total amount of difficulty that's been mined on the entire chain. So this is basically the sum of every single block's difficulty since the Ethereum.
00:14:47.522 - 00:14:50.098, Speaker F: Genesis block for the merge.
00:14:50.194 - 00:15:03.226, Speaker G: Instead of using just a block number, what we want to do is use a total difficulty value. So to say once the network hits this much difficulty on the proof of work chain, then we transition to proof of stake.
00:15:03.338 - 00:15:04.910, Speaker D: And you mean for all time?
00:15:05.060 - 00:15:10.378, Speaker G: Yes, exactly, for all time. And the reason for that is that difficulty is just costly to fake.
00:15:10.474 - 00:15:14.174, Speaker F: Maybe an aside here is miners might.
00:15:14.212 - 00:15:37.218, Speaker G: Not be happy with the merge, right? Like, at the very least we can't assume they'll be happy with the merge. So we want something which is as hard as possible for them to fake and as independent as them for the process to happen. And so by using the total difficulty you basically make it really hard to fake kind of a second merge chain because you would then need to spend all these mining resources to create that chain.
00:15:37.394 - 00:15:38.566, Speaker F: So it just gives us a bit.
00:15:38.588 - 00:15:49.974, Speaker G: More confidence than a block number, where if you use the block number, you could imagine a minor mining kind of a shadow fork or shadow fork is probably the wrong term because it's a real thing now. But a minor mining like a minority.
00:15:50.022 - 00:15:52.762, Speaker F: Fork in secret for months and then.
00:15:52.896 - 00:15:58.654, Speaker G: They might be able to hit that block because over time, the difficulty has lowered on their fork and they can.
00:15:58.692 - 00:16:00.606, Speaker F: Kind of reveal that right at the.
00:16:00.628 - 00:16:02.058, Speaker G: Merge and mess things up because there's.
00:16:02.074 - 00:16:03.630, Speaker F: Now two competing forks.
00:16:04.050 - 00:16:05.818, Speaker G: So in order to avoid that, we.
00:16:05.844 - 00:16:08.114, Speaker F: Just look at which fork actually has.
00:16:08.152 - 00:16:09.954, Speaker G: The greatest amount of proof of work.
00:16:10.072 - 00:16:12.306, Speaker F: And once we hit kind of that.
00:16:12.328 - 00:16:19.190, Speaker G: Threshold value, which we call the terminal total difficulty, then we kind of hand everything off to the proof of stake chain.
00:16:19.530 - 00:16:24.706, Speaker F: And the thing that's kind of interesting here is there might be different blocks.
00:16:24.738 - 00:16:37.418, Speaker G: Which hit this terminal total difficulty because Ethereum has uncle blocks happening. So it might be possible that once we get to the merge there's two or maybe even five blocks that all show up at the same time.
00:16:37.584 - 00:16:40.186, Speaker F: But the way it's designed, only the.
00:16:40.208 - 00:16:44.746, Speaker G: First block which hits or exceeds that terminal total difficulty is like a valid.
00:16:44.858 - 00:16:46.570, Speaker F: Final proof of work block.
00:16:46.730 - 00:16:52.954, Speaker G: And then the validator on the beacon chain who creates the next block gets to choose which of those valid blocks.
00:16:53.002 - 00:16:57.746, Speaker F: They see as the previous canonical block. And so just like today how you.
00:16:57.768 - 00:17:21.782, Speaker G: Can have like an uncle block on Ethereum which just get orphaned by the chain. We have the same situation where maybe at the merge there's a handful of competing blocks but then we just rely on the validator to choose that and then the validator afterwards will point back to the block that the previous validator chose. And at that point we're 100% relying on proof of stake and proof of work and miners generally just don't influence.
00:17:21.926 - 00:17:24.010, Speaker F: The fork choice rule for Ethereum.
00:17:24.750 - 00:17:35.600, Speaker D: So I know you're probably loath to put a projection out, but can you give some sort of timeline of when you think the merge now is most likely to happen?
00:17:37.490 - 00:17:43.106, Speaker G: I'm not going to do that. Unfortunately, if there's one thing I've learned this week is I will put an.
00:17:43.128 - 00:17:53.586, Speaker D: Explicit so I will say you did tweet probably in the month after Q Two which sort of implies to me Q Three.
00:17:53.768 - 00:17:57.350, Speaker G: Right. I think we are pretty far along in the process.
00:17:57.420 - 00:18:00.470, Speaker F: We think we're almost there.
00:18:00.620 - 00:18:13.738, Speaker G: There's always this unknown, unknown thing, right? Like we could find something the day before which is like some fatal flaw and have to delay everything for months because it's a hard thing to fix. So that's like the thing. It's just very hard, I think.
00:18:13.824 - 00:18:14.122, Speaker F: Sure.
00:18:14.176 - 00:18:38.926, Speaker G: If everything keeps going like it's going now, clearly we won't hit June just because the reason we won't hit June is just the amount of time it takes to go on testnets and then main net because we need to choose when we forked. Then put out those releases. Give people the time to update their nodes. Have the forks happen. Make sure that they went well. And we're already mid April, so just the amount of time. If we decided like tomorrow that we're.
00:18:38.958 - 00:18:41.026, Speaker F: Going for main net it would take.
00:18:41.048 - 00:18:52.786, Speaker G: Probably more than two months to get from that decision to it actually happens on main net. So that's why I was pretty confident saying June is not going to happen. And I think we've kind of shared.
00:18:52.818 - 00:18:58.582, Speaker F: That in the past on all core devs. But yeah, sure, if things keep going.
00:18:58.636 - 00:19:08.986, Speaker G: Well and there are no more big issues that we find, then probably the months after June still seems reasonable. Whether that's like one or four or five I don't want to make a.
00:19:09.008 - 00:19:12.366, Speaker F: Call there something really terrible would have.
00:19:12.388 - 00:19:35.860, Speaker G: To happen for it to be delayed like a year at this point. I don't know what could cause that. Nothing that we've ever encountered on Ethereum, but it's just very hard to tell you. Maybe we find some weird sync issues which take us two months to debug. That could happen, but there's no way to know really.
00:19:36.650 - 00:19:50.950, Speaker D: So there are some misconceptions out there about what will happen on Ethereum after the merge, particularly around weather and how gas prices might change. Can you clarify what it is that people should expect in terms of gas fees?
00:19:51.550 - 00:20:22.482, Speaker G: Right, so in short, gas fees should basically stay the same. The merge doesn't really change the throughput of Ethereum. It does a tiny thing which blocks are now 13 seconds and they'll lower to 12 seconds. So you get like 9% more throughput. And so in practice, if all things were perfectly stable you would imagine fees go down by like 89%. But there's so much volatility on Ethereum that's basically nothing. But scalability is super important and it is the next thing we're kind of working on.
00:20:22.536 - 00:20:25.986, Speaker F: So just to give some context, the.
00:20:26.008 - 00:20:41.210, Speaker G: Main way Ethereum thinks about scalability today is through roll ups and those are already live, right? Like there's optimistic rollups live. There's zero knowledge roll ups that are going live as well. And these today already provide way lower fees than the Ethereum mainnet for end users.
00:20:41.710 - 00:20:45.206, Speaker F: And a large part of what users.
00:20:45.238 - 00:21:20.966, Speaker G: Pay for when they pay a transaction fee on roll ups is storing data back on layer one. So the way that rollups work is that they generate all this transaction data just like the Ethereum main net. But instead of executing every transaction on layer one, they execute them all on layer two. But then they then need to post back the transaction data on layer one because if something goes wrong, they need to then be able to execute it. And this is for optimistic roll ups. Zero knowledge roll up work a bit differently because they don't post the full data, they post back proof. But the general concept that users on L Two pay for posting data back.
00:21:20.988 - 00:21:23.670, Speaker F: To Ethereum L one, that's true across.
00:21:23.740 - 00:21:30.378, Speaker G: Zero knowledge and optimistic roll ups. And so one big thing we can do to lower transaction fees on roll up is just make it cheaper to.
00:21:30.384 - 00:21:32.540, Speaker F: Put data back on Ethereum layer one.
00:21:33.070 - 00:21:47.866, Speaker G: And so the long term roadmap for that is a full Sharding infrastructure. And Sharding is basically a whole separate kind of data network on Ethereum that runs in parallel to smart contracts, which just stores data for a limited period.
00:21:47.898 - 00:21:49.934, Speaker F: Of time so that rollups can just.
00:21:49.972 - 00:21:52.320, Speaker G: Use that as a way to post the data back.
00:21:52.930 - 00:21:54.654, Speaker F: It's a bit complicated to ship all that.
00:21:54.692 - 00:22:00.082, Speaker G: And the fees are high today, so we want to do some things quicker. We basically have two short term things.
00:22:00.136 - 00:22:01.300, Speaker F: That we're working on.
00:22:01.670 - 00:22:07.606, Speaker G: One is just straight up reducing the cost of storing data on layer one. The challenge by doing that is that.
00:22:07.628 - 00:22:09.560, Speaker F: It does grow the rate at which.
00:22:10.010 - 00:22:15.926, Speaker G: An Ethereum node will grow. So if we make it cheaper to store data, then data gets stored and.
00:22:15.948 - 00:22:21.778, Speaker F: So the blockchain grows quicker. And we think we're probably at the.
00:22:21.804 - 00:22:25.354, Speaker G: Point where it might make sense to do something like that if we really.
00:22:25.392 - 00:22:27.898, Speaker F: Have to because the fees have gotten so high.
00:22:28.064 - 00:22:34.880, Speaker G: The other thing that we're working on, which we hope we can get done is EIP 48 44.
00:22:35.330 - 00:22:36.574, Speaker F: And this is kind of an in.
00:22:36.612 - 00:22:38.494, Speaker G: Between where it doesn't do the full.
00:22:38.532 - 00:22:43.278, Speaker F: Sharding infrastructure, but it basically creates a.
00:22:43.284 - 00:22:45.386, Speaker G: New type of transaction on Ethereum which.
00:22:45.428 - 00:22:55.074, Speaker F: Has a little bit of Shard data on it. And then roll ups can just use these new types of transactions to store kind of data for a cheaper price.
00:22:55.112 - 00:22:57.714, Speaker G: Than they currently can. And the thing that's neat with that.
00:22:57.752 - 00:23:03.286, Speaker F: Is that it would lay from like an application perspective's point of view, all.
00:23:03.308 - 00:23:05.410, Speaker G: Of the infrastructure that we're going to have in Sharding.
00:23:05.490 - 00:23:06.694, Speaker F: So it's like we can do this.
00:23:06.732 - 00:23:33.050, Speaker G: Thing which doesn't provide full Sharding yet, but it gives them kind of all the scaffolding that will be there when sharding is, so that if like, say, optimism or Starquare or Arbitrum need to update to use this, they won't have to update again once we have full sharding. So it is a bit more complicated to get done than just straight up lowering the cost of storing data. But it does feel like a happy medium and hopefully that's something we can do kind of in the upgrade after the merge.
00:23:33.130 - 00:23:37.140, Speaker D: And so if you were to put a timeline on that, what would that timeline be?
00:23:37.510 - 00:23:38.500, Speaker F: No idea.
00:23:39.430 - 00:23:46.214, Speaker G: I think the upgrade after the merge timeline will probably depend on whether we think we want to do this more.
00:23:46.252 - 00:23:55.030, Speaker F: Complicated new transaction type with data in them, or just a simple data reduction cost.
00:23:55.180 - 00:24:01.180, Speaker G: But yeah, the merge is not even over, so it's hard for me to predict how long it'll take us to ship the next thing.
00:24:02.110 - 00:24:18.250, Speaker D: Yeah. No, I get it. I was half teasing with that question. Okay, well, this has been incredibly fascinating and yeah, just hopefully it will clarify a lot of things for people. Thank you so much for coming on Unchained.
00:24:18.410 - 00:24:20.014, Speaker F: Of course, thank you for having me.
00:24:20.132 - 00:24:25.680, Speaker D: Don't forget, next up is the weekly news recap. Stick around for this week in crypto after this short break.

00:25:31.130 - 00:26:34.940, Speaker A: Thanks for tuning in to this week's news recap. Poly acronym. The DTCC pilots a CBDC with the DDP. This week, the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, a private financial markets infrastructure company, announced a central bank digital currency pilot program dubbed Project Lithium. The DTCC will be working with the digital dollar project to explore how it might use blockchain technology. According to a press release, project Lithium hopes that its program will help provide clarity as to how a CBDC may reduce trapped liquidity, increase capital efficiency, solidify delivery guarantees, and add regulatory transparency and provide other benefits as well to the settlement process. A CBDC could improve time and cost efficiencies, provide broader accessibility to central bank money and payments, and all while emulating the features of physical cash in an increasingly digital world, explained former CFTC Chairman Christopher Giancarlo, aka cryptodad, who spearheads the digital Dollar project.
00:26:34.940 - 00:27:36.046, Speaker A: According to the Atlanticcouncil and Cbdctracker.org, this is the first CBDC pilot in the US. The DTCC claims to provide custody and asset servicing for securities issues from 177 countries and territories valued at $87.1 trillion. Although the announcement came weeks after President Biden's executive order announcing research on a central bank digital currency, the DTCC and Digital Dollar Project are private sector entities that are not part of Biden's executive order. In his book Cryptodad The Fight for the Future of Money, John Carla wrote, Money, especially digital money, is too important to be left to central bankers. Block and Blockstream to test bitcoin mining Using Tesla equipment at Bitcoin 2022 in Miami, Adam Back, the CEO of Blockstream, announced a pilot crypto mine in Texas that, in partnership with Jack Dorsey's block, will be powered by Tesla's solar and storage technology.
00:27:36.046 - 00:28:13.994, Speaker A: The project is expected to be completely offline, with Tesla's solar array powering the mine during the day and Tesla batteries powering the mining facility at night. The partnership will be small to start, with just 1 energy capacity. The $12 million in development costs will be split between Block and Blockstream. The pilot project is expected to be up and running within months. Data regarding the program's energy consumption and hash rate will be publicly available. People like to debate about the different factors to do with bitcoin mining. We figured let's just prove it have an open dashboard so people can play along.
00:28:13.994 - 00:29:14.880, Speaker A: Maybe it can inform other players to participate, Beck explained to CNBC. 63 months for ethereum Developer Virgil Griffith 39 year old former Ethereum developer Virgil Griffith was sentenced to five and a quarter years in prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act last September. Griffith was originally arrested in 2019 after giving a presentation on cryptocurrency in Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea, despite being denied permission by the Department of State to do so. Prosecutors allege that Griffith gave North Korea information that he knew could be used to evade and avoid U. S. Sanctions and fund its nuclear weapons program. Specifically, the Department of justice says that Griffith and his coconspirators also answered specific questions about blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies for the DPRK audience, including individuals whom Griffith understood worked for the North Korean government.
00:29:14.880 - 00:29:48.162, Speaker A: In addition to a 63 month sentence, Griffith was also fined $100,000. Speaking of North Korea, the US. Treasury Department is alleging that Lazarus, a North Korean hacking group, is tied to the 600 million dollar hack of the Ronan Bridge from earlier this month. The Treasury Department has added a wallet holding 148,000 ETH to its sanctions list. Celsius shuts down yield for most us. Citizens US. Regulators continue to force crypto companies to halt offerings of retail based crypto yield.
00:29:48.162 - 00:30:24.542, Speaker A: This week's, mark was Celsius, a crypto rewards platform that, much like BlockFi, offers an earn platform where users. Can deposit crypto tokens and accumulate yield at a rate between zero, 65 and 18.63% per year. According to a Celsius blog post this week, nonaccredited US. Customers will no longer have access to its yield product starting April 15 due to regulatory uncertainty. As we have previously acknowledged, Celsius has been working closely with regulators around the world. It is our intention to be as transparent with our community as possible, Celsius wrote.
00:30:24.542 - 00:31:10.110, Speaker A: More specifically, we have been in ongoing discussions with United States regulators regarding our earn product. As a result, there will be changes to the way our earn product will work for users based in the United States. This means that Celsius customers who make less than $200,000 a year or do not have a net worth of $1 million will be barred from earning interest on the platform. Celsius customers who had deposited tokens before Friday, April 15, will be grandfathered into Celsius's earn program and can continue to obtain yield on their investments. The news is not surprising to anyone who has kept up with the crypto yield space. Notably, Celsius has been under scrutiny from US. Regulators since 2021 and has faced obstacles in New Jersey, Texas and Alabama.
00:31:10.110 - 00:31:33.242, Speaker A: Furthermore, Celsius's major competitor, Blockfly, paid a 100 million dollar fine to the SEC and state regulators for offering a lending product, which the SEC believes is a securities product, to US. Citizens without registering. Additionally, the SEC threatened to sue Coinbase after the exchange announced its intent to launch a crypto interestbearing product for US.
00:31:33.296 - 00:31:34.250, Speaker F: Citizens.
00:31:35.070 - 00:32:47.474, Speaker A: Coinbase listings Spark skepticism and an insider trading allegation in an effort to increase transparency on token listings, Coinbase published a blog post revealing 50 tokens for which the exchange is considering offering support. The decision seems to have backfired. First of all, the list of tokens being considered was met with skepticism on Twitter at Pastry ETH was one of the more vocal voices and cited certain red flags with some of the tokens on Coinbase's list. For example, Botto B-O-T-T-O has a market cap of $4 million, Chrome Krom is at roughly $10 million, and Mona is less than $4 million, while Ric is about $2 million with zero volume. Out of all the assets mentioned in the blog post by Coinbase, I have heard of maybe ten of them, Pastry ETH wrote. Additionally, nearly half of them are under $20 million market cap and some as low as even $5 million. Pastry ETH then wondered, Is Coinbase just stupid, or is there something else going on? Secondly, in a move that has sparked insider information debates, an ethereum wallet purchased more than $400,000 worth of tokens from the list three minutes before the list was made public.
00:32:47.474 - 00:33:44.334, Speaker A: However, while the tokens briefly spiked in the hours after the announcement, it does not appear that the trader was able to turn a profit, as the wallet address holds less than $400,000 despite hitting $550,000 plus at one point. In related news, robin Hood announced four new tokens on its platform. Customers now have access to comp matic, sol and shib. Circle raises $400 million and partners with BlackRock circle, the company behind the stablecoin USDC, announced a 400 million dollar funding run this week, as well as a partnership with BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager. According to a press release from Circle, BlackRock will be the primary asset manager of USDC cash reserves and will be exploring capital market applications for USDC. There is currently over $50 billion worth of USDC in circulation. Hate your NFT.
00:33:44.334 - 00:34:40.470, Speaker A: Now you can return it. ERC 721 R is a new token standard that could change the way NFT sales work. The standard is a riff on ERC 721, which is the standard most ethereum NFTs follow, with one significant difference the R stands for return, meaning NFT purchasers have 30 days to request a refund after a mint. On its website, ERC 721 claims that the 30 day period will prevent quick rug pulls, promote accountability, protect floor prices, and lower the risk of purchasing. Currently, there are four different projects utilizing the token standard. TerraForm Labs builds up LFG's reserves TerraForm Labs gifted $880,000,000 worth of Luna, or 2.3% of Luna's market cap to Luna Foundation Guard to help continue building a backstop for Terra's algorithmic stablecoin UST.
00:34:40.470 - 00:35:33.282, Speaker A: Since February, LFG has purchased over 42,000 BTC worth $1.7 billion and has also announced plans to acquire $100 million in AVAX. TerraForm Labs cofounder Doe Kwan has stated that LG's goal is to build UST's reserve to $3 billion in the short term and $10 billion long term. Board Ape Yacht restaurant board in Hungary. A board Ape Yacht Club themed pop up restaurant launched on 7th street in Long Beach last week, spearheaded by Kevin Co and Andy Nguyen. The owner of Board Ape 6180 burger themed concept restaurant accepted ETH and Ape for its burger and fries and will continue to do so for three months. Speaking of board apes, coinbase announced a trilogy of Board Ape Yacht Club themed films called The Dgen Trilogy.
00:35:33.282 - 00:36:08.610, Speaker A: Ape owners chosen in the casting process will get a licensing fee of $10,000 in Ape or BTC. The first film should go out in June. A new owner for crypto Twitter, Elon Musk, offered to buy Twitter for $41.3 billion on Thursday. Although this isn't a crypto story, it does bear mentioning given that Crypto Twitter is essentially Crypto's Town Square. As is the case with Elon, everything is a meme, and his offer equates to a share price of $54.20. Thanks so much for joining us today.
