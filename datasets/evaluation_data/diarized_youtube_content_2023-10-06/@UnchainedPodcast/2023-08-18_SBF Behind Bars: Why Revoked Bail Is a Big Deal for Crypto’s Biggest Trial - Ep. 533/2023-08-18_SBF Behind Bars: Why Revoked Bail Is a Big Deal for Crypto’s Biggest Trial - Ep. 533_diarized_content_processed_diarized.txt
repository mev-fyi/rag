00:00:00.330 - 00:00:09.390, Speaker A: In my experience, some defendants, some clients, when they're imprisoned, ever contained, they really want or are more interested in pleading.

00:01:11.278 - 00:01:17.478, Speaker A: Thanks for including me and having me on the show, Laura. I'm a big fan of the show and I've listened to many of them.
00:01:17.644 - 00:01:52.058, Speaker C: Excited to have you. Former FTX CEO Sam Binkman Fried had his bail revoked and he got sent back to jail last week. What appears to have tipped things over the edge was that he leaked parts of Caroline Ellison's diaries to The New York Times. And Judge Lewis Kaplan said when he revoked the bail that he believed SBF had likely intended to get two witnesses to back off and not cooperate as fully with the government, caroline Ellison being one of them. Do you agree with the judge's decision on this? And do you agree that those were likely Sam's intentions?
00:01:52.234 - 00:02:20.610, Speaker A: Well, I think the defense has said those weren't Sam's intentions, and obviously the government took a different view and the judge agreed with the government. Judges do take that very seriously. Usually a condition of release for any defendant is you not contact any of the other witnesses in the case and that you not try to do things. And just a general precept of that is you not try to do anything that would intimidate them from coming forward and testifying, especially when they've been identified.
00:02:20.770 - 00:02:30.874, Speaker C: And there you're referring to how we contacted the former general counsel via text message, kind of implying that you should try to be on the same team. Is that what you're referring to?
00:02:30.992 - 00:03:04.390, Speaker A: Well, I think that can be one thing. Contacting somebody directly. There may be reasons you would contact someone, though. For example, you may still have business dealings or other things. Sometimes you would clear that through your lawyer or even through the court and have a carve out. That wasn't done, from what I know in this case. And as for the situation, I mean, what's been reported is he had a meeting with a New York Times reporter at his house or his parents house and provided his diary to the, you know, the story came out and it was somewhat salacious.
00:03:04.390 - 00:03:43.566, Speaker A: And I think the judge and the government felt that that was a way to try to get her to back off from wanting to testify fully and truthfully at this trial. She is an expected witness, one of the government's key witnesses from what we know. And I think there have been a number of other incidents that had gotten the court's attention about Sam when he's been out. And so I don't think people were surprised that he was detained. I think most people I've talked to were surprised he wasn't detained from the start. And so now that he's detained, though, that really does change a lot of the dynamics for preparation for trial and it does make it much tougher on the defense to prepare for trial.
00:03:43.678 - 00:03:59.366, Speaker C: And just a quick point. I think at the time of his extradition from the Bahamas, there was speculation that the reason he was released on bail was that he had made it a condition of his extradition. Do you think that theory holds water?
00:03:59.548 - 00:04:48.834, Speaker A: It's very possible. A lot of times when a client is being extradited, if he agreed to waive extradition, which is what happened here, so he stopped his fight in the Bahamas and said, I will come back. That often is something that the defense will try to negotiate with the government because it is important for a defense lawyer to have full access to their client. And just having your client available to answer the phone, meet with you, respond to emails, look at all the discovery. It's just 1000 times easier when they're out and at a residence or somewhere that you can quickly do that with them. Now Sam is in detention, he's in a jail, and he was a much more limited access. So it's just a much harder preparation for its trial, much harder for the defense to work with their client, for the lawyers to work with their client.
00:04:48.962 - 00:04:54.422, Speaker C: And his side has appealed his detention. How likely do you think it is that they'll prevail?
00:04:54.566 - 00:05:23.522, Speaker A: I don't think it's likely. I think it's a tough road for them. I understand why they would appeal and they filed it. We haven't seen the briefings yet, so maybe there are arguments I'm not aware of. Judge Kaplan is a very well respected member of the bench there in the Southern District, New York, a very seasoned judge. I haven't read the transcript of that hearing, but I'm sure he documented his reasons very well and given a lot of discretion under the rules. So I think it's unlikely that it would be changed again.
00:05:23.522 - 00:05:26.422, Speaker A: Judges are given a lot of discretion in this era of the law.
00:05:26.556 - 00:05:46.310, Speaker C: So walk me through now what it is like when the defendant's side is preparing for trial under conditions similar to what he had at his parents home under bail versus what it will look like now. That he's in Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn.
00:05:46.470 - 00:06:20.070, Speaker A: Sure. So when someone's mean they may be restricted in terms of where they can go otherwise, but they're always given access to their lawyers. That's one of the almost always a carve out is that they can go to meet with their lawyer, they can get on the phone with their lawyer. Usually you're given the ability to email with your lawyer, sometimes not depending on the crime or the alleged crime. And so that depends. But it's just like anything else. You can pick up the phone and call your client and talk through an issue or you can invite your client in or you can go meet with your client and look at documents together and there's no set times or hours.
00:06:20.070 - 00:06:38.934, Speaker A: You can do that once someone's been detained. Those facilities have lots of other people there. They have their rules about when you can come. They have lengths of stay you can stay in. It true, you could probably show up in the morning and stay a long time, especially in the lead up to trial. But you're bringing documents in and out. Your client is now detained.
00:06:38.934 - 00:06:59.278, Speaker A: Sometimes there is a lockdown at the facility. No one can get in or get out. Sometimes there is some other incident that makes it hard to see your client. And so it's just a much more restricted interaction and it makes things a lot more difficult. You can't just do things on the fly. You have to really sort of plan more ahead. Again, it's not impossible.
00:06:59.278 - 00:07:44.750, Speaker A: Many people are detained and prepared for trial with their lawyers and it's effective. But it just is a hurdle that defense lawyers really don't like to have. They don't have to of, you know, it affects the client, it affects the he was detained a little bit in the Bahamas for a short period of time. Now he's going to be detained leading up to trial. A lot of prosecutors view that as a favorable thing. A lot of times I think it's sometimes more likely that the defendant will choose to plead guilty once they've been detained for a number of reasons. So it's just overall it's an advantage to the government and a disadvantage to the defense once someone is detained.
00:07:44.910 - 00:08:00.966, Speaker C: And just a quick question. Earlier when you said that the defense lawyers will have to bring documents in and out, do you mean that they can't just go over things on a laptop together but they have to literally print out physical documents and bring those in?
00:08:01.068 - 00:08:23.610, Speaker A: You can get permission to bring a laptop in. It has to be usually a laptop that just has those documents on them. And so it's just more cumbersome overall. And the client, the defendant can keep documents in their cell. They are usually given a box and it's marked attorney client approach or something like that. It depends on the jail. So there is a way to do things and for them to hold documents or view them on their own, it's just more cumbersome.
00:08:23.610 - 00:08:53.142, Speaker A: They can't just come to your office and go work in a conference room and have lots of boxes of documents around them and be shuffling through them and looking through them with you. These rooms, typically where you meet them, are small, very small conference rooms. Not comfortable. The lighting isn't great. This is a jail, right? Not designed for comfort or for ease of meetings. Yales take their mission seriously. In my experience of giving the lawyers access, you get more access than just his parents will get to him.
00:08:53.142 - 00:09:15.230, Speaker A: Again, it is a burden, and it wouldn't surprise me I'm not saying this will happen, but it wouldn't surprise me if the defense asked for a continuance of the trial date based on this. It may be that Sam does not want a continuance because he's there and he wants to get the trial as soon as possible. But the additional burden may mean there is a request for a continuance, which.
00:09:15.300 - 00:09:17.674, Speaker C: Means a delay in the start date of the trial.
00:09:17.802 - 00:09:24.910, Speaker A: Yes, possible. This will lead to a request for that. The signs do not point to that right now, to be clear, but that is possible.
00:09:25.060 - 00:09:31.810, Speaker C: And you also said that in this type of situation, the defendant is more likely to plead guilty. What do you think the ODS are of that?
00:09:31.960 - 00:09:57.882, Speaker A: Sometimes the defendant is more likely to plead guilty. But, yes, I think in this case, the ODS are not high. I mean, this case has been litigated for months now. The charges are serious and extensive. There's been no indication that there are plea discussions. Every side has been filing motions, doing the things you would do as you're really preparing for trial, not engaging in plea discussions. I'm confident just because I know how the process works.
00:09:57.882 - 00:10:46.406, Speaker A: In any case, there is at least some back and forth about the possibility of plea, whether the defense asks about it or the government just says, hey, if your guys interested, here's what it would look like. So that probably happened at some point. But whether there's ongoing discussions, I don't know. It's just, in my experience, some defendants, some clients when they're in prison, ever detained, they really want or are more interested in pleading. Part of that is because the jails typically are much you're in a mixed population with lots of other defendants, both people accused of violent crimes and nonviolent crimes. Whereas if you're a white collar defendant and you plead guilty, oftentimes you'll get sent to a camp, which is a much more humane facility, much more comfortable. Not saying it's comfortable, but more comfortable.
00:10:46.406 - 00:11:23.014, Speaker A: And you're usually only in with nonviolently accused defendants, so you're not with violent drug dealers, for example, or at a camp. So your fellow prisoners are more like you if you're a white collar. And so usually people, when they're out, they're not dealing with that sort of situation. Sam was at his parents home, which is presumably a comfortable, nice house in the Bay Area. Right now, he has sharing a prison cell, or maybe by himself because he's a high profile defendant, but he's in an uncomfortable prison cell all day.
00:11:23.212 - 00:11:30.140, Speaker C: In a moment, we're going to talk about why it is that Sam didn't just plead guilty. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible.

00:12:31.462 - 00:12:46.546, Speaker C: Today, back to my conversation with Brian. Sam is facing a trial in which three of his co conspirators have already pleaded guilty. And as you mentioned, there are numerous reasons why somebody in his position might do that. But why do you think he know?
00:12:46.568 - 00:13:31.114, Speaker A: I'd be guessing like anybody, of course. I think there's a number of factors probably at play. One is, I suspect that the prosecutors, to the extent they offered a plea offer and they're not required to, to be clear, there's no obligation to engage in plea discussions, there's no legal requirement that there be a plea offer. Sam could always walk in any day and plead guilty to any of the charges. He's obviously pled not guilty. But if the prosecutors have made an offer, and I suspect they have, it's probably for extensive prison time, I would guess 25, 30 years or more they're seeking, if he's going to plead based on the allegations of the loss here, which are billions in the scope of the number of victims, alleged victims and everything. So victims alleged in the indictment.
00:13:31.114 - 00:14:15.422, Speaker A: I suspect, for whatever reason, based on his own counsel, with his lawyers, and probably with his parents, he is not willing to consider that at this time. Now, again, his mind could change at any point and he may ultimately choose to plead. But I think the moment for him to plead and get the most credit for it was early on, because at that point, he could have pleaded, he could have cooperated, in a sense, with the receiver and done lots of things. They would love to pick his brain and figure out what happened here and what all these accounts mean and everything, right. You can imagine. Right. And so the three who did, we understand, are cooperating, and they will get credit for that, presumably by the judge who will sentence them, but he's chosen not to.
00:14:15.422 - 00:14:35.246, Speaker A: So I guess if you watch his media interviews that'll lead up to the charges, I don't think it's that surprising that he hasn't chosen to plead because the way he talked about what happened, the way he's presented himself publicly both before his arrest and since his arrest does not give any indication that this person is someone who is inclined to plead guilty.
00:14:35.438 - 00:14:43.974, Speaker C: Both sides filed motions in Lemonade on Monday. Can you explain what that means? And then also give an overview of what each side said?
00:14:44.172 - 00:15:10.826, Speaker A: Sure. So there's really two sets of motions, typically in federal court in a criminal case, one set of motions is early on in the case where a defense might move to dismiss a case or suppress evidence, call those substantive motions, in a sense. And that happened here. Right. The defense moved to dismiss the charges. The judge denied it, and that's over. Now you're at the next phase of the case where you're getting ready for trial.
00:15:10.826 - 00:15:44.906, Speaker A: And at trial, there's obviously a lot of things happening. Witnesses get ups, testify, exhibits are being put into evidence. And so both sides have sort of started to think about the trial, what it would look like, and they are telling the judge through their motions, hey, the other side shouldn't be allowed to make these arguments or introduce this evidence, or we want to make these arguments and introduce this evidence. And you should let us do that. And they were looking at the rules of evidence, typically, which govern that. And so judges want this. They want these issues fleshed out before the trial started so that they get a sense of what the issues are.
00:15:44.906 - 00:16:35.462, Speaker A: And it's possible they rule on them because it allows the trial to proceed in the orderliest fashion as possible. And the way I think about it is, if you look at a trial, it's not a perfect analogy, but it's like a play or a show, right. You want to know kind of the framework of it, like, okay, how many characters are there and what are the props? Right? And that's kind of what this is, who can get up on stage and talk and what props can they use? And you want to know that before you start the play. You don't want it free for all when the play starts, where everyone's just grabbing props in the back, trying to put them on the stage. And the stage manager in this case, the judge will be like or the director will be like, no, that shouldn't be outrageous. So not the best analogy, but I think that sort of is what's happening here. One thing to keep in mind is judges often reserve rulings.
00:16:35.462 - 00:17:00.158, Speaker A: So it's very often that you'll file motions and eliminate, and the judge will with all of them, or most of them say, okay, I hear your issue, but let's see what happens at trial. Let's see if that really happens. Let's see what the government says, or let's see what the defense really does. We need to see it play out a little bit. It's premature. That's a very common judge response to motions in the way. Now, some issues they will want to decide in advance.
00:17:00.158 - 00:17:49.694, Speaker A: There might be some exhibits or some witnesses that are so provocative or incendiary that if even just allow it to come into play, would just cause a lot of problems. Later, if the prosecutor mentioned it in their opening argument and said, we're going to introduce this evidence and then later the judge excluded it, that could be a real issue both for the government, maybe for the jury, and create an appellate issue. So judges do want to see this. Both sides filed extensive motions in Lemonade, not surprisingly in this case, it's a broad case with a lot of evidence. So both sides have filed those. They filed those earlier this week, the same day the latest indictment was filed. And the judge will then, with his clerks, review those motions, usually set up a hearing date and make decisions.
00:17:49.694 - 00:17:52.770, Speaker A: I suspect some will be deferred, some will be decided on.
00:17:52.920 - 00:18:14.870, Speaker C: Some of the ones that I noticed the government said were, hey, these are based on charges that have been removed from this particular trial, but we want to submit these types of evidence that are related to those anyway. They were around like political donations, straw donors, like foreign bribery. Do you think that will be allowed?
00:18:15.030 - 00:18:54.774, Speaker A: I think it depends. I think that was one the judge may punt on a little bit. So I think what the government did because of what happened in the Bahamas is we know they removed some of the charges, right? They dropped some of them. But now in their latest amendment, they've angled with, like, well, part of the motive or the reason he did this is so they have this money so he could do these things. So motive and why someone committed why you think someone committed a crime is you're allowed to put into evidence as a prosecutor, right? You needed the money to finance your high lifestyle. You needed the money for whatever reason or you needed to do this for whatever. So motive is always permitted to come into play.
00:18:54.774 - 00:19:25.010, Speaker A: The scope of how much motive you can get into and how much you can tie it back to the actual alleged offenses is in question here. I suspect the judge will let that in. He may limit it. He doesn't want what we call a trial within the trial, right? So he's wanting the trial to focus on the charged counts, not on counts that aren't charged, but typically putting in motive is allowed, and I suspect he will permit that to come up, not to the full extent the government wants, but to some extent.
00:19:25.750 - 00:19:55.414, Speaker C: And SPS lawyers also submitted their side, and they said that the prosecutors had repeatedly failed to meet the deadlines for turning over evidence to the defense. And as an example, they said that three days prior, the prosecutors had produced nearly 750,000 pages of slack messages from Gary Wing's laptop and basically requested that the government not be allowed to use evidence produced to the defense after July 1. What do you think is the likelihood that those requests will be granted?
00:19:55.542 - 00:20:30.662, Speaker A: I don't think they'll be granted. That's a hard one for the judge to grant. There's two reasons why that one is the judge could say, if you need more time, I'll give you more time for the trial. Right, okay, so there's an October date that you wanted, but you know what? We can pick a different date later on and give you more time. So that's a typical response to that kind of thing. Again, if the government produced it, like the day before trial or the night before trial, or there was a specific order on a specific date that wasn't meant, the judge might be more harsh on that. But we're talking about July and an October trial date.
00:20:30.662 - 00:20:56.954, Speaker A: I don't think the judge will grant that motion. I think that's the defense preserving an appellate issue or maybe keeping its options open for asking for continuance, which they probably are keeping in mind more than ever now that Sam has been detained pretrial. And so I can understand why they might file that motion. I can see the strategic reasons to do it, but I think it's unlikely that the judge will grant that motion.
00:20:57.082 - 00:21:09.870, Speaker C: And so what can we expect these next several weeks before the case goes to trial? And what are you watching out for? Whether it be something before the trial or at the start of the trial.
00:21:10.030 - 00:21:33.106, Speaker A: Both sides are going to be working furiously. I mean, this is the go time for the trial. The government is going to be focused on getting its exhibits in order, meeting with its witnesses and preparing them to testify. Because remember, the government, the burden is on them. They go first. Defense does not call anybody. So they're going to be meeting with their witnesses, and they're going to have a number of witnesses.
00:21:33.106 - 00:22:07.590, Speaker A: They're going to be going through the exhibits, and there's a lot of documents to go through. They're going to be calling out what they think are the key documents. They're going to be coming up with a framework for their case in terms of the order of the witnesses they're going to call and how they're going to be preparing their opening statement. And they're going to even probably start thinking pretty soon about their closing statement, because even though you think like, well, you wait to start your close until the trial is almost over. In this kind of case, you're going to need to start thinking about how it all fits together. Like the entire play right now. Right? So if you go back to my analogy, you can't just think about the first act and the second act and forget about the third act.
00:22:07.590 - 00:22:31.962, Speaker A: So I think they're very busy doing all that. They're probably still looking through and discovering things too. Doesn't mean they won't supersede the indictment again or maybe change a little bit like their focus. Right. They're still learning about their case. This case has moved along very quickly for a big case, a multibillion dollar alleged fraud here. This has moved along very quickly.
00:22:31.962 - 00:22:54.046, Speaker A: The defense is also equally busy. I'm sure they are doing this, and I'm sure they do feel jammed up with getting stuff at the end. They're looking through all these documents too, all this data. They're working with their witnesses. They might have some witnesses they want to call. Both sides will likely call experts in this case. I'm sure the governor will call many experts.
00:22:54.046 - 00:23:21.302, Speaker A: At least one or two tenants may have some rebuttal experts or experts they want to call. Those experts. I think in this case would focus on how cryptocurrency works, how blockchains work, and how maybe some of the financial mechanisms work here. Because there are complex you would need someone to distill it down and explain it, to analyze the financial records. The defense is probably doing that too. In addition, they're meeting with their client. They're coming up with their theory.
00:23:21.302 - 00:23:51.442, Speaker A: They're doing their own investigation. They may be interviewing their own witnesses. So both sides it's a ways off, October, but it's kind of a sprint at this point. I wouldn't be surprised if they're working pretty close to seven day weeks right now in lead up to October, because the last for every week of trial, let's say usually be at least two weeks of prep. And so that's how you have to backload multi week trial. They're going to be prepping starting many weeks more in advance.
00:23:51.586 - 00:23:56.600, Speaker C: And if you were to guess how many weeks the trial will take, how long would you expect it to last?
00:23:57.290 - 00:24:20.234, Speaker A: Based on the more slimmed down indictment, I would say several weeks, definitely. Obviously more than a week. We'll take a while to select a jury. Know this is a complex case in the sense know it's sprawling. And I would suspect several weeks. A lot is going to hinge on whether Sam testifies, because if he testifies, that's going to be probably several days too. And they might have their own experts.
00:24:20.234 - 00:24:47.094, Speaker A: So it wouldn't surprise me if this trial know two to three weeks. I don't know what the estimates they've given now. They might have to give some new estimates based on the new indictment. That's something the judge will be keen to know, because when they call the jury and they're going to have a large jury pool here, they'll probably do a questionnaire. They're going to need to know the people are available for those periods of times. Most cases don't last weeks and weeks. Right.
00:24:47.094 - 00:24:59.706, Speaker A: And onika is high profile. This is setting aside the Trump case, which is consuming all the oxygen in the room. This is one of the most high profile criminal trials happening. Yeah.
00:24:59.808 - 00:25:06.990, Speaker C: Well, I guess we'll have to see how it all goes down. Thank you so much Brian, for explaining it all unchained.
00:25:07.490 - 00:25:08.590, Speaker A: My pleasure.

District Court ruled in favor of the US. Treasury Department upholding sanctions against tornado cash, the decentralized privacy tool also used by money launderers that was sanctioned by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control last year. The lawsuit, backed by Coinbase and others, argued that the sanctions overstepped the Treasury's authority.
00:26:25.842 - 00:27:28.278, Speaker D: The court, however, argued that in spite of tornado cash being widely described as decentralized, it was still in fact an entity, quote, that could be designated under sanctions regulations. The Court also determined that smart contracts constitute property under applicable regulations. Bill Hughes, a lawyer at Ethereum development firm Consensus, noted in a tweet that the plaintiffs are likely to appeal to the Fifth Circuit. The decision, regardless, makes a significant legal precedent in the ongoing debate over the regulation of decentralized technologies. On Monday, Coinbase launched the Stand with Crypto Alliance, aiming to mobilize crypto supporters ahead of key votes in the US. Congress. The latest in a multifaceted defense against a securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit alleging it operated as an unregistered security seeks to protect what the exchange's executives believe are consumer rights to crypto and to advocate for clear regulation.
00:27:28.278 - 00:28:18.410, Speaker D: In spite of being spearheaded by the largest cryptocurrency exchange in America, Coinbase's chief policy officer, Fariyar Jihad sought to frame the effort as a, quote, grassroots effort. In a statement in an earnings call initially reported by the bloc earlier this month, Coinbase's chief legal officer Paul Griwal said that while the exchange wanted to work with regulators, it also expected to defeat them. Quote, we do think we can win. We expect to win, end quote, he said. On Wednesday, Coinbase secured approval to list crypto futures. In the US. From the National Futures Association, or NFA, becoming the first crypto focused platform to offer Americans regulated and leveraged crypto futures alongside traditional spot trading.
00:28:18.410 - 00:28:33.262, Speaker D: In related news, late last week, venture capital firms Andreessen Horowitz and Paradigm filed a joint amicus brief supporting Coinbase expressing concern over what they described as the SEC's, quote, regulatory overreach.
00:28:33.326 - 00:28:34.370, Speaker A: End quote.
00:28:35.030 - 00:29:52.646, Speaker D: A consortium of blockchain advocacy groups also argued that the SEC's lawsuit is an attempt to quote Usurp congress's authority end quote urging the judge to dismiss the case. As reported by Decrypt G. Kim, general counsel for the Crypto Council for Innovation advocacy group, criticized the SEC's attempt to, quote, short circuit the legislative process end quote highlighting ongoing congressional efforts to establish clear crypto regulations. On Wednesday, two bankrupt crypto giants, FTX and Genesis, reached a $175,000,000 settlement resolving a complex legal dispute involving intertwined loans and customer claims. Crypto lending from Genesis, a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, will pay the amount to FTX subsidiary Alameda Research, aiming to smooth FTX's bankruptcy confirmation process. The agreement eliminates the need for protracted litigation and provides near term benefits to Genesis and its creditors. However, a coalition of FTX creditors, calling themselves FTX 20 expressed discontent with the arrangement in a post Thursday, as Unchained previously reported.
00:29:52.646 - 00:31:12.238, Speaker D: Nevertheless, the settlement marks a significant step in the crypto industry, reflecting the broader complexities and the need for clear legal frameworks. The ongoing legal dispute between the SEC and Ripple Labs has taken a new, though expected, turn as Judge Annalise Torres of the Southern District of New York allowed the SEC to file an appeal while the broader case proceeds. The decision follows a ruling that some of Ripple's XRP transactions did not breach securities laws. The SEC now has until August 18 to present its motion, with Ripple's response due by September 1. The appeal specifically targets the decision regarding programmatic sales of XRP, or sales that happen automatically, usually with retail investors.

00:31:12.238 - 00:31:52.830, Speaker D: This is crucial. This comes as the SEC continues to delay decisions on spot bitcoin ETFs, including Arc Investments management proposal. The regulator opened a 21 day comment period for ARC's 21 shares Bitcoin ETF, extending the wait for a decision on spot crypto ETFs in the US. While the SEC has approved funds linked to bitcoin futures, it has not allowed any spot crypto ETFs, a move that, if approved, would let institutions otherwise prevented from investing in digital assets invest in securities that directly reflect the price of the assets.

00:31:55.256 - 00:33:13.766, Speaker D: Republican lawmakers led by the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, Patrick McHenry, are demanding transparency from the SEC and the self regulatory body the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, known as FINRA over the approval process for crypto broker prometheum.

The committee has requested all documents related to Prometheum's approval by August 22. Also on Monday, Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, filed a motion for a protective order against the US. SEC, claiming the regulator is conducting what it described as a quote, phishing expedition in its discovery requests.
00:33:13.766 - 00:34:25.490, Speaker D: The motion, filed by Bam Trading, the holding company of Binance US. Seeks to limit the SEC to four depositions of Bam employees and prevent questioning on matters outside the scope of the consent order. Quote at bottom, the SEC is conducting a phishing expedition instead of seeking to narrow the limited discovery authorized by the consent order to ensure customer assets are presently secure and available, Bam wrote in the filing. In a separate but related development, Binance announced the shutdown of its buy and sell service Binance Connect, formerly known as Bifinity, starting Wednesday, August 16. The decision to shutter the service comes as the exchange plans to refocus on its main products and long term goals. A spokesperson for Finance told CoinDesk, quote we consistently adapt and modify our business approach in response to changing market and user needs.

00:36:47.918 - 00:37:52.370, Speaker D: Some creditors, however, reportedly objected to the repayment plan throughout the course of the hearing, arguing they would be forced to take stock in a risky new venture. Judge Glenn's approval is contingent on Celsius advisors sharing information about the crypto industry's volatility and potential challenges to the firm's mining operation. On Tuesday, crypto custodian Prime Trust filed for Chapter Eleven bankruptcy protection, marking a significant downfall for the Las Vegas based company. The collapse of the firm that once transacted $3.5 billion a month was accelerated by regulatory intervention from the Navada Financial Institutions division, which placed Prime Trust under receivership in June due to insolvency and breaches of fiduciary duties.

00:40:37.292 - 00:41:07.482, Speaker E: Of his October trial. Sam Bankman Fried is being sent to jail. He had his bail revoked because he was accused of trying to tamper with the witnesses, which is, incidentally, what his college girlfriend called it when he tried to get to second base. The first instance of witness tampering was using a VPN to watch the Super Bowl. Can't a guy just watch football? Second instance of witness tampering was sharing his ex girlfriend's diary with The New York Times. Can't a guy just share his ex girlfriend's diary with The New York Times? This was allegedly an attempt to discredit her since she's testifying against him in October. Totally unnecessary.
00:41:07.482 - 00:41:37.190, Speaker E: Like, if he wants to discredit her and to prove that she's not of sound judgment or mind, he should just tell people that she dated him. SBS father put his hand over his heart as his son was led away in handcuffs. I would have felt compelled to do the same, overwhelmed by the rare sense of patriotism that just once in America, justice was served. His parents were both crying, which seems weird. Aren't they proud of him for finally moving out of their house? His team specifically requested a jail with good Wi Fi so that he can prepare for the trial. That also means he's gonna be able to read all the tweets about him. Talk about cruel and unusual punishment.
