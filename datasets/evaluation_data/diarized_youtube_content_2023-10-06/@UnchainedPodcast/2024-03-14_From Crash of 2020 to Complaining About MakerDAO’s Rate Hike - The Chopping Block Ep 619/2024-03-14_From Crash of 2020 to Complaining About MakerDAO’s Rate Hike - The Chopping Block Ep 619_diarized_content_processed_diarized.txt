00:00:00.090 - 00:00:13.450, Speaker A: It's so interesting that today we're having this wonkish conversation about makerdao setting rates like they're the fucking bank of Japan. And, you know, like, it just kind of shows how far we've come as an industry, not a dividend.
00:00:13.530 - 00:00:14.714, Speaker B: It's a tale of two quan.
00:00:14.762 - 00:00:17.402, Speaker A: Now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet.
00:00:17.466 - 00:00:19.994, Speaker C: Generally speaking, airdrops are kind of pointless anyways.
00:00:20.122 - 00:00:22.858, Speaker A: Unnamed trading firms who were very involved.
00:00:22.954 - 00:00:25.506, Speaker B: Alec ETH is the ultimate Defi.
00:00:25.538 - 00:00:28.120, Speaker D: Protocols are the antidote to this problem.
00:00:28.490 - 00:00:38.386, Speaker A: Everybody, welcome to the chopping block. Every couple of weeks, the four of us get together and give the industry insider's perspective on the crypto topics of the day. So quick intros. First, you got Tom, the defi maven and master of memes.
00:00:38.498 - 00:00:39.480, Speaker C: Hello, everyone.
00:00:40.330 - 00:00:43.446, Speaker A: Next we got robert the cryptoconissur and czar of Superstate.
00:00:43.558 - 00:00:44.460, Speaker E: Good morning.
00:00:45.150 - 00:00:48.710, Speaker A: Then we've got Tarun the gigabrain and grand Poohba at Gauntlet.
00:00:48.870 - 00:00:49.850, Speaker B: Aloha.
00:00:50.510 - 00:01:08.118, Speaker A: And finally, I'm Haseeb, the head hype man at Dragonfly. So, we are early stage investors in crypto, but I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice, legal advice, or even life advice. Please see chopping blocks at XYZ for more disclosures. So, Robert, you were telling us that you heard a great joke that you wanted to share with. The floor is yours.
00:01:08.234 - 00:01:17.266, Speaker D: This is for the listeners out there. And I heard this today for the first time. What do you call for professionals who work in crypto?
00:01:17.378 - 00:01:18.754, Speaker A: What do you call them, Robert?
00:01:18.882 - 00:01:19.990, Speaker E: A podcast?
00:01:22.490 - 00:01:30.040, Speaker B: Yes, I said that was a three out of ten, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's actually worse than that now I've heard it the second time.
00:01:30.830 - 00:01:32.010, Speaker D: You're biased.
00:01:32.670 - 00:01:37.802, Speaker A: I do think it ages better now that we're all four of us are here in this call together.
00:01:37.936 - 00:01:40.634, Speaker B: You're saying it's a fine wine. It's now a four out of ten.
00:01:40.672 - 00:01:59.202, Speaker A: Exactly. I think it's a great. Gotten better the second time that I've heard it. Okay, we're full on bull market now to the extent that we weren't before. Bitcoin finally crested all time highs as a press time, we're above 70K. Ethereum is hovering around 4000. It broke through 4000.
00:01:59.202 - 00:02:18.982, Speaker A: It's been kind of moving up and down, but a lot of stuff is ripping up and down the market. Gaming is doing really well. Obviously the AI tokens, as always, worldcoin Avax near a bunch of stuff is just going nuts. And the interesting thing. So I asked what people wanted us to talk about. A bunch of people were pinging me. They want us to talk about near.
00:02:18.982 - 00:02:36.842, Speaker A: I think they might know we're big Nier investors. The funny embarrassing thing is that near is ripping because Ilya is speaking at a conference on the same panel as Jensen Huang. That's a good reason for partnership Coin.
00:02:36.906 - 00:02:55.234, Speaker B: The Jensen meme coin was hilarious. The Jensen meme coin also, like, crashed 85% in an hour. Like, yesterday. I really fell down the rabbit hole of some of these salana shitcoins. I mean, meme coins, whatever, it depends on your prerogative of what you call them. But people have made all sorts of.
00:02:55.272 - 00:03:00.182, Speaker E: Crazy apps to just watch meme coins being made.
00:03:00.236 - 00:03:07.400, Speaker B: And people have these little betting markets on, like, will this meme coin be able to have greater than 50K market cap for more than 30 minutes?
00:03:08.410 - 00:03:13.370, Speaker A: Just betting on the meme coins is not volatility. Now you need, like, meta volatility.
00:03:14.510 - 00:03:18.134, Speaker B: I honestly am, like, astonished at the sheer level of degeneracy.
00:03:18.182 - 00:03:24.618, Speaker E: But the interesting thing is, almost all of it seems to be on Solana. I did see a couple ETH meme.
00:03:24.634 - 00:03:28.206, Speaker B: Coins, but honestly, other than really, there.
00:03:28.228 - 00:03:30.142, Speaker E: Haven'T been so many that have been.
00:03:30.196 - 00:03:32.830, Speaker B: Growing as fast growing expensive.
00:03:33.890 - 00:03:44.718, Speaker C: If the velocity of memecoin deployment stays like this, it's just going to be unsustainable from a fees perspective. So I think Salana has found PMF in memecoin shitcoinery.
00:03:44.894 - 00:03:52.662, Speaker B: I think the liquidity fragmentation piece on L two s definitely kind of hurts also, because this is the first time in my life, usually it's like people.
00:03:52.716 - 00:04:00.346, Speaker E: Asking me what crypto they should buy. And I'm me always saying, don't buy what you haven't done research on, I.
00:04:00.368 - 00:04:04.986, Speaker B: Don'T know, the old school bitcoiner dyor thing, but this is the first time.
00:04:05.008 - 00:04:09.958, Speaker E: In my life I'm getting all these people who I haven't talked to in.
00:04:10.064 - 00:04:27.570, Speaker B: Years suddenly being like, hey, have you bought poopy Jensen Huang Coin 59? And I'm like, what the fuck are you doing right now? This is unreal. People from high school that I actually do think this meme coin thing is.
00:04:27.640 - 00:04:30.478, Speaker E: Way more wide ranging.
00:04:30.574 - 00:04:39.666, Speaker B: It feels like NFTs in 2021 and where people who are just not into crypto at all somehow, and the only thing they know in crypto is Phantom.
00:04:39.698 - 00:04:48.182, Speaker E: They don't even know what metamask is. So it's kind of an interesting thing because of that. Yeah, it is definitely the analog of.
00:04:48.236 - 00:05:25.066, Speaker A: NFTs where it is this mass market thing, you can play with a small amount of money. You don't really need to know very much about crypto in order to actually play this game. It's very short term. It's very fast feedback cycles. It doesn't feel to me, yeah, I mean, we've talked about this before, but I think I see more and more people lamenting that this is kind of the financial nihilism of this cycle. There's a way in which that was true for NFTs, but NFTs had more of a cover story, which is, oh, no, this is about social status and about the metaverse. And there's, like, the artists.
00:05:25.066 - 00:05:29.830, Speaker A: We're supporting the artists. It had more of a defensible.
00:05:30.570 - 00:05:41.846, Speaker B: There's more of a cultural cachet than. Whereas the meme coins don't even try to have any. They literally, it's like the Scooby Doo.
00:05:41.878 - 00:05:47.530, Speaker A: Meme where you take the mask off the villain and turns out, oh, it was all just rank speculation.
00:05:48.430 - 00:05:56.190, Speaker B: But this idea that there's speculation on how long the market cap will stay up is one of the crazier. That is, like, the true degeneracy.
00:05:57.810 - 00:06:14.130, Speaker D: That's the most degenerate, because it shows how short term in nature the life cycle of these assets is. These are not like memes with an expectation that they'll be around years from now. They're memes where people question whether they're going to be around hours from now.
00:06:14.280 - 00:06:28.674, Speaker C: It all feels very euthanasia coaster esque. The meme that flips around the cycle is getting slowly smaller and smaller. And I feel like that way with meme coins where it's like, at this point, there's like 100 people trading a single meme coin.
00:06:28.802 - 00:06:37.178, Speaker B: I want to show you one of these sites that is focused on how long will this market cap last? This is a king of the hill.
00:06:37.184 - 00:06:38.762, Speaker A: What are we seeing? What are these?
00:06:38.896 - 00:06:50.080, Speaker B: This is called pump fun. These are new meme coins launched. And the market cap, they start with. And the king of the hill is the one that has the largest market cap in the last, like, 2 hours.
00:06:50.930 - 00:06:52.480, Speaker A: Oh, wow. Okay.
00:06:54.630 - 00:07:03.300, Speaker B: Honestly, I spent 20 minutes and many lost neurons watching this yesterday, but I felt like I learned a lot.
00:07:04.070 - 00:07:06.674, Speaker A: Wait, okay, what's the URL?
00:07:06.722 - 00:07:08.486, Speaker B: So that pump fun.
00:07:08.668 - 00:07:11.398, Speaker D: Okay, I'm going to have to do some academic research later.
00:07:11.564 - 00:07:14.280, Speaker A: Okay, great. Hold on.
00:07:15.050 - 00:07:22.794, Speaker B: People I went to high school with sent me pump fund links, and they're like, ha ha, isn't this fun? I turned $500 into 5000 because I.
00:07:22.832 - 00:07:26.986, Speaker E: Liked a bunch of pepes, I'm like, you know what I mean?
00:07:27.088 - 00:07:28.202, Speaker B: It's just like one of these things.
00:07:28.256 - 00:08:08.726, Speaker A: Okay, here's one thing that I want to clarify, because I think a lot of people listen to the show, and they're not necessarily monitoring markets all the time. So one thing I think also that we should make clear in substance to each other, the meme coin stuff is fascinating. It's also a very small part of what people are doing on chain, because almost all of this is on Salana. And Salana right now. I mean, obviously, Salana has a lot of activity. It's like maybe chain number two or three by total activity, which means that if you look at the top ten chains, most of the stuff happening on there is not this kind of crazy meme coin mania thing that is happening on Salana. And part of it is, of course, the unique nature of salana makes it well suited for this kind of thing.
00:08:08.726 - 00:08:45.006, Speaker A: Of like somebody coming, some guy you went to high school with, playing with $10 and trading random dog coins. But it is also something that it certainly seems that Salana has this cultural kind of position in the market, that it really worked for these low value nfts in the last cycle, and now that's transitioned into these low value meme coins. Of course, in absolute terms, the big meme coins, dogecoin, shiba, flokey, all this stuff, obviously, there is bonk on Solana, but the big meme coins are not on salana either. So the thing is interesting that Solana.
00:08:45.038 - 00:08:49.330, Speaker C: Biggest meme coin of them all, bitcoin.
00:08:49.750 - 00:08:50.820, Speaker A: Okay. All.
00:08:52.810 - 00:09:01.450, Speaker D: I mean, bitcoin is the OG asset that's based on social consensus to create its value. And so obviously there's two camps.
00:09:02.590 - 00:09:07.702, Speaker A: Are you seriously arguing that bitcoin is the same financial nihilism as all these meme coins?
00:09:07.766 - 00:10:05.466, Speaker D: No, I did not say financial nihilism, but it is definitely a distant cousin of financial nihilism in that most of its original value proposition of those who very early on became believers in bitcoin came from the same initial tendencies that lead to financial nihilism, which is a distrust of existing financial instruments and assets. It is a distrust of government. It was very loudly a distrust of fiat currency itself. It's all of the things that make you want to give up on the existing system were the sort of ingredients that catalyzed bitcoin. And it's those same ingredients that I think are leading to financial annihilism in faster, cheaper, more fun, more meme, more jokey assets like these made up 30 seconds ago, assets on Salana. And there wasn't this ability to create so many assets in the advent of bitcoin. There was one asset.
00:10:05.466 - 00:10:37.350, Speaker D: It was the OG, it was the original. It was the only asset, the only blockchain really standing alone for quite remarkably long time. Even when there were new blockchains, there were forks of bitcoin. I think if bitcoin were founded today, it would be very different, and I do think it's related. The same energy that feeds bitcoin is related to the financial nihilism that exists of these made up just now. Solana tokens.
00:10:38.330 - 00:11:19.270, Speaker A: Okay, so let me take the other side of that, because this is interesting, and you've got my mental juices flowing. So in some sense, okay, let's say that you're, I don't know, Tarun's high school friend, and you're coming on board to trade meme coins, right? And obviously the meme coins are stupid, and they have frogs and dogs and whatever random bullshit on them, and they're misspellings of politicians. But it's not that different in kind, in terms of what you're actually doing day to day. It's not that different from what you were doing when you were flipping nfts, and it's not that different from what you were doing when you were trading random ICOs. The difference is that the NFTs and the ICOs had a story. There were some. A story that was remotely plausible about why these things had intrinsic value.
00:11:19.270 - 00:12:05.010, Speaker A: Okay? And with the meme coins, there's no longer any story of why these things have intrinsic value. Here's the counterpoint I would make to that, is that the game that fundamentally these people were playing was similarly cynical through every cycle, right? When you're flipping ICOs, when you're flipping meme coins, when you're flipping NFTs, it's all the same feeling that you have, which is you don't believe any of this stuff. You might think someone else believes it, and that's why you're flipping this random fucking iot ICO that you did in 2017. But you're assuming that somebody else is that greater fool that's actually buying this, genuinely thinking it's real, right? And in some sense, perhaps, that was never true at all. Perhaps there was nobody who actually thought that the iot ICO in 2017.
00:12:05.670 - 00:12:08.840, Speaker B: I really love that you hate Iota so much.
00:12:09.290 - 00:12:16.070, Speaker A: I'm not talking about Iota. To be clear, they were a successful ICO. I'm talking about sort of the bottom of the barrel.
00:12:16.650 - 00:12:20.526, Speaker B: I think we got to get Eric wall on here if you're going to call Iota successful.
00:12:20.658 - 00:12:47.386, Speaker D: All right, what I'm hearing is, yes, this is a two dimensional axis, and that on one dimension there's financial nihilism ranging to trust in the existing system. On the other axis, we'll call it seriousness versus jadedness. And bitcoin is in the financial nihilism plus seriousness camp. And these made up 30.
00:12:47.428 - 00:12:59.874, Speaker A: I don't know that bitcoin is financial nihilism. I think bitcoin has a. There's a nihilism about high finance, maybe, but I don't think that's the same as financial nihilism. Right. Financial nihilism is that real value is bullshit.
00:12:59.922 - 00:13:04.070, Speaker B: Nihilism about finance is not equal to financial nihilism is what you're saying.
00:13:04.140 - 00:13:27.274, Speaker A: Exactly. Yes. I think you can be skeptical about the edifice of finance, but not be skeptical that there's such a thing as real value or there's such a thing as cash flow. There's such a thing like, if anything, the bitcoiners are. They're austrian economic, they're very loud about the fact that, no, the financial edifice you've built is insecure. Whereas a financial nihilist would say, who cares? What's secure, insecure?
00:13:27.322 - 00:13:27.946, Speaker B: Nothing matters.
00:13:27.978 - 00:13:28.858, Speaker A: It's all just meme.
00:13:28.954 - 00:13:34.754, Speaker B: I will say, I'll give you one other example about meme coins versus NFTs. That's actually a data point in which.
00:13:34.792 - 00:13:38.306, Speaker E: They'Re objectively different, which is NFTs were.
00:13:38.328 - 00:13:53.106, Speaker B: All about capping the collection size at this fixed, almost socially agreed upon 10,000 number. I don't even know why 10,000 other than crypto punks chose it. But whereas all of these meme coins.
00:13:53.138 - 00:13:55.650, Speaker E: Are like supplies that have a billion.
00:13:55.730 - 00:14:03.122, Speaker B: Doing all these kind of small size bias type of games where it's like, oh, we really don't care about the value of this thing.
00:14:03.196 - 00:14:03.434, Speaker E: Ha.
00:14:03.472 - 00:14:04.938, Speaker B: I can give you a billion of it.
00:14:05.024 - 00:14:09.466, Speaker E: You know what I mean? Whereas bitcoin and NFTs are actually very.
00:14:09.488 - 00:14:11.660, Speaker B: Much about like, hey, you only get a small.
00:14:12.930 - 00:14:38.006, Speaker D: Absolutely. And this is what a bitcoin maximalist would point to immediately in terms of proof of work, in that bitcoin was forged out of actual effort versus any of these coins, which no effort or cost goes into their manufacturer and it's a product of its time. I mean, props to Solana, the fact that transactions are so cheap that people can make hundreds of new tokens per hour.
00:14:38.188 - 00:14:43.938, Speaker B: I mean, you were just watching live right. That was like live new shit coins.
00:14:44.034 - 00:14:52.650, Speaker D: No, that was live. We were watching a live feed of just new coins being created. I mean, AIs are going to create millions of these per hour at some point, hoping to break through.
00:14:52.720 - 00:14:53.562, Speaker B: Wow. Hot take.
00:14:53.616 - 00:14:54.918, Speaker C: AI is on bittencer.
00:14:55.014 - 00:14:59.462, Speaker A: That's going to be the bittensor Salana collab.
00:14:59.606 - 00:15:00.010, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:15:00.080 - 00:15:21.822, Speaker D: The reality is this is, like, 10,000 new penny stocks being created every day. It's like, normally, though, to create a financial asset, there's, like, people, and they have to organize and they have to do something or come up with a story. And these brand new meme coins on Salana have none of that. There's no work required, and so there's almost an infinite supply of these tokens.
00:15:21.966 - 00:15:45.786, Speaker A: Yeah, completely true. I guess the question in my mean, when people look at this, they're like, okay, so this is just laying bare what we thought all along, which is that crypto is just a giant casino and there's nothing here but just people speculating and kind of this, like, p to p. Just idiots throwing shit at each other and hoping somebody comes out on top.
00:15:45.888 - 00:16:16.740, Speaker D: Well, I was going to say it's not strictly P to p or zero sum. And the reason why I say that is even amongst this jungle of thousands of new Solana meme coins. Right. Some of them sustain or survive long enough to have a market cap that continues to grow. Dog whiff. Hat is an example in that the aggregate wealth that's been created and the aggregate market cap of these Solana meme coins is non zero. There have been ones that break out, and you could say in, like, the total.
00:16:18.150 - 00:16:27.330, Speaker A: I don't know that I can agree that there's a positive sumness to meme coin. Even if they grow big, like, yeah, they can be sustained. But is that positive sum?
00:16:27.490 - 00:16:28.102, Speaker E: Yes.
00:16:28.236 - 00:16:30.374, Speaker A: They had to sell something else to put money.
00:16:30.412 - 00:16:31.970, Speaker C: No value being created.
00:16:32.130 - 00:16:37.462, Speaker A: Yeah. Ultimately, no. In fact, we create value society through productivity.
00:16:37.526 - 00:16:42.730, Speaker B: You could argue it's arguably negative, because all it is is attacks the validators against the tank.
00:16:43.170 - 00:16:43.726, Speaker D: That's true.
00:16:43.748 - 00:16:45.390, Speaker A: The validators are wasting their time making.
00:16:45.460 - 00:16:50.622, Speaker B: The validators are the mean. We should talk about the Jito thing, maybe also, right?
00:16:50.756 - 00:16:53.040, Speaker D: Oh, that's great. Great.
00:16:53.970 - 00:17:03.006, Speaker A: All right, so it's interesting because we're talking about Solana being this meme coin engine, and so there's this protocol called Jito. I believe robot Ventures is an investor.
00:17:03.038 - 00:17:03.694, Speaker B: We are investors.
00:17:03.742 - 00:17:04.542, Speaker D: We are disclosure.
00:17:04.606 - 00:17:09.414, Speaker A: We talked about their mega airdrop, which was the thing that kicked off the Solana bull run, and we had the.
00:17:09.612 - 00:17:12.278, Speaker B: Founder on here on the podcast we did.
00:17:12.444 - 00:17:49.518, Speaker A: So it's sort of like the flash bots of Ethereum. They kind of run this sidecar that people can run on their validators in order to extract Mev, essentially, from Solana blocks. And so it turned out that a lot of people who were trading meme coins were getting ruthlessly sandwiched in GTO blocks. And the sandwich attacks were getting very, very intense, because, of course, when people are trading meme coins, they're retail. They don't really know what they're doing. They're not setting very strict slippage limits. And so there was a lot of money being made by people capturing Mev by essentially front running, back running, or essentially sandwich attacking people who are trading meme coins.
00:17:49.518 - 00:18:43.566, Speaker A: So sandwich attack means you front run and then you back run to sell out, so you're not taking any risk. And so the Jito team announced that they were going to be shutting off their mempool service. Their public mempool service, which is Solana, doesn't normally have a mempool. Jito sort of exposes a quasi mempool such that people can see what's happening that's a pending transaction, and go package up a bundle around it and front run it or backrun it or sandwich it. And they announced that they were shutting this off so that the experience on Solana was going to be improved for users, and they weren't going to be front run as aggressively. This was largely lauded in the Solana ecosystem, but it seems to have been a response to the fact that so much of Solana at this point is a story around people trading meme coins. And the MEV extraction was getting to be such a big issue for people trading on Solana.
00:18:43.566 - 00:19:01.730, Speaker A: Now you guys are investors in Jito. This seemed really bizarre to me that it's kind of the opposite of what flashbots has done. Flashbots has kind of said, hey, we're accelerationists. This is the end game. Obviously, MeV is going to be extracted at scale, at equilibrium. So let's find the best way to do it. Solana.
00:19:01.730 - 00:19:12.320, Speaker A: As far as I can tell, Solana foundation more or less knocked on their door, was like, hey, yo, this is bad for the network. Please turn this off. And they were like, okay. And then they turned it off. What is your guys take of the story here?
00:19:13.170 - 00:19:17.614, Speaker B: I don't think that's 100%. I can see where that interpretation comes.
00:19:17.652 - 00:19:21.006, Speaker E: From, but I think the correct way.
00:19:21.028 - 00:19:32.098, Speaker B: To think about it is Jito still runs their auctions for slots. So if you look at their bundler. The bundler is still running, right? That was their main product.
00:19:32.184 - 00:19:35.374, Speaker E: Initially, the mempool was actually the second product.
00:19:35.512 - 00:19:37.366, Speaker B: I think one of the issues is.
00:19:37.388 - 00:19:40.150, Speaker E: More that in Solana, it's just hard.
00:19:40.220 - 00:19:54.506, Speaker B: To do this mempool like thing while meeting the latency constraints without revealing a ton of public information. That makes it even easier to sandwich more people. Whereas in Ethereum, you can actually do a lot of stuff to kind of.
00:19:54.528 - 00:19:56.202, Speaker E: Like delay, encrypt things.
00:19:56.256 - 00:19:58.154, Speaker B: Encrypt things in certain ways that might.
00:19:58.192 - 00:20:03.134, Speaker E: Take a lot of time, but then people have a harder time front running you.
00:20:03.252 - 00:20:05.246, Speaker B: And this kind of transparency that has.
00:20:05.268 - 00:20:10.686, Speaker E: To happen at low latency makes it.
00:20:10.708 - 00:20:15.874, Speaker B: Just easier for sandwich bots. So to give you some context, Jito, on the last day it was running.
00:20:15.912 - 00:20:21.346, Speaker E: This had ten k salana in tips. So that's sort of fees paid to.
00:20:21.368 - 00:20:24.466, Speaker B: Validators to include your front run and.
00:20:24.488 - 00:20:31.314, Speaker E: Background transactions in which at current prices.
00:20:31.362 - 00:20:35.606, Speaker B: Is like over a million dollars a day, right. In just fees to validator, which is.
00:20:35.628 - 00:20:37.814, Speaker E: Like, that is really quite high.
00:20:37.852 - 00:20:45.446, Speaker B: That's like 500 million. It was like 500 ish million annualized per year. So that's a lot of fees going to validators.
00:20:45.478 - 00:20:47.830, Speaker E: And you could see the steady increase.
00:20:47.910 - 00:20:51.786, Speaker B: Right, when the memes meme coins really took off. But to be fair, we actually saw.
00:20:51.808 - 00:20:54.582, Speaker E: A similar thing in Ethereum when Jared.
00:20:54.646 - 00:21:02.734, Speaker B: From subway, ETH and Pepe were very popular, right? And you saw this huge increase. So I think it's just a natural thing that these types of assets just.
00:21:02.772 - 00:21:09.582, Speaker E: Generally attract unsophisticated noise trading type of behavior. And so it's just easier.
00:21:09.646 - 00:21:12.206, Speaker B: And so I don't think that they're.
00:21:12.238 - 00:21:19.118, Speaker E: Kind of like, oh, we're never going to do it again. I think it's just they have to get an implementation that makes sense.
00:21:19.224 - 00:21:40.426, Speaker A: Tarun, I mean, you've always been the accelerationist among us, and you've also been the person who's like, Mev cannot be removed. Removed, always there, right? And so it sort of looks like they are trying to remove some MeV from Solana by removing this feature, that obviously somebody else could go in and create something.
00:21:40.608 - 00:21:54.762, Speaker B: I think they're trying to buy themselves time for coming up with a better solution. And I would argue that Ethereum sort of has done similar things in the past, right? Like when they had the centralized flashbots auction, effectively bought them time until the merge.
00:21:54.906 - 00:21:58.058, Speaker E: And I think effectively MeV, because it's.
00:21:58.074 - 00:22:04.414, Speaker B: Like this dynamic game, especially in a permissionless environment where someone can introduce a new smart contract, it gets a lot of liquidity, and all of a sudden.
00:22:04.462 - 00:22:09.560, Speaker E: All the mEV migrates from one type of strategy to another.
00:22:12.250 - 00:22:20.498, Speaker B: When you're designing the system, you have to be a little more flexible, because you might make some design trade offs that in production don't actually do.
00:22:20.524 - 00:22:38.858, Speaker A: But flashbots had a different problem than this problem, right? This problem seems like flashbots was trying to enforce that. People basically stayed within the auction, didn't go out of the auction, whereas here it seems like the problem is the whole MEV extraction that's happening, period.
00:22:39.034 - 00:22:44.994, Speaker B: Well, I think it's more a little more like the order flow. Auctions in Mev share MeV protect, right.
00:22:45.032 - 00:22:54.938, Speaker E: Where you can send your order flow to these protected mempools, sometimes encrypted. And so people can't see all of your order flow.
00:22:54.974 - 00:23:01.906, Speaker B: They get some information about the aggregate order flow before deciding to make their transactions.
00:23:02.098 - 00:23:06.070, Speaker E: And I think when you have lower.
00:23:06.140 - 00:23:17.482, Speaker B: Latency constraints, like you have to wait longer for box, you can actually run those more efficiently and make them more private. I think there's just a lot of design constraints, engineering wise, that you have to be very cognizant of.
00:23:17.616 - 00:23:21.126, Speaker E: And I generally think if your philosophy.
00:23:21.158 - 00:23:33.326, Speaker B: Is like, we have to have low fees and good user experience, perhaps at the detriment of validators, like, they have to run a lot more. I think over time, I've come to the following kind of pithy oversimplification, but.
00:23:33.348 - 00:23:38.594, Speaker E: I think it's sort of a thing where thing, I think can give the.
00:23:38.632 - 00:23:43.134, Speaker B: Listener, who might not be super familiar with this stuff, the easiest, like Eli.
00:23:43.182 - 00:23:48.418, Speaker E: Five, which is Ethereum. The protocol has users.
00:23:48.594 - 00:23:55.574, Speaker B: The protocol views its users as validators, right? Like, it views the validators as the users of the protocol. Like everyone should run one or everyone.
00:23:55.612 - 00:24:00.274, Speaker E: Should participate, whereas Solana views the user.
00:24:00.322 - 00:24:12.990, Speaker B: Submitting transactions as the real users. And I think Ethereum has this kind of tension between who's our real user, the validator or the end user? And Solana is philosophically like, the validator is just a service provider.
00:24:13.890 - 00:24:17.200, Speaker E: We don't really kind of care that much about them, to be honest.
00:24:17.810 - 00:24:21.774, Speaker B: And I think when you have that kind of philosophical objective, you get these.
00:24:21.812 - 00:24:27.922, Speaker E: Different design decisions, but at a very high level, I think when you really.
00:24:27.976 - 00:24:32.414, Speaker B: Care about maximal decentralization, maximum security, then it does make sense that your network.
00:24:32.462 - 00:24:34.610, Speaker E: Is built around the validators are the.
00:24:34.680 - 00:24:40.082, Speaker B: Customer, in some ways, of the protocol. And so I think this different philosophy.
00:24:40.146 - 00:24:42.774, Speaker E: Also is kind of a thing that.
00:24:42.812 - 00:24:51.594, Speaker B: Bleeds into this discussion. But I think there will inevitably be solutions figured out, actually.
00:24:51.632 - 00:24:53.802, Speaker E: In fact, I think with a little.
00:24:53.856 - 00:25:01.286, Speaker B: More engineering work and design, I actually do believe that you could get to reinstating it. But in a way that doesn't leak.
00:25:01.318 - 00:25:02.780, Speaker E: As much information, though.
00:25:04.910 - 00:25:06.894, Speaker B: I think that's kind of the thing to look forward.
00:25:06.932 - 00:25:09.226, Speaker E: To is like they're getting to that stage.
00:25:09.258 - 00:25:23.490, Speaker A: But okay, so if you get to a place where this auction is not leaking as much information, is that going to change the experience of the Geobodin meme coin trader who's still sledding? Huge slippage limits are they should still going to get ruthlessly sandwiched.
00:25:24.150 - 00:25:26.766, Speaker B: It just means that the sandwich attacker is taking on risk.
00:25:26.798 - 00:25:26.994, Speaker E: Right.
00:25:27.032 - 00:25:29.074, Speaker B: They're doing a stat arb strategy versus.
00:25:29.122 - 00:25:31.554, Speaker E: A pure, like, hey, we're guaranteed.
00:25:31.682 - 00:25:37.080, Speaker A: But like right now, I mean, in Memecoin mania, it seems like it would more or less end in the same place.
00:25:38.490 - 00:25:49.142, Speaker B: That's a good question. That's a good question. Conjecturally, because even on Ethereum we saw, when Pepe was crazy, we kind of saw the same type of thing. It just wasn't as severe.
00:25:49.286 - 00:25:50.446, Speaker E: And I think it's also just because.
00:25:50.468 - 00:25:58.142, Speaker B: Ethereum just didn't have as much demand. The users were trading much larger size versus in Salana, it's like very small.
00:25:58.196 - 00:26:01.226, Speaker E: Size, but huge amount of addresses.
00:26:01.258 - 00:26:02.406, Speaker B: 100K addresses.
00:26:02.538 - 00:26:03.860, Speaker E: Yeah, right.
00:26:04.390 - 00:26:08.834, Speaker B: I think the design trade offs are also kind of different. It's almost like this latency bandwidth type.
00:26:08.872 - 00:26:10.180, Speaker E: Trade off thing that.
00:26:12.870 - 00:26:14.194, Speaker B: Bleeds into this.
00:26:14.312 - 00:26:39.126, Speaker C: And the vast majority of Ethereum transactions still go through some sort of public mem pool type of thing. I don't know what sort of the ownership or the market share percentage looks like for not quite a mem pool, but sort of like this jeto pre block kind of auction. But there is a future where basically everything goes to Jito, even though founders have a mempool. And that would obviously allow them to sort of enforce the characteristics of a block based option that they want to enforce.
00:26:39.238 - 00:27:14.658, Speaker D: Right. The fundamental problem comes from the fact that people are broadcasting their orders or intents before they get settled in blocks, and it gives an opportunity for anyone to come along and profit. And the only true solution is either reducing the amount of information that's being disseminated, or change the structure of how blocks are created. And if you put everyone through a pre build that has a different information flow, then yeah, it can solve the problem. But as long as the majority of orders are still being broadcast broadly, there's.
00:27:14.674 - 00:27:16.070, Speaker E: Always going to be MeV.
00:27:16.570 - 00:27:24.890, Speaker D: And there's more MEV when the transaction costs are lower. If transaction costs are $0.01, you can rip off a user for $0.12.
00:27:25.550 - 00:28:01.960, Speaker A: Yeah, so, well, speaking of the fees, Ethereum is going through its own fee upgrade at the moment through what's called Denkun. So Denkun is supposed to be scheduled for Wednesday. So I think by the time this podcast is out, it should be post Denkun. But it's going to be one of the biggest upgrades for Ethereum in a while. There are two upgrades that are happening simultaneously, a bunch of code changes, but the main thing that's going to be happening is what's often called protodank sharding, which is going to include the introduction of blob storage. So this is the big thing that's supposed to make roll ups cheaper? Everybody is. Not everybody.
00:28:01.960 - 00:28:47.330, Speaker A: Weirdly, people seem to be kind of sleeping on it now. It doesn't seem like a lot of people are talking about it, but I remember like six months ago, it was all anybody could talk about was how excited they were that roll up costs were going to get cheaper. But there's now people who are increasingly concerned that, especially now with, as you mentioned, Memecoin mania and the amount of gas that's being spent on things that are not L2s. I think actually six months ago more of the gas that was spent on Ethereum was L2s and Da. And now increasingly it's more just people trading random stuff on uniswap. And so there's increasing consensus that this may not have that big of an impact on fees. It may lower the fees for L2s, but it's not very likely to have much of an impact on the fees for everyone else on Ethereum.
00:28:47.330 - 00:29:06.298, Speaker A: Any thoughts or predictions about how this is going to affect the L2 game? And of know by the time that this is launching, there's external DA, there's Celestia, there's avail, there's near, there's eigenda. And so there's a lot of different DA solutions now competing for people to post their roll up data there.
00:29:06.464 - 00:29:08.570, Speaker D: I delegate my prediction to Tarun.
00:29:09.390 - 00:29:17.086, Speaker B: I think the prediction markets are quite optimistic. I believe they're like pricing things pretty low, I think, still quite a bit.
00:29:17.108 - 00:29:20.094, Speaker E: Higher than Celestia, but quite a bit.
00:29:20.132 - 00:29:22.640, Speaker B: Lower than Mainnet right now, probably.
00:29:23.810 - 00:29:25.518, Speaker E: If I were to guess, and I'm.
00:29:25.534 - 00:29:29.538, Speaker B: Not 100% sure, I think there's like a factor of five to ten difference.
00:29:29.624 - 00:29:34.290, Speaker E: Between the sort of like celestia and prediction market prices.
00:29:37.750 - 00:29:43.506, Speaker A: If that comes to pass. That'd be pretty good. Yeah, a factor of 100 or more. Less expensive.
00:29:43.538 - 00:29:52.460, Speaker B: Yeah. That's why I'm not. I'm not sure if the prediction market is overly optimistic or not, because I do think there is kind of this.
00:29:56.270 - 00:29:57.802, Speaker E: If you build it, they will come.
00:29:57.856 - 00:30:03.278, Speaker B: Type of aspect to 48 44 where there's like a ton of people who are like, oh, I'm maybe building an.
00:30:03.364 - 00:30:09.534, Speaker E: L three, which is something that posts to l two, or I'm building something.
00:30:09.572 - 00:30:14.206, Speaker B: Else and like oh, if it actually is really cheap, then I start going to mainnet and I move to main net, right.
00:30:14.228 - 00:30:16.306, Speaker E: Because it's easier ux for the end.
00:30:16.328 - 00:30:23.134, Speaker B: User in a lot of ways. So I don't know, I think it'll definitely be positive. I think it'll push the DA layers.
00:30:23.182 - 00:30:26.070, Speaker E: To really have to optimize.
00:30:27.770 - 00:30:39.686, Speaker B: But I don't think it's as big of a deal as people claim. I think there was a really good analysis a while back from Alex, from Zksync about how the net bandwidth increase.
00:30:39.718 - 00:30:42.186, Speaker E: Is not really that much in the.
00:30:42.208 - 00:30:52.766, Speaker B: Current state versus the full dank sharding version. And I think the cool thing about the alt da layers, because they all actually are taking different approaches, like if.
00:30:52.788 - 00:31:00.762, Speaker E: I compare Eigen Avail and Celestia, is that they all are making different latency.
00:31:00.826 - 00:31:07.006, Speaker B: Versus bandwidth trade offs in terms of how much communication has to happen versus how hard it is to reconstruct blocks.
00:31:07.038 - 00:31:14.242, Speaker E: Versus whether I use a commitment scheme or not. And I think all of those things.
00:31:14.296 - 00:31:15.794, Speaker B: Are going to be the experiments that.
00:31:15.832 - 00:31:18.226, Speaker E: Show you which one users prefer and.
00:31:18.248 - 00:31:21.842, Speaker B: Which ones the users here, meaning developers, developers of roll ups.
00:31:21.986 - 00:31:25.846, Speaker E: And hopefully from those experiments Ethereum can.
00:31:25.868 - 00:31:27.846, Speaker B: Kind of take the best combination and.
00:31:27.948 - 00:31:34.522, Speaker E: Add it to mainnet. But it'll take a while. So I think it's sort of not.
00:31:34.576 - 00:31:40.234, Speaker B: As impressive of a thing right now than it was before all these alt DA layers came out.
00:31:40.272 - 00:31:42.986, Speaker E: Because I actually think when you look.
00:31:43.008 - 00:31:48.266, Speaker B: At, say like an application that has a lot of users, that's its own roll up, say like Avo, which disclosure.
00:31:48.298 - 00:31:54.354, Speaker E: I guess we're all investors in Avo is like something where they had real.
00:31:54.392 - 00:31:57.234, Speaker B: Users and the difference between the five.
00:31:57.272 - 00:32:03.806, Speaker E: X or ten X more in fees is huge because they're a perps decks.
00:32:03.838 - 00:32:06.414, Speaker B: And volume is everything for them, right?
00:32:06.472 - 00:32:08.566, Speaker E: And I think it's going to be.
00:32:08.588 - 00:32:13.026, Speaker B: A question of do we have these apps that are like Salana, shitcoin, meme.
00:32:13.058 - 00:32:17.286, Speaker E: Coin trading type of stuff where, yeah.
00:32:17.468 - 00:32:26.426, Speaker B: You need to be able to handle tons of volume like Ava, or are they going to be slower things. And I think 48 44 is sort of in this middle ground of like, it's good for these slower things.
00:32:26.608 - 00:32:28.106, Speaker E: It's not necessarily going to be the.
00:32:28.128 - 00:32:30.374, Speaker B: Best for say something like an avo.
00:32:30.502 - 00:32:36.526, Speaker E: And say, if Ethereum wants. I'm not saying Ethereum as a community.
00:32:36.628 - 00:32:38.926, Speaker B: Has a collective desire to want this.
00:32:38.948 - 00:32:42.094, Speaker E: Or not, but let's say they want meme coins back.
00:32:42.292 - 00:32:43.930, Speaker B: They want to relive the Jared from.
00:32:43.940 - 00:32:53.826, Speaker E: Subway ETH days, then I kind of think 48 44 is not going to be sufficient. There's certainly a ton of people on.
00:32:53.848 - 00:32:58.550, Speaker B: Twitter trying to be like, all the Salana stuff will come back once we have 48 44.
00:32:58.620 - 00:33:01.606, Speaker E: And that part I'm much more dubious about.
00:33:01.708 - 00:33:23.440, Speaker A: Yeah, I do agree with you. It feels, especially in this environment now that so much infrastructure has been built off Ethereum and the integrations have been built, and there's just a lot more willingness for people to realize, like, look, if I put my da somewhere that's not on Ethereum, not only do my users not care, they will reward me for it. They will actually be like, yeah, awesome, thank you.
00:33:24.130 - 00:33:39.934, Speaker B: The users of these applications expect Salana Ux, right? They've never made a crypto transaction before in their life until they downloaded Phantom and bought poopy Biden 27. And I'm trying to make up names.
00:33:39.982 - 00:33:44.770, Speaker D: But there's probably a new token with that name.
00:33:44.920 - 00:33:50.840, Speaker B: Yeah, but that's the thing. That's crazy, right? It's like those people, I think, could not care.
00:33:51.530 - 00:33:52.470, Speaker E: They could not care.
00:33:52.540 - 00:33:58.306, Speaker A: To be clear, I don't think those people are the ones who are coming to trade on Avo or using don't.
00:33:58.498 - 00:34:16.558, Speaker B: And I'm giving Avo as an example of like a standalone application has a lot of users, has kind of like a good ecosystem where they still value Ethereum liquidity, right? But they care about their UX enough to go to alt. And that's a trade off that I.
00:34:16.564 - 00:34:27.714, Speaker E: Think a lot of roll ups will make. I think certainly not the arbitram one or op main net type of roll ups, but certainly I think the other.
00:34:27.752 - 00:34:31.118, Speaker B: Roll ups will inevitably kind of have to make that decision.
00:34:31.214 - 00:34:37.026, Speaker E: And I do think the Salana ux attracting a lot of new users is.
00:34:37.128 - 00:34:39.106, Speaker B: Going to be very compelling for roll up developers.
00:34:39.138 - 00:34:39.334, Speaker E: Right?
00:34:39.372 - 00:34:47.640, Speaker B: They're going to be like, how do we replicate that? I think that's the story for the Alt da layers because 48 44 isn't quite enough.
00:34:48.730 - 00:34:49.978, Speaker E: So I don't know if that's a.
00:34:49.984 - 00:34:51.100, Speaker B: Prediction, but.
00:34:52.830 - 00:35:13.760, Speaker A: Okay, let me ask you guys this. I'd love to just get very quick predictions. So obviously, Protodank sharding, also known as EAP 4844. It took a while to get here. I mean, people have been talking about this for years. And now finally by Wednesday, hopefully it should arrive in mainnet without a hitch. It's not that much bandwidth, as you were saying, to ruin that.
00:35:13.760 - 00:35:37.320, Speaker A: How just megabytes per second can you actually send through this thing? Once we do have full sharding? Full dank sharding, which is we have many, many different streams. Highly. You can just imagine many, many different blob streams or many different 4844s working in parallel. Then there'll be a lot more bandwidth on Ethereum. What's your over under on how long that takes to arrive, Tom?
00:35:38.170 - 00:35:40.680, Speaker C: I'm going to go three years.
00:35:41.610 - 00:35:46.362, Speaker A: Three years. Okay, so 2027? Yeah. Okay. Robert, what do you think?
00:35:46.496 - 00:35:49.114, Speaker D: Four years, 2028.
00:35:49.152 - 00:35:50.326, Speaker A: Tarun, what do you say?
00:35:50.448 - 00:35:51.760, Speaker E: Three and a half years.
00:35:53.490 - 00:35:55.834, Speaker D: That was a sandwich attack. The opposite direction.
00:35:55.962 - 00:36:18.230, Speaker A: Yeah. All right. I'm going to take three and a half in a day is my bet. Yeah, I think that's right. I think that DA is external. DA is going to be. For a fucking mean blob storage is so much simpler than full.
00:36:18.230 - 00:36:21.090, Speaker A: Like, part of dank sharding is so much simpler than full on dank sharding.
00:36:21.170 - 00:36:27.094, Speaker B: By a long shot. I don't know. Implementation complexity is very high.
00:36:27.212 - 00:36:29.240, Speaker A: Yeah, four years might be, actually.
00:36:30.670 - 00:36:32.726, Speaker B: So the reason I think it won't.
00:36:32.758 - 00:36:35.420, Speaker E: Be that much longer than that is.
00:36:35.790 - 00:36:41.562, Speaker B: All of the alt Das are basically doing all the R and D and engineering work for testing all of the different.
00:36:41.616 - 00:36:47.520, Speaker A: They're doing the R D. Yes. I don't know about the engineering, whether Ethereum will actually import any of their engineering work.
00:36:48.130 - 00:37:01.858, Speaker B: I totally think they. I think it's actually like quite a bit of technical duress, both on the cryptography side of getting the commitment schemes working correctly and handling all the edge cases for inputs. There's going to be a ton of.
00:37:01.864 - 00:37:05.042, Speaker E: Code that I think will get borrowed, I'm sure.
00:37:05.096 - 00:37:16.758, Speaker B: Maybe it'll get rewritten, whatever, different language. But I guarantee you a lot of the lessons learned from the Altas will be the thing that goes in. It won't be like, oh, it has.
00:37:16.764 - 00:37:20.486, Speaker A: To get implemented in all these different clients for sure.
00:37:20.508 - 00:37:25.206, Speaker B: And that's the hard part. But I think the R and d part, historically, for a lot of Ethereum.
00:37:25.238 - 00:37:27.482, Speaker E: Upgrades, is the part that took a while.
00:37:27.536 - 00:37:28.538, Speaker B: If you think about how long it.
00:37:28.544 - 00:37:32.346, Speaker E: Took to do 1559, I think the.
00:37:32.368 - 00:37:42.506, Speaker B: Implementation was actually not as crazy as the R and D and research time that was spent on it. So I kind of think if we're outsourcing that, then maybe it's a lot easier.
00:37:42.618 - 00:38:05.510, Speaker C: I think it's also just consensus on the roadmap. I think we forget how often Ethereum's roadmap has changed over the past five years in terms of what they see, in terms of the future of scalability and how these things are going to work. And so it feels like at the very least, there's a clearer vision and consensus around dank sharding being sort of a future for Ethereum than a lot of the other proposed upgrades in the past.
00:38:05.660 - 00:38:17.254, Speaker A: I don't know. I would put a 20% chance that Ethereum just literally gives up on dank sharding. And they're like, look, all Da has won. It's like big enough that, I don't know, why bother?
00:38:17.382 - 00:38:20.860, Speaker B: Let's just like, I am not sure about that.
00:38:21.890 - 00:38:32.046, Speaker E: It's one of those things where I feel like you really do lose your, like, we are the provenance and settlement of everything if you give it up completely.
00:38:32.228 - 00:38:48.306, Speaker A: I mean, they gave up execution on shards, right? I don't think it's that much more to give up to just be like, well, in 2027, the future is kajillion roll ups and all these l ones. And Salana is the meme coin factory. And if all these DA layers that are already sharded and are already doing.
00:38:48.328 - 00:38:49.766, Speaker B: All this, well, I think that, do.
00:38:49.788 - 00:38:51.158, Speaker A: They really need us to do this?
00:38:51.244 - 00:38:55.094, Speaker B: Interesting thing about roll ups is you made charting pseudo permissionless, right.
00:38:55.132 - 00:38:58.038, Speaker E: You don't care what gets executed, which, right.
00:38:58.124 - 00:39:01.522, Speaker B: Yeah, arguably is more towards the philosophical ideals.
00:39:01.666 - 00:39:01.926, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:39:01.948 - 00:39:14.670, Speaker A: And once you have da layers that are restaked and they're kind of like, isn't that more or less what we meant when we said we were going to do protodank sharding? I think there's a nontrivial chance that they just say, never mind.
00:39:14.820 - 00:39:19.230, Speaker B: Okay, you say 20%. Does anyone else have a prediction on that chance?
00:39:19.380 - 00:39:26.980, Speaker D: Yeah, I think it's way lower that they give up. I mean, frankly, I think they see it through. It's just a matter of time.
00:39:27.350 - 00:39:28.740, Speaker A: Tom, what would you say?
00:39:29.270 - 00:39:57.178, Speaker C: Yeah, at that point, what does ethereum really like? I think bitcoin gave up a lot of upgrades a long time ago because it had its sort of own story to sort of rely on. But at that point, what is this thing supposed to be? You can't tell the story around it being immutable and sort of digital gold, like bitcoin. It's like this weird sort of hybrid execution Da layer, but it's not really the best at either of them. I just think that feels like a weird in between spot to be in the market.
00:39:57.344 - 00:39:57.786, Speaker D: I don't know.
00:39:57.808 - 00:40:15.210, Speaker A: I don't think dank sharding is that integral to Ethereum story. I think it was integral to the idea that we're going to scale through roll ups, but now the roll ups are scaling and they're working and if Eigen layer and restaked security and whatever, it's kind of like. Well, it's kind of like community run dank sharding in the same way that roll ups are community run sharding.
00:40:15.290 - 00:40:27.430, Speaker C: Yeah, I guess it just depends on how competitive it would be in that market. Who knows? Maybe there's going to be sufficiently good, but it feels like the rest of the markets just continue to evolve beyond from what we have today.
00:40:27.580 - 00:40:36.162, Speaker B: I do actually think that having too much fragmentation across alt da layers is a little bit like liquidity fragmentation across many roll ups.
00:40:36.226 - 00:40:40.390, Speaker E: And there is going to be some reason to coherent.
00:40:40.730 - 00:40:48.294, Speaker A: I don't think it's that similar to liquidity fragmentation across roll ups. I don't know, it doesn't impact your UX as a user.
00:40:48.422 - 00:40:57.566, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess it's true, I feel like. But it's like you care about these worst case guarantees when you think about Da, right? Like, oh, if this fraud proof is valid, right.
00:40:57.588 - 00:41:16.600, Speaker A: Which is why Ethereum says, look, if you need that worst case security, here is a blob stream. We'll slowly increase the bandwidth every year by 12% or something. Again, I think more likely than not they actually do it. But I do think there's a very nontrivial chance.
00:41:17.450 - 00:41:25.800, Speaker B: For the record, I'm a little bit in your camp, a little more. I could see that it's totally conceivable that that happens.
00:41:27.130 - 00:41:28.200, Speaker E: I agree.
00:41:28.650 - 00:41:30.138, Speaker D: Talking it out like this.
00:41:30.304 - 00:41:36.102, Speaker B: Yeah, I feel like you're actually convincing me a little bit. I was so much more like philosophically.
00:41:36.166 - 00:41:39.882, Speaker E: No one would agree to it. But laziness is.
00:41:39.936 - 00:41:42.694, Speaker B: The laziness always beats philosophy.
00:41:42.742 - 00:41:44.220, Speaker E: That's what I've learned in life.
00:41:44.530 - 00:41:51.406, Speaker A: Yeah, especially when you're winning. Right. If Ethereum is like, look, we're still number two, we're still worth a Kajillion dollars, it's impossible to pay fees, but.
00:41:51.428 - 00:42:00.800, Speaker B: Someone'S doing it, and you're not changing your level of decentralization, you're just making recovery from an attack slower in some ways, right?
00:42:01.170 - 00:42:08.674, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. It's like, look, if you absolutely must, you post it onto the blob stream or even post call data. We're not stopping.
00:42:08.722 - 00:42:10.502, Speaker B: I don't think they're going to stop trying for a while.
00:42:10.556 - 00:42:12.418, Speaker E: I don't think that theorem foundation agreed.
00:42:12.434 - 00:42:17.766, Speaker A: Agree. I think this is like a 2027 thing. I think this is a 2027 thing. Yeah.
00:42:17.788 - 00:42:23.420, Speaker B: I think your claim is like, if we get to four years and it's not launched, will it continue?
00:42:23.950 - 00:42:32.606, Speaker A: Yeah, I think by 2027, they're like, we're not even close to starting implementation. And do you think we're starting and.
00:42:32.628 - 00:42:35.920, Speaker B: Plasma will both be in the same sort of regard?
00:42:37.330 - 00:43:24.902, Speaker A: More like execution environments. It sounded so good on paper, but then, look, there's so much risk and what if Mainet goes down and all the teams are fighting and Da seems to be, is it really that central to our story that we're like the magical da layer as well as the world computer? I don't know. Anyway, all right, this is besides the point. There are a couple other things I wanted to get to today. We've been talking a lot about the bull market. One of the interesting stories this week has been from the land of Makerdao. So Makerdao, largest decentralized stablecoin, historically they had $5 billion that was in total reserves in Makerdao.
00:43:24.902 - 00:44:18.830, Speaker A: And Makerdo started freaking out because very recently, amidst all the bullish sentiment in the market, the dai reserves ended up dropping precipitously from 5 billion to 4.4 billion a week. Now, why did that happen? The answer is that dai savings rate right now is only 5%. And people are like, yo, I can go make a lot of money taking this capital out of Makerdow and going and farming and doing this and that and blah, blah, blah. And so Makerdow announced that they were going to do an emergency fee hike to raise the DAi savings rate from 5% to 15%, basically meaning that now it's going to be significantly more attractive to hold die. You're going to get paid more. And the interest rates, the stability fees, which are the interest rates you have to pay to borrow, were increased also very significantly to basically make it like, look, the cost of capital in crypto has gone up.
00:44:18.830 - 00:44:52.810, Speaker A: There's a capital shortage because everyone is farming and doing all this meme coin trading and whatever. And so all of this happened very suddenly, very quickly, overnight. This caused the value of MKR to go up. Actually, I think it went up like 15% or something overnight. On realizing that makerdao is now going to make a lot more money. But a bunch of people are also upset at seeing how quickly, all of a sudden the rate governance has moved without much notice to die holders or to MKR holders. It all seems like very reactive, which I think is freaking people out.
00:44:52.810 - 00:45:00.410, Speaker A: This is also very close to the four year anniversary of what you might remember was the DPEG that happened in March of 2020.
00:45:00.480 - 00:45:02.314, Speaker D: Today is the four year anniversary.
00:45:02.362 - 00:45:04.286, Speaker A: Oh, today is the four year anniversary. Yes.
00:45:04.308 - 00:45:07.230, Speaker D: March Twelveth is the four year anniversary of March.
00:45:09.010 - 00:45:41.290, Speaker A: Yes. I saw a lot of people were posting about what they remembered four years ago. The day that every market dropped 50% was also the day that die had a huge shortfall. So what's your guys take? Obviously, you guys are Tarun and Robert. You guys are different sides of the DFI wonks. And of course, Tom, you probably have strong opinions about this as well. Being the DFI maven, what are your guys thoughts on maker Dow jumping in and crazy runarounds on the interest rate?
00:45:41.360 - 00:46:36.010, Speaker D: Yeah, well, a couple of points. I agree with your sentiment that this hike from five to 15%, both on borrow costs and stability fees, seems incredibly sudden. I feel like a good process or good governance would have seen this increase from five to 15% in a staggered rollout over a couple actions as opposed to immediately. I mean, to me and to most people on crypto Twitter, this was a shock, how rapidly rates were raised. And there was a lot of warning signs that rates would have to raise. I mean, we've seen, and this goes circling back to prior conversations, things like, Athena, there's interest rates of like 30, 40, 50, 60% across the crypto ecosystem. Right now, the basis trades for the cost of capital are showing that markets are valuing capital right now at still far above 15%.
00:46:36.080 - 00:46:36.314, Speaker B: Right.
00:46:36.352 - 00:47:27.718, Speaker D: The fact that you have these basis trades yielding like 60% shows you that right now the market itself wants to be levered long because of how rapidly asset prices are rising. And so one perspective is that 15% is not enough, and we've seen weeks of higher interest rates across the entire crypto market structure. And so, first off, one, way too sudden. This could have happened sooner, and it could have happened more incrementally, even if they were getting to 15%. And two, I think the side effects of this aren't that well known. I think it's going to be really interesting to watch how this unfolds over the next couple of days and weeks. But putting your base rate at 15% is quite remarkable.
00:47:27.718 - 00:48:19.494, Speaker D: And it is funny that it literally is four years to the day after Black Thursday, when for anyone listening to this call who doesn't even know what that is, let me give you a quick synopsis of it. Asset prices fell by 50% everywhere and a lot of maker Dow CDPs were auctioned off. And because Ethereum and the mempool was so congested, nobody was able to bid on the CDPs or these vaults that created Dai. And so all of this makerdao collateral was auctioned off for $0 and it created pandemonium. And today, Makerdow actually looks very different than the way it looked black Thursday four years ago. Today, the system is not how most people remember it. It's not a system where all Dai is created through vaults owned by individual users, that it's either collateral or wrap, bitcoin collateral.
00:48:19.494 - 00:49:07.046, Speaker D: And if the prices go down, it gets auctioned off. Most Dai is backed by what's called the Peg stability module. And this was created as a response to Black Thursday four years ago. The peg stability module said, hey, if there's a market dislocation and people want to get out of Dai, we can't assume that there's enough bid in the market to soak up that Dai. Why doesn't makerdao the protocol have a big bucket of USDC? So that when you want to sell Dai, you're basically selling it back to Makerdal, the protocol for a dollar of USDC. And you don't have to have organic market demand to buy Dai the second you want to sell it. And you don't have this synchronicity between supply and demand for Dai.
00:49:07.046 - 00:49:20.046, Speaker D: The stablecoin itself and the PSM has done a phenomenal job over the past couple of years creating Dai price stability. Unlike black Thursday four years ago, the price of Dai has been basically a dollar since then.
00:49:20.148 - 00:49:20.414, Speaker E: Why?
00:49:20.452 - 00:50:11.230, Speaker D: Well, no one really wants to pay more than a dollar for a dye, and there's more than enough USDC to sell it for a dollar. And so the price has basically done a phenomenal job being pegged to USDC. And really what's causing this dislocation is that the PSM is being drained. And so when you visualize what is makerdow the system, it's almost like it's slowly returning to its roots of like, hey, there's not that many stablecoins backing this that are owned by the protocol. Instead, it's mostly volatile collateral. I mean, it's not like a black and white thing, but this problem of having to raise rates comes from the fact that they can't let it return to market forces on the price of Dai, especially when there's a decreasing holder base that want to hold die. And so it's a fascinating system to watch it play out.
00:50:11.230 - 00:50:25.362, Speaker D: And honestly, these are slow moving trains and I think Makerdow can watch them in motion and take more predictive actions than what got us here with this five to 15 hike over the last couple of days.
00:50:25.496 - 00:50:26.738, Speaker A: Tom, what's your take?
00:50:26.904 - 00:51:20.966, Speaker C: No, I think you said it right. I think people don't appreciate how much the interest rate environment in crypto has changed in the past two months. So in the post where they talk about sort of the emergency changes that they're making, they cite sort of ave tether borrow rates as. As an example of interest rates. And like, just for reference, beginning of February, 7 day average to borrow tether on ave was 4%. Even before this maker post went up on March eigth, the interest rate to borrow tether on ave was 15%. And so yes, I think people obviously expect maker to change rates more slowly as they have in the past, but the market is being very volatile and makers just reacting to that because they don't sort of have this bonding curve type mechanism or amm type mechanism that most of these on chain lending markets do.
00:51:21.068 - 00:51:21.730, Speaker A: And thoughts?
00:51:21.810 - 00:51:22.966, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think this is.
00:51:22.988 - 00:51:24.280, Speaker E: Just kind of like.
00:51:27.290 - 00:51:30.730, Speaker B: Exactly the rate environment being kind of compressed.
00:51:31.550 - 00:51:33.802, Speaker E: The fact that even, just like the.
00:51:33.856 - 00:51:36.074, Speaker B: General cost of capital in crypto has.
00:51:36.112 - 00:51:44.430, Speaker E: Gone up so much, the opportunity cost of holding certain assets is also quite high.
00:51:44.580 - 00:51:47.210, Speaker B: So it's just sort of this natural crunch.
00:51:47.290 - 00:51:50.570, Speaker E: I agree with Robert, though, that was a bit sudden.
00:51:50.650 - 00:51:52.586, Speaker B: Given makers history, I feel like they're.
00:51:52.618 - 00:52:03.300, Speaker E: Usually very gradual, prudent. This felt a little rushed, but I also at the same time kind of get.
00:52:04.070 - 00:52:06.606, Speaker B: No one wants to be in the position liquidity.
00:52:06.638 - 00:52:13.926, Speaker E: Is that when they kind of had their redemption event issue and I sort.
00:52:13.948 - 00:52:17.378, Speaker B: Of think like, yeah, they're being proactive about that. And that's like a thing where it's.
00:52:17.394 - 00:52:20.870, Speaker E: Like the relative rate impact your stability.
00:52:23.950 - 00:52:25.980, Speaker B: I think it will be interesting when.
00:52:27.470 - 00:52:30.138, Speaker E: If the market kind of calms down.
00:52:30.224 - 00:52:40.542, Speaker B: And how do you gradually lower this down? To me, on the way up is kind of easy. It's always easy to tell people that story. I think the on the way down.
00:52:40.596 - 00:52:43.360, Speaker E: Is the part that is, to me.
00:52:45.010 - 00:52:46.474, Speaker B: If they did this the other direction.
00:52:46.522 - 00:52:52.420, Speaker E: I would be much more like, what the fuck happened? But on the way up, it kind of makes sense.
00:52:52.790 - 00:53:35.810, Speaker A: Well, that's why Rune wants to put an AI in charge of governance. Right. This is a bit of a departure from the sort of kind of financial analysis conversation you guys are having. Because I was remembering, Robert, I completely forgot about the broken MKR bots that weren't liquidating in 2020 that caused the whole under collateralization. Obviously, it was more of a bug. It wasn't that literally nobody could get into the mempool, but rather that their bots couldn't get into the mempool because they were misconfigured because of how expensive the gas prices were at that time. And I don't know, just hearing you recount that story, I just kind of had this, like, twang of emotion.
00:53:38.070 - 00:53:39.540, Speaker B: You're going to cry on air.
00:53:40.390 - 00:53:42.286, Speaker A: I'm too hearted from all these cycles of crypto.
00:53:42.318 - 00:53:45.170, Speaker D: If there's a day to do it, it's the March twelveth.
00:53:46.390 - 00:54:04.042, Speaker A: It's true. It's true. Yeah. But there was really a moment when we thought in March of 2020 that maybe all of this is over. We had a good run. We built all these little kind of things out of sticks and glue, and we were like, oh, look, maybe it'll stand. And we're just like, no.
00:54:04.042 - 00:54:27.940, Speaker A: Fucking the world showed up and knocked over your little Lego thing, and no one cares that you guys are trying to build this decentralized financial thing. And they went in there and they auctioned off the stuff and some people bought it and they made it back. And now we're, like, complaining about makerdao monetary policy moving too fast. It's kind of a trip when you zoom out.
00:54:28.310 - 00:54:28.674, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:54:28.712 - 00:54:30.898, Speaker E: For the record, I'm not saying they.
00:54:30.904 - 00:54:32.834, Speaker B: Made the wrong decision by any means.
00:54:33.032 - 00:54:33.986, Speaker E: I do agree.
00:54:34.088 - 00:54:35.874, Speaker B: It was kind of historically out of.
00:54:35.912 - 00:54:37.266, Speaker E: Line with their totally.
00:54:37.298 - 00:54:38.114, Speaker D: I think it's the right decision.
00:54:38.162 - 00:54:41.720, Speaker A: They should have made it wrong.
00:54:42.570 - 00:54:45.240, Speaker B: They didn't learn the lessons of history's past.
00:54:45.690 - 00:54:47.574, Speaker E: It does always make me a little.
00:54:47.612 - 00:55:06.766, Speaker B: Bit sad about that aspect of crypto and that people just completely forget the lessons learned from the past. Almost immediately. They see number and or liquidity go up and they just are like, ra, let's try again. And a lot of it just comes from not doing much background research, which.
00:55:06.788 - 00:55:09.386, Speaker E: Is a little bit even more sad.
00:55:09.418 - 00:55:20.926, Speaker A: In some ways that's true. But you do also kind of need some of that in the world of people who are not going to hew too closely to the mistakes of the people who came before them and say, look, I mean, look, when you're doing it with other people's money, it's a different story.
00:55:21.028 - 00:55:22.186, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's.
00:55:22.218 - 00:55:24.590, Speaker A: I don't want to endorse that too much. I don't want to endorse that too much.
00:55:24.660 - 00:55:25.030, Speaker B: That's the.
00:55:25.060 - 00:55:25.574, Speaker A: The point.
00:55:25.692 - 00:55:26.760, Speaker B: I'm kind of.
00:55:27.290 - 00:55:38.374, Speaker A: But you remember bitshares came before Makerdad. Makerdad was like, look, we think bitshares did it wrong and we think we can do it better. And they didn't let themselves be dissuaded. They were literally inspired by bitshares. Even though bitshares.
00:55:38.422 - 00:55:42.938, Speaker E: No, I'm not saying that particular.
00:55:43.104 - 00:56:04.800, Speaker B: I'm just saying there's a lot of times, especially when the market goes up, that people start just like pitching you on ideas or projects or whatever for things that have clearly blown up or not worked in the past, and they clearly did absolutely no research, and they think they came up with everything themselves. For the first time that humanities ever heard this idea. And I'm always like, right.
00:56:05.890 - 00:56:09.314, Speaker E: It's like the opposite of academia in some way, right?
00:56:09.352 - 00:56:23.366, Speaker B: Where everyone's too afraid to even say an idea because they assume someone else already came up with it. In crypto, people have this arrogance that's like, oh, of course, I am the genius who came up. Which, I don't know, maybe that comes with the nature of the game, but.
00:56:23.468 - 00:56:26.710, Speaker E: It'S kind of one of these weird meta observations.
00:56:29.130 - 00:56:38.698, Speaker D: Well, no one on this call will forget March twelveth, 2020. No, it's fascinating. There's a lot of people who weren't around for it who are part of this generation of.
00:56:38.784 - 00:56:49.934, Speaker B: I remember I was founders. I was like half listening to this maker emergency call and half trying to buy toilet paper and, oh, I remember those.
00:56:49.972 - 00:56:51.390, Speaker D: Yeah, it was during the pandemic.
00:56:52.130 - 00:56:53.780, Speaker B: It was like the first day.
00:56:55.750 - 00:57:48.066, Speaker A: Oh man, it was such an insane time. I will say anybody who's listening to this, who wants to get deeper into DeFi or wants to understand more, I wish I had something to recommend. I wish there was a book or like a documentary or something. I think in some sense this is the issue with our industry, is that, yes, all this stuff is happening out in the open, but there's such a shortage of people who are kind of documenting it and articulating it and making it legible to people. All this stuff happened out in the open. There's probably YouTube clips of those governance calls, but can you really trawl through 3 hours of random people on a Zoom freaking out about what they should do about the auctions? Someday when the four of us are retired, maybe we'll work on some fucking crypto history textbook memoir or something. But yeah, it has to be a.
00:57:48.088 - 00:57:51.378, Speaker E: Series of TikToks where you have to.
00:57:51.464 - 00:57:54.610, Speaker B: Reenact each scene I don't know about.
00:57:54.680 - 00:58:01.734, Speaker A: Otherwise no one's going to watch it. By the time we're retired, it's going to be all in your Apple vision pro and you're going to see us.
00:58:01.932 - 00:58:03.558, Speaker B: 30 seconds or less.
00:58:03.724 - 00:58:04.440, Speaker C: Okay.
00:58:05.290 - 00:58:10.398, Speaker B: AI models that we write the prompts for that generate the video, maybe that sounds like Sora.
00:58:10.434 - 00:58:12.314, Speaker E: Like sora videos of this?
00:58:12.432 - 00:58:19.260, Speaker A: Yeah. Perfect. We'll license our likenesses and then some. AI will create the film for us.
00:58:19.950 - 00:58:23.242, Speaker B: I don't think there's any licensing of likenesses in the future.
00:58:23.376 - 00:58:24.246, Speaker E: Hot take.
00:58:24.368 - 00:58:26.942, Speaker B: I think that's going to be too far gone.
00:58:26.996 - 00:58:30.240, Speaker A: Property rights are going to collapse and it's just we're going to be in this.
00:58:32.770 - 00:58:36.046, Speaker E: IP for things like movie and.
00:58:36.068 - 00:58:41.386, Speaker B: Music rights might be just like completely destroyed. Like the current legal system can't handle.
00:58:41.418 - 00:58:44.734, Speaker E: It, tokenize it so the AI can buy it.
00:58:44.772 - 00:58:45.990, Speaker C: That Ip Nile.
00:58:46.730 - 00:58:48.566, Speaker B: Ip Nile. Yes, I'm far.
00:58:48.588 - 00:58:56.740, Speaker A: Is it going to go, Tarun? Oh my goodness. All right, I think we got a wrap. Thanks for listening, everybody. We'll be back next week.
