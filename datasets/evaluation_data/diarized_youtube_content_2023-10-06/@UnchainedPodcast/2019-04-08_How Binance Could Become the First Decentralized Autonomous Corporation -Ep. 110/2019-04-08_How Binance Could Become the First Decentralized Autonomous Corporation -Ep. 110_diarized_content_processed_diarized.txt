00:00:00.330 - 00:00:00.880, Speaker A: You.
00:00:04.210 - 00:00:38.050, Speaker B: Hi, everyone. Welcome to Unchained, your no Hype resource for all things crypto. I'm your host, Laura Shin. I've got one more announcement about my live podcast recording with Vitalik, Buterin we have chosen a venue. On March 20, Vitalik and I will be on stage at Columbia Journalism School in the Joseph D. Jamal lecture hall on the third floor. As I said on Twitter, this is especially meaningful for me because I went to Columbia J School and never imagined when I went there that I'd be holding an event in the same building eleven years hence.
00:00:38.050 - 00:01:07.538, Speaker B: This choice of venue actually has nothing to do with my alumni status. It is pure serendipity, which makes it all the sweeter. The evening starts at 06:00 P.m. With food and drinks. Vitalik and I will start our conversation at seven and will wrap up around 815. There will be a short Q and A at the end, plus a few giveaways, and we'll round out the night with more drinks and networking until 09:00 p.m.. If you haven't yet bought your tickets, I suggest you do so ASAP, as there are only a few left.
00:01:07.538 - 00:01:42.842, Speaker B: Go to the eventbrite link inside your podcast player now to get a seat at what is shaping up to be a fabulous event. Also, if you're a podcast listener not based in New York, you can pre submit a video of yourself asking Vitalika question. I'll select a few to play during the event. Just record a short video of yourself 1 minute max, stating your first and last name, location and affiliation. If relevant and asking your question, email it to hello@unchainedpodcast.com with the subject line Video Question. Otherwise, I hope to see you on March 20 at 06:00 P.m.
00:01:42.842 - 00:02:03.170, Speaker B: At the first Unchained Live for a Night, delving into the pressing questions about whether Ethereum is losing its lead, how Vitalik views the competition, heating up in the smart contract, space, governance and more. It's going to be a substantive fabulous conversation, so get your tickets now and I will see you at Columbia within months.
00:02:03.240 - 00:02:21.222, Speaker C: Cryptocurrency anti money laundering regulations. Go global. Are you ready? Avoid stiff, penalties or blacklisting by deploying effective anti money laundering tools for exchanges and crypto businesses the same tools used by regulators, CyberTrace is securing the crypto economy.
00:02:21.366 - 00:02:38.602, Speaker B: The topic or topics of today's episode are Binance, Binance Chain and BNB Tokens. My guests who will be discussing this are Kyle Samani and Tushar Jain, managing partners of Multicoin Capital. Welcome, Kyle and Tushar.
00:02:38.746 - 00:02:41.262, Speaker A: Hey, Laura, great to be on. Thanks for having us.
00:02:41.396 - 00:02:43.360, Speaker D: Hey, Laura, great to be on again.
00:02:43.730 - 00:03:33.534, Speaker B: So let's just be clear for the listeners. Your firm has invested in BNB Tokens, so I just want everyone listening to be aware of that in general. Hopefully most listeners are aware that anytime I have investors on my show, of course they're going to talk positively about anything they've invested in. But Kyle and Tushar, I wanted you to come on the show because Multicoin recently did a pretty in depth look at Binance and its strategy to decentralize. And Binance is obviously a hugely important company in the crypto space. And there were a lot of really interesting observations and bold forecasts you guys made that I thought we could unpack. And for listeners who haven't listened to my episode with CZ from last summer, I urge you to do so, to hear more about Binance's background and also really just to get the flavor of what CZ is like.
00:03:33.534 - 00:03:55.080, Speaker B: Honestly, I'm not going to lie, that's probably my favorite interview I've ever done. He's just the kind of person who really has strength in his convictions and it really shows and it was just a fabulous conversation. But so, Kyle and Tushar, why don't we start by describing the success of Finance and its centralized exchange so far?
00:03:55.450 - 00:05:06.506, Speaker D: Yeah, absolutely. So this is Tushar, and we've been watching Finance and their execution ever since they launched in 2017. And we have been incredibly impressed by how well they've executed at really just dominating the crypto spot trading market. They have by far the most volume of any other crypto exchange that offers spot trading, and in fact, they have more volume than the other top three competitors combined. Now, all of these numbers are subject to some modification to remove some of what we call wash trading. So if you go look on CoinMarketCap and you look at top exchanges, those numbers aren't exactly accurate. So in our report and in our research, we referenced some findings from the Blockchain Transparency Institute, which looked at all of these exchanges and tried to determine the amount of real volume as opposed to just reported volume.
00:05:06.506 - 00:05:25.646, Speaker D: Binance has also been incredibly aggressive in listing tokens, and they offer the most token pairs of any of the major spot trading exchanges out. You know, their dominance in both volume as well as token pairs is unquestioned.
00:05:25.838 - 00:05:57.710, Speaker B: And one thing that I always just love about their story, and again, if you haven't listened to the episode with CZ from last summer, definitely do so because he describes on there how he had never even heard of an ICO. And then within, like, I think I forget the time frame. It was just a few weeks. I forget like three weeks or 15 days or something. After hearing of an ICO for the first time, he was holding an ICO and he raised I shouldn't have looked these numbers up before we started again, but I think it was like was it 15 million?
00:05:57.860 - 00:05:59.838, Speaker D: Yeah, it was about $15 million.
00:06:00.004 - 00:06:26.710, Speaker B: Yeah. And then within five months became the number one crypto exchange. Obviously, the cliche term to describe that is a meteoric rise, but that is just such a good description of what happened there. So one of the things that you mentioned in your report was that what's been especially impressive about Binance becoming so dominant is the fact that it doesn't offer any Fiat pairs. So why is that such an impressive.
00:06:27.610 - 00:07:30.122, Speaker A: So, you know, if you consider getting into crypto, right, assuming you have no crypto, you want to convert some of your Fiat money into Bitcoin or Ethereum or something else, and you need to be able to do that with a Fiat to crypto exchange. So Coinbase in the US is probably the most dominant fiat to crypto exchange in different countries around the world. There are other exchanges that have kind of local dominance for getting people onboarded in the crypto. But then a lot of an exchange like Binance, binance, until very recently did not have any Fiat to crypto support at all. It only supported trading crypto to crypto. And so what's actually probably most remarkable and really most counterintuitive about Binance's rise has been that they became the world's dominant spot trading exchange despite the fact that they did not have any Fiat crypto. So that means people came in Fiat crypto on Coinbase or on Huawei or on Bithum or whatever exchange in their local jurisdiction, got into Bitcoin or Ether, and then went to Binance and then kind of did most of the rest of their trading there.
00:07:30.122 - 00:07:36.178, Speaker A: And it's pretty remarkable that that's led to Binance being the most dominant exchange. Yep.
00:07:36.214 - 00:08:14.406, Speaker D: And I'd like to add a few more stats here that we pulled up from the report that we published recently. And what we see here is that Finance is the top traded exchange for 82% of the top 50 tokens, and Finance is facilitating 36.6% of global crypto spot trading volumes. So those are just some numbers to help put that into perspective. And to have accomplished that without having any support for fiat currencies during the period that we're describing is quite simply phenomenal.
00:08:14.598 - 00:08:46.950, Speaker B: Yeah, because of course, at that time when Finance had just launched, that was the summer of 2017. So at that moment, kind of awareness of crypto maybe was sort of hitting the mainstream, but definitely it was before we saw the real massive run up with all kinds of everyday people getting into crypto, which happened more in the fall. So after that crazy bull run, how has Binance been faring, so far in this crypto winter?
00:08:48.010 - 00:09:38.840, Speaker D: It seems from our observations that Binance did not make the same mistake that many other organizations in crypto made, where they overinvested and they grew too large during the bull market and had to go and cut things back through crypto winter from what we have found, finance has not undergone any meaningful layoffs. They actually seem to be growing at a healthy pace. And from the latest information that we have, they have about 400 employees around the world. So I think that they have been quite disciplined in how they grew. And this is paying off for them now as they're able to continue investing throughout the crypto winter while some other organizations maybe are having to pull back.
00:09:39.210 - 00:10:18.770, Speaker B: Yeah, I wonder if some of that discipline you're talking about know I didn't ask CZ this, but I do remember I asked him kind of about all his newfound wealth, and he said something about how it hasn't really driven him to purchase or spend anything flashy. Because he said just the knowledge that he could buy that was enough. So maybe if he has sort of a similar kind of attitude toward his be to be pretty frugal or just to not let things go to his head, then that might have been the case. And what about trading volumes on Binance during this crypto winter?
00:10:19.110 - 00:11:03.958, Speaker D: So trading volumes just if you denominate in Fiat, just are generally going to match market prices. So you can see that trading volumes across all exchanges are down about the same as the market is down. So that has definitely affected Binance just as much as it's affected the other exchanges. From our analysis, this was all proportional and none of the major exchanges, the Binance, Bitfinex, Coinbase, Kraken and other top exchanges of the world seem to have benefited or been hurt disproportionately through crypto winter in terms of volume.
00:11:04.154 - 00:11:25.094, Speaker B: And I know some people have been making noise about Coinbase seeming to have changed its philosophy entirely, almost as some people are surmising it's kind of reaching for revenue. Do you feel like Binance has changed any part of its operating ethos, I guess due to the fact that volumes are down?
00:11:25.292 - 00:11:56.530, Speaker A: No, we don't really think it has. I mean, the most remarkable thing about Binance is that they've really executed this regulatory arbitrage strategy from inception. They moved headquarters, I think five times, if I'm not mistaken. And so they're just kind of structurally a very decentralized organization and they have been since inception. Their 400 employees are spread across 40 countries or so. Given that by finance has been pretty true to their mission of enabling people to I think they call it I think it's exchange anything. Or exchange the world.
00:11:56.530 - 00:12:41.390, Speaker A: Exchange the world, yeah, that's the tagline. And it's been pretty clear from day one that that's been the mission and their growth path and trajectory has aligned very strongly to that. If you look at all of the new initiatives they're rolling out over the course of 2019, those all are really just an acceleration of that mission. So things like finance chain and the decentralized exchange, the Dex, that has very large implications for the future of Binance team and employees launchpad as a capital formation and fundraising platform. Look at Binance research, look at the Fiat exchanges. I mean, everything they're doing is in support of that mission, but doing so in a way to do it in a compliant way and to do it in a way that bridges the old world. To the new world.
00:12:41.540 - 00:13:08.540, Speaker B: Yeah, and we're going to get into all of that more deeply in a second. But I want to establish a little bit more stuff about binance before we get into its decentralization. You know, we've been talking about kind of what it's been doing or just how it hasn't seemed to really change its strategy, but so what business moves has it been making this past know, you know, adding Fiat is one of like what are some of the things that you see it's been putting into place?
00:13:09.150 - 00:14:08.422, Speaker D: Yep, I think Binance has been fairly aggressive in expanding out their business and taking advantage of this bear market as an opportunity to really build. And so a few of the key initiatives are, as you mentioned, Fiat exchanges. They brought on Fiat exchanges in Jersey which supports euros and pounds. They I believe, have also brought on their Singapore exchange as well as one in Uganda. And from what we found in our research, it seems their plans are to bring on ten crypto to Fiat exchanges over the course of 2019. So that's a fairly meaningful initiative on its own. On top of that, we have the launch of finance chain which will offer a decentralized exchange for which they released a testnet fairly recently.
00:14:08.422 - 00:15:33.910, Speaker D: And this decentralized exchange is, in our opinion, the most important and largest initiative that Binance is taking on right now. And just to show how committed they are to the decentralized exchange, in order to attract volumes to the decentralized exchange, the fees are actually lower on the decentralized exchange versus a centralized exchange, something that we haven't really seen elsewhere. In addition to that, they've recently executed the first two successful sales on the Binance launchpad platform, which is effectively a platform for ICOs or initial Coin offerings. And they have a schedule set out where they're going to be doing one sale per month. Both of the first sales that they did sold out extremely quickly, so they've shown some success with the launchpad product as well. And last but not least, they have been devoting a lot of energy to their research initiative and really sharing research with their clients and their users and trying to create a better informed crypto community. And while that doesn't necessarily have the direct monetization opportunities as those first three initiatives, I think it's also incredibly impactful in being a very mission driven culture.
00:15:33.910 - 00:15:37.960, Speaker D: I see how this fits with what Binance is doing.
00:15:38.270 - 00:15:43.340, Speaker B: And can you also describe the Secure Asset Fund for users and why that's important?
00:15:43.790 - 00:17:02.500, Speaker D: Oh, absolutely. So many exchanges have been targets of hacks or other types of security problems in the know. Everyone knows about the infamous incident and I mean even more recently we have things like Quadriga in Canada and there were a few attacks last year as well, primarily on some Asian exchanges if I recall correctly. And so in response to those types of events, binance has created what they call the Safu Fund safu, which I think is named after a typo that CZ had on Twitter. Just like Hodl, we in crypto love our typos becoming memes, but they went and they created the Safu fund and I believe that is capitalized through some of the trading fees that Binance earns and is made available to ensure against losses in the event that Binance's security is breached. However, as far as we are aware, we have no evidence that Binance's security has ever been breached or that any funds have ever been lost. But it's nice to know that there is an insurance fund in place in the event that that does happen.
00:17:02.870 - 00:17:11.750, Speaker B: And I also wanted to ask about this fact which I find pretty distinctive about Binance. It doesn't have a bank account, so where does it hold its assets?
00:17:12.170 - 00:17:44.640, Speaker D: So Binance holds their crypto assets in a variety know, cold storage wallets. From what we understand, those are distributed across the world. And I believe that the Binance fiat to crypto exchanges have bank accounts in the jurisdictions in which they're, you know, you'd expect Binance Jersey to have a bank account in Jersey and Binance Singapore will have a bank account in Singapore, but the core entity is still free of the fiat system.
00:17:45.010 - 00:17:52.914, Speaker B: And so if they're accepting payment for something, it has to be this other party has to pay them in crypto. Is that how that works?
00:17:53.112 - 00:18:20.706, Speaker D: I believe so. And I believe they also pay people in crypto. Now, I know that a large percentage, I think the vast majority of their employees take a significant part of their salaries in BNB tokens. But other cryptos that are used to pay employees most likely include assets like Bitcoin or USDC and other stablecoins. Those are quite useful for payments.
00:18:20.838 - 00:18:22.960, Speaker B: And why does it not have a bank account?
00:18:23.570 - 00:18:48.680, Speaker D: I think that the regulatory arbitrage strategy which they undertook in the early days would have probably been harder to execute if they were reliant on a bank account. And given the fact that they were operating only a crypto to crypto exchange and didn't have any fiat support, I think CZ and Team probably made the determination that a bank account was more trouble than it was worth at the time.
00:18:49.210 - 00:19:01.130, Speaker B: And this goes back to, I think, a comment maybe it was Kyle made earlier, which is about how it's not clear which government has jurisdiction over Binance. So why is that not clear and why is that significant?
00:19:01.470 - 00:19:58.154, Speaker A: Yeah, it's not that any one government doesn't have this jurisdiction, it's just that Binance operates across many jurisdictions. They have now settled kind of a home base in Singapore. They also have set up another HQ one, HQ Two kind of a thing in Malta. It appears they're working on some sort of HQ Three in South America somewhere, although that's still TBD, where that's going to end up? They are subject to jurisdictions in those local regions, but they now have the level of scale such that they can negotiate with governments and get favorable treatment and guarantees that they're not going to get, like finance launched in China in July 2017 and two months later the Chinese government shut down crypto. That was obviously a very scarring experience for finance. And so now I think they operate on a go forward basis. They're going to try and structure deals with regional governments to ensure that something like that doesn't happen again.
00:19:58.352 - 00:20:46.938, Speaker B: So this is something that I pressed CZ on in my episode with him, and I did recently see, he tweeted that he felt like some of the questions were misleading, which I have a feeling what he's referencing is this point in our discussion where it wasn't clear to me that he fully understood. Kind of like how a security is defined in the US. Which is obviously different than other jurisdictions. Or maybe he does know. But at least when it comes to SEC, I think that they say if you're serving US customers, then they have jurisdiction. So I noticed in your report you said that you actually thought that Binance had little risk of being prosecuted for listing unregistered securities. And of course with a huge amount of tokens they have most likely, at least a few probably are.
00:20:46.938 - 00:20:49.900, Speaker B: So why do you think there is little risk of that?
00:20:50.610 - 00:22:02.306, Speaker D: There's a couple of reasons. One reason is that we have seen that the SEC and other American regulators are really taking a good faith approach to the industry. We haven't seen the regulators really go after anyone who was operating in good faith and who did the best to comply with the regulations, given how gray the regulations really are. And from our research specifically looking into Binance's listing process, it appears that they're operating in good faith. And so we think that they are no more at risk of being in violation of listing potential security know any other know an exchange like Kraken or Coinbase or Bitconx. And so we don't think that the SEC is likely to go after any one of those exchanges alone given that they've all engaged in the same activity. And we do think that the good faith approach practiced by Binance in this case does derisk it a little bit.
00:22:02.306 - 00:22:21.590, Speaker D: Now that doesn't mean that there isn't a risk there that's definitely a risk, there's an unknown that how will the regulators actually act and what happens from here. But all the evidence that we have so far points towards actors who have acted in good faith or not at risk.
00:22:21.750 - 00:22:42.538, Speaker B: And why do you say you don't feel like their risk is any greater than these other exchanges? Because they have still such a larger number of tokens that they offer. Maybe the argument could simply be that they just offered many more than these other exchanges so they might be more.
00:22:42.564 - 00:23:11.814, Speaker D: Of a target plausible. But I mean you look at Coinbase just listed XRP, bitfinex has a very large number of listings that are a significant subset of Binance. Kraken has a very large number of listings as just it seems unlikely that Binance gets singled out. In this example, though, we can't predict precisely what the regulators will do.
00:23:12.012 - 00:23:22.682, Speaker B: And then also when you were saying it looks like they made a good faith effort, how are you defining good faith? Is it because they have like, a vetting process or what constitutes good faith?
00:23:22.826 - 00:23:51.522, Speaker D: Yes, they have a structured vetting process. There's multiple people within the organization that seem to need to sign off before anything is listed. They are requiring, from what we understand, a legal opinion saying that a token is not a security before it is listed. So between those various aspects, I think that's what in our opinion constitutes a good faith effort.
00:23:51.666 - 00:24:08.426, Speaker A: They've also been proactive in delisting assets when there's been some teams that the teams maybe were trying in good faith to build whatever they said they were going to build, ultimately gave up or failed for whatever reason, and the team's basically kind of shut down shop. Binance has then been proactive in delisting those assets as well.
00:24:08.608 - 00:24:19.630, Speaker B: And then I noticed in your report you also had this section about money transmission laws. How well does Binance follow those laws and what risks is it taking in regards to money transmission laws?
00:24:20.130 - 00:25:04.990, Speaker D: So we are not necessarily experts on the specifics of global money transmission regulation. From what we have understood, a lot of those laws really apply to the fiat side of the world. And now that they have finally launched some fiat support, I'm sure they're working with those regulators in those jurisdictions to be compliant with all applicable regulation. We're not lawyers, we're not anyone's attorneys. So we can't say that they have an absolutely clean bill of health. But from what we've seen, I think that everything is in compliance.
00:25:05.570 - 00:25:14.474, Speaker B: Okay, great. So we're going to discuss Binance's plans to decentralize and the BNB token after the break. But first, a quick word from our fabulous sponsors.

00:25:52.810 - 00:26:07.170, Speaker B: Back to my conversation with Kyle and Tushar of Multicoin capital. So, yeah, so now let's start talking about Binance's plans to decentralize. You described Binance chain briefly before, but why don't you go more into detail on that?
00:26:07.320 - 00:26:56.654, Speaker A: Yeah, so Binance has kind of recognized that they want to fulfill the crypto vision in the long run of decentralizing kind of core financial infrastructure and technology infrastructure for the world at large. And it's not beyond them that they are running currently a centralized exchange business, which obviously is not. So Binance has started to make a pretty proactive effort to build a blockchain that will really support high throughput trading of assets. And that chain is going to be called Binance. Dex binance it seems like, started working on this really in earnest probably six months ago or so, maybe a little longer. Six to nine months ago. They rolled out a testnet pretty recently and I think the Binance chain is going to be going live in production at some point in March.
00:26:56.654 - 00:27:28.714, Speaker A: So we're pretty excited to see that come out. The really cool thing about binance chain is it will allow for truly decentralized peer to peer exchange, binance Inc. Or Binance. The company will not be in any way able to censor trades, hold user funds, manipulate their accounts, users will be in control of their own keys. And so it's a pretty radical approach in that direction. The other major breakthrough here is in understanding the capital flows of the system. Today in centralized exchange, world, finance takes some fees on every trade that happens.
00:27:28.714 - 00:28:10.054, Speaker A: So if you trade, let's say, one bitcoin for ten Ether, then finance is going to take, I don't know, ten basis points or 20 basis points or whatever the fees are of that trade. In the finance chain exchange model, different people can run the validators. The chain is going to start off somewhat centralized with eleven validators, but the plan is to grow that number pretty quickly. And at some point anyone who owns BNB tokens is going to be able to stake their tokens towards being a validator. And then if you are a validator in the finance chain, then every time other people trade on the finance chain, the validators in the network will actually receive those fees. The fees will not go to binance Inc. They will go directly to validators or meaning directly to BNB holders.
00:28:10.054 - 00:28:26.650, Speaker A: And so this is a major, major shift in strategy and in how revenue is ultimately collected through the system. And that is really exciting for both the future of democratizing kind of this financial infrastructure and for the future of BNB token holders and investors.
00:28:26.810 - 00:28:40.706, Speaker B: And can you just contrast that setup with some of the other popular decentralized exchanges or exchange protocols that are out there, like zero x? I don't know if it's a very different model or similar.
00:28:40.888 - 00:29:09.670, Speaker A: Yeah, so Binance's model is pretty substantially different. So the zero x protocol lives on top of the Ethereum blockchain. The founders at zero x realized pretty early on that if you wanted to do a decentralized exchange on top of Ethereum, it would be pretty difficult to do what's called an on chain order book. So in a traditional order book, you have limit orders. People saying, I'm willing to sell one bitcoin for ten Ether. At that ratio of one to ten, some other person may say, I'll sell one bitcoin for nine Ether. Right? And so it's a different price or a different ratio.
00:29:09.670 - 00:29:46.370, Speaker A: So you need to be able to host that order book of all of these different limit orders. In Ethereum, the block times are about 15 seconds and the throughput of the system is not super high. And so putting limit orders on the blockchain directly is simply unfeasible. The zero X team realized that basically from inception and so they started building a system where people could basically match those orders off chain and then just do the settlement on chain. So just the actual part where you trade the bitcoin for the ether but not the part of price discovery and hosting limit orders. And so that's what the zero X contract does. That was a big step forward for decentralized exchanges on top of Ethereum.
00:29:46.370 - 00:30:45.366, Speaker A: But unfortunately, what we've kind of seen in practice is that there's still a few practical problems that have really prevented market makers and liquidity providers from providing liquidity on top of the zerox protocol. The first is that if you want to cancel an order, you need to pay gas fees in the Xerox model and that becomes very expensive. For those of you who don't know kind of how market makers behave, market makers are placing orders and canceling orders a ton. It's actually very common that market makers may cancel 70, 80 or even 90% of the total orders they place on the order book because as prices move around, they will cancel old orders that have not been filled. And so given that, it becomes prohibitively expensive for market makers to maintain liquidity on zero X based relayers. The other big problem with the zero X model is lack of deterministic order execution. And what we mean by that is because the block times are every 15 seconds and because miners in Ethereum control ultimately which transactions are included in the block.
00:30:45.366 - 00:31:27.800, Speaker A: Even if a market maker thinks he or she has matched an order with another trader, you don't actually know that that order has been filled and actually settled on chain until you see it in a block. The next block could be in 2 seconds, it could be in 10 seconds, it could be in 35 seconds. You don't actually know when that's going to be filled or if the miner is going to replace your signature with someone else's and fill it themselves. And so that creates a lot of uncertainty for market makers on how trades actually get executed and filled. And so as a result of these problems, we just haven't seen liquidity on zero X based relayers on top of ethereum really take off in a meaningful way. I think last time I looked, volumes were like under $2 million a day or maybe million dollars a day. It's pretty low.
00:31:27.800 - 00:32:12.946, Speaker A: So binance, chain binance. Obviously these guys know how to run a centralized exchange and so they've designed the exchange from the ground up to solve both of these. Problems in a meaningful way. Canceling orders will be free and then trade block times are 1 second and the validators in the system rotate in a deterministic way. Finance chain cannot offer perfectly deterministic order execution in the way that a centralized exchange can, but it can do it in a way that's ten or 100 times faster than kind of what's the status quo on top of ethereum. And so the expectation is that with those problems solved, the finance chain will be able to offer an on chain order book with no cost of canceling orders with nearly perfect deterministic execution.
00:32:13.138 - 00:32:41.070, Speaker B: Wow. And I didn't mean to only pick on zero x, but just in general, as you were describing, a lot of these DEXes have pretty much almost no liquidity and no adoption. So is it just pretty much the speed and the fact that this chain is built for this? Are those kind of the main reasons that you think this will be different? What are the scenarios in which also it could end up with very little liquidity and adoption?
00:32:41.410 - 00:33:18.518, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, it's possible if people don't want to trade on it, then it's totally possible that it ends up with no liquidity. One of the ways Binance is trying to mitigate that risk mean Binance here is very much trying to cannibalize their own business. That is the kind of explicit goal here. And one of the ways they are encouraging people, both makers and takers, to move over to Binance chain is by actually offering lower fees on the decentralized exchange than the centralized one. So there's actually a fundamental economic motivation to move over coupled with general trade execution, it's our expectation that Binance will solve the cold start problem that has really plagued most decentralized exchanges historically.
00:33:18.694 - 00:34:09.130, Speaker D: In addition to that, they are also supporting hardware wallets from day one. So they've announced that ledger will be supporting the finance chain and the decentralized exchange from the day that binance chain is launched. They have also already seen implementations of binance chain through Trustwallet, which is their web3 wallet that they acquired recently. And so I think that they will have much better tooling already available in order to attract volume to their decentralized exchange. And while we don't have any details, I do expect that there will be some mechanism to bridge liquidity between their dominant centralized exchange and the new decentralized exchange.
00:34:09.630 - 00:34:25.314, Speaker B: Oh, well, that's interesting you say that because in the report it seemed that you guys were pretty certain that they would draw on the liquidity in the centralized exchange to overcome that problem in the decks. But you're not actually 100% certain about that.
00:34:25.512 - 00:34:41.506, Speaker D: They just haven't released any mechanisms or details regarding that. However, from everything that we can tell from their business strategy, it seems pretty clear that there will be some mechanisms, but until we see the mechanisms themselves, we can't comment on the effectiveness.
00:34:41.698 - 00:34:59.810, Speaker B: Okay. And I did see you guys kind of got into some of the details around the fact that it's utilizing Tendermint. Can you talk a little bit about how that affects the performance, I guess, of binance chain or why that's significant?
00:34:59.990 - 00:35:41.894, Speaker A: Yeah. So tendermint is really today the gold standard in proof of stake consensus algorithms. The Tendermint protocol was invented by Jay Kwan and Ethan Buckman from the Cosmos team, and they started working on this, I think, in 2014. They've been working on this for quite some time. Tendermint is we spent a lot of our time working with early stage entrepreneurs, building all kinds of different proof of stake consensus algorithms. And the general recognition among everyone is that tendermint is really just the gold standard in the construction of them. It's the simplest, it's the most straightforward, it makes the kind of the least assumptions in terms of kind of protocol operation, and it offers very high performance.
00:35:41.894 - 00:36:03.246, Speaker A: So Binance, I think, very smartly chose to fork kind of the core Cosmos SDK and the core Cosmos system, which means they are kind of receiving Tendermint and all of its benefits as part of what they're building. The net effect of that is the system will be fast and it will offer nearly perfect deterministic order execution, which is what traders need.
00:36:03.348 - 00:36:33.734, Speaker D: Yes, some of the details are I think there will be 1 second block times with 1 second finality. And so you don't have the problem of, when will my trade be settled? When can I know if the trade actually happened? You know, that it's 1 second/second or one block per second. And that's something that proof of stake systems allow, which proof of work systems simply do not. And I think that's an enormous advantage for binance chain.
00:36:33.862 - 00:36:43.230, Speaker B: And then one other thing is that apparently binance chain will only support the assets that Cosmos supports. So how will bitcoin be traded on binance chain?
00:36:43.570 - 00:37:10.182, Speaker D: That's a great question. While Cosmos and their Internet of blockchain system is unlikely to be able to integrate with Bitcoin, in the early days, binance seems to have adopted the gateway model in order to support trading of assets that are not immediately supported by Cosmos or issued on binance chain itself.
00:37:10.316 - 00:37:12.966, Speaker B: And what does that mean, the gateway model?
00:37:13.148 - 00:38:30.510, Speaker D: So the gateway model is one where it's similar to wrapped bitcoin. If you're familiar with WBTC, which is Bitcoin that has been deposited with BitGo along with, I think, a certain number of other members in that consortium. And they then issue an asset called WBTC, which is an ERC 20 token, which basically puts bitcoin on the ethereum blockchain. And the gateway model does introduce some counterparty risk in that the gateway that you're depositing the actual assets into and receiving the token that represents those assets from, you have to trust that gateway. However, those are fairly easily audited. I believe that for the WBTC product, you can go and verify those bitcoin on chain match the number of WBTC that has been issued and that information is available to everyone to see all of the time. And so the gateway model is a good short term step until inter blockchain communication grows more mature and potentially integrates with other blockchains like bitcoin.
00:38:32.930 - 00:38:47.262, Speaker B: Since Binance Chain is going to be decentralized, how will they decide which assets to list? Right now, finance itself has this vetting process, but how is it going to be decided for finance Chain?
00:38:47.406 - 00:39:32.766, Speaker A: Yeah, so we don't have, I think, 100% of the details, but we have a general structure is known and it's going to be basically kind of a community voting model. If you want to propose a new token be listed on Finance chain, kind of the issuer will need to buy and I believe burn or I think burn or spend BNB tokens. It's going to be a pretty large number. I think they've said it's going to be, I think on the order of $100,000 or more. The intention is to scare away all of the lower quality projects and then there's going to be some frequency of voting where BNB holders can vote and say either yes, we want to trade this asset, or no we don't. All the details of the timing of those cycles, how many is there a new vote every week? Those kinds of things are still unclear, but the general structure is known.
00:39:32.958 - 00:39:48.398, Speaker B: Yeah. So let's talk a little bit more about BNB token. Let's talk about how it's structured. Now, you've defined it as a discount token. Why don't you explain what that is and just explain generally how it's used in the current binance universe.
00:39:48.594 - 00:40:51.866, Speaker D: Absolutely. So the binance token is an interesting hybrid of many different use cases. The first use case is really that of a discount token in that if you pay your trading fees on binance, the centralized exchange or the binance chain decks in BNB tokens, you get a discounted rate. And this incentivizes traders to hold BNB tokens in their accounts and use them to pay for their trading fees in order to pay what is a substantially discounted rate. In addition to being a discount token in that regard, it is also a staking token and in multiple ways. First, users who hold a significant amount of BNB get discounted fees on the centralized exchange. So just by holding some BNB, you also get an additional fee discount.
00:40:51.866 - 00:42:01.822, Speaker D: Also, if you hold a significant amount of BNB, I believe it's 500 BNB at the moment, your referral fees from actually sending out your referral code to invite new users to the finance exchange are doubled. And so that provides an additional incentive. And last, but certainly not least, and actually, in our opinion, one of the most important pure utility aspects of the binance chain or the BNB token is staking BNB tokens as a validator on binance chain in being able to earn a percentage of all fees that are paid on the Binance chain. And I think that's extraordinarily valuable. Those are all of the on chain kind of properties that are inherent to the Finance token. But in addition to all of those, the Binance company has also committed to using 20% of their profits to buy and burn BNB tokens until they have burned 100 million tokens. In total, there were 200 million tokens created.
00:42:01.822 - 00:43:14.602, Speaker D: No more can ever be created. And so this buy and burn would remove at least half of all BNB tokens ever created from the supply. Now, on that topic, I do want to go a little bit deeper and talk about some concerns or open questions about this buy and burn model. There have been some open questions about is Binance actually buying those tokens that they're burning from the open market, or are they just using some of the BNB that they're being paid as fees as part of the exchange, accumulating those and then burning those later? The answer to that is it's not clear which of the two that they're doing, but it doesn't really matter at all because at the end of the day, the number of BNB outstanding is decreasing. And this means that each and every BNB that you do hold has greater utility in all of the aspects that I mentioned earlier. So let's say there's 175,000,000 BNB outstanding today, and you own 175,000 BNB. You have 0.1%
00:43:14.602 - 00:43:56.774, Speaker D: of all the BNB in existence. Once Finance Inc. Is done burning the remainder of the BNB that they have committed to burning, then you will own a substantially greater percentage of the total outstanding BNB. And so if you stake those in Binance chain, you will earn a larger reward or a larger percentage of the fees without having to go and buy any more tokens. So this is kind of similar to how stock buybacks will increase earnings per share in the equities world. This isn't in equity, and there are some differences there, but I think some of those heuristics can be borrowed in order to understand the mechanics behind the buy and burn here.
00:43:56.972 - 00:45:10.538, Speaker B: Yeah. One of the most fascinating parts about this whole description is that it's one of the coins, I feel, where you can look at it and just from your description, they've got kind of the utility aspect. Right, where because it has utility, there's going to be high velocity, there's going to be a lot of turnover. People are going to be using the token, and it really only has that use. But then on the flip side, in terms of the value of the token, as we know, the higher your velocity, the lower the value. And so then there's that staking element or this other stuff that you mentioned about how your referral fees get higher the more you hold, where that kind of like reduces the velocity and so helps prop up the value. And then the burning, obviously, they can't do the exact bitcoin model, obviously, since they did do an ICO, but it's sort of a similar concept where kind of like getting real estate now when there's a lot of them out there, kind of helps you later on as the supply decreases.
00:45:10.538 - 00:46:19.970, Speaker B: So it's just really fascinating. It just seems like they've really thought pretty carefully about how to preserve the value of the token, but also obviously make sure that it's useful for something. However, so going back to what I mentioned earlier, and obviously I'm not a lawyer either, as you've been saying, but just from my understanding of the Howie test, I do think BNB, at least right now, let's disregard the part about Binance chain, that it does fit the definition of a security in the US. And that's because the definition is that it should be an investment contract in a common enterprise whose profits are dependent on an identifiable party, which in this case would be Binance. So do you really think we kind of discussed this issue about the company and whether or not they'll face certain regulatory risks, but what about for the token for its ICO? How big do you think the legal risk is for them, for what they've issued?
00:46:20.130 - 00:46:59.554, Speaker D: That's a great question. And so first I want to say that securities aren't necessarily a bad thing. We are not the right group to determine, is BNB a security or not? That's going to be up to the regulators and the courts to decide. But being a security isn't just an unequivocally negative thing. There are certain restrictions that come with it. But otherwise I own plenty of securities personally. Apple shares are a security, so it's not just like some negative thing to be.
00:46:59.554 - 00:47:43.870, Speaker D: Now let's look at what happens if the courts do determine that BNB is a security. Well, there's a couple of things that are possible. The first is that they ask any venue that is trading this unregistered security to delist it. Given that the vast, vast majority of BNB trading volume occurs on Binance itself, this seems to be a low risk to us just because Binance is not entirely within the US. Jurisdiction. And so it seems unlikely that liquidity would just vanish if that statement was made by the US. Regulators.
00:47:43.870 - 00:48:45.970, Speaker D: Or the other thing that we've seen with unauthorized securities offerings is you have to give investors in the ICO a put right, where you have to give them the ability to get their money back at the price that they paid. However, I would be absolutely shocked if any of the original BNB ICO investors decided to exercise that right if it was provided to them, given that it would be entirely economically just irrational to do so. Binance Coin has delivered extremely attractive returns since the ICO. And so even if it is determined a security, I do not think that any rational investor would actually try to exercise that put right and get their money back for lack of a better term. So while there is some risk there, it's just something that we as investors are willing to take on. We are compensated for taking risk, and if we didn't want to take any risk, we would just be investing in us. Treasuries.
00:48:48.890 - 00:49:09.546, Speaker B: So one other thing I wanted to talk about was in your report you made a pretty bold claim that binance will become the first company to start out centralized, achieve scale, and then decentralize itself and migrate value capture from binance to the BNB token. How can you feel so confident of that now when it's pretty I mean.
00:49:09.648 - 00:49:47.398, Speaker A: I think throughout the report we highlight some quotes from CZ he's made over the last year that pretty strongly insinuate that that is the game plan. And then it's also just very clear, if you look at just generally how finance is evolving as an organization, that is the game plan. The company is already quite decentralized in a lot of ways. The 400 people work across 40 countries. They are a very global company in nature. Yeah, the current centralized exchange does that is centralized kind of architecturally. But they're launching BNB and they're launching the Binance chain to disrupt themselves.
00:49:47.398 - 00:50:06.090, Speaker A: And the ultimate manifestation of disrupting themselves with Binance chain is that they decentralize themselves. That's very clear. That's the kind of long term vision. It's actually unclear if that will happen. But if there is a company that is going to start on centralized scale and then decentralize itself, it's hard to imagine it being anyone other than binance.
00:50:06.250 - 00:50:08.510, Speaker B: And at what timescale do you imagine that happening?
00:50:08.580 - 00:50:20.386, Speaker A: Over it's hard to say at this point. This is definitely going to be slow. I can't imagine it would be a what does fully decentralized mean? That's somewhat ambiguous, but I'd expect at least five years.
00:50:20.568 - 00:50:38.714, Speaker B: And you also said that you imagine binance will become the first decentralized autonomous corporation. How do you define that? And is it literally just that they'll disrupt the actual existing company and what will be left? Is the Binance chain and BNB token or how will that happen?
00:50:38.912 - 00:51:14.740, Speaker D: Yep. So I want to start with a quote from CZ. This is from the most recent quote unquote earnings announcement and token burn. And so in that CZ says, from an earnings standpoint, binance dex will not directly increase profitability for Binance, but it will certainly increase the utility of BNB in a big way. That should be good for BNB holders. Binance is also a large holder of BNB, so we benefit the same way as all BNB holders. The more people using binance chain, the more value is created or the more successful we all become.
00:51:14.740 - 00:52:25.530, Speaker D: And from that and other quotes similar to that, what we see is that I think CZ really understands that the vision for blockchain technology is to remove rent seeking middlemen and allow users of a network to actually own that network. And the same is true of an exchange. An exchange is just a network. It's another type of network. It's not a network in the same way that a communications network is necessarily, but it's a network and it benefits from the same types of network effects. And so what we see as the actual way that this happens is that more and more of the trading volume, and almost eventually all of the trading volume moves to the decentralized exchange, as a decentralized exchange has lower fees and also allows the users of the decentralized exchange to own some percentage of the exchange themselves. And then Binance is basically become a decentralized, autonomous corporation.
00:52:25.530 - 00:53:00.290, Speaker D: Combine the earning of the fees being paid out to BNB holders as part of Binance chain with the fact that BNB holders will be voting on what tokens are listed on the chain. And I'm sure there will be some other details revealed about governance, of upgrading the system, et cetera. So in that case, it turns BNB into basically the ownership token of the Binance chain. And the Binance chain is that quote unquote, decentralized autonomous corporation.
00:53:00.450 - 00:53:03.510, Speaker B: And in that vision, does Binance itself still exist?
00:53:03.930 - 00:53:27.710, Speaker D: I believe that the fiat to crypto portions of Binance cannot actually be decentralized. I mean, those require an actual bank account, and that's going to be impossible to decentralize unless we see some massive changes in regulatory structure. So there will still be some centralized components to Binance that continue to exist.
00:53:28.290 - 00:53:53.158, Speaker B: And one thing is, when you were describing this vision, I've heard you guys also talk about sort of like, well, basically Binance employees and how they've bought into this vision or just kind of seen part of this movement. So how would you describe kind of like BNB employees, why they've decided to join the company and stuff like that?
00:53:53.324 - 00:54:53.930, Speaker D: Absolutely. I think one thing that's very clear from our interactions with both the leadership team at Binance as well as many of the everyday employees, is that this is a company that really has a missionary culture rather than a mercenary culture. We can tell that they truly care about this industry. They really want to do what's right for increasing adoption. And I think that came through in your interview, Laura, with CZ last year. It was, I think, pretty clear to anyone who listens to CZ speak that here is someone who really isn't just motivated by the money, is really motivated by the mission and what blockchain technology and crypto can accomplish for billions of people around the world. And so culture really does flow from the top there, and I think CZ is an excellent representation of that.
00:54:53.930 - 00:56:15.154, Speaker D: The parallel that I actually drew in the blog post that we published announcing the report was to Jeff Bezos, where it's very clear from looking at Jeff Bezos's actions and quotes over the past 20 plus years that he believes in putting the customer first in everything that Amazon does. They put the customer first. His most famous quote, at least in my opinion, is your margin is my opportunity, because it gives an opportunity to cut prices and benefit. So, you know, seeing that same ethos here with CZ is something that I, as an investor, find extremely attractive. And then in addition to all of those philosophical aspects, just from a pure financial perspective and a pure aligned incentives perspective, we do know that a very large percentage of Binance employees are taking a significant portion of their core salary, not bonuses, their core salary in BNB tokens. And we know that Binance inc is incentivized by holding a large amount of BNB tokens as well. And so while being in business with people who really believe in what they're doing and are doing it for the right reasons, is very important.
00:56:15.154 - 00:56:21.126, Speaker D: So is making sure that incentives are properly aligned. And I think both of those conditions are present here.
00:56:21.308 - 00:57:09.590, Speaker B: Yeah, I've also heard you guys say that a lot of the employees have taken pay cuts to work at Binance. So to not only take a pay cut, but then to be compensated in the company's own token, I definitely would say a lot of them have really bought in. So this has been super fascinating. And definitely you've painted like a very kind of bullish picture. And as I mentioned, I just had so much respect for ZZ after our interview because I really grilled him hard. And like I said, he just really kind of believes in what he's doing, and he didn't take it poorly at all. Like, I did a 100th episode where listeners in Pascuets could send in recordings, and he sent in a recording and he said it was his toughest interview.
00:57:09.590 - 00:57:34.750, Speaker B: But anyway, so with all this stuff that we've said here, obviously, I know you guys believe in Binance and what they're trying to do around decentralization, but what do you think are the biggest risks to their decentralization strategy? Like, if five years from now or whatever we say, okay, their plan to decentralize failed, what do you think will have been the factors that kept it from succeeding?
00:57:35.570 - 00:58:41.038, Speaker D: That's a great question. I think that there are really two categories of risks here. Category one of risks is risk to the existing business, and some of the main risks to the existing business. Many of these, which we noted in our report, are competitors accelerating token listings and being successful in attracting volume away from binance. We have seen that, for example, coinbase has gotten very aggressive in listing new tokens recently. However, we do think that this risk is mitigated or is quite low, because we can look at the actions from let's look at Coinbase in particular. They listed CVC, they listed Loom, they listed Mana, they listed GNT, and those tokens are really not or coinbase was not able to attract a significant portion of the volume away from Binance on those tokens.
00:58:41.038 - 00:59:33.166, Speaker D: And so we don't really see competitors coming in and listing these tokens as being that large of a risk. Another risk is that competitors start lowering pricing. Binance has the lowest fees in the industry, and they are able to sustain this through scale. This is why they are one of the largest exchanges in the industry. If one of these other exchanges is able to cut their fees to compete, they may be successful in attracting some volume. However, that might be difficult in this crypto winter, given that some of these exchanges are out there looking to raise capital or have recently raised capital and need to justify having revenue at certain amounts in order to really meet investor expectations. So it becomes really hard to cut fees in that scenario.
00:59:33.358 - 00:59:37.138, Speaker B: Are there any other factors that you think will have kept it from succeeding?
00:59:37.314 - 00:59:55.030, Speaker D: Yep. So now let's get to the second category of risks, and these are risks around execution of these future projects, namely Binance Chain. I mean, Binance Chain is not live yet. We have seen a testnet. We played with the testnet. The testnet is pretty cool. It seems to work, but it's not in production.
00:59:55.030 - 01:00:37.880, Speaker D: And until it's in production, we cannot know for sure how it will work. There could be failures with tendermint. We don't have a tendermint chain in production that we can point to operating for the past X years with perfect security and finality. So there could be some failure there as well. And so there is meaningful technical risk here. And if that technical risk plays out, we could see that Binance Chain fails for purely technological reasons. I think that's probably the most material risk facing BNB today.
01:00:38.570 - 01:00:49.846, Speaker B: Okay, great. Well, thanks so much for joining the show. To talk about BNB and Binance and Binance Chain, where can people learn more about both of you and Multicoin Capital?
