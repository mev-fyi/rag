We will unpack what that means in a moment.
00:00:57.274 - 00:01:05.002, Speaker A: Here to discuss are Ryan Watkins and Wilson Withiam both senior research analysts at Masari. Welcome ryan and Wilson.
00:01:05.146 - 00:01:06.946, Speaker B: Hey, Lauren, thanks for having us on.
00:01:07.048 - 00:01:08.178, Speaker C: Hi, Laura. Yeah.
00:01:08.264 - 00:01:11.762, Speaker D: Excited to talk about this topic. Yeah, so thanks for having us on.
00:01:11.896 - 00:01:16.374, Speaker A: Let's just start with a real basic question. What is ethereum 2.0?
00:01:16.572 - 00:01:46.670, Speaker E: Yeah, so I think Ethereum 2.0 is a couple of things. Most importantly for Ethereum, it's kind of its most ambitious upgrade that's been seven years in the making that will scale Ethereum so that it can actually serve as a globally scalable financial infrastructure. And then, two, it would also make it more secure. And then, as well, it will also transform ETH as an asset. Those kind of like the big picture ideas of what Ethereum 2.0 brings to Ethereum.
00:01:47.650 - 00:01:51.710, Speaker A: And what problems does Ethereum hope to resolve with this upgrade?
00:01:52.050 - 00:02:38.730, Speaker E: Yeah, so as far as Ethereum the blockchain, it's really a couple of things. And I'll divide this into proof of stake and then sharding, which are kind of the two major components of Ethereum 2.0. And with proof of stake, it's trying to solve three things. One is making Ethereum more secure. Two is ridding it of centralization risk from miners. And then three is making sure that participation in the consensus process is as accessible to users as possible. So that's for proof of stake and then for sharding, that's the scaling solution for Ethereum.
00:02:38.810 - 00:02:41.774, Speaker B: And basically what that entails is like.
00:02:41.812 - 00:02:50.194, Speaker E: Splitting up the Ethereum blockchain into subsets called shards and running them in parallel. And the reason why you do this.
00:02:50.232 - 00:02:52.802, Speaker B: Is because you want to keep the.
00:02:52.856 - 00:02:54.786, Speaker E: Requirements to run a node as low.
00:02:54.808 - 00:02:58.470, Speaker B: As possible so that there's not an.
00:02:58.540 - 00:03:04.760, Speaker E: Excessive burden on people who run these nodes. And it is actually accessible to people.
00:03:05.370 - 00:03:08.390, Speaker B: With basically just like consumer hardware.
00:03:09.130 - 00:03:16.570, Speaker E: And the reason why you do that is because it ensures that you can get the scalability while maintaining that core property of being decentralized.
00:03:17.230 - 00:03:21.826, Speaker D: And I think I'll add to that as what we've seen since Ethereum launched.
00:03:21.878 - 00:03:24.206, Speaker C: Is that it's run into a couple.
00:03:24.228 - 00:03:29.178, Speaker D: Of issues along the line. Specifically during 2017, during the ICO Craze.
00:03:29.194 - 00:03:38.722, Speaker C: And then most recently this past summer when various DFI liquidity mining programs were up and running, that under its current.
00:03:38.776 - 00:03:42.446, Speaker D: Architecture, it can get under a significant.
00:03:42.478 - 00:03:44.738, Speaker C: Amount of load and that tends to.
00:03:44.824 - 00:03:58.214, Speaker D: Delay transactions and also increase the transaction cost. So it was recognized, Ethereum 2.0 was Ethereum developers and researchers recognizing that under Ethereum's current architecture that it couldn't scale.
00:03:58.262 - 00:04:02.970, Speaker C: To meet these characteristics, that they were.
00:04:03.040 - 00:04:04.700, Speaker D: Truly desiring out of the platform.
00:04:05.710 - 00:04:18.560, Speaker A: So we're going to dive into each of these in greater depth throughout the episode. But let's do first a quick overview of the different phases of Ethereum 2.0. Can you name them and describe what happens in each?
00:04:19.410 - 00:04:25.154, Speaker C: Of course, yeah, happy to. So the first phase is the one.
00:04:25.192 - 00:04:37.974, Speaker D: That is eminent, the one where users can actually start staking is called Phase Zero. And that simply is the launch of something called Beacon Chain. And the Beacon Chain is basically your.
00:04:38.012 - 00:04:40.802, Speaker C: Central core layer of this new network.
00:04:40.866 - 00:04:47.042, Speaker D: So it's separate from the existing network and it will be this coordination layer.
00:04:47.186 - 00:04:49.662, Speaker C: That allows people to stake.
00:04:49.826 - 00:04:52.026, Speaker D: It coordinates all the different validators or.
00:04:52.048 - 00:04:54.714, Speaker C: Stakers on the platform and then it.
00:04:54.752 - 00:04:59.962, Speaker D: Acts as the coordination layer for all the additional upgrades that will be added later on.
00:05:00.016 - 00:05:02.846, Speaker C: So all of the additional shards, it.
00:05:02.868 - 00:05:10.446, Speaker D: Will serve as a reference point to all of those. So it can actually connect information between all those other chains that eventually get.
00:05:10.468 - 00:05:23.074, Speaker C: Added later on the second phase. Phase One a little bit of a longer timeline. So I think some of the early estimates are maybe late 2021 that will.
00:05:23.112 - 00:05:28.054, Speaker D: Add the scalability component. So Phase Zero nothing much more than.
00:05:28.092 - 00:05:30.738, Speaker C: Staking and reaching consensus.
00:05:30.914 - 00:05:35.174, Speaker D: The Phase One will be adding all these different shard layers and that will.
00:05:35.212 - 00:05:39.980, Speaker C: Be the base scalability component for Ethereum 2.0.
00:05:41.230 - 00:05:43.226, Speaker D: Really, phase One is just kind of.
00:05:43.248 - 00:05:46.554, Speaker C: Reaching consensus with a whole lot of different things.
00:05:46.592 - 00:05:51.738, Speaker D: So you're reaching consensus not only on the Beacon Chain, but also incorporating all those other shard chains.
00:05:51.754 - 00:05:54.826, Speaker C: So how do you reference the block.
00:05:54.858 - 00:06:07.150, Speaker D: Data that gets added to the entire network across 65 different chains? The third phase is called Phase 1.5 and that is actually be the merge.
00:06:07.230 - 00:06:11.634, Speaker C: Of the existing network with the new network, Ethereum 2.0.
00:06:11.752 - 00:06:16.218, Speaker D: And really it's just a simple swap of the proof of work consensus layer.
00:06:16.254 - 00:06:19.094, Speaker C: That Ethereum uses right now over to.
00:06:19.132 - 00:06:23.382, Speaker D: The proof of stake layer that's on Ethereum 2.0. So how it's going to look like.
00:06:23.436 - 00:06:27.510, Speaker C: To most users and applications?
00:06:28.250 - 00:06:29.910, Speaker D: It's not going to change a whole lot.
00:06:29.980 - 00:06:32.662, Speaker C: It's supposed to be pretty seamless, but.
00:06:32.716 - 00:06:55.710, Speaker D: A lot of it is just going to be the underlying layer where it just kind of switches over and all the blocks are being created through proof of stake instead of by miners. And then the final phase, the big one, is Phase Two. And that will be when you're adding execution to these different shards. So during the first three phases they actually will not have smart contract execution.
00:06:55.790 - 00:06:59.134, Speaker C: Ability, they won't have smart contract execution ability.
00:06:59.182 - 00:07:08.226, Speaker D: So you won't be able to actually port smart contracts onto these individual shards. But there is a bit of a caveat to this whole process and it's.
00:07:08.258 - 00:07:11.062, Speaker C: That you might be able to start.
00:07:11.116 - 00:07:12.930, Speaker D: Using some of these shards for scalability.
00:07:13.010 - 00:07:15.160, Speaker C: Means before phase two.
00:07:15.530 - 00:07:20.618, Speaker D: And so there is a possibility that you can get the scalability gains without.
00:07:20.704 - 00:07:23.814, Speaker C: Having to add smart contract execution ability.
00:07:23.862 - 00:07:25.286, Speaker D: To every single one of these shards.
00:07:25.318 - 00:07:28.918, Speaker C: So there is a route as we're.
00:07:28.934 - 00:07:39.422, Speaker D: Going down this roadmap for E 2.0, where Phase 2 may not necessary, may not be necessary. So even though it might be further out on the timeline, you can start.
00:07:39.476 - 00:07:43.920, Speaker C: Seeing the advancements that E 2.0 are bringing far sooner than that.
00:07:44.690 - 00:08:39.940, Speaker A: We're going to spend most of the show talking about Phase Zero, which is the most imminent change as you mentioned. And listeners should know that we're recording this on Monday, November 23 because there's kind of things going on right now. So by the time this comes out, we don't really know where things will have landed. However, at this moment we're about 75% of the way to meeting the minimum threshold and that would trigger off like a seven day period before the network could launch. And although also the earliest day it could launch would be on December 1. So it's kind of like tomorrow, november 24 really is the first day when people would have the opportunity to stake that minimum amount. So can you just maybe go through the technical details of what is required to make this launch happen?
00:08:40.790 - 00:08:45.006, Speaker C: There's really two components to when this.
00:08:45.048 - 00:08:50.246, Speaker D: Chain can launch and really there's like you mentioned, a minimum deposit amount and.
00:08:50.268 - 00:08:52.280, Speaker C: A minimum genesis date.
00:08:53.210 - 00:08:58.070, Speaker D: And so really all you really need to meet is that minimum deposit amount.
00:08:58.140 - 00:09:03.354, Speaker C: Which is 524,288 E. And as soon.
00:09:03.392 - 00:09:09.290, Speaker D: As validators deposit that into this contract which lives on the current Ethereum network.
00:09:10.270 - 00:09:13.290, Speaker C: It will go into the deposit contract.
00:09:13.450 - 00:09:18.494, Speaker D: People can start running clients on this new Ethereum 2.0 network now and as.
00:09:18.532 - 00:09:24.050, Speaker C: A client they read the contract, they'll recognize it. If it's a valid deposit.
00:09:25.830 - 00:09:26.434, Speaker D: They'Ll tell.
00:09:26.472 - 00:09:35.990, Speaker C: The new beacon chain to mint 32 E for that validator so they can start staking on the network.
00:09:36.490 - 00:09:47.602, Speaker D: So really just kind of a constant contact between the two chains all generated through that single contract. The other component, the minimum genesis date.
00:09:47.676 - 00:09:52.700, Speaker C: Is right now listed as December 1. And.
00:09:54.750 - 00:09:56.106, Speaker D: All that means is that is.
00:09:56.128 - 00:09:57.930, Speaker C: The earliest date it can launch.
00:09:59.150 - 00:10:09.166, Speaker D: So it can launch anytime after that. It just needs to meet that minimum deposit amount. And for that deposit amount, like once.
00:10:09.188 - 00:10:11.406, Speaker C: That deposit amount is reached, there is.
00:10:11.428 - 00:10:13.226, Speaker D: A seven day delay between when it's.
00:10:13.258 - 00:10:14.574, Speaker C: Reached and when it's launched.
00:10:14.622 - 00:10:25.822, Speaker D: So yeah, like you mentioned, earliest amount, it could be November 24. That means that implies a December 1 launch date. You can reach that minimum amount anytime.
00:10:25.886 - 00:10:33.190, Speaker C: After that, and then seven days after it reaches that amount, then the chain will officially launch.
00:10:33.530 - 00:10:51.286, Speaker A: And so do you guys want to make a bet? We can all either look really stupid or really dumb by the time this comes out, because everybody will already know by the time this comes out. But we at this moment in time. Don't, do you think we're going to get the minimum threshold by tomorrow then November 24?
00:10:51.478 - 00:10:52.830, Speaker B: Yeah, I do.
00:10:52.980 - 00:10:53.840, Speaker C: I agree.
00:10:54.530 - 00:10:56.078, Speaker D: I would put money on it.
00:10:56.244 - 00:11:38.970, Speaker A: Yeah, I have a feeling as well, because just even in the time that I was researching for this show, the minimum amount is coming up very quickly. And so today, right when I went to write this or make that little change on what amount we're at right now, I was surprised to find we're at 75%. So we were joking before we started recording the show that we think the whales are all back channeling right now anyway. All right, so regardless of when the launch actually occurs, let's discuss one of the most fundamental changes that's happening, which is this switch to proof of stake from proof of work. Why is Ethereum moving away from proof of work to proof of stake?
00:11:39.390 - 00:11:40.766, Speaker B: So I touched on this a little.
00:11:40.788 - 00:12:05.566, Speaker E: Bit in the overall design of Ethereum 2.0, and it's really three things. It is for security, it is for energy efficiency, and then it's to reduce the risk of centralization for miners and it can dive into all three. So on the security front, basically the idea here can be bited into two different categories.
00:12:05.758 - 00:12:08.366, Speaker B: One is that you want to make.
00:12:08.408 - 00:12:11.590, Speaker E: The cost to attack the blockchain very high.
00:12:11.740 - 00:12:13.190, Speaker B: And then the other one is that.
00:12:13.260 - 00:12:43.378, Speaker E: In the extreme case where you do get attacked, like a 51% attack, it's easier to kind of coordinate a new chain that gets rid of the attacker. So the way this works in proof of stake versus proof of work is, well, actually, I'll even rewind to GPU based proof of work because that's what Ethereum currently operates on. Now, GPUs are ubiquitous. They're like, all over the world. They have ton of different use cases. And if you really wanted to, you.
00:12:43.384 - 00:12:46.226, Speaker B: Could rent out GPUs and use those.
00:12:46.248 - 00:12:59.314, Speaker E: GPUs to attack a proof of work blockchain. And we've seen that with some blockchains that exist that are susceptible to these attacks. Now, proof of work under with Asics.
00:12:59.362 - 00:13:02.914, Speaker B: Is a little bit different because Asics.
00:13:02.962 - 00:13:19.942, Speaker E: Are specifically designed to mine the cryptocurrency that they've been designed for. So with bitcoin, their Asics are designed to mine bitcoin. That's the only thing they can be used for. So it's not just about your ability to be able to rent out this.
00:13:20.016 - 00:13:23.390, Speaker B: Hash power from some cloud provider.
00:13:24.370 - 00:13:41.954, Speaker E: Proof of work first involves some high initial upfront investment to actually participate in this mining process. Now, the difference between proof of work and proof of stake is that with proof of stake there's two different things.
00:13:41.992 - 00:13:45.694, Speaker B: With the upfront investment, it's one, whereas.
00:13:45.742 - 00:14:15.946, Speaker E: With an ASIC, an ASIC typically depreciates over say about two years, and then you have to buy a new one to stay competitive. Your stake is just an internal accounting measure in ethereum and doesn't depreciate. And then two, your stake also is not like permanently locked. You can actually remove it after withdrawal period. So really when you go to stake, you only face an opportunity cost. And the reason why those two things are important not being a depreciating asset.
00:14:15.978 - 00:14:18.906, Speaker B: And then two, only facing opportunity costs.
00:14:18.938 - 00:14:22.014, Speaker E: Is that it makes the attractiveness of.
00:14:22.052 - 00:14:25.826, Speaker B: Putting up more capital at risk a.
00:14:25.848 - 00:14:27.774, Speaker E: Little bit more attractive.
00:14:27.902 - 00:14:29.426, Speaker B: And the reason why is because if.
00:14:29.448 - 00:14:38.662, Speaker E: You can just pull out your stake after withdrawal period, if your stake doesn't depreciate, then you're probably more willing to accept a low return for a given.
00:14:38.716 - 00:14:40.886, Speaker B: Amount of capital you put up.
00:14:41.068 - 00:14:50.906, Speaker E: So it raises the cost to attack. That's one aspect of the proof of stake component. The other one is like how it's harder to counter or it's easier to.
00:14:50.928 - 00:14:56.586, Speaker B: Counter coordinate against a 51% attack. Now the idea with that is that.
00:14:56.688 - 00:15:15.442, Speaker E: When you in granted, it's very difficult to 51% attack a proof of work blockchain like Bitcoin. At this point you're talking about billions of dollars investment and much more. But in the case that someone was able to 51% attack Bitcoin, there's basically a couple of things you could do.
00:15:15.496 - 00:15:18.050, Speaker B: You could basically create a fork and.
00:15:18.120 - 00:15:24.658, Speaker E: Switch the mining algorithm to something else so that the attacker can't continue to.
00:15:24.664 - 00:15:29.446, Speaker B: Use their asics to attack the chain. But the problem when you do that.
00:15:29.468 - 00:16:05.506, Speaker E: Is that, well now you have to bootstrap hash power for this new chain. And probably the way you're going to do that is by switching to an algorithm that can be mined using, say, GPUs, right? And then what was some of the things that I mentioned previously is that you can just rent hash power for GPUs on the internet and then maybe you can say like, okay, if this person keep attacking, well, we can just keep on forking. But it's just kind of this never ending cycle of keeping happening to fork and someone being able to attack it. Now, the difference with proof of stake is that in the event there's a 51% attack and granite. Like I said, it'd be extremely difficult.
00:16:05.608 - 00:16:08.514, Speaker B: Because where are you going to buy?
00:16:08.632 - 00:16:18.370, Speaker E: Let's say, like, right now, there's 10% ETH participating in proof of stake. And ETH is worth $60 billion market cap. That's $6 billion with the ETH you need to buy.
00:16:18.440 - 00:16:19.958, Speaker B: I mean, I don't know where you're.
00:16:19.964 - 00:16:25.286, Speaker E: Going to buy $6 billion with the ETH, but if you could do that thing is, if you're launching a 51%.
00:16:25.308 - 00:16:29.622, Speaker B: Attack on ETH ethereum can create a new fork.
00:16:29.686 - 00:16:34.090, Speaker E: And granted forking is definitely hard, but they can create a new fork and.
00:16:34.240 - 00:16:35.770, Speaker B: Just delete your stake.
00:16:36.670 - 00:16:41.674, Speaker E: Basically the equivalent that many ethereum researchers.
00:16:41.722 - 00:16:46.174, Speaker B: Have created analogy is that it's almost.
00:16:46.212 - 00:16:53.534, Speaker E: Like the equivalent of burning someone's ASIC farm when you can slash someone's stake for behaving maliciously.
00:16:53.662 - 00:16:54.946, Speaker B: And it's a way of kind of.
00:16:54.968 - 00:17:30.278, Speaker E: Permanently ending this person's ability to attack the proof of stakes blockchain. So that was Hong portion on security. The other two are much quicker on mining centralization and energy efficiency. Energy efficiency. The basic idea is Bitcoin uses a tremendous amount of energy to secure itself as much as a small country. And you can debate whether that's good or bad and it's doing something useful.
00:17:30.374 - 00:17:33.286, Speaker B: But end of the day, you're burning.
00:17:33.398 - 00:17:35.614, Speaker E: Enormous muscle electricity to make this thing work.
00:17:35.652 - 00:17:37.134, Speaker B: So if you could do it more.
00:17:37.172 - 00:17:39.246, Speaker E: Efficiently, it's probably a good thing.
00:17:39.428 - 00:17:40.794, Speaker B: And then the last one on reducing.
00:17:40.842 - 00:17:43.626, Speaker E: Mining centralization risk, that's reducing the risk.
00:17:43.658 - 00:17:47.262, Speaker B: From across a couple of different dimensions.
00:17:47.326 - 00:18:06.978, Speaker E: I mean, one is just geographical. So if you think about it's, not like some conspiracy theory against Bitcoin, but 65% of hash power is in China. So that's kind of like one risk you can get rid of with proof of stake. There's also the risk of manufacturer centralization.
00:18:07.074 - 00:18:09.546, Speaker B: So I want to say like about.
00:18:09.568 - 00:18:17.126, Speaker E: 90% of all asics are manufactured amongst four firms in Asia. So there's kind of that risk.
00:18:17.158 - 00:18:17.740, Speaker B: There.
00:18:18.190 - 00:18:22.906, Speaker E: Another thing with proof for work or asics is that there's economies of scale.
00:18:23.018 - 00:18:26.702, Speaker B: So the larger you become, the more.
00:18:26.836 - 00:18:37.774, Speaker E: Cheap it becomes for you to mine with Bitcoin because you can negotiate bulk orders for asics and it's just easier to scale it. Whereas with proof of stake, in theory.
00:18:37.822 - 00:18:40.594, Speaker B: Anyone who has 32 E can quite.
00:18:40.632 - 00:18:50.534, Speaker E: Easily participate in the consensus process using commodity hardware. So that's the basic idea with mining centralization risk is just kind of getting.
00:18:50.572 - 00:18:54.550, Speaker B: Rid of those risks, although maybe not.
00:18:54.620 - 00:18:58.790, Speaker E: That likely just getting rid of the fact that they exist.
00:18:59.450 - 00:19:34.660, Speaker A: Yeah. One thing I want to dive into a little bit is how staking works. Exactly. Because I just wonder is it going to be one of those situations where, yeah, okay, more everyday people can become validators, but then I don't know what it takes to be running a validating node and keeping the uptime such that you won't get penalized or slashed. So I just wonder, will a lot of these end up being on centralized services anyway where they're kind of paying somebody else to do that part for them?
00:19:35.190 - 00:19:41.190, Speaker E: Yeah. As far as how can you stake, there's probably three different ways.
00:19:41.340 - 00:19:43.926, Speaker B: One would be doing it through a.
00:19:43.948 - 00:19:48.934, Speaker E: Centralized provider, like an exchange or staking as a service provider who will just.
00:19:48.972 - 00:19:50.454, Speaker B: Do all the work for you.
00:19:50.652 - 00:20:01.294, Speaker E: And the benefit of that is not only convenience, but the fact that you can do it with less than 32 E. So if you hold one E, you can now participate in this. The second way is to do it yourself.
00:20:01.412 - 00:20:04.458, Speaker B: And if you're doing it yourself it's.
00:20:04.474 - 00:20:15.886, Speaker E: Actually not that difficult. You can do it on a pretty standard laptop. And the way that the incentive systems kind of rewards and penalties was designed.
00:20:15.918 - 00:20:18.770, Speaker B: Is that so it's very forgiving.
00:20:19.430 - 00:20:33.158, Speaker E: So even if your computer is down 20% of the year you'll likely still be able to be profitable. So that's what I mean, like it was designed to be forgiving so that.
00:20:33.244 - 00:20:35.878, Speaker B: Even if you're just not good and.
00:20:35.884 - 00:20:52.734, Speaker E: You don't have time you can still be profitable or at the very least not lose your money. And then kind of third would be these kind of like decentralized staking pools that are almost like two sided marketplaces where on one end you have people.
00:20:52.772 - 00:20:55.198, Speaker B: Who want to stake who submit their.
00:20:55.284 - 00:21:08.530, Speaker E: ETH to this contract and this contract then goes and allocates that stake to different validators in this ecosystem. And that's another way of participating in staking.
00:21:09.590 - 00:21:26.760, Speaker A: All right, and then we're going to talk a little bit about kind of the opportunity cost between staking and doing other things. But let's just make one thing clear. Once people move their Ethereum to Ethereum 2.0 in order to stake they're not able to use it anymore. Why is that?
00:21:29.630 - 00:21:36.954, Speaker D: At this point there are two different chains and so you don't want to have two different chains that represent the.
00:21:36.992 - 00:21:40.538, Speaker C: Same native asset, having assets that can.
00:21:40.544 - 00:21:43.134, Speaker D: Be tradable and running on each. Because then you start getting some price.
00:21:43.172 - 00:21:46.334, Speaker C: Deviation between the two and it can.
00:21:46.372 - 00:22:10.006, Speaker D: Complicate matters in case any issues do pop up as E 2.0 starts to evolve. So for instance, a bug runs out, maybe they need to find a way to resolve any differences between the staking amount and what's being read on Ethereum because they want to make sure the.
00:22:10.028 - 00:22:16.886, Speaker C: Current Ethereum network to make sure those are completely equal. Because you start running any sort of.
00:22:16.908 - 00:22:27.974, Speaker D: Differences between the two that's going to make it far more complicated when they do finally merge. Right now keeping them separate and making sure everything on Ethereum 2.0 isn't transactable.
00:22:28.102 - 00:22:32.558, Speaker C: Can prevent any sort of issues like that running down the road.
00:22:32.724 - 00:22:35.530, Speaker D: But once they do merge then essentially.
00:22:35.610 - 00:22:42.734, Speaker C: Ethereum 1.0 and 2.0 become the same network. It's essentially Ethereum at that point and.
00:22:42.772 - 00:22:44.618, Speaker D: All the accounts and balances will be.
00:22:44.644 - 00:22:47.186, Speaker C: Transferred onto Ethereum 2.0 and they can.
00:22:47.208 - 00:22:50.546, Speaker D: Be read the same as everything that's on the beacon chain which would allow.
00:22:50.648 - 00:22:55.074, Speaker C: Everyone to start removing the staked amount.
00:22:55.112 - 00:23:01.154, Speaker D: That they have as well as any rewards that they may have earned during that time. So it's more of like a safety.
00:23:01.202 - 00:23:04.360, Speaker C: Measure at this point which makes sense.
00:23:05.130 - 00:23:07.398, Speaker D: Because going forward you're only going to.
00:23:07.404 - 00:23:09.866, Speaker C: Be able to use it Ethereum 2.0.
00:23:09.968 - 00:23:15.638, Speaker D: To a limited extent. So really you're just looking forward to when that functionality starts to unlock.
00:23:15.734 - 00:23:17.820, Speaker C: That's when you'll be able to access everything.
00:23:18.910 - 00:23:51.830, Speaker A: So because obviously people realize that or the designers of Ethereum 2.0 realize that there's a lot of things people could be doing with their ETH and so they probably need to incentivize them in some way to move the ETH over to Ethereum 2.0 without losing too much opportunity. Cost so what are some of the examples out there of new services that have popped up that still enable people to use ETH on ETH one once they have started staking?
00:23:52.410 - 00:24:02.442, Speaker E: One of the biggest hesitancies many people have is that there's going to be this kind of like lockup period on your ETH. It will be unlocked by Phase 1.5.
00:24:02.496 - 00:24:04.442, Speaker B: But who knows really when that comes.
00:24:04.496 - 00:24:22.698, Speaker E: It could be twelve months from now, it could be 36 months from now. For all practical purposes it's indefinite. So in the meantime you need to be able to access some liquidity on your ETH. And there's basically like two major classes of solutions.
00:24:22.874 - 00:24:25.874, Speaker B: One would be kind of like what.
00:24:25.912 - 00:24:37.206, Speaker E: Liquid stake is doing. So basically what they allow you to do is if you stake through them they will allow you to borrow USDC on your ETH, just get a kind.
00:24:37.228 - 00:24:39.462, Speaker B: Of collateralized loan and it's kind of.
00:24:39.516 - 00:25:00.834, Speaker E: This larger class solution called staking derivatives. These classes solutions are kind of a little bit less developed at this time than I would say the former. But the basic idea is that you have either a centralized service provider, like an exchange, or you'll have a decentralized.
00:25:00.982 - 00:25:06.160, Speaker B: Protocol, say, like Rockpool or Sapphire, and.
00:25:06.930 - 00:25:13.266, Speaker E: You will be able to deposit your ETH with them to stake, and then in exchange, it'll give you kind of.
00:25:13.288 - 00:25:16.626, Speaker B: Like an ETH derivative, which was called.
00:25:16.648 - 00:25:28.194, Speaker E: Like, Deeth for now instead of death. The idea is that you can use this death on ethereum to access everything in ethereum.
00:25:28.242 - 00:25:31.318, Speaker B: So in theory you could send it.
00:25:31.324 - 00:25:42.666, Speaker E: To compound and borrow dai against it. You could mint dai against it in maker or whatever opportunities you want to do in ethereum. In theory you'll be able to do.
00:25:42.688 - 00:25:44.810, Speaker B: With this kind of derivative.
00:25:45.550 - 00:26:13.060, Speaker A: Well, one thing despite all these developments and allowing people to both stake and do other things with their ethereum, there is this concern that because there's a lot of financially appealing opportunities in DFI on ethereum that people won't be super interested in staking. How much of a threat or concern do you think the appeal of DFI is to staking on Ethereum 2.0?
00:26:14.310 - 00:26:43.918, Speaker E: I actually don't think it's a major concern. I think the biggest thing between staking and DeFi just boils down to how validator returns are designed. So if there was this event where say, yields in DeFi were very high and then some people who are staking and granted this is actually significantly more important in Phase 1.5 beyond when you.
00:26:43.924 - 00:26:48.218, Speaker B: Can actually withdraw your ETH and use it in DFI.
00:26:48.394 - 00:27:04.034, Speaker E: Although I will touch on phase zero kind of after this thought but if there was a case where ETH was being withdrawn from staking to go for use in DeFi well, the way that the returns for validators are designed is.
00:27:04.072 - 00:27:06.626, Speaker B: That if there's less people staking the.
00:27:06.648 - 00:27:10.454, Speaker E: Rewards will be higher. If there's more people staking the rewards will be lower.
00:27:10.572 - 00:27:16.406, Speaker B: So at a certain point the rewards would become more attractive again so that.
00:27:16.428 - 00:27:56.686, Speaker E: There'S kind of like a minimum amount on how much people would want to leave for D five or staking. And then kind of another related point is that staking in kind of DFI art is two different products. Staking is you're just getting kind of like a native yield on your ETH for providing Ethereum security. And basically the two main risks that you assume are one ethereum blockchain failing which is just systemic risk that you get from holding any asset on ethereum. And then two is like validator risk, the risk that your validator just doesn't.
00:27:56.718 - 00:28:00.246, Speaker B: Perform or you behave maliciously and even.
00:28:00.268 - 00:28:09.670, Speaker E: That can actually be diversified away if you were to go through kind of like a decentralized staking protocol that kind of diversifies your validator risk across multiple validators.
00:28:10.190 - 00:28:17.002, Speaker A: But can you just lay out what those penalties or what happens if you get slashed? Just so people know, high level idea.
00:28:17.056 - 00:28:35.474, Speaker E: Is that if you behave maliciously, let's say like you double sign blocks you can lose some of, if not all of your stake for doing so. And basically what that means is that that 32 E that you posted as.
00:28:35.592 - 00:28:38.638, Speaker B: Basically collateral to stake gets deleted.
00:28:38.814 - 00:28:48.840, Speaker A: Okay, yeah, that's a little bit harsh but I guess there have been plenty of people in DFI this summer who got totally wiped out by various things that happened.
00:28:50.730 - 00:28:51.880, Speaker E: 100%.
00:28:53.210 - 00:29:35.474, Speaker A: One other thing that I want to talk about is this incident that happened on the testnet where one particular client for Ethereum 2.0 had a design flaw and that caused participation on the network to go from 80% down to 5% because pretty much all those validators got wiped out. So how is client diversity, which is like a principle really that is important to Ethereum and weirdly, not at all to bitcoin or rather they just have completely different perspectives on it which is super interesting to watch. But client diversity is something that Ethereum really values and yet here we have certain clients that are really just becoming the most popular out of the gate. How is Ethereum working to mitigate the risks around that?
00:29:35.672 - 00:29:53.274, Speaker D: Have you brought that up? It's kind of very interesting to look at the two different philosophies. So right now you have Bitcoin where over 98% of clients run on bitcoin run bitcoin core. On the other side you have Ethereum where about 80% are running geth at the moment.
00:29:53.392 - 00:29:54.346, Speaker B: But there is a bit of a.
00:29:54.368 - 00:30:00.342, Speaker D: Diversity into that 20% of what clients are people running there. And so there's definitely a push to.
00:30:00.496 - 00:30:05.518, Speaker C: Move towards a more diverse client base.
00:30:05.684 - 00:30:07.562, Speaker D: So that you don't have one client.
00:30:07.626 - 00:30:11.946, Speaker C: That'S overreaching or having too much control over the network.
00:30:12.138 - 00:30:22.738, Speaker A: Yeah, but actually one thing I'd say is that they've been trying to do this since the time that they launched and it's always been that there's been one dominant one, which is also very interesting. But anyway, keep going.
00:30:22.904 - 00:30:40.966, Speaker D: I completely agree and I think they blame a lot of or I don't want to say blame, but I think a lot of the reason behind that was they didn't really have too many clients to start with when they first launched the chain. So you have this first mover advantage where geth becomes the popular client to use.
00:30:41.148 - 00:30:42.838, Speaker C: It gains a lot of traction, gains.
00:30:42.854 - 00:30:46.860, Speaker D: A lot of trust and all of a sudden it's kind of hard to eat into that market share.
00:30:47.550 - 00:30:51.246, Speaker C: So that's why for Ethereum 2.0, the.
00:30:51.268 - 00:31:06.786, Speaker D: Ethereum Foundation put a lot of money into via grants into building out a variety of clients. And I know they at one point were working on eight to ten different clients. And at the moment right now, you.
00:31:06.808 - 00:31:13.266, Speaker C: Have four viable ones going into the Beacon chain. Even with that said, there has been.
00:31:13.288 - 00:31:42.014, Speaker D: One client named Prism that has become the favorite amongst most validators. And like you said on the testnet, it had a bug and that issue reared its ugly head. That one bug caused the entire network not to go down, but to drop to a very low percentage of validators actually working on the client. So that means they couldn't finalize blocks. They could keep building and adding blocks to the network, but they couldn't finalize them. Which just means that at some point.
00:31:42.052 - 00:31:44.750, Speaker C: It'S possible that those could be reverted.
00:31:45.730 - 00:32:02.674, Speaker D: So how do you prevent that? So there's a pretty unique design within Ethereum that if more than 33%, if you can't finalize so you need 66% of validators actively working and voting on.
00:32:02.712 - 00:32:08.786, Speaker C: Blocks to finalize the chain. If you can't do that, then Ethereum.
00:32:08.818 - 00:32:23.926, Speaker D: Will automatically start penalizing validators that are not online. And so it's called an inactivity leak. And if you're inactive, it'll start gradually and then actually exponentially reducing your staked.
00:32:23.958 - 00:32:25.626, Speaker C: Amount either to get you to a.
00:32:25.648 - 00:32:32.186, Speaker D: Point where you're dropped off the network or to actually incentivize people to come back and join the network and do.
00:32:32.208 - 00:32:33.646, Speaker C: What they're supposed to do.
00:32:33.828 - 00:32:46.590, Speaker D: And so eventually it gets back to that 66% minimum. What that means in the terms of client diversity is if you are running a majority client and say that is somewhere between 40 60% of the network.
00:32:46.670 - 00:32:48.610, Speaker C: And it has a bug, you are.
00:32:48.680 - 00:32:50.890, Speaker D: Automatically under risk if all of a.
00:32:50.900 - 00:32:56.414, Speaker C: Sudden those clients go under it. So you are in some sense incentivized.
00:32:56.462 - 00:32:59.254, Speaker D: To run a minority client and run.
00:32:59.292 - 00:33:02.710, Speaker C: One that may not make up 33%.
00:33:02.780 - 00:33:04.454, Speaker D: Or more of the network because then.
00:33:04.492 - 00:33:08.390, Speaker C: You'Re not at risk for those types of those bugs.
00:33:08.750 - 00:33:14.170, Speaker A: Yeah, it's almost like surge pricing or. Something, but applied in a completely different context.
00:33:14.830 - 00:33:15.530, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:33:15.680 - 00:33:16.380, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:33:16.990 - 00:33:35.450, Speaker A: All right. So in a moment, we're going to talk about how ETH the asset will change. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible. Crypto.com, the crypto super app that lets you buy, earn and spend crypto all in one place. Earn up to 8.5% per year on your BTC.
00:33:35.450 - 00:33:54.818, Speaker A: Download the Crypto.com app now to see the interest rates you could be earning on BTC and more than 20 other coins. Once in the app, you can apply for the Crypto.com metal card, which pays you up to 8% cash back instantly. Reserve years now in the Crypto.com app. Back to my conversation with Ryan, Watkins and Wilson.
00:33:54.818 - 00:34:24.818, Speaker A: With the M, yields for staking start at 30% if the number of ETH staked is around the 524,000 necessary to launch the beacon chain. But if it ever reaches 16 million ETH staked, the max yield would be about 4% a year. And if it goes higher, like to 100 million, then it would drop below 2%. So in general, when you look at this, does it feel like this is a good monetary policy that would keep the chain secure, et cetera, or are there any concerns that you have about it?
00:34:24.984 - 00:34:26.306, Speaker B: I think this is like a good.
00:34:26.328 - 00:34:37.906, Speaker E: Opportunity to talk about kind of the philosophy of ethereum's monetary policy. So Ethereum's monetary policy can be defined as minimum necessary issuance.
00:34:38.098 - 00:34:41.922, Speaker B: And the basic idea is that Ethereum.
00:34:41.986 - 00:35:07.454, Speaker E: Will always issue an amount of ETH that will keep the network secure over time. And the difference between this philosophy and, say, Bitcoins, which is deterministic issuance in fixed supply, is that whereas with Bitcoin, it's kind of optimizing for kind of like monetary idealism, in the sense that.
00:35:07.572 - 00:35:09.166, Speaker B: You had people that created this, that.
00:35:09.188 - 00:35:39.310, Speaker E: Wanted to create this extremely scarce fixed supply currency that was resistant to debasement. Whereas Ethereum says, hey, well, yes, we want our currency to be scarce. But what's more important is that Ethereum blockchain stays secure. So that's kind of like the monetary policy for Ethereum versus Bitcoin optimized for security over kind of like this monetary idealism.
00:35:39.490 - 00:35:43.510, Speaker B: Each has their own trade offs for Bitcoin.
00:35:43.590 - 00:36:04.682, Speaker E: The trade off is that in a sense, you kind of set your security budget arbitrarily in the beginning because you just said, hey, we're just going to have havings every four years and then we're going to have a fixed supply. And this fee market for block space is supposed to pick up and that's what's supposed to secure bitcoin in the long term.
00:36:04.826 - 00:36:10.162, Speaker B: And then the trade off for Ethereum is that, well, Ethereum's monetary policy means.
00:36:10.216 - 00:36:24.374, Speaker E: Sure, you can say that it's minimum necessary issuance, but who determines that? And then what does it actually mean, practically speaking? Because with Bitcoin, it's very easy to understand.
00:36:24.572 - 00:36:28.950, Speaker B: Yeah, every year there's going to be X amount issued.
00:36:30.330 - 00:36:36.506, Speaker E: This can be the total supply in 2056, it's all deterministic it's easy to understand but whereas with Ethereum it's just.
00:36:36.528 - 00:36:40.714, Speaker B: Like okay, I get that it's supposed.
00:36:40.752 - 00:36:42.206, Speaker E: To be a minimum necessary to be.
00:36:42.228 - 00:36:44.814, Speaker B: Secure but it's a little bit hard.
00:36:44.852 - 00:36:49.790, Speaker E: To wrap your head around what that means and how it works.
00:36:49.860 - 00:36:52.222, Speaker B: So there's downsides to both.
00:36:52.276 - 00:37:02.340, Speaker E: But I think there's room for experimentation. They each have their own benefits that each community believes are important.
00:37:02.950 - 00:37:30.586, Speaker A: One of the most interesting parts of your analysis around Ethereum 2.0 was about ETH the asset and how that will change. You said that under Ethereum 2.0 ETH will become a store of value, a capital asset and a commodity and that this is an unprecedented combination. So how does it fit the definition of all three and how do you know that this is the first time in history that this is like chris.
00:37:30.618 - 00:38:28.218, Speaker E: Berniski, I think back in 2017 introduced this paper from an academic called I think his name was like Robert Greer about the three superclasses of assets. That the idea is that every asset in the world that has ever existed can be classified into these three different categories. One being stores of value with the idea being that these are assets that maintained their purchasing power throughout time. Two being capital asset with the idea being that these are assets that produce or generate an income. And then three being commodities which are assets that can be consumed or are they transformable into something else. So examples of those would be for a capital asset would be a stock or a bond. In Apple this is kind of this income producing asset.
00:38:28.394 - 00:38:31.710, Speaker B: An example of commodity would be like oil.
00:38:32.450 - 00:38:37.698, Speaker E: You can use oil for a ton of different things to power your car. It can turn into different end products.
00:38:37.864 - 00:38:39.460, Speaker B: And then for a store of value.
00:38:40.390 - 00:39:03.994, Speaker E: It could be debatably the US dollar although some people would kind of scoff at that in the space. Or gold which actually is both a commodity and a store of value. So that's kind of like the high level idea of these asset classes. Now Ethereum and Ethereum 1.0 is a commodity and a store of value.
00:39:04.192 - 00:39:08.442, Speaker B: It's a commodity because it's used as.
00:39:08.496 - 00:39:29.218, Speaker E: Gas to pay for transactions. And I think this relationship will be or this analogy will be especially powerful when a new EIP is introduced called EIP 1559 where the majority of transaction fees will actually be burned instead of being paid for miners. So it'll quite literally be consumed by.
00:39:29.224 - 00:39:31.906, Speaker B: The Ethereum blockchain for store of value.
00:39:32.008 - 00:39:55.926, Speaker E: That'S Ethereum's use as an asset in DFI to store value to send transactions. That's the idea that's Ethereum as it takes today. Now with Ethereum 2.0 it introduces staking. And what staking allows you to do is you can post your ETH as collateral to become a validator on Ethereum.
00:39:55.958 - 00:39:58.394, Speaker B: 2.0 and now you can actually start.
00:39:58.432 - 00:40:01.882, Speaker E: Generating yield on your ETH.
00:40:02.026 - 00:40:04.014, Speaker B: And the amount of yield you will.
00:40:04.052 - 00:40:18.034, Speaker E: Get varies on the amount of ETH that's being staked. So at 524,288 E, kind of like you said before, the rate that you'll be getting is very high.
00:40:18.072 - 00:40:22.018, Speaker B: It'll be about say, like 23, 24%.
00:40:22.184 - 00:40:28.980, Speaker E: And then at about like 10 million or 16 million e staked, it'll be somewhere between like four and 6%.
00:40:29.350 - 00:40:32.018, Speaker B: But basic idea is that now you're.
00:40:32.034 - 00:41:05.842, Speaker E: Getting a yield on like a native yield on ETH. So when you combine those three things, it's like, well, you have all these different sources of demand for Ethy asset and ETH is being used for all these different things. And then I'm a little bit hesitant to say that it's unprecedented because I've not literally explored every asset in history. But from what I have seen is there's nothing really like this. Something that is a non sovereign store.
00:41:05.896 - 00:41:09.074, Speaker B: Of value, just like Bitcoin, that is.
00:41:09.112 - 00:41:12.942, Speaker E: Also used to power this globally scalable.
00:41:13.086 - 00:41:17.538, Speaker B: Computer and also offers a native yield.
00:41:17.714 - 00:41:24.086, Speaker E: Almost similar to a kind of like sovereign bond in a sense. And the combination of the three just.
00:41:24.108 - 00:41:28.738, Speaker B: Makes ETH super interesting as an asset.
00:41:28.914 - 00:41:44.960, Speaker A: And when you mentioned EIP 1559 and about how the fees will be burned so how do you think that will affect the issuance of ETH? Or the net issuance, I should say, and what it will look like in terms of a store of value?
00:41:46.050 - 00:41:49.886, Speaker E: Yeah, I think some helpful context as.
00:41:49.908 - 00:41:52.602, Speaker B: Well is that when the beacon chain.
00:41:52.666 - 00:41:55.618, Speaker E: Launches, hopefully eight days from now on.
00:41:55.624 - 00:41:57.986, Speaker B: December 1, all the issuance from the.
00:41:58.008 - 00:42:15.654, Speaker E: Beacon chain will actually be incremental to the issuance on Ethereum 1.0. So over the next year and a half then, Ethereum will issue about 3.8% worth or an annual inflation rate will be about three point eight, three point nine percent.
00:42:15.852 - 00:42:17.938, Speaker B: And then on the beacon chain, you'll.
00:42:17.954 - 00:42:39.934, Speaker E: Get an incremental issuance depending on how much Etha staked of anywhere from zero point 10% to 0.8%. In the most aggressive scenarios where there's like 30 million ETH staking. So in total, Ethereum monster policy is likely between four and 5% over the next one to two years.
00:42:40.132 - 00:42:44.382, Speaker B: Now, where this changes is that if.
00:42:44.436 - 00:42:52.386, Speaker E: EIP 1559 gets implemented on ETH One, where the majority of transaction will be taking place until the ETH One E.
00:42:52.408 - 00:42:54.626, Speaker B: Two merger is that you will actually.
00:42:54.648 - 00:43:11.334, Speaker E: Be able to reduce the issuance. In the meantime, I'll actually back up again. That's kind of like what the monster policy looks like for the next year and a half. And I think where it gets particularly interesting is once the ETH One merger happens and ETH One is now merging.
00:43:11.382 - 00:43:14.618, Speaker B: To E Two as a shard, well.
00:43:14.704 - 00:43:24.190, Speaker E: That once incremental issuance from the beacon chain, like I said, of 0.1% to 0.8% is now the only issuance for Ethereum.
00:43:24.610 - 00:43:34.318, Speaker B: And this is actually where it gets interesting because I believe it's at 20 million E staked per day Ethereum, and.
00:43:34.324 - 00:43:49.974, Speaker E: This is in Ethereum 2.0. At 20 million E staked per day, Ethereum will be issuing about 2000 E per day to pay to validators. And if you look at how much ETH per day people were paying over.
00:43:50.012 - 00:43:59.458, Speaker B: The summer in DFI, on average it was about 5000 E. Right. So if like Ethereum 2.0 was launched.
00:43:59.474 - 00:44:13.578, Speaker E: Today and people are playing the same amount of transaction fees, net issuance would be way negative. Now of course there's some nuance here and the big nuance is that Ethereum 2.0 is going to increase transaction scalability.
00:44:13.754 - 00:44:14.142, Speaker B: Right?
00:44:14.196 - 00:44:18.606, Speaker E: So in theory it will actually alleviate the fee pressure so that it's not.
00:44:18.708 - 00:44:21.310, Speaker B: Where you have to pay like $40.
00:44:21.380 - 00:44:25.806, Speaker E: To go and send your friend some money or exchange an asset on uniswap.
00:44:25.918 - 00:44:28.254, Speaker B: But according to some of the analysis.
00:44:28.302 - 00:44:42.866, Speaker E: That we did, that we based off the economic models that consensus put together, it looks like the likely issuance rate for Ethereum 2.0 will probably be like net issuance rates.
00:44:42.898 - 00:44:44.934, Speaker B: Like net of the burns will be.
00:44:45.132 - 00:44:53.034, Speaker E: Anywhere from say, like negative 0.5% to 0.5%. It really just depends on how many.
00:44:53.152 - 00:44:55.946, Speaker B: Validators are participating and then ultimately how.
00:44:55.968 - 00:45:03.034, Speaker E: Much ETH is being burned. But the big idea here is that issuance for Ethereum 2.0 will be extremely.
00:45:03.082 - 00:45:05.550, Speaker B: Low, if not negative.
00:45:06.130 - 00:45:45.658, Speaker A: And one other thing I wanted to ask about was the death that we mentioned earlier, these ETH derivatives that will be minted so that people can stake but also then continue to play around in the Ethereum One ecosystem. So let's say I stake my ETH and I get back some death and then I use that to mint Dai on MakerDAO. But then my vault gets liquidated. So hopefully people understood that. I think most of my listeners have been following my D Five posts or my Posts podcasts. But essentially that's like the money that you put up as collateral. Now you've lost it, but supposedly you own this ETH on Ethereum 2.0.
00:45:45.658 - 00:45:52.240, Speaker A: So if that happens, then who can claim the ETH that I've staked on Ethereum 2.0?
00:45:52.690 - 00:45:54.174, Speaker B: Yeah, so I guess this is like.
00:45:54.212 - 00:46:00.526, Speaker E: In basically before Phase 1.5 when E one merged into E two and you.
00:46:00.548 - 00:46:03.906, Speaker B: Have these derivatives where you can't actually.
00:46:04.008 - 00:46:06.110, Speaker E: Claim the underlying ETH.
00:46:06.270 - 00:46:09.314, Speaker B: So yeah, in this scenario where the.
00:46:09.352 - 00:46:48.522, Speaker E: MakerDAO system votes in kind of death like this derivative of ETH as collateral and then people are minting Dai against this collateral, the liquidation process would be the same. The collateralization ratio falls below the target amount, the death gets liquidated and then whoever's liquidator now has this de. It depends on the staking solution that created this death. But let's say it was like one of these decentralized protocols that minted this death. Yes, eventually you will be able to claim the underlying ETH by having this derivative.
00:46:48.666 - 00:46:50.014, Speaker B: And basically what it is, it's just.
00:46:50.052 - 00:46:52.866, Speaker E: Like for these decentralized staking protocols is.
00:46:52.888 - 00:47:05.362, Speaker B: That this de is a right to redeem a certain amount of underlying ETH. So if you hold, say, 32 de.
00:47:05.496 - 00:47:16.726, Speaker E: And the exchange rate is one to one you'll be able to redeem the 32 e once it is redeemable. I guess the important concept here is.
00:47:16.748 - 00:47:20.234, Speaker B: That yes, all these ETH derivatives are.
00:47:20.272 - 00:47:24.650, Speaker E: Fungible when they're issued from the same provider.
00:47:25.150 - 00:48:17.930, Speaker A: All right, so now let's talk about the fact that this whole process to moving to Ethereum 2.0 is going to take years. And meanwhile, Ethereum, as we've been talking about, has kind of been bumping up against its max capacity in particular because of DeFi, which is a pretty active ecosystem. And one of the issues with DeFi is that the different protocols in DeFi are composable, which is the way that people describe the fact that you can do a transaction that involves multiple of these protocols within one block and that's why they call DeFi money Legos. So because that would kind of like all the DeFi protocols would then sort of want to stay with each other to keep in the same ecosystem. What do you think is most likely to happen in the meantime to solve this fairly urgent problem that we already have around scaling.
00:48:18.750 - 00:48:26.638, Speaker D: Yeah, you're absolutely right. And a lot of the Ethereum researchers recognize this scalability is a need now.
00:48:26.724 - 00:48:30.846, Speaker C: And frankly, what Ethereum 2.0 can bring.
00:48:30.868 - 00:48:37.060, Speaker D: From a scalability perspective is years away, maybe a year, maybe a little bit over than that.
00:48:37.590 - 00:48:41.102, Speaker C: So in the short term, the solution.
00:48:41.166 - 00:48:43.666, Speaker D: That a lot like Vitalik and some.
00:48:43.688 - 00:48:45.874, Speaker C: Of the other teams have been working.
00:48:45.912 - 00:49:14.506, Speaker D: On for years is transitioning over to a L2 solution. And specifically the one everyone is talking about is called roll ups. There are various flavors of them but in general you can kind of look at them as roll up contracts. And essentially all it is, is taking a lot of the transactions that DeFi is handling today, moving them to a layer that's above Ethereum right now. So kind of taking them off chain, but having security ties back into the chain.
00:49:14.538 - 00:49:19.758, Speaker C: So they would periodically actually transfer these.
00:49:19.844 - 00:49:58.106, Speaker D: Transactions, batch them together and submit them to the base chain. So in a way, it's providing similar security guarantees. So I think the perspective is that even if any issues happen on these chains, on these other L2 solutions, you would still at any chance be able to claim the assets on the main chain. So right now it's kind of moving towards that L2 solution. And like you brought up, that the issue is as application moves from the.
00:49:58.128 - 00:50:00.026, Speaker C: Base chain up to one of those.
00:50:00.048 - 00:50:09.338, Speaker D: Layers, it removes those composability bonds. No longer will I be able to run a transaction that calls different applications.
00:50:09.514 - 00:50:10.650, Speaker C: In the same block.
00:50:10.730 - 00:50:15.438, Speaker D: It would have to be done in an asynchronous manner or it would have.
00:50:15.444 - 00:50:16.910, Speaker C: To take multiple blocks.
00:50:17.490 - 00:50:32.360, Speaker D: So that one issue with roll ups is that and one of the reasons why it has to be asynchronous is to ensure security, there is a lengthy withdrawal period. So I go up into a L2 protocol. I can start using an application that deployed a contract there.
00:50:32.730 - 00:50:34.166, Speaker C: I want to get back out and.
00:50:34.188 - 00:50:37.026, Speaker D: Use some of the other contracts I've.
00:50:37.058 - 00:50:41.420, Speaker C: Heard anywhere between three to four days to a week to get out.
00:50:42.270 - 00:50:45.322, Speaker D: So there is this issue of one.
00:50:45.376 - 00:50:53.950, Speaker C: Getting liquidity out, two, trying to call transactions between different applications across these two chains.
00:50:54.610 - 00:50:57.358, Speaker D: There aren't any limitations to composability within.
00:50:57.444 - 00:50:58.800, Speaker C: A single roll up.
00:50:59.170 - 00:51:07.362, Speaker D: So that might mean a lot of applications go and build on the same roll up. And eventually one of the issues is.
00:51:07.416 - 00:51:20.534, Speaker C: If everyone moves onto the same roll up, you start running to the same scalability issues that are present today. So that's why you kind of have.
00:51:20.652 - 00:51:22.502, Speaker D: This relationship where you're trying to figure.
00:51:22.556 - 00:51:23.926, Speaker C: Out what is the best way to.
00:51:23.948 - 00:51:26.694, Speaker D: Scale Ethereum but not lose what really.
00:51:26.732 - 00:51:30.626, Speaker C: Makes it special, which are some of these composability bonds.
00:51:30.818 - 00:51:34.982, Speaker D: There are some solutions in place that try and help out on the liquidity.
00:51:35.046 - 00:51:38.522, Speaker C: Side to minimize the issues of getting out.
00:51:38.656 - 00:51:41.426, Speaker D: So one could potentially be a cross.
00:51:41.478 - 00:51:48.030, Speaker C: Chain liquidity solution like THORChain for example, where you'd be able to actually move.
00:51:48.100 - 00:51:51.920, Speaker D: Between chains without waiting for that lengthy withdrawal time.
00:51:52.290 - 00:51:53.762, Speaker C: That's a decentralized option.
00:51:53.816 - 00:51:55.454, Speaker D: You can also go through a centralized.
00:51:55.502 - 00:51:58.370, Speaker C: Market maker to accomplish that.
00:51:58.520 - 00:52:01.058, Speaker D: There isn't a great solution to completely.
00:52:01.144 - 00:52:03.714, Speaker C: Fix the composability issues at this moment.
00:52:03.912 - 00:52:06.754, Speaker D: There are some solutions out there, one.
00:52:06.792 - 00:52:10.182, Speaker C: In particular called from Kinect's Network called.
00:52:10.236 - 00:52:12.594, Speaker D: Spacefolds which would allow two different layer.
00:52:12.642 - 00:52:16.710, Speaker C: Two networks to communicate and transact.
00:52:17.930 - 00:52:25.018, Speaker D: But right now it's still working towards what? Is that going to be a solution that would allow cross chain composability and that's definitely going to be one of.
00:52:25.024 - 00:52:27.260, Speaker C: Those issues going forward.
00:52:27.870 - 00:52:43.440, Speaker A: What's your sense? Do you think that they're going to address the scalability issues quickly enough or do you think that we're going to start to see significant migration over to some other blockchains? Like I've heard some people saying they're looking at polkadot solana Nier like what's your sense?
00:52:45.030 - 00:52:48.258, Speaker D: It's realistic that some applications there's going.
00:52:48.264 - 00:52:49.410, Speaker C: To be some leakage.
00:52:49.910 - 00:52:52.814, Speaker D: I think a lot of what's going on on DeFi right now is ethereum.
00:52:52.862 - 00:52:57.106, Speaker C: Centric and moving off is not part of their near term plan.
00:52:57.208 - 00:53:03.814, Speaker D: And if it's going to be, they're going to move up to a roll up solution. Also, a lot of these other networks aren't necessarily production ready.
00:53:03.932 - 00:53:05.158, Speaker C: They're really on kind of like the.
00:53:05.164 - 00:53:06.466, Speaker D: Same timeline as roll ups.
00:53:06.498 - 00:53:10.874, Speaker C: So the roll up solutions that we're talking about, some of the bigger name.
00:53:10.912 - 00:53:17.526, Speaker D: Ones like optimism and off chain labs's solution, they might be coming out sometime.
00:53:17.558 - 00:53:20.060, Speaker C: Within the next four to five months.
00:53:20.590 - 00:53:25.214, Speaker D: And you might see the same sort of maturity, trajectory, timelines for these other.
00:53:25.252 - 00:53:32.506, Speaker C: Chains to allow applications to actually start building on some of these. So I think some use cases, particularly.
00:53:32.538 - 00:53:34.494, Speaker D: Maybe non financial use cases, might move.
00:53:34.532 - 00:53:43.870, Speaker C: Over to some of these other chains. But I think when it comes to DeFi applications. Ethereum is where the action is and that's where a lot of these platforms.
00:53:44.030 - 00:53:46.514, Speaker D: That are building off of uniswap, building.
00:53:46.552 - 00:53:50.082, Speaker C: Off of compound, they're not going to want to move away from that.
00:53:50.136 - 00:53:53.462, Speaker D: And those base layer platforms aren't going to want to move from Ethereum because.
00:53:53.516 - 00:53:55.174, Speaker C: A lot of what they are doing.
00:53:55.212 - 00:53:56.514, Speaker D: Is based on that and it's tied.
00:53:56.562 - 00:53:59.674, Speaker C: Into what Ethereum has been building. And so if you want to really.
00:53:59.712 - 00:54:02.186, Speaker D: Get the advantages of what Ethereum 2.0.
00:54:02.208 - 00:54:05.018, Speaker C: Can bring down the line, staying within.
00:54:05.184 - 00:54:07.274, Speaker D: That ecosystem is really going to be.
00:54:07.312 - 00:54:10.780, Speaker C: A part of their roadmaps going forward.
00:54:11.790 - 00:54:50.790, Speaker A: All right, well, we'll have to see what happens. So we're running out of time a little bit. But I do still want to dive a little bit more into Phase One. Phase One point and at least Phase 1.5, we can discuss whether or not how deeply to go into 2.0. But one thing I wanted to understand about phase one was actually no, I should do this question all at once. Because, as you know, Vitalik wrote a post where he said because the movement toward roll ups is kind of happening at a pretty quick pace and there seems to be some consensus around that as a good way to scale.
00:54:50.790 - 00:55:35.880, Speaker A: And frankly, that if they make it work, then that will actually provide more transactions per second than the originally planned Ethereum 2.0. So he said that there's a scenario where Ethereum would move to Ethereum 1.5 and then be done. I wanted to know what your thoughts were in terms of whether or not or how likely you thought that would be to happen. But then also one thing when I was researching for the show that confused me a little bit is I read that so in Phase One, that's where they introduced the different shards. But then, yeah, I didn't really know how the shards work with the roll ups. Like, are we still going to have all these little mini blockchains and then also the roll ups or yeah, if you could help me and our sand and the listeners, that would be great.
00:55:36.410 - 00:55:52.382, Speaker D: One of the benefits that can happen when Phase One launches is that you have all these various shard chains. They're acting, as they call them, data availability layers. And really they can just act as.
00:55:52.436 - 00:55:55.982, Speaker C: Kind of storage layers, storage chains, and.
00:55:56.116 - 00:56:04.446, Speaker D: At the moment on their own somewhat useless, mainly just trying to get the network to come to consensus.
00:56:04.558 - 00:56:05.220, Speaker B: But.
00:56:07.270 - 00:56:10.846, Speaker C: There'S an option for roll ups.
00:56:10.878 - 00:56:19.078, Speaker D: To actually use these networks that they can plug into these networks and use them as data storage layers. So that would actually get if the.
00:56:19.084 - 00:56:23.814, Speaker C: Roll up plan works and you see applications moving up to another layer, they.
00:56:23.852 - 00:56:25.462, Speaker D: Can actually plug into one of these.
00:56:25.516 - 00:56:28.794, Speaker C: Various 64 shard chains and use them.
00:56:28.832 - 00:56:32.346, Speaker D: As kind of this data storage layer. And that would actually give you the.
00:56:32.368 - 00:56:41.200, Speaker C: Opportunity to use Ethereum 2.0 scalability earlier than Phase 1.5 or Phase Two.
00:56:41.890 - 00:57:06.466, Speaker A: Okay. So in a way it's not that different from Ethereum Two point zero's final vision in the sense that there would be kind of like there would be a layer for execution, there would be a layer for storage. It's just that in Ethereum 1.5 and Done what would happen is that the execution would happen on roll ups and then the storage would still be in the shards that are introduced in Phase one.
00:57:06.648 - 00:57:07.506, Speaker B: Is that it?
00:57:07.608 - 00:57:18.582, Speaker D: That's precisely correct. Exactly. So, yeah, the scalability, everything that's happening on the base layer that would all be taken care of by shard chains that plug into the beacon chain. All the execution where the applications live.
00:57:18.636 - 00:57:22.918, Speaker C: Where users actually interact with that's going to all happen on a roll up layer.
00:57:23.094 - 00:57:30.730, Speaker A: Okay, so what do you think the ODS are? That we end up with Ethereum 1.5 and Done versus Ethereum 2.0 as originally planned?
00:57:32.430 - 00:57:36.410, Speaker D: I think a lot of applications are going to move up to roll ups.
00:57:36.490 - 00:57:42.094, Speaker C: This is all dependent on how much adoption rollups get. And right now you're starting to see.
00:57:42.132 - 00:57:44.286, Speaker D: Synthetics be very bullish on the fact.
00:57:44.308 - 00:57:47.122, Speaker C: That rollups are going to lead are.
00:57:47.176 - 00:57:49.186, Speaker D: Really going to be the near to.
00:57:49.208 - 00:57:51.486, Speaker C: Midterm scaling solution for Ethereum.
00:57:51.678 - 00:57:56.626, Speaker D: There's a good chance Uniswap has done some integrations with optimism as well, which.
00:57:56.648 - 00:57:58.190, Speaker C: Is a rollup solution.
00:57:58.350 - 00:58:01.414, Speaker D: And as soon as you start to see some of these big D Five.
00:58:01.452 - 00:58:04.326, Speaker C: Players move up I just suspect that.
00:58:04.348 - 00:58:11.218, Speaker D: A lot of other applications will move up as well because they're very reliant on those. They plug into them and they, like.
00:58:11.244 - 00:58:19.434, Speaker C: We said, are composable with each other. If this roll up solution works out and pans out, which I think it will, I think there's a very good.
00:58:19.472 - 00:58:27.274, Speaker D: Chance that you'll either see no Phase Two or a very limited Phase two. So maybe instead of putting execution layers.
00:58:27.322 - 00:58:29.710, Speaker C: On every shard chain maybe it's like.
00:58:29.780 - 00:58:36.226, Speaker D: Four to eight of the shard chains, a very small percentage which kind of limits the complexity and limits development time.
00:58:36.248 - 00:58:37.854, Speaker C: So you can actually get there sooner.
00:58:37.982 - 00:58:40.162, Speaker D: But I think there is a very.
00:58:40.216 - 00:58:47.250, Speaker C: Strong chance that either Phase Two gets dialed back or there's really very little need to go that far.
00:58:47.320 - 00:58:48.854, Speaker D: So you'll be able to actually use.
00:58:48.892 - 00:58:54.066, Speaker C: Ethereum 2.0 for its scalability needs a lot sooner than initially projected.
00:58:54.258 - 00:58:56.326, Speaker B: Yeah, and then I was going to.
00:58:56.348 - 00:59:06.598, Speaker E: Say one thing I would add is that with sharding phase one sharding, like using these shards and data availability layers.
00:59:06.774 - 00:59:09.274, Speaker B: And roll ups you can probably get.
00:59:09.312 - 00:59:13.350, Speaker E: About 100,000 transactions per second.
00:59:13.520 - 00:59:15.838, Speaker B: And the benefit of this is that.
00:59:15.924 - 00:59:19.886, Speaker E: This could potentially come in the next twelve to 24 months and then you.
00:59:19.908 - 00:59:22.686, Speaker B: Have an Ethereum 2.0 which can scale.
00:59:22.718 - 00:59:48.870, Speaker E: Ethereum like orders of magnitude. So if the ecosystem adapts to this world then we get scalability way sooner than we would if we were to wait for Phase Two. And then at that point, the prospect of doing phase two becomes less attractive because you don't actually get any incremental scalability from enabling computation on these shards.
00:59:49.930 - 01:00:26.980, Speaker A: Yeah, I already know we made a bet in this episode, but I think if I were to make another bet, I would also bet on this, assuming that everything continues going as it's been going. All right, so we're going to do two last quick questions. One is just like a general question, but one is for people who might be interested in staking. What do you think is the biggest risk that Ethereum 2.0 faces? Like, if you were an Ethereum researcher or developer or whatever, what would you be thinking about most right now or working on most right now? Where do you see potentially the biggest pitfalls in the game plan moving forward?
01:00:27.750 - 01:00:33.654, Speaker B: One is around ETH derivatives. So there is this idea that maybe.
01:00:33.692 - 01:01:17.618, Speaker E: Just to kind of zoom out a little bit higher level is that there's always this trade off between in cryptocurrency specifically that people care about, between decentralization and convenience. And people oftentimes are comfortable custodyding their cryptocurrencies and centralized exchanges or custodians or in the case of staking, is comfortable staking through a service provider rather than doing it themselves. And the reason why this is important is because there could be a scenario, although I know I think this is unlikely because of the existence of decentralized staking options and in the fact that validating is very accessible to the average user.
01:01:17.794 - 01:01:20.598, Speaker B: But there is a scenario where a.
01:01:20.604 - 01:01:24.306, Speaker E: Lot of people end up staking with say like a Coinbase or a binance.
01:01:24.338 - 01:01:27.458, Speaker B: Of the world and Coinbase or Binance.
01:01:27.554 - 01:01:30.226, Speaker E: Issues their own ETH derivative.
01:01:30.418 - 01:01:33.074, Speaker B: And then that ETH derivative becomes extremely.
01:01:33.122 - 01:01:53.886, Speaker E: Liquid in secondary markets. It starts to get a lot of integrations in DeFi, maybe even CFI as well. So now you can borrow and lend against it and this kind of liquidity creates a network effect. Actually, Dana Litter wrote, like, a great piece on this where it almost comes like a USDT, like, tether kind of.
01:01:53.908 - 01:01:56.306, Speaker B: Thing, where if people want to go.
01:01:56.328 - 01:02:19.850, Speaker E: And stake, they're probably going to go do it with the centralized. Service provider because, yes, it's convenient, but most importantly, they get liquidity and utility from this E derivative that's not available with these other options. So there's a scenario where staking could end up centralized for this reason. But like I said, I don't think this risk is likely, but it is a possibility.
01:02:21.630 - 01:02:34.842, Speaker D: I was going to echo that. I think staking centralization is one of the biggest issues that some people present as a problem with staking because it's very real. People like convenience.
01:02:34.906 - 01:02:37.550, Speaker C: They usually pick convenience over sovereignty.
01:02:38.210 - 01:02:39.358, Speaker D: So you could see a lot of.
01:02:39.364 - 01:02:45.906, Speaker C: People staking with exchanges very easily. But I will preface this with the.
01:02:45.928 - 01:02:55.682, Speaker D: Design around E 2.0. Somewhat disincentivizes that because, like we said, if the validators are running the same.
01:02:55.736 - 01:03:00.006, Speaker C: Clients and they all happen to go down at once, those ones will be.
01:03:00.028 - 01:03:07.862, Speaker D: More likely to be the ones that get slashed. Because another one of the designs around E Two 10 we didn't mention this.
01:03:07.916 - 01:03:10.858, Speaker C: Is there are slashing penalties, but the.
01:03:10.864 - 01:03:12.938, Speaker D: Slashing penalties get ramped up if more.
01:03:13.024 - 01:03:17.180, Speaker C: Validators are offline or behaving maliciously at the same time.
01:03:17.630 - 01:03:20.858, Speaker D: So if you're running all these validators on the same services and they're kind.
01:03:20.864 - 01:03:24.986, Speaker C: Of doing the same thing, they all fall offline at the same time, they'll.
01:03:25.018 - 01:03:27.854, Speaker D: All get slashed a much higher amount.
01:03:27.972 - 01:03:32.310, Speaker C: So if you're staking with a single service, you're at a much higher risk.
01:03:32.410 - 01:03:35.330, Speaker D: Unless they're using some sort of decentralized.
01:03:36.310 - 01:03:38.420, Speaker C: Validator service on the back end.
01:03:40.070 - 01:03:52.246, Speaker E: And I was going to say that kind of brings up a point that's kind of related to the E derivatives as well is that if, like a centralized service provider, say Coinbase were to.
01:03:52.268 - 01:03:54.946, Speaker B: Issue their own ETH derivative, the risk.
01:03:54.978 - 01:04:15.178, Speaker E: Of that ETH derivative are not the same as the risk of a decentralized staking pool issuing its own derivative. And the key difference is that with Coinbase the risk is mean beyond the custodial risk. But the risk is that for the derivative is that Coinbase's validators just don't.
01:04:15.194 - 01:04:17.610, Speaker B: Perform or they behave maliciously.
01:04:17.770 - 01:04:20.506, Speaker E: Whereas with you, with the E derivative.
01:04:20.538 - 01:04:23.774, Speaker B: That is centralized staking protocol issues, the.
01:04:23.812 - 01:04:53.610, Speaker E: Validator risks are spread across this entire kind of like network of validators in this protocol. Actually, I think one good analogy, hopefully it doesn't bring memories of the financial crisis when you think about this, but it's a difference between an individual mortgage and a mortgage backed security that kind of pools all these individual mortgages into one security to diversify the risk.
01:04:55.070 - 01:05:11.840, Speaker A: Yeah, it's like a reverse analogy but anyway okay, so then this is the questioner for people who are potentially interested in participating. What do you think is riskier putting your money in DFI or trying to stake on ethereum 2.0 at this point?
01:05:12.550 - 01:05:22.994, Speaker E: So I think it depends on what you're doing in DeFi. Basically anytime you put your money into.
01:05:23.032 - 01:05:26.806, Speaker B: DeFi there are a bunch of different.
01:05:26.828 - 01:05:59.226, Speaker E: Risks that you assume. There is smart contract risk, there is composability risk because of all these different protocols interacting. And then there's also the risk of just ethereum as a blockchain failing which kind of like I think of it as like the systemic risk of DeFi. Whereas with staking there's really just two risks. One being validator risk which you can diversify away with these decentralized staking solutions and then just kind of systemic risk of ethereum. So those are the kind of differences in risk.
01:05:59.338 - 01:06:02.078, Speaker B: Now within DeFi there's a bunch of.
01:06:02.084 - 01:06:27.800, Speaker E: Different things you can do. I mean, you could deposit your funds into compound which has been heavily audited and known and reputable team, or you could go in, go put your money into a new yield farm that popped up yesterday that some pseudonymous developers created and you risk. Getting like rug pulled. So there's a lot of differences here.
01:06:30.270 - 01:06:33.930, Speaker B: I would say, yes, they are competitive.
01:06:34.990 - 01:06:37.980, Speaker E: But there's kind of different things.
01:06:40.110 - 01:07:02.980, Speaker A: I don't know every last person who listens to my show, but I'm pretty sure if they're listening to my show, then a lot of them wouldn't know going into an unaudited DeFi contract by an anonymous developer and getting pulled. So hopefully, hopefully I'm sure people will write in now and be like, that happened to me, but anyway and Wilson, do you have a take?
01:07:03.670 - 01:07:18.194, Speaker D: Yeah, I think obviously it comes down, it's different personas are attracted to the various forms of risk. So there's going to just going to be a different user type that is willing to dive into these unaudited contracts.
01:07:18.322 - 01:07:20.966, Speaker C: That are proposing high yield returns.
01:07:21.158 - 01:07:28.186, Speaker D: But it's going to depend on what applications you're going to use and what is your investment horizon. If you're looking at on a long.
01:07:28.208 - 01:07:33.566, Speaker C: Term, staking is going to be relatively safe as long as you're doing your.
01:07:33.588 - 01:07:35.694, Speaker D: Research on what validator provider that you.
01:07:35.732 - 01:07:43.634, Speaker C: End up using and what service you're going to go forward with that because like we said, it's very difficult to.
01:07:43.672 - 01:07:48.482, Speaker D: Not make money on the staking part. So you're really going to have to.
01:07:48.536 - 01:07:54.754, Speaker C: Work hard to not have a good uptime or use a validating service that.
01:07:54.792 - 01:07:58.226, Speaker D: May not be as trustworthy, to not make some sort of return or lose.
01:07:58.258 - 01:07:59.126, Speaker C: Your money on it.
01:07:59.228 - 01:08:01.206, Speaker D: Whereas with DeFi, of course, there are.
01:08:01.228 - 01:08:06.774, Speaker C: Some applications that are very well audited that have done a lot of work.
01:08:06.892 - 01:08:09.782, Speaker D: On that service and are trustworthy within.
01:08:09.916 - 01:08:15.240, Speaker C: The whole ecosystem that would be just as safe to work with.
01:08:16.490 - 01:08:18.758, Speaker D: And then obviously there's a whole other.
01:08:18.844 - 01:08:29.134, Speaker C: Part to it at where the madness comes in, where these flash loan attacks are very relevant. So it's just something to keep an eye out for that.
01:08:29.172 - 01:08:31.294, Speaker D: There are just more risks involved with.
01:08:31.332 - 01:08:32.960, Speaker C: DeFi at this point.
01:08:33.590 - 01:08:46.706, Speaker A: All right, well, this has been super fascinating to dive into this huge momentous change happening on one of the biggest blockchains where can people learn more about each of you and Masari.
