00:01:16.414 - 00:01:17.926, Speaker C: Thanks for having us.
00:01:18.108 - 00:01:19.400, Speaker D: Yeah, thank you.
00:01:20.090 - 00:01:39.420, Speaker A: Let's start with each of your backgrounds. Sam, you have your hands in number of different things in crypto, plus you're famous for your tweet threads, and I have often seen a lot of people on Twitter wondering when you sleep. So why don't you tell us how you came to be involved in crypto and what are all the things that you're working?
00:01:40.910 - 00:01:57.206, Speaker E: You know, I guess my background. I went to MIT, sort of had no idea what I was doing there. Stumbled into finance, ended up being a Quant trader at Jane Street Capital, and partially because it was an opportunity for me to potentially be able to donate.
00:01:57.258 - 00:01:59.074, Speaker C: A lot of money, and partially because.
00:01:59.112 - 00:02:00.894, Speaker E: It was just a really good environment.
00:02:00.942 - 00:02:03.566, Speaker C: And I really liked it and they're.
00:02:03.598 - 00:02:04.626, Speaker E: Very good to me, and it was.
00:02:04.648 - 00:02:10.454, Speaker C: Sort of an exciting job. So I was there for a bit.
00:02:10.492 - 00:02:15.826, Speaker E: Over three years, and then 2017 happened and I sort of had an itch.
00:02:16.018 - 00:02:18.906, Speaker C: To start something, an itch to go.
00:02:18.928 - 00:02:42.346, Speaker E: On my own and try building something. So I left and ended up starting Alameda Research, which is a crypto quant trading firm. And so it does arbitrage quantity of trading OTC trading market making things like that across the crypto ecosystem, trading something like a billion dollars a day notionally. And that was sort of like chapter.
00:02:42.378 - 00:02:44.466, Speaker C: One in crypto for me.
00:02:44.568 - 00:02:52.126, Speaker E: And then later on in spring 2019, started up FTX, which is a global.
00:02:52.158 - 00:03:00.246, Speaker C: Crypto derivatives exchange, and kind of been growing that out to also somewhere around.
00:03:00.268 - 00:03:05.622, Speaker E: A billion dollars a day of notional. And then more recently started up Project.
00:03:05.676 - 00:03:10.650, Speaker C: Serum, which is a decentralized ecosystem built on Solana.
00:03:11.070 - 00:03:12.298, Speaker E: And then to sort of get to.
00:03:12.304 - 00:03:14.186, Speaker C: Your point about doing a lot of.
00:03:14.208 - 00:03:18.460, Speaker E: Things and how I manage. I think part of this is that.
00:03:19.950 - 00:03:21.226, Speaker C: I have this itching, and I get.
00:03:21.248 - 00:03:23.926, Speaker E: Super impatient if I feel like I don't have enough on my plate.
00:03:23.958 - 00:03:27.038, Speaker C: If I feel like I have more slack, then I sort of feel like.
00:03:27.044 - 00:03:32.160, Speaker E: Oh, boy, there's something I can do with that. And so the things I do naturally expand to fit that.
00:03:32.690 - 00:03:35.966, Speaker C: And I think a lot of this.
00:03:36.148 - 00:03:39.250, Speaker E: I think really a huge part of this is having a team that I trust.
00:03:39.400 - 00:03:45.118, Speaker C: I think that's something which there are a lot of really good teams in crypto, but even there's a lot of.
00:03:45.144 - 00:03:46.198, Speaker E: Really bad ones, even a lot of.
00:03:46.204 - 00:03:50.230, Speaker C: The good teams don't have trust and so it's like you don't have the ability.
00:03:52.330 - 00:03:55.126, Speaker E: To grow beyond yourself in some.
00:03:55.148 - 00:04:00.122, Speaker C: Ways anyway, that sort of helped a lot.
00:04:00.256 - 00:04:05.638, Speaker E: So I nap now and then I have beanbags under my desk as has been photo.
00:04:05.654 - 00:04:17.120, Speaker C: It's the bed in a side room at the office and I'll often just get a few four hour naps in and go back to shit posting on Twitter in between.
00:04:18.610 - 00:04:24.350, Speaker A: And Anatoly. How about you? How did you come into the space and what do you do with Salana Labs?
00:04:25.090 - 00:05:14.766, Speaker D: I guess I'll start with my background too. I went to school in Urbana Champagne like 99, 2003. So I was there through the.com crash and I remember my advisors telling me that computer science might not be a good career. Had a actually one of the Solana Labs co founders, greg and I and a couple other folks had a startup doing voiceover IP stuff that didn't pan out because of the.com crash, but we ended up at Qualcomm. I spent most of my career working in optimizations, kind of trying to make this this was at before iPhones, right? We're trying to take all this desktop complicated software and stuff it into effectively like a microcontroller embedded system that people were calling a phone and try to make it work.
00:05:14.766 - 00:05:59.338, Speaker D: So that was kind of where I cut my teeth as an engineer and it was a ton of fun and always kind of a constant challenge and Solana actually comes from that period. Solana beach is a town in San Diego where we wake up surf, bike to work, bike, home, surf again. That was a fun decade. I ended up in San Francisco in 2017 and you kind of saw this crazy boom for crypto during that time and at a startup with another one of the Qualcomm co founders, Steven. This was like a side gig. We were trying to buy deep learning hardware and offset the capital cost of this with crypto mining.
00:05:59.434 - 00:05:59.886, Speaker C: Right.
00:05:59.988 - 00:07:12.230, Speaker D: I'm sure there's people pitching this stuff still, but this was purely for fun, right? How do we get a bunch of GPU cards together and do something fun with it? But both of us started really thinking about what is proof of work, why does it work, why is it interesting? And I had this light bulb moment, literally had like two coffees and a beer. It was up till four in the morning and I realized that you can use the same premature resistant hash function, but instead of measuring how much entropy goes into the puzzle, you can measure how much time goes into the puzzle that it solves. Once the light bulb went off, I realized that all the stuff we worked on at Qualcomm, like this decade of working in wireless protocols, like optimizing stuff for communication, it's all applicable in blockchain because all you really need is a source of time outside of the system before consensus. And that was really kind of the foundation of the company. I was kind of lucky in the timing, too. Qualcomm was being taken over by or. There was an attempt to buy Qualcomm by Broadcom and a bunch of people were unhappy and were kind of scattering to the Googles and Facebook's of the world.
00:07:12.230 - 00:07:42.400, Speaker D: And I knew a lot of the super senior operating systems network people and got them on board and to join up and build this thing. And philosophically, we kind of took everything that we learned from optimizing mobile platforms, mobile operating systems, and ported into a layer one. And I think we kind of have this unique perspective that you should always be building for hardware that's going to come out two years from now, which a lot of folks, I think, don't have in the space.
00:07:43.830 - 00:08:49.190, Speaker A: So for listeners who are maybe wondering why they're on the same show, hopefully you figured out, if you don't know about Project Serum, that it is being developed on Solana. And so there's a lot of interesting things to mine around this issue of stuff that Anna Tully mentioned and just around scaling and different layer ones and where things are going to go. But let's actually maybe just dive into the main problem that, well, as far as I can understand that I think you were trying to solve with Solana, which is around scaling. Here we have a lot of layer one chains that are attempting to solve this with a technique that's called sharding, which spreads validation across the blockchain into smaller pieces, but that essentially makes each shard its own blockchain, which then makes it harder for decentralized applications to interact with each other across the shards. And Solanda takes a different approach to scaling. How do you do it and why did you take a different approach?
00:08:49.530 - 00:09:53.130, Speaker D: Well, I'm actually curious why people didn't take our approach. But basically this comes down to the foundation to limits a communication is like the Shannon Hartley theorem, right? You have noise, you have power, and you can stuff as many bits as you can, and you can increase power to overcome noise. But the bandwidth of the channel, how much bandwidth you have, is the limiting factor. And this is true for complicated systems like layer ones or like radio towers as well. So when you see what is four G to five G, it's literally just using a wider set of frequency bands, like just more bandwidth, right, to stuff more information through these pipes. And the way we approach this in mobile is to use more hardware, use more cores, more silicon, because this stuff is improving at an exponential pace. Every two years, somebody's going to double capacity, like we just saw Nvidia release a card, 30, 90, or whatever.
00:09:53.130 - 00:10:42.842, Speaker D: That's got 10,000 cores. So from our perspective, when you have something like a blockchain, which is limited by how many participants you can concurrently keep track of and how many packets per second you can send across the network and how many folks you can talk to, there are fundamental limits to these algorithms, right. Folks have R and D has been done already, right. Since the our approach is then, okay, well, how do we increase the bandwidth of this thing? Just horizontally scale it on as much hardware as we can, and two years from now, it'll be double that right. And this is an exponential curve that you just really can't fight. If you're fighting against this curve, you're going to lose. So fundamentally, this has been our approach to scaling this.
00:10:42.842 - 00:11:47.470, Speaker D: But the reason why I think another kind of philosophical reason why we went for this path is that I think if you get rid of this store of value as a use case, and I'm not sure you can argue that proof of stake networks are fundamentally store of value. What you're left with in a smart contracts platform is price discovery. You have a single kind of engine for state transitions. Those state transitions have financial value, and everybody in the world is trying to extract free money out of it. It is by definition, like an exchange, right? It's not like a spot exchange where you have bids and asks and things are kind of simple, right? You have these really complicated programs that can do arbitrary things, but you look at this giant mondo state machine and you do your best to figure out, hey, is there any free money here? If there is, I'm going to send a transaction to get it right. And everybody in the world is doing this. So if that's the case, if our only use case is price discovery, then what we need to build is something that is moving as fast as the news that a state transition occurs somewhere.
00:11:47.470 - 00:12:33.546, Speaker D: Meteor strikes, some cornfield, right? And we need to change the price of corn that should reflect across the world as fast as information travels for fiber. And our job is to get those state transitions replicated across the entire world as fast as we can. So this is kind of like the use case that we've been building for and how we've been approaching this problem. And I think kind of like it was awesome to meet Sam because I think he kind of I remember him actually saying this in our conversation, that we only really need to be as fast as the news. And this was like the first person actually talked to that realized, I think had the same intuition about the world. That stuff that's faster than the news is just trading statistical noise. It's not actually important.
00:12:33.728 - 00:13:39.710, Speaker A: It's just so fascinating. I love the way that you described that about how a blockchain is almost like an exchange and people send transactions to try to extract value. I love that description. Yeah. And I just actually also wanted to quote from Kyle Simani of Multicoin Capital who has invested in Solana and he just described something about the layer two issue which the way he expressed it was so fascinating to me, mainly because so many developers are working on layer two solutions. He wrote, quote, Developers building smart contracts don't want to deal with layer two and sharding or cross shard application state and logic, or cross shard latency, or security models and side chains, or liquidity routing and stage channel networks, or how they might run computations off chain using zero knowledge proofs. The entire point of having a smart contract chain is that the chain itself abstracts all of the lower level complexities and economic system necessary to deliver trust to minimize computation, allowing developers to focus on application logic.
00:13:39.710 - 00:14:15.470, Speaker A: So yeah, that was really interesting the way he expressed that because like I said, everybody is working on layer two. But something else I wanted to ask you was you've said that Salana can handle 60,000 transactions per second and right now I think you have about or Salana has about 130 nodes. So on the other hand, Bitcoin has over 10,000 nodes, ethereum has about 9000. Do you think that 130 nodes is sufficiently decentralized to not be vulnerable to attacks or even collusion as some people have surmised has happened with EOS, which also has a limited number of nodes?
00:14:16.610 - 00:14:26.130, Speaker E: I'm interested in what you say. I'll say one thing that I've noticed here is what exactly do you mean by decentralization?
00:14:26.470 - 00:14:32.114, Speaker C: Because one sort of interesting thing worth noting is that if you look at.
00:14:32.152 - 00:14:33.794, Speaker E: For instance, ethereum, as it is right.
00:14:33.832 - 00:14:36.222, Speaker C: Now, and you look at the miners.
00:14:36.286 - 00:14:44.086, Speaker E: Who control the security effectively of this the distribution of hash power by miners. It's the top three have more than.
00:14:44.108 - 00:14:45.798, Speaker C: Half the hash power, and it's, in.
00:14:45.804 - 00:14:54.618, Speaker E: Fact, I think, a little bit less decentralized than the Solana Validators are right now. It's also the case, obviously, that Solana launched recently and that number is sort.
00:14:54.624 - 00:14:58.406, Speaker C: Of like growing exponentially. But it's like one thing that strikes.
00:14:58.438 - 00:14:59.818, Speaker E: Me whenever people ask about the sort.
00:14:59.824 - 00:15:04.320, Speaker C: Of number of nodes on it is what's the goalpost here?
00:15:04.690 - 00:16:36.346, Speaker D: I think this is a key question and this isn't like a question about us versus Ethereum because I think this is a question for the Chief Security Officer at Visa who is going to take a bet on running stuff on these networks and how do they analyze security and censorship? Right? How are they going to approach this problem assuming everything we say is meaningless? Right? From their perspective, words are meaningless. What is my risk that I'm taking by using any one of these networks? And the way I think you can analyze this is you can look at whatever algorithm you're using. Nakamoto PBFT there's some threshold to where the network breaks, right? And then what is the minimum number of machines that I need physical entry to get to that threshold? With proof of work, it's actually like 51% will get you there, right? It's lower than that. But without arguing with anybody, with any professors, 51% is clearly that with proof of stake, it's 33%. In some cases, it's a little higher, depending how you tweak things. So then the job of when we ask what is decentralization, it's that minimum set in Ethereum, it's pretty low. And so in Bitcoin as well, we kind of run in this world where we don't have any attackers on these main networks because the reputational cost is just too high.
00:16:36.346 - 00:17:23.130, Speaker D: But you see stuff fall over on Ethereum. Classic. So, like, if CSO of Bitcoin or a Chief Security Officer of Visa is going to look at how do I deploy money on Ethereum, they're going to sandbox that risk assuming the network can easily be taken over. So they do things like Circle and USDT, where they effectively control the funds, and they honor the redemptions when they feel like it. Right? And they can freeze your accounts and things like that, but at the end of the day, the funds are at Bitfinex or Circle. Right. And this is how I think, where these networks are still immature, even what we consider mature ones like Bitcoin and Ethereum.
00:17:23.130 - 00:17:58.934, Speaker D: When you look at proof of stake, tezos Cosmos, every proof of stake network right now out there have about less than eight entities that control 33% of the network. So those numbers are still pretty small. Our testnet called Tour de Soul, it's about 90. So it's like ten times bigger than that. Our main net is about eight as well. And that's simply because of stake distribution. Like capital, when it's lazy, it just kind of goes to a single spot, and it's got this pareto distribution where most of the top tier validators attract the most capital, right.
00:17:58.934 - 00:18:25.600, Speaker D: Most of the top tier mining pools attract the most hash power. And this is what's keeping these networks centralized. And it's not really a question of how many copies of the ledger you have, how many full nodes you have. That's a meaningless number. It doesn't add to the security. It's not going to make the Chief Security Officer of Visa any feel any better if there's 10,000 copies of the ledger, if three mining pools can basically break all their assumptions about security.
00:18:25.970 - 00:18:54.360, Speaker A: Okay, so I don't know if I really understood every last thing that you said. But essentially what you're saying is that the way I frame the question is the comparison doesn't really make sense because of the fact that there are these concentrations of power where if you do know the three people who, when you add them up together, they can collude, then you can target a small number. So in a way, it doesn't matter that Salana has a small number. Is that what you're saying?
00:18:56.410 - 00:19:12.974, Speaker D: One point is our main net is about 180 full nodes validators. Our distribution on testnet is about 480. So it's much higher than just like three or five, but the number of.
00:19:13.012 - 00:19:16.030, Speaker A: Full nodes but you were saying it's three for ethereum.
00:19:16.850 - 00:19:28.926, Speaker D: So the number of full nodes that add up to some meaningful threshold in the consensus is what matters, not the total number of full nodes because the copies of the ledger are meaningless.
00:19:29.118 - 00:19:32.020, Speaker A: Right? Okay. Yeah, that's what I thought you were saying.
00:19:32.390 - 00:19:33.140, Speaker C: Okay.
00:19:33.670 - 00:19:35.198, Speaker E: In some sense, just like actually a.
00:19:35.224 - 00:19:49.298, Speaker C: Lot of chains could probably use quite a bit more decentralization in the effective weight of who's validating these or producing these blocks. And I think that includes almost every chain in the world if you're not.
00:19:49.324 - 00:19:51.398, Speaker E: Willing to rely on things like reputation.
00:19:51.574 - 00:19:57.338, Speaker C: And people not wanting to nuke and get fully slashed in order to try.
00:19:57.344 - 00:19:58.358, Speaker E: And attack a chain.
00:19:58.454 - 00:20:02.220, Speaker C: But another thing I think worth noting, and I think this is almost like.
00:20:02.830 - 00:20:06.126, Speaker E: Commonly misunderstood and I misunderstanding until I.
00:20:06.148 - 00:20:08.254, Speaker C: Thought about it, is that you can.
00:20:08.292 - 00:20:14.222, Speaker E: Scale up the number of validators on solana. You can scale up a lot. And it has been growing and probably.
00:20:14.276 - 00:20:16.906, Speaker C: Will keep growing if the network keeps.
00:20:16.938 - 00:20:18.498, Speaker E: Growing, if the number of users do.
00:20:18.584 - 00:20:19.822, Speaker C: And the key thing is it doesn't.
00:20:19.886 - 00:20:21.298, Speaker E: Really hurt performance that much.
00:20:21.384 - 00:20:23.106, Speaker C: So it's not like this is the.
00:20:23.128 - 00:20:24.146, Speaker E: Only way it can get this number.
00:20:24.168 - 00:20:34.054, Speaker C: Of blocks through is by having this number of validators. Now, Anteline knows way more about this than I do, but it's not a fundamental limitation in any way, okay?
00:20:34.092 - 00:20:39.900, Speaker A: So it's not like EOS where they had to have a small number of validators to keep that high.
00:20:43.070 - 00:21:48.778, Speaker D: Like, and this really surprised me in the industry that people weren't measuring TPS this way. For us, TPS is a meaningful number because our consensus messages are smart contract transactions. So our capacity to process transactions like serum transactions or payments is the same as the number of consensus messages we can use. And that what limits the validator set. So to me, doubling TPS but not doubling the number of validators that can participate in consensus is almost like a joke. That's not like a meaningful doubling of anything interesting, right? It's kind of like you're cheating, right? You're stuffing more kind of fake transactions into a single meaningful one and batching a bunch of them and delegating that decision to somebody else. So kind of like for us, the way I see it is for this space to succeed, we need to get to a point where we have 3000 machines that are required for somebody to get physical entry to stop the network.
00:21:48.778 - 00:23:09.694, Speaker D: And at this point, somebody that's like at Visa, Mastercard are going to look at this network and be like, well, it's probably mathematically impossible to go do this, right, to do this attack unless there's a bug in the technology itself, right? But actually physically go find these 3000 people and break into their setups and get a hold of their private keys and then sign invalid state, right? That's kind of an insurmountable problem. And at that point, we will start being competitive with real regulated financial networks. So for us, every time Nvidia doubles their cores, right, we double our capacity for TPS, which doubles the number of validators that can participate in consensus, which allows us to get to that meaningful number where somebody that's at Visa or Mastercard just kind of gives up. They're like, okay, this thing is just impenetrable, let's go use it because it's cheaper, it's less of a headache, right? Like to actually go use this versus deal with the red tape and all the other stuff that they do. And this is to me kind of what we're striving for as fast as we can. So on our testnet, we're running this autonomous staking agents that people are running instead of staking directly. And this is what allows us to evenly distribute the stake across almost all 500 validators.
00:23:09.694 - 00:23:24.010, Speaker D: And this is why it takes over around 100 or so to get up to that 33% number. And when the validators have doubles, we can keep increasing this kind of meaningful, decentralization threshold.
00:23:24.430 - 00:23:33.598, Speaker A: You keep mentioning Visa and Mastercard and I have to say this has thrown me for a loop. So you're envisioning the likes of Visa and Mastercard wanting to use Solana, is that it?
00:23:33.764 - 00:24:05.498, Speaker D: I think Sam is like an entrepreneur. That's way ahead of his time, right? Because he has vision that all finance is going to a good chunk of finance is going to run on these systems because they're just better. They don't require any people, right? You build a software, it runs on this thing that cannot be broken into, right? All the craft is taken care of. There's other people like that that want to take down Visa and Mastercard, right? They're out there. Right.
00:24:05.664 - 00:24:16.240, Speaker A: But you're, you, what's your vision for Solana? Like, who will use it and what it will be used for? Because for you to keep talking about Visa Master was not what I was thinking.
00:24:19.010 - 00:25:06.042, Speaker D: I guess the way I see it is if we get to a number, we meaningfully have meaningful censorship resistance. Like it takes 1000, 3000 machines to be break into to censor the network. We can start moving real finance over from traditional finance down to these systems. And the early adopters are going to be folks like Serum because they're cryptocurrency traders. They already get right. But who knows, maybe Sam starts a large scale credit card company Next and starts competing directly with Visa and Mastercard because he sees the tech is there. And it's super easy for a million people in Malaysia to aggregate funds to lend to a mortgage in Francisco.
00:25:06.042 - 00:25:07.520, Speaker D: Like, I don't know. Right.
00:25:08.370 - 00:25:13.840, Speaker A: But it would be this. Okay, this is what I was confused about. Right, okay.
00:25:14.470 - 00:25:15.074, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:25:15.192 - 00:25:18.850, Speaker E: I think it's like the business model of Visa and Mastercard, like the companies.
00:25:18.920 - 00:25:24.366, Speaker C: But you replace their internal ledgers with a public decentralized ledger.
00:25:24.398 - 00:25:28.566, Speaker E: And so it's like you actually take the technology of the company and you.
00:25:28.588 - 00:25:29.730, Speaker C: Get it on chain.
00:25:29.890 - 00:25:39.514, Speaker A: Okay, now I get it because I was a little bit like, okay, now I get it. You're talking about a decentralized version of Visa or Mastercard, not the actual yes.
00:25:39.632 - 00:25:41.014, Speaker C: Okay, well, who knows?
00:25:41.062 - 00:25:44.202, Speaker D: Maybe there's some visionary product manager there.
00:25:44.336 - 00:25:45.002, Speaker C: I don't know.
00:25:45.056 - 00:25:47.290, Speaker D: Right. I don't know their organization.
00:25:48.510 - 00:26:13.010, Speaker A: This is like getting super speculative. But right now you do have this ability. I believe I've seen that you have claimed in other articles that Salana can handle 60,000 transactions per second. But I was checking the stats and right now it's about 450 or 500. So why do you think Salana hasn't yet seen more crypto projects or users migrating to Salana?
00:26:13.750 - 00:26:49.040, Speaker D: I mean, TPS is kind of like its capacity, right? That capacity is there, but people need to have a meaningful reason to go use it. It's like, why would I switch operating systems? Or why would I go from Ethereum to anything? This is kind of a bill it and they will come is a really bad way to get product market fit. Right. We have to have a meaningful reason for somebody to go do this. And with Serum, they just couldn't do it anywhere else.
00:26:49.890 - 00:27:04.900, Speaker A: Okay, so we are going to talk about Serum in a bit, but I actually first just want to dive a little bit more into Solana because you use an algorithm called proof of history, which you sort of alluded to in the abstract earlier. Can you explain what that is and how it works?
00:27:05.370 - 00:28:05.778, Speaker D: Yeah, so there's folks building these things called Verifiable delay functions. And there's some very sophisticated implementations of these that have all these complicated cryptographic trade offs. Our approach is what a bunch of hardware qualcomm folks would do, which is shot to 56 in a loop that you sample. So recursive shot to 56 because it's recursive. It's a thing that has to run on a single core single thread. And because it's running in this kind of single threaded environment, the speed of which it can run is bound by the fabrication process at a modern day fab like TSMC or intel or Global Foundries, because that process is kind of so fine tuned and exact. At this point in our state of technology, we have a very, somewhat granular, but a very good approximation of how much time it takes to generate any number of these hashes.
00:28:05.778 - 00:28:49.650, Speaker D: So we can effectively approximate time based on the number of hashes produced by this process. And for an attacker to increase that number meaningfully, they have to build a better fab. And that's a $40 billion investment. So that's kind of a very expensive proposition for somebody to try to get something that's ten times faster, something like that. So from our perspective, this is kind of like you think of proof of work and bitcoin and asics as kind of this physical bound that secures the network proof of history. It doesn't secure the network. It allows us to schedule things in a very kind of compact way where there's no gaps.
00:28:49.650 - 00:29:08.410, Speaker D: And this is what allows us to kind of scale throughput scale the number of block producers per second, like increase censorship resistance and process more transactions. So it's not a security thing, but without it to maintain a high level of security, we would have to reduce throughput.
00:29:09.390 - 00:29:13.166, Speaker A: And your block times are counted at milliseconds, right?
00:29:13.348 - 00:29:13.742, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:29:13.796 - 00:29:25.090, Speaker D: So right now the block time is 400 milliseconds. I would like to get them down to like 80 milliseconds, which is how long it takes for speed of light to go around the world through fiber.
00:29:28.310 - 00:29:52.730, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah. Well, I can understand for trading on a global market that yeah, that would be the goal. But yeah, this is obviously a huge leap in terms of block time because we start with bitcoin, it's roughly every ten minutes. Ethereum is like kind of every twelve to 15 seconds. Yeah. So this is definitely much faster.
00:29:52.730 - 00:30:19.170, Speaker A: But one other thing that I just wondered is when I was learning about this proof of history and this clock problem, as I guess it's called, I was kind of like, how is the time of a block different from a block height? Right? Because if you're thinking of time as just every single obviously the way we do time is like year, month, day, hour, minute, right?
00:30:19.240 - 00:30:19.858, Speaker C: Second.
00:30:20.024 - 00:30:38.726, Speaker A: But you can create like a unique number from that. And so in that regard, you can think of a block height as also being a unique number. So then I sort of didn't understand how is proof of history different? It just sort of seemed like a different way to describe the same thing, do you know what I mean? Which is a way to put blocks.
00:30:38.758 - 00:30:42.282, Speaker C: In chronological order so people think of.
00:30:42.336 - 00:31:08.980, Speaker D: Proof of work, the bitcoin blockchain, right? You can estimate how much time it took to build it. Right. But that estimation is using interpreting the chain as a source of time after consensus. So to give you an idea why that matters is, like, first, radio towers went up. Two towers transmit at the same time over the same frequency. You get noise, right? Because those waves interfere and information can't propagate through. Right.
00:31:08.980 - 00:32:07.762, Speaker D: You don't know what's being transmitted. So really the first optimization people tried is they gave everybody a clock that's synchronized and they can alternate by time. So how well that clock is synchronized, how low the error is between the drift and the clocks, is how fast they can alternate. So modern day cellular networks are roughly every I think the slice is like five milliseconds at this point because the clocks are so well timed and so well synchronized. So that allows you to increase the number of participants that can transmit per second. And that is exactly the same as the number of block producers that can transmit per second. Because if you look at bitcoin, right, it's got this puzzle that's designed to be solved once every ten minutes, no matter how big the network gets, because if two people solve it at the same time, you get effectively an undecided state of the chain, right? We don't know which is the actual final block.
00:32:07.762 - 00:32:53.838, Speaker D: Right? So then that's noise, that's kind of similar problem to the electromagnetic interference. So with bitcoin, the way they tried to solve it is by they increased the difficulty such that it's really extremely rare that two blocks occur at the same time. Ethereum is probably the fastest possible implementation of Proof of Work. This is like once every 10 seconds kind of thing. Our approach is to use this external point of reference as a source of time, which is the number of hashes that somebody has computed, not the actual value of the hashes. It's just like, give me a data structure that shows that you spent like 400 milliseconds somewhere spitting in a single core. Like, prove to me that you waited.
00:32:53.838 - 00:33:17.420, Speaker D: Right? And because you have to prove for 400 milliseconds and Sam has to prove for 800 milliseconds, that gives you a slice of time to transmit your block and Sam is forced to delay until your block is done. And then that reduces the number of concurrent blocks in the network and we can effectively kind of start stuffing more block producers in the same second.
00:33:19.950 - 00:33:26.414, Speaker A: Because I was going to ask you what happens if two blocks are mined at the same time, but you're just sort of saying like, that doesn't really.
00:33:26.452 - 00:33:31.822, Speaker C: Happen because everyone's yeah, so so it does happen.
00:33:31.876 - 00:33:45.346, Speaker D: And that consensus takes over just like it does in Proof of Work or PBFT or any other chain. It's just we're like all of engineering is taking the best case and doing your best, making it the average case most of the time.
00:33:45.528 - 00:34:00.780, Speaker A: Okay, so if there are two blocks that are mine at the same time, that's where your proof of stake part comes in. Is that yes. Okay, so we're going to discuss a little bit more about that in a moment. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible.

00:35:20.950 - 00:35:41.340, Speaker A: Back to my conversation with Sam and Anatole, okay, because I was doing all this research and I was like, wait, there's proof of history plus also proof of stake. I was like, what is going on? But that is the answer, is that if two blocks are mined, then the staking comes into play. Is that what happens?
00:35:41.710 - 00:36:03.410, Speaker D: So Staking is the civil resistant portion that is kind of like proof of work. Solves civil resistance with electricity because you can't use the same electricity twice, and we use proof of stake to solve the same problem. But the actual consensus algorithm is based on PBFT, which is practical Byzantine fault tolerance.
00:36:04.230 - 00:36:04.642, Speaker C: Okay?
00:36:04.696 - 00:36:07.700, Speaker A: Which I don't know what that means. Do you want to give a really quick.
00:36:12.790 - 00:36:13.490, Speaker C: Mean?
00:36:13.640 - 00:37:04.690, Speaker D: Edmund will argue that Avalanche is not PBFT in its own thing, but I think every proof of stake network at the end of the day is PBFT if it comes to any kind of finality. It's an algorithm that was discovered by Barbara Liskoff in 99, I believe, so it's fairly recent if you think about research, and it's a way to solve the N generals Byzantine generals problem. Nakamoto, the proof of work algorithm, the consensus algorithm used with proof of work in Bitcoin, is another solution to this famous N generals problem. So PBFT is a way to do it with cryptography and some way to do if you have cryptography and some civil resistance, you can kind of build these things on top of something that has good enough communication, like the Internet.
00:37:05.430 - 00:37:23.098, Speaker A: The general problem is, or the way to describe it is basically how to create cooperation amongst different people who don't know each other and do it in a way where they can kind of communicate effectively. That's sort of like my very general way of describing it.
00:37:23.264 - 00:38:13.260, Speaker D: It's a way for well, it's based on this famous problem which is called the Byzantine general or the end general's problem, where you have some number of generals and Constantinople and if all of them attack at the same time, then they win. But if some of them don't, then they lose and they're trying to send messengers between each other to coordinate when they attack. And the problem is that Constantinople can, depending how the problem is set up, they can stop the messengers or they can create their own spies that send fake messages and things like that. So how do you solve this problem under different kind of modes of attack vectors? So PBFT is one such solution, there's other solutions that have other assumptions and Nakamoto is probably know that's the most famous one.
00:38:14.030 - 00:38:57.800, Speaker A: All right, so you have this blockchain which, as we discussed, has the potential to process orders of magnitude more transactions than existing blockchains. But right now, or at least the most recent number I could find was that there's only six DApps currently on Solana. Or maybe it's a little bit more than so I know we haven't talked about serum yet, but we will in a second. But I do know that CRM is interoperable with ethereum. And I wondered in general, and this was sort of something that came up earlier in conversation with like, is that your strategy for getting more activity on your chain to try to attract DeFi developers from like, what is your playbook for getting.
00:39:02.090 - 00:39:16.542, Speaker D: Like, I think the space is still really small. If you look at the number of guess how many GitHub users have coded in Solidity, take a wild guess. It's 840.
00:39:16.676 - 00:39:17.600, Speaker A: Oh, really?
00:39:18.770 - 00:40:52.410, Speaker D: If you just do a query on GitHub, how many users have code that they submitted in Solidity, it's pretty small, really small. But that's not to say that 840 engineers like a huge engineering company, right? That's like 200 million a year in engine burn or something absurd, right? That's like a lot of people that are building stuff. So it's both small and large enough to where it's dumb to ignore Ethereum, right? Dumb to bet that something is going to grow bigger than it. And my view on this space is that with proof of stake networks and smart contract platforms, you kind of end up in this kind of fungible block space world where it doesn't matter where the transactions run, right? Doesn't matter if users with some issue token on Ethereum, whether they do the exchanges on Uniswap or do it through serum, they don't really care. All they care about is that they have token A, they got token B at some price, right? Or they have both token A and token B and now they're providing liquidity and earning a yield or something like that. They just want to interface with crypto systems, right? They don't really care about Ethereum unless they're maximalists which is fine because you got to build your tribe, right? But at the end of the day, the users don't want to trade. It's not going to be really important to them where those orders execute.
00:40:52.410 - 00:41:04.110, Speaker D: So all we need to do is kind of build some cryptographic certainty about that execution and route it through from ethereum to serum and somewhere else and back to ethereum.
00:41:05.090 - 00:41:15.758, Speaker A: Okay, it sounds like I was right that the reason that you made serum interoperable is like, that's kind of your strategy of forgetting activity.
00:41:15.934 - 00:41:20.134, Speaker C: It's a big onboarding thing. Like right now, everyone has MetaMask and.
00:41:20.172 - 00:41:31.802, Speaker E: No one has SoulFlare. SoulFlare is like one of the most common solana wallets or solid or one of these, but not everyone has it, obviously. But in DeFi, at least everyone has MetaMask. And so a lot of this question.
00:41:31.856 - 00:41:34.746, Speaker C: Is, know, what does interoperable mean?
00:41:34.768 - 00:41:36.346, Speaker E: There's a lot of different layers of.
00:41:36.448 - 00:41:39.194, Speaker C: Like step one is you start with.
00:41:39.232 - 00:41:43.258, Speaker E: Some ethereum in your MetaMask wallet and somehow you have to end up using.
00:41:43.424 - 00:41:48.122, Speaker C: This new, you know, making use of it somehow.
00:41:48.266 - 00:41:50.606, Speaker E: And maybe eventually everyone's got solana and.
00:41:50.628 - 00:41:53.070, Speaker C: Everyone'S got SPL tokens in their wallet.
00:41:53.150 - 00:41:55.506, Speaker E: And then this is no longer a.
00:41:55.528 - 00:41:59.700, Speaker C: Crucial step, but at step zero, no one has them.
00:42:01.190 - 00:42:05.490, Speaker A: And are you trying to get SPL tokens used in MetaMask?
00:42:05.990 - 00:42:07.742, Speaker E: Well, there's a lot of different approaches.
00:42:07.806 - 00:42:10.626, Speaker C: And we would certainly be super thrilled.
00:42:10.658 - 00:42:28.518, Speaker E: For MetaMask to support that'd be really amazing. There are other things you can do, too, though, where you can build your own applications that can interface with MetaMask and can utilize the ethereum that you have on it, which is what it's doing right now. So right now, the kind of first bridge that came out, it's a solana.
00:42:28.534 - 00:42:33.280, Speaker C: Based wallet, solid, but that you can hook up to your MetaMask account and have them talk to each other.
00:42:33.810 - 00:43:04.150, Speaker A: Okay, yeah. So why don't we just talk a little bit more about serum? So when people go on there, what will their experience be and who are you trying to target? Because serum is more like a central order book type of experience rather than these automated market makers that have become very popular in DeFi. So does that mean that you'll attract a different type of trader or are you trying to attract the DeFi traders?
00:43:06.890 - 00:43:10.280, Speaker C: It's a good question. And the long answer.
00:43:12.590 - 00:43:18.586, Speaker E: Long vision for this ultimately is sort of everything. Ultimately, the answer, as Anatoly said, is.
00:43:18.608 - 00:43:24.986, Speaker C: Like, can you get a significant fraction of DeFi and crypto and the world's.
00:43:25.018 - 00:43:29.550, Speaker E: Financial ecosystem, maybe the world's technological ecosystem happening on chain?
00:43:30.210 - 00:43:34.158, Speaker C: You can think pretty big here, but if you sort of then zoom in.
00:43:34.164 - 00:43:43.906, Speaker E: And say, all right, well, sure. What are the first steps? I think that the first thing that was sort of launched on serum was a central limit order book. So it sort of looks like a.
00:43:43.928 - 00:43:49.094, Speaker C: Centralized exchange, except that it's not. It's on chain. And I do think that that does.
00:43:49.132 - 00:43:52.546, Speaker E: Attract a slightly different crowd of people. It tends to attract people who trade.
00:43:52.578 - 00:43:57.946, Speaker C: Significant volume and are looking for significant liquidity as opposed to people who are.
00:43:57.968 - 00:44:00.006, Speaker E: Looking to stake or to get yield.
00:44:00.198 - 00:44:11.446, Speaker C: Or to put seed liquidity for their illiquid token and not have to think about it. I think it is like a different crowd.
00:44:11.478 - 00:44:12.634, Speaker E: And I think the reason we started.
00:44:12.672 - 00:44:15.918, Speaker C: With that is that it was like A, I think it's one of the.
00:44:15.924 - 00:44:18.574, Speaker E: Most powerful things like if you look at where volume is in crypto, like.
00:44:18.612 - 00:44:28.674, Speaker C: 90% of it's on central limit order books. But B it's sort of a proof of a proof that this can do cool things.
00:44:28.792 - 00:44:30.226, Speaker E: It's like here's a thing that you.
00:44:30.248 - 00:44:45.606, Speaker C: Can'T do on most other chains and it's done, it's here and it works and it's sort of like a really good first product from that stance of being valuable useful and really demonstrating what can be done but sort of going.
00:44:45.628 - 00:44:47.506, Speaker E: Forward, the next things that are going to be released.
00:44:47.618 - 00:44:49.014, Speaker C: I mean, a lot of people are.
00:44:49.052 - 00:44:50.118, Speaker E: Working on things, but the ones that.
00:44:50.124 - 00:44:54.218, Speaker C: I'm aware of that are like the closest to coming out are going to.
00:44:54.224 - 00:44:55.514, Speaker E: Be a lot of things that allow.
00:44:55.552 - 00:45:08.186, Speaker C: You to build the pieces that are in the current ethereum DeFi ecosystem on Solana and on Serum. And so the answer is pretty soon it'll have both, it'll have central limit.
00:45:08.218 - 00:45:10.474, Speaker E: Order books, it'll have AMMS, it'll borrow.
00:45:10.522 - 00:45:13.230, Speaker C: Lending, it'll sort of span both the.
00:45:13.300 - 00:45:14.634, Speaker E: Things you would see on a centralized.
00:45:14.682 - 00:45:20.946, Speaker C: Exchange and the things you see in ethereum based DeFi. But they're all on chain, which means.
00:45:20.968 - 00:45:24.594, Speaker E: They'Re also all composable and interoperable. And so you can do things like.
00:45:24.632 - 00:45:28.754, Speaker C: Take your AMM and have know instead.
00:45:28.792 - 00:45:35.046, Speaker E: Of trading against it directly, you could trade against it through an order book if you wanted. Like the AMM can literally itself go.
00:45:35.068 - 00:45:36.678, Speaker C: Provide on an order book or you.
00:45:36.684 - 00:45:39.926, Speaker E: Can take your borrow lending protocol and give either the order book or the.
00:45:39.948 - 00:45:42.554, Speaker C: AMM or both at once leverage by.
00:45:42.592 - 00:45:52.014, Speaker E: Composing them on top of each other. And so all of these things grow even more powerful for having the other ones there. And I think over the next month most of the things I just talked.
00:45:52.052 - 00:45:55.390, Speaker C: About are going to be live in the ecosystem.
00:45:56.210 - 00:46:45.600, Speaker A: Okay, so now I understand because I guess I thought that Project Serum was just this one order book exchange. But then earlier in the beginning of the show you called it an ecosystem and I thought why is he calling an ecosystem? Because you're launching these AMMS or a lending protocol or whatever these other kind of DeFi like things but within serum. Oh, interesting. Well, one thing just to go back to what I was asking in terms of the type of person who would use Project Serum, I saw that high frequency trading firm jump trading is going to do market making on Project Serum and I wondered how did that deal come together? They're first of all a veteran of market making but they also have this investment arm that's active in crypto and I just wondered did you reach out to them or did they reach out to you and what was the appeal for them?
00:46:45.970 - 00:46:48.974, Speaker E: Yeah, we sort of had conversations about.
00:46:49.012 - 00:46:56.194, Speaker C: Things related to crypto over the last couple of years. We got back in contact around this.
00:46:56.232 - 00:46:57.666, Speaker E: And I think basically we had a.
00:46:57.688 - 00:47:05.294, Speaker C: Similar vision and I think we both had the vision of thinking about what's the biggest thing and the highest upside.
00:47:05.342 - 00:47:06.838, Speaker E: Thing you can build as opposed to.
00:47:06.844 - 00:47:19.386, Speaker C: What'S the next step from where we are? And that points you in a very different direction because if your goal is to get lower cost AMMS right, then.
00:47:19.408 - 00:47:21.046, Speaker E: You'Re like, we just need another factor.
00:47:21.078 - 00:47:24.410, Speaker C: Of 20 in throughput or in lower.
00:47:24.480 - 00:47:26.860, Speaker E: Cost and that'll be fine.
00:47:27.790 - 00:47:29.946, Speaker C: Whereas if you're saying like, all right.
00:47:29.968 - 00:47:36.346, Speaker E: So step like three out of five is going to be trying to get capacity for a third of the world's.
00:47:36.378 - 00:47:44.318, Speaker C: Financial ecosystem potentially to be on the ecosystem. All of a sudden that factor of 30 isn't looking so good.
00:47:44.484 - 00:47:49.486, Speaker E: It's like a factor of 3 million. It's like just orders of magnitude upon.
00:47:49.518 - 00:47:52.562, Speaker C: Orders of magnitude bigger what you're demanding here.
00:47:52.696 - 00:47:55.778, Speaker E: And sure, that's sort of like a ridiculously lofty goal, although I think it.
00:47:55.784 - 00:48:00.006, Speaker C: Is a real reach goal. But you don't have to have that.
00:48:00.028 - 00:48:03.094, Speaker E: Lofty of a goal if literally your entire goal is to have a well.
00:48:03.132 - 00:48:05.858, Speaker C: Functioning, efficient order book with a matching.
00:48:05.874 - 00:48:12.106, Speaker E: Engine on chain that alone prices out almost every chain in crypto. A single serum order book right now.
00:48:12.208 - 00:48:14.458, Speaker C: Is using way more throughput than the.
00:48:14.464 - 00:48:21.594, Speaker E: Entire Ethereum network is. And so we sort of had both had the same thought of like, you.
00:48:21.632 - 00:48:24.942, Speaker C: Can'T go moderately big and still expect.
00:48:24.996 - 00:48:25.882, Speaker E: This to be scalable.
00:48:25.946 - 00:48:28.222, Speaker C: You need to go really big.
00:48:28.276 - 00:48:30.282, Speaker E: You need to really care about scalability.
00:48:30.426 - 00:48:31.630, Speaker C: And you need to have the product.
00:48:31.700 - 00:48:34.838, Speaker E: Vision to get there. And you need to have the resources.
00:48:34.874 - 00:48:38.114, Speaker C: And wherewithal and knowledge and partners to.
00:48:38.152 - 00:48:40.338, Speaker E: Have a plausible shot at building out.
00:48:40.504 - 00:48:48.086, Speaker C: So much of this. And then to go to something. Both you and Anatoly have echoed almost every chain other than Ethereum's a ghost town right now.
00:48:48.108 - 00:48:58.214, Speaker E: I mean, it's sort of like a relative statement except for Bitcoin. Except for Bitcoin. Well, it's interesting. Bitcoin itself, there's not much built on.
00:48:58.252 - 00:49:00.858, Speaker C: Top of Bitcoin, but Bitcoin itself, the.
00:49:00.864 - 00:49:15.134, Speaker E: Chain is obviously the biggest by far. Yeah, but in terms of smart contract platforms, in terms of platforms or the goals for other people to build applications that run on it, everything's on Ethereum tron is number two with probably 1%.
00:49:15.172 - 00:49:17.518, Speaker C: Of Ethereum or 5% maybe.
00:49:17.604 - 00:49:20.446, Speaker E: And then the one after that is going to have like 5% of that.
00:49:20.468 - 00:49:28.018, Speaker C: And it's just like there's nothing and so team after team has failed and it sort of has demonstrated that doing something isn't enough.
00:49:28.104 - 00:49:32.926, Speaker E: You need to build something so cool and so impressive and powerful without requiring.
00:49:33.038 - 00:49:35.538, Speaker C: First having everyone move over that you.
00:49:35.544 - 00:49:40.040, Speaker E: Can create a compelling enough pitch that someone's going to bother trying it in the first place.
00:49:40.490 - 00:49:41.880, Speaker C: That's a high bar.
00:49:42.490 - 00:50:22.962, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, a couple of things that I wanted to ask, first of all, because I wasn't totally sure about this, so I'm assuming that your decks will handle non ethereum assets as well. And so I just wondered, when people trade tokens from different chains that have different consensus mechanisms, different block times, different levels of finality, how do you guys handle that? I also wanted to try to place this in the kind of world of polka dot versus cosmos. It sounds like this is also a potential solution to that interoperability issue that they're trying to tackle, right?
00:50:23.016 - 00:50:26.646, Speaker E: So it's a really good question and there's basically two ways that you can.
00:50:26.668 - 00:50:30.034, Speaker C: Try and think of this and two sort of paradigms.
00:50:30.082 - 00:50:41.286, Speaker E: And one paradigm is a cross chain swap where the order book is literally listing a bitcoin. Or let's get rid of like bitcoin is a little funky, but it's listing.
00:50:41.398 - 00:50:51.130, Speaker C: USDC against dot token on ethereum versus polka dot.
00:50:51.630 - 00:50:56.394, Speaker E: And it needs to transact those two when two people trade.
00:50:56.522 - 00:50:58.894, Speaker C: And there's a lot of ways to.
00:50:58.932 - 00:51:00.366, Speaker E: Try and settle this, but as you.
00:51:00.388 - 00:51:06.346, Speaker C: Say, it's a little bit nasty, right? Like you have to deeply understand both consensus protocols.
00:51:06.378 - 00:51:08.514, Speaker E: It's only going to be as fast as the slower of them.
00:51:08.552 - 00:51:15.086, Speaker C: Certainly you're not going to be able to settle this till both have settled. So if one side's bitcoin, then it's.
00:51:15.118 - 00:51:18.966, Speaker E: Going to take half an hour to settle anything here. And you need to build in these.
00:51:18.988 - 00:51:23.766, Speaker C: Really complicated processes to deal with the fact that none of these things can.
00:51:23.788 - 00:51:25.222, Speaker E: Natively talk to each other.
00:51:25.356 - 00:51:29.350, Speaker C: And so how do you know if someone delivered?
00:51:30.650 - 00:51:32.938, Speaker E: How do you make sure that's not like one person sends their friends and.
00:51:32.944 - 00:51:35.194, Speaker C: The other one just never does and.
00:51:35.392 - 00:51:47.566, Speaker E: You can do it, but it is nasty. This is sort of what layers two do. A lot of building a layer two is sort of solving this problem in a very specific instance of like your kind of customized, semi centralized layer two.
00:51:47.668 - 00:51:50.170, Speaker C: Versus ethereum, often only in one direction.
00:51:50.250 - 00:51:52.670, Speaker E: But you can generalize that it is doable.
00:51:53.650 - 00:51:57.758, Speaker C: It's extremely finicky, the pseudocode specs for.
00:51:57.764 - 00:52:01.298, Speaker E: This, it's like a ten page document and we didn't even cover all the.
00:52:01.384 - 00:52:02.786, Speaker C: There are some cases where like this.
00:52:02.808 - 00:52:05.726, Speaker E: Edge case, we solved it, we're not even going to write it down here. It's too annoying.
00:52:05.838 - 00:52:08.434, Speaker C: And you have to think of everything, right?
00:52:08.472 - 00:52:13.478, Speaker E: You're like every edge case of every chain and you can do it. You can do it.
00:52:13.484 - 00:52:15.030, Speaker C: But it is like really annoying.
00:52:15.530 - 00:52:20.300, Speaker A: I was thinking, how are they going? I was just like, sounds like so much work.
00:52:20.830 - 00:52:30.138, Speaker D: Exchanges do this exchanges do this like every day, right? They accept dots and they issue bitcoin and people are able they run, right? Most of the time.
00:52:30.224 - 00:52:36.174, Speaker E: Well, most of the time is the whole thing, right? It's actually really easy to do this if it only needs to work like.
00:52:36.212 - 00:52:40.922, Speaker C: 98% of the time, right? Because you just build a node on both chains.
00:52:40.986 - 00:52:49.186, Speaker E: The problem, of course, is what's it mean if one fucks up or lies. How do you deal with that? In a decentralized permissionless way.
00:52:49.208 - 00:52:54.466, Speaker C: And that's like with centralized exchanges, there's this kind of wild card you can.
00:52:54.488 - 00:52:57.074, Speaker E: Play, which is like, all right, no longer decentralized. We're going to have a human go.
00:52:57.112 - 00:52:59.990, Speaker C: Look at it and figure out what happened and fix it.
00:53:00.060 - 00:53:18.826, Speaker E: And with FTX, we have to do this every day, like 20 times a day. Some transaction will run into some weird error. We're like halfway through ran out of gas in some non usual way and so it gets canceled, but in a way that our automated systems didn't predict. And we just get this alert, like something's weird here.
00:53:18.928 - 00:53:20.106, Speaker C: I can try and take guess, but.
00:53:20.128 - 00:53:28.990, Speaker E: I might not get it right. Like humans go look at this and make sure the right thing happens. And that's the thing that's really hard to do with a Dex. Like the whole point of a Dex is not to have that.
00:53:29.140 - 00:53:30.446, Speaker C: So you can do it, but you.
00:53:30.468 - 00:53:32.862, Speaker E: Have to automate every single edge case.
00:53:32.916 - 00:53:35.534, Speaker C: So, okay, taking a step back, this.
00:53:35.572 - 00:53:36.810, Speaker E: Is something we're aiming for, but this.
00:53:36.820 - 00:53:39.362, Speaker C: Is like a many months project and.
00:53:39.416 - 00:53:41.218, Speaker E: Many months just to get two specific.
00:53:41.304 - 00:53:44.466, Speaker C: Chains to work with each other. And every time you need to add.
00:53:44.488 - 00:53:46.502, Speaker E: A new chain, there's like another month.
00:53:46.636 - 00:53:50.790, Speaker C: Of ironing out that chain. There's another way to do this though.
00:53:50.940 - 00:53:56.354, Speaker E: Which is more modularized, where instead of having the order book trade an ERC.
00:53:56.402 - 00:54:02.454, Speaker C: 20 USDC against a polka dot dot token, you can have bridges.
00:54:02.582 - 00:54:09.402, Speaker E: And so one thing you can imagine this instead is there's this salana serum ecosystem. On salana, you draw a circle around.
00:54:09.456 - 00:54:11.434, Speaker C: It and in order to enter it.
00:54:11.552 - 00:54:13.562, Speaker E: There'S like a wrapping process that happens.
00:54:13.616 - 00:54:16.026, Speaker C: There where you send in your ERC.
00:54:16.058 - 00:54:43.846, Speaker E: 20 token and you wrap it into an SPL token, which is a salana token that's like fungible one to one with it. And then the dex itself is just trading all these wrappers against each other. Yeah, it lets you kind of separate these processes and it means that the entire matching engine is independent. Each step on understanding three blockchains. And this takes a lot of the pressure off of the system. So the thing that we have right now is just like, there's one bridge which is live, and there's more which are going to be coming live soon.
00:54:43.948 - 00:54:49.420, Speaker C: Which are just like a way to wrap and unwrap tokens on them.
00:54:50.110 - 00:55:03.866, Speaker A: Okay, so you keep saying wrap but for wrapped bitcoin on ethereum, that's using a trusted third party provider to do that. But are you saying this will be done via smart contract in a trustless manner?
00:55:04.058 - 00:55:04.414, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:55:04.452 - 00:55:09.246, Speaker E: And now you get to what exactly trustless means. And sort of the real answer here.
00:55:09.268 - 00:55:11.466, Speaker C: Is that it's not a binary, it's.
00:55:11.498 - 00:55:12.666, Speaker E: Sort of a spectrum.
00:55:12.778 - 00:55:16.334, Speaker C: And a lot of the things that sort of present themselves as such, there's.
00:55:16.382 - 00:55:20.418, Speaker E: Somewhere on the spectrum, right, and WBTC is sort of generally known to be.
00:55:20.424 - 00:55:28.898, Speaker C: On the centralized end of this, where it's just a custodian it's BitCo. Then you have things like renBTC TBTC.
00:55:29.074 - 00:55:33.880, Speaker E: Which are various sort of like more decentralized ways of doing this.
00:55:34.650 - 00:55:51.206, Speaker C: You can imagine close to one end, if you have all of the validators of a blockchain validating these cross chain transactions, then they're sort of validated with the full weight of the consensus. And so one thing you can do, right, is if you take two chains.
00:55:51.238 - 00:55:54.494, Speaker E: And you get every validator or a block producer or whatever they use on.
00:55:54.532 - 00:56:04.510, Speaker C: Each side to be with sort of the same consensus threshold to be validating that this swapping is happening, then that's like pretty decentralized.
00:56:04.850 - 00:56:09.394, Speaker E: That's even more decentralized than just getting like 10,000 friends and strangers together and.
00:56:09.432 - 00:56:11.058, Speaker C: Having them vote, which is what a.
00:56:11.064 - 00:56:16.718, Speaker E: Lot of these things, it's sort of a lot of magic in the middle, but basics like decentralized but not trustless.
00:56:16.894 - 00:56:19.346, Speaker C: You have to trust you don't rely.
00:56:19.378 - 00:56:25.734, Speaker E: On one person, you have to trust that most of 10,000 people are sort of honest. On the far end, there's something even.
00:56:25.772 - 00:56:30.966, Speaker C: Stronger you can do, which is sort of the most trustless version, where you're.
00:56:30.998 - 00:56:35.142, Speaker E: Actually running light clients, which is to say, you pre program into each blockchain.
00:56:35.206 - 00:56:39.574, Speaker C: Exactly how the other blockchain works so that you can feed them raw blockchain.
00:56:39.622 - 00:56:45.326, Speaker E: Data and they can figure out what's going on. The on chain program does. And so you don't have to have.
00:56:45.348 - 00:56:47.758, Speaker C: People voting on what happened in the.
00:56:47.764 - 00:56:52.538, Speaker E: Blockchain, it's sort of pre programmed. But then again, you have to think very hard about what happens if there's.
00:56:52.554 - 00:56:57.458, Speaker C: Like a fork that this program didn't anticipate. And so that's sort of like as.
00:56:57.464 - 00:56:59.906, Speaker E: Far as you can get here. And yeah, there's just sort of this.
00:56:59.928 - 00:57:07.894, Speaker C: Spectrum of these bridges and I think that the sort of standard first place to start is like a multisig rather.
00:57:07.932 - 00:57:09.570, Speaker E: Than like a BitCo custodian.
00:57:09.650 - 00:57:14.822, Speaker C: You have a group of people who are multisig that are sort of like.
00:57:14.876 - 00:57:25.418, Speaker E: Validating each running nodes and validating that the swaps are happening correctly and that's one version of a thing that you can do. Anatoly also actually has more information, I.
00:57:25.424 - 00:57:28.826, Speaker C: Think, on the most recent state of some of these bridges than I do.
00:57:29.008 - 00:57:30.206, Speaker E: So I'm going off of like two.
00:57:30.228 - 00:57:32.206, Speaker C: Month old information about what was going.
00:57:32.228 - 00:58:45.300, Speaker D: To be rolled out when Sam basically nailed. Like, the way I think about it is effectively like custody. And you have a spectrum of centralized custody, like wrap BTC or what you deposit into an exchange, and it gives you a virtual token on their exchange to trade with to something that's like in the middle where it's like TBTC, like run. And then you have something farther to the right of decentralization, like proof of stake networks where you have finality that's controlled by some set of validators that are signing things. So imagine these validators all colluded and manufactured fake headers. That's no different than any custodian, right? Kind of like running away with the funds that you've trusted them. So this kind of spectrum of decentralized custody goes all the way to full blockchains, like clients running inside each other and Cosmos like, as you mentioned, their SPAC IBC kind of covers all the corner cases of what happens if chain one forks or both forks at the same, like who actually gets what.
00:58:45.300 - 00:59:28.866, Speaker D: And fundamentally, I think the interesting thing there is that the combination of these methods are probably what's going to be used by consumers when a user deposits something like, hey, I want to bridge urine from ethereum to solana and trade it on serum. They can do the deposit against the litecoin and somebody could basically run it through a multi SIG and issue them the token and take the slow path for a fee, right? They basically, okay, I'll wait for full finality for 1% for you. But you can go trade urine right.
00:59:28.888 - 00:59:29.460, Speaker C: Now.
00:59:31.830 - 01:00:02.560, Speaker D: Because as soon as you have risk, right, if you have opportunity for risk and speed and finance, there's opportunity to make yield there and somebody will take the other side of that. So users actually will probably be able to always kind of see a fast path. And underneath behind all this is like, how do we reduce settlement risk? How do we make this more decentralized, more censorship resistant? That's almost like all backend work that users are really unlikely at the end of the day to deal with.
01:00:03.170 - 01:00:15.346, Speaker A: Okay, this is really interesting. So something else I wanted to ask about was serum has two tokens, SRM and MsRM. And why don't you just describe what the purpose is for each?
01:00:15.528 - 01:00:22.158, Speaker C: Yeah, so serum is sort of the fundamental one and for most things you can sort of ignore MsRM.
01:00:22.254 - 01:00:27.386, Speaker E: So serum is what does it do? The first answer is it's a governance.
01:00:27.438 - 01:00:38.726, Speaker C: Token and so it can vote itself to do more things, but currently what's it do? So first of all, 100% of all, the revenue from serum, from all the.
01:00:38.748 - 01:00:42.806, Speaker E: Projects on serum, they go to the serum token. And so what this means like exchange.
01:00:42.838 - 01:00:48.246, Speaker C: Fees go to serum, whether it's through a buy and burn, whether it's through yield.
01:00:48.438 - 01:00:51.398, Speaker E: And that's again, it's sort of like up to the serum tokens to decide.
01:00:51.494 - 01:00:57.422, Speaker C: How they want that. So they sort of control all of that and gain from all of that.
01:00:57.556 - 01:00:59.806, Speaker E: They also are the governance and so.
01:00:59.828 - 01:01:02.106, Speaker C: They can vote to change fee rates.
01:01:02.138 - 01:01:04.654, Speaker E: And things like that. And then the other thing that they.
01:01:04.692 - 01:01:07.090, Speaker C: Do is there's a staking system and a node system.
01:01:07.240 - 01:01:09.426, Speaker E: And the nodes basically manage a lot.
01:01:09.448 - 01:01:30.854, Speaker C: Of the processes that go on on serum. And so in particular, you can get some extra Oomph out of on chain stuff if you're able to have people staring at it and poking at and what does that know? I'll give an example. So all of the borrow lending protocols on Ethereum, how do they deal with liquidations?
01:01:30.982 - 01:01:32.534, Speaker E: Let's say someone's about to go bankrupt.
01:01:32.582 - 01:01:33.418, Speaker C: What happens?
01:01:33.584 - 01:01:42.506, Speaker A: There's like keepers that kind of find something that looks like it's kind of running under the collateralization ratio or something. Is that what you're talking about?
01:01:42.608 - 01:01:53.262, Speaker E: Yeah, it's sort of like that blockchains aren't very good at. They sort of just keep sitting there doing what they're doing. The natural way to have mechanics, something like liquidation, which is what most people.
01:01:53.316 - 01:01:56.446, Speaker C: Do, is at any point anyone can.
01:01:56.468 - 01:01:58.306, Speaker E: Try and liquidate someone. So I could see your account and.
01:01:58.328 - 01:02:04.798, Speaker C: I'd be like, oh man, there's Laura account, laura's account. I'm going to try and liquidate, you know, type know, I send a command.
01:02:04.814 - 01:02:09.806, Speaker E: She'S like, liquidate Laura. And the borrower lending protocol is like, no, fuck you, Sam. She's nowhere near her margin limits.
01:02:09.838 - 01:02:11.926, Speaker C: Like, obviously she can't be liquidated and.
01:02:11.948 - 01:02:15.334, Speaker E: She'S like, whenever I send that command, it goes and tests. But if you are in fact below.
01:02:15.372 - 01:02:17.158, Speaker C: Your margin limits and I send the.
01:02:17.164 - 01:02:18.982, Speaker E: Liquidate command, then it liquidates you.
01:02:19.116 - 01:02:20.854, Speaker C: And what's it mean to liquidate you?
01:02:20.972 - 01:02:23.674, Speaker E: Well, somehow it has to deal with this fact that you've got all these.
01:02:23.712 - 01:02:32.586, Speaker C: Positions and assets and stuff and you got to go somewhere. So what it actually means to liquidate someone is you volunteer to take them. And so it actually happens, like I.
01:02:32.608 - 01:02:43.086, Speaker E: Claim Laura is like below margin limits and I'm going to take her portfolio on and I send that to the blockchain. It validates it. And that's an example of an external actor who comes in to help the.
01:02:43.108 - 01:02:52.370, Speaker C: System in a way where they can't sort of do anything terrible because the blockchain coaches won't let them liquidate someone if they're not below margin.
01:02:52.950 - 01:02:57.746, Speaker E: But there's a function that needs to be filled and relies on someone like that. That in particular is actually quite an.
01:02:57.768 - 01:02:59.478, Speaker C: Intense and scary thing to put on.
01:02:59.484 - 01:03:04.070, Speaker E: Someone'S shoulders because they might be taking on a huge position. But there's a lot of sort of.
01:03:04.140 - 01:03:06.790, Speaker C: Less scary versions of that that are.
01:03:06.860 - 01:03:09.298, Speaker E: Important for maintenance of stuff on ceramics.
01:03:09.314 - 01:03:14.090, Speaker C: So to give some examples, one of them is there are certain times when.
01:03:14.240 - 01:03:22.010, Speaker E: Some sort of queue is filling up. There's some data structure is like a queue of all the trades that have happened recently or something.
01:03:22.160 - 01:03:27.770, Speaker C: And you need to clear that out periodically or else the decks just halts.
01:03:27.850 - 01:03:32.782, Speaker E: It's like, all right, we're out of space. There's nowhere for me to write this. It's like sitting there pleading with someone.
01:03:32.836 - 01:03:35.506, Speaker C: To realize that happened and clear out.
01:03:35.528 - 01:03:38.098, Speaker E: This buffer and as soon as someone does, just starts running again.
01:03:38.184 - 01:03:44.754, Speaker C: And so that's sort of an example of a node duty on serum is.
01:03:44.792 - 01:03:50.326, Speaker E: Like watching for all these things and taking care of them when they need to be taken care of. And what they share in common is.
01:03:50.348 - 01:03:52.566, Speaker C: That you can't steal anyone's money this way.
01:03:52.588 - 01:03:54.646, Speaker E: It's not like giving a superpower to.
01:03:54.668 - 01:04:03.114, Speaker C: These nodes that lets them screw anything up. It's just like a task that needs to be done and waiting for someone to do it.
01:04:03.232 - 01:04:06.826, Speaker E: That's one example of it. And basically it's serum holders who are.
01:04:06.848 - 01:04:08.506, Speaker C: Staking to these nodes which are then.
01:04:08.528 - 01:04:15.166, Speaker E: Performing these on chain duties. And another thing you could think about is like validating cross chain transactions for a lot of these bridges, like, who.
01:04:15.188 - 01:04:19.760, Speaker C: Are natural people to be validating that swap happen.
01:04:20.290 - 01:04:24.734, Speaker E: Like the Solana validators is one answer and serum nodes is another.
01:04:24.932 - 01:04:26.494, Speaker C: Okay, so that's sort of serum, it's.
01:04:26.542 - 01:04:30.834, Speaker E: Basically like economic gain from everything that happens on serum, governance of it, and.
01:04:30.872 - 01:04:34.610, Speaker C: Then staking for maintenance of it, plus whatever else people do with it.
01:04:34.680 - 01:04:39.794, Speaker E: I haven't yet gotten to Megaserium, but that's sort of like that's background.
01:04:39.922 - 01:04:41.682, Speaker C: So okay, what is megaserum?
01:04:41.746 - 01:04:48.600, Speaker E: So MsRM, which is Megacerium, is I think, a super cute thing. I'm really happy with it.
01:04:49.050 - 01:04:51.026, Speaker C: It's a wrapper on a million serum.
01:04:51.138 - 01:04:53.562, Speaker E: So you can take a Megaserum and just crack it open, get a million.
01:04:53.616 - 01:05:01.834, Speaker C: Serum out and take a million serum. You can wrap them together and get a mega serum. So far it seems kind of stupid, like who cares? Oh, here's why you care.
01:05:01.872 - 01:05:02.814, Speaker E: First of all, it's a little bit.
01:05:02.852 - 01:05:05.120, Speaker C: Better than a million serum. So.
01:05:07.250 - 01:05:09.098, Speaker E: You get fee discounts for holding.
01:05:09.114 - 01:05:10.686, Speaker C: Serum when you trade, you get like.
01:05:10.708 - 01:05:12.218, Speaker E: Bigger fee discounts for having a mega.
01:05:12.234 - 01:05:13.914, Speaker C: Serum than you do for a million serum.
01:05:14.042 - 01:05:15.726, Speaker E: And in all of these various ways.
01:05:15.748 - 01:05:18.286, Speaker C: You get like little bonuses for having a Mega serum.
01:05:18.318 - 01:05:20.078, Speaker E: And in addition, each of the nodes.
01:05:20.174 - 01:05:26.594, Speaker C: Which is like voting and managing these processes, in order to form it, it has to have a mega serum staking to it.
01:05:26.792 - 01:05:31.526, Speaker E: So you can stake to it with just serum. Like you can collect a lot of people with that, but at least one.
01:05:31.548 - 01:05:35.446, Speaker C: Person has to activate it by staking their mega serum to it.
01:05:35.628 - 01:05:37.014, Speaker E: Now you're like, okay, this is still.
01:05:37.052 - 01:05:40.920, Speaker C: Stupid because everyone just obviously creates Megaserium because it's better.
01:05:41.370 - 01:05:43.818, Speaker E: And now you get to the second core part of a Mega serum, which.
01:05:43.824 - 01:05:44.934, Speaker C: Is that they're scarce.
01:05:45.062 - 01:05:50.566, Speaker E: There can only be 1000 Megaserum in the world ever, which could only soak.
01:05:50.598 - 01:05:51.898, Speaker C: Up 10% of the serum.
01:05:51.994 - 01:05:59.280, Speaker E: And so basically what they are, they're almost like NFT, like in a way they're fungible within 1000 of them, but.
01:05:59.970 - 01:06:05.362, Speaker C: It'S like a sort of wrap around a million serum that's a bit better.
01:06:05.416 - 01:06:10.210, Speaker E: And allows you to activate a node, but they're scarce.
01:06:10.710 - 01:06:13.746, Speaker C: It's not that everyone can do them. And you can trade these.
01:06:13.768 - 01:06:15.234, Speaker E: And so if you're just looking to.
01:06:15.352 - 01:06:17.378, Speaker C: Have some serum in your wallet because.
01:06:17.464 - 01:06:19.346, Speaker E: You'Re buying it and selling a lot.
01:06:19.528 - 01:06:26.326, Speaker C: You'D just stick with serum. If you ever got to make a serum, you'd probably sell it. And the reason you'd sell it is you sell someone who would probably be.
01:06:26.348 - 01:06:27.414, Speaker E: Willing to pay more than a million.
01:06:27.452 - 01:06:29.366, Speaker C: Serum for it because they really want.
01:06:29.388 - 01:06:32.986, Speaker E: To be able to activate their node. And you can only do that with.
01:06:33.008 - 01:06:38.394, Speaker C: One of these and the world's out of them. That's basically what a mega serum is.
01:06:38.512 - 01:06:51.710, Speaker A: Yeah, it's like flying business class or something. It's like limited number of seats, but you get these extra perks. I don't play video games, but I imagine like some kind of special video game level that you can achieve.
01:06:52.610 - 01:07:04.878, Speaker E: Exactly. And it's like in practice is sort of a thing where if you're like a really core member of the serum ecosystem and want to do a lot of stuff there. Most of them are very excited to have a mega serum because it allows you to do more stuff, whereas you're just sort of like coming in and.
01:07:04.884 - 01:07:08.066, Speaker C: Out, doing some trades sometimes and trading.
01:07:08.098 - 01:07:09.990, Speaker E: For serum, for profit, back and forth.
01:07:10.890 - 01:07:15.880, Speaker C: You sort of wouldn't bother getting the long term gold chart or whatever.
01:07:16.970 - 01:07:37.550, Speaker A: All right, so we've covered, I think, pretty much most of the aspects of solana and serum. But I just did wonder, going forward, what are kind of the next milestones and what are some of the new things that we should be watching you guys for in terms of what you'll be rolling out?
01:07:37.700 - 01:07:38.014, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:07:38.052 - 01:07:48.654, Speaker E: So on the serum end, I mean, a lot of people are building things and we'll see what comes through. I'm super excited for a lot of them. There are also some which I can't say yet, but I'm super excited about the two things that I'm most excited.
01:07:48.702 - 01:07:50.146, Speaker C: About that are going to be coming.
01:07:50.168 - 01:07:52.370, Speaker E: Out soon, which are going to just unlock so much.
01:07:52.520 - 01:07:54.126, Speaker C: One of them is a borrow lending.
01:07:54.158 - 01:07:56.466, Speaker E: Protocol and a bunch of people are working on those and sometime in the.
01:07:56.488 - 01:08:00.086, Speaker C: Next month, one's going to go live and that's going to enable borrowing and.
01:08:00.108 - 01:08:02.118, Speaker E: Lending, but also margin and futures and.
01:08:02.204 - 01:08:19.946, Speaker C: Leverage and everything like that because you can just compose it with anything. The other thing, which is the more unique thing is a thing called pools, which are going to be coming out in the next week. And a pool is a really cool kind of primitive structure and it's sort.
01:08:19.968 - 01:08:22.282, Speaker E: Of the common element between an AMM.
01:08:22.346 - 01:08:26.206, Speaker C: Wrapping, staking, borrow lending and a ton.
01:08:26.228 - 01:08:27.866, Speaker E: Of other things in DeFi.
01:08:28.058 - 01:08:29.834, Speaker C: What it is is a fully customizable.
01:08:29.882 - 01:08:34.014, Speaker E: Way to have this pool of assets. And these tokens that represent ownership of.
01:08:34.052 - 01:08:36.602, Speaker A: Them is it like balancer. It sounds like balancer.
01:08:36.666 - 01:08:36.966, Speaker C: Yep.
01:08:37.018 - 01:08:43.166, Speaker E: That's like another example. It's like a more customized example where with balancer, you have these balancer pool.
01:08:43.198 - 01:08:48.142, Speaker C: Tokens which represent ownership of the pool of assets in the balancer pool.
01:08:48.286 - 01:08:59.694, Speaker E: And you can kind of create and redeem them. And then separately, there's this other thing where you can trade against these balancer pools using the sort of AMM curve like thing. And so that's like a more generalized version of Uniswap.
01:08:59.762 - 01:09:02.198, Speaker C: Uniswap is also a pool, but it's.
01:09:02.214 - 01:09:04.314, Speaker E: Like more restricted ones are only two.
01:09:04.352 - 01:09:06.326, Speaker C: Assets in it, the fully generalized pool.
01:09:06.358 - 01:09:14.378, Speaker E: So you can specify everything from you can sort of do whatever you want with them. And so you could just write a program to control each piece of it.
01:09:14.464 - 01:09:18.526, Speaker C: And what that means is that you could take a pool and with the.
01:09:18.548 - 01:09:20.046, Speaker E: Address that controls the assets, you could.
01:09:20.068 - 01:09:29.634, Speaker C: Write it such that it took the assets and provided liquidity on a Dex with them. And so if you wanted to, you could have this pool that instead of.
01:09:29.672 - 01:09:35.214, Speaker E: Amming, it sort of like replicated that curve but did it by providing on a Dex.
01:09:35.342 - 01:09:37.666, Speaker C: Or you could build a pool where.
01:09:37.688 - 01:09:39.474, Speaker E: It'S just an AMM with any arbitrary.
01:09:39.522 - 01:09:44.294, Speaker C: Curve of like, instead of this X times Y equals K thing.
01:09:44.332 - 01:09:45.526, Speaker E: It could be any function of the world.
01:09:45.548 - 01:09:57.270, Speaker C: You just write it down on chain and put it in the address, and then that's what it'll do. And you can control what you need to put in to create shares in the pool.
01:09:57.350 - 01:09:59.306, Speaker E: You control what you get out for redeeming them.
01:09:59.328 - 01:10:03.450, Speaker C: You can customize both of those. And so in its very simplest form.
01:10:03.520 - 01:10:08.106, Speaker E: It'S just a staking thing or like an ETF or something like that. You put assets in, you get ownership.
01:10:08.138 - 01:10:23.090, Speaker C: Out, and then you can't crack that open, but you can customize what happens with each piece of it. And it just makes it super clean and straightforward to roll out a really large number of protocols.
01:10:23.430 - 01:10:25.026, Speaker E: And so I'm really excited for that.
01:10:25.048 - 01:10:29.686, Speaker C: To unlock a lot of projects at once. And that's going to be coming out in the next week.
01:10:29.788 - 01:10:37.346, Speaker A: All right, well, this has been super interesting. Where can people learn more about each of you and Solana and Project Serum?
01:10:37.538 - 01:10:48.810, Speaker D: Well, solana.com just go there or if you there's a ton of documentation about just kind of design and as well as developer docs, but jump into our Discord. We're friendly.
01:10:50.510 - 01:10:51.994, Speaker C: Sam yeah.
01:10:52.112 - 01:11:04.770, Speaker E: Oh, God, there are so many pro and they all link to each other, which is good. But you go to Project Serum.com to see sort of an ecosystem website. You can go to our Discord. You can go to our Telegram channel. You go to our Twitter account.
01:11:04.920 - 01:11:06.370, Speaker C: Follow me on Twitter.
01:11:07.030 - 01:11:09.202, Speaker E: All of those, like, all words lead.
01:11:09.256 - 01:11:11.700, Speaker C: To serum, so to speak.
01:11:13.510 - 01:11:17.102, Speaker A: Okay, great. Well, thank you both so much for coming on Unchained.
