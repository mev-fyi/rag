00:00:00.240 - 00:00:05.977, Speaker A: Some of these critics are saying that Athena is essentially a Terra Luna in the making. So what is your response to them?
00:00:06.121 - 00:00:37.659, Speaker B: Yeah, I think we can't control like the funding rates. They are like volatile and it's like really core to the product, which is. That's all we're tokenizing. It's that funding rate and sort of delivering in the token. And so it varies. And we actually think it's more healthy for the market to have an exogenous interest rate which is like set by the market and not controlled internally. That's actually a much more healthy dynamic than what you saw with Terra Luna, where it was basically fixing something at 20% and then plowing VC money into that to try and sustain something that was clearly unsustainable.
00:00:37.659 - 00:00:54.995, Speaker B: So our approach to this is like the market is going to be setting the interest rate around funding and all Athena is doing is providing infrastructure to allow USD to respond to that funding rate. I think more broadly it really is like a very weak surface level argument to compare what Athena is doing to Luna.
