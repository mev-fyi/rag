00:00:00.330 - 00:00:01.210, Speaker A: Not a dividend.
00:00:01.290 - 00:00:02.474, Speaker B: It's a tale of two quan.
00:00:02.522 - 00:00:05.162, Speaker C: Now your losses are on someone else's balance sheet.
00:00:05.226 - 00:00:07.722, Speaker A: Generally speaking, airdrops are kind of pointless anyways.
00:00:07.866 - 00:00:10.618, Speaker C: Unnamed trading firms who are very involved.
00:00:10.714 - 00:00:13.706, Speaker B: Alec ETH is the ultimate DeFi protocols.
00:00:13.738 - 00:00:26.866, Speaker C: Are the antidote to this problem. Excellent. All right. Hello, everybody. Welcome to the chopping block. Every couple weeks, the four of us get together and give the industry insiders perspective on the crypto topics of the day day. So, quick intros.
00:00:26.866 - 00:00:29.762, Speaker C: First up, we got Tom, the DeFi maven and master of memes.
00:00:29.906 - 00:00:31.666, Speaker D: Next up, we have Tarun, the gigabrain.
00:00:31.698 - 00:00:38.470, Speaker C: And grandpuba at Gauntlet today. Unfortunately, Robert couldn't join us, so Laura is filling in. Laura CEO of the show.
00:00:38.620 - 00:00:40.290, Speaker D: Thanks for being with us, Laura.
00:00:40.370 - 00:00:59.242, Speaker C: And then you got myself a massive the head hype man at Dragonfly. So the three of us, including Laura, we're early stage investors in crypto. But I want to caveat. Nothing we say here is investment advice, legal advice or even life advice. So I just got back from Token 2049, which is the big marquee event in Asia in Singapore.
00:00:59.386 - 00:01:02.558, Speaker D: I am extremely jet lagged, but it.
00:01:02.564 - 00:01:07.086, Speaker C: Was a really fantastic event. I had an amazing time. I tweeted about this a little bit.
00:01:07.108 - 00:01:09.122, Speaker D: Earlier, but I feel like the energy.
00:01:09.176 - 00:01:10.706, Speaker C: In Asia feels really different than the.
00:01:10.728 - 00:01:12.180, Speaker D: Energy in the US right now.
00:01:12.630 - 00:01:14.878, Speaker C: Laura, I was listening to the last few shows you've been running and it's.
00:01:14.894 - 00:01:17.374, Speaker D: Kind of all very doom and gloomy.
00:01:17.502 - 00:01:24.246, Speaker C: A lot of people kind of feeling sullen about regulation and about the SEC and we're going to talk about some of that stuff.
00:01:24.348 - 00:01:25.958, Speaker D: With all the stuff going on in.
00:01:25.964 - 00:01:30.506, Speaker C: The US, macro feels terrible, everyone's kind of sad. Asia people feel great.
00:01:30.608 - 00:01:41.260, Speaker E: Did you miss the episode that came out yesterday with SPF because he felt optimistic about what was going to happen with regulation in the US. And I was like, what?
00:01:43.310 - 00:01:58.754, Speaker C: I have a queued up, I want to listen to it. I've heard that SBF has been doing lots and lots of behind the scenes action with respect to regulators in the US. So it's basically him and Katie Hahn kind of have the whole US industry on their back is what I hear. I don't know how true that is.
00:01:58.792 - 00:02:00.242, Speaker E: Pretty much that makes sense.
00:02:00.376 - 00:02:04.980, Speaker A: Someone was telling me Sam's spending like half his time in DC these days, which is, I guess, a testament to.
00:02:05.910 - 00:02:46.950, Speaker E: Yeah, yeah, I wouldn't be surprised. Yeah, you should. You know, one thing that I was curious about was like, what is he talking to them about? And I think there are certain things that the crypto community is super kind of just really into or thinking about a lot. And I think his priorities are slightly different. Not 100%, but I think everybody has been talking about the tornado, cash sanctions and privacy and stuff like that and I don't think that's top of his list. So even though he's spending a lot of time there. I think there are certain things where that's really what his priority is, is having FTX infrastructure being used to clear derivatives.
00:02:46.950 - 00:02:59.430, Speaker E: I'm sure that's probably actually number one, because you talked about like exchange kind of stuff was one of his priorities. But I feel like some of the more hot button topics in terms of regulation are maybe not his priority.
00:03:00.810 - 00:03:04.502, Speaker C: I mean, that makes sense, right? I don't think one should expect for.
00:03:04.636 - 00:03:08.486, Speaker D: Sam necessarily to carry every pet issue.
00:03:08.588 - 00:03:18.794, Speaker C: Of the crypto native community on their lot. I have a ton of respect for Sam and for anybody who's kind of in there day in and day out.
00:03:18.832 - 00:03:20.860, Speaker D: Especially at a time like this when.
00:03:22.030 - 00:03:24.670, Speaker C: There'S so many headwinds for crypto, especially in the US.
00:03:24.740 - 00:03:27.200, Speaker D: Where people have been by and large.
00:03:28.370 - 00:03:37.106, Speaker C: There are more negative news stories than positive news stories over the last six months. And this week was no exception to that. So maybe we should just jump straight into it. One of the big news this week.
00:03:37.128 - 00:03:40.738, Speaker D: So historically the crypto industry has been.
00:03:40.744 - 00:04:01.942, Speaker C: Really pushing for the CFTC to become the dominant regulator of cryptocurrencies. And the party line within crypto has been CFTC way nicer to us than the SEC, way more reasonable. We really want them as a regulator of choice. And there was something that dropped, a lawsuit that dropped within the last couple of weeks that I think caused a lot of people to change their tune.
00:04:02.086 - 00:04:05.254, Speaker D: And this was the CFTC lawsuit against Ukidao.
00:04:05.382 - 00:04:09.914, Speaker C: So quick backdrop on what the hell is Ukidao? So Ukidao, you may remember in its.
00:04:09.952 - 00:04:12.150, Speaker D: Previous form, which was BZX.
00:04:12.310 - 00:04:21.838, Speaker C: BZX was an early DeFi lending protocol back in the very early days of DeFi that got hacked repeatedly. It was kind of a mess in the very early days.
00:04:21.924 - 00:04:24.066, Speaker E: They were one of the first definitely a mess.
00:04:24.248 - 00:04:25.090, Speaker D: Definitely a mess.
00:04:25.160 - 00:04:57.258, Speaker C: Definitely a mess. So they rebranded to Ukidao and whatever, they continued doing stuff iterating on product, they obviously didn't have a ton of success, but the CFTC filed a lawsuit against them. And the lawsuit so you might be unsurprised that the lawsuit is, know, doing kind of derivatives y things as offering these things to US customers, which is illegal, they're supposed to register with the CFTC, which they did not do. But the other part of the lawsuit, which is what freaked out a bunch of people, is that the lawsuit basically.
00:04:57.344 - 00:05:00.886, Speaker D: Declared that Ukidao, which was the Dao.
00:05:00.918 - 00:05:02.414, Speaker C: That was voting on chain to do.
00:05:02.452 - 00:05:05.626, Speaker D: Certain things or whatever, that this was an unincorporated partnership.
00:05:05.818 - 00:05:10.554, Speaker C: And as an unincorporated partnership, that meant that every person who had ever participated.
00:05:10.602 - 00:05:14.366, Speaker D: In Ukidao governments in governance was jointly.
00:05:14.398 - 00:05:26.786, Speaker C: And severally liable for the violations that slash Uki committed. Meaning that running an unregistered I can't remember what the actual was.
00:05:26.808 - 00:05:28.506, Speaker B: It a commodity pool operator.
00:05:28.638 - 00:05:30.486, Speaker C: Commodity pool operator, that sounds right.
00:05:30.588 - 00:05:30.998, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:05:31.084 - 00:05:40.190, Speaker C: So you're not supposed to do that without registering with the CFTC obviously Ukidao on the whole did not do this, and therefore every individual member of Ukidao is liable.
00:05:40.370 - 00:05:44.422, Speaker D: And this is maybe unsurprising, but it's unprecedented.
00:05:44.566 - 00:06:11.346, Speaker C: Now, Ukidao, unlike a lot of other DAOs, is not incorporated. So a lot of DAOs, what they do these days is they actually have some kind of corporate entity somewhere, some kind of LLC that limits the liability for the individual members of the Dao. Ukida does not have any such thing. So it's known as an unwrapped Dao. There's no corporate shell or anything that would prevent people individually from the Dao, from all being liable for anything the Dao does that's illegal. So nowadays most DAOs are not like.
00:06:11.368 - 00:06:13.794, Speaker D: This, but Ukidao being a relatively early.
00:06:13.832 - 00:06:18.498, Speaker C: Dao, BZX being a relatively early protocol, they had a totally kind of naked dow.
00:06:18.594 - 00:06:23.158, Speaker D: And as a result, basically, this is kind of what people were afraid of.
00:06:23.324 - 00:06:25.078, Speaker C: And exactly the worst that's come to.
00:06:25.084 - 00:06:27.030, Speaker D: Light, which is this idea that anybody.
00:06:27.100 - 00:06:29.462, Speaker C: Who participate in governance is therefore also.
00:06:29.516 - 00:06:35.162, Speaker D: Liable for anything that Ukidao did wrong. This caused a lot of people in crypto to get very upset and say.
00:06:35.216 - 00:06:36.986, Speaker C: Oh my God, CFTC, how can you do this to us?
00:06:37.008 - 00:06:38.220, Speaker D: I thought you're a friend.
00:06:38.750 - 00:06:43.374, Speaker C: Top ten anime betrayal type energy. So what are your guys thoughts on.
00:06:43.412 - 00:06:45.146, Speaker D: This whole Ukidao drama?
00:06:45.338 - 00:07:30.218, Speaker E: One thing was like, Gabe Shapiro came on my premium offering and I was really shocked when he said he's, he's a lawyer, a crypto lawyer for Delphi Labs. And so I'm sure his understanding of this is just well beyond even mine. But I was super shocked when he was like, oh, this means all of DeFi could be illegal. And I was like, what? So there's two things, right? What they were doing was illegal. I think nobody will question that, right? But then he was kind of saying that any sort of thing where you're trying to have decentralized governance, that could be illegal. But the other thing that I wanted to say was like, that commissioner who dissented, I read her dissent. I thought it was actually really interesting.
00:07:30.218 - 00:08:46.370, Speaker E: This is not an area I'm super familiar with, but her main thing was she was like, first of all, look, this now creates this weird separation in terms of the class of individuals right there's. Like the token holders that participated in governance and then the token holders that didn't. And she was like, look, the CFTC is sort of setting this precedent in this enforcement action without having gone through a normal process of putting forward a proposal and then soliciting comments and then kind of like coming up with whatever. The best solution is to deal with these kinds of situations where Dows are engaging in some kind of activity that is against some sort of law. So obviously she just was like, look, this is sort of just creating this thing off the fly without really thinking about it. And then second, she was like the side effect of this is that a lot of these Dows, their token holders, will feel less inclined to participate in governance, which she was pointing out was seemingly a bad effect, which I would agree with. So, yeah, I think there were just a number of things where it either wasn't clearly thought through or the effect that they wanted was to sort of like chill Dow activity.
00:08:46.370 - 00:08:52.710, Speaker E: I don't know, by the way, I looked it up and FCM is Futures Commission.
00:08:55.690 - 00:09:04.906, Speaker C: But anyway, yeah, it definitely is going to cause a huge showing effect on people participating in DAOs. Right. The idea that you are liable for what the Dow does, like anything that.
00:09:04.928 - 00:09:07.878, Speaker D: The Dow does, if you ever participate.
00:09:07.894 - 00:09:19.706, Speaker C: In governance once, right. You participate once in governance, like three years ago, and then you kind of forget about the tokens, you still hold them and then three years later the Dow votes to go rob a bank or whatever. Okay, well, now you're liable for robbing a bank.
00:09:19.818 - 00:09:24.014, Speaker D: That seems like a pretty crazy legal theory about liability. Right?
00:09:24.052 - 00:09:52.598, Speaker C: Like, normally that's not how anything we think of works. If you have no mens rea, meaning you have no actual intention to commit anything illegal, then the idea that someday the Dow does something illegal you are now liable for it seems pretty ridiculous. So the dissent from the one commissioner was notable because I think it pointed out a lot of the weaknesses of this legal theory. But of course, again, filing a lawsuit.
00:09:52.614 - 00:09:55.194, Speaker D: Is not law, so there's a very.
00:09:55.232 - 00:10:08.926, Speaker C: Good chance that this thing is going to get challenged. I think the legal theory behind the challenge seems pretty plausible. But like everything with basically the government regulators going after something, it's much easier for them to start a process than.
00:10:08.948 - 00:10:11.386, Speaker D: For it to get stopped by civil.
00:10:11.418 - 00:10:17.410, Speaker C: Society or by a particular set of defendants. Right. So it's going to take years in this case for there to be anything.
00:10:17.480 - 00:10:23.218, Speaker D: That is, like, settled law on the question of how does Dao liability work.
00:10:23.384 - 00:10:39.738, Speaker C: But this theory by the CFTC is going to scare the shit out of people because it's like, okay, well, if it maybe works like this, then that's terrifying. And it's going to be a huge disincentive for any institutions or any large corporations or even people who are wealthy enough to consider themselves targets of the.
00:10:39.744 - 00:10:43.050, Speaker D: CFTC to ever participate in Dao governance.
00:10:44.030 - 00:11:30.002, Speaker A: Yeah, I think the specifics of the lawsuit are particularly mean. I think on the one hand, I agree a Dow does not have limited liability the same way like a corporation does. And so, yeah, I don't think anyone was operating or something not was operating on an assumption that if you're part of a Dow and then the Dow commits fraud, it's all cool because it's a Dow and so it's fine. But I think the thinking was more, well, the Dow is unstoppable. How would you go about stopping the Dow from doing something like that. Like maker, right? Like Maker. Some have an entity per se that is operating Maker, but it's like, how would you even go about stopping Maker? And so I feel like those are kind of two different it's a distinction that I think maybe people didn't really appreciate.
00:11:30.002 - 00:11:41.934, Speaker A: And I also agree with Laura. Setting the bar as voted or participated in governance is pretty bizarre to me as well. I would be curious to see how that holds up in court. But my favorite bit for this was.
00:11:41.972 - 00:11:44.154, Speaker F: Actually how they were served.
00:11:44.202 - 00:11:56.398, Speaker A: Basically, they posted the notice in both the forum as well as the intercom chat bot on the Ukidao website because they said there's no email address and there's no mailing address. So they're like, this is how we're.
00:11:56.414 - 00:11:56.962, Speaker B: Going to do it.
00:11:57.016 - 00:12:06.680, Speaker A: And apparently this was upheld by a judge recently. So now you can get served on your forum or through your intercom chat bot, so you got to watch out for that.
00:12:07.210 - 00:13:08.114, Speaker E: Yeah. My reaction to this was so I just think about how for me as a journalist, when I was writing my book and there were people that definitely you could definitely say their portrayal in the book wasn't positive and they hadn't spoken to me. I went through so many hoops to try to make sure that they knew what was going to be said about them in the book and to give them a chance to respond. And there were certain people where I just did not have their contact information. So I literally sought out all these different random contacts of theirs and was like, can you please pass this on to them? Even if they said, oh, they don't want to talk to you, whatever, I would say, look, just please send this document with these statements and just make sure that they have a chance to read this and then they can decide if they want to respond to me. And I wouldn't do it just with one person. I would do it with multiple people to make sure I just had tried everything to make sure that they could have a chance to respond.
00:13:08.114 - 00:13:32.990, Speaker E: Right. And so when I think about kind of that standard and it's just for a book, it's not even for a legal thing, which is that has real consequences, I just am surprised that the judge said that was a sufficient way to serve people about something so important. To me, it's like, whoa, what am I doing? Like, jumping through all these hoops for what I'm doing. If the government that was my reaction.
00:13:33.330 - 00:13:51.110, Speaker A: Yeah, it's like, how do you verify receipt, right? Or someone got served via an NFT last year as well, and the NFT had like, a link to the actual documents in it, but it's also know how is that like, how do you know that someone actually viewed it and received it, I guess.
00:13:51.260 - 00:14:15.886, Speaker C: Yeah, I thought the theory was that checking the server log to see that somebody actually visited the link was supposed to be the proof that the serving happened. Which obviously doesn't work with NFT because anybody could look at the NFT doesn't have to be the person who actually owns it, especially after it made news. There's thousands and thousands of people looking at the NFT. It's like, okay, well, maybe the real person is somewhere in there. So yeah, the whole concept is a little absurd. I mean, to be clear, if you.
00:14:15.908 - 00:14:20.398, Speaker D: Are a member of Ukidao, probably you saw this when it got posted on.
00:14:20.404 - 00:14:29.460, Speaker C: The forum because I'm sure everyone in Ukidao was like, guys, did you see this? We just got served, so I'm sure it worked. Right? That actually seems like a great way to get it done.
00:14:30.310 - 00:14:34.420, Speaker D: But it also does seem like maybe.
00:14:35.910 - 00:14:45.366, Speaker C: An excellent way to defraud another or like to scare another Dow is to serve them through their chatbot and to see if you can scare them without it being real.
00:14:45.468 - 00:15:17.442, Speaker A: There is this other question too of how do you actually identify the Dao members? Right? Even if you voted on chain, you don't necessarily have identifying characteristics with an address. Mean, I've interacted with know, KYC Exchange account or something like that. So it's like, who's going to step up and raise their hand and say, yes, I was part of Ukidao and I want to be sued by the CFTC. So it's a bit tornado cash, like in that way where it's like, who's going to be the defendant here, really? Or how are they going to find these people?
00:15:17.576 - 00:15:19.490, Speaker E: Yeah, let me DOX my wallets.
00:15:21.350 - 00:15:23.794, Speaker C: Yeah, I think, again, this is a.
00:15:23.832 - 00:15:26.034, Speaker D: Large part of the kind of game.
00:15:26.072 - 00:15:45.046, Speaker C: Theory behind Dows in the first place, right, was not that Dows are impossible to identify, but that the connection between the person in the Dao and the real person is difficult to identify. So in some way the real measure of this UK Dao lawsuit is, okay, let's say that nobody raises their hand and know, hey, I'm part of Ukidao.
00:15:45.078 - 00:15:46.890, Speaker D: I'm ready to get sued.
00:15:47.550 - 00:15:59.406, Speaker C: What are they going to do? Are they going to try to chain analysis people and cross reference with Coinbase and try to figure out who these people really are? How aggressively is CFTC going to go.
00:15:59.428 - 00:16:00.842, Speaker D: After the people in the Dao?
00:16:00.986 - 00:16:14.098, Speaker C: And of course, a lot of the people in the Dow are probably not Americans anyway. It does feel like part of why there's such an interesting test case is not just, okay, the legal theory behind going after DAOs, but also, what are.
00:16:14.104 - 00:16:16.066, Speaker D: The defendants going to do if the.
00:16:16.088 - 00:16:21.106, Speaker C: Answer is that no defendant shows up and basically there's just like an empty.
00:16:21.218 - 00:16:23.798, Speaker D: Seat when they're like, great, here's the.
00:16:23.804 - 00:16:30.466, Speaker C: Case against Zuki Dao. And nobody shows up, that might be in some way like, the strongest defense of DAOs. Is that you try to sue a Dao.
00:16:30.498 - 00:16:31.450, Speaker D: And nothing happens.
00:16:31.600 - 00:16:54.814, Speaker C: And then you just have to go wasting a bunch of cycles trying to figure out who's in the Dow. In many ways, the whole theory of why Dows are supposed to be legally robust or not legally robust, but legally difficult to attack, is because it's kind of like the early P to P platforms like BitTorrent. In the early days when the music.
00:16:54.852 - 00:16:59.746, Speaker D: Labels were going after users of Napster and other peer to peer services, the.
00:16:59.768 - 00:17:04.546, Speaker C: Idea was that, look, you can only kind of go after one person at a time at great effort to yourself.
00:17:04.648 - 00:17:07.700, Speaker D: To try to nail them with something. But.
00:17:09.750 - 00:17:12.786, Speaker C: If you actually want to stop this thing en masse, it's just not realistic.
00:17:12.898 - 00:17:13.270, Speaker D: Right.
00:17:13.340 - 00:17:23.226, Speaker C: The only way ultimately that the record labels were able to get people to stop doing peer to peer file sharing was to basically inculcate people into things like itunes and Spotify such that they.
00:17:23.248 - 00:17:24.380, Speaker D: Didn'T want to do that.
00:17:25.230 - 00:17:37.082, Speaker C: You know, the belief is that's what DAOs are about. It's about lowering the barriers to coordination among people who want to coordinate. And if you don't let them do it, they'll find other ways to do it. We'll see whether that works in practice.
00:17:37.146 - 00:18:00.402, Speaker E: Yeah, but I don't know if you recall I forget the name of it, the Recording Association of America or whatever, they did go after individuals and it did have a chilling effect. So maybe that would be the same theory with Ukidao. It's like, okay, so no one shows up, so then the CFTC will try to match identities with the token holders and then go after certain people to make an example of them. I don't know.
00:18:00.456 - 00:18:03.014, Speaker C: To be clear, I don't think the lawsuits were that much of a chilling effect.
00:18:03.052 - 00:18:03.206, Speaker D: Right?
00:18:03.228 - 00:18:11.546, Speaker C: The main chilling effect was shutting down Napster. That was the big chilling effect. But the lawsuits against individuals like, I mean, peer to peer file sharing was still huge. Even while this stuff was going on.
00:18:11.568 - 00:18:14.010, Speaker D: It was still growing and they also.
00:18:14.080 - 00:18:31.200, Speaker A: Had massive backlash for the RIA. Right. That basically totally killed the reputation that's pretty much everyone all anything associated with them now is just like yeah, they went after a bunch of random people who downloaded a song and tried to ruin their there's. Yeah, there's a lot of backlash to it too.
00:18:31.650 - 00:18:40.334, Speaker E: Yeah, but I don't know if the CFTC is like trying to get on people's good stuff. I mean they're like a regulator. It's different from a recording.
00:18:40.382 - 00:18:46.098, Speaker C: I don't mean I think to some of our previous conversations. I think, look, the CFTC doesn't want.
00:18:46.104 - 00:18:50.054, Speaker D: To be a know, they do want to be liked because these are people.
00:18:50.092 - 00:19:02.150, Speaker C: Too and they have reputations outside know, the period of time that they're actually serving for the CFTC. I think people want to be perceived as being reasonable and coming up with good laws and protecting consumers where they can.
00:19:02.300 - 00:19:23.466, Speaker E: Yeah, actually I think one thing that interests me is I sort of feel like in a way, this enforcement action almost came out of this turf war between the CFTC and the SEC, where it's sort of like, oh, so you're tough with the enforcement. You know, like, match you on that. Like, I don't know, maybe it's just speculation, but it is out of character for the CFTC.
00:19:23.658 - 00:19:26.858, Speaker C: Or maybe it's not. Maybe this is just what the CFTC is going to be like once they're.
00:19:26.874 - 00:19:28.466, Speaker D: The cop on the beat, is that.
00:19:28.488 - 00:19:33.218, Speaker C: They'Re like, look, somebody's got to crack down on this down nonsense, and I guess it's us now, so we're just.
00:19:33.224 - 00:19:35.842, Speaker D: Going to go do it anyway.
00:19:35.896 - 00:19:42.502, Speaker C: We'll see. See we'll well, speaking of the SEC, the SEC was also in the news in the last couple of weeks because.
00:19:42.556 - 00:19:47.830, Speaker D: Of a large settlement that they reached with Kim Kardashian.
00:19:48.170 - 00:19:54.026, Speaker C: So we might remember Kim Kardashian very famously and prominently shield this project called.
00:19:54.048 - 00:19:57.286, Speaker D: Ethereum Max, which was what is Ethereum Max?
00:19:57.318 - 00:19:59.846, Speaker C: Is this like an Ethereum fork kind of shitcoin?
00:19:59.958 - 00:20:08.062, Speaker E: Let's just say it's not associated with Ethereum. I don't know what it is, but let's just make that part clear.
00:20:08.196 - 00:20:08.494, Speaker D: Okay.
00:20:08.532 - 00:20:24.526, Speaker C: Vitalik was not involved in ethereum. Max this is outside parties that were innovating on Ethereum to make it more Max. Anyway. So she was charged 1.25 million for her promotion of Ethereum Max. And pretty much immediately after this, ethereum.
00:20:24.558 - 00:20:26.030, Speaker D: Max is just, like, dead as a.
00:20:26.040 - 00:20:49.340, Speaker C: Doorknoil pretty much, since they originally filled it. But after the announcement of this Kim Kardashian settlement, ethereum Max pumped, like, 130%, which is awesome because that's just how crypto works. I don't know that there's much to talk about here other than, like, look, if you are a celebrity that, know, not disclosing your conflicts of interest, the SEC will eventually get you a year and a half.
00:20:50.110 - 00:20:54.240, Speaker E: You guys did you guys watch the SEC's video that they released with this?
00:20:55.170 - 00:21:03.998, Speaker C: That was embarrassing for make that okay. Can you give us the exposition? Like, give us the play by play of the video?
00:21:04.164 - 00:21:32.250, Speaker E: Yeah, it was just, like, warning people, basically, that if a celebrity is promoting something, that doesn't necessarily mean that it's a good investment for you because they're getting paid for this, and they're going to make money either way, and your financial priorities might be something different. Okay, so just keep watching because I was watching this, and I was a little bit like, wait, because there's something about the style of it where office.
00:21:32.320 - 00:21:34.490, Speaker D: Hours with Gary Gensler. Yeah.
00:21:34.560 - 00:22:14.518, Speaker E: You could imagine that they would make it in a way where you, as the viewer, would really take away the lesson that you need to be careful of these people. There's something so parody like about it where it's almost like they're making fun of themselves rather than making the bad actors seem like bad actors. Do you know what I'm getting at? So I was watching this I was like, wait, if the intended effect is to educate people around not these are such caricatures. It just sort of top notch stock. Yeah, more ridiculous. Rather than giving people the message, like, don't trust these people. I don't know.
00:22:14.518 - 00:22:28.122, Speaker E: That was my take. It was like super. I don't know, there was just something about it. I was like, I don't feel like the style of this video kind of fit with the message. I guess we can put it that way.
00:22:28.256 - 00:22:34.714, Speaker A: Yeah, they're trying to be more relatable, trying to get those zoomers excited about disclosures and whatnot.
00:22:34.842 - 00:22:35.454, Speaker D: No, it's fine.
00:22:35.492 - 00:22:44.914, Speaker C: Because they know that this is the one thing that everybody's going to pay attention to because you announced Kim Kardashian and so you pay some very low quality video company.
00:22:45.032 - 00:22:51.806, Speaker B: I think we should maybe also point out that the SEC and CFTC seem to be going for very different types.
00:22:51.838 - 00:22:56.386, Speaker F: Of people to go after. The SEC seems to go for the.
00:22:56.408 - 00:23:06.406, Speaker B: High Value Shock therapy. They're like a reality TV show. They're just going for the clicks and the likes. And the CFTC just goes for the easiest one because BZX was always sort.
00:23:06.428 - 00:23:11.306, Speaker F: Of like dead on arrival in many ways in terms of a bunch of.
00:23:11.328 - 00:23:26.794, Speaker B: Things that have happened in that ecosystem. So the difference in tactics, the question is which one will sway Joe Congressman or Sally Congresswoman to vote on the thing that chooses the dividing line in funding?
00:23:26.842 - 00:23:28.526, Speaker D: And I don't know, I don't know.
00:23:28.548 - 00:23:34.366, Speaker B: Anything about politics, but I'm assuming that crypto people would prefer the CFTC based on that.
00:23:34.548 - 00:23:46.402, Speaker C: Well, in many, like, actually the SEC going after headlines is kind of easier to manage because it's know, like they're they're going to go after the frauds, they're going to go after the celebrities that are getting into the space and.
00:23:46.456 - 00:23:47.954, Speaker D: The really complex stuff.
00:23:48.152 - 00:23:57.078, Speaker C: They're just going to kind of leave alone gensler might make a lot of noise and a lot of sound and fury about how, oh, everything in DeFi is bad, but actually going after a.
00:23:57.084 - 00:23:59.302, Speaker D: Uniswap is just like kind of too.
00:23:59.356 - 00:24:05.466, Speaker C: Hard or complex or it's not a clear cut enough case. So he's going to veer away from it. Whereas the CFTC, they might be like.
00:24:05.488 - 00:24:07.770, Speaker D: Oh no, that sounds like an interesting.
00:24:07.840 - 00:24:10.070, Speaker C: Legal theory for us to try to challenge Uniswap.
00:24:10.150 - 00:24:11.210, Speaker D: Let's go for it.
00:24:11.360 - 00:24:12.974, Speaker C: If anything, it seems like CFTC actually.
00:24:13.012 - 00:24:15.310, Speaker D: Is scarier if that's the way they're operating.
00:24:16.290 - 00:24:26.926, Speaker A: We were talking about this yesterday. There's this outstanding case with Rensley versus Uniswap where this Uniswap user is suing Uniswap for allowing shitcoins to be traded on Uniswap.
00:24:26.958 - 00:24:29.410, Speaker F: Not just Uniswap, also its largest.
00:24:30.150 - 00:24:43.800, Speaker A: Yes, yes, that's right. But one of the tokens rentally traded was Ethereum Max. So I'm sure she feels very righted now that Kim Kardashian had to pay a million dollars in fines. That's feeling very protected there.
00:24:45.370 - 00:24:51.002, Speaker B: I have one sort of semi saucy take on this Kim Kardashian thing.
00:24:51.136 - 00:24:53.834, Speaker F: Which know you know how she just.
00:24:53.872 - 00:24:56.762, Speaker B: Started this private equity fund, like, a month ago?
00:24:56.896 - 00:24:57.994, Speaker C: Yeah, that's right.
00:24:58.112 - 00:25:02.926, Speaker B: Usually when you get these SEC citations and you admit wrongdoing, you're banned from.
00:25:03.108 - 00:25:06.526, Speaker F: Trading or purchasing securities or being a.
00:25:06.548 - 00:25:14.334, Speaker B: Registered securities broker of any form for, like, a year or whatever. I'm curious how the two things coincide.
00:25:14.382 - 00:25:23.198, Speaker C: There's, like, something no pumping something without disclosing your investment in it is very different from securities fraud.
00:25:23.294 - 00:25:25.774, Speaker B: Yeah, but she's an investment advisor.
00:25:25.822 - 00:25:30.886, Speaker F: Technically, sure, but usually investment advisors have.
00:25:30.908 - 00:25:38.490, Speaker B: Some type of slap on it. Even if it's like a two month suspension, there's usually some that's interesting to see that this got negotiated out.
00:25:38.640 - 00:25:58.298, Speaker E: Well, she is prohibited from promoting I forget what the activity is, but there's some prohibition on her activities with crypto asset securities. So it's, like, limited to just any crypto securities, but not, like, securities broadly.
00:25:58.394 - 00:26:01.802, Speaker B: I do think that's, like, a kind of funny thing from the private equity.
00:26:01.866 - 00:26:05.418, Speaker D: Side that I think that's very reasonable.
00:26:05.514 - 00:26:08.370, Speaker C: I don't know. I think you're looking for a bone to pick. I think that's very reasonable.
00:26:09.510 - 00:26:11.460, Speaker F: I'm not looking for a bone to pick.
00:26:12.470 - 00:26:14.114, Speaker B: When I pick fights, it's with people.
00:26:14.152 - 00:26:16.100, Speaker F: Who fuck up for a reason.
00:26:16.710 - 00:26:17.218, Speaker D: Sure.
00:26:17.304 - 00:26:19.746, Speaker E: Well, I thought you were going for more conspiracy theory.
00:26:19.858 - 00:26:24.006, Speaker B: No, it wasn't really conspiracy theory. As much as I bet you part.
00:26:24.028 - 00:26:27.554, Speaker F: Of the negotiation of her settlement involved.
00:26:27.602 - 00:26:32.786, Speaker B: This, like, hey, you can make the fine higher, but exclude certain.
00:26:32.908 - 00:26:45.598, Speaker C: Yeah, but also, look, it was discouragement of profits, right? It's not like, hey, we're going to hit you with 1.25 because it's a nice round number. It was, okay, we're going to take your profits from you, shilling Ethereum Max, and don't do it again.
00:26:45.684 - 00:26:52.622, Speaker E: Yeah, no, but $1 million of that was a fine. 250,000 was discouragement, and the rest was, like, interest or something.
00:26:52.756 - 00:27:12.466, Speaker C: But yeah, this is not an egregious for somebody Kim Kardashian's stature and how much money she makes just, like, Tweeting stuff. There's a very good chance that Kim Kardashian never even heard of Ethereum. Right. She just has, like, a team that manages her social media, and they're just, like, taking orders, and somebody filled it with this thing. I would personally be surprised if Kim.
00:27:12.498 - 00:27:14.760, Speaker D: Kardashian has any idea what Ethereum Max is.
00:27:16.010 - 00:27:25.740, Speaker B: I guess I'm just pointing out that the negotiations for these things are quite interesting, and you can kind of see the side effects of them in these to. That's all.
00:27:28.030 - 00:27:33.990, Speaker C: It's definitely there was definitely some finessing in the shape of this settlement in.
00:27:34.000 - 00:27:36.862, Speaker D: Order to get everybody what they see.
00:27:36.996 - 00:27:42.158, Speaker C: SEC comes out with a nice scalp that they can show off on social media, and then Kim K gets to.
00:27:42.164 - 00:27:44.990, Speaker D: Keep running her private equity.
00:27:46.310 - 00:27:53.374, Speaker E: Yeah, no, definitely was a great PR move for the SEC. No question. They got so many headlines.
00:27:53.422 - 00:27:57.240, Speaker B: Gary Gensler have, like I feel like that must be his most liked post.
00:27:59.930 - 00:28:06.354, Speaker C: I'm sure Gary. He was probably every night going to sleep, so excited of how Twitter was going to embrace him with open arms.
00:28:06.482 - 00:28:09.798, Speaker D: After he brought the settlement to them.
00:28:09.964 - 00:28:36.530, Speaker A: There was actually a dissenting op ed in, like, Forbes, I think, basically actually saying, no, this was just like a know publicity stunt on behalf of, like, Fortune. Rather, it's like, who was actually being protected. It's as if someone was planning a nice diversified portfolio and was misled by Kim Kardashian to thinking that Ethereum Max was a nice, safe investment. It's just kind of absurd.
00:28:37.030 - 00:28:41.906, Speaker D: So when we talk about there are.
00:28:41.928 - 00:28:47.780, Speaker C: Really obvious rules around this, right? Like, for anything, isn't that even true for sponsored posts on social media?
00:28:48.230 - 00:28:49.526, Speaker D: Think about it this way.
00:28:49.708 - 00:28:58.678, Speaker B: In terms of actual dollars of harm cause there's like the BitBoys of the world who are like the immediate US citizens to go I'm not sure if.
00:28:58.684 - 00:29:01.146, Speaker F: He'S but if he like those people.
00:29:01.168 - 00:29:08.202, Speaker B: Who are promoting shit on YouTube who are much more involved in the constant creation they probably promoted much more in.
00:29:08.256 - 00:29:11.418, Speaker F: Dollars of harm caused for sure.
00:29:11.504 - 00:29:17.694, Speaker B: Kim Kardashian right. But it's clear that the SEC does not give a shit about dollars of harm cause because Gary Gensler is, like.
00:29:17.732 - 00:29:19.454, Speaker F: Looking for this PR win.
00:29:19.652 - 00:30:04.506, Speaker E: Yeah. And actually what. So Jeff Roberts was the writer of the Fortune column, and he pointed out that the SEC completely missed Celsius and Voyager and things like, you know, that caused real pain for everyday investors and was instead kind of going, after this big win with big PR win. And then on top of that, won't approve a bitcoin ETF, which arguably is also hurtful to everyday investors, at least in the US. So, yeah, we should link to that in the show notes, because I thought it was a really well argued piece. In terms of actual damage, it would have been better if the SEC had gone after Celsius as opposed to Kim Kardashian.
00:30:04.698 - 00:30:05.006, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:30:05.028 - 00:30:21.534, Speaker A: And there already are rules around disclosure, right. And that's like an issue with the SEC. That's like a SEC issue. So I don't know, it does feel a bit silly. I kind of subscribe to the Matt Levine theory, which is to it's generally referred as more to accredited investors.
00:30:21.582 - 00:30:22.818, Speaker F: But it's like, you should be able.
00:30:22.824 - 00:30:37.346, Speaker A: To buy anything you want as long as you sign a document that says, I'm an idiot and then someone slaps you and then you're good to go. And I generally kind of subscribe to that theory of markets as opposed to kind of what we have right now.
00:30:37.468 - 00:30:51.866, Speaker B: In this model, the influencer is the person. So there's a very funny meme a couple of weeks ago of this Japanese fighter of some form who passed away. And a few months before he passed.
00:30:51.898 - 00:30:57.120, Speaker F: Away, he was at a stadium and people lined up to get slapped by him.
00:30:57.490 - 00:31:03.520, Speaker B: And I just think of the Kim Kardashian as the guy who's slapping you right before.
00:31:05.730 - 00:31:09.938, Speaker C: I see. Well, look, it's kind of always true of regulators that regulators are like the.
00:31:09.944 - 00:31:12.238, Speaker D: Drunk looking under the streetlight, like they're.
00:31:12.254 - 00:31:17.506, Speaker C: Going to find the thing that's easy to find, rather than it's hard to find Celsius because nobody really knew how.
00:31:17.528 - 00:31:19.826, Speaker D: Bad things were at Celsius until it was out there.
00:31:19.848 - 00:31:22.214, Speaker C: And so you could say, look, well, you didn't find the most terrible thing.
00:31:22.332 - 00:31:24.518, Speaker B: Wait a minute, what are you talking about? Everyone.
00:31:24.604 - 00:31:27.094, Speaker F: First of all, zero XB one being.
00:31:27.132 - 00:31:32.534, Speaker B: The Celsius funds was like one of the most obvious things that you could see on chain and track the losses.
00:31:32.582 - 00:31:39.180, Speaker C: Of yes, I understand if you're following crypto drama yes, it's very easy to know that something was.
00:31:41.070 - 00:31:43.500, Speaker B: Not their job if they're going to be prosecuting these.
00:31:44.190 - 00:31:46.842, Speaker C: Mean okay, let me finish my statement.
00:31:46.906 - 00:31:47.518, Speaker D: Right.
00:31:47.684 - 00:31:56.798, Speaker C: When I say it's easier to look under the streetlight, like, you see Kim Kardashian posting, you guys should buy ethereum Max. It's like, okay, well, clearly this is illegal, right? Like, everybody is pinging you all of.
00:31:56.804 - 00:31:58.706, Speaker D: A sudden saying that Kim Kardashian is.
00:31:58.728 - 00:32:01.682, Speaker C: Posting stuff about some random shitcoin and she didn't disclose anything.
00:32:01.816 - 00:32:03.154, Speaker D: You already know what's up, right?
00:32:03.192 - 00:32:13.254, Speaker C: Same thing with a lot of these influencers in the 2021 cycle. They're really easy, obvious cases to prosecute that are right in front of you and that you know, are going to make headlines and you know, are going to look like you're doing your job.
00:32:13.292 - 00:32:16.294, Speaker D: To retail, doing a Celsius is hard.
00:32:16.332 - 00:32:24.058, Speaker C: It requires basically investigation and insight and hard thinking and kind of prying facts where they're not staring you in the face.
00:32:24.144 - 00:32:25.898, Speaker D: Now, to ruin your point about, like.
00:32:25.904 - 00:32:27.386, Speaker C: Okay, Bitboy versus Kim Kardashian, I think.
00:32:27.408 - 00:32:29.946, Speaker D: Is a great point that there's probably.
00:32:29.968 - 00:32:33.386, Speaker C: Much more harm done by a bitboy than by Kim Kardashian just by sheer.
00:32:33.418 - 00:32:35.626, Speaker D: Volume of dollars moved.
00:32:35.738 - 00:32:50.434, Speaker C: But look, I don't expect the SEC to do, like, brilliant investigative journalism about or not investigative journalism, just investigations about figuring out which platform, especially non US. Platforms, are engaged in malfeasance and which ones are hard. That's hard.
00:32:50.472 - 00:32:52.482, Speaker D: And the SEC doesn't have that much.
00:32:52.536 - 00:32:54.274, Speaker C: Sophistication about crypto, as we've seen many.
00:32:54.312 - 00:32:57.154, Speaker D: Many times yeah, no, I agree with.
00:32:57.192 - 00:33:28.910, Speaker E: You about just the time that investigations take because oftentimes people send me these messages like, you need to look in it, blah, blah, blah, and I'm like, okay, yeah, that would take me a really long time. And meanwhile, I have a new book deal, and I have this other narrative podcast I'm working on and I do two shows a week and blah, blah, blah. But still, it does feel a little crazy that that was kind of their big enforcement. Like, I saw that Nansen in turn tweeted something like, oh, what a bummer, because I was really using Kim Kardashian for my financial advice.
00:33:31.410 - 00:33:33.930, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, it is ridiculous looking.
00:33:34.020 - 00:34:08.922, Speaker B: There is also this thing that regulators in the US. Because they are unable to invest in ever building out technology themselves due to it being much more profitable to spend money on PR videos know, analyzing the on chain data yourself rely on the vendors that they get and whatever vendor they're buying their on chain analytics from dictates what they see. So if it's an older vendor who doesn't understand how DeFi contracts work or doesn't track a lot of on chain activity for certain people of a certain.
00:34:08.976 - 00:34:11.274, Speaker F: Form, then they're not going to see that.
00:34:11.312 - 00:34:14.638, Speaker B: And the only thing they're going to see is like Kim Kardashian ETH got.
00:34:14.724 - 00:34:16.030, Speaker F: 5 million ETH in it.
00:34:16.100 - 00:34:17.918, Speaker C: The other thing too. Yeah, like to Laura's point, like it.
00:34:17.924 - 00:34:20.974, Speaker D: Takes mean I mean it takes work.
00:34:21.012 - 00:34:23.120, Speaker F: But so did that PR video.
00:34:24.770 - 00:34:29.250, Speaker C: I don't know that that took any work actually. I watched it, it seemed pretty low effort.
00:34:30.150 - 00:34:36.050, Speaker B: That's all outsourced I'm just like bad. I don't know how to make content. So to me, anyone who makes videos.
00:34:36.120 - 00:34:49.450, Speaker C: Already is like you're just very impressed by stock footage. I feel like Tom, can we get some more stock footage in this? Just little clips. When we talk about the SEC, you just get people working know, just filling out clipboards.
00:34:50.350 - 00:34:53.274, Speaker B: Okay, actually, let's maybe take a hypothetical question.
00:34:53.312 - 00:35:00.074, Speaker F: Let's suppose you were dictator for one week and you were tasked how well.
00:35:00.112 - 00:35:09.770, Speaker B: Your dictatorship would be viewed after a week was how well you reformed the SEC or CFTC. What would you do with your one week of dictatorial powers?
00:35:09.850 - 00:35:12.030, Speaker D: All right, you have to go first. You pose the question.
00:35:12.180 - 00:35:13.346, Speaker F: Yeah, I mean, I think the main.
00:35:13.368 - 00:35:18.466, Speaker B: Thing I would do is basically fire everyone who's not technical and hire a.
00:35:18.488 - 00:35:20.100, Speaker F: Technical staff for them.
00:35:20.790 - 00:35:26.706, Speaker C: Okay, so in your two weeks, basically you'd fire everybody so there's no one left working?
00:35:26.808 - 00:35:27.698, Speaker B: No, not everyone.
00:35:27.784 - 00:35:31.560, Speaker C: And then you would start doing tech interviews and then you would be kicked out.
00:35:32.010 - 00:35:51.534, Speaker B: I think what I mean by that is I would instill this mandate that would basically have to be followed, that the organization has to basically prioritize certain technical milestones and if they don't, that Congress is basically going to decrease their funding every year for the next five.
00:35:51.572 - 00:35:55.386, Speaker F: Years and basically make a milestone basis.
00:35:55.418 - 00:35:59.806, Speaker B: Of how good their ability to actually measure on chain information is.
00:35:59.828 - 00:36:03.018, Speaker F: And if it's still dog shit, they.
00:36:03.044 - 00:36:05.170, Speaker B: Should keep having their budget.
00:36:05.750 - 00:36:21.560, Speaker E: Well, I think their budgets are already super low. That's probably why. Also we see this sort of like triage with the easy wins that to the rest of us seemed kind of dumb and then little work being done on kind of the more important things.
00:36:22.570 - 00:36:28.378, Speaker B: So they do have some sort of performance measurements. So the government Accounting organization or whatever.
00:36:28.464 - 00:36:31.994, Speaker F: Has these performance metrics that they use.
00:36:32.032 - 00:36:37.820, Speaker B: And the performance metrics are not necessarily based purely on actions taken.
00:36:38.430 - 00:36:48.574, Speaker F: They're also based on how much amount extracted per unit enforcement. And I feel like they just have.
00:36:48.612 - 00:36:59.166, Speaker B: Chosen really bad KPIs and you have this good heart slot thing where it's actually much easier to optimize those KPIs by not actually improving your technical capability.
00:36:59.358 - 00:37:01.058, Speaker F: And instead making videos.
00:37:01.224 - 00:37:04.674, Speaker B: And so I generally think that's the problem.
00:37:04.792 - 00:37:07.122, Speaker F: The metrics are just fucked up for these.
00:37:07.256 - 00:37:14.054, Speaker C: I think that's probably right. It feels to me like if you have two weeks, the way to try to reform the SEC is basically you.
00:37:14.092 - 00:37:16.070, Speaker D: Get like a CTO for the SEC.
00:37:16.220 - 00:37:17.846, Speaker C: And that CTO is now heading the.
00:37:17.868 - 00:37:20.934, Speaker D: Organization and you basically say, like, look.
00:37:20.972 - 00:37:26.694, Speaker C: We'Re going to take a quarter. It's kind of like a tech company, right? In a quarter, you might say like, look, we're so deep in tech debt.
00:37:26.822 - 00:37:29.238, Speaker D: We need to freeze the feature roadmap.
00:37:29.334 - 00:37:37.486, Speaker C: And just go pay down technical debt. And that feels like probably what the SEC needs to do is create a more systematic way to do what they do. Now, of course, crypto is a small.
00:37:37.508 - 00:37:38.622, Speaker D: Part of what they do, right?
00:37:38.676 - 00:37:41.742, Speaker C: Obviously, financial markets are friggin massive, especially in the US.
00:37:41.876 - 00:37:44.666, Speaker D: And they need to regulate an enormous.
00:37:44.698 - 00:37:52.866, Speaker C: Surface area beyond just crypto. But this feels like not just a crypto thing, right? This is like a kind of broader thing of how can you systematize what you're doing in a way that's not.
00:37:52.888 - 00:37:56.514, Speaker D: Just basically headline chasing, which is easy.
00:37:56.552 - 00:38:01.030, Speaker C: To do, but not great at actually creating the right kind of norms around how markets function.
00:38:01.180 - 00:38:36.226, Speaker B: So an interesting thing about Reg NMS, which is regulation neutral market service, which is the main US regulation that ensures that prices you get on US equities across multiple different venues. So like NYSE, Nasdaq, Bats, Philadelphia Exchange, whatever, are guaranteed to give you the national best bid and offer. So this kind of forces this notion of synchronization of prices across the US. And part of the reason this law actually even ended up being enabled was that there was this trading firm that.
00:38:36.248 - 00:38:46.118, Speaker F: Kind of didn't do that well as a trading firm, but then basically sold a lot of their analysis tools they were using for trading to the SEC.
00:38:46.204 - 00:38:48.070, Speaker B: It was called tradeworks, I think.
00:38:48.140 - 00:38:49.190, Speaker F: WRX.
00:38:49.770 - 00:38:54.920, Speaker B: And after that they got a lot better at finding spoofing. You can see like the spoofing and working.
00:38:55.290 - 00:38:58.498, Speaker F: So it's very clear that the genslers.
00:38:58.514 - 00:39:07.146, Speaker B: Of the world are not particularly good at figuring out how to make that jump, right? Like SEC got lucky in 2006 where that failed trading firm, they were able.
00:39:07.168 - 00:39:10.438, Speaker F: To acquire basically the assets for pretty cheap.
00:39:10.534 - 00:39:20.254, Speaker B: I think it was like $8 million, which is like less than they spend on anything technology wise. You can see the contracts, right?
00:39:20.292 - 00:39:22.366, Speaker F: So I'm just trying to point out.
00:39:22.388 - 00:39:24.858, Speaker B: That that would be my dictatorial bend.
00:39:24.954 - 00:39:27.178, Speaker C: Especially as crypto continues to evolve, becomes.
00:39:27.194 - 00:39:34.718, Speaker D: More complex, becomes more difficult to wrap your head around, it requires more technology in order to really engage with it.
00:39:34.724 - 00:39:43.238, Speaker C: Serious, actually. Well, let's move on a bit from the SEC because I feel like I don't want this to be the regulatory show, although obviously there was some regulatory news this week.
00:39:43.324 - 00:39:44.946, Speaker D: So there are a couple of stories.
00:39:44.978 - 00:39:54.614, Speaker C: That I want to get to that I thought were very interesting. First, I want to start with Tyler Hobbes's new $17 million QQL collection. There was a really interesting story that got a lot of Twitter up in arms.
00:39:54.662 - 00:39:57.274, Speaker D: So we've talked before about royalties and.
00:39:57.312 - 00:40:10.846, Speaker C: About some of the new NFT exchanges that are no longer respecting royalties. And I think Laura and I, you and I have scrapped a little bit about this concept of NFT royalties. One of the most notable exchanges that don't respect royalties is X two Y.
00:40:10.868 - 00:40:12.922, Speaker D: Two, which is this kind of Chinese.
00:40:12.986 - 00:40:21.554, Speaker C: Team that is building a very similar to looks rare type exchange for NFTs. And this is one of the first times we've seen this.
00:40:21.592 - 00:40:36.694, Speaker D: So QQL basically decided in their own code base to blacklist X two Y two from being able to list QQL NFTs. And so this is kind of the first instance of reverse censorship where the.
00:40:36.732 - 00:40:42.870, Speaker C: NFT collection is censoring the exchange and it's saying, no exchange. You cannot trade our NFT collection.
00:40:42.950 - 00:40:45.786, Speaker D: Now you could wrap QQL and then.
00:40:45.808 - 00:40:49.434, Speaker C: Take like a wrapped QQL NFT and then go put it on x two Y two, I guess.
00:40:49.552 - 00:40:51.610, Speaker F: Do you remember this happened with penguins?
00:40:51.950 - 00:40:52.534, Speaker D: Of course.
00:40:52.592 - 00:41:10.174, Speaker C: Yeah, the penguins were wrapped, so it's possible to do it. But it's an interesting development where now you have to be nice to the issuer if you want them to not delist you basically as an exchange. You can imagine the way this evolves.
00:41:10.222 - 00:41:14.114, Speaker D: Is like, basically the NFT collection is.
00:41:14.152 - 00:41:32.194, Speaker C: Like, hey, OpenSea, if you want to trade my NFT, you better pay me upfront. Otherwise I'm going to blacklist you from being able to list my assets. So it's almost like a new backdoor for NFT collections to be able to basically negotiate some of the rent that NFT marketplaces are capturing.
00:41:32.322 - 00:41:33.738, Speaker D: I don't know, what do you guys think about that?
00:41:33.744 - 00:41:36.330, Speaker B: I mean, I think this just makes sure that royalties don't go to zero.
00:41:36.400 - 00:41:39.046, Speaker F: For the highest end promoters.
00:41:39.158 - 00:42:01.026, Speaker B: It's a little bit like the art market, right? If you're like Larry Gagosian, you're probably paying a huge markup to the hot artists today. But then for new artists, you're not getting anything. This is like exactly the same behavior of the art market, of the fee structure is bespoke and not transparent as.
00:42:01.048 - 00:42:02.578, Speaker F: To why it is that.
00:42:02.744 - 00:42:05.346, Speaker B: But at least here, I guess, you see the royalty, you can see the.
00:42:05.368 - 00:42:07.042, Speaker F: Fees in the art market.
00:42:07.096 - 00:42:11.430, Speaker B: You can't. This type of price discrimination does exist.
00:42:12.250 - 00:42:49.486, Speaker A: It is weird too, that the blacklist is also updatable by the owner of the contract. And so I think there's always this tension with NFTs of just like how sort of permanent is this? Is the metadata stored in IPFS? Is the image stored in IPFS or is this like a link to S three somewhere? And this feels like a big step towards no, this is just like a JPEG on someone's servers and that the owner can basically step in forever and blacklist transfers or transferees, which feels a bit, I don't know, kind of strange and sort of antithetical to what NFTs.
00:42:49.518 - 00:42:52.910, Speaker F: Are supposed to be about. It's the USDC of NFTs.
00:42:53.070 - 00:43:07.046, Speaker C: It ties into that magic Eden thing. I can't remember what it's called, like ghost or something, where basically if you traded an NFT in a way that did not respect the royalties, that they would basically tombstone your NFT such that.
00:43:07.068 - 00:43:12.200, Speaker D: It showed up as hey, you didn't pay your royalty thing.
00:43:14.030 - 00:43:23.534, Speaker C: If you've arrived at this page an error, please email support or something. It's like, wow, holy shit, we really are moving pretty far away from the original concept of okay, this is like.
00:43:23.572 - 00:43:27.054, Speaker D: A permissionless artifact on the blockchain now.
00:43:27.092 - 00:43:34.286, Speaker C: It's like, okay, the NFT issuer is policing every single instance of a transfer of this NFT to figure out whether.
00:43:34.308 - 00:43:38.020, Speaker D: Or not you paid your toll as you're crossing the toll road.
00:43:38.710 - 00:43:53.958, Speaker C: It seems like we're moving in a very weird direction as the NFT issuers are really trying to hold on to their grasp over royalties in mean, laura, you and I have argued about this before. This feels to me like a super unstable equilibrium, right?
00:43:54.044 - 00:43:55.734, Speaker D: In the long run, the whole point.
00:43:55.772 - 00:44:02.870, Speaker C: Of NFTs is that they're permissionless is that they are open, is that anybody can do whatever they want. Which means that you cannot force people to do something if they don't want to do it.
00:44:02.940 - 00:44:04.150, Speaker D: And so you can try.
00:44:04.220 - 00:44:11.210, Speaker C: This feels very much like the record labels being like you can't share music because I want to. Like, no, it's just not allowed.
00:44:11.290 - 00:44:12.366, Speaker D: Even though I gave you an MP3.
00:44:12.388 - 00:44:17.118, Speaker C: You can't give it to anyone. In the long run, your business model just has to adapt to the fact that people are going to do what.
00:44:17.124 - 00:44:18.014, Speaker D: People are going to do.
00:44:18.132 - 00:44:28.734, Speaker C: And you can try this policing stuff and say, okay, well I'm going to look through to your transactions and try to figure out if that was just a transfer to a multi SEG or an OTC sale behind the veil.
00:44:28.782 - 00:44:30.274, Speaker F: I mean, end of the day, the.
00:44:30.312 - 00:44:45.110, Speaker B: Point of crypto is that you can make infinite derivatives and you can make derivatives basically means that this type of thing is going to be like yes, there's going to be couple. People like Tyler Hobbs who are know fine the Van Gogh of the last.
00:44:45.260 - 00:44:48.200, Speaker F: Year artist gets to get away with.
00:44:48.890 - 00:44:57.254, Speaker B: Like everyone else is just going to there's going to be someone who just makes a wrapping service. And ironically, the wrapping service might get more usage than every single NFT derivative.
00:44:57.302 - 00:45:01.420, Speaker F: That exists on chain because it's just a way to get around all this stuff.
00:45:03.470 - 00:45:08.366, Speaker B: If I were someone who was doing NFT derivatives. I would actually just go stop and go build a wrapping thing and be.
00:45:08.388 - 00:45:10.094, Speaker F: Like, look, I'm a man.
00:45:10.132 - 00:45:12.074, Speaker B: The people fuck these fucking artists.
00:45:12.122 - 00:45:12.494, Speaker D: Keep them.
00:45:12.532 - 00:45:17.262, Speaker C: That's the problem. You can't have just one wrapping service because that one wrapping service is going to get blocked.
00:45:17.406 - 00:45:18.626, Speaker D: Just like the way that X two.
00:45:18.648 - 00:45:19.790, Speaker C: Y two got blocked.
00:45:19.950 - 00:45:25.870, Speaker B: There's going to be many of them. They're just going to basically constitute totally.
00:45:25.950 - 00:45:58.560, Speaker E: Yeah, but you guys so you guys are all crypto investors. You're like VC people. And VCs tend to be the people who at the beginning of some kind of new crypto concept, they're out there being the salesman and saying, oh, this is what makes this new development so great. And one of the selling points of NFTs that you guys were shilling to the world was like, oh, hey, creators, they can get royalties on resales of their creations. And now that this has become a thing, now you're like, Nah, we're going to pull that back.
00:45:59.170 - 00:46:10.126, Speaker C: To be clear, I never said any of that about royalties. I think royalties were cool while they were being enforced. But again, royalties were totally opt in. Royalties were not designed on the blockchain to be enforced.
00:46:10.238 - 00:46:12.286, Speaker D: They were a suggestion.
00:46:12.478 - 00:46:19.860, Speaker B: I do also think you're painting all capital papill markets participants with a single brush stroke, which is a bit like.
00:46:21.610 - 00:46:26.002, Speaker C: Well, how could you treat us like we're all the same just because we're VCs? How incredible.
00:46:26.066 - 00:46:27.446, Speaker E: Not all VCs is.
00:46:27.468 - 00:46:31.240, Speaker C: That exactly I was starting that hashtag right now.
00:46:32.350 - 00:46:45.066, Speaker B: I'm just pointing out, first of all, I think most NFTs are dog shit. And I hate NFTs for this reason because it's just like, it's been this kind of like scam narrative for certain venture capitalists to raise these weird funds.
00:46:45.178 - 00:46:50.270, Speaker F: Built around creator economy, like bubble stuff.
00:46:50.420 - 00:46:56.766, Speaker B: DeFi is really the only thing I think is actually like a real innovation in this space. NFTs are just, okay, I don't agree with that.
00:46:56.788 - 00:47:19.462, Speaker C: I don't agree with that. But yeah, but here's what I will say. Here's what I will say. Here's what I will say is that there's always these two forces in crypto between crypto. The term crypto traditionally is kind of a right wing term, right? It sort of skews, like, okay, hyper capitalist, hyper anarchist, or anarcho capitalist, really libertarian kind of feeling, right?
00:47:19.516 - 00:47:22.902, Speaker D: And the term web Three, it points.
00:47:22.956 - 00:47:48.114, Speaker C: To the same stuff, but it's kind of the liberal version. It's more socialist. It's more like, oh, we're reinventing the web, we're giving power back to the people. That kind of thing, right? Crypto always has both elements, and those two elements are always intention. And in NFTs, you see those two concepts. Like, one concept is, okay, these are just pure financializing anything in the world, and allowing it to be traded instantly and in a totally unregulatable, unstoppable way. That's like the crypto element and the Web three element is like, oh, well.
00:47:48.152 - 00:47:49.938, Speaker D: But you have these royalties and the.
00:47:49.944 - 00:47:54.894, Speaker C: Creators are getting paid and it's like all very kumbaya and everyone is helping everyone and it's wonderful.
00:47:55.022 - 00:47:58.706, Speaker D: And these two things are always fighting each other, right?
00:47:58.888 - 00:48:08.546, Speaker C: They don't just kind of sit here and nothing changes. There's always a tension. And that tension is fought over in every part of crypto, whether it's in DeFi, whether it's in layer ones or layer twos, about like, oh, public goods.
00:48:08.578 - 00:48:10.598, Speaker D: Funding, but like, oh no, it's a.
00:48:10.604 - 00:48:16.426, Speaker C: Bear market, so never mind, we're not going to do public goods funding, we're just going to try to pump the token. In the long run, you cannot fight.
00:48:16.528 - 00:48:20.314, Speaker D: The evolution of markets, right? Markets evolve over time.
00:48:20.432 - 00:48:36.466, Speaker C: They don't stay the same, they don't stand still. And in a time when everyone's getting paid, everyone's making tons of money, NFTs are all going up. It's all one big party. It's very easy to be very Kumbaya and say, okay, great. NFTs are both this capitalist hyper innovation where everyone makes ton of money, but.
00:48:36.488 - 00:48:40.258, Speaker D: It'S also this socialist wonderland when you.
00:48:40.264 - 00:48:53.650, Speaker C: Get into a bear market and all of a sudden people are feeling poor and everyone's losing money and all these exchanges are in this massive mad dash for market share. Yeah, there are going to be some people who are going to say, look, I don't want to do royalties. They're not enforced at the smart contract layer.
00:48:53.730 - 00:48:57.798, Speaker D: I don't think they're required and competition forces that to happen.
00:48:57.964 - 00:49:29.122, Speaker E: Yeah, but where I would disagree with you is like, you keep saying that when creators get royalties, then it's like a kumbaya socialist thing. But I would say, no, that's a capitalist thing. That's them being entrepreneurial. And this is what this person is doing. They're saying like, hey, you can't trade this without giving me my royalty because I'm a business person and I created this. And the more that it gets traded, that shows that there's value in it and I should get a piece of that because it's my creation and the value comes from what created. And this actually goes back when we discussed this before.
00:49:29.122 - 00:50:08.906, Speaker E: I afterward wanted to ask Tom, because Tom was like, oh, I feel like at a certain point, let's board API Club becomes super successful. And he was just like, oh, it just seems ridiculous that they should make money on every single trade after a certain point. So I would ask you a question for some of these things that you've invested in, would you say like, oh, they should only make a certain amount of money and then after that they shouldn't make anymore, like the more successful they are, then at a certain point they shouldn't? That's right. Which is why is it that you're saying for creators, if they get to a certain point of success that then they shouldn't make any more off of the trade?
00:50:09.018 - 00:50:10.366, Speaker D: It doesn't make any sense.
00:50:10.548 - 00:50:16.370, Speaker C: Yes, it does, because what I am saying is that right now, the enforcement.
00:50:17.110 - 00:50:19.138, Speaker D: Of royalties is a norm.
00:50:19.304 - 00:50:21.858, Speaker C: It is not enforced in any way. Creators can't enforce it.
00:50:21.864 - 00:50:25.378, Speaker E: That's the whole norms I'm talking about.
00:50:25.544 - 00:50:40.806, Speaker A: I see what Laura's saying. Let's say we could snap our fingers and make it enforced. My point is, companies require additional labor and capital to keep running, right? So it's like, naturally, they should be able to pay for themselves because they're performing additional labors, additional costs. I think of a little bit actually.
00:50:40.828 - 00:50:41.974, Speaker D: More like copyright, right?
00:50:42.012 - 00:51:20.002, Speaker A: Like copyright laws in the US are like, what? The artist's death plus 70 years? That seems a little bit more insane to me. The fact that you can have a legal monopoly on a concept even well past when the artist is dead, that, to my mind, doesn't seem right. And I think that's kind of more how I think about royalties, where it's like, this work has existed and yet you get to keep basically taking fees in perpetuity. But it's also obviously something that has come up with DeFi projects as well, right? Which is like, why does this exchange get to just keep taking five bits? Why do token holders get to keep taking five bits forever? It feels more like rent peaking versus.
00:51:20.146 - 00:51:44.422, Speaker C: I understand the point you're making, Tom, but it feels very distinct from the point that Laura's making, which is that why isn't it unfair to say, okay, most companies get to keep the perpetual revenues of what they create, except creators. Creators have to get jipped by all these exchanges. The reason why I don't think that is a legitimate counterpoint is because why was it in the first place that these royalties were being paid to the artists?
00:51:44.486 - 00:51:46.766, Speaker D: Right? It's not because the artists asked for it.
00:51:46.868 - 00:51:52.506, Speaker C: It's because OpenSea decided to respect it. Right? OpenSea just decided, hey, this is kind of cool. It's part of the ethos of crypto.
00:51:52.538 - 00:51:56.420, Speaker D: So we're going to do it when other exchanges decide not to do.
00:51:57.110 - 00:52:01.262, Speaker C: Like, from the beginning of how these NFTs were designed, it was not enforced.
00:52:01.406 - 00:52:06.274, Speaker D: Which means that you're at a software, you could create NFTs that enforce this.
00:52:06.312 - 00:52:14.034, Speaker C: At a contract level. Right. That's what Terra is doing. People are talking about how ridiculous Terra is because of the fact that Terra is forcing a tax on every single transfer of Terra.
00:52:14.082 - 00:52:14.486, Speaker D: Right.
00:52:14.588 - 00:52:22.282, Speaker C: That is obviously absurd and ridiculous, but that is the equivalent of how you do it by enforcing it at the business level or the contract level.
00:52:22.336 - 00:52:22.746, Speaker D: Right.
00:52:22.848 - 00:52:36.794, Speaker C: Binance does not make a suggestion that, hey, could you please pay me fees every time you transact on Binance and don't withdraw your full balance? Right? No, they take the fee because that's their fucking business. That's how it works. There's no suggestion within Binance of like, hey, please pay me fees.
00:52:36.922 - 00:52:38.794, Speaker D: With NFTs, it was always a suggestion.
00:52:38.842 - 00:52:41.822, Speaker C: It's not enforced. And so if it's not enforced when.
00:52:41.876 - 00:52:44.286, Speaker D: Somebody builds a business that doesn't take.
00:52:44.308 - 00:52:48.414, Speaker C: That into consideration and you say, oh my God, you're ruining the value proposition of NFTs.
00:52:48.462 - 00:52:52.738, Speaker D: It's like, well, you guys just decided to do this, right?
00:52:52.824 - 00:52:55.454, Speaker C: If you want to enforce something, you need to create a mechanism that enforces.
00:52:55.502 - 00:52:57.286, Speaker D: It as opposed to just, we're going.
00:52:57.288 - 00:52:58.146, Speaker C: To be mad at you on Twitter.
00:52:58.178 - 00:52:58.870, Speaker D: If you don't do it.
00:52:58.940 - 00:53:21.306, Speaker E: So I have a question for you. If we were to imagine a world where there were no royalties for resales, then you think that it would make total sense if the creator only made however much they made in the initial sale, and then if the project became much more popular later, that they wouldn't reap any rewards from that? You think that that would be totally do that.
00:53:21.328 - 00:53:35.326, Speaker C: Okay, so two things. Laura, we talked about this a few episodes ago, right? If you don't allow resales, that means that you are going to capture or sorry, not if you don't allow resales. If you don't capture rent in the resales, you don't tax the resales, then.
00:53:35.428 - 00:53:37.326, Speaker D: The NFT will sell for more upfront.
00:53:37.438 - 00:53:40.302, Speaker C: Because the person who's buying it keeps more of the value as it grows.
00:53:40.366 - 00:53:40.980, Speaker D: Right.
00:53:41.670 - 00:53:43.822, Speaker C: This is basic kind of economics.
00:53:43.966 - 00:53:45.154, Speaker D: The other thing that you can do.
00:53:45.192 - 00:53:48.258, Speaker C: If you want to capture some of the upside is don't sell everything.
00:53:48.344 - 00:53:49.458, Speaker D: That's what Labs did, right?
00:53:49.464 - 00:53:54.898, Speaker C: Yuga. Labs held back some of their crypto punks. Crypto punks went up a lot and they were able to profit by selling.
00:53:54.914 - 00:53:56.198, Speaker D: More crypto punks later.
00:53:56.364 - 00:54:04.518, Speaker C: There's a very easy solution to the idea of like, hey, I want to capture some of the eventual upside. Just don't sell it all. Just keep some on your balance sheet until you actually want to sell it.
00:54:04.524 - 00:54:05.960, Speaker D: Into where the market's at.
00:54:06.330 - 00:54:31.140, Speaker A: I feel like you guys are talking over each other a little bit. I mean, I think A, that doesn't work for one of one collections. I think Laura's saying philosophically, let's say we could snap our fingers and design a system where royalties are mandatory, like on right, for transfers. Do you agree with the idea that artists should be entitled to this versus Steve saying technically that's not possible, so where is the market going to net out? And I think those are like two different questions.
00:54:31.510 - 00:54:32.354, Speaker C: That's a fair point.
00:54:32.392 - 00:54:32.690, Speaker D: Right.
00:54:32.760 - 00:54:42.178, Speaker C: Practically speaking, it's very difficult to imagine how you could enforce this at a smart contract level without doing something ridiculous like what Terra is doing. If you were to do that, let's say you were to do what Terra.
00:54:42.194 - 00:54:46.758, Speaker D: Was doing, then I would say, okay, fair game. You design this to enforce this tax.
00:54:46.924 - 00:54:48.486, Speaker C: And people who buy it get to.
00:54:48.508 - 00:54:52.874, Speaker D: Decide what their options the thing there.
00:54:52.912 - 00:54:54.678, Speaker B: That'S different though, is that the validators.
00:54:54.694 - 00:54:57.546, Speaker F: Are the ones basically getting paid to.
00:54:57.568 - 00:55:00.218, Speaker B: Enforce the contract that the fees are taken.
00:55:00.304 - 00:55:01.034, Speaker F: Right.
00:55:01.232 - 00:55:03.194, Speaker B: It's quite a bit different than just.
00:55:03.232 - 00:55:04.894, Speaker F: Like the IMA application.
00:55:05.012 - 00:55:07.214, Speaker B: And this always gets back to this problem of like.
00:55:07.332 - 00:55:08.314, Speaker F: In crypto.
00:55:08.442 - 00:55:24.834, Speaker B: Unlike normal computing, we don't have a very clean separation between sort of like the base thing running things and the application. And the end user might think the application is the same as the base thing. I bet you 90% of Openc users don't know the difference between Ethereum and Openc. They kind of think they're the same.
00:55:24.872 - 00:55:26.706, Speaker F: Thing, which is fair, right?
00:55:26.728 - 00:55:39.618, Speaker B: Like they watch some fucking TikTok video that was like how to get rich off NFTs and then they downloaded MetaMask and that's all they guess. The reason I guess I feel like.
00:55:39.724 - 00:55:45.350, Speaker F: This royalty thing is so contentious to some extent is A, the application layer.
00:55:45.430 - 00:55:53.146, Speaker B: Cannot actually enforce a lot of things on its own and B, the base layer is not meant to enforce these kinds of specialty rights.
00:55:53.258 - 00:55:55.406, Speaker F: And so I think it's great when.
00:55:55.428 - 00:55:57.466, Speaker B: You'Re an artist, if you're Tyler Hobbes.
00:55:57.578 - 00:56:01.518, Speaker F: Kudos and good for you, go ahead.
00:56:01.604 - 00:56:06.286, Speaker B: Do whatever the fuck you want. You're basically like people are still buying your shit even in the worst part.
00:56:06.308 - 00:56:07.358, Speaker F: Of the market for you.
00:56:07.444 - 00:56:08.642, Speaker B: I just think that this is like.
00:56:08.696 - 00:56:11.454, Speaker F: The 1% problem of NFTs.
00:56:11.502 - 00:56:17.554, Speaker B: It's only going to be the highest value ones who are ever going to even be able to do this. The average shit salon NFT, they're never.
00:56:17.592 - 00:56:20.406, Speaker F: Going to be able to have enough pricing power to do this.
00:56:20.588 - 00:56:34.570, Speaker A: I actually just had a great idea. When you're talking about stack separation, I think really something that would make everybody happy is we introduce a new Mev Boost relay that blocks transactions that don't pay artists royalties. Everyone mad.
00:56:37.310 - 00:56:42.446, Speaker B: I think everyone working at Flashbots has had a very stressful couple months and.
00:56:42.548 - 00:56:45.246, Speaker F: That would have made them have a.
00:56:45.348 - 00:56:52.186, Speaker B: Way more stressful couple months because they would have the NFT degens mad at them on top of just the layer.
00:56:52.218 - 00:56:55.198, Speaker F: One Politicos and the NFT Djens seem.
00:56:55.214 - 00:56:56.930, Speaker B: Much worse to get angry.
00:56:57.430 - 00:56:58.622, Speaker D: That's hilarious.
00:56:58.766 - 00:57:14.310, Speaker C: Well, okay, let's wrap up the last story. After the merge, there's been a lot of drama around Flashbots in particular because of how much market share Flashbots has when it comes to block building. So right now, let me see tom, do you have actually the stats of.
00:57:14.380 - 00:57:17.910, Speaker D: What the current numbers are for Flashbots?
00:57:18.330 - 00:57:21.740, Speaker A: I just did. I think it is around 40%.
00:57:22.190 - 00:57:25.254, Speaker E: Yeah, that's what I saw most recently on Twitter.
00:57:25.382 - 00:58:01.734, Speaker C: Basically a huge portion of the blocks generated on proof of stake are now being generated by Flashbots. And this is causing a lot of handwriting within the Ethereum community. It's also causing a lot of handwriting at Flashbots. They're kind of in many ways a victim of their own success. It feels like a very much analogous to what was happening when a lot of these bitcoin mining pools were getting really huge and people were starting to get very nervous about decentralization. Flashbots of course is a little bit different than actually controlling, quote unquote hash rate or controlling stake per se. But it does mean that a lot of the software that is being run is basically depending on one particular third.
00:58:01.772 - 00:58:04.018, Speaker D: Party for a lot of the blocks.
00:58:04.034 - 00:58:08.322, Speaker C: That are being built on Ethereum and of course the mev that's being extracted on Ethereum.
00:58:08.386 - 00:58:11.890, Speaker D: Any perspectives on what's going on with the Flashbots?
00:58:11.970 - 00:59:08.634, Speaker E: Well, a couple of things. So I know tarune, you're close to that team, so I'm not going to pretend to be like some MVV expert or anything, but I did a show about this this summer, and I did some preliminary interviews beforehand. And when I was learning about it, I just was like, it seems like flashbots is a centralizing force in ethereum. That was kind of one of my takeaways. And then it sort of felt like almost like a taboo thing to say out loud or something. And then of course, when the Tornado sanctions thing happened and then they were like, oh shit, we're going to open source our relay code, because we realized that we should have more relays and there should be other options. It sort of just feels like, I don't know, it just feels like if you'd been kind of investigating it, it would have been kind of obvious that that was a risk and then suddenly when this outside event happens, it highlights that.
00:59:08.634 - 00:59:18.270, Speaker E: But it just was surprising to me that they didn't realize it before or that people didn't call it out before because that was kind of one of the things that I noticed when I was researching it.
00:59:18.340 - 00:59:49.586, Speaker C: I don't think that people didn't call out before. So by the way, quick disclosure. So actually all of us are investors into Flashbots, both Dragonfly and Robot, so we know the team reasonably well. I think people who are kind of close to the mev world are always aware that Flashbots had a huge amount of influence and a large effect on what was going on with respect to Ethereum blocks. It's just more obvious now post merge, with just the growing dominance of mev boost and the fact that Ethereum issuance.
00:59:49.618 - 00:59:54.086, Speaker D: Is a lot lower. So a larger portion of block rewards are mev.
00:59:54.198 - 01:00:03.258, Speaker E: Yeah, but I feel like if anybody had just thought through all the steps like what this is going to look like post merge, you could have figured that out before. Like you didn't actually need the merge to have.
01:00:03.344 - 01:00:14.186, Speaker B: There were definitely people who are angry about it, let's put it that way. I would say that there's a large discourse on it, but of course it was only amongst the people reading the technical docs, so of course that was.
01:00:14.228 - 01:00:17.266, Speaker F: 10% of the addressable market of people.
01:00:17.368 - 01:00:29.862, Speaker B: But yeah, all the other block builders were like, if you follow the Rook Twitter every day, keeper Dow was taking like a shot at Flashbots and giving an argument for it or block trout or whatever.
01:00:29.996 - 01:00:32.322, Speaker F: Every single one of the other builders.
01:00:32.386 - 01:00:37.438, Speaker B: Has been saying this for months. It's just that you have to remember the historical context that led to Flashbots.
01:00:37.554 - 01:00:43.766, Speaker F: Ethereum was definitely getting destroyed in parts.
01:00:43.798 - 01:00:58.666, Speaker B: Of 2019 because people were just spamming the public mempool to do all these backgrounding attacks and front running attacks. It became unusable for a lot of average users because 90% of the block would be someone sending the same transaction.
01:00:58.698 - 01:01:05.586, Speaker F: 100 times and then no one else could get into the block. And so this was meant to be.
01:01:05.608 - 01:01:07.378, Speaker B: A way of moving that sort of.
01:01:07.464 - 01:01:13.986, Speaker F: Bid sniping off chain so that it's not clogging the entire block for the.
01:01:14.008 - 01:01:14.766, Speaker B: Rest of the users.
01:01:14.798 - 01:01:17.606, Speaker F: Now naturally such a thing will have.
01:01:17.628 - 01:01:29.926, Speaker B: Some centralization effect, but also naturally in the same way that a mining pool operator or staking pool operator controls the pending transactions that they send to all the staker miners that are subscribed to.
01:01:29.948 - 01:01:31.850, Speaker F: That, you will also have a similar.
01:01:31.920 - 01:01:42.846, Speaker B: Sort of centralizing force. So the question here was like, do we go for some notion of welfare optimization? Like we want the welfare of all users who want to get into a block to go up or do we.
01:01:42.868 - 01:01:47.994, Speaker F: Want sort of a pure decentralization argument?
01:01:48.042 - 01:01:50.190, Speaker B: And so that was the original reason.
01:01:50.260 - 01:01:58.434, Speaker F: The Flash Voice 2.0 paper was sort of pointed this out 2019, right?
01:01:58.472 - 01:02:05.140, Speaker E: But at this point, I sort of feel like the incentives are it's like a tragedy of the commons kind of situation.
01:02:05.510 - 01:02:07.734, Speaker F: What, what's the alternative right now?
01:02:07.852 - 01:02:32.598, Speaker E: Yeah, because the reason why the percentage keeps going up and up is because it's more profitable for them to use that. And so I feel like people will have to be sacrificial. They'll be like, oh, I'm not going to do something that's financially in my own interest to keep Ethereum decentralized. But then you're always going to get the people that are going to be freeloaders and be like, oh, well, I'm just going to make more money. I don't care if it's centralized.
01:02:32.774 - 01:02:40.910, Speaker C: To be clear, that was also true of the mining pools, right, back in the day when the mining pool, I can't remember which mining pool it was that had 50% mining pool market share.
01:02:40.980 - 01:02:43.498, Speaker D: The reason why was because they were the most profitable.
01:02:43.674 - 01:02:55.574, Speaker C: Most miners don't actually care, right? They're just pointing their lasers at whatever's giving them the most satoshis per hash. So most people are just going to be like, yeah, whatever. And when the cris this basically gets.
01:02:55.612 - 01:02:58.098, Speaker D: Bad enough that's when the market starts.
01:02:58.114 - 01:03:03.666, Speaker C: To self regulate by the staker at the margin basically says, you know what, I'm going to stop running Flashbots.
01:03:03.698 - 01:03:05.078, Speaker D: Now, it's not every single person is.
01:03:05.084 - 01:03:16.246, Speaker C: Going to do that, but a few people are going to say, you know what, I'm going to stop relying on Flashbots because it feels like their block preparation ratio is too high. They're going to start relying on some of the other block builders and slowly it's going to self regulate.
01:03:16.278 - 01:03:18.746, Speaker D: But it requires this political activity actually.
01:03:18.768 - 01:03:24.282, Speaker C: To take place, right? Like the conversation that's happening on Twitter of people being mad and people saying like, hey, this is bad for Ethereum.
01:03:24.346 - 01:03:26.222, Speaker D: Exact same thing that happened in Bitcoin, right?
01:03:26.276 - 01:03:28.222, Speaker C: It took a while, but eventually people.
01:03:28.276 - 01:03:31.406, Speaker D: Start caring more politically about what's going.
01:03:31.428 - 01:03:38.638, Speaker C: On and that causes people to change their behavior. So I think from my perspective, in a way, what Flashbots is, is it's.
01:03:38.654 - 01:03:41.490, Speaker D: Trading off centralization for efficiency.
01:03:41.910 - 01:03:54.326, Speaker C: And there are times when you have to do that in the development of a protocol. And Flashbots is always looking, if you talk to the team, right, they're always looking forward to like, okay, eventually PBS is going to be enshrined in the protocol. It's not going to be like them.
01:03:54.348 - 01:03:57.414, Speaker D: Running our crap in a sidecar to.
01:03:57.452 - 01:03:58.774, Speaker C: Guess as it is today.
01:03:58.892 - 01:04:02.106, Speaker D: But we're not there yet, right? We're not at that point where the.
01:04:02.128 - 01:04:04.310, Speaker C: Flashbots architecture is basically in protocol.
01:04:04.390 - 01:04:08.986, Speaker D: And until then, Flashbots is like kind of emulating that final state of what.
01:04:09.008 - 01:04:21.610, Speaker C: Ethereum is going to look like and that incurs some degree of centralization. The thing is, like, Flashbots just they're good at what they do. They're a good block builder. And if you're good at what you do, you're going to get more market share. The same way that these mining pools.
01:04:21.690 - 01:04:23.326, Speaker D: That were better than anybody else were.
01:04:23.348 - 01:04:24.926, Speaker C: Just gaining tons and tons of market share.
01:04:25.028 - 01:04:27.086, Speaker D: So this will regulate, but it requires.
01:04:27.118 - 01:04:28.402, Speaker C: Us to have this debate in public.
01:04:28.456 - 01:04:34.402, Speaker B: Yeah. And for the record, right, there's no known technical solution to any of this.
01:04:34.456 - 01:04:36.086, Speaker F: That exists right now.
01:04:36.188 - 01:05:03.882, Speaker B: So PBS stands for Proposer Builder Separation. The proposer is the person who the stake distribution. You assume there's some sort of oracle that's able to sample which person's stake gets used for the next block. The proposer has to pick blocks that are built by other people. So you can think of the proposer as sort of an auctioneer. You can think of the block builders as people bidding for like, here are the transactions you should get in a block and whoever is able to pack.
01:05:03.936 - 01:05:06.046, Speaker F: The block the best and get sort.
01:05:06.068 - 01:05:10.026, Speaker B: Of like the highest revenue split between the proposer and builder usually wins.
01:05:10.138 - 01:05:23.646, Speaker E: Right? But that was the other thing is when I realized that Ethereum was going to move to PBS, I was like, how is that also not centralizing? Because the builders, there's probably going to be some builder that becomes more dominant that is just better at packing the block.
01:05:23.678 - 01:05:49.654, Speaker B: Capitalism, though, I don't see how you get around that. That's an understanding of the actual execution of these contracts correctly and being like, oh, this particular type of transaction flow has this type of transaction stream. I'm willing to subsidize it this much to get it in. This other type of transaction stream has very spiky flow and I can't subsidize it as much and whoever's the best at constructing that portfolio is going to be the best blockbuilder. The fact that it's open is different than normal finance.
01:05:49.702 - 01:05:50.010, Speaker D: Right?
01:05:50.080 - 01:06:15.570, Speaker B: In normal finance you actually can't even participate in that. But the idea that someone who's better ends up being hyper specialized. I mean, that wire jump in Alameda so large and other firms didn't grow as much last year. It sort of has the same concentration effect because it has to do with the economic value in the transactions, not the actual cryptographic content of the proofs of these transactions. And that's what I think people don't get.
01:06:15.720 - 01:06:23.990, Speaker E: But is that a risk to have that? Is that also a risky centralizing factor or force or is it not?
01:06:24.060 - 01:06:24.946, Speaker B: At the end of the day, it's.
01:06:24.978 - 01:06:26.118, Speaker F: Hard to get around it.
01:06:26.204 - 01:06:27.286, Speaker D: What's the vector you're worried about?
01:06:27.308 - 01:06:31.926, Speaker C: Right. I think that the most likely thing that you can imagine. Let's say that the most dominant block.
01:06:31.958 - 01:06:34.410, Speaker D: Builder basically prepares every freaking block.
01:06:34.910 - 01:06:48.318, Speaker C: That's sort of the degenerate case where literally no other block builder is ever competitive other than, let's say Superbuilder. And Superbuilder. Let's say they are OFAC compliant and so they will never include a transaction from an OFAC restricted country.
01:06:48.404 - 01:06:48.990, Speaker D: Right.
01:06:49.140 - 01:06:52.698, Speaker C: That can get you into a world where basically you have de facto censorship.
01:06:52.794 - 01:06:55.534, Speaker D: If this one, Superbuilder, is just so.
01:06:55.572 - 01:07:05.666, Speaker C: Good that nobody else can ever prepare a block that has anywhere near the profitability of the super builder block. Now, practically speaking, how likely is that? Not super likely, but it is, I.
01:07:05.688 - 01:07:08.606, Speaker D: Think, a possible degenerate case in a world of PBS.
01:07:08.718 - 01:07:10.226, Speaker C: But to Tarune's point, in a world.
01:07:10.248 - 01:07:12.694, Speaker D: With mev, I don't think there's any.
01:07:12.732 - 01:07:21.474, Speaker C: Real way around that. As long as there is an open market for mev, the people who are best at extracting it are going to ultimately be able to win the block think.
01:07:21.532 - 01:07:25.946, Speaker B: I think the best state equilibrium is that there are many applications, not just.
01:07:26.048 - 01:07:32.442, Speaker F: Uniswap sandwich attacks and not just like front running mints. There are many applications competing for this.
01:07:32.576 - 01:07:47.186, Speaker B: So many that it's actually impossible to specialize in being good at all of them. And you will have builders who are really good at certain applications and building blocks when there's certain transaction volume for certain applications and the transaction volume is kind of like distributed across all of them because then it will be very.
01:07:47.208 - 01:07:49.666, Speaker F: Hard to centralize the economic value of these things.
01:07:49.768 - 01:08:12.986, Speaker B: But otherwise this is the part of cryptocurrency that I think people don't understand. They somehow think, oh yes, we use some fancy cryptography and we've avoided all these economic concentration problems and then that's just not true. This is still a capitalistic system. If you're better at understanding the information flow before a block is built and you're able to collate that into figure out expected profit and loss for you.
01:08:13.008 - 01:08:15.594, Speaker F: Faster than everyone else, then so be it.
01:08:15.712 - 01:08:18.554, Speaker B: That is literally on every blockchain what.
01:08:18.592 - 01:08:22.510, Speaker F: Keeps decentralized exchanges humming.
01:08:22.850 - 01:08:45.214, Speaker E: Yeah, no, clearly crypto isn't a capitalist system. I mean, these crypto networks they're all built around incentives. So clearly that's part of what is going on here. It's just like I said when I was learning about it, I was like, wait. And it's interesting to hear your perspective since you guys have invested in all this and we'll see what happens.
01:08:45.272 - 01:08:48.360, Speaker F: There is a line of people who.
01:08:48.890 - 01:08:57.702, Speaker B: I guess I would say there's like the mev accelerationists versus the mev can be stopped by cryptographics mean camp.
01:08:57.756 - 01:08:59.590, Speaker F: And there are two very separate camps.
01:09:00.330 - 01:09:04.426, Speaker B: That can be stopped by cryptographic mean camp is kind of what are so.
01:09:04.448 - 01:09:06.294, Speaker F: Called fair ordering protocols.
01:09:06.422 - 01:09:34.494, Speaker B: None of them have ever really been built in practice and work and all of them make kind of like quite large security assumptions that are very different than a public blockchain. In fact, they either make the latency significantly worse, they rely on some fallback oracle. So the chain link arbitram version of the world is that everyone will have these Ferro sequencing things and whatever transaction gets in first, most of the time will be first. Now of course, errors, impossibility theorem means you can't do that perfectly.
01:09:34.542 - 01:09:37.074, Speaker F: So there's obviously theoretical limits to that.
01:09:37.192 - 01:09:47.970, Speaker B: But I guess the main point is the mev acceleration. This camp is like, hey, look, if we actually understand how much value is being generated, how much people's incentives are, we can design a better auction.
01:09:48.050 - 01:09:50.230, Speaker F: We can design a better auction that.
01:09:50.300 - 01:09:54.026, Speaker B: Actually is able to redistribute things, it's able to do other things with this.
01:09:54.048 - 01:09:57.126, Speaker F: Excess value such that it goes back to the users.
01:09:57.318 - 01:10:06.846, Speaker B: Whereas the fair ordering side is like, we want to just not care about what transactions are going in and what value is created. There still can be value extracted. We just want these theoretical guarantees of.
01:10:06.868 - 01:10:12.282, Speaker F: First in, first out. And that's sort of like a philosophical.
01:10:12.346 - 01:10:14.674, Speaker B: Debate that has no technical solution at.
01:10:14.712 - 01:10:17.074, Speaker F: This juncture today, in 2020.
01:10:17.272 - 01:11:02.554, Speaker E: Yeah, no, I agree that first of all, I definitely agree that the two sides are a little bit like oil and water and in some sense they actually really dislike each other, which I randomly stumbled into and did not expect when I discovered that. And I was like, whoa, whoa, whoa. Yeah, that was kind of interesting. But I agree that part of it is like a values thing. And other people have talked to me about this potential for mev to result in rebates for users, which I actually think is super interesting. And frankly, in terms of the sort of fair ordering thing, as far as I understand, Arbitram is super centralized. So even when you kind of try to minimize them, maybe it's centralized.
01:11:02.554 - 01:11:08.802, Speaker E: Anyway, I'm not a technical person, so I didn't know how to solve no.
01:11:08.936 - 01:11:10.306, Speaker B: This is the reason I kind of.
01:11:10.328 - 01:11:12.626, Speaker F: Like, why do I write the research I write?
01:11:12.728 - 01:11:21.654, Speaker B: A lot of it has to do with proving these things formally because everyone who's working on this shit doesn't seem to care about there exists some bounds to how well you can do either.
01:11:21.692 - 01:11:23.446, Speaker F: Side of this and everyone is just.
01:11:23.468 - 01:11:28.226, Speaker B: Like, kumbaya to my side, the other side sucks. But in reality, it's a very subtle.
01:11:28.258 - 01:11:30.186, Speaker F: Trade off between these two things.
01:11:30.288 - 01:11:37.766, Speaker B: And unfortunately, people's economic incentives don't let them research it. So I unfortunately, am left with that bag.
01:11:37.878 - 01:11:45.198, Speaker C: Well, we're very blessed to have you doing God's work, Tarun, and proving to people what they might know someone is.
01:11:45.204 - 01:11:50.030, Speaker B: Just that the people working on these things otherwise are incentivized to choose their camp, right?
01:11:50.100 - 01:11:53.680, Speaker F: Instead of being neutral about it.
01:11:54.210 - 01:11:55.006, Speaker D: Fair enough.
01:11:55.108 - 01:11:59.394, Speaker C: Well, look, to close out this thread, the one thing I will say is.
01:11:59.432 - 01:12:01.986, Speaker D: Look, we've got a lot of love.
01:12:02.008 - 01:12:12.290, Speaker C: For the Flashbots team, but you also need some tough love for them. They're in many ways a victim of their own success. And so to the extent that you want to yell at them for being like, yo, why are you guys centralizing Ethereum?
01:12:12.370 - 01:12:14.434, Speaker D: Do it. Give them shit.
01:12:14.562 - 01:12:28.886, Speaker C: Tell them like, hey, you guys need to figure out a way to not make Ethereum what Bitcoin was in 2017, when a huge amount of concentration was taking place in the mining layer. I think this stuff will get figured.
01:12:28.918 - 01:12:31.626, Speaker D: Out, but it won't be perfect because there is no perfect, right?
01:12:31.648 - 01:12:52.274, Speaker C: There is no pristine kind of final state that this stuff is going to end up in. There's always going to be a tension in blockchain between centralization decentralization, same way as I was saying earlier, between capitalism and socialism, there's always some tension. And that tension gets resolved in part through economics and in part through politics. And we're seeing that playing out right.
01:12:52.312 - 01:12:59.134, Speaker D: Now and I think that's important. So I'm glad that people are pointing this out, that people are pushing Flashbots.
01:12:59.182 - 01:13:10.426, Speaker C: To have answers and they're doing a lot more open, sourcing stuff. They're talking about how their roadmap is, that they're going to make it easier for other block builders to become competitive with themselves, which is the kind of thing that a normal company would not do.
01:13:10.528 - 01:13:11.180, Speaker D: But.
01:13:14.110 - 01:13:15.578, Speaker C: When you're tied so tightly to.
01:13:15.584 - 01:13:17.610, Speaker D: The fate of ethereum, in some sense.
01:13:17.680 - 01:13:21.158, Speaker C: Flashbots only succeeds if Ethereum succeeds. In the same way that the Bitcoin.
01:13:21.174 - 01:13:23.306, Speaker D: Mining pools back in the day, they.
01:13:23.328 - 01:13:38.338, Speaker C: Also got the same calculus, is that they only survive if Bitcoin survives. And if Bitcoin is going through the civil war because the miners are too centralized and people now think like, oh, we should throw all this out and start over, it's like, okay, never mind, never mind. We're not that centralized, we're not going.
01:13:38.344 - 01:13:45.234, Speaker D: To try to be monopolous. And so I think that push and pull is essential to how blockchains work.
01:13:45.352 - 01:13:47.206, Speaker B: And there's also this interesting thing of.
01:13:47.228 - 01:13:50.726, Speaker F: Like, off ethereum mev exists quite in.
01:13:50.748 - 01:14:14.046, Speaker B: Fact, I would argue, because it's less efficient, it's more extractive from users in some ways. But I think between Solana and Cosmos, there's sort of different models of how mev auctions look, how they'll get extracted, how the technical details of the chain influence how well these things work. And these experiments are going to influence how people design around what sort of.
01:14:14.068 - 01:14:17.406, Speaker F: The limits of what fair means because.
01:14:17.508 - 01:14:21.230, Speaker B: Fairness can have many different definitions, unfortunately.
01:14:22.450 - 01:14:23.086, Speaker D: Very yeah.
01:14:23.108 - 01:14:58.022, Speaker E: And actually I know we're time but last point on this is just like interesting listening to Haseeb talk about how there's kind of like capitalist tendencies in crypto and also socialist, which I had never thought of that it's weird to me that it had never occurred to me that that is true. But it is which is really interesting and fascinating about crypto that it's like this thing that's yes, capitalist because of incentives and what we talked about. But then it's also this thing that's like trying to get everybody involved and kind of distribute value to everybody and it's just like a fascinating thing.
01:14:58.076 - 01:15:02.206, Speaker D: But anyway well, this has been super fun.
01:15:02.308 - 01:15:15.086, Speaker C: We got a little bit heated between you and I, Laura, but it was a lot of fun and I'm glad you were able to jam with us today. So that's it until next time. Thanks everybody and signing off.
01:15:15.268 - 01:15:16.700, Speaker E: Yes. Bye everyone.
