00:00:00.360 - 00:00:39.361, Speaker A: Why build this as a separate blockchain rather than as a layer 2? There are a couple of major reasons. The first is decentralization. At the end of the day, we think it's really important that there is decentralized block production with many nodes that are participating in consensus. We think that's important for censorship resistance. We think that's really important for decentralizing control over the network overall. And with existing L2 solutions that we see even today, they pretty much all still have a centralized sequencer. The other major reasons are performance and cost, which go hand in hand.
00:00:39.361 - 00:00:55.905, Speaker A: But at the end of the day, in order to build a really performant system, one needs to optimize all layers of the stack, whether that's the execution component, whether that's the consensus component, which is keeping all these nodes in sync with each other, or other considerations like the data availability consideration.
