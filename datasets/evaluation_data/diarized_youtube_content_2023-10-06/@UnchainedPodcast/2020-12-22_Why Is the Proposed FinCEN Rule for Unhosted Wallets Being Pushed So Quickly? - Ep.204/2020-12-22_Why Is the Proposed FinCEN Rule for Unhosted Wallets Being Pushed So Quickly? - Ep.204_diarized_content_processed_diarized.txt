00:01:01.250 - 00:01:18.950, Speaker A: Today's topic is the recently proposed Fin rule around crypto transactions related to Unhosted wallets, self hosted wallets, or just plain wallets, whatever you want to call them. Here to discuss are Jeremy O'Lear, founder and CEO of Circle, and Kristen Smith, executive director of the blockchain association. Welcome, Jeremy and Kristen.
00:01:19.290 - 00:01:20.680, Speaker C: Thanks for having us.
00:01:21.370 - 00:01:32.860, Speaker A: Because this involves news, I'm just going to let the audience know upfront that we are recording Saturday morning, the day after the proposed rule was published. First, can you guys explain what this rule is?
00:01:33.390 - 00:03:03.000, Speaker D: Basically the rule as proposed. And we'll come back to the fact that even the fact that this is a proposed rule versus a final rule, which has been a huge battle and Kristen has been at the front lines of that which we'll talk about. But the proposed rule is really around transaction reporting for individuals that use a custodial wallet or an exchange or it's technically in the rule a money service business or a bank. So a regulated financial institution in the United States and any transaction that involves essentially sending or receiving funds from a crypto wallet that is not associated with another regulated financial institution or money service business, whether internationally or the US. And it essentially says that if an individual is sending greater than $3,000 over crypto network, then you need to actually record their full KYC information. You need to receive the name and address of the recipient and then keep that record. And then if it's greater than $10,000, let's say you're sending these days half a bitcoin to someone, to another bitcoin wallet that either you control or is someone else.
00:03:03.000 - 00:03:35.570, Speaker D: You also need to collect that name and address of the recipient, and you need to report it, all of that information to fincent, essentially to the federal government and law enforcement in the federal government. And so there's essentially a data feed that gets sent to the US government with all transactions above $10,000 with that collected information, and then they can go on and monitor that freely and track your blockchain activity.
00:03:35.910 - 00:03:36.980, Speaker C: It's bad.
00:03:38.070 - 00:03:39.620, Speaker A: And why do you say that?
00:03:40.710 - 00:04:57.366, Speaker C: Well, listen, I think there are a couple of reasons it's problematic. One, and as proposed, all of the comments for this rule are due on January 4, which isn't a lot of time given that we've got Christmas and New Year's and a couple of things coming up. It's going to be a pretty intense couple of weeks to get that because there are a lot of questions about how you would actually go around collecting this information. And it's not that our exchanges can't get out there and do this type of work, but it is a huge burden to just turn on a dime, especially there's no proposed implementation period here. It would take a long time to do. Yeah, but I think more problematically, and I'll let Jeremy go into this, is that not every self hosted wallet has a name and a physical address, right? If you're working with a smart contract, this is going to prohibit or prevent crypto from going from an exchange wallet into smart contracts. And that's the whole point of everything that we're all building here, is to get more services that are built on top of smart contracts.
00:04:57.366 - 00:04:59.482, Speaker C: But I'll let Jeremy talk more about that.
00:04:59.536 - 00:05:58.240, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, I think there's so many issues with the proposed rule. There's so many issues with the process by which this is happening. This is a midnight rulemaking attempt. This is extremely unilateral from the Secretary of treasury himself, despite significant objections throughout the government, including from within law enforcement, to this. So this is a highly politically motivated individual who wants to jam this through and is doing everything in his power to do that, despite many, many good actors in the federal government who I think realize that something like this should not be just jammed through and requires really careful review, deliberation and planning and thinking. So we'll come back to that, maybe. But I do want to say, when you look at blockchains, the fundamental innovation today is this infrastructure where you can actually have programmable money.
00:05:58.240 - 00:06:13.842, Speaker D: The breakthroughs that are happening. This is what motivated me to get in the industry almost eight years ago was this idea that you could have money as a data type on the Internet and you could program it, and you could create contracts around.
00:06:13.896 - 00:06:14.162, Speaker C: It.
00:06:14.216 - 00:07:16.758, Speaker D: And that those could be enforced by code and work globally and interoperably and that that would eventually allow for financial services innovation and access to that financial services innovation globally as well. Really profound stuff. And this rule basically just completely ignores the fact that that even exists. It completely ignores the fact that innovation in open finance is built on this idea of smart contracts, that whether they're providing lending markets or they're providing other forms of economic arrangements, are executing in code and that individuals for the first time ever have the ability to access and interact with those. That's a huge breakthrough. And I think there's obviously, like the full decentralization movement which says, well, the whole point is to get outside of regulated intermediaries. And as long as we have access to this outside of regulated intermediaries, it's fine, it doesn't matter.
00:07:16.758 - 00:08:05.718, Speaker D: But I think we want a world where financial institutions are able to offer, whether it's a business or a consumer, are able to offer people access to this, offer access to these services around the world. I think we want that world. And effectively, this rule, it says nothing to this issue. And the reality is that individuals and businesses are going to want to be able to transact with smart contracts. It's sort of like duh that's so much. This is essentially, I think, really limiting. By saying nothing to that issue, it raises very significant questions about how a coinbase, if you're on Coinbase.com,
00:08:05.718 - 00:08:54.294, Speaker D: can you actually interact with a smart contract? What is staking? Is Staking interacting with a smart contract? What are all these things? What can a consumer facing or business facing institution do? So that's a major issue. And I think coming back to the procedural question, what we ought to do is say, okay, we have these kind of concerns and I think they are legitimate concerns. Money laundering and financial crime is legitimate and we can talk about that. But you don't jam it through over the holidays without any consideration, without any thinking, without any industry engagement. And the rule says, oh yeah, we had an hour meeting in March with a few people from exchanges and last year we went to California for a day.
00:08:54.412 - 00:08:55.382, Speaker C: Big deal.
00:08:55.436 - 00:09:08.698, Speaker D: I mean, that is not industry engagement. So the reality here is that we need industry to be able to work on this in a really material way and not just this jam through kind of situation.
00:09:08.864 - 00:09:43.640, Speaker A: So let's parse out a bunch of what you just spoke about. I'm so curious about what you said about how this isn't even a unilateral motion from the government that Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin apparently is the one individual, you imply that's really driving this and that actual people who work in this area, in law enforcement are opposed. Why is he so driven to do this? What is his perception about what's happening in the crypto industry that makes him feel that this is the right way to go?
00:09:44.090 - 00:10:59.934, Speaker C: Yeah, so we started to get wind that Secretary Mnuchin had serious concerns with Bitcoin, really, and crypto in general, but he really does not like Bitcoin. We started getting a sense of this over the summer around the same time that the FATF released their report that had some suggested policy tools that policymakers could use if they had concerns about self hosted wallets. And what we were hearing at the time was very concerning because we would hear stories about how he wants to just ban Bitcoin entirely, that he doesn't like permissionless networks, that he doesn't want any of this stuff, he wants to go after it. And that's when at the Blockchain association. Prior to this, we had never been concerned about Bank Secrecy Act issues. We thought that the guidance that Finced had put out in 2014 and again in 2013, I guess, and again in 2019 was very reasonable and we didn't have any issues with the policy. But when we started hearing that Minutian was so fired up about this, we decided that, okay, if something's going to be coming, we need to get into this.
00:10:59.934 - 00:11:06.770, Speaker C: And so we worked with our membership and drafted a report called Self Hosted Wallets in the Future of Free Societies.
00:11:07.350 - 00:11:16.622, Speaker A: Is it the one that we went over in the episode with? Yeah, yeah, that episode will be in the show Notes for People. It was with Jake Chavinsky of Compound.
00:11:16.766 - 00:12:02.610, Speaker C: Yes. And so we released that in November. And what had always kind of been going on in the back of my mind is like, okay, they're going to kick off a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that is going to go after self hosted wallets. They know you can't actually ban Bitcoin, you can't actually prevent permissionless networks from existing, but they're going to try to go at the interaction between the regulated world and the less regulated world. And so we wrote this report and we sent it around to folks in government and very quickly heard back from FinCEN that this was very timely and that they wanted to meet as soon as possible. And so we did some large meetings there with folks from treasury and folks from Finsen. We also did some meetings on the Hill.
00:12:02.610 - 00:12:41.594, Speaker C: But all this is to say that the reason we wanted to lay the foundation is we always envisioned this would be a long battle, right. Because you typically have a Notice of proposed rulemaking. There's a 30, 60, sometimes even 90 day comment period. There's often follow on comment periods, and it's a very open process and it allows for a lot of dialogue back and forth. But what we learned a couple of weeks ago is that this was actually being floated as an interim final rule. And an interim final rule goes into effect immediately. There's often a common period associated with it, and then it becomes a final final rule.
00:12:41.594 - 00:13:14.378, Speaker C: Only in government can you have a final final rule, but the interim final rule would go into effect immediately. And the reason that they were using to bypass the regular process is that there's kind of this public interest exception to going through the process. But the reason they said this was that, well, the money launderers will move their money around and they will be able to get around the rule if we give them any advance notice. So all of that is to say that the real time has nothing to.
00:13:14.384 - 00:13:15.622, Speaker D: Do with January 20.
00:13:15.686 - 00:13:17.770, Speaker C: It has nothing to do with Minutiae.
00:13:18.270 - 00:13:29.210, Speaker D: Actually being booted out of power and that he's trying to get done something that he personally thinks needs to happen. Let's talk honestly about this. This is a bunch of BS.
00:13:29.370 - 00:13:53.766, Speaker C: Yes, but the motivation for this is that stuff, and he doesn't understand this stuff. We have tried to game out every possible angle here. There's no, like, I want to leave and make a bunch of money in traditional banking. I mean, the guy's already worth hundreds of millions of dollars. This isn't like a career play. He isn't beholden to any interest. He just fundamentally, at his core, believes that this stuff is bad.
00:13:53.868 - 00:14:48.546, Speaker D: I have a story about that, and I think it's relevant. So almost a year ago in January at Davos, there was a closed session, closed door meeting, where a small number of people from the crypto industry and folks like David Marcus, myself, and others, but basically like, the heads of the leading financial institutions in the world, major central bank, know, the heads of the BIS, the Swift. I mean, a lot of people, and it was meant to be a dialogue, know, what kind of governance do we need around digital currency? What should this look like? And Minutian was brought in, and he sat at the front of the room, and people kind of got called on to give their perspective on things. And he got up. He basically just mocked bitcoin. I mean, he essentially just started by saying, you can buy Bitcoin. You can do whatever the hell you want with it.
00:14:48.546 - 00:15:43.590, Speaker D: I think it's basically, this is complete trash, and you might as well just buy a bushel of bananas. He literally kind of went off on this personal rant about how stupid he thought bitcoin was, and if you want to do that, fine. Basically, kind of mockingly. But if you want to do that and you want to transfer that and control it yourself, no way. Basically, over my dead body. And so I think there's a mixture of a personal sentiment that he thinks I've seen this for eight years. People who come out of the traditional financial system have an enormous amount of cognitive dissonance about open finance, about the idea of digital money that exists outside the realm of the government or corporations.
00:15:43.590 - 00:16:07.998, Speaker D: And I think he's one of those people who it sort of violates his frame of reference for how the world works, and it makes him angry. And I think he felt like he was very much on a personal mission on this issue. And so that was the first time I really saw that. And obviously, we're sort of seeing that play out in the twilight of the administration.
00:16:08.174 - 00:16:08.466, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:16:08.488 - 00:16:51.886, Speaker C: And I think I was going to say going back to your original question, though, Laura, he's alone on this. He is 100% alone. We have law enforcement agencies that don't think that this is going to be a useful rule. We have Finsen itself that, yes, the rule came from Finsden, but there are very smart people at Finsen that understand crypto, and they understand that this is going to be very problematic for all the innovation that's going on. But they're at the direction of the Treasury Secretary on this. So we have staff level people at the White House that have been helping to push back on this. So we have members of Congress that are wanting to push back on this.
00:16:51.886 - 00:17:28.010, Speaker C: And even folks I've heard that work for the Secretary directly don't think this is the right approach, but he is on a personal mission, and the logistics, by the way, of getting a rule out the door are incredibly complicated. And what he has done to get this posted as quickly as he has is really quite remarkable. It's like where there's a will, there's a way. And even though there's all this opposition against it, he has taken a personal level interest in ushering this through at the last minute.
00:17:29.630 - 00:18:00.360, Speaker A: One thing that I'm curious about, though, is, as you mentioned earlier, fincent did release guidance twice that the industry largely felt was pretty sensible. So I was curious at this point in time, what do the people who don't think that this is a good role in Fincent or just pretty much any of the law enforcement or other people in government that you mentioned, what do they think should be done? Do they have any kind of proposals on their wish list?
00:18:00.810 - 00:18:46.162, Speaker C: Yeah. No. The way this has played out over the past couple of weeks is there was a big stakeholder meeting because with different leaders at these various agencies, and everyone does agree that there's something needs to be done in general about concerns of illicit finance. I mean, it's hard to not have that position, especially when you're sitting in government. There were a lot of concerns around the process at the time. I think the smarter way and those that are more informed understand that blockchains are actually a little bit different than cash. I know we love to make the comparison, and it's useful in certain circumstances, but they're actually really cool.
00:18:46.162 - 00:19:49.138, Speaker C: Amazing tools that are used every day. We have Chainalysis and elliptic and CipherTrace that are all out there, working with law enforcement, working with companies to help track down and figure out who the bad guys are and where the illicit financial activity is going. And that is very cool and different than how you would go and chase down the bad guys in the traditional world and in the traditional financial services world. And so the right way to have this is to have a conversation is what else could we be doing? How can we use the unique characteristics of the blockchain to help us find these transactions that are bad and the people who are associated with them, as opposed to taking a regime that is meant for an old system and trying to apply it on top of crypto. And I think there are lots of people that are very interested and open to have that conversation, but they want to have that conversation first before crafting this midnight rule and cramming it down at the very last minute.
00:19:49.234 - 00:21:19.234, Speaker A: And one other thing that I really wanted to ask about a little bit further is I actually already engaged in a little bit of a Twitter debate about this with Ari Paul, but I think the point I was arguing was wrong and he was right. He was saying that actually this doesn't really affect people who already primarily transact in wallets or even people who would choose to do so, which I actually, honestly, at this point in time, do think probably is the description. Of the majority of people who operate in DeFi at the moment that they're not doing it from a business, that they're doing it from their own personal wallet. So if in the future people have to on ramp through something like Coinbase, but then transfer for under 3000 or 10,000 or whatever to their own personal wallet and then engage in DFI from there, what is the problem? Because my sense earlier, even also from the Finsen guidance was that in a way that that guidance would probably just drive more people to interact from their own wallets. And I understand that raises maybe some security issues if you're using huge amounts of money, but for most average people it's just going to be how they're going to interact. And a lot of people kind of like that idea that that's how most people would interact. So Ari was saying this is really going to affect businesses more than individuals.
00:21:19.234 - 00:21:21.160, Speaker A: That's what his point was, right?
00:21:21.530 - 00:21:59.010, Speaker D: I read his threads and I think he makes some very strong points and I agree with most of it. And just to maybe reiterate how that translates is I go to an exchange, I work with a custodian, I'm getting some USDC or Bitcoin or whatever I'm doing. And in this new rule, let's say I want to take $15,000 and move it so I can use that and put it into DFI or Dex or whatever it is. Yeah, I need to say I'm putting this in a self hosted wallet. It's my wallet. You have my name and address. That's what I'm doing.
00:21:59.010 - 00:22:55.282, Speaker D: And I can imagine a user interface where there's essentially like the service identifies, okay, you're not sending to another VASP, you're sending to an unknown wallet a checkbox that says this is my wallet. And it goes and then you go and interact with DeFi. So at a practical level, I think that is accurate. Now here's the difference. Here's the challenge. Under this rule, this rule will mean that effectively the record of you as an individual doing that and the blockchain address, those just get sent in a data feed to the federal government and law enforcement, and they can do whatever they want with it. And so whether you're transacting with another person using an unhosted wallet or on your own account, so to speak, now, basically, I mean, we know how all this works.
00:22:55.282 - 00:23:53.160, Speaker D: The data feed goes to the government, and they're quite capable of writing software. And so you can imagine, okay, well, now we have this data feed, and now we can basically have surveillance downstream over every transaction on chain tied to a specific identity and tied to that. Now, in the traditional financial system, there's nothing equivalent to that the government needs to subpoena to get that information, unless the financial institution deems that the person is doing something suspicious where they have reason to believe that there's money laundering or financial crime or some other action. If they do, then they have to report it to the government. Now, anyone who transacts above $10,000 is presumed to be a money launderer and are now under full surveillance and monitoring. They can be without consent. And that is what this rule does.
00:23:53.160 - 00:24:46.440, Speaker D: When you take cash out of a bank, you take $10,000 cash out of the bank that does get reported, but there's not someone looking over your shoulder everywhere you go and seeing what you did. So there's a huge difference. And as we move into a world of quote unquote digital money on Internets, on blockchains, this is a small step towards radically higher levels of surveillance, and it is different than the way it works in the existing banking system. And so while it might feel good to say, oh, well, I can just put it in my self hosted wallet and then I can do what I want, well, you've done that, and your blockchain addresses and your transaction downstream transaction activity are now under surveillance without you knowing or being able to do anything about it.
00:24:47.050 - 00:24:58.954, Speaker A: And just remind me also what is the information that is required to be reported? What identity? Can you just list all the things yeah.
00:24:59.072 - 00:25:00.170, Speaker D: Do you want to talk about that question?
00:25:00.240 - 00:25:20.660, Speaker C: Well, no. For the self hosted wallet, the customer registered with the exchange, there's information reporting about that. But the identity of the self hosted wallet, the self hosted wallet address has to have a name and physical address. The physical address is kind of a particularly complicated one person with the.
00:25:22.790 - 00:25:43.210, Speaker D: I mean, the real question is and the rule does not specifically say that the CTR what is a kind of currency transaction report? Yeah. Does the CTR include blockchain address or wallet address? Now, like the SARS for virtual currency.
00:25:43.630 - 00:25:46.714, Speaker A: Exchangers suspicious activity report yeah, sorry.
00:25:46.752 - 00:26:06.340, Speaker D: Suspicious activity reports that are filed do require inclusion of blockchain addresses. And so that's certainly an open clarification. But I think if, in fact, these CTRs do include your wallet address, that is an enormous amount of sort of oversight that becomes possible.
00:26:06.710 - 00:26:22.822, Speaker A: And then someone else also said something like and I don't know if this is true that then if you interact with somebody, then the exchange also will need to know their entire transaction history or something like that. If you're transacting above a certain amount, go ahead.
00:26:22.956 - 00:26:25.254, Speaker C: I don't think you need the whole transaction history.
00:26:25.452 - 00:26:59.458, Speaker D: No. The money, service, business or bank who's providing interaction with blockchains is required to keep those records for statutory five years. Basically for transactions of $3,000, you need to essentially internally log what is like your own CTR. You need to track that so that that is on record. In the event that you got a subpoena, those records would be available to the government over a statutory period of five years.
00:26:59.624 - 00:27:25.466, Speaker A: One other thing that I want to ask about this was, so Finson also is going to try to propose these rules around Structuring, which is ways in which users might try to break these larger transactions that would trip these requirements into smaller ones so they don't have to report. But then I actually try to glance through the document to figure out how they're going to do that and it just looks like all they're saying is like, it's prohibited. Do you get a sense of what that would look like or how they.
00:27:25.488 - 00:28:15.222, Speaker D: Would prevent mean my take on that? A, as a financial institution, we are required to have AML programs and monitoring to identify Structuring activity and report it. I think it's not entirely clear how that translates in this proposed rule. I think effectively what I think it says is if your internal systems that are designed to identify Structuring identify Structuring, then you need to presumably either freeze the transaction or close the account, or again, the details are not there. But it's essentially to have a more intense intervention than just I'm seeing Structuring and I'm filing a SAR.
00:28:15.366 - 00:28:27.962, Speaker A: Okay, so in a moment we're going to talk a little bit more about the impact of this and also what the industry plans to do about it. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible. 1inchh is a decentralized exchange aggregator.
00:28:28.026 - 00:29:07.386, Speaker B: That sources liquidity from the top DEXes and liquidity sources to save users money and time on swaps. 1inchh is capable of finding the best possible trading paths and splitting them among multiple market depths. Recently the oneinch team unveiled one inch version two. The main highlights of V Two are Pathfinder, an API that contains a new discovery and routing algorithm and a new, intuitive, user friendly UI. The V Two improvements ensure the best rates on swaps while dramatically cutting response time.

00:29:26.450 - 00:29:42.594, Speaker A: Back to my conversation with Jeremy and Kristen. Okay, so now I feel like I have a better understanding of what's included in the rule. But is there anything else that we should let people know about? Like what is the content of this proposed rule before we move on to other topics?
00:29:42.722 - 00:29:45.254, Speaker C: I think we got all the high level points.
00:29:45.372 - 00:30:09.802, Speaker A: Well, one thing that I was wondering, because we did talk about DFI, but I also wondered how this rule could affect the wider world of DApps in general or Web Three. If you had some $10,000 CryptoKitty or something you wanted to buy from somebody, how would that affect things? Would you need to get the KYC from that person or I don't know how this would impact.
00:30:09.866 - 00:31:23.270, Speaker D: Well, I think this gets back to your comments about your thread with Re Paul, right. Which is basically, if you're using a DAP, you're using that through a noncustodial wallet, because that's how Web Three works. And if you're transacting with an NFT exchange, that NFT exchange is something you're connecting to through a noncustodial wallet as well. And so effectively, what that would look like is I move $10,000 of USDC or Ether or Bitcoin or whatever it is, and I'm interacting with the marketplace and I want to transact for an NFT, and I'm doing that on a permissionless infrastructure, and I then take possession of that, et cetera. That activity is sort of in that kind of parallel permissionless blockchain world. Now, if a custodial service wanted to allow you to buy an NFT from a marketplace and the custodial service is interacting directly with the smart contracts, that's where it starts to get complicated. This gets back to the whole smart contract discussion.
00:31:23.270 - 00:32:45.826, Speaker D: There are lots and lots of services now where it's a custodial service that itself behind the scenes is putting stablecoins up into DeFi contracts, or is putting Ethereum up into DeFi contracts on your behalf and interacting with smart contracts to give you access to it where you don't actually need to do self custody, et cetera. That set of activities, there's a giant question mark about that. Is that even legally possible? Because there is no way for that exchange or that custodial service to know the name and address of the smart contract, what's the name and address of compound protocol. It just doesn't work. This is, again, back to the rulemaking. Why, if this was serious in terms of process, we would take the time to think about, okay, how do financial intermediaries deal with DeFi in the context of these financial crime concerns? And let's think that through and frankly, give the industry time. In my letter to the senior staff, including Secretary Mnuchin, I specifically believe that there are ways for decentralized identity and identity protocols and other things to be layered on this in.
00:32:45.826 - 00:33:10.540, Speaker D: A way where you can both have financial privacy and you can have accountability and record keeping, and that is compatible with this emerging world of smart contracts. But it's going to take a year or two to figure that out. And so the right thing in my mind is create the space, try and work with industry to figure it out. Don't just jam it through. So I think that's really where the big question marks are.
00:33:11.230 - 00:33:40.420, Speaker A: All right, so let's talk a little bit about this process. As you guys mentioned earlier, the comment period for this proposed rule is only 15 days. A normal length of time is more like minimum 30 or more often, something like 60 days. Coin center even published something where they talked about how there's this one proposed rule for the banking industry that's been under consideration for six years. Has a 15 day comment period ever happened before?
00:33:40.950 - 00:34:13.022, Speaker C: Not out of fin. They have never done a 15 day comment period. I know this sounds crazy. We're actually grateful to have these 15 days because as I mentioned before, there was going to be zero days. So this is at least something. But it's a very inconvenient time. And though the good news is it could be the grounds for an Administrative Procedure Act case against them for not taking enough time and allowing enough time for this to happen.
00:34:13.022 - 00:35:06.602, Speaker C: So we've been working with Jake Shravinsky, who our he chairs our DeFi working group at the Blockchain Association. We've been working with the team at Kirkland and Ellis, including Paul Clement, who's a former Solicitor General, to try to figure out what is the best sort of legal, you know, going forward. We're going to obviously comment on the letter, know, work through Christmas and probably not go skiing as many days as I had hoped because we're going to have to be figuring out how best to respond to this. But simultaneously, we're also coming up with a legal strategy to figure out how to push back on this and prevent it from going into effect, because we do think that the process here has not been followed. I mean, it very clearly hasn't been followed and that they shouldn't be allowed to move forward with such a short time frame.
00:35:06.746 - 00:36:16.626, Speaker D: I would add one thing to that. Just and this is almost a little bit of a call to action, which is I think there are probably 30 to 40 million people in the United States who are interacting with digital currency and who probably care a lot about this, and that's a huge number of people that are impacted. So the impact is broad. But the call to action is really people who care about this need to be submitting their own comments, but also reaching out to Congress, reaching out to their representative elected officials and making it clear that they feel very strongly that this is not a fair review process and that this deserves a review, not just on this administrative level, but frankly, this is something that Congress has not even had an opportunity to look at. And so I think people need to get out there and apply as much pressure as possible so that there is a more extensive review period on this so that some of the issues that we've identified here can be thought through.
00:36:16.808 - 00:37:20.140, Speaker C: There's also an interesting time frame ahead of us. I mean, as we mentioned before, I think Minutian is going to do everything he can to make this role final prior to Inauguration Day on January 20. But if we could succeed in extending the comment period or extending the period of time where Finsen has to review all of the comments to get to January 21, I think this would be a totally different ballgame. I think we would be able to work with the new administration and start over on something like this. And so going back to Jeremy's call for action, every sort of unique argument that is brought forth has to be addressed as part of the regulatory process. And so we highly encourage people to comment and that will lengthen the time needed in order for FinCEN to meet all of the requirements before making the role final. So getting a lot of comments in is going to be important.
00:37:21.710 - 00:37:45.922, Speaker A: It sort of reminds me of a common tactic in crypto, which is the denial of service attack. But anyway, yeah, one thing that I was curious about is so you mentioned this Administrative Procedure Act and Legal action. I don't know what that looks like. Would that mean like, a literal lawsuit against us? Okay, yeah.
00:37:45.976 - 00:38:54.840, Speaker C: So there's a couple of ways we could do it, and we're evaluating, but one way to stop this thing from going into effect is to sue the government and say that you can't put this out there. And so, yeah, we're looking to do that. And that would probably be in the form of a preliminary injunction at the time that a final rule comes out. But we're looking at all of the different options that are there right now. The other option we have, because if the rule does become final, it does become quite difficult to undo the rule, right? Once it's final, you can't just but if it's in this proposal stage, I think, like you said, the Coin Center folks had mentioned, some of these rulemakings go on for years and sometimes they get pulled or they get stopped along the way. And so if we can keep the rulemaking open to get to the next administration, that's our best chance. But if it does go final, we have the lawsuit route that I mentioned, and we also have something called the Congressional Review Act, which is a tool that Congress has to undo regulations that they don't like.
00:38:54.840 - 00:39:18.640, Speaker C: That would be a fairly heavy lift to get the votes to essentially undo this rule, but it's not necessarily impossible. So we're looking at a legislative strategy on that side and then we're also looking at working through the courts in order to get this thing slowed down before it goes into effect.
00:39:19.890 - 00:39:20.702, Speaker D: Sorry, go ahead.
00:39:20.756 - 00:39:21.898, Speaker A: No, go ahead, Jeremy.
00:39:21.994 - 00:40:19.694, Speaker D: I wanted to add one thought here as well, which is somewhat tangential, which is essentially I don't want everyone to be all doom and gloom here because I think you've actually seen a week or so ago, obviously there was some heightened concerns about an outright ban or more aggressive measures which were, in fact, being contemplated. And the market obviously reacted to that. I think gradually there is so much interest in the market right now, it's obviously grown. But even specifically after 05:00 p.m. Yesterday, when the details of this rule were published, the market is up. I'm very close to some of the biggest market makers in the world and I think people have kind of shrugged it off. And I think they've shrugged it off for two reasons.
00:40:19.694 - 00:41:28.102, Speaker D: I think one is the perception, as if you refer to the Ari Parl thread as well, is sort of like, okay, well, DeFi can go on. People can continue to utilize permissionless infrastructure, yeah, there's some hassle around it, et cetera, but this is not somehow going to destroy the ability to use permissionless. Blockchains right. So I think that's one piece I think the other piece, which is actually more subtle, is that I have been obviously trying to work with mainstream financial institutions to work with the crypto industry for a very long time. And the number one issue that has always been limiting financial institutions, banks specifically, of getting involved is the compliance teams. The compliance officers basically say there's no way for us to have a way to keep track of what people are doing with permissionless blockchains and therefore it's impossible for us to meet our BSA obligations. So we have to stay completely away from this.
00:41:28.102 - 00:42:15.778, Speaker D: As the OCC has basically said, hey, you guys can get into crypto. You guys can keep crypto on your balance sheet, you can provide custodial services, you can support stablecoins, stablecoin networks. As that has happened, that's been a really positive thing. You're seeing institutional participation that's meaningful, that's coming into the market right now, and you're seeing more and more banks saying, hey, how do we get into this? The PayPal announcement is another example. This issue and having some resolution around this issue, I believe will lead to massive scale financial institution participation in these markets because they will finally, at some level, the compliance departments will say, okay, compliance departments don't like gray area. They don't like not having rules. They like rules.
00:42:15.778 - 00:42:54.146, Speaker D: If they have a rule, then they know what they need to follow. And so this in some ways answers that question which has been looming over this industry for seven or eight years. And so you could decide whether you think that's a good thing or a bad thing to have more banks involved in crypto. But I think that some resolution of this issue, whether it's this specific rule as it's proposed now, or some more extensive period where the industry can work on it and address some of the issues that we've identified, will lead to the mainstreaming of crypto in a larger way. And I want to make sure that's not lost on people as well.
00:42:54.328 - 00:43:43.070, Speaker A: Yeah, although I think what's fascinating to me about this is that so I totally get the point that you're making and I do agree that it will lead to that just having more clarity however it goes. Also back to what we were saying was my debate with Ari Paul, where I do think that the rules, the way they're written now, will actually cut off certain revenue streams and lines of business for some of these. Bigger. Like, I don't know how this would affect different things like staking or any services they may want to offer in Yield farming or whatever it is. So in that regard, I feel like it disadvantages less technical people like people like me who it's not like I interact with MetaMask all the time. And then the one time I did for the first time in a long time, I literally lost $500 in like five minutes. It was terrible.
00:43:43.070 - 00:43:54.520, Speaker A: And I haven't used MetaMask since I was so burned. So I feel like this drives a thing where it opens up crypto only to more technical people and not to everyday people.
00:43:55.050 - 00:44:26.420, Speaker D: Yeah, I think that's a risk and I think worst case scenario, this thing gets stammed through, there's no way to stop it. It goes into effect, there's some period of time. The next step is we need additional guidance, we need additional clarification, we need additional amendments, we need to work on that issue so that mainstream financial institutions that want to tap decentralized networks for services and provide those as value to their users have the ability to do so and do so in a really clear way. So we have to continue to fight for.
00:44:27.110 - 00:44:50.570, Speaker A: So just to go back to Kristen's points earlier about the Biden administration, jeremy, you did say on CNBC that you expected the Biden administration ultimately be positive toward crypto. I don't know in the context of your comments, did you mean like around this type of issue or why did you say that and what do you think their attitude would be in the short term if the rulemaking does go past the Trump administration?
00:44:51.150 - 00:46:05.806, Speaker D: Well, I would say a couple of mean I think there's obviously career civil servants that work in agencies. There's a tremendous number of people who work in the treasury department, in the OCC, in FinCEN, in law enforcement, in other key agencies who are getting more and more educated on crypto thanks to Kristen and team and a broader just general awareness in the space. And I think there's just so much more understanding now than there's ever been and there's a real recognition that this is very significant and important infrastructure. And so I just think at the federal government level there is just, in general, a more constructive view on all of this. And I think that's getting more and more heightened as this grows around the world. I think specifically with the Biden administration, my view is that there's going to be a major focus in the Biden administration on American competitiveness in critical industries and infrastructure areas. I think that the approach that the Biden administration will take is not going to be one of the standing up, massive federal government initiatives.
00:46:05.806 - 00:47:08.870, Speaker D: It's going to be to tap American entrepreneurship. It's going to be to tap the great technology capabilities, the great private firms to do that in a way where the public sector and the private sector work closely together to advance those things and blockchains and what they enable is clearly a category and digital currency is clearly a category where the United States needs to have a leadership position, not just in this sort of US. China thing, which people tend to overdramatize, I think. But I think just in general, I always use the 1996 metaphor and I think it's very apt. We might have a Netscape moment with Coinbase's IPO, which was similar to back then. But I think very specifically people are seeing that the global economic system and financial infrastructure is going to get rebuilt in the image of the Internet and on this and we got to get it. So I think that this is just a time it happens to be when Biden and team are coming to power.
00:47:08.870 - 00:47:33.840, Speaker D: And likewise, I think that in general, we'll want to kind of govern from the middle and try to approach this in a bipartisan are. I think this is an industry that has people on every which way of the political spectrum who are interested in seeing it move forward. And I think that that will contribute to general engagement and support.
00:47:34.690 - 00:48:07.350, Speaker A: And so just so I understand how this will work, if indeed the rulemaking does go into the Biden administration, do you expect at that point then it would be kind of more the career level, just bureaucrats who will carry the ball forward and then therefore will institute like a more typical process. Is that your sense of what would mean? Not that I've looked into this, but I feel like the Biden administration probably has a lot of priorities when it comes in. I don't know how high this is going to rank. So I just wonder, is it going to languish?
00:48:09.210 - 00:49:00.954, Speaker C: There could be a number of things. At the very least, I think we can expect it to slow down. At the very best, maybe it gets pulled entirely and then the conversation can start anew with folks in the administration. Finsen is one of those agencies that it is all career people. So the team that's in place now will continue to be there going in post January 20. And so we're hopeful that the problem we have now is that we have a Treasury Secretary who's for whatever reason made this his number one priority. I don't think this is going to be Yellen's number one priority out of the gate and this will be sort of reverted to the normal process where we have really well educated, talented people in government that are trying to think creatively about these issues.
00:49:00.954 - 00:49:11.900, Speaker C: And those are the ones that we want to be engaging with on these conversations. Not treasury secretaries that are difficult to get in front of.
00:49:12.350 - 00:49:33.554, Speaker A: So one other thing is that pretty much this whole conversation has been pretty focused domestically. But Collins Belton, who's another lawyer in the crypto space, told me that he thinks this breaks down GDPR compliance in the EU and he just was super skeptical it would fly over there. So how do you think GDPR issues might affect the ability to implement a rule like this?
00:49:33.752 - 00:49:46.440, Speaker C: Boy, I hadn't thought through that angle, but yeah, I mean there's just a lot of information that's going to be stored in one place. But yeah, no, that's an interesting thought.
00:49:48.030 - 00:50:22.158, Speaker D: I believe that there are exemptions around basically information sharing associated with tracking, associated with financial crimes enforcement. I don't know the details on that, but for mean, the European Union and its members have been very proactive around the travel rule and fat of work and that requires a massive amount of PII flying around all around the, you know, kind of honeypots for cybercriminals, which is one of the issues with travel rule.
00:50:22.254 - 00:50:26.678, Speaker A: And Jeremy, when you say they've been active with that, you mean that they are requiring kind of more?
00:50:26.764 - 00:50:32.118, Speaker D: Absolutely, yeah. I mean Five AMLD is very clear on that.
00:50:32.284 - 00:50:33.634, Speaker A: What is five AMLD?
00:50:33.762 - 00:51:26.870, Speaker D: Okay, so the European Union has an anti money laundering directive. They're now in the fifth version of the antimoney laundering directive, has a whole series of things specific to virtual currency firms, to registration requirements, to KYC procedures and it is the sort of regulatory framework that binds those virtual asset service providers to the FATF guidelines that have been laid out as well. So actually the European Union is pretty strict on a lot of this and I think you obviously saw what happened in France last week. All this came out of the G Seven meeting. This has been worked on as an issue. This has been one of the top issues for the Secretary of treasury in the G Seven and frankly at the G 20 level. And so I think there was essentially a kind of handshake around the table that everybody's going to go roll this out in the G Seven.
00:51:26.870 - 00:51:42.442, Speaker D: So I don't think we're done with this. I think we're going to see G Seven and other G 20 member states introducing rules or regulations similar to this in a coordinated fashion as we go into the new year.
00:51:42.576 - 00:51:49.370, Speaker A: Oh, interesting. So it seems like that you does not see a conflict between these types of rules and GDPR.
00:51:49.530 - 00:52:08.014, Speaker D: No, I mean, if you look specifically at what France has already done, if you look at what the German finance minister announced around this coming out of the G Seven meeting, whatever that was, on the 10th, his words did not need mincing. And so I would expect, certainly in Germany, that something in this space is imminent.
00:52:08.142 - 00:52:36.960, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't remember the exact quote, but I did include it in my newsletter and unconfirmed one week recently. So I will try to find that and link to that in the show notes. All right. We kind of talked a little bit about what you thought people should do in terms of the comments over the next few days, but I don't know if you have any other kind of tips for people, because I kind of was like, are we going to see some mass exodus of crypto from the exchanges over the next 15 days?
00:52:38.450 - 00:53:32.526, Speaker C: Yeah, no, listen, I would encourage individuals to submit comments. If you go to Treasury's website, you can get a copy of the rule and there are instructions in there on how to email in a comment. There will probably, my guess, be some activists that come up with a streamlined way for people to do this. So I'd keep an eye out for those links that make it easier to submit comments. But if you're listening, as someone who is participating in the cryptocurrency industry, I think this is the biggest bullet that's been fired at us so far in the United States and we need to fight back against these types of attacks. And if you're not a member of the Blockchain association, I'm putting in a plug. Please join us.
00:53:32.526 - 00:54:19.722, Speaker C: We are a very small team because we have a very small budget. We could be a very big team if we had a big budget and we could do more work if we have more, you know, for those companies that are out there that are not yet working with us, please join us. We are working together. We had Jeremy and I were in a war room that we set up on our signal here, where we were all sharing information with different people that we were speaking with in government and coming up with a strategy and also analyzing the information when it came out last night. And so it's a really great team of really smart people both here internally at the blockchain association and also within our membership. And so this work doesn't do itself. So we want to get more boots on the ground.
00:54:19.866 - 00:54:57.820, Speaker D: I want to reiterate that. And I was going to say the same thing, which is Kristen and her team are amazing and the work has been incredible and just witnessing even the ability to change some of the things that have been happening on this particular matter just in a matter of weeks. It's tremendous. There's sort of the 1% rule, which is everyone in the world should put at least 1% of their wealth into crypto. Well, every crypto firm and every crypto firm's, treasury, they should probably take 1% of it and contribute to and become members of blockchain association because this is extremely high value, high leverage work and would really encourage that.
00:54:58.270 - 00:55:16.418, Speaker A: One other thing I wanted to ask about Kristen was I've been noticing on Twitter that Coin Center has been raking in the bucks on Gitcoin. They raised $300,000 last I saw, via Gitcoin. Is that something that the blockchain association could do or I don't know if there are any particular rules around.
00:55:16.584 - 00:56:04.114, Speaker C: Yes, we've thought about trying to do something. We are stewards of the Defend Crypto Fund, which is a separate project that we have oversight of. But no, the way we're structured is we represent the companies and the organizations and individuals should absolutely and companies too, should also support Coin Center. I think that's a fantastic team. We do a lot of sharing of information and strategizing back and forth with them, but they have a different point of view. They represent the technology and they're a great way for individuals who want to get involved to go over there. But, yeah, from the industry perspective, that is the blockchain association's point of view.
00:56:04.114 - 00:56:10.818, Speaker C: So very similar missions, but slightly different perspectives. And, yeah, they do fantastic work.
00:56:10.984 - 00:56:21.158, Speaker A: Okay, so I know you may not want to make predictions, but I was just curious how you thought this was going to go. Like, what do you think is the most likely outcome of all this?
00:56:21.324 - 00:56:42.142, Speaker C: I mean, we're going to give it our best shot to continue to throw sand in the gears and slow this thing down. Based off of how aggressive and how personally involved the Treasury Secretary is, I think he is going to push this out to a final rule and I think we're going to have to go to court. I think that's the most likely pathway we see.
00:56:42.276 - 00:56:44.320, Speaker D: Jeremy, I completely.
00:56:47.570 - 00:57:17.010, Speaker A: Know I've never worked in government, but it's just very interesting how one individual at the top, even when everybody around that person doesn't agree, how that can force things through. All right, well, so we will check back and see if you guys were correct. But anyway okay, well, it's been so fun having you on the show. Thank you for doing this on a Saturday morning. Where can people learn more about you and this proposed rule?
00:57:17.170 - 00:57:35.774, Speaker C: Well, if you go to theblockchainassociation.org and you go to our Policy Positions page, wallets issues are right at the top. And you can see our report. You can see our letter that we sent over to Treasury, I guess a week or so ago when we were in the middle of this lobbying blitz and we've got lots of information there.
00:57:35.892 - 00:57:48.306, Speaker D: And I would just say I communicate publicly on this here and there on Twitter at jerralair. So follow me there and I'll have more and more to say about this there as well.
00:57:48.408 - 00:57:51.218, Speaker A: And you also have your show, Money.
00:57:51.384 - 00:58:02.982, Speaker D: That's right. The money movement. So, yes, you can tune into Money Movement and certainly we'll be picking up the conversation there as well.
00:58:03.116 - 00:58:06.562, Speaker A: All right, great. Well, thank you both so much for coming on Unchained.
00:58:06.706 - 00:58:07.750, Speaker C: Thanks, Laura.
