00:00:01.290 - 00:00:18.618, Speaker A: Hi everybody. Welcome to the chopping block. Every couple weeks, the usually four, but currently three of us get together and give the industry insiders perspective on the crypto topics of the day. So quick intros. First up we got Tom, the DeFi maven and master of Memes. Next we've got Tarun, the gigabrain and grand Poohba at Gauntlet. There's me haseeb.
00:00:18.618 - 00:00:29.766, Speaker A: I'm head hype man at Dragonfly. And special guest today we have joining us Kevin Jo, king of the shorts and co founder of Galawa Capital. Welcome, Kevin. Glad to have you.
00:00:29.868 - 00:00:40.860, Speaker B: Yeah, glad to be. You know, I'm actually pretty happy that you got me a nickname too. I feel like this is like the crypto version of the all in podcast or know. Everybody got a know. It's great.
00:00:41.630 - 00:00:46.998, Speaker A: We're aiming for that. We're aiming for the all in podcast to be the normie version of the chopping.
00:00:47.174 - 00:00:47.706, Speaker B: Good.
00:00:47.808 - 00:00:59.754, Speaker C: I mean, we don't have the crazy rhymes that have been happening on the all in podcast. I randomly listened to it recently and they have these haikus now for everyone. They went from just like nickname to these long haikus.
00:00:59.882 - 00:01:02.926, Speaker B: How does Jason come up with all this stuff? I mean, his staff is hard at.
00:01:02.948 - 00:01:08.282, Speaker C: Work or huh, his staff is working hard. He must just be hiring people from comedy.
00:01:08.346 - 00:01:11.538, Speaker A: I don't know what our staff is be. They should be writing intros for me.
00:01:11.624 - 00:01:19.000, Speaker D: Why aren't you at the All In summit? I thought were going to be taking notes and catching up with Jason and asking him for feedback on the show. But you're missing out.
00:01:19.610 - 00:01:24.114, Speaker A: I've been too busy with permissionless, man, I couldn't split my time into Kevin.
00:01:24.242 - 00:01:36.454, Speaker C: Just as if there's ever a chopping block summit. Of course, you know, all guests have oh, that's wonderful. I'm speaking on behalf of Haseeb, who probably never even thought about this concept.
00:01:36.502 - 00:01:58.974, Speaker A: Until obviously Tarun is going to be organizing it. So I appreciate you bring it up. So just quick caveat. The four of us well, the three of us are early stage investors in crypto. Kevin is not quite as early as we are. He tends to do more of the public market stuff. But I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice or legal advice or even life advice, so holy shit.
00:01:58.974 - 00:02:16.760, Speaker A: Kevin, you are now the soothsayer of crypto. I saw that your story on Bloomberg, you were covered in OD lots, and your story on Bloomberg I saw as of this morning, was the most viewed story on Bloomberg. The man who called the Terra USD downfall or something like that.
00:02:17.210 - 00:02:27.194, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I definitely appreciated the time that they gave me on the podcast, but those are some big shoes to fill. I mean, it's a bit sensationalist, so maybe we can get into all that.
00:02:27.232 - 00:02:34.910, Speaker A: But speaking of sensational yeah. Okay, well, I think you've managed to do a good job of building these sensational.
00:02:35.570 - 00:02:42.510, Speaker C: I have a theory that you were featured in all the media because you're the only non anon who was really loud about this.
00:02:42.660 - 00:02:57.220, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's the case. It'd be hard to have the picture of some anime picture, just some VTuber model of Bloomberg. The folks on Wall Street, they're not going to make heads or tails of that. It's going to be too confusing for them.
00:02:58.710 - 00:03:43.474, Speaker A: For those who have been asleep at the wheel for the last couple of weeks, we should probably give a recap of what happened. The big news of the week has been the collapse of Terra. Terra. For those who are unaware, it's a layer one blockchain built on Cosmos, and the core asset of Terra is a stablecoin called UST and essentially on, I think it was May 9 over the weekend and kind of going into Monday, the Terra UST stablecoins Peg broke. The market was more broadly declining due to some macro events that were going on, fear about interest rates. And as the price of Terra started declining sorry, the price of Luna, which is the kind of core layer One asset that backs UST, started declining in price. The UST Peg broke and one thing led to another.
00:03:43.474 - 00:04:21.562, Speaker A: There was basically what we call a death spiral, meaning that as the Peg lowered, the confidence in the system lowered even further. There was more and more algorithmic minting of Luna and expansion in supply of Luna, which resulted eventually in Luna hyperinflation. Over the period of that time, Luna ended up expanding its supply by 18,000 times. It basically underwent a Zimbabwe style hyperinflation event. UST ended up cratering to something on like twenty cents or less on the Peg. I don't know what it's trading at now. And we saw within the course of a week, the first time I've ever seen this in crypto.
00:04:21.562 - 00:05:08.522, Speaker A: An asset dropped 100.0% in terms of the unit price on coin market cap. Literally the price had gotten so low that from the high of $60 before the unwind Terra ended up cratering to fractions of a penny, such that it had to get delisted from all of the major exchanges, none of the major exchanges anymore. Trade Terra. Terra is now considering rebooting the blockchain, finding some way to create what they call what's now being called Terra Two, or some new version of Terra, so that the old version could be called Terra Classic and there'll be a new version. Doe Kwan has claimed that this is going to be a way to revive the community. Even if the stablecoin itself is no longer viable, the community that's been building on Luna can still be salvaged.
00:05:08.522 - 00:05:57.790, Speaker A: So it's been a catastrophic event for crypto. It caused a broader decline in crypto prices and is one of the most catastrophic events that we have seen in a single crypto asset since maybe BitConnect, which was a Ponzi scheme that unwound in 2018. There's been a lot said already about this, but obviously kevin, part of the reason why we're bringing you on is that you were one of the early folks warning about the insolvency of UST. And that the perception at the time. So just to give people a sense of what was going on at that time, terra, before going into all this, going into its calamitous collapse, before that point, UST was collateralized by Luna. And Luna, the market cap of Luna was at the height about 30 billion. At the time of the market downturn, it was maybe on the order of about 20 billion.
00:05:57.790 - 00:06:45.534, Speaker A: And the total supply of UST was on the order of about, I think 14 billion total UST. And so the perception was and the other thing is that TerraForm Labs spun up a foundation called the Luna Foundation Guard, which was tasked with buying up a bunch of bitcoin to use it to defend the peg. So there were billions of dollars, about $3 billion worth of bitcoin at that time that was supposed to be earmarked to defend the peg. The perception from the terror community was that this thing was ironclad. And you, under your firm's name, Galawa Capital, have been basically the gadfly for crypto. Twitter one of the few gadflies who are out there saying this thing is already insolvent, this thing in the moment of a downturn, this thing is going to totally collapse. So I'd love to hear from you.
00:06:45.534 - 00:06:54.820, Speaker A: Give us your perception of the story, like the preamble, what it was like for you seeing this thing trade down and your reflections on the whole event.
00:06:55.430 - 00:07:46.686, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. So I think, I guess to start, we first came across Terra in the very early days when they were just like raising seed funding and Series A, and they were just building the project. And I thought it was just going to be one of these stable coins that probably didn't work, but probably would have a quick death and peter out at some point. And then sometime around really late last year, December, and then early Jan of this year, it just kind of dawned on me that, wait a second, this thing's like a top ten coin. Why did this thing not already unwind? Right? So then I started looking more heavily into it along with the team here at Galwa, and I thought maybe there was something that we overlooked, maybe they made some changes to it, maybe it actually does work. Right. So we looked into the mechanics and it was basically exactly as we thought it was.
00:07:46.686 - 00:08:30.126, Speaker B: And I just didn't think that it was solvent. And I thought that it's crazy that it got to this kind of size because this was kind of on the back of the collapse of Wonderland time, right, because of the whole seafood drama. And that already had some minor contagion. I mean, the space generally survived out of it. It wasn't that bad. But at the end of the day, there was some contagion over to spell and MIM and even a tiny bit of contagion over to anchor UST and luna, right? And then I looked at this thing and I thought, well, this thing is like an ordered magnitude bigger, maybe even bigger than that, and this could cause some serious damage. So I went on twitter, I started trying to sound the alarm, met with a lot of negativity, all these lunatics who are in support of it.
00:08:30.126 - 00:08:35.610, Speaker B: What's funny? I was trying to help them. I was trying to tell them beware, and then they're just ragging on me constantly.
00:08:35.770 - 00:08:39.140, Speaker A: To be clear, lunatic is the moniker of people in the luna community.
00:08:39.910 - 00:09:31.166, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. And I got to give them credit for I think it's great marketing because if you give a name to your army, which I think maybe they learned from the kpop groups, right? So you got your BTS army, you got your blinks, right? And now it's bleeding over into crypto. You got your link, marines, XRP army, and the lunatics. I think it's really smart for them to have done that. But that being said, they do start to display some kind of mob and cult like behavior, and I'm basically just getting just completely yelled at and flamed on twitter. But fortunately for me, I come from a competitive gaming background, so I've literally been called a shithead probably tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of times. So it doesn't really affect you know, I just kept sounding the alarm, met with a lot of resistance, but I think over time there were a few minds that were changed, maybe not too many, but there were a few and there were also others on twitter that were also sounding the alarm.
00:09:31.166 - 00:10:07.342, Speaker B: And I think over time, I think our faction grew, and I think everybody, when they really carefully studied the mechanics, I think they came to the same conclusions that we did. And I think you could arrive at that conclusion from many different ways. You can look at the actual mechanics. You can reason by deduction, right? You can look at history. I mean, there's so many ways to kind of arrive at the same result. And I think that's kind of what happened. So that finally when there was this kind of situation where there was this exogenous shock of the equity markets just tanking and crypto being correlated with equities, then everybody was kind of trigger ready, I think, to make that move.
00:10:07.342 - 00:10:52.974, Speaker B: And I think some of it, I mean, maybe the trigger itself, this selling of 85 million into three pool, UST, maybe that might have even been an accident, right? Maybe it was just that everybody was already kind of skittish and then somebody didn't know that the liquidity migration was going to happen between three pool and four pool. So they saw liquidity evaporate, and they were likely they don't know what's going on, so let's just get rid of it and then that just caused the know, I think there's a lot of conspiracy theories out there right now about like BlackRock or Citadel or this was an attack. I mean, I don't know if it's an attack. It could have just been a mistake or it could have been an accident. For whatever reason, there was some initial trigger of fear and then there was like a fear cascade and sort of like this, the fear just kind of spread out and then it was all over for them, basically.
00:10:53.172 - 00:11:35.366, Speaker A: Yeah, it's been disappointing to see I mean, not surprising, but disappointing to see the amount of conspiratorial thinking that's gone into trying to explain what happened with UST. Right. At the end of the day, we know what happened, which is exactly what you described, which is that people got scared and a reflexive death loop started. And what is the particular catalyst? I mean, we were talking about this internally that it doesn't really matter who started, it doesn't matter who shot the first bullet. What matters is that this thing was going to break out into violence and the responsibility of making sure that doesn't happen falls to the protocol. And ultimately, whoever it was, and maybe it was a group of people, maybe it was a fund, maybe it wasn't. It was almost certainly not BlackRock or Citadel.
00:11:35.366 - 00:12:00.654, Speaker A: I mean, that's ridiculous. It's never going to be like an obvious villain that you can name and identify. And the whole point of crypto is it doesn't matter who it was. The whole point of crypto is that we should admire whoever had the insight to realize that this thing was ready to blow and they were the ones who got ahead of it. Right. The whole point of making this stuff open source and easy to understand is that if something is not secure, it's going to be broken. That is the whole point of crypto.
00:12:00.654 - 00:12:15.110, Speaker A: That is the argument that we are making of why we're creating a more robust system. And so then turn around and say, oh, somebody evil must have done this. And one of these evil TradFi firms that didn't want us to be having any fun I just think is against the whole spirit of crypto.
00:12:15.450 - 00:12:40.030, Speaker D: Yeah, it's a lot of the same logic people also use when they try to say, oh, we should ban flash loans or something like that, because they're used in all these different mean. This is literally like the I think Bloomberg had an article or the Journal had an article out this week talking about how dangerous flash loans are. And it's like, no, they're just a tool that is used to sort of accelerate the inevitable. Otherwise only wealthy people are going to be able to perform these kinds of attacks. A similar argument for Terra and sort of what happened here?
00:12:40.100 - 00:12:58.210, Speaker A: Well, it's the sensorious instinct, right? Like whenever markets go down, there are calls to ban. It doesn't matter where you are. Even in the US. People have banned short selling. Kevin, part of what you're well known for is having called it out, but I presume also having traded on the downfall of Luna. I don't know how much you're comfortable sharing, but I'd love to know how you played.
00:12:59.190 - 00:13:52.130, Speaker B: So, you know, I think at this point what I can say, because I don't want to give out the exact positions until all of this is over. And we still do have some positions open, but what I will say is that we were short pretty early on, but maybe this was May 6, I would say. And this is also right after we pulled all of our UST from anchor. So we were basically farming it down to the last day and then when it degged to zero point 97, we paid up 30 bips, got out of our UST position and then just started shorting Luna. Now, that being said, in between there was a lot of activity and there were even moments that we were long on local bottoms. And overall we actually played that pretty well. Though I'd like to joke with the traders that what's funny is that because we did some of these swing trades just based on sort of like the flows and the short term supply and demand imbalances.
00:13:52.130 - 00:14:18.894, Speaker B: If we had just held the thing from where we started to where we ended, we probably would have made about the same. So it wasn't that we did worse, but we just caused extra work for ourselves to sometimes miss out on parts of the down move and then sometimes just actually get randomly some parts of the up move. Now that being like most of it was on the short side and we actually did play both Luna and UST and there were also some other structural plays that are related tangentially, which were also very lucrative too.
00:14:18.932 - 00:14:44.566, Speaker D: I'm curious on the UST part how you played that because I think that was one of the common refrains you hear from traders in the market, which is there isn't actually a way to trade the UST peg and to sort of short UST effectively. I actually asked Doe about this when he came on, which I'm like, why aren't you taking a bet against UST? And it's like there's no way to hedge it. I'm curious if you don't mind sharing how you guys sort of thought about playing UST or is it just sort of this Anchor trade that you mentioned?
00:14:44.668 - 00:15:17.890, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, there are actually ways to trade UST. I mean, there are certain books out there with a few exchanges where you can trade UST against other stablecoins or against UST itself. So you could short it. What I would say is that when the Dpegging is first happening, it doesn't really make sense to short UST because they still have a lot of firepower on the reserve that they're going to burn through to defend the Peg. So you really only want to put on the UST short after two things. The first is that they run out of money to defend it or they just actually give up and want to save the rest of it. That's a little bit harder to tell.
00:15:17.890 - 00:15:53.402, Speaker B: And then the second thing is that you have to pay attention to the Redemption and Mint Mechanism and how much capacity that has, right? Initially, if it's 250 mil per day, then as long as the outflows of UST to Luna is less than that, then UST should not depeg. And UST would only depeg if it exceeds that kind of demand for swapping between the two. Now, later on, they started releasing this gate, right? And they said, okay, now we can do a million units of Luna per minute. And then eventually they released that entirely and just let it go into hyper. Hyperinflation. There was no gate whatsoever. All of those things matter.
00:15:53.402 - 00:17:24.474, Speaker B: And one of the things that I felt like we were a bit disadvantaged on, even though we traded this well, is that we don't know when these kinds of decisions will be made, right? It's all up to TfL and LFG and their inside war room to decide, oh, now we're going to change the limits on the Redemption Mint mechanism. Well, that completely affects whether or not you actually want to short Luna or UST. Now, I don't want to also spin any conspiracy theories, but what I would say is that there's at least the possibility that there were times where they were short their own asset, either UST or on the Luna side, based on the decisions that they were going to make. Like if they knew that they were going to release the gate, then Luna is definitely going to spiral and UST is at least going to be somewhat preserved from all the losses going to the hyperinflation of Luna, right? So in that sense, they could have just long UST and shorted Luna and just made that kind of relative value play, right, before making the announcement, make the announcement, everything rips or drops and then just close out, right? So I think there was a lot of information asymmetry not just for US that we were disadvantaged a bit, but on top of that to the general public, right? Like, whoever was not an investor, who was not part of the inside team didn't know when all of these arbitrary decisions would be made. We didn't know when they were going to start defending and when they were going to stop defending with the reserves either, right? And you can see that on the price chart. You can see where they actually spent money to defend and where they didn't. You can see like on the first DPEG, okay, they put it back to peg or very close to it, and then they let it drop and then they start defending again.
00:17:24.474 - 00:17:49.950, Speaker B: All this kind of stop and go execution for the selling of Bitcoin and the reserves to defend the Peg. I mean, whoever had inside knowledge of when that was going to happen very easily could have gotten out of their own UST position. They just need to know when that's going to happen. Dump their UST and when it's not happening. They could even buy a UST. They could even go long UST to dump it later once the Peg defense comes back. So I just feel like this whole thing was just not very transparent.
00:17:49.950 - 00:17:57.506, Speaker B: And I think at the end of the day, it's the insiders that benefited and it's the general public and I guess people on the other side like me that were a disadvantage.
00:17:57.618 - 00:18:32.922, Speaker A: So I've heard from someone who's very close to LFG that basically it was all Doe pulling the levers and that the folks who were around him were also in the dark. Nobody actually really knew what was happening that day. Again, I don't have a ton of details. And right now there's a lot of drama and fingers being pointed about how LFG actually spent the funds and whether or not the funds were actually used to how much of the funds were used defend the peg in the market versus as you sort of insinuated bailing out insiders who had their UST impaired. But we don't know. And it seems like a clear picture hasn't really emerged yet. But it is clear that LFG no longer has the Bitcoin.
00:18:32.922 - 00:18:42.098, Speaker A: They now have, I think, about 70 million out of the 3 billion that they previously had on hand. They definitely don't have it anymore, but how it was spent. There are a lot of questions being asked now.
00:18:42.264 - 00:19:20.174, Speaker B: I'm pretty sure that they did spend it. I think they did what they were supposed to do with the money. It's just that the timing was just very arbitrary. So whoever the market maker was that they did these two market makers that they did this deal with, and Doe himself had access to privileged information, who's to say the market maker? I wouldn't say that they just OTC it to themselves to get out of UST at the Peg. I mean, I don't think they would be that egregious, right? But they could still just push through the books. Right? And then you just know that in this minute there's just going to be a giant bid wall and then you just dump your UST into it. You pay up a little bit on the exchange side, but you mask a little bit of that activity and it's a little bit of like self trading right there.
00:19:20.174 - 00:19:43.720, Speaker B: Right. So that I wouldn't preclude. Now, I don't want to accuse them of doing something that I don't have evidence of, but I would like to see the war room chat logs. I would like to see some of these things. And now we don't have a right to that, but at the same time, I think for the sake of the space, I think and for the sake of their reputation, I think it would be nice for them to voluntarily give this up and be willing to show the public that what had happened.
00:19:44.170 - 00:19:55.610, Speaker A: Yeah. So speaking of the space and of reputations so I don't want this conversation to be too reductive, although it's fascinating the way that you the play by play of exactly what happened that day.
00:19:55.680 - 00:19:59.580, Speaker C: I have to ask Kevin one question. What's the highest funding rate you paid?
00:20:01.550 - 00:20:41.066, Speaker B: So I'll say that that would kind of give away whether or not we were playing during the hyperinflation period. And we were, but we were very also very cognizant of the funding rate and I think at some point it hit like quadruple or quintiple digits so it would be very expensive. Now that being said, the hyperinflation rate itself, I think at the very peak was a doubling of the supply every 18 minutes. So you can imagine that even extreme amounts of funding probably relatively is still a rounding error to just how bad the hyperinflation was. So yeah, I don't really want to give away exactly what we're doing during the hyperinflation period but we were definitely active in the market.
00:20:41.248 - 00:21:32.310, Speaker A: Fair enough. Yeah, I mean look, obviously from the perspective of a trade sounds like you guys absolutely nailed it but of know Terra has had much broader consequences through its mean. Not just is it obviously a catastrophic wipeout of a lot of paper wealth that has existed in crypto. It was, of course, a very attractive investment for a lot of retail investors. And there have been a lot of really awful stories about folks who completely lost their net worth, especially people in the terror community and even folks who have committed suicide or threatened to commit suicide or who lost more than they could afford to lose. So anytime that something like that happens, obviously there's a lot of tragedies underneath the headline of the economic wipeout. But of course the other thing that this has done is it's put crypto and DeFi absolutely center stage globally.
00:21:32.310 - 00:21:58.190, Speaker A: So everybody in the world was talking about this. It was the front page of the Wall Street Journal, front page of Bloomberg, there were hearings in Congress, south Korea is now talking about also holding hearings about what happened with Terra and it's pretty clear now that it's going to accelerate a response, most likely a regulatory one against stablecoins. So how are you guys seeing the overall reaction to the downfall of terror?
00:21:58.270 - 00:22:41.454, Speaker B: I guess I can start I mean I think this was kind of expected. Whenever you have something like this where 40, 50 billion just gets evaporated, there's going to be some people on the losing end where it's going to be devastating for them because maybe they put in more money than they could have afforded to lose. I would just say that at the very least that it happened now rather than later. If it was 100 billion market cap with 90 billion of bad debt, I mean it would have been even more devastating. Probably more lives would be lost. And that being said, I would also say that there's always some kind of psyops that is going on. I have no doubt that there would be people who end their lives because of this, but maybe not to the extent that it's made out to be.
00:22:41.454 - 00:23:29.598, Speaker B: Because I think there's also a narrative that's been driven by the TfL and LFG in that they just want a little bit less pressure from the shorts, they want a little bit less from the people who are against them. So they're trying to spin this narrative that people should take it easy. I think there's some there and then I think on the regulatory side I think this was bound to happen. I think Yellen was first saying that she doesn't think that stablecoins know some kind of systemic risk to the system but then know like the UK regulators coming out and saying that they got to regulate this thing more heavily because of what had transpired. So I think the response has been a bit mixed but I think it's to be expected. I mean this happens with every kind of financial crash in every market. There's always this sense of why wasn't there regulation to protect us.
00:23:29.598 - 00:24:00.634, Speaker B: And I think really for us to be a self regulating industry, I think that entire mindset has to change. It really comes down to the people who end up on the losing side to stand up and say that actually I want to take accountability for my own financial actions. It's not about the regulation that I'm taking personal responsibility. Right, so if the people on that side can do that then I think we would all benefit. Right, but really I think the puck is with them now and less with us.
00:24:00.672 - 00:24:00.826, Speaker A: Right.
00:24:00.848 - 00:24:09.020, Speaker B: And we have to see what kind of fallout comes from this. I imagine there would be more regulation but I'm hoping that that's not the case.
00:24:10.210 - 00:24:56.026, Speaker D: Yeah, this does feel like a very weird scenario in that it was treated or terror was so legitimized, you had big name VCs backing it up. The product that produced the stablecoin was extremely attractive to a number of different or a very large number of retail investors as opposed to being concentrated in a small number of people, even institutions. We were talking about these Terror SPVs, the anchor SPVs that were floating around arrington had like anchor anchor fund. It was just so pervasive. And I think also the end product was supposed to be this stablecoin. It wasn't like you were speculating on shiba inu or something like that, it was like supposed to be this really investable product that just ended up blowing up. And so in my mind it's very different than a lot of the.
00:24:56.026 - 00:25:37.026, Speaker D: Other crazy pumps and crazy speculation that happens in crypto in that it was so legitimized and it was supposed to be so reputable. I think other the thing that in my mind though, is that I think generally when we talk about regulation, it's because of fraud, right? Somebody claims they're going to do something, they're lying about it, and then we go after them and we try to make sure that that kind of fraud doesn't happen again. In this scenario, everything was very transparent. It was very obvious on chain what was happening with respect to Anchor UST, how the system worked. It's not like the LFG said they had billions of dollars in bitcoin and they didn't. They did. Maybe they could have been more transparent about how they used it, but they were honest about what they it's to an extent.
00:25:37.026 - 00:25:59.278, Speaker D: It is like how free do you want the market to be? I think it would be I would see a huge step backwards if we banned all experimentation around different types of financial primitives. And there was transparency in this scenario, but I don't quite know how you can design a regulation that protects retail investors here while also sort of enabling experimentation to happen that is still transparent and open.
00:25:59.364 - 00:26:01.038, Speaker B: Yeah, I definitely agree with that.
00:26:01.204 - 00:26:48.394, Speaker A: It's a really it's a really good point going into the collapse of Terra. So Dragonfly, I think we've mentioned this before, but we were seed investors into Anchor and this was kind of before Anchor became what it is, or what it was before the collapse of Terra. Right? So like Anchor, just for a quick way of background, anchor was kind of the principal sink where almost all of the UST in existence lived. And maybe it's worth doing a bit of exposition just to understand the buildup to the UST collapse. So Anchor got its start as basically a cross chain staking yield protocol. That's the way that it was pitched, is that it's like Lido ish, but it also has like this sort of money market component. So you can put in yield bearing assets and you get a yield and the yield gets juiced by ANC token on the borrower side and the depositors are paid out of a yield reserve.
00:26:48.394 - 00:27:10.726, Speaker A: Right? That's the idea. It's not rocket science, it's not the next maker dow, but it's something. Okay. It was a protocol. We put in a little bit of money and at the time DFI yields were very high. So the idea of a protocol that paid 20% yield, this is in the days of 100% APY, 75% APY, so having 20% guaranteed APY was reasonable. Right.
00:27:10.726 - 00:27:43.994, Speaker A: In the early days, Terra was anchor was not growing like gangbusters. But then DFI APIs declined, obviously very significantly. APYs on stablecoins are now sitting south of 2%. As this was happening, we saw broader decline in interest rates. Terra stood still. Anchor decided to maintain the exact same interest rate regardless of the broader market environment. And what that ended up doing was it made Anchor more and more attractive on a relative basis compared to the risk free rate and that caused UST demand to balloon.
00:27:43.994 - 00:28:15.370, Speaker A: Almost all the UST in existence lived in Anchor. And so Anchor I wrote an article kind of summarizing what happened in the Terra episode. And the way I described it is that Anchor was the cancer at the heart of Terra. Were it not for Anchor and its 20% APY, terra would not have blown up in such a catastrophic way. It wouldn't have grown so large. It could have at least mediated its own growth in a more market oriented way such that at least people would have, they wouldn't have warped incentives to try to ride this thing as close to the threshold as they possibly could. And that's ultimately what Anchor's incentivized growth, I think did.
00:28:15.370 - 00:28:58.866, Speaker A: The thing that I have been reflecting on for this last week is that on the chopping block before, we've talked a lot about Terra and Anchor and we've intimated a bunch of times that we thought it wasn't sustainable and that we were worried and that whatever. But we brought Doe on the show and we were very respectful to him. We've invested into other things on Terra. We've made three investments onto the Terra platform in our fund. Three and kind of are the view as VCs. And actually I talked to some other kind of marquee VCs who've told me in the past like dude, the risk reward for saying bad things about layer ones or about big communities is just not in your favor. Like as an investor, your job is to make great investments, find great founders.
00:28:58.866 - 00:29:46.706, Speaker A: And if you speak negatively about something that you see that you think is not sustainable or is not going to work, one, you might be wrong. Which, I mean, everybody in crypto has had that experience of thinking something wasn't going to work, and you were totally wrong. And then second is that even if you're right, what's the upside, right? Even if you're right, like, okay, maybe you get celebrated, maybe you get pulled on some podcasts, but mostly you just alienate a bunch of people for the things that don't break or that for the two years until UST actually explodes. You end up looking like an asshole and just pissing off a bunch of people and getting flamed. And so it got me thinking a lot because as know, I think about somebody like Eric Wall or somebody like Hasu or somebody like yourself who you guys are not VCs and as a result you can kind of be more transparent, right? If you see something you think is bullshit, your incentives are just why not just say that it's bullshit.
00:29:46.898 - 00:29:48.310, Speaker C: Eric is a VC.
00:29:49.610 - 00:30:36.594, Speaker A: Sorry to be clear Eric, you also do make early stage VC investments, but most of your trade is not simping to entrepreneurs the way that it is for a lot of the rest of us. And so the question that I keep thinking about is like, what could and should we have done differently? Because in private, we talked all sorts of shit about UST. When we look at what we want to invest into, and we get pitches all the time for things that are built on Terra and things that touch UST, pretty much everybody internally at Dragonfly, our internal conversations have always been that this thing is going to collapse. This thing is not sustainable. We didn't go out picking fights, tweeting at people claiming that Doe was and obviously Doe didn't make it easy because of how aggressive he was toward anybody who would impugn him on Twitter.
00:30:36.722 - 00:30:43.442, Speaker C: Don't forget, though, this show did come up with the moniker that tied Stablecoins to Ted Kaczynski.
00:30:43.586 - 00:30:52.162, Speaker A: We we did did we talked a lot of shit about algorithm. No, we did. We talked about algorithm. I think I talked about Basis in particular, which is, of course, the granddaddy of senior reshares.
00:30:52.326 - 00:30:55.914, Speaker C: Wait, we didn't talk about the fact that Doe invented ran Basis.
00:30:55.962 - 00:30:56.560, Speaker A: Cash.
00:30:58.370 - 00:31:03.710, Speaker C: How much do you believe this? Or do you think that's like sort of circumstantial reporting? Because I do think the evidence.
00:31:06.390 - 00:31:24.920, Speaker B: Within I've heard from employees within TfL, and I also want to say that I think it was on this podcast that I first heard the term that Tarun used to say about some of these algo Stablecoins. They're just like, you know, and I'd never used that analogy before, but I've adopted it into my own vocabulary. I think it was on this show.
00:31:25.370 - 00:31:32.570, Speaker C: Yeah, that was the same episode. I was drunk and decided to call everyone who makes an algorithmic stablecoin a Theodore.
00:31:34.430 - 00:31:50.094, Speaker B: So it just shows that in order to overcome the disadvantages of being undiplomatic in the space, we just need more alcohol. And then have these podcasts where you get all the VCs drunk and let's hear what they really have to think about some of these portfolio projects of their own and of other VCs, too.
00:31:50.132 - 00:31:56.370, Speaker C: For the record, being a VC is my second job. That's why I can be more blunt. I can be more blunt.
00:31:57.270 - 00:32:05.134, Speaker B: That's true. That's true. Well, we will be your mouthpiece, then, Haseeb. Just whisper me their name and I'll let people know. Just whisper.
00:32:05.182 - 00:32:08.694, Speaker A: All right, from now on, everybody knows Galawa Capital is saying what I really think.
00:32:08.732 - 00:32:27.590, Speaker B: So let that I'm just kidding. I wouldn't do that. I think one piece of public service is enough. I don't want the heat anymore myself. And like you said, I think you don't make any friends being on the short side. And if you look at all of our plays from before, all of our major plays, they were all on the long side. So I think someone else should do it.
00:32:27.590 - 00:32:43.614, Speaker B: I think I've done my service. I think that should be enough. Hopefully, people are not too mad at me. So it was the who's who of investors on that cap table, so hopefully people are not too mad. I tried to save everybody money. I did the best that I could, but there was too much of an echo chamber. What can you do?
00:32:43.732 - 00:33:07.430, Speaker C: What was your favorite dunk that you read over the entire thing that turned out to be obviously maybe false of all the dunks in the world, right? Because I would say march through May was Twitter filled with people on both sides dunking on each other nonstop. I'm sure you were the recipient of 50% of those. So I'm curious, what were your highlights from Twitter?
00:33:08.090 - 00:33:40.994, Speaker B: I just got dunked on so much by these Shill accounts. And then their strategy was so good, too, because they would never respond with their main accounts and they would just straight up astroturf with these accounts with such few followers that I wouldn't get the engagement. You know what I mean? So they're just, like, on one hand flaming me and flooding my comments with negativity and at the same time not even giving me the engagement for it. So there was a lot of that. I mean, there were some people saying, like, oh, you guys really think you guys really think there could be, like, a death spiral? Like, how stupid. Well, there was. It was a debt spiral after all.
00:33:40.994 - 00:33:44.210, Speaker B: So it was like stuff like Mean.
00:33:44.280 - 00:34:22.640, Speaker D: Tusib's point about being on the short side, too. Stuff does change over time, right? Like, you can sort of look at the LFG and say, oh, well, they were sort of backing into a fractional reserve model and upping the reserve factor over time, sort of as fracs exist right now, which is 80% backed by USDC and is working okay. And so it's like, you can imagine a world they do back into a 80% stablecoin backed version of Luna or UST with some remaining float backed by their own shares, and then it functions, okay, and then you look like an idiot, even though maybe at the time what you said was actually correct.
00:34:23.010 - 00:34:34.114, Speaker A: Well, I mean, there's a world of difference between backing something that's correlated with your own death spiral and backing with something that's uncorrelated with it, right? I mean, that's why a death spiral is scary, is because the feedback loop, right?
00:34:34.152 - 00:34:44.422, Speaker D: And that's what I'm saying. Hey, things can change over time, right? Like, you can imagine. They could also put some stable coins in the LFG. And so it's sort of like your criticisms can be correct at the time, but market conditions and products can change.
00:34:44.556 - 00:35:11.886, Speaker A: That is also true. And it's something that we reflect on often as entrepreneurs, as investors into entrepreneurs. Is that oftentimes the first pitch that you get for something. And the original, the V one, is a flaming pile of dog shit that isn't going to work, but they realize that they put something on the market and it fails. It fails almost immediately. And they're like, okay, well that didn't work, let's iterate, let's learn from that. And you end up iteratively backing into a better and better model and learning in real time.
00:35:11.886 - 00:36:12.866, Speaker A: And that's one of the advantages of crypto is that you can learn in public and sometimes, unfortunately, you learn with other people's money. But as long as there's a mutual understanding of okay, hey, this thing is it might not succeed, it's fine. I think the part of it that gives me the most pause is the degree to which we had very prominent members of the community basically pushing this stuff onto retail and advocating to retail like, hey, this thing is safe, it's super, you know, ignore all the naysayers. Even though we were investors in Anchor, we were way too mortified to ever tell anybody, put money in Anchor for us, we didn't put our own money in Anchor. And I think it is true. And, Tom, it's a good counterpoint, that look, sometimes things start off not working, and it's okay to give people room to figure things out, but there was something about the energy and the I don't know what the word is. I guess the disdain that the Luna community showed for the people who were ultimately trying to critique it, that showed bad faith, that resulted in making things worse for Know.
00:36:12.866 - 00:36:42.350, Speaker A: To your point, Kevin, short selling is really important. You cannot have price discovery without short sellers. And so short sellers, although it's much harder to make money short selling than it is to going long because things in crypto, obviously, as Luna did on the way up and down, they can go up a lot easier than you can only make two X if you short something to zero. But if you assuming you're not using leverage, but if you go long, you can make 100 extra money. And that's why as VCs, in many ways our jobs is much easier than somebody who's engaged in short selling, especially in a market like crypto.
00:36:42.770 - 00:37:32.810, Speaker B: Yeah, I would say that at least diplomatically, it's very hard to be a short seller. Some of the investors on their cap table, good friends of mine, and I've known them for many years and I remember sometime in December and January literally hitting them up and saying, oh, by the way, at some point I'm going to short this thing. So I just want to say sorry ahead of time. And that's kind of like how things are in the space. It's just like when you're long, you're long together, when you're short, you're alone and it's a tough lift. I would say just on the social side, like how many parties did I not get invited to because I was on the short side? Right? Like at least one or two, right? Because I don't know, I don't know what the counterfactual is, but I imagine just by the sense of things just by intuition, probably at least one or two.
00:37:32.880 - 00:37:40.298, Speaker A: Right, well, I suspect you're going to be invited to a lot more parties now and we will make sure that you get invited to all our parties.
00:37:40.394 - 00:38:35.370, Speaker B: I appreciate that. I appreciate that but yeah, no, I agree. I think there's a lot of this kind of like echo chamber effect and I think on top of that there is this sense of some of the investors and I want to say all because I think a lot of them are well intentioned, but some of them are in it only for a quick flip. So so whether they just burn retail and rug them, it doesn't really matter to them. Right. And this is something that's a little bit different than in some ways a step back from web two VCs where even if they were grifting like WeWork, they at least had to go through many, many years, through series D, through Series E, through the SoftBank round and then through into the public markets, right? Like even if they were doing a grift, they couldn't just do a quick flip, they had to really dedicate themselves to it. But I think in crypto, because time to liquidity is so quick now, the incentives there for the founders and for the VCs are really shifting and I think it really comes down to the personality of the people running it to not go the easy route.
00:38:35.370 - 00:39:26.674, Speaker B: And I think in the long run it benefits them even better to actually fund something that works. For example, like FTX for example, right. Something that's not a quick grift, that's an actual business that one day generates great revenues, deserves to be valued very highly rather than just recycle the money, flip it over and over again on these shitcoins. But it really comes down to then further up the waterfall to what the LPs want. Right? So, like, if you were ever to try and build a VC firm where you're only going to invest into things that have long term that you think has long term value and not purely optimized for financial gain, then the LPs have to be on the same page, that they have to understand that they could do better with their capital elsewhere, but almost in a slightly altruistic way. I mean, I think they'll still make money, but in a slightly altruistic way. Not pure profit maximizing and willing to fund a VC like that.
00:39:26.674 - 00:39:39.414, Speaker B: So it all rolls downhill, right? It all starts from the very top where the capital allocators sit and then all of that kind of culture starts to then every layer down the way starts to seep in.
00:39:39.452 - 00:39:39.606, Speaker A: Right.
00:39:39.628 - 00:39:41.400, Speaker B: So that's kind of what my thought is.
00:39:41.850 - 00:40:43.466, Speaker C: So I think actually you're getting to this point that's actually like cultural point about VC versus trading firms and one of the reasons I think a lot of actually pretty smart people I knew both from Tech and from Quant Trading were like, oh, we're going to build on Luna was effectively because of Jump. And Jump sort of pulled this sleight of hand of being trying to be both a VC and a trading firm at the same time. And effectively that's what led them also to have to try to save things at the end. But of course, I would say there was kind of this duplicity know, effectively a lot of really smart people were like, jump is a place that there are a lot of smart people at. They usually do well in normal markets. Crypto thing seems like scam, but Jump's doing it. So like, I'll go do something where is Jump saying is a good ecosystem? Oh, Terra and maybe Solana and okay, cool, yeah, I'll just go make a DeFi protocol on there.
00:40:43.466 - 00:41:32.550, Speaker C: I'll quit Citadel or I'll quit. And like, there's a lot of people like this, right, who fell for this trap. And at the same time, Jump basically had to effectively maintain the peg for everyone else. If we're being honest, just from a couple facts. One is they had to run a ton of Luna Validators because wormhole they had to actually be staked in Luna and basically be able to stake in both Salana and Luna to run the Wormhole Validators. So we can see their public addresses from that pretty clearly because there's not that many Wormhole validators, maybe like 15. And then I think the other thing that's interesting is trading firm tries to rebrand as a VC because the market structure changed and then sort of ensnared a lot of people who then sort of now are probably out of luck.
00:41:32.550 - 00:41:57.550, Speaker C: How do you feel about that from this perspective of like that's almost even like you were talking about how LPs had to be altruistic. Here you have actually the opposite. You have the LPs, which is the trading firm themselves is actually quite maybe antithetical to almost everything. Not just in the things they're investing in, but the things building on top of the thing they're investing in. Right. Which is actually, I think, in web two land. You never see that, right? There's a reason.
00:41:57.550 - 00:42:43.918, Speaker C: So when I worked at D Shad, they had this VC firm that was horrible and failed two Sigma, not a very good VC firm you can go see. And one of the reasons they're not very good is no one trusts them because they'll kind of rug you. And somehow there was a sleight of hand in the Saluna Vax 2021 where everyone just kind of was like, oh yeah, all the trading firms are great VC investors in our project. So how do you feel being on the trading side, watching that evolution? And what do you think the regression to the mean will be? Does it mean that the trading firms exit doing longer term things, do you think? Between Almeida and Jump, I feel like they sort of have both had this kind of impact on the market.
00:42:44.004 - 00:43:08.040, Speaker D: I think I want to hear Kevin Bose say that. I think there's a similar dynamic with FTX and Alameda where Sam is on Twitter talking about, oh yeah, we knew Luna was bad, we knew it was going to blow up, this thing was never going to work. And yet you listed it and UST. And so it's like, is there some moral hazard with running an exchange, having some say over what you actually want to list on the platform?
00:43:09.290 - 00:43:56.226, Speaker B: Yeah, I definitely agree with both of your guys'points. Maybe just to start, I want to say know, I think the reason that there was this sleight of handwritten jump, because I completely agree with you. I think trading firms, what's there to be said about them? Their entire job is to make money. And they're literally not in the business of losing money or being altruistic. I mean, even if you look at Sam, who's a very altruistic person, he's really separated that out into effective altruism and then right now just earn as much as he can, right? Like you don't ever want to in many ways in the market, handicap yourself while you're doing both things badly, rather do one thing well and then just funnel all of that into the other thing and do that well too. I think there was a sleight of hand. I think it was smart of them to have Kanov just lead the effort.
00:43:56.226 - 00:44:39.134, Speaker B: They realized they needed more presence online and they needed to do some branding and PR. And for the most part that was very successful. But I think everything is just a butterfly effect from the prior cycle. You had 2017 where you had all these quote unquote crypto VCs that basically rugged retail. And then around that time, it was when the trading firms were a lot more neutral about things and had not started their VC arms, right? So you had folks like CMS, you had like three arrows, you had all these guys who were on the trading side and they were actually being pretty honest about stuff and they're calling stuff out. They were not super long biased. And then finally, when it came to this cycle, the crypto VCs had a bit of reputational damage, the trading firms didn't.
00:44:39.134 - 00:45:32.502, Speaker B: They had now had enough money through that cycle to become VCs or they were managing too much money that they couldn't keep things market neutral anymore. So they had to go long. And then on top of that, all of the newer projects were a lot more centered around DeFi and financial concepts and they could benefit from both the market making from these trading firms as well as the expertise that these guys had that the VCs did not. Right? So all of a sudden the power and the influence shifted over to these trading firms. And then through that, well, then they learned the exact same lessons that the VCs learned which is that it is way better to be on the long side and be together on the long side and do a quick flip and you live long enough to see yourself become the villain. And I think that's literally what happened with all the trading firms. And I think it's no surprise to me that for every successful trading firm, they eventually get to a size where they're managing so much capital they are no longer able to deploy it market neutral and they always eventually set up VC and go long.
00:45:32.502 - 00:46:07.274, Speaker B: And then you can see the tone at which they talk about things shift too. And I think that's just a natural consequence of managing too much capital. So I think maybe the only way to avoid that is to just stick to one particular thing, do it super well and not scale up. Or you scale up and you just try and get the investors on the same page that look, we're actually not going to try and maximize. I mean, crazy to even think because these guys, it's in their DNA to maximize profit, but crazy to even say, but to get them to agree that that would be the case. But I think it's a lot of human nature. I don't even think there's anybody who's particularly at fault.
00:46:07.274 - 00:46:17.718, Speaker B: I don't want to really point the finger at Jump or 3 hours or anything like that. I mean, it's the natural course of being very good at what you do that you end up having too much capital that you're forced to go long into beta. Right?
00:46:17.884 - 00:47:19.490, Speaker C: And one thing I will say is I didn't want to single out Jump necessarily as a bad actor themselves, right? Like if you look at the code bases, they've contributed a lot. In fact, probably more in the last year than the TfL associated entities. I think if you look through the Luna code base, you'll be surprised at how few contributors there are in the last year. But I think they have by and large been pretty active on the development side in a way that I think trading firms usually aren't. I think the problem is the sleight of hand came in in that that was used to sell a lot of very smart people who are maybe just young and not didn't know the history of this type of stuff into thinking that we should go raise money from YC and put half of our fundraise into Anchor. There are so many stories like that and YC themselves was basically encouraging people. I mean, if you go look at the YC crypto list, 90% of the YC crypto companies are just front ends for Anchor.
00:47:19.490 - 00:47:47.700, Speaker C: And if you just take a little more time and dig into where their yield is coming from, they're not just putting into compound or Ave, they're 100% we're just putting into Anchor. And so I think there was kind of this extra duplicity where Jump's brand was then used to create this whole narrative of the smart guys think UST is the best. And that thing kind of really spiraled out of control in a way that I think we've never seen in either finance or tech.
00:47:48.150 - 00:47:48.514, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:47:48.552 - 00:48:07.442, Speaker B: And I think really it's just that there should be a slight change in the message there. It's not that these smart people think that it's going to work. It's that these smart people think that they'll be able to make money by backing this thing. And I think that's very different because they are very smart.
00:48:07.506 - 00:48:08.630, Speaker A: They are very smart.
00:48:09.370 - 00:48:16.554, Speaker D: I want to actually touch on Tarun's point around these teams that have raised money to build on Terra and maybe.
00:48:16.592 - 00:48:18.474, Speaker A: Sort of just like the sort of.
00:48:18.512 - 00:48:40.820, Speaker D: Next step or fallout from this. There's obviously the terra two proposal and there's teams that still have a lot of money that we're building products to work on top of Terra. Not the anchor front ends, but other d five applications and stuff like that. I'm curious what you guys think about the Terra two proposal and then maybe in tandem what these teams that are in the terra ecosystem are going to do next.
00:48:41.510 - 00:49:37.714, Speaker A: Honestly, I was sitting down today with an entrepreneur who basically they were building on Terra and they are like, okay, we're obviously leaving, we're not sticking around for terra two. What the hell is the point of Terra without UST, terra two is going to be a hollowed out shell of what Terra was. And so to the extent that they can salvage what they do have left and use it to try to make UST users whole and luna holders whole for the losses they've incurred, I'm supportive of that. I haven't spent a whole lot of brain cells trying to figure out what is the best way to do that exactly. But I think it's on them to do their best to try to salvage what they can. But the reality is that the vast majority of high quality entrepreneurs are not going to stick around because why would they? There's such better options. And terra, the dream is over, right? It's sort of like after the collapse of the Soviet Union, if you could leave, you're going to leave.
00:49:37.714 - 00:50:00.682, Speaker A: And you still do have to have the question of like, okay, how do you rebuild Russia, how do you rebuild some of the post Soviet states? These are hard questions and there's no good answers to them. And you have to do it. You can't run away from it. I should say not everyone can run away from it, but the smartest, the most capable, the most well known people, 90% of them are going to leave. And so I think that's going to result in terra being a shell of what it was.
00:50:00.816 - 00:50:52.302, Speaker C: So I feel like I've talked to maybe like ten to 15 terror projects and people I knew at terra projects over the last few. Days. And just on the sample size of say, 15, I would say there's like an exodus to probably salana and AVAX seem to be the top two contenders for most people and then third is sort of like polygon. I feel like those three seem to be the most likely places for people to go. There are people who are staying, although I think there's a lot of problems people are realizing from a technical implementation standpoint. Right? So the territory proposal has a May 27 deadline. But, for instance, Mars Protocol, which was sort of built by Delphi and people formerly from TfL Mars basically today was like, we can't guarantee anything will work in Terra Two.
00:50:52.302 - 00:51:36.362, Speaker C: Withdraw right now. Because without UST, literally none of the margining code is correct because it makes a lot of assumptions about the relative value of LP pool share as a function of the UST price. UST doesn't exist. That doesn't make sense. So there's a huge amount of technical debt to remove UST that I think at least, I mean, obviously it's like a very chaotic situation. So it's like I totally understand you don't have time to figure out the precise technical specs, but for instance, you need to have some way of redeeming all of these on chain assets, like an astroport LP share for UST. And another token such that people can redeem that without relying on the UST token, which is going to not exist in Terra Two.
00:51:36.362 - 00:52:13.560, Speaker C: So from a just like strict programming standpoint, I think even if you really, really are diehard, there's a huge amount of basically tech debt you're going to have to have, because we just turned this thing that was sort of reliable invariant of the virtual machine into a null pointer. And that is like a very weird that means you have to go change all your code, right? It basically means everything's wrong. Half of your audits are wrong now, right? So I think from a very practical standpoint, I actually think it's a really hard thing if you use UST anywhere in your code and that's literally every application.
00:52:14.650 - 00:52:59.650, Speaker B: Yeah. No, I definitely agree. I think there's a lot of secondary and tertiary effects there that haven't fully been thought through. I'm very curious as to why they didn't just have a UST, but instead of mint and redeem mechanism, just have it be like a make or die system where you just have some external collateral. At least then a lot of that code can be transported over. But then it begs the question where's that collateral going to come from? Because who in their right mind would have the confidence to actually create and mint this stuff by putting up good collateral on this new chain where we don't even know if it's going to be a complete dump fest or there's some residual recovery value. I would say that in their favor, at least there probably is some value, residual value to the block space to this L1 chain even without UST.
00:52:59.650 - 00:54:52.774, Speaker B: But how much is it? And whether or not there could be enough confidence restored that it can survive without being completely dumped again to zero as people's final Exit liquidity as a way for people to recover some amount of value because they're already scared shitless that this even happened. So really hard to say what my proposal to them was, which also Dove refused to take the call, is that I think that they should try and favor, one, what's fair, two, the smaller holders, and three, the folks that are least likely to dump. So whether it be by ignorance or whether it be by true belief, there were some people that just never moved their luna or never moved their UST throughout this entire thing and just held it from the point at which DPEG till now, and the address has never moved the coins, I would say that that's pretty strong hands. Whether it's stupidity or whether it's just actual belief, either way indistinguishable from each other. Maybe you want to favor them too, right? And then on top of that, you probably want to favor people even who are buying during the hyperinflating period, but where they didn't realize there was recovery value, right? So even if they're buying lottery tickets, maybe it's still fine. But once you announce that there's going to be a new chain or a new proposal to AirDrop people, well, then there's a lot more speculative demand, right? So what about doing some kind of timestamping on the announcement of that there could be this new proposal and then just anybody who was buying it before that maybe gets something a little bit more than everybody who was buying it afterwards, right? And then there's also political questions on how to deal with the exchanges, right? Because if they're not favoring the people who bought it during the hyperinflating period, then the exchanges are unhappy because their customers aren't happy with them, right? So it's just like if you piss off the exchanges too much, then they might not list your new coin anyway, so you got to throw them a bone, too. So I think that there's a lot of political considerations now in that all these different factions holding all of these different classic coins, they all want more of the pie from this new coin.
00:54:52.774 - 00:55:00.300, Speaker B: And I think figuring out how to divide it is a very tricky situation. But I think at least they should hear me out after all this.
00:55:01.950 - 00:55:13.306, Speaker A: All of that complexity is why bankruptcy law was invented. And so I guess, again, going back to like, speed running finance, we're rediscovering why some of these things are so complex.
00:55:13.498 - 00:55:16.926, Speaker B: Yes, definitely. We're definitely speed running finance, we're rediscovering.
00:55:16.958 - 00:55:20.334, Speaker C: Things which layer one is going to have bankruptcy law as part of consensus.
00:55:20.382 - 00:55:22.206, Speaker A: Rules for a failure?
00:55:22.318 - 00:55:51.210, Speaker C: No, just again, well, EOS did it by forking out block one first, which in theory TfL is doing to themselves here. Right. But I'm curious, if you were to guess of the existing chains that are live and have greater than a certain greater than like a billion dollars of TVL, who do you think will be the first to be like, our differentiator? Our differentiator is going to be we have bankruptcy law built in for settlement of these things.
00:55:51.360 - 00:55:53.754, Speaker B: I think that's a great idea, UST.
00:55:53.802 - 00:55:57.438, Speaker A: As a protocol, right? Yeah. I don't think there will be a.
00:55:57.444 - 00:56:01.706, Speaker B: Protocol that does it's too narrative breaking, though. It's just too narrative breaking.
00:56:01.898 - 00:56:12.558, Speaker C: I don't agree. I think there's a way to do M A protocols, and equally so, I think there's a way to do bankruptcy not for the layer one themselves, but for underlying applications, for app applications.
00:56:12.734 - 00:56:18.706, Speaker A: I think it'd be too hard to understand the app. No way. No way. It's too hard to understand the semantics of an app.
00:56:18.888 - 00:56:49.578, Speaker C: I'll make my prediction in this bear market, someone will basically build that even though it won't be called that, it will be know it's kind of the way Unisoft was not called an automated market maker when it started. It was just called a swap thing and people didn't understand it's. Like, still, its exposure is kind of complicated to most people who haven't thought about it. Right. So I think there's going to be someone who figures out some protocol that recycles dead, DeFi TVL and is able to kind of rehypothecate it and then redistribute it to more live protocol.
00:56:49.754 - 00:56:57.566, Speaker B: Do you think it would be too narrative breaking to even have that as part of the white paper? Because people are going to read it and think, wait a second, so this thing can fail?
00:56:57.678 - 00:56:58.340, Speaker A: Really?
00:56:59.510 - 00:57:13.046, Speaker C: This is why it needs branding. This is why you need the unicorn. No, but this is just something where if there's a protocol that's dead and the token holder is like, we want to get rid of it instead of the TVL, just but then what you.
00:57:13.068 - 00:57:17.910, Speaker A: Create now is you create lobbying, right? Like, now suddenly there are interest groups of like, oh, we deserve the TVL.
00:57:20.330 - 00:57:26.060, Speaker C: The protocol could literally just burn it. The L One could just take it and burn it into the L One.
00:57:26.910 - 00:57:29.980, Speaker A: If the thing is dead, then it's already effectively burned, isn't it?
00:57:31.070 - 00:57:51.726, Speaker C: But it doesn't reward the L One token holders. It doesn't reward the validators for keeping that state secure. Right. In spite of the fact that it's not generating any income. So what I'm saying is this will happen. There will be some smart kid who does this, but it does it for a totally different reason. Like, oh, I made a memory allocator that's very not fee agnostic.
00:57:51.726 - 00:58:06.342, Speaker C: And it knows how to do malice coalescence really well, actually. Oh, lo and behold, that actually does this TVL refresh thing. I'm just saying there's going to be like, lessons from this are going to reverberate and hopefully we get stuff like that, which would be cool.
00:58:06.476 - 00:58:45.054, Speaker A: All right, well, speaking of reverberations, the last thing that I want to end on is many people have said that this is the end of the cycle, that the collapse of Terra will be remembered as the last gasp of the 2020 to 2022 bull cycle, and that we're now going into a bear market. And obviously lots of assets are down from their peaks. Bitcoin is down, peak trough over 50%. A lot of DFI tokens are down 70, 80% L1s are down about 70% alt L1s. I should say it's been a pretty brutal market and obviously a lot of it this year, you know, it's comfy.
00:58:45.102 - 00:58:47.170, Speaker C: Tom and I malady holders.
00:58:47.830 - 00:58:48.742, Speaker A: Okay, that's true.
00:58:48.796 - 00:58:54.390, Speaker C: Actually, I heard this maladys are going close to all time high in ETH terms.
00:58:54.540 - 00:59:44.790, Speaker A: NFT floor prices have been doing pretty well. They've been doing pretty well. I actually heard that during the Terra downfall that actually there was enormous amount of trading volume in NFTs on Terra because of course, people couldn't get through wormhole while Terra was falling apart. And so you saw tons as Luna was hyperinflating, people just started buying up NFTs, whose prices were going up like crazy, which is exactly what you see in a bankroll, is people start dumping currency to buy commodities. And so the effective store of values were Terra NFTs, which I've also heard are looking for a new home. So we'll see where that ends up. But anyway, to finish the point, obviously a lot of the downturn this year has been driven by macro, but it seems like Terra gave an extra nudge to the bearishness around Crypto.
00:59:44.790 - 00:59:57.050, Speaker A: So how are you guys and Kevin, given that you're a trader, I'm sure that this is the water you swim in. How are you thinking about where we are in terms of the cycle?
00:59:57.790 - 01:00:29.390, Speaker B: Yeah, I think overall, at least historically, from what I've seen, the more severe the drop, the shorter the bear market lasts. And I think a lot of it is because when everybody's kind of on the same page that this is the bear market, that this is it. Right. Then it's just like there are no new pessimists to sell the price further down. Right. As opposed to you look at very long bear markets, right? Like, for example, after the 2017 one or after 2013 one that was even brutal. And it's because a lot of that was just the digestion of hope.
01:00:29.390 - 01:01:03.994, Speaker B: As long as there is hope, as long as there are some bulls, then there are still some people to be convinced that is a bear market and they will then sell at some point. So I think the bear market bottom is only reached when basically there's no marginal seller left. Everybody is already feeling like completely bleak and there's no hope left. And for the people still holding onto the coins, they're so diehard believers that they will never sell at any price. So basically during every cycle, all these coins move from weak hands to strong hands. And there are some that are so strong that they will just never sell, which forms the bottom. And then there's the rampant pessimism.
01:01:03.994 - 01:01:41.542, Speaker B: Then it eventually dissipates into optimism. So I think for this, I think it's actually good that it happened now that it happened so severely. Because I was thinking that if it happened later, it'd be another nine months, it'd be another 18 months and it could even take like multiple years. But now after this thing, I'm thinking, well, maybe not as long, maybe like six to nine months is enough. But that being said, we're not actually controlling the markets anymore in crypto ourselves because the Fed itself, it could do whatever it wants. And everything's so correlated to equities. Hopefully this decoupling, we thought there was going to be decoupling, we thought crypto was going to decouple up, it decoupled down, right? But at least there was some kind of decoupling, blew out all the correlation algos.
01:01:41.542 - 01:02:19.174, Speaker B: So now all those guys have to rejigger their algos. They're not going to hold things as tight in a band to equities. So hopefully the decoupling has already happened. We do decouple from equities even further and maybe another six months. Now, if that's not the case and we're still trading basically whatever the Fed wants to do, then it's just like we're just going to follow the rest of equities until they capitulate. And then it's more about macro, about when they think either inflation has subsided enough or the market has dropped enough because of the green span bernaki put, if it drops a certain amount, then at some point they just capitulate and maybe we just all die by inflation. So all those are possible.
01:02:19.174 - 01:03:00.200, Speaker B: So either the Fed or hopefully very soon, because I'm actually a bit more on the optimistic side, but I would say at least in the near term, a lot of funds blew up, so their LPs are going to be redeeming out of them. So that's going to cause a lot of forced know. Initially there was a lot of forced selling because of people defending their toxic margin positions by selling good assets. Then there was a relief rally because anytime there's a lot of forced selling, there's a bounce back. And then after that, now there's once again forced selling on the longer cycle, on the monthly maybe one or two month cycle where funds basically unwind and close shop and have to sell assets to redeem out investors. And then after that, we'll probably another relief rally and then hopefully then it'll be good by then.
01:03:00.890 - 01:03:04.630, Speaker A: It sounds like what you're saying is that the pessimism is cause for optimism.
01:03:05.450 - 01:03:06.278, Speaker B: Yes, exactly.
01:03:06.364 - 01:03:06.566, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:03:06.588 - 01:03:25.086, Speaker B: I mean, when everybody's riding the high of mania, there are no new pessimists at all, right? There are no new optimists at all. Everybody's just max long and then just the tiny little prick of the bubble can just completely crash everything. So same thing for the bottom of the bear market. When there's no new marginal sellers and all the people who hold it will.
01:03:25.108 - 01:03:52.342, Speaker A: Never sell, then price can only go mean. One thing that struck me about this whole Terra collapse is that obviously everybody kind of knows who was exposed, who was talking about it, who owned Terra on the books. Everyone I have talked to says that they're okay, and I'm like, okay, somebody must be lying to me. I don't know who it was. I don't know where this $14 billion of USD I literally said the same.
01:03:52.396 - 01:04:01.462, Speaker C: Thing to Robert yesterday. I was like every single person I asked if they had any Lunar or Ustx, but, like, no, I sold Luna for, like, 40 X. Don't worry.
01:04:01.516 - 01:04:03.382, Speaker B: Everybody tells me that they are totally fine.
01:04:03.436 - 01:04:04.070, Speaker C: Fucking way.
01:04:04.140 - 01:04:05.078, Speaker B: Don't believe this.
01:04:05.164 - 01:04:08.090, Speaker C: There is no way that's true. No fucking way that's true.
01:04:08.160 - 01:04:09.530, Speaker B: Yeah, I think there's no way it's true.
01:04:09.600 - 01:04:17.786, Speaker C: There's this collective delusion amongst a bunch of people, and it's a game of chicken until we read the news story and Bloomberg.
01:04:17.898 - 01:04:36.500, Speaker B: Yeah, I would say that there's no way that's true. But what would be even more harrowing is that if it was true, because then it really means that the insiders just dumped on retail, but they got out unscathed. Right? That would be even worse of an outcome that would be absolutely devastating for the space. Retail is not coming back for, like, three years after that, if that's the.
01:04:37.110 - 01:05:09.578, Speaker A: I mean, I think that there's definitely an element of that, right? Like, who was holding Luna? Who was watching curve pools? Probably the sophisticated investors, right. Who really understood the death spiral? It was sophisticated investors who were the first people coming out of anchor when the rush started for people to leave. Anchor who were selling out at 95 was sophisticated investor. It was not retail. Retail were almost certainly the most likely to have held to the bottom. So I think that's true. Although I did hear of one fund that did admit that they never sold USD.
01:05:09.578 - 01:05:25.342, Speaker A: But only one only a single fund that I heard of that admitted to holding onto USD. Everybody else it was an Asian fund. Everybody else I've spoken to claims that they're totally fine. It's like, oh, no, we're totally okay. It wasn't a big deal. We're all good. CZ.
01:05:25.406 - 01:05:29.894, Speaker B: Said that Binance never sold. They held their entire stake up and down to zero, basically.
01:05:30.012 - 01:05:33.762, Speaker A: I mean, I can believe that. I mean, for Binance, it probably wasn't forgot.
01:05:33.826 - 01:05:37.078, Speaker C: They probably forgot that they was part.
01:05:37.084 - 01:05:40.406, Speaker A: Of a fired team that is somewhere in cold storage. They don't even know how to get it out.
01:05:40.428 - 01:05:45.720, Speaker B: A couple of days ago, CZ. Sits down and is like, wait, so we actually own this stuff? Like what? Like, how do we get this?
01:05:46.170 - 01:06:05.300, Speaker C: Well, he did write that tweet that was just like, I never even heard of this thing. That's great. He's like, oh, this thing is giving me so much stress now and I'd never even heard of it. Who cares about USD wrote something like that. That was, like, amazing.
01:06:05.670 - 01:06:12.340, Speaker B: Yeah, CZ he just lost from the peak like a yard and he's like, no, not a big deal. There's plenty where that came from.
01:06:14.070 - 01:06:38.650, Speaker A: Well, amazing. Well, it's been a harrowing week, and I think in part we have you to thank for the sanity that has finally come over crypto. It seems like it's going to be a bear market for a while, which means things are going to be a little quieter, thankfully. But we'll have a lot more chopping up to do as we get into this next cycle.
01:06:40.270 - 01:07:01.490, Speaker C: One thing I really miss, I wish we had talked about a little bit was the stake d th peg, because actually on this show about two months ago, I was like, one of the big risks that we have to think about is the staked ETH thing. And I think the luna cascade into that was a very amazing thing to watch on chain.
01:07:02.390 - 01:07:16.246, Speaker A: Yeah, there's so much to untangle about this story, and obviously an hour is not enough for us to really get to the bottom of it. But there were so many things and then, of course, there was a tether scare and there's a lot more that so maybe we'll do what was that.
01:07:16.268 - 01:07:20.442, Speaker B: Protocol that hard coded UST as equal to a dollar? They just hard coded it.
01:07:20.496 - 01:07:24.086, Speaker C: There was some protocol that did kava USDX.
01:07:24.278 - 01:07:26.586, Speaker A: Oh, that's right. Yeah.
01:07:26.768 - 01:07:42.526, Speaker B: It's a big face palm on that one. That's a big face palm. They were so confident you should give all of luna v two to those guys because they're really confident that the peg would have held. I mean, those guys believe anything. So give them all the luna v two. There was a strong handsome there and.
01:07:42.548 - 01:07:46.750, Speaker C: They'Re a maker system, so they could accept it as collateral.
01:07:47.570 - 01:07:48.830, Speaker B: Okay, there you go.
01:07:48.980 - 01:08:01.666, Speaker A: Look, to be fair, how many on chain protocols are prepared for global settlement? For maker? Probably not. If maker triggered global settlement, probably half the things in DeFi would break that's.
01:08:01.698 - 01:08:18.460, Speaker C: Fair percentage than you think. Though I do think the urine ecosystem has a bunch of things built around it. I agree. In the sense that non ETH based system, no one even.
01:08:22.350 - 01:08:30.574, Speaker A: So we do have to wrap. But Kevin, thank you so much for coming on and sharing with us your wisdom and insights. And I hope you're invited to a lot more parties going forward.
01:08:30.692 - 01:08:32.826, Speaker B: No, I appreciate that. Yeah, send me the invite.
01:08:32.938 - 01:08:37.280, Speaker C: Kevin, remember I invited you to a party before. That's true.
01:08:38.290 - 01:08:48.070, Speaker B: Did you know what? Everybody's still hating on me. Tarun invited me to a party. So there you have it. So I appreciate that. Appreciate that invite and send me all the invites and really appreciate you guys having me on.
01:08:48.140 - 01:08:51.974, Speaker A: The podcast was a pleasure. All right, that's everybody.
01:08:52.092 - 01:08:52.502, Speaker B: All right.
01:08:52.556 - 01:08:54.290, Speaker A: Take care. Bye.
