00:01:12.626 - 00:01:20.130, Speaker B: graphday. Today's guest is Tasha Che, founder of Tasha Labs. Welcome, Tasha.
00:01:20.290 - 00:01:21.766, Speaker A: Hi, Laura. How are you?
00:01:21.868 - 00:01:42.160, Speaker B: Great. So happy to have you here. This week you wrote an epic thread on the collapse of Terra and Luna, and what you said were that there were five non obvious lessons from this fiasco. Before we get to those, can you give people a general summary of what kind of business you think the stablecoin business actually is?
00:01:43.010 - 00:02:45.122, Speaker A: So, in general, I think stablecoin is in the business of transforming risk or volatility. So the buyer of stablecoin average users, you don't like volatility of your token prices going up and down. You prefer to hold a stable value of the asset. So that's why you buy stable coins. So basically, you sell that volatility to the stablecoin protocol and they bought the volatility and they give you this asset that promised to always be priced at one. So it's like, in that sense, you can think of them as in an insurance business that's ensuring there's some kind of price stability of your asset, or you can think of them as in the banking business. Basically, you deposit variable priced assets and they give you this certificate, meaning the stable coin that is priced at one that has 0% interest rate per se, right? And then basically you hold that certificate and it's promised to be worth one dollars.
00:02:45.122 - 00:03:46.398, Speaker A: So I think when you look at stablecoin protocols, how they make money, right? So where does the value added come from? Part of value added is they provide a service of guaranteeing the stable price. So that is a feature that is demanded in the market. That's why it has a positive value added. That's also one way they can make money is have a surcharge to charge for the service that they provide in terms of specifically how this charge is operationally being collected, whether it's through a redemption fee, whether it's through a token that is served as a signing or rich equity token or some other mechanisms that specific can vary. But this is one service, value added service they can provide. The other way they can make money is obviously through some kind of arbitrage of tokens. If you deposit variable price tokens that has limited supply.
00:03:46.398 - 00:04:31.394, Speaker A: So over time, other things equal those token prices should go up versus vis a vis dollars, which has a nominal depreciation. You can think of the nominal GDP because the money supply of US dollar grows broadly align with the nominal GDP growth, which is about 5% a year. So you think of that as a nominal depreciation against the fixed supply assets of USD token. So in that sense, over the long run, these protocols, there is a long term arbitrage opportunity there, even if they don't do anything short term investment with your assets. That's how I look at these. You can think of that as an insurance business, as a banking business, and.
00:04:31.432 - 00:04:45.030, Speaker B: In your Tweet thread you laid out what seems to be a viable scenario in which a stablecoin issuer could make money. But obviously with Terra Luna, things went wildly wrong. What do you think caused Terra Luna's downfall?
00:04:45.530 - 00:05:29.254, Speaker A: Okay, so this is a very interesting question. Know, after the Luna fall, a lot of people are saying, okay, under collateralized, stablecoin definitely do not work. Well, I think that's wrong. I think they definitely do work. Why do I think so? Because they do work in real life. There are about 200 fiat currency in the world and about 40% of them run a fixed exchange rate, either Visa vis dollar or Visa vis euro or a basket of currencies. So you can think of 30, 40% of fiat currencies in the world try to maintain a stable peg versus a larger fiat token and about 30% of them runs a so called floating exchange rate.
00:05:29.254 - 00:06:23.026, Speaker A: And the rest of them are sort of in between. So central banks usually monitor the value of their currencies, their exchange rate, to make sure it's stable. It fluctuates in a kind of predefined band, but it's not like a fixed per se. But my point is, a lot of the fiat currencies in the world, you can think of them as stable coins and they are under collateralized. Why? Because you can look at foreign reserve to broad money ratios of all the fiat currencies in the world, I think on the average it's like 35%. So it's not like if you have a fixed exchange rate visa vis the US dollar, for example, if you're a UAE, if you're Panama, you run a fixed exchange rate visa vis dollar. But does that mean that every money that you issue is backed by one dollars of USD? No, it's about again, 35% reserve to broad money ratio.
00:06:23.026 - 00:07:07.234, Speaker A: That's the average. So you can say, oh, all these fixed exchange rate tokens, they are undercoverized stable coins. But there are some important differences here. Then obviously the question is, okay, why do these work? Why does Luna not work? I think the most important difference here is that does the token itself, does this currency itself have an uncorrelated demand with the demand for a stable asset. So in fiat currencies cases, every country, you can think of it as a sovereign economic system. So you have real world trade and commerce activities. Those all use the local fiat currency.
00:07:07.234 - 00:08:00.450, Speaker A: So it's part of the local economic system and its demand is being supported by the real economic activities. You use these to pay transactions, local prices are priced in local currency, governments use these to accept tax payments and they pay their employees of public sector using their local currency. So all these activities are using the local currency as a medium exchange and a unit account. And those are the organic natural demand for the local currency that is uncorrelated with the need to pack against the US dollar or not. So that means you have a natural floor of demand as long as the economic activities does not go to zero, which is pretty improbable. But if you look at online stablecoins, you do not have that. Luna, for example, UST is supported by the Luna Token, which you can think of as the collateral asset for the UST.
00:08:00.450 - 00:08:44.318, Speaker A: But Luna has an ecosystem. Yes, but it's very small compared to any of the real economies, even the small nation states. So you have in the Luna ecosystem, 70, 80% of the TVL used to be the Anchor protocol, which was entirely riding on the UST deposit rate of being like a 20%. Right. So that's entirely tied to UST and the rest of the ecosystem. Liquidity. A large part of it is just Luna staking, token staking, and you have some D five protocols, but those also tend to center around the use case of Luna and UST.
00:08:44.318 - 00:08:59.814, Speaker A: So the ecosystem is quite small. You don't have the luxury of a typical fiat currency as a collateral asset with uncorrelated demand. Yeah.
00:08:59.852 - 00:09:24.434, Speaker B: And you sort of started to hint at this. But another part of the Tweet thread was that you said another lesson from this was that Fast expansion without actual network effect equals and then you put a skull and crossbones, which you were kind of implying that Anchor kind of drew a lot of people in really fast, but that it wasn't actually creating a network effect. Which also really struck me, I don't know if you wanted to add more.
00:09:24.472 - 00:10:13.342, Speaker A: On, you know, back in the know, I put out some tweets on Twitter about the sustainability of Luna and then the Luna tribe tried to argue with me and know, look at the UST adoption growing so fast. There's a huge network effect. In my view, there's zero network effect for a stablecoin because your stablecoin is a utility product. The entire feature of the stablecoin is to guarantee it's worth one dollars. If you take that feature away, there's nothing left. This is another important differentiation from any fiat currency that runs a fixed exchange rate. Because you can have a fiat token you can peg to US.
00:10:13.342 - 00:10:43.278, Speaker A: Dollar, you have a stable exchange rate. That's all well and good, but you are your own sovereign currency. The feature or the selling point of your currency is not like you're worth one dollars. The selling point is you're providing a service in real economy as a medium exchange and the unit account in your own economy. So if you can maintain a one dollars peg, great. If you cannot, well, that's not the end of the world. You still have an economic ecosystem that runs on your local currency versus the stable coin.
00:10:43.278 - 00:11:25.030, Speaker A: The entire value proposition rise on the point that you are being worth $1. If you take that away, nothing is left. That's why I think it's kind of a misguided effort for a lot of Elgo stablecoin protocols to try to business dev their adoption, try to get into more DeFi protocols to be used as collaterals, or involved in DeFi, borrowing and lending, or to get on other chains. I think all these efforts, if your underlying collateral assets do not have a good network effect like a fiat currency does, then most of these efforts will be wasted. Because if you lose a peg, that's game over. Yeah.
00:11:25.180 - 00:12:10.390, Speaker B: So in a moment, we're going to talk about also the network effect for the reserve asset. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible. Graphday will be a giant leap in the growth of Web Three. Whether you're just breaking into Web Three or already building and defining it, the future will meet the present in SF, June 2 through fifth, come meet and party with your online friends IRL and hear cutting edge developments in the Web Three stack revealed by Web Three founders and visionaries pushing forward decentralized protocols and applications. Then build at Graph hack compete for over $400,000 worth of bounties and learn best practices from top developers in the space like Nader Dabbit and Camilla Ramos. Get your ticket@thegraph.com, Graphday.
00:12:10.390 - 00:12:42.950, Speaker B: It's time to bring Wall Street to Main Street. Coinchange is democratizing access to wealth management with low risk, high return passive income through DeFi. It's simple. Just deposit your crypto into a cochange high yield account to earn more over time. Your yield is paid out daily and can be withdrawn anytime. Cointange's yield farming doesn't utilize lending or other risky strategies. No minimums, no obligations, just high yield.
00:12:42.950 - 00:13:24.634, Speaker B: It's time for a change. Create an account today at Tridefi CC UNC to receive 40 USDC. That's TRC UNC. Back to my conversation with Tasha. So another point again, that just really struck me was that you said it's a network effect for the reserve asset, in this case for Luna, not for the stablecoin itself, that matters. And that, to me, said everything. Because that was precisely why luna just plummeted the second that the peg wasn't holding because the only reason for its existence was just to try to prop up UST.
00:13:24.634 - 00:13:53.030, Speaker B: But since that was already falling, there was no other reason for anybody to try to own luna and frankly hold onto it rather than sell it. Yeah, which I just thought was so spot on. But do you want to talk about that point? And then also another one of your takeaways, which was you said smaller is beautiful, which I believe you were referring to just the general ecosystem of any particular stablecoin.
00:13:53.450 - 00:14:33.342, Speaker A: Yeah. So the network effect, to me, the closest resemblance I can think of as a typical fiat currency in the crypto world would be the blockchain platforms, native tokens for those blockchain platforms that has a more diverse set of use cases. So I'm talking like Ethereum or even you can include newer ones like Solana Avalanche. These are apparently all very new, so their network effect is pretty weak and all the use cases on chain are quite correlated. Right now you have DeFi, you have NFT not much anything else. Right. But you can think of these still as like an emerging economic ecosystem.
00:14:33.342 - 00:15:45.770, Speaker A: My framework of looking at these platforms will be like national economies in the metaverse. I think they're going to be in coming years, a growth to be more complex, more diversified economic ecosystems that are similar, that mirrors the physical economies in the nation states. So I think the native tokens for those would be a good place to start in terms of thinking of your reserve assets. But if you're like a stable coin that you have a brand new reserve assets like FRAX, for example, they have this essentially signing RH share token which is Fracs share. But you think of this token, it doesn't have much of else use cases. Okay? You can use it like staking something in DeFi, but that's kind of sort of semi ponzi ish use cases, I would say. Right, so then you want to think about how do you create uncorrelated organic on chain use cases for these collateral tokens? The network effect for those tokens are going to shore up your demand when things go haywire.
00:15:45.770 - 00:16:55.982, Speaker A: That's one. And then like you said, I also mentioned smaller is beautiful because obviously when you invest in any enterprise, any project, any stablecoin project, also you want it to be big, you want it to make as much money as possible to become the market leader. But this is also kind of a special case, a special sector because it's really a crucial infrastructure in the on chain economy for any blockchain platform. So you think know, if you build a new layer once, what kind of key infrastructure do you need? You need a bridge, you need an AMM, and you need a stablecoin. Those are like a key infrastructure for the on chain, like a financial system to function smoothly. So I think this stablecoin sector already serves a very systemic important role in the crypto economy. On top of that, so if these protocols grow really big and like in the lunar case, they de packed and they don't have any lender of last resort to actually build them out, to actually help to buy the UST.
00:16:55.982 - 00:17:59.414, Speaker A: Right with national economies in nation states, at least you have some resource in international lending facilities that you can borrow from other countries, essentially to temporarily assure up the demand of your native fiat if you have drastic capital flight or something. So in the stablecoin world, you don't really have that. Whether we will see something like that being like cross protocol insurance mechanism or lender of last resort that is private sector based, I don't know. But right now we don't. That means the bigger you are, the harder it is to find people to rescue you. Because there are a handful of the larger players with sufficient liquidities in the crypto space. You can name them, you can pretty much count them with your two hands, but if your market cap goes beyond that, if you DePass severely enough, you just really don't have people to rescue you.
00:17:59.414 - 00:19:10.140, Speaker A: So I think in a more healthy ecosystem would be if we have ten to 20 smaller medium sized stablecoin projects, they have their own packing designs, they have own separate collateral basis, that would be a more resilient ecosystem compared to what we have now, which you have USDT. USDC, and the third one used to be yeah, I think this is something also for the blockchain platforms themselves to think of, obviously like protocols like near, they're already doing that though. I don't know if their motivation is as I described, but if I were a layer one protocol, this will be something that I will build or at least collaborate with some projects to build on my platform as a sort of semi public good. Because this is like basic infrastructure. It's not necessarily I would necessarily need this stablecoin protocol to be super big, but it provides a key service on my platform, that's all. So I think smaller in size, that in itself has more resilience built in.
00:19:10.510 - 00:19:38.600, Speaker B: And so at the moment, the Terra community is voting on a proposal put forward by Do Kwan, the co founder of TerraForm Labs, in which he would like to fork the chain and call the original chain Terra Classic and basically give various people who held either Luna or Terra previously new tokens. What do you think of that plan? And also just in general, what do you think would be the best way for Terra to move?
00:19:40.330 - 00:20:33.542, Speaker A: Not, I do not have the answer for Terra basically. But the thing is, well, you can argue, okay, you have brand name recognition though, right now, how much the brand equity is worth, whether it's positive value or negative value, I don't know. And you also have a community of people, right? Though a lot of people are pretty grudgy right now, pretty angry, right? So if you want to build a new stable coin, you probably want to over collateralize. Go with more of a die model, for example. Basically to make sure the probability of this thing goes unpack is extremely small if they want to revive the thing. I have no idea about the prospect of how successful that will be.
00:20:33.676 - 00:20:41.580, Speaker B: And you mentioned FRAX finance earlier, but given everything that you've said, which stablecoins are you excited about?
00:20:43.550 - 00:21:40.730, Speaker A: I'm excited about the USDC. You can argue, okay, centralized, the can scale, confiscation risk, so on and so forth, but at least it's backed by actual US dollar cash or liquid US dollar assets. So utility wise, the pack should stay. So if we're talking about stablecoin as a utility product, then this product fulfills its utility pretty well. So in terms of algo stablecoins, I think there are different designs, people are exploring different mechanisms. But I think there has been some consensus emerging that you need some kind of collateral. It cannot be just a dynamic adjustment scheme like Luna.
00:21:40.730 - 00:22:37.694, Speaker A: So the Fracs that I mentioned, there are one model, which is, if you think about it, it's kind of like a fiat currency that runs a pegged exchange rate because you are collateralized fiat currency, they have foreign reserves that they can use to open market operation to defend their currency. So in FRAC's case, it's USDC, right? So it has foreign assets. The percentage foreign assets should be pretty high. The rest of your collateral does not have a uncorrelated demand on chain right now. So I think if you have a collateral token that has strong network effect, the stronger it is, the lower your reserve ratio can be. As I said, the medium reserve ratio for fiat currencies are 35%.
00:22:37.892 - 00:22:58.146, Speaker B: All right, well, I guess this brings us to the last point that you made in your Tweet thread, which is you said regulatory standards are a nuisance until they're not. So what do you think will happen regulatory wise now that Terra Luna has imploded? And how do you think that will affect the growth of the stablecoin space from here on out?
00:22:58.248 - 00:23:55.170, Speaker A: Obviously I'm not the government, so I cannot say what governments are thinking. But I think the trend is it's drawing a lot of tension. Right. So, especially in the countries that issue the fiat currency that stablecoins are pegged on, meaning United States, the regulators should be thinking pretty hard about how to regulate this and the frameworks they would use. Like we mentioned at the beginning, you can think of these businesses as a similar business model as insurance or banking. So I think regulatory frameworks in those sectors should at least lend some viewpoints to the regulations of stablecoins. The other thing is there is know when I say regulatory standards, it doesn't necessarily have to come from government, right? So the other day, I posted on Twitter that I think a stablecoin industry can use something like a Basel Agreement.
00:23:55.170 - 00:24:39.190, Speaker A: So if people are not familiar with the Basel Agreement in international banking, it's basically a multilateral cross country kind of standard banking standard set up in the 1980s after a bunch of banking crisis in the 70s in multiple countries. So the Basel Agreement is like, you have a set of standards as a bank. Your capital ratio should be this much, your leverage ratio should be this much, your liquidity ratio, so on and so forth. Right. But Basel itself does not have any regulatory authority. So it's not like as a country's financial regulator has the legal mandate to actually enforce any of this. It's just international agreement.
00:24:39.190 - 00:25:10.810, Speaker A: It's a best practice. If you want to join, great. If you don't want to join, nobody is forcing you. But if you join, this is a brownie point on your reputation, obviously, as a bank. Right. So it can help if you comply with the Basel Agreement, other banks who do the same look at you favorably. They're more inclined to do business with you and you have more confidence among your users.
00:25:10.810 - 00:25:53.870, Speaker A: So, again, this is all voluntary set up as a multilateral agreement to preserve the reputation of the industry, essentially. So it's a public good that is not like legally enforced or enforced by any country's regulatory regimes. So I think something similar will be really useful for the stablecoin industry, something that across different protocols come together to think about what would be the standards that the industry should abide by without having any legal enforcement or outside regulators coming to regulation threat. Bang on your head.
00:25:53.940 - 00:26:11.122, Speaker B: Yeah, some kind of mandate. Yeah, I totally agree. By the way, people definitely should check out this thread and you might have even put it into a post, I believe, or at least I feel like I saw a post on this. But you have a newsletter. Do you want to tell people where.

Terra struggles to revive amidst infighting and regulatory pressure in the wake of UST's collapse, the Terra Luna community sought a way forward even as it demanded more details on what happened to the Luna Foundation Guard's $3 billion crypto reserve. And as regulators came knocking, TerraForm Labs cofounder Doe Kwan made two proposals to revive the chain. Both were massively criticized by the community and even by big names like Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin and Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao Zhou. Kwan's third proposal consisted of forking Terra into a new chain without an algorithmic stablecoin.
00:27:58.786 - 00:28:43.438, Speaker B: The idea is to rename the current chain Terra Classic and the current native token as Lunc Luna Classic. The new chain Quant proposes would be called Terra with the native token Luna. The new chain would have 1 billion Luna Tokens and would be airdropped across Luna and Classic stakers, Luna Classic holders, residual UST holders and essential app developers of Terra Classic. The proposal was put out for an on chain vote on Wednesday. As of press time Thursday afternoon. It seems it is going to pass, as it has the support of TerraForm Labs and Terra Builders Alliance, a community of builders within the Terra ecosystem. However, SIM Validators are not fans.
00:28:43.438 - 00:29:26.180, Speaker B: Allnode CEO Constantin Boyko Romanovsky said to the bloc, the whole governance process of this proposal looks like a dictatorship model. It looks like the launch of the new chain is decided even before voting is finished. As for the $3 billion in bitcoin reserves, the Luna Foundation Guard, which was in charge of defending the UST peg with the bitcoin, finally sheds some light on what happened. According to an announcement on Twitter. When UST started, Deepgging LFG said it converted the 80,000 bitcoins, or $3.1 billion in its reserve to UST to defend the peg. After the massive selloff, it was left with a reserve of 313 bitcoin, or $8 million.
00:29:26.180 - 00:30:15.150, Speaker B: According to Elliptic, a blockchain analytics company, 52,000 bitcoins were moved into Gemini, and the remaining 28,000 were moved into finance. However, Tom Robinson, cofounder of Elliptic, said to CoinDesk that beyond that, we can't really see how it's been used. In other related Terra news, South Korean authorities are now investigating the Terra collapse. A specialized financial crimes unit called Grim Reaper will look into the methods TerraForm Labs used to attract investors. Juan has been charged with tax evasion and faces a penalty of ₩100 billion, or $78.5 million, for failing to pay corporate and income tax. The TerraForm Labs legal team resigned shortly after the crash, making these issues harder for Quan to navigate.
00:30:15.150 - 00:30:51.260, Speaker B: Tether releases its long awaited Attestation report on Thursday. Tether or USDT, the world's largest US. Dollar stablecoin, released its first Attestation report in six months after the UST chaos. This report was highly anticipated as investors have been cashing out of Stablecoins, with USDT supply dropping $7 billion in the past few days alone. Tether reported a reduction in its commercial paper holdings by 17% from December 2021 through March 2022 from $24.2 billion to $19.9 billion.
00:30:51.260 - 00:31:43.870, Speaker B: USDT has a market cap of $74 billion and is fully backed, according to the attestation made by accountancy firm MHA Cayman, which reported that USDT is backed by assets that amounted to at least $83 billion. This latest Attestation further highlights that Tether is fully backed and that the composition of its reserves is strong, conservative and liquid, said Paolo Arduino, the CTO of Tether, in a statement. As promised, it demonstrates a commit by the company to reduce its commercial paper investments. In other stablecoin news, Day, an algorithmic stablecoin from the DFI Protocol deuce Finance, lost its peg against the dollar this week. Day is now trading around $0.60, according to Coin market cap after hitting a low of 51.7 cents on Monday.
00:31:43.870 - 00:32:26.410, Speaker B: Chinese bitcoin miners are back. According to new data from the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance, or CCAF. China has reclaimed its place as a bitcoin mining world leader, even after a ban that prohibited crypto trading and mining in China last year. The Asian country is now the second largest producer of hashrate. The data was disclosed in the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index, or Cbeci, whose goal is to map mining activity around the world. Based on the geolocational data reported by Mining Pools in December 2021, China accounted for 21.1% of the global hash rate, with that figure dropping to 0% after the ban, as was shown by previous data from Cambridge.
00:32:26.410 - 00:33:25.450, Speaker B: Web Three Wallets had a big week Robinhood, one of the biggest stock trading platforms in the US, said it plans to develop a new noncustodial mobile wallet for Web Three. According to the company's blog, customers will be able to hold the keys for their own crypto and access DApps to trade and swap crypto with no network fees, store NFTs and connect to NFT Marketplaces, earn yield using their assets, and access a variety of crypto assets. Robinhood's wallet will begin testing this summer and has a waitlist for early access. The company intends to have the product available for all its customers by the end of this year. Coinbase also announced the release of a Web Three wallet. Selected customers will have the ability to access Web Three decentralized applications directly from the Coinbase app. Users will be able to buy and hold NFTs, trade on DEXes, and even use some of the major DFI platforms like Compound and Curve to borrow, lend and swap tokens.
00:33:25.450 - 00:34:10.010, Speaker B: Notably, Coinbase users will be able to explore decentralized applications without having to manage a recovery phrase. Multiparty computation technology allows this innovative experience and enables users to have a dedicated on chain wallet that Coinbase helps keep secured. Crypto adoption ramps up Cloudflare announced plans to run and fully stake Ethereum validator nodes, making it the first publicly traded company to make such a move. According to Evan Van Ness. Over the next few months, Cloudflare will launch and fully stake Ethereum validator nodes on the Cloudflare global network. As the community approaches its transition. From proof of work to proof of stake with the merge, the company said in its announcement.
00:34:10.010 - 00:34:54.950, Speaker B: It added, this is just the start of our commitment to help the next generation of Web Three networks. Additionally, Spotify will start testing NFTs on its platform. According to a report by music Ally. Spotify will test NFTs with select users based in the US. And NFTs will appear under the artist's songs and albums, but users will need to go to an external marketplace to make their purchase. Here's another reminder not your keys, not your coins. In light of Coinbase's announcement that the exchange would retain user assets in the event of a bankruptcy, officials from Joe Biden's administration are pressing Congress to demand cryptocurrency exchanges keep their customers'money separate from corporate funds.
00:34:54.950 - 00:35:42.438, Speaker B: Don't think you actually own your tokens when you go into a digital wallet, said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. However, Gus Koldebella, partner at Trueventures, tweeted that the Biden administration's logic gets a lot wrong. Koldebella thinks the problem is how bankruptcy law treats exchange wallets. For this reason, a legitimate fix that forces cryptocurrency exchanges to keep their customers'money separate from their own corporate funds is no fix at all. It's not the source of the problem, and it doesn't solve the legal issue, he wrote. On a related note, SEC Chair Gary Gensler testified before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government this week and asked for a bigger budget to control the crypto space. Two other regulation adjacent stories caught my attention.
00:35:42.438 - 00:36:44.320, Speaker B: Reuters reported that finance ministers from G Seven countries are calling for more crypto legislation in light of the recent turmoil in the crypto asset market. The G Seven urges the FSB, or Financial Stability Board, to advance the swift development and implementation of consistent and comprehensive regulation, the ministers wrote in the draft document. TRM Labs, a blockchain analytics company, launched a platform for users to report crypto scams and other illicit activity. TRM is currently using raw data from the blockchain to create insights to investigate crypto frauds and financial crimes.

Testing, testing Ethereum merge's biggest test is set for June Ethereum's Main public testnet Robsden is set to go through the merge in June. Merging Robsden is a huge testing milestone toward Ethereum's Main net merge, which is projected to happen in a few months.
00:36:44.320 - 00:37:17.842, Speaker B: The merge is the most anticipated event of the year in the Ethereum ecosystem. At that time, the Ethereum Mainnet will transition from the proof of work consensus mechanism to proof of stake. Even though there is no exact data date set for the merge, Ethereum Core developer Preston Van Loon hinted on Twitter that it would happen sometime this year. Time for fun. Hmm. Nobody has any luna. Apparently, the only ones that lost millions of dollars in the Terra Luna fiasco were retail investors.
00:37:17.842 - 00:37:58.470, Speaker B: According to some tweets and press releases. Major VC firms and investment funds have confirmed that they had no or very little exposure to Luna. Among these companies are Pantera Capital, Galaxy Digital, Multicoin, Dragonfly Framework and Anjuno, which disclosure is a sponsor of my shows. On Wednesday, after saying nothing for more than ten days, galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz broke his silence. He said Galaxy has no exposure to algorithmic stablecoins. This is coming from a man who has a tattoo of the Luna token on his arm. He said my tattoo will be a constant reminder that venture investing requires humility.
00:37:58.470 - 00:38:40.126, Speaker B: On the latest episode of The Chopping Block Dragonfly's, Haseeb Qureshi said he wasn't inclined to believe all these stories. Everyone I talked to says they are okay. Somebody must be lying, he said, laughing in agreement with Haseeb, kevin Zhou, the Chopping Block guest, added, there is no way that's true. But what would be even more harrowing is that if it was true, it would mean that the insiders dubbed on retail and got out unscratched. Eventually, a few companies admitted to having exposure to Luna. Delphi Digital said on Thursday it has a large unrealized loss, and Hashed Wallet, a venture fund, sold $3.5 billion, according to Onchain Data.
00:38:40.126 - 00:38:55.570, Speaker B: Thanks so much for joining us today. To learn more about Tasha Stablecoins and the Terra Luna follow out, check out the show notes for this episode.
