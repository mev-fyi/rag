00:01:54.478 - 00:01:56.658, Speaker C: Hey Laura, thanks very much for having me.
00:01:56.824 - 00:01:59.890, Speaker A: Let's start with a basic question what is Synthetix?
00:02:00.630 - 00:02:19.430, Speaker C: Synthetix is essentially a synthetic asset issuance platform on Ethereum. So we create tokens that track assets, track the price of assets in traditional finance and in crypto finance to allow people to have price exposure.
00:02:19.850 - 00:02:28.890, Speaker A: And so we're going to talk a little bit more about what all that means. But first, let's talk a little bit about your background. How did you come to found Synthetics?
00:02:29.310 - 00:03:26.974, Speaker C: So I was actually running a payment startup back in 2014 2015, and we worked with a lot of the crypto exchanges in Australia. And as it kind of got closer to the bull market in 2016 2017, like a lot of markets like Korea, we saw that there was a pretty big spike in the spread between crypto prices in Australia and other markets like the US and Europe. And so we had this idea that if we were able to build a stablecoin, we would be able to kind of arbitrage those price spreads and more efficiently move money around. And so we started doing some research. This is before Maker obviously launched and really the only option out there was Tether. And so, yeah, we essentially decided to launch this new protocol to enable people to transfer value in a stable token. That was kind of how the project started, which was called Haven back then.
00:03:27.172 - 00:03:29.870, Speaker A: And how did you make the transition to synthetics?
00:03:30.610 - 00:04:34.050, Speaker C: So one of the, I guess, ideas that I had when we launched this was that regulated stablecoins were not going to be very likely or at least were going to take a long time to launch. And that turned out to not be very accurate. In 2018, you had Paxos and true USD and USDC and a lot of the regulated stablecoins that launched. And that just meant that the kind of market for a decentralized stablecoin was much smaller than it had been. And so we looked at the model and we said, okay, what can we do with our model to kind of create some differentiation? And one of the things that we saw was this ability to reprice debt and move between different synthetic assets. So we had a synthetic US dollar token, but we were able to launch a synthetic gold token, synthetic silver token, and people were able to move between those tokens with zero slippage, which was kind of the advantage. And so at that point, we decided to focus on synthetics exchange and that ability to trade synthetic assets.
00:04:34.630 - 00:04:50.490, Speaker A: Yeah, and I think what's remarkable is that you've gained quite a bit of traction in a short amount of time. So let's talk a little bit more about kind of like what that journey was after you started creating some of these. How did you become one of the biggest projects in DeFi?
00:04:52.030 - 00:05:49.606, Speaker C: Kind of gradually and then old ones, I guess we have the second most value locked. And the way that that kind of evolved, I guess, is as we launched more synthetic assets like synthetic bitcoin, synthetic gold, synthetic silver, the awareness and interest in the project grew really rapidly. But in addition to, I guess, pivoting towards synthetics, we also made a decision to change the monetary policy of the protocol. So previously, like most, ERC, 20 tokens that launched in 2017 and 2018, we had a fixed, fixed supply of 100 million. And we decided that we weren't really seeing high staking rates. We weren't getting people participating in the protocol and kind of doing what we needed them to do. And so we changed the monetary policy and essentially started paying inflation to the people who were staking, who were actively participating in the network.
00:05:49.606 - 00:06:04.400, Speaker C: And that immediately had a very powerful kind of feedback loop that I created where people got more excited, they started to understand the project more and dive in, and the growth kind of accelerated from there.
00:06:05.170 - 00:06:11.730, Speaker A: Great. So, yeah, let's talk a little bit more about what people are doing on the platform. What are some of the most popular synths?
00:06:12.390 - 00:07:03.790, Speaker C: So we actually just launched a bunch of new synths this week, including a DeFi index token. And so this DeFi index token is essentially like a basket of tokens in the DeFi space. So there's maker, there are obviously link SNX is in there, we've got zerox, et cetera. So what you can essentially do is hold this token and get exposure to kind of the entire DeFi space, or at least all the tokenized projects within DeFi. And so that's, I think, a pretty novel and interesting asset that doesn't really exist anywhere else. But in addition to that, we've got things like synthetic bitcoin, synthetic ether, where a lot of the volume happens. But we're starting to see definitely demand grow for things like synthetic maker and some of the inverse tokens.
00:07:03.790 - 00:07:16.520, Speaker C: So during the transition to multiclateral dai, over the last few weeks, the demand for synthetic maker and inverse maker has really increased. And there's a lot of organic volume happening there, which is kind of good to see.
00:07:17.050 - 00:07:34.160, Speaker A: This is super interesting. Yeah, there's so much to unpack, I guess. Why don't we just start with the DeFi token first in a way? I guess it's like an index. How do you decide what the weightings and stuff should be?
00:07:34.610 - 00:08:23.630, Speaker C: Yeah, so we wanted it to be kind of representative of the space, and obviously we can only track the things that have tokens, so we can't track something like compound right now, for example. But we took the weightings by market cap and then tried to kind of normalize it. It was actually one of our discord participants, one of the synthetics members who kind of normalized the weightings and proposed it, arthur Zero X, who I'm sure a lot of people follow on Twitter as well. And the community then voted and reviewed that weighting and they were happy with it. We also did some polls to work out what people wanted to include in the index. So it was kind of an open governance mechanism to determine the weighting and constituents of the basket.
00:08:24.370 - 00:08:31.470, Speaker A: And then for a synth like the bitcoin synth, why is it that they wouldn't just buy bitcoin?
00:08:31.890 - 00:09:20.720, Speaker C: Yeah, it's a really good question. I think the advantage that we have with something like synthetic bitcoin is if you want to just hold bitcoin and you're a long term holder, it makes sense to just go and buy bitcoin on the spot market. But like most derivatives, the advantage is in kind of access, right? So if you're holding bitcoin and you've got it in your own wallet going from Bitcoin into ETH or into USD or something like that, there's friction there. Whereas if all you want is the price exposure and you're not necessarily a long term holder, your ability to go from bitcoin into, say, gold and then back into US dollars within synthetics exchange with zero slippage is quite powerful. And so that's why I think we're seeing a lot of people who want that price exposure but also want the flexibility of being able to move out into a different asset fairly quickly.
00:09:22.050 - 00:09:32.290, Speaker A: But is there anything that they're doing with the bitcoin in the synth bitcoin that they couldn't do with BTC as well, aside just from being able to trade in and out of it without slippage.
00:09:32.950 - 00:09:58.780, Speaker C: No, that's basically it. It's just people looking for price exposure. So think about it as kind of the difference between gold futures versus the gold spot market. People who don't necessarily want physical delivery of gold, they just want price exposure to gold. This is sort of a similar mechanism. You just get the price exposure to bitcoin, but without having custody of the asset or a right to the asset or anything like that.
00:09:59.390 - 00:10:36.818, Speaker A: And then I was also wondering about some of these synths that are similar to stablecoins, like the so I don't know if this would technically be called a stablecoin, but I did happen to see that the amount of value in it is ahead of, for instance, Gemini USD, which is an actual stablecoin. But then since the synthetic USD is backed by SNX, is that essentially just like a riskier version of a stablecoin? And so it has kind of like different properties from a stable coin or how would you compare this to a regular stablecoin?
00:10:36.994 - 00:11:12.146, Speaker C: So I think in 2017, 2018, we kind of saw three different types of stablecoins emerge. There was the Fiat backed put money in a bank. It's a right to kind of convert that token into the fiat style stablecoin so that's your Paxos and Gemini and true USD, et cetera, and Tether ostensibly. And then we had Crypto collateral backed. So obviously Maker and Dai is the kind of biggest example of that. So using Ether as collateral to issue a stable USD asset. And that's really what SUSD is.
00:11:12.146 - 00:11:29.690, Speaker C: It's the same kind of principle. It's just using SNX as collateral instead of ETH. And then there's the third category, which is like the algorithmic stable coins. So things like Basis, which obviously, unfortunately didn't launch. So we didn't really get a chance to kind of see how that would play out. But I think there's a few more algorithmic stablecoins that have launched recently.
00:11:30.110 - 00:11:33.210, Speaker A: And what are people doing with the synth USD?
00:11:33.870 - 00:12:14.150, Speaker C: Well, so one of the nice things, again about the sort of synth ecosystem, I guess, is that you can take that synthetic asset and convert it easily into a different asset. So you can go from SUSD into gold. And so I guess that's kind of a bit of a different property to say something like a Gemini or a Tether where you need to find a counterparty to trade with in order to convert it into bitcoin or some other asset. So it's sort of one of the interesting properties of synthetics is that once you've got any of this debt, whether it's USD or gold or bitcoin, you have the right to reprice that debt into any other asset.
00:12:14.810 - 00:12:26.140, Speaker A: And we talked earlier a little bit about how the DeFi synth was formed. But where does the idea for any particular synth come from?
00:12:27.070 - 00:12:52.690, Speaker C: Typically it comes from our community. So we've got a lot of traders in our community and a lot of people who are very into crypto and crypto trading and that sort of thing. So we look at what the demand is from the community. So things like S Link, which we launched recently, SXRP were kind of coming from the demand that the community was displaying in Discord and other places.
00:12:53.350 - 00:12:57.350, Speaker A: And I heard that you're also coming out with decentralized futures.
00:12:58.170 - 00:13:17.820, Speaker C: We are, yeah. That's something that we're working on. So essentially it'll be a decentralized BitMEX or derabit or any futures exchange. You'll be able to take a leverage position on something like Bitcoin or ETH and open that position, and it'll be a perpetual future.
00:13:18.910 - 00:13:31.120, Speaker A: So let's walk through how this works. So let's say I'm a user. I come to your platform and I want to create some kind of synth for myself. What do I need to do?
00:13:31.570 - 00:13:43.570, Speaker C: So if you want to create a synth, you can't actually create a new synth. If you are just arriving in the platform, you can only choose from the existing synths.
00:13:43.990 - 00:13:45.998, Speaker A: I guess I meant mint. Mint a synth.
00:13:46.014 - 00:14:15.146, Speaker C: Oh, got you. Okay. Is that right? That's right. Yeah. If you want to mint a synth, then you need SNX and you essentially will turn up at Minter, which is our DAP that we use for Minting, and kind of maintaining your position. And you'll lock SNX and against that value of that collateral, you'll mint a synthetic asset. So within Minter, you can only mint SUSD, but with the contracts, you can mint any of the synthetic assets.
00:14:15.146 - 00:14:27.540, Speaker C: So you could mint synthetic bitcoin, for example. And again, it's very similar to like a maker vault or a Maker CDP, where you lock ETH and then you get issued this debt, which is a synthetic asset priced in US dollars.
00:14:28.150 - 00:14:39.094, Speaker A: Oh, wait, okay, so sorry, let me walk through this again. So I show up at Minter and then I have to give it ETH in order to get SNX. Is that it?
00:14:39.292 - 00:14:55.420, Speaker C: Sorry. Yeah. So if you don't have SNX, you need to get SNX from somewhere. So you would either buy the SNX for ETH or for something else. But once you've got SNX, you can lock that SNX and issue synthetic USD against it.
00:14:55.950 - 00:15:05.418, Speaker A: Okay, so I go to Minter with my SNX and then I turn that into SUSD, and then from there I can move into any other synth.
00:15:05.594 - 00:15:06.174, Speaker C: That's right.
00:15:06.212 - 00:15:06.686, Speaker A: Is that it?
00:15:06.708 - 00:15:08.190, Speaker C: That's right. Yes, that's it.
00:15:08.260 - 00:15:16.900, Speaker A: So in order to create the SNX, though, people need to over collateralize, and I think it's by like, roughly 700%. Why is it so high?
00:15:17.590 - 00:15:35.506, Speaker C: Because the liquidity of SNX is still quite low. So the idea is that eventually as SNX accrues value and as liquidity grows, we'll be able to lower that collateralization ratio. But it's sort of a reflection of the risk profile of SNX versus, say, ETH right now as collateral.
00:15:35.698 - 00:15:40.310, Speaker A: Oh, okay. Well, do you have any plans to add any other types of collateral?
00:15:40.730 - 00:15:49.660, Speaker C: We do, actually. We're working on a proposal to add ETH as a form of collateral to the network, which hopefully will go live later this year or early next year.
00:15:50.110 - 00:16:09.810, Speaker A: Okay. So earlier you talked about how one of the ways that you got traction on the platform was to change the monetary supply and I guess give some of the rewards to people who were staking. So will that still be the same if they're staking ETH rather than SNX?
00:16:10.470 - 00:16:49.146, Speaker C: No, it won't. It's a slightly different approach. So the people who stake SNX will get the full rewards from trading and the inflation so the trading fees on the exchange as well as the inflationary supply, people who lock ETH just have a right to come and trade synthetic assets. So once ETH collateral goes live, you'd be able to turn up with ETH. You wouldn't need to have SNX. You'd be able to mint synthetic ETH against that ETH and then start trading on synthetics exchange immediately. And the advantage, I guess, to someone who's holding ETH is that it doesn't force them to convert their ETH into SNX or into one of the synths.
00:16:49.146 - 00:16:55.700, Speaker C: They can still hold their ETH and trade without kind of taking the risk of selling down their ETH position.
00:16:56.390 - 00:17:14.920, Speaker A: Oh, I see. Okay. So this is sort of like how currently amongst people who have created SNX, only about 80% of them, I think well, actually, tell me if I understood this correctly. I think about 80% of them are staking it. Is that right?
00:17:15.530 - 00:17:21.820, Speaker C: About 80% of the supply is staked? The total token supply, yeah.
00:17:22.190 - 00:17:26.220, Speaker A: Okay, and then so the remaining are doing what? Trading it?
00:17:27.150 - 00:17:46.450, Speaker C: Yeah, some of them are just sitting on it and not staking. Some of them have it sitting in exchanges. Some is probably lost and unstakeable, which something happens in crypto networks. So there's any number of reasons that someone might decide not to stake rather than to participate in the network.
00:17:47.270 - 00:18:07.622, Speaker A: Okay, so essentially, when you start adding ETH as a collateral, or when you add it as a collateral type, then what is likely to happen is that the current stakers will still basically have a similar incentive, but they might earn more in fees because there might be more trading activity, something like that.
00:18:07.676 - 00:18:12.140, Speaker C: That's exactly right. Yeah, that's it. It's just an easier way to get people to trade more.
00:18:12.670 - 00:18:30.800, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah. I was just wondering because as you know actually, this is an interesting question. So let's see here. In so many other systems, staking is correlated with security. Is that really the function that it's providing here?
00:18:31.890 - 00:19:04.250, Speaker C: It's slightly different. So you're securing the pool of assets, I guess, or the pool of debt by putting your collateral there, and you're taking a risk. So when you lock SNX, you take the risk of the total value of the debt pool that's out there. So you're providing that service to someone to allow them to turn up and reprice their debt. So you're securing the debt pool essentially. But obviously we rely on the ethereum network for the actual security of the tokens themselves and consensus, et cetera.
00:19:04.750 - 00:19:27.938, Speaker A: Okay, so this is like a slightly weird question, but we were talking about this really high collateralization ratio and how SNX isn't very liquid. Is there any possibility of some kind of like black swan event or something where people somehow suddenly cannot actually pay back their you know, that's one of.
00:19:27.944 - 00:20:25.060, Speaker C: The big risks that you take as someone who's minting. So if something happened to the debt pool such that the debt pool increased by an order of magnitude, then there would be more debt outstanding than the collateral value of SNX, which would create some kind of a downward spiral potentially. Now there's mechanisms that are in place to kind of prevent that from happening, but it's definitely possible. And in fact, back in July we had an issue with the price feeds with our Oracle, which created just that scenario. So there was a bot that was trading on the exchange and the price feed for the Korean one failed and the bot was able to essentially create about $2 billion worth of debt, which obviously was significantly higher than the market cap of the SNX collateral. So that was something that was kind of indicative of one of the risks that exists in the system.
00:20:25.850 - 00:20:50.314, Speaker A: Right? So I was going to ask you about this. When it's creating $2 billion worth of debt, that basically means that then if that bot or whatever wanted to kind of like close out of the SNX system, then they would need to pay back $2 billion or so. Is that what that means? What does that mean?
00:20:50.512 - 00:21:23.026, Speaker C: So what it means is that the bot has $2 billion worth of debt outstanding. But there's only at that time I think there was about $30 million worth of collateral. So the bot would basically never be able to cash out that position. There's not enough collateral value. It would be like if there was a million dollars worth of ETH locked up to issue Dai and then all of a sudden the Dai supply was inflated to a billion dollars. There's only a million dollars worth of ETH there. So the first million can be claimed, but then after that there's no value there to be claimed.
00:21:23.026 - 00:21:29.190, Speaker C: So essentially the system was insolvent and the bot was unable to close out that position and get the profit.
00:21:29.850 - 00:21:58.420, Speaker A: Okay, so we're actually going to talk a little bit more about what happened there in a little bit, but I actually just wanted to talk a little bit more about this, the staking and the SNX and stuff. So I think some other thing that's a little bit interesting to me about how the staking works here. Is it's not similar to staking on other platforms where people can basically just earn passive returns? Am I right in thinking that?
00:21:59.270 - 00:22:19.690, Speaker C: Yeah. So typically with Staking, you have some level of responsibility. You're providing a service. There's things like Live Peer, where you're providing a service, running nodes. If you're staking an E 2.0, you're providing the security to the network. So typically there is some responsibility and some action you have to take.
00:22:19.690 - 00:22:26.490, Speaker C: And in our network, that action is that you're providing the collateral essentially for the network and securing the debt.
00:22:26.990 - 00:22:37.600, Speaker A: Okay. All right, so then we talked about how now you're going to add and when are you going to add ether as a collateral type.
00:22:38.050 - 00:22:45.490, Speaker C: We're working on at the moment. We're hoping to get it done by the end of the year, but it's looking like it might be early next year, the way things are tracking.
00:22:46.150 - 00:22:55.800, Speaker A: And for the monetary supply, you said that right now it's pretty high inflation, but that's going to go down. So what is the monetary policy?
00:22:56.810 - 00:23:43.614, Speaker C: Yeah, so it's actually an interesting question. So at the moment, we have an inflationary supply that halves every year. And that Halving event is coming up in March. But some people within the community have proposed a change to that inflation schedule to smooth it, essentially, which was something that I was personally against initially, but I've come around to the fact that I think it makes sense. So it's basically been passed. We've had a couple of governance calls where it's been discussed, and the community has kind of reached consensus that it's the right thing to do. There's a couple of minor things around the parameters for the terminal inflation that are still being discussed, but there'll be a vote on that hopefully in the next week or so, and then it'll be implemented.
00:23:43.614 - 00:23:55.430, Speaker C: So that's something that will probably change by the end of the year, and it will mean that the inflation goes from a million tokens that it started out to somewhere around 300 million tokens.
00:23:56.250 - 00:24:01.530, Speaker A: Okay. And is that just in perpetuity or is there ever going to be a cap that's reached?
00:24:01.870 - 00:24:32.450, Speaker C: So it looks like the consensus is to have perpetual 2% inflation, approximately. It might be a little bit higher, a little bit lower. And the intent behind that is to ensure that we've got some additional supply of SNX to fund the incentives that are outside of the system. So we've got some incentives at the moment around uniswap to incentivize liquidity there. So we want to make sure that we continue to have that SNX supply to be able to incentivize those external things outside of the protocol.
00:24:33.270 - 00:24:42.390, Speaker A: All right, so in a moment we're going to discuss Oracle's and we're going to talk more about that bot that could have made the system insolvent. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible.
00:24:42.540 - 00:25:33.074, Speaker B: Will the world follow France and advocate banning privacy coins. Will government backed stablecoins become the new fiat are distributed and peer to peer exchanges just a flash in the pan? The answer is maybe. Virtual currencies can flourish and create a new, private and more versatile economy. But that grand vision can't happen without keeping crypto clean, and that requires support of governments and accountability for bad actors.

Join the over 1 million others and download the Crypto.com app. Today, back to my conversation with Kane Warwick of Synthetics. So, as we touched on briefly earlier, the integrity of the system is highly dependent on the quality of the Oracle. And as you mentioned, there was this incident with the trader, and I believe the way that their bot was able to take advantage of the system was something to do with the Oracle. So can you tell us exactly how they were able to make that hack?
00:27:34.850 - 00:28:25.290, Speaker C: Yeah, so they were looking at the price feeds that were being published on chain and they were reading the Mempool. So they're reading all of the transactions that are sitting, waiting to be confirmed by miners. And they took those feeds and they were able to essentially front run the pricing changes so they would detect that a price change was going to happen and they would move into that asset and then as soon as the price was updated, they would leave the asset. And we had some measures to prevent that, speed bumps and things like that that we're working on. But the bot was fairly sophisticated and was pretty good at detecting when a large spike was going to happen. And it was fairly profitable. It was making around 10% a day or something like that with its trading.
00:28:25.290 - 00:29:12.110, Speaker C: But then we had an issue where there was this cascading failure of our Oracle for the forex APIs. So we have a number of APIs that are medianized and several of them failed in different ways simultaneously, which we didn't have a good mechanism to prevent or to alert us to. And the bot was running and essentially detected this anomaly in the KRW price and was able to trade, I think it was five times back and forth between ETH and KRW and it was able to generate about $2 billion worth of synthetic ETH at the time. So that essentially made the system insolvent and we then had to work out a way to kind of roll back that trade.
00:29:12.610 - 00:29:30.420, Speaker A: Wow. So let's just give a little bit of context on how it is that the Oracle prices get pushed. As far as I understand right now, it's synthetics, or at least back then it was synthetics pushing the price. Is that correct? And if so, how are you determining the price?
00:29:32.230 - 00:30:14.240, Speaker C: We had some commercial APIs that were essentially being pulled into a system and then the aggregates were taken out, lives were thrown out. Well, these were forex APIs, so they were coming from commercial forex providers. So there's a ton of them around and we picked what we thought were four or five pretty good ones. Unfortunately, the forex APIs are less robust than the crypto APIs from our experience, which was kind of surprising to us. So we had a lot more protection around the crypto APIs because we were worried that they were going to be a bit flakier. But it was actually the forex ones that created the issue.
00:30:15.490 - 00:31:04.740, Speaker A: Okay, one other thing that I wanted to ask here was like later on, this same trader then wrote this reddit post and this was like a few months later actually, and this person complained that you had jacked up their fees, deleted their balance and forced them to trade their synth for SUSD. This doesn't appear to be sort of the same incident. It's kind of like, well, let me recap and you can correct anything that isn't correct here, but essentially after the first incident you had kind of said, okay, we're going to pay you this bounty fee and now anything that you do is basically going to help us make our platform better, or something like that. Or actually, why don't you just sort of describe what happened?
00:31:05.590 - 00:32:03.522, Speaker C: Yeah, so it was, as you can imagine, somewhat of an adversarial conversation. It was a bit of a hostage negotiation because the trader was well aware of the fact that the system was insolvent. And if they didn't cooperate with us, we would have had to fork the system or there would have been a significantly larger impact. So getting them to roll back the trade was definitely the best solution and initially they wanted a pretty exorbitant amount of money to do that and we were able to negotiate them down to something a bit more reasonable. We ended up paying them about $40,000 worth of ETH to cooperate and roll back the trades. But this trader was pretty, as I said, pretty adversarial and pretty aggressive and arrogant about what they were doing and their ability to kind of front run the system and our inability to stop them. And so we basically said, look, you can keep attacking the system.
00:32:03.522 - 00:32:48.450, Speaker C: We're working on a number of mechanisms to kind of prevent that. And this is crypto, it's adversarial, right? We're going to try and fight back and work out whatever we can do to kind of make this less profitable. And unfortunately the kind of calculus that I guess we came to was that if you don't have any punishment, if there's no downside to someone who's attacking the system, the optimal strategy is just to keep attacking. If the worst that you can do is not profit, then this is only going to escalate. And so we basically worked out that we would need to have some kind of slashing condition implemented in order to reduce the profitability of these bots. And so we implemented that. It worked.
00:32:48.450 - 00:33:16.940, Speaker C: We're able to slash this trader. And then they came back and said, well, I'm going to continue to attack the system. They did and it was kind of this running battle. This has kind of kept going on with different traders and different bots probably for like the last six months. It's been a big amount of effort that we've kind of had to implement a number of different pieces of functionality to prevent this front running, which is kind of a constant arm service, I guess.
00:33:17.310 - 00:33:47.560, Speaker A: Wow, okay. I bet it's making your platform better very fast. One thing that I was wondering about though is what exactly are they exploiting? So I understand that it's this knowledge of a trade that's about to happen and kind of what the Oracle price is, but is part of that also because maybe just like the frequency with which you can update the prices is a bit slower than you would like.
00:33:48.170 - 00:34:21.646, Speaker C: Yeah, that's exactly right. It's just latency. So they're observing what's happening in the real world and we're observing it. We publish something to say this is what's happened in the real world and they're able to essentially publish it on chain faster than us. That's their intent. That's what they're trying to do. We've gotten to a point now where we've basically been able to reduce the front running to, or at least reduce the profitability of front running to maybe half a percent a day or 1% a day, which is kind of I guess within our risk tolerance from where we're sitting now.
00:34:21.646 - 00:34:42.054, Speaker C: But again, as I said, this is an armstrace and every time we make a change, the bots update and they try and attack the system and improve their bots. So it's definitely improving the system and it's making it much more robust. But it's certainly been a lot of effort and a lot of engineering time to kind of work on these issues over the last six months.
00:34:42.252 - 00:34:50.540, Speaker A: And how do you make the improvements anyway if as you mentioned in the original incident, the APIs that failed weren't even in your control.
00:34:51.310 - 00:35:45.370, Speaker C: So what we've basically been doing is upgrading the Oracle and we're working on moving the Oracle away. Synthetic still runs the Oracle, but hopefully by the end of the year we'll start migrating away from our own centralized Oracle to chainlink. And we've been working with the Chainlink team to build a set of Oracles that will be much harder to front run and put some mechanisms in place to prevent people from trading to cover some of the edge cases that they've been using if they are trying to front run the system. But as I said, it's kind of a balance between usability because some of these things impact the usability for regular traders. So we have to kind of try and find a balance where you're never really going to get rid of front running completely, but you can reduce it to the point where it's less profitable or not so impactful.
00:35:45.870 - 00:35:54.000, Speaker A: So I don't know a ton about Chainlink, but can you describe how that system will differ once it's integrated than what you have now?
00:35:54.450 - 00:36:47.600, Speaker C: So essentially they're just doing what we were doing ourselves, but they've got a distributed group of people that are consuming these external APIs, so crypto, APIs, et cetera. And a lot of them are data providers that already have the data. So they've got access to that data themselves and they take these different node operators who are kind of aggregating this data and then medianize it and publish it on chain. And so what you've essentially got is our Oracle times seven or 20 or 30 depending on the asset that the price is being published for, which just makes it so much more robust than what we're using right now. So we're pretty confident that once we get that in place, we won't have any future issues with Oracle outages. But it doesn't necessarily solve the front running problem. We still have some edge cases that we need to handle there.
00:36:48.130 - 00:36:53.410, Speaker A: And will that increase the frequency by which you can update the Oracles?
00:36:54.150 - 00:37:36.126, Speaker C: It actually won't. There's kind of a fundamental latency that you have with Ethereum. So something that we're also looking at is a layer two solutions that will allow us to publish prices much more rapidly. So right now the only way we can prevent people from exploiting that latency is by forcing them, which is what some centralized exchanges do. They put a speed bump in to prevent people from being able to high frequency traders being able to publish things before everyone else can. And so we're putting these speed bumps in to ensure that someone can't look at the transaction being broadcast and try and front run it. They're going to definitely be slower than it.
00:37:36.126 - 00:37:47.330, Speaker C: But as I said, there's a trade off between that and usability of the platform because if the speed bump is too aggressive, then it makes it harder for regular traders to trade.
00:37:47.990 - 00:38:02.920, Speaker A: I saw in a blog post that you wrote that once Chainlink is integrated, that will allow anyone to build and run an Oracle to obtain price feeds for synths. So what does that look like exactly? And how would you expect that would change the platform?
00:38:03.930 - 00:38:54.390, Speaker C: I think it changes the platform because it moves away from this centralized control that the team has. Now our core team has. So once we get to a point where there are these external Oracle providers, anyone in the community can essentially request a price feed. So palladium, weirdly enough, people ask for pretty regularly so the community can say, we're putting a proposal to add palladium token. And then provided these node operators who are running Chainlink nodes can source a price for palladium and kind of credibly produce it, we can add that synth and it doesn't require necessarily intervention from the team directly to provide that price feed. So that's obviously going to be beneficial when we look at things like synthetic equities, so, S Apple, S Tesla, et cetera.
00:38:55.210 - 00:39:04.860, Speaker A: Interesting, the palladium thing threw me a little bit. I feel like this is one of those moments where you're in crypto and then you're like, oh, there's yet another rabbit hole I could go down.
00:39:05.550 - 00:39:13.280, Speaker C: Yeah, there's people who are deep into play game for some reason. Yeah, it is what it is, I guess.
00:39:13.970 - 00:39:53.430, Speaker A: Okay, so you also had a recent Tweet storm about moving the chainlink and you talked about how some people objected to it because it's not maximally decentralized. And then you wrote something that I found really interesting. You said, quote, we are very comfortable not using maximally decentralized Oracles because Chainlink is more than sufficient to move the Oracle attack vector to the bottom of our censorship vector stack, which means governance and other issues become the highest priority. So what did you mean when you said that Chainlink is more than sufficient to move the Oracle attack vector to the bottom of your censorship vector?
00:39:55.370 - 00:41:02.926, Speaker C: So essentially what I was saying is at the moment you could theoretically round up five or six people in the community and throw us in jail and shut the project down. Right? And again, I think about these things from a very adversarial perspective, right, that even though that's not likely right now, it's possible so long as something's possible. We want to eventually be able to prevent it from happening. And the main reason why you could get away with that and lock up five people and shut the project down is the Oracle. Once with the Oracle and once the price feeds are being published independently on chain and the protocol is just consuming those price feeds, then if you were to do that, if you were to round up those four or five people and lock them up. It would be very easy for the community, given that everything that we're doing, everything other than the Oracle is open source, to essentially fork the protocol or do a hard spoon and migrate, state and redeploy it on chain and keep the system going. And I think we're getting pretty close to that.
00:41:02.926 - 00:41:16.070, Speaker C: But the limiting factor right now is definitely The Oracle. So as soon as the Oracle is not us, and as soon as it's independent, it's going to be a huge qualitative state in terms of the censorship resistance of the protocol.
00:41:17.690 - 00:41:34.540, Speaker A: Super interesting. So something we referenced earlier that we didn't go into much was you talked about how somebody could sell like a million dollars worth of bitcoin or whatever amount and there would be zero slippage. So how is that possible?
00:41:35.550 - 00:42:15.890, Speaker C: So it's possible because someone is able to reprice the debt. So one of the rights that you have if you're holding debt, whether you minted it or whether you bought it from someone for ETH or bitcoin or whatever, you can turn up the contracts and you can say, I have ten synthetic bitcoin and I want to convert that into synthetic US. Dollars. And the system will quote you a rate based on the current spot price and what The Oracle is publishing for those two assets and then take a small fee. So 30 basis point fee, which goes into the fee pool. So that's just a right that you have within the system, which is obviously very beneficial. I think I brought up Maker earlier.
00:42:15.890 - 00:42:46.210, Speaker C: There was someone on Twitter, Andrew Kang, who actually did an analysis of the slippage on Uniswap for Maker versus synthetics. And I think the slippage was about 50% less for trading Maker on synthetics exchange. So during the kind of MCD transition, when Maker pumped up to like 650 or 700 and then dropped back down, a lot of people were trading Smaker and imaker because it was actually more efficient to trade on synthetics exchange than on the spot markets.
00:42:47.990 - 00:42:52.930, Speaker A: And why is it that it's more efficient on synthetics than on uniswap?
00:42:53.270 - 00:43:16.540, Speaker C: So Uniswap, because it uses automatic market making function has kind of this built in slippage. So the larger the order you trade, the more slippage you'll get. 1% slippage for like a $50,000 order, for example. Whereas with synthetics I think it was 35 basis points or something like that.
00:43:17.230 - 00:43:33.760, Speaker A: Okay, yeah. And also, I guess just to I mean, it's probably obvious to people, but why don't you just talk about how synthetics differs from other DEXs and then therefore how the trading behavior on synthetics differs from on other.
00:43:35.010 - 00:44:18.346, Speaker C: So, you know, typically other DEXes excluding uniswap. And so uniswap and synthetics are kind of in their own category of these peer to contract decentralized exchanges. But in a typical Dex like radar relay or something like that, that's using zero X protocol, you need to find a counterparty to match your order. So if you want to trade maker and you want to trade $50,000 with the maker, there needs to be someone on the other side who's willing to buy that. And in any market where you're matching counterparties, there's going to be slippage. And so that's something that is kind of exacerbated on DEXes. And it's one of the reasons why uniswap is so powerful because you don't need to wait for a counterparty to trade.
00:44:18.346 - 00:44:40.646, Speaker C: You just have to accept that there'll be some slippage. But you'll always get a quote. You'll never be in a situation where you can't sell the asset or trade the asset that you want to trade. It's just a question of are you willing to deal with the slippage. And synthetics exchange is kind of similar. You can always turn up so long as you've got debt and trade that amount of debt for a different asset and reprice it.
00:44:40.828 - 00:44:52.298, Speaker A: And I think I saw you were saying that the average trading size on synthetics is a lot higher than on other exchanges or at least on other DEXes. Is that right?
00:44:52.464 - 00:45:20.260, Speaker C: Yeah, that's right. Yeah, it's typically quite a bit higher because you just have people who want to trade, say, $20,000 or $30,000 that they couldn't trade on another decks. And obviously centralized exchanges, there's more liquidity because they're just much bigger markets. But as the synthetic asset pool grows, as the debt pool grows, it's possible that we could see orders of 5 million, $10 million, for example.
00:45:21.430 - 00:45:25.910, Speaker A: All right, so how are fees set on synthetics?
00:45:26.890 - 00:45:49.100, Speaker C: So at the moment, it's a flat 30 basis point fee, and then there's an additional fee if you're moving from a long token to a short token. And this is again one of the kind of trade offs that we built in to prevent front running. So if you go from Smaker, which is the long version, to Imaker, which is the short version, you pay 60 basis points.
00:45:49.790 - 00:45:52.240, Speaker A: And who decides what those fees are?
00:45:53.170 - 00:46:19.800, Speaker C: Well, the community side, we had the fees set at 50 basis points up until a few days ago and one of the community members put in a proposal to reduce it back to 30 basis points, which it kind of has been sitting at historically, and that passed pretty unanimously and so the fees were updated. So it's kind of, again, handled by our rough consensus within our discord channel and within the community.
00:46:20.570 - 00:46:33.402, Speaker A: And we have talked about uniswap a few different times, but as far as I understand, uniswap also has been kind of pivotal to the success of synthetics. How so?
00:46:33.536 - 00:47:31.374, Speaker C: There's very strong kind of symbiosis, I think, with Uniswap. When Uniswap was announced, it was very obvious to me that it was going to become quite powerful for DeFi protocols, and particularly for us, because we need liquid on ramps and off ramps and we need to know that those on ramps are always going to be there. We need people to be able to get into the debt pool and out of the debt pool in order to trade on synthetics exchange. And so what we did earlier this year was to incentivize people to put liquidity into the synthetic ETH pool. And so that's now grown to be the largest pool on Uniswap and does typically it's in one of the top exchanges in terms of volume on a daily basis as well. And so now you can move in and out of synthetics exchange via this Uniswap pool. And the slippage is pretty minimal for trades of like $10,000 or so, which is pretty good.
00:47:31.374 - 00:47:36.590, Speaker C: So the average trader trying to move in and out of synthetic exchange can go through Uniswap pretty comfortably.
00:47:37.570 - 00:48:17.340, Speaker A: And something that we talked about earlier was how you changed the monetary policy and how you started the project one way, but it ended up going in a different way, and how you had maybe one thought to do a synthetic stablecoin and then later you realized people wanted volatility. And I've also heard you talk about the importance of iterations. So just with all the different twists and turns that your project has taken, tell us kind of what the lessons for you have been and kind of what the different things are that happened that made you realize like, oh, it's better to go this way than that way.
00:48:18.270 - 00:49:04.074, Speaker C: I think startups just operate that way. There's a lot of opacity trying to run a startup and trying to kind of predict what's going to happen. It's almost impossible. And really you just need to kind of place small bets and respond to what the market says. We placed a very large bet, which you could argue was kind of dumb, that regulated stablecoins wouldn't be a thing. And then when all of a sudden they were, we realized that the market that we were attempting to address had kind of been pulled out from under us and you just need to respond to those sorts of things. So we looked at what we built and we're pretty comfortable that it was a very powerful protocol and would have a lot of value, but we just needed to find the right market for it.
00:49:04.074 - 00:49:37.000, Speaker C: And so we started issuing assets. And again, another kind of small bet that didn't really play out was this idea that if you had multiple fiat currencies, people would be happy to move in between those fiat currencies. And that turned out to really not be the case either. There's not a lot of demand for that. But what we did see demand for is trading these volatile assets and having access to a number of different crypto assets and fiat currencies and commodities and other assets on a single platform. That was where we really started to see product market fit and generate some real interest.
00:49:37.610 - 00:49:56.620, Speaker A: And what about that moment when you had this confrontation with the trader who had built the bot that had nearly major system insolvent at that moment? What do you feel like the lessons were for you and for other entrepreneurs in the space?
00:49:58.270 - 00:50:54.910, Speaker C: I've been running startups for a long time and most of them have failed as startups tend to do. And you always have these crisis moments. And I do think there is a point where after you've been through so many crises, you kind of become immune to them a little bit and you can kind of detach and not become emotionally invested in what's happening. And in that moment it was really just about, okay, how do I resolve this specific issue that's right in front of me and not really thinking through the implications and consequences. But it was almost 3 hours, I think that we were negotiating with him to kind of roll back the system. So it was pretty high stress environment. But again, I think having gone through similar issues in other startups where things blew up, you just have to kind of roll with it and treat the situation that's in front of you and deal with that directly.
00:50:55.890 - 00:51:22.280, Speaker A: So something also that's come up a few times in this show is you talked about how you made this decision to change your monetary policy. And I could just imagine that when you decided that you thought that that would be a good idea, that you might be nervous about presenting it to the community. So was there any community input on that? And if so, how did you factor that in?
00:51:23.210 - 00:52:19.590, Speaker C: Yeah, I actually had originally came up with the idea almost eight months before DevCon four. And so at DevCon, there were a number of people that were stakeholders in the project that I kind of pulled aside and said, hey, what do you think about this? And it was reasonably positive. There was definitely some skepticism around it and is this just kind of some Hail Mary to try and I guess get attention for the project or something like that. But I was able to kind of make the case. I think that the issue we had was we weren't properly incentivizing people to understand the protocol. And when you look at things like Bitcoin for example, and how Bitcoin generated its network effects, it was because it was paying people to understand it. The protocol itself paid people to learn how to install mining software and understand block rewards and all that stuff.
00:52:19.590 - 00:53:03.350, Speaker C: And I think if that didn't exist, it probably doesn't gain the traction that it did and so I looked at that and I said, we need something similar to incentivize people to care about this and to want to actually learn about it. And I think we were able to convince most of them. But even still, I was pretty surprised. I expected a lot of pushback from the community when we announced it, but interestingly, they were super positive about it and I think mainly because most of them already understood the network and we were essentially saying, we're going to pay you for understanding it and people who are not actively participating will be punished. And so it was much more positively received than I expected by a very wide margin.
00:53:03.930 - 00:53:43.010, Speaker A: Yeah. And this is kind of like a theme of the conversation where there's this tension because certain elements of what you're doing are centralized, at least at the moment. But then just even things like when I asked about the exchange fees and stuff, you said, oh, well, actually that was set by the people in the Discord and the DeFi index was decided by a community member. So what is going on with governance? Like, right now? I know you guys have a foundation, but at some point I think you'd like to move to a Dow. So what's your vision for how this will be governed?
00:53:43.510 - 00:54:36.760, Speaker C: Yeah, obviously we're quite a small team. I think people don't realize how small our team is and how hardworking the engineers and everyone in the team is to kind of keep the project going. But it's just impossible for seven or eight people to kind of anticipate everything that could happen. We can respond to things, but trying to kind of understand where we should go next just requires the insight of a much larger group of people. And so the community has kind of really stepped up and become pivotal in helping us to understand where we need to go next and see some of the issues. And oftentimes we don't necessarily immediately agree. The core team might kind of look at a proposal and say we don't think that's a great idea.
00:54:36.760 - 00:55:08.910, Speaker C: But the rough consensus model kind of allows for those debates and those discussions to kind of evolve over time. And most of the time we kind of reach consensus both internally within the team and within the community and are able to kind of move forward. But it's just not possible with a project as complex as this is to not have that outside input. And so we really try to foster it as much as possible and be as open as we can to kind of bringing in those outside views.
00:55:09.650 - 00:55:14.510, Speaker A: But then for the future, do you think that you might move to a Dow?
00:55:15.270 - 00:56:13.198, Speaker C: I think we might. It's something that we're looking at right now. In order for us to, I guess, stay ahead of the kind of potential regulatory issues that are coming up, we need to not be in control of the protocol. And so rough consensus is helpful in bringing in those external parties, but at some point we need to, I guess, relinquish control of the protocol upgradability. And so that's something that we're looking at that potentially could be managed by a Dow. But it's something that we obviously need to, I guess, understand a little bit better and work through what the implementation looks like as well as working with the community and letting them kind of, I guess, help us to understand what they want from that. Because if you move to on chain governance and you implement a Dow and the Dow Is kind of controlled by this Plutocracy, as we've seen in a couple of other projects, kind of emerge.
00:56:13.198 - 00:56:23.080, Speaker C: I think it has a really chilling effect on participation within the community. And so we're really wary of trying to thread that needle and kind of manage that, I guess.
00:56:24.010 - 00:56:42.140, Speaker A: And as mentioned earlier, you guys also did an ICO and I think you raised about 30 million, is that right? In 2018? Yeah, that's right. And I believe from a conversation that we had, you think it was maybe from about 70,000 wallets, is that right?
00:56:43.070 - 00:57:04.180, Speaker C: So there's about 70,000 wallets who hold our token, but a lot of that came from a very large AirDrop that we did. That was, I think, about 65,000 wallets. So there were about 5000 people who participated in the sale, in the open sale and then there were Bounties and Airdrops and things like that.
00:57:04.710 - 00:57:13.590, Speaker A: Okay, well, in addition to that, you also recently did a small VC raise. What was the purpose of that raise?
00:57:14.490 - 00:58:13.082, Speaker C: So we have a large treasury, obviously, that is mainly SNX tokens and it was really about bringing in, I guess, some new stakeholders and there had been a lot of interest in people participating in the protocol. And one of the challenges, I guess, of having not that much liquidity in the spot markets is that if someone wants to get two, three, four or 5 million tokens, they really can only get it from the foundation. And so as that demand grew and more people were interested, we started to kind of have some conversations and vet those people and we ended up going with Framework Ventures who've been amazing. They're participating in all aspects of the system. They've kind of helped to work on the inflationary change as well. So I think we picked the right team to kind of come in and help us. But we need, as I said, to bring in external stakeholders and people who can kind of help to push things forward.
00:58:13.082 - 00:58:22.110, Speaker C: So if we find the right people in the future, we'll probably look at selling tokens out of the treasury to them as well to get them into the ecosystem.
00:58:22.690 - 00:58:28.560, Speaker A: And there were also rumors about Andreessen Horowitz taking an interest. What was that about?
00:58:29.810 - 00:59:05.990, Speaker C: I mean, there's a wallet that is controlled by a 16 Z that has FX tokens in it. It didn't come from the foundation directly, but it looks like they do have a position in Synthetics if you look on chain. So I can't really provide much more information than that because that's kind of all I know. But there's a lot of people in our community who are very good with chain analysis and were able to kind of work out what was going on. It was on Twitter before I knew anything about it. So it was kind of an interesting incident.
00:59:06.070 - 00:59:28.050, Speaker A: I guess there are so many incidents like that in crypto. But anyway well, yes, like the whole space. In other interviews you've mentioned that you have confidence that decentralized finance will consume centralized finance eventually, but that right now there's a lot of challenges. What are the biggest challenges?
00:59:28.630 - 01:00:12.990, Speaker C: I think the main challenge is that we still haven't abstracted enough complexity away for the average user, and that kind of flows all the way through the stack. Right. So user interfaces and user experience is still pretty far behind centralized finance. I think the other issue is there's a lot of friction getting money in and out of the system, getting value into the system. So it's going to take at least a few years, I think, before we can kind of bring all of this kind of complexity much lower and just remove it and kind of provide, I guess, experiences for users and products for users without them needing to really understand what's happening in the background.
01:00:13.830 - 01:00:23.330, Speaker A: All right, well, we'll see how you and others resolve all these problems or all these challenges. Where can people learn more about you and Synthetics?
01:00:24.230 - 01:00:47.610, Speaker C: Best place is probably if you really want to dive in to jump into our discord channel. But you can go to Synthetics IO if you want to have a look at the system and get an overview. We also have a dashboard, which is dashboard synthetics IO, which gives an overview of the network, which is kind of cool. You can see all the different synths and what the open interest is, et cetera.
01:00:48.110 - 01:00:50.502, Speaker A: Great. Well, thanks for coming on Unchained.
