00:00:00.280 - 00:00:45.245, Speaker A: This is why I think also people misunderstand when they say these Bitcoin ETF options are not a big deal. And they'll say things like, oh, we've had derivatives all the time. We've had Ledger and we've had Deribit and we had cme. And I just tell them like, guys, those things are not what is on the backbone of this complex, this industrial complex of wealth management products and the way that it allows the biggest group of participants. And so I do think Bitcoin ETF options are separate. The same way Bitcoin ETFs. So many people doubted that this is a product market fit because, hey, why would you buy that if you just buy it on Coinbase? It turns out, well, people do need it for all kinds of reasons, whether it's cross asset collateralization, whether it's margining, whether it's to participate in stock lending.
00:00:45.245 - 00:00:57.925, Speaker A: And you can actually lend out your ETFs and not have to worry about counterparty risk. There are useful things that come out of this financial wrapper. And so I put Bitcoin ETF options in the exact same category. It's a zero to one kind of moment.
