00:01:07.378 - 00:01:15.566, Speaker A: Laura, the link is in the description. Today's guest is Robbie Ferguson, cofounder and president of Immutable. Welcome, Robbie.
00:01:15.678 - 00:01:17.478, Speaker B: Thanks, Laura. Good to be here.
00:01:17.644 - 00:01:30.460, Speaker A: Quick disclosure before we begin. Immutable was a previous sponsor of my show. Immutable recently launched the first phase of its layer two scaling protocol, immutable X. What problem are you trying to solve with Immutable X?
00:01:31.310 - 00:01:59.550, Speaker B: We're essentially trying to solve two problems. First is gas fees for NFTs on Ethereum, and second is the security of the scalability solution that solves that problem. So it's not just make trades free, otherwise we could have made a brand new blockchain or run things on a centralized database, which many people are doing it's. How do you actually create a scaling solution that natively uses the network effects and the security of Ethereum, and we're the first people to do that, so we're very excited.
00:01:59.710 - 00:02:22.166, Speaker A: So despite these issues, which I did experience when I tried to buy my Kings of Leon NFT, which it only cost me $60, but then the gas fees were $90. So despite all this, we've actually still seen NFTs take off in the last several months. And I wondered if you thought this was especially a problem for gaming in a way that it's not for other kinds of NFTs.
00:02:22.358 - 00:03:09.722, Speaker B: Absolutely, I mean, you're putting the words in my mouth. So I think the reason we've seen NFTs take off so far, it's mainly been in the digital art category. And that category are very high value assets with low trade volume, where the gas fees probably don't matter as much. If you're trading a $69 million B pool, you probably don't care about paying a $60 gas fee, but you do care about the security of the blockchain your asset lives on. Which is why it's really, really essential. This scalability infrastructure for NFTs is built on Ethereum and not a side chain or not a competing blockchain like flow. So that's kind of our thesis, but absolutely what we think Immutable X is built for is the scale of if a major gaming company wants to move into NFTs they can do so via Immutable X.
00:03:09.722 - 00:03:14.794, Speaker B: And that's because we can hit transactions per second essentially of more than 9000.
00:03:14.992 - 00:03:21.546, Speaker A: Wow, that's amazing because obviously Ethereum is at, I think, about 15 transactions a second.
00:03:21.728 - 00:03:24.400, Speaker B: That's right. And five NFT transactions per second.
00:03:25.090 - 00:03:31.134, Speaker A: Okay, so orders of magnitude higher. So how does Immutable X solve these issues?
00:03:31.332 - 00:04:18.986, Speaker B: Yeah, it's pretty simple, actually, which is first, I wanted to start with what does layer two actually mean? The definition of a layer two is it inherits the underlying security of the layer one blockchain. So really what we're talking about here is when you perform a trade on Immutable X it's game theoretically secured to the same extent that a transaction on Ethereum mainnet is. And that's really, really important because that's the fundamental difference between building another centralized database or building an actual decentralized solution. And that's what a lot of the people who come and talk to us care about. And also personally, I like it because I think that Ethereum is the place where all the network effects and activity works. But back to the actual question, which is how does it work? It's very simple. Right now, every time you perform an Ethereum trade on L One you are performing a transaction that costs gas.
00:04:18.986 - 00:04:50.758, Speaker B: You're using work on the Ethereum blockchain. What we do is we take those trades and instead of performing them directly on Ethereum you sign a transaction with your Ethereum private key. We then grab a bunch of those trades, we wrap them into a proof. And that's where Starware's proving technology comes into play as our technology partner. And we bundle up that proof and basically upload that to the Ethereum blockchain. It's in what is known as a validity proof. And this is quite important, the difference between fraud proofs and validity proofs.
00:04:50.758 - 00:05:31.922, Speaker B: So fraud proofs are what optimistic based solutions use and they're a really good fit for some things like especially DeFi contracts. So synthetix is obviously launching on optimism. But fundamentally what you need for NFTs is a solution which is correct from the moment it hits the Ethereum main net. And that's the difference between a validity or fraud based proof is a fraud based proof requires one to two weeks for it to be correct. Anyone can challenge it or say that it's fraudulent. And a validity proof is correct from the moment it hits Ethereum, from the moment we upload that proof. Which is essential for NFTs because you essentially can't market make or provide synthetic liquidity for people wanting to withdraw NFTs.
00:05:31.922 - 00:05:46.710, Speaker B: Because how can I, as a market maker loan you a one of a kind kings of Leon NFT or whatever unique instance of that NFT was. Whereas I can do that for, say, a synthetics where you can have market makers providing sort of a better experience when users want to withdraw.
00:05:46.870 - 00:05:50.060, Speaker A: Yeah, so for gaming, why is that especially important?
00:05:50.530 - 00:06:35.462, Speaker B: Well, if you're gaming, you probably want to be able to withdraw your assets instantaneously. You also want the security of your assets to be completely essentially there. And that's the big reason why we weren't happy going to say, like a side chain or a new blockchain. But also importantly is in gaming, you have the ability to mint NFTs as a play to earn scheme. So a common progression of games is when you play it, you receive an item and reward for your essentially experience or however you're spending time in the game. And what we do is we allow that to be done completely for free. So game developers can now mint sort of millions of assets a day, and they can use that to reward their players.
00:06:35.462 - 00:06:39.114, Speaker B: And they're not paying $30 to $50 per asset for the creation of those.
00:06:39.152 - 00:06:43.360, Speaker A: Assets and so on immutable X, how much are they paying?
00:06:44.050 - 00:07:06.250, Speaker B: Zero. You pay zero for the instantiation of an NFT. We take clips on when they're traded for value. So we make money when the people using our protocol makes money. But essentially the way that cost structure works is we pay very significant fixed costs to run the uploading of proofs every year. And that means we're able to make the trades free for everyone who uses the protocol.
00:07:06.430 - 00:07:12.070, Speaker A: And then so you're making money on what on the initial sale of the items?
00:07:12.410 - 00:07:16.440, Speaker B: Yeah, the initial sale. And then user to user trades for value after that.
00:07:17.930 - 00:07:22.380, Speaker A: So when users sell to each other, then you make a cut from that.
00:07:22.910 - 00:07:46.830, Speaker B: Yeah, but the important thing is those fees are set at a protocol level. So if a marketplace were to use us and implement us as a gas free scaling solution for trading their NFTs, they can put whatever marketplace fees they want on top of that. And if a game were to use us, they could put whatever gaming fees they want on top of that. So really the goal is we kind of make money when we're processing tens of billions of dollars in volume.
00:07:47.190 - 00:08:36.318, Speaker A: Right, like a long tail as other games come to your platform. Yeah. And just for listeners, I did also want to mention so Starkware is the partner enabling this, and they did come on a show I did with dYdX, because they're also working with dYdX. And if you're interested in learning more, the difference between optimistic roll ups versus ZK roll ups. We did go into that, but essentially optimistic roll ups have an optimistic attitude of assuming that a transaction is good, which is why they look for fraud after, whereas ZK roll ups is more of a pessimistic view, which is trying to be certain from the outset. Since you've launched Immutable X on April eigth, how has that changed? Trading on Gods unchained.
00:08:36.494 - 00:09:08.246, Speaker B: Yeah, so it's been really exciting. It's obviously incredibly pre alpha. If you use our marketplace, the front end is a pretty sparse experience. And that's intentional. We are really just testing, does this protocol work in production so our partners can roll out their experiences, but it's been way beyond our expectations. So I think in the first 24 hours alone, we processed more user to user NFT trades than Ethereum had done in the previous week. And now we've saved users something like nearly $2 million in gas fees.
00:09:08.246 - 00:09:34.434, Speaker B: So we've been really excited. The stat that actually really excites me is the average value of a trade is $17 us. No, NFT is traded for $17 on layer one because the gas fees, as you say, are like $50 to $90 to trade a single NFT. So really what we're doing is we're unlocking an economy that should exist but can't right now because of the topology of these prices and gas fees underneath. Yeah.
00:09:34.472 - 00:09:51.482, Speaker A: So in a moment, we're going to talk a little bit more about that. But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make this show possible.

And in 2021, that number is growing faster than ever.
00:10:25.942 - 00:11:16.870, Speaker A: If you're looking to make your first NFT, check out Near's fast, scalable, low cost, open source platform.

With fundraising opportunities and support for DAOs and DAP to engage fans and reach new audiences, come learn why near is the infrastructure for innovation@nea.org. So earlier when you were talking about the different options for scaling, I noticed that the Immutable Twitter account had tweeted, quote, switching away from Ethereum is laughable. And you did kind of imply that in what you were saying. So just talk about that. Why did you feel that trying a competing blockchain would not be in line with your goals?
00:11:17.610 - 00:11:51.610, Speaker B: Look, it's obviously a bold statement to make, but you ultimately have to draw a line in the sand when it comes to discussions of users security for their assets. And the reason we are so hardlined about this is two reasons. One, when we initially set out to build Immutable, we very clearly wanted to build a scaling protocol for NFTs. And we looked at many, many solutions along the way. We looked at Plasma, we looked at state channels. Days didn't work out. And quite frankly, I think a lot of people at that time said for two reasons they were going to build competing blockchains with Ethereum.
00:11:51.610 - 00:12:52.366, Speaker B: One was they wanted to own a very valuable protocol and that was kind of the favored VC hypothesis at that time was you had to build a new blockchain in order to be able to control value on your network. And two was nothing was scaling Ethereum, particularly for NFTs. There was literally no end in sight. East Two was years away and then literally, I think three months after Dapper made the decision to build Flow and we were still looking at what to build. ZK roll ups first worked in production on Ethereum main net, which was really the first time we saw the light at the end of the tunnel for Ethereum scaling. And so that was a very clear choice for us because ultimately what is going to govern success is where do network effects live? There's a reason that every single ETH killer basically hosted their ICO on Ethereum. There's a reason that successful NFT projects organically emerge from Ethereum rather than being bought by other big chains.
00:12:52.366 - 00:13:45.262, Speaker B: And I can't tell you the amount of times that a large blockchain has come to immutable and hey, like what do we have to do to get God's unchained on our blockchain? But the truth at the end of the day is two things. One is a lot of these competitors are basically the Microsoft Services Network to the open Internet. They're simply going to fail because they closed garden ecosystems rather than embracing what NFTs are supposed to do, which is an open token standard on a completely decentralized protocol to power the physics of digital ownership. But second, the important thing is where do users want to trade? Where is money being spent? These things really, really matter. And ultimately fighting Ethereum's network effect is a very tall task. People have raised tens of billions of dollars to do it and as of yet everyone's pretty much failed. The ones with the biggest traction are also the ones with the biggest risk.
00:13:45.262 - 00:14:13.950, Speaker B: Whether that's because they've just copied essentially Ethereum's virtual machine and the code running Ethereum and they're going to run the same scaling issues that Ethereum does without the people building layer twos on top of them, or because when they take a centralized action because of the incentives of whoever is running it, everyone realizes the inherent existential risk associated with that database. Essentially. And you see capital flight of expensive assets.
00:14:15.570 - 00:14:24.990, Speaker A: So earlier when you talked about some of these microservices network style blockchains, would that be something like Flow which is more centralized?
00:14:25.570 - 00:14:41.750, Speaker B: Look, yeah, I think ultimately there are a lot of competing blockchains to Ethereum right now and the short way I say it is the only way any of them are achieving scalability right now is by reducing the decentralization level. Like you don't just magically create 20,000 TPS.
00:14:42.250 - 00:14:51.910, Speaker A: Yes, that is obviously it's. The legendary what is it called? The blockchain scalability Trilemma.
00:14:52.650 - 00:14:53.410, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:14:53.580 - 00:14:58.940, Speaker A: Yeah. Now that you have Immutable X, what new features can you offer that you could not before?
00:14:59.710 - 00:15:53.590, Speaker B: So this is actually something we're really, really excited about. And the short answer is we're obsessed with providing liquidity for NFTs. What does that mean? It means that when a user buys or trades an NFT, they're getting the best possible price. And the problem with NFTs is the thing that makes them awesome, which is that they're completely unique digital instances also makes them suck for liquidity. Because if I have 10 million Gods Unchained NFTs or 1000 Kings of Leon NFTs, I have 10 million individual order books, each with their own bids, asks and spreads. And the majority of them will never be traded on because people only want to buy the cheapest or the most expensive or things with particularly unique provenance. So what you need is you need a way to create fungible markets based on the characteristics of the NFTs at will while also allowing them to retain their uniqueness.
00:15:53.590 - 00:16:50.442, Speaker B: And people have tried to create solutions to this ERC 1155, but the problem is then you're just losing uniqueness completely. You can never track the provenance of who owns something or who uses something. So the thing we're most excited about is metadata based orders, we call it, which basically means, let's say there are 100 Kings of Leon NFTs. You can actually trade that set of 100 as a fungible market if you care. And if you really just want the one that was actually used by someone famous or owned by someone famous, you can only trade it on that market. Or you can instantaneously via a zero knowledge proof list it on a fungible market that trades based on the characteristics of an NFT. Or you can see the use cases elsewhere, whether it's you're taking a gaming item and you can trade it based on the underlying characteristics of the asset rather than having it being unique based on its experience or whether it's an art asset.
00:16:50.442 - 00:17:05.880, Speaker B: This allows us to do the functionality of, say, open orders like Nifty gateway implements, but via a decentralized zero knowledge proof rather than a centralized backend. So this is really, really significant and it's impossible to recreate on layer one, which is the thing we're most excited about.
00:17:08.090 - 00:17:20.380, Speaker A: What you just said is something interesting that I didn't understand before. So for ERC 1155 tokens, there's some metadata that's lost. Oh, interesting.
00:17:21.390 - 00:17:22.486, Speaker B: They're not unique anymore.
00:17:22.518 - 00:18:04.850, Speaker A: You know what's so fascinating? Okay, because I actually thought that that was some kind of improvement on ERC 721 and didn't understand there was a trade off. So that's very fascinating, but for listeners who aren't aware. So an ERC 1155 enables you to do something more similar to ticket NFTs, where there's probably maybe some kind of general admission type NFT for some event. And so there's like a limited number, but within that class they're fungible. All right, so very interesting. Thanks for making that point. So Immutable is also now recruiting what you're calling Alpha Partners.
00:18:04.850 - 00:18:13.638, Speaker A: What kinds of partners are you looking for? Are they only other games on decentralized games or can there be other kinds of NFT creators?
00:18:13.814 - 00:19:11.782, Speaker B: Yeah, no, not at all. Ultimately, we look for kind of businesses to be building on top of our protocol, because then those businesses can go and get their customers and kind of build their strategy on top of us. Rather than say, if you want to do an NFT drop, we can support you, but most of the time we're going to be pointing you to someone doing drops run by Immutable X. So we're really at that kind of protocol level in terms of where do we sit in a stack of businesses. So the way to think about us, and this is often confusing because there are a bunch of new drops websites and aggregators and marketplaces coming out of the weeds and we really don't compete with any of those. Our vision is to be the scalability protocol, powering them under the hood. So when you perform a trade on a marketplace, that marketplace is running that order via Immutable X under hood, and they're getting all the benefits of Ethereum securities for NFTs, or when a game wants to create and trade assets, they're doing so via Immutable X under the hood.
00:19:11.782 - 00:19:44.818, Speaker B: But you never even have to go to Immutable.com. They can be run entirely within the context of the gaming application, whether that's Fortnite or whether that's an Assassin's Creed or whether that's a RuneScape. And that's important because Fortnite isn't going to send you to Immutable.com marketplace, they want it to be created within their gaming context. Now, I don't know whether Fortnite will end up using Ethereum at all, or whether they'll go with their own system, but the fundamental perspective is if we're going to make Ethereum mainstream for NFTs, we have to allow people to trade where they want their business to have their users trade.
00:19:44.994 - 00:19:53.370, Speaker A: And so when you talked about businesses, are you primarily imagining games or are there other types of businesses that you think would be no, literally everyone.
00:19:53.440 - 00:20:28.680, Speaker B: So, I mean, we're talking to all the major art marketplaces, all the major Drop websites. We're actually talking to a few DeFi NFT contracts, which is really, really interesting. Obviously, Superfarm is using Immutable X and they're essentially a generalized Minting protocol so that you can kind of create NFT reward schemes based on any underlying fungible token. So basically, if you need to create or trade NFTs in a decentralized manner and get the best possible liquidity and network effects for them, come talk to us. And we really do service everyone.
00:20:29.290 - 00:20:38.200, Speaker A: And can you just draw out that example a little bit more with the DFI NFT, where you said it was like rewards? How does that work?
00:20:39.050 - 00:21:28.098, Speaker B: Yeah, the big category here is there are a lot of DFI contracts and protocols now that are using NFTs. We saw Uniswap V Three do the very bold decision to switch to LP tokens becoming NFTs rather than ERC 20s, which allows you to denominate the range of price at which you are happy to be a liquidity provider. We saw Yearn finance issue an insurance NFT. More and more and more we're going to see huge swathes of financial products being represented via non fungible asset classes because this actually is it represents a huge portion of value in the real world. Whether know insurance is fundamentally unique. Term deposits are unique contracts. A bunch of the stuff that is traded like trillions of dollars per year are traded in unique manners and characteristics.
00:21:28.098 - 00:21:33.338, Speaker B: Eventually they're all going to move to the blockchain. And so those people need a scalable way to do that.
00:21:33.504 - 00:21:40.890, Speaker A: Immutable is purchasing carbon credits to offset the gas that the protocol consumes on ethereum. How did you come to that decision?
00:21:41.390 - 00:22:25.162, Speaker B: It was pretty easy for us. It was both a decision that we felt good about and also a decision that is good for our business and those are the easiest decisions to make. So ultimately, what we really care about is true decentralization of NFTs, right? Which means when people trade an NFT, they're trading on the biggest public blockchain that no one can take your asset from. That really matters to me because whoever wins this race now over the next few years is going to be the default infrastructure for digital asset trading for the future universe. People are going to live in VR, they're going to be trading digital assets. We want to make sure that the infrastructure lives on ethereum rather than something that's owned by VCs or rather than something that's owned by a government. So that is important.
00:22:25.162 - 00:22:53.874, Speaker B: And that leads me to the next thing, which is you can't have anything holding back people from using a public blockchain, especially things like carbon neutrality, because every other side chain or public blockchain out there can say that they are completely carbon neutral because they don't use any miners to secure the network. Like, it's very easy to have your 300 computers running a database be carbon neutral. You're just paying the electricity costs for 300 laptops. And so it's very important that we give that same ability to ethereum itself. All right.
00:22:53.912 - 00:23:44.580, Speaker A: Yeah, and I just want to remind listeners that actually your kind of philosophical stance here, I think, harkens back to one of the initial sparks around the popularity of your game, which was the Hearthstone controversy, where a player on that game expressed his political views about Hong Kong and was, I guess punished for it. And you guys invited him to your game and sent him some money. A little bit of history there. All right, so in terms of NFTs and gaming, what do you expect to happen with Immutable X? That was not possible before and what might we see from God's unchanged by the end of the year.
00:23:45.130 - 00:24:45.254, Speaker B: So my time frame six months ago was that mainstream games, I'm talking about market caps between $100 million up to 10 billion. So big studios would start to seriously look and experiment in NFTs in two to three years. I've brought that timeframe to now. And every single corp dev studio or strategy studio is now rapidly spinning up a team to say how the hell do we make sure we stay on top of NFTs? They're now gone from the curious incumbent who is trying to make sure that they stay ahead of the game to terrified that there is going to be a new way of running digital assets or running digital economies that they are missing out on. And also they're seeing this to be a more legitimate way for them to monetize and actually create success in their business. They're not seeing it as much of a disruption and more as something that can actually enhance their business model. So I think that's really exciting from not just a threat perspective but also a hey, this is a way to do it better.
00:24:45.254 - 00:25:46.250, Speaker B: What I think Immutable X allows is two things. One is we allow that to be done in a way that is dedicated for we build God's unchained so we would have the perfect customer to build the scalability protocol and also to take on hearthstone as you said. But the reality is we've designed this for the most complicated use case and the most expensive use case because you want to be minting millions of millions of NFTs a day if you're a major economy with like 10 million Dow or 50 million Dow, which is what the biggest games in the world are. So we need infrastructure which supports that level of scale. So in short, what I think Immutable X provides is a way for them to access NFTs that their users can know will always be secure, that they can run a business on without having to compromise around. We have to send eyeballs to here or lose this kind of critical component of our business strategy. But most importantly, they're going to use NFTs now we're making sure that they have a viable way to use it on ethereum rather than going to a centralized ETH killer.
00:25:46.590 - 00:25:51.626, Speaker A: Great. Well thank you so much for coming on Unconfirmed. It's been great talking with you.

00:26:34.678 - 00:27:20.940, Speaker A: On may 1, brian brooks will become the new CEO at binance us. Brooks recently stepped down as the acting head at the Office of the Controller of the Currency, where he served during the final nine months of the Trump administration. Before joining the OCC, Brooks was the chief legal officer at Coinbase, which is arguably the biggest competitor to Binance US'parent company Binance. Under his leadership, the OCC released guidance allowing banks to custody crypto assets for customers and use stablecoins to perform transactions. While his stint at the OCC was brief, spanning from last May to January of this year, during that time he earned the nickname Cryptocontroller on social media.

Chao Wang, former founder of Masari, summed up the crazy week in Dogecoin best. The fact that Doge is a number five market cap and about to flip in B and B is a testament to, number one, the power of memes and social media influencers. Two, the sheer amount of central banking liquidity sloshing around the system and inefficiently allocated three, how much the truth there is behind the IQ bell curve.
