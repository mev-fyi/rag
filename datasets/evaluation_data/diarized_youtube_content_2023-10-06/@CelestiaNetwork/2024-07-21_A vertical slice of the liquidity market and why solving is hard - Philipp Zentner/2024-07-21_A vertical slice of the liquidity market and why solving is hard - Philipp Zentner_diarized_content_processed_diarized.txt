00:00:01.880 - 00:00:46.776, Speaker A: Thank you all for coming. So I basically talked to you so real quick. I'm Philip right, I'm the founder and CEO of DeFi. We are a 65 people company by now, have been around since 21, and we came into this space, looked at it, and we said, ok, the only way this is going to scale is horizontally. That means across multiple blockchains, l one's, l two s, l three s, that we have a database background. So we knew already, if this is supposed to scale, it has to be multi chain. So we looked at how would that scale? Then we looked at cross chain bridges, liquidity networks, and we figured if this is supposed to find any adoption from top level applications, someone needs to aggregate it and inspect it away.
00:00:46.776 - 00:01:41.278, Speaker A: So if you're a simple API interface, you can build on and you don't have to care about all these short innovation cycles down there. That was the idea of Defi, played out well when I was serving metamask. Phantom, Robinhood, OpenSea, brave browser Ledger, they're all using us. So in this talk, we're going to go through the whole stack in terms of where is liquidity being created on the asset layer, so to say, and where is it being traded on the top layer and which players are in between and how things are evolving. So first we're going to talk about the asset layer where we have typically l one s, two s and three s to set for execute and scale. That's the blockchain level right here. We mint and burn assets, typically ERC 20s when we are in ethereum context, then now as we have these l one, l two s, l three s, and we have a multi chain environment, we have seen more and more multi chain standards coming out.
00:01:41.278 - 00:02:17.870, Speaker A: So standards that allow us to mint and burn a token on multiple chains. So layer zero has one of the most famous multi chain standards is the omni chain fungible token. The oft. We have its from axelar and entity from wormhole. Essentially all these messaging bridges that allow us to send data, they allow us to mint and burn assets on multiple chains. And of course they all want to have ecosystem logins, so they try to convince large projects to launch their token on their own multi chain token standard. And then recently there's a new startup that came out as XErC 20.
00:02:17.870 - 00:02:54.950, Speaker A: Interesting for you to know. If you see like any of these assets you're trading has one of these standards, you can anticipate at least this token is going to launch on another chain. So from your liquid fund perspective, that's interesting. If you see, well, this is an XRC 20, an oft its entity. You can already anticipate, well, there is going to be another chart, hey, there's going to be another chart where there is a new price discovery happening. And this can be promising. We haven't seen many projects doing that yet, but this will be the standard like the default in the future.
00:02:54.950 - 00:03:40.272, Speaker A: The problem with these messaging bridges is that these projects have a huge lock in effect. They have a huge vendor lock in with these providers. So as long as layer zero, wormhole, Axelar and some exist, it's fine, actually join. If not, if one of these companies are dying, could be problematic for these projects because then their token cannot be maintained anymore. Essentially, that's the risk. And EXerc 20 is a bridge agnostic standard. So while all of these its entities have essentially a vendor login, XErc 20 do not have that.
00:03:40.272 - 00:04:15.280, Speaker A: Instead, XErc 20 allow you to use any messaging bridge underneath. Replace that one, and on top it has rate limiting implemented on top of that. So it's rate limiting the amount of assets that can be burned and minted in the same timeframe. So it's much more safe in case one of these bridges would get hacked. Now here we are minting all these assets, tokens, nfts, real world assets. Fine. On top of that, we have to understand that sending messages back and forth is very expensive.
00:04:15.280 - 00:04:48.478, Speaker A: These messaging bridges are so called ambs, arbitrary data messaging bridges. And in order to validate arbitrary data, you have lots of checks and validations. That's expensive. Right? But we want to have cheap transfers. So what all these bridges have done, these messaging bridges, they've built their own liquidity networks on top. So layer Zero has built Stargate, Axlar has built Squidgesthe, Vaumol has portal and mayan. Right? And these liquidity networks, they do the same as the messaging bridges.
00:04:48.478 - 00:05:28.926, Speaker A: They validate data, but they do it so limited, so they know exactly which kind of data they're going to receive. Therefore, they have less checks, less things to validate, and that makes it much, much cheaper. Also on top of that, instead of minting and burning assets, they often have liquidity pools on multiple chains. So funds are just being locked and released, and they do not even have to be minted and burned. That's the asset layer. That's the core of how assets are being created, burned and transferred. All these liquidity networks and bridges, they're also third party liquidity networks like symbiosis or synapse or orbiter, different kinds of bridge designs.
00:05:28.926 - 00:06:08.202, Speaker A: And we have seen bridges being hacked quite a lot, especially in the beginning when they were all rushing to the market in order to get market share. They are all on a trust spectrum. So whenever we introduce a third party system to validate data, we essentially have to have to assume that we can trust that third party. And in the best case, this third party system would be as decentralized as the networks it connects. And here we have different teams, different ways to do that. Some have optimistic bridges, so they take some sort of analogy, risk. The nearest rainbow bridge was one of the first ones.
00:06:08.202 - 00:07:03.266, Speaker A: And that way we have lite clients and relay based bridges like IBC within Cosmos, Zknowledge bridges. There are many ways to do it, and it actually takes a decent amount of research to understand what is safe and what's not. Hey, so yeah, maybe for you, as a quick, we have small rounds, so we can just go back real quick. So essentially, we have been talking about the asset layer, where we have l one s, two l three s, messaging bridges and different multichain token standards. We have liquidity networks that make it faster and cheaper to transfer assets. And that's the base asset layer. The idea of this talk is to give better insight on the vertical slice of where liquidity is created and how it's traded.
00:07:03.266 - 00:07:40.714, Speaker A: Okay? And from there, as we talk about bridges, we have to understand there are many ways to validate and verify bridging transactions. So we just went through a few of them. It's on the trust spectrum, because depending on how you build a bridge, we have more or less trust assumptions. Levi's homework is to do the research on this, evaluate these projects before we integrate them. And that's what, essentially, our clients are trusting us with that. Trust us that we do that research, understand which risks are being taken, and making smart implementation choices. Because there are actually 100 bridges out there, we have only implemented 17.
00:07:40.714 - 00:08:03.846, Speaker A: To give you an idea how that looks like. On top of the asset layer, we will have a two pillar system. We have the decentralized exchange layer on the left, we have the centralized exchange layer on the right. They both coexist. We have centralized exchanges with order books. Market makers are active here. And these market makers make sure that prices are stable.
00:08:03.846 - 00:08:54.108, Speaker A: They buy and sell a specific token to make sure that the price doesn't fluctuate too much. And people can trade with not too much slippage, essentially. And then market makers, again, are buying liquidity from OTC and Popdesk. So at large discounts in large sizes. And that's essentially how the centralized part looks like. And then we have DEXs index aggregators, where we have DEXs with their own price functions, index aggregators that make sure that as we have fragmented liquidity pools on each chain, someone is able to reduce slippage by splitting a transfer across multiple liquidity pools. So if you have three dexes with 50k each in a liquidity pool, but someone wants to trade 200k, then it's at that point becomes really difficult.
00:08:54.108 - 00:09:25.600, Speaker A: So splitting these trades makes sense. And then even much smarter system like solver systems that go one step further. They would, for example, not only split transfers across multiple liquidity pools, they would be smart and be like actually swapping a for b is bad. I can use a to get a loan for c, and b and c are actually much more tradable. And they do like smart things with smart, with flash loans and everything. So that's what a sophisticated solver system would do. There are not many of them out there yet.
00:09:25.600 - 00:10:09.730, Speaker A: We have Barter OTX odos. There are some smart systems. It requires lots of financial engineering, and it's not that easy, but that's essentially what's happening here. And on top, we have payment for order flow systems, and these payment for order flow systems, they essentially ask for private order flow and monetize that. There often is some front running and back running. And I, there's also arbitrage being done between dexs and taxes. And because having thoughtful systems and solvers are doing arbitrage between decentralized and centralized liquidity, they get a chance to make money, even though the spread is very tight and they don't take any fees in between.
00:10:09.730 - 00:10:45.030, Speaker A: No, not yet, not yet. We are so far focused on, we are so far focused on the decentralized side, DeXs, Dex aggregators, and cross chain bridges. But as we also aggregate the solver systems that do the arbitrage, we inherit the price advantage a solver can give. And thats the good part. So essentially, we indirectly, passively profit from sex Dex arbitrage by implementing players that do the arbitrage.
00:10:46.650 - 00:10:50.270, Speaker B: Soft chain for leafy.
00:10:50.570 - 00:11:26.406, Speaker A: Yes, absolutely. And the solar systems also, the solar systems are centralized instances. For them, performance is everything. So they actually develop, most of them are developing the tech in low level languages like rust, and make sure it's super, super fast. It's actually quite expensive and not really economic to run a solver, like building a solver. Essentially, a solver is nothing else than aggregator. Levi could be a solver himself, but if you want to be competitive as a solver you really need to focus on specific token pairs and become the best at these routes.
00:11:26.406 - 00:11:38.558, Speaker A: You want to be very very specialized. That's how you win in this Java game. And that's just tough as we are such a small group. May I ask what your backgrounds are? I know yours already, what do you do?
00:11:38.734 - 00:11:41.982, Speaker B: So I'm building a data analytics platform for web3.
00:11:42.166 - 00:11:44.210, Speaker A: Interesting. He's a data analyst and maybe.
00:11:46.100 - 00:11:46.412, Speaker C: I.
00:11:46.436 - 00:12:05.948, Speaker A: Used to be a researcher, kind of retired, and now I'm going back to it after two years. So there's a lot of new stuff. Oh nice. Interesting. Okay cool. I can also go quickly go back for you how we started. We started with the asset layer where we talked about liquidity fragmentation across different l one s, two s, l three s.
00:12:05.948 - 00:12:40.274, Speaker A: Where we mint assets. We have multiple multichain token standards. That's very interesting for you to look into because it's a new stuff. It's like XLC 20 which is bridge agnostic ofts by a zero, its by Axela, and NTTs by wormhole. And thats how assets are being minted, burned and transferred. On top of that we have liquidity networks that make that transfer faster and cheaper because they dont mint and burn, they have liquidity pools and theyre lock and release and thats how DeFi started. We started aggregating liquidity networks so that we can freely move assets.
00:12:40.274 - 00:13:07.038, Speaker A: And you do not have to do your own research on which bridge to use because of what is safe and whats not safe, and to cover all source and destination routes from there we just discussed the exchange layer where we have the decentralized side and the centralized side. And this looks very simple essentially. Yeah. Dexs. Dex aggregators and Dexs and market makers, some server systems in between. Cool. But it's actually much more complex.
00:13:07.038 - 00:13:39.758, Speaker A: So we have on the decentralized side, typically our amms uniswap, V two and v three, and I also now v four. Right. We have multi asset amms like balancer and we have order books, indexes like Vx and Diode. Diode is like an order book amm on mega eth. So it only exists because mega eth is so fast. It's actually faster than Solana and only because of the speed it's able to run order book on chain and stablecoin specialized amms like curve, multi chain. Dex as a catalyst.
00:13:39.758 - 00:14:16.196, Speaker A: Very interesting. They're utilizing messaging bridges to have multi chain price functions. And this is like a new breed of amms in that multi channel environment which is also super interesting. To look into. And then we have other Amm innovations like we see batch transfers and coincident of ones like Housewap, Gelato, Arrakis are releasing hot. It's hybrid order flow token transfers. So there is innovation happening on the Dex side and many people don't see that.
00:14:16.196 - 00:14:51.590, Speaker A: But there is a lot of stuff happening and for us it is a challenge to keep up with that already. This is already a lot and that's just on the Dex side and we have not reached the end game there yet. It's very interesting to look into these new models. I can specifically recommend to look into catalyst. Hot is just being launched and Doyode is an interesting concept. All the other ones are established players, but also they are releasing new, new versions. So that being said, similar thing on the centralized exchange thing where we RFQs are not rocket science, we have had them forever.
00:14:51.590 - 00:15:41.752, Speaker A: But there are new liquidity sources coming up every now and then. We also see centralized exchange bridges like Rocket X and Layerswap. That's interesting because centralized liquidity is very deep and has less slippage in general. So if you can build bridges on top of that, it's not the decentralized way we want, but at least for the short to mid term, this is also a way to go. And yeah, we are sitting on top of all of that and try to wait and try to make sure that essentially, yeah, I use it. We're sitting here and we are watching all of that happening and all of these projects are talking to us. Lefi has so much distribution power by now, working with Robinhood, Midnas, Phantom, brave browser, OpenSea, you name it.
00:15:41.752 - 00:16:26.882, Speaker A: So we have so much distribution power that we get to see all these innovations very early on in their seed stages. It's very interesting to see and there's a lot of research to be done and I think there's a lot of room for improvement as well. We have to figure things out. Many things are simply not possible due to the slowness of the chain, due to reorg risks, due to finality risk, especially in the multichain environment. Lots of things to be figured out. New approaches like catalyst that build our messaging bridges also are realizing, damn, these messaging bridges are still early, they're slow, the tech is unreliable. Now we have a new breed of message of zero knowledge proving bridges like herodotus, like ronge, right? So there's zero knowledge proving happening.
00:16:26.882 - 00:17:09.648, Speaker A: And that again gives us opportunities to reinvent how we engage and trade multichain. So there's a lot happening and we will see short we want to have short innovation cycles over the next three years, like at least, what is the intent system? An intent system. So typically, if a user engaged with DeFi, he implicitly has a preference. That means I want to swap a for b. For that, I go to a specific Dex like uniswap. So I'm making a choice. Where do I want to trade this? Now, this works to a certain degree.
00:17:09.648 - 00:17:40.726, Speaker A: In a multi chain environment, you have to make so many choices, right? How do I bridge my assets to get from a to b? How do I choose which dex to use? Which Dex does even exist on the chains? There are multi chain liquidity aggregators like jumper exchange. Who help you doing that? Like jumper is our b two c interface. It uses our API in the background. So we help you make that choice, but we still let you make a choice. We give you different routes. You simply say, I have the intent to swap a for b. Then we give you different routes to arrive there, and you make your preference.
00:17:40.726 - 00:18:19.350, Speaker A: In the intent system. We assume that the user doesn't care anymore. You simply say, I want to swap a for b. And as you're swapping a for b, we figure out we delegate the solving of this to someone else who is just smarter around that. You simply give your intent, I want to swap a for b. And then there's a network of solvers behind these intent systems, and they compete for providing you the best price to arrive there. And these solver systems, then they compete on the price and they try to give you the best price possible, while at the same time making cut for themselves.
00:18:19.350 - 00:18:45.518, Speaker A: And then there are different new intense systems. So Uniswap has released Unix. One inch has released one int fusion. Cowswap technically is an intense system. Across is an intense system style bridge. There are also generalized intense systems like suave anoma, essential. There are different approaches now to tackle this intent centric idea, and I'm saying idea because right now everything is assumption based.
00:18:45.518 - 00:19:18.370, Speaker A: No one knows what the demand for that right now is, because most of defi is defi power users. And Defi power users, they actually want to exactly understand what's happening with their money. And talking to a solver also means you have to trust them that they give you the best price. You don't know. So a sophisticated Defi power user simply wants to make their choices on themselves. We'll see. It certainly is the future as crypto is getting abstracted away and we have more end consumer applications.
00:19:18.370 - 00:19:47.208, Speaker A: If we tell our friend to buy a certain token using the Robinhood app. They certainly just need an intent system. They don't care what's happening in the background, right? To make a stronger point on why, hey, on if and why aggregation is worth it. This is just the distribution of swaps on one particular chain. And this is a chart, it's a pie chart from February. So this is already outdated. But what I can tell you, it's constantly fluctuating.
00:19:47.208 - 00:20:30.570, Speaker A: So all these Dexs, index aggregators, you think they are not doing things, they are constantly optimizing and battling each other. And this pie chart looks different week by week and chain by chain. So on each chain you see the major chains, right? All these different Dex aggregators and DeXs, they do have different performance on different chains. And it often just depends on how many liquidity sources do they access. And then this again depends also on how much time do they have to execute. To make an example, let's say there's a chain with 300 liquidity sources, like Ethereum l one. If you would query all of them, you would have a response time of 15 seconds.
00:20:30.570 - 00:21:29.948, Speaker A: But if you only have 1 second to resolve, you have to make smart choices which liquidity sources to talk to in order to arrive at a price. And so this is again then where you historically want to collect data and want to understand historically, given this trade pair, which liquidity sources have performed best. So it's very competitive, very expensive and fierce. That's just one thing that people often don't see how these dex aggregators and solversystem are actually competing on which level. And it's crazy. What people also don't see is, for us with Levi for example, what we are doing is we keep track, implement and maintain hundreds of APIs. We at least have to have one RPC per chain.
00:21:29.948 - 00:22:00.154, Speaker A: We also want to have failed safety. So we are on 27 chains right now. So we have around 50 rpcs implemented. Getting the gas estimations is the hardest. You have to re implement gas estimations for each chain. And as you have multi chain transactions, you have often a source chain swap, bridging transaction and destination swap. And like guest estimations are getting really tricky because you have guest slippages on both chains you have outgoing asset and destination asset and bridging asset slippage.
00:22:00.154 - 00:22:30.554, Speaker A: So you have like six, seven different slippages. You have to calculate and get right, otherwise your transaction fails. So doing this in reliable fashion is really tough. We have 65 people working on that fee markets in general, all these purchase dexes have their own fees on top of the slippage. It just gets very complicated. We need relay networks and transaction simulations to reduce failure rate even further. Often then to keep track of all of this is also harder.
00:22:30.554 - 00:23:07.350, Speaker A: If you have a bridging transaction, you actually have two transactions. The user sends his funds on the source chain to the bridge, first transaction, and then the bridge releases the funds on the destination chain to the user's wallethead. The second transaction, you have to keep track of that and make that visible to clients. Then you have different asset representations. So you have USDC, USDCA, USDCe, red USDC in different forms. Canonical asset representations is a lot of work to keep track of and make sure that they're obviously also scammers. So this is a lot of work on top.
00:23:07.350 - 00:23:49.010, Speaker A: Then status code mapping, hundreds of APIs and you want to give your clients a clean developer experience. You have to homogenize all these different error codes and don't think that anyone in crypto is professional enough to communicate. Breaking changes breaking API changes are a pain in the ass for us. But yeah, we have built a huge, extensive alerting monitoring system on top of that. So by now we are good. But it took us three years to arrive somewhere to make that actually scalable and obtainable. And then yeah, you end up with tons of fragmented transaction data and you have to make sense out of that on top.
00:23:49.010 - 00:24:26.872, Speaker A: And then we haven't even touched non EVM, so this is just EVM alone. Right? And now we also support Solana and native bitcoin, but that again took a whole refactoring of everything and we are far away from that. Like, that's what DeFi is doing. That's why we have an incredible technical mode. It's really hard to start copying that. It's easy for the first three, four APIs, then the first needs to be maintained and from there on it just starts sucking. Yeah, we haven't touched fail safety, high availability, global availability optimizations, monitoring analytics just touching base optimizations.
00:24:26.872 - 00:25:00.608, Speaker A: We have 200 requests per second. So if you would relay 200 requests per second to all of our liquidity sources, their APIs would die. They can't even handle the load. So we have a specialized caching for each single API we implement. So we really understand each single API in depth, each endpoint, and see which kind of information can be cached for how long and when do we need to invalidate that cache. So there's just domain specific knowledge on each integration part. Monitoring, analytics, weight limits and API calls are a topic.
00:25:00.608 - 00:25:34.586, Speaker A: Mev protection is a topic, customer support is a topic. So there's a lot overall. We are talking to hundreds of APIs and work with a bunch of projects to make all of that happen. I think. Yeah, I explained Defi in depth already. It's all defi liquidity out of one API and everything around that that's necessary to make it happen. Let's touch base on intents, because intent centric systems are a big topic right now and let's see if intents can solve for all of that.
00:25:34.586 - 00:26:06.760, Speaker A: So historically we have been sending users to exchanges. You went to uniswap, you did your swap and that's it. Then at some point you learned that, oh, there's also a sushi swap and it already was like, let me compare here and there. Then they can pancake swap. And then they came curve for stable coins and then they came balancer with multi asset pools. And like, oh shit, like this is now getting exhausting just to do one swap here, FOMo on the best price at the same time you want to get things done. So at some point Dex aggregators came up one inch, zero x power swap, open ocean dodo.
00:26:06.760 - 00:26:50.192, Speaker A: Right? But then again, we saw on the chart back then that even they are performing very differently. So we are that layer on top, you can check out jumper exchange. So aggregating exchange for them, aggregating exchange. Like one inch started on Ethereum L1, but now we have like 30 relevant evm compatible l two s. And it's just really hard to plug in all these liquidity sources and dexs on each chain. So all these Dex aggregators are having struggling, are struggling to expand what they are doing and still remain competitive. Now the idea with an intent system is, well, why don't we create a network of solving systems? Each solving system is essentially an aggregator themselves.
00:26:50.192 - 00:27:48.844, Speaker A: And so we can create a huge market of solversystems that focus on specialized trade pairs or different intent actions that might, for example, be some boring lending. Some are focusing on just stable coins, some are focusing very niche on three particular chains. They just say, I'm just going to focus on Ethereum and one, optimism, arbitrage, and others like, you know what, I'm just going to focus on the second best chains around that BSc, polygon, avalanche, phantom. And the next is going to be like, you know what, I'll just focus on what is hyped the most right now. Mega eth, Monad scroll, linear, CKC, whatever. So the idea is to create lots of specialists in that market that focus on solving for particular trade pairs and where they can capture the most of the value. The problem here though is by saying we want to do that.
00:27:48.844 - 00:28:21.080, Speaker A: We have a bunch of players like Arnoma Suave, essential brink, one inch fusion, cowswap, Unix, and they all have a chicken egg problem. And chicken ag problem is essentially business. The intent system needs solvers. Solvers need order flow. Now the intent system wants to get order flow from the business. The business is busy business. Well, I can give you order flow if you can solve and then, you know, shake your problem.
00:28:21.080 - 00:28:57.200, Speaker A: What comes first? You need both sides at the same time. So those who are best positioned to actually execute this successfully are those who already have a distribution. So the best chances, one inch with one inch fusion, good call. Uniswap with Unix, good call. Even like a super hyped suave with like hundreds of millions in funding and best investors like paradigm, whatever. It's just so tough for them to execute on this. And so many, many companies in this chain, abstraction, narrative have that problem.
00:28:57.200 - 00:29:18.740, Speaker A: They have chicken egg problems they need to overcome. This leafy is also very well positioned to execute on this, actually. We also building our own intent system or on intent flow because we have the distribution, the order flow already. I don't need that. I can slowly migrate towards an intense centric future. But yeah, for the server market, it's highly competitive on fees. It's low margin.
00:29:18.740 - 00:29:38.410, Speaker A: They need order flow. It's not a typical venture capital case. So while you need financial engineering power and expensive talent, it's not easy to do that if you don't have capital to start with. Right. But eventually, capital case is typically high risk. But high risk, high reward. But the solver is not high risk, high reward.
00:29:38.410 - 00:29:55.248, Speaker A: It's just expensive from day one. And then you can just hope that your revenue goes up linearly. That's kind of it. So it's not a venture capital case. We haven't seen many of them being funded. And then it's. Yeah, the only mode is specialization.
00:29:55.248 - 00:30:29.760, Speaker A: And you specialize in something means you're placing a bet. You're placing a bet on ecosystems, you're placing a bet on assets. And that's just high risk on top. On top of all that already. So we cannot expect that silver market to explode. We can expect that. And that, again brings up philosophical questions, because if we only have like ten to 20 solvers, which is the case right now, we have like 18 solvers and 14 of them now just on Ethereum, and one and only four are multi chain, and they are struggling.
00:30:29.760 - 00:31:04.590, Speaker A: And if that's the case, we again have centralization issues. If you cut these solvers out, but all the order flow runs into intense systems, and then the server market is not sophisticated enough to, to actually operate. That's a huge risk for the industry as well, just to think about. Same for intent markets. Chicken egg, highly competitive for distribution, because, like, Robinhood doesn't want to make a switch from us. So each intent system. So either we built an intent system or we really have to be incentivized to work with an existing intent system to send an autoflow there.
00:31:04.590 - 00:31:48.306, Speaker A: Yeah, there's a lot, there's a lot around this. I don't want to repeat myself, but if you ever want to talk about these things, Lifi gives you access to any kind of liquidity source. We are always on top of things when it comes to what is happening in the liquidity market. Who is doing what? Why is it beneficial? What are the new dynamics and new algorithms that are being tested in terms of finding the best path, the best route? We are in touch already at seat level with all of these companies. Swapping liquidity, moving liquidity, minting burning liquidity. So whenever you need any of that, just come talk to us. I think we can use the remaining ten minutes to just chat about it.
00:31:48.306 - 00:31:51.802, Speaker A: If you have any questions. Yeah, thank you.
00:31:51.906 - 00:32:05.052, Speaker D: I have one question, because when you are trying to figure out your route and it gets better and many routes, even aggravated chains, the longest the route, the more chances that it will actually get reverted at the point.
00:32:05.196 - 00:32:05.972, Speaker A: Yes.
00:32:06.156 - 00:32:09.560, Speaker D: So, but the question is, is that a broadening practice?
00:32:09.980 - 00:32:20.068, Speaker A: Yes, it is. Absolutely. Yeah. So people limit the size of the guess. Guess estimations are the hardest. Once you get multichannel, it becomes even harder. But yes, absolutely, it is a problem.
00:32:20.068 - 00:32:51.568, Speaker A: It's just different asset temperatures you need to consider here. And it also depends on the, whether it's ethereum, l one or l two, because obviously due to the gas costs, ethereum, it makes it much harder to execute complex transactions. But yeah, it's the biggest problem we have. It's one in three years. Lefi still hasn't built a sophisticated enough gas estimation system. That's how we feel. And we putting so many resources into it.
00:32:51.568 - 00:33:17.116, Speaker A: We already make use of data historically, like to relate network congestion with gas price and try to predict how likely is it that the gas price will change in either or direction. And we already add a huge buffer on top, and it's still tough. It's just like. And then you can't produce the best quote anymore. You can be conservative around this. Right. And just add more guests to it.
00:33:17.116 - 00:33:30.640, Speaker A: But then in competitive integrations where you have to compete with others, then you're not competitive anymore because you're giving a worse quote. So it's a difficult, difficult part.
00:33:31.980 - 00:33:34.240, Speaker D: Is it better if you apply me.
00:33:36.100 - 00:33:43.948, Speaker A: For us if we would back run or front run our users or if you would send our transaction into a private member? What do you mean?
00:33:44.084 - 00:33:51.240, Speaker D: I mean that if you can guarantee the order of the block your transaction is going to be in, you can guarantee I will not revert.
00:33:52.540 - 00:33:55.012, Speaker A: It depends if it's same chain or multi chain.
00:33:55.036 - 00:33:56.120, Speaker D: Yeah, same thing.
00:33:56.580 - 00:34:11.650, Speaker A: Yeah. And then of course we could start working with block builders in general. Vertical integration would be our path at some point to capture more value could be one of the paths to capture more value, but we are far away from going that route.
00:34:13.510 - 00:34:25.214, Speaker B: So how does the cash fee get like elected? So let's say I'm making swap from Ethereum to Solana. So do you sort of deduct Ethereum and Solana from the wallet of the user?
00:34:25.342 - 00:34:44.450, Speaker A: Yeah, you're getting a price and the price is essentially the value you put in times the price function to arrive at the destination asset. And then we deduct the gas price necessary and the fees in between. Like the bridging fees, for example. We deduct all of that and give you a price.
00:34:44.750 - 00:34:46.702, Speaker B: So that's from the source asset?
00:34:46.886 - 00:34:47.422, Speaker A: Yes.
00:34:47.526 - 00:34:54.570, Speaker B: I don't have to provide like a different asset. So let's say I'm swapping USDC. I don't have to provide ETH or sell and sold tokens.
00:34:55.030 - 00:35:18.230, Speaker A: Well, if it's UCC to UCC, then the price function is one to one. So that doesn't change. But you still have a bridging fee, for example. All right, this is if you use, if you talk to our API, you're going to get a whole fee breakdown back. There's 100% transparency on that. And you see exactly who is, what is happening. Where do we have which exchange rate and which fees are being deducted down the line?
00:35:20.570 - 00:35:34.820, Speaker C: What are the document aggregators in Doc tree chain? Because I saw you had like a lot of change and then you have like a lot of aggregators and like can you take a look at that?
00:35:34.860 - 00:35:36.916, Speaker A: We can. I mean, this is from February.
00:35:37.068 - 00:36:00.622, Speaker C: Do you see like a pattern that always changes or like, and is there any reason like why it always changes? Because I assume like if there's a certain amount of liquidity in like e, for example, on, initially on Uniscop, then generally like one aggregator will optimize for that and then it will have a huge market share.
00:36:00.726 - 00:36:23.088, Speaker A: I mean, the most price efficient one typically is one inch. But also we see odors capturing a lot more volume. Like odors is a really strong, fairly new player. This is from February. It is constantly changing. Zero X, also pretty established and strong. We just saw Paris version 6.2
00:36:23.088 - 00:37:01.134, Speaker A: launching two weeks ago. Now they are capturing lots more markets. So we constantly see new innovations on how many liquidity sources these aggregators are using. And sometimes they plug in their own liquidity on top, which is an exclusive liquidity, which allows them to provide better prices on certain trade pairs. They cheat their way through this too. So it's competitive and there are many ways to, to arrive at a better price, but it's tough to pinpoint down what it is. Sometimes it's an improved algorithm, sometimes it's new liquidity sources, maybe even it's your own liquidity.
00:37:01.134 - 00:37:25.568, Speaker A: You plug into it as well. Some of them have just in time liquidity. They have a huge liquidity pool. They plug it in just as needed to arrive at a better price, perform the swap. That way they can essentially front run their competition in terms of price discovery. So fierce, fierce market.
00:37:25.704 - 00:37:46.458, Speaker C: It's kind of like, also another question is kind of like more philosophical in terms of like scaling. Because if you build, if you build on top of these layers and each layer ultimately want to take a cut, but then how come you guys are not like connecting directly to the, and optimizing based off of that?
00:37:46.554 - 00:38:11.370, Speaker A: We could do that, but we don't have the resources to do that. We are already. Yeah, so that's why we aggregate Dex aggregators at some point, as mentioned, it would make sense to vertically integrate. Vertically integrate essentially would mean we would build our own bridge. We built our own Dex aggregator and eventually even launch our own Dex with our own liquidity. Right? For certain, for the most important trade pairs, we could go down that path at some point, for sure. It's just like being the top player.
00:38:11.370 - 00:38:51.120, Speaker A: And so what we say is we are a neutral player, we are neutrally positioned, we aggregate, and we have a neutral smart order routing. We don't favor any liquidity source over the other, and we let the market become better and better and better and better. And that's what we are trying to do. And that's also the argument for Robinhood to work with us. Because think from a client perspective, a Robinhood, they're like, we have these 50 projects reaching out to us and they all claim to be the best. We should probably also, we don't want to rely on one player, let's start aggregating all of them. Let's only implement more liquidity sources.
00:38:51.120 - 00:39:14.426, Speaker A: Then they realize, oh, this is exhausting. And then the same thinking is happening at Metamask, and the same thinking is happening at, I don't know, ledger when they provide a sopping for the hardware wallet. Right. So they work with us because it makes sense for them. We don't need to reinvent the wheel. We take care of that. We promise to be the neutral player, and that's how we get these clients to work with us.
00:39:14.618 - 00:39:21.930, Speaker C: For all the bigger assets that you can trade, wouldn't it be more liquidity efficient? I don't know.
00:39:21.970 - 00:39:22.682, Speaker B: This is.
00:39:22.826 - 00:39:38.960, Speaker C: Maybe you guys did a study on this. Wouldn't it be always be more efficient through a centralized exchange? And do you notice that if people use your systems, they are specifically, they specifically want a decentralized liquidity flow.
00:39:40.060 - 00:40:09.702, Speaker A: The client generally doesn't care. But centralized exchange, yeah, there are, there's less slippage, but there's also higher fee, higher fees so often. And then, and then also it's especially in the DeFi base. Sandals exchanges are fairly limited in the amount of asset based report. We are talking about hundred thousand of assets in DeFi versus no. And then you just want to trade that shit coin that just was released yesterday. You want access to that that's not listed on Robin Hood.
00:40:09.702 - 00:40:27.260, Speaker A: So you have to plug into decentralized security. Right. And you know, these things grow word of mouth. So now Robinhood is also incentivized to tap into these central security because they want that. If their friend tells them to buy bonk, they want to have the next. They buy even immediately, because they know times, crucially.
00:40:29.680 - 00:40:33.472, Speaker C: What percentage of your guys volume is decentralized?
00:40:33.536 - 00:40:36.512, Speaker A: 100%. We don't tap into decentralized security, not.
00:40:36.576 - 00:40:40.000, Speaker C: Now, because the solvers will automatically sometimes step into.
00:40:40.040 - 00:41:16.440, Speaker A: Sometimes solvers do a bit rash, but we have no insight into that. Yeah, it's just that we know that they are doing that, but we don't know what they're doing in the back end because it's talking to a centralized API. It's not visible on chain. It's just very interesting. This market is so complex for that one simple thing of trading. Just interesting to see. But I find that exciting is to know the underlying complexity of trading within crypto.
00:41:16.440 - 00:41:26.000, Speaker A: And for most people, it's a black box. And it's just an endless amount of opportunity to capture value, optimize, improve, and get better.
00:41:29.060 - 00:41:39.850, Speaker B: Do you have like an asset white listing process or any asset that's available in crypto, whatever the liquidity is coming in. So do you have an asset listing process like whitelisting or something?
00:41:40.430 - 00:42:01.700, Speaker A: We automatically inherit anything that's listed on any December's exchange. If it's a new pool that hasn't been picked up yet by Dex aggregator, you can simply enter the token address directly on jumper dot exchange, for example. And we also have like a token list on GitHub. You can simply send a pull request and we automatically added to our system.
00:42:02.920 - 00:42:12.640, Speaker B: So there is no criteria, let's say in case of trust wallet, right. You have to sort of have some sort of liquidity. So you don't have any sort of.
00:42:12.760 - 00:42:44.310, Speaker A: No, there's no process around. This is really fancy. Obviously we are permissionless in that sense that we allow to trade anything that's designed to change. The user has their own research in terms of which as it is safe to trade and what's not, there's no way to control this. We already plug into APIs like go plus security that give us an indicator whether a certain asset is scammy or not. And so we outsource that part to a service provider. That's all we can do.
00:42:44.310 - 00:42:55.240, Speaker A: Cool. Any other question? All right guys, thank you so much.
00:42:55.540 - 00:42:57.196, Speaker C: Thank you for your presentation. Thank you.
00:42:57.268 - 00:43:30.520, Speaker A: Of course, yeah. If you want to reach out in any way, talk about it, you can also reach me. Do I have a slide on how to contact me? Yeah, via telegram. Lip center if you have any questions or via email. Yeah, we do share lots of that knowledge on our blog as well, so feel free to read up on that. Ping me at any time and happy to chat. Also around certain assets we understand, we know which of these bigger budgets are liquid and we have good insights on what's coming.
