00:00:02.400 - 00:00:11.130, Speaker A: Slides are going to be semi related to the point of the talk, so you don't like need to look at them, but it might help.
00:00:12.790 - 00:00:13.610, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:00:16.270 - 00:01:05.880, Speaker A: Shared security, we talked about it a lot for the last couple of hours, I think. But the goal is, as I told you on a panel, is for to reduce the amount of wasted time and effort and to optimize for the innovation, to make it safer and to make it more efficient. The same example, the example that I use is usually you can start faster, you can get a stake, you can get stake of stable tokens, you can use it for economic security, you can get the best operator set for your use case because for core processor it's one thing for Oracles, is the other four l one s or l two s completely different as well.
00:01:07.420 - 00:01:07.756, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:01:07.788 - 00:02:43.460, Speaker A: And you get it in a month, hopefully, or in a week, not in 16 months or like 20 months, something like that. And after that you can phase in your token, you might want to switch to not switch, but phase in the token and use your own token if you ever have one, to create the basis for economic security as well. So just imagine every protocol, every network, when it decentralizes, it's ten months earlier and they can start testing their traction. So like how do you actually deliver that? Because like, yeah, restaking is easy, right? You just pump your expectations of the market and you get billions of dollars of stake. Okay, yeah, that can be done, but like you need to pay for it, that's the hard part because you can get 20 billion, 40 billion, 50 billion, and like who would pay for that? You need an actual inflow of fees for the networks you've helped. And for that you need to onboard a lot of them, the good ones, the bad ones, the middle ones. And how do you onboard a lot? You need a sophisticated framework, better competing frameworks that are going to be optimizing each other, shit talking each other and really having a great time competing for the networks.
00:02:43.460 - 00:03:10.780, Speaker A: And again, who pay for that? Who will actually pay for that? The networks. Right. But how do you get the networks? We need hundreds if not thousands of networks and the good ones as well, like every type of them. Because if you only do roll ups, you're going to be great for launching rollups. If you only do oracles, you're going to be great for launching oracles. Same goes over and over again.
00:03:11.210 - 00:03:11.610, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:03:11.650 - 00:03:20.710, Speaker A: How do you attract, how do you get the money that's like to pay for the party? You can like pump up the points or tokens or something like that, but that's not sustainable.
00:03:25.490 - 00:03:26.082, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:03:26.186 - 00:04:01.830, Speaker A: First you need for your contracts to be immutable because like, if they're not, there's this, like we've been there before. You pump up the protocol, you give them power. They are your best friends and they're neutral and then they change and they try to utilize their position as a market leader to make networks do stuff for them. Right. It might be angel investing, it might be like other stuff. There's a lot of things to be done. This is like for tier two and tier three.
00:04:01.830 - 00:04:03.218, Speaker A: For tier one.
00:04:03.314 - 00:04:03.826, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:04:03.938 - 00:04:43.184, Speaker A: They're not going to use you like, at all because like if you have a multisig or you have like even the dao, it's a risk for them. They have like big security teams that are doing the analysis of risks. And if they have misaligned DAO that they don't control, upgrading their contracts, that control their consensus. Yeah. That will never pass. So you need to be immutable ten times harder. Like if you developed contracts, immutable contracts ever, it's ten times as hard as developing the upgradeable ones because they can't be really complicated otherwise.
00:04:43.184 - 00:05:23.710, Speaker A: You're hardwired in the behavior while creating an industry that doesn't make any sense. You're limiting yourself a lot. So they need to be flexible, they need to be really strong, but they need to create an abstraction layer strong enough, inflexible enough so you can accommodate cases that come to you after that. And you don't upgrade to v two between in like two months. So this is the first important part. Otherwise you won't get all of the networks, you'll get only the portion of it. So we are already filtering the second one.
00:05:23.750 - 00:05:26.910, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:05:26.950 - 00:06:02.632, Speaker A: Like you, I talked about that. You need to, you need to enable people do enable people to do what they want. So if they don't want to use Ethereum, like, again, like case, uniswap, arbitrum, optimism maker, something like that. In a, if they don't want to use Ethereum, they need to have a point, they need to have ability to do so. They already have their own good teams, developer teams working on that. They can create a restaken protocol for themselves. For their own token.
00:06:02.632 - 00:06:38.216, Speaker A: It's going to be fine. You need to create, but again, they're not going to be creating a framework and that's what we need. So we need to accommodate them and we need to make this protocol really useful for them and for exactly their use case. Okay, so you need any token. Our protocol has a collateral abstraction that basically enables you to use any token on almost any chain. You don't even have to transport it to Ethereum. So the alignment opportunities are infinite.
00:06:38.216 - 00:07:27.130, Speaker A: You just need to have it something somewhere. And being able to reliably prove that you have this assets there and that it can be slashed within the slashable window. If you can prove that great networks are okay accepting that, we accept that as well. So, yeah, yeah, I touched on this point like a few minutes ago. But yeah, you need to be neutral. Like, if you want to be big, if you want to get to the point where you actually have an inflow of networks significant enough for somebody to build competing frameworks of scoring and onboarding and to pay for that as well. You need a lot of networks and for that you need to be neutral.
00:07:27.130 - 00:07:52.160, Speaker A: You can't ever let show the networks that you might be a competitor. That's the important part. If they ever have, like somewhere in their mind that at some point in the future you can launch your own roll up, you can launch your own Oracle, you can launch your own data availability solution that's going to be competing with their actual clients.
00:07:52.940 - 00:07:53.812, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:07:53.996 - 00:08:24.930, Speaker A: Why would they help you? Why would they use you? Because like at some point you can be Amazon basics. You like something, you copy it, you brand it on your site, it's bad because again, tier one s are not gonna launch on you. They don't trust you when you do that. Tier two and tier three are apprehensive. You need to avoid that at all cost. You need to be as neutral as possible, as unopinionated as possible. Your role is infrastructure.
00:08:24.930 - 00:08:48.180, Speaker A: You don't have opinion. You do what you're told and you do it in a reliable manner. Road like, if you go, like if you get in your car and use the road, wouldn't ask you like, your makeup looks like something like, have you, have you like, are you okay? No, you just like, go, go on the road. Everything's great if the road is great.
00:08:48.260 - 00:08:48.924, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:08:49.092 - 00:09:18.580, Speaker A: So, yeah. Network builders need flexibility. Yeah, that's the important part. You can create a really complex systems, like intra subjective stuff and like prediction markets or like some committee that's centralized. It doesn't matter. One is like super vague, the other one is like really stupid and basic. It doesn't matter.
00:09:18.580 - 00:09:51.950, Speaker A: You need to have all of them because otherwise what, you don't get money. Networks don't like most of the networks. They don't need to rewrite their own system and they reverse their plans and redevelop the slashing to accommodate the two solutions you presented, they need to be able to use any of them. Quorum fraud proof based, ZK based, I don't know, like even the random ones.
00:09:52.110 - 00:09:52.614, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:09:52.702 - 00:09:54.410, Speaker A: Like for some dj and stuff.
00:09:55.550 - 00:09:55.902, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:09:55.926 - 00:10:00.530, Speaker A: You just need to be able to enforce that.
00:10:02.390 - 00:10:02.742, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:10:02.766 - 00:10:30.760, Speaker A: So like flexibility, don't we have multiple protocols working on resolvers, which is like the arbitration layer resolvers for slashing because we already have that. Like we use fraud proofs for to get out of the L2s. We have ZK proofs, we have committee proofs. We had oracles for a really long time with different quorum systems and everything like that. We just incorporate that.
00:10:33.500 - 00:10:34.240, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:10:36.980 - 00:11:06.090, Speaker A: Alignments. Yeah. That's the important part. We don't have, I've talked about that, so I'm going to talk about something else. We don't need to be limiting the protocols in any way. Restaking and shared security beyond the actual UX and onboarding is a really simple primitive. We have three participants.
00:11:06.090 - 00:11:56.546, Speaker A: Like if we simplify, three participants, one is operator, one is staker, and one is network network staker and an operator. They come to the agreement network received stake with the operator that they select that opt in and with slashable conditions that they select when the agreement is reached. The role of the restaking protocol is to make sure it's followed. Everyone, like if push comes to shafts, people needs to get slashed. If operators or stakers want to get out, they'll wait for a slashable window to pass. That's it. You don't have to make them do stuff.
00:11:56.546 - 00:11:58.690, Speaker A: But when the consent is reached.
00:11:58.850 - 00:11:59.590, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:11:59.890 - 00:12:33.970, Speaker A: They'll have to follow it. The alignment I've talked about in the previous talk, but I'll reiterate, not all of the, like. The DeFi is getting really complicated. That's the whole point. They have off chain modules, they have runners, they have like keepers, networks, oracles, interop. Some like other layers. For those big players that need that, they will use their own token because like doesn't make sense.
00:12:33.970 - 00:13:16.298, Speaker A: Like I don't know, like Uni has like eight or even more like 10 billion of dollars in, in their own token circulating supply. They don't need Ethereum for that. They will be using their token to align. And if we talk about ecosystems where there's l three, multiple networks, like ecosystems of roll ups and everything like that, they want to use restaking as an alignment mechanism as well, not just pure, like, I don't care what it is, it's like stable. It's fine for me. They're not going to be using bitcoin why would they. But yeah, some bitcoins roll up might.
00:13:16.298 - 00:13:40.900, Speaker A: And again, we can help with that because we are not limiting collateral to be on Ethereum chain or even the AVM chain. Yeah, basically that's how you get money. Hopefully, that's how you get money to pay for all the experts, all the entities that we'll need to solve the problem of native launches.
