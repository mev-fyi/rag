00:00:03.160 - 00:00:26.500, Speaker A: All right, so welcome everyone to the first Celestia community call. We're really excited to have you here. We have a really awesome agenda for today. Yeah. So let's get started. The first thing we want to talk about and cover is the road to the incentivized Testnet. And in order to do that, we have Ismail, the CTO at Celestia lab, who will give an overview of the incentivized testnet.
00:00:26.500 - 00:00:35.190, Speaker A: Yeah, there you go.
00:00:36.040 - 00:00:37.540, Speaker B: Can you guys hear me well?
00:00:37.690 - 00:00:38.390, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:00:38.920 - 00:01:36.520, Speaker B: Nice. So first of all, I wanted to cover the Testnet, not the incentivized Testnet, because that's more tangible and also fairly soon. So I don't want to set a very specific date, but it's weeks, not months. So expect updates on the Testnet very soon. So just to give an overview what the Testnet is, it's basically an iteration of the current Testnet that we already have running. I mean, we have a Testnet running since I think like November last year when we had the offsite in Berlin. And that Testnet was basically meant as a first iteration and meant as a first experiment also for the team to learn how to launch a chain and for a first community to evolve around running validators and everything.
00:01:36.520 - 00:02:20.512, Speaker B: Right? But this Testnet, which is called Devnet, we did not add any features yet. We were heads down implementing features and doing bug fixes and all this. So the Testnet that we launched fairly soon will be an upgrade or the next iteration of that same devnet. It's worth saying that that Testnet will also not be incentivized. It's just a community run Testnet. So the main changes there that you can expect from the Testnet is that developers should have a slightly better time to interacting with the Testnet itself. Right? Like Yas is doing an awesome job on putting docs together.
00:02:20.512 - 00:03:17.944, Speaker B: It's still very early and it's still not the same developer friendliness that we expect for the incentivized Testnet or we expect at launch. But there's an API that the node team put together and this doc side. And my hope is that we will update the docs and the API and also tell potentially interested developers about this while the Testnet is running. And this testnet will be like, it will be updated, it won't upgrade, it won't be static as the last one. For the last one, as I said, for the Devnet, we only updated the node software once or twice. Like there were bug fixes that were fixed so it runs smoothly. But the core validator software was not updated at all because there was little features added there.
00:03:17.944 - 00:04:19.550, Speaker B: And also it was more important to get this feature in the code instead of live on that devnet. So this testnet will be different in the sense that we hope to do an upgrade or two, maybe for that purpose, to have an easier time coordinating. We'll add back the governance module, or actually we already added it back in the code, it's just not deployed yet. And we will make use of the upgrade module as well. So what kind of upgrades can you expect? Most likely we also have people from the QGB team on the call, but most likely we want to deploy the quantum gravity bridge code, the part of the state machine on that Testnet once it's ready and before the incentivized Testnet. Most likely what you can expect from that is that you have this one way bridge to Ethereum. Maybe we'll talk a little bit later about big quantum, very good bridge and what it is and what it does in more detail.
00:04:19.550 - 00:05:16.620, Speaker B: But roughly it's a one way bridge to Ethereum such that Ethereum rollups can use Celestia as a data availability layer instead of what currently most these chains do is like. They do use a closed set of data availability committee. So expect that to be deployed on Testnet as well as smart contracts on some Ethereum Testnet. Also we might upgrade to new tenement and SDK versions as they mature and bug fixes for instance. Currently we are working towards upgrading to Tenement 00:35 and the Cosmos SDK 46, which isn't fully released, it's just a beta release. We will work towards that, depending if you're ready at the launch of Testnet or afterwards. Depends.
00:05:16.620 - 00:06:09.192, Speaker B: We might upgrade or we might upgrade to patch releases of that. And also the node software can be upgraded fairly easy. We expect there will be a fair chunks of bug fixes as well. Another change to the last devnet is that we will increase the validator set to 150 active validator slots. Last time, as I said, the devnet was mostly an internal exercise that turned into a public testnet, and that public testnet gained a lot of traction. Right. There was the 100 active validator slots that we had, which is the default in the customs SDK very quickly filled up after we announced that it is public now and we have thousands.
00:06:09.192 - 00:07:07.730, Speaker B: I don't know how many it is now, but last time I checked we had like over 2500 inactive validators, so it gained a lot of traction. So that's why we anticipate to increase the validator slots a bit. We will coordinate to a few validators from the Devnet to be part of the Genesis ceremony and expect probably we'll have a faucet as well at last time to fill up the remaining validator slots. To summarize again, it's not an incentivized testnet, but it's the next iteration of our devnet. Expect some upgrades and expect it to be a bit more developer friendly. The next iteration after that will be the incentivized Testnet. The timeline for that is a bit more later this year, I guess like Q four this year, roughly expected by mid end of Q four.
00:07:07.730 - 00:07:59.060, Speaker B: We'll announce that ahead of time, but our current focus will be launching that Testnet. It will be in a few weeks from now. Well, for the incentivized testnet you can expect relatively straightforward regular tasks that you expect from any incentivized testnet. And validators will be incentivized, obviously. But additionally to that, we also will want to incentivize running light nodes and celestia full storage nodes. And maybe you can expect some attacks that are specific to the celestia data availability layer. Most likely will be like a dashboard and a leaderboard according to different phases that the incentivized testnet will entail.
00:07:59.060 - 00:09:16.924, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's all I wanted to say about the incentivized Testnet and the Testnet. I can also summarize a little bit on the engineering efforts, but if team members from the different teams are present, I'd like to add to this as they want. So I think the main changes in core and app is that we adopted a subset of ABCI. This might I don't know how familiar people are on this call with like tendermint and ABcI, but basically what we needed was a method to malleat the transactions from the mempool before a block is proposed. We had that functionality long before ABCIF started to be worked on in tendermint, but what we didn't have was a second method. That is, after the proposal, like after the proposer proposes a block, all the other validators need to check on that block and basically repeat that malleation and check if it's valid in that sense. And we started doing this on our own.
00:09:16.924 - 00:10:09.064, Speaker B: But then the tenement team also picked up working on ABCI Plus plus, so they added a second method. And basically what we did is removed our own thing and adopted the first phase. And the second phase, prepare proposal and process proposal for the ones familiar with ABC Plus plus these are the methods that we adopted. And there was like a lot of smaller bug fixes and a lot of improvements. There was a token denomination bug. I think that if Evan is on the call, if you want to add something, please do. But I think most of the things are a bit too detailed or too technical, most likely.
00:10:09.064 - 00:10:10.030, Speaker B: I don't know.
00:10:11.280 - 00:10:13.420, Speaker C: I think you covered everything perfectly.
00:10:14.240 - 00:11:05.808, Speaker B: Okay, thanks for the node software. The celestial node software, just to explain briefly, that's the software that actually serves data availability sampling requests and where you perform data availability sampling on. We use tenement for the consensus, but we also use a separate, almost separate peer to peer layer that is based on the p two p and bitswap where you perform data availability sampling. And there's a bridge node that bridges between both worlds essentially, or both peer to peer networks. So there again, a lot of bug fixes, optimizations. One thing that didn't work during Devnet was the sampling for past headers only for current headers. But this has been fixed and since a while now.
00:11:05.808 - 00:11:57.680, Speaker B: I think a big feature that we added is bad encoding fraud proofs only recently. So that's a fraud proof type that enables basically light nodes not to trust the majority of validators to do the erasure coding correctly. This is important for rollups such that roll ups build on top of Celestia. Do not have to trust the validator set for that property. Also, there's like a public API now in the node software. It's slowly coming together. It's not final yet, but we have like a very first version of that where celestial node will more and more become the entry point for developers to use to build roll ups on top and everything.
00:11:57.680 - 00:12:17.590, Speaker B: Currently how it's done is you use a mix of interacting with the core and app software, and then you also interact with something called bulk, but moving forward and more and more during the testnet, you'll just interact with the note software. Anyone wants to add something from the note team?
00:12:20.280 - 00:12:23.496, Speaker A: Let me unmute the note team in case they want to.
00:12:23.518 - 00:12:26.472, Speaker B: I mean, they can raise their hand as please.
00:12:26.526 - 00:12:29.850, Speaker A: Yeah, please raise your hand if you want to speak so we can unmute you.
00:12:32.140 - 00:12:39.420, Speaker B: Okay. Doesn't look like it. Okay, how do I raise my hand? Just unmute. Renee.
00:12:40.320 - 00:12:50.190, Speaker A: I'll find Renee. Let me. Renee. Hello. Hey.
00:12:55.280 - 00:13:20.760, Speaker D: Yeah, so with the recent updates, you'll be able to use celestial node directly. You don't need to use Dalc anymore because you can submit pay for data messages via celestial node very easily. And you can also retrieve shares by namespace. So you won't need Dalc anymore. You'll just interact directly with the node.
00:13:21.500 - 00:13:28.990, Speaker B: Yeah, basically what I said. More and more, the celestial node software will be the single entry point for developers to use.
00:13:31.040 - 00:13:42.530, Speaker D: It'll be refactored a lot in the next coming months. How we will do it specifically. But for now we have an RPC endpoint that should make it quite easy.
00:13:43.860 - 00:14:07.290, Speaker B: Yeah, it's pretty cool. I hope we'll see some of the interested developers to start playing around with the node software during this testnet. A lot of stuff also happened around, not directly in the core software, but in the quantum gravity bridge. Evan, do you want to speak to this?
00:14:13.420 - 00:14:46.630, Speaker C: Yeah, I can. So with the quantum gravity bridge, it's basically a light client relay to Ethereum, and we've made a lot of progress over designing it and kind of iterating over that design. I think it's about it. I think we're aiming to upgrade, like Ismail said earlier, we're aiming for it to be one of the upgrades for Testnet, and that should be a lot of fun.
00:14:48.040 - 00:15:30.530, Speaker B: Yeah. So there's components to the state machine that will be part of that upgrade, and then, as I said, will also be smart contracts that will be deployed on some Ethereum testnet. And a lot of things also happened around another component, which is like the optimist or execution environment team we have internally. They're working heavily towards state fraud proofs for the Cosmos SDK with a focus on Ethermin, so to say. If Josh is on the call, I want to speak to this, but I can only summarize that there's like a lot of design documents and we expect.
00:15:31.860 - 00:15:35.708, Speaker A: Sorry, Josh is here. There he is.
00:15:35.734 - 00:15:37.670, Speaker B: Yeah, let him speak if you want.
00:15:38.360 - 00:15:39.510, Speaker E: Is this working?
00:15:40.200 - 00:15:40.516, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:15:40.538 - 00:16:16.416, Speaker E: So not to cover too much here, but we're working on essentially a sequencer component. So optimate. And this is essentially just a first implementation of a client to talk to Celestia and how you would then build these rollups on top of Celestia, the concept of a sovereign roll up. So we're making good progress there. We've integrated that with Ethermint, and so we actually do have some examples of you can deploy a basic Ethereum smart contract and it pushes the blocks all the way down. We're still pretty early stage on this, and we started properly working on getting fraud proofs implemented in the Cosmos SDK, but not a lot to cover right now, hopefully more in the next month or so.
00:16:16.598 - 00:16:19.570, Speaker A: All right, well, thank you. Yeah, thanks.
00:16:19.940 - 00:16:25.476, Speaker B: I think that's from my side. I think we took a lot of time.
00:16:25.658 - 00:16:42.232, Speaker A: No, that was really great. It's a lot of exciting development happening, and everyone should stay tuned as we get closer to both the public testnet and the incentivized testnet. Next up. Yeah, thanks for smile. Thank you to the engineering team. Next up, we want to do.
00:16:42.286 - 00:16:43.528, Speaker B: Stay around for questions.
00:16:43.694 - 00:16:58.860, Speaker A: Yeah, please. Next up, we want to do a recap of the modular summit. And on the call we have Aditi, who did a phenomenal job on one of the best summits I've ever seen, both in crypto and outside of crypto. And let's unmute. Aditu.
00:17:01.620 - 00:17:02.752, Speaker F: Can you hear me?
00:17:02.886 - 00:17:04.256, Speaker A: Yeah. Cool.
00:17:04.358 - 00:17:57.372, Speaker F: Okay, I'll keep this quick. And thanks for the intro, yaz. As a lot of you are aware, the modular summit took place on April 21 in Amsterdam during Devconnect. The event was the blueprinting of the next generation of blockchains, where we embraced modularity and were able to hear from a variety of teams, including roll up teams, bridges l ones, and more. We had over 600 attendees in person. We heard from Mustafa al Basam, Zakimanian Uri Kaladny, Eric Wall, Tarun Chitra, Anatolia Yakovenko, and many others, including our community members and researchers, who are able to present as well. We covered a bunch of topics, including defining the modular layers, l ones l two s, l three s mev on modular blockchains, the data availability landscape, and of course, monolithic versus modular.
00:17:57.372 - 00:18:17.610, Speaker F: All talks are available on our YouTube channel. The link is here. Yeah, and that's basically it for the summit updates. I'm sure a lot of you were able to catch it either in person or via the live stream, but if you didn't check it out, I highly urge you to do so because the content was great.
00:18:19.660 - 00:18:47.456, Speaker A: Well, thank you, Aditi. Yeah, it's like a lot of great content. It was great venue and everything. And I look forward to the next one. Now we want to take it to community questions. So now is your opportunity to ask to Celeste, your team, anything in order to do that, because everyone's muted, because we have a lot of people on the call. You just have to raise your hand and we'll unmute you.
00:18:47.456 - 00:19:05.530, Speaker A: Or you can ask a question in the chat. And it looks like we already have a question in the chat. How long will the devnet process take, and what are your plans for the next phase? Who wants to take that question? Ismayo, I'll unmute you.
00:19:08.140 - 00:19:09.960, Speaker B: Sorry, can you repeat the question?
00:19:10.110 - 00:19:25.580, Speaker A: Yeah, the question in the chat is, how long will the devnet process takenet or the devnet. I'm not sure if you're talking about the devnet or the testnet, but in the chat, it specifically says Devnet.
00:19:26.240 - 00:19:48.660, Speaker B: Yeah, well, I guess as we think of the Testnet as the next iteration of the devnet, the testnet will last at least a few months till most likely till the incentivized testnet, which will be, as I said, end of Q four or something. So it will be a long running test net with multiple iterations.
00:19:50.120 - 00:20:07.660, Speaker A: Sounds good. So before we also tackle the rest of the chat question, there's also been questions on the agenda in the GitHub ticket, so I'm just going to read them out for the team. What stage of development are we of the quantum gravity bridge?
00:20:10.000 - 00:20:12.430, Speaker B: I think Evan wanted to answer this.
00:20:12.800 - 00:20:18.188, Speaker A: Yeah. All right, Evan, now you should be. Yeah, yeah.
00:20:18.274 - 00:21:18.610, Speaker C: So, with the QGB, the current stage of development is that we have like, a very hacky working version, but we're very quickly iterating to make it a lot less hacky and a lot more useful. One of the things that we added recently was we added a subcommand in the Celestia app to launch the contracts yourself. So if you wanted to, you can launch the contracts to any EVM platform and relay yourself if you feel like doing that. But there's still, like, to finish answering the question. I think we kind of mentioned this on the call a few times, but we're aiming to be an upgrade for Testnet, so we're aiming for the finished, useful version to be finished probably in like a month, maybe a month and a half. But that's like very rough goals, but, yeah.
00:21:19.940 - 00:21:37.400, Speaker A: Thank you, Evan. The other question is, how's the Sevmo settlement layer development going? Maybe Josh can answer that. Or, Josh, can you raise your hand? All right, yeah, you should be on mute.
00:21:37.900 - 00:22:26.570, Speaker E: Okay, so it's going pretty well. We have at least an initial example of this working at a minimal. You can deploy an EVM contract using hard hat or foundry to the EVM. It's not full compatibility. There's some things in the EVM that are meant to include, like test calls, but generally we are seeing blocks be able to be submitted on the southmost layer and pushed all the way down to Celestia with communication coming back up. So that's where we're at. We'll certainly have something deployed, I think, on this next Devnet testnet, which you want to call it, but for right now, it's going to be like centralized sequencers for this, but there should be something that'll be usable for people to at least deploy EVM contracts on it.
00:22:27.980 - 00:22:56.140, Speaker A: Thank you, Josh. The other question is, has Celestia received any response from teams planning or considering to build sovereign rollups on Celestia? Who wants to take that one? Please raise your hand. Anybody? Did we get any would be best? Yeah, let me best.
00:22:56.590 - 00:22:57.980, Speaker B: Or yourself maybe.
00:23:00.190 - 00:23:03.726, Speaker A: All right, I'm asking. Aditi, unmute. Yeah. All right.
00:23:03.748 - 00:23:05.360, Speaker F: Yaz, can you repeat the question?
00:23:06.930 - 00:23:19.840, Speaker A: Did the Celestia team get any responses or interests from teams who are planning to build sovereign roll ups on top of Celestia? Yeah.
00:23:22.630 - 00:23:54.090, Speaker F: Thank you. Okay, cool. Yes, we did, actually. Josh is also part of this effort and fields a lot of these questions. We do get a lot of interest and actively work closely with teams that express that kind of interest to answer questions and offer advice on how to structure their stack. And so if you do have such questions or you know of teams that are interested, please feel free to intro them to us, either via discord or our Twitter accounts.
00:23:55.470 - 00:24:39.580, Speaker A: Thank you, Aditi. All right, so we're going to go through the rest of the questions that are from the chat. So one question is, will Americans be allowed to participate in the incentivized testnet? So currently, we're still determining how to structure the incentivized testnet and who will be able to participate, and we'll be able to update the community as we get closer to launch. Next question is, can multiple EVM bridges be used for a testnet? I mean, yeah, technically. Ismail, you want to take that.
00:24:41.950 - 00:25:17.670, Speaker B: Mean? Theoretically, yes. What we will deploy on the testnet, as I said, is most likely only the QGB, which is like a one way bridge, and probably not what the person who asked meant by this. I am honestly not sure that I don't think we should on Testnet, and maybe not even on main net, should deploy, like a proper two way bridge from and to the main chain, and instead use bridges from chains.
00:25:20.490 - 00:25:21.058, Speaker A: Either like.
00:25:21.084 - 00:26:11.240, Speaker B: Custodial bridges or rather bridges on chains that we have an IBC connection to. Like, for instance, osmosis will have not EVM bridges like bridges to Ethereum and, yeah, roughly, you could call these EVM bridges if you want to, but we will rather leverage these bridges with one hop through osmosis, right? Or maybe the cosmos hub or other cosmos zones, so to say. But it won't be. Theoretically, yes, you could use whatever bridge is there, but we won't deploy any state machine logic directly on the main chain because we want to keep it as minimal as possible. And the QGB is like relatively lightweight. Does that answer the question?
00:26:12.170 - 00:27:21.070, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it answered the question. Thank you so much, Ismail. All right, the next question is, what will determine eligibility for the incentivized testnet? I think it depends on how do you want to participate in the incentivized testnet. If you want to participate as a validator, there will be a form that you would have to fill out like an intake form to see have you validated in the past and stuff in order to be eligible. But there's also going to be applications if you want to become just a regular node operator, like running a light node, a bridge node, a full node, and also if you want to be a builder, like if you want to build your own roll up on top of the incentivized testnet, or you want to deploy your app specific chain, you're also enabled to do that within the incentivized testnet as well. And then let's move on to the next question. What can we expect from the testnet launch? Is there a focus on network stability or can we already expect building DAC functionality? I'm not sure if it's specifically about the public testnet or for the incentivized testnet.
00:27:21.070 - 00:27:24.974, Speaker A: Ismail, do you want to answer that one?
00:27:25.172 - 00:28:15.280, Speaker B: Sure. As I said, I think in the intro you will be able, even on the public testnet, not the incentivized testnet, you will be able to experiment and play around and build dapps to some extent. The developer experience certainly will be more nicer or developer friendlier on the incentivized testnet. So yes, in both cases you will be able, but it will be more ready. The software and the documentation will be more ready during the incentivized testnet. But if you want to play around with it already, we encourage you highly to try it out during the testnet already, which will be, as I said, like a few weeks from now.
00:28:16.790 - 00:29:39.180, Speaker A: Thank you. Ismail, what's the next question? Okay, so here's a question. In light of Celestia's unique modular approach, what are few main use cases for Celestia? I think that's an open question for everyone on the team. Please raise your hand if you want to answer that question. So I think like, I mean, I can happily answer what a few main use cases. So you can think about Celestia, your data availability layer. So if you want to deploy scalable roll ups that either rely on a settlement layer or your own sovereign roll up, Celestia provides that data availability layer that allows you to scale over time at the block size increases, and that way you can keep transaction costs low over time, and you can then deploy an app specific chain or like a generic roll up that settled on either Ethereum or sepmos or any other settlement layer that you'd like it to settle on.
00:29:39.180 - 00:30:32.040, Speaker A: So I see Taha raising your hand. I'm guessing you want to ask a question. I'm just going to unmute you now so you can ask your question. Okay, we'll circle back to Taha later. So another question is, do node operators who run a bridge node have the option to participate in consensus by becoming a validator? Yes. So if you're running a bridge node, you also have the option to become a validator. At the same time, you can actually run a bridge node without participating in consensus.
00:30:32.040 - 00:31:15.910, Speaker A: And you can currently try to do that within Devnet for the upcoming public testnet and participating. And the incentivized testnet where you run a bridge node and allow you to participate in consensus. Obviously there's also this part about using a faucet on Devnet to delegate and then become a validator and participate in consensus. Okay, so here's an interesting one. What are the biggest challenges you're solving right now, and how can the validator community help over the next few months with those challenges? Maybe Ismail or Mustafa want to answer this.
00:31:19.400 - 00:33:04.408, Speaker B: I'd say the most challenging part is still always the networking layer. All the peer to peer stuff is just hard. But it's not that we try to. I think we solve this and we have an architecture that works, but there's a lot of improvements that can be made and a lot of, especially in terms of data storage, we could optimize this a lot in general. Let me think, what are the biggest challenges? Honestly? I think documenting, like coming up with proper APIs and documenting those to attract developers and to make it easier for developers to onboard themselves, I think is one of the more urgent challenges. Thinking about the validator community, I am not sure. I think what you can do is just like for the validator community, if there's any dashboards that you could think of for the celestia node software, or dashboards for the core software itself is like basically Cosmos SDK chains, right? If you can think of combining these both worlds somehow, or coming up with ideas, how to measure, not to measure, how to visualize the other peer to peer network in some way or the other, I think that would be cool.
00:33:04.408 - 00:33:15.870, Speaker B: But it's purely optional. It's not one of the biggest. It won't contribute to the big challenges we have, because they are mostly, I think, engineering challenges, I'd say, but it would still be very cool.
00:33:18.000 - 00:33:22.990, Speaker A: Thanks, Ismail. I think also you raise your hand, you want to answer as well.
00:33:28.670 - 00:33:31.470, Speaker B: Glib also mentioned something in the chat, I think.
00:33:31.620 - 00:33:35.454, Speaker A: Yeah, go for it.
00:33:35.492 - 00:34:26.826, Speaker G: Okay, so, yeah, Ishmael mentions the complexity and the challenges on a PDP network. And I can elaborate here, because that's backbone of all the things we are building data ability layer with all those datability samplings, which are solely based on PDP network. And one of the biggest complex cases that we are trying to achieve and test is ability for full nodes to reconstruct data from subsets of light nodes. You can think of several full nodes. Each of them have their own subnetwork, light nodes. And all of them cannot reconstruct the block with their own subnetworks. But if they connect to each other, they can collectively reconstruct the block from all the light nodes.
00:34:26.826 - 00:34:37.890, Speaker G: And such cases and such limitations are pretty challenging to do. And this is what we are working on right now to answer the question about the challenges.
00:34:38.230 - 00:34:44.930, Speaker A: Thank you. I think also Josh wants to answer the question. I'm going to unmute you, Josh.
00:34:47.590 - 00:34:54.150, Speaker E: Sorry. So I wasn't specifically trying to answer the question. I just wanted to tackle some of the questions on, like, roll ups and what we mean when we say roll.
00:34:56.490 - 00:34:56.758, Speaker A: Of.
00:34:56.764 - 00:35:00.806, Speaker E: There's kind of a layered approach here. Right. If you're familiar with the celestia concept or not.
00:35:00.828 - 00:35:00.978, Speaker B: Right.
00:35:01.004 - 00:35:43.506, Speaker E: Celestia is just providing this data availability layer. And as Ismail mentioned, we're not going to have kind of a state function in the celestia base layer. So the celestia ledger can be thought of as like a dirty ledger, where it's just a list of kind of undecoded transactions, just blobs of bytes. So you actually need a roll up to interpret those bytes and kind of give them state transition functions. And this is very similar to what you see roll ups doing on top of Ethereum, where they're using Ethereum as call data. And so for this to actually make Celestia super usable, you need to have this other chain on top to actually interpret the data you're writing to Celestia. So that's what we mean when we say roll ups.
00:35:43.506 - 00:36:23.410, Speaker E: Some interesting options that Celestia gives in this kind of sovereign roll up space is that you can have this reliance on consensus and ordering of blocks on the base layer, the celestial layer, and that allows you to have these trust minimized light clients where you can have light clients that approach, essentially the full security of a full node because they're guaranteed to be able to access blocks when they need it on the base layer. And so you can implement fraud proofs on a layer above Celestia while having data availability guarantees by the base layer. I'm happy to take any other kind of more specific questions on this, or feel free to kind of ping me. Aditi, I think, put my Twitter link somewhere in the chat.
00:36:24.170 - 00:37:07.316, Speaker A: Yes, please. The next question is, what about an ambassador program? So the good news is we're currently scoping an ambassador program with our community managers. It's still the early stage, but we're trying to design it, and we'll have more updates on an ambassador program in the next few weeks, hopefully. The other question, maybe, Josh, if you want to answer it, how do you keep the ledger small enough to be able to run Celestia on a mobile phone when all transactions will be accepted, like, valid and. Oh, let me unmute you, Josh. Sorry. So I probably actually want to punt.
00:37:07.348 - 00:37:16.324, Speaker E: This to Halib or Renee on this, but if you want to run. Right, that's probably the celestial node team, right?
00:37:16.462 - 00:37:19.912, Speaker A: Yeah. Let me get Mustafa unmuted.
00:37:19.976 - 00:37:22.892, Speaker H: Yeah, sorry. Hello, could you hear me?
00:37:23.026 - 00:37:23.804, Speaker A: Yes.
00:37:24.002 - 00:37:26.188, Speaker H: Sorry. Can you quickly repeat that question?
00:37:26.354 - 00:37:38.640, Speaker A: Yeah. So the question is, how do you keep the ledger small enough to be able to run Celestia on a mobile phone when all the transactions will be accepted, whether they're valid or invalid?
00:37:40.820 - 00:37:53.430, Speaker H: Well, I mean, that client doesn't process the state of the process. It just downloads the headers. So it doesn't store any state at all.
00:37:55.560 - 00:38:37.220, Speaker A: Thank you, Ms. Supper. That answered the question. Let's see, what's the other question? Okay. Are there any plans for research calls, either in the style of Vegas fortnightly office hours, or celestia advocate talks at the research track at the modular summit? I mean, I could answer it to some extent for research proposals and research calls we would have within this year in rfps for any kind of proposals related to research and development. But it was still kind of early in scoping it out. But we'll have more information soon.
00:38:37.220 - 00:39:32.820, Speaker A: And if anyone else wants to talk about this, feel free to raise your hand. Otherwise, I'm going to move on to the next question. So the next question is, what are the requirements to host celestial nodes? I can answer it to some degree. In order to host a celestial node, you can host it on a bare metal. You can host it in the cloud if you want to, but it kind of centralizes the system, you can try to use it with a colocation model rather than a cloud model. If you want to do it on a data center, you can probably run nodes at home, but you would want to maintain high uptime and uninterrupted Internet bandwidth because otherwise if your Internet goes down for a little bit or your power goes out, you can get slashed. So there's different ways that you can go about it when you want to run a celestial node.
00:39:32.820 - 00:41:09.744, Speaker A: So the next question is, can testnet participant count to be included into the main. Net validator list? So the program is still being designed, but it depends on the participants performance in the incentivized test net, right? So if you're a good validator with a high uptime score and can do all the challenges in the incentivized test. Net, then obviously that kind of qualifies you better than if you're a bad validator that's getting slashed all the time on the testnet. Okay, will it be in any limitation of participants in the incentivized testnet? What can community members do now testnet for them? Isn't Daria any activities before quota for Testnet? So for the participants in the incentivized testnet, the validator set, there's a limit, but there's also a lot of options if you can't get into the validator set, like with light nodes, you can run your own light node, you can run full nodes, you can run bridge nodes. So there's other option, and there are challenges when you're running it within the testnet that you can participate in. And obviously you can also be a contributor. There's also contributor challenges like creating content, creating documentation, supporting your fellow community members during the incentivized testnet.
00:41:09.744 - 00:42:03.350, Speaker A: And what kind of things you can do before incentivized Testnet happen? Well, there's a public testnet that's going to be spun up soonish, and you can participate by building on top of it, like application specific projects on top of the public testnet. You can also contribute to the documentation or you can write, let's say you built your own node, you set up a celestial node on a raspberry PI or some other kind of project that you find interesting, and you can write a blog post about it. You can contribute to the code. The code is open source. There's a lot of tickets you can participate in that you can get assigned a ticket. We're always monitoring. We'd love public contributors who want to participate, and we're happy to give you issues if you want to participate in the code base as well.
00:42:03.350 - 00:42:37.090, Speaker A: So I'm going to read this question, but let me just see it. There are a lot of monolithic VC chains these days and I see many proposals being manipulated and not functioning by the early VC, especially in terms of governments. What measures select are taking to avoid being like this. I'm not really sure I understand the question. Be honest.
00:42:39.940 - 00:42:41.410, Speaker B: Let me see if there.
00:42:45.220 - 00:43:27.084, Speaker A: Is the testing going to be. So let me go to the ones on the chat because I think there's a lot of people asking in the chat, is the testnet going to be open for everyone or will be a private testnet? I think, yeah, the incentive testnet is going to be open. You can apply, there'll be a form that you can apply for and then that allows you to participate depending on what you're trying to do. So what do you. Let's see if there's any. Let's see if there are more. Okay.
00:43:27.084 - 00:43:44.696, Speaker A: Yeah. So that's the question at the end. Does anyone want to answer that? It's the latest question in the chat. Okay, Josh, I just requested that you unmute yourself. Go for it.
00:43:44.878 - 00:43:47.370, Speaker E: Sorry, can you point out the question?
00:43:48.620 - 00:43:49.930, Speaker H: The VC question?
00:43:50.540 - 00:43:52.170, Speaker E: Oh, the VC question.
00:43:53.340 - 00:43:55.336, Speaker H: I can answer that, yeah.
00:43:55.358 - 00:43:56.008, Speaker E: You want to go for it?
00:43:56.014 - 00:43:57.000, Speaker B: Mustafa.
00:44:00.860 - 00:45:14.290, Speaker H: Shall I repeat the question? It says there's a lot of monolithic VC chains and I see lots of proposals being manipulated and not functioning in terms of governance. Well, I mean, our general philosophy is we want to be a community even though we have vcs as investors, obviously. And part of the reason for that is it's not really legally possible these days to do a public ICO, and that's why early investors are needed. But we also recognize that we're trying to build a community led project, especially in terms of governance. So in terms of governance, we see governance as a kind of off chain topic rather than the on chain topic in the sense that the kind of stakeholders of the ecosystem are more than just who owns the most tokens or something like that. Rather than it being a kind of like Ethereum governance. It's not like the people who hold the most tokens in Ethereum get to decide what happens.
00:45:14.290 - 00:45:21.510, Speaker H: We want to have a similar kind of community led atmosphere here, if that makes sense.
00:45:25.480 - 00:45:55.664, Speaker A: Thank you, Mustafa. Another question is, will there be anything for atom stakers? So we're still ironing out participation criteria. We'll follow up with community as soon we have more details. There's another question. What would be the high level system requirements to participate in testnet or incentivize testnet. So the good news is we do have a documentation page that I can share with you now here on the screen. I'm hoping everyone can see the screen on the doc page.
00:45:55.664 - 00:47:08.116, Speaker A: But basically to get an idea of the highest level system requirement, we do have a hardware requirements section here that I'm going to link to you right here in the chat. So that should be able to give you an idea on the hardware requirement for participating in the test. What are the best ways to contribute? Technically? For now, you can participate in the GitHub repository by, there's a lot of open tickets that you can participate in. For some tickets that you find that are beginner friendly, just comment there and ask to be assigned. We're happy to assign it to you. We're already seeing a lot of participants contributing to pull requests, writing tickets, and yeah, like Josh is saying, good first issues tag that, you know, if you want to participate that way, and also within Devnet and soon within the public testnet, being able to build your own projects would be really cool. And by then we'll also have more documentation for how you're able to contribute and build on top of the public testnet.
00:47:08.116 - 00:47:36.530, Speaker A: And after that, the incentivized testnet. All right, wow. The question keep on coming, folks. Let's see two questions. No, it is early, but how difficult would it be for an existing off chain data availability scaling solution like Starkx validium medicine construction to switch from their internal dacs to something like Celestia? I think Josh wants to answer that one. Go for it.
00:47:37.380 - 00:48:16.892, Speaker E: Yeah, I can cover this one. And then if Evan's still on the call, he might have a little bit more to note on this, on how it relates to generally. I mean, it's kind of up to. Oh God, the question moved. It's kind of up to these roll ups on how they want to move, right. But they should theoretically, depending on their interfaces, if they just have a thing where they are essentially expecting to write data and then read data and expect kind of consensus guarantees on them, then they should be able to just integrate with Celestia's API by having a light node or a light client and then making sure the rpcs and kind of the interface connect. So technically it shouldn't be a whole lot of work.
00:48:16.892 - 00:48:30.690, Speaker E: It's obviously going to be somewhat dependent on the assumptions they've made from like a withdrawal window or a timing or when they're checking how often they're writing kind of various parameters. There but technically it's not particularly difficult, I don't think.
00:48:34.900 - 00:48:55.240, Speaker A: Um. Yeah. So what about number two? Question number two. Can you describe again how light node requirements scale with block size proportional to square root of block size? Correct. And how celestial scaled with raw number light node? I'm going to unmute you, Jean, because your hand is raised.
00:48:56.860 - 00:49:19.952, Speaker E: Yeah, so I think this is actually probably a better question for Mustafa or Aditi. You might have info on this and we might have blog posts on the site. I know you've looked into kind of the scaling question here a little bit and I think one of Mustafa's earlier papers will have kind of charts on exactly what this is looking like. D tier. Mustafa, do one of you guys want to handle this?
00:49:20.086 - 00:49:21.490, Speaker H: Which question was that?
00:49:22.500 - 00:49:32.980, Speaker E: How light node requirements scale with block size proportional to square root of the block size. How does Celestia scale with the raw number of full nodes or light nodes involved in the data availability sampling?
00:49:34.120 - 00:49:59.890, Speaker H: Yeah, light nodes scale proportional to the square root of the block size. So it's like if you have n data, you take the square root of that and that's basically how the light client requirements increase. This is about how many row and column routes are in the two dimensional data availability square.
00:50:02.340 - 00:50:09.040, Speaker A: Got it. Aditi, you wanted to answer the other question as well. Let me unmute you, Aditi.
00:50:11.060 - 00:50:47.390, Speaker F: Yeah, no, think. I think we were like the chat was moving so you probably didn't see that I raised my hand, but Josh mostly addressed the questions on the DAC point. We're actively chatting with teams like Starquare and Arbitrum and especially Starquare. We're scoping out how we can work together and plug in as a DA solution. So it is early, but those discussions are actively ongoing. And once we have a sense, we're definitely going to put out documentation about it as well as Devrel guides on how to do this.
00:50:48.900 - 00:51:00.610, Speaker A: Okay, Evan, you're raising your hand. I'm going to mute you. But just to keep in mind, we're four minutes before the call ends, so whatever, just go for it.
00:51:01.140 - 00:51:20.344, Speaker C: Okay, I was just going to clarify that there's only one function to interact with for the QGB contracts. So if you wanted to switch from a DAC to using the QGB, there's basically one function and you just ask it, is this data actually part of the commitment that the celestial validator is committed to?
00:51:20.462 - 00:51:21.096, Speaker B: And that's it.
00:51:21.118 - 00:51:24.756, Speaker C: So however you incorporate that into your contracts, it'll vary depending on the roll.
00:51:24.788 - 00:51:25.850, Speaker B: Up, but that's it.
00:51:27.260 - 00:52:02.004, Speaker A: All right, well, thank you yeah, folks. So we're nearing the four minute mark before the call ends, and we had an amazing turnout today. Like 100 people were waiting. I think what it taught us is for the next community call, we're going to increase the limit. We had no idea it's going to be dispatched, but we love to seeing how excited everyone is about the first call. A lot of amazing questions being asked. We're going to have a lot more updates for everyone as we get closer to the public testnet and after that to the incentivized testnet on the road to mainnet after that.
00:52:02.004 - 00:52:35.372, Speaker A: And so, yeah, always stay on the lookout for more Celeste community calls. Be sure to join our discord. Be sure to follow us on Twitter, ask as many questions. And we have the GitHub repo, which has all the different agendas for the future community calls. We're going to have a lot more information moving forward. And, yeah, we want to thank you all for attending. This has been really exciting, and I'm happy that everyone's super excited about Celestia.
00:52:35.372 - 00:52:51.390, Speaker A: I want to thank the Celestia core team, our community managers, for all the help and support they provided us to make a very successful first community call. So thank you so much, everyone. All right, I'm going to stop recording right now.
