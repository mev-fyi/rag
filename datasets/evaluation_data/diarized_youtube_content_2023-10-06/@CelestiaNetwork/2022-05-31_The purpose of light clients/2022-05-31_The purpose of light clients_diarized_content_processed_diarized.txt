00:00:00.810 - 00:01:27.910, Speaker A: Light nodes effectively allow end users, ordinary users, whether a cheap laptop or mobile phone, to have almost the same level of security as a full node, because they can get assurances about the state of the blockchain using technologies like fraud proofs or Zk proofs. And this is the fundamental reason why the bitcoin community has decided not to increase the block size limit. In theory, bitcoin could do a zillion transactions per second if they increase the block size limit and optimize the node software. But the bitcoin community has fundamentally decided not to do that because it would increase the resource requirements for end users to run full nodes and validate the chain, which is like pretty much the critical aspects of what a blockchain is supposed to guarantee, that the state of the chain is correct effectively. But with new light node technology that uses fraud proofs and data availability sampling and Zk proofs, you can now increase the block size limit without compromising the ability for end users to validate and verify the chain like clients on Salana.
00:01:29.230 - 00:01:43.262, Speaker B: So the devil's in the details, obviously here. When you look at e two deployment, go to nodewatch IO. There's about 6500 machines that run the.
00:01:43.316 - 00:01:46.490, Speaker C: 300,000 e two nodes, e two validators.
00:01:46.570 - 00:01:49.950, Speaker B: There's only 6500 actual boxes.
00:01:50.930 - 00:01:54.926, Speaker C: So the real world deployment is that you take a Salana validator and then.
00:01:54.948 - 00:01:59.434, Speaker B: You load it up with like a few hundred e two nodes, right?
00:01:59.492 - 00:02:09.346, Speaker C: E two validators. And that's your e two deployment. So the real world is that machines are getting bigger, and the Salana validators.
00:02:09.378 - 00:02:43.438, Speaker B: Are not stacks of Xeon processors, they're like 32 core systems, which is what you get out of a data center right now for $800 a month, which is not insane by any means. It's not building racks and racks of systems like you would for centralized service to handle all those users. So there's a bit of, of kind, I think. I don't know. You have to actually look at the.
00:02:43.444 - 00:02:45.470, Speaker C: Details of how these things are deployed.
00:02:46.710 - 00:02:50.274, Speaker B: I think it would be misinforming to.
00:02:50.312 - 00:02:53.214, Speaker C: Say that the amount of hardware necessary.
00:02:53.262 - 00:02:55.938, Speaker B: To run Solana is that significantly different.
00:02:56.024 - 00:02:59.414, Speaker C: Than any of the other chains when.
00:02:59.452 - 00:03:20.934, Speaker B: You actually look at how these things are being deployed in the real world. But lite clients themselves, when you're talking about like a different system for verification, there's obviously trade offs. So whenever anyone brings this up, the question that I have is assuming all the other nodes, everything else has been destroyed.
00:03:21.062 - 00:03:27.198, Speaker C: How many light clients do you need to rehypothecate the network to reconstruct it.
00:03:27.364 - 00:03:43.870, Speaker B: So how many nodes are you trusting when you run this thing? And those trust assumptions are important to users because the end state of a monolithic chain is when you don't run any nodes, you're trusting that at least.
00:03:43.940 - 00:03:46.630, Speaker C: One out of the whatever 3000 box.
00:03:46.740 - 00:03:49.366, Speaker B: That run the replicate Solana, at least.
00:03:49.388 - 00:03:55.734, Speaker C: One of them is honest. So when you run a light client, you partially participate in validation, and then.
00:03:55.772 - 00:04:07.446, Speaker B: You assume that at least x number of other light clients are honest to actually help you get those guarantees. So it's up to the users to.
00:04:07.468 - 00:04:08.820, Speaker C: Pick which one and if they even care.
