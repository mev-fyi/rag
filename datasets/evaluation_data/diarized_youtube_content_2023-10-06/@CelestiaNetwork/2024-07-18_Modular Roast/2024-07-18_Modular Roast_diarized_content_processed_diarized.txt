00:00:02.360 - 00:00:31.130, Speaker A: All right, why don't we here, I'm going to give everyone a little bit of an update on the format here, because this is not like a regular panel. This is a fun panel. This is a roast. All right, we're going to be. Everyone said very nice things about modular so far today, but we're going to say some slightly not nice things. And then, Mustafa, Nick, you're going to defend modular and the idea in terms of rules. So we're going to go through a couple of slides here where one of our panelists has maybe not said such nice things about modular on Twitter.
00:00:31.130 - 00:00:35.590, Speaker A: We're going to point out some of the flaws and then we're going to banter back and forth.
00:00:35.710 - 00:00:40.526, Speaker B: I'm sure Eric has also said some not nice things about modular. Right, Eric?
00:00:40.678 - 00:00:44.470, Speaker C: I'm an investor in Celestia. Why would I say something bad about Celestia?
00:00:44.510 - 00:00:45.614, Speaker B: Come on. True story.
00:00:45.662 - 00:00:49.614, Speaker A: I actually looked and I could not find one bad thing that Eric had said about modular.
00:00:49.702 - 00:00:50.574, Speaker B: That is rare.
00:00:50.662 - 00:01:00.224, Speaker C: Yeah, well, I have said one bad thing. You know, this sort of me like you had one job.
00:01:00.352 - 00:01:01.020, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:01:01.600 - 00:01:12.376, Speaker C: So if you take a data availability layer, what is the one job that a data availability layer should do? What is the one job that you.
00:01:12.408 - 00:01:13.296, Speaker D: I know where you're going with this.
00:01:13.328 - 00:01:14.220, Speaker B: Data availability.
00:01:15.840 - 00:01:21.954, Speaker C: What is the one job that you have to publish data to make data available?
00:01:22.082 - 00:01:27.898, Speaker D: See, I knew you were going. I knew where you were going with this. And that's why I want to rename data availability to data publication.
00:01:27.954 - 00:01:32.750, Speaker C: Okay, so you want to rename in order to not get owned by my argument, you're going to rename the whole thing?
00:01:33.370 - 00:01:35.790, Speaker D: No, because, so that people like you don't get confused.
00:01:36.170 - 00:01:40.150, Speaker C: They are confused because you confused them by calling it the data availability.
00:01:41.650 - 00:01:43.612, Speaker D: It was actually Vitalik that that cool.
00:01:43.636 - 00:01:44.076, Speaker C: Do that.
00:01:44.148 - 00:01:49.840, Speaker A: Guys, is this the first time at a crypto conference that we've ever debated about semantics? Has that ever happened before?
00:01:50.140 - 00:01:50.908, Speaker E: Thank you.
00:01:51.004 - 00:01:52.812, Speaker A: Oh, thank you. All right, excellent.
00:01:52.876 - 00:01:53.524, Speaker B: Here we go.
00:01:53.612 - 00:01:55.692, Speaker A: Here we go. Now the rows can start.
00:01:55.876 - 00:01:56.956, Speaker B: Now we're talking.
00:01:57.028 - 00:02:00.480, Speaker E: Holy. Okay. All right, now finish these. We'll get you another one.
00:02:02.100 - 00:02:16.220, Speaker A: All right, guys, we're going to start in here with some. Well, actually, can we just do a super quick round of introductions here? In the rare instance that there's someone in the audience that doesn't know Nick, can I call on you here, Mister Modular himself with the modular mullet to give us the first introduction.
00:02:16.680 - 00:02:19.780, Speaker B: I'm Nick White. I'm the Coo at Celestia Labs.
00:02:21.280 - 00:02:55.420, Speaker C: I'm Eric Wall. And yeah, I'm an investor in Celestia. And, yeah, that's called a disclosure, by the way. And yeah, I'm the co founder of Taproot Wizards, which were responsible for the largest spam attack on bitcoin in its history. And we're running out of space to spam, so we need more data that we can spam. So that's why I like the modular space.
00:02:57.360 - 00:03:00.940, Speaker D: I'm most of the co founder and CEO of Searchlabs.
00:03:02.360 - 00:03:05.220, Speaker E: I'mrt. I am the chief ship poster at Solana.
00:03:06.980 - 00:03:32.560, Speaker A: That is an apt resume, because we're going to see some of your resume's best work, Mister Chief ship poster. And you've got to do the lion's effort here of the criticisms of modular. And then some of these guys are going to defend it here. This is the same rules as the Tom Brady roast, so everything is on the table except no jokes about Robert Kraft getting hand jobs. That is the only thing that we cannot talk about on this stage. All right, that was a little bit of a whiff. All right, we're going to get right into it here.
00:03:32.560 - 00:03:34.486, Speaker A: All right.
00:03:34.598 - 00:03:35.246, Speaker E: Oh, fuck.
00:03:35.318 - 00:03:44.490, Speaker A: L two s are a scam. Evm. L two s are just a scam inadvertently invented by big etherscan to sell you more block explorers.
00:03:45.390 - 00:03:48.410, Speaker D: Do they charge? Do they charge for playing more explorers?
00:03:48.870 - 00:03:52.318, Speaker B: They certainly do charge millions of dollars every year.
00:03:52.374 - 00:03:54.302, Speaker A: Millions? Yeah. Per l two.
00:03:54.326 - 00:03:56.022, Speaker B: But that's why block scout exists.
00:03:56.166 - 00:03:56.422, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:03:56.446 - 00:04:03.330, Speaker C: That's why Richard Heart's pulse chain does not have an ether scan explorer. They have block scout.
00:04:04.340 - 00:04:05.480, Speaker B: Is that true?
00:04:06.500 - 00:04:07.516, Speaker C: That is true.
00:04:07.668 - 00:04:09.484, Speaker B: Didn't Richard Heart make a lot of money?
00:04:09.612 - 00:04:11.252, Speaker C: But he's not using that money too.
00:04:11.276 - 00:04:12.884, Speaker B: Easy because he's buying Louis Vuitton.
00:04:12.932 - 00:04:17.772, Speaker C: That is his money now. All right, I'm not joking.
00:04:17.836 - 00:04:20.660, Speaker B: It went to the g wagon and the Louis Vuitton.
00:04:20.820 - 00:04:22.240, Speaker C: Yeah, pretty much.
00:04:22.980 - 00:04:24.972, Speaker A: All right, that's one use case for hex.
00:04:25.036 - 00:04:32.290, Speaker D: I'll be impressed if a block explorer invented l two s and roll ups and for proof and balancing proof. If that's true, I'm not even mad.
00:04:33.830 - 00:04:37.654, Speaker A: All right, myrrh. Say some words about l two s here. What are your thoughts on l two s?
00:04:37.782 - 00:04:55.086, Speaker E: I love them. They're the best thing that's ever happened, and it's the only way crypto can go forward. Okay, but the context behind that tweet is obviously a ship post. Actually, I was cross posting to farcaster, and I was like, I wonder where they will resonate more with this? And actually, the farcaster people liked it.
00:04:55.118 - 00:04:57.890, Speaker A: So they're the ones paying for etherscan.
00:05:01.190 - 00:05:14.694, Speaker E: But no, I mean, maybe. Okay, let's get serious. We're not that serious. But the context was that, okay, maybe there's more apps or there's more chains than apps in crypto. And so it was a fun way to kind of frame this, and that was it.
00:05:14.862 - 00:05:16.054, Speaker A: You're kidding me.
00:05:16.182 - 00:05:17.810, Speaker B: Is etherscan an app?
00:05:18.110 - 00:05:26.410, Speaker E: It's not? No. Well, actually. Is it? Okay. Are block explorers apps? Yes. No. Okay, let's do a vote. Yes.
00:05:26.410 - 00:05:32.368, Speaker E: Okay. We have four people, I think. No. Oh, wow. Okay.
00:05:32.424 - 00:05:40.976, Speaker C: So, mert, I think you don't have to apologize. I think this tweet is 100% true. I see no lies there. No lies detected.
00:05:41.088 - 00:05:42.220, Speaker E: Yeah, exactly.
00:05:42.800 - 00:05:57.390, Speaker A: So what do we think when we go into this future? I saw many talks that there are going to be a million l two s or thousands of l two s in the future. Are these things great? Is it a good way for us to be scaling the industry, or should we be thinking in a more integrated way? What do you think?
00:05:59.810 - 00:06:52.150, Speaker E: Well, I mean, my fundamental problem has been, are we actually solving any problems with these new chains, or are we kind of just throwing them out there so we can raise a round and then upsell it by another vc in the next round, and then kind of just keep doing that circle jerk and have these tokens that don't really do anything for the chains? Or can we actually solve some real problems that existed? And, I mean, you can absolutely solve problems with Altoos, right? For example, salon got congested. That's why I was late, actually. And it sucks. You literally could not land a transaction. I couldn't do extremely valuable things like ape shitcoins with hats and stuff. And then people were complaining. Actually, Nick commented on one from Vib, who, the founder of Drip, who did kind of just spam nfts on chain.
00:06:52.150 - 00:07:15.710, Speaker E: And maybe the problem with. Or one of the problems with an integrated chain is, like, you have to share that block space with other people who kind of shit in the public pool, but with sovereign roll ups, which I don't know if you have a tweet, but I've tweeted. I was like, if I weren't working on Slana, I'd probably do, like, sovereign roll ups or something, because I just. I hate other people, so I'd rather just own the block space myself. And so that's a good use case.
00:07:17.210 - 00:07:21.430, Speaker A: Mustafa, Nick, what do you guys think about that? Are you guys fans of sovereign roll ups? Do you like that idea?
00:07:21.770 - 00:07:56.046, Speaker D: I mean, I coined the term sovereign roll up. And I kind of regret doing so because no one's actually read my blog post to see how I define the word sovereign roll up. And everyone has their own definition of sovereign roll up. And I have to explain to them that if you read my original blog post, the distinction between a sovereign and non sovereign roll up is not a technical distinction, it's a social distinction. Like, it's a very minor social distinction that basically says in a sovereign roll up, it's the community that decides the canonical for choice rule. And that could be the case for any roll up. And that's the op stack.
00:07:56.046 - 00:08:42.536, Speaker D: People have argued that optimism is a sovereign roll up, and if they say so, it is, you know, so it's not really so kind of like I kind of avoid saying that turn out because everyone means something different by it. But I think the main point of, I guess the main point of coining that term is basically from the celestial perspective. We don't see rollups as a solution just to scale some layer one. We see roll ups as cool things in their own right. And if you look today, why are people deploying all these roll ups? At least in the past year? Developers aren't deploying rollups because they want to scale Ethereum. They're deploying roll ups because it's a cool way to deploy stuff. We see all these application specific roll ups.
00:08:42.536 - 00:08:48.620, Speaker D: Developers don't care about scaling in layer one or Ethereum. They care about developing an application in the best way possible.
00:08:49.800 - 00:08:51.340, Speaker E: What are some of those applications?
00:08:53.680 - 00:08:56.100, Speaker A: These applications, are they in the room with us now?
00:08:57.200 - 00:09:19.860, Speaker C: This is my main criticism. Like, look at Mustafa's shirt. It says, build whatever. I would challenge that and say, come up with one thing that's worth building. The reason that this whole tagline, build whatever exists is because you thought about it like, okay, what are some cool things to build? I don't fucking know. Build whatever. Just build something.
00:09:19.860 - 00:09:56.136, Speaker C: But it's already built, right? I saw this picture of you the other day like you're smoking a hookah and there was, your eyes were completely blank and you had this shirt on which said, build whatever. You reach the maximum nihilism of the roll up centric roadmap. You don't know what people are supposed to build. So you're just like, build whatever. It's the worst tagline I've heard in my entire life. Come up with one good thing to build and tell people to build it.
00:09:56.288 - 00:10:13.574, Speaker D: I mean, it's cooler than, you know, the reason why we hold it build whatever is because it's like, whatever. You know, it's like. Because you could have some cringy corporate tagline like, build what's avalanche? You're build with no limit.
00:10:13.622 - 00:10:22.050, Speaker C: Like, I've given up. I don't know what you're supposed to build with this shit. We have so much blog space. I don't know. Can someone just make use of this, please?
00:10:22.510 - 00:10:27.480, Speaker B: Isn't it crypto dickbuds? That's what we need, right? Just post, fill the block space.
00:10:27.600 - 00:10:29.912, Speaker A: That's a cool thing. That's a cool thing.
00:10:30.016 - 00:10:35.580, Speaker C: Yeah. Maybe you should hire us, and we'll come and we'll build some dick butts on your chain.
00:10:38.320 - 00:11:01.892, Speaker A: All right. There is simply nothing dumber than the monolithic versus modular debate right now. So we've probably seen many monolithic versus modular panels over the years. Mert, why is this not the correct framing of this question? Okay, I did not tell Myrt what tweets is going to be porn.
00:11:02.036 - 00:11:05.600, Speaker E: Yeah. What's the question?
00:11:06.020 - 00:11:09.200, Speaker A: Why is this the dumbest thing that we could be talking about right now?
00:11:10.020 - 00:11:35.810, Speaker E: Okay, well, this is a roast, but I'll get maybe a bit more serious. The reason it's dumb is because, actually, what we just talked about, which is that the only thing that fundamentally matters to, is you need to build something that people want. And it doesn't matter how your cloud infrastructure looks or what it's called or the name of your database and all this shit. All that matters is people want some block space. They want to access it, they want to write to it. They want to read from it. That's it.
00:11:35.810 - 00:12:04.616, Speaker E: Now saying that. Let's say you build on Solana, and they're like, oh, no, that's a sin. How dare you do this? How dare you go into the high priest of the church, build modular. Instead of. It's like, okay, but first of all, the person is actually building something, which is a start, which doesn't happen that often. So let them build first, and then if there's something that fundamentally doesn't work or scale about it, then maybe they can kind of consider doing something else. But fundamentally, you kind of need to take that first step, which just doesn't happen.
00:12:04.616 - 00:12:43.400, Speaker E: And maybe on a more technical level, I feel like the modular stuff has been called modular, but it's actually more like a distributed monolith if you actually play it out a bit more, which is to say that the parts are actually kind of tightly coupled and you can't actually swap them out. Like, if you have, like, an EVM thing or something and you want to change the execution environment. That's not an easy lift. I don't even know how the SVM works that well. And then people will say, okay, like, Solana is monolithic, whatever. But then we just took a vote today, actually, and everybody agreed that Solana was modular. But nothing changed about the chain in that time.
00:12:43.400 - 00:12:59.700, Speaker E: Since we called it monolithic at all. People just kind of deploy shit. Usually it breaks the chain. And then Tolle says, no, it's not broken. Whatever. And then Liam from fire dance would be like, no, it is broken. And then they'll just argue on Twitter for, like, five days, and it's like, okay, it doesn't work.
00:12:59.700 - 00:13:28.048, Speaker E: And then we just iterate based on that. But fundamentally, nothing has actually changed about the architecture here. I always say that integrated is just modular but enshrined to the core layer. And I just fundamentally think it doesn't matter the name of your cloud architecture. What matters is you work backwards from the problem. And some certain apps benefit more from shared state. So, like, price, discovery, defi, et cetera.
00:13:28.048 - 00:13:35.300, Speaker E: And some of them, like a game, for example, they don't give a shit about dog with hat. They don't need to access that liquidity. They can just go do whatever in their roll up.
00:13:36.510 - 00:13:40.414, Speaker A: What do you guys think about this? What are the advantages of building in a modular way?
00:13:40.582 - 00:14:17.114, Speaker D: I mean, the kind of original. The original purpose of this monolithic versus monolith debate is not even just purely because of technical architecture, but because every cycle we see these new layer ones. Like, in the first cycle we did ethereum, the next cycle we had Tron, Cardano, and then these previous cycle and avalanche. This cycle we have, what is it? Aptos and Sui. So it's like every cycle there's these new layer ones that do an incremental improvement over the previous layer ones. And each layer one tries to replicate the entire ecosystem of an entire layer one. Every layer one has some Dex.
00:14:17.114 - 00:14:42.616, Speaker D: Every layer one has some NFT app. And maybe Solana is the end game. I don't know. It could be. But the point of this was like, well, why don't we try to make it so that instead of having a negative some ecosystem where everyone's fighting this tribal layer ones trying to compete with each other, why don't you make it that it's possible to make incremental improvements without doing that? And, yeah, it's not perfect. Like, there is a criticism that there is too much modular infrastructure. So there is.
00:14:42.616 - 00:15:00.122, Speaker D: And Solana does have an app culture, so that is kind of like a good thing. But who knows if Solana is the final layer one? Everyone thinks that they're the final layer one. So that's the kind of point of it. And the fact that there are l two s on Solana kind of proves that there is no final layer one.
00:15:00.266 - 00:15:07.310, Speaker E: Well, there used to be more in l one s and whatnot. Incremental. I do agree. They were mostly incremental until Solana. I might be a bit biased.
00:15:07.890 - 00:15:09.790, Speaker A: You actually tweet about Solana a lot.
00:15:10.530 - 00:15:31.040, Speaker E: Haven't noticed. But then the alternative is you have a bunch of l two s that are actually worse than the previous l two, or actually, definitely worse than the l one. I mean, if you don't believe me, you can just go to l two to beat.com and just look and make a judgment after that. And so I think now the incentive is to launch chains instead of actually looking at any problems that exist and solving those problems.
00:15:32.300 - 00:16:09.752, Speaker D: So I did, like, two years ago, I tweeted something very controversial, or that sparked a lot of debate, and I asked the question why the original use case of crypto was, everyone's talking about apps. You asked me, what apps can you build? And the original purpose of crypto. The original app is payments. Bitcoin is peer to peer digital cash. So we haven't even succeeded at the most basic use case, which I consider to be the hello world of what crypto should be. So it's like, now we're talking about doing more complex apps when we haven't even succeeded at payments. And there is this saying that there's too much infrastructure and not applications, but actually, I don't think so.
00:16:09.752 - 00:16:31.836, Speaker D: I think there isn't enough infrastructure, because even Solana, I don't think even Solana is visa scale. Two ktps is. Is the limits right now. Right? So there is. Even Solana cannot handle the wealth payments. So I think, I thought we succeeded at this basic application with the payment, which is payments. And yeah, people are saying, well, that should be the last application, but I don't agree with that.
00:16:31.836 - 00:16:38.240, Speaker D: I think payments should be, like, the goal, the basic application that everyone should be trying to get to.
00:16:40.060 - 00:16:41.316, Speaker C: But payments with what?
00:16:41.388 - 00:16:44.708, Speaker D: Like, I see people buying coffee, buy.
00:16:44.724 - 00:16:47.804, Speaker C: Tia token or stable coins, or like, what are they supposed to pay?
00:16:47.852 - 00:16:49.440, Speaker D: Anything. Anything. Just please.
00:16:49.760 - 00:16:53.776, Speaker C: They're not going to pay in t or bitcoin or ethereum, because they're USD.
00:16:53.888 - 00:16:54.904, Speaker D: Even USDC.
00:16:54.952 - 00:17:00.580, Speaker C: Okay, so we'll build a modular chain for people to transfer bank assets.
00:17:01.280 - 00:17:06.976, Speaker D: Sure. But anything, like, if you can start anywhere, then that's a good. That's better than nothing.
00:17:07.128 - 00:17:39.503, Speaker C: I'm just grilling. I actually agree with you that we should be, like, stable coins are, like, an order of magnitude better than banks, and we should be. I think that's maybe the only thing in crypto, like, after all of these mother, you know, iggy azalea twerks and daddy coin, the only thing that remains is that stable coins are better than banks, and we should use them more. And they actually. I don't even think we have to do anything. They're spreading on their own. That's the only chart that goes straight up.
00:17:39.503 - 00:17:42.399, Speaker C: And we should build better infrastructure for it.
00:17:42.439 - 00:17:42.569, Speaker B: I.
00:17:42.599 - 00:17:52.574, Speaker C: And make it happen, and then people will actually use their stable coins and lending applications to get yield and all that. So I kind of agree with you. We got to solve for payments first. And, like, no one's really.
00:17:52.662 - 00:18:18.214, Speaker E: I don't think the bottleneck for payments is infrastructure. I think it's mostly regulation and actually the merchants giving a shit to accept the coins in the first place if they. I mean, people do this on Solana today. I'm actually the CEO of Helio, which is the payments network on Solana. And, like, for example, when you pay for breakpoint tickets, you know, you can use Helio and whatnot, and also which uses Helios hyperaciece, by the way, and. But the problem is, no one really gives a shit. Right? They're like, okay, whatever.
00:18:18.214 - 00:18:21.254, Speaker E: Why should I accept this coin? It's maybe gonna go down value.
00:18:21.342 - 00:18:40.382, Speaker C: Yeah, but you gave your shit, right? Would you rather, like, imagine that we didn't have to make, like, our investments through our bank accounts? Like, you would prefer stable coin, though, right? Yeah. Yeah. So I think that's the fundamental principle. We prefer stable coins over the banking industry. Let's just scale that intuition. And there's not that many regulatory hurdles. I can receive stable coins from you.
00:18:40.382 - 00:18:47.290, Speaker C: There's no one stopping me. Yeah, maybe businesses, there's small hurdles, but I don't think they're insurmountable.
00:18:47.630 - 00:19:25.132, Speaker E: Well, you know, it just needs to be, like, if you're okay. So these merchants need, like, a ten x reason to change and learn all these new systems and give a shit about, okay, why should I accept this? What can I do with it? Why is it easier for me? Maybe it's, like, marginally lower take rates or something, but then they kind of maybe lose some of the insurance benefits and, like, the other kind of boomer security kind of model, which has been established for some time now. And so I don't think any infrastructure solution actually helps move payments forward as much as, first of all, giving people a reason to use it, giving them a reason to switch over. I don't think infrastructure global Venmo is.
00:19:25.156 - 00:19:27.468, Speaker C: A ten x improvement over local Venmo.
00:19:27.604 - 00:19:43.748, Speaker D: Like, Venmo is newer than bitcoin. It's got 50 million users in the US. It's got 700 employees. Like, the amount of capital that has been poured into blockchains is at least, like, 100 x more than Venmo. There's at least, like, 20 x as many people working on crypto infrastructure than Venmo, probably, I'm guessing.
00:19:43.804 - 00:19:45.532, Speaker C: Okay, this is boring. Switch tracks.
00:19:45.556 - 00:19:45.964, Speaker B: I agree.
00:19:46.052 - 00:19:46.804, Speaker A: I agree.
00:19:46.972 - 00:19:47.548, Speaker B: All right.
00:19:47.644 - 00:19:48.564, Speaker D: Yi mentioned Venmo.
00:19:48.612 - 00:19:53.684, Speaker A: All right, I want to skip here and actually talk about what is the right way to build.
00:19:53.812 - 00:19:54.684, Speaker E: These are all my tweets.
00:19:54.732 - 00:19:58.170, Speaker A: These are all your tweets? These are all your tweets.
00:19:58.830 - 00:19:59.158, Speaker C: All right.
00:19:59.174 - 00:20:48.730, Speaker A: I want to talk about what the right way to build an ecosystem is and maybe to editorialize a little bit in my position as Roastmaster here. I think that one of the challenges with modularity is this idea of fragmentation. This is what people have been talking about, especially in ethereum land, but also in modular writ large. One of the advantages modular is that you get to be much more specialized, but you also have this kind of fragmentation problem, both in terms of tech. You're fragmenting who has to take, like, a value add percentage, but you're also fragmenting narrative, and everything feels a little bit more disjointed, as opposed to something like Solana. A more integrated approach maybe feels a little bit more cohesive, but maybe in the end state, it's limited at scale. So we're in the battle here to win hearts and minds, right? I don't think we want to be here, and maybe if there's not enough infrastructure now, I don't think we want to be here with the same group of people in tenure.
00:20:48.730 - 00:21:06.920, Speaker A: Everyone in this room is great, but I don't think we want this to be exactly the same in ten years as it is right now. So what's the right way to build an ecosystem? How do we go out there and coordinate people to win hearts and minds? It wasn't really a roast. Now, I'm just curious what you guys think.
00:21:08.180 - 00:21:34.110, Speaker E: I mean, I'm not one to dictate the right way to build anything. I think something I say pretty consistently is that you must explore all paths to maximize the probability of a crypto future, because one path might not work, but then there's a lot of other people in parallel innovating. So that's actually why I like modularity, because it allows people and capital to get into the space and kind of do their own thing. This particular tweet is more so about.
00:21:37.810 - 00:21:39.510, Speaker A: Yes, Eric, good.
00:21:39.810 - 00:21:40.922, Speaker E: Is that an aperol?
00:21:41.026 - 00:21:42.162, Speaker A: This is. Yeah.
00:21:42.306 - 00:21:43.314, Speaker B: It has alcohol.
00:21:43.402 - 00:21:52.520, Speaker A: It's got alcohol. That's all we need to know. That's a special cup.
00:21:54.260 - 00:21:55.172, Speaker E: Are we doing this?
00:21:55.276 - 00:21:57.800, Speaker A: Yeah, we'll wait for everyone. Solidarity.
00:21:59.900 - 00:22:02.840, Speaker E: Yeah. I don't know the right way to build anything.
00:22:03.820 - 00:22:05.316, Speaker A: All right, how do we. Salud.
00:22:05.428 - 00:22:06.020, Speaker E: Do we.
00:22:06.140 - 00:22:06.628, Speaker A: Cheers.
00:22:06.724 - 00:22:08.132, Speaker B: All right, cheers.
00:22:08.236 - 00:22:09.480, Speaker E: All right, cheers, Solana.
00:22:15.810 - 00:22:18.470, Speaker C: To the roll up centric roadmap.
00:22:19.690 - 00:22:21.790, Speaker B: The bitcoins roll up centric roadmap.
00:22:25.010 - 00:22:56.910, Speaker E: Yeah. I mean, the point here isn't to actually roast or in that tweet, at least. I mean, now the point is roast Madurai, but in that tweet, it's not. It's more so to defend the notion that integrated chains can't innovate, because there's, like, a common thing where it's like, okay, if you're an integrated chain, you must rely on Tolle's word and then you must get permission so you can, you know, whatever, build something. But we just released DK compression and we just proved that wrong directly. Right. We're now scaling Solana's storage costs and account allocation costs by, like, 6000 x.
00:22:56.910 - 00:23:27.278, Speaker E: And we did not need to, you know, raise a token and raise this $100 million round and whatnot. We just kind of did it. And then I posted on Twitter and then, of course, Adam Cochran told me, it's a validium, therefore it must be a validium. But fundamentally, it's just, there is no right way to build things. People will do kind of what they want, and as long as people are trying to push the mission forward, I think that's all that matters. I don't think. I don't think you need to have some badge of alignment to actually ship something.
00:23:27.278 - 00:23:31.410, Speaker E: That actually is the only way to do something. You can kind of just build whatever.
00:23:32.140 - 00:23:58.940, Speaker B: But the point is that that permissionless innovation you just cited on Solana is modular, right? Like ZK compression is, in my opinion, still basically a roll up. And the problem with a monolithic chain is that there is only one roadmap. There can only be one roadmap. And in modular, there can be. You talked about, like, all these different. We have to explore as many paths as possible, right, to get to the end game. And that's what modular enables.
00:23:58.940 - 00:24:21.460, Speaker B: We can, in parallel be exploring every single possible path. Yeah, some of them suck. Some of these l two s, most of them are going to fail. Right. It's about creative destruction. It's about like, failure is like, you know, when people talk about entrepreneurship, it's like failure is actually a good thing because you learned that that doesn't work and that helps you find the thing that does work in the end.
00:24:21.620 - 00:25:05.236, Speaker C: Yeah. I used to be a big believer in this, but then I actually tried to build an application. So this was on the Ethereum base layer. I had a project called Orbland, and we realized that it was like people can ask questions and get an answer from an influencer, whatever. But the fees on the l one got high enough that we needed to migrate to an l two, and then we needed to make a choice. So which l two are we going to migrate to? And then we were like, okay, so arbitrum is a good, the best l two. Let's go over there.
00:25:05.268 - 00:25:07.268, Speaker B: You should have done a sovereign roll up, right?
00:25:07.404 - 00:25:40.384, Speaker C: No, I'm not going to make it my own. I just want to deploy. Okay, so arbitrum, that might be where the liquidity is. So we were thinking about arbitrum and then, no, actually friend tech is over at base and maybe there's where the social fi app. So maybe I should go over to base with base is like a completely centralized chain, maybe. And actually, maybe it's happening over. And blast has talked about that they're going to be the l two for nfts.
00:25:40.384 - 00:26:20.636, Speaker C: So they're going to build like a native bridge for anything. All opstack l two s has this. But the blast was supposed to build a way for you to bridge in nfts like ERC 20, erc seven hundred and twenty one s. And then we just got stuck because there's all these l two s and it's really hard to pick one. And we just. So the company is now bankrupt and doesn't exist anymore because we basically got stuck in this, like, decision deadlock. Like, which fucking of these l two s are we gonna pick? So that's the modularity, the roll up centric roadmap.
00:26:20.636 - 00:26:51.540, Speaker C: I feel like a fucking idiot because I did this exact same mistake with bitcoin. That lightning. Yeah, yeah. You know, I'll just buy inbound liquidity for all my payments. And then when I actually had to do, it's like, wait a minute, this sucks ass. And then with the roll up centric roadmap, it's like, okay, now I got to deploy an application. But how do I choose which roll up to build on? So I'm like, so we were actually looking into, like, let's build Solana orbs, because then we just have one decision, like, and everything works in the Solana ecosystem.
00:26:51.540 - 00:27:01.126, Speaker C: So, yeah. How do you guys respond to that? What should I have done? What did I do wrong?
00:27:01.198 - 00:27:36.144, Speaker A: Yeah, and let me just add one element here of there is a path dependency and a timing element to this, right, where even if the end game might end up being something that's more modular and distributed, who's to say that we should go 100% modular right now? Like, how do we trade off this feeling of fragmentation and Eric's or project going bankrupt because he has to decide between so many l two s? Maybe we need that once we actually have users and applications, and then we have many different chains. But for the amount of applications that we have today, maybe one chain is better because it actually eliminates choice. And what's to say that we couldn't just modularize later?
00:27:36.232 - 00:27:46.900, Speaker C: Yeah, I just want Colgate, like I said, toothpaste. I don't want, like, 40 different ones and get stuck there. And, like, one choice makes things easier.
00:27:47.440 - 00:28:12.072, Speaker E: I mean, for what it's worth, I don't actually, like, there will absolutely be multiple chains and there will be multiple winners. And I don't think one chain could possibly, actually, totally might kill me for that. So I'm not going to say that. But so Nick actually said, okay, Solana is modular. And I actually agree. But kind of the point here is it's always been that way. Nothing has changed.
00:28:12.072 - 00:28:25.710, Speaker E: We just didn't say it on Twitter because it doesn't help anybody build things on Solana. It's like, build on Solana because it's modular. It's like, no, build on Solana because it's fast. Block times large quorum thing, go fast. That's about it.
00:28:26.610 - 00:28:29.122, Speaker A: Twist. Solana's modular.
00:28:29.266 - 00:28:37.430, Speaker C: But what were your light nodes that you do in Paris or an airplane or toilet seat?
00:28:38.610 - 00:29:03.166, Speaker D: Well, I mean, that's actually a good point, because you say that anyone can Solana change can move fast. And there is a team that wants to implement light nodes in Solana, but Solana doesn't want to make the changes on the core protocol to support that. And things like data blobs like eclipse wanted to use Solana as the alias, but they couldn't because there's a Solana improvement proposal to add data blobs. And that's moving extremely slowly.
00:29:03.358 - 00:29:48.640, Speaker E: Well, you don't need the blobs to post the data. I mean, it's already cheap enough. And furthermore, ZK compression is a good example of we didn't need anything from the high council to ship something that actually scales the blockchain. And then there's actually a new client coming called Mithril, which basically takes out all the weird parts of gossip and all the sorts of weird nerdy stuff. And you can just run it locally on whatever, Nokia, BlackBerry, and you can verify these blocks at home without needing to be a data center chain. And so I think a lot of the nuance gets lost by just saying monolithic modular. I think it's more like engineers who want to help ship things to improve the state of the space.
00:29:50.740 - 00:30:17.290, Speaker A: So we're almost out of time here, but I would just be curious, like, if that's the end state, right? And what we should be building is that the infrastructure should meet the needs of the apps, then what are the apps saying today? Are we doing this for payments and merchants? And is that who we should be? Like, what blockchain should be used for? Are we doing this for Worldcoin or whichever chains are built? What are the apps actually say today? And how should that dictate what the infrastructure look like?
00:30:17.870 - 00:31:32.710, Speaker E: Well, I think that's the question, right? In fact, in the second last tweet where I said, the debate is so dumb, and the next reply is, what should actually matter is we need to keep looking for apps and then understand their problems. So if there's like, an analogy, what we've currently done is, let's say there's like ten doors with different keyholes. We just made a key at random, and just try to just open all of them at the same time and just say, like mass adoption or the next billion or something, and then just try to just basically punch the shit out of the door to make it fit. But what you need to do is you need to look at all the doors and the keyholes and then study them and then design something that uniquely can open them, right? And so you need to work backwards from the market in the problem space that exists, and then see, okay, does a modular architecture here make sense? Or can they kind of just be all on the shared state machine? Maybe they need composability, maybe Tolle's blog posts, I don't know, totally Shippos or something, maybe some marketing help. And so that's kind of the fundamental question. I think that's unanswered. I also run another company, helium does mobile networks, and that's a pretty good example of something that's just like, you know, it's just mobile networks, but then they can kind of use the same shared global state machine and then integrate with DeFi teams to kind of strengthen a product.
00:31:32.710 - 00:31:36.450, Speaker E: So, like, deep in. Makes sense, but, you know, we don't really know the answer.
00:31:37.190 - 00:32:06.846, Speaker B: Well, first of all, I just want to say I think we can keep it rolling if we want to. All right, user discretion. Mike, as the master here, but my response is like, I do think obviously you should listen to user and developer needs. Right? You also can't predict in advance what those are. And so the best thing you can do is build infrastructure that covers as many possible potential bases as possible. And that's exactly what I think modularity does. Right.
00:32:06.846 - 00:32:11.782, Speaker B: It means that, like, we don't know what the killer apps of crypto are going to be. Payments is definitely going to be one of them.
00:32:11.846 - 00:32:17.868, Speaker C: It was supposed to be Orbland, but it died at the altar of the roll up centric roadmap.
00:32:17.934 - 00:32:24.200, Speaker B: Yeah, but I feel like in any infrastructure application dynamic.
00:32:24.280 - 00:32:34.660, Speaker C: Name ten books. No, sorry, name ten apps. It's hard, right? It's hard. Orbland was one of them. And.
00:32:36.360 - 00:32:37.272, Speaker B: Let me just finish my question.
00:32:37.296 - 00:32:38.820, Speaker C: Becoming fewer and fewer.
00:32:39.160 - 00:32:56.610, Speaker B: You are trying to build an anticipation of something in the future, but you can't know what that is. So the best thing you can do is build for as many potential futures as possible. And then the thing that sticks is the thing that happened to be right, but you can't know in advance. And that's why I think modularity is the only answer.
00:32:57.070 - 00:33:27.340, Speaker E: Well, I think ethereum kind of did that, but then now there's the paradigm. Guys are like, wait a minute, actually, maybe this doesn't make sense. Do we shorten the block times? Do we make some other client changes, whatever. And I think fundamentally a blockchain, there are certain things that are shared between them. And as long as you're like, okay, we need to increase the number of full nodes in the quorum size, make it faster, make it cheap, make it such that a board ape mint in some part of the state doesn't affect me buying a shitcoin somewhere else. Local, state markets, whatever, some. And that is technically, you can label a modular.
00:33:27.340 - 00:33:36.740, Speaker E: I mean, all good software really is modular, but the way I like thinking about it is integrated, is actually just modular, but enshrined to the core.
00:33:38.520 - 00:34:20.820, Speaker A: Maybe that's a really good way of framing. The question is, what are the limits of the creative destruction neck that you described? When do we say, all right, we're just going to let the free market compete it out. And the best solution is going to win versus does there need to be some steward of these ecosystems? Maybe it's the original founder who does blog posts or something like that, or the role of a foundation. But ultimately there need to be some forces or structures that kind of set the guardrails. So do you see any limitation to the force of, like, creative destruction and capitalism and all these VC projects that just get to compete and win? Or should there be some sort of organizations that sets guardrails? Maybe thinks about things like enshrining things at the base layer, dealing with interop, that type of thing?
00:34:22.000 - 00:34:37.030, Speaker C: I have no idea what you just said, but I have another point. I have one point to make. I have one point to make. And I think, like, fundamentally we got to change the tagline from build whatever to fucking build something.
00:34:41.650 - 00:34:54.830, Speaker D: I'll run that by our head of marketing and see what he says about that. But for some context, the source of build whatever is less cringey than build with no limits or some corporate tagline like that, which is what people like avalanche have.
00:34:55.370 - 00:34:59.730, Speaker C: Okay, so we're less cringey than the cringiest.
00:34:59.890 - 00:35:04.200, Speaker D: So that's our main usb. That's pushable. Okay.
00:35:04.620 - 00:35:06.652, Speaker C: All right, that's a wrap, folks.
00:35:06.756 - 00:35:21.204, Speaker A: All right, you heard it from Eric. All right, guys, that's. That's the end. Thank you all very much. Guys, give a big round of applause to our panelists here. Mert, thank you very much for allowing us to pull some of your previous work. And big round of applause to Celestia for putting all this on.
00:35:21.204 - 00:35:23.364, Speaker A: Guys, thank you for putting on a wonderful show.
00:35:23.532 - 00:35:23.940, Speaker B: Thanks, Mike.
