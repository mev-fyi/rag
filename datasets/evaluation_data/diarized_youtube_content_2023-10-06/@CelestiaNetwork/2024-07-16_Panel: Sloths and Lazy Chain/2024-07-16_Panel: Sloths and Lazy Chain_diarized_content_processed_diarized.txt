00:00:01.880 - 00:00:47.850, Speaker A: It's really great to get all the sloths on stage and all the sloths gathered here in the audience. There's a lot to unpack and explore in the sloth habitat. And I first want to start out with going into what are the sloths? Where do they come from? What's the origin story of the sloths as a project? And then also, what's the origin story for each one of the panelists for how they discovered sloths and what sloths mean to them and what they think sloths mean to the broader modular ecosystem. But the origin really begins with Zucky. So why don't we start with you?
00:00:48.270 - 00:01:20.470, Speaker B: All right. I'm Zucky, the sloth father. The sloths were my idea and worked on them for about four months before the mint. I'll just do a quick. For people who are not familiar with the lore, the early or the sort of early how the sloths were launched. So there was so 2500 pfps. I have so much more appreciation for amp creators.
00:01:20.470 - 00:01:56.044, Speaker B: 2500 pfps were so much work. So, like, you know, started the idea in December, started working with sad, sad story Steve Sk. Steve is the artist behind the slots and some of the other collections, sort of in the family. So we started working with Steve in December, created this concept, created all the art. Then I think it was like, April 6 or something like that. April 6 or April 7, something like that. We had a.
00:01:56.044 - 00:02:36.170, Speaker B: So the concept was very much a fair launch. So we did the first sort of giant 400,000 address whitelist that was on stargaze. Shout out to the stargaze team for making that possible. So we did this giant whitelist, and it was one tia to mint, and they minted in about 4 hours. I'd been up literally the entire night getting this ready, so I, like, slept through most of the mint and started the trend towards laziness. And then the next day, Stefan from Noble came up with the lazy morning concept. We fired up a discord.
00:02:36.170 - 00:03:28.170, Speaker B: Everyone was like, a lot of people before launch were like, hey, how is this thing going to even work without any, like, marketing or hype ahead of time? It was sort of a stealth launch, and if you just had to follow me on Twitter and then Nick tweeted about it and it kind of blew up to find out about it, but, like, yeah, and now, I mean, the community has been going strong since then, and lots of new people, like these fine people, have joined, and they all have their own origin stories about how they got involved in the community. And I think we really like, my motivation for creating it was I've been involved in the Celestia project in one way, shape or form since 2019, and I really wanted to create sort of a cultural institution. And it's going pretty well, which is definitely a new hat for me to wear, but it's been fun.
00:03:31.190 - 00:03:59.864, Speaker C: Awesome. Yeah, I guess, Sagi, you have a weird path. I think we were talking about it just before he went from founder to NFT influencer, and it's usually the opposite, right? So, yeah, no, for me, I think I found the slots because I saw that Nick made them his PFP. So congrats, Nick. He's definitely very lazy. And then I also saw that Andy from the roll up, I think he also did it. And I was like, ok, these guys dropped to something.
00:03:59.864 - 00:04:22.702, Speaker C: Like, I didn't actually get to mint a. But I bought some pretty early right after they minted, so. Also got pretty lucky, I guess, too. It was super late for me, I think I also had to go to sleep. So, yeah, definitely. It's nice to see that Arian's story sort of somewhat related to sleep. And then I also started managing the Twitter account.
00:04:22.702 - 00:04:37.720, Speaker C: I just randomly, as an anonymous guy, DM Taki, and I was like, hey, you seem like you need help, so. Yeah, and it's been like community run, like, ever since. And I'll pass on the award to German because I'm sure he has a cool story, too.
00:04:38.420 - 00:05:21.428, Speaker D: Thank you. Yeah, I also did not join the mint because I was asleep, but, yeah, I just saw all the buzz on Twitter. Is it closer? Yeah, I just saw the buzz on Twitter and immediately felt the FOMO. But what kind of got me really into this was more like the whole modular thesis sort of resonates a lot with me. I think it's sort of the way to do, like, the whole app chain. Thesis. The modular thesis, sort of how you do that in practice and at scale.
00:05:21.428 - 00:05:51.686, Speaker D: Scale. And, yeah, I'm a developer, so. And as everyone knows, developers are super lazy. So it's just. Yeah, it resonates on every level for me, essentially. And, yeah, during the Celestia hackathon, that was quite recently, I started building like, a lazy chain for fun as a secondary project that I did. And, yeah, just been somehow involved in all of this after that.
00:05:51.686 - 00:05:55.518, Speaker D: It's been a fun, not so lazy journey, actually.
00:05:55.694 - 00:05:57.942, Speaker C: Did you fall asleep after you minted or.
00:05:57.966 - 00:05:58.294, Speaker B: No.
00:05:58.382 - 00:06:11.170, Speaker D: Oh, yeah. Sorry. Yeah, so I just. Immediately when I woke up and casually scrolled Twitter and got the fOMO, I just had to buy a couple.
00:06:13.510 - 00:06:56.708, Speaker E: Okay. So I'm coming from cryptography and encryption background, which is pretty weird. So I'm founder of Fairblock, and one of our challenges is that when you talk about encryption in the space, people think about, like, tornado cache or things that are not really making sense for, like, real users. But in the real world, we have encryption in all of the institutions, for all of the applications. And I'm a really big believer of, like, on chain encryption. And I was always impressed by how crypto zombies educated a lot of developers in a very fun way and an interactive way. So I was, like, really working on gamification of our encryption modules and how we can have that.
00:06:56.708 - 00:07:26.570, Speaker E: And I was sleeping, and I saw Zack in my dream, and he told me that we can use this kind of modular talent opportunity that we have here to build games using encryption and using the community to show a very different aspect of encryption. So with encryption, you can have, like, on chain games, multiplayer games, which is like, a very different kind of story that people can have, like, a very tangible experience of what you can actually do with encryption.
00:07:28.270 - 00:07:48.232, Speaker A: I love it. That's a great background. My own origin story about sloths is I happen to be online, and I saw someone tweet about the mint. I think it was some stargaze employee, or maybe it was a stargaze account. And I was like, I had heard rumors about it. Zucky was actually very good at keeping a secret, believe it or not. A lot of people are like, oh, well, you had inside insight or something.
00:07:48.232 - 00:07:50.632, Speaker A: That's how you got the mint. I did not. I just was.
00:07:50.736 - 00:07:58.140, Speaker B: No one thought it would succeed. That was, like, the biggest. That was the biggest thing. Like, all of the people who knew about it, most of them didn't even bother to mint.
00:07:58.640 - 00:08:22.650, Speaker A: Yeah. And luckily, I also live in Hawaii, and so it wasn't that late for me. It was probably, like, 02:00 p.m. or, I don't know, 03:00 p.m. so I minted, and I was like, this is sick. I immediately made my profile picture, and then I just kind of signed off and went to sleep. And then I remember I woke up in the morning and the floor price had gone up like crazy, and everyone admitted, and it was really cool and astonishing, kind of, to see how quickly it took off.
00:08:22.650 - 00:09:20.610, Speaker A: So I want to talk. I do eventually want to transition into talking about the lazy chain. But before we do that, I think I want to dive a little bit deeper into, like, this kind of connection between technology and community and culture, because I think this is really what sloths, like, the value they've brought to the modular community is that modularity so far has just been about, like, a technical narrative, right. It's been about, you know, something that it's harder for people to relate to. And I think what sloths have done is created this sort of, like, shelling point for this mostly sort of technical narrative and community to gather around and create culture and have fun and to identify with. Right. Like, when you rock a sloth PFP, it kind of is a flag that you stand for modularity, and you're part of this broader community.
00:09:20.610 - 00:09:32.910, Speaker A: And so I guess I want to just hear your guys thoughts on. On that connection and what you think the sloths mean and what value they bring to the modular community generally.
00:09:34.770 - 00:10:25.660, Speaker B: I'll just so part of the or so I wouldn't say that I've, like, fully understood what slots could be. When I came up with the idea, right. I thought that, yes, that there would be, like, there was a need for a little bit of a cultural, like, rallying point, shelling point, watering hole, et cetera, for the celestia community that, like. But, you know, so, like, why sloths is probably so, like, you know, I started, when I started contributing to the celestial project, it was called Lazy Ledger. Mustafa's original paper about the idea of the sort of modular blockchain was a paper called Lazy Ledgere. This project, the project was originally called Laser Wedger. Laser Wedger was a far harder project to raise money for than Celestia.
00:10:25.660 - 00:11:21.320, Speaker B: But I always kind of had a lot of affection for and felt like a connection to that old lazy ledger name and was sad that it was gone. And then, like, sloths are cute, adorable animals. I've always liked them. I felt like they were, but I think, like, one of the. One of the things that is sort of key to the success of a blockchain is a community tells a story together about why, like, a technical platform, why a technical architecture, why something is possible. And in the early days of cryptocurrency, when I got into cryptocurrency in 2013, you know, it was very, like, that was a very common thing. Like, around, you know, bitcoin, ethereum, you know, different altcoins had their eras, and there was a lot of shared storytelling.
00:11:21.320 - 00:12:04.400, Speaker B: And I think as we've gotten into the world of hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands of coins, it's become a lot harder. Also, it's a lot harder when, you know, your coin just becomes useful for things. Like, it's harder to tell stories and feel an emotional connection when something is just a useful financial object. And I think these pfps can be a mechanism for us to all tell a story collectively about this modular vision, about verifiable computation in a way that's very accessible to people because a bunch of stuff that PhDs, computer science, PhDs understand is not super accessible, but we can all enjoy an adorable swath picture.
00:12:06.200 - 00:12:42.986, Speaker C: Yeah, awesome. I think that hits it, like, pretty well. Like, actually, I think actually, like, slots have, like, slowly, like, became, like, advocates for projects in the, like, modular ecosystem. And I think it's something that it has been, like, great to see because it's something that projects, like, I feel like they really need this because it's, like, the modern ecosystem is amazing. Like, the tech is amazing, but it's very technical and very academic. And it's, like, for me, it's a way to, like, onboard more people who are not necessarily on the modular ecosystem, but are interested in creating crypto or, like, are doing, like, I don't know, like, gambling on meme coins on Solana and things like that. I feel like sloth are, like, a much easier touch point to, like, onboard these people.
00:12:42.986 - 00:13:15.256, Speaker C: And also for, again, like, a stack is set for projects to, like, tell their story and sort of, like, be more relatable within their communities. And I think projects, like, they also, like, really recognize that. And, like, they. They started, like, engaging with us, like, way, way more. And it's been, like, truly, truly amazing to see how, like, that vision, like, comes to fruition. And actually, like, also, like, I feel like one of the things that makes this, like, really good is also, like, the community. They're just so active because they really got, like, all these people, like, riding behind the, like, slots idea.
00:13:15.256 - 00:13:34.340, Speaker C: And, like, now, like, I see many people from here, from many projects, like the guys from stride achilles, from forma. And, like, you can ask them, like, every time they post something, there's slots are gonna be there and, like, they're gonna support them. And it's really something that is super nice to see. And that, I think, also projects, like to have an engaged community.
00:13:35.800 - 00:14:26.490, Speaker D: Yeah, I definitely agree with all of that. I think, for me, what makes this community, like, this love community so unique is, like, this merging of technical people and just anyone who sort of believe in this thesis and this ecosystem. So I feel like there is a very special potential for that to do more than just be pfps as well, which is, I guess, what we're gonna get into later. But, yeah, I don't know. It feels like there's something unique there that's just hard to replicate without it coming organically. Like it has.
00:14:28.630 - 00:14:58.168, Speaker E: Yeah. For me, it's like in civilization 1.0, in like Roman Empire we have like pools, and in civilization 2.0 we have like golf clubs. And right now we have this kind of unchained golf clubs that a lot of important creative or like really technical people join together for some reason and it accelerates some kind of really interesting ideas. And this was my personal experience. Like, we had a lot of interesting ideas around steel productions or other stuff.
00:14:58.168 - 00:15:21.818, Speaker E: And it's really hard to execute some kind of your ideas with other businesses, at least in this industry. But when there is like some kind of community and some kind of motivation and passion, even if it's just a joke, you actually get to integrate with, like for very serious projects much, much faster. And that's really interesting for me, it's like a very interesting phenomenon that is happening.
00:15:21.994 - 00:15:34.990, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that's a really good point. It's a good way for projects to also bootstrap their GTM a little bit more. And also if you want people in your space, lots can actually, I feel like that's also a really good point.
00:15:35.770 - 00:16:25.906, Speaker A: Yeah. My perspective on this is that I think Zucky tweeted out something along the lines of, you know, each major community kind of has its sort of main NFT collection for whatever reason. And I think, you know, for Solana, mad lads for cosmos, bad kids for ethereum, I don't know whether it's penguins or it's crypto punks, whatever. Yeah. And then I think for modular, so far, that's very much sloths. And it's kind of just an interesting pattern across these ecosystems that these, like, the community does tend to rally around one central collection, and it really does provide a new avenue to engage people and attract them. We have the evidence here on stage, like Paco and Girmund wouldn't be here, I don't think, without this loss.
00:16:25.906 - 00:17:32.818, Speaker A: It's brought in all these smart, talented people that were there, but they didn't really have an avenue necessarily to engage. I guess with Celestia, the modular community and slos have been that conduit. So anyway, I want to shift gears a little bit now to the theme of this conference is modular expansion. So I want to talk about lazy expansion and sloth expansion. What's been so cool is that the sloth, I feel like a lot of NFT projects fail because, yeah, they make their collection, they mint a them, but they don't continue to grow and expand the functionality or grow, like, the cultural relevance and things like that. And what's been so cool is that in such a short amount of time, the sloths community has sort of already started, like, taking this on this project. There's, I think, ongoing right now, a mint now on forma for habitats, which is like a new collection associated with this loss, but more, and we can talk about that.
00:17:32.818 - 00:18:08.684, Speaker A: I'm happy to go into that. But what's the most exciting thing to me is this new project called Lazy Chain that's emerged out of this. It's funny because I also remember tweeting after the sloth meant, like a joke, which was like, oh, funny idea would be sloth chain where it makes one block every hour or one block every day or something. Right? And I never thought that someone would actually build, like, a sloth themed chain. But then here we are and we actually have lazy chain. I don't know if the block times are going to be slow or not. You guys can tell me, but let's talk about lazy chain and what it means.
00:18:08.684 - 00:18:52.480, Speaker A: I mean, Zucky is also one of the first people I've heard who talked about this idea of meme chains, like, expanding beyond just meme coins and NFT collections into chains that are sort of meme focused. And it sounds like a joke, but actually I think it becomes a way of, again, adding more culture and making the meme even deeper. It's not just like a coin, it's something that's a whole ecosystem around it. So let's talk about lazy chain. What's the inspiration? What is it? What can people expect? Will the sloth nfts migrate there to have a new home? I don't know. Like free for all, whoever wants to take this.
00:18:56.020 - 00:19:25.304, Speaker D: Yeah, I don't know. I feel like Zakis should lead on this, but, yeah, I think the main idea is to have a modular home for the sloths, a place where experimentation and like you said, where the meme can deepen. I think it will definitely have a way for at least the slots to travel there, as in a bridge there using ICS 721.
00:19:25.472 - 00:19:28.420, Speaker A: It should be really slow, by the way. It should take them a long time.
00:19:28.760 - 00:19:29.480, Speaker D: It really should.
00:19:29.520 - 00:19:30.328, Speaker A: To get there.
00:19:30.464 - 00:19:55.160, Speaker C: Yeah. I think you guys should think slower. I think we could. Of course, this is just a joke, but it would be fun to see a chain with 100 year blocks and you can burn your nfts or whatever that way. But anyway, no, I think so. The way I see, like, lazy chain is I think so. I think with a collection of like 2500 like nfts, you can only reach so many people, right.
00:19:55.160 - 00:20:54.338, Speaker C: There are only like their collection can only be so big. And like with a meme coin, like it's also the same. You can, there's so much you can do with the meme coin and there's just not that much to do. And like this is like a natural cultural extension for like the sloth collection. And also like, I feel like it's a really good avenue for like modularity to onboard, like users that have been like hard to onboard for like this ecosystem as well, which are like more like crypto, like people. Like maybe like more like crypto native people that like, you know, like they like to like do stuff with meme coins, they like to like speculate on things, like they like to gamble and almost like that. So definitely not judging anyone, but it's like, I feel like that this is the avenue to like onboard a lot of people into the ecosystem and it can be sort of like that really like that first touch point and expand the collection without necessarily like diluting it and actively like accruing value to like those like 2500 slots.
00:20:54.338 - 00:21:26.010, Speaker C: And I'm definitely like very excited to see like this, this vision like coming to fruition. And as chairman said, it's like a, it's all like a really big experiment. And I think if we also manage to build a really strong community we already have and expand this, I think it could also be a really good way to support projects building modular with our community and send them to help them with GTM and sort of make it way easier for them to build whatever. Pretty much.
00:21:28.370 - 00:22:19.320, Speaker B: I guess the way I think about lazy chain and in general integrations between slots and the modular ecosystem is imagine if the only way you could engage with slots is kind of like what people have done in the past. Oh, you can have a discord role. You can prove membership of slots. We can engage with them on social media. This is going to run out of steam. Like, there's only so much that you can do there. But what if you can launch an app and like onboard a community of people who are so, you know, Fairblock is trying to, is trying to bring apps to market that show the power of their encryption technology and do it in a way that is like direct to users rather than sort of like b to Dao or B two B sales.
00:22:19.320 - 00:23:20.530, Speaker B: The way sort of infrastructure technologies, like what if you can create fun, engaging experiences? And I think a lot of founders who are building in the modular ecosystem are looking for these opportunities to engage with end users, like infrastructure, technology and crypto in general has this problem of it being many layers buried below users. And the only way in which people really experience it is talks at conferences, they go to a party sponsored by the infrastructure company, but nothing that they can really use. So I think the reason why I have. So there's been a couple of guiding principles for me. One is we are a very long way from having the sloth chain because I think there are going to be many chains. But lazy chain is a great starting point and there's ecosystem of projects that are like right for it. But it's not like we're going to like migrate to one chain and this is going to be like the only chain and everything has to like be there.
00:23:20.530 - 00:24:09.450, Speaker B: That's like not in the spirit of modular expansion. The spirit of modularity is the spirit of abundance, that like an endless number of chains, an endless number of apps, and endless number of experiences and slots need to embrace as a concept this idea. So we do things on forma. We're going to do, we're going to build seed and build out lazy chain. I'd like to do something on initia. I would like to see integration after integration after integration. And what's the point? The point is to continue to give people an accessible place to access this information, like infrastructure, technology, to engage with it, to be excited about it without just treating it as a bunch of, sort of, sort of passionless, like, computer interfaces.
00:24:10.230 - 00:24:11.490, Speaker C: Thanks, Lowell.
00:24:12.390 - 00:24:51.462, Speaker E: Yeah, for me, like, I think for having a long standing, healthy community, like a soccer club, you can have the fans, but you still need the game. You need some fuel to talk about and some jokes. And when you launch an NFD, it's already done. Like you should, like make it alive. Like keep it alive. And the other thing that I found it really interesting was like cryptokitties, because it was the first time that it highlighted the problems, like deep problems that we had in the infrastructure level in Ethereum. It highlighted the MEV problem and it even changed the whole roadmap in Ethereum.
00:24:51.462 - 00:25:26.730, Speaker E: So there is two side of the things. When you have this kind of games, you can make a lot of experimentations, keep the community engage, make a lot of encryption enabled games. Even with cryptokitties, it failed because the breeding algorithm can be reverse engineered so you can encrypt it and keep doing that. But there is the other side of the thing, which is when there's a lot of people engaging with that, it's like inside of your mind, you're thinking about that, you're interacting with that, you're testing that. You actually find out about very deep problems, very technical problems.
00:25:27.270 - 00:26:44.160, Speaker D: Yeah, I feel like the ability to do these things, to me, feels like the core of the modular thesis. To be able to make these experiments, to implement fair block with this and to add all these experiments and games and whatever. Like, if we were to do like the original, the old route with like spinning up a chain with all the full validator set and having to do all that stuff, it just wouldn't be, just wouldn't work out. It would be, it would probably end up with some sort of coin going to zero. And, yeah, I feel like this sort of showcases also like the, like, just the ability for like an NFT collection to spin up the chain, do whatever they want to do with the requirements that they have, be that slow blocks, be that some special integrations, build new stuff that you just can't do anywhere else. I feel like that's just perfect for brings the whole modular thesis into, into reality.
00:26:44.280 - 00:27:04.208, Speaker C: And it's really beautiful to see because I feel like it's something that would not have happened if it was not so easy to spin up a chain, as you're saying, getting all your validators not too lazy. So that's something that is a big catalyst, is also the modular vision, because I feel like otherwise it would be.
00:27:04.224 - 00:27:07.008, Speaker A: Impossible, too lazy to launch an l one.
00:27:07.184 - 00:27:56.790, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, also, I mean, like, I've made a lot of blockchains at this point and this is true. They usually been like multi year journeys to like, even get, you know, I mean, like, I think, like, probably the fastest I've launched a blockchain is like probably under a year from like conception to launch. And I think if we can do lazy chain in like a month, that will be a great demonstration of what is possible. But I think it's also, it's just about, you know, it's also about by like, reducing all of this stuff, we can build blockchains in a much more community oriented way. Like, you don't need a vc round to build a blockchain if you can build it quickly with like, minimal resources. And I think this, like, gets us closer to that community computer vision. Like sort of community computer vision.
00:27:56.790 - 00:28:18.730, Speaker B: And, like, why? I think actually meme chains actually have a really important role to play because they are a way of getting a bootstrapping a community owned platform without like a lot of sort of capitalist fundraising and capital allocation and interacting with capital markets pre launch.
00:28:19.550 - 00:28:55.190, Speaker E: I forgot who mentioned that. But I also found in one of our Twitter spaces, someone mentioned that we can have the ephemeral kind of change. And it made a lot of sense to me because, like, in all of the actual games, like Call of Duty, when you're playing, there's a lobby, there's a temporary server that everyone joins that. So if you want to play a game for a week and it's not, like, interesting anymore, like after that, or if you want have one, voting for the whole community, you don't need to pay for all of the infra costs for like three years for a couple of applications. So that was really interesting point of view that we have never seen in crypto.
00:28:56.450 - 00:29:30.750, Speaker D: Yeah, I think ephemeral chains is a very cool concept. Like, if you have some sort of big mint, nft mint, for instance, you could just spin up a chain for that. If you have some sort of event where you need something like this, you could just spin it up and then shut it down when you're done. I've seen some cool examples of what could be done with that. And, yeah, the modular thesis sort of enables new use cases like that, which just would not be feasible otherwise.
00:29:31.130 - 00:30:15.130, Speaker C: Yeah, I think the use cases are endless. Honestly, what we could do in lazy channels, I feel like the full spectrum is really broad, but I feel like it's just trying new things, seeing what works and also what doesn't. As Sagi was saying, too, maybe during a fair launch and trying to see what's the best way to actually launch a token nowadays, because there's a lot of debate around the topic and I feel like it's not a recipe. It's not like, oh, you do this and it's going to be successful, but it's like, how can we actually try new stuff that might work? Yeah. Like maybe like break things in the process, but definitely learn a lot. No.
00:30:16.150 - 00:31:15.390, Speaker A: Yeah, I think lazy chain to me, kind of as what you guys have just said, is the sloth community and like, the modular community, putting their money where their mouth is, in the sense of like, okay, you know, part of the modular thesis is that it's really easy for anyone to spin up their own chain. It can be a place for community computing, things like that. And, like, we're actually demonstrating that in reality, like putting the money where. Putting our money where our mouth is by launching a chain in a matter of a few months. And so it's really exciting. It's also really cool because Fairblock is also demonstrating not just that it's easy to launch your own chain now on the modular stack, but also that you can customize it and add new capabilities that just aren't possible if you're building an app on a standard monolithic chain. And the sort of randomness and encryption and the things afforded by Fareblock are quite unique in that sense.
00:31:15.390 - 00:31:23.666, Speaker A: Specifically, there's a game that you guys are building as one of the applications on lazy chain. Do you guys want to talk about that?
00:31:23.818 - 00:32:15.726, Speaker E: Yeah, we've made a murder mystery game named Lazy Killer, which is like you can sign in with your sloth and then there's a story. You can read the story and in like normal blockchains when you like, the whole game is unchained. But if you want to implement that in like Ethereum, the problem is that everyone can see your hands, right? So in real world when we are playing games, you don't show your hands, right. There is like some kind of confidentiality. So when we build this game, we are actually encrypting your suspection of the murderer. And once the time that round is over, we will decrypt it on chain and the whole execution is happening on chain. So it's just like one kind of example and we are thinking about other kind of games that we can enable with this kind of logic of surprises or encrypting and unlocking something.
00:32:15.726 - 00:32:17.850, Speaker E: And even with our randomness generation.
00:32:21.960 - 00:32:43.300, Speaker A: Paco, do you have anything in terms of other fun applications that you can see in the near future or also actually tell us a bit about like, habitats and sort of the plan there. Is there going to be an interaction between habitats and sloths? Are you going to respond an actual real physical habitat somewhere?
00:32:44.120 - 00:33:24.484, Speaker C: Yeah. So I feel like there's a lot of. There are a lot of things like coming on that front and also like shout out to like, all the teams that are helping us on like lazy chain? It's definitely been like really, really amazing to see like that vision, like, come into fruition. I think habitats are just like, well, where we. I feel like we made like really, really like top notch art with Steve. Big shout out to him because he really like, the art is like really, really amazing. And I feel like the idea is always to like, you know, like use also like capabilities, like a stacky set to sort of make it fun and also maybe experiment with metadata a little bit.
00:33:24.484 - 00:34:19.174, Speaker C: But of course they're going to play also a big part on lazy chain and potentially we could do a habitat too. Lazy summit, who knows? I feel like the applications that be built on top of lazy chain, I feel like right now they're endless. I would say we were talking to also many teams and they're also excited to try new things. For example, I was talking with the guys from stride yesterday, maybe doing LSD's for creators. We can also do many gamified things. The guys from Fairblock are doing also powered by encryption because I feel like that's something really powerful. You really can't play many, many games on chain now because encryption, and think about it.
00:34:19.174 - 00:34:41.019, Speaker C: If you're playing something like Runescape and you have a lot of gold or whatever, you don't want everyone to see this guy has a lot of gold because it makes you a target, I think that's really powerful. So kudos to you guys on that. And, yeah, I feel like the things that we're going to be doing are going to be very fun and also awesome.
00:34:42.239 - 00:34:53.259, Speaker A: All right, guys, well, we're coming up on the end of the panel. So do you guys have any last thoughts or messages for the sloth community, the modular community at large?
00:34:55.039 - 00:35:35.760, Speaker B: So I guess I think the biggest thing that people should take away from this is slots are not just about airdrops, that there's a larger experiment that is, I think, somewhat unique in terms of where slots appeared in the lifecycle of the project, how slots are being integrated into the general culture of modularity and celestia. And this is a really fun and exciting community to be part of. There will be ups and downs and dramas and all kinds of stuff, but the slot journey is just beginning.
00:35:36.900 - 00:36:08.810, Speaker C: Yeah, I would tell honestly, everyone, I feel like the community has really been amazing and it's what makes this so. I'm very happy for that. And I feel like, yeah, we got a long road to go through. May not to launch the chain, but to make it something really godly unites people and also, like, helps people building in the modular ecosystem. And I think last words, just like, you know, like, well, stay lazy and think slower.
00:36:10.070 - 00:36:33.580, Speaker D: Yeah. I would encourage builders who are keen on joining up with a bunch of other really great builders. I think there's a lot to learn and a lot of fun to be had. Yeah, I think it would be great to reach out and chat about if you have ideas or if not, we have a lot of ideas. So, yeah, stay lazy.
00:36:35.040 - 00:36:48.730, Speaker E: Yeah. For me, it's like an endless area of creativity. We are chatting for weeks and every day we are coming up with a new idea. So I'm pretty excited to execute the new ideas that you'll hear soon.
00:36:49.790 - 00:37:16.296, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, thank you guys so much for coming to listen. We are going to be, I guess, ending the panel now. I think it'd be great to show off your guys sloth jerseys and see, like, the actual pfps on the back, which is pretty sick. So shout out to I think it's Viet and I guess Paco, you guys spearheaded this.
00:37:16.368 - 00:37:19.160, Speaker C: No, no, Viet did almost all of the work.
00:37:19.200 - 00:37:19.440, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:37:19.480 - 00:37:24.500, Speaker C: So I just handed them out, basically. But Viet, big shout out, man.
00:37:24.960 - 00:37:35.416, Speaker B: Viet is the. Is the. Is the one who dreamed up the jerseys and executed them and found the vendor and was super nervous about how they would turn out and they were beautiful.
00:37:35.568 - 00:37:40.140, Speaker A: Yeah. And you ended up bringing Dua Lipa, after all, Fako, right?
00:37:40.520 - 00:37:43.852, Speaker C: Dua lipa or do it two l's. Oops.
00:37:44.036 - 00:37:47.820, Speaker A: Anyway, all right, thank you guys very much. Thanks for coming.
