00:00:02.010 - 00:00:16.794, Speaker A: Hello, everyone. I think we'll be joined shortly by floating Avatar in the universe. Oh, there we go. Hey, great hand. Holy.
00:00:16.842 - 00:00:20.400, Speaker B: Yeah. I hope you're having a good day, Avatar. Sorry, I haven't watched your second movie yet.
00:00:24.130 - 00:00:32.534, Speaker A: It is true that Anatoly does look like he could have been an extra in the Barbie movie, but I don't know what else to say about that right now.
00:00:32.572 - 00:00:37.830, Speaker C: But this is my fame and cosplay for Oppenheimer.
00:00:38.810 - 00:00:39.366, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:00:39.468 - 00:01:13.794, Speaker A: Well, as we learned today, Vitalik prefers Bob the builder. And maybe we'll have Bob the builder next time. But as many of you know, this panel is the Endgame panel. And I think part of this panel actually stems from last year at the last modular summit, which was sort of April 2022. So before Luna, when we were all felt safer, more comfortable, less annoyed at.
00:01:13.832 - 00:01:17.570, Speaker B: People in the world, I felt less safe before the Luna collapsed.
00:01:18.010 - 00:01:42.282, Speaker A: Maybe that's also fair. Safer as in, I think the debate was actually quite different at that time. At that time, I think there was a lot more hype about monolithic architectures, and modular architectures were sort of coming from behind. And I'd say, obviously, some of the stuff that happened the last year made people flip or things change.
00:01:42.416 - 00:01:49.920, Speaker B: The Luna stuff, it had lots of moral lessons for me, but totally nothing to do about monolithic versus modular. So I'd love to hear that case.
00:01:50.930 - 00:01:53.630, Speaker D: I think that's more like app chain versus monolithic.
00:01:54.450 - 00:01:54.766, Speaker A: Right.
00:01:54.788 - 00:02:15.910, Speaker B: But, okay, I guess, to me, Luna was not bad because Luna was monolithic versus modular. Or like on Ethereum versus. On bitcoin versus. On Cosmos versus ursulan or whatever. Right. Luna was bad because it was a fundamentally bad design. Like, the exact same design carbon copied onto Ethereum would have been just as big a collapsible failure, for sure.
00:02:16.060 - 00:02:21.498, Speaker A: I'm more pointing out that at this time, people were much more living in 2021 land.
00:02:21.584 - 00:02:22.634, Speaker B: Okay, this is true.
00:02:22.752 - 00:02:25.702, Speaker A: And that was when I think, the psyche was broken.
00:02:25.766 - 00:02:25.994, Speaker B: Right.
00:02:26.032 - 00:02:33.286, Speaker A: So I just want to say, give some context of the last time we did this. Modular was really the underdog.
00:02:33.398 - 00:02:56.280, Speaker B: I feel like there were a lot of arrows, right? Remember the scene where Boromir just gets shot down by a bunch of orc arrows at the same time? And it's know, first you have Luna, and then you got the Celsius arrow, and then you got the big FTX arrow, and then he's kind of dying, and then there's just like, one extra arrow from, I guess, like DCG or whatever just shoots in. Yeah.
00:02:57.370 - 00:03:01.080, Speaker A: So there's been a lot of arrows. Indeed, more than three.
00:03:01.610 - 00:03:05.090, Speaker B: Well, may all our future arrows be in beautiful diagrams.
00:03:05.170 - 00:03:11.202, Speaker A: There you go. Exactly. Commutative diagrams. Only we're all secretly category theorists.
00:03:11.266 - 00:03:16.860, Speaker B: I don't know. I prefer non commutative. Because we want to have progress, right? We don't want to just go from the same place.
00:03:17.310 - 00:03:35.470, Speaker A: All right, well, clearly there's already even debate about whether anything has changed since last year. So maybe Anatoly and Mustafa, let's start with in the last year, what, in the monolithic versus modular worlds has changed from your minds?
00:03:35.910 - 00:04:20.560, Speaker D: Yeah. So I think one of the biggest changes is a year ago, there wasn't really any kind of roll up frameworks. There was, like, optimism, arbitram, and other kind of optimistic roll ups. But there was no kind of frameworks to kind of create your own roll up. Now we have opstack, we have arbitram orbit roll kit as well. And I think kind of last year, a lot of emphasis was the main reason why you need roll ups is scalability, which is true. But I think what I've realized over the past year is that one of the most underappreciated aspects of roll ups modularity, is that it gives developers more choice and freedom over the execution environments, and that lets you do really cool things that just haven't fundamentally been possible before.
00:04:20.560 - 00:04:54.650, Speaker D: You can modify the EVM and add a ZK opcode so you can do more efficient ZK verification than just graph 16, and that's really good for privacy. Or, for example, Curio has modified their EVM game engine to add their entire game as an opcode on the app stack, which can be fraud proven on their mips fraud proven system. So I think this kind of, like, this flexibility of execution environments is really underappreciated and I think might be just as bigger or as important for impacts of the space as the scalability aspects.
00:04:55.870 - 00:04:57.130, Speaker A: Anatoli?
00:04:58.990 - 00:05:55.578, Speaker C: I think it's been really cool to see the development of roll ups and having them ship and actually seeing their performance numbers. And from my perspective, I've never thought of them as scalability technologies because fundamentally, you're still limited by the bandwidth of the layer one, and if you can't exceed that, you can't really scale beyond that. We can do all sorts of other tricks, but that's kind of like the bottleneck. And when you start scaling that piece, we haven't yet seen folks go beyond what a monolithic architecture that can provide. So I think that's coming. I actually am pretty bullish on things like light clients giving pretty close to better than honest majority assumptions between shards and all these other things. So I'm excited to see for that next iteration in the actual base layer.
00:05:55.578 - 00:06:12.500, Speaker C: But so far from my perspective, actually the main use case for rollups is that like giving new execution environments, giving new ways for devs to build a full game as a fraud provable thing, I think that's a really cool thing.
00:06:13.830 - 00:07:22.054, Speaker B: Vitalik it's interesting because I think pre 2019 Vitalik was fully on board with the idea that roll ups are not real scalability technologies. But then that was when I moved pretty decisively away from that paradigm. If you read my pre 2019 stuff, I was talking about how roll ups aren't real scale because they're not a big o notation improvement, right? I talk about how regular blockchains are OFC, like their capacity is linear in the capacity of a computer, but then shortening is OFC squared, right? But roll ups are of C times somewhere between ten and 500. Right. And for a long time, the mathematical purity side of myself got really hung up on that. But then at some point I was like, okay, yeah, fine, like a factor of ten to 500 is still a big deal, I guess. And at the same time, we kind of exhausted state channels and plasma and all of those things that just realized some of the fundamental limitations that they have in terms of how plasma requires every object to have a logical owner.
00:07:22.054 - 00:08:23.942, Speaker B: And the whole defragmentation problem that I'm sure if Carl Forsch was here, he could tell even more about because they tried to even actually implement that. But basically a gain of ten to 500 x is still a gain. I think it is true that in practice we've been slow on getting there. One of the reasons why is because close to half that gain comes from data compression and roll ups have been pretty slow to actually implement data compression. And there's all of these reasons of like, oh, well, we don't want to have l two nodes, have to be archive nodes and all of these things. But these are issues that can be engineered away and even EVM parallelization, it can be engineered, and there's a difference between sort of solved in your head and hard engineering slog solved. And that's been one of my own big learnings about the ecosystem.
00:08:23.942 - 00:08:39.540, Speaker B: So I think to me, I still look at this from the perspective of what is this going to look like even three years from now, right? Because we're definitely not nowhere close to the frontier of what even currently known approaches can provide, right?
00:08:40.870 - 00:09:32.530, Speaker A: So with that, actually a great thing to talk through. There have been multiple endgame blog posts all over the Internet. But all three of you, I'm sure, have very strong views on your views of what the end game should look like. So maybe, in your own words, define what you think the end game of the technologies you're really interested in should look like. What kind of things should they offer users? What kinds of things should they offer sophisticated actors to maintain them? What should they not offer them? And I think having an eye towards where you really think the long, far future is, I think Vitalik's talk today ended with a very good picture of what he thinks the future is, at least in terms. Know, the big proof, proof.
00:09:34.470 - 00:10:14.362, Speaker B: Mean. Like, my view on the future is definitely that we have proofs now. And I think I've used the analogy that succinct, zero knowledge proofs are to cryptography what transformers are to machine learning or to AI. They're this one single technology that is just so powerful all by itself, that just completely sweeps across decades of hard, application specific work by thousands of talented people and just says, like, okay, bye bye, you're gone, and replaces it with a vastly better alternative. Right. And that's just something that we have to adapt to. Right.
00:10:14.362 - 00:10:51.306, Speaker B: Anything that gets built today should be built with the assumption that proofs exist as an ingredient. And that was not really part of the mindset a few years ago. And a lot of things change when that becomes part of the mindset. Right. I mean, obviously, projects like Mina were, I think, pretty early to that, and had the EVM been conceived even five years later, it would have looked very different. Had, I mean, even the beacon chain been conceived even a few years later, it would have looked very different. Even when the beacon chain was built, it wasn't really built with this assumption of proofs in mind.
00:10:51.306 - 00:11:20.200, Speaker B: And so if we have a world where we can just assume that things can be proven and there's going to be light, like everything that can be computed is going to have a light client of it and all of those things that in some sense simplifies a lot of things, but it still leaves open a pretty interesting design space of what kinds of things are going to exist. And there's a lot of details that you can talk about.
00:11:21.370 - 00:12:41.550, Speaker D: Yeah. So, to piggyback on that proofs aspect, when I kind of think about the end game, I think about what is scalability? I define scalability as throughput divided by the cost for an end user to verify the chain. And so for the end game, I think, how can we maximize throughputs transaction throughputs without increasing the end cost for the user. And that's only possible thanks to taking know data availability, sampling fraud proofs uk proofs. And that should be the case even in the world where decentralized block producers, because you can still achieve the properties of a blockchain, you can still have censorship, resistance and verifiability, even in the world where there's centralized block producers by using things like PBS and CR lists. But to kind of go further, to me, the endgame, I see a world where it will be easier in the future for developers to create their decentralized application by deploying a roll up chain than deploying a smart contract. Simply because in a world where there's proofs, there isn't a good strong reason for apps that are not too directly connected to each other to be sharing computational resources when the computation can happen on their own environment and simply have a proof that it happened correctly.
00:12:42.710 - 00:12:46.420, Speaker B: All right, I think the biggest exception to that is composability. Right.
00:12:48.150 - 00:12:53.250, Speaker A: Anatoly? With that, I think we're ready for your endgame.
00:12:54.310 - 00:13:58.966, Speaker C: Yeah, it's kind of interesting how different it is. So even going into the space five years ago, I always thought that the biggest challenge was the equal and fair availability of the data itself. And this came from my experiences as kind of like amateur trader through interactive brokers and all these other systems. Whenever I had an algorithm that I thought had an edge, my trades would always be a little slower and the data that it would need would always arrive a little later, and I would always kind of lose. And that's because I was playing in an unfair system. And the way that I designed Solana was with this idea that we have a single global message bus, and it tries to propagate all the information around the world simultaneously, as fast as possible at the speed of light. With this kind of like end state being that, imagine some crazy trade event happens in Singapore, that newswire still has to travel speed alight through fiber to a Bloomberg terminal in New York.
00:13:58.966 - 00:14:39.298, Speaker C: But by the time the trader looks at it, a state transition propagating through Solana, already adjusted for price impact. And the price information at Nizi is exactly the same as in a market running in Solana, because all that data is propagating at the same time. So this is a system that I envision back in the day, and this is kind of still what we're building. We're trying to reduce block times from 400 milliseconds to 200 milliseconds. We're trying to make sure that there's multiple concurrent block producers so you can send your transaction to the most geographically closest one. There's competition for map. All of this stuff gets better and better and faster.
00:14:39.298 - 00:15:27.634, Speaker C: And in that world, what's cool is that I think Solana obviously needs to have a lot of hardware to do that, because you're sending a lot of data, you're trying to keep it all together, and roll ups are not going to help you. You're not going to improve that system by splitting up state logically, those effectively create logical shards. And you're not sending information globally to everyone. You're sending information only to some of the folks, which kind of breaks the whole point. But that system that we're building actually helps roll ups. In my ideal world, all of these settlement chains that have roll ups should be all atomically sequenced in this one giant, super optimized, hyperfast synchronizing engine. Right? That's one giant global atomic state machine.
00:15:27.634 - 00:16:01.600, Speaker C: But obviously, we still need trustless computation. We still need to make sure that users that can't afford the hardware have some guarantees about honest execution of these systems. And I think the research in light clients that have been done by the folks like the teams on the stage, has been awesome. And I think in the future, Solana, for Solana to function, it has to have those capabilities as well. But the fundamental problem that I want to solve is that global state synchronization as close to the speed of light as possible, as open as possible to everyone in the world.
00:16:03.910 - 00:16:35.434, Speaker A: Okay, so let's suppose that we end in a world where there's only really one settlement layer, and your chain of choice becomes an l two of the other chain. I only asked this question because Anatoly has been writing a lot of tweets about making east and l two of Salana. First of all, Antoli, maybe you want to explain your tweets, because I personally was very confused when I read them.
00:16:35.472 - 00:17:39.680, Speaker C: But I was trying to create, I guess, a straw man to demonstrate that what an l two is is there's a mechanical component to it, which is a bridge with better than honest majority assumptions that functions. Because all the data that you need to prove that the Smirkle route that's on your l one is correct is also on the l one. So you can then run the fraud proofs. You can basically, or whatever, compute a ZK proof, whatever it is that you need to do, you have all the information to validate the Smirkel route, which the route itself does not have anything else, right? It's just a hash. So that's kind of like you can do that with anything. You can actually take Ethereum l one data right now, dump it into Salana, dump the state route that's computed from that Ethereum data, and then run an optimism style proof to check if fraud has occurred, and then do the bisection and stuff like that. Does that make Ethereum a solono too? Mechanically, yes.
00:17:39.680 - 00:17:42.560, Speaker C: Socially, no.
00:17:43.830 - 00:19:06.134, Speaker B: One reason why is because there's the saying that the sovereign is the one that decides the exception. And in blockchains, the exception is bugs and 51% attacks. And the question is always like, what happens if Ethereum hard forks, for example? Right? If Ethereum hard forks, then there is a few possibilities. One possibility is that the Solana Bridge, and if we assume that it's a perfect ZK bridge, then according to the old ZK rules, the Ethereum chain will just start being invalid, and that bridge will just basically create its own version of basically its own Ethereum classic 2.0. Right? But then the question is like, well, what do the assets follow? Right? And realistically, in this case, the assets would follow Ethereum, right? But if you get into a world where the majority of assets are rooted onto Solana and then bridged onto Ethereum, then that would look very different. Or another world in which. And in that case, then Ethereum would not actually be capable of hard forking unless there is some kind of on chain governance, right? Or a possible third world would be a world where the assets are all based on Solana.
00:19:06.134 - 00:20:14.914, Speaker B: But at the same time, the Solana community is willing to hard fork whenever Ethereum is willing to hard fork, right? And in that case, that's like a construction based off of some sort of more deeper version of on chain governance. And in that case, you would still be able to call Ethereum and l two, but it would be part of this ecosystem where things are basically willing to be part of the governance of each other. So I think you basically just have to look at what happens if one chain or the other chain gets 51% attacked. And what happens if one chain or their chain gets 51% attacked and the community decides to do a user activated soft fork to kill the attackers, right? So not like an easy slashing hard fork, but like a censorship hard fork, where the community responds by picking the minority chain. And on the minority chain, the majority would have to either skip being on that chain or get slashed. And if they skip being on that chain, then they get leaked. Yeah.
00:20:14.914 - 00:20:17.380, Speaker B: And then what happens in that case? Right?
00:20:18.150 - 00:20:36.278, Speaker C: So the thing is, though, that there's always going to be subset of users that are hardcore cipherfunks, censorship resistant maximalists that will always pick the right hard forks. They will always fork Salana and Ethereum towards the right state. So the real one is inside of.
00:20:36.284 - 00:20:51.206, Speaker B: All of us, then this gets into yet another theater of the debate we've been having since 2015. Which chain is the real Ethereum? Who here thinks Ethereum classic is the real Ethereum? That's some good bravery.
00:20:51.398 - 00:20:54.138, Speaker A: That's way higher than I expected, I'm going to be honest.
00:20:54.224 - 00:20:56.738, Speaker B: Who here thinks bitcoin cash is the real bitcoin?
00:20:56.854 - 00:21:45.790, Speaker D: Yeah, I think this kind of gets to the beat of how you define l two and so on and so forth versus what's a side chain. But those definitions aside, I still think it's an interesting proposition, or useful to have a validating the bridge between Solana and Ethereum would be validating, because most bridges between trust zones are not validating, they just have a committee based assumption. But if the Solana bridge to Ethereum at least verified the Solana state, Vi ZK proof or fraud proof, and then even if the DA wasn't on Ethereum and the DA wasn't on Solana, and there's a committee assumption, I think that would at least be, as far as I can tell, the same security properties as a validium or an optimistic chain, which is kind of like a much better scenario for a multi chain ecosystem.
00:21:46.130 - 00:22:43.550, Speaker A: So one thing that did come up in all of these answers to whether it's possible for one settlement layer to usurp another one and make it an l two, is the role of governance in these futures, in the modular or monolithic futures. And so I think we've seen a lot of different variants of what qualifies as governance. I think choosing a hard fork, following certain people, is a sort of weak form of governance. We just heard John's talk about don't even. I haven't fully processed, because it was spoken at high speed, to be honest. But I think. Where do you view the role of governance in your preferred modality towards the end game? How minimized is it? How important is it? Where is it necessary? Where is it only sufficient? Where is it non necessary?
00:22:44.530 - 00:23:24.894, Speaker D: Yeah, I really feel like this upgrade thing, roll up upgradability is the kind of the core nuance there's been a lot of debate about. Kevin from optimism, is arguing that all roll ups are sovereign. And there's kind of a very controversial statement. And the reason why he argued that is because he argues that, well, all roll ups can just, the community for roll up can just upgrade a roll up. Ultimately what a roll up is, is what the community defines that roll up to be. Not the bridge. But I think there's some interesting nuanced questions about how do we have upgradable roll ups while keeping the security properties of a roll up.
00:23:24.894 - 00:23:38.686, Speaker D: The only kind of way I know of doing so is to have an upgrade delay and allow users to mass exit, which is not clear, if not clear, how practical that would be in an actual practical scenario.
00:23:38.878 - 00:25:05.182, Speaker B: Yeah, this is a tough choice, right? Because I think right now L2 roll ups are, I guess there's like two camps, there's sort of the more activist side. And if you're on the more activist side, then I think the safe and responsible way is to choose a delay number. And you could be somewhere between 30 and 365 days probably. And if an upgrade happens, and if you're not happy with the upgrade, or if governance gets taken over by evil people and the upgrade involves stealing your money, then you just have to leave, which is good enough for most users, but it's not good enough for really long term applications that want to base themselves on that roll up, right? And then on the other side, I know scroll, for example, really values the idea of neutrality and sticking to Ethereum principles and kind of seeing itself as being an extender of Ethereum land and something like that, might be willing to say, hey, at code level we're not going to be willing to deviate from anything but being a copy of the protocol spec. And if they do that, then it takes away that risk for applications. But then it also opens up this interesting question of if Ethereum itself upgrades, then how would scroll end up copying that? And then this gets into protocol questions. This is one of those things that's controversial within the Ethereum research team.
00:25:05.182 - 00:26:40.054, Speaker B: Even there's some people that are in favor of enshrined roll ups or an enshrined roll up assisting pre compile. Basically imagine a pre compile that just does EVM validation and it just does whatever EVM validation means during the specific block. And maybe you could let it do either the current hard fork or the previous hard fork, and then in the back end clients would just implement that by waiting for whatever their preferred ZKeVM proof is, for example. Right? And if you do something like that, then you can preserve that tight coupling for the projects that want to do that. And then if you don't do something like that, then L2s would basically need to have governance on chain governance for the sole purpose of keeping, at the very least for the sole purpose of keeping up with whatever layer one does, right? So that's one of those trade offs. And then obviously the other side of this is this kind of underexplored class of crazier ideas where someone creates a layer one, where that layer one is intentionally willing to be more activist and basically hard fork in such a way that even L2 assisting L2 is with hard forking along with those kinds of changes. There's a big set of possibilities in off chain governance.
00:26:40.054 - 00:27:33.034, Speaker B: There's obviously a big set of possibilities with on chain governance as we see it. And especially once you start properly moving away from the coin voting stuff, and then there's like a whole set of debates about use cases of governance, like are you protecting against hacks? And that's it. Are you improving the protocol? Are you doing public goods funding? Right? And then if you do public goods funding, then do you do it kind of by enshrining an on chain mechanism, or do you do this kind of like retroactive off chain thing the way that zcash does? Right. It's like every four years they basically, as far as I could tell so far, they decide who the top level public goods funders are and then they do a hard fork to give them the block reward and then that gets revisited every four years, which is kind of cool in its own way.
00:27:33.072 - 00:27:33.178, Speaker A: Right?
00:27:33.184 - 00:27:39.614, Speaker B: And Zcash has made the choice to be more interventionist than Ethereum and bitcoin are. But yeah, I don't know, it's a big design space.
00:27:39.652 - 00:27:56.420, Speaker D: But do you think there's a way to allow roll ups to have upgrade mechanism with the same security properties as a roll up, but without coin voting and without enshrining that roll up into the l one? Because that's one of the reasons why some people are interested in sovereign roll ups, right.
00:27:57.030 - 00:28:14.950, Speaker B: I guess the challenge with sovereign roll ups is like if you start using any assets where those assets are not registered within that roll up, right. Then it's like, well, for those assets that you can't be sovereign, right? Unless you have more activist off chain governance.
00:28:15.030 - 00:28:34.114, Speaker D: Yeah, for sure. But I think even though l one is truly sovereign, like you have USDC and USDT, which is kind of like a non sovereign bridge between Ethereum and circle or tether. So it's definitely sovereignty is a spectrum. There's definitely trade offs though between sovereign roll ups and non sovereign, right, that is true.
00:28:34.152 - 00:29:00.838, Speaker B: I mean, you definitely could have tried to get every application to have separate instances on all of the different roll ups. And so you don't even cross roll up kind of bridged assets don't exist anymore, and then everyone could be sovereign. Well, if you do that, though, you would not be able to. ETH would not be usable on roll ups. Right, because ETH is by definition home. Ethereum. Yeah.
00:29:01.004 - 00:29:03.450, Speaker A: Antoly, any thoughts on governance?
00:29:05.630 - 00:29:41.334, Speaker C: The major problem are zero days. All these systems are too complex to not have some really fast path to upgrade and deal with a zero day bug. That's kind of like the end of the day. I don't know how long it's going to take for us to construct something that is so simple that everyone agrees this can be upgraded with a 30 day delay. We're okay with that. And if you have a fast path for zero days, you're kind of introducing honest majority assumptions. And I think that's mostly fine if that's what we're dealing with.
00:29:41.334 - 00:29:59.194, Speaker C: I think we then have to be very careful about how we construct those majorities. Should they be like well known security firms, et cetera, et cetera. Kind of the proof of governance talk, I think went into a lot of those considerations, but I think it's really tough to avoid those.
00:29:59.312 - 00:30:46.406, Speaker B: I think a couple of nuances on that. One is you don't technically need a fast path to upgrade. You need a fast path to freeze and an arbitrarily slow path to finalize whether or not you're going to upgrade. And then the other thing is, I definitely do not think that upgrade buttons should merely be a majority. Right? If it's merely a majority, then whatever proof system you're doing technically has no votes. Right? And I think you need to have at least a 75% threshold. The thing that I've been pushing for in the stage one definition, obviously, but I do think that being greater than 50% is important, because otherwise it's mathematically true that the code itself has no votes.
00:30:46.406 - 00:31:14.340, Speaker B: And then, well, the other thing is, I guess one of the ways that the Ethereum ecosystem is doing this is they are doing this kind of like inversion thing, right? I know some of the roll ups want to do this, right? They want to have multiple ZKeVM implementations, and then the Security Council only gets activated if at least one of them disagrees with the other, or something like that, which is, I think, an interesting path too, as long as the implementations are being built independently enough.
00:31:16.390 - 00:32:04.210, Speaker A: Yeah, I think at some level it seems like everyone thinks that there is some necessity of governance at the bare lease, bare minimum. But it may be sort of, to summarize, like in some ways synchronizing multiple chains in the case of the modular world, or in Anatoly's view of the world, kind of response measurement. Now, maybe let's take a tiny detour. Imagine you had to come up with a complement for the architecture that's the opposite of the one that you like. You had to find something really favorite. Your life depended on coming up with a really good compliment for the other architecture. What would you say to your fellow developer?
00:32:04.870 - 00:32:57.778, Speaker D: Speaking of Solana specifically, the way I see it is that Anatoly and Solana are trying to build. The way I see it is scalability ultimately has trade offs between scalability and composability. Even ethereum centric roadmap. You have some liquidity, fragmentation of, say, like optimism and arbitrarium. But the way I see it is like Solana is trying to see how much throughput we can get as much as possible without any composability sacrifices whatsoever. That's why Anatoly doesn't see roll ups as a scaling mechanism, because it defeats the properties of the system he's trying to create, which is basically, as I understand the vision is like decentralized version of the New York Stock Exchange. What I do appreciate about Solana is that they've made some great advancements in kind of execution.
00:32:57.778 - 00:33:24.510, Speaker D: Know the parallelized execution environment. That's a massive improvement. And I appreciate that Solana is actually taking trust minimization a bit more seriously. Over the past year, there's been some work and proposals over trying to create light clients and implement fraud proofs for Solana, and even some proposals to see how we can add data availability sampling to Solana.
00:33:27.170 - 00:33:45.720, Speaker B: I appreciate that there's a strong technical team, and I appreciate the willingness to just say, here's some set of use cases that kind of we understand, we're passionate about, and we're going to basically optimize and be willing to make tradeoffs to do the best that we can for them.
00:33:46.970 - 00:33:48.150, Speaker A: Antoly.
00:33:50.090 - 00:34:18.270, Speaker C: Well, I think the data availability sampling and the whole fraud proof construction is like beautiful design. It's awesome. And that actually, I think, came out of the research of both of the teams here. So pretty cool. And the really cool thing is that everything's open source. As soon as those folks had really good ideas, I was able to understand them and start thinking about how apply them to the Solana stock.
00:34:20.930 - 00:35:04.286, Speaker A: If we fast forward to kind of applications that you find interesting, either within ecosystems that you're working in, or sort of maybe even in the other ecosystems. What are some applications you're interested in in 2023 and 2024 that will be used? I think a lot of ECC this year, at least from my perspective, has been quite a bit of infrastructure, seeing a lot of updates on how certain proving systems are working, understanding how those developments have moved on. But we do at some point have to have to find some other applications on them. Obviously, you all probably have tons of examples of these that you're most interested in. What are they?
00:35:04.468 - 00:35:50.382, Speaker D: Yeah, I think in the short term, there's kind of like being some really crazy progress in gaming, kind of roll ups. Curio managed to kind of run a real time strategy game with a 0.5 2nd tick engine using a modified EVM that adds part of their game as an opcode. And there's other stuff like August and other teams are working on interesting game engines now. I don't think gaming is the kind of ultimate purpose or the most real world case of crypto, but I think historically, what we've seen, even in computing, a lot of advancements in computing has come from gaming. For example, the concept of sharding actually originated from gaming. So, yeah, I'm just kind of interested in following those developments there.
00:35:50.382 - 00:35:56.800, Speaker D: And I think in the long term, they will have significant impacts on applications outside of gaming as well.
00:35:58.850 - 00:36:34.874, Speaker B: I kind of want the OG application to come back. I want people to pay for coffees with ETh. Remember back in 2013 when this was the big thing? And I remember this was actually the very start of my bitcoin trip around the world where we would have. I went to Boston and I went on a pilgrimage to veggie galaxy and Thelonious monkfish, because those were the two restaurants that accepted bitcoin. And then we had the bitcoin Keats over in Berlin and York. Platster got like ten restaurants in a block to accept it. I want that culture to come back.
00:36:34.874 - 00:37:01.300, Speaker B: And I think a big part of the reason it died is obvious, which is like, fees got too high, but the original pitch back then is like, hey, this is cheaper than PayPal. But then it stopped being cheaper than PayPal, but with roll ups it actually will be again, which is amazing, right? And I would love to see some of those amazing OG things that we did back then, come back now that the ecosystem is starting to be ready for them.
00:37:02.150 - 00:37:14.146, Speaker D: I think that will definitely happen. We're seeing banks already using USDC for settlement. I think that will eventually be exposed to the end user. Like, it's being used on the back end, but it will eventually be exposed to the end user.
00:37:14.258 - 00:37:20.310, Speaker A: I'm impressed. None of these applications so far have had any advanced cryptography.
00:37:22.490 - 00:37:23.990, Speaker B: The payments, privacy preserving.
00:37:24.070 - 00:37:26.886, Speaker A: Okay, anatoly.
00:37:27.078 - 00:37:57.606, Speaker C: Yeah. I would say, like, simple things like payments and defi. I guess Defi can be very complicated, but I think both of those really serve the two fundamental things that crypto provides, and that's self custody and this idea of a global source of truth. Right. For pricing or the ability to transact. I think those are very transformative at scale. If you have everyone in the world that now has cryptographic keys that they know can move value around, everything else can be built on top of that.
00:37:57.606 - 00:38:25.440, Speaker C: Like, real world governance, right. If everybody knows that we can all communicate and coordinate with cryptography, we can actually build very quick, fast, global political movements that can take on action and solve real world problems. But the foundation is that cryptographic base of users that get self custody, get what they're doing. They know what this thing means. So, yeah, the simple things. I'm on Vitalik's camp.
00:38:27.890 - 00:38:34.900, Speaker B: Know we are in France, and Defi is the french word for challenge. Okay, fine. It's pronounced Daisy, but, like, come.
00:38:37.750 - 00:38:56.120, Speaker D: Like more generally. Also interested in experimentation around dows and kind of, like, form ways of organizing people on chain. There's a lot of different kind of proposals. Defi, refi, disco Daos. I'm kind of, like, excited to see how that goes as well.
00:38:56.650 - 00:39:09.526, Speaker A: My last question, which is a false trichotomy, but you have to pick an answer anyway, which is Barbie Oppenheimer, or you think it's really bad that we're lionizing Oppenheimer via a movie?
00:39:09.718 - 00:39:11.322, Speaker D: Actually, it's Bob the Builder.
00:39:11.466 - 00:39:14.750, Speaker A: Sorry, I forgot Bob the builder. I forgot Bob the builder.
00:39:16.610 - 00:39:58.620, Speaker B: I want to see the crypto space come up with its own epic. We've had songs, right? Remember there were bitcoin songs back then? There was that love you like. Like a bitcoin parody. That continues to be one of my favorite songs to this day. It's actually good as a song despite being a parody, I think. Didn't Simon de la Riviera write a novel at some point? That, yeah, I would love to see just us come up with a movie that uses themes from top that we care about, but is actually good as a movie at the same time.
00:39:59.310 - 00:40:10.078, Speaker A: I unfortunately saw that there was an online tv show about SBF, so maybe that's not the right type of movie, but that is coming out. It's an animated short.
00:40:10.164 - 00:40:13.120, Speaker B: I see. It's an Oppenheimer for a different cause.
00:40:13.490 - 00:40:14.240, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:40:14.850 - 00:40:16.240, Speaker B: The price is definitely.
00:40:18.690 - 00:40:24.900, Speaker A: Anatoly. I mean, you look like you're ready to be in the Barbie movie, so you got to have some opinions here.
00:40:25.830 - 00:40:30.390, Speaker C: This is me cosplaying famine, so definitely Oppenheimer.
00:40:31.610 - 00:40:46.580, Speaker A: All right, well, thanks, everyone, for joining us. It's been a great day of talks. We talked a lot about the public broadcasting system of the US. I mean, sorry, proposer builder, separation. And hope you have had a good week in Paris and enjoy.
