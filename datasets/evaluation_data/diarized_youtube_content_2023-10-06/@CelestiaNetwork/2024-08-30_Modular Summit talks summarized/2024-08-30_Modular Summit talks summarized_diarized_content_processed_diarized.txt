00:00:00.240 - 00:00:16.377, Speaker A: I watch every single talk from the Modular Summit and there's a ton of Alpha across three days, 57 hours worth of content and 157 videos. You're missing out on a lot. So this video is going to save you a lot of time. It's a summary of every single Modular Summit talk, what I've learned, and if.
00:00:16.401 - 00:00:17.697, Speaker B: Any of these pique your interest, you.
00:00:17.721 - 00:00:44.579, Speaker A: Can watch them on YouTube. So now let's get started with day one. Chisel stage unification solving L2 fragmentation with Avail Nexus. This isn't a talk about Avail's data availability layer, so watch this if you're interested in their proof aggregation to solve L2 fragmentation called nexus. Next up we have Modular Expansion. The Celestia Technical Roadmap by Ismail Coffee from Celestia. This is a nice talk around the big three problems in crypto.
00:00:44.579 - 00:01:15.151, Speaker A: Blockchains don't scale, they're not verifiable and bridging sucks. And what's on Celestia's roadmap to solve it? So Ismail talks about fast blocks and slow squares, light node security upgrades and lazy bridging with ZK accounts. Next up is ensuring data availability in layer 2. Scaling solutions by L2 beat. This is a really good overview of roll ups and the risks. They talk about the two types of roll ups, they talk about da, DA layers and das, and they talk about all the trust assumptions. So watch this if you need a good primer.
00:01:15.151 - 00:01:47.991, Speaker A: Next up is a panel. The Future of Data Availability. Now, most panels, people say the same things and agree with each other. But when you put the big names from each DA layer, we're talking Mustafa representing Celestia, Toggle from scroll representing ETH blobs, Prabal representing avail, Nemo representing avail DA and all moderated by L2beats Bartek. Things actually get decently spicy. I would watch this one if you're particularly interested in DA technology. Next up is the State of the Modular Union by Mustafa Al Basam.
00:01:47.991 - 00:02:18.413, Speaker A: This is more of a refresher, so if you want to see the past, present and then progress of the modular ecosystem, watch this one. Next up we have the Age of Aggregation. This is a 101. Talk about Polygon's AG layer, aka proof aggregation, which is going to be a reoccurring topic throughout the Modular Summit. So watch this if you're not up to speed with proof aggregation. Next up we have Stylus Bridging the Multivm to Arbitrum by Ed Felton. This one is on Multivm wasm based Execution and why it's better.
00:02:18.413 - 00:02:50.057, Speaker A: Watch this one if you're interested in VMS developer experience and execution. Technical talks. Next up we have how ZK VMs are upgrading the modular stack. This one is a must. Watch if you don't know what ZK VMs are, that's all I will really tell you but I highly recommend Next up is Client Monogamy Settle down and Marry One Already by James Preswich. Watch this if you think client diversity is important because James can prove you wrong. I like how this is just a realistic talk and how unpractical and expensive client diversity is.
00:02:50.057 - 00:03:33.359, Speaker A: Next up we have Putting super in Super Chain Op Stack Interoperability. This is a talk about interoperability and the optimism ecosystem and more specifically the technicalities of the multi cross rollup fraud proof system. Next up we have Elastic chains from Zksync. This is a talk about cross chain interop in rollups but unlike the optimism talk, this is under ZK rollup contracts with ZK Proofs with their AG layer like system which they call the elastic chain. Next up we have Virix fortifying decoupled state machine replication. This is a very technical talk and Avalanche is a consensus heavy project. Watch this if you're into consensus protocols because this is pretty relevant to all of them.
00:03:33.359 - 00:04:07.925, Speaker A: Next up we have Blended execution by Dyno Eggs from Fluent. The Arbitrum stylus talk was more technical while this one is more on why and a high level talk about wasm based VMs. So you might want to watch both of those and compare the two. Next up we have Beacon Kit by devbaar from Bear Chain. This is one that I actually sat through IRL and I really enjoyed it. Got to ask devbar some questions afterwards but this wasn't a talk about proof of liquidity. Watch this if you're interested on the EVM Identical execution on Comet BFT implementation which they call Beacon kits.
00:04:07.925 - 00:04:41.455, Speaker A: This is pretty cool stuff. Next up we have Embracing Modularity, the future of Blockchain innovation by movement. Watch this to get a good overview on the smart contract language of Move and then why Movement specifically and its architecture. Next up we have a fireside chat with Mustafa Al Bassam and Laura Shin. There are very little talks that fall in the category of Everybody, no matter who you are should watch and this is one of them. Mustafa gets into his hacker days, the inspiration from Satoshi and Ethereum to make Celestia. This one is a must watch.
00:04:41.455 - 00:05:46.431, Speaker A: So now we just finish up the chisel stage and now let's Go on to day one Canvas stage and first up we got is Unlocking Liquidity for the Modular Economy. This is a talk around the success of Ethereum, its high liquidity, capital efficiency and liquid staking usage and how its success was dependent on strict staking and simple ux, but how the modular ecosystem has the opposite with UX fragmentation and native delegation being too easy. So then the founder of Drop Protocol, Mitya Argonaut, talks about how to unlock liquidity for the modular economy. Unlike the previous panel which was about the future of DA with people who sell da, this panel was about people who use DA and ask questions on why they moved to Celestia and all the factors that roll ups have to consider. Next up we have Discover the Infinite Frontier Search the unified multi chain and multi VM world. This talk is on the inevitability of the multi chain and multivm world and how Dora the Block Explorer Unif simplifies all this into one on chain search engine. Next up we have Introducing Exchange os.
00:05:46.431 - 00:06:33.923, Speaker A: This is a talk on the evolution of modular infra and how centralized exchanges are monolithic, they have high risk, low transparency and require trust and how Exchange OS's modular architecture makes it an unruggable exchange. Next up we have Dark Rollups by Henry de Valance from Penumbra. This talk explores the shielded design space into dark rollups. So DA in a modular system assumes visibility and in a shielded monolithic system they're separated. Henry talks about how shielded privacy works and it's by separating the execution and the visibility for only the users to see. And he talks about the design space and how modular systems and monolithic shields may not be so different. Next up we have Roll Ups in the Wild by Andrew Huang from Conduit.
00:06:33.923 - 00:07:14.087, Speaker A: This talk is about how roll ups can save your startup the practicality and then goes through a story about an on chain game called Pirate Nation which transition from Polygon to Arbitrum to an arbitrum L3. Lots of talks are theoretical, technical or far out into the future and this one is about a real story. Next up is a panel from Apps to Chains. This is a nice realistic conversation from the people who run applications. We have Andrew Hong from Conduit, we have Mike Spain from Lyra, we have Griffin from Halday and it's all moderated by Ben Rodriguez from Coinbase. I like him, he's funny. And they all talk about the realities and why applications move to roll.
00:07:14.087 - 00:07:50.685, Speaker A: Next up we have the Lazy Application Thesis by Jacob Arlock from Celestia. So The FAT protocol thesis was blockchain platforms like Ethereum would gain all the value, but then Solana apps like Pump Fun, Radium and Jito earn more fees than the protocol itself. Solana which shows the shift from the FAT protocol thesis to the fat Profit era. But not everything should be constrained to Solana, the SVM and Anchor. Which brings us on to the lazy application thesis. Next up we have Solving Native Asset Issuance in a Modular ecosystem. This talk is all about Nobu.
00:07:50.685 - 00:08:30.775, Speaker A: First is why a blockchain should be dedicated to asset issuance. Then Yelena at Modular Summit announces Euro Stablecoin and then she talks about the user experience and the technology used to solve fragmentation for stablecoins. Next up we have Exploring World coined user activity and the journey to the world chain. This talk is on why worldcoin their goals and getting there. So it's all the mistakes of building for payments only and then them gaining tractions and users which wanted more than just payments. How worldcoin was taking up a lot of Optimism's block space and working towards their own roll up world chain. Next up we have learning of L2s by Gelato.
00:08:30.775 - 00:09:13.887, Speaker A: Watch this to see the data behind why Gelato thinks there's going to be more L3s deployed, more usage of alternative DA layers and chains not settling on Ethereum. And then they talk about where the features headed with more purpose specific roll ups, chain abstraction and roll up clusters. Next up we have a panel on sovereign roll ups. This is a technical panel on what exactly are sovereign roll ups versus settled roll ups and then it talks about the differences with smart contract or the opposite of sovereign roll ups settled roll ups. They talk about bridging to sovereign roll ups and all those nerdy technical details. I like this one. Next up we have native intelligence through compute specific networks.
00:09:13.887 - 00:09:55.755, Speaker A: So for crypto x AI you need either beefy centralized nodes or a slow and expensive nodes. But you can get the best of both worlds with compute specific nodes. You have nodes which are specialized for the blockchain which means they're small and stateful and the ML AI part is ran on beefy AI powered stateless nodes. Watch this talk to learn more about this project called Valance. Next up we have real time rollups and bitcoin security. Can we have both? I personally watch this one live. This is about Stargaze's roll up called Astra and how it's optimistic but it doesn't have the 7 day waiting period allowing for instant withdrawals aka a real time rollup.
00:09:55.755 - 00:10:27.431, Speaker A: And it also talks about rollup, native yield and using Bitcoin security. Next up we have a fun panel called Sloths and Lazy Chain. This panel is all about the Celestine Sloth Society and Lazy Chain. This panel is light hearted and fun so it's a must watch if you're into the sloths. Next up we have Milky Way, a modular staking hub. This talk is on how Milky Way got started into liquid, staking their progress and then them getting into restaking with their special operator specific model. And then last but not least we have Ritual talk.
00:10:27.431 - 00:11:07.959, Speaker A: This is about the use cases of Crypto x AI. It talks about why you would even need decentralized AI, the current usage and then the the future of it. To be honest I don't know that much about AIX crypto, but this was pretty interesting. A good example is how they gave an AI chat bot like ChatGPT a wallet with like real money inside and then had people convince them to invest in their friend tech keys. And that is all for day one Chisel and Canvas stage, but we still have two more days to go. Now we're on to day two Chisel stage, starting with a user's journey of an app developer. In designing an app Roll up, Cartesi goes to the design space of a rollup and the specific route that they chose.
00:11:07.959 - 00:11:58.579, Speaker A: Cartesi is really powerful so they use the more complex Risk zero and it's an app specific rollup because their rollup is literally running Linux. Cartesi is really cool and this is a nice overview of the rollup design space. Next up we have Defund the Dealers the Past, Present and Future of Liquidity in this talk, Ethan Buckman gives a history lesson about medieval financing and how they had the idea of clearing debt obligations and how modern banking only gives us privileges to a few big banks. Defund the Dealers is about Instead of paying dealers to exchange value cycles, money does the opposite, allowing anyone to clear out their debt obligations. That was just a small slice, but I highly recommend this talk. Next up is a panel protocol Researchers Meet Applications with users. This panel is with researchers of Ethereum at the infrastructure level and developers of Ethereum at the application level.
00:11:58.579 - 00:12:56.013, Speaker A: We have Ken from Uniswap, we have Yisi from Mask, we have Matt Katz from Caldera, Makoto from ens, Ansgar, and Vitalik from Ethereum foundation, all moderated by Tina from Flashbots. Tina asked about the original vision of Ethereum versus today's roadmap and it's mostly unchanged. But Vitalik talks about one of These original ideas was also having Ethereum provide decentralized storage. The applications later talk around the immutability of smart contracts, how liquidity is moving off chain, the MEV implications of all that, and then the future role of Ethereum. Next up we have a fireside chat. How is the app chain thesis different between Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems? This panel is with the co founders of Ethereum and Cosmos, Vitalik and Ethan Buckman and their ecosystem's largest Dex, which is Ken from Uniswap and Dev from Osmosis. This panel was about the app chain thesis and Cosmos versus how it compares to the application specific rollups of Ethereum.
00:12:56.013 - 00:13:31.937, Speaker A: It was a little bit of a Cosmos row session and they talk about the expensive price of sovereignty and the trade offs of composability. But I highly recommend this talk. Next up is the big talk from Vitalik, Ethereum as a platform of platforms for Dapps. Vitalik compares the growth of Ethereum from the past 2010s versus the new 2020s. It shifts from infrastructure only being about the L1 to moving to L2s, applications being from pure financial to more diverse use cases and then wallets being strictly seed phrases to more hybrid multisig systems. It's a talk from the one and only Vitalik Buterin. Go watch it.
00:13:31.937 - 00:14:24.203, Speaker A: Next up we have Layer twos as extensions from Ethereum and Mauna talks about the idea that rollups should be extensions of Ethereum and not just users of them. They should push and align themselves with Ethereum's values instead of just acting as their own ecosystem. Instead Ethereum rollups should be the united rollups of Ethereum and acting and feeling as if one large ecosystem Next up we have Protocol MEV capture by Jonah from Blockchain Capital. Jonah first defines MEV and then shows how MEV is captured. This is a research chalk around Ethereum's architecture against the MEV games and the type of games that are being played and captured. Next up we have how to reason about the contagion risk within the modular stack by Tarun from Gauntlet. Tarun talks about auction markets and matching markets and how modular systems are matching pieces together and are all part of matching markets.
00:14:24.203 - 00:15:22.343, Speaker A: Then he talks about these risks, the attack vectors and then the incentives of the modular stack. Next up we have a panel called FAT Applications, Protocols, Middleware or Operators. This panel consists of Visconti from Z Prime, Justin Drake from the Ethereum Foundation, James Preswich, Ben from Expresso, all moderated by Jacob Arlock from Celestial Labs. This is a Nice debate over the FAT protocol versus FAT application thesis and the future of it. They talk about value accrual commoditization of block spaces and how obese Ethereum should be and then which part of the modular stacks are likely to be reintegrated or centralized. Next up we have The State of MEV 2024 by Yuki from Cereal Labs. Yuki gives a nice overview of MEV today, the types of MEV like sandwich attacks, arbitrage and JITs where all this MEV profit is split and the future of where all this MEV is going.
00:15:22.343 - 00:16:06.761, Speaker A: Next up we have Gas Matters new resources of base fee volatility. So you have all these things happening on chain, that being private transactions from altruistic block builders and MEV boost built blocks. Private altruistic blocks are typically underfilled making the base fee go down and MEV boost blocks are typically filled all the way making the base fee go up. Matt Colette talks about the latest research in the shift from the base volatility fee going towards MEV boost. This talk is really technical but also cutting edge. Next up we have It's All Resource Pricing by John Adler from Celestial Labs. John Adler talks about the resources of a blockchain, the markets on which they are priced, and how different systems have different methods.
00:16:06.761 - 00:17:09.187, Speaker A: He goes into Ethereum's old single market, how Ethereum now has a compute and DA market, how Solana has state rent and how modular systems have DA markets like Celestia and Ethereum and separate markets for execution being roll ups. And so as users interact with blockchains by betting on their resources, you realize wait, it's all resource pricing and John Adler says it's always been. Next up we have base roll ups are based for choice rules rule. This is one of my favorite talks and I had a pleasure to watch it live. Evan talks about centralized block builders goal to maximize profits at the expense of the applications and how base rollups don't need multisigs, inherit censorship, resistance and control their own resource pricing and fork choice rule, which means base rollups can control their own ordering and even hard fork. Next up we have MEV in 2025 by Shia from Flashbots. MEV auctions need to be fast, private and decentralized, but cryptography is private and decentralized but too slow.
00:17:09.187 - 00:18:19.423, Speaker A: Centralized builders are private and fast but not decentralized and public mempools are fast and decentralized but not private and later talks about how trusted execution environments tees perfectly solve all three. Now this talk is less around TES individually and more about the implications of them with mev. That's TE builders, relayers and searchers. Next up is a panel called what Application Innovation can Block Building, Solving and Sequencing Uniquely Enable. This panel goes to the impact of PBS and mevboost and intents and solvers and how if these truly unlock new applications or just enhance the ones that already exist. This panel is pretty infra heavy with dmars from Flashbots, Josh Bowen from Astria, Marcus from Propeller Head, Dan Elitzer from Descent, and all moderated by Hart Lambert from Across Next up we have how to win friends and TE fluence people. Ethan Buckman talks on why people constantly shill te's which by definition are trusted execution environments and so Ethan will try to convince you about TE's so ZK is not private in a global setting.
00:18:19.423 - 00:19:11.561, Speaker A: NPC is too expensive and has no collusion resistance and FHE is expensive but NPC can help out. Te's uniquely give us privacy, performance and affordability, but they aren't perfect. So Ethan goes through the techniques on how to mitigate some of these downsides. Next up we have the TE stack by Andrew Miller from Flashbots and Cycles. TEs have their caveats, but they're also these cool black boxes that give privacy to anything inside of it and can be used for every part of the stack and just make applications naturally better. Andrew Miller goes through the stack of the blockchain and explains on how to fortify each layer with tees. Next talk is modularity EE control your information flow so you have this valuable order flow but there's a lack of efficient on chain auctions which means auctions get pushed on chain which leads to MEV spam.
00:19:11.561 - 00:20:17.963, Speaker A: The current options are 1 embrace the MEV fee market 2 play these extremely unpractical games or 3 allow apps to integrate but have opinions on what MEV is acceptable. DMARS talks about applying tes to all part of the stacks to give us more control and privacy on the flow of information. Next up we have unlocking a new dimension of application designs with TE stack. This talk is about the unique properties of TE's and how applications can unlock Web3 levels of composability and programmability in a traditional Web2 account and then he gives a demo on how they can help with secure and private coordination. Next up is a panel OpenDE, a first step towards the ideal chip for crypto. This panel addresses the TE elephant in the room, their vulnerabilities, the trade offs and then the ways to solve them it has Michael Gal from Fabric, Andrew Miller from Flashbots, all moderated by Tarun from Gauntlet. This is a nice talk because it talks about the smaller details about TEs from a builder of one of these chips and a user of it.
00:20:17.963 - 00:20:46.379, Speaker A: Next up is the panel the Metagame. Every modular summit has this big endgame panel. This one has Ethan Buckman, Mustafa, Andrew Miller and moderated by Tarun. Anatoly, the founder of Solana wasn't here. So this panel was about the Metagame. This was sort of a check in and review on the different types of blockchain architecture and how overall they're coming along, their progress and then the apps that are coming forward. This panel every single year is definitely a must watch.
00:20:46.379 - 00:21:40.171, Speaker A: Next up on day two we have the Canvas stage, starting with the Broken Record, a framework of music and power. Lore talks about the Broken Record being the old overly complicated middlemen filled music industry and how modular blockchains for music could fix all these problems and empower and actually pay artists. Next up is a panel creator Tooling in the Modular Era. This panel has Jana Bertram from Rari Foundation, Shane from Stargaze, Bernie from Pixel Wizards, all moderated by Achilles from Celestia. This panel was about creator tooling and why creators choose certain NFT platforms. They talk about how NFTs were niche and unknown to then OpenSea being known by everyone and then in the bear market, how these dying platforms switch from artists focused to trader focused, how a lot of NFT platforms remove creator royalties to increase volume, and how Rari Chain and Stargaze kept those royalties. This is a really good talk to understand the NFT marketplace industry.
00:21:40.171 - 00:22:14.833, Speaker A: Next up we have a Lens Fireside chat. Laura Shin interviews Stanley Kulachov about Lens Protocol. Stani is the founder of the largest lending protocol Ave, but also founded Lens, the open social media network. Stani talks around why you even need a social network in the first place, how Lens Protocol initially caught traction on Polygon and their decision to move over to their own roll up on ZK Sync. Lorshin is a legendary interviewer and Stani is a defi og. This is a pretty good talk and watch this if you don't know what Lens Protocol is. Next up is a talk called Tools for Scaling Conspiracies.
00:22:14.833 - 00:22:46.159, Speaker A: This one was pretty refreshing with a very cool concept. Baz describes a digital speakeasy which helps communities scale. We all have our favorite online communities which got too big and then lost the thing that made them special. Imagine keeping these communities open for anyone to join but verifying into these digital clubs and communities with on chain actions and proofs. This is a talk I didn't know I would like until I watched it. Next up is the Recipe. Alexander is one of those experimental creatives that has been playing with Ethereum NFTs and on chain games for a long time.
00:22:46.159 - 00:23:29.263, Speaker A: He talks about his hard transition from an indie dev to an on chain dev, the philosophical role of fun and play and how sometimes you actually want to lose and how that ownership is boring when games are supposed to be fun and not about value. He then talks about new possibilities in digital worlds with virtual tourism and donating through gameplay. Next up we have a talk about From Artworks to Art Chains. This is a great talk about NFTs going beyond monkey pictures and price tags. So art is valued holistically and it's about the spiritual space in which it exists in. But standalone NFTs fail because the only comparison you can have is through rarity, which is through more expensive Monkey Pictures. Essentially, NFTs just don't give off aura.
00:23:29.263 - 00:24:06.471, Speaker A: You need a setting in which they exist to have some significance and this is the concept of what our chains can offer. Next up we have Forming the Anime Industry with Anime Chain. This talk is about how we're living through a modern anime renaissance and everything around it, from the media to the fan base to the community is growing and how Azuki partnered to bring anime IP on chain using Arbitrim stack called Anime Chain. If you like anime, go give this talk a try. Next up is a panel Forma, the first Sovereign Arch chain. This panel is about Forma, sovereign rollups and arch chains. We have Jorphdan which represents Astra, which uses Forma as a shared sequencer.
00:24:06.471 - 00:24:46.911, Speaker A: We have no Sleep John representing Hyperlane, which bridges TIA to Forma. It's moderated by Achilles, which is the NFT lead of Celestia who helped start Forma. And then we have Sam Hart from Skip. He's been curating art in New York and has been in the experimental NFT space long before it was cool. This is overall a good talk around Forma's infrastructure, sovereignty and art chains. Next up we have Building fully on chain gaming for the masses. Daniel's been fascinated with on chain games since 2021 and he goes through his lessons as he levels up from the early failures and experiments to the experience of chewing glass as a game dev to then finally the success and the direction of the industry.
00:24:46.911 - 00:25:20.843, Speaker A: Next up we have How Geo localized sharded roll ups redefine the future of On Chain compute. So no roll ups and even the fastest industry leading ones can actually support on chain games because they're still too slow. Games historically push the medium and that medium is compute. We couldn't imagine mobile games 30 years ago and on chain games are no different. But roll ups need to be performant. So Scott talks about Argus and its high performance geo localized roll up shards building compelling composable games. This talk is about the composability of on chain games.
00:25:20.843 - 00:26:03.423, Speaker A: So we had this indie dev golden era powered by this new accessible tools and how on chain games might be close. You're able to have these deep complex games and have communities mod them and then with these rich community made worlds you can join games together and bridge items into new ways of play. Next up we have thinking outside the box. Bitcoin brought the idea of digital scarcity and Ethereum brought programmability. But due to the constraints these first set of entries, chain games and experiments like cryptokitties died out. But using stark next technology, Cartridge builds tools around easily making low latency dedicated and cheap on chain games. And then Terence teases some games that are in development that are using cartridge.
00:26:03.423 - 00:26:10.223, Speaker A: Next up we have minimum viable game chain Validium. Trifle Labs is still in self, but this talk is probably the best overview.
00:26:10.279 - 00:26:12.111, Speaker B: Of the benefits of on chain games.
00:26:12.183 - 00:26:34.685, Speaker A: He talks over the current not fun state of these games and the constraints of the infrastructure to make these games in the first place. Then Billy Renacop shows a live demo of a game that is fully on chain and runs in the browser and how this game fits the proof and transaction constraint size. Next up we have zero friction, happy users, happy chain. What if everyone could use the chain? This project is called Happy Chain because.
00:26:34.765 - 00:26:36.685, Speaker B: On chain games suck and they're hard.
00:26:36.725 - 00:27:23.555, Speaker A: To play and make. What if on chain games had zero friction, simple onboarding and users don't have to worry about gas? Norswap talks about why on chain games in the first place, why they suck and the experiments that are being ran on Happy Chain. Next up is a panel autonomous worlds and bespoke execution environments. This panel is with all the previous speakers from the past talks. So North Swap from Happy Chain, Terence from Cartridge, Scott Senardo from Argus Labs, Billy Rennekamp from Triple Labs and it's all moderated by Brahm from Maven11. So this panel is with a whole bunch of season on chain game Devs and NFT OGs. So this is more of an advanced talk around on chain games with AI bots interoperability like the Metaverse move your sword to another game sort of example.
00:27:23.555 - 00:27:41.381, Speaker A: And why NFTs haven't succeeded because of the technological and cultural gaps. And then finally at the end their hot takes. Next up we have Creating a Decentralized Autonomous Artist. What if AI was the artist? No, not just AI that makes the art, but its itself would make the.
00:27:41.413 - 00:27:42.765, Speaker B: Decisions of an artist.
00:27:42.885 - 00:27:55.845, Speaker A: Decisions like the type of art it would make, the prompts it would make thousands of random AI generations and then a DAO would rate it to give a meaning and then sell it to fund and make more art. This talk is around an interesting AI.
00:27:55.885 - 00:27:58.365, Speaker B: Experiment that has been running since 2021.
00:27:58.445 - 00:28:20.749, Speaker A: Called Bato, the decentralized autonomous Artist. Next up is a Talk called After NFTs Network Art in the third era. This talk is pretty weird. The speaker goes by one one three. He's an anonymous artist without a presentation. It's just audio of him speaking. 113 talks about how we're entering a third era of art and cryptography.
00:28:20.749 - 00:28:32.725, Speaker A: How physical art was gay kept by physical places and institutions, but now that place is the Internet and we should take it seriously as the ultimate art city. And how cryptography can be seen as.
00:28:32.765 - 00:28:34.141, Speaker B: The new art supplies.
00:28:34.293 - 00:28:46.013, Speaker A: And how any artist can make art about society's problems without being gay kept or censored. How this era could pay artists fairly and how even this digital art could live longer than the artists themselves.
00:28:46.109 - 00:29:11.121, Speaker B: Now we're on to day three, Chisel stage. Starting with why developers are building modular, not monolithic. Mads from Maven11 talks about this meme against modularity, but building modular actually makes sense from multiple angles. He talks about the customization and specialization, the ownership and upgradability, scaling and cost reductions, security and risk management and innovation and future proofing. So those were just five quick bullet points from the talk, but skeptics should.
00:29:11.153 - 00:29:12.145, Speaker A: Go watch the full video.
00:29:12.225 - 00:29:20.249, Speaker B: Next up we have modular anonymity network. Harry Halpin from NIM talks about the importance of mixnets. The Internet wasn't exactly designed to be.
00:29:20.297 - 00:29:22.473, Speaker A: Secure or anonymous, but we can add.
00:29:22.529 - 00:30:10.731, Speaker B: Additional hops, noise and latency to unlink our IP address and add anonymity. And he talks on how Celestia could use this for unlinkable data availability samples. Next up we have Deimos fixing E to E encryption using Celestia. This was one of my favorite talks because it's about a new actual application that solves a real world problem. So Telegram, iMessage, WhatsApp and even Signal pride themselves on privacy, but your messages aren't 100% private and all end to end Encryption isn't trust minimized so your messages are encrypted, but in order to talk to someone else you rely on a key directory that the service provider manages. Then Ryan talks about demos, which uses Celestia to have a trust minimize verifiable key directory. So this means not only are your messages encrypted, but you can verify through the key directory who you're talking to.
00:30:10.731 - 00:30:42.943, Speaker B: Next up we have Sovereignty is all you need Nick White and his modular mullet talk about devs hierarchy of needs, how devs crave to control all parts of the stack, and this craving is called sovereignty. From technical dependence to social independence. Sovereignty gives you complete ownership, but there are downsides of lower composability, increased complexity and cost. But he explains, through the modular mullet we can provide abstraction, bridging and DA layers can lower cost Next up we have Sovereignty vs Globalists by Adrian Brink from Anoma, and this one was one.
00:30:42.959 - 00:30:44.367, Speaker A: Of my favorite talks because it brings.
00:30:44.391 - 00:31:08.205, Speaker B: Up just so much great points. Bitcoin wouldn't survive World War three because global fiber and satellite would likely be cut off. So even if we build for a large global decentralized network that's still is one centralized network that isn't World War three proof. Then Adrian emphasizes the importance of sovereignty, local networks and running your own infra. Next up we have a panel on EVM vs. SVM vs. ARM vs.
00:31:08.205 - 00:31:25.041, Speaker B: Blended. This panel is about which VM is the best from infrastructure that uses each. We have Keoni from Monad which uses the EVM Eugene Chan from Ellipsis that uses the SVM Dimitri from Fluent that is Blended. Chris goes from a NOMA that uses Intense and all moderated by Rex from Blockworks.
00:31:25.113 - 00:31:28.625, Speaker A: But first, before they even duke it out, they ask themselves what even is.
00:31:28.665 - 00:31:37.897, Speaker B: A VM in the first place? And then they have a debate on which VM is the best and what developers want. Next up we have Don't Buy the Hype. John Cole from Hyperlane talks about how.
00:31:37.921 - 00:31:39.745, Speaker A: Modular is hot right now and how.
00:31:39.785 - 00:32:20.933, Speaker B: Contrarians love to hate the hottest thing. But he says you don't need to buy the hype and you can see it for yourself. John goes through the modular expansion, the statistics, the amount of rollups launching, but also how they're fragmented and how Hyperlane can help to connect them all. Next up we have rebuilding rollups by Zon from Initia. Zon talks about initiative L1 role for its L2s and how they can support and align their L2s through their vested interest program. He explains the VIP mechanisms on how they measure engagement and give out rewards, how the rewards are distributed, and three projects that are launching L2s on Anisha. Next up we have Hyper Bitcoinization through Modularity by Orkin from Citria.
00:32:20.933 - 00:32:54.715, Speaker B: Orkin goes through Hyper Bitcoinization, how inflation's eating up your money, how Bitcoin is superior, and how Bitcoin will be the global reserve value. But Bitcoin can't scale by itself, so Citria is making a Bitcoin execution shard through modularity. Next up we have is Bitcoin going Modular by Eric Wall from Taproot Wizards. Eric Wall talks about Bitcoin NFTs through ordinals, tokens on Bitcoin through runes and proving that the lightning network can scale. So then he talks about the new direction of Bitcoin using something called opcat. Next up is a panel. Bitcoin goes Modular.
00:32:54.715 - 00:33:23.055, Speaker B: This panel has Orkin from Citria, Rena from Trust machines, Connor O'Hara from Celestial Labs, all moderated by Andy from the roll up. In this panel they talk about Bitcoin being more than just a store of value. They go through the modular tech like BitVM and OPCAT and then talk about how bitcoin maxis and whales and OGs and the overall community will feel about this new direction. Next up we have Magic Block Engine Mephrial roll ups for real on Chain games on Solana.
00:33:23.175 - 00:33:26.631, Speaker A: I'm not that big of a fan of Solana, but this is super cool.
00:33:26.743 - 00:33:51.343, Speaker B: So a big problem with rollups is, yes, they're fast, but they're not composable. So Magic Block built a Mefrio rollups. There are rollups that get quickly deployed on Solana. They offer high performance that can be used in games. And then just as fast as they're deployed, these roll ups can get deleted and users don't even know they left Solana. That's how fast and composable these newfriel rollups are. Then we're on to day three Canvas stage with the bridge endgame.
00:33:51.343 - 00:34:02.991, Speaker B: Liquidity for Infinite Chains by Jim Chang from Catalyst. Jim talks about the future of a million chains, but we must avoid modular chaos and go into modular enlightenment. But when we launch these new roll.
00:34:03.023 - 00:34:04.103, Speaker A: Ups, they're completely empty.
00:34:04.159 - 00:34:36.867, Speaker B: So we need to import liquidity and bring solvers. But solvers are centralizing because of the high inventory cost. And Jim explains on how Catalyst's netting helps solve this problem. Next up we have thinking outside the chain. How Clearing layers can solve modular fragmentation Arjun talks on how Everclear helps with bridging and chain abstraction by thinking outside the chain. Instead of making another interoperability messaging protocol, they instead built solvers with netting. This netting lowers the amount of liquidity needed for solvers, allowing for more solvers to compete in this clearing layer called Everclear.
00:34:36.867 - 00:34:45.263, Speaker B: Next up is a panel on chain abstraction and the modular mullet. The panel has Chris Goes from Anoma, Carel from Union, Philippe from Lifi, Rishabh.
00:34:45.279 - 00:34:47.847, Speaker A: From Stockit, Stan from Initia, moderated by.
00:34:47.871 - 00:34:54.319, Speaker B: Yuri from Signature Ventures. This panel is about chain abstraction first, why and what it is and then.
00:34:54.367 - 00:34:56.583, Speaker A: How chains will be abstracted, its impact.
00:34:56.639 - 00:35:26.143, Speaker B: On applications from financial to non financial. And if we've pushed for all this efficiency, does this lead to more centralization or a standardized tech stack? Next up is chain abstraction Chewing Glass to a Better Blockchain Ecosystem by Zach Manion from Occlusion. Zaki goes through the way developers chew glass to make applications and then he goes down the list of problems and current developments for asynchrony, coordination, interoperability, custody incentives and governance. And then he gives his abstracted vision.
00:35:26.199 - 00:35:28.823, Speaker A: On how users will interact with blockchains in the future.
00:35:28.919 - 00:35:36.495, Speaker B: Next up is lowering consensus confirmation times by Dev from Osmosis. This is a nice technical talk on how to lower confirmation times.
00:35:36.575 - 00:35:38.895, Speaker A: Dev talks about how to improve tendermint.
00:35:38.975 - 00:36:03.657, Speaker B: On shifting pre confirmation responsibilities to intents and geolocalized DA layers with provable DA ingestion. As a tendermint enjoyer I love this talk. Next up we have Blowing up Modular Toll Booths by Barry Pluckett from Skip the dream of every protocol is to be a black hole squid in the middle of networks that collects high fees from having a monopoly, whether it's interoperability, intense solvers or bridging oracles.
00:36:03.761 - 00:36:05.137, Speaker A: Barry talks on how we can kill.
00:36:05.161 - 00:36:10.545, Speaker B: The space octopus using Go Skip Build. Next up is solving interoperability with Cross chain.
00:36:10.585 - 00:36:12.585, Speaker A: Intents Heart talks about the problem with.
00:36:12.625 - 00:36:51.417, Speaker B: Interoperability is sending messages from chain to chain to prove you're able to move this money. This process can be insecure, expensive and slow. He explains that the biggest use case for interoperability is cross chain transfers and like in real life, intents can have off chain actors which take all this risk and front money for faster transfers. They can bundle lots of transactions together lowering the fee for users and users just don't have to think about it. This is how across provides chain abstraction using intents. Next up we have the network layer for Interoperability by Bodu from Polymer. Bo talks on how the Internet has local networks called LAN and global networks called WAN and the structure mimics L1s and L2s.
00:36:51.417 - 00:37:17.805, Speaker B: The Internet uses TCP IP and now we have the verifiable Internet with blockchains and we use ibc. BO then talks about Polymer Hubs which route messaging between Rollup's local intranet and global Internet using the Inter Blockchain Communication Protocol, AKA ibc. Next up we have Light Nodes Everywhere why and how by Connor O'Hara from Celestial Labs so light nodes are cool because they let you verify data availability with just your phone and there's pictures.
00:37:17.845 - 00:37:19.357, Speaker A: Of people showing them off all around.
00:37:19.381 - 00:37:51.615, Speaker B: The world, but the point of them is to be boring. Everyday security measures like the padlock icon. We don't know what cryptography it's using for what security, but we do know it makes it more secure. And Connor talks on how we can make a light nodes even lighter and embed them to everything. Next up we have Scaling between the Layers, Unlocking Boundless Compute and the Next Generation of Verifiable Applications by Stephen Lee from RISC0. Stephen talks about RISC0's ability to boundlessly prove any rust applications with ZK. This means you can write normal applications in Rust using normal Rust libraries.
00:37:51.615 - 00:38:41.823, Speaker B: It doesn't have to be a blockchain Specific smart contracting language Building a dex in solidity on Ethereum and then redeploying it on rollups is tedious, but instead you could just build an exchange like you normally would and use Risk zero to prove any and multiple chains. Next up we have Giving a Verifiable Database to Every Smart Contract by Ismail from Lagrange. Ismail talks about Lagrange as a ZK Co processor For verifiable databases. Smart contracts need to access data, but calling on chain data is expensive. But using Lagrange, smart contracts can query about any database. A ZK proof is generated, then a smart contract just easily and gas efficiently verifies this proof about this data using Lagrange's ZK Magic. Next up we have Nebra UPA ZK Broadband Unlocks Scaling, Privacy and Interoperability by Shomo Chu from Nebra.
00:38:41.823 - 00:38:52.217, Speaker B: Shomo talks about the universal proof aggregator upa. So proofs have all this use case but they're expensive to verify. No one's going to use this technology if it costs twenty dollars to pay.
00:38:52.241 - 00:38:53.441, Speaker A: For a two dollar coffee.
00:38:53.513 - 00:39:32.449, Speaker B: But Nebra can aggregate all these different types of proofs using their aggregator circuit. This unlocks better UX by having cheaper interoperability, cheaper transactions and privacy. Next up we have a panel Shielded Assets in the Modular stack with Henry from Penumbra and Connor from Celestial Labs. This is just a straight up shill on privacy and Penumbra and Connor asked questions about their stack. They talk about the development pains of integrating IBC with their custom Merkle trees, the process and philosophy of building Penumbra and then they dive in into the features like the Dex private proof of stake and liquid delegation. After listening to this I am Penumbra pilled. Next up we have one proof to rue them all.
00:39:32.497 - 00:39:34.057, Speaker A: Mina's Proof of everything.
00:39:34.161 - 00:39:41.321, Speaker B: Brandon talks about Mina's blockchain being upside down. Using ZK proofs they prove the last blocks of validity together with the new.
00:39:41.353 - 00:39:43.401, Speaker A: Block to prove that the latest block.
00:39:43.473 - 00:40:25.035, Speaker B: And all the ones before it are valid. MENA was built with this recursive ZK proofs in mind, which means you're able to add more proofs, compose them together and make one proof to rule them all. Next up we have signal vs noise why AI broke the Internet and How Cryptography Is Going to Fix it by Tracy from Pluto. AI is making it hard to go through what's real and fake on the Internet. Tracy talks about Pluto's approach using a privacy preserving web approved this gives users more control over their data and this applies to the whole Internet and not just blockchain. This allows you to exit systems and move your data, prove your identity and sell anything like a tweet by generating a web proof. Next up we have ZK Accounts by Nashq from Celestial Labs.
00:40:25.035 - 00:41:09.719, Speaker B: Nashq talks about the power of ZK accounts so Celestia is lazy and doesn't want to add additional computation or complexity like Smart Contract. ZK accounts allow for Celestia to do complex things in a trust minimized fashion. Watch this talk to learn how it works, the proving mechanism and all of the use cases. Next up is a panel ZK Applications with Anush from ZKE Email, Florent from Proof of Passport, Tracy from Pluto and it's all moderated by Anna Rose from ZK Validator. This panel is about ZK Applications and their adoption. They talk about ZK email identity and Proof of Passport and web approval and the application's use case and unlock allowing you to prove your identity, allow verification and messaging without leaking your privacy. And that is it.
00:41:09.719 - 00:41:12.615, Speaker B: The last talk of the last day of Modular Summit.
00:41:12.695 - 00:41:13.535, Speaker A: Thank you so much for watching.
