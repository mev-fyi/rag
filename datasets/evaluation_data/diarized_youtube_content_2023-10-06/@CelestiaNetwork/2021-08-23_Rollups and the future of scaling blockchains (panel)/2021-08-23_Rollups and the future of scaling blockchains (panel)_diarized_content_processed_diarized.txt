00:00:00.250 - 00:00:02.894, Speaker A: Panelists, except we are now joined by.
00:00:02.932 - 00:00:12.080, Speaker B: Acidone Komfi, who's the CEO of Celestia. And the moderator of this panel is Nima from Polychain. So, Neema, take it.
00:00:17.250 - 00:00:18.320, Speaker C: Thanks man.
00:00:19.170 - 00:00:23.774, Speaker D: So yeah, but before we dive into.
00:00:23.812 - 00:00:26.694, Speaker C: Something more superintendent, I want to start.
00:00:26.732 - 00:00:41.670, Speaker D: Off with side chains and polygon. So if we're seeing this availability happen with side chains that are being deployed, why do we need to get it? Why do you have some availability.
00:00:48.650 - 00:01:53.070, Speaker B: Is that has a much weaker security assumption, much bigger security model than robots, for example, with ETH assets on polygon transfers. Between ETH and polygon there's this bridge that relies on a few mock diversity, basically a mock my SIG wallet with a few less than ten probably signers. And those signers could potentially steal everyone's funds of Python if they were to pollute. So far that doesn't happen. But I think it's a very short term solution because we're seeing hacks on protocol all the time and it's only a matter of time before users realize it's not a good situation. And users will want more security for their funds because in the long term, it's more and more likely that the attacks will happen on the bridge because it's using a multi safety.
00:01:56.370 - 00:02:38.458, Speaker C: I fully agree. So it has two interesting sides. One side is that if you have more funds in the side chain than the state, you actually have full incentive for the validators to exit camp just to steal all those funds, especially if they believe that the token valuation as speaking is not going to allow. So it's just that doesn't make sense. It's not a stable mechanism. In blockchains we build stuff based on incentives, based on game theory which incentivize the right behavior. And here people behave like against their best interest, essentially.
00:02:38.458 - 00:03:16.700, Speaker C: But the second aspect is that it's notoriously hard to protect hotkeys on servers and you need them for something like a side chain. You need service to be online and store the keys in the memory of the service and you only need to have a few of them in order to steal all this content. And this is very hard. And it also provides possible vulnerability or like it can be in the central administrators of the service or administrators of the cloud centers, like data centers that provide the hosting for them, can do the hub or can neglect their duties and then so on and so forth. So it's very shaky to say that.
00:03:19.630 - 00:03:40.400, Speaker A: I think that, as you both said to just summarize, is that we need decay wallets or optimistic wallets to provide similar scalability like something that Polygon provides right now, but without compromising too many compromises on security.
00:03:41.570 - 00:04:29.650, Speaker B: And also I understand to end user they can't see security, so we can't rely solely on security. It has to be other incentives to use robots. And at Celestial we're trying to create incentives other than security, even though a very strong incentive. And I genuinely believe that if we make it possible to deploy robots or make it possible to deploy your own blockchain as easy as it is smart contract and then not only will that be more secure but will also be the preferred way. Because it's simply easier to create your own execution environment but create your own chain than be bounded by the very tight constraints of the EBM.
00:04:30.150 - 00:04:43.670, Speaker D: Yeah, that doesn't make sense. So still on top of security with Gords Unsupervised model, what failure scenario do you see that could happen? Potentially?
00:04:47.290 - 00:05:15.002, Speaker C: I can start a little bit. Lots of things can go wrong. So we have to remember that this is all very new technology. Geralds have been in production for a year. Optimistic rollouts have not been in production ever. And there will be bugs, there will be problems and security vulnerabilities and people will find them and will go through a number of things and we should just expect that. So we should not rely on a single line of defense.
00:05:15.002 - 00:06:14.050, Speaker C: We should be layering our defense with multiple things. We should do a lot of stuff like bug balances, automated bug balances where we boil some honeyboard and let people crack at them and other things like maybe insurance in the beginning to test the things out before they add to scale, before they become the alternative. The only way to ensure that something is really secure is if it's been in production for a long period of time and it's not been half, then the system can billions of dollars, one, two, three years that you can probably trust it, but if you make a small change in the system you can already introduce. This is very interesting in interview question like how you deal with the upgrades right now but expect rewards and just like be ready for it. Don't put too much money in any of those systems.
00:06:16.570 - 00:06:39.450, Speaker A: I would like to add just additional thing that is specific to how roll ups are deployed right now is like if you have like a centralized sequencer in both cases like decay roll ups or optimistic roll ups, it makes it easier at least for short periods of time. Maybe it makes it easier to center or like halt the network.
00:06:40.690 - 00:06:42.142, Speaker B: So that's why I think it was.
00:06:42.196 - 00:06:50.590, Speaker A: Important that the world of chains are actually like real PTP network and real chains are not having one centralized sequence.
00:06:52.550 - 00:07:41.786, Speaker B: Yeah, my broader philosophy on this is that I don't believe code is on blockchains. I believe that the purpose of blockchains is to function as a social coordination layer. So we talk about layer one, but there's also a layer zero, which is social consensus. Like every time I do hard for Ethereum, you have to get social consensus from layer zero. And to be on protocols you have to get social consensus from layer zero. And back in 2016 when there was this massive Dow hack on ethereum, you have to go back to schedule consensus and the Ethereum community agreed to hard fork effectively and reverse the act. And I think that's perfectly fine, but it's not ideal.
00:07:41.786 - 00:08:34.830, Speaker B: If you create a smart contract in Ethereum, you cannot expect for the entire Ethereum ecosystem to hard fork just because your specific smart contract was hacked. But that's why I think with the model that we're trying to create as a nest here where you have these specific roll ups, you can go back to the social consensus of that specific roll up and hard fork without affecting directly all the other roll ups. There's still the issue of how do you deal with the cross train bridges between roll ups and other roll ups. But in the case of optimistic roll up, even though optimistic roll ups have a longer one week withdrawal period, in some way that provides advantage because it provides the ability for the special consensus to go back, special consensus have some time to do some actions, to agree to change the rules.
00:08:37.270 - 00:09:36.126, Speaker C: If I may add to this, I agree on the issue of layers during social consensus. This is indeed what she has before. But it can be a dangerous role if we rely too much on social consensus, especially in the absence of stability mechanisms. If system is meta stable and doesn't have a stable state and then you say oh, it's going to remain stable because we know that we will always realize successes in the end. This can be very dangerous with the Dao situation. I think you might better off if the incident, if the precedent was not set with immutability and instead we remain for example, there was the software which led white hack hackers to get mine back, not all of it, but significant portion. So Ethereum would be much better off without the fork and just going this path with software.
00:09:36.126 - 00:09:48.902, Speaker C: In my opinion, we should preserve political as much as possible. But of course with the final source of powers, people, they decide what law is that.
00:09:49.036 - 00:10:19.650, Speaker B: Yeah, sure, we don't disagree that. I think the point is that just because we have this social consensus, the whole point of blockchain is to reduce the cost of social coordination. And that is why you should make sure your protocol is incentive and crypto economically secure. The point is to reduce the chances of having the social consensus there rather than relying on social consensus. Go back to it in the west.
00:10:26.060 - 00:10:43.790, Speaker D: Yeah, one last thing to bring up before we switch it back to the data attention to this is how on chain option governance happens. Do you have any specific thoughts on how that can be basically influenced by.
00:10:48.960 - 00:12:05.976, Speaker B: Depends what you mean by on chain governance. If you mean like pezbox style on chain governance where 51% of the coins can change the rules for virtual, I think that's interesting. But that's not something I would advocate for myself because that basically creates like a rule. Like they're saying that the rules of the chain should be decided by whoever has the most happening. Whereas the point of what change for me is that the rules of the chain the point of what I see is that a 51% attack or this other majority of validators in the chain should not be able to change the rules of the chain. And that's why users need to independently validate the transactions of the chain to make sure that all transactions are valid. But if the position has to trust the bot producers but if the bot producers are allowed to change the rules of the chain, it's not necessarily invalid, but it changes some of the key values that I think are more.
00:12:05.976 - 00:12:29.250, Speaker B: I think it's okay to have on chain government for indications. But ultimately, you should rely on offshore and central governments and for the actual stakeholders in the community. Not necessarily weighted by law, but weighted by informally important. I think an area governance strategy is very real because of how informal A KFC is.
00:12:31.140 - 00:13:21.900, Speaker C: I have to agree to this. I think there is a use case for launching governance, for things like Taos where people want to say you want to manage treasury and this treasury you have really the majority of those who will decide what to do with it. But not at the metal level. Not changing the rules of the economic itself for the reasons which stuff described. And also I think it's really beautiful what we have today with blockchains that are portable in that blockchains are inherently anarchic and voluntary assistance. Everyone who participates in blockchain does this because they believe it is better for them to participate. There's no merci.
00:13:21.900 - 00:13:59.404, Speaker C: If you don't like the rules of this chain because you don't like this particular branch with this particular community you can always fork away introducing your rules or not accept the change proposed by the majority and you just succeed and you have your own community and then you participate there voluntarily with zero corruption anywhere. So in a situation where we said this cast where the majority can impose the rules on everyone else, this beauty disappears all of a sudden it's a majority rule system which is very different. Again, people are free to experiment with that and they can always work even.
00:13:59.442 - 00:14:01.230, Speaker A: If the majority doesn't like it.
00:14:03.520 - 00:14:27.796, Speaker C: No one can prevent them. I can always work at least and just build my own system which functions in different ways. So in a way it is like 51% rule changing is just a statement, it's just a narrative. It's not like technically forceful but philosophically I think it's better to just articulate it out here. That gives us the point in which.
00:14:27.978 - 00:15:50.240, Speaker A: Version I just want to briefly add to what Mr said that there is this middle ground where on chain governance could very much look like in the cosmos model where you have like on chain signaling policy. So it's not like in Tesos where you vote and then on chain enforced or something like this, but instead you just vote with the token. And I'm actually the end of this for Celestia, we want the base layer to be as UN opinionated and having as little execution as possible. So if we decided to go with the Ethereum model and not do any on chain governance there, the beauty of the system is that you could actually have governance rollout where you can do the signaling on there and you could actually even tie it to the token if you wanted to. So maybe via IBC communication protocol, which is also used in the Cosmos world, where if you wanted to, you can tie the token of the roll up to the main chain and otherwise you still have like a governance roll up. So there's a lot of middle ground that could be used and needs to be explored.
00:15:53.220 - 00:16:04.260, Speaker D: Awesome. Yeah. To switch direction a little bit back to what Mustango briefly mentioned with optimusical goals, having this withdrawal agency period.
00:16:05.320 - 00:16:08.196, Speaker C: He framed it as a positive in.
00:16:08.218 - 00:16:27.740, Speaker D: The scenario he described, but typically it's seen as a negative because you would want to have immediate capabilities. With Bridges getting more mature and security providers coming to existence, that seems to be less than most of an issue. Is that we agree or disagree?
00:16:31.360 - 00:17:42.740, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm sure. I would say yes, there is one week withdrawal period, but there's ways to work around that, which is you have to even have liquidity providers because let's say you're on a roll up chain and you want to transfer your asset to some other chain and send it there. You don't necessarily have to wait a week. You can use the liquidity provider. The liquidity provider would have an account on both roll ups or both chains, and you send your funds to the liquidity provider account for the roll up that you want to withdraw from, and then they give you assets on the roll up or chain that you want to withdraw to. And that's perfectly secure because the liquidity provider, instead of denying or waiting for board groups, they can validate the roll up blocks for themselves. And when we validate the rollblocks, they can be completely sure that it's impossible to generate a fraud proof for it, and therefore they can be completely sure that they will definitely get their funds.
00:17:44.280 - 00:18:34.230, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. I disagree because there are many situations where it won't work as smoothly, in my opinion. For example, in times of volatility where the movement is strictly or mostly unidirectional, everyone wants to leave this chain and go and sell some tokens. And then you quickly will drain out the capacity of the providers and it will become just very expensive. Like you will have to pay a huge premium on your exit, 10%, 50%, whatever. We actually saw this happening with Polygon certain, like on Black Thursday, there was a very significant drop in the press and everyone rushed to exchange it. And the Ether on Polymorphic was traded significantly at a discount compared to lay one.
00:18:34.230 - 00:19:08.236, Speaker C: But there is also a coordination problem and there is also a cost problem because you need to keep this massive amount of capital idle park for no good reason, just like you said, it being for keeping that capacity. How much do you keep there? 1 million. 1 billion? You need to balance it. You need to see exactly what the usage is, what's the daily fluctuation of this exit volume and so on. I think it's going to be really hard. We'll just create all the cost. It will all be transformed into costs for the end users.
00:19:08.348 - 00:19:26.864, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely trade costs. But the scenario is probably the same scenario that could users cannot reach all their funds pretty well, but same scenario could also happen in DD Four, for example, in case of a malicious committee.
00:19:26.992 - 00:19:39.796, Speaker C: Which would be yeah, but not with Ziggy robot. So the K Bark has its own security program. If we compare two robots, we should compare Zikaro to optimistic Rob, not optimistic Rob to Zika forever.
00:19:39.828 - 00:20:45.790, Speaker B: We should compare I believe in votes between optimism. I'm not optimistic for the maximum. But I will also say that in the celestial model, because in Ethereum roll ups, the fork proofs are put into one chain. But in the celestial model, we envision a model where you can have solvery roll ups that are like chains in the override. And so the four proofs don't need to be listed on chain but can be distributed within the peer to peer network of that roll up subnetwork. And because you distribute the foolproof proof in this peer to peer network, you have a much much lower challenge period within that role within the network. Because there's a much lower network syncing delay to distribute a foolproof within the peer to peer network than there is to actually post it on chain and wait for mine to accept that.
00:20:45.790 - 00:21:06.710, Speaker B: So you're used to challenge period like ten minutes, for example. However, you still have the challenge period with cross chain bridges. If you want to actually transfer your roll up from one, you still have this one week. So there's definitely.
00:21:15.240 - 00:21:57.720, Speaker A: Submit the problem, including like let's say the four proof is gossiped in the PCP network of the one chain and you want to modify the other chain. Can you submit it like the IC? Or does it help? If you can submit the thought group that is brought in the peer to peer layer of the one chain, you can submit it via IBC to the other chain. Use leverage IBC to submit the thought group somewhere that is available to you instead of waiting.
00:22:00.380 - 00:22:36.610, Speaker B: But you still have this issue where you have to wait for the robot be within the block, right? It's the fact that you have to wait for it to be within. You cannot assume that the charge period will be below if there is you don't know how much unchained capacity there is. Like maybe change, maybe minors and that chain are very positions and like, that you can make more assumptions you can easily make more assumptions about the about that you control than.
00:22:43.560 - 00:22:46.710, Speaker D: Yeah. So the follow up question I want to ask that.
00:22:49.080 - 00:22:50.036, Speaker C: Was included from that.
00:22:50.058 - 00:23:01.290, Speaker D: Is with roll ups are there any specific advantages that DJ roll ups have over that? Because we're seeing more.
00:23:06.000 - 00:23:08.030, Speaker A: Pass on this one. You don't have any?
00:23:12.960 - 00:24:16.070, Speaker C: Okay, well, who is, quote ram 80 year old maximalist and eventually prevail on properties they have? And one obvious advantage, which is insurmountable for optimistic, is that the edit for entities from L 20 one cannot be accelerated after Mr. Cos and Nvidia works it's natively very fast, just a few minutes to generate the group. And apart from that, I think that NFDS are inherently very popular movement. And you're going to have a lot of NFTs. It's something that caters very much to the mass audience and you're going to have a lot of NFTs. Only fraction of them is going to be valuable. Most of them are not going to be like roll ups have cost because they provide this high level of security.
00:24:16.070 - 00:24:45.020, Speaker C: So they're very well suited with DeFi high value transactions but not so much with microtransactions. So my feeling is that NFTs are going to be very popular on something like the ZT Porter or side chains. But with ZT Porter it's great because you can easily transfer them from the ZT Porter account to the Ztroller account. Once you get some really valuable all of a sudden it's very popular and with art you never know this can happen overnight.
00:24:49.040 - 00:25:37.916, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree optimistic and it probably does make sense to open DP roll ups because it's not a complicated application, it's just like transfer of assets and VP roll ups right now are well suited towards like simple transfer of assets. They're not very well suited right now to more complicated applications that have more complicated logic long term that might be solved. I know some people are trying to work on one general purpose, having general purpose complications in terms of your but it's not clear to me at what time are looking at how powerful will be in the future. I have a good question.
00:25:38.018 - 00:25:53.890, Speaker A: You mentioned that the Zika Porter and the Zikawala accounts they are interoperable when you say they're interoperable do you mean exactly what you just said? That you can easily transfer from one account to the other so it's always an either or.
00:25:57.160 - 00:26:23.820, Speaker C: Within the system they are indistinguishable essentially the only difference is like outside of the validator level publish or not publish, they will take it which is externally observable by the eucharist. But inside the system there is no distinction just have one analysis, the other address, some cover is there some of the bounces there. It's free, it's seamless, just like playable.
00:26:25.360 - 00:26:26.270, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:26:28.400 - 00:26:38.828, Speaker D: So in a roller centric world, I know that you said you think that there's going to be one consensus decay, but in the celestial world there's going to be multiple roll ups.
00:26:38.924 - 00:26:39.570, Speaker C: Right.
00:26:40.180 - 00:26:56.980, Speaker D: So you consider both scenarios. In a scenario where there are multiple roll ups, how do you envision multiple apps being on one roll up or one roll up specific one app, specific chain affecting any media interoperability?
00:27:01.780 - 00:28:11.270, Speaker B: Yes. I think your argument is that you don't even need multiple roll ups both for scalability reasons and forget reasons, because it's not scalable to have a massive one role of doing all execution because you need to have an aggregate group with a lot of resources to produce that chain. And also you have to have fog proof generators to have a lot of resources, have the same issue because you still need the ZP approval to process all the transactions, but you don't have the revolution issue because there's constant revolution cost. That's the first reason. And then the second reason is flexibility. We want people to have flexibility of creating their own, creating different execution environments. You don't want to have one roll up that's just easy and roll up, someone can create it, someone can definitely take out.
00:28:11.270 - 00:28:38.910, Speaker B: But we don't want to tie to that model. We want to be able to have people create their own execution environment to be able to innovate. But my stand is with DK, if you're only targeting one application, which is payments, there's not much execution environments because.
00:28:39.460 - 00:28:41.116, Speaker A: There'S only one way to do payments.
00:28:41.148 - 00:28:50.210, Speaker B: There's not that much application to the asset transfer. There's not much need to have to put existing records for that.
00:28:52.180 - 00:29:15.270, Speaker C: This is true, but then you normally don't just want to do transfers, you want to do transfers, you want to remain within the lease. So think from the user perspective. You have one wallet, some balance in it. Sometimes you want to send transaction to send some money to a friend or pay for something online, but then you also want to participate in DeFi from the same account.
00:29:16.360 - 00:29:34.560, Speaker B: But so people can deploy smart contracts.
00:29:35.620 - 00:30:39.110, Speaker C: People can deploy smartphone, of course, any EVM smart contracts, they can transfer things, but they can also involve hundreds and they can program what they perform. More interesting question is do they want to experiment with the different environments, EVM or non EVM compatible? And this is a really big question and it's not the best language, it's not the best API, but it gets sticky. It's actually terrible in many ways, but it gets sticky. And now it's standard. And there is no question, no one's coming with browsers that support the current APIs and very much supports JavaScript and Dom and standard HTML. I'm afraid we are at this point with EVM, at least for the observable future, it will be this there is no EVM capability will be this lingual franca of blockchains. That's why we are all in this.
00:30:40.200 - 00:31:31.220, Speaker A: Yeah, I very strongly believe that there's necessity to innovate and experiment with different things. Especially with me for instance, mentioned, you cannot come up with a perfect solution in all cases. And the beauty like in Celestia is that you can literally have different rollouts that deal differently with this. And also you mentioned JavaScript is a very good analogy. But I'm very happy that although JavaScript may be like in the browser the default, there's like a bunch of other languages that we as developers can use. And I'm very happy about this fact. And I think also we already live in a world where people build in different languages, not only using the EDM and also using a theoretical program.
00:31:31.220 - 00:32:06.690, Speaker A: You can still have an EDM compatible execution environment on top of, for instance, Celestia. And so there's no limit. Why would we limit ourselves to just JavaScript? I still believe it's quite early in the logic. Also the innovations are run like that. The innovation happens much faster than in the other world. So even if JavaScript might be the standard now, like six years from now, the world will be completely different. And I think that's a good thing.
00:32:08.020 - 00:33:17.860, Speaker B: Yeah, it's also not just about language, it's also about resource pricing. With JavaScript, I think it's a bit different because people have created all kinds of things to make JavaScript more powerful. Jquery and languages that compile you can compile CD JavaScript, there's all these stuff on top of it like web JS and copy script to make it more powerful. But that works in JavaScript based because JavaScript runs locally. I think JavaScript doesn't run global machine. So you can do all these abstractions that can be done on local machines within the browser, but it's much more difficult to do that on a wall computer like Ethereum crypto library. The gas cost is 2 billion gas, for example, and there's no way for me to optimize that without convincing the upcoming.
00:33:17.860 - 00:33:43.180, Speaker B: So it's much harder. There's a lot like stuff I can do to introduce if you want to optimize it. People have optimized JavaScript a lot on the browser level, but when you're going to do that on Ethereum with specific things that are more expensive if you implement any kind of Ethereum, you have to do hot forks using UpCodes to do that, just to make it even just to make it performance.
00:33:47.780 - 00:34:07.480, Speaker D: I'm going to ask one last question, which is what is your long term vision for the crypto system as a whole? And how do you think plans that specifically with respect to privacy, transparency and user?
00:34:09.900 - 00:34:23.276, Speaker C: Sure, it's a mission driven project. The mission is to bring crypto enhances everyone. It's just a question how. It's not a question whether or not it will happen.
00:34:23.298 - 00:34:24.270, Speaker D: It will happen.
00:34:25.040 - 00:35:21.024, Speaker C: We have to figure out how to do it. So if we start with what we have now, it will bring us to some multiple of the users potentially possible over Ethereum today. Hundreds of millions of users, not billions yet, but eventually we have to get billions. And yeah, so I just can't see a world where this is not coming for a variety of business. From a social perspective, there's a huge demand for this. This is a problem many people have and don't know they have. And there will be more events in the traditional finance world that will put people tokens as well, will make them embrace this technologies more.
00:35:21.024 - 00:35:42.180, Speaker C: And also the young generation like the Gen Z, very Token and crypto native, they're not just Internet natives, they are already like token native generational shifts. From now, the majority of people in the world will be just naked. It's just inevitable.
00:35:44.280 - 00:36:36.744, Speaker B: I think our long term vision is we see a potential world where every community from small communities like gaming, private gaming center on Minecraft to large scale communities like governments, they will all potentially have their own kind of value system or potential application on a chain to either track the governance purposes or value transfer purposes, or just to record information, make it more transparent. I see a potential where every community has its own kind of state on some kind of chain or on the Internet to keep track of either revenue or governance. And it's just going to be to have every community having a shared space.
00:36:36.862 - 00:36:38.680, Speaker A: On a shared security environment.
00:36:40.140 - 00:37:55.296, Speaker B: But if you make it possible for communities to easily deploy your own software chains within seconds, then I think if you make it that efficient, it will eventually happen. The only kind of question there is from a technical perspective is how do you make those different chains associated? Communities interoperable and complain? Because right now it can create a smart contract of pull all smart contracts ethereum and do stuff and communicate with all smart contracts. But in a world where everything is in a roll up, interoperability between those roll ups of things becomes a little bit more trickier. Unfortunately, I think we have to deal with that because what's already happening today is for the past ten years, blockchain developers have basically gotten a free launch with composability. They haven't had to think about composability, like just call all the smart contracts very easily, but even the Ethereum in the future, that's no longer going to be the case.
00:37:55.478 - 00:37:56.736, Speaker A: You have to have this role off.
00:37:56.758 - 00:38:19.610, Speaker B: Centric roadmap where people are expected to create their own role for applications. And so you just have to accept the fact that developers have to think more carefully or bake in specifically their applications and technologies like Cosmos IBC will be very important for that.
00:38:22.300 - 00:38:58.500, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm very much aligned with what most of our vision is. I just want to add that I think it's not like mass adoption and these global communities and that interoperate with each. Other is not just something we want to push or it's nice to have from a technical perspective or it's like because people are already crypto native or whatever but I believe that eventually some form of global core donation across communities is also like a necessity for the global society.
00:39:02.440 - 00:39:04.150, Speaker D: All right, thanks for your answer.
00:39:06.040 - 00:39:07.030, Speaker B: Any questions?
00:39:08.200 - 00:39:11.110, Speaker D: Yeah, hello.
00:39:19.040 - 00:39:20.664, Speaker B: That's the question Alex.
00:39:20.792 - 00:39:37.884, Speaker C: I could have answered it before but it's related to the VP Sync and Porter. So do the Vsync and DT Porter support intercontract mitigation on EVM? So can you using DK Porter and.
00:39:37.922 - 00:39:42.060, Speaker B: DP Sync share state between contracts?
00:39:53.080 - 00:39:59.290, Speaker C: So you said that DKC is EVM roll up.
00:40:02.380 - 00:40:06.264, Speaker B: And it runs EVM at some point and posts the results on.
00:40:06.302 - 00:40:12.344, Speaker C: Chain like on layer one. So is it possible to do rollout.
00:40:12.392 - 00:40:14.940, Speaker B: Level in your contract?
00:40:15.280 - 00:40:20.828, Speaker C: So you deploy one contract and other contract and can they interact with each other?
00:40:20.914 - 00:40:21.550, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:40:22.980 - 00:41:06.270, Speaker C: Well, this is a great question, thank you so much for that. Memes, I still didn't do a good job in explaining that presentation. I was trying doing my best, but I need to find a good wording. So this is what we meant when we say they are seamlessly interoperable and so essentially everything is inside async you can think of it as a model of ethereum. So the answer is clear yes, you can deploy multiple converts. They can call each other, these calls can be atomic. They will execute shared state access to shallow variable, do delegate call, do normal call everything works just exactly the same as what I want.
00:41:06.270 - 00:41:09.070, Speaker C: Does this sound.
00:41:11.760 - 00:41:12.744, Speaker B: There is no limitation.
00:41:12.792 - 00:42:00.930, Speaker C: To EVM at all? Like if you run them on there is no contract limitation on the level? Well, there will be some limitations like you probably cannot do like 1 million calls in the same block. There will be some soft limitations based on cardiac case of very high degree of how deep is your version stack can be, how many contracts can be, how many calls can there be in a single transaction in the block and so on. There will be some technical nature of the proof generation although we have repressed proof generations we created they can go unlimited but there will be some nuances there but from practical standpoint it won't affect most people very fast.
00:42:03.460 - 00:42:04.210, Speaker B: Thanks.
00:42:08.260 - 00:42:21.030, Speaker A: I actually have a follow up question to that. What if you hit capacity in that area and you deploy another such like another instance of that roll up, how will they.
00:42:24.360 - 00:42:25.830, Speaker B: Holidays, right?
00:42:31.240 - 00:42:40.652, Speaker C: Yeah. There is no limit on verify because it's like perfectly personal. So put as many we have many.
00:42:40.706 - 00:42:41.580, Speaker B: Blocks.
00:42:43.280 - 00:43:08.230, Speaker C: And we can chain as many of them in a single big role block as we do it on parallel like oh. And we just have a big, powerful sequential processor which takes transactions and puts them in block. And then it's the block, this big route block. As long as you need.
00:43:13.080 - 00:43:33.964, Speaker B: A limit to how let's say you get core out of any rapid, there's still a limit to how much access can you parallelize into multiple core service. Sure.
00:43:34.002 - 00:44:54.820, Speaker C: So this is the limitation all EVM compatible systems share. Because EVM is inherently spreadshot and there have been proposals by Vitalia, for example, and it's a normal way on top of EDM transactions to make the world transaction process possible, where you specify some known to incomplete language which accounts are going to be touched by this transaction. Then you can know the tree of dependencies and then you can execute the subpar and this can be added. This will probably happen in the future. This is the pretty far feature because now the bottleneck of EVM compatible chains like literally get and everything which is basically get is not the CPU, it's not the backpack, it's the random storage access. And this can be easily solved, this can be easily boosted many folds if you just store all your storage around memory. You disagree, what this will give you is requirements for running the processor node will be very high, which is okay for Ziggy robots, which is not okay for optimistic robots.
00:44:54.820 - 00:45:21.760, Speaker C: For Ziggy robots it's perfectly fine. Yes, we have high requirements for running a node. You have to run on a very powerful machine, lots of CPUs, lots of memories, and you cannot do anything wrong anyway. But you will produce the proof and you will share this proof with everyone. It will be reflected here. But I read this 1.4 because everyone should be able to run into other consumer hardware and then you need to have this limitation.
00:45:29.380 - 00:45:45.700, Speaker B: Inside a single roll up and that allows you to parallelize the execution of the role of the ceiling that EVM can parallelize.
00:45:48.220 - 00:46:30.180, Speaker C: You could do that if you wanted. You could build an IRC of chains where you execution the shard and then you get the grocery. This is possible, this crack CDA, the original CD portal. This will probably indeed happen. So some of the application specific, community specific systems will be like this, like games. They will have their own shark and most transactions happens within the shark. They only need to propagate up to the upper levels.
00:46:30.180 - 00:46:43.130, Speaker C: When you want to move funds out or in to the shark, most things happen inside it. No one else might need to know except for the proof of the block. Yeah, I agree.
00:46:47.120 - 00:47:00.430, Speaker B: Yeah, on ZK relative to ethereum do me worse for more mev or less me.
00:47:02.660 - 00:47:33.560, Speaker C: So all roll ups are pretty equal in this regard. If you don't address any problem specifically then you're down to your sequencer, whatever. Maybe minor extraction sequencer allows. That's what you have, you have a centralized sequencer, they can do whatever they want. You can form blocks in any way transactions, they will do what they want. It's a question how you deal with this. If you have a decentralized sequencer, it's a question of how you structure it in general.
00:47:33.560 - 00:48:35.550, Speaker C: What's your philosophical position on Nvdb? We believe that NAV is evil because it puts certain group of users in a much more privileged position than everyone else. And this is what blockchains are you want to develop? Equal rules. So you mentioned ethereum miners. The mining pool operator has a lot more power than whoever provides the mining shares. They can do MVP in a secretive manner that no one notices immediately and they get all the profit for themselves and they don't share it with the mining hash with the actual miners and the miners cannot hold them accountable. Unlike just distribution rewards. So for sync, as long as there is a signal sequencer which is centralized, the operator just guarantees that there will be normally like transactions are going to be served on first count, first serve order.
00:48:35.550 - 00:49:09.350, Speaker C: With the decentralized sequencer they'll have small low latency blocks. So this will lower the window of opportunity to reorder transactions because you need to provide the information as soon as possible. And in the long run we'll have something like time logs, encryption, provide censorship and NDB altogether fundamentally the minus one. You know what we are sending, what kind of.
00:49:15.240 - 00:49:19.870, Speaker A: No, I was wondering how it and another question.
00:49:32.340 - 00:49:34.048, Speaker B: Can we do two questions please?
00:49:34.134 - 00:49:35.296, Speaker C: Sure, I'll make it quick.
00:49:35.318 - 00:49:36.320, Speaker B: It's a promise.
00:49:37.460 - 00:49:55.270, Speaker E: I have a question. You mentioned automated back bounty. What are referring to? And the second question what's your plan with honeymoon? Like the first question is about what do you mean by automatic bug bounty? And second question you mentioned is about a plan with honey pots. What are you going to do?
00:49:59.320 - 00:50:33.460, Speaker C: It's the same thing. Automated bug bounty is just a convert which has some money in it. And if you crack it, you get it. Or you could do more stuff like if you find a vulnerability in this converse then and you can prove that there is a vulnerability in some way. Like for example, you can destroy it, not just steal the funds from it. If you like it, you have a separate contract which points to this one and it will release the balance to whoever proved that they destroyed this cover. It is the transaction.
00:50:33.460 - 00:50:44.180, Speaker C: This would be something like this. This will provide you more for you as an exploiter or whitehead hacker.
00:50:45.900 - 00:50:46.216, Speaker D: Do.
00:50:46.238 - 00:50:58.010, Speaker C: Be very guaranteed rather than relying on reputation and trust in private owners who might or might not give you the money. That's what they call high quality.
00:51:01.340 - 00:51:05.076, Speaker F: Yeah, it's mostly to do with dedicated.
00:51:05.108 - 00:51:08.172, Speaker A: Things, but I guess also philosophically between.
00:51:08.226 - 00:51:11.004, Speaker B: What robots were and sort of where they're going.
00:51:11.122 - 00:51:19.616, Speaker F: There seems to be a lack of discernibility in something that ZK Sync does in that it provides. You can kind of say proof it.
00:51:19.638 - 00:51:21.296, Speaker A: As arbitrary recursion, or you can say.
00:51:21.318 - 00:51:50.588, Speaker F: It'S, well, you have this validation of state transition for any given proof in Zeke versus, like, mostly earlier stuff. Like ZK Money being kind of limited in what they can do. And I think a lot of people mismatch between normal recursion or normal roll ups and then arbitrary recursion first, whether state transitions or Cairo do with the defining CPU in the circuit. Do you think more decentral languages ought to be provided so people kind of.
00:51:50.594 - 00:51:51.788, Speaker A: Know where it was and then what.
00:51:51.794 - 00:52:16.544, Speaker F: The future may be? Do you think more sustainable language must be given so people understand the difference between validating a state transition for any rolled up proof or any purchase going in, in what ZK think 2.0 does or in what Cara does versus non ZBM, in this case, compatible roll ups, like previous things.
00:52:16.582 - 00:52:32.564, Speaker C: They're taking the money and stuff. You're just saying whether we should provide a more strict, rigorous language to distinguish between different types of, I guess, recursion.
00:52:32.612 - 00:52:58.240, Speaker F: Methods on projects, because people seem to batch together companies like Loop Ring and Mina and Aztec with sort of the type things going on now. And they are quite different in what they plan to do and what they provide. I mean, of course, the inner workings are different, like staff work completely different, but what they actually plan on doing and what they provide really is quite different. And they seem to be brought together or stuck together, and that doesn't seem to mold quite well.
00:52:58.390 - 00:53:21.944, Speaker C: Oh, I see. Well, you have a hierarchy of classification of systems, frankly. Like, you have L two S and non L two S. And L two S are subsequently categorized as like, roll ups and non roll ups. And then roll ups can be DT and optimistic and DK. Roll ups can be based on starts, based on starts. Starts can be trusted, set up and not.
00:53:21.944 - 00:53:54.850, Speaker C: So if you want to dig deeper, you need to understand this. It won't help to just use more specific language. You really need to have this model in your head or before your eyes. There are these classifications and these crowds which federalizes, what is palladium? What is rollout, what is the importance? So I think not many people will understand those who will understand the answers and to dive deeper and then go into nuances of it.
00:54:03.630 - 00:54:08.090, Speaker B: All right, let's have one last round of applause for all our panelists.
00:54:16.190 - 00:54:17.274, Speaker A: That's the end of the event.
00:54:17.312 - 00:54:19.986, Speaker B: I want to thank Madden Labs and.
00:54:20.088 - 00:54:29.454, Speaker A: Polychain and of course, bless you for hosting and of course, Liz 99. And you guys should all stick around for the pizza.
00:54:29.502 - 00:54:37.220, Speaker B: And I think there's beers drinks outside, so let's all talk crypto. Thanks again for coming.
00:54:40.230 - 00:54:43.680, Speaker C: Thank you, guys. Thank.
