00:00:02.040 - 00:00:49.988, Speaker A: So, yeah, thanks, everyone, for day two of modular summit. So, basically, as context for this panel. So Tina and I, for example, we've been having a lot of conversations about re evaluating things like the fat protocol thesis, as well as the fat application thesis, which emerged in 2022, sort of driven by a few different. Hatsu had a tweet, there were some blog posts by the folks at Z prime, et cetera. And as context for everyone, it's sort of that back in 2016, 2017, there was this big debate about, basically, where does value accrue? And people were like, well, you know, since we have these assets with really high market caps and no applications on them, clearly there's this fat protocol. Clearly, protocols are destined to be fat, and applications are destined to be small. And basically, which is an overgeneralization.
00:00:49.988 - 00:01:33.048, Speaker A: But the reason they gave was that, you know, because blockchains are basically serve as shared data layer, and then they also have tokens. They can build these really deep network effects around the protocol. And that basically, applications are just always going to be smaller than that, than those accrue modes that are smaller than that, et cetera. So then obviously, we have the whole period from 2016 to 2020, 2021. And then basically, there are the first applications. There starts to actually be on chain order flow and Defi and all these things. And in 2022, after all of that fades away, people started talking about this idea of a fat application thesis.
00:01:33.048 - 00:02:20.640, Speaker A: Actually, wait a minute. A lot of these applications, or basically just smart contracts on Ethereum or on all tail ones or whatever, they can actually pretty easily go and deploy their own chain. And that had already started happening by that point. You had DWDX as a chain, then, et cetera. It's a good time now with the modular stack to start re evaluating that, because a core premise of the idea of making the stack modular is that you basically end up with different, inherently thinner. Basically, each smaller component of the protocol can be broken down into a modular stack. And so we basically assembled this panel to reevaluate that and talk about, basically how this is evolving and what it looks like going forward.
00:02:20.640 - 00:02:29.278, Speaker A: We have Ben Fish from Espresso, Justin Drake from Ethereum Foundation, James Prestwich from. I actually don't know what you're working on these days.
00:02:29.454 - 00:02:30.238, Speaker B: Init four.
00:02:30.334 - 00:03:02.170, Speaker A: Init four. And then viscounts from Z Prime. And they wrote some of the best blog posts on this topic at the time in 2022. And so I think the first question to ask the group is, what are the actual lasting modes for a protocol like Ethereum or other, you know, l one s, et cetera, in an endgame where applications do control their distribution, end users to a larger and larger extent, as like other parts of the stack, modularize. So I guess maybe starting with Ben.
00:03:04.230 - 00:04:47.040, Speaker C: Yeah, so I do think that fundamentally value has to accrue to applications because, you know, if a, if it weren't the case that, let's say an l one protocol with applications on top of it were allocating most of the value back to applications, then fundamentally applications would just take control of their own order flow. And now you get into competition between l one s. And so any platform that is not redistributing value to applications, be it in fact a roll up that has applications on it, or an l one itself is going to face now a competition from, from other applications. And of course the one moat is if you can build a strong enough network effect, then there's an argument to be made that nobody else can compete with you. And I think that what you call sort of this modular movement has sort of eroded that moat because it's now very easy for applications to build their own chain, but in a way where they're still to a great extent benefiting from the liquidity that that exists on other chains or applications, there's no longer such a pull to all be in the same rent seeking one. But I think that the end game for these protocols is still, maybe it's not to take all the value, but if you're a DA layer or a settlement layer, or still providing some infrastructure that has a strong purpose and a network effect, you're going to be capturing some value, which is going to be a small percentage of each application's value.
00:04:49.420 - 00:06:01.292, Speaker D: So I guess my thesis is that there's going to be one very obese l one, think tens of trillions of dollars, maybe $100 trillion, and then there's going to be fat applications on top of that. The fat applications are going to be, because I think there's a realization more and more that applications have actually sovereignty over the value that they create. So each application will have the ability to capture their own congestion fees. Just like base, for example, today captures tens of millions of dollars of congestion fees and will also be able to capture the MEV that they create. We have ideas like execution tickets, but there's all sorts of other ideas now in terms of the value that the L1 provides, there's basically two of them. One is shared security through shared data availability. And we're going to see, I think, very high demand for data availability, which is going to lead to very healthy cash flows.
00:06:01.292 - 00:06:34.790, Speaker D: And then the other use case is economic bandwidth. So money collateral for these applications, the one pristine collateral which is available on the platform, the one where you don't introduce a new security assumption or new governance or whatever it is, and that is going to drive the monetary premium. So the cash flow aspect is going to be thinking of Ethereum, like a company, like a stock, and then the money aspect is going to be thinking about efir as a collateral, like gold.
00:06:37.410 - 00:07:31.380, Speaker B: I'm in a little bit of a unique position on this panel in that I've actually migrated an application between blockchains in 2016, 2017 ish, and we didn't do it because of value accrual or some ontology about who's making money and how it gets allocated. Like, people running applications make business decisions. Do we think the cost of development will be higher in the long run? Do we think that we will have access to a bigger user base? When we're talking about these big research questions about value accrual, we tend to forget there are thousands of independent actors in this space trying to run businesses, and they make short term economic decisions and they're not rational actors. I don't have like a long term thesis on value accrual, because I think it's incredibly path dependent.
00:07:34.000 - 00:08:49.330, Speaker E: So I agree with James. I don't have a long term thesis for Ethereum value accrual. I would say that one of the modes that's maybe a bit overlooked is the mine share in Ethereum ecosystem, which is represented by one of the previous speakers was mentioning like value alignment and. Yeah, well, in the cut road of business, it's like kind of silly to talk about value alignment and these philosophical questions and ideologies and ideals, but at the same time, at this point, I would still say that Ethereum plays a role as a sort of like an, almost like a Silicon Valley of crypto development, with all the important and interesting ideas that came into crypto in last at least like five years, originated in Ethereum. And this mind share and this sort of ethos that was built around it very organically. I think that's a mode that will last for some time. I would say that this is also the reason why even like very business minded entities will still try to tap into that mindshare as best as they can.
00:08:49.330 - 00:09:04.310, Speaker E: But I'm not sure if this is a mode that's not irreplaceable in the long run. I think in the long run, people are leaving Silicon Valley to Texas. This can also happen with Ethereum, if our streets will become full of shit.
00:09:06.340 - 00:09:13.400, Speaker B: Fundamentally, like users don't know or care about value accrual theses, like people move to Texas.
00:09:16.740 - 00:09:47.780, Speaker A: I still have a question for Justin. I guess basically everyone after us, but it's basically what, you know, in either world, just how obese should Ethereum be? But then the question attached to that is which part of the modular stack or the blockchain stacks are fated to reintegrate? Like, what's the stuff that feels like there is sort of like a gravity based on what users are doing, based on what they're doing by their own not thinking about any of this infrastructure. What parts of the stack or even off chain infrastructure are fated to centralize or reintegrate?
00:09:49.200 - 00:09:52.220, Speaker D: By reintegrate, do you mean get enshrined within?
00:09:52.800 - 00:10:03.500, Speaker A: Yeah, or you think of like for example, if espresso decided to get into proof aggregation or something, you know, like what are the, you know, or the super chain or these sorts of things.
00:10:05.480 - 00:10:56.134, Speaker D: Right? I mean, I think all the technology will get commoditized. The only thing that's really valuable is going to be the network effects, and there's network effects around money, which are, you know, around access to liquidity and access to TVL. So, yeah, if you want to look at the technology. So if we. There's this notion, for example, of a native roll up that used to be called an enshrined roll up, where all the complexity of building an EVM equivalent, snark circuit or an EVM equivalent for proof, all of that will be encapsulated in one single opcode. That will be very easy to do. The proof aggregation, that's just pure technology.
00:10:56.134 - 00:11:51.910, Speaker D: There's no reason why there should be value captured there. The settlement layer, same thing here. It's like a constant amount of gas that you need to consume per unit of time per slot. So you might imagine five different proofs that gets verified on chain per slot. The thing that's kind of difficult to maintain is the congestion fees, the demand that basically stem from network effects. The more activity there is on Ethereum, the more of a desire there is for application developers and users to join in. I think it's going to be winner take most, this obese l one thesis, and not only will there be network effects on congestion, but also network effects on money, but everything else is commoditized.
00:11:52.890 - 00:13:28.962, Speaker C: Can I build off what Justin said? So I think that network effects, in my view, fundamentally have to do with some kind of provision of coordination. I think that any fat protocol, so to say, with a network effect or network effect around it, is providing some necessary coordination to applications, okay? And that could be through shared liquidity, through shared settlement, through, you know, you know, composability between applications. The core tension, though, is always going to be between providing this necessary coordination and then reallocating value accrual to applications and any protocol that figures out the best way to provide this coordination, while at the same time redistributing value to applications is going to have the strongest network effect. All the applications are going to there, there, because they have the best of both worlds. And so in my view, this is a mechanism design problem. It's how do you have applications running on kind of a common system where you have users on the one hand, or even builders or block builders or types of users that are bidding for some kind of constrained resource, and you're selling this constrained resource how? Because this constrained resource is shared among applications. How do you allocate it and attribute and redistribute the value to them? And that's, I think, a core problem that Ethereum is going to face.
00:13:28.962 - 00:13:45.100, Speaker C: It's a market mechanism design problem. You can view it as an auction problem or a lottery problem. That's also the problem that, like Espresso, discovered very quickly we needed to solve, because if we're trying to provide some kind of shared resource, then we have to solve that market mechanism.
00:13:45.720 - 00:14:03.980, Speaker E: I slightly disagree with this take. I think that the most successful applications, like these sort of super apps or fat apps, that will emerge, I think they will take matters into their own hands and will capture their own value on their own terms. Rather than abide by some protocol rules.
00:14:05.200 - 00:14:39.660, Speaker B: We can also kind of rule out the case that there are many applications on an OBS protocol, block space is constrained on any blockchain you buy it from. It just is. That doesn't matter if you're sharding data availability sampling, there are constraints. All applications compete with all other applications to buy block space. When block space is sold out, when the constraint is hit, when the supply is all sold, fees go nonlinear. This happened in 2020, 2021. We saw fees go from five GUI to 500 GUI or 5000.
00:14:39.660 - 00:15:35.286, Speaker B: Most applications cannot survive a nonlinear fee event. When the fees go from five kw to 500 kwei, most applications die. And only applications that are willing to pay that price are allowed to survive. So when the protocol gets obese, it narrows the scope of applications. You can build applications that can survive, and all block space goes to the users in the applications willing to pay the highest value for that block space, the applications with the highest marginal value of transacting. So when we're talking about giving value back to the applications, we're talking about a situation in which a small number of applications with high marginal value of transacting receive the value. And so we should be clear that they squeeze out all other applications.
00:15:35.286 - 00:15:39.570, Speaker B: When we talk about an OBS protocol, it means a protocol with one to two applications.
00:15:41.230 - 00:16:03.610, Speaker D: I mean, one thing that I expect will happen is that as we have more and more blobs and more and more applications that consume parts of the blobs, then any given spike in one or two or three applications is going to be smoothed out by all the other applications that don't have a spike. And so the volatility of the fee market should go down dramatically. It won't go from five to 5000.
00:16:04.230 - 00:16:17.770, Speaker B: If I have a $5 marginal value of transacting, I will pay $5 for all gas in the block. It doesn't matter that there are other applications that we'll only pay for, they're just not allowed to buy block space.
00:16:19.710 - 00:16:52.062, Speaker D: Yeah, I agree with that statement. But basically what happens is that when there's one application that starts to dominate, it consumes all the gas. Um, whereas when, you know, there's 1000 applications, each of which consume, you know, one 1000th in, in, in the normal case, but you know, ten x more in the unusual case, in the spiky case. Well, the difference between one and ten when you units of, of consumption. When you have 1000 units of, of supply is, is not that, that bad?
00:16:52.246 - 00:17:32.581, Speaker B: Well, that's anchored in the spiky demand that we see right now. Like if all we're doing is building platforms for apps that go up and then down and then stay there, we should probably be building something else. We have to assume that eventually there will be stable applications with businesses behind them that bid a stable amount for block space. And block space costs rise to the lowest threshold of stable demand. It's not balanced out by spikiness across a bunch of different apps. If we are successful, there will be apps willing to buy out the chain and they will pay a high price to do so, and they will prevent other apps from transacting. You can see this very concretely.
00:17:32.581 - 00:17:46.929, Speaker B: If one roll up buys six blobs in an Ethereum block, no other roll ups are allowed to buy a blob. This has been demonstrated. This is just simple economics. Constrained supply, unconstrained demand.
00:17:47.429 - 00:17:50.501, Speaker D: But what about when we have 6000 blobs?
00:17:50.685 - 00:17:53.610, Speaker B: If one roll up is willing to buy 6000 blobs.
00:17:54.310 - 00:18:01.010, Speaker D: It won't need it. That won't be the economically rational thing to do. It will buy 60 blobs instead of buying six, but it won't buy all 6000.
00:18:01.510 - 00:18:02.542, Speaker B: Why not?
00:18:02.726 - 00:18:10.214, Speaker D: Because it doesn't have to. If there's some sort of NFT spike, for example, there's only a million nfts.
00:18:10.262 - 00:18:26.880, Speaker B: Each NFT we're still anchoring in the spiky case. If we are successful, there will be real businesses that have sustained demand. And if we can't meet sustained demand from real businesses, then we will have a nonlinear fee event, and we will rise to the point where no one else can transact.
00:18:28.380 - 00:19:20.050, Speaker C: I agree with what you're saying, but I think it's still a question of supply versus demand. And so it's also reasonable to expect that the supply of block space will exceed demand, especially with newer innovations coming out of the original point that I was making. I didn't want to make it so narrowly about a constrained resource like block space. There are other things that you can think of as a constrained resource, like access to order. There's always going to be arbitrage between different applications. And so this is something we can look at as an example. No matter what, even if you have every application running its own chain and there's no fat protocol in that sense, then there are still going to be arbitrageurs who will want the right to take advantage of arbitrage simultaneously across all different of these applications.
00:19:20.050 - 00:19:38.810, Speaker C: And again, this becomes a coordination problem. And so if there's a market that is selling jointly, this arbitrage opportunity over all these different applications, it still needs to figure out how to reallocate that to the applications. Otherwise, the applications are going to run their own marketplaces and there won't be any coordination. That was the point I was making.
00:19:41.870 - 00:20:02.390, Speaker D: I mean, another point on the spikiness of fees is that you can sell block space futures and you can buy block space futures. So just like gas, like actual gas that you put in the tank, this is hedged on a very large, very large size. And ethereum gas will have similar markets to physical gas.
00:20:02.550 - 00:20:39.650, Speaker B: Yes. So I worked on like hash rate and block space futures platform back in 2018. The problem with this as a concept is that while block space futures have logical buyers, there are no logical sellers. When we have a futures market in real life for things like flour, oil, not onions, that's not allowed. You have people who know they will produce flour, and you have people who know they will consume flour, and they know they will do that at. You have people who know they'll produce oil, and they know they'll consume oil, and it's at scale. And so the futures market exists to resolve the timeline differences.
00:20:39.650 - 00:20:48.070, Speaker B: We have people who know they will consume block space, but we don't have a market that knows it will produce block space.
00:20:48.150 - 00:20:50.450, Speaker D: Proposers, they're called proposers.
00:20:50.990 - 00:20:54.210, Speaker B: Proposers know how many days in advance.
00:20:56.670 - 00:21:31.890, Speaker D: Well, you can have. Well, first of all, there is this notion of a look ahead where you can, for a few minutes, sell in advance, but you can also sell at larger intervals with, for example, execution tickets. So with execution tickets, you could have a pool of millions of tickets that are sold in advance, and you know what fraction of those you have. And so you can probabilistically provide block space futures with a look ahead of many days.
00:21:32.470 - 00:21:37.050, Speaker B: Probabilistically providing futures is not very useful to me when I'm running a business.
00:21:39.630 - 00:22:18.360, Speaker D: Well, I don't know. So here's the thing with arbitrum. So arbitrum has this isolationist approach where they're not really interested in composing with other rollups, and they're willing to basically delay settlement for various reasons. One of the reasons is that they want to batch as much data as possible, to have the best compression ratio possible, and then only settle on chain. Now, if you settle two minutes in the future, or two minutes and 12 seconds, or two minutes and 24 seconds, it doesn't really matter from the perspective of arbitrum, which would be one of the biggest consumers of blockspace.
00:22:23.840 - 00:22:29.620, Speaker B: So you're looking at these futures markets in the perspective of like five minute markets or less?
00:22:29.920 - 00:22:40.140, Speaker D: No, it could be on a matter of days as well. So you could say arbitrum wants to buy 20% of the blob space for the next week, and they will just be able to do that.
00:22:44.490 - 00:22:48.070, Speaker B: I'm excited to see special mechanisms dos attack on this.
00:22:50.090 - 00:23:08.790, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks, I guess. One question more for frisk on. You guys obviously wrote this blog post about the fat application thesis and stuff after 2022. Where do you actually think what actually has played out as you expected from your guys perspective?
00:23:09.300 - 00:24:05.694, Speaker E: Not much. It's still too soon. I think what played out is that now many people agree with us, but they agree with their words and with their tweets, but not with their money. They are still funding infrastructure and protocols more than they are funding applications. And we see this in the valuations, in the, in the rounds, even throughout this cycle. I guess one thing that people forget when we are talking about applications and protocols is that we already have super apps and they are Coinbase, Binance, OKX. But the thing is, they don't have too many rounds because they became profitable quite fast and they are not really on chain too much, but they use many chains.
00:24:05.694 - 00:25:04.134, Speaker E: They abstract the way the chains and some of them are already launching their own layer ones, L2s. And it's fair to say that at least for Coinbase and before even for Binance, they were able to make their l two s and l one s much more used and successful than all of these other competitors that are building the infra first. And then they will figure out how to bring the users. They had the users first. And this seems to be the winning sort of vector for the super apps. And maybe the example that's, it's still like, it's not clear if it will work out, but it seems that Telegram is another one, another competitor that has this angle of like, yeah, we have these 900 million users, they are using our chat. What if we just like put some blockchain underneath, give them a wallet and see what happens next? And yeah, now it's like one of the most hyped thing.
00:25:04.134 - 00:25:20.010, Speaker E: So I think this is kind of still very early to say if it's a successful path, but I would say it has bigger chance of success than building like five layers of weird infrastructure and then waiting for someone to come and build some important application on top.
00:25:21.720 - 00:26:13.554, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess the question there, I think, and I was talking to some of this earlier, is like, what is the adjustment time? And so if you think of it as like there's this weird structure around market structure around crypto stuff that causes tokens being one of them, right? That causes a very large, like pretty unarguable, like, over investment infrastructure. Like what is the actual time to make an adjustment to that? And like, what is good enough, you know, like in the sense of like what is the, like what, what is the level of readiness? Or like what is the, like the, the minimum viable, like set of like protocols or infrastructure or state of the world that will actually bring about a change in that, like market structure to be, to cause like an investment in a greater investment and attraction by application builders, et cetera. Like, what is that order of magnitude of time is the kind of the question.
00:26:13.732 - 00:27:18.790, Speaker C: I don't know, by the way, if all of us agree that, I mean, saying on the one hand that applications are fat and value accrues applications, and for any given application, 99% of the value of that application is going to the application and not to the protocol that doesn't necessarily mean that any given application is more valuable than infrastructure. I mean, infrastructure is taking a small piece of all applications. And again, going back to what I was saying before, if there is some fundamental coordination that needs to be solved or some fundamental shared security that needs to be provided, which in my view is the whole point of web3 in the first place. I mean, if the fad application thesis were so strong that protocols diminished to basically insignificant, to insignificant levels, then we were perfectly fine with web two. So I think fundamentally, infrastructure in web3 provides a, you know, coordination mechanism that's necessary. And any piece of infrastructure that's successful will be taking a small piece of all applications. As applications scaled value does accrue to that infrastructure.
00:27:18.790 - 00:27:24.050, Speaker C: So any given piece of infrastructure could be valued a lot more highly than any individual application.
00:27:24.470 - 00:27:40.140, Speaker A: Yeah, so that's like what Ethereum looks like today. But what do you like if you look at Solana, for example, right? Like how do we make sense of Solana in this world where they actually do have applications that are like single applications that are, you know, bigger than. West Salona is saying bigger, like.
00:27:42.720 - 00:27:46.088, Speaker C: The value of an individual application in terms of market cap is bigger than.
00:27:46.184 - 00:27:48.472, Speaker A: No, just the fees. Like even just the fees on like.
00:27:48.536 - 00:27:50.672, Speaker C: The revenue of the application, right?
00:27:50.736 - 00:27:56.380, Speaker A: Yeah, well, no, actually like radium really, but pump up fund is also in the top five or whatever.
00:27:59.120 - 00:28:27.420, Speaker C: I think you're going to. First of all, I think that you, you know, looking at any given example, you're going to have anomalies of like any theorem is a theorem, right? And then there's going to be counterexamples of that and there's so many confounding factors that it's very hard to pick it apart. But all I can't say, oh, you know, what exactly is going to be the case? But I think that there's an argument to be made that infrastructure still can be more valuable than individual applications, especially assuming there's sufficient competition between applications.
00:28:30.850 - 00:29:01.600, Speaker B: You know, when we purchase infrastructure, like running a company, when you purchase AWS, you do it for the predictability of the service and the predictability of the price. These are things that we don't have strong evidence that blockchains can provide, right? We get inconsistent pricing, we get inconsistent service all the time. And AWS is an extremely valuable company, but it's not clear that it's value is on the same order of magnitude as all the things built on top of it, right?
00:29:03.620 - 00:29:13.708, Speaker D: I mean, there's this commodity called gas, physical gas. It's worth $100 trillion. It has very unpredictable prices. And still people use it on a regular basis.
00:29:13.844 - 00:29:18.120, Speaker B: Right. And they have futures markets on the order of months to hedge their risk. Yes.
00:29:18.790 - 00:29:31.382, Speaker C: You just said collective. You're saying that AWS is not more valuable than all the applications combined on top of it. But if you compare AWS to any individual application, the vast majority of applications that run on AWS are not as valuable as AWS.
00:29:31.486 - 00:29:43.006, Speaker B: Right. What I'm saying is that it doesn't capture a significant percentage of the value that is created by applications on top of it, the applications do capture 90 plus percent of the value.
00:29:43.118 - 00:29:53.224, Speaker C: Yeah, I don't think. I disagree. I disagreed with what was said earlier. I don't remember by who that investors need to adjust the valuations of applications relative to infrastructure.
00:29:53.272 - 00:30:18.350, Speaker E: Because, you know, I think that markets are reflexive. So as long as we have people buying infrastructure tokens for much higher valuation than they are buying application tokens, we will have more of the investment in the direction, but maybe a couple of breakaway applications that become successful and we will see the markets to rerate just because markets are reflexive, especially in crypto.
00:30:20.290 - 00:30:25.258, Speaker A: Yeah. So, yeah. That's all time for this panel. Thanks guys for coming on and let's.
00:30:25.274 - 00:30:25.970, Speaker B: See how it plays out.
