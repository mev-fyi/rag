00:00:02.640 - 00:00:04.034, Speaker A: Nice. Then we're live.
00:00:08.374 - 00:00:09.754, Speaker B: How did you do that?
00:00:11.134 - 00:00:36.414, Speaker A: Like this. And so. Yeah. Welcome to another infinite space bazaar workshop. Today we have nat from celestial labs, or Natnet from celestial labs, and Kayla from Dora, or search on Dora. And they're going to be giving us a workshop today on storytelling. So I'm going to go ahead and let you all introduce yourselves and then give you the floor.
00:00:37.794 - 00:00:42.658, Speaker C: Thanks, Josh, can you share the slides? Yeah.
00:00:42.706 - 00:00:43.394, Speaker A: There you go.
00:00:43.514 - 00:00:54.984, Speaker C: Cool. Okay. Hey, everyone, I'm Natalie. I work at celestial Labs as Devrel events and programs.
00:00:55.564 - 00:00:57.024, Speaker D: I'm here with Kayla.
00:00:57.524 - 00:00:59.784, Speaker C: Kayla, do you want to introduce yourself?
00:01:00.124 - 00:01:03.424, Speaker B: Hey, I'm Kayla. I'm the product lead from the search on Dora team.
00:01:04.644 - 00:01:52.184, Speaker C: So. Yeah, so before you guys heard the ideations workshops and kind of go to market strategy and branding and positioning. And today we kind of want to explore with you the storytelling and how to be better storyteller while how to be a better storyteller for your presentation and also for your demo day. So we're gonna start with story about Kayla. Then we're gonna discuss the essentials of these storytelling. Why is it important how to tell a good story? What are the types of storytelling? And the second part, we're gonna be talking. Talking about more about storytelling that is tailored for your presentation online.
00:01:52.184 - 00:02:15.504, Speaker C: What are the techniques that you can use? What is the way, how to create a, you know, engaging and exciting presentation, and then how you can practice storytelling at the end, I am going to talk a little bit more about the community track and also what are the next steps for you to introduce your project.
00:02:17.604 - 00:02:27.184, Speaker B: Nice. So in the chat, let us know how everyone is feeling today. I know Nat and I briefly discussed. I feel like we always sit between a two and a six.
00:02:27.804 - 00:02:35.264, Speaker C: Yeah. Like, I woke up at, like, two and I'm like, we have this workshop. We get it. You said four, right?
00:02:36.484 - 00:02:39.744, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm also a four. I'm always having a coffee with me, too.
00:02:40.594 - 00:02:41.774, Speaker C: What about Josh?
00:02:44.594 - 00:02:45.574, Speaker A: A six.
00:02:50.354 - 00:02:56.134, Speaker C: Gm. Okay, five.
00:03:02.034 - 00:03:03.934, Speaker B: Let's see what the audience is saying.
00:03:05.374 - 00:03:07.714, Speaker C: Two. Six.
00:03:08.334 - 00:03:09.150, Speaker D: I see.
00:03:09.222 - 00:03:19.034, Speaker C: Because you're a jet, like, right? Yes. Cool. So we just wanted to check in with you. How are you guys feeling?
00:03:20.654 - 00:03:23.354, Speaker D: But now, Kayla, can you tell us your story?
00:03:23.934 - 00:04:28.498, Speaker B: Yeah, let me tell you the story about Kayla. So if you know me or don't know me, I went to the University of Waterloo, where I studied in the small town of Waterloo, Ontario, and spent many years in Toronto, Drake's favorite city and the birthplace of him and all great people. After I graduated, I ended up working at IBM, where I was a managing consultant on the AI Iot ML. Basically every buzzword you could ever imagine in the tech industry, that was our team name. Where during the pandemic, I got really bored and decided to start telling cute little funny, silly stories. On TikTok, which ended up creating my series, becoming an NFT billionaire and NFTs explained for hot girls, which took off, ended up getting me a job here in New York City, where I was working at a web three fashion company, and now currently at Dora, where I'm a product lead. So why is storytelling important? Storytelling has been around for generations.
00:04:28.498 - 00:05:01.656, Speaker B: It's how we learn, it's how we pass on traditions. You can call it storytelling, you can call it yapping, gossiping, presenting. I mean, there's so many different formats, but we currently live in an attention economy, and telling great stories is really what's going to give you a competitive edge. So we tell stories all the time. It can be about family moments, it could be about your favorite meme coin, it could be about what happened in your day. And communication has really evolved over time. It's not just about having verbal stories that you're sharing with each other.
00:05:01.656 - 00:05:11.944, Speaker B: It's in the format of TikTok. It could be air chats. It's Twitter, it's Instagram. Now we have all these platforms of social media where you have the opportunity to really connect with your audience on a deeper level.
00:05:14.644 - 00:05:19.744, Speaker D: I don't know if you saw the chat, but just they said this workshop is how to escape from the mid group.
00:05:22.084 - 00:05:56.360, Speaker B: So persuasion is really at the centerpiece of all business activity. Your customers and VC's you're pitching to them, they need to be convinced to buy your products or services or give you money. This is really what's going to set apart the Celestias from the cosmos and the Solanas. It helps you really engage your clients on an emotional and relatable level. And it should always be your goal to create a culture of storytelling wherever you're working. So if you're at a small startup, if you're at a big company, storytelling is really what leaves an impact. So here we have an example of a handful of some very famous storytellers.
00:05:56.360 - 00:06:30.924, Speaker B: Maya Angelou. She was notably known for her quote, for saying, it's not what you say or what you do, it's how you make people feel. So stories are really all about how you can evoke emotion within your audience. There's Ginny Ramidi, an ex IBM CEO who was a leader while I was at the company. And she was always very concise and all about breaking your story into three points that people can clearly digest and understand. Steve Jobs, obviously, he's one of the goats of storytelling. He's all about creating experiences that people actually want to share and support.
00:06:30.924 - 00:06:54.534, Speaker B: And Sheryl Sandberg, she was all about vulnerability in your story. So having, you know, emotional elements that people can connect to. So in the chat, if you want to let us know, who do you think some of the best web three storytellers are? I know I put up a poll on Twitter a few days ago, too, and had a bunch of responses, so I'm curious to see what you guys think.
00:07:03.374 - 00:07:08.054, Speaker C: I was thinking about this question as well, and I wanted to say that.
00:07:08.094 - 00:07:10.062, Speaker D: The closest ones that I have around.
00:07:10.118 - 00:07:45.214, Speaker C: Me that are good at storytelling. Yeah, Yaz is saying, but I need to agree because I feel like Yaz has been explaining stuff in a way like that. It's a story with facts, and we're gonna go over it a little bit later, but this is how you can make the person that is listening to you more excited and kind of like, more understand the topic that you're trying to explain. So I think Yaz is a very good storyteller. I would say Ikram has been a really good storyteller, too.
00:07:46.794 - 00:07:59.404, Speaker B: Someone said, to be honest, no one comes to mind. I was actually gonna say Vitalik, maybe not in a traditional sense, but I think some of his writing work is actually really interesting. Yeah, this is a big one.
00:07:59.564 - 00:07:59.924, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:07:59.964 - 00:08:22.784, Speaker B: You got a lot of fans in the chat here. Yeah, I know. Like you mentioned acrom, I heard some people say Vitalik. I had a couple of comments in my Twitter. I can also double check that later, but let us know on Twitter, tag us who you think your favorite or best storyteller is in web three. No sleep. John is cool too.
00:08:23.124 - 00:08:37.624, Speaker C: Cool. Cool. Now, we asked Josh to show 1 second. Can you stop the pause just a little bit? Cool.
00:08:38.004 - 00:08:50.324, Speaker B: So what I wanted to share today is just a really quick example of a really good story. So this was actually a commercial from Nike. It's a Michael Jordan commercial, Josh. I don't know if you want to quickly play it for everyone watching today.
00:08:56.184 - 00:09:22.194, Speaker E: I've missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I've lost almost 300 games. 26 times. I've been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I failed over and over and over again in my life, and that is why I succeed.
00:09:30.814 - 00:10:26.014, Speaker B: Do you want to jump to the next slide? So this is like a very understated, yet I think powerful, powerful commercial that really tells a great story. Was there something everyone in the chat, if you guys want to answer, that you really liked about this? What do you think made this story great? I'll give everyone a second, but for me, I think this is actually something really emotional that Michael Jordan touches on. You don't really need to be explicitly told what is happening in this, but he's evoking emotion of like, I was given the game winning shot and I still missed and I still lost, but I still overcame all those challenges. Michael Jordan is successful but still fails often. Yep. So politicians like to hide the truth. Artists lie to tell the truth.
00:10:26.014 - 00:10:54.234, Speaker B: Interesting. That's a great quote. Yes, but yeah, something that Michael Jordan does well too. It's like even though you associate him with such great success, he's still making it relatable, he's still pulling on people's emotions. And I think that's what really gets the audience's attention here, because you're like, oh, you're so great, but you're still being vulnerable and actually sharing your losses that actually make you even stronger as a person. Stories reveal a truth and a lesson through a story. Yes and yes.
00:10:54.234 - 00:11:15.886, Speaker B: Failure is human. Everyone can relate. Although he's just a superstore. Exactly. And I think this also really humanizes him in a way that people can relate to him. So it doesn't matter how big or successful you are, I think people need way to find to connection with you and the things that you're sharing. Why don't we jump to the next slide? So we're going to throw back to grade eleven english class.
00:11:15.886 - 00:11:46.230, Speaker B: Here are some of the essentials of a great story. So obviously you have your exposition. This is like an introduction. What's happening? Your rising action, a climax. So this is the peak of your story, of where everything is really starting to unfold. Falling action is kind of coming towards a resolution and then your resolution, which is kind of your exit or your finale. So whenever you're pitching to a vc, to a client, telling someone about your project, there's ways you can actually apply this method, this story arc into your presentation.
00:11:46.230 - 00:12:24.244, Speaker B: So if you want to lead with a bang, you want to define your problem or challenge. I'm sure everyone has heard of a tam or what. What is the problem that your product is actually addressing? Presenting ways your problem can be solved. Your climax would actually be how you're defining your solution as a product, a project, a company. The following action would be understanding how the solution actually works and then finally understanding the benefits and putting a plan in action. So, like, what's your roadmap? How are you going to accomplish this? How is this applicable to the real life in ways that people can relate to? So we have some essentials of what really makes a story great. And I have this broken down into three different sections.
00:12:24.244 - 00:13:23.584, Speaker B: So you have your essentials. That's your who, what, where, why, when, how, the customization. So this is the format in which you present. How do you grab someone's attention? How do you actually add value to your audience? Who is paying attention to what you have to say? So I always think, what's in it for them? What's in it for me? How do I appeal to their senses? How do I add in pauses? How do I add in, you know, empathy? How do I make my story, whether it's in writing, if it's a video, if it's a presentation, concise, succinct, how am I going to leverage, you know, visuals, animations, videos, how do you make this compelling for someone to actually follow along? And finally, emotion. How do you invoke someone's emotion to actually get them invested in you and what it is that you're trying to tell them? So, three things storytellers do better. They understand their audience, they make it relatable, and they keep it engaging. So with this storytelling, like I said many times before, it comes in so many different forms.
00:13:23.584 - 00:13:56.364, Speaker B: It can be in the form of visual art, it could be a vlog, it could be podcast, coding, painting. I think you have to think of ways in which you can actually showcase what it is that you want to communicate with an audience in different formats. So it doesn't always have to be in presentation. How can you communicate to someone to set yourself apart and make them understand, especially in the world that we live in with crypto and blockchain, this stuff is so complicated. How do you break it down in a way that's engaging, exciting and easy for someone who's maybe not technical to understand. And so with that, Nat, do you want to tell us your story?
00:13:57.404 - 00:13:57.804, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:13:57.844 - 00:14:00.780, Speaker D: So I thought about which story am I going to tell?
00:14:00.812 - 00:14:01.956, Speaker C: And I feel like there's a lot.
00:14:01.980 - 00:15:06.316, Speaker D: Of many of them to explore, but the one that is really currently that I'm really dealing with the most is through experiences. And since I was very young, I've been hosting people and I've been allowing them to have a space to tell their story. So if you guys went to my events, maybe game nights or modular summit or I had this event for our team as well. Which was paint and dine, which already kind of connects to storytelling, which was normally if you sit at the table, you tell store stories. And then engaging through these activities, like learning about yourself by sketching, that was one of my favorite events that I did. And I allow great mind from all around the world to, you know, share their story and their wisdom. And the latest one that I would like to go through with you is the creation of the infinite space bazaar.
00:15:06.316 - 00:16:11.534, Speaker D: So at Celestia, we were discussing doing a hackathon for a long time and whether if it was online or IOL, we decided to go with the online to have kind of more space for feedback for you building, and to get ready for the in person one. So imagine I got this concept of infinite space with art. And when I was thinking about it, how would I create it and how to make it unique, because I think this is also a way how I express my experiences. Like every event or hackathon or the conferences are a little bit unique and differentiated. I was thinking that infinite space Bazaar is such a broad space that I, someone could get lost. So, and then when I look at the other hackathons, it always had the same process, but I didn't really felt like there's a story behind it. It's just like a one time thing, and then it moves on to next one.
00:16:11.534 - 00:17:13.164, Speaker D: So with infinite space Bazaar and with the houses, we started thinking about, okay, maybe we can start doing like districts, and one district could be about like data storage, and the other one would be a district under the water that would take care of the infinite infrastructure in the infinite space bazaar. And another one could be in the clouds, the cloud library. And then I was exploring more and more, and I think of Harry Potter and the houses. So when we discuss it in a team, we kind of like move the first idea away with the districts, but we kept the houses and we start giving it a story. So our houses have always, but they were four, similar to the Harry Potter. They have different colors, each houses, they have names. As you all know, some of you are already in it.
00:17:13.164 - 00:18:00.008, Speaker D: They have crest, they have mascots. And we gave them just, let's say, kind of like the foundation that led up to here. Now, this is my latest story. And now I want to like give you techniques that you can tell your stories for your project or your presentation. So one could be, one story that we use is ethos, pathos and logos. These are the strategies that you, that helps you to communicate better and also to persuade and convince the audience that your points are valid. So Atos is for the credibility.
00:18:00.008 - 00:19:05.642, Speaker D: So you're backing up when you're talking about, when you're using ethos, pathos and logos, your appeal to emotions, to logic and to credibility. Then there's another converging, then another technique that is called converging ideas, which kind of remind me the story that I just told you about infinite space Bazaar and the process, how it went. You can use it in your presentation as well. Let's say your team, you meet your team, and then you guys start exploring or brainstorming. What do you want to solve or what do you want to work on? So you have a bunch of ideas and you go through all of them in the presentation, and then you still continue have discussion with your team and debates and someone disagree with your idea and you don't agree with the other ideas. But then you kind of find out this compromise and you move towards one idea and then you describe it, how you finish it. The third one that you can use, it's full start, which is more like you're coming.
00:19:05.642 - 00:19:52.864, Speaker D: Your presentation starts at the future, at the vision. So the vision of Webtree is, you know, like focuses on, like data ownership. And you start there, and then you state the arguments and you say, okay, but right now we need to go back to the origin. And you talk about the origin maybe of, you know, you started bitcoin. Or you can talk about modularity, and then you move to the present where it's like, right now, what are we dealing it? What are the problems? And this is the solution, which is our project. And this way, we're going back to the future that we discussed, discussed at the beginning. So these are the three techniques.
00:19:52.864 - 00:20:08.752, Speaker D: The way how you can practice storytelling is you can use all of these three techniques. For example, the Etospatos and logos. One time I was with my friend for getting a coffee, and we're like, what are we going to, you know.
00:20:08.768 - 00:20:09.488, Speaker C: What are we going to do?
00:20:09.536 - 00:21:23.074, Speaker D: And then she was like, well, maybe we can practice this. So she just gave me prompts, for example, like, convinced me that having a dog makes my life better. Or you can, you know, come up with something totally, like, convinced me that staring in the sun for too long hurts my eyes. Or like, you know, so you can do it with practically everything. And the second one is where you define your project in three words. So because normally this, there's like a three words theory where if you're using too many words, people, they just like, okay, which one out of these, all that you just like, thrown at me, I should use, so just use three and then try to, you know, use the techniques that I just discussed and, and try to insert these like three words through the, through the presentation or through the, through this activity. The last one is called campfire and it's maybe more related to the storytelling for, for infinite space Bazaar or for your house where you choose a character in a group and a setting and then a problem.
00:21:23.074 - 00:22:05.724, Speaker D: And then, you know, again, you have like five minutes to kind of like create this story. So main character could be Kayla. She's in the infinite space bazaar and she lost her way to her house. And then you can start. Yes, and then you can go through the process that Kayla described and actually, you know, talk about it and share what everyone came up with. Now, moving on, how to make a, you know, great presentation. First of all, I would like to say that the good thing for us is that no one pays attention.
00:22:05.724 - 00:23:23.254, Speaker D: What you say, they read more and, but mostly the 70% they pay attention. Like, how does that make them feel and how do you present yourself towards them to the audience? Now, if you want to make a great presentation online presentation, you need to first of all define the goal of your presentation. So with your projects, it could be, you know, like introducing your project, making sure that your audience understand with that, you need to understand who you're presenting to. So sometimes when I know who is the person that I'm going to be talking to and I, maybe, you know, my intentions are to convince them or like, you know, like for example, if you want to strive good in hackathon, you should learn something, maybe about the judges or something about the audience. And then you can put it to your presentation. And this way you make them more excited because it will relate to them, it will relate to their interests that they have. And you can share personal story or you can even, you know, the things that they like, you can share within your personal story.
00:23:23.254 - 00:24:41.660, Speaker D: Now, during your presentation, you can ask questions, you don't have to make them answer them, but just, you know, they can think about your questions that you put into your presentation, make it visual, be confident, and always check your connection and quality of your video or mic before. So probably also try to be on time and kind of join before and test all of these things. Now, many of us haven't been presenting daily. Maybe you guys can get nervous or mostly for me as well as being nervous. So I was listening to this podcast and I found this interesting fact from a psychologist that he was explaining that physiologically nervousness, being nervous and being excited evokes the same feelings in your body. So let's say you're getting ready for presentation, but you're nervous now to remove your nervousness, because if you're nervous, you get maybe sweaty hands or you start feeling sick. When I'm excited, I get sweaty hands.
00:24:41.660 - 00:25:13.254, Speaker D: And I'm also like my belly, let's say I have a stomach ache or something. So the only thing you have to do to remove your nervousness is to say that I'm excited. Like, stop saying you're nervous, just say you're excited. And this way you can trick your brain to be more confident and less nervous during your presentations. The next thing that you can do to be less or more prepared and also less nervous is you practice. Because practice makes perfect. You can try using a mirror.
00:25:13.254 - 00:25:47.066, Speaker D: You should probably slow down and you should pause from time to time. If you're sitting, sit still. If you're standing, don't move too much. And sometimes I also feel that if you're looking to your camera, if you're facing it fully, then that can make you nervous too. So if you angle yourself a little bit sideways, it feels kind of like less formal. But you also kind of like ease up. So that helps.
00:25:47.066 - 00:26:48.296, Speaker D: You always know more information about the topic that you're going to talk about before your presentation. You can do some breath work, or you can do like a tongue twist or play or, you know, one more thing that I didn't mention here also, and I would like to, what would like to say with the practicing, what also helps me a lot, and I did it last two presentation was I just go for a walk and then I'm talking to myself. And that wall, that helps a lot too. So that's if you guys want to try that, that really helps. And then don't forget to use our story techniques because now you kind of already have the structure, the ideas and techniques what to use. So, so use that because that's going to help you to feel more confident. Now I just want to talk a little bit more about the community track because not only storytelling is good for your, your technical project, but you are the foundation of this hackathon, the first infinite space bazaar.
00:26:48.296 - 00:27:43.814, Speaker D: And you're the first one that joined these houses. And why not to be the one who is telling, who's writing the whole history and also telling the story. So within the community tracks, you can guys work on like the origins of the houses, the lore, the storytelling, the world building. You can come up and create superpowers and strings for your for your project you can build NFT collections. I've seen many projects. They now have like passports, ids, stamps, like why not to work on that too? With the features of each house you can create merge and designs and some content. So I would encourage you to look into that and really help us to build this community where you were the first one who had the chance to build something like this.
00:27:43.814 - 00:28:28.154, Speaker D: The thing that is to do for now, which I think some of you might be ready, is we had a, I think it's been a month since we announced our hackathon and the kickoff was about two weeks ago, three. Two weeks. And so I created this pitch template which you can use. And so I'm just giving you example here. This template has five backgrounds. Four are for the houses that you're in and the fifth one is for the inter house collaboration. If you want to share that and what basically does.
00:28:28.154 - 00:29:31.928, Speaker D: If you want to introduce your project, this is a great exercise where you just use this template and you write your project, project name or one liner. What is it that you're doing? And then below you just write one sentence or two sentences to describe your project and you can share it on Twitter or any of your social media and see if the audience is interested in what you're building. I would also encourage different hackers to give feedback to each other because you know, you can guys give feedback to each other. You can reshare, you can and ask as well. Like we if you're going to be sharing this, we'll happy to give you feedback and look into your project. And I think this is one of the smaller ways how you can practice or it doesn't take too much time and it's helpful for you to test it on the audience. This is the another example.
00:29:31.928 - 00:30:09.594, Speaker D: This is the template for people that work. They have a team from multiple houses. So for example, you know, I'm building infinite space with Artis is the NFT collection for the hackathon participants with house features. So this just tells me that there's, the whole team is from different houses and they're working on this. And you know, if I see it on Twitter I can maybe get in touch with them because I'm excited or interested in the same thing. I see how can I help them? Or maybe you know about someone that already does that. So you want to connect them and give them this feedback.
00:30:09.594 - 00:30:28.542, Speaker D: So I think this is kind of interesting activity for you to test. I will leave the template on discord. I will share it after this workshop. And now I'm gonna leave it. I'm gonna stop here and let's see.
00:30:28.558 - 00:30:30.274, Speaker C: If you guys have any questions.
00:30:30.884 - 00:31:40.758, Speaker B: I actually see one question in the chat from Sammy. Do you think storytelling techniques in blockchain space are different than in other environments, such as business, sports, food, for example? In my opinion, I don't think they're different. I think storytelling of all forms and types at its core, just evokes some sort of emotion and really appeals to the audience that they're trying to communicate their messaging to. So I've said so many times to a lot of people who work in blockchain crypto, sometimes you are going to have a very technical audience who's going to understand exactly what you're talking about. But if you want to, you know, change your content based off of who you're speaking to, I think it's always best to go for speaking in language that is really simple for people to understand, doesn't require any technical understanding or have, you know, like, acronyms or sort of, I guess, technical words that maybe aren't known to a wider audience. I think that's just good to do in practice and try and break down your ideas, because I personally feel if you can't break your idea down into a simple concept, you may not even understand it yourself. But, yeah, no, I think storytelling applies to all areas.
00:31:40.758 - 00:31:49.774, Speaker B: It doesn't matter if it's business, sports, food, content, if you see blogs. I mean, everyone is just telling a story in a different way, even the events.
00:31:49.814 - 00:32:31.784, Speaker C: Right? Like, for example, I start somewhere, so I think about it in a way that you can either, like, have the event through, like, time or through this space. So if I'm thinking about, like, game night, I had it in the castle, so it was like, okay, so now I need to make the game night related to the storytelling, that it's more related to the past. So I need to make it related to the community as well. So when they enter, you have the beginning, and then when you go through the space, there's, like, different things that are waiting for you. And then again, like, you're ending with the exits. I feel like. I think the templates, like Kayla said, it's not different.
00:32:31.784 - 00:33:05.496, Speaker C: I also. I think maybe what is handy here is that because we have so many technical terms making it in a story, it's much easier. Easier to explain it to the non technical person as well and give them a lot of examples about. Yeah, it makes us easier to understand. That's what I was talking about before with Yas. Like, yes, if I would be like, okay, can you explain me this? You explain it through the easier way, but in a story. So you can talk about facts.
00:33:05.496 - 00:33:13.742, Speaker C: So you can talk about stories, but talking about facts in a story is always better and makes it, makes it more relevant.
00:33:13.918 - 00:33:51.804, Speaker B: And remember, I was also going to add in, I think one of the most iconic examples of this is when the iPhone first launched. If anyone remembers, the Steve Jobs came out, where he's like, it's a phone, it's a compass, it's connected to the Internet. And he just kept repeating that. But never once has he ever brought up like, this is the OS and this is how this works, and this is the type of code we use because none of that is really relevant to an audience watching that. I think he was actually just presenting the problem that they had solved with the new iPhone, and that's what made it so groundbreaking and revolutionary. He didn't really need, you know, a pitch deck. He didn't need overly complicated slides.
00:33:51.804 - 00:34:24.708, Speaker B: It was very minimal. And it just about the impact that he was sharing of, like, look at this thing that we made. It's beautiful. It's brilliant. It was always focused on, you know, the product and the emotion that that it evoked of this being the most sophisticated piece of technology that we've seen. And I'd be interested to see how we can actually kind of leverage that concept again. I mean, everyone knows Steve Jobs to be a great center, but how we can use that to talk about, like, crypto and blockchain of like, okay, we have all these technical components, and this is how, you know, the chains work, or this is the difference between being modular or not.
00:34:24.708 - 00:34:30.217, Speaker B: But what does that actually mean for an end user? What does that mean for a customer? What can that mean for a business?
00:34:30.385 - 00:35:09.343, Speaker C: How does that benefit them? And I think sometimes we'll miss what are the most important practices for developing straightforward skills as the communicators who aim to be, well, I guess like the things that you discussed before. So I know that sometimes, but you should figure it out. What is the weakness that you have in the storytelling? Because you can tell a good story, but once you start telling it to people and there's hundreds of people in front of you, maybe you face so.
00:35:09.503 - 00:35:11.479, Speaker D: You know, figure it out a way.
00:35:11.551 - 00:35:17.983, Speaker C: How to stop this. Whether it is, as I said, like maybe trying to convince your brain that.
00:35:18.023 - 00:35:21.644, Speaker D: You'Re excited instead of nervous, or.
00:35:24.024 - 00:35:24.336, Speaker C: If.
00:35:24.360 - 00:35:58.964, Speaker D: You'Re sometimes looking for words, like, maybe try to read more if you're trying to. And I wanted to also mention that I think, like, developing storytelling skills. One thing that you could develop and it's good to have for storytelling is being funny. Like, having something funny to say within your story, because people love to laugh. Right, Fazzy, I'm just using your quote right now, but that also makes your story a little bit exciting.
00:36:01.384 - 00:36:42.224, Speaker B: I also think one of the most important practices is actually just practicing and iterating. So if you are really focused on being a good presenter verbally and you want to do on stage presentation presentations, start presenting as practice in front of your friends or in front of your family and get their feedback of, like, was this funny? Did this make the impact it needed to? And just trying to practice on different audiences to see if the message is landing the way you want it to. And, like Nat said, you know, just trying to keep things concise. How do you articulate what it is that you want to say in a way that's meaningful? And, like, how do you always incorporate humor or emotion into it? It that actually is going to impact your audience.
00:36:43.484 - 00:37:25.424, Speaker D: I think also, one of the practices that we did with Kayla when we were at the beach club, which was, I hosted this four days event for only for girls, and we did a bunch of things that makes us grow on, like, a career level and also personal level. And Kayla came with this storytelling activity where we had to. She was like, all right, everyone, bring your wallets. And I was like, okay, fair enough. I know you, like, two days, and you're wanting me to bring my wallet. Okay, so then we have to all broad, like, our wallets, bring our wallets. And she was like, pass it on to the next person.
00:37:25.504 - 00:37:27.312, Speaker C: So we pass it on to the next person.
00:37:27.488 - 00:37:53.154, Speaker D: And then we had to write a story about the person, depending on the wallet that we got. So you could look into the wallet. Like, you could see if it has cash and maybe doesn't have cash. And some of the stories that came out were super hilarious. And also, sometimes it was, like, super emotional. So sometimes we cry over laughter. Sometimes we cry because it was just very deep story.
00:37:53.154 - 00:38:12.424, Speaker D: Sometimes we cry because of misunderstanding of what is expired date and what is the birth date, and. But. But that was really good practice. And I think, like, if you have a group of friends, like, this is really, really fun to. To kind of develop your storytelling.
00:38:14.404 - 00:38:14.692, Speaker C: And.
00:38:14.708 - 00:38:17.316, Speaker D: That was thanks to Kayla. Yep. Thank you.
00:38:17.420 - 00:38:28.684, Speaker B: I agree. I think even signing up for, like, an improv class or anything like that could also be fun. And I think we have one more question from Nicholas. What is your favorite myth?
00:38:33.184 - 00:38:34.484, Speaker D: It's a good question.
00:38:41.264 - 00:38:43.752, Speaker C: I never had this. Do you have a. Do you have any.
00:38:43.808 - 00:38:48.480, Speaker B: I don't have an answer. I would say maybe like, a greek. Yeah. I have to think about it.
00:38:48.512 - 00:38:53.794, Speaker D: I'll post it on Twitter. What is your favorite, miss?
00:38:54.454 - 00:38:58.910, Speaker C: Bigfoot. Wow.
00:38:59.062 - 00:38:59.994, Speaker B: Mermaids.
00:39:00.974 - 00:39:33.494, Speaker D: Yeah, I think, like, I have this from. From when I was young, so we used to travel a lot, like, long distances with. With my family, and there was this forest behind us, and there was. There were always these, like, red lights coming out of the forest. And I don't know the terms in English because it was just made up names in Czech. But my dad was always like, there's this, like, magician with, like, a bloody dog. And the bloody dog takes the kids, and.
00:39:33.494 - 00:39:55.454, Speaker D: And. And, like, it expanded to, like, when we went to play golf, there was this, like, person that who knew this myth to. And then he got bitten by a dog. And then when someone would ask him, like, what happened to you? Like, it was this, like, bloody dog in from this, like, forest. And I remember I was, like, super scared about it, but at the same time, I was really enjoying this myth.
00:39:58.194 - 00:39:58.714, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:39:58.794 - 00:40:04.534, Speaker D: Unicorns, big food, the Denver airport theories. Yes. That's a good one.
00:40:05.034 - 00:40:05.418, Speaker C: Good.
00:40:05.466 - 00:40:11.686, Speaker D: YouTube. Like, an episode on rain in Dubai.
00:40:11.790 - 00:40:23.274, Speaker B: Yep. Another myth. Right now it's very popular in crypto. Crypto people just causing all these unnatural natural storms and earthquakes.
00:40:25.614 - 00:40:48.184, Speaker D: What are your favorite success stories with web three? Narrative building? I would say, like, the ones that I like are from Celestia. Um, I think Ekram is doing really good job, and, um, he, you know, with the build whatever, with celestia underneath.
00:40:48.344 - 00:40:49.164, Speaker B: Modular.
00:40:49.584 - 00:41:09.464, Speaker C: Not maximal, as a modular. But these are really strong words and kind of like, it resonates with everyone. So. So this is. This is my favorite. Sorry. Thinking modular.
00:41:10.044 - 00:41:12.464, Speaker D: Yeah, thinking about modularity.
00:41:18.844 - 00:41:45.216, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you both so much. I wanted to ask anyone if they have any more questions for Nat and Kayla to please drop them in the chat. But if you all have any last messages for everyone, it would be great to hear. And if there are no questions, we'll go ahead and shut this down. We have a. Thank you, Queens.
00:41:45.400 - 00:41:47.804, Speaker C: Thank you. Thank you.
00:41:48.184 - 00:41:52.524, Speaker B: You can follow us on Twitter, too. I was gonna say Nat and I will be there.
00:41:52.864 - 00:41:58.954, Speaker A: Good question, actually. Yeah. If there's. Is there a best place to reach out to you, like, discord? Twitter?
00:41:59.774 - 00:42:01.634, Speaker B: I'd say probably twitter for me.
00:42:02.374 - 00:42:05.634, Speaker D: We have two more, which is what is jars favorite story?
00:42:08.974 - 00:42:13.054, Speaker A: Yeah. I don't know. I really don't know.
00:42:13.174 - 00:42:14.590, Speaker D: Build whatever, bro.
00:42:14.782 - 00:42:22.824, Speaker A: Yeah, build whatever. I think out of Yaz's. Answers. The Denver airport theories are the. The funniest.
00:42:25.244 - 00:42:28.944, Speaker B: I need to see. I need to see the theories. I haven't read up on all them.
00:42:29.684 - 00:42:32.284, Speaker D: I'll send you the video. It's, like, 30 minutes long.
00:42:32.324 - 00:42:36.104, Speaker C: I've been watching it, like, at the Denver report. I was like, okay, where are those things?
00:42:37.964 - 00:42:40.388, Speaker D: Favorite house right now? Right answer.
00:42:40.436 - 00:42:41.424, Speaker C: Lumen tree.
00:42:42.484 - 00:42:51.704, Speaker D: All of our. Like, all of them are my babies. But according to the questions. The questionnaire that I did, I am a lumen tree. So hell, yeah.
00:42:51.744 - 00:42:52.424, Speaker C: Let's go.
