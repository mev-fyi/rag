00:00:00.800 - 00:00:05.022, Speaker A: I am here with Victor G from Manta network. Welcome to Sovereign radio.
00:00:05.086 - 00:00:06.174, Speaker B: Thank you, Anna.
00:00:06.342 - 00:00:10.590, Speaker A: Let's kick off with a little bit about Manta network. What is Manta today?
00:00:10.750 - 00:00:54.810, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, like, we've been building this for past four years, since 2020. And, you know, like in the beginning we are like working on privacy, Dax. And then like start from Polkadot. And right now we are the first modular l two with celestial underneath and still the only generic roll up using celestial DA. And generally we focus on adoption, focus on native yield, focus on great user experience. And we are op stack and going to add type one prover on top of it to be the Gke VM. But we still keep the polkadot parachain.
00:00:54.810 - 00:01:00.654, Speaker B: So it's Manta Atlantic, which is the l one. But also we have the Manta Pacific on Ethereum.
00:01:00.742 - 00:01:20.158, Speaker A: Nice. Yeah, I mean, I know you guys from 2020 and actually I think you were even on my show at some point back then. So back then you were very much like in the Polkadot ecosystem. Then there was this move over to Ethereum. Where did you go first? Like you're an op chain now, but had you tried anything else in the meantime?
00:01:20.254 - 00:02:07.114, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, like, we have a lot of research, you know, like back in the days, we build the whole stuff, like gross 16, you know, like some privacy, like payment, Dex and Polkadot. That's still the stack. We are still open source and it's still there, but we didn't launch because, you know, there's a lot of privacy concern, there's a lot of regulation concern and we don't want to get trouble for that. You know, it's not make sense, but I, it only happens recent years, actually, you know, it's four years before. That's fine, but we have to survive. We keep building more stuff. So like kind of we start finding, you know, like L2.
00:02:07.114 - 00:02:38.440, Speaker B: There's opportunities and especially in the modular space, we're really bullish. I started to know like Mostafa's papers and, you know, like really like 2020. And I find, you know, like we can be the first generic roll up on top of it. And the last year, like July we launched Testnet and September we launched the Minnet, and December we started a, you know, new paradigm, which is a TVL, you know, boost campaign.
00:02:38.780 - 00:02:41.084, Speaker A: And 2023, you're talking about last year.
00:02:41.092 - 00:02:42.716, Speaker B: Yeah, 2020. Yeah, last year. Oh, wow.
00:02:42.748 - 00:02:43.092, Speaker A: Okay.
00:02:43.156 - 00:03:14.352, Speaker B: And early this year we launch, you know, token and there's lot of things happens. Yeah, it's still like recently we have lots of updates, you know, like we focus on RWA for the institution side, work with Binance Sifu for the centralized custodian cd five product, also work with like Blackrock Securitize, their buildup fund for the like native yield stablecoin. So that's something, you know, really exciting stuff.
00:03:14.416 - 00:03:19.200, Speaker A: Is Manta Atlantic and Pacific bridged in any way? Is there any connection between these two things?
00:03:19.240 - 00:03:29.304, Speaker B: Yeah, there's bridge and we somehow build our own bridge and leverage like seller layer zero and the Polkadot XCM.
00:03:29.392 - 00:03:30.080, Speaker A: Oh, cool.
00:03:30.200 - 00:03:37.912, Speaker B: But it's like there's no working product. We build a whole user interface. Build, integrate everything together.
00:03:38.016 - 00:03:43.928, Speaker A: But you would need a product built on top, like basically a user interface to actually use it. But you've just built the underlying stuff.
00:03:43.984 - 00:03:51.516, Speaker B: Yeah, the underlying. We leverage all these, but also there are some like messaging stuff of our own.
00:03:51.628 - 00:03:55.716, Speaker A: So now you're firmly, I mean you, I guess what is it? Manta Pacific?
00:03:55.828 - 00:03:57.444, Speaker B: Yeah, it's the focus.
00:03:57.612 - 00:04:06.132, Speaker A: That's the focus and that's firmly in this like Ethereum land and connected. I guess the DA layer is in the modular stack in Celestia.
00:04:06.196 - 00:04:07.160, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.
00:04:07.660 - 00:04:15.130, Speaker A: Do you see yourself moving even more towards the modular side of things? Are there other integrations that you can do in that direction?
00:04:15.590 - 00:04:47.720, Speaker B: Like I'm not sure you see like nibra hats. Oh yeah, yeah. There like a lot of exciting stuff that's funded by fumua. He left Manta last year and started working on Nibra. And we still good friend and we finally figure out there's also ways to work and you know, we can add proofread on top of op stack. That's something exciting. And also we just talked to hyperlink, we are the first one on the evm side.
00:04:47.720 - 00:05:23.018, Speaker B: Integrate hyperlink, nitro and the neutron and tool like Celestial. And there's also ways to integrate more like cosmos chains, a few. Interoperability is the key in the future and we are getting more and more modular. So in the future we just keep building the like user facing infrastructure and all the fundamental more under layer stuff. We have lots of partners working on it.
00:05:23.194 - 00:05:34.630, Speaker A: I wonder about how you actually interface with all of those bridges. You just sort of mentioned a few of them, but did they have to integrate with you? Do they have to deploy something or can you deploy for them on yourself?
00:05:35.010 - 00:05:55.042, Speaker B: It actually depends. Like for layer zero, they have to integrate us and they did. And wormhole is the same and accelerates the same. But hyperlink, we can just use your stack and they don't have to say oh yes or no. We don't have to talk to them. More permission, less use the see their dock and then just build something.
00:05:55.226 - 00:06:09.564, Speaker A: How is the l two space at the moment? I feel like this past six months, it's been sort of like a rough ride. There's some l two s that you're still seeing. Kind of like keeping the steam and then others have suffered a little bit. Yeah. How do you feel through all this?
00:06:09.612 - 00:06:38.600, Speaker B: I feel, you know, it's getting more and more competition. Like, we are now the first l two and we are definitely not the last one. So, like, we launched in a good time, I think, you know, like for Minat, we launched in the first celestial one. Yeah, super align with Celestial. And it's good combination because we focus on apex area. They focus on like, you know, different area. So we have this, you know, combination on like, narrative wise and adoption wise.
00:06:38.600 - 00:07:14.242, Speaker B: Because in Asia, like, and especially for users, if you go like Thailand or like Indonesia, I wear this shirt, they just tell, talk to me. Oh, I know, menta. I have like, you know, see some dapps built on top of you guys. And I got really surprised when I visited Bali island, like last month. So we did really great community there. And I think in general, like, we focus on developer in this, like, emerging market interesting. And we find, you know, like all these builders, they don't have vc back then.
00:07:14.242 - 00:07:37.140, Speaker B: It's not like New York or SF, but they really commit building stuff. It's like ether scam from Malaysia, like, you know, Jupiter from Malaysia. Those teams are find the product market fit before raising or before launch token. So that's something like how to build high quality product rather than quantity product.
00:07:37.300 - 00:07:50.740, Speaker A: Is Manta an EVM then? Is it solidity code that would be deployed? Okay, Opie stack. Yeah, it makes sense. So you sort of mentioned a few teams there. But like, what is adoption? Like, what is being built? What kinds of projects, what kinds of things are you seeing?
00:07:50.820 - 00:08:25.722, Speaker B: So, like, I can say there's no missing piece right now. So there's gaming, like there's on chain game and there's like Defi, perv, Dex, everything. But like on the user side generally, I think emerging market users still over focus because the gas fee is super low compared to other Iot because celestial. For the focus we like from the project level, we really focus on RWA. So we can bring extra level of the yield on top of the, like, existing, like, you know, crypto. Yeah.
00:08:25.746 - 00:08:30.682, Speaker A: So, okay, is that almost like you get like, is this like where you have like, bonds in the real world and they have yield.
00:08:30.866 - 00:08:49.666, Speaker B: Okay, exactly like TBL from like, Blackrock buildup fund and cd five, like Ethina. But we work with finance on that, so that's kind of the extra yield. But there's also the LST token native on vantage. So this tokens can use in different deFi protocols.
00:08:49.738 - 00:08:53.726, Speaker A: Wait, so gaming manta has an LST? Does Manta have a validator set then?
00:08:53.798 - 00:08:58.718, Speaker B: Does it have its own LST? Just use like layer zero to launch. Yeah.
00:08:58.774 - 00:08:58.982, Speaker A: Okay.
00:08:59.006 - 00:09:06.650, Speaker B: Okay, so it's permissionless, but it's based on real assets or based on partners launching these products.
00:09:07.150 - 00:09:16.070, Speaker A: Cool. I wondered. So we're here at the modular summit. We're recording here. What is the feeling? I know it's still day one that we're doing this particular interview, but, yeah.
00:09:16.190 - 00:09:36.844, Speaker B: This is a larger side event, I have to say. Right, for the whole UCC. And I can't believe it's three days. I mean, like, it's really great. I mean, like, I'm really looking forward it. We have booths, you know, and also I'm really focused on adoption. So, like, we are.
00:09:36.844 - 00:09:52.260, Speaker B: We are sharing a lot of our experience in the modular space about, you know, how we educate, you know, end user in the emerging market about modularity. Clearly, I don't think, you know, if we talk about Linode and the block space, it now makes sense.
00:09:52.340 - 00:09:52.876, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:09:52.908 - 00:09:59.132, Speaker B: And we just talk about there's cheaper gas fee and. Which is extremely make sense for a lot of users.
00:09:59.196 - 00:09:59.740, Speaker A: That's very cool.
00:09:59.780 - 00:10:20.032, Speaker B: And this actually works. And compared to, you know, like, a lot of other layer tools, I feel, you know, we are really unique in the, like, RWA side and also on the, you know, culture building side. Like, we have lot of, like, meme culture stuff. We work with Bunk actually announced yesterday.
00:10:20.136 - 00:10:20.696, Speaker A: What was it?
00:10:20.728 - 00:10:21.296, Speaker B: Bunk.
00:10:21.408 - 00:10:21.848, Speaker A: Bunk.
00:10:21.904 - 00:10:43.138, Speaker B: It's like a Solana meme coin. It's kind of random, but it's really funny. Like, I like dog. You know, I'm a dog person. And yeah, I like that culture. They're really cool guys. And, you know, we will focus a lot of this practical stuff, but L2 space is interesting.
00:10:43.138 - 00:10:51.818, Speaker B: Everyone have their own focus. But I feel, you know, you have to be like, user. Have to like that. Otherwise cannot survive.
00:10:51.914 - 00:11:05.650, Speaker A: Yeah. Generally in the markets that you are kind of going out in, how are you doing it? Like, I hear you're sort of like, playing into the meme stuff. But is there anything else on the ground that you actually have to do to get people to use it?
00:11:05.730 - 00:11:42.028, Speaker B: I mean, I feel like there's a lot of different things like you know, first the product level. Like we design the product really user friendly and really targets, easier to understand and pretty straightforward. And we don't say there's some potential, some stuff make the rules really clear. You join something, you can get, whatever something. It's really straightforward. And on the other level, the distribution channel, we have people in Vietnam, we have people in Indonesia. It's like part of our core team.
00:11:42.028 - 00:12:08.658, Speaker B: So like in foundation, like Manta Foundation, super diverse, like super worldwide and focus on emerging market, focus on users. If we find there's a place have a lot of users, like recently Turkey, we hire a lot of people there and we work with local partners there, work with local exchange, get more and more distribution channel.
00:12:08.794 - 00:12:13.098, Speaker A: What's the most exciting use case or application you've seen deployed on Manta?
00:12:13.274 - 00:12:53.846, Speaker B: I mean I feel like basically the cd five product for institution works. They want to still keep the asset off chain and in the custodian. But at the same time we launched RST on top of it. That's something really interesting for institutions, especially in Asia, like Hong Kong listed company, they pretty into that. But for the like retails I feel you know, still gaming, but like relax game, small game, but you know, keep literation every week. That is something like also distribution channels through Telegram. It can be really interesting because everyone.
00:12:53.918 - 00:13:11.860, Speaker A: Using Telegram in the just mentioned games. I gotta say like I'm out of the loop on games. What are the games getting to? Like at what quality level are they, would you say? Are they still sort of like at. Remember when there were Facebook games and you were like grinding, chopping wood or farming or whatever, is it like that still?
00:13:11.940 - 00:13:19.004, Speaker B: Yeah, it's still like you don't have to make the game super complicated, but people spend time on it.
00:13:19.092 - 00:13:25.756, Speaker A: Do you see any games kind of elevating from there? Do you see any that are becoming a little bit more, I don't know, sophisticated?
00:13:25.828 - 00:14:03.694, Speaker B: I feel the design like it's more like, it's not like the design, like the art kind of design, visual design. It's kind of like the level of design in the mechanism or the level of design in the incentive. It goes different. That's getting sophisticated and it's getting super sophisticated interesting. But for the, like, I don't think AAA game work. It takes three years build nothing and this every step goes on chain. It can really hard to make it, but like every week there come a new one.
00:14:03.694 - 00:14:06.174, Speaker B: So that's something really exciting for users.
00:14:06.222 - 00:14:15.734, Speaker A: But what could allow a AAA game to come on? Do you think it's like the l three s could maybe do it. Still not, it's about speed, not about price, I guess, even. Right.
00:14:15.782 - 00:14:35.826, Speaker B: I feel it's about like they don't need blockchain, they just don't need it. Yeah. I just feel if, you know, the company build triple A game, they need to pay extremely high resources to go to market. They need to buy advertisement, all of this. But web3 don't have advertisement, people. Advertisement is airdrop.
00:14:35.898 - 00:14:36.218, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:14:36.274 - 00:14:38.190, Speaker B: So it's different like storage.
00:14:38.530 - 00:14:55.642, Speaker A: Yeah, still I have, I mean, there's this case of like the skins in a game being transferable. You hear this, you know, for years, and I'm wondering if like so maybe it's not an entire game on chain, but like a part of it on chain. A marketplace on chain. Have you seen anything like that?
00:14:55.706 - 00:15:30.542, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. I feel, you know, like more and more this kind of happens. But I think fully on chain games still very, very early. I mean we try to build toolings called ZK app, like make hiding information, ZK Circuit using Sircom just to make developers, they just call the SDK or contract to build some fully onchain game. But it's really hard to go to market because user, they don't care if it's fully on channel if it's using ZK for a lot of use cases.
00:15:30.726 - 00:15:33.450, Speaker A: Cool. What's next for Manta?
00:15:33.990 - 00:16:14.250, Speaker B: I mean, still we care about user and by infrastructure level. I'm really excited. Decentralized sequencer, I feel that can make landscape change because that's still one of the missing pieces for decentralization and we want to push forward that and proof aggregation, bullish on it. And like these kind of things I feel is really modular. It's not like we need a new monolithic chain, but we need some small pieces to improve existing auto. But these small pieces can make significant change for user experience or developer experience.
00:16:14.370 - 00:16:15.530, Speaker A: Significant differences.
00:16:15.650 - 00:16:15.970, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:16:16.010 - 00:16:26.898, Speaker A: That's so cool. Thanks for sharing all of this and the story of Manta. And also I also find these kind of new emerging prover marketplaces and the shared sequencers fascinating.
00:16:26.994 - 00:16:28.650, Speaker B: Exactly. Looking forward that.
00:16:28.730 - 00:16:35.410, Speaker A: Thanks so much and thank you for watching this episode of Sovereign radio. Maybe we'll see you at the next one.
00:16:35.530 - 00:16:36.930, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks for having me.
