00:00:01.000 - 00:00:23.598, Speaker A: Hey, guys, welcome to, like, our next episode of the sovereign radio podcast here at Modular Summit. I'm Hart Lamber, co founder of cross protocol and apparently part time podcaster. I'm here with Rushi, co founder of Movement Labs. We're gonna talk about movement, move, sovereign, modular, integrated.
00:00:23.654 - 00:00:27.414, Speaker B: Any of the next buzzwords, blockchains. All the buzzwords, all the buzzwords in between.
00:00:27.582 - 00:00:30.910, Speaker A: Yeah. Thanks, Ruchi. Glad to have you here.
00:00:31.030 - 00:00:40.486, Speaker B: Thanks for having me, man. It's a good day in Brussels. Hopefully getting out of here soon, but excited to have a first day, moderate summit and seeing a lot of good folks here.
00:00:40.678 - 00:00:57.630, Speaker A: Cool. So, I mean, I always think it's useful on these to give a little bit of the origin story, just like how you got into crypto, how you started movement. And I think it's probably quite interesting just knowing the history of move, move, movement and all this stuff you're doing. So, yeah, tell me more.
00:00:57.750 - 00:01:20.610, Speaker B: Yeah, so, started off in crypto, I would say, four and a half years ago, just early engineering. Was more a rust based engineer, and learned some study early on as well. I'd say November or August 2022. I was in college with my co founder. We went to Vanderbilt University, read this article. It said Facebook was building new programming language. And here was opportunity for.
00:01:20.610 - 00:01:54.230, Speaker B: We were used, like, five users on Cosmos and ten users on ethereum. And here's opportunity for billions of users to come to crypto through Facebook. So that got me excited. Started learning about move, reading about move, learned about object oriented state, learned about formal verification, why it's important. And then November 2022, around FTX is when movement started. The general thesis was, how do we bring this great programming language and framework that was designed for Facebook and didn't actually pan out and bring it to EVM land. Started off in the Avenger system, actually, and then made our way to ethereum.
00:01:54.230 - 00:01:58.246, Speaker B: And now movement is the first movie, VM, L2, Ethereum.
00:01:58.438 - 00:02:19.300, Speaker A: Okay, so, yeah, so backing it up. Right. So Facebook built moves for Libra DM, and that whole story happened. For somebody that's, like, deep in the weeds. I think it's interesting, from my perspective, to hear you tell me why move is so great. Like, what it gives people that the EVM or SVM doesn't.
00:02:19.380 - 00:02:46.578, Speaker B: Yeah, so it's two things. It's speed and security speed. Side, you have block STM, which is the main optimistic parallelization engine. So you think of it Solana, but with Solana, you have to manage stake concurrently. So it's harder for developers to a parallel transactions and b you have a lot of transaction clashing with block STM. You essentially don't need to worry about how transactions are managing state. So you need to deploy smart contracts, deploy fully launching games, and you'll have high throughput experience.
00:02:46.578 - 00:03:17.704, Speaker B: So, long story short, you have really fast transactions with the VM level, and it's done and abstracted away from you. And second thing, which is kind of unique from SVM and other paralyzed vms, is security aspect. You have formal verification runtime through the move prover. So think of your favorite auditor. They charge like 100 grand, 200 grand to audit their protocol. They're probably the only profitable company crypto, but yes. So they're always auditing at certain points, they probably audit your code three times for mainnet with move you audio code in runtime.
00:03:17.704 - 00:03:52.030, Speaker B: So when you execute smart contract, it checks for resource type, memory safety. Hey, is this account getting hacked? Is there some kind of integer overflow that you check for so you can actually stop the $4.5 billion we see every year in razor t attacks? Integer overflows, arithmetic operations. A lot of these stupid attacks in DeFi are just like, oh, the integer overflowed? Or there was some kind of math issue, and that doesn't happen. Could you check for a runtime? So essentially, it's 90% more secure than EVM stops, more than like 90% of all attacks. So the fastest and most secure vm, and we're bringing it to Ethereum.
00:03:52.330 - 00:03:56.722, Speaker A: Okay, cool. So then the move evm or mevm, what's that?
00:03:56.826 - 00:04:26.526, Speaker B: So we built an interpreter on top of the move VM that supports bytecode. So if you want to deploy Uniswap, Aave curve, any of these EVM protocols. In the past, you had to write move code, which is a friction. Right. Solana had this issue for the first few years where learning rust was difficult. Onboarding developers took a lot of brute force, and swing opto is kind of in the same bubble where it's kind of difficult to onboard these developers. So the way we looked at it was like, over the next four years, you're going to benefit from the move dev rel and all the efforts that leading layer ones and us are putting in.
00:04:26.526 - 00:04:39.210, Speaker B: But we also want to support EVM compatibility today. So the movie EVM is a fully EVM compatible interpreter that lives on top of MovM. Obviously, writing move is still better for a stack, but we support backwards compatibility.
00:04:39.670 - 00:04:50.462, Speaker A: Okay, so it's like a stopgap. It's like we can bring EVM apps to move without rewriting code. Then the vision or dream here is developers will start writing native move code.
00:04:50.566 - 00:05:10.902, Speaker B: It's like solely in Solana. We still support solidity. It's not the best on Solana, but the thesis is we want to support solidity script and then nurture remove development so we can support both the core defi apps and core protocols will be written and moved for us. But if there's compound or something that wants to deploy and is deploying, we're able to support them.
00:05:11.046 - 00:05:22.334, Speaker A: Okay, cool. So let's back it up and then say movement labs, like the company that you co founded, what are your products? What do people use? Maybe go into that.
00:05:22.382 - 00:05:37.252, Speaker B: So it's movement l two. That is the main defi port or main infrastructure protocol, where you bring the MeVm and movie VM to Ethereum, and you have m one, which is a decentralized shared sequencer, which I'm sure we'll get into centralized shared sequencers as well.
00:05:37.446 - 00:05:57.608, Speaker A: Yeah, lots to talk about there, but. Okay, let's do the l two. So the movement l two, the pitch here is. Here's an l two that has the advantages of the Movm and has the portability of evm code through Mevm, your interpreter. And that's live.
00:05:57.784 - 00:05:59.792, Speaker B: Yep, it's already live in Devnet.
00:05:59.976 - 00:06:03.704, Speaker A: Live in Devnet. So very close to being live live.
00:06:03.792 - 00:06:08.812, Speaker B: So we have Testnet coming out in two weeks, end of this July, and mainnet target September.
00:06:08.916 - 00:06:50.090, Speaker A: Okay, which is. Okay, guys, September. Heard it here right now, but ambitious, but soon, which is both, I'm sure, very stressful for you, but also extremely exciting. Tell me about the ecosystem that's building here, what you're excited about. Who have you been able to attract? Because I would sense that trying to pull developers into a new vm, a new standard, is generally pretty challenging. Maybe this has been made easier because Facebook and meta did spend so many resources on developing the move language. But tell me about getting developers to build on this ecosystem.
00:06:50.170 - 00:07:07.460, Speaker B: I think what's interesting is that we inherit all the work that Apple C have done. So we support both sales move and both developers. Some of devs are just coming directly from those ecosystems. Like Meridian. They raise 4 million. They're a core defi protocol. Dex, you have echelon that raise three, a core lighting protocol.
00:07:07.460 - 00:07:34.290, Speaker B: So you have the two or three defi apps. But I think that's not really where we're here for. We're not here to build another EVM on that has copy paste Dex lending protocols. What's interesting is that we have a stack where people can launch customized high tip or roll ups. So we just announced Nexia, which is a movie on bitcoin. So ability to bring this high tip execution environment to bitcoin standard is pretty interesting. Then we up network, which we announced two days ago, which is the first movement phone.
00:07:34.290 - 00:07:52.630, Speaker B: This is a company based in Kyoto. Already sold 10,000 phones. Guys are Xtron and X Samsung. So a combination of both. And it's super cool to see a mobile phone designed for Ethereum have defi apps built into it. But also isn't a crypto phone. It's sold as a Samsung phone.
00:07:52.630 - 00:08:06.100, Speaker B: So that's super cool. It's called Op network hq. You should check it out. And those are more of like the weird plays, I would say bracket. It's like a polymarket pumped up fun mix. That's super exciting. The team is X treasured out folks.
00:08:06.100 - 00:08:30.976, Speaker B: And they're building a fully on chain prediction markets with a meme coin generator inside. And then the fully on chain games are always interesting. So infinite seas is MMO. That is a wartime warfare game. And they're able to do all the assets on chain without needing to mint off chain. Obviously at the core, Defi, and we want to be secure defi. But Ethereum, where LP's feel comfortable, like comfortable deploying ETH and not getting hacked.
00:08:30.976 - 00:08:36.168, Speaker B: But beyond, that's how we nurture these consumer and gamefi apps as well that can be on chain.
00:08:36.304 - 00:08:37.792, Speaker A: It's actually a lot, man.
00:08:37.896 - 00:08:39.300, Speaker B: Yeah, that's pretty cool.
00:08:39.840 - 00:08:40.256, Speaker A: Okay.
00:08:40.288 - 00:08:54.700, Speaker B: That's most of my day to day. It's just like, after you get to this point, it's like, how do you differentiate? Because I think the market's kind of saturated that there's so many EVMo tools that have launched and there's a lot of infrastructure fatigue. So now it's really focused on applayer. How can you nurture these important apps?
00:08:55.090 - 00:09:08.154, Speaker A: So, okay, so for the movement l two, is it right to think of it as its own stack? Like op stack and like movement l two is like another stack. That's the move equivalent.
00:09:08.202 - 00:09:27.808, Speaker B: I think there's a lot of role frameworks. You have the op stack, you have the Polygon CDK, you have arbitrary orbit. You have ten da layers. The question do we need all of them? We'll get into that, but I think no one's really innovating execution layer. They're saying build whatever, which is why we're here at modern summit. But focusing on the EVM, it's like customizing your car. Pipping out the chassis and stuff and then leaving a shitty engine in there.
00:09:27.808 - 00:09:52.252, Speaker B: So what we're doing is bringing vm to every stack. We're announcing a big partnership with Polygon, one of the bigger role providers coming shortly this month, where you can use the Polygon CDK, use whatever da layer, and then launch with the moves and stack, roll up, use the move vm, and connect to a shared sequencer. So main value props are two fold. You have the vm, which is high through execution environment, and then you have the shared sequencer, which enables you to interrupt if you want to.
00:09:52.336 - 00:10:05.004, Speaker A: Yeah, let's come back to the shade sequencer. Cause I'm really curious about the interop stuff. But does it mean. I mean, maybe it's not live today, but could the Movm get plugged into op, stack, and orbit?
00:10:05.052 - 00:10:05.708, Speaker B: That is the goal.
00:10:05.804 - 00:10:35.060, Speaker A: That's the goal. Okay, so it's like not there yet, but the goal is in my list of options of picking my l two. I can pick my vm, so I can pick movie powered by, or evmvm powered by you guys. I then pick my, like, settlement framework. So opstack, polygon, CDK, orbit, and I pick my da later separately. And then I hit deploy, and there's my l two.
00:10:35.100 - 00:10:37.436, Speaker B: Exactly. High throughput l two on ethereum customized.
00:10:37.548 - 00:10:50.816, Speaker A: Okay, very cool. All right, so let's get into the shared sequencer bit, and like, tell me about. Yeah, the move shared sequencer. What differentiates it? Why? Yeah, show me on it.
00:10:50.888 - 00:11:20.356, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think there's 50 evm, l two s. We're entering this era where there's like hundreds of infrastructure projects. Some big questions. Interop, obviously, you guys are working on across, and I actually used across my favorite bridge and one of how I bridge between l two s. But it's still difficult doing that, right? If you're a bridge, you're probably reading like, client state for multiple l two s. It'd be a lot easier if you can read this from one state from a shared sequencer or a few nodes that shares stay across multiple rollups. Every l two is kind of playing in game tier, like the super chains.
00:11:20.356 - 00:11:40.372, Speaker B: This thesis of connecting a bunch of chains with one shared sequencer. Orbit wants to do this, Zksync wants to do this. I was talking to Harry the other day, and Arbitrum is probably going to work with espresso some capacity and bring orbit chains to espresso. So I think the future is heading there. But like we touched on, it's not there today. And it probably won't be there tomorrow. The truth is, for EVMl two is like arbitrum.
00:11:40.372 - 00:12:25.682, Speaker B: They're printing a share to the money on centralized sequencers, so why would they give up their business model? So my two main cases for shared sequencers are interoperative. If you can have seamless and more secure bridging between different roll ups is very important. And then B most l two tokens and meme coins are all just governance tokens that don't have any value accrual. That's why they aren't the most strongest of tokens as well, where l one tokens have staking and have more dynamic mevs and all these cool business models that come around it. So when you have a decentralized sequencer, you can actually enable staking for the token. So if I'm a validator or running a node operator, I can stake the move token, participate in sequencing for the L2, but also get emissions for that. So I get emissions for staking, I'll get fee rewards for the L2, I'll get fee rewards for other L2 of the network.
00:12:25.682 - 00:12:49.122, Speaker B: That's actually profitable mavs that can pop up between the shared sequencer. So a whole new world of exploration. Your pushback will be like, okay, it's not as performance, you're gonna lose a lot of latency from that. And I agree. For example, if you're gaming l two, you should not use a shared sequencer. You stay the centralized sequencer, you can be part of the network and we'll support you. But if you're an order book roll up, you will tap into it because you want liquidity.
00:12:49.122 - 00:13:02.922, Speaker B: So I think it's a use case by use case. If you don't want to sacrifice performance latency, stay a centralized sequencer, do what you got to do. But if you don't really care about that, if your yield aggregate, for example, you don't really care about the 0.1 millisecond latency, if that exists.
00:13:03.106 - 00:13:32.168, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean this is interesting. This isn't like there's a long conversation we can have after this, and I think we've got about two minutes left. But I like how you argued both sides there. I do think, like I look at native interop, if a shared sequencer brings you a form of native interop between some chains too, I still think you have this other problem where you'll have like pockets of native interop, you'll have like these five chains talk to each other and these ten chains talk to each other, and then these, and it's still not particularly connected.
00:13:32.344 - 00:13:34.312, Speaker B: So I have this broader thesis that.
00:13:34.336 - 00:13:58.788, Speaker A: We can develop like layer of abstraction based around cross chain intents that can kind of work better when there is native interop between chains, but still works well between chains. That's the thesis I'm pushing for. But this is your podcast, not mine, so. Okay, cool. So where's the status of the shared sequencer that movement labs is building?
00:13:58.884 - 00:14:20.840, Speaker B: It's still a prototype, I would say. I don't think anyone's got to production ready for shared sequencers yet. It's still a very much wishy washy thing, and we'll fully admit that it's a very R and D effort. We're launching a centralized sequence, but it's a priority. We want to be on a decentralized sequencer within the first few months of Mainnet and working towards getting there.
00:14:20.920 - 00:14:27.992, Speaker A: Is there a reason why you guys want to build your own shared sequencer versus using espresso or other things?
00:14:28.056 - 00:15:07.030, Speaker B: Ultimately, every major L2 will build their own shared sequencer because you want to be able to. A, you want to pocket all the token economic values, and b, right now I don't believe there's any way to do dual staking, because the biggest issue between roll ups is state finality guarantees. So if you roll up a, if you arbitrarily optimism to guarantee state finality, you either have to use ZK state proofs, which is nowhere near ready, or b, you have to have crypto economic guarantees so that if I'm lying about state, I get slashed. That's only possible in a mechanism, which is what we're working on, where it's essentially an AV's, where if I'm arbitrum, I put ARB is collateral. You're optimizing. Put op is collateral. If you're lying about a state, you're op slashed.
00:15:07.030 - 00:15:18.942, Speaker B: And that kind of mechanism hasn't been built by any shared sequence. Right now, I'm sure they're thinking about it, but pretty much the pushback from any centralized sequencer companies that state finale guarantees aren't there. And that's something that we're heavily focusing on.
00:15:19.046 - 00:15:29.422, Speaker A: Yeah, we're going to have to do like a more technical deep dive podcast on this, too, but that's really cool. Okay, we got to wrap it up. Where can people find out more about movement and what you're doing at Richie.
00:15:29.446 - 00:15:33.190, Speaker B: Moncha on Twitter and thenovenlabs xyz on Twitter as well?
00:15:33.270 - 00:15:35.150, Speaker A: Awesome, man. Thank you so much for this.
00:15:35.230 - 00:15:35.782, Speaker B: Thanks so much.
00:15:35.846 - 00:15:36.638, Speaker A: Yeah, talk soon.
00:15:36.694 - 00:15:37.030, Speaker B: Appreciate it.
