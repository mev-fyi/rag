00:00:00.330 - 00:00:00.880, Speaker A: You.
00:00:02.290 - 00:00:17.418, Speaker B: All right. Hello, friends. I think we're supposed to be four people, but we're currently three people. So in the middle of the panel, it's going to be interrupted by someone rushing to the front and sitting down and joining the conversation.
00:00:17.514 - 00:00:20.158, Speaker A: We could also view it as my alt, actually.
00:00:20.244 - 00:01:00.080, Speaker B: Is my alt the proof we're finally being revealed? So this is the panel on MAV on modular. I think we're going to try and split this up very plainly into three sections or questions that the panelists are going to kind of hopefully run wild with and they're related to sort of security on modular, then incentives and finally, winners and losers in the preventative game of mev. So before we get started, maybe we could do some I mean, the reason I'm excited to sort of host this panel is because actually all three of you wrote the paper on crosschain MV, right?
00:01:00.690 - 00:01:04.240, Speaker A: I think not, Guillermo. Two out of three.
00:01:04.690 - 00:01:16.146, Speaker B: So the people who literally are writing the book are sort of present so we can get their perspective, but maybe they have more profound sort of personal details that are relevant that they want to introduce themselves very briefly.
00:01:16.338 - 00:01:27.398, Speaker A: Yeah. I'm Tarun, founder of Gauntlet, but also written a lot of papers on both Mev and AMM. Hello.
00:01:27.484 - 00:01:28.450, Speaker C: It works. It works.
00:01:28.540 - 00:01:29.180, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:01:30.270 - 00:01:50.400, Speaker C: Oh, I'm Alex, researcher at Flashbots. Wrote a paper with Tarun as a co author on cross domain Mev and did some research on mev on different yeah, before cross domain mev, I was looking at proof of stake and mev on proof of stake chains and on ethereum in particular.
00:01:52.770 - 00:02:37.040, Speaker B: Cool. Well, so what we wanted to do to start the panel, even though we're kind of midway through the day, is start out with sort of some definitions of modular just so we all use the same words when we mean the same thing or mean the same thing when we use the same words. I think that'd be helpful. And we want to sort of do that in the context of security. So we could start with the worst case of mev is these sort of long range, time banded attacks that are sort of hopefully prevented by some kind of economic security. So maybe we could start there with asking, what is the model? What does a modular blockchain do? How is it secured? What are the assumptions? And what does that have to do with the overall stability of the system?
00:02:39.490 - 00:03:15.994, Speaker A: I think the best way to think about modularity is sort of the classical computing analogy of you have many different computers, they have different resource access, so they have different compute and different sort of state that they're executing. And they have some method for communication. That method for communication might be some type of message passing system. It may end up being some type of deferred computation system. But effectively they have a way of communicating, yet operating somewhat independently while synchronizing anything I miss because you wrote the definition for domain in that paper.
00:03:16.112 - 00:03:31.966, Speaker C: Yeah. No, I think that sounds good. I saw there was a talk earlier by Mustafa and I think you were defining what a modular blockchain is in your context. So I don't know. There's like multiple definitions floating around and I'm not entirely sure which one we.
00:03:31.988 - 00:03:33.822, Speaker B: Should let's use the simplest one.
00:03:33.956 - 00:03:58.326, Speaker C: Well, I mean, the simplest one is what Turin mentioned. I think it's kind of like the architectural one. But then in practice, I think you have different applications I mean, different approaches to where you want modularity on your chain. And so there's, like, some approaches that have been stated, I think, earlier today. Then there are other approaches as well. I think what Tarun is referring to, to some extent is the modularity. Even in parallel computing, right.
00:03:58.326 - 00:04:05.190, Speaker C: Where you have multiple threads. To some extent, there's modularity there and how you manage communication between these threads.
00:04:05.350 - 00:04:44.246, Speaker B: Sure. I think if we had slides and we don't there'd be like some kind of diagram and there'd be the layer. Actually, the last presentation from the guy from ZK snarks had this photo where you have, like, there's a transaction and someone executes it and then someone agrees on the order. And they're not in the modular architecture. They're not necessarily the same people. Which, of course, you could start to envision how there'd be sort of a different as soon as there's communication, as soon as there's asynchronous as soon as there's layers. And two things that's kind of where Mev lives, sort of at the intersection of varying security models at these layers, you could say.
00:04:44.246 - 00:05:17.090, Speaker B: So talking about security, now we have an idea if we were on Bitcoin and hopefully no one's using that anymore you'd have some notion of how expensive it would be to rewrite the network and it would get more expensive. Do those security assumptions hold true in the marginal architecture? Does the marginal architecture, first of all, say anything about that? Is it indifferent to sort of proof of work, proof of stake or whatever? Or does it really imply certain new security assumptions?
00:05:18.950 - 00:06:37.574, Speaker A: I guess each unit has its own local security assumptions, but then there's sort of some synchronization guarantees that are held between the different units. And maybe it's because I'm older in this space, but I think of everything in terms of, like, old school parallel compute. And when you write kind of like multithreaded code or you write multiprocessing code, you oftentimes will have this sort of notion of independent units that have some amount of minimum shared state and they're only allowed to kind of communicate through that channel. And one of them could flood that channel and then halt execution somewhere else because it kind of DDoS the other chain or other process. You kind of have the same issues here where effectively you need to ensure that the communication channel is sort of resistant to some extent to being DDoS, that it's expressive enough that it can actually send all the messages that are needed to be concisely. Communicating between the two chains or two processes between in any pair of communication you have three security kind of models. You have one for each of the two sides, the two processes.
00:06:37.574 - 00:06:57.250, Speaker A: And then you have one for sort of the synchronization mechanism and one of the biggest if you look at something like the wormhole attack, these kind of mint bugs come from the fact that the two sides may not agree on the security model for the communication layer. And that's usually what's exploited.
00:06:57.910 - 00:07:50.290, Speaker B: But you could say that in some ways the offering of a project like Celestia or one instance of this modular architecture is to kind of share security so that there are sort of like something that some component that does the data availability and then state machines and executions are kind of separate from that. And there's this idea that maybe if security is cheaper, you could do more things, you could push innovation to other layers. So in this modular stack you could have one layer that is maybe super secure but not very useful in general sense and then other stuff that is much more useful and doesn't have to worry about security. But from an mev perspective you could imagine that at some point someone has to decide on the order. And that's the bit that I would imagine you would want to be, let's say the most secure.
00:07:51.110 - 00:08:48.900, Speaker A: Yeah. So if we actually think a little bit back to Linux's development it took almost ten years for Linux to actually have reasonable SMP which is like its multicore multi processing unit so that when you write some piece of code. The Linux scheduler could decide how to sort of shard the memory for each process and allocate the processes to each CPU, manage the page tables, all of that stuff. And the reason it took ten years it's actually really hard to get this communication part right and this is without people having economic incentive to DDoS your CPU. It's actually that the scheduling algorithm is actually really hard to write because you need some notion of shared state and common state to all these processes. Which is where I think something like celestial becomes useful, is actually having that initial kind of agreement on sort of data before you start trying to do these kind of like mutexes lockless queues, things like that.
00:08:49.350 - 00:09:27.758, Speaker B: This is completely off topic, but interesting to me, so I'm going to say it in FreeBSD. Are you familiar with what happened in FreeBSD? So there used to be this FreeBSD and then it became Dragonfly BSD because they had different models or different models of parallelization that was sort of sufficiently different to sort of warrant the project sort of forking. Do you think that this is something or these kind of disagreements like is the intellectual space of modular blockchain sophisticated enough that there are sort of like multiple models. And how do you think those models will sort of maybe evolve in parallel, compete or eventually integrate?
00:09:27.934 - 00:10:34.920, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I think one important piece of interoperability between all Unix like systems and POSTIX like systems is that their file systems are very similar, right? You can basically install any formatting on any of those devices versus the Windows version where you effectively had to do all this emulation and it took forever for Linux to actually be able to read Windows formatted devices. But I think the second thing is that the memory models, while different, have some notion of translation and you can get some sort of bitwise identical behavior on both sides. And that's the key thing, right? You want bitwise identical execution and bitwise identical sort of storage and agreement on that. And as long as you have that as a standard, then you can get a lot further than, say, what ended up happening in Windows where parallel compute never was able to take off. And to some extent I would argue that Windows missed I mean, there's many reasons Microsoft missed the cloud computing world, but one of them is this it was extremely hard to actually interoperate with these.
00:10:35.690 - 00:11:07.650, Speaker B: And sort of alex, from your understanding and research, I guess on the Ethereum space, which is, let's say, more diverse, it's a pretty big ecosystem. Many examples of this modulus like split, there's many L two S in Ethereum. They're already sort of competing, I would say, in a way. What's your sense? Which one is best for me and why?
00:11:07.720 - 00:11:08.978, Speaker C: Which one is best for me?
00:11:09.064 - 00:11:09.554, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:11:09.672 - 00:11:13.502, Speaker A: Which party for Bain Capital?
00:11:13.566 - 00:11:14.690, Speaker B: For Bane Capital?
00:11:15.910 - 00:12:19.362, Speaker C: No, but I was going to bring it back to what Turun was talking about. If we bring it back to the space today, I think Tarun is kind of talking about standards to some extent as well for communication, for interoperability, to some extent. I think we kind of need that for security. I think if you have completely different security models, I think it's much easier to so let's take two different worlds. One where you have one big blockchain, right, where if like a homogeneous security model, where you have security model can be understand holistically, understood holistically and then say you have like a patchwork of chains that have different security models, different however you want to define your security model, et cetera. Intuitively it feels like the patchwork of chains is easier to attack because you can attack like smaller units of it, grow in strengths and then being able to attack more, whereas the first one, I think, is harder to attack, maybe upfront, but if you find a flaw, the whole system can fall. And I think currently we have these patchworks of different chains and different models.
00:12:19.362 - 00:12:50.862, Speaker C: Even in the modularity approaches, there's like different modularity approaches, but also in where the security assumptions lie. Same thing for the bridges, whatever. This is all over the place right now and I think it makes it much easier to attack to a sophisticated attacker that wants to attack the overall system. So what a thing. And also for usefulness of the system, if there's some standard that's agreed upon that people can coordinate against, it can be a very simple tool, but something that people can coordinate with cross domain.
00:12:50.926 - 00:12:57.250, Speaker B: But there are sort of like concrete examples. Like, I know that polkadot has xcmp. Cosmos has IBC.
00:12:57.330 - 00:13:09.430, Speaker C: Right? There's a few, I agree, but I think maybe we need that that's more universal or more general. I think IBC is hard to integrate in some chains, as far as I know.
00:13:09.580 - 00:13:14.170, Speaker B: As hard as integrating a like, client. Yeah, non trivial.
00:13:14.990 - 00:14:05.242, Speaker C: So maybe that's the thing related to mev, right? The more you modularize, the more your stack is complex, the more there's like new attack vectors that emerge and the more there's complexity in being able to reason about the economic security of that stack. I think that's important. In the case of modularity, where you use something like Celestia as your data availability layer, there's also the security budget you need is kind of dynamic, right? So the more domains you add on top that use Celestia for data availability, maybe you have to think about how that affects the security of that layer. So I think it's also dynamic in that sense. And to me, trying to reason through this, the more simple that is in how we reason about the security of these different domains and how we compose the security together, the more often we can build like a strong resilient system.
00:14:05.376 - 00:14:55.500, Speaker B: But what are the sort of like to switch topics now onto sort of incentives like as an L two creator or a roll up if you were just launching, I don't know, Sushi swap clone as a roll up beyond the incentives of the settlement layer being sort of secure. You wrote a little bit about how there is this competition from fees to move between the base layer and the sort of roll up or the application or higher up the stack. So how maybe you could elaborate a little bit like how do you see value accrual sort of evolving with potentially deeper stacks, L3s, S and so on. And what impact do you think that will have on sort of stability? Like not just having something secure at one point, but sort of long term security, predictable security.
00:14:56.110 - 00:15:35.650, Speaker C: So maybe two answers and I'll pass it to Tarun as well. One, in terms of value accrual, from a perspective of designing the system, you want value to be where you need security, right? So like value related to security budget. So I think there's some relation there of where value could accrue. And then the second thing is owning order flow and owning where the customers are. I think to some extent there's like value there because you own the touch point that creates economic activity. These are like two ways to look at it. So to some extent the order flow part is like whoever runs the UI that users interface with because then they can redirect your transaction to some other stack very easily.
00:15:35.650 - 00:15:57.882, Speaker C: But at the same time, a stack that isn't secure won't be used for long. And so you need that stack to be secured properly, whatever that means in terms of value that has to back it, how much has to be staked on it, how much does it cost to attack it relative to the economic value that's on top of it? Is there an incentive to attack it because you make more money by the value that you secure on top of it, et cetera.
00:15:57.946 - 00:16:32.346, Speaker B: But there's also cases when the protocols are incentivized to sort of be attacked. In the sense if you're a Dex or whatever and you're trying to bootstrap, you're trying to get liquidity, you want to pay the liquidity provider as much as possible. If someone is sandwiching or adding more value, like people are sandwiching the attack and consuming the spread. Technically that money is going from users to LPs, right? So there is this incentive play where it isn't always clear and it probably changed over time like hey, there he.
00:16:32.368 - 00:16:35.226, Speaker C: Is, you need to have a little.
00:16:35.248 - 00:16:36.858, Speaker B: More of a rocky run.
00:16:37.024 - 00:16:40.700, Speaker D: I was expecting music while I was coming in but it clearly doesn't work out what happened.
00:16:42.030 - 00:16:44.414, Speaker B: Sorry. Very nice to meet you.
00:16:44.532 - 00:16:47.194, Speaker D: Sorry, yeah, I guess I'm just a paid actor.
00:16:47.242 - 00:16:47.840, Speaker B: Actually.
00:16:49.650 - 00:16:53.934, Speaker D: I'm in stand in really so it's great. Anyway, sorry no, but we were talking.
00:16:53.972 - 00:17:00.306, Speaker B: About incentives but I think I interrupted terrorist if you wanted to speak sort of about the incentive question.
00:17:00.488 - 00:18:09.234, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean one very high level view of sort of the game theory difference between single chain mev and multi chain mev and obviously it's a stylized simplified version of this is that in a single chain mev is really a congestion game. There's just like a fixed number of opportunities. There's a bunch of people who are all competing to basically capitalize on those opportunities and auctions can be designed to be like a reasonable way of dealing with congestion in most economic situations. However, in the MultiChain world it actually really becomes like a routing problem, right, of like how do I go between these different chains and maximize my value? And the routing problem is actually a much larger sort of state space of possible ways that things can go wrong. Which means you need to coordinate the incentives along the whole chain. So let's suppose I have a sandwich attack that's a sequence of sandwich attacks across bridges that on each side use an AMM. Well then I actually need to make sure all the LP to your point earlier, I need to make sure that all the LPs kind of end up having similar incentives.
00:18:09.234 - 00:18:17.626, Speaker A: But there's not really a great way of guaranteeing that in a sort of multi chain world, right, you actually would have to synchronize those constantly across all.
00:18:17.648 - 00:18:42.930, Speaker B: Of these or just take the risk or be atomic. And then you say, oh, I assume that I'm using Flashbots and that I'd zero risk. But if you're like, again, bank capital or someone with serious money or a market maker, oh, sorry, you're here, I forgot. You'll just execute the trade. Your short term prediction model will say whatever is going to happen and you'll do it and you're going to be right enough times to be bank capital.
00:18:43.430 - 00:18:58.070, Speaker D: So here's a fun little alpha leak, actually. So here you have a model that's probabilistic. Yeah, turns out that problem is convex too. So actually you can solve it. But anyway, sorry, I didn't mean to detract. Maybe that's too much of an alpha leak.
00:18:59.530 - 00:19:16.814, Speaker A: But I guess the point is you have to coordinate these incentives a lot more. Right. And right now we don't have the fact that Flash bots can be isolated from the incentives that people are using to bootstrap pools is not really possible. When you think about it in terms.
00:19:16.852 - 00:19:27.490, Speaker B: Of modularity, is that to somehow suggest that smaller players are going to have a harder time in this fragmented liquidity world?
00:19:27.560 - 00:19:32.100, Speaker C: Absolutely. You need more capital to be able to do this, right?
00:19:32.710 - 00:20:26.690, Speaker B: Yeah, it's kind of rough because I was talking with Zachie about this and it's like, oh, when you have a million Evmos based chains or whatever, maybe not a million, like, let's say a thousand. And we were trying to ask this question like, oh, will it actually be possible to do these kind of things? And it's like, do you think Jump Capital would have any problem putting a million dollars in a thousand plays? I don't think so. I think that most market makers are big enough to make the spread, to take the inventory risk and sit there and get the juiciest part when it arrives. So if someone is writing this complicated model and even if they say everything is connected over IBC and you actually can, there is sort of some kind of secure transmission between these things. It's not like an exchange where they can stop withdrawals or something. It's like an automated permissionless interrupt thing. Even if the people who are trying to move liquidity around are always going to have a harder time than someone who just keeps liquidity everywhere.
00:20:27.510 - 00:20:59.082, Speaker A: I mean, I guess this gets to Alex's point about who owns the order flow owns a lot more than you think. And the question is, in this multi chain world, will the order flow actually be owned by an aggregator or will it be multiple, kind of like separate front ends that end up fragmenting the order? And then right now it looks like the latter, right? No one's actually built a very good cross chain aggregator and part of the reason is that the front ends don't want to take the inventory risk. Right. Like the market makers do. But the market makers also don't make products. So they're not like getting user flow.
00:20:59.146 - 00:21:01.520, Speaker B: But it could be just because it's just not worth it yet.
00:21:02.210 - 00:21:17.810, Speaker C: The markets might be too, or I don't know. There's some bridges that are backed by market makers. Wormhole being notable, for sure. We get a sense of the size of their ambition. That by the fact that there was a hack and the next day they paid 350,000,000 back to the bridge.
00:21:17.890 - 00:21:24.360, Speaker A: But they also raised that again right after let's not forget that it did get covered in a fair enough.
00:21:25.130 - 00:21:30.262, Speaker C: I think the order flow cross chain is at the bridge level, in my opinion.
00:21:30.406 - 00:21:54.810, Speaker A: I think when Jump started Wormhole, there was kind of this sense amongst people that this was their version of the Microwave Tower. And you want to win the New York Chicago Microwave Tower. There's a really horrible movie that if you want to watch on the history of this called The Hummingbird Project, worst acting I've ever seen because it's a movie about HFT. So it can't be good, honestly.
00:21:54.890 - 00:21:56.654, Speaker B: Just the eisenberg, isn't it? Yeah.
00:21:56.692 - 00:22:00.318, Speaker A: Yes, exactly. And still horrible movie.
00:22:00.494 - 00:22:01.186, Speaker B: I liked it.
00:22:01.208 - 00:22:02.020, Speaker D: I don't know.
00:22:03.510 - 00:22:28.250, Speaker A: But it is factually accurate that the effective war we see with the bridges now in the normal world converged to one thing. But here it actually seems like it's not going to be true. Right. It really does feel like there's going to be quality of service versus bridge security trade offs, and you're going to have the spectrum of that and then people are going to allocate to that and that'll have a totally different microstructure than normal markets.
00:22:30.750 - 00:23:13.994, Speaker B: Yes, I think that makes a lot of sense. But even in a permissionless system, like some people use bridges, but not everyone needs to. And I guess the question is when is it eventually going to or will it happen that the bridges will sort of like if you wanted atomicity across a bridge, you just have to be you're. If you're validating, who's to say that you can't operate on multiple networks simultaneously? But as an infrastructure provider, I guess I'll talk from the Cosmos case because that's what I'm most familiar with. A lot of validators operate on multiple networks. There's no reason if the blocks are like the leader election, the person proposed the block is predictable. If you could predict the time on both networks, right.
00:23:13.994 - 00:23:34.970, Speaker B: Then you could actually do a risk free cross chain thing and go around the whole bridge dilemma. So how do we think about sort of the incentives for not just jump, but even hopefully smaller validators, smaller operations to start doing multi chain operations to sort of benefit from simultaneous order flow?
00:23:35.130 - 00:24:01.610, Speaker C: One thing there that's part of the paper, the cross domain mev paper. Right. So we talk about that to happen. But then we talk about the fact that if, say, you're a leader on chain A, I mean, I'm a leader on chain A, you're a leader on chain B and we want to collude or collaborate however you want to frame it in order to get that economic atomicity across ourselves, we don't trust each other. So we need a way to trust each other. We also need a way to communicate. Right.
00:24:01.610 - 00:24:55.130, Speaker C: I think you can model all of that as some additional economic cost that a player that is the leader on A and B at the same time doesn't have. I think you can maybe point to an incentive for someone to control both of these validator sets, for example. And that's what's problematic. Because maybe the pursuit for alpha is such that the system equilibrium doesn't go towards many smaller validator sets that actually have a way to collude with one another. trustlessly at minimal overhead, but rather a very large player that starts owning more and more of the validator sets on many sites so that they get these leader election slots and they can reduce the overhead of communication. There's still some communication, but it's internal communication. And you don't have that trust cost as well, because you can trust your internal systems to work to some extent.
00:24:55.130 - 00:25:07.950, Speaker C: And so you can lower the cost to do some interactions and you can maybe even seize pockets of opportunities that for us who don't trust each other, the cost of coordinating for that opportunity would be too high.
00:25:08.020 - 00:25:09.278, Speaker B: Well, you could put an auction between it.
00:25:09.284 - 00:25:09.406, Speaker C: Right.
00:25:09.428 - 00:25:11.262, Speaker B: I think that's what you're sort of alluding to.
00:25:11.396 - 00:25:47.514, Speaker A: Yeah, I just think the lack of Adamicity actually changes the outcomes of these auctions. Right. So you sort of have to have an auction where you coordinate. Even in the simplest case of like I have two first price auctions on both sides and I go across the bridge, I actually have to coordinate that the reserve price and the floor price and stuff like that. The initial setup is the same across both places and there is a cost to that. Eventually you still have to pay some amount of money to synchronize those things and that might go to zero over time.
00:25:47.552 - 00:25:51.642, Speaker C: Though ideally it does. I think ideally we want it to, or at least not zero.
00:25:51.696 - 00:25:58.174, Speaker A: But I think ZK stuff will be the only way to get to the point that that cost gets arbitrarily small.
00:25:58.212 - 00:26:01.642, Speaker C: In the long run because it lowers the communication complexity.
00:26:01.706 - 00:26:02.640, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly.
00:26:03.890 - 00:26:06.900, Speaker C: But you would still have like a back and forth to some extent. Right.
00:26:08.390 - 00:26:19.666, Speaker A: The question is I only have to send you one packet and you can verify that it's correct at the same time that it's like I did the computation correctly on the other side, so I don't have to do any interaction.
00:26:19.858 - 00:26:32.862, Speaker C: In that sense, it's good question for you both. Right? What if say we go back to that same example, right. And we send each other the packets, but now we need to split the profits. How do we split the profits?
00:26:32.946 - 00:26:38.154, Speaker A: I mean, that you can have the contract on both sides, right? You store the final profit on one side.
00:26:38.192 - 00:26:40.454, Speaker C: Right? Right. It's always on one side. It can't be on both sides.
00:26:40.502 - 00:26:42.346, Speaker A: Contract that's doing that you could also.
00:26:42.368 - 00:26:47.200, Speaker D: Do like I mean, the question I don't know if the question you're getting at is like, how much profit do you split? Yes.
00:26:47.810 - 00:26:49.722, Speaker C: How do you start the optimal profit split?
00:26:49.786 - 00:26:50.014, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:26:50.052 - 00:27:09.794, Speaker D: So this is actually a well studied problem in game theory, which is called the cake cutting problem. The pie cutting problem depends on who you ask and what your aesthetics are. So there is like a weird set of equilibrium that you can talk about here. And often they're actually quite stable too. So it is surprising, depending on who the first person is, who's taking some of the risk.
00:27:09.842 - 00:27:32.910, Speaker C: Okay, how do we think about adversarial things where, say we're splitting and we agree on 50 50, but maybe there's someone else who's willing to do 60 40? Or maybe over time in an Iterated game, instead of this particular opportunity, it starts making more sense for me to own more of the network rather than split with him. Right. Because then it's like 1000 instead of 50 50.
00:27:33.060 - 00:27:57.762, Speaker A: I mean, this is why proof of stake networks that draw the entire validator set over an epoch before the epoch where you know, the blocks you can't avoid this problem, right? Because you already see this in Salana and Avalanche, right, where people are basically just paying validators ahead of their block number and co locating. Yeah, I mean, even Dex are people are just basically paying.
00:27:57.816 - 00:28:03.890, Speaker C: Do we need to avoid any kind of leader election that's in the future? Do we need like proof of work? Like leader election?
00:28:03.970 - 00:28:17.738, Speaker A: Yeah. And that's a ZK thing, right? The single secret leader election kind of type of stuff is only enabled by homomorphic encryption and ZK stuff. So I think this cost goes down if cryptography gets better. It's not a purely economic did you.
00:28:17.744 - 00:28:22.358, Speaker C: Use the algorithm leader election model that's like VRF based or something with a committee?
00:28:22.454 - 00:28:26.298, Speaker A: I mean, there's still these poison committee attacks that are known.
00:28:26.394 - 00:28:27.918, Speaker D: You also often grind too.
00:28:28.004 - 00:28:44.340, Speaker B: Sorry to cut you guys off. Do you guys want to take one question from the crowd before we get off? Super interesting conversation. I just want to open it up a little bit to, if anyone's been waiting, has a question. I don't know how this works, but just point to the person and then Mike goes.
00:28:46.170 - 00:28:51.078, Speaker E: Yeah, guys, we have lunch. One so this will probably be one of the last questions.
00:28:51.164 - 00:28:55.240, Speaker B: Where was the person there? There you go.
00:28:58.670 - 00:30:00.874, Speaker E: This is a question for Alex about Flashbots architecture and how you see it changing in context of multilayers and modular blockchains. So like Flashbots right now and the way it's designed is very practically helping democratize mev on Ethereum with enabling many searchers to participate and miners. But in context of what you guys were talking about with people with the most capital being able to get mev on cross chain worlds and multilayers and modular blockchains, how is Flashbots intending to change its architecture to help further democratize mev? And yeah, in context of obviously you guys are also trying to become censorship resistant and decentralized. So you seem to have a lot of competing priorities, but I think this is a big one coming up. So curious to know.
00:30:00.992 - 00:30:41.106, Speaker C: Yeah, great question. We think a lot about the risk that I mentioned earlier. This centralization of Validator sets across many domains and how this kind of world can be attacked. We also see it as like it's inevitable that the world, at least for the next few years is going to be like MultiChain or whatever. Even if you focus only on Ethereum, you have many layer twos that have raised like hundreds of millions are going to be able to subsidize activity for a while, even if it's artificial. And so we need to prepare for that asynchronous world. And what that means there, I don't know if looking at it as simply as like, oh, players need more capital to participate makes sense because even today on Ethereum there are Flash loans.
00:30:41.106 - 00:31:29.322, Speaker C: But if you use flashballs today, flash loans are not gas efficient compared to having the capital directly. So a lot of players need the capital to be able to execute a lot of opportunities. But those that change massively in the cross domain world, I think what changes is maybe like the inventory management logic that you need to have and also the maybe economies of scale that if you have more capital, you can warehouse risk a lot better and so you can maybe take more opportunities or take more risks. So we think a lot about that. We think a lot about this dystopian future of very centralized blockchain world in general where you have a few Validators that run Validators on 100 different chains and run bridges where they provide liquidity to users. That's like the worst thing for us. And we need to adapt for what I just mentioned.
00:31:29.322 - 00:32:03.250, Speaker C: Now we're going to announce more on this relatively soon. So you'll have extra details there. But we're worried about the same thing that we were worried about when we started Flashbaults a year and a half ago, which is we want to keep the system decentralized. We want to keep it transparent as much as possible because the more you have opacity, the more it's difficult to understand what happens within it. What else do we want to keep it? We want to keep it accessible to most individuals.
00:32:06.090 - 00:33:09.254, Speaker A: I guess I'll add one point on the fairness aspect, which is that even though these bridges that have synthetic assets tend to be the ones that get exploited first synthetic assets. And like Staking derivatives, especially in proof of stake networks, do actually lower the cost of capital for the actual validator. Because validators basically smaller validators can lever up around opportunities that they want to kind of subsidize. And so R1 question is going to be how do we balance this centralization effect versus should we allow more kind of derivative assets across bridges? And that's obviously going to be this big security question because wormhole is the greatest example of what happens when the staking derivative blows up. But it is clear that that actually does lower validator centralization in the long run. There's going to always be this kind of trade off between how much we want derivatives for equalizing access versus why.
00:33:09.292 - 00:33:10.422, Speaker C: Does it lower the cost?
00:33:10.556 - 00:33:29.998, Speaker A: Yeah. So let's say I'm a small validator and I have like 1% of stake I can borrow against my stake and basically, at least for a short amount of time get to say like three X leverage on my existing. Stake. And now I can go restake that, get 3%, increase my number of blocks and try to basically but surely if.
00:33:30.004 - 00:33:32.414, Speaker C: You own 50%, you can borrow three X leverage as well, right?
00:33:32.452 - 00:33:36.238, Speaker A: No. How do you borrow three times 50?
00:33:36.324 - 00:33:37.246, Speaker C: There's no liquidity for it.
00:33:37.268 - 00:33:54.790, Speaker A: There's no liquidity for it. There's this kind of liquidity versus security trade off that naturally comes up in stake negotiatives. So it's always going to end up being this war between how much do we want these kind of very hard to price derivatives that can blow up versus how much do we actually want centralization.
00:33:55.770 - 00:33:59.990, Speaker B: Cool. I think that's a great place to end it. Thank you very much, panel.
