00:00:01.840 - 00:00:02.690, Speaker A: Hello. Good morning.
00:00:03.670 - 00:00:08.690, Speaker B: Maybe we can start with a quick round of introductions and what you guys are working on, starting with Jana.
00:00:09.110 - 00:00:40.662, Speaker C: Good morning. My name is Jana. I work at the Rari foundation. So we work on behalf of Raridao, which is comprised of rarity token holders that get to vote on the future of rarible protocol, which is essentially the back end of ratable NFT marketplace. But it's also a protocol that powers community marketplaces, branding marketplaces, wallet integrations, data analytics and other use cases. And then we also recently launched our own chain, which is nl three on top of arbitrum one. It's called rari chain, and it embeds royalties on a node level.
00:00:40.662 - 00:00:51.770, Speaker C: So that's essentially the organization that I represent today, and my role is head of strategy. So I have a really fun position because I get to think of ideas and then make them happen.
00:00:53.440 - 00:01:16.060, Speaker D: Hey, folks, I'm Shane. I'm the founder of Stargaze. Stargaze is a sovereign blockchain for NFTs and more. It has an NFT launchpad and a marketplace and a bunch of other apps on it. It is the home of bad kids, if you guys have heard of that. And recently. Also Celestine slots was also minted on it.
00:01:17.520 - 00:01:49.780, Speaker A: Hi, guys, I'm Bernie, also known as headmaster Bernie. I'm the creator of Pixel Wizards, which is a collection on Stargaze, done really well so far. And yeah, I really tried to bring back fun to the NFTs themselves by making interactive animated svgs, which have been really fun so far. And I used a lot of creator tooling and always brings ideas towards either the Stargaze team or to some other places. Yeah, it's been fun so far.
00:01:49.940 - 00:02:19.690, Speaker B: Great. So both Shane and Yana, you guys are using blockchain, like the chain itself, as a foundational sort of primitive for tooling rather than adapt on a L2. And I'm seeing increasingly more projects moving towards having their own block space as the sort of underlying vehicle for creativity. And I'm curious to hear, I would bet you'd have different perspectives on this. So I'm curious to hear why you think the chain is the right level of abstraction rather than adapt on another layer, for example?
00:02:21.190 - 00:02:59.820, Speaker C: Well, for us, it was a bit of a reaction to what market was going through about a year ago. So last summer you saw opensea slashing royalties, and there was just like this whole movement that was already happening for a while. Right? Like you had the bull marketplace, which is all about trading, not necessarily about the creator. And I think it's like, mainly because the market was so bad. And then, you know, NFT marketplaces were trying to, like, incentivize trading, and then cutting the royalties was a way to make it cheaper to transact. But, you know, unfortunately, it was a creator, not, you know, the marketplace or anybody else that was, you know, then suffering this cut. And that just, like, didn't sit right with us.
00:02:59.820 - 00:03:44.360, Speaker C: And we're not rarible, we're a separate entity, right? Like, but the community is very similar. And where rarible is, has started from was always, you know, being on the side of the creator and allowing royalties and enforcing royalties. So it felt like the right kind of extension because the mission of our foundation is to be building decentralized NFT infrastructure. So we came with the idea of, like, what if we then create a blockchain where royalties are not a disputable element, right? Where if you have your NFT minted on that chain, then, like, it doesn't really matter what player will come into the ecosystem and will, you know, allow for transactions. They will just not be executed if you don't pay royalties. It's as simple as that. It's just a sequencer level enforcement.
00:03:44.360 - 00:04:32.702, Speaker C: So it was more of a, like, we want to be there and we want to be there for the creators, and we want to make sure that they have a place where they can feel respected for what they do, that they can feel safe and their earnings and the effort that they put into the strategies of making livelihood in web3 is actually respected. So that was the primarily reason why we launched our own chain. And then, of course, it's also good for the ecosystem. You can verticalize your offering. We have the protocol that's of course, integrated with the chain. So if you want to build your own NFT marketplace or do any kind of NFT application that has to do with indexing or transactions, you can just use that to jumpstart your development. But at the same time, rarible as a company then can be building custom marketplaces.
00:04:32.702 - 00:04:49.690, Speaker C: They've done it for, like, Mattel and they've done it for like, Animoca brands, and they do it for, like, different players in the web two and web3 space that can also then be built on top of the chain. On top of the protocol. Right. So you're just like, verticalizing your offering as well. Plus, like, it's a good home for creators.
00:04:52.270 - 00:05:45.590, Speaker D: Yeah. There's actually a lot of similar reasons why Stargaze kind of started in 2021. A lot of the entity volume was happening on OpenSea, and at that time, Ethereum was very congested. The gas fees were very high. So we wanted to kind of create a place where people can come and trade with very low gas, where creators didn't have to have to find a developer to try and launch a collection and all this kind of stuff. So we just wanted to create a simpler, kind of easier experience for them and also not put the burden on their fans to pay all these gas fees for trading and stuff like that. Another thing is that as an app chain, it can enforce royalties on chain.
00:05:45.590 - 00:05:55.550, Speaker D: So that's something that creators also liked, because soon after that, you saw royalties go to zero and a bunch of other marketplaces.
00:05:58.230 - 00:06:34.422, Speaker B: Cool. And maybe, Bernie, sort of from the, we heard, like, the infrastructure standpoint, I guess from a creator standpoint, there's a plethora of options for you and for anyone out to do things that weren't there, like four years ago or even two years ago. Like four years ago, if you wanted to create an NFT, you had to go to the opensea shared storefront and deploy it, just put an image up, add the title, and that was like the range of your optionality. Now you have 100 platforms across like 100 different chains, all with their own sort of perspective and viewpoint. What do you think is important for the creator? What would you value the most in terms of the options you have?
00:06:34.566 - 00:08:17.556, Speaker A: Yeah, I think for creators, it's really important to be in a good community where you feel welcome and where you feel like this is going to be the place where I can launch my collection because people like it. You got an affinity with the creators or the founders of the platform you're using on. And like, Opensea doesn't have that, which is basically just, you put it up there and hope it will do well, or you have to build your own very large community up front and then mint it, and then also the ease of use to. To minj your collection. Like, I do have technical background, so I could have worked my way through deploying contracts or doing things on CLI to deploy a collection. But at Stargaze, I mainly chose Stargaze because back then, two years ago, they had Stargaze studio already, which just allows you to upload your collection and then deploy it and have the minter and all the things ready at your disposal. So I think that's really nice to have a launchpad to have a way to communicate with your community, but also to have those enforced royalties, which basically are a source of income, but also as some sort of revenue stream that I put back into my collections, try to build more things around them so people can enjoy the NFT even more.
00:08:17.748 - 00:08:46.740, Speaker B: Great. So it sounds to me like aside from the technical affordances you get when you have bespoke block space, such as being able to enforce royalties in a level you can after the open sea blur wars, there's also this notion of a community being more sticky when it has its own sort of sovereign, I guess, block space that people are more likely to call less around, I guess. Is that right? Do you guys feel the same way that by having your own chain it's more likely to get something sticky, whereas in another layer things maybe pollute in a way where there's more noise under the signal?
00:08:49.080 - 00:09:24.560, Speaker D: Yeah, you can think of an app chain as a community computer. There are some people who use that term for app chains, and it's a place where you can be a bigger fish in a smaller pond. The community is a bit tighter because it's smaller in a place like Opensea, some of the marketplaces on Ethereum, it's just like, it's so easy to get lost in the noise and it's very hard for creators to kind of stand out and get featured. Right. So sometimes some of the smaller ecosystems are better.
00:09:24.900 - 00:09:54.758, Speaker C: Yeah, those are like the artists and also the apps. Right. And the partners of the ecosystem. It's just like, you can create like a curated experience and you can, like, it can be idea driven, it can be narrative driven. Right? Like, it can be like a place for a certain type of creator as well. Whereas to your point, those bigger players, it's a bit of a catch all. And then it kind of depends on your motivation of why you're a creator in the space and what you are trying to do with your nfts and your content.
00:09:54.758 - 00:10:06.090, Speaker C: So you just go and pick whatever fits you and your interest the best and also where you feel like you're getting the right kind of attention and the kind of representation.
00:10:07.080 - 00:10:10.032, Speaker B: Okay, yeah, I just want to say.
00:10:10.056 - 00:10:48.220, Speaker A: Like, I'm definitely agreeing on the point with the curation part. Like, it really helps as a creator to get the feeling that your collection can be the next blue chip or that it can be something more than just another collection. And like Stargaze, have their featured program, maybe rarible as a curated program as well, which really helps creators to go for the limits and, yeah, really express their art. I think that's an underrated feature, and there goes a lot of effort in it to do it right.
00:10:49.440 - 00:11:03.510, Speaker B: What does curation mean exactly for you guys, does it mean the sort of the ability and the skill to tastefully pick a range of things that people would like, or is it something more than that? I'm just curious to see how you define it. It's a very vague term in some ways.
00:11:03.890 - 00:11:48.184, Speaker C: So we went to market with a campaign called Ten Byrari, and it was a highly curated community, or like a collective of creators. But it wasn't all just cherry picked by us. They were actually selected by the community as well. So we worked with Hug, which is an online platform community where artists can submit their art and the community uploads them. And then we also worked with curators that specialize in web3, but they also have, like, arts background from their previous careers. And the brief was really having an eclectic group of creators. So that we are diverse, we represent, but we also showcase the breadth of creativity that can be done on chain.
00:11:48.184 - 00:12:27.150, Speaker C: So we don't necessarily think that bfbs are the future of nfts, right. When we are thinking about Rari chain, we also think about a chain that is filled with nfts that actually have value. So it's not necessarily just quick, let's mint 10,000 of iterations and then just establish some sort of floor price. There actually should be some sort of thought behind the piece and just making sure that it's not super transactional. So that was the thought behind the initial creation. We can't be creating the content on the chain, right? It's permissionless. Anybody can come, anybody can drop their collection.
00:12:27.150 - 00:12:52.820, Speaker C: We want to open the door to as many people as possible, of course. So it's more about just setting the tone. And then I feel like a lot of the creators will self select, right? So just like leading by example, essentially is decoration and the kind of creators and the kind of content that you choose to highlight and elevate.
00:12:54.080 - 00:13:59.136, Speaker D: So the interesting thing is that when you make creator tooling simpler and easier, curation becomes more important, because then you get to the point where just anyone can go and upload anything. So then you have this filtering problem, and just as Jana said, the blockchain is open and permissionless, and anyone can go and upload anything. But then you have to kind of curate on the website side of things, and if you don't, it's going to be a pretty ugly place. So at Stargaze, we basically have two levels of curation. We have a community vote where people stake their tokens and vote. And then there's also the team, there's like a little curation team that also exists. But in the future, we definitely want to open it up to other teams that want to self curate and host their own platforms as well.
00:13:59.288 - 00:14:46.730, Speaker B: Great. So over the last two years, we saw this very bizarre situation where the notion of an NFT went from a nerdy little niche sort of interest to people to being everywhere for a second, ended being nowhere for a year or so. The volumes are down. It used to be able to mint anything and everyone would buy it, and then with 20 x in a day, and obviously that's not sustainable. So that stopped happening. So now we're in a place where we're back, I think, to the roots in a way. We're trying to rediscover what's possible with these things, where the sustainability comes from, what kind of industry or sort of communities can we build around them? So I'd be curious to hear, because I think all of you have been through the trials of the bear and the sort of pics of the bull in a way.
00:14:46.730 - 00:15:20.210, Speaker B: And what have the learnings been from that insanity that happened, and how can we move forward in a way that feels much more? Because right now, the word NFT is like a slur for a lot of people outside of the space especially. I think there's good reasons for that. In some ways, I don't think we handled it very well for a while. So I'm just curious to hear how you approach the future with the awareness that things went a bit sideways in some respects. Sorry for putting the spot on that.
00:15:21.630 - 00:16:23.300, Speaker D: Well, the way things work in crypto, it seems that whenever something new comes out, there's this hype phase and then it dies down a little bit, but never still completely dies. I mean, NFTs are still doing crazy amounts of volume on bitcoin, Ethereum. Right, and other chains. I mean, hundreds of millions of dollars of volume. Right? So when people say NFTs are dead, like they're not, it's still a pretty good business, and artists are still making money and connecting with their fans and stuff like that. In terms of the terminology, I think the term NFT, to me seems it feels a lot like the word MP3, right, where it just eventually went away and just became a song, right. So no one talks about, hey, go listen to this MP3 on Spotify, right? It's just a song, right? So at some point in the future, all digital assets will be on chain, right? So it's just another piece of art or piece of asset.
00:16:23.300 - 00:16:32.420, Speaker D: Yeah, it's not. I think the term will eventually kind of blend or merge with something else and just become a piece of art at some point.
00:16:34.130 - 00:17:26.830, Speaker C: Yeah, it's funny, right? Because like we're using a description of technology as like the description or the label for the actual content and they're not the same. So if you think about NFT being the underlying technology behind like enabling us to have digital assets on blockchain, right. You can also think about nfts as just like that little simple mechanism that enables in game trading. It's also the mechanism that will enable real world assets attestations. The application already now is broader than what people associate with nfts based on where we were two years ago. So the more we can decouple NFT as a way of describing actual, for example, art on chain, I think the better, because it's just not apples to apples.
00:17:29.620 - 00:18:03.410, Speaker A: Yeah. So I think I agree with the point that the word NFT is used a lot, but it's nice to see from a creator's perspective that I'm always talking about my collections like they're the wizards or the witches or whatever, and I see these as the asset that it is. And yeah, it's just nice to follow along with the community and stuff like that.
00:18:05.150 - 00:18:53.360, Speaker B: So that sort of point of like the sort of content is expanding beyond just. It's not just like a thing that you buy. There can be other, any kind of digital ads can be that. So let's talk about wider thing. Are there any distribution mechanisms, which is to say ways of these things moving and transferring and being created and being sort of disposed of that you find interesting above and beyond? Just like someone puts something up for a price and people come and buy it. So what kind of like talking about sort of progressive methods of distribution, maybe free things, things that you only get if you've done something, things that are sort of more gamified in a way experience that are more performative rather than just like financial, explicitly financial, direct from the get go. Is this something that excites you guys and you're working on?
00:18:53.780 - 00:19:57.740, Speaker A: I think if you look at the recent launch of mad scientist on osmosis, they did it to stream swap, which was a new way of trying to find price discovery for the assets. Like they basically launched a lab token and you had to get ten lab to mint at least one mad scientist NFT. So I think it was a really nice way, and especially for the first time, to find price discovery for the mint price of your NFT. So I think that's, yeah, it's not exactly a gamified way, but it's more like a decentralized way of trying to find the right price, which eventually led to mad scientists being very high pee and. Yeah, continue onwards to be a great project. Yeah, I love to see more of these kind of things in the future.
00:19:58.840 - 00:20:48.090, Speaker D: In terms of distribution, I think the slots are a great example, right? A collection like that, and even bad kids, they're starting to get airdrops and stuff like that, right? There's Twitter spaces all the time. There's talk of launching lazy chain, slot chain and all this kind of stuff. NFT collections are just, well, PFPs especially are like crypto native groups. And we're still in the early days of exploring what the end game is there, but it's really good to have. The PFPs are really great for having an entire narrative, like having something they can rally around. So like, all the modular folks can rally around like the slots or something like that. Right.
00:20:48.090 - 00:21:00.330, Speaker D: And I think we'll start seeing that for kind of every, for lack of a better word, for like every narrative in kind of crypto, but then eventually beyond crypto as well.
00:21:00.710 - 00:22:05.118, Speaker C: Yeah, I think, like, you touched on the topic of community, right? Like, you can. I think there's a big value in belonging to a community through the culture that surrounds a particular collection or a particular artist. And when we are thinking about NFTs, a lot of the times, the discussion is also around value. Is there any value in holding this NFT? Does it provide me some sort of access? If you're part of a community with an artist, maybe that ownership of that NFT does give you a whitelist for a future drop. Or maybe it does, you know, provide you with like some sort of special perk or special content at some point, you know, throughout your participation in the community, we just, you know, we were sponsoring the Shifi summit on Sunday, one day before FCC kicked off, and we provided the community with a mint of an NFT, which actually, then the holder of that NFT is entitled to a discount if they want to enroll into the next cohort of shifi. Right. Some sort of, like, perk that comes from ownership.
00:22:05.118 - 00:22:14.410, Speaker C: I think it's also something that people are looking at and artists have actually, like, the really savvy ones have actually been working with for quite some time.
00:22:16.070 - 00:23:07.172, Speaker B: Shane mentioned sort of the notion of NFTs as cultural currency for crypto native communities. I'm curious to hear what you think about. I think there's like, two different approaches to the future of this, and I've seen them people change their minds about which one's best, and it tends to follow the general narratives of the market. One of them is, you know, let's try to go out there and get normal people to, you know, use these things in a way that makes sense for them, whatever they want to do. So there was like a bunch of approaches towards, like, getting, you know, Starbucks onboarded or Spotify selling and things that, you know, of songs there that didn't work out so well. Maybe it will. Maybe sort of trying to find out what people care about outside of crypto and trying to see if the technology can somehow augment the demand or the problems for that.
00:23:07.172 - 00:23:33.610, Speaker B: That could be one route to growing the ecosystem. The other one is kind of doubling down and saying, we don't really care about that right now. Let's see what this weird community of crypto native people and their sort of tribes and their aesthetic intentions and their financial dispositions, this is the thing that we should try and cater for. Do you think that these are mutually exclusive? And if they are, do you think that one is clearly better than the other one?
00:23:36.670 - 00:24:19.216, Speaker D: Yeah, I think it is never good to force things on people. I think people have to organically discover stuff. And also, I still think we're way too early to do, like, real world things with big brands and stuff like that. I think it has to be more of a grassroots, kind of bottom up type movement. I think when people see what people in these NFT communities are doing and the things that are building and stuff like that, then other people will want to get involved and their friends will want to get involved, and I think that's this kind of slower growth. I think that's a bit more healthy. Yeah.
00:24:19.216 - 00:24:29.620, Speaker D: You know, we've seen various projects try things with big brands and none of them has really worked out and it just makes it a bit more cringe. Right. And that's the last thing that we want.
00:24:30.760 - 00:24:42.700, Speaker C: Yeah. And also a lot of times, like this big brand collaboration, like, so you do it and then what, right. It's like, how much of it goes beyond that initial mint, right. How much of it actually has longevity and creates that culture around it?
00:24:43.810 - 00:24:59.186, Speaker A: I think it's also really, really difficult to get those onboarded because there's a deep level of technical stuff happening and still working in the background that we're.
00:24:59.218 - 00:24:59.790, Speaker D: Still.
00:25:01.650 - 00:25:53.576, Speaker A: Not, in a way, to abstract it away for the end users, which they basically just want to buy an image or something. And if you gonna do it through a stripe checkout or something, then. Then those kind of things will make it really easier to also get your own NFT. And I do at some point, I also think the word NFT has some bad noise to it, like people making money, rugs, losing money, those kind of things. So I think we also somehow need to move away from the word NFT, but more move towards like collection names or digital asset and. Yeah, something that an end user or a normal web two user wants to own. And I think, yeah.
00:25:53.576 - 00:26:18.270, Speaker A: Trying to find ways to bring those type of people, make those type of people interested in getting these, like, collectibles, because almost all people like to collect things, like. And if you want to collect digital things, then it should be made as easy as possible and fit to your personal preferences.
00:26:21.570 - 00:26:34.550, Speaker D: Yeah, I was going to say, I mean, another thing is just, you can also just like, double down on the word NFT and be like, proud of it. Right. I haven't really figured out which approach to take yet. I.
00:26:37.400 - 00:27:20.954, Speaker B: Most of the things we've seen do well or be exciting for people seem to be visual, particularly things that are uniquely visual, which I think is probably a human disposition. You want the thing that's yours and no one else has, and you can look at it maybe late at night and be happy that you have it and no one else has it. I'm curious to hear if you think that there's other media that are ripe to digital collectability. So one of the things is probably music. And Laura was talking earlier about the sort of difficulties there, both technical and cultural and also financial and legal and all that stuff. It hasn't really taken off. That was the thing I was the most excited about initially, was like collecting music in a way that the vinyl did for the physical world.
00:27:20.954 - 00:27:53.170, Speaker B: Having the digital equivalent of that seemed to me to make sense to most people. Like one, it's sort of. Or tickets were a thing for a while, you went somewhere, pops for events, but it still seems to me like the visual thing, your particular cute animal with a weird hat, or your generative art collection that looks kind of nice and interesting seems to be the thing that people gravitate towards the most. Do you feel the same way, or do you think that there's still a shot at making more diverse media be collectible?
00:27:53.630 - 00:28:32.794, Speaker C: Yeah, we're always trying to look beyond that visual version of that NFT. Right. Like you mentioned music. So one thing, and it's not fully cracked, but we're talking to a bunch of partners about the royalty piece and music that's essentially also the promise of NFT. Why don't you use NFT as an underlying technology for licensing your tracks. You have the visual piece, which is a video. Why wouldn't you be able to license music for that video? That is a digital piece.
00:28:32.794 - 00:29:06.346, Speaker C: Right. Digital asset and Nft itself from another NFt. Right. I think we're almost there. We just need to properly package it as a product and do some sort of good ux on it, which is always a hurdle. But there are ways of just layering nfts on the bob nfts so you have a richer experience from like the assets, the digital asset that you are like owning or collecting. And then of course you have other applications of that NFT technology that goes beyond actual art.
00:29:06.346 - 00:29:11.910, Speaker C: But I think just having nfts within nfts is something that I would just love to see more of.
00:29:12.490 - 00:29:51.270, Speaker D: Yeah, I totally agree with Yana there. I think music is a huge use case here. It just hasn't happened yet. I think it will happen in the future, because just everything about the format of NFTs for music is just better programmable. You can integrate something visual, something audio, everything in between, program royalties, make sure everyone gets paid. I think it's really perfect for that. But just how, like Spotify did, you know, disrupted the industry.
00:29:51.270 - 00:30:12.700, Speaker D: I think something like that will happen is just, you know, we're still in the early days of this stuff, but I do believe something like that will happen. It's just that, you know, we're working against these institutions that have like, like publishers and record labels that have been around for a long time. Right. So just kind of working against that is a bit difficult.
00:30:12.830 - 00:30:16.060, Speaker C: Yeah. Or working with them, which takes even longer.
00:30:18.120 - 00:31:02.600, Speaker A: Another thing also, like seeing music and videos being turned into nfts, I see it as the next thing. But you can also put towards books, but even HTML files or even Twitter posts, those kind of things like that, you can tokenize everything just to verify the truth behind it. Like what you see with AI coming up a lot. Like verify. Is it AI? Is it a deepfake? Is it the real video? Or is it the real post? Is it the real message? So I think it will come really far, but it got to take a while to adapt.
00:31:04.620 - 00:31:28.828, Speaker B: Yeah. Do you feel like each of your chains has a different identity? What does it feel like? What does Rychain feel like? I want to start, like, what's the sort of. Because we were saying earlier, right, like, all these things have bespoke blog spaces, have also bespoke identities in some way, bespoke brands, and maybe they attract different kinds of people. How would you describe like Ryer chain as a. As an entity or as a brand.
00:31:28.964 - 00:31:49.740, Speaker C: We are creator first, but we also look at creator in more of a broader definition. Right. Like the moment you want to create something that is. That can be labeled as digital asset for us, you are a creator. You don't have to be creative in the traditional sense of things, right? So you don't have to be publishing a piece of music. You don't have to do photograph. You don't have to do digital art.
00:31:49.740 - 00:32:36.606, Speaker C: It's fine if your creation is a newsletter and you just want to mint that as an NFT. So that's kind of like this accessible creator economy. That's essentially what we stand for. And then also experimentation and innovation. We really want to be helping projects, teams, individuals that want to be doing something new and experimental in this space. And, you know, we really just, you know, welcome them to come to us and talk to our grants team and, you know, our builders in this space as well and figuring out, like, how we can make it happen, because that was like the second big thing we wanted to do with this chain. We wanted to house a lot of experimentation and innovation and really be that a sandbox for playing.
00:32:36.606 - 00:33:10.440, Speaker C: Because just as you were talking, Shane, about the costs on mainnet being high, the rari chain is an l three. It means it's even cheaper than l two s. If you're not doing things in scale, that probably doesn't really matter that much. But if you are trying to do something in scale, like generative art, or even storing big chunks of data on chain, that cost does add up. So we just really want to help be as accessible as possible so that experimentation can take place.
00:33:11.860 - 00:33:57.690, Speaker D: Yeah, I think right now, just because crypto is still a bit niche, a lot of people kind of revolve around kind of the change themselves. When I think a creator should be a bit more focused on directly connecting with their fans, despite what kind of platform that they're on. So we just want to provide the best tooling for them to be able to do that. And also off chain tooling, connecting on social media platforms, on discord bots and stuff like that for them. I don't know if you have more to add to that, Bernie.
00:33:58.800 - 00:33:59.940, Speaker A: Yeah, no.
00:34:02.240 - 00:34:46.172, Speaker B: You mentioned creator funding. I think in the real world, with music industry, for example, or even sort of other kinds of IP, usually some sort of entity finds and makes a bet on someone smaller and who's not that big. And then with that funding and with a sort of attention, then they can sort of compete in the marketplace of ideas and content in a way where there's more to have more ammunition in there, sort of. That's how things work generally. That's how financial things work. You have someone who's willing to make a bet early on and fund that, and that sum has to be someone who can make many bets, right? In the crypto art space, NFT space. We didn't see that happening a lot, at least for a while.
00:34:46.172 - 00:35:34.140, Speaker B: You kind of had fights for yourself on the Twitter noise. Maybe that's a bit difficult for someone who's not popular, right? Otherwise the famous people get more famous, and those who are not famous enough can never really get that escape velocity to actually create a brand and an ip that's substantial. So I personally think that protocols have a responsibility towards creating funding options and sort of promotional options for early stage creators and whatever that means is up to the protocol. But I feel like the equivalent of NGO's or museums or. Well, not museums really, but sort of galleries and labels and the real world, the same kind of public goods funding. Well, that's not public goods funding, but public goods funding in the real world has an analogy with protocol funding in crypto world. How do you guys think about that?
00:35:34.760 - 00:36:43.430, Speaker C: So for us, it's our community that gets to decide, because the protocol and the chain is governed by Dao. So in our Dao, we have delegates and community members that actually do come up with initiatives around how to lift up artists of, you know, different backgrounds and different geographies. So right now there's actually, I think maybe the voting period already closed, but there's a proposal that passed which is all about uplifting creators in South America and, you know, cultivating more of a, you know, following for our ecosystem in that region. Right. So it's always like, in benefit of the DaO, but what the program does is like, it provides platform for underrepresented, underrepresented artists in South America, right? So it's our community gets to come up with the ideas and then decide whether these ideas will see the light of day or not. And, you know, it's a little bit more organic and I. There's less on the foundation side when we are saying that's how we want to be growing the community of the artist.
00:36:43.430 - 00:36:47.170, Speaker C: It's really much more like our community spirit has that.
00:36:48.750 - 00:37:32.230, Speaker D: Yeah, it's always easier when an artist already has a community, but if they don't, they can kind of like bounce off the Stargaze community. Right. There are people that are. Would go mint like every new collection or something like that that launches on Stargaze so they can kind of like start at a certain level. Right. And we also have, Stargaz is also kind of governed by like a Dao and we have like a community dao that also like gives grants to certain artists. And we also have a, like a featured artist spot every Friday.
00:37:32.230 - 00:37:42.160, Speaker D: And we tend to like feature like an artist that is kind of like up and coming just to kind of give them, put them in the spotlight for a little bit.
00:37:43.580 - 00:38:38.780, Speaker A: I also think, like, I didn't get any funding before launching my collection. Yeah, I did get funded my launchpad, launchpad fees, which was really nice to begin with, but I had to build through the bets of the bear market and build my community around it and launch. Yeah, launch purely based on my effort. And when I always talk to creators that want to launch a collection, always be a genuine self. Always try to bring something new to the table and have people excited for your collection. And don't just drop it and hope it will do well because most of the times it won't just do your best effort and try to reach out to many community members and projects. Yeah, to make your, to make yourself known.
00:38:38.780 - 00:38:40.220, Speaker A: And I think that really helps.
00:38:40.340 - 00:39:23.070, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that's super important. Right. Like the campaigning for yourself and like be your own marketing engine. It's like so important now, the community that exists in an ecosystem is obviously like a good leg up, but it's like your success to make, right. It's incredibly important. And I think, like, apart from grants and funding, I think what's also cool is to look at additional ways of providing creators with income streams and revenue streams. So one thing that we're actually workshopping now with our community is can we launch some sort of incentive program? Can we do some sort of ecosystem incentive alignment that brings more revenue to the creator? Look at what Zora is doing.
00:39:23.070 - 00:39:36.690, Speaker C: Minting fees back to the creators more than just the funding in terms of a grant, but there's just so much that can be done for creators to put them in a better position of earning as well.
00:39:37.710 - 00:39:49.838, Speaker B: Great. I think we're almost out of time. Really appreciate everyone's opinions and thoughts and insights and ideas and closing thoughts from anyone. The worst question to ask usually.
00:39:50.014 - 00:40:18.680, Speaker C: Well, I think it's just like being a creator is always tough. It was stuff before web3, and then web3 came and it came with a promise of now you can actually make more money. And I think for a while it was true, but now it's again, like entering that spot when it's maybe, like, tough. So I think persevere and be smart about the way you navigate crypto, because to my previous point, there's multiple ways to make money there, so just take advantage of that.
00:40:18.990 - 00:40:19.302, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:40:19.326 - 00:40:32.730, Speaker D: I mean, if you're a creator and you're curious, you know, just get started. You don't have to launch a whole Pfe collection or something. You can just do an open edition. You can just launch one thing and just get your feet wet and see how that works out.
00:40:33.110 - 00:40:44.930, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think it's nice, like, if you if you're a creator and you're wondering if you should launch your collection or whatsoever, you can always come see me after the talk, and I can. Yeah. Point you in the right direction.
00:40:45.270 - 00:40:47.670, Speaker B: Great. Thank you guys so much. Thank you.
