00:00:00.680 - 00:00:07.286, Speaker A: Welcome to the second annual sovereign radio. I'm your host, Chango Unchained. I'm here with Jim, the co founder of Catalyst. Welcome to the show.
00:00:07.358 - 00:00:08.318, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:08.454 - 00:00:22.038, Speaker A: Well, actually, welcome back to another interview with me. I had you on at entertain FM. That was our first interview together where I met Jim, and it was a fantastic interview. So I'm glad to have you back on a podcast together.
00:00:22.134 - 00:00:25.798, Speaker B: Yeah, glad to do it in person. The vibe's always better in person.
00:00:25.854 - 00:00:38.784, Speaker A: I feel like it definitely is. Yeah. Catalyst, you gave a talk at modular summit. Why don't you bring the audience with us about your talk?
00:00:38.872 - 00:01:18.078, Speaker B: Sure. It was a pretty high level talk, I would say. It was basically just mapping out a diverging path that we have where in the future we're going to see millions of chains enabled by the modular blockchain stack. If we let things be as is, we're going down a path of modular chaos. Lots of chains, lots of fragmentation, pretty terrible user experience. But if we all coordinate, we can go to modular utopia, which is chain abstraction and this very aligned, seamless experience that we're all trying to build and where the bottlenecks of getting us to that utopia, basically. Of course, I have to talk about catalysts.
00:01:18.078 - 00:01:48.534, Speaker B: One of the major bottlenecks that we see is actually allowing solvers, or more solvers to participate in the chain abstraction stack. I mean, I'm jumping a few rings, but basically allowing more of these off chain agents to participate allows more kind of openness and also more price kind of effectiveness of actually allowing chain abstraction to happen such that we can have this glorious no chain experience. So that was kind of the high level overview of it.
00:01:48.662 - 00:02:02.288, Speaker A: Awesome. I'm going to bring us back a few steps to give the audience some context. If they don't know what solvers are or chain abstraction is. Can you explain those concepts?
00:02:02.424 - 00:02:08.968, Speaker B: Yeah. So chain abstraction is, I mean, fancy word, right. For like, stuff that we've already been.
00:02:09.024 - 00:02:10.600, Speaker A: We like to get cute in crypto.
00:02:10.680 - 00:02:13.432, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. We like catchphrases.
00:02:13.496 - 00:02:16.688, Speaker A: Yeah. Chain of traction, AV's, modularity.
00:02:16.864 - 00:02:17.620, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:02:18.040 - 00:02:18.600, Speaker A: Makes payments.
00:02:18.640 - 00:02:46.028, Speaker B: So, I mean, like, it's kind of like in the word, right. But it's like, I think now we're at the phase where we know there's not just going to be one chain. It's not just ethereum or what have you. There's a lot of chains and they all look really different. It's like some chains are on top of another. We call them roll ups, or some of them are by themselves or some of them share the same security properties, but there's a lot of them. It's become very confusing for people to choose which chain they want to be on.
00:02:46.028 - 00:03:40.172, Speaker B: And so there's been a push to abstract that away. How do we add this kind of interstitial middle layer that allows that kind of covers away that complexity and it only exposes what's necessary to not only end users but also application developers? That's chain abstraction in a nutshell. Sorry, you asked about solvers. And so the interstitial layer is composed of a number of actors, which one of them are solvers, which are basically, again, another fancy word, but a way for users to express what they want. Like, oh, I want to earn yield, I want to make money on my existing money. And then solvers basically take that idea and implement it on chain through. It might be a variety of transactions on different chains.
00:03:40.172 - 00:03:45.118, Speaker B: They are the shield or the butlers of sorts of users.
00:03:45.244 - 00:04:25.932, Speaker A: Yes. So just to give everyone a little sanity check about where we are in the technology adoption phase, the conversation now is around chain abstraction and these sorts of, like the sorts, the sort of higher level infrastructure. Because before, in 2017, when the worldview was everything is going to be running on one single monolithic chain, which is ethereum. Turns out the cosmos thesis says, no, it's actually going to be a multi blockchain, multi ecosystem world where there's going to be thousands to, you know, millions of blockchains, potentially. Maybe, maybe not millions.
00:04:26.076 - 00:04:26.644, Speaker B: I think so.
00:04:26.692 - 00:04:54.346, Speaker A: Right, okay, sure. But it's ultimately going to end up as the Internet of blockchains. There's going to be a network set of blockchains. So now that after all these years, there was a cambrian explosion of these different chains, now we're talking about a higher level layer that then standardizes and aggregates the chain state of all of these underlying chains.
00:04:54.418 - 00:04:55.074, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:04:55.242 - 00:05:35.836, Speaker A: So we are now moving towards what Andreas Antonopoulos is talking about. I had Andreas Antonopoulos on interchange. He was the first guest I've had on the podcast, and he was talking about how the web3 space is going to trend in the direction of how web two evolved from web one. Web one was all these different various protocols. Camera, explosion of protocols. Web two evolved because standardization happened. And then now this higher level layer of websites are able to use those standard protocols to be able to join as this network set of websites and servers and whatnot.
00:05:35.836 - 00:06:04.948, Speaker A: So now we're kind of in that phase of standardization. A lot of people still complain about how Web three applications are still not consumer facing. Well, I'm like, well, look at where we are now, right? We're not there yet. We don't have standardization yet. And so we're at that point where we are figuring out standardization and, like, aggregation before the next killer application, like, the next facebooks or whatever, is built on top of this infrastructure in a scalable way.
00:06:05.124 - 00:06:57.158, Speaker B: Yeah, like, I'm glad you bring up, like, web two. Like, and I think, like, YouTube and Netflix are, like, really, really good examples because I don't think anyone really asks how their videos, like, delivered to their screen. But, like, the TLDR is, like, there are, like, servers that host information, and there's actually these, like, intermediary nodes called content delivery networks that, like, like, kind of cache that information, and they're available to you locally in different geographical locations such that you can get it quicker. And so that's why everyone's always pissed where they're like, oh, my inner connection. My Internet connection is really bad, but I get my ads, but I can't load my YouTube video. And they think there's some conspiracy theory of serving you ads. It's just that the ads are literally, physically closer to your computer than the actual video is.
00:06:57.158 - 00:07:15.058, Speaker B: But all that gets abstracted using these things called overlay networks. And we're in that phase where it's like, you can't make a YouTube or a Netflix without these overlay networks. And so we need to build the web3 version of those in order for these amazing applications or amazing experiences that come to light.
00:07:15.154 - 00:07:19.642, Speaker A: So, given that, let's talk about catalyst. Where does catalyst fit into this paradigm?
00:07:19.826 - 00:08:04.744, Speaker B: Yeah. So catalyst is effectively a way for chains to unify liquidity between one another. And so, in kind of the current state that we see right now, new blockchain means new liquidity. Right? Like, they have to get USDC in somehow, or they have their own native token or what have you. Right? Everything is very, like, zero sum. What catalyst does is it allows for the sharing and the unification of liquidity between other chains, right? And so they're able to access the liquidity of other chains the same way as if they were native assets of the chain itself. And so that leads to a lot of capital efficiency in the system and also decreases a lot of the fragmentation that we're seeing.
00:08:04.744 - 00:08:38.204, Speaker B: If you're a new chain or a new roll up and you want to bootstrap a whole ecosystem, you don't need to painstakingly pull USDC from other places and embed into yours. You can simply just leverage their USDC for your users. Instead of having a couple hundred thousand dollars of money floating around your small app, you now have access to billions. That's the high level thesis of what catalyst enables. It's a cross chain application that allows for the access of that liquidity.
00:08:38.292 - 00:08:45.824, Speaker A: Okay, let's talk about that cross chain application, because how is it implemented such that it enables this end goal?
00:08:45.932 - 00:09:13.454, Speaker B: Sure. So catalyst effectively is three pieces. The first piece are vaults where assets are stored. There's assets that live on polygon, assets that live on Ethereum. These are the native assets that I was talking about. Underneath that is what we call a value coordination system that allows these assets to be effectively accessed by other chains. Right.
00:09:13.454 - 00:09:53.208, Speaker B: You can, I mean, said more fancy. It's like a state synchronization system, right. But try not to use two technical words, too fancy words right now. And then underneath that is basically like a data communication system. Right. And we actually outsource that to a number of other interoperability protocols, like layer zero and wormhole and IBC, for example, such that we can use chains that have different ways that they want to communicate, like cosmos chains for IVC and roll ups for wormhole and layer zero, et cetera, et cetera. Let's go back to the structure.
00:09:53.208 - 00:10:15.494, Speaker B: When you deposit assets into the vaults, now you're able to access. So that's the first layer. On the second layer, now you're able to access those assets. Well, how are you actually accessing them? Through this state synchronization, or this data synchronization issue is actually using these various cross chain communication protocols. So that's effectively what it is in a nutshell.
00:10:15.622 - 00:10:25.158, Speaker A: Right. So these vaults, who is providing the liquidity? And are there incentives for providing liquidity.
00:10:25.334 - 00:10:57.332, Speaker B: So the vault can be accessed or can be, like, deposited by anyone, really? But that's not a very helpful answer. We typically see three archetypes of depositors. The first is retail end users, lay people. The second piece is institutional. We're talking about more hedge funds or liquid funds at this point. The third piece is actually the chains themselves. Chains want to get access to other liquidity.
00:10:57.332 - 00:11:02.808, Speaker B: Well, they kind of need to front their own liquidity first. Right. And so they'll do that to bootstrap the pools.
00:11:02.944 - 00:11:03.384, Speaker A: Right.
00:11:03.472 - 00:11:07.928, Speaker B: And so those are kind of like the three, like, differences that we see.
00:11:08.024 - 00:12:05.972, Speaker A: It seems like catalyst has built more of a, like a currency exchange store for different. If a chain is a different country, let's say, and each country has their own fiat currencies. If I'm this new, let's say, country, Liberia or something, don't yet have my own native currency, but I do want to import, or I do have my own native currency, but it's not really heavily used, and I want travelers to come through. So let's say I have european travelers. I need a storefront to exchange currency like the euro to my liberian, my liberian dollars or something. I would imagine that catalyst is sort of this, the currency exchange in here and in Europe or something like that. And then you just provide the exchange routing and orchestration, let's just say.
00:12:06.116 - 00:12:32.294, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's certainly one facet of catalyst, I would say. And I think that's a really good analogy. I think to take the existing analogy further, I think we see it less as like, like tourists coming to the country and exchanging currencies and more of actually like a trade agreement between the actual countries.
00:12:32.462 - 00:12:37.534, Speaker A: Right, also like trade agreement. The Central bank of Liberia and the Central bank of the EU.
00:12:37.702 - 00:12:45.174, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. It's like they need to establish liquid fx markets between each other in order to enable that.
00:12:45.222 - 00:12:45.810, Speaker A: Right.
00:12:46.110 - 00:12:50.816, Speaker B: And then you can have the currency shops, like, leverage that liquidity effectively.
00:12:50.968 - 00:12:51.688, Speaker A: Okay.
00:12:51.824 - 00:13:07.120, Speaker B: But catalyst is also like the liquidity venue, but we also invite and we're working with other partners, like aggregators like Li Fi and Socket, to also be like currency providers effectively.
00:13:07.240 - 00:13:07.592, Speaker A: Right.
00:13:07.656 - 00:13:08.184, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:13:08.312 - 00:13:35.578, Speaker A: So where does the need for an amm arise? Because I would imagine is the way that you're transferring the assets to and from, it requires some kind of a dex or some kind. Again, I don't like using idiosyncratic nomenclature, but kind of like the AMm is sort of figuring out intents. Right. Or limit orders, or like the correct pricing for whatever asset they're trying to transfer over.
00:13:35.674 - 00:13:56.798, Speaker B: Yeah. So again, like, I kind of, like, outline what catalyst looks like in like a really general sense, like the three, um, abilities, uh, or the three. The three parts of the stack. So I would say the amm kind of lives in that middle area where it's like you're allowing value to coordinate between one another.
00:13:56.934 - 00:13:57.446, Speaker A: Right.
00:13:57.558 - 00:14:54.296, Speaker B: And so one way that that can happen, uh, and this is where, like, this is where catalyst is, like, on its v. One stage is through a very simple amm, right. And so you have these vaults of assets, and they're able to swap against each other using effectively, like a cross chain amm curve. That being said, we're thinking really deeply about what does it look like to generalize that you don't necessarily need to leverage the amm, so to speak. And this is where solvers come in, solvers can build their own strategies such that they can provide that liquidity or the value coordination without using the amm, or they use the amm afterwards. If these solvers hold inventory, they're able to basically offer these swaps more as an RFQ like system. And then what they use the amm for is more for a cross chain inventory coordination mechanism.
00:14:54.296 - 00:15:26.738, Speaker B: And so when we look at it from a chain abstraction perspective, I think you use this word at the top. Intents. It's the nice buzzword that we use for what users want. And so you have that top layer, you have the solver layer, all these off chain engines, and at the bottom you have this, they call it settlement, but I basically call it the reimbursement layer. It's like these solvers are fronting money to do things for users. Well, how do they get paid afterwards? And that's the settlement layer and that's where the catalyst Amm comes in.
00:15:26.834 - 00:15:53.622, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah, that makes total sense. All right. And if you enjoyed this highlight reel, please do take a look at Jim's talk on at modular summit. And with that we're going to wrap up if you want a further primer and a deep dive into catalyst Amm. I did do a podcast with Jim that I alluded to earlier and it's on Entertain FM. So thank you for tuning in and thank you for joining sovereign radio.
00:15:53.686 - 00:15:54.990, Speaker B: Thanks for having me. Had a bunch of fun.
