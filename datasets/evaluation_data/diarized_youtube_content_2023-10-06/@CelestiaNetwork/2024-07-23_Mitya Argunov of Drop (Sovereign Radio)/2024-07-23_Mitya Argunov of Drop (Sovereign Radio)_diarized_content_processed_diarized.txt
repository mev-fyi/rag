00:00:00.920 - 00:00:05.086, Speaker A: I'm here with Mitya from drop protocol. Welcome to Sovereign radio.
00:00:05.198 - 00:00:06.838, Speaker B: Hi, and thanks for having me.
00:00:06.934 - 00:00:14.010, Speaker A: So I want to jump in. I want to understand drop protocol, I think. Let's start. What is the problem that you're actually trying to solve?
00:00:14.430 - 00:01:20.062, Speaker B: Yeah, we're solving a problem of unlocking liquidity for the ecosystem and for the interchange ecosystem in general, and for the modular ecosystem as well. And the way we think about this problem is native staking. The way it was implemented in Cosmos SDK and the way it is used in most of the Cosmos SDK based chains is blessing and a curse. Because it is very easy to use because of typically high inflation and high staking aprs, it's very appealing to the users, but it also means that it became almost like a default strategy for everyone holding tier, for instance, now and most of these assets are locked and frozen in native staking, which means that it's difficult to use them elsewhere because they're bonded and it takes 21 days to unbond your tokens. And it means that there is little liquidity for applications or defi application, any sorts of applications to use. It becomes a bit of a chicken and egg problem because you have lack of liquidity. Therefore the applications are not growing as much as they could.
00:01:20.062 - 00:01:26.680, Speaker B: Therefore, it's less appealing to use your liquidity in the applications. And therefore it's kind of more appealing to just stay and hold and relax.
00:01:27.580 - 00:01:44.948, Speaker A: These networks when released. They always kind of encouraged any token holders to stake because it added to the security of the system. So those high staking percentages were kind of seen as a positive. But you're saying that the flip side is you can't get as much usage out of the chain.
00:01:45.124 - 00:02:15.638, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a great question. I think staking percentages per se are not bad. They're great because that's a way to provide security to the chain. The question is basically, how do you solve this conundrum and keep high staking ratio, have great liquidity in the network, but also at the same time have a lot of liquidity for the builders that are building their roll ups, applications and whatnot, and basically make it a blossoming ecosystem with lots of liquidity, flowers blooming and such. Yeah. So that's the idea. Cool.
00:02:15.734 - 00:02:17.662, Speaker A: What about you? What's your role there?
00:02:17.846 - 00:02:32.658, Speaker B: I'm a co founder on the business product side for the protocol. And yeah, I've been kind of in the staking space before, also in the cosmos, was in the smart contract space before. So this is a nice intersection for me.
00:02:32.714 - 00:02:40.058, Speaker A: What about the project drop protocol? Is that a newer company? Is there a history to this project and the other co founders?
00:02:40.194 - 00:02:43.034, Speaker B: Yeah, it's both. It's a new company that has a lot of history.
00:02:43.162 - 00:02:43.642, Speaker A: Okay.
00:02:43.706 - 00:02:54.790, Speaker B: Yeah, the team has a lot of history because the idea of drop and some people in the team, they go back into Lido Ontario days, lino on Terra days.
00:02:55.170 - 00:02:57.994, Speaker A: Well, you guys have seen some things, I'm sure.
00:02:58.042 - 00:03:32.410, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe too much. Yeah, yeah. So light on Terra was a super interesting period because Tera, from the perspective of, like, defi ecosystem, Terra was obviously great. There were lots of very interesting teams that were attracted to this ecosystem and they were building interesting applications on it. And Lido on Terra as a liquid staking protocol was super successful. Not very well known fact, but it was bigger than Lido on Ethereum at some point in 2022. Maybe not for a long time, but, yeah, it was the case.
00:03:32.410 - 00:03:35.350, Speaker B: And then obviously it wasn't anymore.
00:03:35.390 - 00:03:36.894, Speaker A: It was a big crash.
00:03:36.982 - 00:04:17.440, Speaker B: Yeah, there was a big crash, but it also created a bit of an urgency for an idea that existed even before. Okay. Like, liquid staking for Terra is super successful, but how do we enable it for multiple cosmos SDK based chains? And then when Terra crashed, it was more of an urgent thing to do and, yeah, so the idea was, okay, let's create some interchange infrastructure around the protocol so that you can still basically deploy one set of smart contracts on one chain and deal with multiple interchange assets across multiple chains so that you create this kind of network effects around the protocol.
00:04:17.560 - 00:04:41.232, Speaker A: Do you ever consider yourself sort of like a bridge at any point? Because it's almost like you're talking about, like, as it stands right now, you have each one of these chains, they each have stake. They could each have potentially, like, a liquid staking element in them, but you're kind of now trying to bring them together. Like, do you see it sort of as, like, that's. And maybe bridge is such, like the wrong word, but bridge is actually what I think.
00:04:41.256 - 00:05:58.360, Speaker B: That's a great question about the bridge because, well, first of all, I think there is a component to the protocol that allows a smart contract on one chain, and we're launching on neutron to work with all these different assets. So we're not using. Well, we're using IBC for it, obviously. IBC as well as interchain accounts, interchange queries, interchange transactions. So, yeah, there is that part to it, but then there is also a part, like, how do you enable all these assets for the roll ups? And also an interesting thing, because we have a Lido partnership. How do we bridge Steve to the interchain to bring this liquidity to all these applications that are building in the interchange? So that's a different type of a bridge and it's not something that drop builds directly, but we are kind of partnering with a project that has been existing in the neutral shape for a while and it's called the bridge aggregator. So it works with three different bridges between Ethereum and I and neutron and the broader interchange to increase the security of this bridging process, which is a nice way to basically reduce all these barriers of creating interchange liquidity and bring liquidity from Ethereum to the interchange and making everyone comfortable using this.
00:05:58.440 - 00:06:01.400, Speaker A: Which bridges are they? You said three bridges.
00:06:01.520 - 00:06:21.788, Speaker B: Yeah. So these are XLR, wormhole and hyperlane bridges. Yeah. And there is some infrastructure on top of this that makes it almost like a consensus across the bridges. So that first you breach like a signal token that says, okay, we all agree that the bridging actually happens and then you do the actual transfer, but.
00:06:21.804 - 00:06:22.940, Speaker A: This is not you. This is.
00:06:23.020 - 00:07:02.168, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a justin to us, but I think it's like part of the thing that we're building is like, we think that LSTs, especially in the modular ecosystem, are basically, as they can be as successful as good are the integrations between lsts and all the use cases that they support. Like, to my previous point, there are lots of reasons to just stake natively, and therefore you have to create very, very appealing, well integrated, well executed use cases around this kind of liquid tokens to make them like a preferable option, basically, for the token holder. So yeah, this is one of the components of the CPU system.
00:07:02.304 - 00:07:11.054, Speaker A: Where does drop protocol live today? Like, where is it? Because you're talking about linking together all of these different networks. Where does it live?
00:07:11.192 - 00:07:56.220, Speaker B: Yeah, so the smart contracts of drop protocol are now in a testnet on a neutron network. So neutron, it's a separate blockchain that uses interchange security from Cosmos hub. Exactly, yeah. And the assets minted by drop protocol, they can exist anywhere, essentially. And even from the user experience perspective, you could be holding these assets, for instance, like on TA. You can initiate this transaction on TA and then have your liquid token minted and brought to tier within one transaction, essentially. So, yeah, we try to make it as, let's say, as easy to use, and we try to abstract away from where exactly the smart contract is hosted by itself.
00:07:56.220 - 00:08:03.452, Speaker B: There are some very interesting architectural kind of solutions that we're using from neutron. So this is why it's a good place for us to host it for.
00:08:03.476 - 00:08:12.580, Speaker A: A user to engage with you, though. Are they using sort of the traditional cosmos wallets or are they using something else? And which chain are they using?
00:08:13.760 - 00:08:58.042, Speaker B: That's a very good question as well. So, as I said, they can initiate this transaction from basically any chain where they have these assets right now. But, yeah, for the starters, it's mostly kind of normal, quote unquote Cosmos wallets. But I think this is also a very interesting question because wallets and or like custodies and custody providers is one more way how you can working really well with them. You can reduce these barriers to using these assets. And this is one of the things that we're investing heavily into as well. So, yeah, the goal is to basically be really present anywhere where the token holder kind of has this idea of, I want to get more yield on my assets.
00:08:58.106 - 00:08:58.714, Speaker A: Okay.
00:08:58.842 - 00:09:08.252, Speaker B: Yeah. So the goal is to be basically present in any of the channels that they prefer to use. Maybe not even wallets or like any staking websites as such.
00:09:08.316 - 00:09:18.532, Speaker A: But do they have to select a particular chain? Like, would it be using cosmos, atom, or it can be, like, anywhere. Could it be like living in osmosis or something?
00:09:18.596 - 00:09:35.670, Speaker B: Yeah, they can be anywhere, really? And, yeah, shout out to skip protocol, by the way, building great infrastructure that enables that. Yeah, they can be anywhere. They have to know what assets that they want to work with. But, yeah, otherwise the assets do not have to be on a particular chain, really.
00:09:35.790 - 00:09:55.838, Speaker A: So I think the next question then is, in the ecosystem, where do you position yourself? Because, so you're built on neutron, which is connected to the hub. Are you a cosmos hub centric project? This is sort of like where we're coming from. So that's what it sounds like, but, yeah. How do you see yourself in the larger ecosystem?
00:09:55.934 - 00:10:50.456, Speaker B: Yeah, the biggest ecosystems for us, or, like, the biggest assets for us are tia and atom. Yeah. And we're liquidity centric rather than ecosystem centric, really. I think these two ecosystems are kind of unique, and they have probably different approaches to how exactly you unlock liquidity. But what we're building, essentially, is this infrastructure that allows the liquidity to be unlocked and creates flywheel effects around these liquid assets and ways to integrate into these ecosystems so that it becomes basically as native as possible for the ecosystems. So from that perspective, we belong to the interchain ecosystem first, and then we build kind of presence in different parts of this broad ecosystem, if it makes sense. Now, these terms are getting very confusing, but I hope it helps, though.
00:10:50.608 - 00:11:14.900, Speaker A: Well, and so you sort of talk about Tia and Adam as your base tokens. It's interesting to me because I feel like over the last few years, you'd often more see like, Adam and osmosis. Now you're really seeing Tia as like the second or like the equal to Adam. Are you seeing other teams doing that? Is that a trend, do you think, in the larger interchange ecosystem to use those two pairs?
00:11:15.060 - 00:11:49.318, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm not sure if it's a trend. I think there are lots of teams that belong more to, let's say, to the module. So, for instance, teams that are building roll ups, I think they kind of maybe belong more to the module. There are definitely a few very interesting projects that exist in the intersection. So, for instance, one of the recent transitions that happened is stargaze. That used to be a cosmos SDK based l one. And I guess you could argue that it belonged more to the cosmos hub ecosystem.
00:11:49.318 - 00:11:56.912, Speaker B: It's now also launching roll up, but they keep in the l one chain, so they stay interconnected in a sense, with Celestia. Yep.
00:11:56.976 - 00:11:58.952, Speaker A: Oh, cool. I didn't know that.
00:11:59.136 - 00:12:22.496, Speaker B: Yeah, it's kind of a recent development, but yeah, I think we're not alone. And so our thinking is that there are kind of huge network effects to explore on the intersection of these, because like on the level of the technical stack, they're using many of the same components. And then once you have this kind of network effects around this infrastructure, it's probably helpful for both ecosystem actually to benefit from.
00:12:22.608 - 00:12:33.660, Speaker A: So you're saying you're supporting Tia, but is like, what is your relationship to the celestia? Like, ecosystem? Are you also using celestia for Da. Are you going to be a roll up of some kind?
00:12:34.080 - 00:14:14.510, Speaker B: Yeah. So we are supporting TA, meaning that any tier holder could mint or ta staker, could mint a liquid, liquid token or liquid token derivative, got it. Based on TA, and then use it in like whatever applications, not necessarily in modular ecosystem, but presumably primarily in the modular ecosystem and our relationship with the ecosystem, I guess largely in how we work with the tier holders and tier roll ups to enable this liquidity for the ecosystem. So for the roll ups, and generally speaking for apps in the celestial ecosystem, this liquidity is required to grow. And therefore our role is to make it very easy for them to get access to this liquidity, very easy for them to keep the roll up sovereign and get benefits from enabling this liquidity on the roll ups and essentially creating the incentives in the ecosystem so that different actors in the ecosystem, like users, validators, builders, all have joint incentive for growing the liquidity, unlocking liquidity from native staking and using it to grow the ecosystem at the end of the day. So from that perspective, we actually think that LSTs are pretty, have pretty important role in any ecosystem because I told about this kind of, let's say very deep imbalances that the native staking creates. And LST as a layer on top of native staking can to a large extent kind of fix this imbalances and create different set of incentives for everyone involved.
00:14:14.510 - 00:14:31.280, Speaker B: And I think this is the key role that we can play in the modular ecosystem. It largely is an incentives alignment role from our perspective. And that's kind of the fundamental problem that we need to solve to unlock the COVID of this frozen assets.
00:14:32.260 - 00:14:42.004, Speaker A: I think I just asked if you're using their DA, but I guess you wouldn't because you're on neutron. Does your system actually have to use that in any way?
00:14:42.052 - 00:15:25.108, Speaker B: Yeah, let's say the current implementation of drop protocol relies on neutron, which uses cosmos hubs security. And there are very good reasons for us to use this particular setup and also because of some of the DeFi primitives that exist in the neutron ecosystem that allow us to essentially create very little friction to use the assets. Having said that, I think there are lots of exciting developments in the modular ecosystem in general. Never say never. So we'll see about that. But yeah, for now, let's say from the architectural perspective, we belong to the neutron ecosystem. That's where the smart contracts are hosted and work with assets everywhere.
00:15:25.284 - 00:15:46.292, Speaker A: So I have a last question and maybe drop protocol kind of solves this, but are you at all worried about the liquidity problem in the interchange ecosystem? Generally? Even what I see, what you've said is you actually enable more liquidity, but generally there's not a lot of liquidity, there's not even that much action. Are you worried a little bit that there's just not enough happening there?
00:15:46.356 - 00:16:29.672, Speaker B: This is, I think exactly this chicken and egg problem that I was describing. So like, action has to be enabled by something. And back to the terror example, Terra was the place where it actually happened because of these kind of mechanisms that created on the network level that every defi builder benefited from. So our theory is that the action starts to happen more once you have liquidity, which is more readily available for the builders, and that every builder that comes has an opportunity to get way more liquidity to their protocol. And this is what we are trying to solve. So yes, it is a concern, but this is exactly the problem that we're addressing.
00:16:29.776 - 00:16:32.872, Speaker A: Perfect. Cool. Well, thanks so much for this interview.
00:16:32.976 - 00:16:37.816, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks for having me. Again, great questions. And yeah, I enjoyed the discussion a lot.
00:16:37.888 - 00:16:43.120, Speaker A: Cool. And thank you for watching this episode of Sovereign Radio. See you on the next one.
