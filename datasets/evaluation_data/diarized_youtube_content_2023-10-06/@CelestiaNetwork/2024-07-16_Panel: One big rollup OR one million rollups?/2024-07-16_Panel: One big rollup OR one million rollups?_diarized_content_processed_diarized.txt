00:00:01.800 - 00:00:37.260, Speaker A: Hey, everyone. Thank you so much for being here today. We're gonna unpack one mega roll up or a million roll ups. Today we have Shuyo from mega Eth, Azeem from Morph, Ben from Starkware, and Marine from optimism. I'm just gonna get us started off, like, I guess, a little bit of background. Since the roll up centric roadmap came out in 2020, we've seen hundreds, if not thousands of roll ups just proliferating across the space. Some EVM, just additional execution points for EVM specific apps, additional roll ups that are more so, like Alt VM or next gen VM, in addition to a bunch of app specific roll ups.
00:00:37.260 - 00:00:57.240, Speaker A: We haven't really quite found what the winner is, if there's going to be one, if there's going to be many. And I'm just going to get us started off with a really straight to the point question. What do we think? One roll up or a bunch of rollups? If there is one roll up, do we think it's technically feasible to bring all of the world's users on chain in one state machine? Shuyal, let's get started with you.
00:00:58.900 - 00:01:26.610, Speaker B: Oh, it works. Yeah. I mean, I don't think you can have, like, one roll up that houses the world's transaction, but I think we need to make that one roll up, whatever it is, to be as powerful as possible to enable compute intense application to co locate. So, I mean, to answer your question, obviously not one or what, but we need lots of really powerful blockchains.
00:01:27.710 - 00:01:33.222, Speaker C: So, yeah, I'm gonna start this by saying I'm the least technical person on my founding team.
00:01:33.286 - 00:01:34.894, Speaker B: Actually, I think I'm the least technical.
00:01:34.982 - 00:01:35.918, Speaker D: I'm the least technical.
00:01:36.014 - 00:01:36.862, Speaker A: There's no way.
00:01:36.926 - 00:01:49.198, Speaker B: But the thing is, our moderator asked us a bunch of pretty technical questions. I'm literally waiting on my telegram that my CTO can send an answer back to me. So you see me checking my phone is really like, I'm too mid card for this panel.
00:01:49.254 - 00:01:51.810, Speaker A: I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to at all. I apologize.
00:01:53.000 - 00:02:07.060, Speaker C: So, in talking to my CTO, I was actually curious about this myself. And because of these distinct user scenarios, it's definitely not possible on cost, security, and scalability. And so, according to him, this is definitely not something that's going to happen.
00:02:09.080 - 00:02:40.390, Speaker D: Yeah. So I think at least thinking about the l two as being able to house the world's transactions as at least an interesting thought experiment, takes you down the path of the l two, needs to be as scalable as possible. So we believe that's obviously with stark scale logarithmically with the more transaction data. So I mean, you definitely need to build your stack. I mean, we think that you need to build your stack in that direction of one roll up while still opening the door for different ways to enable app chains.
00:02:41.530 - 00:03:05.680, Speaker E: Yeah, I mean, I think plus one to what we said, right? I think we agree there isn't going to be a single roll up. We've already seen right now with the market that there is a need for multiple roll up and different types of roll up. It's sort of how do you enable all these use cases to easily build and then interact with one another both within the same stack and across different stacks? I would think.
00:03:06.300 - 00:03:42.540, Speaker A: All right, so I think we all agree probably multiple roll ups, not exactly sure how many, but obviously each roll up is going to have like a different flavor, some of which are general purpose, something like optimism, and others of which are more so focus on a specific sector like consumer for morph. Curious to see how you guys think about that. And what might be the winning strategy as a roll up. Why do you choose to go more so to the general purpose route or more so specific to a particular ecosystem or a particular type of application? Feel free. Anyone can get us started, maybe. Ben, you want to get us started with that question?
00:03:42.920 - 00:04:19.909, Speaker D: Sure. If you're an app and you're looking at the landscape of everything, you really need to understand if you need composability with other smart contracts on chain. If you do, and you also care about things like economic security, guarantees of the base layer, you're probably going to deploy it to a big l two. If you don't need composability quite as much, then you're looking at an app chain. You can also get other different trade offs, like extremely high throughput, extremely low transaction price, you have a lot more control over the knobs of your app chain. If you go the l three route.
00:04:24.409 - 00:04:32.513, Speaker A: Maybe Xu Yao, curious about your chain. I'm assuming you're creating an l two, is that correct, Maggie? It's going to be an l two, yes.
00:04:32.561 - 00:04:35.609, Speaker B: Well, yes, we are using theorem security.
00:04:35.729 - 00:04:51.718, Speaker A: Okay, great. So I'm just curious, just curious. I know, performance, right. And that you're talking about having really high performant environment. Are you thinking of focusing on a specific type of use case or more so just enabling like any type of use case? And why would you do one or the other?
00:04:51.854 - 00:05:37.738, Speaker B: Yeah, so actually I think about how I got into crypto in 2017, and I think actually everyone wonders like the question of why blockchain. Right. And I think the core tenet to my thesis is interoperability and having application to co locate, to explore capital efficiency and create new marketplace. So with that interoperability thesis as in mind, I actually don't think you need application that just live on their own, own single chain and doesn't have to be interacted with other applications. I think that's web two applications. So if you want to be qualified for web3 applications, you need to interact with others. So that's why we're building a general purpose roll up that is extremely powerful.
00:05:37.738 - 00:06:06.160, Speaker B: We call ourselves the first real time blockchain because we have extremely low latency. So some millisecond. In comparison, Solana has 400 milliseconds. And with our blockchain, you can actually have a lot of compute intense consumer applications while the consumer guy is sitting next to me. So I think you have to answer this question afterwards. And then. So that gives you the web two experiences without losing the web3, interoperability.
00:06:06.700 - 00:06:07.276, Speaker E: And.
00:06:07.388 - 00:06:08.292, Speaker B: Oh, did you?
00:06:08.396 - 00:06:38.986, Speaker E: No, I was just going to disagree a tiny bit on the point that what doesn't constitute web two, web web3 would be automatically web two things. Like, for example, autonomous worlds, I think, have like app change. That has a very direct thesis as to why it should be a web3 application and use case. And I think that's a very interesting use case for web3 applications. Right. That doesn't need to be a general purpose roll up.
00:06:39.018 - 00:07:11.610, Speaker B: For example, the synergy, you can explore, for example, with a fully on chain game. So there's a team called biome. They're building a fully on chain. Minecraft. Minecraft. And yes, it can exist in their own environment, but if you put it in a general purpose chain, that autonomous world can interact with a lot of primitives that is equally in the same general purpose. Right? So think about like, there's a random meme coin that gets launched in the, in the roll up, and that meme coin, perhaps some of them enter the autonomous world and someone start hoarding, I don't know, red hat.
00:07:11.610 - 00:07:25.110, Speaker B: And then somehow this meme code has became really popular and these can start and red hat bank in autonomous world. So I think. And that's really where you create magic and imagination when you have applications co locate.
00:07:25.730 - 00:07:46.790, Speaker C: Yeah. Similarly, we went general purpose because it'd be easier for the smart contract protocols to interact with each other as opposed to different roll ups on it. And gaming was one of the specific ones where we looked. Defi infra could be used for in game tokens or NFTs, using Dexs and NFT marketplaces, as opposed to doing it a different way. And so we thought it would just make a more diverse ecosystem that way.
00:07:49.170 - 00:08:23.850, Speaker A: So I guess the benefits of obviously sharing a chain are like the real time atomic composability, but at the same time, you have more expressivity when you're creating an app chain. So I'm curious. I know that for starkware and for optimism, you're looking into l two and l three ecosystems of which you can choose either being deployed directly to the l two and taking advantage of the atomic composability, or going your own way and creating your own roll up. I'm curious, what do you think is an app then that would be best suited for an app chain environment or an l three, as opposed to deploying as a smart contract? Maureen, we can start with you.
00:08:24.310 - 00:09:06.890, Speaker E: Yeah, for sure. So I think, as you said, it's kind of like the expressivity, like what you're looking for. There's certain use cases that just want to be a smart contract on an existing general purpose chain. There's others that want capabilities such as, for example, utilizing their token as the gas token, in which case that can be well suited for an l two, or even an l three if they're more cost conscious and want to compose more. With the l two in question. With the l two in question. So I think it's sort of like security and cost trade offs and the level of like, customization you're looking for.
00:09:08.390 - 00:09:49.130, Speaker D: So I would agree with what you said earlier. We think autonomous worlds are interesting. As an l three, you can almost maybe even think of it like a state channel, in which it kind of writes the final state to the chain at the end of the game. And there's obviously merit to it being on the actual l two as well. But different games have different use cases. There's some use cases that have come out recently where people need different verification use cases. So you can think of like an l three that writes its state diff to Celestia as well as the proof, and then the client can actually run the verifier and be convinced of the state transition himself.
00:09:49.130 - 00:09:55.050, Speaker D: So there's a lot of actual different software architectural use cases that you can do with app chains.
00:09:56.190 - 00:10:22.390, Speaker A: Xu Yao, I'm going to call upon you again. I know you mentioned, obviously the benefits of having that atomic composability, an autonomous world. Someone could be in that environment and then go easily and get a meme coin and pull it back in, but what do you see as the potential limitations to this? Like, at a certain point, like, I understand that mega ETH is really going for performance, but is there a world in which you just really have to have an app chain from your perspective, in which it's not possible to all fit it in one environment?
00:10:23.490 - 00:10:50.030, Speaker B: Sounds like skill issue to me. So I think, I mean, with like da solutions, like Celestia. Right. You're in empowering general purpose roab. Like mega used to be fast and, and cheap. And I think in the future the technology will get even more modular, even more granular. For example, we have no specialization, which my head of growth just talked to you guys about.
00:10:50.030 - 00:11:25.190, Speaker B: So I think the blockchain performance will only get better and better. And that allows us to have application that utilize the block space because I think fundamentally, right now we have more block space than applications. I appreciate everybody discussing worrying about a future where we run out of block space, but I do think right now, now we have to worry about not having use cases. I think to answer your question more directly, we actually just do not see a world of app chain. We think if the general purpose chain is powerful enough, then application must collocate together.
00:11:26.050 - 00:11:47.540, Speaker A: Interesting. So I see we kind of have a divide here for different teams. We'll see what happens over time. But I guess realistically, we're all building in different directions. And from the user's perspective, they have so many different chains, whether it be app chains or general purpose chains to choose from. There might be an application they want on optimism, another one they want on mega eth. And they're going to have to all be connected.
00:11:47.540 - 00:12:27.720, Speaker A: So I'm curious to get your take. Obviously, now we have bridges, we're working on shared sequencers, and in the farther future, there's going to be the abstraction networks where the user doesn't necessarily know what route was taken, just that it was the best path. But this could introduce some trust assumptions in using a bridge that isn't a fully validating bridge or whatnot. I'm curious, do you guys think it's acceptable to enter into additional trust assumptions to be able to get users between all of these chains? And if not, why that makes sense. I can revert that because I think I kind of went a little convoluted direction. But you want to get started, Maureen?
00:12:27.800 - 00:13:17.178, Speaker E: Yeah, yeah, no, I think there's certain solutions that are coming up like Interop. Right. In the more intent based interoper at optimism building, native interop. But that's going to be able to be leveraged by like relayers using an intent based system. And so there, the trust assumptions are especially not within the native interop minimized. So you do, I mean, in the future there will be a world, right, where the trust assumptions of the users aren't the ones that they are today with certain like bridging mechanisms. So I think it will become quite interesting without the users funds being at risk and more focusing, like what is the ultimate intent of the user, and they'll never actually see the bridge or have to bridge, and it will be rather like the relayer that takes the risk.
00:13:17.178 - 00:13:20.830, Speaker E: And so there will be just a pricing to that.
00:13:22.410 - 00:13:51.260, Speaker D: I think it's definitely a valid question. I mean, anytime you're injecting any type of trust into these systems, it seems like it should be a bad thing, right? We're supposed to be trust list in blockchain. So. Yeah, so for Stark, where for Starknet specifically we prove the consumption and the writing to our messaging queue. So there's no, there's no trust assumptions in the system. It's a trustless bridge. So I think these solutions will pop up.
00:13:51.260 - 00:13:57.188, Speaker D: I think they're inevitable. But I think it's a valid question as to, you know, what are we really doing here?
00:13:57.324 - 00:14:18.068, Speaker E: And maybe just like one more thing there, like the users are already there. There is trust assumptions, right? Like they're connecting with a wallet, with an RPC provider. Like everybody's not running their own node at home, so they're already willing to make these compromises. It's just how do you like reduce them and reduce the security risk factors?
00:14:18.164 - 00:15:21.750, Speaker A: I think, I guess from my perspective it's like, it's more so on the safety side of things, like I think that we can, the way I see like what the mega roll up might be, it might not be like one singular chain that is the mega roll up, but it's that these ecosystems of chains, so whether they be in the ethereum ecosystem or the celestial ecosystem, if they're using a shared consensus NDA layer, they're able to have trust, minimize composability using shared sequencers or using just prove aggregation networks or whatnot, to me, I think that if you stay within a certain ecosystem in that way, you're able to have that feeling of truly one mega roll up that doesn't have the additional trust assumption. Obviously that's a little bit farther in the future. But curious, how do you guys think about that? Do you think that a mega roll up would be just these zones of sovereignty or would they extend to potentially these order flow abstraction networks that go between DA layers, if that makes sense. Shuya, I guess I'll start with you.
00:15:29.210 - 00:16:21.926, Speaker B: I feel like, I think if we're really successful as an industry where there are so many people using crypto every day, so many interesting use cases, I do think what you're envisioning, how different parts of blockchain interact with each other. So I think answer is yes. I see that that specific solution, I'm not sure, to be honest. I feel like the topic us as an industry have been discussing every single year actually is very different. And oftentimes there's no correct answer. I think shared sequencing is extremely popular these days at mega east, we actually take a very different approach to share sequencing, which means we actually don't believe in shared sequencing. What we're doing is rotating centralized sequencer.
00:16:21.926 - 00:16:54.764, Speaker B: So at any one moment we just have one centralized sequencer. That's how we ensure the performance is to the moon. But then there is a way to rotate the sequencer that's being used at the moment. So, I mean, you can criticize different approaches. I think right now it's really hard for me to think about which one is going to win. And I think different application or different blockchain ecosystem have different preference for security and decentralization. What we need to do, even for the blockchain ecosystem, is to enable them to express different approaches.
00:16:54.764 - 00:17:17.360, Speaker B: For example, I personally don't think that L2 needs to be as decentralized as layer one. Right? Like that's layer one's job, to be decentralized. Why are you replicating layer one's job? You should just use what other blockchains have done really well. Use celestia as your data availability layer. Shout out to Celestia and don't reinvent the wheel. So I hope that answered your question.
00:17:18.940 - 00:17:21.160, Speaker A: Sure. Anyone else want to take that?
00:17:23.860 - 00:17:46.590, Speaker D: I guess. One other thing I'll mention is in the not too distant future, we'll be committing to bitcoin as well. So there's actually, you can maybe even think of it like different zones of sovereignty within the same general purpose l two rollup. And then we'll also have volition as well. So kind of up to the developer, up to the user where they feel they want to get sovereign.
00:17:49.250 - 00:18:25.290, Speaker E: Yeah, no, I think everything has been shared in terms of shared sequencing. I think that's quite interesting. I think as we see many different l two s utilizing the same roll up as a service providers, we're obviously going to see some that are going to want to use shared sequencing and that's going to enable atomic transaction around separate roll ups. So that's going to be interesting in terms of like what's going to win. I don't think there's going to be one winner in all of this. I think there's a world where you need a super beefy sequencer. There's a world where you need an app chain.
00:18:25.290 - 00:18:31.422, Speaker E: And I think this is what the market is showing that they want. So I think everybody's going to win.
00:18:31.566 - 00:18:32.890, Speaker D: Very optimistic.
00:18:34.220 - 00:18:47.880, Speaker A: Yeah, we're all gonna win. Yeah, I like to think that as well. I think it is really interesting. Right. Like everybody has a totally different approach and there's no one size fits all solution for everybody. So my feeling is a million roll ups, more than one mega roll up.
00:18:49.180 - 00:18:51.684, Speaker E: One mega roll up among a thousand roll ups.
00:18:51.732 - 00:19:29.754, Speaker A: Kind of, yeah. Hopefully at the end of the day it'll be totally abstracted to the point where you don't, you don't even know what you're doing, just that you're gonna trust, minimize way. I want to dive a little deeper, I guess, into what these independent networks will look like. Okay, so we have like the whole larger thing, you know, some of which will have trust, minimized composability, some of which will have some points of trust. But maybe these ecosystems, like for example, morph, focusing on consumer will have like a consumer experience, like at the smart contract platform level. So, yeah, I just want to dive in a little bit more into morph. Azim, I know we haven't chatted a lot about, like, your approach to consumer within like a.
00:19:29.754 - 00:19:32.810, Speaker A: A sovereign environment. So curious why you went in that direction.
00:19:33.270 - 00:20:15.230, Speaker C: So we went with trying to go for general purpose, having smart contracts deployed to the l two for composability and interoperability. But we're going with. I'm actually reading this ethereum for Da zkps with optimistic roll ups right now, but one of the things that we thought about or looked at for like, apps that might need better cost or performance is going to be being able to use a different DA for an l three with them. And it's one of the things like, have not chatted enough with Celestia. I've seen Nick in the crowd, but been chatting with avail and eigen about what that would look like in the future when we get to the point that we can do that.
00:20:15.810 - 00:20:37.470, Speaker A: Got you. So you're also, I guess, having the l two s as well as enabling an l three ecosystem in the future. Yeah, got you. So three for four going in that direction. Shuya, I'm gonna pick on you again one more time. I know you're just going in a different direction, so I find it really fascinating. I'm curious, like, from the technical perspective, like, how are you going to enable this true scale on one roll up?
00:20:37.810 - 00:21:20.130, Speaker B: Yeah, so great. By the way, apology for my voice, but we're throwing another party tonight if you want to come to Megarave. We have a good dj from Berkind, so, yeah, dude, that's hard to get them. And you might get a chance to win the hat too. So the question was, what do we do? So anyone read this paper from block, from Vitalik in 2021? It's called end game. Yes. Yeah.
00:21:20.130 - 00:21:59.598, Speaker B: So in the endgame, you know, dude wrote this in 2021, many years ago. He said the likely endgame of scaling Ethereum, one of the potential, well, to one of the two possible end game is to have a blockchain, a mega roll up that has a relatively centralized block production and very decentralized block validation. And that's exactly what Megaeuse does. So our block production, which is our sequencer, is extremely beefy. We've done a lot of optimization. We wrote the entire state trial to make sure that it's extremely performant. And we have extremely decentralized and lightweight validating node to ensure the security.
00:21:59.598 - 00:22:41.106, Speaker B: And obviously we're using Ethereum security guarantee. We have forced exit. And also, and then in terms of data availability, we're exploring our options. And so these as a together is called node specialization. So rather than having one set of nodes that does all the activities, as most layer one blockchains and a lot of the L2s, we have different nodes that specialize in the things that they're really good at. So our secret sauce is actually not so inventive as what we would claim. Actually, Vitalik wrote about this many years ago, and I think the reason that not a lot of people have actually built it is actually a skill issue.
00:22:41.106 - 00:22:58.736, Speaker B: So my co founders are extremely cracked. They studied low latency data center computer, Stanford PhD and distributed system at MIT for many years. So I think we saw the vision and we actually are making it happen.
00:22:58.928 - 00:23:08.500, Speaker A: So, interesting. So are you saying that these validating nodes are going to be lightweight, like in the same sense that like a celestial light node is lightweight, so more people can validate and then just.
00:23:08.880 - 00:23:15.380, Speaker B: Yes, our L2 full nodes are extremely lightweight. So we decoupled the execution from the L2 full node.
00:23:16.200 - 00:23:39.544, Speaker A: Interesting. Yeah, I definitely need to dive into your docs more. Thank you for going into that detail. It is really curious to see all teams going in different directions, and so I appreciate the level of detail that you give. I'm going to zoom out a little bit now and be a little bit less technical. I've heard lately about this notion of enshrining certain core infrastructure into a protocol. Like, for example, barachain.
00:23:39.544 - 00:24:06.590, Speaker A: They're having their barachain native Dex or their barachain native lending platform, and I think I've heard whispers throughout the ecosystem. We're probably going to see more of this in the future, as opposed to just having like a fully permissionless, general purpose execution environment. So kind of helping the ecosystem become a little bit more specific in what they're trying to offer. I'm curious if any of your teams have thought about doing something like this, like enshrining apps at the protocol layer, and if so, why? And if not, why not?
00:24:08.130 - 00:24:32.880, Speaker C: Since we're still in Testnet, it was something we did consider. We ended up shying away from it, though, because we thought while it might be better in the short term for having everyone know exactly where to go for things, we thought it would feel a little bit monopolistic because other people who would want to then launch would be in a really bad position to be able to compete with the native things that we had enshrined. And so we didn't want to set a scenario where that would happen.
00:24:35.220 - 00:24:44.020, Speaker A: I guess also, you know, opportunities, optimism and starkware are not doing this approach. Do you see any benefits or perhaps drawbacks to potentially going in that direction in the future?
00:24:45.440 - 00:25:06.120, Speaker E: Yeah, no, I mean, op mainnet, the network obviously didn't make this decision. Optimism, providing the op stack, also does not make this decision, or even like, very weary of including certain pre compile or pre deploys, because we're even thinking about, like, not wanting to create state bloat that some networks might not want.
00:25:06.160 - 00:25:06.336, Speaker A: Right.
00:25:06.368 - 00:25:17.960, Speaker E: So it's up to the chains that deploy to make those decisions if they want it or not. So at the tech stack level, we don't want to impose anything like that.
00:25:18.080 - 00:25:37.758, Speaker D: Yeah, same for us. You know, we don't want to introduce any type of complication into the protocol layer that doesn't need to be there. You know, the benefit of it being general purpose is that anyone can then go deploy these things. And it does sound like a good use case for an app chain. At the end of the day, you know, if that's something that they'd like to enshrine, that's a perfect reason to.
00:25:37.774 - 00:25:42.126, Speaker B: Have an app chain okay, I'm sorry.
00:25:42.158 - 00:25:44.142, Speaker A: I'm just another commentary intake.
00:25:44.206 - 00:26:12.970, Speaker B: Cool. Yeah. We actually have co located Oracle for mega east, and the reason is we're here to make Ethereum grid again and beat all the other alts. Layer one. And the reason is we have rotating centralized sequencer. So when you co locate the oracle with a centralized sequencer, you can do magical things like arbitrages that no one else can do. And this is really a ten x experiences for a blockchain network.
00:26:12.970 - 00:26:30.208, Speaker B: Well, similar to a web, two services. So that's what I think the different things that we're doing, because the benefits is very obvious to any asset to asset transfer primitives. Omega eth.
00:26:30.344 - 00:26:32.088, Speaker A: So basically, you go ahead.
00:26:32.184 - 00:26:43.704, Speaker D: How does the co location with the sequencer facilitate that? How does the co location of the oracle with the sequencer facilitate that? I mean, you'll still have oracle data on the.
00:26:43.792 - 00:27:07.520, Speaker B: Yeah, well, it's colocated, right. It's extremely fast. So you can do arbitrages because everything we do is low latency, which is why we call ourselves the first real time blockchain, because we get, you get first time money market, first time Dexs, and then if you get liquidation, it's actually micro liquidation. You don't get like a sudden liquidation because the round trip for transaction, extremely fast.
00:27:08.100 - 00:27:13.480, Speaker E: But I guess co located means, like, it's not enshrined in the protocol, right? Like you're just running it out of the.
00:27:14.340 - 00:27:25.220, Speaker B: Yeah, we struggle. Like, is this enshrining because, like, in ethereum world, like enshrine, like a bare metal server. Yeah, yeah. But, yeah. Sara, thanks for the correction.
00:27:27.160 - 00:27:44.416, Speaker A: All right. I've actually run out of my questions. We've gone pretty quickly. Is there anything you guys want to talk about? I can go one by one. If there's kind of an overall overarching theme, what do we think? One roll up, a million roll ups? How do we feel after all these talk? After all this talk? Maureen, I'll let you finish up.
00:27:44.488 - 00:28:11.522, Speaker E: Okay, well, I think my position is a bit clearer. And I will just say also, not just like, for, like, public blockchains. Right. But private blockchains. Ideally, there's a future also where private blockchains are needed, or already is and are. And so I think we're. They're clearly not going to, like, governments are going to want blockchain, and ideally that leads to, like, efficiency, hopefully not CBDC, but like, other types of more efficient private blockchains.
00:28:11.522 - 00:28:55.772, Speaker E: And they're not going to want, like, one, like a public blockchain where they don't control the sequencer. So even just from that aspect. Right. I think you see that there's a need for like many different types of blockchains to meet the different types of applications there is. And I think the problem, even if like super beefy and fast with a general purpose chain, it doesn't have like the customizability to meet the need of certain use cases. Right. I, I mean, I'm not sure what sort of like block time you're looking for, but I'm maybe perhaps like games are looking for something even more, like even better or certain use cases will always want more and are willing to make trade offs on other things that, like for general purpose you wouldn't want.
00:28:55.836 - 00:28:56.440, Speaker A: So.
00:28:57.620 - 00:28:59.760, Speaker E: Yeah, that's been my thoughts on that.
00:29:00.620 - 00:29:36.460, Speaker D: Yeah. So at the end of the day, app chains are cool, in my opinion. And we believe that you need to have the general purpose l two be as performant and have as performant as a stack as possible so you can employ those things at the app chain layer at some point. I think it's also a switch to app chains, but in a similar vein, is proving snarks on starks. So you can do things that aren't even app chains but that are still provable on the general purpose l two. So there's a lot of different use cases that we want to enable from the general purpose l two, you know, to different layers.
00:29:37.280 - 00:31:15.210, Speaker C: I have two sort of spicy takes. One is that I know we're constantly talking about how only more infra gets funded, and I actually think more infra does need to get funded because we're not at the place where we have an understanding of how things actually will end up going with this. And I, the other thing is, is the infighting that I end up seeing within Ethereum actually, like, is interesting because it reminds me of AOL because I'm old and, and I think about how AOL commanded the majority of the market before and how there are many people who still assume, like, Ethereum has fully won already. When I do look at how, like, Aptos and Swe or like when mega eth came out, although you guys are EVM, that it seems like there's going to be different chains for different things, and that what my guess is is that interoperability and composability end up working the right way between them over time where things are abstracted away. And there will definitely be like app specific chains, but they might be on completely different blockchains as well. I think, like, oftentimes we're in this echo chamber where everyone talks as if, like, eth has already won forever. And I do my best to go out to other ecosystems and, like, one of the people who was not fading Solana last year, and then, like, seeing what they've done and people will still say like, oh, well, it's just meme coins, but, like, they've also done deals with visa.
00:31:15.210 - 00:31:18.370, Speaker C: And so when I look around, it's.
00:31:18.450 - 00:31:22.596, Speaker A: Sort of looking at that final spicy take.
00:31:22.708 - 00:32:07.278, Speaker B: I was gonna say mega youth is the real Solana. More performance and more secure and really exploiting the limit of hardware. Yeah, I think I respect, honestly what optimism has done for our industry a lot. I think what mega east is doing, we cannot do what we do with optimism. We are using optimistic concerns as consensus note. Right? Like, so me here talking about magics doesn't mean like, other roll up is, is anything worse. I think everybody has done things really good so that we can stand on the, on the shoulder of giant.
00:32:07.278 - 00:32:40.854, Speaker B: I really love what starkware does as well. We also think DK is the future. No offense, I feel like no optimism. You guys are also introducing ZK, but you got my point. I think all of this very interesting innovation and different direction is just pushing everyone to think further about how to onboard applications. Marine, when you were talking about the fully launching game, I got really excited because I think this is truly a crypto native use case that it would be great if it's an app chain. It would be great if it's omega eth.
00:32:40.854 - 00:33:06.560, Speaker B: Honestly, it doesn't matter as long as, you know, like web two. Like we onboard more people to the fantastic world that we live in. We're obviously very opinionated on the mega, the mega chain. Mega eth chain. But I think what we're doing as R and D in our ecosystem, we're hoping that we can give back to all of you, right. What we're doing on our sequencer. I hope we can empower everyone else as well.
00:33:06.560 - 00:33:43.100, Speaker B: So, like, it's really not a black and white difference as every single technology component can help each other, I think lastly, like, I love what you guys are doing on a consumer focus. I think I'd love to hear more about what your lesson learned in maybe optimizing the wallet experience. How do you empower people to buy off Ram crypto a lot more easily? How can I not use a spreadsheet to track my seed phrase and etcetera? And eventually, I think a lot of people here were just like make ethereum great again, right? We're all very much on the same mission.
00:33:43.960 - 00:33:55.520, Speaker A: Thank you so much. Everyone would love to meet back in a year and see where we are and see if our opinions have changed or whatnot, but it was really great. And thank you for all of your spicy takes and, yeah, thank you, the audience as well. Thanks.
