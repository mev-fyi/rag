00:00:02.970 - 00:00:03.582, Speaker A: All right.
00:00:03.716 - 00:00:24.998, Speaker B: Yeah. So welcome, everyone, to another Celestia community call. This is Celestia Community call number three. We have a lot of exciting updates for you. Let's go over the agenda for today. So for today's agenda, we're going to go over optimate and how to build sovereign rollup on Celestia. And then we're going to give an overview of the modular Fellows program.
00:00:24.998 - 00:01:15.646, Speaker B: Done. And we're going to highlight the translation efforts on Crowdden by our community members for both in french and mandarin translation, and a way for other people to join the efforts in translation after and like, instructions on how to do that. And then we're going to go over any kind of future updates you can expect from Celestia, both from developer and the finally, you know, with enough time, we'll have A-Q-A. The way Q A works is basically you just raise your hand, we'll unmute you, and then you can ask a question. Otherwise, if you're more comfortable, feel free to type down your message and we will answer it in the order we receive. All right, so let's get started. So let me try to find the southern roll ups.
00:01:15.646 - 00:02:04.290, Speaker B: So, as you can see here, we just announced like a few weeks ago an introduction to southern rollup to developers. And the way you can build a southern roll up. Currently on Celestia is with a tool called Optimate. And with Optim, it allows you to basically, it's a replacement with Cogmo SDK. It's like an ABCI wrapper with a replacement around tendermint to create roll ups on top of Celestia sovereign roll ups. And in this example, with Optim, we created two different tutorials, a wordle tutorial. So if you want to play the wordle game, an introduction to that, and it'll show you how to get started with Optimum and wordle.
00:02:04.290 - 00:02:46.020, Speaker B: The other tutorial we have is the Cosmosm overview. So Cosmosm is a webassembly execution environment to allow you to build, like rust smart contracts on top of Cosmod SDK application. And with this example, it allowed you to integrate Cosmosm directly into Optimus. So in other words, you'd be able to build Cosmosm smart contracts using Optim on top of Celestia. Now, I believe Thomas is here. Tomas, you want to give an overview of more in depth on Optimum and what people can do with this?
00:02:49.370 - 00:03:53.580, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. So first of all, as a disclaimer, optimist is very alpha or better stage right now. So we welcome all the bug reports or issues found because we're pretty sure that there are many issues that are just not discovered currently. Optimint allows you to create a roll up on top of celestia. There are many limitations right now because of the early stage of the project. So first of all, you can create a network with a single aggregator node. So there will be only one block producer, but you can have multiple full nodes that can sync with the and create an entire network to operate in your roll up.
00:03:53.580 - 00:04:33.922, Speaker C: Other than that, optimist is using implementing AbCI. It's integrated in the Cosmos SDK app, so it's almost seamless and you shouldn't see any difference except timing, which is related to the timing of the testnet right now. So except for the block times, you shouldn't see any important difference between using Cosmos SDK with optimint and using just plain vanilla Cosmos SDK apps.
00:04:33.986 - 00:04:34.600, Speaker B: So.
00:04:36.330 - 00:05:38.820, Speaker C: Optimint has its own p two p layer, so it propagates transactions on the PTP layer between the nodes. Then the transactions are passed to a mempool and the mempool in the latest release, it's prioritized. So we have something that was introduced for the short period of time in the latest tendermint. And yeah, I will welcome everyone to, I will encourage everyone to test it out and report any bugs or issues you can find. I'm also available. You can always mention me in dev discord and I will try to help.
00:05:41.210 - 00:06:01.340, Speaker B: Nice. Thank you Thomas for the update. We have a question from Mayo while we're on the topic of optimum. So Mayo is saying, are these chains fully customizable tokenization wise? If I create an optimum underlying chain, will I use the celestia token for gas user own or both?
00:06:02.670 - 00:07:01.642, Speaker C: So right now to be able to submit transactions to the VA layer. So to Celestia you need to have a node that is configured to pay for data. So as an aggregator, as a block producer, you need to be able to store your blocks in the data validity layer. So you need to have celestial tokens and on top of that, while you're creating your own roll up, your own, I would say chain, but it's a roll up. So it's like every other Cosmos SDK app. You will have your own token that you define. So you need tokens only for submission of the blocks.
00:07:01.642 - 00:07:11.250, Speaker C: So only the aggregator, only the block producer needs to use Celestia tokens.
00:07:14.790 - 00:07:45.958, Speaker B: Thank you also for everyone. Things to look forward to right now. Like Tomas was saying, it's still in Alpha stage. We have a couple of tutorials. One is a simple Cosmos SDK game that you can play. The other one is just a basic cosmosm tutorial, how to integrate it over time. We're going to have more Cosmos SDK tutorials for different things you can do with Cosmos SDK on optimant, and we're going to have more cosmosm specific tutorials.
00:07:45.958 - 00:08:30.050, Speaker B: And over time, after, things to look forward to. Like any kind of cool application that you see in Cosmos SDK will have over time, available tutorial on how to integrate it with Celestia using Optim. And this is only the beginning. There'll be more cool things happening with Optim after that, and we look forward to showing you a lot of them before we move ahead. Anyone has any more questions about Optim? No questions. You can always raise your hand or you can ask directly on the chat if you have questions. And if you don't have any questions now, we can come back to it later if you feel like it.
00:08:30.050 - 00:08:57.736, Speaker B: Okay. Now, moving ahead with the agenda, the next thing we want to talk about is the modular Fellows. And for that, I want to make sure that Nader, Nader, your co host, you should be able to unmute yourself whenever. So, yeah, Nader is going to cover the modular fellows program and what to expect in the program and stuff. Nader, all yours. Cool.
00:08:57.918 - 00:09:06.284, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you for the intro. And I have a little presentation that I'm going to give. Let me go ahead and try to share my screen.
00:09:06.482 - 00:09:10.510, Speaker B: Okay. Let me stop sharing and allow you to share. Okay, cool.
00:09:19.060 - 00:09:28.290, Speaker A: All right, so I'm going to try to share. Can everyone see?
00:09:28.980 - 00:09:29.840, Speaker B: Yep.
00:09:30.440 - 00:09:57.212, Speaker A: Okay, cool. Yeah, so, hello, everyone, and I'm natter. I work with Yaz developer relations. So I've been with Celestia a little over two months, and I've been working on a program along with Yaz and Nick and a few others who've been helping me out. And it's called modular Fellows. You might have seen us talking about this. We announced it officially a couple of weeks ago, and we just closed the application process, and I'm going to talk a little bit about it today.
00:09:57.212 - 00:11:15.728, Speaker A: So what is modular fellows? It's basically a program that we have put together to really kind of facilitate the building out of applications infrastructure protocols, as well as maybe additional improvements or not really improvements, but expanding the community of celestia. And it's kind of described as a program designed to empower modular builders with the right resources to build out the future of scalable and sovereign blockchain networks. This is a paragraph that I took out of kind of our announcement, but really it's just a program to kind of give a really good experience to developers that want to kind of start building out on Celestia now and giving them access to people within the community, a little bit of funding and stuff like that, to kind of maybe give them additional support where they might not have had it before. So the modular Fellows program is going to be a three month program, and we're going to be doing it probably in the future as well. So this is kind of like the first cohort, and we're thinking in the future we'll have more cohorts, but it lasts for three months, so the participants will receive engineering support and mentorship. I'm going to talk about what that looks like in just a moment. They also receive a monthly stipend of $3,000 per month to build out the project of their choice.
00:11:15.728 - 00:12:20.376, Speaker A: This $3,000 is meant really just to kind of facilitate people to where it gives them enough to maybe just get by and pay their bills and stuff. It's obviously not going to be enough money to maybe replace someone's full time, maybe salary or anything like that, but it's just hopefully there to kind of give them a little bit of boost and help and stuff like that. And after the program is over, they'll continue getting support through the celestia ecosystem and celestia community, as well as the team. And we're going to then hopefully help them land additional monetary support as well, in the form of fundraising and grants. So we have a couple of milestones that we'll be focusing on throughout the three month program. So at the end of every month, we'll basically have a milestone. So for the first month, it's essentially them kind of diving into celestia and trying to figure out what they want to build.
00:12:20.376 - 00:13:30.060, Speaker A: A lot of the people that are in the program already know what they want to build, but some people don't. So we want to kind of give people a little bit of extra time to kind of figure that out. At the end of month two, we are asking them to then present what their initial idea is, as well as a prototype for that idea. So at the end of the first month, they should have figured out the idea, and then the end of second month, hopefully built out a basic prototype, and then continuing in the third month, building out that prototype into some type of functional product, and also building out a blog post or a white paper or some type of documentation that we can then help share and kind of get people interested or excited about possibly investing or receiving a grant for the thing that they're building. So through this program, we are thinking that people will be able to kind of, like, foster and build out some of their ideas for crucial parts of the celestial ecosystem that we will hopefully see come out of it. So the first cohort, the applications, ended on August 27. We had around 390 total applicants.
00:13:30.060 - 00:14:38.788, Speaker A: A lot of very high quality applications came in from some of the top protocol engineers, developers, and founders from some really successful projects that are already currently in existence. So the quality and the number of applicants that came through definitely was beyond our expectation. So we're really excited about that. And the official start of this first cohort will be happening at the end of September, so in about a month. So between now and then, we basically are kind of like going through these applicants, interviewing a handful of them, and trying to kind of figure out who are going to be the first cohort, because it's quite a few applicants. And then after we figure that out, we're going to basically be setting up that timeline and getting communications out so everything kind of goes smoothly. The support that the modular fellows will be receiving, in addition to the monthly, I mean, the $3,000 a month, they'll also have a private telegram group for them to communicate with each other, as well as with a group of modular mentors, which I'll talk about in just a moment.
00:14:38.788 - 00:15:22.672, Speaker A: We'll also have a weekly office hours for them to attend and maybe be able to ask questions and bounce ideas off of each other and other celestial team members. And then in discord, they're going to be receiving a special role, and we're not sure exactly what we're going to be doing with that role. Obviously, it'll kind of give them a little bit of, I would say, standing out like, oh, I'm a modular fellow. It's pretty cool. But also, we decided to not create a separate group within discord, because I think a lot of the technical questions that are going to be asked through this program are going to be helpful to the community as a whole. So we don't want to kind of box those away from everyone else. We want that to be part of the main discussion.
00:15:22.672 - 00:16:29.864, Speaker A: So, like, a lot of people that are developers doing anything really at any protocol at this point, are using Discord almost as like a stack overflow or using Discord as like a GitHub or even a Google where you go in and you search for challenges that you had and hopefully find the answers to. So we're hoping that a lot of the discussions that happen in discord will be helpful to the community as a whole, and not just the modular fellows. The modular fellows will have access to a group of modular mentors. And these modular mentors are really experienced technical people, as well as founders and just people not only within Celestia, but outside of Celestia as well. So people like Zachie Mannian, Eric Wall, are really knowledgeable and experienced with a very great track record. And obviously, the people within Celestia, like Mustafa, John and Ismail, and Evan, are all also going to be helping out. So there isn't really, I would say, a better group of people that could be helping developers build on celestial other than this group.
00:16:29.864 - 00:17:22.520, Speaker A: So we're really happy to kind of have this group that's been put together and also kind of agreed to be part of the program. So once they're through with the program, we are then offering additional support after that, hopefully for the participants that kind of have built something that they want to continue working on and building. So that will be coming in. The type of support will be grants and funding, and then we'll also be having like an alumni network. So if someone wants to continue building out their idea, we can give them a grant or help them land a grant, or if they want to kind of found a protocol or a project and receive fundraising, we're going to also help facilitate that. So that's kind of it. And I will then now pass the screen share back to Yaz.
00:17:26.530 - 00:18:42.438, Speaker B: Thank you, Nader, for this awesome introduction to modular fellows. I'll let anyone, if you have any questions about modular fellows, you can always raise your hand or ask inside the chat room any of your questions, and we'll have it answered. And at the same time, at the end of the community call, we will have a dedicated Q and A. So we can always do that as well. All right, so let me go back to sharing screen. Let's see. Okay, so the other cool thing that is happening at the same time that we wanted to raise awareness for everyone is there's been a great community effort in translating the documentation currently in French and Mandarin, and this has been spearheaded by an awesome fellow core contributor, Gunter, and at the same time who's leading the french efforts and the whole structure of how translations kind of work effort.
00:18:42.438 - 00:19:41.660, Speaker B: And to support him, there's King, who's doing mandarin translations. So to give you an should let me just merge this pull request, but it's going to go live soon, but it will give you an idea of the documentation where you get started, you're going to find it here under community and docs translation. This is going to get updated right now because I just merged the pull request and the whole idea to get started with it is on Crowdin. So if you go back here, let me just get you the link. So there's a link for the crowd in here that you can see. I'm going to try to share that link as well here. So yeah, while it loads, I'll try to share it as well in the.
00:19:41.660 - 00:20:21.978, Speaker B: Yeah, thank you matthia translation activity. So as you can see, currently we have six languages and the Mandarin translation is at 45% completion, French is at 36% completion. They keep varying in terms of completion because as you can see, the documentation keeps getting updated from time to time. So that kind of changes the bar a bit. And we're also creating currently Matthia, I.
00:20:21.984 - 00:20:23.338, Speaker A: Don'T know if it's live yet, but.
00:20:23.424 - 00:21:07.350, Speaker B: On the Discord channel, on Discord server for Celestia, we're going to have a community translation channel. So if you're interested. Yeah, so we'll have it live soon. If you're interested in translation efforts, go on that channel once it's live and ask about how you can get started. Yeah, I mean, Igor, if you want to get started with Russian, reach out to Gunter on the community translation channel. I'll write down his username and he'll help you onboard, you get you started and stuff. Joining Crowdin as a member and understanding the structure and how to submit translations for your respective languages.
00:21:07.350 - 00:21:36.242, Speaker B: Soon we're going to merge it. All the different translations. We're doing it step by step. Currently we're going to merge what is already available in French and Chinese and soon after that the others kind of progress, they rely on community efforts. Yeah, thank you, Gunter. Feel free to reach out to him on Discord and he'll help you on. Yeah, definitely.
00:21:36.242 - 00:22:50.790, Speaker B: Talk to Ting if you want to help translate Mandarin. And it's great to see because you can see the community effort happening over on that. It's fun, like Gunter is saying, and you can see how people know there's so many people supporting and translating and for, yeah, I think they updated the UI as well here for the translation and yeah, I mean, Dimitro, if you want to do it for Ukrainian, we'd love to have ukrainian translations as so. Yeah, soon we can get started. You'll find a link here updated on community under Docs translation once it goes live, I think it'll be going live in a minute or so it hasn't been updated yet, but you'll find the updated link for how to join Crowdon here and just join the community translation channel on Discord and that will help you get on boarded. If you have any questions about that, feel free to ask. Otherwise we can move on to the next topic on the agenda.
00:22:50.790 - 00:23:38.710, Speaker B: And if you want to ask, you can ask in an overvoice, raise your hand so we can unmute you or ask directly on the chat. Otherwise we can move on to the next items. Anne is saying Eversake can help with the ukrainian translation. Love to see it. Please. It's a great community, you know, it's a great thing because you get to see different people translating different items on the documentation and soon, over time we can expand it to the celestia.org website and continue translation effort across our repos.
00:23:38.710 - 00:24:45.862, Speaker B: So on future updates for developers on the roadmap so one of the major updates, we haven't really announced it yet, but it's like it's a work in progress for the time being, is we're going to launch a Devnet, a developer network. There's not going to be any validator participation in this one because the focus of it is to continue having to have a network that is specifically focused for developers using the latest build from Celestia's core components. And we're going to have more updates on that within the coming weeks. And with that, we're also going to have a new kind of roll up that you can also get started to build on. And there'll be a lot of great content for developers to experiment with, whether with smart contract in either cosmosm or in EVM kind of smart contracts. And they'll all be connected to the new Devnet. And Mamaki, which is our existing testnet, will be continued to be used for anything related to validator operation.
00:24:45.862 - 00:25:43.440, Speaker B: At the same time, developers can continue building on Mamaki. And one thing to look forward in Mamaki, if you're a validator on Mamaki, is we're going to have a hard fork around October, and that hard fork will coordinate it with the validators on Mamaki. And that one will be the first upgrade that we're going to do on Mamaki. And that will open up a lot of doors in terms of what is possible on Mamati and allow you to build new kind of tools and sovereign roll ups and anything related to that. Other than that, I'm going to give the floor to the celestial app engineers if they want to talk about any exciting update for a developer to look forward to. Maybe I'll give it to Evan if Evan has any kind of updates on the hard work, what to expect and stuff. I don't want to put you on the spot, Evan, but if you want to talk about it.
00:25:47.570 - 00:26:00.610, Speaker D: Well, we should have an upcoming hard fork for Mamlaki in the beginning of October. This hard fork will be a little bit different if you're running a node than a normal hard fork.
00:26:01.830 - 00:26:03.574, Speaker C: It's not fully specked out yet, but.
00:26:03.612 - 00:26:30.698, Speaker D: Effectively the upgrade will involve just running a new node. So it's like you're taking some of the state of the old chain and moving it to a new chain, and that new chain, I think will be named something else other than Momaki. And then Momaki will actually, after that upgrade, assuming everything goes well, I think we'll actually shut down Momaki, but I'm.
00:26:30.714 - 00:26:42.258, Speaker B: Not 100% positive on that. Cool. Thanks for the update, Evan. Any other updates from the engineer that for people to look forward to on?
00:26:42.344 - 00:26:42.980, Speaker E: Maybe?
00:26:43.750 - 00:27:05.920, Speaker B: Whether it's QGB or Celestia core or Celestia node, now's the time if you guys want to talk about any cool things that are happening on the. Oh, let me make you co host glib. You can unmute yourself, I believe.
00:27:07.570 - 00:27:41.770, Speaker E: Okay, I'm just raising heads, so you see. Yeah, I just want to do a quick note that there will be a celestial node release very soon, so please take a look at it once it's done. It's like once this new Devnet that Yas mentioned is released, we will also have a new release of celestial node. So everyone are welcome to play around and enjoy it and run a full node which was not in the past release, but it will be in this one, and it will have a lot of feature improvements.
00:27:44.190 - 00:28:28.394, Speaker B: Thank you. Yeah, and this is kind of like our update so far. If anyone has any kind of questions, now's the time to ask, because now we're going to Q and A. So Mamati is actually a testnet. We classify Mamati as a testnet which is more focused on validator operations so that validator can participate in it and the new Devnet that we're focused on. There won't be any need for validator participation because the focus more is on continuous updates to the new Devnet. We don't have a name for it yet, but hopefully within the next few weeks we'll have an update on that and the documentation will be updated to reflect that.
00:28:28.394 - 00:29:48.560, Speaker B: So then you'll have two different networks as a developer. One is Mamaki which has like a unique set of validators, 150 validators, and you can build on that. And that one is going to go undergo a hard fork, like Evan said, early October. The other one is going to be a devnet with no external validator participation and with the aim of it to be focused more on developers building the latest roll up using the most up to date releases from all the different celestia components, whether Celestia core, celestia node, or Celestia app. So a question by DiMars, does Celestia support educational initiatives for non developers? Can you expand on, like, what do you like? Are you asking for educational initiative on how to become a developer on top of celestia or more related to how to interact with celestia? If you can expand on that, DiMars, we can wait for you to type. Yeah, just raise your hand so I can unmute you. You know how to raise your hand?
00:29:49.010 - 00:29:51.360, Speaker E: Or maybe I should just do it right here.
00:29:52.130 - 00:29:56.962, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay. Ask unmute. Okay. All right. Go ahead.
00:29:57.096 - 00:29:57.538, Speaker E: Hello.
00:29:57.624 - 00:29:58.370, Speaker B: Hear me?
00:29:58.520 - 00:30:27.482, Speaker F: Yes, thank you. What I mean by educational initiatives for non developers is more like explaining the concepts, because most people don't know about modular blockchains. They just know about blockchains, and sometimes they don't even know more about that. So, like educating people with articles or videos or meetups about what a modular blockchain is and how celestia works, but not on a developer level, but like at the conceptual level.
00:30:27.616 - 00:30:28.902, Speaker E: Do you know what I mean?
00:30:29.056 - 00:30:55.590, Speaker B: Yeah, totally. I think for that, we did speak about it. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, but we did speak about when we designed the modular fellows program that maybe future iteration of the modular fellows program can allow for non technical projects, but are more like educational stuff. But maybe you can help clarify that. Nada.
00:30:56.890 - 00:31:26.510, Speaker A: Yeah, that's correct. We're planning on in the future possibly doing more around that. But I think that our main focus right now is building out all of the applications and protocol level things that we need to allow developers to build stuff. And as people are building stuff, maybe we'll then try to expand on maybe broadening the funnel of people that we're bringing into the ecosystem to more non technical people.
00:31:26.580 - 00:31:27.870, Speaker B: I guess so.
00:31:27.940 - 00:31:55.640, Speaker G: I don't think DMAs is asking about modular fellows. I think he's just asking about educational initiatives in a. We do have a section on the website called Learn Modular, which I just linked you in the chat. So if you go to celestial.org learn, there's a bunch of art, there's like six articles on there targeted towards non developers to explain the basic concepts of mutual blockchains, which I would recommend checking out.
00:31:58.740 - 00:32:38.652, Speaker B: Thanks Mustafa. And also on our documentation page, let me show you guys, we have a section called concepts. And in it it goes deeper into how celestial work, but that is more like technical. But then you also have a link to the learn modular like that Mustafa is talking about and the glossary. So it's like external link that if you go, it will take you to the learn modular section and they have exactly what you're looking for in terms of explaining modular blockchain versus monolithic blockchain. So hopefully that clarifies it. A question by Eddie B, so we can plan ahead.
00:32:38.652 - 00:33:15.910, Speaker B: Are there special hardware consideration for validating on celestia, such as GPU, secure guard enclave? I think that's what it is. And HSM. So we do have a specification for how to run a node. If you go to validator node and hardware requirement, I'm going to link it to you here, Eddie, that will give you an idea on the hardware requirement for running a validator node on top of Mamati, of course. My pleasure. Can you put up the link on the non dev? Okay, Mustafa already did that. Let's go to the next question.
00:33:15.910 - 00:34:20.520, Speaker B: Yusin Lee, I have a question. I'm not a dev, and this is very broad. Will Celestia ultimately be compatible with all chain as a consensus data availability layer? So in a way, yes. Where if you think about all the other layer, one chain as like a settlement layer or an execution environment, then in theory, any of those chains as an execution environment, whether it's a chain that executes move smart contracts or EVM smart contracts or like the Solana smart contract, I forget their names. Ultimately they can plug into select separate data availability and that is kind of like the vision for us. Right? But whether those actual chain would migrate to use Celestia for data availability versus execution environment being available for developers to connect to the Celestia data availability are two separate things. But to answer your questions, it definitely would be able to be compatible.
00:34:20.520 - 00:34:38.210, Speaker B: Yes. Next question by Rod Beiruti. I know Rod from university. Out of interest, from what you've seen so far from the modular fellows application, what types of project are engineered interested in building so far? So that is a question for Nader. Nader, you want to answer that one?
00:34:38.740 - 00:34:39.104, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:34:39.142 - 00:35:33.520, Speaker A: So we've seen really a lot of different types. So we've seen protocol engineers, people that have actually helped build out other existing protocols that are being used today and successful some of the ideas have to do with things like indexing. So indexing is an unsolved problem. And there also doesn't really exist an indexing solution for Celestia. We've seen people that have proposed building various types of execution environments so that one of the things that we want to happen is to have different execution environments. So seeing a lot of those types of proposals coming in was really great. We have people that want to build out, I would say, like almost similar products to what are already existing on other protocols.
00:35:33.520 - 00:36:36.150, Speaker A: So things like DeFi protocols and maybe NFt types of smart contracts and stuff have been proposed. People have proposed building out sdks and tooling for Celestia, improvements around how developers might deploy and build, and kind of like the whole lifecycle of maybe a sovereign roll up. So some of those ideas have come through. There's been really all types of types of ideas. Gaming has been one that I've seen a handful of times. In fact, we have someone that has a very successful track record in gaming that is submitted to be part of the program that I can't really probably obviously say their identity until we kind of decided on who's going to be admitted, but really successful protocol developer of a web three game is probably going to be part of the program. So, yeah, I mean, a very wide variety of people.
00:36:38.200 - 00:37:07.520, Speaker B: Cool. Thank you, Nedder. Hopefully, Rod, that answers your question. I'm going to allow people a few more minutes if you want to ask more questions. Otherwise we can close down the community call earlier if there's no more questions. Maybe in the meantime we can. So a question by HC.
00:37:07.520 - 00:37:19.110, Speaker B: Can someone please explain how layer two will benefit from data availability and Celestia that are not currently supported by layer ones like Eth? Anyone wants to take that question?
00:37:31.690 - 00:37:56.160, Speaker G: Let me just read it again how l two da. Yeah, I don't really, I don't fully understand the question. L two s that aren't currently supported by l ones like Eth. Maybe you can clarify the question. Makes sense to me.
00:37:57.330 - 00:38:16.064, Speaker B: Yeah, I'll try to clarify with HC. Yeah. Please raise your hand and we'll unmute you just so we can find you. Okay, now you should be able to unmute yourself. Yeah.
00:38:16.102 - 00:38:43.830, Speaker H: Hey, thanks for allowing me to ask questions. I'm totally a newbie and non developer, so maybe I'm asking probably the wrong question. But my understanding from reading some of this stuff, and it's very preliminary, is that Celestia offers data availability and there's some benefits, especially with regards to having light nodes or non fully nodes. But I'm just trying to understand, as you guys are positioning yourself as.
00:38:46.440 - 00:38:46.804, Speaker E: That.
00:38:46.842 - 00:39:16.084, Speaker H: Lay here for, say, the l two s, why would they want to come over to Celestia? What are the benefits that you guys offer that, say, ethereum isn't already offering them? And I was under the assumption that Ethereum is not offering data availability, but obviously optimism and arbitrum, they're working, they're running. What would be the benefit for them to come over to Celestia? Does that question make sense?
00:39:16.122 - 00:39:34.150, Speaker G: Well, the main immediate benefit is higher. Their three port. Ethereum does offer data availability, but the three port is basically like 10 block right now until EIP 1559. So, like, arbitram can still only do very few transactions per second before the transaction fees go very high.
00:39:34.600 - 00:39:38.268, Speaker H: But 1559 is already launch. It's been out there for a while.
00:39:38.354 - 00:39:40.030, Speaker G: Sorry, I mean, the other.
00:39:44.560 - 00:39:54.370, Speaker H: Is that the dank chart? Okay, got it. Okay, so you're saying that basically, but then once that thing gets launched, then what is the advantage of Celestia over Ethereum at that point?
00:39:55.300 - 00:40:29.870, Speaker G: Well, we still want to have greater data report than that EIP as well. But also more generally, Celestia is a specialized data layer, which means we only do data, we don't do settlement or computation, which means that we don't have the baggage evm, which means we can kind of specialize more on that. And that means we're more of a credibility neutral and overhead minimize the a layer for sovereign roll ups as well, which is something that we are trying to kind of push and cater to.
00:40:30.240 - 00:40:41.680, Speaker H: So, no, I appreciate that part of it. Do you mind explaining how does the lack of throughput relates to how Ethereum does currently? Does data availability versus how you guys do data availability?
00:40:44.020 - 00:41:13.080, Speaker G: Well, I mean, the main reason right now is because Ethereum kind of couples the pricing for gas and data right now, which means you have this concept of gas on Ethereum, and there's no separate fee markets for data and computation right now because applications are on Ethereum right now. Technically, there's on average, about 10 actual call data space on Ethereum, if I remember correctly.
00:41:13.580 - 00:41:14.570, Speaker H: Got it.
00:41:14.940 - 00:41:31.250, Speaker G: Because we don't do computation, nodes only do data availability. The entire block is dedicated to data availability. And then, plus we also use techniques like data availability sampling to allow us to use KL data throughput without sacrificing security.
00:41:32.180 - 00:41:43.040, Speaker H: Got it. Okay, got it. And then what's the relative comparison in terms of advantage that you guys have once ethereum onto the dank sharding?
00:41:44.660 - 00:42:06.932, Speaker G: The main advantage is, well, first of all, we still want higher the FP put than the end goal of dank sharding, which is dank sharding aims to have 16 megabytes per block. We want to have higher than that, like 100 megabytes per block. And secondly, there's still the fact that because we don't have an enshrined computation layer, we're more neutral and overhead minimize the a layer for southern roll ups.
00:42:07.076 - 00:42:37.670, Speaker H: Got it. It certainly makes sense. I mean, obviously as pretty much all the industries across the tech sphere as they go through maturity cycles, specialization becomes more prevalent to remove the bottlenecks. But you said earlier that you said that once tank charting shows up for ethereum, it's 16 or 60. I'm just trying to understand the 16. Okay, so you're still a lot more relatively factors of like six times more than their capability is.
00:42:38.440 - 00:42:40.692, Speaker G: Yeah, that's the kind of angle of already.
00:42:40.746 - 00:42:41.700, Speaker B: Okay, got it.
00:42:41.770 - 00:42:44.470, Speaker H: Thanks very much for taking my question. Really appreciate it.
00:42:47.080 - 00:43:33.700, Speaker B: Thank you for asking that question. Great conversation so far. Another question by Eddie B. I don't know if it's a question or comment, but I'm going to read it out anyways. If the encryption used by the chain is not supported by an HSM such as BLS SGX, then it is not up to the operator and Horcrux might not be usable for a selector without major overhaul. Since it uses celestial core instead of tendermint, it's all good. Does anyone want to comment on that? Because I don't think I have context on whether Horcrux might not be usable for selected without a major overhaul since it uses celestial core instead of tendermint.
00:43:37.480 - 00:43:50.540, Speaker D: You can at least comment on that. Our changes to tendermint are very minimal and we use the same keys like the same key type, so you should be able to use floorcuts.
00:43:51.360 - 00:43:54.300, Speaker B: Okay, hope that clarifies Eddie.
00:44:00.050 - 00:44:00.606, Speaker E: Nice.
00:44:00.708 - 00:45:05.670, Speaker B: Okay, cool. Okay, another question by Rod. How would celestia work from non custodial wallet perspective? Would the wallet need to support celestia somehow, or would the wallet just need to support the execution chain and act as a light node to the data availability sampling celestia so I can take a crack at it and maybe the rest of the team can answer. So on the celestia data availability side, like the data availability layer, you still have non custodial wallets because on the celestia network you combine both the validator set with the data availability layer. So you do have non custodial wallets that you can generate, but that only is for validators to order transactions. You pay for block space and that is the function of the celestia specific non custodial wallet. On the settlement layered or execution change, they would have separate wallets and each one would be separate and specified by each sovereign roll up or settlement layer.
00:45:05.670 - 00:46:36.774, Speaker B: I'll give the floor for anyone else to add on it or help clarify it more. Okay, any more question anyone? Okay, so question by Michael probe because there are three layers to complete an entire functional blockchain, how do new dev build on Celestia? That is a great question. So as a new developer, it depends on what part of the layer you care about. Now in web three, a lot of people focus on the application layer, like just building decentralized application on top of their favorite smart contract execution environment, predominantly right now is EVM, where Ethereum is a dominant chain for EVM specific smart contracts. So if that is your focus, then all you care about is building on top of that settlement layer and the settlement layer itself will connect to the data availability layer on its own. But you as an application developer, you don't have to necessarily worry about that because maybe you're building on a layer two roll up, like an optimism or arbitrary specific roll up that kind of connects directly to a settlement layer on celestia that also plugged into the data availability layer. So you as an application developer, that's what you care about.
00:46:36.774 - 00:47:59.358, Speaker B: You don't have to care about the underlying layers because that is handled by the other layers themselves. But if you want to build a sovereign layer, like a sovereign roll up that connects directly to the data availability layer, then you'd have to spin up your own sovereign roll up yourself and then build that specific kind of application specific components of it. And that is more like if you're building a cosmos SDK chain as a sovereign roll up, then you would have to both create worry about spinning up that network and building those components at the same time, plugging it into the Celestia data availability layer so that you can submit transactions for blocks to be submitted to the data availability layer. So because it's so modular, you have so many different approaches that you can take depending on what is available to you as a toolkit. So to summarize the answer, it depends on where your focus is. And if your focus is lower on the data on the lowest level, like building maybe API or developer tooling for celestial data availability layer, then you can just interact with that layer. If you care more about spinning up your own layer two roll up on top of an existing sediment layer.
00:47:59.358 - 00:48:37.130, Speaker B: That could be your focus and you don't have to worry about the other components. Or if you just want to build an application on top of an optimism or arbitrary type of roll up that connect to Celestia, then that would be your focus. Like you wouldn't have to worry about the other underlying. Actually, let me go in order, Michael. I hope that answered the question. Let me know if it doesn't for everyone that wants to learn more about. Okay, HC is the cosmodestic, the only template for the sovereign roll up? At the moment, yes, but that doesn't mean that's going to be the only template.
00:48:37.130 - 00:49:07.030, Speaker B: So this is just the one that we have integrated so far. So if you go here to optimin, it's just like with Optim, it's just an ABCI wrapper and currently the ABCI wrapper is around Cosmos SDK. But you can build an ABCI wrapper for any other kind of execution environments. So it's not limited to Cosmos SDK. But that's like for the first version because it's super Alpha and Alpha stays optimist. We just have it right now for Cosmos SDK. But you're not limited to Cosmos SDK.
00:49:08.090 - 00:49:36.542, Speaker C: Okay, I would like to add some things. First of all, you can use ABCI without Cosmos SDK. It's possible. So you are not limited to Cosmos SDK. That's the first thing. And second thing is in the future, maybe not near future, but in the future we plan to make optimint more agnostic. So right now we're only providing ABCI interface.
00:49:36.542 - 00:50:24.420, Speaker C: But in the future we would like to provide other interface so you can integrate different execution layers directly with optimint or use optimint as more like a library for your roll up. So this is the plan for the future, but right now this is how you build your sovereign roll up on top of Celestia. And of course you can always use Celestia node API directly and try to create something from scratch. So this is the hardest way.
00:50:26.230 - 00:50:59.606, Speaker B: Thank you. Another question by HC is what is ABCI interface? So ABCI stand for application blockchain interface. I think there should be like, I can try to pull up a link for you. Blockchain interface. Yeah. And here's maybe some reading on. Yeah, thanks, Evan and Josh.
00:50:59.606 - 00:51:32.550, Speaker B: I want to miss on anyone and let me go back to the community, see if the new link is updated. Okay. It's perfect. So Gunter's new link is updated. So here's just for link for the translation. You can see the crowd in project link here and everything else explaining how do you get onboarded onto the documentation translation. So check it out, let us know what you think.
00:51:32.550 - 00:52:07.620, Speaker B: If you want to participate in translation, hang out on discord, go to the community translation channel, reach out to Gunter and he'll help onboard you for whatever language that you're interested in. With that, we got six minutes left. There's been a great amount of questions being asked. I'll give you guys another opportunity if you want to ask more questions. Otherwise we can end it earlier. HC? Go ahead, you can unmute now.
00:52:08.230 - 00:53:08.790, Speaker H: Hey, sorry, I don't want to dominate too many questions, but since no one else is asking, I was just curious. Obviously from a total newbies perspective, you guys are making a much more efficient blockchain and obviously with reduced costs and better features or whatnot. But at the end of the day, if I was out there developing an application, I want to go where there are many users and many other applications that could potentially develop from a composite. Just take advantage of composabilities and whatnot. And obviously that's still going to be Ethereum in that world. What's your plan in terms of getting that adoption, the kink in the adoption curve? Because I can go out there and develop an application, but no one's going to come to my chain or sovereign chain or whatever it may be. But if I develop on ethereum, obviously there are already many users and many other apps that may want to be trying to be composable to my app or whatnot, what's your thinking on that? What's your strategy?
00:53:10.810 - 00:53:59.298, Speaker B: I can take a crack at it, but I think I might also have other input. So one cool project that the team is working on is called the quantum gravity bridge. So if you follow the thesis that you're describing, that majority of the users are on Ethereum, right? Or maybe on different roll ups on top of Ethereum. Then with the quantum gravity bridge as an approach, you as a roll up with a lot of users can still settle on Ethereum but get data availability from Celestia. Because again, Celestia is just a data availability network and settlement layer, can integrate with it or not, or roll up, can use celestia or not. And I can try to get you a link to that. But that is one approach because Celestia followed that modular structure and architecture.
00:53:59.298 - 00:54:05.030, Speaker B: The quantum gravity bridge is one approach for that. And with a thing that we call celestiums.
00:54:07.770 - 00:54:30.880, Speaker H: Because I'm still using Ethereum, won't that also won't I continue to incur Ethereum costs? I mean, obviously there's a lot of traffic and users and whatnot, but what is the savings in that case? Or is there some kind of a carve out where by using celestia, my total cost, that total cost being paid on Ethereum is much less. And there's a net savings or net benefit in that case.
00:54:34.610 - 00:54:36.740, Speaker B: Evan, you want to answer that question?
00:54:38.070 - 00:54:39.138, Speaker C: Yeah, sure.
00:54:39.304 - 00:54:41.058, Speaker B: We do have a blog post on.
00:54:41.064 - 00:54:57.670, Speaker D: This that I think goes into a lot more details that would answer a lot of these questions, probably like a lot better than I could hear. But yeah, the cost savings come from data availability costs and from Celestia being a very scalable data availability layer.
00:55:00.190 - 00:55:01.260, Speaker H: Is it possible?
00:55:04.590 - 00:55:05.290, Speaker D: Go ahead.
00:55:05.360 - 00:55:15.134, Speaker H: Sorry, no, sorry. Can you please submit the link or publish the link for that blog post?
00:55:15.252 - 00:55:16.720, Speaker D: Yeah, sure, I'll post.
00:55:28.130 - 00:55:30.640, Speaker B: It. Okay, thanks.
00:55:31.410 - 00:55:32.400, Speaker H: Thank you.
00:55:35.890 - 00:57:10.400, Speaker C: I also want to add that, yeah, there is a lot of users in Ethereum world, but there's also a lot of users in entire, I would say, cosmos SDK ecosystem. And because of the IBC inter blockchain communication, you can gather a lot of users. There are lots of great app specific chains and you can easily communicate between them and send tokens between them because of the IBC. And once you will have your sovereign roll up IBC compatible, you will be accessible for all of those users. And this is also a huge impact, I would say, because it will enable creating, it will give the easier, I would say, onboarding experience. If you can, for example, go to osmosis and swap your token or to some specific token and then send it, or use another decks in the IBC world and then go straight to your specific roll up, it would be super nice.
00:57:11.970 - 00:57:50.700, Speaker D: Yeah, there's also like, again, we talk about some of this stuff on our blog, but Celestia is very much made for a lot of things, just data availability in general, but also sovereign rollups, which if you want to use a smart contract in a settlement layer, then that's cool. But there are benefits to sovereign rollups that you can't get any other way. And like you can't use a settlement layer. So if your project wants those benefits, then there really isn't another option.
00:57:55.150 - 00:58:39.114, Speaker B: Okay, I just want to be mindful that we're currently at time and I want to end this call. HC, if you're available on Discord, join our discord. Like the team also is available there. If you want to ask questions, whether in general or developers, we're happy to answer, continue the conversation if you have more questions. And, yeah, thank you so much for your question and thank you everyone for your time and for attending the call. And we're going to have another Celestia community call in the future to talk about any future updates that we have and be on the lookout for new cool things that we're going to release and for developers and things that you can play around with. And yeah, thank you so much.
00:58:39.114 - 00:58:47.190, Speaker B: I'm going to stop sharing the screen now and I'm going to end the recording. Take care, everyone. Bye.
