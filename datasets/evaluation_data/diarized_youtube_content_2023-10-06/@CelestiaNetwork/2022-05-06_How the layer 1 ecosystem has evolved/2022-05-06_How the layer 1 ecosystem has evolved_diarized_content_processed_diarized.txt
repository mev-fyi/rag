00:00:00.170 - 00:00:09.566, Speaker A: Um, there was a period back in 2017, 2018 when there was a lot.
00:00:09.588 - 00:00:12.046, Speaker B: Of new layer one projects that kind.
00:00:12.068 - 00:00:16.218, Speaker A: Of raised big rounds, like avalanche, Lana.
00:00:16.314 - 00:00:29.480, Speaker B: Near protocol, and so on and so forth. And a lot of them are kind of based around a similar premise, which is Ethereum, but more scalable, or like a more scalable shared smart contract platform.
00:00:31.050 - 00:00:33.878, Speaker A: In the sense that you have a.
00:00:33.884 - 00:00:46.886, Speaker B: Synchronous execution environment where all transactions kind of run within this world computer model that Ethereum has kind of proposed in 2014.
00:00:46.998 - 00:00:49.740, Speaker A: Like where there's this world Internet computer.
00:00:50.110 - 00:00:52.190, Speaker B: Where all transactions are processed.
00:00:52.770 - 00:00:53.998, Speaker A: But now we've kind of seen the.
00:00:54.004 - 00:01:09.700, Speaker B: Results of that play out. We can see 2022 that does not really work. You just cannot have a single synchronous world computer chain as a shared smart contract platform.
00:01:10.550 - 00:01:13.758, Speaker A: You've seen issues with Avalanche and Solana.
00:01:13.774 - 00:01:21.670, Speaker B: And binance chain all struggling to cope with demand, even though they claim to be more scalable than Ethereum.
00:01:22.170 - 00:01:23.666, Speaker A: So I think the biggest shift we're.
00:01:23.698 - 00:01:27.560, Speaker B: Seeing now is this idea of a multi chain world.
00:01:31.150 - 00:01:32.698, Speaker A: It's no longer a paradigm where the.
00:01:32.704 - 00:01:36.730, Speaker B: Single blockchain that can synchronously process all transactions.
00:01:37.710 - 00:01:39.626, Speaker A: Now people are realizing that actually you.
00:01:39.648 - 00:01:44.746, Speaker B: Have to have a multi chain world. And that's similar to the, that's effectively.
00:01:44.778 - 00:01:48.446, Speaker A: The cosmos vision that was kind of.
00:01:48.468 - 00:01:53.198, Speaker B: Introduced a few years ago. And Ethereum is also taking this approach.
00:01:53.294 - 00:01:58.562, Speaker A: Because roll ups themselves are basically an.
00:01:58.696 - 00:02:02.370, Speaker B: Implementation of a multi chain world, because roll ups themselves are chains.
00:02:02.710 - 00:02:08.174, Speaker A: So effectively, Ethereum is heading towards this direction as well, where all the execution.
00:02:08.222 - 00:02:10.502, Speaker B: Happens on roll up chains that connect.
00:02:10.556 - 00:02:20.638, Speaker A: To the Ethereum main chain as a kind of hub. So I would say that's kind of the biggest shift, like this shift between a single world computer model to a mini computer model where you have multi.
00:02:20.674 - 00:02:37.002, Speaker B: Chain world where the chains communicate with each other. But obviously there is no perfect solution. All scalability solutions have trade offs. And the biggest trade off of this.
00:02:37.056 - 00:02:40.046, Speaker A: Multi chain ecosystem paradigm, where everything is.
00:02:40.068 - 00:02:47.650, Speaker B: A roll up and all the execution happens off chain, is this kind of issue of composability.
00:02:48.870 - 00:02:55.762, Speaker A: The great thing about this world computer model where just run all your transactions on Solana is that you have synchronous.
00:02:55.906 - 00:03:01.510, Speaker B: Composability and you can just write a smart contract that calls any other smart contract.
00:03:03.050 - 00:03:05.286, Speaker A: But with this multi chain model, even.
00:03:05.308 - 00:03:07.846, Speaker B: Though it's theoretically more scalable, the main.
00:03:07.868 - 00:03:09.334, Speaker A: Drawback of it is that it makes.
00:03:09.372 - 00:03:16.630, Speaker B: Composability more complicated, not impossible, or not too difficult, but more complicated, and more tooling is required.
00:03:18.090 - 00:03:22.026, Speaker A: For example, IBC was only launched somewhat.
00:03:22.058 - 00:03:25.342, Speaker B: Recently, and only people are realizing that.
00:03:25.476 - 00:03:30.666, Speaker A: For those of you that don't know, IBC is Cosmos's interchange protocol, and we're.
00:03:30.698 - 00:03:34.300, Speaker B: Only kind of starting to see that flesh out and see the potential of that.
