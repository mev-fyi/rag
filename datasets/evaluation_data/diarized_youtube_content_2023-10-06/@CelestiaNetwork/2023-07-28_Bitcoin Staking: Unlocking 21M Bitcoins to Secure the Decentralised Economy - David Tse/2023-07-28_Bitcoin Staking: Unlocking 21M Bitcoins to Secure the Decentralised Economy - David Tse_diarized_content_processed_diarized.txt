00:00:00.490 - 00:00:23.150, Speaker A: Thank you very much. Always good to be introduced by an astronaut. Gives me some special status here. Thank you. Thank you. Great. All right, so today I'm going to talk about this new protocol that we just designed in the past few months and currently building right now.
00:00:23.150 - 00:01:02.270, Speaker A: So, yeah, so, bitcoin, staking. All right, so let's first understand, what's the problem we're trying to address here. Okay. The problem we're trying to address is the proof of stick security. By definition, proof of stake means that the security is staked, protected by capital, and therefore capital intensive. So, right now, many of these chains are paying pretty high reward for staking, ranging from 5% on ethereum to 20, 40% on a cosmos chain. So this is very expensive.
00:01:02.270 - 00:01:49.022, Speaker A: And right now, this cost is paid by, basically inflation of the coin. So inflation is not good. You don't want to inflate the coin until it's necessary. There's also a pretty big competition between the utility of the coin and the security. And so we would like to reduce this tension and reduce the cost of capital in general. Okay, so that's the problem trying to solve, and the way we try to solve this problem is to recognize that outside this proof of stake world, there is another world in the crypto land, which is basically bitcoin. So proof of stake has slightly less than 50% of the market cap.
00:01:49.022 - 00:02:24.858, Speaker A: Bitcoin has slightly more than 50% of the market cap. So the observation here is that bitcoin can be a source of capital for staking. So let's think about why it is a good source of capital for staking. Okay? Everyone has some bitcoins, all right? But most of them has next to zero yield. So most of bitcoin is actually idle. So idle bitcoin means that these bitcoin are. You are not competing, like, for example, ethereum for yield, for defi, for example.
00:02:24.858 - 00:03:08.370, Speaker A: So providing a staking option for them could be attractive. All right? Number two is that the bitcoin holders in general are quite decentralized, at least more decentralized compared to many proof of stake chains. So by providing bitcoin as a staking asset, that would also help to decentralize your network. Three, bitcoin, relatively, is the least volatile asset within the crypto market. And we have done some study on that. The volatility of bitcoin is less than half of many assets. So if you combine the three together, you can think of bitcoin as actually a pretty excellent staking asset.
00:03:08.370 - 00:03:35.486, Speaker A: Staking asset. So our idea was to use this bitcoin asset. 600 billion worth of sticking asset potentially to secure all the proof of stake chains in the world. Okay. All right, let's think about this a little bit more. Right? Let's step back and think about this. So, bitcoin, from bitcoin, you provide security to proof of stake chain.
00:03:35.486 - 00:04:15.566, Speaker A: In return, bitcoin holders can get yield from these chains. Now, these chains are already providing yield, but they're providing very high yield to attract native token to have a large supply of bitcoin and a relatively stable market value is a good source of capital for these chains. So that is the assumption. That is the problem we're trying to solve. Okay. All right. So why is this not a trivial problem? Okay, so far, this is the setup of the problem.
00:04:15.566 - 00:04:55.926, Speaker A: Our goal is to use bitcoin to secure proof of stake chain. So what do we call this concept? So we are, in some sense, inventing a new concept here, and this new concept we called bitcoin staking. Okay, so if you look at this concept, it's kind of a weird concept. Weird name, right? Because bitcoin, everyone associate with proof of work. Staking, of course, is a natural key concept in proof of stake. How can we put these two words together? It doesn't make sense, right? But actually it does make sense, because bitcoin, although is a proof of work chain, it is still an asset. It is still an asset.
00:04:55.926 - 00:05:23.730, Speaker A: It's still a crypto asset. And we're saying we're using this very secure crypto asset secured by proof of work to secure proof of sticking or to add security. Proof of sticking. So bitcoin sticking. Okay, so anyone have any question about this concept? All right. Okay, man, I do sound like a professor or something like that. It's like habit.
00:05:23.730 - 00:05:29.480, Speaker A: It's hard to break habit. Oh, there's a question. All right, thank you very much. Thank you very much. Okay.
00:05:30.570 - 00:05:40.690, Speaker B: Using a bitcoin to secure a network compared to using any USDT. USDT. If it's not related to native staking at all, it's just a money bond.
00:05:40.770 - 00:05:45.434, Speaker A: For you to not make mistakes. Yeah, but of course it's a collateral, right?
00:05:45.552 - 00:05:46.826, Speaker B: Yeah, I think what I'm trying to.
00:05:46.848 - 00:05:50.762, Speaker A: Say is, yes, maybe someone else can come up with that idea.
00:05:50.816 - 00:05:51.606, Speaker B: Yeah, what I'm trying to say.
00:05:51.648 - 00:05:53.306, Speaker A: But our idea is focused on bitcoin.
00:05:53.418 - 00:06:09.022, Speaker B: Yeah, that's fine. I'm just saying it's a POW coin, right? So if you use that to provide security to a pos chain, then it's the same as any other asset to secure those pos chain.
00:06:09.086 - 00:06:13.794, Speaker A: It's a crypto asset, though. Yeah, but it's also an asset in which a lot of people wants to hold.
00:06:13.912 - 00:06:14.530, Speaker B: That's true.
00:06:14.600 - 00:06:37.094, Speaker A: Right. So what we're saying is this. One way of thinking about this is this. Suppose you are a person and your choice is the following. Okay, you want to buy some altcoin and earn altcoin yield, or this is now giving you an option. You can buy bitcoin and get out coin yield. Okay, so that's a pretty, I think, interesting concept.
00:06:37.094 - 00:06:50.240, Speaker A: Right. Because then you can reduce your volatility of your principal, but still get some upside on the yield. Okay, so that's the setup. Good. Thank you very much. Yeah. Any more questions? Okay, good.
00:06:50.240 - 00:07:00.322, Speaker A: Actually, because the USDC is permission, so I don't think it may work well, but permissionless asset should work.
00:07:00.376 - 00:07:01.234, Speaker B: You're right.
00:07:01.432 - 00:07:11.798, Speaker A: Good. Thank you. See, the trick of a good professor is to get the student answer each other questions. That's the challenge. Yeah. Okay, thank you. All right.
00:07:11.798 - 00:07:36.762, Speaker A: Okay, so now we shift a little bit more to the technology. Right. So this is the problem we're trying to solve. So why is this problem challenging? Well, it is basically a two sided market. Right. We have bitcoin holders on the left hand side and proof of stake chains on the right hand side. So on the left hand side, we want to make sure that this is a very secure experience for them because bitcoin holders are very conservative.
00:07:36.762 - 00:07:59.202, Speaker A: They don't want to lose the bitcoin. So this protocol should protect the BTC stakers holders very strongly. Okay. On the other hand, for the proof of stake chain, they want to get security from the bitcoin. In particular, they want it to be a true security so that in case there's anything bad happens, then they can slash the bitcoin stakers. Okay. So the slashing, therefore, has to be very sharp.
00:07:59.202 - 00:08:35.182, Speaker A: It is only under bad behavior of the validator would that slashing occur, and not under any other circumstances. Okay. All right, so this is the problem that we solved. So we came up with a protocol, a bitcoin sticking protocol, which essentially solves this dual objective of protecting both sides of the market. All right. Now, the biggest challenge, actually to achieve this is the fact that bitcoin doesn't have a smart contract. Okay? So I'll come back to this point a little bit later, but the constraint is that there are no smart contract bitcoin.
00:08:35.182 - 00:09:16.094, Speaker A: Okay. Now, what we can achieve is full security. So full slashing. So in other words, validators do bad things. We can slash the bitcoin. And number two is we can do trustless staking, which means that there is no bridging, no bridging of the bitcoin from the bitcoin chain to the proof of stake chain through custodial or otherwise, okay? Through a centralized custodial or otherwise, okay? So let's think about these two objectives, these two properties that we achieve. The first one is to provide full security to bitcoin chain, right? That's the right side of the market.
00:09:16.094 - 00:09:54.854, Speaker A: The second one is to provide full protection to the bitcoin holders. That's the second one. Now, if you relax one of them, for example, if you bridge the bitcoin from the bitcoin chain to the proof of stake chain through some wrap asset like Wrap BTC, then it's quite easy to achieve full security because now your token is as though it's sitting on the proof of stake chain, your smart contract proof of stake chain, you can do all the slashing you want. Okay? Now however, we don't want to bridge, so the bitcoin stays on the bitcoin chain. But we don't have a smart contract on bitcoin chain to do the slashing. So thereby, that's the challenge of the problem. And in fact, that is kind of cutting to the heart of why so many bitcoins are idle.
00:09:54.854 - 00:10:25.890, Speaker A: So many bitcoins are idle precisely because there is no smart contract, no intelligence on the smart contract chain. So it's very hard to securely bridge the money away and get it back. Okay. All right, so what we're saying is that for this particular use case of providing security, very important use case, I think there's no bridging needed. Okay, so how do we do this? So let's run through experience from a staker. So Alice has one bitcoin. What alice do is assigns a contract, a staking contract, a staking contract on the bitcoin chain.
00:10:25.890 - 00:10:56.298, Speaker A: Bitcoin doesn't have smart contract, but it does have a scripting language which allows you to write some very simple contract. So in this simple contract, there are two possible ways of spending this bitcoin. Either Alice can withdraw this bitcoin and claim back the bitcoin in say, three days. Okay, this is standard unbonding with some delay. Okay. Second, Alice will burn the BTC into a burn address. Okay, so these are the only two ways of spending this bitcoin, both of which are controlled by Alice.
00:10:56.298 - 00:11:15.540, Speaker A: Both of which are controlled by Alice. So this is self custodial contract, no third party. Yeah, exactly. Why would Alice burn his own money? Right, her own money? That doesn't make sense at all. This option is needed though, because we needed to have an option of slashing Alice. This is where the second option is.
00:11:15.910 - 00:11:18.682, Speaker C: Why would Alice call the slashing?
00:11:18.846 - 00:11:49.120, Speaker A: Yeah, so wait 1 minute. All right, good question though. All right, so Alice, after signing this contract, can now validate approval of stick chain. Okay, so Alice, to tie the two system together, Alice will use the same key that control the address, that controls the BTC address. To sign blocks. To sign blocks on the proof of stake chain. Okay, I'll tell you a little bit more about how the signing is done, but right now we're using the same key.
00:11:49.120 - 00:12:24.310, Speaker A: In the happy pass, Alice will be behaving honestly, honestly, and will continue validating blocks on the proof of stake chain. And the money will stay on the bitcoin chain until Alice wants to resign or wants to withdraw the money. And after a few days, Alice will claim back the stake and obtain the reward. Good. This is a happy path. Now, in the unhappy path, in the unhappy path, Alice will turn evil and now tries to do something bad on the proof of stake chain. The worst thing you can do, proof of stake chain is to create a fork on the proof of stake chain.
00:12:24.310 - 00:13:12.698, Speaker A: Okay, now this is a slashable offense, creating a fork. In fact, it's one of the very few slashable offense to protect the safety of the chain. So what we can do using cryptography, is that using a special modification of Alice signature, what we can do is to force Alice key Alice private key to be leaked, to be leaked. This enables anybody to send a transaction back to the proof of stake chain, to Alice, okay, to slash Alice. Now how do I go back? Do I go back here? I don't know how to go back. Maybe here, I don't know. Okay, go back.
00:13:12.698 - 00:13:42.274, Speaker A: All right. Okay, so now anybody can activate, can pretend to be Alice and activate the second path. So this answers the question of why Alice will ever burn the pc, because it has done something bad. And that something bad will force the review of the private key which will automatically enable anybody to slash this money. Okay, so this allows slashing to happen. Very good. So that's basically the key design.
00:13:42.274 - 00:14:28.862, Speaker A: We have some extra additional complexities protocol. For example, we would like to allow a fast unbonding of the stake BDC to ensure that the bitcoin holders can maintain high liquidity. This is achieved by providing some kind of synchronization between the bitcoin chain and a proof of stake chain, like cosmos, like osmosis in this example. So we need some cross chain synchronization. And we already have a timestamping protocol. If you have heard my talk at Cosmoverse, for example, last year, we built a timestamping protocol, which allows precisely the synchronization. So that enables us to do fast unbonding, and more importantly, in the context of this summit, we're in a modular summit.
00:14:28.862 - 00:15:01.158, Speaker A: Okay? So someone asked me what the hell your talk has to do with modularity. And then very quickly, I have to think about something. It turns out that actually, our protocol is very modular. So our vision, right in the first line, is to be able to provide bitcoin security through staking. Bitcoin staking to as many proof of stake chain in the world. Okay? So if our protocol has to adapt to change everybody's proof of stake protocol, forget it. Nobody wants to change the protocol.
00:15:01.158 - 00:15:52.974, Speaker A: So how we design it is we design using a modular tool called finality gadget. Okay? So fanatic gadget is a concept invented by Vitalik many years ago, six years ago, around which essentially is a way to add a modular addition to the proof of stake chain to any proof of stake chain to give you additional finality functioning. And in this case, the functionality we add is we can think of as BTC validated fast. BTC validated finality. Okay, so because the revealing of the private key requires some special signature, that's why we have to add this finality gadget, because the original protocol would not be using the signature. In fact, it could be using another signature like Ed 141519, something like that. 25519.
00:15:52.974 - 00:16:22.546, Speaker A: Yes. Okay. All right, so this allows us to broaden the application to many different chains. Okay, so modularity, we use this concept fanatic gadget already mentioned, started in this paper, Casper the friendly ghost. Friendly fanatic gadget. Casper FFG, invented by Vitalik. And we had a paper two years ago which have a secure design of this fanatic gadget.
00:16:22.546 - 00:17:04.526, Speaker A: So fanatic gadget is a concept invented by Vitalik. But there's some security issues with the design. We fixed that in this paper. Okay, so we apply similar concept here. All right, so here's the architecture of the whole system you can think of. There is a data plane, and there's a control plane. So in the data plane, the validators will be using these special signatures to provide BTC security to all these chains, whatever chains that once accepted as a BTC stake on the control plane, Babylon will be running stamping protocol, some kind of interface that allows the BTC to be synchronized with all these chains synchronized? All these chains.
00:17:04.526 - 00:17:28.182, Speaker A: Babylon itself will also be BTC secured. Okay, so that's the architecture that we have. All right, so we have built this architecture to some extent. We already have a timestamping testnet. So now there are 31 chains, 31 cosmos chains, Cosmos SDK chains sitting on our testnet. Synchronized with the bitcoin chain. Synchronized with the bitcoin chain.
00:17:28.182 - 00:17:54.490, Speaker A: You can visit the website. Okay. All right, so finally, I think this is a pretty interesting use case for bitcoin. Bitcoin can't really leave the bitcoin chain securely, but it can be used to secure proof of stake chain securely. So security means two things here. One, security to the proof of stake chain, two, security to the staker as well. And through this, we're hoping to provide some integration to the two economies.
00:17:54.490 - 00:17:55.640, Speaker A: Thank you. It.
00:18:11.150 - 00:18:16.662, Speaker C: What are the steps to mainet and what progress with these 31 chains?
00:18:16.726 - 00:18:35.410, Speaker A: Yeah, this 31 chains is on the timestamping test net. The next step is we're going to evolve this testnet into a BTC staking test net and invite all these 31 chains and more chains to join to do the BTC staking. And then we want to involve the main net. Our target is to launch the main net before the next halfing.
00:18:35.830 - 00:18:57.430, Speaker C: Okay, so can you give an example what kind of decision would the governance of any of these chains? We'll see, let's say in a governance proposal to vote. If I'm a holder of any of the governance token on these chains, what would be example of we propose to enable X and Y? Like, what will it say?
00:18:57.500 - 00:19:17.994, Speaker A: So the proposal will be following. The proposal will be, okay, we allow a certain percentage of our sticking market cap to be BTC stake. Okay, think about it. It's like an investment portfolio. I allow instead of right now it's all stocks, high volatility. I said, hey, I don't want all stocks. I don't want high volatility.
00:19:17.994 - 00:19:25.022, Speaker A: I want some bonds. I want 30% bonds in my portfolio, 40% bonds. That is decided by the governance proposal.
00:19:25.166 - 00:19:25.682, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:19:25.736 - 00:19:26.500, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:19:30.310 - 00:19:43.442, Speaker C: Well, then another question. What are the main challenges that are yet to be resolved for this to go live on main net and actually be usable by some of these consumer chains?
00:19:43.506 - 00:19:59.450, Speaker A: Yeah, the challenges will be a two sided market. So the challenge will be to bring two sides onto the table. We have to get some BDC holders to stake and some chains to accept the staking through the governor's proposal.
00:20:00.130 - 00:20:12.400, Speaker C: And how would the other side, the consumer side, interact with the protocol? Let's say now you're talking about implementation question.
00:20:13.810 - 00:20:26.870, Speaker A: For example, if it's a cosmo chain, it will be tenement consensus. We would add this fanatic gadget on top of tenement, and this will be a software upgrade. So this will also be a software governance proposal change.
00:20:27.020 - 00:20:31.606, Speaker C: And this finality gadget, what would it do?
00:20:31.708 - 00:20:54.830, Speaker A: It would sign an extra so tenement block is finalized through tenement. And then after it's finalized, then we will sign an extra run of signatures to do a BTC finalization of the block. And these signatures will be the special signatures for which if you double sign, the private key will be leaked.
00:20:56.690 - 00:21:08.698, Speaker C: And how will this then get to that point of a private key of Alice being leaked? Like what will actually trigger the transaction? Where does the Alice's private key stored?
00:21:08.794 - 00:21:19.250, Speaker A: The private key is not stored anywhere, but just from the signatures on the two blocks that you double sign it extract. Anyone who observed these two signatures will be able to extract the privacy.
00:21:19.330 - 00:21:20.166, Speaker C: I see.
00:21:20.348 - 00:21:27.330, Speaker D: Let's have that be the final question. You guys could do further. Q and A. Thank you back there. Thank you, David.
00:21:27.410 - 00:21:27.958, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:21:28.044 - 00:21:28.918, Speaker D: Excellent talk.
00:21:29.004 - 00:21:29.620, Speaker A: Thank you. Thank you.
