00:00:00.660 - 00:00:01.210, Speaker A: You.
00:00:03.580 - 00:00:08.792, Speaker B: Welcome to Sovereign Radio, a short form series that could become longer tailor made.
00:00:08.846 - 00:00:13.288, Speaker A: For the modular summit in Paris, 2023 this week.
00:00:13.374 - 00:00:16.388, Speaker B: Very nice. Shall we all introduce ourselves?
00:00:16.564 - 00:00:20.440, Speaker C: Hey, I'm Yaz, the head of Deborah at Celestio.
00:00:21.100 - 00:00:25.564, Speaker A: I'm Chang o and chain, the host of the Cosmos radio station entertain FM.
00:00:25.732 - 00:00:34.124, Speaker B: I'm Anna Rose, the host of the Zero Knowledge podcast. And for this series, I'll be doing two interviews, one with Anoma and one with Celestia.
00:00:34.252 - 00:00:42.316, Speaker A: I will be doing five interviews with Espresso, risk Zero, hyperlane, mantle and LaGrange labs.
00:00:42.508 - 00:00:49.590, Speaker B: And Yaz, we definitely wanted to have you be part of this video because this was your brainchild. Maybe you can tell us a little bit about how it came.
00:00:50.280 - 00:01:27.548, Speaker C: I mean, we can start with the Sovereign Radio. Basically, I wanted the killers in the industry when it comes to important conversation in web3, whether it's ZK modularity, sovereignty like in Cosmos and stuff to talk about the modular summit. And Sovereign Radio basically is important to actually have those conversations about modularity because there's a gap there. And yeah, it's part of many different things that we're doing for the modular summit, including different tracks that are curated. A lot of good swag, one of the best venues in Paris. It's going to be really exciting.
00:01:27.644 - 00:01:32.596, Speaker B: Yeah. And now I'm curious, what are you most excited about?
00:01:32.778 - 00:02:11.330, Speaker C: I'm most excited about PBSA. So shout out to Tina from Flashbars for organizing PBSA with a lot of interesting talks about proposal builder separation. One of the most important topics in mev and modularity, one of the highlight talks will be by Vitalik and there'll be a really interesting panel at the end called The End Game, which is inspired also by Vitalik's blog post. It'll have Anatoli from Solana and Mustafa from Celestia and will be moderated by Tarun. So I'm really excited about that.
00:02:12.980 - 00:02:36.730, Speaker B: I'm selfishly excited for the track that we programmed. We did the ZK track. This time around, we have, I think, six great talks and two panels. And I will say I'm most excited for those panels because we're kind of taking this theme of modularization and applying it to ZK. So we have modularization of ZK systems and ZK architecture. What about you?
00:02:37.660 - 00:02:55.660, Speaker A: I'm interested in seeing how Celestia is going to align all of these bespoke. You know, this is part of the course, right? We are talking about modularity and standardizing the whole stack so that we could have composable ecosystems, not just depth within blockchains.
00:02:57.280 - 00:03:22.470, Speaker C: One of the things about it is when they asked us to do the modular summit this year, we wanted to make it modular. Right? So how do you make it modular? You have curated tracks. So we talked about Pbsdate, CK validator doing CK track. We're at the Argus hacker house, and Argus is doing the gaming track as well. So we wanted to make it modular. And from a coordination point of view, it's very know.
00:03:23.320 - 00:03:24.900, Speaker A: Yeah, you pulled that off.
00:03:24.970 - 00:03:39.020, Speaker B: Very like this concept of the modular stack kind of where do you place this in the timeline of blockchain? Do you see this as the next step? Is this sort of like a combination of everything we've learned?
00:03:39.520 - 00:03:43.816, Speaker C: Absolutely. I can give more context, but I'd like to have any thoughts.
00:03:43.928 - 00:04:26.876, Speaker A: Right, so I think that this is very obviously the third generation of blockchain tech. So modular stack is the logical conclusion we would end up at given that we have blockchain V zero, which is bitcoin, and then blockchain V one, ethereum blockchain V two, which is the Cosmos app chain thesis, and then V three is ultimately the modular stack. And I think there's legs to this narrative because we have eigen layer polygon avail these other chains that are trying to do DA. So I don't think it's going away. And this is a very important iteration, like a step function improvement for the.
00:04:26.898 - 00:05:01.396, Speaker C: Entire space, for scalability, for scalability, most importantly because it's the next paradigm shift in blockchain architecture, like you were saying when it comes to scalability and also like abail polygon. Abel is giving a talk at the modular summit on day one. Eigen layer is part of a panel, part of panel I'm organizing for the Debral panel. So, yeah, there's a lot of different solutions for DA and the space as a whole benefits because roll up can become really scalable and then we can target the next 6 billion users.
00:05:01.588 - 00:05:27.664, Speaker A: After I really absorbed the architecture and the narrative and what's possible, I can't unsee the fact that over 90% of decentralized apps as we know it are going to be run on their own roll ups. I don't think you need to constrain it to be apps on sovereign roll ups. I mean, sorry, apps on generalized roll ups, but rather they can each have their own Sovereign roll ups. That's very exciting to me.
00:05:27.782 - 00:05:44.020, Speaker C: Exactly. And if you think about it, it's better for them because they can capture all their fees that can help sustain their ecosystem rather than giving it to the roll up operator where there's just like an application there. So it does create that element of sovereignty.
00:05:44.920 - 00:05:48.484, Speaker A: Well, that being said, I'd be interested in seeing what Vitalik's take on this.
00:05:48.522 - 00:06:12.570, Speaker C: Is if none of that here's what we believe, right? Modularism, not maximalism. Right? So people say they're competitor to Celestial. Like great, come give a like we're welcoming everyone because at the end the space wins with modularity. We don't really it's not the Celestial summit, it's the modular summit. And that's what's really important for us. Cool.
00:06:12.940 - 00:06:20.000, Speaker B: All right, so thanks and thank you for watching our video and hope you enjoy the Sovereign Radio series.
00:06:20.580 - 00:06:21.070, Speaker C: Thank you.
