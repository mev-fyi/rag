00:00:00.120 - 00:00:36.140, Speaker A: I'm trying to set this up. All right, I think we are live. Hey everyone, it's Nick Coo at Celestial Labs. Really excited to be on today with Terry, who is head of strategy at Eclipse. As some of you may know, Eclipse launched their mainnet for builders about a week and a half ago and so we wanted to have Terry on to discuss the launch, get some updates on what has been cooking in the eclipse ecosystem since then. So anyway, Terry, welcome. Tell us a bit about yourself and then let's dive in.
00:00:36.440 - 00:00:45.300, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks for having me. And shout out to the celestial community, shout out to the sloths in particular. Thanks for all the support. Yeah, we definitely notice you.
00:00:45.840 - 00:00:48.160, Speaker A: So the sloths are definitely tuning in here.
00:00:48.280 - 00:01:11.662, Speaker B: So good to give them a shout out 100%. I'm going to go check out the tweet and it's going to be like all the slots I've liked I the tweet and every time I see that I'm just like, wow, what a community. Quick introduction on myself. My name is Terry. I'm current head of strategy at Eclipse. Before eclipse I used to be a venture investor at a fund called one KX for about two and a half years. I got into crypto through an interesting path, a little different from most people you talk to.
00:01:11.662 - 00:01:50.050, Speaker B: I was a gamer. I played Axie Infinity, specifically axie classic back in, I'd say early 2020, late 2020. And then I started writing about what I thought was novel about the crypto gaming ecosystem and the NFT ecosystem in that process. Some people found my writing interesting and they wanted me to come work for them. And that's kind of how I got into venture research and venture investing there. At one Kx I was doing infrastructure research, scalability ZK, and then noticed that now these past bottlenecks that were holding back blockchain design were getting quickly solved. For example, specifically data availability.
00:01:50.050 - 00:02:13.580, Speaker B: Celestia was coming out with high throughput securely hardware, securely like consumer hardware, verifiable data availability layer. And so our thought was, okay, everywhere else is currently in the future going to get bottlenecked by execution, which we largely saw play out. Why don't we go build something that's innovating on the execution layer? And so I ended up joining eclipse.
00:02:14.680 - 00:02:39.246, Speaker A: Awesome. Great intro. And I got to know you. We finally got to meet in person in modular summit and I was really impressed with your I presentation. I feel like as your title implies, ahead of strategy. You have a very strategic mind and you're thinking really deeply about how the modular stack is going to evolve going into the future. Anyway, let's dive into the primary content of this live stream, which is the mainnet launch.
00:02:39.246 - 00:02:58.110, Speaker A: A week and a half ago, you guys made this announcement that you guys are open to builders. I'm just curious to hear what's happened since launch. Are there any metrics you can share? What's happening on Mainnet now that you guys are live? Not yet for users. And is there anything that surprised you?
00:02:58.970 - 00:03:12.430, Speaker B: Yeah. So right now we've had, in terms of metrics, 1500 unique addresses, which likely means, like ten people interact with the bridge, even though we've explicitly told users not to bridge.
00:03:12.770 - 00:03:15.882, Speaker A: It's only open. You can only access it by Cli. Right.
00:03:15.986 - 00:03:18.868, Speaker B: I saw that multiple people have some.
00:03:18.884 - 00:03:21.560, Speaker A: Real DJNs bridging funds over. Huh.
00:03:21.900 - 00:03:43.238, Speaker B: They're reading the documentation. They're running the CLI. They're trying to bridge over. We've had two third party bridge front ends launch, even though we explicitly were like, okay, yeah, we don't want a front end at the moment. Kudos to them. One has also launched an NFT collection, which we've been minting and playing around with. We've gotten a ton of inbound from interested parties that are deploying.
00:03:43.238 - 00:04:10.190, Speaker B: I believe today is the day that mango is deploying as well. Or tomorrow. And then by end of next week or early next week, you should expect to see orca there as well. Maybe some delays, but I think in the next two weeks we'll see. You can expect to see all the dapps that you love and interact with on Solana on a daily basis, also on eclipse. But we also have a ton of eclipse native dapps that are launching sometime between the next two weeks. So expect a lot of activity there.
00:04:11.000 - 00:04:37.878, Speaker A: Very cool. Yeah, it's always surprising after you go live. You really don't know what's going to happen. After Celestia went live, we had people just posting memes into the blob space. I don't know. It's really fun because blockchains are open systems and anyone, they're permissionless people just jump in and do whatever you can say, hey, don't use the bridge, but some dj out there is going to do it. There's nothing you can do about it.
00:04:37.878 - 00:04:50.770, Speaker A: And I actually love that aspect of this space. I also know that you guys launched a hackathon recently, right? Or like, I think it's ongoing currently. Is that true?
00:04:51.230 - 00:05:14.540, Speaker B: Yeah, ongoing. $50,000 in prizes. And also, I think the best thing about the hackathon is we've curated a panel of fantastic judges, mostly people who understand the technology, but also who understand the market, can provide feedback in both, give you access to a lot of capital, give you access to network in the space. So I think it's definitely an interesting opportunity if you're interested in building the space in general, not just on eclipse.
00:05:15.120 - 00:06:02.568, Speaker A: Very cool. Yeah. And to the builders out there, I think this is a very unique opportunity to be at the tip of the spear, not just for the modular ecosystem, but also, to me, what eclipse represents is this freeing of the Solana virtual machine from just its monolithic origins on the Solana L1. And similar to the trajectory that the EVM had, I think the Solana, the SVM community, is going to go through a similar evolution that's being kick started with what eclipse is doing. So I think there's just a massive opportunity for growth getting involved at this point in time. So one of the things that you said, I want to kind of dig into the significance of Eclipse's launch for the broader modular ecosystem. Right.
00:06:02.568 - 00:06:17.220, Speaker A: And also, I mean, one of the things that you said in the tweet that I loved was you said that eclipse is only possible because of celestia. Right. And so I'm wondering, like, what makes you say that? So let's, let's kind of unpack those two questions.
00:06:18.280 - 00:07:12.612, Speaker B: So I'll start with the second one, because I've been thinking about this a lot as well. I think when I was at one KX, I talked to this very seasoned game developer who's been around the space for 30, 40 years, and he told me this interesting idea, which was that in order for John Carmack to get quake and doom working on back then what was a consumer desktop, he needed to even write an algorithm to make doing the square root of a number fast, because that was used in vector normalization and graphics. And so that is an extremely, extremely low level mathematical primitive. But even that he needed to opt, because otherwise there was no way that a game and some sort of graphics would run on a consumer PC. And then he told me, the developer told me today, they don't even care. Like, these game developers are like, okay, no, we're just going to put mountains over here and we're going to render multiple kilometers that way, and we just. That the GPU is just going to take care of it.
00:07:12.612 - 00:08:12.236, Speaker B: Right. There was a time when application developers, and specifically like infrastructure developers as well, that were building on underlying layers. They were severely constricted by the capacity of the underlying layer, and you had to spend an incredible amount of time, an incredible amount of talent, incredible amount of money actually optimizing your stack because of limitations on other stacks that you relied on, right? As these stacks free up, as you get GPU's and gaming computers and then graphics accelerated with these GPU's, then you get access to way more things that you can do that are interesting in your stack and then that enables more innovation on people on the next stack and then on the next stack, right? So what celestial enabled us to do with high throughput, DA, is we didn't have to spend all this time kind of like optimizing. Okay, here's what we should take out of the call data. We should use an index instead of an account. And that's going to save us, you know, 32 bytes off the address space and that's going to give us like 20% marginal. Let's guess.
00:08:12.236 - 00:09:08.690, Speaker B: We're like, okay, we don't have to do any of that. We could take the Solana block, dump it in Celestia and don't have to worry about it because it's high performant, it's still consumer hardware, verifiable. And, you know, we can then move on to do what we think is best, which is focused on building a trustless l two, focused on execution and selling execution space, right? And so that's kind of like why I think like this is a different paradigm now, right? Like we're in a place where you have no restrictions on DA, so you can do interesting things on the execution stack. Before you had restrictions here, but now it's time to innovate on the execution stack and that's unleashed because of DA. So that's the response to the second part, the first part. It's a significant day, I think, for ethereum because largely what we've seen, and there have been examples of old vms that settle to Ethereum and use Ethereum, Da. I think fuel and Starknet are the two ones that I can think of off the top of my head.
00:09:08.690 - 00:10:03.396, Speaker B: But the expansion of what is expressible that settles to Ethereum is becoming wider and wider. And I think now we're at a time of a little bit of disillusionment in the Ethereum vision as a global settlement layer. But this just proves, right, like we're not, we're not settling to other layers, we're settling to Ethereum because it has the most amount of users, the most amount of liquidity, the newest set of builders, the most interesting activity. A lot today still happens on Ethereum. And to gain access to that and to gain access to all the liquidity, all the other assets on Ethereum l one as a very significant value proposition today. And therefore, I think continuously we're going to see a lot of people building new, interesting modular stacks that continue to settle to Ethereum and there's still a network effect there. And so kind of bringing what ethereum? I think a lot of people in the Ethereum community see as the biggest threat to Ethereum onto ethereum.
00:10:03.396 - 00:10:06.800, Speaker B: I think it's kind of an interesting milestone for ethereum today.
00:10:07.650 - 00:11:02.366, Speaker A: Yeah. On the first point about just the abundance of DA, right. Obviously this is something that Celestia has been trying to explain and put forward is releasing. We've been building with so many constraints and that fundamentally waterfalls down or I guess up the stack. Like when you don't have an abundance of block space, then the design decisions and trade offs you make at the execution layer and the application layer, et cetera, are all completely different. And it's funny because there's a lot of people on Twitter who were saying like, oh, well, yeah, eclipse is consuming a lot of block space, but that's because they're just wasting it. They're just posting the raw blocks and being super inefficient and whatever, as if that's like a, a bad thing.
00:11:02.366 - 00:12:06.552, Speaker A: And I'm like, no, that's a good thing. That's a healthy sign. That means that what we're doing is working, because now, rather than having this, I don't know, maybe it would have taken you guys a few more months to actually optimize the clip stack so that, okay, we're going to consume 50% less block space and that way it's going to be this much cheaper for the end user. Instead, it's just like, you know what? We don't need to waste that engineering manpower. We can just go straight to market with the product as it is because that's not going to affect our bottom line. And so, yeah, I'm really excited to see that the new market structure to play out and unleash all this creativity and just stop having all these developers waste time on gas golfing. That's like, I don't know, think of all the man hours that have been wasted, like smart contract engineers writing a new way to multiply numbers together to make their decks more efficient or something like that.
00:12:06.552 - 00:12:27.570, Speaker A: Right? And I just hope we can get beyond that so that we can start building again, focusing on the end product and the user experience and those kind of things. People just think that the infrastructure has no impact or there's too much infrastructure. But yeah, anyway, I digress. I don't know if you have anything else you want to expand on that point, but just want to drive that home for people.
00:12:28.470 - 00:13:02.530, Speaker B: No, no, I totally, totally agree. Totally said it best. The amount of engineering hours and effort and additional time until we could go to market that this would take to save us 20, 30%, 40% of additional data availability, just in terms of bytes, which would not entirely at all translate to anything significant from the end user perspective, that is, using the application or the execution layer, it does not make any sense when we instead we have that time and we could take that talent and work on things that would actually matter to the end user.
00:13:03.870 - 00:13:57.360, Speaker A: Yeah. Now, to go back to the significance of eclipse for the modular ecosystem and for Ethereum, you said it well, that it's interesting. Solana and Ethereum are often perceived as competitors. What's so interesting about eclipse is it's this bridge, in a sense, of enabling the Solana ecosystem to actually be connected to Ethereum in a meaningful way and settle there. And now all these applications that grew up in the Solana ecosystem, it sounds like they're going to deploy an instance of their application on you. And so it's kind of bridging these, like, those are the two major developer ecosystems or the two major ecosystems of users and liquidity. And I see eclipse as sort of like this merging and kind of like.
00:13:57.360 - 00:14:44.590, Speaker A: Also I remember David Hoffman, like tweeting out this image of eclipses, like this smorgasbord of like, Solana, Ethereum, Celestia risk zero for proving and things like that. And, you know, it's cool how you can take the best of each component here, right? Like, Ethereum to me actually is still the very much the king in terms of settlement and distribution. And Solana, I think, has the best sort of execution model. Celestia obviously has best in class data availability, and then you're able to take the best of each layer to build this, like, higher level ecosystem that unifies all of it. So that's the way, at least that I see eclipse.
00:14:45.730 - 00:15:24.462, Speaker B: I absolutely agree. Right. The whole point of the modular stack is it gives you choice. Then once you have a choice, why not just choose the best one at each layer? Ethereum is an obvious choice for the settlement layer because simply even just taking into account its liquidity profile and the amount of assets that lie on Ethereum, that in and of itself is a sufficient choice to choose Ethereum as a settlement layer. So last year, I don't think at the time when we were building, there was simply just no other choice. And I still don't think today that there is a maturity in the level of available tooling that allows you to build a fully permissionless l two in any other ecosystem, any other Da layer. Right? Like blobstream.
00:15:24.462 - 00:15:50.110, Speaker B: You guys have Blobstream X. You guys have multiple vendors for Blobstream X, like clients everywhere, you know, high throughput DA. I don't think that is available to my knowledge at any other Da layer today. And then obviously, like, if you go take a look at which chain is doing the highest throughput and which chain kind of is optimized for throughput, then the answer is obvious in terms of production. What's in production today? Right?
00:15:50.970 - 00:16:53.480, Speaker A: Yeah. So one of the things I want to talk a little bit more about is, like, clips has quickly raced up the leaderboard as far as like the live roll ups on the Slesia mainnet. To be like the number three consumer of data blobs of all time in just a week and a half, which has been astonishing, actually, a little bit intimidating because now it feels like, okay, wow. We used to feel like, okay, Celestia's block space has a lot of, um, there's, there's just, there's such an abundance of it. Like, we don't have to necessarily worry about it being filled up, but like, it's starting to become really real. Like, okay, we need to, you know, the block space is, is going to get filled up, right? Like once you guys launch for, uh, you know, with open to users and your, your actual blocks are filled, like, that's going to only just increase the amount of demand. And, you know, we have a very robust scaling roadmap.
00:16:53.480 - 00:17:20.300, Speaker A: So I'm not necessarily concerned, but I'm just like, I'm curious, like, what do you foresee, first of all, what is it actually in the blocks right now? Because it's not user transactions, it's just voting. And I don't know. Explain that, because that's been a topic on Twitter that I've seen people dig into a little bit. And then what do you foresee for once you guys are actually live for users? Where will demand go from here?
00:17:21.639 - 00:18:05.480, Speaker B: Yeah. So what's in the blocks? Right? It's an entire, it's an entire Solana block, I imagine an entire ethereum block. What's in it? It's the block hash, it's the timestamp, it's the epoch, it's the aggregated BLS signature. And then there's the receipt tree, the state tree, and the transaction route. So there's a lot of stuff in there versus if you just put transaction data in there in a compressed way that is way less stuff, or like state tree in there, and it's in a compressed way that's way less stuff. Um, and so that's where kind of the overhead is coming from because, you know, we have this Solana block, there's a block cache. It has the timestamp, the epoch, the current leader, previous leader, the previous block cache, et cetera, et cetera.
00:18:05.480 - 00:18:06.580, Speaker B: That.
00:18:06.660 - 00:18:09.360, Speaker A: How frequently are you guys, are you guys posting that?
00:18:10.060 - 00:18:58.758, Speaker B: I think posting, it's batched, so I believe something like in the order of a couple of. So it is batched and it is compressed, right? So people say, oh, like it's hyper un optimized. Well, no, it's, it's hyper un optimized as in like we didn't really care to like optimize what exactly we're putting on there, but it is optimized that we batch it, we compress it, and we make sure like at least what's on, like if we were un ideological about what's on there, like we at least, you know, minimize our footprint. But the reason why we did that, it's like, it's incredibly trivial for us to replay. Uh, that's what our engineers have been telling us, right? Like versus we could create a new scheme where, you know, we serialize transactions a certain way and then we have to recover them in blobstream for a withdrawal function, whatever. If we just do this, it's super simple. It works out of the gate.
00:18:58.758 - 00:19:09.050, Speaker B: We can go to market faster. Right. But without sacrificing on any trust assumptions. And there is no, at the moment, there is no like costs relayed back to the user.
00:19:12.560 - 00:19:36.420, Speaker A: So just to put a bow on that. So you guys are, what is the block time at eclipse? Is it 1 second? So we have a bunch of these eclipse blocks and then you batch and compress them and then post them as a blob on Celestia, basically. But there's multiple, I guess, how many blocks are happening per unit time?
00:19:36.930 - 00:19:47.378, Speaker B: Uh, it's every 400 milliseconds. So right now we're, we're mainland equivalent, um, to Solana. Uh, that is going to change in the next coming, coming months, uh, as.
00:19:47.394 - 00:19:51.070, Speaker A: We change, meaning be go faster.
00:19:51.850 - 00:20:54.900, Speaker B: That would be ideal. So we're looking into what it takes for us to go faster. Uh, produce bigger blocks, have higher cu limits than mainnet um, and what might it look like to put, you know, say, like a high performance client of, of this Solana Vmdezen as an l two, once that's more stable and released. And of course, when that happens, we will be looking for you guys to also expand your throughput. But as you said, we've looked at the Celestia scaling roadmap, and we have high confidence that it's going to scale to the needs that we will produce. So, for example, if you look at the maximum size possible of a Solana transaction, and then you look at the block time, and then you extrapolate at maximum throughput, what this might look like in terms of da, like, celestia at its end game is plenty suitable to be able to support this with adequate compression and a tiny bit of optimization on our side. So we have high confidence that Celestia will be able to support all of Eclipse's DA needs.
00:20:54.900 - 00:21:01.900, Speaker B: But once users are on, like, yeah, it's gonna a lot more, a lot more data is gonna come on.
00:21:02.490 - 00:22:02.158, Speaker A: All right. I'm excited and also intimidated, as I said. But something that I love that you mentioned, and this is something I've been trying to say, is you can actually do more interesting things at the execution layer and go faster, go bigger when you don't have to run a full consensus layer. I know that we want to have decentralized sequencing and things like that, but you don't need 1000 nodes to get the censorship, resistance and liveness guarantees that you need from your execution layer. And so to me, it's going to be really exciting to see something like eclipse push performance of execution far beyond what you can do with Solana. I'm going to be very excited to see that actually take place. And then another thing that I think is worth mentioning just on this point is that Anatoly jokes a lot about like, oh, well, Solana could be an Ethereum roll up.
00:22:02.158 - 00:22:28.630, Speaker A: You just have to post all of the Solana block data to Ethereum, right? And he says that because it's so clearly not possible to do that. It's like a joke. It's like, okay, good luck trying to post all the Solana data to Ethereum. Ethereum's Da bandwidth is just not even close to where it needs to be to make that possible. But the interesting thing is that Celestia wants to be to actually enable that. Like, in the future. I hope that Celestia's Da bandwidth is actually possible.
00:22:28.630 - 00:23:26.986, Speaker A: It's actually possible for Solana if they want it to be, to be a celestial roll up, for example, like to outscale, to scale to that, to that level. And again, where eclipse, like, falls into this is like it was even, you know, right now, I would imagine, giving you guys data consumption, even post 444, it's just not feasible to want to, like to run, you know, a network like you guys want to run on something like, like Ethereum. The scaling, it wasn't really possible to build these high performance, super data hungry execution layers on the existing infrastructure. So, yeah, I think Celestia is making that possible. And hopefully there's going to be multiple Solana scale execution layers on Celestia in the future. So, I don't know. It's just a really exciting time where the, the, you know, the realm of what's possible has just been really blown open.
00:23:26.986 - 00:23:31.330, Speaker A: And I don't think people have, have really, like, caught up to that idea. Any, any thoughts on that?
00:23:31.490 - 00:23:59.964, Speaker B: Yeah, 100%. So let me address the second point first, and then go to, you know, um, scaling execution versus an outsourcing consensus and data availability. We did the math. Um, I think right now, if my memory is correct, like, dank, sharding target da rate is like 1.3 megabytes per second. Uh, and then the current, uh, the current, like, maximum size for Solana transaction is like 1232 bytes. So we did the math with 4844 and with, uh.
00:23:59.964 - 00:24:41.972, Speaker B: Thanks. Charting target rates that are known, and we were like, okay, yeah, actually, ethereum da cannot support the level of transaction throughput that Solana has today on Ethereum. And so if we want to further optimize the execution layer, like, there's no chance that we can use ethereum da, we have to use something else. Yeah. And so that's kind of like how we ended up at Celestia. And at that time, obvious choice still is in terms of the first part of outsourcing, like data availability and consensus. It's kind of like the modular stack is about having some people who are best at one thing work on that thing, and you work on what you're good at.
00:24:41.972 - 00:25:22.764, Speaker B: Right. And that worked beautifully across all of the industrial age, where people specialize in certain things that they're fantastic at and you outsource the rest and you focus on one thing. I think I'm surprised at a little. Why not? A lot of roll ups have done this historically, right? Like, they've experienced periods of massive congestion where a lot of their dapps have churned, and they've kind of gone on to horizontal scaling instead with yet a TBD solution on how to unify the experience. And a lot of users have turned from ethereum because of that choice that they've made, uh, instead, when they could have just simply raised the gas limit of their blocks. Yeah, there is some limitation to do that using the EVm, but they could have done it. Uh, and base did it.
00:25:22.764 - 00:25:51.590, Speaker B: So base, median gas fees during the liquidation spike two days ago was not as bad as arbitrums. Um, but it's interesting choice why, why they made that choice. Uh, it is revenue maximizing to do that, but still, uh, and I think there is also a widespread understanding from popular roll up companies that it is impossible to do high throughput execution with Ethereum. Da. It's kind of like why there's the, the alternative the alayers provided natively to, like, arbitram orbit chains. I'm blanking on the name of what it's called.
00:25:53.490 - 00:25:57.098, Speaker A: Like, is this specific chain or like.
00:25:57.114 - 00:26:00.514, Speaker B: The arbitrum dax solution. They all have dax solution.
00:26:00.642 - 00:26:01.750, Speaker A: Oh, any trust.
00:26:02.090 - 00:26:23.640, Speaker B: Any trust. Right, right. So I think that any trust is kind of like understanding that, like, yeah, we can't through scale high throughput chains with Ethereum. Da, we have to use something, but preferably you'd rather use something that's like, it's in the public. You could verify with, like, client, you know, it has billions and billions of economic security over. Okay, yeah, it's, it's private.
00:26:23.980 - 00:27:17.944, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, it's like, yeah, you could run a really high performance chain, maybe like infinite TPS on AWS, you know, just. But that's not what we're here for, basically. And I think Celestia wants to preserve, wants to give you the ability to have that level of throughput but still maintain trust minimization. And that's a much harder problem to solve. Like, if it were the case that, like, data availability committees, like, any trusts were, like, sufficient for web3, we could just kind of retire, hang up our boots, and just be like, yeah, da is no longer a problem, but it very much is because we want those security guarantees. We're here for trust minimization and verifiability, and I'm just very glad that eclipse also is prioritizing that in the roadmap. I saw you guys also in the blog post talk about how you want to progress as soon as possible to stage one and stage two roll up.
00:27:17.944 - 00:27:34.060, Speaker A: And so I think this is a good transition to sort of like, start to wrap up this conversation. Like, what can people expect in the coming year or the next few months from eclipse? Where is eclipse going to go and what's next on the roadmap?
00:27:35.040 - 00:28:21.262, Speaker B: Yeah, and to the credit of the deck companies, they've worked a lot on verifiability, but I do think being in the public is actually very, very important and allowing anyone to just follow the chain is very, very important. Okay, what's next in the roadmap next three months? I would say it's all about the Dapps and the ecosystem partners that are launching on eclipse. So I think that's what you would hear the most from us about. So all the dapps that you love on Solana net, new dapps, deepin gaming, meme, coins, you name it, nfts. We have a full host of very interesting builders that are coming onto clips. I think we'd be very excited to showcase them over time on our twitter page and also on live streams as well. And then in terms of the technical side, we have to, have to, have to become trustless over time.
00:28:21.262 - 00:29:02.970, Speaker B: We have to become a type one roll up as soon as possible. So we're working hard on forced inclusions on a trustless bridge, specifically a celestial bridge. Yeah. Make sure to have a verifier architecture, fraud proofs. Those things we'll be working very hard on. And then afterwards we're going to turn our eye into how can we further maximize the execution stack so users never experience congestion? Dapps get the value that they generate back to themselves. And there's generally an incentive aligned and high throughput execution layer that is music to my ears.
00:29:03.050 - 00:29:37.120, Speaker A: And as someone who's been following eclipse for multiple years now, it's incredible that you guys are live. And so this is the beginning of the journey and I'm looking forward to seeing how the ecosystem grows, how the technology stack continues to evolve and get optimized and more trust minimized. There's just a lot to look forward to. So Terry, really, thank you so much for coming on and congratulations again on the launch. Where can people follow progress? Or how should people get involved in the ecosystem if they want to?
00:29:38.100 - 00:29:50.090, Speaker B: Definitely follow us on Twitter clips fnd follow each of our individual members. We're often posting about eclipse and or being retweeted by the corporate account. Join us on our livestream and join us on our hackathon that's ongoing today.
00:29:50.710 - 00:30:00.530, Speaker A: Cool. And also a plug for Terry's talk at modular summit. I thought it was fantastic. Again. Well, thank you, Terry, and we'll see you in the blob space.
00:30:01.150 - 00:30:02.410, Speaker B: Awesome. Thanks, Nick.
00:30:02.750 - 00:30:05.370, Speaker A: Cheers. Thanks everyone for coming.
00:30:06.390 - 00:30:06.870, Speaker B: Thank you everyone.
