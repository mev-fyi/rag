00:00:00.170 - 00:00:43.798, Speaker A: Thank you guys for joining. Let's kick things off. As everyone's probably aware, last week John published a new article, another one of his masterpieces, that kind of kicked off or reignited an old debate about roll ups, sovereignty, bridging, a lot of things that run to the very core of blockchains. And Kelvin was a co author on that post. And then also he wrote a follow up post earlier this week, which I thought was also a masterpiece. John wrote a follow up post. There was a lot of debates on Twitter.
00:00:43.798 - 00:01:28.090, Speaker A: I think Togo is one of the more salient, coherent critics of some of the positions that were made in those posts. And so we just wanted to get people together to talk about this topic and go deeper and kind of unravel and get to the bottom of this conversation. So that's why we're here. And I wanted to start with just a round of intros for our guests, for people who do not already know them. I'm Nick Coo at Celestial Labs, by the way. But, yeah, why don't we do a round of intros? Kelvin, why don't you start? Sure.
00:01:28.160 - 00:01:53.890, Speaker B: Okay. Hi, I'm Kelvin. Hope people can hear me properly. Yeah, it seems like it's working. Kelvin also smart contracts on various different platforms and been working on layer two stuff for a long time now. Originally with plasma and then obviously with optimistic roll ups. In the optimism sphere.
00:01:53.890 - 00:02:05.380, Speaker B: Yeah, originally did a lot of engineering, now moving into more sort of debrely stuff, so a lot of fun.
00:02:09.270 - 00:02:11.810, Speaker A: Cool. John Togl.
00:02:13.610 - 00:02:30.220, Speaker C: Everyone. I'm John. I'm one of the co founders over at DBA. Primarily infrastructure, broadly focused research and investing. Mostly spend my time writing about roll ups and posting memes about them.
00:02:33.870 - 00:02:51.140, Speaker D: Hello, my name is Talgro. I do research at Scroll. I mostly focus on the protocol, sides of the bridge, design, incentive, decentralization, stuff like that. You probably can see me shit posting on Twitter quite a lot. That's what I mostly do on my job.
00:02:54.230 - 00:03:33.890, Speaker A: Awesome. Yeah, a lot of shit posting. That's what this group. That's the true full time job. So to start things off, I wanted to just frame the debate and get everyone's sort of like, baseline position and establish the context for the audience. So what is this? Do roll ups equal bridges debate about? Can someone kind of summarize it? Assuming that people have some baseline knowledge of the various components so we don't have to define everything from scratch. Does someone want to take a stab?
00:03:36.710 - 00:04:35.186, Speaker B: Sure, I can take a stab at mean, I think everyone kind of has a different perspective on what even the debate is. And so I think that's part of what we kind of need to figure out here. I think from the perspective that John and I have been coming at this, it's essentially looking at the way that people think about roll ups today and acknowledging that there are certain dynamics within that structure that aren't typically talked about. Right. That we kind of ignore. We kind of say, we kind of hand wave away a little bit by saying that they're not particularly important. And we have this sort of concept of the sovereign roll up and the roll up roll up.
00:04:35.186 - 00:05:32.440, Speaker B: And I think that there is a little bit of confusion about what these things are and how they differ. I think the stance that the sort of roll up does not equal bridge side takes is that there's this spectrum on which these systems operate and the delineation is not as clean as maybe we sort of historically would have thought. And that a lot of that perspective comes from the history of how these systems were built and which systems came first and all these different things. But now we're trying to look at this in a little bit of a deeper sense and say, well, what are the actual dynamics happening under the hood? Like what could happen? What is happening? How do we expect these systems to work in the.
00:05:39.450 - 00:05:43.994, Speaker A: John rule? Do you guys have anything to add? Yeah.
00:05:44.112 - 00:07:08.246, Speaker C: Second that. Yeah, kind of what a lot of it comes down to is we think of today's smart contract roll ups versus the extreme other end of sovereign rollups as these completely distinct far ends of the spectrum. And it's one or the other and they have completely different properties. And while that makes sense in the practical sense because we're used to thinking about sovereign roll ups as this complete other end of the spectrum kind of idea that doesn't even really exist yet, as opposed to smart contract roll ups where they are very much today on that very far end of the spectrum, where it's honestly a pretty good description to say that the bridge defines the roll up, at least in the practical sense of when we're looking at the two biggest roll ups today. Yeah, the bridge is basically all that matters because without the bridge, those roll ups today are completely reliant on it. But trying to actually pull that apart because the reality is it's a lot messier and there is very much a spectrum between those two things. And I think the very practical reality is that in the not so distant future, it's not going to be okay, you're on this one at far end of the spectrum or the other far end of the spectrum, and we have to understand the interplay of those different things, because I think a lot of us have a general idea of, a general notion of what role ups give us, whether it's inheriting security, trust, minimum bridging, and so on.
00:07:08.246 - 00:07:24.060, Speaker C: But a lot of our understandings of fundamentally where those things come from is often incorrect and honestly hard to kind of pin down. So understanding where they actually come from, as we think about designing these going forward, when the systems will just from a practical perspective, change a lot, it's very important.
00:07:30.750 - 00:08:22.170, Speaker D: I feel like if we remove the social consensus out of the equation, the delineation between what I call classic roll ups and sovereign roll ups, because it becomes much more clear. The problem is that we don't really have a concrete definition of what social consensus is. You can use multiple different versions, define it in multiple ways. And so I don't like involving social consensus in the concrete definitions of things, because if you involve social consensus, you can always say that nothing that we're using right now is actually concrete, because everything can be changed based on the social consensus. And so basically, the entire field that we have spent the last 15 years building, all the knowledge that we've been building, is worth nothing, because at the end of the day, it's all social consensus.
00:08:25.710 - 00:09:34.242, Speaker A: Okay, so I'm hearing a lot of different things. One is that the delineation or definition between sovereign rollups and what we call smart contract roll ups is not quite as clear as we once thought. And maybe the boundary is really fuzzy. And then John is also saying that roll ups today are very dependent on the bridge, potentially, but that doesn't mean that it will always be the case. And I think there's lots to unpack there in terms of what does it mean to be dependent on a bridge? What does that enshrined, contract provide or not provide? And then toggle's getting to the aspect of social consensus and forking as one of the mechanisms that defines sovereignty. But then when you define that's something that is itself, so just like inherent, that maybe using that to make a definition is not useful. So I think that's at least kind of what I'm taking away from what you guys are saying so far.
00:09:34.242 - 00:09:52.410, Speaker A: And we'll definitely dig in a little bit more. But I'm curious why you guys think this debate matters. Why are people so, I don't know, triggered by this? And why do you guys care so much about debating it? What is at stake in this conversation?
00:09:57.630 - 00:11:11.940, Speaker B: From my perspective, this has always been, I'm coming at this from the perspective of someone building one of these systems. And for me it's just about understanding more deeply what these systems are and how they might behave. I think there's an argument to be made about how, how this, how this impacts sort of the user's ability to make decisions within these systems. But in, in a lot of ways it's kind of for me and for other system designers where I want people to, we want to be realistic about the practical reality, but we also want to be sort of rigorous about the fundamental reality. And those abstractions, those practical abstractions are very important, but we can't ignore the more fundamental mean. John also feels strongly about this from a user perspective, so I'll give it to John for that.
00:11:14.310 - 00:12:14.550, Speaker C: Yeah, it's definitely a mix of a lot of mean, like a lot of the pushback from people understandably is like, oh, this is semantics. To which my reply is probably it kind of is semantics, but that doesn't mean it's a bad thing. Quite frankly, we're fumbling around at kind of what these things even fundamentally are and where exactly a lot of these properties come from that we're talking about. Where does the security come from? Where is the social consensus in this thing? Where does it matter? That has a lot of very practical implications for what we're building and how people end up interacting with them. I think a lot of what we need to just kind of level set on is like there's a handful of 50 to 100 people who say like, oh, all of this is intuitive, so I don't need a better mental model. And for those 50 to 100 people who are building these systems, yeah, most of them are not going to understand roll ups better by reading at a technical level of anything that I wrote. A lot of it is just fundamentally rethinking, though.
00:12:14.550 - 00:13:16.674, Speaker C: What are the important things here and how do we communicate them and how do we build in reflection of that? And even amongst the quote unquote experts, it's impossible to keep up with this, how constantly and changing it is. The simple example being this new kind of definition of sovereign roll ups that has come up over the last couple of months, not something I redefined it as. Just like the way that we initially thought of sovereign roll ups was like, okay, there's no enshrine bridge, and that means that you can fork it whenever, but you can't have a trust minimized bridge. Once you have a trust minimized bridge with another chain, it's not sovereign anymore. But as we've seen for example with the great posts that sovereign labs has had, I was like, there's kind of these different notions of sovereignty, the technical, more source of truth kind of notion of sovereignty, versus this practical social ability to fork the chain. Those are very different, rapidly evolving things that even when I talk to people who are building roll ups today, are not aware of that delineation. And that does have meaningful implications on a very practical and technical level of how do we build these things.
00:13:16.674 - 00:14:16.102, Speaker C: Does the user source of truth need to be just like I run an ethereum full node and I look at the bridge, or is it reasonable to distribute proofs p to p first and they can perceive faster finality even from a lightkind perspective, and then the bridge can just finalize it later? That is a very meaningful, technical and practical different way to build the system and reflection of the fact that we're understanding that the bridge is not the only source of truth in the world. So that fundamental just framing is very important on a very direct and practical level. And a lot of it is also just what I was saying of none of this is intuitive. And I think all of us can get a lot better at just explaining to the other 99.9% of people how this stuff works, because that has very practical user implications. The simple example being of one that I wrote about on USDC, which I think a lot of people understandably get confused on, and Bartech had a poll on it and had a bunch of amazing threads that described it very well. But similarly in that vein, it is confusing.
00:14:16.102 - 00:15:09.482, Speaker C: I talked to a number of other people who are experts who are building infrastructure projects in crypto and ask them, out of curiosity, what do you think is safer, like native USBC on a roll up, or the bridged version from the l one, and get a variety of different answers and confusion on that. And it's not intuitive. Like what happens if I have a native asset on the l two, that I burn it there or I lock it like I mint it somewhere else? None of that stuff is intuitive. And when we frame everything through this notion of the bridge, it gives very clear implications to people who don't understand these things. Well, understandably, that we're going to come up with incorrect notions. One of the very simple examples is if we keep saying that the bridge is basically this source of truth, that's the only way that you get security. The implication from that, that I very commonly see is that people often still don't understand that sovereign roll ups are, they can absolutely be secure.
00:15:09.482 - 00:15:29.140, Speaker C: And I very frequently see like, oh, the operator can just take all of your money because there's no bridge contract that enforces things, which is just fundamentally not true. So it's a mix of, for ourselves from the designer perspective of fundamentally understanding them, and then also a mix of how do we communicate these things better. Because I think a lot of this is very confusing the way that we're describing it.
00:15:32.620 - 00:16:21.960, Speaker A: Yeah, I strongly agree. I mean, I think that to both of you guys points, as people who are building in the modular stack, it's important that we have the right mental models to know how these systems behave, as Kelvin said. And that informs the way that we will like the kind of things that we'll build and we'll build for. And then also kind of to your, the broader perception of how roll ups work may not be accurate because it kind of started from a different perspective in light of sort of the new way that we're viewing things. Users need to be more informed basically of the security or the trade offs or like what can actually happen or how roll ups really work. Toval, I'm curious to hear your perspective on why this debate matters.
00:16:24.460 - 00:17:37.110, Speaker D: For me, it matters because of the preciseness of the throwing. All of us have been throwing around a lot of words like trustless, decentralized, trust minimized, whatever. And I can bet if you put 20 roll up researchers in one room and ask them for a definition of roll up, of what a roll up is, none of them will agree on the definition. And that's how basically we don't even agree on the fundamentals, let alone on specific details of how things are implemented, et cetera. And so it's difficult for a user to understand what the security properties of a certain protocol is, or a family of protocols where when even the people who are working on it can't agree on what the security properties are. And so this debate is important for us to understand it so we can standardize what we communicate, and then it's much easier for the user to see, oh yeah, it's a roll up with this assumptions, or like, oh, this is validium that uses these assumptions for this particular property and stuff like that.
00:17:39.880 - 00:18:36.390, Speaker A: Yeah, it's kind of frustrating when the definitions of things keep changing out from under us. And it definitely seems for sovereign roll ups, that's something that has been sort of shifting over time. So John, you mentioned something about the difference between technical sovereignty and social sovereignty, and I know that you mentioned that in your post. I think that sort of like idea originated sort of with Mustafa and probably Preston from sovereign labs but I think you articulated it well. I think that's a really important point to get across, because it kind of delineates between this idea of social consensus versus the source of truth for how people are actually able to get the latest secure state from the roll up. So could you maybe explain a bit about that?
00:18:38.120 - 00:19:49.704, Speaker C: Yeah, happy to. And this is part of the reason why, for what it's worth, I'm doubtful of us having these canonical definitions that are going to stick, is because this is the perfect example of our understanding of these systems is fundamentally just constantly changing, and we're coming up with new ideas and new constructs that will just fundamentally change, like how we think about these systems. So the simple example of that is what I was starting to describe a little bit before, is these different kind of notions of what sovereignty means. So there's this delineation kind of now between technical sovereignty and social sovereignty, where the technical sovereignty is referring more to where do users get the quote unquote source of truth of what is the canonical chain? Is this valid? Et cetera? And the expectation today in ethereum roll ups is that, okay, if take a Zk roll up, we're posting ZK proofs and we post them to the bridge. So the assumption is like, if I'm running an ethereum full node, like embedded within that is a like client of the roll up, which is the bridge, it checks that proof. So now I know I've implicitly, like, I have verified the roll up, and this bridge is checking the fourth choice rule. It's enforcing censorship resistance.
00:19:49.704 - 00:21:00.684, Speaker C: Like I could send my transaction to the arbitram inbox contracts, and it will enforce that I get included if I'm getting censored, et cetera. But you can get the source of truth in a different manner. So the example of what sovereign labs has been posting that they're thinking about doing is, okay, it's expensive to post these proofs and verify them on chain, so why don't we just generate them in real time and distribute them p to p to light clients? And now the source of truth is no longer the bridge for these roll up usage. I can run a roll up light client, get a proof, and I'm good to go. And it fundamentally changes how you have to build these things, because usually the bridge is also, it's enforcing the fork choice rule, it's enforcing the censorship resistance in the way that, as I mentioned, with Arbitram's inbox contract, we're showing that, hey, this transaction was submitted, we're going to force included it even if the sequencer didn't want to. So they're going to have their CK proofs built in a different manner here such that, okay, we're proving that we scanned the DA layer and we looked for transactions that are eligible to force include, and we're proving that we've included this and therefore we follow the fourth choice rule. We implement that and prove it directly within the proof.
00:21:00.684 - 00:21:28.920, Speaker C: So I don't need the bridge anymore. But at the same time we can still have a bridge contract and then we'll post proofs later and batch them every once in a while when we need to settle to the bridge. And the bridge also gets finality. But that's, as I mentioned, expensive to do that on chain, so we only do that periodically. So you're changing it fundamentally. We could still have this bridge, but there's a different source of truth for the users and we built the proofs in a different manner to reflect that. The more traditional notion of sovereignty that we think about is this ability to fork.
00:21:28.920 - 00:22:14.836, Speaker C: And that's the kind of social sovereignty. And the thing here is this is also kind of like a practical spectrum, again, where we think of it as like, okay, if this roll up has an official bridge, well, that means you're not sovereign and you can't fork. And if you don't have this bridge, that means you're sovereign and you can socially fork whenever you want. But again, the reality of that is very practical and fuzzy. You could take the simple example of, I've given a social media application of like, let's say there's barely any money in the bridge and all the valuable state is user data. In that case, you probably can fork away from the bridge if the governance token holders are getting greedy and they're extracting rent and all the users say like screw this, we're going to make another roll up. We read over the data, there's barely any money in the bridge.
00:22:14.836 - 00:23:03.656, Speaker C: We don't care about it. We force withdraw. So they have that social ability to fork in that case, even though they have a bridge, while on the other side you could have a sovereign roll up like quote unquote in the traditional definition where there is no official bridge. But what if there's a bunch of USDC on the chain that's natively deployed and USDC doesn't want to go along with the fork that they go along with, although you're imposing the same cost on that of like if we fork away from this and the majority of our value is native, like obviously your practical social sovereignty has gone down. So is this quote unquote sovereign roll up more sovereign than the smart contract roll up I just described? Because it doesn't have a bridge. I would certainly argue no, because you're clearly imposing a much higher practical cost on it to socially fork and as a result it's completely infeasible to do so, most likely. So understanding that there are these very different notions and they're very much a spectrum.
00:23:03.656 - 00:23:24.770, Speaker C: And it's not this always clear black and white between what is sovereign and what isn't, particularly from the social perspective. And then also on the technical sovereignty perspective. Again, that has very direct technical and practical implications of how we build these systems in light of thinking about what does the bridge actually provide us. So all of that is very fundamentally important to understand.
00:23:26.740 - 00:24:36.760, Speaker A: Yeah, it seems like there's a very clean technical definition of sovereignty, like a sovereign roll up versus a smart contract roll up. But then as soon as you start to consider the social dimension of it, it all of a sudden gets very gray where sure, you may not have quote enshrined the bridge into the source of truth of your chain, but then the fact that, let's say you do have a bridge with another chain, you are in some sense giving up your sovereignty. Because if you want that bridge to be trust minimized when you fork, you're going to have to basically sacrifice those assets and it increases the cost of actually forking. So it does in some sense decrease your sovereignty. So then it's like, is the only roll up that can be sovereign one in which there are no bridges? And so we should just give up on the idea of sovereign world because it's never going to be practical or not. I'm curious, Kelvin or Torrell, how do you guys see this? Do you think there's like a tension here? Do you think that the definition is clear or is it just fuzzy inherently?
00:24:39.020 - 00:25:23.316, Speaker D: I feel like as soon as you bring up social consensus, it inherently becomes fuzzy. So for example, even in this example, this example of, oh yeah, it's sovereign because if the majority of your assets are on the l two, you can just fork away. Only works if you assume that all those token holders that are native to the l two agree with the fork. But let's say what if I have an NFT collection on an l two that derives most of its value from the fact that there's a trust minimized bridge with Ethereum. As soon as you fork it, my value drops. So I won't support it. So I will accept the previous fork.
00:25:23.316 - 00:26:24.232, Speaker D: So the canonical chain that has the trust minimized bridge as the one that my collection is going to support. And you can come up with a lot of examples like that. And in that case, basically the social consensus of the protocol is completely different from the social consensus of the tokens that are deployed on top of that particular l two, which means that the value doesn't really matter that much. It's just about who agrees with you and who doesn't. And at the same time, you can always bring up social consensus. So for example, is a sovereign roll up not a roll up? Because I can fork the roll up and add a transaction in the middle of the finalized batches that has never been submitted on chain. Does that mean that the current version of my sovereign roll up is not actually a roll up? Because from the definition of the roll up, I can't really reconstruct the state because one of the transactions doesn't have data on chain.
00:26:24.232 - 00:26:56.870, Speaker D: It's just a question of do we consider like a hypothetical scenario in which you can fork and create something else? Does that have an impact on the definition that we currently operate in, or do we just chalk it off to social consensus? And basically social consensus can do whatever they want in crypto or to be fair, in any single. Yeah.
00:27:00.220 - 00:27:18.780, Speaker B: One response to this is essentially that, I don't think you can just ignore social consensus. Social consensus is a real thing. It exists. It's like how we fork blockchains, but it's also real in the world in general.
00:27:18.850 - 00:27:19.132, Speaker A: Right?
00:27:19.186 - 00:28:03.684, Speaker B: Like many things are essentially just social constructions. The example I gave in my blog post was Coke. Like Coca Cola, right? In the 1950s there's some recipe for Coca Cola. Then in the 80s they try to turn it into new coke. And social consensus basically says, no, new coke is not close enough to still be called coke, so we're not going to accept it. And then today you have a different recipe of Coca Cola, which has high fructose corn syrup in it instead of cane sugar and whatever, instead of cocaine in it. And we still call this thing coke, right? We still say, if I go out to a bodega and I get a can of coke, I'm not like, this isn't real coke.
00:28:03.684 - 00:28:26.816, Speaker B: Because it's not from the, I could say that. I could say like, oh, the only real coke was the first recipe that was ever created. And I could say that forever. But that's a pedantic point. And everyone's basically just going to say, that doesn't make any sense. I think this is real code. And the other side of this is also that I think this starts to get at fundamentally what we're trying to do with these blockchains.
00:28:26.816 - 00:29:14.256, Speaker B: I think people often take this stance that somehow these systems are as fundamental as physics. And the reality is what these systems are. They're all approximations of social constructions that we've created for efficiency purposes. Right. And the simpler the social construction is, the simpler the process of approximating that social construction as code is, and the less likely that you have a split is. But the more complex the social construction, the harder it is to reflect as code. At the end of the day, these systems are not these arbitrary things that we've created to enforce technology onto people.
00:29:14.256 - 00:29:52.190, Speaker B: They are constructed explicitly to simplify the process of enforcing some, or describing some social construction as code. Right. And we understand that you can get efficiency gains that way, but we can't just say that social consensus doesn't exist. I think that if you take that stance, then of course you can have this very black and white view. But fundamentally, social consensus always exists. And what we want to look at is what are the different power dynamics within the social consensus process that might lead to one result or another.
00:29:54.020 - 00:29:56.530, Speaker D: Yeah, but my argument isn't that.
00:29:58.580 - 00:29:58.896, Speaker C: You.
00:29:58.918 - 00:30:36.236, Speaker D: Should just ignore social consensus. Obviously, social consensus is there, and it'll always be there. It's just a question of should it impact our concrete definitions? Because you can apply the same thing, the same social consensus argument to literally anything. Or so do the cryptographic properties of signatures matter? Oh, no, because we can just ignore those signatures. So, yeah, there are no cryptographic properties. Or like, does a certain consensus mechanism have finality guarantees? Oh, no, it doesn't matter because the social consensus can just ignore those properties. And that's my argument here.
00:30:36.236 - 00:30:47.970, Speaker D: It's not that social consensus doesn't exist or it should be completely ignored, but my argument is that it shouldn't impact the concrete definitions that we use to define things.
00:30:49.940 - 00:31:49.124, Speaker B: The counterpoint here is essentially that we should look at this in a more rigorous way and look at the spectrum along which social consensus operates. Right. If you have a system where all of the economic value on the system is entirely bridged assets, then you understand that to fork that system, you'd be forfeiting the value of all of these assets. So there's this massive cost to any fork. And so we understand that the bridge has an enormous amount of power within that sort of system. If on the other side of the spectrum, you have a system where there's a tiny bridge, it's trustless, it's whatever, right? It's a standard, like ethereum roll up setup, but it's a tiny bridge and it only has one USDC worth of something in it. Then to fork that system, we're not forfeiting very much at all.
00:31:49.124 - 00:32:24.800, Speaker B: And so that bridge doesn't have as much power over the social consensus process of the roll up. And the point being made is that I don't think you could say that there is an extreme on one end or the other, where on one extreme you can completely ignore social consensus, and on the other extreme you completely ignore the bridge. The reality is that there's always this sort of middle ground where this power dynamic between the bridge and other actors within the system is constantly changing.
00:32:27.540 - 00:33:24.850, Speaker D: The point is that having the majority of the assets native to all two doesn't mean that the social consensus of those assets will agree with the fork. Let's say if the protocol users will agree, token holders of a certain token might not agree, or USDC might not agree, or Chainlink might not agree. And so it's difficult to quantify how easy it would be to fork only based on the value of the assets deployed. And on top of that, we are completely ignoring arbitrary messages. So for example, if, let's say, a certain l one governance protocol, governance of a certain protocol is being done on the l two. It completely depends on the l two for certain things to be upgraded or whatever, or certain parameters to be changed. Will those people agree with the fork or no? We also have to put value on that.
00:33:25.620 - 00:34:47.070, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm not saying that immediately, assets on l two become distinct from the social consensus pressure of the bridge. There are classes of assets, like the launch of native USDC on arbitrum yesterday is a very clear example of an asset class where it is very distinct from the bridge. That's not to say that the bridge, that USDC doesn't have a massive incentive, a sort of reputational incentive to follow the arbitram bridge, assuming the arbitram bridge is making sort of good upgrades to the system. But if there were some catastrophic event where all of a sudden the arbitrum bridge changes the state transition function so that USDC can just be minted arbitrarily, there's pretty much no chance that circle is going to follow that fork and just allow people to redeem USDC arbitrarily. They're going to make the decision to follow the version of the system where that's not the case. So it's not to say that automatically assets on the l two are independent from the bridge, but that we can't just ignore. We just have to look at the power dynamics, and this is going to be very unique to each individual system.
00:34:48.960 - 00:36:10.040, Speaker A: Can I interject for a second? Well, first of all, I want to say that I do believe layer zero is social consensus, and that's something that, at least within the Celeste community, we say all the time. And so I very much agree with Kelvin's point that blockchains are a tool to automate and sort of encode what we've agreed on via social consensus. And so we can always, no matter what system you build, you can always go back to the root and change things by just getting people together and deciding to fork. But I also know Tokru's side as well, and someone who articulated know, I think, pretty well, Kobe, I think, said this first, and then dankred kind of followed up with a similar tweet, but they basically said, like, oh, you've been lied to. All ERC 20 contracts are actually sovereign, and they can be forked at any time. And so I guess that kind of touches on the idea of, does it become absurd at some point to keep saying that, oh, well, everything comes down to social consensus at the end of the day, so therefore everything is forkable. Where do we go too far in that line of reasoning?
00:36:12.300 - 00:37:33.216, Speaker B: I don't think there's ever a point where it's absurd. I saw those tweets, and I thought it was funny, because the reality is, if you wanted to fork one of these systems, like if you wanted to fork an ERC 20, the code is still there, but the value and the social capital that's sort of attached to the name of that token can easily be. Maybe not easily, right, but can be transferred to another contract. We have to understand that there are clear power dynamics, and we shouldn't lie to ourselves and say that the bridge has less power than it does. I mean, I think today, within the major roll ups, the bridge has an enormous amount of power that probably overpowers anybody else within the system. But just by the nature of these systems and by the fact that you can start to create value that is truly independent from the bridge, and sort of the threat that the bridge has to delete its native assets from your chain, I don't think it's absurd at all to say that those power dynamics will shift for a lot of these systems. Right.
00:37:33.216 - 00:37:52.410, Speaker B: The USDC thing is a shift in the power dynamics within arbitrum and I assume will be the same with other systems. And as time goes, on. There will be other systems that just out the gate already have these power dynamics that are very different and don't fit neatly into one side or the other.
00:37:55.820 - 00:39:20.348, Speaker C: And it has very practical and tangible examples that we can see why this matters and why people need to understand. What social consensus and security assumptions am I opting into when I hold a given asset. And that is one of the things that is legitimately great about rollups is that you can kind of pick and choose between these different assumptions. And one of the examples that I put in the last post that I made, which Patrick had pointed out is like a great example to kind of show this is like Justin sun, which is kind of a funny example, but when he was holding steam during the steam hive hard fork and the chain just decided to hard fork socially and just basically delete all of his money. That is something that you are opting into when you use a chain like that in that system. That would fundamentally not be the case. If you have that exact same scenario and Justin sun is holding a ton of eth on a roll up and it's locked in the bridge, or that's locked in the bridge and that's collateralizing some other position he has on the roll up, then you are not subjecting yourself to any external consensus, but you get to operate in that environment because the roll up could want to take Justin Sun's money in this example and there's nothing they could do because he has his money in the bridge and he is only signing up for the social consensus of Ethereum.
00:39:20.348 - 00:39:56.240, Speaker C: Social consensus of Ethereum wants to fork and delete all of his money in the bridge. They could do that, but you may not want to subject yourself to an additional social consensus, and that is a fundamentally important trade off that people need to be able to understand and pick and choose between. There are often times where you will not want to subject yourself to that kind of social consensus. Or at minimum, you have a real due process in the sense of an on chain governance that you know that you're signing up for of this is what can happen to my assets if I do like. This is the process that I could be subject to that has very meaningful and direct implications.
00:39:58.980 - 00:41:15.064, Speaker A: We have a cameo speaker who just showed up, and I'm excited to have on the mic James Preswich, who has been chiming in on the debate in Twitter and also mean even before this week, in the past, I've had a lot of conversations with him about this topic, and I think he has a really good point of view and particularly one of the things that I wanted to talk about was he had a tweet about basically why he thinks this topic is so controversial, which we did touch on a little bit earlier. But basically James was saying that he asked some fundamental questions that I would love to get his take on. And he said the questions are essentially like, do roll ups actually scale the underlying l one, or are they just a separate chain? What does an ideal data availability layer look like? And do roll ups actually inherit security from the underlying l one? And I think these are very spicy questions because, yeah, they change the way that we perceive roll ups and the relationship to the underlying blockchain that they're built on. James, you want to jump in here and sort of explain your perspective on all this stuff?
00:41:15.262 - 00:41:52.950, Speaker E: Yeah, no problem. I have really quick answers for each of those three points. One is Jersey doesn't scale New York, even though the bridges exist. Two is nobody's ever asked what an ideal data availability system is. Know to some extent celestia Eigen layer. The current dialogue on roll ups is a consequence of asking that question. And for number three, inherit is deliberately chosen to imply a paternalistic relationship.
00:41:52.950 - 00:42:28.880, Speaker E: It makes the roll up subordinate to the host. It is much better to say that the roll up rents data availability or buys data availability. The roll up has the same relationship to the host as any other smart contract. You wouldn't say that. Uniswap inherits from Ethereum. The roll up is buying data availability. The roll up bridge is buying gas with which to verify the roll up state transition to serve users.
00:42:37.480 - 00:42:43.910, Speaker A: I thought Togo was going to say something. I just wanted to say, go to.
00:42:44.680 - 00:42:56.392, Speaker D: Yeah, so a couple of things. Do we actually have a concrete definition of scaling? Because I've heard quite a few versions, and I'm not sure if we actually have it.
00:42:56.446 - 00:43:00.010, Speaker E: Luckily, I have a long history of defining my terms.
00:43:01.660 - 00:43:06.030, Speaker D: I remember your definition of scaling, but I'm not sure if I agree with it.
00:43:08.320 - 00:43:17.920, Speaker E: Well, then I guess if you're saying up front that you don't agree with it, then the answer is no. You already know we don't have an agreed definition of scaling.
00:43:19.300 - 00:43:25.570, Speaker D: No, I just meant to ask whether there is a consensus on whether your definition is correct or not.
00:43:26.120 - 00:43:30.820, Speaker E: I have actually not seen anyone else offer a definition of scaling.
00:43:33.720 - 00:43:40.676, Speaker D: Yeah, that's a good point. People use it quite freely and don't really define it concretely.
00:43:40.788 - 00:44:11.184, Speaker E: Well, this goes back to my point about inherit. People don't define what it means to inherit security. They chose the word for the sense that it creates of a hierarchical paternal family relationship. They didn't define what inherited security is the same way people saying that rollups scale, Ethereum did not define what scaling is. Fair.
00:44:11.382 - 00:44:32.276, Speaker D: So with regards to scaling, you gave an example of Jersey and New York, but another example would be building a new district in a city. That would be scaling of a city. So it depends on what example you pick here. And I feel like with regards to scaling, I would define scaling.
00:44:32.468 - 00:45:33.124, Speaker A: Well, one thing I wanted to just say, james, I really liked about your third point. Thought I never really kind of realized that paternalistic implication of using that phrase. But your point really aligns with within the celestic community we've been saying for a long time, which is like, even when you say l one and l two, it kind of implies this relationship of one chain being the more fundamental or more important of the two. And in general, I feel like that's something that celestia has been trying to push against, is like this idea that roll ups are baby chains, right? And that's why we've been beating the drum about sovereign roll ups for so long is like, to us for a long time. This is very contrarian. We were saying roll ups are their own blockchains in their own right. They're not just some extension of an underlying system, or at least they don't have to be.
00:45:33.124 - 00:46:06.212, Speaker A: And that's so important because again, tying together Kelvin's whole point about social consensus, social consensus is such a huge part of what blockchains are and what makes them powerful and without sovereignty. If your roll up gives up sovereignty, then it's not really a true blockchain. And so it's not as useful. And so even the cosmos community would say like, oh, I don't want to build a roll up because then I'm not a sovereign chain. And we're like, no, it's just as sovereign as your Cosmo stone. Anyway, I really strongly agree with that.
00:46:06.266 - 00:46:41.410, Speaker E: Roll ups are really interesting to talk about because no other category of blockchain has this service provider relationship that roll ups do with their host. I really don't like phrasing it as inherent, but we should look at this as like the roll up is buying from the DA host and the service provider relationship is not a hierarchical, tiered, layer one, layer two relationship. But it is very interesting and it is fundamental to what roll ups are.
00:46:42.820 - 00:46:57.300, Speaker A: Yeah, it's kind of like a smart contract. Is a smart contract inheriting security from Ethereum? Or is it just kind of like when you pay gas, you're paying for Ethereum to scale to secure the smart contract.
00:46:58.200 - 00:47:14.668, Speaker D: I would say it does inherit. You're paying to get some certain properties in return. And it's the same with the roll up. I'm paying the cost of publishing the badge to get certain guarantees in return for that.
00:47:14.754 - 00:47:17.740, Speaker E: I don't think paid for an inheritance.
00:47:21.520 - 00:47:21.932, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:47:21.986 - 00:47:28.290, Speaker D: Okay. But you do pay taxes, though, under inheritance. Does that count?
00:47:30.260 - 00:47:40.496, Speaker A: Anyway, I don't think we need to talk about. I don't think we have to go into the details about the definition of inherent or whatever. John Kelvin, I'm curious.
00:47:40.528 - 00:47:54.520, Speaker E: Yeah, sorry to talk over you guys, John and Kelvin. Definitions are critical to what we're doing. If you can't define the term, you can't understand what's going on. Semantics is the purpose of having these discussions.
00:47:56.300 - 00:47:57.050, Speaker A: True.
00:47:57.660 - 00:47:59.130, Speaker C: One small thing.
00:48:02.540 - 00:48:03.000, Speaker D: Whatever.
00:48:03.070 - 00:48:04.940, Speaker A: Go ahead. All right, I'll go quickly.
00:48:05.010 - 00:49:31.960, Speaker B: I mean, I fully agree with a lot of this. I think we need to take the opportunity to look at the properties and kind of step away from definitions and just look very clearly at the properties sort of abstracted from the definitions. It's fully correct to say that what roll ups are doing, and what is interesting about roll ups is that they are buying these properties, ordering, and possibly also data availability from another consensus mechanism. And that is a valuable thing because consensus is hard and consensus is annoying. And if you can rely on another system, right, it is a valuable thing to have. But just practically looking at what that gives you, that gives you ordering, that gives you data availability when you say it inherits security, what are you really saying? I think when we say that word or we say that phrase, there's this sort of implication that the sort of value of the assets or the information on these systems is inherently also as secure as what you would expect on the parent chain. And that's not true by default.
00:49:31.960 - 00:50:03.360, Speaker B: I really strongly disagree with this statement, but I think there's a really important opportunity just to talk and spend some time reviewing the observed properties, and then over the next couple of months trying to come up with new definitions that really clearly describe the observed properties rather than what has happened, which is that the definitions came for, the words came first, and we kind of observed the properties afterwards.
00:50:06.500 - 00:51:34.684, Speaker C: Yeah. One small thing I would add on this kind of conversation, because I do think it is very important, this kind of like, relativistic or paternalistic type relationship, and tying that to what we actually observe, which can be fuzzy at times, but I think we practically can observe. I mean, this is the simple reason why I used the words l one and l two in the way that I did in the post of not saying it's the perfect definition, but at least for me, I think it was actually very helpful in framing the way that I'm thinking about these things, more or less using those kind of terms as like, what is the ledger of record for this given asset, whether it's USDC, it's ethereum, it's eth, it's optimism, et cetera? That is an important relationship to understand, is very observable in that if I have bridged eth on optimism, I think we can all agree it's quite observable that the value of that is tied to the fact that there's some ethereum locked in the bridge on the l one. If the bridge gets hacked on that roll up and all the eth disappears, I think we can pretty confidently say the value of that bridged eth is going to go down a lot, because now it's completely under collateralized. People were holding that thing in recognition of the fact that I have this eth underlying it, and that is what derives its value from. So that's why I used the l one and l two in these very relativistic ways in which a chain could be an l one and l two kind of simultaneously, and people can modify the definition. You use it, however, but it does capture that very relativistic relationship.
00:51:34.684 - 00:52:29.330, Speaker C: Where is ethereum really an l one or roll up really an l one for native USDC that is deployed on that chain? If we all have the very clear and measurable understanding that this thing has value, because circle has some dollars in the bank account and they say my coin has value. If circle decides that, never mind, we're not going to honor this thing anymore, and you're not getting your money back from the bank account, the value of that asset is going to go to zero. That is a very clear and important relativistic relationship. Just to understand what is the relative power between these different chains, and who are we trusting in these different relationships? It's not necessarily the perfect way to frame them or anything, but just understanding that relationship between all of these different entities that are all interacting with each other is fundamentally important to understand.
00:52:31.380 - 00:53:48.090, Speaker D: I feel like it's not quite correct to define l ones and l two s from the perspective of the assets, because the definitions used before, like for example, in Patrick's paper from 2019 on layer twos, the definition was more from the perspective of the l one, and the same applies for l two b. So l two b defines the l air two from the perspective of an l one. So essentially, you can have an asset that is natively deployed on an l two, but it's still an l two, because you can essentially run an l one full node and be ensured that the l two is running correctly, assuming that the proof system works correctly, of course. So that's an additional assumption, and that's why we call them trust minimized. But it's difficult to define a given asset based on whether it's native or not, because there are a lot of things that play a role here. So, for example, what if my l two asset is locked and requires a message from the l one to be unlocked, but it's still native to l two? Do we consider that to be an l one, or is that an l two?
00:53:50.540 - 00:54:41.630, Speaker E: I do want to push back on that proof oriented look at security. The l one can never know whether the proof system is working correctly, because it does not know the state that the proof system purports to prove. It can know that some subset of the state conforms to the proof system, or it can know that the proof system has halted, but it cannot know whether the proof system corresponds to the entire roll up state, and therefore, you cannot have that guarantee that the roll up is functioning correctly. You can have some level of confidence about some portion of the roll up state.
00:54:44.240 - 00:55:59.344, Speaker B: Yeah, I think another important point here is that this is always from the perspective of an observer who chooses a particular state transition function. You don't have universal. An important point here is that these things are not absolute when we're talking about what is the real op mainet? What is the real arbitram? We're talking about the sort of social thing that we've created, and people could fork off and say that, okay, now, this is the real arbitram. But somebody, what the bridge gives you is a view of a particular state transition function. And that state transition function may not be the, quote, real arbitram, in the sense that it's not the thing that everybody in the world is calling arbitram, but it is a specific state transition function. But it's not universal, right? You can't say that the bridge gives you universal access to the thing called arbitram. And it will always be the case that what the bridge reflects is the thing that we socially refer to as arbitram.
00:55:59.344 - 00:56:10.020, Speaker B: That's just not true. It could very well be the case that the thing that we socially refer to as arbitrum is completely different than what the bridge observes.
00:56:11.160 - 00:56:30.652, Speaker D: Well, neither does your full node, one full node either you just don't know which other fork exists back then, but you are aware of the specific state of a specific fork. That doesn't mean that every single participant of the social consensus agrees that's the canonical fork. So the same argument applies here.
00:56:30.786 - 00:56:51.430, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. But I just wanted to push back against the sense that you have trustless access to by running an l one node, you have trustless access to the thing that we socially refer to as x, y, or z. Right. You have access to enforcement over a particular state transition function.
00:56:53.800 - 00:58:04.216, Speaker A: So I like this sort of line of conversation, but I want to tie things back a little bit more to real systems, and I think we are getting closer to the end of our time. And specifically, one of the questions I wanted to revisit was this question of what does an ideal da layer look like? Because for a long. Obviously, this is something that is a question that's very close to our hearts at Celestia, and something that we've thought about very, you know, one of the major design decisions of celestia from the early days is to not include settlement. So there is no smart contract environment. There is no way to have an enshrined bridge with Celestia at the moment. And we felt strongly that was the right decision because it just didn't seem like settlement was something that was like a nice to have, but not a must have. And the overhead of adding execution to the underlying DA adds overhead to every roll up that wants to use it.
00:58:04.216 - 00:58:40.680, Speaker A: And so it was just not worth it. Going more minimal was really the right approach in our minds. So I'm curious. And we used to get a lot of, I would say, criticism for that. They're like, oh, well, there's no way to settle on Celestia. So it's, like, unusable, you know what I mean? And so I'm curious if this debate sort of shifts that perspective front of you, or, like, what do you think the ideal Da layer actually looks like? And is settlement a big part of that, or is it not as important? I want to open up that conversation.
00:58:41.580 - 00:59:35.690, Speaker D: I feel like it depends on a specific use case. So for Ethereum, the DAE layer is specifically added to make the cost of publishing the data for the roll ups that are bridging to the underlying layer cheaper. Whereas for celestia, for example, the whole idea of DA is used for a different reason. It's basically used to provide some guarantees to the chains that don't want to bootstrap all their security from the ground up. So I like to use this example, and I know James is going to push back on this, is that rollups on Ethereum are deployed to scale Ethereum, whereas on celestia the roll ups are deployed in order to borrow some security from celestia. So the use cases are a bit different.
00:59:44.660 - 01:00:37.090, Speaker C: I mostly agree with that, actually. I do think it's use case dependent. I mean, there's obviously certain technical properties of like, yeah, you want a lot of data availability, ideally validity provable, or HR encoding, et cetera, like that, you know, things quickly, censorship, resistance, all that kind of stuff. But the practical reality is, yeah, different roll ups have different needs and they will want and optimize for different things. If your roll up explicitly wants. Hey, we want to tap into all of the users of Ethereum and we have all these users that want to use ETH in a different place, in a trust minimized way, well then the way that Ethereum works is great for them. If someone has no concern for the base layer assets at all and don't care about tapping into users and liquidity, then yeah, there's no reason for them to have another settlement layer there, whatever that means.
01:00:37.090 - 01:00:48.970, Speaker C: That is just like adding overhead or clogging up the chain or anything like that. It's just not useful to them. So for different use cases, they're going to optimize probably for potentially different things.
01:00:50.300 - 01:01:46.360, Speaker E: When talking about ETH as a good DA layer, we always come back to this implicit assumption that users will want trust minimized bridges. Not just bridges, but trust minimized bridges. This is the distinguishing factor for Ethereum compared to other DA environments, and I don't know if that assumption holds. I think that the majority of users have expressed a preference for non trust minimized bridges, and that's likely to continue being the case going forward. I think that CCTP is going to be a much more important bridge than the optimism or arbitrum token bridge from an ecosystem perspective and from a user perspective.
01:01:50.780 - 01:01:53.610, Speaker A: Spicy. Kelvin, what's your take?
01:01:59.180 - 01:03:27.796, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it's interesting. There is an obvious use to these types of bridges. It is a unique property that you can have when you use Ethereum as a data availability layer because you share access to the ordering and consensus. The practical use case is that you have pretty strong guarantees about bridged assets, right? That's like a valuable thing that you can have, and so you have access to an enormous amount of liquidity in users that already exist on Ethereum. As to whether or not people want these trust minimized bridges I'm in the camp that there are plenty of institutional, very risk averse people who do want this and for whom this is still not true. Right. These bridges are still not good enough to get this kind of movement between the systems.
01:03:27.796 - 01:03:40.924, Speaker B: But of course, it is correct to say that something like a native USDC bridge starts to change that formula because you are sort of no longer reliant on the bridge in this very direct way.
01:03:41.122 - 01:03:49.920, Speaker E: An institutional user is much more likely to choose circles CCTP than it is to choose arbitrary optimism. Token bridge.
01:03:52.580 - 01:03:54.000, Speaker A: For USDC.
01:03:54.580 - 01:03:55.330, Speaker E: Yes.
01:03:56.420 - 01:04:08.292, Speaker A: So I think also, one point to keep in mind here too, is that at least to date, none of these bridges, l one, l two bridges are trust minimized. Right? They all have.
01:04:08.346 - 01:04:09.720, Speaker D: I was about to say this.
01:04:09.790 - 01:04:11.512, Speaker A: Yeah, maybe that's also.
01:04:11.566 - 01:04:13.128, Speaker D: Except fuel v one.
01:04:13.294 - 01:04:21.850, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. Fuel v one. Tm. Yeah, go ahead.
01:04:22.300 - 01:04:50.356, Speaker D: No, I was just saying it's difficult to say whether the users have voiced their preference or not, because the only trust minimized bridge that we currently have has $8 on it, and it's a payment only roll up. So, yeah, once we have more established infrastructure that is actually trust minimized, then it will be much easier to tell. But right now, it's just a guessing game at this point.
01:04:50.538 - 01:05:55.704, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's very fair. And just an interesting thing that I want to note, at least related to Celestia, is that although we currently do not have any way to support a trust minimized bridge to any of the rollouts built on top of celestia, we had Mustafa posted an idea in our forum recently about how we can actually bake that in in a really state minimized way, using ZK rollups and having a verification opcode on Celestia. So anyway, what's really interesting is that the funny thing is that the motivation for doing that had nothing to do with providing settlement for roll ups built on top of celestia. But actually it's kind of the reverse, is that we realized that there might be demand for a trust minimized bridge for the celestia token up to the roll ups. And so it's funny because, I don't know, just like the opposite of what people were complaining. Oh, Celestia. It's like you need settlement for the roll ups, but actually Celestia needs that capability more for itself, in a sense.
01:05:55.704 - 01:06:46.170, Speaker A: So it's kind of like this ironic twist of fate, in my view. I again want to kind of keep things on the topic of the way that these ideas will actually change the systems that we build and we're also kind of running up on time. So it's kind of like a last question. We have Toguro from Scroll and also Kelvin as part of the optimism team, both building roll ups. And I'm curious, in light of this debate and this conversation, is there anything that you guys are going to change about the architecture of your roll ups? Know, potentially make them skew more sovereign? Like will there be peer to peer gossiping of fraud or validity proofs or just in general, how does this change the way that you guys think about what you guys are building?
01:06:58.550 - 01:07:55.510, Speaker D: Do you want to go or should I go? All right, I'll go. We've been discussing peer to peer propagation of proofs for quite a long time. I'm not sure if there's a lot of benefit right now because it takes quite a non negligible amount of time to produce a proof right now. So the benefits skewed towards optimistic rollouts because it makes more sense for them right now. But I feel like at some point, once the proof systems get efficient enough where proofs can be propagated quite fast, I feel like it would make sense to propagate the proofs prior to publishing them and verifying them on chain because then you can have stronger confirmation off chain confirmation than you can get right now. But we're still quite a long way away from that being necessary.
01:08:01.530 - 01:09:01.500, Speaker B: It, yeah, I don't think there's anything that I'm going to change today with a lot of this stuff. Part of it obviously is op mainnet is the way it is, and there are a lot of systems building on top of the op stack that are making very similar assumptions and creating very similar architectures and relying on ethereum in this way for those systems. I'm more interested in just observing how this shift of the dynamics of social consensus happens over time. But I'm much more interested in this from the perspective of new potential systems that make completely different assumptions and sort of the space that you have available to you to design within that.
01:09:04.190 - 01:09:59.546, Speaker A: Very fair. Yeah. Coming from putting my celestial hat on, essentially we really believe strongly that users should be directly verifying chains. And so to me that's why we push so hard on this idea of people running light nodes and making the hardware requirements extremely minimal and all that. And I think part of that is peer to peer fraud proofs. I mean, I guess it's not necessary, but I personally find that model of verifying in a peer to peer nature just more philosophically lined. So anyway, I hope more roll ups kind of move in that direction, because I think a lot of the roll ups to date have been sort of based around this more smart contract model of security and sort of using that as a central point of their network.
01:09:59.546 - 01:10:21.830, Speaker A: Anyway, so I want to wrap things up. I guess we can go around and everyone can give their final thoughts or takeaways or last messages for the audience and just tell us what you think, where things are at, where should we go from here? What are the most important things that you want people to take away from this conversation?
01:10:27.930 - 01:12:09.880, Speaker C: So for me, I'll just quickly mention some of the important kind of upshots of this one is obviously what you're talking about at just a simple technical level, like people kind of reevaluating. What does it mean to really settle? In other words, how are we distributing proofs and making different observers aware of that and realizing that there is a different space that you can work in where you could distribute them p to p, you could post them to a bridge, you can have multiple different chains which have a validating bridge that you're, quote unquote, settling to. There's all different kinds of contracts there. And then also the very kind of bigger things relate to kind of just the changing kind of like power dynamics and how we think about this. In particular, a lot of what James was mentioning seems highly likely that native USDC and CCTP, something like that, is going to probably grow quite meaningfully and probably not even take that long to do that. And that has meaningful implications both on just safety perspectives for users, but also just who is actually controlling the different assets in these chains and just having a better understanding of what influence does circle have over a different role? What is fundamentally the task of on chain governance that is controlling this bridge? What are they actually tasked with and what power do they have versus what is the social consensus responsible for and what opt out do they have in this system? And that's going to look very different in different systems. So just understanding the interplay and the actual responsibilities of different parties in those as new chains look very different is just like a fundamentally important thing that I think we need to think a lot about on that kind of governance and social consensus level.
01:12:12.830 - 01:12:18.170, Speaker A: Beautifully said. James Togroll.
01:12:22.750 - 01:13:15.520, Speaker E: For me, I don't build roll ups. I work on a bunch of different things in the space. And all of these semantic arguments on Twitter are about truth seeking, is if you're not going to evaluate and reevaluate your prior knowledge about technical systems as they evolve and progress, and as the dialogue in the space evolves, you will not understand what is going on. Understanding roll ups is going to be critical to the next 2345 years of this space. And if you get stuck in the legacy understanding of roll ups as a client state of another blockchain, you're going to get very confused over the next couple of years.
01:13:20.660 - 01:13:27.520, Speaker A: Could not agree more. Kelvin, give us your closing thoughts.
01:13:30.260 - 01:13:57.070, Speaker D: Yeah, I don't know. I feel like we're going to continue having this debate and arguments for quite a long time, especially since the space is progressing quite fast and every other week someone's coming up with some new idea and some new construction that changes the way we see things. And so, yeah, it's just you're probably going to hear us and see us arguing on Twitter for quite a long time.
01:14:01.600 - 01:14:14.050, Speaker B: I guess my only statement, know, live in nuance, understand nuanced reality and be comfortable with it.
01:14:16.980 - 01:14:57.008, Speaker A: Nice. Some real wisdom. Well, thank you guys all for coming. I mean, there's still so much more to talk about, and I think the Twitter debates will continue. But ultimately what's great is we can all disagree on certain aspects of this, but the more we talk, hopefully the further and refined these ideas become and the clearer they get. And, and I really appreciate that you guys and a lot of other people have been engaging in this conversation twitterverse and sharing your knowledge and advancing the conversation. So thanks for coming on and, yeah, we'll see you on the, the.
