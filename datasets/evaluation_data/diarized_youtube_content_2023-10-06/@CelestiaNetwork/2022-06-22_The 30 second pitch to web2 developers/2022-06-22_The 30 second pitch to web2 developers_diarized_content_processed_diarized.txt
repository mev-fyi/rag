00:00:00.410 - 00:00:27.990, Speaker A: Let's suppose each of you were kind of stuck in an elevator for 30 seconds. You had a 32nd pitch, and there was an engineer who just quit Netflix because, well, I mean, stock price crashed and they're like, I want to understand why I should build something either on Salana or Celestia. What's your 32nd pitch? Edge and Mustafa me.
00:00:28.140 - 00:01:41.920, Speaker B: Okay, so this former Netflix engineer is presumably a web two engineer. So I would use a web two analogy. If you're a web two engineer and you wanted to build a web application, you wouldn't want to build it on a shared hosting provider, like, let's say, if you're familiar with dreamhost or geocities or Google pages. If you use a shared web hosting provider, you're restricted in what you can deploy because you're stuck with the same execution environment that's provided to you by that shared execution provider, and also because you're sharing the same server as everyone else. You're also limited in scalability. That is very similar to deploying your application on a shared smart contract platform that is a monolithic blockchain. Nowadays, web two developers build use virtual machines on systems like Amazon, EC two or AWS, and that allows those developers to have their own virtual server and have full control over the execution environment and scalability of the application.
00:01:41.920 - 00:02:00.700, Speaker B: And that is what building a roll up is like. You effectively have your own blockchain that you can do whatever you like on it and have any execution environment you want on it, and you can scale better because you're not sharing the same execution resource pricing as everyone else. And.
