00:00:05.290 - 00:00:26.322, Speaker A: Hello. Hello. I think this is on. Great to be here, everyone. Appreciate everyone attending and a big shout out to Celestia and Maven Eleven for putting this on. Had the privilege of attending last year as well, and by far one of my favorite events I've had the privilege of joining. So I'm excited to lead this panel today about, really some great perspectives about invest seen in the modular ecosystem.
00:00:26.322 - 00:00:33.030, Speaker A: So want to throw it down the line, but first, my name is Joe, I invest in the space and. Yeah, happy to let these guys introduce themselves.
00:00:33.180 - 00:00:45.100, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm Matais, I'm one of the partners at Maven Eleven. I think we were the first investor or backer of Celestia, and I hope therefore, we help the modular movement move forward a little bit.
00:00:45.950 - 00:01:05.730, Speaker C: That works. Yeah, I'm Yuri. I think together with Maven. Actually, we're the first investor. We're the second, I guess, right after you guys, when we called Leisure Ledger. We're a little bit different, I guess, as a vc. So maybe have a different perspective here because we look at the blockchain space, not specifically as blockchain, but we have a broader perspective on a better Internet, let's say.
00:01:05.730 - 00:01:11.214, Speaker C: So hopefully get a different perspective here between the more crypto vcs.
00:01:11.262 - 00:01:12.020, Speaker A: That's great.
00:01:13.190 - 00:01:30.470, Speaker D: Kelvin here, investment associate Spartan. I guess we're the third investor, Celeste, after you guys. So, yeah, we've been investing since 2017 and looking into more modular space starting in 2019. And, yeah, we've been fairly involved pretty recently as well.
00:01:30.540 - 00:01:48.814, Speaker A: That's great, guys. I think how I liked setting this conversation last year when I had the privilege of moderating, is kind of getting some context into your guys history in the space. I know you shared a little bit about it, but maybe quickly, what was maybe the first project, you kind of recall giving you some of the inklings of kind of where the modular narrative is today. And maybe what's one of the more recent ones as well.
00:01:48.932 - 00:02:14.360, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the first one, easy shout there is Celestia, but I think maybe the sort of plasma or even lighting network on bitcoin, you could argue that it moves execution off chain. Currently the most recent one, I won't name any portfolio company, but I think Eclipse is doing pretty cool. I think it's cool to see that they bring the Solana VM to another ecosystem, which sort of shows the power of moving that execution off.
00:02:17.370 - 00:02:49.666, Speaker C: We went with celestials the first time we saw something really different from after, like bitcoin, Ethereum, and it became clear that there's something happening where you have to actually modularize or split certain functions, and we're kind of moving slow in that direction. So we're looking now at what's happening out there. So, with all the decentralized sequencer with intent based architectures, with roll ups, obviously, and then rollers with services, and just looking at that from a tech perspective, like, okay, when is the next time something comes up that's so big that splits again in a way, right, where you need to really modularize in such a way that it scales up again?
00:02:49.848 - 00:02:54.930, Speaker A: What's maybe like a recent project you've heard of that kind of maybe fits into some of those narratives, or one that you're following.
00:02:55.510 - 00:03:14.966, Speaker C: I'm following a couple of projects that I talked yesterday with Austria guys as well. I'm kind of interested, really, in the decentralized sequences, not because they're right now interesting to us, but I think they're a big thing once rollers become a little bit more thriving. Right. Once you have this happening around more, there will actually be a thing where, say, okay, what is the next bottleneck that might break? And that might be one of those things.
00:03:15.068 - 00:03:17.830, Speaker A: Cool. I'm excited to chat some more about that in a little bit. And Calvin, what about yourself?
00:03:17.900 - 00:03:59.782, Speaker D: Yeah, and so that's definitely one the first projects that actually piqued my interest in the module space as well. So back in 2021, started looking into it. It's interesting how such a minimalistic design chain could align so well with the ethos of censorship resistant blockchain. Celeste is definitely one of the first. That's like the pioneer in the space as well. For a more recent project like Yuri just mentioned, with the proliferation of roll up roll ups in the space, I've been thinking more into the permissionlessness of moving liquidity across these roll ups. Right.
00:03:59.782 - 00:04:13.882, Speaker D: So an example that project that we got involved in is called catalyst. So essentially, it's a liquidity layer across all these roll ups that allows users to transfer value natively across these.
00:04:14.016 - 00:04:38.798, Speaker A: Yeah, it'll definitely be an interesting challenge. I think that we'll probably get into a little bit during this conversation as well, when it comes to maybe some of the trade offs and modularity as well. Yeah, I think I would also just love to kind of understand. We kind of hinted at it a little bit there as far as some of the recent projects that you guys are following. But when we think back to maybe twelve or 14 months ago in Amsterdam, what are some of the things that are, like, top of mind as far as what has changed specifically in that period of time.
00:04:38.984 - 00:05:24.658, Speaker B: Yeah, I think back then it was sort of like, okay, da and roll ups, that's all there is to the modular ecosystem. And since then, a few big trends, optimism, arbitram obviously taking off in a big way, also getting traction on the application level, which I think is very key. And we all talk about infrastructure here all day, but it does actually matter that we have users using these things. I think that's sort of validation of the thesis that roll ups will scale more. And then obviously, on the more technical or experimental side, you have things like modular mev, so cross chain Mev, intent based architectures. Aditi just talked about that. And I think developments like sovereign rollups, which sovereign labs is obviously working on, are also, like, in that bucket of new experimental ideas that we love to see.
00:05:24.744 - 00:05:27.710, Speaker A: Got it. And what about maybe Calvin will go to you and then to Yuri.
00:05:27.870 - 00:05:29.054, Speaker D: Sorry, can you repeat the question?
00:05:29.112 - 00:05:35.190, Speaker A: Yeah, maybe. Trends that you've seen over the last twelve to 14 months specifically, that have very much piqued your interest in the modular space.
00:05:35.340 - 00:06:03.534, Speaker D: Absolutely. So I think Ras service, so similar to what Matthias just mentioned as well, we've been seeing a lot of these getting competitive in space different ways, solving the same problem as well. I think DA is also something that's interesting. So, aside from Celestia, we're seeing obviously other DA solutions in the market, whether it's avail or Eigen. Da. Great.
00:06:03.572 - 00:06:05.854, Speaker A: And Yuri, maybe anything to add to that before we move on?
00:06:05.972 - 00:06:19.926, Speaker C: Yeah, I agree with the guys. Also, Ras is kind of the easy way to think about. Once you think about, there might be many roll ups, right? You need somebody to deploy them. So there's a service that's kind of an easy idea. Let's say, not easy to actually realize, but it's an easy idea to think about.
00:06:20.108 - 00:06:37.558, Speaker A: Maybe to add to that a little bit, I'd love for you to maybe dig in on if you have any opinions on maybe some of the economics that exist at that layer. I know I've heard maybe a variety of perspectives on how sufficiently those businesses or protocols can kind of bootstrap the economic considerations around where they sit in the stack. So, free to anyone to answer, but I'm curious.
00:06:37.654 - 00:06:42.060, Speaker B: I think we all have opinions on this one. You want to go first or shall I?
00:06:42.590 - 00:06:43.546, Speaker C: Go ahead.
00:06:43.728 - 00:07:29.766, Speaker B: I think one sort of thing we hear a lot now is abundant block space. So all these DA solutions that we hear about are like, oh, there will be so much block space that it won't really be valuable anymore. Whereas I think there is a big difference in the quality of block space, whether that's liquidity, on that verifiability of that block space, which obviously light clients play a big role in. So that's something where the value accrual will definitely happen, in my opinion, on the most valuable block space that a user can easily verify, there's a lot of liquidity on it, or mvp extractable on it, which could be interchangeable, and that you can easily deploy different roll ups on. And that's, I think also interesting that on Ethereum you still often deploy EVM roll ups, whereas on Celestia you'll probably see a proliferation of different virtual machines.
00:07:29.798 - 00:07:34.186, Speaker A: A little bit of a bias for other execution, of course, you're anything out of that.
00:07:34.368 - 00:08:09.798, Speaker C: Yeah, I think the biggest gravity at the moment, maybe it's the bear market based liquidity. It's fun to see if you even look at autobiograph and you think TLV, for example, of the rollups. It's strange why, for example, arbitram optimus doesn't have more of it and more of it, especially after the breakdown last year, moved again to Mainnet. Maybe this is the quality of the blockchain space and you have more security or more battle testedness of the main net. You just trust it more. I'm not sure, but seems to be like, why isn't going more up, right? Why isn't going more to roll ups to do something? Because aven units have all of this there, right? So the basic stuff basically we're using.
00:08:09.884 - 00:08:20.166, Speaker B: I think we discussed this one earlier or sometime ago as well, right? If I leave my assets somewhere for ten years, I'm not going to do it on the roll up. For now, I will just use Ethereum, mainet or bitcoin.
00:08:20.278 - 00:08:39.694, Speaker C: Exactly. How do you solve that? And apart about to a certain degree, maybe you need some sort of tool or a company or protocol that only exists on the role, like GMX, for example, on arbitram. And around that it slowly will build around ecosystem, and then only it becomes as trustable as a mainet.
00:08:39.742 - 00:09:15.306, Speaker A: Yeah, maybe to kind of add to that and maybe pose another question to you guys. I think it actually might be like one of the trade offs that probably is under discussed in this space specifically, which is to what degree? With some of these new implementations, with these new configurations of blockchains, can institutions or potentially more advanced, larger liquidity holders actually underwrite the risk associated with these architectures? So maybe we can pose that question to you guys. How do you as investors kind of underwrite that process? Kind of the activation energy, or potentially some people would use the word lendingness that has to develop in order to accrue or attract that liquidity.
00:09:15.498 - 00:09:51.906, Speaker B: Yeah, I think for us, as venture investments, venture investors, we can underwrite that, because we sort of do need to take a lot of risk to get the returns we aim for. But as like an institutional, I don't know, debt fund allocating in DeFi or something, I understand that they see more risk in experimental projects that are now going live in the modular space, et cetera, and they would maybe rather stick with a more mature defi stack on Ethereum. So I think there you just need to prove yourself over time that you are there to stay and that they can allocate. So it's about sort of the risk appetite of the investor.
00:09:52.098 - 00:10:01.970, Speaker A: Anything from you guys, as far as, I don't know, maybe how you as investors, kind of at least attempt to underwrite some of the risk that these more modular, configurable systems or architectures can introduce.
00:10:02.070 - 00:10:36.774, Speaker D: Yeah, for sure. So when it comes to assessing different projects, I can actually use perhaps like a DA layer. So there's several ways we can assess this, right? So obviously, DA is a function of cost as well as transaction count. So you can do certain projections, right, given how much, I guess, revenue that the DA layer could actually make, and then you add on a premium to it, and you can actually have thinking like how they could actually monetize on top of it.
00:10:36.812 - 00:10:51.510, Speaker A: So you think of it from more of maybe an economic security perspective or kind of. Where are you going with that? As far as. Sorry, you're thinking of it more in relation to the economic security perspective of that sort of a thing would help an investor, maybe like a liquid fund, better underwrite the risk of a modular architecture.
00:10:51.590 - 00:10:53.680, Speaker D: Yeah, I think that certainly will help.
00:10:54.930 - 00:11:15.410, Speaker A: Matthias, I think one thing we had chatted a lot about is kind of like some of the different founder types that we see specifically in the modular space. Would love to maybe throw it to you guys, as far as, are there things that stand out about the types of individuals that you've had the privilege to support and invest in that are building in the space? Maybe unique characteristics, maybe bad things, who knows?
00:11:15.750 - 00:11:47.850, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm happy to take some, since we've backed quite a few founders in this domain. I think right now what you see is it's usually quite tech heavy people, and they like to be sort of nerd sniped. So they like to think about ideas that are complex and that easily change as they move along. So they also need to be flexible in their architecture. I think that's sort of the current founder type you see in the space. I do expect that to sort of change over the next three to four years to also more consumer facing, more commercial, business minded people who just want to build an end product for users.
00:11:47.930 - 00:11:51.600, Speaker A: What do you think that shift will be like a byproduct ever? What do you think will cause that?
00:11:52.130 - 00:12:08.146, Speaker B: I think just maturity of the tech stack, right. I think to some degree so that they don't need to worry about the trade off of mev prevention or an intent or not. Right. I think somebody who just wants to build a good user app doesn't want to care about what sort of transaction type there is.
00:12:08.328 - 00:12:46.240, Speaker A: Maybe I pivot this question to you guys as well. When it comes to I think everyone kind of agrees on this kind of opinion in the zeitgeist that everyone is focusing on infra, there's probably not enough people focusing on applications. What are some of the things maybe that you guys are impressed by when it comes to making some of these stacks more accessible? We have mentioned some of the roll ups as the service providers, but I think whether it's like net new execution environments opening up the doors for developers from other ecosystems to come into web three, is there maybe a specific highlight of those categories that you think make this technology more approachable for application and potentially consumer developers as well?
00:12:46.710 - 00:13:38.798, Speaker C: I think actually what's really cool about the modular, let's say mindset is not that you built modular, but the way that you're not locked in into an ecosystem, especially through a token, right? So I tried to run around Berlin and talk to people at wise and people collaborating more together. There are a bunch of different ecosystems there. And somebody mentioned to me, well, when you develop something in your ecosystem, the incentive is really still develop it in your ecosystem because you develop it outside, well they're profit from it, right? So unintentionally the token provides a barrier for collaboration certain degree, because the Benz so big already, modelerism doesn't have that, because you can collaborate very rather easily, everything is more aligned. So the room for experimentation, the whole environment is way better. So what you have is really that there's a lot of people building really cool stuff out there and they're just trying to figure out how to combine it recombines and so on. But a lot of great ideas coming out of that. And one of these great ideas is that you for example, can abstract away the token.
00:13:38.798 - 00:13:59.206, Speaker C: I think Nick mentioned that two days ago on the ZK day that you can actually build directly something on Celestia and don't have a token. This is a good thing because developers don't have to be financial anymore, they can just start building, which is really cool on the application users in the end. Right? So those kind of thinking is way more free and running more free and doing more experiments in the modular space. It's also about the founders who are really mindseted like that.
00:13:59.308 - 00:14:29.746, Speaker A: I don't know, we might have some people start sweating in the room when we start hearing no tokens. But another thing I'd like to post to you guys, I'm quite curious specifically maybe on Calvin and Matthias's perspective on what are you bearish about in the modular ecosystem? Are there specific things that you think are currently discussed or a lot of people are excited about that? Maybe specifically as an investor you aren't that interested in, or maybe even intellectually or from a product market fit perspective you think doesn't have a chance or you're not as excited about.
00:14:29.928 - 00:14:59.562, Speaker D: Yeah, so I guess I can just quickly take this. Yeah, so that's a very good question. I think moving forward there's going to be a challenge when it comes to justifying valuation. So I feel like during the bear market, a lot of people are looking to infrastructure that squeeze up all the valuation. And in order to justify these valuations, depending on what you build, fees might eventually compress in the future. So you'll have to find other ways to accrue value to what you're building. Right.
00:14:59.562 - 00:15:05.758, Speaker D: So perhaps owning more of the vertical stack, that's how you accrue more value.
00:15:05.924 - 00:15:09.370, Speaker A: Also bearish on high valuations. Matthias, I'm curious to hear your thoughts.
00:15:09.450 - 00:15:52.510, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't know if I agree with the fees point. I think sort of fees will compress per user, but the sum of fees that we collect on the infrastructure as a whole I hope will increase as we onboard more users. Sort of the bare case for modular crypto, I think is either the complexity that you add by sort of incorporating all these different systems together, so if one of them breaks, that might not be good. And overall maybe, but that's a larger bear case on crypto that people just don't really care about. End user verification. So a large part of building a modular blockchain with data availability sampling is that everybody can run a light node very easily. I mean, we see the people from Celestia especially do it everywhere.
00:15:52.510 - 00:16:02.640, Speaker B: But ultimately the assumption there is that people do want to run a light node and verify this thing themselves, whereas maybe, well, they just don't do that.
00:16:03.250 - 00:16:05.226, Speaker A: Do you think people want to run light clients?
00:16:05.338 - 00:16:13.470, Speaker B: Yeah, I think otherwise you shouldn't be in crypto, but it's sort of why you built on the blockchain, right? You want to be able to verify it, otherwise you can just use excel sheet.
00:16:13.550 - 00:17:08.494, Speaker A: It reminds me of the accessibility point that we mentioned earlier. Maybe earlier we were talking about the accessibility for developers with external skill sets from crypto. But when you think about from a retail perspective, maybe what some of the purists who have grown up in this industry really kind of prioritizes is really ensuring that these networks can be robust. And a huge part of that is ensuring that you have a culture that exists around these blockchains of verifying state and having individuals capable of doing that. But maybe one thing I would pose to the group is I'm kind of convinced that we have to, in the same way we have to build modular execution environments, et cetera, to make it more accessible to developers. I think if we want people to care about verifiability, we have to make it almost as easy as wearing a wristwatch to tell the time in order to actually see wide adoption. So maybe counter that if you guys steal, man, that perspective, even as like a validator, I actually agree with the perspective.
00:17:08.542 - 00:17:40.826, Speaker B: Right. And I do think people care about it. So that's sort of in your question, like Wilde. I fundamentally do think so, because the most valuable sort of crypto networks also have that culture of running their own full nodes, right? Bitcoiners go mad if you make it slightly harder to run a bitcoin full node. The whole block size debate was about that. And Ethereum also puts in a lot of work into making it easy and accessible for everybody, like all over the world, with not a lot of money for hardware to run a full node. Obviously you have trade offs, but I do think that's what matters.
00:17:40.826 - 00:17:45.338, Speaker B: So that's also why I'm pretty bullish on being able to verify it yourself quite easily.
00:17:45.434 - 00:17:52.606, Speaker A: Maybe a question in the room. How many of you guys have ever run like a full node on a network? Or maybe you're even have tried or attempted to run a light clock?
00:17:52.638 - 00:17:54.100, Speaker B: They're going to counter my points.
00:17:54.710 - 00:18:02.040, Speaker A: Kudos to all of you. Everyone else, homework, at least give it a try. I really encourage everyone to give it a try.
00:18:02.810 - 00:18:38.626, Speaker C: I think maybe there's a difference in how you phrase, especially if you go outside the blockchain space, a general blockchain space where everybody's kind of excited about the tech, what does it mean to care about running a light client, for example? Right? I think people do care about a lot of things, but they have like, let's say I care about it for 2 seconds, right? If you give it two second to me and I'm able to do it into seconds, I do care. If it takes me 10 seconds, I will not care. Right? So there's a kind of a resource allocation problem here. We say, okay, can we make you care about that within that time frame? Right? And that's what you have basically on a website, right. You go on a website, there's a green button saying okay, check, done, right, cool. So I care for a second. That's it.
00:18:38.626 - 00:18:40.386, Speaker C: But fine, as long as you can.
00:18:40.408 - 00:19:11.950, Speaker A: Establish that root of trust in your green SSL checkbox at your browser. I think we've seen a lot of kind of thought and probably innovation in the past twelve or 14 months on some of these more sovereign constructs that we've started to see getting constructed. Do you guys have maybe some thoughts on the economic kind of implications of those sorts of constructs? When you really remove kind of the application and execution layer from maybe some of the underlying economics that a network might be inheriting from an alternative l one, despite maintaining its sovereignty.
00:19:14.530 - 00:19:54.860, Speaker B: I'm happy to go. I think that especially on sovereign app chains or app specific roll ups, whatever you want to call it, I think the value capture is way more easy, right. Because it's inherent to the application. So probably value will accrue to the application of the crypto stack and to the sort of bottom layer, which in my case would be a DA layer or whatnot. And I think if you have an app specific chain, then it's quite easy to capture value by just extracting a fee for offering the application. So I think the fee switch in uniswap is famous, but if they had an app specific chain, it would be quite easy to make it valuable because every time somebody uses Uniswap, the block space gets used and validators captures some of that value.
00:19:55.470 - 00:20:03.070, Speaker A: Any thoughts from you guys on kind of sovereign constructs and how they could potentially modify or alter some of the economics for application developers?
00:20:04.290 - 00:20:30.230, Speaker D: Yeah, so I agree with what Ty just said as well. I feel like app specific chains will probably have a better chance of accruing more value in some way. I actually feel like modularity. It does make certain layer twos struggle to accrue sufficient value. This is why we're starting to see layer threes getting built out, right? That's how you try to find other ways to accrue them. Oh, sorry. Yeah.
00:20:30.230 - 00:20:40.534, Speaker D: Onto your layer. Moving forward, I think we'll continue to see more layer three spilling on top and continue to scale that way.
00:20:40.732 - 00:21:10.866, Speaker C: I don't see a difference happening. And there's a normal, let's say traditional world where quantization means that you will less and less accrue value and everything on top of that will accrue more value. It's just that within the innovation cycle, I like to say that every infrastructure was application ones. You start out with that even like an email protocol was an application. Once you started sending emails and then more and more people built on that, it's compressed basically down. What Matthew said before, that the fees per user might go down, but the fees in total might go up. Right.
00:21:10.866 - 00:21:21.126, Speaker C: So it depends what do you mean by really accrue value? But in general as a sum, it might be that most at some point will be at application. But once the system is really thriving, like we have now in the web.
00:21:21.148 - 00:21:25.910, Speaker B: Two world, do you think Uniswap is an application or infrastructure?
00:21:27.530 - 00:21:28.710, Speaker C: Which version?
00:21:29.770 - 00:21:51.342, Speaker B: We argue about this at the office. Like are you investing in applications or infrastructure? And you were also alluding to this, right? And I do think that in crypto it's often both because Uniswap for sort of panoptic, as an example, they're building options using unify three liquidity. So for them, Uniswap is the infrastructure and then you sort of have an infra layer again that captures value.
00:21:51.476 - 00:22:04.660, Speaker A: Probably like why the conversation? I guess that's probably part of the reason that that's become such, maybe like a common theme or something that a lot of people are chatting about is because there's probably alternate definitions of those things as well, and they probably convolute over each other a little bit.
00:22:06.310 - 00:22:15.480, Speaker C: They're going to aggregate the road, right? And you soap x. I think it's an aggregate or coming towards to be an aggregator. So they're moving toward the application now and they kind of letting go of the protocol ones.
00:22:16.730 - 00:22:44.690, Speaker A: Maybe something I would like to maybe ask you guys from a more kind of personal investor perspective. I know earlier we chatted about maybe some special things that we see in modular founders, those sorts of things. Are there explicit things that you guys really enjoy seeing out of maybe the founders or even the technical teams that you have the privilege of supporting that you would wish to see from others? Are there highlights there that you would like to share? Lessons learned from some of these portfolio companies in the modular space that you think is worth sharing?
00:22:47.510 - 00:23:23.102, Speaker D: Sure, I guess, yeah. When you're building module infrastructure, the founder should be, I guess, really agile as well. So in module in that sense. But yeah, some of the backers that, some of the founders that we backed. Yeah, we actually would like to back founders that has previously built in, whether it's like a monolithic environment or modular environment. So founders actually know how to appreciate the modularity nature of blockchain. Right.
00:23:23.102 - 00:23:31.434, Speaker D: So they're agile and they actually understand what's the benefit of having modular infrastructure.
00:23:31.482 - 00:23:37.002, Speaker A: Yeah. What about you, Uri, Matthias? Anything spicy as far as things you want to see more from founders?
00:23:37.146 - 00:23:44.770, Speaker B: What I like about working with our founders in the motor space is I'm often the dumbest guy in the room. Right. So they're all smarter than me and I'm learning from them as well.
00:23:44.840 - 00:23:47.282, Speaker A: That's the sign of a good investor, if they're willing to say that.
00:23:47.416 - 00:24:07.866, Speaker B: At the same time, it's not that different. Right. They do need to be smart and sort of flexible or agile, as you said, but they also struggle with the same things every other company struggles with. Hiring, team building. Just building a company is hard, whatever you do. I think that's sort of it. Yeah, I think that.
00:24:07.866 - 00:24:08.794, Speaker B: Summarize it. Yeah.
00:24:08.832 - 00:24:26.318, Speaker A: There might be a balance as well, probably in this space. I've found, at least during my time as an investor, that the majority of kind of the core founding team was quite technical. And oftentimes they do need kind of more, I guess, kind of like kosher traditional support from investors when it comes to the types of things you can actually do to help them win.
00:24:26.404 - 00:24:40.950, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, these guys don't need me to tell them how to write code. I have no fucking sure. But maybe helping with a first hire, et cetera, that's more where they need to sort of be alleviated. So they have their core muscle, their core strength, and we try to work sort of around that. Yeah.
00:24:41.020 - 00:25:14.340, Speaker A: Interesting. I want to kind of go into some maybe potentially spicy topics now that I think are again quite timely when it comes to many of the ideas that are getting discussed over the course of the next two days here. What are some of your opinions on kind of rehypothecation of proof of stake assets? Specifically, do you think there's unknown dangers that investors or founders or application builders are not considering? Are there like externalities that you think long and hard about or potentially keep you up at night like I do?
00:25:17.030 - 00:25:32.390, Speaker C: Yeah. We have a company in our portfolio, for example. It's a pure bitcoin company, and they don't like it at all. Right. But there's a bitcoin maximalism involved here. So I understand that. Right, you're talking about kind of storage, right, values.
00:25:32.390 - 00:26:02.366, Speaker C: But generally, what I find more complicated with the infrastructure now is that you add to the financial complexity, technical complexity, and to the technical complexity, you add scalability complexity. So you might think that, well, if something breaks down, I can all execute smart contracts and it all goes down this way, but all of a sudden, bomb, it doesn't work out because everybody runs through the same gateway, and so you have all complexity, even getting bigger. And it's really hard to evaluate that. How big is that?
00:26:02.388 - 00:26:02.622, Speaker A: Actually?
00:26:02.676 - 00:26:26.054, Speaker C: It's a lot of bunch of unknown unknowns. And that makes. I would go slightly right. Really careful about that and see how far you can go with this, because at some point we just break, and then you realize what is. So maybe just do that experimentally with small sums just to trigger and figure it out a little bit. But doing it on a big scale, as we saw last year, that might be a problematic thing.
00:26:26.172 - 00:26:30.538, Speaker A: Yes, definitely, as we all witnessed last year. Matthias, do you have any takes on this?
00:26:30.704 - 00:26:57.306, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I like the experimentation with it in general. I like experimentation and trying out stuff and maybe breaking on this specifically. I think the economics behind it are still quite hard. Right. So it's hard to quantify the risk of reapplication of assets as quantifying risk in crypto is fucking hard anyway. And then there's also not that much fees collected right now that you can sort of give enough yield to funnel. To funnel.
00:26:57.306 - 00:27:09.000, Speaker B: To incentivize people to take that risk. And that's, I think, sort of the big question here. Like, okay, maybe there's a small group of people who will do this, but to incentivize a lot of people, you need a lot of fees, and that's just not there right now.
00:27:09.930 - 00:27:36.960, Speaker A: I think I would broadly agree with that. I maybe want to pose a question to the audience. I like opening these up to see if anyone has anything to add to the conversation or maybe things that you disagree with. Is there anything that anyone here would like to raise their hand and potentially ask the panel? I'm happy to walk up and give you the mic. I see a spartan shirt over there. Any spicy takes for your colleague? You can't put cavita on the spot like that.
00:27:40.210 - 00:28:25.342, Speaker D: I guess one spicy take that we kind of touch on was module blockchain. Might at some point bring us back to maximalism, because going back to a point like my previous point, if you're trying to accrue value to a specific layer, you'll start to find other ways to accrue more value. Right? So for example, just thing aloud here. So a deal layer. If you're trying to fees do compress in the future and you find perhaps you're trying to own another layer instead, maybe execution layers, then you're starting to know we're going back to the cycle where we're starting to own more of the stack. So that's perhaps one spicy take.
00:28:25.396 - 00:28:36.900, Speaker B: Yeah. So then Celestia would at some point be like, hey, that settlement layer on top of us is also quite valuable. Why don't we sort of enshrine it into our. That's, that's a good bear case.
00:28:37.670 - 00:28:41.378, Speaker A: Yeah, Yuri, any other bear cases? In regards to that spicy take, I.
00:28:41.384 - 00:29:12.800, Speaker C: Think my biggest word with the whole ecosystem generally is that are we actually building something completely different and new or are we just rebuilding the stuff that's already out there in a little bit slightly different way and we're just not seeing it because it's so new. You haven't converged yet, but in the end you just end up with the same system, with the same centralized parts. Like a validator is so big, it just controls a bunch of stuff. Right? Mv is something so big, it controls a bunch of stuff. You have like a bunch of operators that are just grand and you haven't seen coming. But the economic gravity of that just made it happen. Right.
00:29:13.490 - 00:29:43.730, Speaker A: That's fair. Another pivot maybe in the conversation. Are there certain types of applications that you guys believe are specifically empowered by modular infrastructure? I know we've kind of chatted about these concepts of kind of turning specific applications into kind of their own sovereign execution layers, et cetera, across the stack. But when you think about kind of like the second order effects, maybe this time next year or in two years, what type of applications do you think will have most benefited from this sort of architecture?
00:29:43.890 - 00:30:11.486, Speaker B: Yeah, I think a downside of building a modular blockchain is, I think, interoperability. And as a result of that, applications that don't need too much interoperability are going to be, I think, very interesting to begin with. A good example of this could indeed be gaming. So a gaming specific chain for just one game. When I play like FIFA and I want to sell my coins or something on there, I don't need to interact with somebody playing World of Warcraft. Right. I have no need for that.
00:30:11.486 - 00:30:39.160, Speaker B: Whereas in defi that's very important. That you can plug these different Lego blocks into each other. So I think the first wave maybe, and we saw Argus present earlier, will probably be gaming specific chains. So that's, I think, something modularity enables and then indeed the different execution environments. Right. Stuff like the Solana VM, the fuel VM move vm, et cetera. Maybe order book type of decentralized exchanges will be enabled by that.
00:30:39.160 - 00:30:43.610, Speaker B: Although it remains to be seen how MEV will play out there. But these type of products as well.
00:30:43.680 - 00:30:54.698, Speaker A: Do you maybe want to chat on that as far as some of your cross domain MEV perspective when it comes to how that conceptually alters or is modified by modular architectures?
00:30:54.874 - 00:31:25.654, Speaker B: Yeah, we're talking about a lot. One thing we are currently still maybe debating, and I don't have my mind made up yet, is where do you want the MEV to sort of land? Right. So one vision is you want the DA layer to capture the MEV, because then it will accrue more value and you'll have more economic security on the other side. You maybe want the MEV to sort of be isolated in a separate execution environment. Because then if one game gets extremely attractive and a lot of people play it, it doesn't trickle down to the other roll ups. So it's a trade off. Right.
00:31:25.654 - 00:31:34.438, Speaker B: Do you want it to go down or not? And I think where the leader selection happens is where it will go to. And I don't know what the optimal decision is. I think there's still very much an open question.
00:31:34.524 - 00:31:48.062, Speaker A: The first thing it makes me think of is if, and maybe I could be ignorant to this. But whether people have thought about dynamic systems that would able to maybe modify or point where that MeV could go, but between two layers like that, I don't know if that's been explored or if that's the dumbest idea that's been said here today.
00:31:48.116 - 00:32:02.450, Speaker B: But I also don't know, honestly, but I would be down to sort of look into that more. I think that's one of the more interesting areas that indeed we talked about. These modular founders, if you want to call them like that, are sort of nerd sniped by and looking into, and I'm sort of happy to tag along with them on doing so.
00:32:02.520 - 00:32:19.770, Speaker A: Yeah. As we kind of get a little bit closer towards the end of this conversation, maybe open it up to all of you. You have an audience here that are quite modular build. Are there specific types of things that you want to see built, kind of requests for startups or any concepts that you think are rather unexplored or that you wish you had more looks at as far as different ideas.
00:32:24.720 - 00:33:00.164, Speaker C: So when I was reading up, I just started really recently reading about the intent based systems, and I found it's a really cool way of thinking about how it actually should act. And we have a company that's kind of in a similar space, but it's an agents based space. And so intents and agents are a similar thing. But in the end, if you look at how an app is built, for example, right, it's not possible to have an app built on just smart contracts. You need some sort of in between agents to trigger certain functions such that the person can just have a phone in the pocket and just notification arrives. Right. Something like that.
00:33:00.164 - 00:33:37.664, Speaker C: So you need all those things and you need to cross them. The chain barrier to this, the off chain and on chain. So I'm excited about this stuff and experimenting, more of this kind of things to really figure out. Okay, where does blockchain fit into the bigger world solving problem space than just really running around? The small pieces of the blockchain access themselves? Because I think we've crossed the barrier already. A couple years ago, where blockchain was just a really kind of a big space where you could put all your hope in and it was not concretely there, which is bunch of hope, and you can just really think about, oh, that's the potential. But now it's getting more concrete and it also shows you more things that breaks, that works, that can solve and cannot solve. Right.
00:33:37.664 - 00:33:56.890, Speaker C: And it becomes really hard to have the hope. And so you have to really think about now, okay, what does it actually can achieve, where does it go and how can we go there? And I think this is kind of this intent based thing together with the agent based. I'm not sure how different they are actually from each other. That's kind of a different conversation is kind of a really nice way to explore it.
00:33:57.740 - 00:34:04.300, Speaker A: Calvin, Matthias, any requests for startups or areas that you wish were maybe ideas that you saw more of as venture investors?
00:34:06.080 - 00:34:33.908, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm happy to take think, okay, this is going to be a bit boring and somewhat contrarian out defi. It's not very sexy anymore, right. Especially amongst venture investors. I do think the whole real world assets thing is actually quite cool. That we have like close to a billion of bonds. Being on the ethereum chain right now is, I think, very interesting to see. So in that regard, stuff like noble that aims to bring USDC onto these celestia chains, I think it's very interesting.
00:34:33.908 - 00:34:48.344, Speaker B: So these type of products that actually connect to the sort of real world or web two world, or whatever you want to call it, are quite interesting. I would love to see that more moving forward as we grow more into that adoption part of the tech SEC.
00:34:48.462 - 00:34:50.580, Speaker A: USDC, the quintessential real world asset.
00:34:50.660 - 00:35:07.036, Speaker B: I mean, I've been arguing here about end user verification, and now I'm the USDC bull. But yeah, it's all fair and also privacy tech, but that's more generic stuff like penumbra, anoma, Nimtech. I think that's sort of where my sort of more crypto native heart lies. And I would love to see more.
00:35:07.058 - 00:35:23.072, Speaker A: Of that, maybe dig into that a little bit, because I actually feel quite naive as far as maybe some of the privacy considerations that are powered, maybe uniquely by modular infrastructure. Is there anything that you would add to that or things you've seen recently that excited you specifically with privacy type applications or privacy based architectures?
00:35:23.216 - 00:35:52.104, Speaker B: I haven't seen a lot of privacy tech on a modular ecosystem, like a roll up that's only privacy or app specific. Tornado cache will be quite cool. I'm not sure if they're sort of. And then on privacy, and you have sort of two layers of it, right. I think a lot of financial institutions want privacy on their orders and don't care if regulators can see it. And then you have more the crypto anarchistic privacy, which maybe Darkfi Nimtech are working on, where sort of everything has to be private. They're very purest about that in the modular ecosystem.
00:35:52.104 - 00:36:04.704, Speaker B: I don't know, you can make a lot of design trade offs. You can maybe encrypt a mempool, which for financial institutions would be enough privacy, right? So, yeah, looking forward to seeing these founders try out stuff there.
00:36:04.902 - 00:36:30.590, Speaker A: It's another one I don't want to bore people with, because I feel like it can be quite cliche. But I'm curious if you guys have any perspectives specifically on maybe, like, non web, three native use cases for some of these modular architectures. I think I could probably speak for everyone in the room in the sense that enterprise, blockchain, et cetera, has failed in the majority of its capacity. But I'm curious if we feel that there's any inkling of feel that the modular infrastructure could maybe help empower that in some way.
00:36:34.000 - 00:37:07.860, Speaker C: I had this conversation yesterday about how do you build a social network, a new social network? And I find this is a mistake. Most people think about social networks in terms of Facebook and Instagram and YouTube's as kind of, there's a graph, because I think in the new way, if you have blockchain, you have this new technology, you can rethink that. And I think in the center of that is the feed. And the feed can be, for example, modular, right. You can actually do and choose your own feed, how you want to like it. And the feed through curation connects to people, not anymore. Through kind of a social graph that already existed and you just walled it in.
00:37:07.860 - 00:37:31.144, Speaker C: It really is about like, there is a centerpiece where people are curating stuff and that flows all into the feed and that connects the people. Right. And this has the merging quality of a network. Then all of a sudden you have a social network without wanting it, just like it has before. But it's a new way of thinking. And I think that's what blockchain enables us, a new way of thinking. The old stuff, all the things that we have already, we can have it back, but we have it in a new way and build it in a different way, and only then it works.
00:37:31.342 - 00:37:54.630, Speaker A: And actually like to build on that last point that you made, is there anything very specifically that you guys feel like maybe getting modular, pilled, whatever you want to call it, or just becoming more aware of how people are thinking in the modular kind of infrastructure space? Are there explicit things that has changed around how you think that could be? I don't know, from an ethical, philosophical perspective. It also be from a technical perspective as well.
00:37:55.960 - 00:38:21.624, Speaker B: I don't have a whole lot. I could take it back to the enterprise question. I don't think we'll see a lot of enterprises starting to build on these systems earlier. Right. You asked, like, how do you underwrite the risk of it being quite experimental? I think especially enterprises are scared of that. I do think that sort of a roll up itself is very instinct for them, because they can sort of keep a level of control that maybe they feel like they miss on a permissionless.
00:38:21.672 - 00:38:23.592, Speaker A: L one, or maybe certain regulatory.
00:38:23.736 - 00:38:39.664, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. I do see a lot of experimentation happening there, but I do think it's way further out than next year or something, as you asked. Right. I don't think they'll be like, oh, we have to deploy a roll up. No, I think they're more likely to be to look at more established networks.
00:38:39.792 - 00:39:04.940, Speaker A: Cool. Well, now we have probably maybe two or so minutes left just to finalize this conversation. But what do you guys hope we are like if we return here in a year and have the privilege of meeting at the next modular summit? What is it that you hope you're seeing become successful? What are some of maybe the next milestones that you hope you see this space achieve in order to kind of get us to the next stage?
00:39:06.560 - 00:39:44.744, Speaker B: I mean, Celestia launching is a good first one, right? Launching the main net successfully. Second, I think also more CK rollups going live, like in full. I know CK sync is sort of live, but that ecosystem maturing to a similar sort of level as maybe the arbitram ecosystem is, because I know we're here at Mojo, something, we're talking about Sassia, but a lot of rollups also have the largest ecosystems by far on Ethereum, EIP 4844. Going live successfully would be pretty cool, I think, as that makes block space more accessible for these roll ups and maybe the first sovereign roll up on Celestia. More app specific rollups going live.
00:39:44.862 - 00:39:47.784, Speaker A: Hopefully some accelerationism around restaking as well, maybe.
00:39:47.902 - 00:39:48.616, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:39:48.798 - 00:39:52.904, Speaker A: Fast experiments, but small ones, hopefully. What about you?
00:39:53.102 - 00:40:33.380, Speaker D: So, yeah, aside from those, I think we want to see more of the DAP layer development as well. So I actually want to touch on onchain gaming as well. So I feel like on chain gaming could actually take advantage of what modular blockchain could actually offer. So bringing the entire game logic as well as game economy on chain could actually bring about siloed different type of economies on site. Right? So for example, strategy game, you're trying to attack someone, right? And then someone can front run that action. It will be like, it will create different new dynamics. Right? So I feel like that's someplace that we can perhaps.
00:40:33.460 - 00:41:07.484, Speaker A: I've definitely heard Scott from Argus talk a lot about what excites him. Building modular infrastructure specifically for game designers is attempting to create something that can create very emergent net new player behaviors, because I think that's one of the things that actually makes games exciting or when good games become exciting is when it's like something you haven't done before. I remember reselling in game assets for the first time. That's like actually what got me into crypto in 2012. I think seeing more experiments around that will be pretty exciting as well. Awesome. Guys, I think we're just at time, so really appreciate the attention from everyone and everyone supporting the whole gang here at Celestia and Maven.
00:41:07.484 - 00:41:11.008, Speaker A: Appreciate you guys having us and yeah, enjoy the rest of your time at Paris, everyone. Thanks.
00:41:11.094 - 00:41:14.860, Speaker C: Thanks a lot. Bye.
