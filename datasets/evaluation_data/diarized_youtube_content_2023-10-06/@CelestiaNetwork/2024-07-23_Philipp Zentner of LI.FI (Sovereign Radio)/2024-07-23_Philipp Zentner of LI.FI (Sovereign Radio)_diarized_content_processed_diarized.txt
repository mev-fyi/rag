00:00:00.760 - 00:00:05.262, Speaker A: So I'm here with Philip Sentna from LFI. Welcome to sovereign radio.
00:00:05.366 - 00:00:07.470, Speaker B: Thank you, Anna. Happy to be here.
00:00:07.550 - 00:00:12.582, Speaker A: Cool. I think we need to learn a little bit about Lefi. What is lifi?
00:00:12.766 - 00:01:00.074, Speaker B: Lifi is a multi chain liquidity aggregator. So essentially we have fragmented liquidity across so many ecosystems and chains, right? And there are new l two s coming and coming. And so liquidity is fragmented, but so is the infrastructure in between that allows us to connect these chains, cross chain bridges, but also Dexs, Dex aggregators, solver systems. And for any larger player, that comes from the top, like a Robinhood that looks at the space and it's like, oof, that's a lot of fragmentation for them. It would be a huge effort to implement all these APIs, and we do that for them. We have one simple API, one middleware, where we aggregate all these liquidity sources, and we have a smart order routing that finds the best path from any asset, a, on chain X to any other asset, B on chain YdeZ.
00:01:00.232 - 00:01:07.054, Speaker A: What exact problem, though, are you solving beyond just fragmentation, like for the user? What is a problem that you're actually.
00:01:07.142 - 00:01:41.814, Speaker B: How does the user know which liquidity source to use? How does the user know which bridge to use, which Dex to use, which Dex gives them the best price, best price discovery, the fastest way to get from a to b, which solution to trust and which not. We do all that homework for them, and we have all that. We have done all the integrations, we do have the maintenance overhead and the continuous monitoring analytics around this. So we are a b, two b company in the first place, but lots of b, two c interfaces, like Jumbo exchange are using us to provide these same benefits to the end user.
00:01:41.902 - 00:01:50.630, Speaker A: What exactly are you though? Where's the piece of software? It doesn't sound like you're a bridge. So where do you live in that stack?
00:01:50.670 - 00:02:18.714, Speaker B: We're a middleware. So essentially we are an API. Wallets are asking us, hey, which assets are available to swap and bridge on all these chains. We have an endpoint for that. Another endpoint simply generates call data to execute. Then which can be signed by a user or by a server signer. We don't care and we don't know, actually, we are non custodial solution, and we also have a smart contract system that lives on all these chains, which allows us to do more complex things.
00:02:18.714 - 00:02:39.872, Speaker B: More complex things. What I mean by that is, if a user comes out of long tail assets like cake on BSC, but wants to have magic on arbitrum, the bridges in between these ecosystems are just reduced to stable coins and native currencies. So often you have to swap, then bridge and then swap again. So the user journey is super comprehensive and exhausting.
00:02:39.896 - 00:02:40.448, Speaker A: It's complicated.
00:02:40.504 - 00:02:53.312, Speaker B: It's complicated, right? It's complicated. So we are not only able to find the best path, but also execute multiple transactions within one signature in one transaction. That makes the user journey much more seamless and cheaper as well.
00:02:53.376 - 00:03:08.764, Speaker A: You talk about being an API, but do you, and you sort of mentioned you're actually, you have smart contracts on a lot of these different chains. How much other integration work do you do? For example, if you're integrating with a wallet, is that on your side, the work being done, or are they sort of using you?
00:03:08.852 - 00:03:16.804, Speaker B: They are implementing our API, which generates the call data, and as they sign call data, our smart contracts on chains are being called.
00:03:16.932 - 00:03:32.304, Speaker A: All right, nice. How do you exactly work with bridges, though? Because I feel like, and maybe like what it sounds like is you're sort of between the wallet and some of these other systems. But are you actually using bridges as well?
00:03:32.352 - 00:03:43.120, Speaker B: Yes, of course. So bridge wants to offer bridging. A wallet wants to offer bridging to their users. So the problem that wallet has now is, okay, there are like 20 bridges out there.
00:03:43.160 - 00:03:43.648, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:03:43.704 - 00:04:27.279, Speaker B: And these bridges have different depths of liquidity. They support different source and destination chains, they have different speeds. And what if a bridge goes down? You want to have redundancy and have an alternative solution to fall back to. And that creates lots of overhead, like on a research site in the first place, but then integration, maintenance, and then you also want analytics, understand how are my users behaving? Right. So all that overhead comes out of the box with DeFi, essentially they just implement us. They get all these bridges, we make an algorithmic decision on which bridge to use in which scenario, depending on transfer size and whether it's important for the user to arrive somewhere fast or if speed doesn't matter. Right.
00:04:27.279 - 00:04:29.431, Speaker B: And then is that something that users.
00:04:29.495 - 00:04:35.863, Speaker A: Can actually choose or wallets could choose? Is it sort of like, do you need it fast? Do you need it cheap? Like, is that actually.
00:04:35.911 - 00:04:58.698, Speaker B: Yeah, we have these preferences. We are exposing your API and then it's up to our integration partner, like the wallet, whether they want to expose these options to the user. Most often, user interfaces are meant to be kept simple, right? So you don't want to give too many options and then. But it really depends on how sophisticated the end user is. And depending on that, there are more advanced interfaces or less advanced.
00:04:58.754 - 00:05:09.914, Speaker A: Got it. It sounds a little bit like you're doing some sort of routing. So I don't know. That's what's sort of making me wonder. But do you consider yourself like a routing protocol?
00:05:10.002 - 00:05:20.380, Speaker B: Definitely. We are a smart order router. Smart order routing across defi liquidity. That's what we are selling to, to dapps and top level applications.
00:05:20.720 - 00:05:26.304, Speaker A: The other question then is, would you put yourself in the category of allowing for intents?
00:05:26.472 - 00:05:36.880, Speaker B: So that one endpoint we are providing, where we give you all the information on which assets are swappable and bridgeable, you could call that an intent discovery endpoint.
00:05:36.960 - 00:05:43.728, Speaker A: I feel like the word intents also gets. It's used in all these different ways. So I don't know, how do you mean it when you're using it?
00:05:43.824 - 00:06:21.186, Speaker B: Intent is simply, it's essentially just an instruction with limits on what I want to have executed in general, and then I don't have a preference on how things are being done. Traditionally, Levi's API gives you preferences. If you want, you can simply don't show these preferences to the user. Programmatically, pick one of the solutions, like the cheapest one, for example. And now it appeals like an intense system where you simply say, I want to swap a for B. I don't care how. From a technical perspective, there are differences, right.
00:06:21.186 - 00:06:44.192, Speaker B: You would typically delegate the execution, like a permit to contract, for example. We don't offer that yet, but soon, but no pressure. According to our clients, the demand for the intent system, how people are envisioning it, is not there yet, but we are well positioned to actually go in that direction. Yes.
00:06:44.296 - 00:06:57.352, Speaker A: Can you share some of the partners or projects that are already using Lefi? Stuff like the wallet, the bridges, the chains, just so we get a sense for where people might already see you?
00:06:57.536 - 00:07:11.056, Speaker B: Oh, of course. Lefi has been around for three years. We are 65 employees by now. 13 of the 15 largest wallets in the space, including Metamask and Phantom, are using us. Cool. Robinhood is using us. Brave browser is using us.
00:07:11.056 - 00:07:22.212, Speaker B: Opensea Finance, crypto.com, and also these large exchanges that are more and more releasing non custodial wallets. In all these non custodial solutions, we are implemented.
00:07:22.316 - 00:07:26.396, Speaker A: Interesting. Do you in any way put yourself in the same category as like, wallet Connect?
00:07:26.548 - 00:07:30.532, Speaker B: No, wallet Connect does something different. We work closely to that team, though.
00:07:30.636 - 00:07:34.324, Speaker A: Okay, cool. Actually, I think you mentioned some of the wallets, but what about the bridges?
00:07:34.492 - 00:08:11.358, Speaker B: We support around 17 bridges right now from Stargate to across Cbridge, a Connext, hop noses. Hyperlane is a messaging bridge. So technically that's something different. It sends data back and forth and not value transfers. But there is, I think they are currently developing a liquidity network on top. We would implement that liquidity network like Stargate is the liquidity network to layer zero and squid, the liquidity network to Xlrtaine and Mayan to wormhole. We implement liquidity networks, we do not implement the underlying messaging bridges.
00:08:11.454 - 00:08:16.374, Speaker A: Got it? And I mean, the next question was actually about IBC, but I guess, does it fall in the same category?
00:08:16.422 - 00:08:40.410, Speaker B: Then it is a messaging way. There are liquidity networks on top of within the cosmos ecosystem, like squid that are active there. But Leafa doesn't support cosmos yet. Simply the demand is not there. We have been focusing the first two and a half years on EVM only, and we recently started launching on Solana, and we will have native bitcoin support soon too.
00:08:40.830 - 00:08:49.330, Speaker A: In some of the material, I think this is written on your website, but you talk about sort of like chain abstraction. Is that in any way similar to account abstraction?
00:08:49.710 - 00:09:24.434, Speaker B: Chain abstraction is an umbrella term for many, many things. The idea to abstract away the chain, no matter where the user is on, essentially the user shouldn't care that actually he or she is operating on a blockchain. And then there are multiple things we need to accomplish, right? For example, if you want to communicate with different chains, you have to change your RPC. We should abstract that away, right? So first thing, right? So you don't need to change that. Next thing would be okay. Managing your account and signing off any transaction is just exhausting, and it's a bad user experience. So we should abstract your account management away.
00:09:24.434 - 00:09:54.010, Speaker B: That's account abstraction. So now we can simply allow other people to employ things like social recovery. If I lose my passphrase, whatever, all these things, we have account abstraction. Then maybe another topic is balance abstraction, where you say, hey, if I have 100 USDC on chain a, another 100 UC on chain b, I might as well just want to know that I have 200 USDC and I don't know where this is deducted from. Right. So that would be balance abstracted. And there are companies working on that as well.
00:09:54.010 - 00:09:55.238, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:09:55.334 - 00:10:06.378, Speaker A: Doesn't this sort of live at the wallet level though? Like, if you talk about that abstraction, it's like the UX, like, isn't it the wallet's choice to show this or not show it? Or do you see it more in what you're doing?
00:10:06.474 - 00:10:47.350, Speaker B: Theoretically, I think this whole transaction is just a big, big term, and it goes from the lowest level, the lowest layer like blockchain level and standard level up to the highest level where we have centralized solutions solving for certain things. And like an RPC typically. So it's really tough to say this is this or that. It's an umbrella term for many, many. It's a huge narrative and it's something this whole space is aiming for. And within that we have lots of different components and not all of these things are viable businesses as well. So often we have chicken egg problems where you would need everyone to adopt something in order for it to make sense.
00:10:47.350 - 00:11:40.600, Speaker B: So it will take some time for this narrative to play out and we're going to see tons of narrative within that coming up in the next years to come. The one thing we do know is that especially when it comes to intents where we essentially abstracting away the way transactions are being created and so on, companies that have lots of distribution power like us, like a one inch, like a Uniswap, they are best positioned to actually execute on that because they already have the distribution power to actually bring their own standards to life and to adoption. And this is the race we are into. Chain up section for us is definitely a very important topic and we are watching this whole space closely and are in touch with any solution in there.
00:11:40.680 - 00:11:46.752, Speaker A: Do you think Dexs though, like the ones you just listed, if they're living on different chains, would they ever build that themselves?
00:11:46.936 - 00:11:58.328, Speaker B: Of course they do. I mean one inch as a Dex aggregator has one inch fusion already. Uniswap is working on Unix. I'm pretty certain that zero x will also go in that direction at some point.
00:11:58.424 - 00:12:15.410, Speaker A: But I mean if they're going to then move into that space, where do you see yourself moving? Like where are you developing towards? Are you still at the stage where you're just doing kind of implementations to bring more chains on or are you also developing the protocol itself or this API level?
00:12:15.710 - 00:12:58.154, Speaker B: We have our own protocol in the sense that we have our own smart contract as well. So back then there was just uniswap as a single Dex. At some point we had Dex aggregators because there were so many dexes. So one inch, zero x power slope and open ocean came up and then we were the next level where we are not only combining the DeXs and Dex aggregators, but also combining them with the bridges. So we evolutionary the next step here and then the next evolution would be intense systems. Intense systems work differently because something that Dex aggregators have learned and that people have learned that tried to build what we are building is aggregation, is hard to scale. It's really hard to do what we are doing.
00:12:58.154 - 00:13:36.862, Speaker B: And so instead of trying to do everything in house, you simply say, I'm going to take care of collecting intents from users, and then I'm building a solver network. And then within that network, we're going to have lots of specialized entities that specialize on solving for certain things. Like there might be a lending borrowing solver, there might be a solver just for bridging, and a solver focusing on providing the best prices on same chains, swaps and some, you know, this is how this is going. And we already started talking to solversystems, started aggregating them in a classic fashion, and we will slowly transition into a more intense centric solution.
00:13:36.966 - 00:13:44.734, Speaker A: That's cool. You mentioned a bunch of dexs, but you didn't mention, like, cowswap. And I kind of went like, cowswap was always like, the OG intense Dex.
00:13:44.822 - 00:13:45.450, Speaker B: Right.
00:13:46.310 - 00:13:48.542, Speaker A: Would you integrate with them? Or like, are you integrated with them?
00:13:48.566 - 00:13:52.210, Speaker B: We'd love to integrate them. So we are close to the cow swap team.
00:13:53.630 - 00:13:55.854, Speaker A: Not anymore. I think they've spun out, but the.
00:13:55.862 - 00:14:38.170, Speaker B: Whole, whole gnosis and everything that comes out of that is close to them. They also invested in us, like Martin and Stefan and Vector, the ecosystem fund. So we are super close to gnosis and Calsop. The problem with Calsob is we cannot aggregate them from a technical perspective, like how the flow works. We are not at a point where we can aggregate them. That might change over the course of the next year, but it's just difficult for us right now. It's just like the limit order protocols in general are hard to aggregate because we need to know deterministically where funds are arriving and what the result is going to be like price wise.
00:14:38.170 - 00:14:40.054, Speaker B: And it's just tough to.
00:14:40.102 - 00:14:45.918, Speaker A: Are they just really built? They were sort of that original concept of intense, but were they built just very differently?
00:14:46.014 - 00:14:47.110, Speaker B: They're just ahead of time.
00:14:47.190 - 00:14:51.950, Speaker A: They're ahead of their time, but now not quite locked into what's here.
00:14:52.030 - 00:15:20.730, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah. No cow sub is an amazing product. We would love to agree with them. We have sat down with Ana quite often, but, yeah, unfortunately right now, not possible. We also have lots of conflicting priorities because we have so many large enterprise clients. Then like a phantom metamask and the Robinhood and Binance and crypto.com dot, they all have very different needs, actually, and it's just tough to make it just tough to satisfy that demand alone.
00:15:20.890 - 00:15:24.036, Speaker A: Cool. Hey, thanks so much for sharing with.
00:15:24.068 - 00:15:28.200, Speaker B: Us all about and thank you for having me.
00:15:28.940 - 00:15:34.980, Speaker A: And thanks for being on sovereign radio. And thank you all for watching. And I think stay tuned for the next one.
