00:00:02.280 - 00:00:42.180, Speaker A: So hi everyone, I'm going to start with a short presentation of node Guardians. So node Guardians is kind of like a game. It's more like a gamified learning experience, especially tailored for developers, developers with some level of experience. We cover solidity, ker noir and Huff. We have partner content with Celestia, ZkSync, Optimism, Espresso and Lido. Also we cover a lot of security aspects of smart contracts through four game mods. So we have CTF, which are essentially on chain programming challenges where you have to hack a smart contract.
00:00:42.180 - 00:01:25.422, Speaker A: It could be a novel vulnerability, could be replaying a very known hack like we have in the Getrect campaign, taking the top three most well known hack on the rec leaderbox. We also have the build game mode. On this one you basically download some codes that we prepared for you, scaffolding, everything is pre configured and you have some specification with some test strips and you have to develop according to some specifications. And then you can submit your code to our servers. We run another set of tests and we can validate the quest for you on the website. Another game mode would be the theory content. Those ones are more like knowledge article.
00:01:25.422 - 00:01:57.878, Speaker A: You read through it, then you have a quiz, you answer the questions and if you have everything, you get some rewards. Fourth game mode would be gas golfing. It's only available for solidity right now, but it's like the only competitive game mode that we have. You do your implementation in solidity. You try to have the lowest gas consumption of all the other users, and if you do, you can make your way through the leaderboard. I can show you one of those for the gas golfing festivals that we did not that long ago. We have some of our best users.
00:01:57.878 - 00:02:23.336, Speaker A: It's for the whole event. So those users made the best implementation they could do over the whole campaign. A campaign is nothing but a bundle of quests. Each quest of the gas golfing campaign also has its own leaderboard. This one is with specific gas consumption. So this is competitive components that I was talking about. Now if we want an example of a CTF quest, we can take the one for Celestia.
00:02:23.336 - 00:02:56.062, Speaker A: So let me just get there. Celestia blobstream. So you just start your quest. Okay, so this is how it goes. You always have some law, some art, and this first part is explaining how blobstream works, especially about blobstream XDev and implementation of blobstream. So you read through it, you understand how blobstream works, why it's necessary, what is its purpose for EVM chains. And so yeah, how the CDCI blocks are organized.
00:02:56.062 - 00:03:49.980, Speaker A: So you have those shares which are blobs of data that are included in the block and then you mercury them into both row and columns which are then again merkelized into data routes to have a mercury route for their block and you mercury that again for the state bundle of blocks that can be proven to be included in Celestia and this can be posted to Ethereum or any other EVM chain for as a proof of inclusion. Proof of that the data is available on Celestia. And so we are talking about the CTF quest. So you have more content, you will have the contract, the code that you will have to interact with, sometimes hack, sometimes just a simple interaction. After you understand some key concept here, it's the later. So you have to deploy your contract. So first I just need to log in.
00:03:49.980 - 00:04:36.160, Speaker A: Okay. Then I have to deploy link my wallet, sorry, and deploy my contract. Okay. So when it's done, you will receive the address of your deployed contract. Everything will be displayed on the website and with all the instruction you had before, you just have to hack it. In this case, for this quest, you have to post a blob on Celestia and then you have to prove its inclusion on Ethereum and when it's done, you validate the quest. You can only do so if you understood how the data is actually stored on Celestia, how to generate a proof of inclusion, and how to send and validate this proof on Ethereum.
00:04:36.160 - 00:04:58.470, Speaker A: You do all of that, you pass the quest. So here, it's what I said. You have the contract address and this one is fully on chain. For solidity. We are mostly using Sibo via Testnet. For Stacknet, we're using the Stacknet sipple and we do not have CTF quests for Noah and Huff yet. It's only built for those two other languages.
00:04:58.470 - 00:05:35.116, Speaker A: Now, as I said, to begin with, it's also a game. It's a gamified learning experience, but it's also a game with very strong rpg vibes. So you also have your character, so you have your stuff, you have some achievements, you have your skill trick and your stuff. Obviously as soon as you finish your quest, you will get some reward. It will be some gold. And sometimes for specific quests, like particularly difficult quests or campaigns, you will also receive some unique items and with those achievements also. So with specific quests and campaign, you can receive unique items or unique achievements.
00:05:35.116 - 00:06:19.960, Speaker A: With those, you can then go to the inventory where you can choose among a lot of different items. Each item can be upgraded one or three times for different level of authorities. And so yeah, you can equip whatever you want on your avatar as long as you have all the requirements for the items that you want to equip. Those requirements can also include the skill tree. So this is really, this really goes to the rpg's where you have to choose your path, what kind of class you want to play. So here with 48 skill points you can fill the whole tree. And filling the tree is, I mean, filling some of the talents is the requirements to get some specific items or to upgrade some to a higher level of rarity.
00:06:19.960 - 00:06:59.180, Speaker A: If you do a lot of the content, probably maybe all the content, you can make your way to the hall of Fame. So here you are in the top 100 and your avatar will be showcased in case you're in the top three of the player. So here we have countach, Leo, Besancon and Sauvigny up one, two and three respectively. And yeah, those are top users. If you want to play the game and you're really hardcore about it, you can make your way through the hall of Fame and maybe take the place. Something I didn't show I think was maybe just theory content. So we have Siri content about many different topics.
00:06:59.180 - 00:07:45.472, Speaker A: I guess one of the interesting one would be elliptic curves. So let me just show you exactly how it goes. So if I choose theory and introduction to elliptic curves can take a quest. So here it really is a knowledge base that I told you about. So we have a lot of text, some graphs, some nice and pretty well crafted explanation of different topics of viable difficulty and complexity. This one for elliptic curve really explain you like what's an elliptic curve, what does it mean to do operation on elliptic curves? And how can they be used later on for ECDSA signatures and stuff like this? So you can go through the content, understand everything if there's any issue. Anyway, you can always go on discord.
00:07:45.472 - 00:08:27.210, Speaker A: We are available like 24/7 you have a question, something you don't understand or beg, just reach out to us and we'll answer you and try to solve the situation as fast as possible. So for this, your request when you're done, when you feel confident, you can take the quiz. So you have the quiz here with usually three questions. If you fail, some of them new questions will be rolled in to replace the one you fail. And when you pass everything, it's the same as finishing a CTF or a build quest. You just get your reward, your gold your potential items and achievements, and you can keep going through the game. And yeah, for now, I guess that's about it.
00:08:27.210 - 00:09:26.480, Speaker A: In the end, you can use not guardians as a proof of skill to show what you know for this or that language, namely solidity, koff or noir. Your experience in using some development test suites, whether it's hardat foundries, carb for ko, lower level things like huff typically, or more esoteric languages with NOAA and Aztec, and yeah, so try to think of it as a kind of proof of skill platform and as a testament to that. We actually do have it in the settings. We do have partnerships. So partnerships with other companies that recognize the skill of users and not guardians. Currently we have two in production, so it's one with Onlydust and one with Stagnet. So if you have some pretty good career level on not guardians, and you opted into the only dust partnership, when you solve something APR, you implement a new functionality, you resolve a pr or something like this an issue, sorry.
00:09:26.480 - 00:10:06.560, Speaker A: On GitHub, through onlydust, you will get an increased amount of remuneration, whether it's like five or 10%. This is dependent on only dust, but it means that they care about your level. On outgoing, same for Stacknet, we actually like having a good career level on outglodian is a requirement to just be able to apply for stockinette hacker houses. So you cannot apply to those hackers if you don't even have an account on that guardian. And if you do, if you do have one, you cannot apply if you don't have a good career level. So this is like gatekeeping the hacker houses to ensure that you have good level. And as I said, it's a testament to this legitimacy of having a good level on that guardians.
00:10:06.560 - 00:10:12.926, Speaker A: And I think that's it for the platform right now. I don't know if you have any question about it.
00:10:13.068 - 00:10:30.042, Speaker B: So when they are. So can we go to like the game? So when they are solving the problem, are they solving it on the front end itself or they are gonna.
00:10:30.186 - 00:10:59.610, Speaker A: Oh yeah, I see. Yeah, it's true. It's something I didn't mention. So there are really two main ways to go about it. It's whether you, if your quest is CTF, you will almost never, it's not always the case, but you will almost never have additional contact. You will have the contracts being displayed like so on the front end. So you solve it here, you don't really solve it here because it's a CTF, you have to solve it unchecked.
00:10:59.610 - 00:11:14.366, Speaker A: So you have all the information, you have the contract implementation with, let's say vulnerability. You have the address of the contract that you deployed through, not guardians, and you know which chain it is. So you just have to go and chain and solve it. So this one is a fully on chain.
00:11:14.438 - 00:11:31.610, Speaker B: What do you mean by. Typically you deploy a vulnerable contract on chain and challenge players. Uninspect this contract overall and try to find a borrower.
00:11:34.800 - 00:12:06.230, Speaker A: We deploy for you a vulnerable contract with one testnet ether and your goal is to steal the testnet data. And when you're done with it, you just click on verify here on the bottom right and we go and chain and check if the solving condition is actually met. So this is for CTF. Now we have build and gas golfing. For those ones we actually provide the CLI. So a command line tool that you can use to download the quest. I can show you an example pretty quickly for any build quest.
00:12:06.230 - 00:12:36.630, Speaker A: So if I go quest, I think you'll see 721 is a build. Okay, so you see here on top? Yeah. Okay, so that's a command that you will find for every single build quest. So those ones are actually local quests. You will have to develop on your own development environment, your own versus code, your own git repository and everything. You just use our CLI with which you have all the scaffolding codes that I talked about. You have the test suite, everything is pre configured.
00:12:36.630 - 00:13:08.356, Speaker A: You just have to use this command. You have everything locally, you get to work once again, if you're stuck, you come to us on Discord, there's really no problem and you run the test. So with quest test, quest test, one, two or three for the different parts. And when everything's green, you can do a submission once again, just through GitHub, it's all automatic. We get access to the repo and we will recheck actually your code with additional tests. And for BuildQuest, yeah, you work locally and you submit. So those ones are off chain.
00:13:08.356 - 00:13:44.088, Speaker A: The ones I showed before CTF is unchecked. The only ones that would fit what you were actually asking for solving in the browser currently are serequest, where you solve the quiz in the browser and you have your answer immediately in the browser. It's just that for the other one. Yeah, build on CTF, some code has to be written and you don't write it on the not guard. That's also especially for BuildQuest. As we said, if not guardian needs to be. If having a good level of not guardians is a proof of some amount of skill, you're not going to develop in a company, whether it's a startup or not.
00:13:44.088 - 00:14:05.430, Speaker A: You're not going to code in your browser. It just doesn't happen. You can do very quick stuff, let's say with remix, but usually, no, you have your own development environment and that's what we emphasize. We want users to go there because this is how you work usually. This is how you really work in a startup, on a web3 company, or web two for that matter. So this is what we want users to do.
00:14:07.810 - 00:14:13.070, Speaker B: Because I'm thinking like, what's the angle for new users? Is there any like.
00:14:16.780 - 00:14:44.120, Speaker A: No, it's a question we actually ask ourselves. The problem is that if we put bounty, chances are we will get butted. Like, we'll have a lot of bots just coming. It's really proof of skill. Like you have a good level, it's like your web3 cv. Yeah, it's like eco and yeah, that's how we want to keep it. That way we, we get funding through other means, but it's completely free for users.
00:14:44.120 - 00:14:59.800, Speaker A: That way we can maximize onboarding. And the more user we have, the more, yeah, the more user we can take to a higher level of proficiency for language A or B, and this is what we care about. So, sorry, that's all.
00:15:06.220 - 00:15:07.880, Speaker B: Qualifying for. Heck.
00:15:10.060 - 00:15:40.040, Speaker A: Not only, we also had several contents. One of the quests we did typically was re implementing the EVM within the EVM. And the people who actually solved that quest first were put in relation with another company who was looking for developers with some knowledge of the EVM. So it's also used as a way to place user, place potential good candidates into other web3 companies. I feel like you can create a.
00:15:40.080 - 00:15:41.620, Speaker B: Competition, all the things.
00:15:42.080 - 00:16:22.510, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, yeah. We also hosted several events like the infinite Space Bazaar of Celestia. And I mean, not the whole event, just there was a hackathon as part of the infinite space bazaar that used not guardians for the competition. And we did the same for Pura Vida in Costa Rica not that long ago. Another CTF where many users use the platform to compete during the event. And, yeah, so it's also already usable for competition, if that's your question. And yeah, I don't know if there's a user question.
00:16:25.940 - 00:16:47.880, Speaker B: How, how reactive are the developers to the story? Like, because I mean, ultimately they are here to learn. When you talk to, like, the users of this platform, like, what are their reactions?
00:16:53.510 - 00:17:18.782, Speaker A: Oh, some like it and some really care about it and some don't. That's why it's made to be optional. Like you don't have to go through the items and the skill tree to play the game. But if that's really your thing, completely fine. As soon as you finish a quest, maybe you rush to get this new item that you wanted. We do have some users that really love that rpg vibe. We have some that don't really care about it and it's fine.
00:17:18.782 - 00:17:22.814, Speaker A: Everyone can find like their own space within it. There's nothing mandatory on this.
00:17:22.902 - 00:17:33.290, Speaker B: Is there like an age demographic that you see? I mean this would be good for like younger kids, maybe for older people who want to just learn.
00:17:36.030 - 00:18:11.370, Speaker A: The demographic I would say is like the, for me it really looks like the average web3 developer demographic. So I would say 15 to 30, more or less, maybe a little bit higher. But now here for a question. Some I didn't see like a clear indication that younger users love the items and others don't. I think should just like from one person to the other. Some, some love it, some just don't care about it. Kenya, that's all for me.
