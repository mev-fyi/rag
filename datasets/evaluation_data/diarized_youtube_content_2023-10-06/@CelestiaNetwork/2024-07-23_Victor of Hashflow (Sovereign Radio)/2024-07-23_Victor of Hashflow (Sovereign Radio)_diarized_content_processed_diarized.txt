00:00:00.960 - 00:00:07.810, Speaker A: Hi, I'm Anna from the Zero Knowledge podcast, and I'm here with Victor from Hash Flow. Welcome to Sovereign radio.
00:00:08.110 - 00:00:09.462, Speaker B: Thank you for having me.
00:00:09.606 - 00:00:13.010, Speaker A: Yeah, so we're here at the modular summit. How have you liked it so far?
00:00:13.350 - 00:00:46.364, Speaker B: I think it's been amazing. We had certainly better weather yesterday, but throughout the venue has been fantastic. Very well organized. A lot of brilliant minds out here, had amazing conversations, got to see some of the new projects in the space. And that has been great for me as well, because as some people know from yesterday, hash flow has been evolving its research into the world of ZK. So this summit has been very, very relevant to us. We kind of took a peek at it last year in Paris, where we're kind of thinking about how to the direction of the research of where the world was going.
00:00:46.364 - 00:00:52.806, Speaker B: But it's fantastic to be here. So super, super pleased, very happy to be meeting new people.
00:00:52.948 - 00:01:06.230, Speaker A: Nice. I think we should hear a little bit about what hash flow is, maybe what the problem you're trying to solve is. Actually, you just said it changed yesterday, so maybe we should start with what was it and what is it today.
00:01:06.930 - 00:01:42.760, Speaker B: I wouldn't consider it a change, but let me kind of take a step back and talk about the ethos of what we've been trying to build for the past four years. So it all started in 2020. In 2020, Defi Washington created, were adopted by the masses. We had Defi summer, and everything kind of started with Uniswap. Uniswap was so brilliant and so popular that a lot of people created forks. However, because of liquidity segmentation, and generally lack of liquidity for long tail assets, people had this problem of slippage. So on the one hand, everyone was enjoying trustless products, everyone was enjoying better financial paradigms.
00:01:42.760 - 00:01:55.406, Speaker B: However, there were these tricky things that were happening on chain, and slippage in itself is, I think of it as a primitive for the broader problem of MeV that kind of came to light in 2021.
00:01:55.518 - 00:02:01.342, Speaker A: Can you define slippage? Is this just like inefficient trades, sort of. Or how do you think of it?
00:02:01.406 - 00:02:23.608, Speaker B: It's. When you think of it, when I think of uniswap, the beauty of it is they don't need a middleman. So the pricing happens based on how much liquidity you have in a pool. So in general, if you have training Ethereum for USDC, you have a certain amount of Ethereum and a certain amount of USDC. If there's scarcity on USDC, the price of USDC is going to be high, and the price of Ethereum is going to be low. It's crossing Ethereum. The reverse happens.
00:02:23.608 - 00:02:57.262, Speaker B: Now, how does this understand the markets? How does this converge? The price of ETH to the correct one? The answer is arbitrage. So whenever the price diverges, traders will arbitrage the pool. The pool balances are going to switch one direction or the other and the price is going to get normalized. But the problem here is that this arbitrage happens or this kind of price conversion happens at the time of the transaction. So then in Ethereum, one technical aspect of it is that transactions are public in the mempool before they get executed. They get picked up by the notes, right?
00:02:57.326 - 00:02:57.930, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:02:58.270 - 00:03:25.670, Speaker B: So therefore people would be able to see what other people are trading before they were trading. And because of the auction system, people would be able to, I mean, naturally the price would move, right? So it's kind of like the stock market. The more you're buying of something, the more expensive it's going to be. And the more you're selling, the less you're going to get for it. But the problem here with Mev, like at least how it manifested at first, that people would see whether people were trading and they would leverage that to make money. So the so called sandwich attacks came to life. Right.
00:03:25.670 - 00:04:08.388, Speaker B: So with hash flow, we were trying to bring a slightly more practical approach, like more hybrid approach, in that we wanted to preserve safety. We wanted to make sure that people were self sovereign and could manage their own money in their wallets and didn't have to trust other parties. But on the other hand, we wanted them to kind of not have to expose themselves to this. So we pioneered the RFQ system. In essence, what this is, is that we brought market makers that were market making on centralized exchanges, and we converted them into on chain ODC desks. So they would, users would request a quote, say they were trying to swap ten eth, and then market makers would give them a quote that was at a fixed rate. The only caveat is would have an expiry.
00:04:08.388 - 00:04:30.996, Speaker B: So pretty much like an OTC trade, you're given a rate and you tell, well, you can do this for the next 5 seconds, do you want it or not? And this was great because it had, you know, it was zero slippage trading. And the rates were really good because, you know, they were aligned with centralized exchanges. Naturally, these market makers would hedge their trades on venues like binance and Coinbase. Okay, right. So that was, that was how we started. Right.
00:04:31.068 - 00:04:33.534, Speaker A: You just used like the term RFQ.
00:04:33.662 - 00:04:34.014, Speaker B: Yes.
00:04:34.062 - 00:04:34.638, Speaker A: What is that?
00:04:34.694 - 00:04:35.782, Speaker B: Request for quote.
00:04:35.886 - 00:04:36.718, Speaker A: Okay, request for quote.
00:04:36.734 - 00:04:42.278, Speaker B: Request for quote. So I request for a quote. I get a quote. I decide whether I want it, if I want it executes fully, permissionlessly.
00:04:42.334 - 00:04:42.846, Speaker A: Okay?
00:04:42.958 - 00:04:46.654, Speaker B: I don't have to give custody. I don't have to trust anyone. If I don't want it, I just pass on it.
00:04:46.742 - 00:04:53.870, Speaker A: I have a question also about market makers. We hear that term a lot, but who are they? What are they?
00:04:53.950 - 00:04:54.902, Speaker B: What are they?
00:04:55.046 - 00:05:06.580, Speaker A: Are they individuals with lots of tokens? Are they companies? What's the like? Are they, are they the ones just doing arbitrage? Are they also, like, doing the MeV?
00:05:08.080 - 00:05:35.216, Speaker B: The answer could be yes and no to all the above market maker capturing the MeV. Rather, they could be, they could be some defi market makers. You know, you see market makers that are less traditional and understanding the space more. And they understand there's a lot of value in arbitrage, a lot of value in MeV. And MeV is nothing seen as necessarily as a bug, but it's more of a market. But what market makers do, in essence, and this concept comes from finance. It's not invented by crypto.
00:05:35.216 - 00:06:01.704, Speaker B: It's been there forever. The idea is like, when you're trading something, it has a price. It has a price that typically means the last traded price. So you think of Nvidia stocks, say, being worth $100. Now, if you have $10 million worth of Nvidia stock, the chances are you won't be able to sell for dollar 100 because markets are, are pretty much auctions. A bunch of people are telling you, I'm willing to sell X shares at this price. And people are telling, I'm willing to buy X shares at this price.
00:06:01.704 - 00:06:11.584, Speaker B: However, you can't imagine that people are going to be there in front of computers placing orders every single time the market changes, right? So then if you only had, or.
00:06:11.592 - 00:06:15.192, Speaker A: Like, filling orders, you mean like, is it. Or you mean placing orders?
00:06:15.256 - 00:06:51.050, Speaker B: Placing. Because when you look at a order book, when you look at the stock market, you will see that there's a v shaped structures with bids and asks, right? And the idea is that every single time you go there, there will be someone always willing to buy and someone always willing to sell. And those are typically market makers. So when you see those orders kind of changing as the price moves, changing almost instantaneously, those are orders made by market makers. What they typically do is that they always provide liquidity. They make markets. They create your ability to sell and buy whenever you want.
00:06:51.050 - 00:07:35.770, Speaker B: So what they will typically do is they will run their algorithms on multiple venues. And once you're say you have, suppose you have an ETH market, and you're saying, I want to sell ten eth. You're selling it against typically, I mean, either other users or market makers, but typically against the market maker who's going to buy it from you. And they will employ what's called delta neutral strategy. And this strategy means that they have ten eth more than they had before, which means they have to sell it somewhere else. So you can think of this as a liquidity mesh across every single exchange. So if there's liquidity coming from retail on this exchange, these market makers are going to run their books on every single venue, and they're going to expand this liquidity all over to another exchange where someone else might want to trade.
00:07:35.770 - 00:07:52.720, Speaker B: And some of them also put their own bids and their own ask, because they're willing to play the markets based on speculation. So they make sure that the markets are liquid. They are. The reason when you go to Coinbase, you will always see bids and you will always see asks. It's not regular people putting orders, it's usually market makers.
00:07:52.760 - 00:08:10.392, Speaker A: So, but like, when Uniswap came out and all of a sudden it was like this, LP and amms did that in a way, like wipe out the need for the market maker. Like everyone, all the, like, this big decentralized pool of users became the market makers and they became the l peers that, like, created that liquidity. Right?
00:08:10.576 - 00:08:11.968, Speaker B: You can think of it, I mean.
00:08:12.064 - 00:08:14.064, Speaker A: Or were there still market makers there?
00:08:14.192 - 00:08:22.536, Speaker B: There were. So I think of it in two ways. On one hand, Uniswap created the ability for people to market make. So how did it work?
00:08:22.568 - 00:08:23.168, Speaker A: Anyone to do it?
00:08:23.184 - 00:08:23.536, Speaker B: Anyone?
00:08:23.608 - 00:08:24.080, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:08:24.160 - 00:08:54.820, Speaker B: Including institutions. There were institutions that were yield farming, that were putting their money into uniswap. So technically it democratized a little bit of market making, and v two was a little bit more plain version of that, where you would just put your assets, get LP tokens. V three became way, way different. You need to actually have trading strategies. And also v three alleviated a lot of the issues with v two too, with slippage and impermanent loss, there was this concept of impermanent loss for LP's. So, yes.
00:08:54.820 - 00:09:33.390, Speaker B: On the other hand, however, people were trading more on Uniswap and less on centralized exchanges, which was brilliant. This is something that we really support in the movement. You want transparent market making actors adapted to the situation. Some of them created their own strategies on Uniswap. Some of them started doing arbitrage so arbitrage traders kind of came to be as well, because Uniswap created this open API for understanding arbitrage. So everyone, they created these markets for everyone to come in and ARB, because that's how the protocol works. It's a protocol that's based around economics as well as tech.
00:09:33.550 - 00:09:40.736, Speaker A: I want to go back to your project, though. Now we understand what has been out there. What are you doing?
00:09:40.928 - 00:09:50.328, Speaker B: So hash flow, RFq was there. We collaborated with a lot of these market makers and brought a lot of liquidity into the platform so people could.
00:09:50.344 - 00:09:51.800, Speaker A: Actually trim it into your platform.
00:09:51.920 - 00:10:20.430, Speaker B: Into the hashlo platform. Yeah, used to be ours. We decentralized it by governance. Some parts of it have to run on servers. For example, Websocket servers, connecting to market makers, similar to other exchanges, because these market makers have their own, their own computers and servers that need to work so directly connect to Ethereum. It's low latency communication. There's a lot of qps to update price fees and so on.
00:10:20.430 - 00:10:56.726, Speaker B: But we built that. And naturally, we also have this thesis that people shouldn't really use their experience, user experience at the core. So the reason we built is because we wanted people to have more fun trading and to feel better trading. So therefore, when the multi chain thesis came to life, our natural evolution was, well, we want to build cross chain, but not in a bridge to wrap token way. So we pioneered native cross chain swaps. So what that meant is you can actually swap via these market makers as well. You can swap your native eth for native, say BNB.
00:10:56.726 - 00:11:43.840, Speaker B: So you would send real eth, you would get real BNB, you could bootstrap your account for gas and so on. And I think the next evolution of that, we also, I think, were the first ones to build native swaps between EVM and Solana. So now you can send real eth and you can get real sold. There's no more wrapping, there's no more anything like that. But then again, there is an interesting thing that kind of ties back into market makers, into amms and uniswap pools, is that they become imbalanced. And when they become imbalanced, arbitrage traders come in because the Uniswap pool is trading at a loss, quote unquote, because it's trading at a loss. The uniswap pools, imbalanced liquidity is always going to be more competitive than that side of the spread of a centralized exchange.
00:11:43.840 - 00:12:08.738, Speaker B: So therefore it's going to be more competitive than RFQ as it converges. To the price. RFQ becomes more competitive as it diverges again on the other side. It becomes competitive on one side and less competitive on the other side. So therefore, RFQ is not a universal answer to the best route that you take on chain. From a user perspective, we don't really care that one protocol is imbalanced. If there's a better path for the user, we need to give that to the user.
00:12:08.738 - 00:12:35.632, Speaker B: So therefore, in our latest iteration of the product, we built aggregator plus, which is essentially a Defi aggregator, very similar to products like one inch. It leverages the barter infrastructure, which is one of the top housewap solvers, and essentially enhances the DeFi ecosystem with RFQ liquidity, which is very tight, zero slippage liquidity, thus creating what we think is the best experience trade in one chain. So that's what we've done today. That was before yesterday.
00:12:35.696 - 00:12:53.758, Speaker A: Oh, wow. Wait, I have one question about that, though. Is it almost like two systems happening in parallel though? When people are using any of the on chain stuff, they're actually using the mechanisms of that protocol. And when they're using yours, they're using this like market makers instead. Are they sort of like opting for one or the other?
00:12:53.854 - 00:13:06.190, Speaker B: They're fully composable. So if you go to Ashwagator plus today and you try to get a route, the chances are that there will be hash liquidity, uniswap liquidity, potentially curve liquidity and other liquidity kind of together.
00:13:06.350 - 00:13:10.174, Speaker A: I see. And then you're just, is there something picking what the best way through is?
00:13:10.262 - 00:13:12.238, Speaker B: Exactly. And that's the aggregation algorithm.
00:13:12.294 - 00:13:16.210, Speaker A: Got it. Okay, what's today? What's changed? What happened?
00:13:16.290 - 00:13:53.292, Speaker B: Things are changing. Okay, now going back to the basics. Suppose you want to have the best user experience, right? The best user experience makes you the most money, is the most intuitive, gives you access to the largest amount of products, right. Whether it's perpetuals or options or multi hedging strategy, no matter what you want to do. So unfortunately, people don't really get to see, um, the limitations, the speed of light. So light is very, very fast, right. Um, on earth, it's perceived that instantaneous, okay, unfortunately, right.
00:13:53.292 - 00:14:23.404, Speaker B: But it's not instantaneous. And the reality is that the network, a network round trip between New York and Singapore takes about 350 milliseconds, which is a lot in the world of trading. Now, in order to get consensus between two machines, they can be situated anywhere on earth. So you have to look at worst case scenario. So for consensus, you're essentially limiting the latency of the system to a top 300, 350 milliseconds.
00:14:23.492 - 00:14:24.124, Speaker A: Okay.
00:14:24.252 - 00:14:53.790, Speaker B: Which is slower than the best experiences on centralized exchanges. So naturally, this poses the problem that we're dealing with, which is, well, if you decentralize, things are going to be slower. If things are slower, it's not going to attract market makers. If occupancy is on track, there won't be liquidity. If there's no liquidity, trading experience is bad. Right? There have been a lot of, and there still are attempts to build order books on chain. Those order books are making clear trade offs that one millisecond is not the target.
00:14:53.790 - 00:14:59.634, Speaker B: 300 milliseconds is okay. It's better than seconds, which is what you would see like on Ethereum or whatever.
00:14:59.682 - 00:15:00.218, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:15:00.314 - 00:15:37.528, Speaker B: And a lot of projects on Solana did this. Unfortunately, we still don't think that's ultimate. We think it could be a good trade off and people could be using it, but it's not. Ultimately, the ultimate experience is Nasdaq, it's binance. But does it really mean that it has to be unsafe? And up until long ago, I think the answer was yes. But in the past couple of years, this is where it boils down to ZK. ZK allows you to run an arbitrary amount of computation with constant proof of verification time, which means that you can run whatever you want and you can prove it.
00:15:37.528 - 00:16:09.416, Speaker B: Within. On Ethereum is about 300k worth of gas today. Now, what's the caveat here? The caveat is that proving costs are like really high. However, the research has been advancing a lot, right. And what was very expensive two years ago is actually within reach today. And we've been researching, like, ways to build these centralized exchanges with better trust guarantees. So our thesis is, you can run something that has, that makes no compromise to user experience.
00:16:09.416 - 00:17:11.570, Speaker B: You can run it in a way that allows self sovereign traders to take full custody of their keys, and people who decide to trust you more to give you partial trust on fund movement so that their user experience is better, similar to binance, however, you can settle this entire thing on the blockchain through zero knowledge computation and cheap data availability. So both of them, both zero knowledge and data availability are very important to us here, because if zero knowledge gets cheaper and storage gets cheaper, then we can theoretically prove a very large amount of computation, which was not possible before by compressing the computing, compressing the data. So that is what we're evolving into. We're building a stack for exchanges to build this, to achieve that high performance, but sell their assets on chain so that they don't rug their users. So again, it's a hybrid approach similar to our initial RFQ, but it's a little bit more ambitious because ZK has gotten more performant and more ambitious as well.
00:17:11.610 - 00:17:16.082, Speaker A: Wow. Well, it's good to hear you're working now into the ZK space. I know it well.
00:17:16.146 - 00:17:17.270, Speaker B: That's why I'm here today.
00:17:18.250 - 00:17:31.350, Speaker A: So unfortunately we don't have any more time. It's a shame because now that you've just brought up ZK, I have more questions, but I want to say thank you so much for sharing with us what we did and I guess if people want to find out more, where do they go?
00:17:31.730 - 00:17:43.482, Speaker B: They can come to hashflow.com dot. There will be a exchange launching with our new ZK stack within the next two months, I believe. And also follow our Twitter hashflow.
00:17:43.546 - 00:17:44.130, Speaker A: Thanks so much.
00:17:44.170 - 00:17:45.138, Speaker B: Thank you so much for having me.
00:17:45.194 - 00:17:48.690, Speaker A: And I want to thank you for watching this episode of the Sovereign radio.
