00:00:02.000 - 00:00:17.310, Speaker A: Is less than the kind of costs that validators would incur to commit fraud, then this is like a crypto economically secure system. But the validators from the l one.
00:00:17.350 - 00:00:18.830, Speaker B: They are also validating l two.
00:00:18.870 - 00:00:19.166, Speaker C: Right.
00:00:19.238 - 00:00:22.638, Speaker B: And they're taking on the additional risk to slash among these l two s.
00:00:22.814 - 00:00:31.022, Speaker A: So they can only be slashed on the l one. But, yeah, they basically choose which roll ups that they want to provide these precomps for.
00:00:31.086 - 00:00:33.294, Speaker B: But they can do multiple different tools, right?
00:00:33.342 - 00:00:58.432, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Yeah. So we have, like, an interface in our AV's that allows them to opt in and out of different roll ups. And in the case of hyperlink, we have, like, our special sauce is, like, modular security, which is like this settlement between two chains. We have, like, basically generalized. So roll up bridges, obviously, like, people users are very familiar with and they kind of understand.
00:00:58.432 - 00:01:33.460, Speaker A: But, you know, a lot of roll ups now have switched to posting to celestia. Right. And we can still have the same construction using, like, a, you know, celestial light client to communicate the state routes to Ethereum, or we can use stride, you know, stake Tia. So, basically, any shared settlement layer, this construction can work. It doesn't have to be roll ups. Like, it could be any chains that have a strong settlement mechanism to some shared settlement layer.
00:01:34.080 - 00:01:36.220, Speaker B: And the layer one, that is the AV's.
00:01:37.120 - 00:02:00.450, Speaker A: So our AV's doesn't actually have any consensus. So AV's is just implemented in smart contracts, and there's no consensus amongst our validator set, either. So, yeah, the AV's you can think of is just like the state machine on the l one, but it's all smart contracts. Hey, what's up, York?
00:02:02.230 - 00:02:07.958, Speaker C: We're gonna have a pretty interesting panel on the other side, the next room, if you guys are interested in joining.
00:02:08.054 - 00:02:08.446, Speaker A: Cool.
00:02:08.518 - 00:02:09.726, Speaker B: He's giving a panel right here.
00:02:09.798 - 00:02:11.622, Speaker A: Right here, right now.
00:02:11.726 - 00:02:12.970, Speaker D: Private presentation.
00:02:14.750 - 00:02:15.676, Speaker C: I'll give you guys to.
00:02:15.718 - 00:02:16.664, Speaker B: Is it busy over there?
00:02:16.712 - 00:02:18.056, Speaker C: No, but it's because it's so hard.
00:02:18.088 - 00:02:19.180, Speaker B: To find the room.
00:02:21.760 - 00:02:23.980, Speaker C: Some pretty cool talks happen over there.
00:02:33.840 - 00:02:34.820, Speaker A: No, no.
00:02:36.080 - 00:02:47.000, Speaker B: So, like, I'm not too familiar with the ABS stuff. Yeah, that's, like, the mechanism from igalia, right? That's the distributing the security across.
00:02:47.500 - 00:02:48.480, Speaker A: Yeah. So.
00:02:50.900 - 00:02:52.988, Speaker B: They facilitate the economic security.
00:02:53.164 - 00:03:56.470, Speaker A: Yeah. So, basically, like, staked ETH can be delegated to any AV's or any operator. In our case, it's a hyperlane validator, which means I like, as a user, I can take my stake, these, and I can say, I want to delegate it to this validator, this hyperlink validator, and earn some additional yields. So it makes the LST is more productive at no additional cost of capital. And in this type of construction, I would argue at least that you're not really taking on much additional counterparty risk beyond the like, you basically have to assess the roll up bridges. But we have like good frameworks for underwriting that now. So yeah, I think like this is how I see basically us achieving the like, future where users can just move between roll ups like, yeah, in a chain abstracted way.
00:03:56.470 - 00:04:20.960, Speaker A: And this is like basically an insurance market. So users will like, when they send this message, they actually pay in our, in our protocol, they pay a fee which covers some of these costs. So one of the fees they're paying is basically the insurance premium on the validators taking on that risk. And validators will basically compete for how fast they can provide this service.
00:04:21.660 - 00:04:27.480, Speaker B: But then hyperlane is basically the set of validators that is doing the communication between rotors.
00:04:28.490 - 00:04:47.390, Speaker A: So there's validators, and then what's missing here is the relayer, which is like a permissionless role that anyone can do. But yeah, basically the relayer is the one that actually submits the transaction. The validators are mostly just off chain, and the relayer aggregates the validator signatures.
00:04:48.770 - 00:04:52.790, Speaker B: Every relay, like every message relay needs to go via validator.
00:04:55.370 - 00:05:34.074, Speaker A: In this specific, like, because the verification mechanism prescribes that. Yeah, then that's true. But if we were just going, let's say from ethereum l one to l two in hyperlane, like we, we can, you can have the verification mechanism just be like, oh, the native bridge. And then there's no validator set. Right? So that's the modular security aspect. This is like a configurable, this is like a smart contract interface that can verify any proof data about the origin chain. So it could be a ZK lake client, it could be the roll ups, like native bridge, it could be this type of threshold signature.
00:05:34.074 - 00:05:38.750, Speaker A: That's what this module, we call them interchange security modules.
00:05:40.170 - 00:05:50.994, Speaker B: And then when does hyperlaying seriously scale? Is that when there's a billion roll ups talk to each other or skills alongside Eigen layer scaling?
00:05:51.162 - 00:06:36.370, Speaker A: Yeah. So my view is you don't actually need that much economic security because I think users, like, at least retail users, are not moving a lot of money across rollups. And I think that's more of an institutional use case. And they're probably going OTC or through winter mute or someone. Well, so the challenge with Eigen Lair is like, you need to pay, you need to pay the stake delegation enough to justify their, like, opportunity cost of capital.
00:06:37.270 - 00:06:38.730, Speaker D: That's the challenge.
00:06:40.360 - 00:06:43.980, Speaker A: Yeah, you have to pay. You have to pay operators enough.
00:06:45.440 - 00:06:48.632, Speaker D: Unless your market cap is gigantic.
00:06:48.816 - 00:07:33.512, Speaker A: Yeah. So the way our system works is we charge a fee for people to. I guess I don't have it in one of these diagrams, but we charge a fee on the origin chain to basically send a message. And that covers both the cost of the relayer submitting the transaction over here and the security provisioning. So in this construction, the security provisioning is the validator set, who is providing the economic security for this message to be verified. And you can scale that with the content of the message if you want to. So let's say the message is ten USDC.
00:07:33.512 - 00:08:26.752, Speaker A: The premium. The mental model here is definitely an insurance market. So the premium is going to be a few bips on whatever the amount of value at risk is. Think of it as insuring your house. It's going to scale with the assets value that has been assessed by some institutional body. But yeah, you can think of, like, for simple asset transfers, it's very discreet to reason about, like, how much stake you need to cover the risk. But it gets more complicated when you have like a cross chain liquidation or like a Dao doing like a cross chain action, because it's more difficult to assign a monetary value to that message.
00:08:26.752 - 00:09:42.980, Speaker A: And that's where you need to have basically like a more sophisticated assessor of like, the insurance market. You need to have like some sort of, you know, body that's deciding what the, like, risk tolerances should be. And like, we'll basically have kind of a DAO that is, you know, deputizing some body. Maybe it's like gauntlet or one of these type of like, risk analytics labs that can look at that type of like, thing because, yeah, this is pretty analogous to like, or Tarun actually gave a talk yesterday at the alt layer day on the kind of risk for AV's slashing. And one thing he drew an analogy to is like, the risk is similar to lending protocols that have, like, cascading liquidations, where if there's like a single pool of stake opted into many avss, if one AV's has a slash, then the profit, or like, then the cost of corruption, and let's say the hyperlink AV's goes down, but the profit from encryption stays the same. So it might actually incentivize someone to then commit fraud on the next AV's. So there's kind of like this.
00:09:42.980 - 00:10:15.022, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. So there's kind of this cascading risk in these AV's delegations. And so you really need to be very sophisticated to analyze the risk for a stake delegation to be in many different abs's. And I think, yeah, shops like Gauntlet and these LRT vault companies are basically. That's their, like, that's their edge is basically competing on that kind of like risk.
00:10:15.126 - 00:10:18.102, Speaker B: And you're partnering with those specific risk assessors.
00:10:18.206 - 00:10:39.690, Speaker A: I mean, yeah, we plan to. It's still early days, right? Like slashing isn't even enabled, but yeah, we plan to. And also we also have to think about how much we need to pay out. Right. Because that's another like input to this function of like, you know, will everyone withdraw if we're not paying enough? Which then like makes the system.
00:10:39.990 - 00:10:42.170, Speaker B: How do you choose different risk sisters?
00:10:42.710 - 00:11:05.048, Speaker A: It's a good question. Yeah. So we need to have some sort of like Dao to like decide who's like a reputable like actor or whatever. It's similar to like Defi, right. You have like daos who contract out to like different shops. I'm biased because I worked at Gauntlet previously, but yeah, I.
00:11:05.094 - 00:11:08.560, Speaker D: What's the proportion that can be slashed with TP?
00:11:09.500 - 00:12:15.580, Speaker A: So that's actually part of the interface to Eigen layer is you have to configure basically the heuristic that you're using for how you scale up and down the slash. But I don't know if there's a ceiling on how much. I think it's like a smart contract function that you implement so you can, like, you can define it as an AV's basically. Well, slashing is not enabled yet in eigen layer, but I. When they do. Yeah, and I think the market, or like the, I guess the like, you know, I think the market will basically like adjust how much steak is actually an Eigen layer before slashing goes live. I think they're all just like, you know, mining airdrop or whatever.
00:12:15.580 - 00:12:27.666, Speaker A: I mean, we'll see. I think the market is becoming more competitive with like symbiotic and kerak. And these other protocols usually migrate.
00:12:27.698 - 00:12:30.042, Speaker B: There are recent protocols.
00:12:30.106 - 00:13:12.814, Speaker A: Good question. We're talking with them. I mean, the answer is honestly no. Or Eigen layer at least has quite a complicated integration surface area because most of our off chain infrastructure, like the validator client and everything we've had in production for, you know, years now, we don't have to rebuild a lot of the off chain stuff. So it's mostly just smart contract surface area, which is like maybe easier to build, but obviously, like there's a lot of risk in that contract surface area. So you need to, like, get it audited. Get it.
00:13:12.862 - 00:13:14.686, Speaker B: You know, so you wouldn't even want to do it.
00:13:14.838 - 00:13:21.650, Speaker A: Well, I think we. I think we'll go wherever there's, like, cheap economic security. Right.
00:13:22.910 - 00:13:25.410, Speaker B: Would you ever do multiple or just try to.
00:13:26.070 - 00:14:07.780, Speaker A: Yeah, I think we might do multiple. We might even have, like. So we also want to extend this model to, like, non ethereum settlement layers where maybe there isn't, like, a, you know, canonical restaking protocol. And so we might even have our own, like, proof of stake system on certain chains and, like, the longer tail. But, yeah, I mean, I think what we've seen is, like, the restaking protocol teams, like, are. They still have a lot to figure out. And so it's kind of, like, hard to.
00:14:07.780 - 00:15:25.072, Speaker A: It's hard to work with them on the engineering side. So we've been trying to, like, hedge a bit of. But yeah, yeah, I don't know as much about the roll up teams. I mean, we've been trying to, like, we've been trying to pitch this to, like, because this is basically like the super chain as well. Like, everyone's kind of trying to build towards this style of thing where it's easy to move between roll ups. And we've been trying to collaborate with some of them on it, and I think some of them view this as their in protocol revenue stream, and so they're maybe a little bit afraid to leak that edge, but, yeah, it's like, ephemeral chains. Yeah.
00:15:25.072 - 00:15:28.900, Speaker A: So just making the collateral and the bridges productive for, like, defi.
00:15:29.440 - 00:15:30.220, Speaker D: Yes.
00:15:36.700 - 00:15:37.724, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:15:37.772 - 00:15:40.440, Speaker D: So, like, now you can see also.
00:15:41.060 - 00:17:07.134, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. The bridges just have this massive pool of, like, unproductive collateral that they can, like, try and leverage up on. I think it's a little dangerous, but we're also doing this, like, like, with the, like, there's this concept of, like, I don't know if you guys have seen the native restaking on l two s, but you can basically mint an LRT on an l two by having the interop protocol go to the l one and then deposit the Eth into one of these lrts and then get the LRT back. But you can do that in such a way where you're not incurring the l one costs that the user would have. Yeah, so the way they work. So we're doing this with Renzo right now, but the way it works is they basically reserve some collateral on the l one for minting on many different l two s, and you can basically kind of, like, optimistically give the user this, like, minted representation on the l two and then just wait for settlement. Yeah.
00:17:07.134 - 00:17:31.209, Speaker A: And this is, you know, part of the reason why they're, like, constantly battling the DPEG or whatever. But, like, that's also how you compete, I guess. But, yeah, I think this concept of making the bridge collateral productive will become more and more in vogue, I guess.
00:17:31.629 - 00:17:34.449, Speaker E: Do you think more roll ups are going to use the blast model?
00:17:34.949 - 00:18:13.650, Speaker A: Yeah, I think so. I mean, the blast model, I think blast is not doing so well right now. In fact, they're mad at us and Renzo because easy ETH basically became, like, this way for everyone to get out of blasts, like, over hyperlink. And so, like, in, like, a couple weeks, their TVL has gone down by, like, over, like, I don't know. I don't know the actual numbers, but I think it's, like, at least 60% down or something. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's funny because Manta.
00:18:13.650 - 00:18:30.210, Speaker A: Manta was, like, one of our first big customers because we were doing Tia from Celestia to Manta, because they had a bunch of, like, lp incentives early on.
00:18:31.110 - 00:18:33.530, Speaker E: Not really. Fork's the same model.
00:18:35.470 - 00:19:18.606, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it looks so good. Yeah, Manta is. They have good marketing, I think. Are you working with other NRTs at Renta? We're talking to a few of them, I think. I mean, it's a way, like, you know, Renzo sees this and views this as a way for them to, like, they can. They have a synergy with this where they can provide some of their I lrt to our AV's, and then they can use the security from that to secure the native restaking on l two s, which is like, allowing users to get access to their LRT cheaply.
00:19:18.718 - 00:19:19.610, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:19:20.190 - 00:20:04.030, Speaker A: So, yeah, people are very interested in this type of model. We're talking with puffer and a few others about it as well. But I think Usde also has a model like this where you can, like, mint it from the l two s. So it also generalizes to, like, non LRT, like, non restaked assets. If you want to have this, like, collateralized thing on the L1 that you like, you're basically, you know, allowing. It's. It's like you're leveraging the separation of execution with these rollups to lower the costs for users.
00:20:04.030 - 00:20:21.710, Speaker A: You're still settling to the L1, but you use interop to basically amortize the costs such that user, every user doesn't have to interact with the L1 collateral, but you can just amortize the settlement over an interop protocol.
00:20:23.820 - 00:20:26.460, Speaker E: What's your take on the ZK account stuff?
00:20:26.580 - 00:20:27.620, Speaker A: ZK account stuff?
00:20:27.660 - 00:20:30.480, Speaker E: ZK accounts for bridging from Celestia. Is that competitive?
00:20:32.540 - 00:21:25.428, Speaker A: I feel like it's still early days for the ZK account stuff, although it seems interesting. I mean, I think our mental model is like, we don't, we're not actually competing on the security provisioning aspect. We care more about just having the messages settle over our protocol. And like what the security mechanism is that applications use is kind of like we don't want to be prescriptive of. And we think that like, yeah, it makes sense for applications to be able to like express their own preferences for what that mechanism should be. We just think that this construction will always be the fastest and cheapest. At least think about DK computing or building the proof will always be slower and more expensive.
00:21:25.428 - 00:22:06.410, Speaker A: And so you have to justify that somehow. And I think users will never want to incur that in their point of sale. Click on the UI. Maybe operators like validators might want to incur that. So you were asking earlier, oh, validators are taking on roll up settlement risk. Validators can be the ones who say, okay, I'm only going to opt in to slashing conditions from chains that have a ZK like client. And so then you basically move the slow and expensive cost from every user interaction to only when fraud occurs, which is a more efficient model.
00:22:06.410 - 00:22:33.992, Speaker A: I think this is maybe unpopular right now because all the ZK teams want to say how fast their benchmarks are or whatever, which is, it's cool as fuck, but I just think it'll never be cheaper. It's a fact of nature that it'll always be slower and more expensive. And so why have every user incur that cost when you can basically move that to an operator?
00:22:34.096 - 00:22:34.940, Speaker B: I don't know.
00:22:37.800 - 00:22:38.200, Speaker A: Cool. Yeah.
