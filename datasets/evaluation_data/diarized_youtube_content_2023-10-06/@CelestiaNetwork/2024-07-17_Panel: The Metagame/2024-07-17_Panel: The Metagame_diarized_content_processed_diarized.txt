00:00:01.960 - 00:00:08.250, Speaker A: All right, everyone, it's the last panel of day two. Hopefully you had a good couple of days. Come to modular summit.
00:00:10.030 - 00:00:10.850, Speaker B: Whoo.
00:00:12.030 - 00:00:12.662, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:00:12.726 - 00:00:16.010, Speaker B: Modular summit. Yeah, yeah.
00:00:19.630 - 00:00:25.670, Speaker A: This is the third annual, I guess I have to call it annual now, Endgame panel modular summit.
00:00:25.830 - 00:00:27.010, Speaker C: Oh, the meta game.
00:00:27.830 - 00:00:31.428, Speaker A: Sorry, sorry, sorry. Metagame time. But we've had this.
00:00:31.484 - 00:00:32.556, Speaker B: The inaugural metagame.
00:00:32.588 - 00:00:53.320, Speaker A: It's the inaugural metagame. But oftentimes this panel has been about monolithic first modular architectures in some shape or form. Unfortunately, this time we don't have anatoly. So I will do my best to be a Solana Edgelord if I can, but we'll see, we'll see. You can grade me at the end. On a scale of one to ten.
00:00:54.500 - 00:00:56.458, Speaker B: One to toli, one to two.
00:00:56.514 - 00:01:32.740, Speaker A: There we go. One to two. That's good. So I think the first thing that is probably worth talking about, which are, is what are the top three events that have happened over the last three years in both the monolithic and modular ecosystems? I'll take the monolithic, I'll be the fake anatoly for the three of you. What are some of the big highlights within the modular world that you've seen, and what are the big things you think went well?
00:01:34.080 - 00:02:24.360, Speaker C: I mean, for me, it's got to be the rise of roll up as a service providers, because if you think about it, it's kind of crazy, because when I first created Celestia, my vision has always been like, one day you'll be able to go on a website and then you'll be able to click a button and launch your own blockchain that is completely secure and decentralized. And this was before we had roll up frameworks. And to me, it's kind of crazy. That's actually possible today, now, or has been possible for the last year. And there's actually over 50 roll ups deployed in this way. You can actually go to Caldera or gelato or Conduit's website and deploy your own blockchain in the form of roll up in like 1 minute just by clicking a button. To me, that's actually crazy.
00:02:26.980 - 00:02:27.796, Speaker A: All right, cool.
00:02:27.828 - 00:03:07.210, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess there's been a few things over the last few years, and I don't know if we consider app chains modular ecosystem, but I would. The original incomplete. They're the OG OG modularity to be completed by, which has been completed by the celestial vision. I mean, the three big things in my mind that sort of happened in the cosmos ecosystem in the last three years. One was really the launch of IBC which was concomitant with the launch of osmosis. That happened together pretty much three years ago, almost to the day, a couple weeks. And that really kicked off the idea that the reality that you could have all these independent things, modular pieces that could really interoperate with each other.
00:03:07.210 - 00:04:00.502, Speaker B: So that was amazing. The second one's a bit sadder, and that was the terra collapse, which was a very humbling moment for all of us to get wrecked like that. Decentralized stablecoin just all of a sudden disappear. But it also demonstrated the fault tolerance element of the modular stack. One piece fails and goes away, but the other pieces still work. That's a big part of what makes modularity so appealing. Then the third, I guess, in my mind, is the Cosmos Hub's launch of interchange security, initially with Neutron and and Stride, two very exciting chains that launched with the Cosmos Hub, and now focusing on ICS V two, interchange security V two, to allow more kinds of chains to launch, even rollups.
00:04:00.502 - 00:04:22.230, Speaker B: Roll ups are chains, too. They can post data to Celestia and get a sequencer or validator set from the hub. And so the hub is becoming the best place to launch a chain. That's our mission for the hub, but it's still a close friend of rollups, and it's kind of an enabler. Hub was the first to do all this restaking stuff, which is now dominating. So it's coming back.
00:04:25.050 - 00:04:39.550, Speaker D: I remember back in the day, you could do, there was a one click bitcoin clone, so you could get a clone of a whole bitcoin. You could pick your proof of work, and you'd get a proof of work cloned that way. But I guess none of those work very well. I think that the ones that you get now with one click are actually viable, and that's pretty interesting.
00:04:40.010 - 00:04:46.030, Speaker C: I mean, the difference being that you don't have to bootstrap your own consensus network and security, but we also have hyperledgere.
00:04:47.200 - 00:04:49.536, Speaker D: You really don't want to be the weakest proof of work coin.
00:04:49.648 - 00:04:50.256, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly.
00:04:50.328 - 00:04:51.600, Speaker D: Bad recipe for disaster.
00:04:51.720 - 00:04:57.496, Speaker A: I mean, nice hash was a great business. Anything you want to add?
00:04:57.608 - 00:05:13.506, Speaker D: Yeah, I don't know. I think I've been spending a bunch of time with flashbots recently. I think it's really interesting how you can have changes to. You don't need to do everything through enshrining. I think doing things through sidecars is super interesting. Okay. But besides flashbots, I like talking about puffer finance.
00:05:13.506 - 00:05:35.322, Speaker D: I think that this is kind of underrated. It's pretty fascinating what they do. This is an application of trusted hardware. So it is related to that. It's been known for a long time that trusted hardware can change consensus protocols. Like you can upgrade a non fault byzantine fault tolerant protocol into. You can upgrade a crash fault tolerant protocol into a byzantine fault tolerant protocol just by adding the te.
00:05:35.322 - 00:06:15.326, Speaker D: It's like an anti equivocation thing. But that's like, okay, if I'm going to build a consensus protocol, I could include this in it and have this kind of difference. But what puffer does is really interesting. It doesn't require any change to the consensus protocol at all, but it's basically anti slashing for delegated staking using trusted hardware. So if you're a delegated staking provider, your users have to worry that you're going to do something wrong and get their principal slashed. But if they can give you a guarantee, look, it's running in an enclave that can't possibly do anything slashable. That gives you a cool defense that ended up being about trusted hardware, but really just sidecars was the point.
00:06:15.438 - 00:07:00.860, Speaker A: Look, we know you're the trusted hardware Trojan horse in every conversation. Don't worry. I'm going to take a slight detour and ask the following very simple question, which is, what is your definition of an application? Because actually 90% of this week, and this is a question that Tina is, Tina came up with realistically, which is 90% of this week, everyone's talked about the difference between infrastructure and applications, but there's kind of this very blurry line, especially in the modular world, right? Where like, if I'm launching my own chain, do I, does that count as infrastructure? So what are you, what, what in your mind, what's like the definition of an application? Like the. And how do you kind of define the difference between the two? It sounds very simple, but I actually think, I suspect everyone's gonna have a slightly different answer.
00:07:01.770 - 00:07:53.080, Speaker C: I guess for me, my general definition, maybe it's not a strict definition, but it's a product that a user who is not a developer would use and specifically use it, not just for investing in coins. I think that's what people generally mean when they say there's not enough applications and too much infrastructure, right? Like, yeah, I mean, if you think about it, crypto does have mainstream adoption, just not in the way we think. Like a big, a big portion of the US does have a Coinbase account and they own a bunch of coins, but the application right now is owning a bunch of coins. And to hold them for their value but I guess when people talk about applications is not just for investments, but they actually use them for things like payments.
00:07:54.290 - 00:07:57.670, Speaker B: But does that mean crypto has adoption or Coinbase has adoption?
00:07:58.410 - 00:08:07.750, Speaker C: I mean, both, right? I mean, Coinbase. I mean, if Coinbase wasn't crypto, it wouldn't be being sued by the SEC right now, would it?
00:08:08.810 - 00:08:46.194, Speaker B: Fair enough. I think it really depends on what level, because anything that's an application at one level could be infrastructure at another. Right? I mean, Celestia at some level is infrastructure, but it's also. You could think of it as an application built with the SDK or an application built on top of general purpose computing in the first place. But otherwise, yeah, it seems like generally. Maybe just beyond that. It seems like generally, what people are talking about when they're talking about applications is, like, real world users doing not just financial things, which apparently there's no one doing here.
00:08:46.194 - 00:08:47.270, Speaker B: Where are they.
00:08:50.050 - 00:08:50.910, Speaker A: Andrew?
00:08:51.250 - 00:09:01.430, Speaker D: Yeah, I think it's inherently relative. Every Twitter is a platform, and each tweet is an application that supports a like and repost feature. That's relative.
00:09:02.090 - 00:09:06.530, Speaker B: Okay, well, I guess each tweet is a platform, right? You can stick an iframe in it.
00:09:06.610 - 00:09:30.220, Speaker A: Yeah, that's true. That's true. Well, I guess, like, yeah, farcaster one's a real platform. That one's a real, real, real platform. All right, well, I'm not sure if Tina got the answer she was hoping for. So, initially, I wrote this question with Anatolia in mind, so I'm going to preface it with that, which is. Everyone on this panel has a different view of the role of advanced cryptography in blockchains.
00:09:30.220 - 00:10:15.258, Speaker A: Ethan gave a very strong defense of his view about half an hour ago whenever he gave us talk in terms of uses of tes, ZK, MPC, and fhe. Just as a summary, Celestia is adding ZK accounts, which, you know, allows you to have stronger covenants about DA without making your virtual machine a lot more complex. That's my summary. Solana is adding ZK compression, which is really just for light state diff and cheaper state updates, realistically, from the way they want to use it. Ethan has been working on TE based systems for credit, and Andrew has been working on TE stack of flashbots and.
00:10:15.274 - 00:10:18.906, Speaker B: TE based systems for credit based systems for credit.
00:10:18.938 - 00:10:45.190, Speaker A: Sorry. Also that. And the one question I kind of think about is, are these uses of advanced cryptography sort of evolutionary advances, like, they're more about optimizing an existing system and making it more efficient and safe and et cetera, or are they actually revolutionary in that they're enabling a new application. And if it is, then justify with some examples that you think are important.
00:10:47.610 - 00:11:39.510, Speaker C: I guess I can only talk about my respective use case or respective use case, which is EK accounts. I think in the short term it's evolutionary, but in the long term it's revolutionary. In the short term it's pretty much just making Celestia have the same functionality that you could argue ethereum already has, which is the ability to have a trust minimized bridge between the base layer and the roll up. But in the long term it could be revolutionary because ZK accounts allow you to have bridges between the l one, between celestial l one, and roll ups in a much, much simpler way. Specifically, it was previously thought that in order to extend the functionality of a layer one, you needed to add smart contracts to the chain. And that's what Vitalik argued. Like he had a blog post where he argued that because back in the day, bitcoin people were like, let's not add smart contracts.
00:11:39.510 - 00:12:49.180, Speaker C: It makes the chain too complex as all these issues, and to some extent they had a point, right? Because it does add a lot of complexity to layer one that creates problems like mev and state bloat and various stack vectors. But it turns out that you don't need to add smart contracts to extend the functionality of a layer one, or to achieve what's called functional escape velocity. For layer one, it turns out that you can just have a, you can actually have an on chain account like any normal account. But instead of that account being controlled by a public key, it can be controlled by a ZK program represented by a ZK verification key. And that allows you to achieve, in theory, complete functional escape velocity. That gives you all the benefits of a smart contract platform without having any on chain smart contracts. And I think in the long term that could be revolutionary in the long run because it avoids layer one from having all kinds of existential issues such as mev, which leads to block producers being centralized.
00:12:49.180 - 00:12:57.630, Speaker C: And so you basically completely sidestep all of these issues entirely while having the benefits of functional escape velocity.
00:13:00.090 - 00:13:57.534, Speaker B: I guess in my case, I think cycles is a revolutionary application. Of course I'm going to talk about cycles, but I do think in general, I mean, I agree with that point, that the cryptography, ZK and others are both evolutionary and potentially revolutionary in the long run. Arguably, technology, the coordination technology we're building here in general is supposed to be revolutionary, but it requires some additional pieces to actually get there, it seems. And cryptography is required to fill that in. But we also think tes are sort of part of that story with cycles. We want to build something that allows anyone, anywhere in the world, to participate in clearing debt and to clear the most debt for the most people with the least amount of money. And that's revolutionary in the sense that it could fundamentally change the structure of the financial system, which is primarily based around excluding all of you from being able to do clearing and allowing only the banks to get together and do clearing in their clearing houses.
00:13:57.534 - 00:14:39.964, Speaker B: And it's not really feasible or possible to bring the 200 million businesses or 6 billion, 7 billion people into a common clearinghouse. There's just too much complexity of financial contracts and overhead and counterparty risk and all this kind of stuff. And cycles design makes a unique, you know, it takes unique advantage of the properties of blockchains, atomic, multilateral execution. It requires privacy, which today we can only really do meaningfully with, with this technology, whether it's a te or, you know, in the future, MPC plus fhe or whatever, it'll. It unlocks this kind of revolutionary use case that we can't otherwise do without it. Right. People are always talking about, well, you know, can't you do this without a blockchain? Is it just, you know, more secure, more open, verifiable.
00:14:39.964 - 00:14:52.508, Speaker B: We can't actually do this without a blockchain because you can't do atomic multilateral settlement pretty much without one unless you're just willing to trust tons of intermediaries. I think this stuff can be very revolutionary.
00:14:52.684 - 00:15:28.630, Speaker D: I'd say it's definitely revolutionary. It's hard to give a good example of something that no one would do without cryptography, because the limit of what you can do with cryptography is what you can do with a trusted third party. And people are often really trusting. They're willing to share private keys with services to act as custodians. But I do think that there are examples where actually people won't even trust people for it. I think Shin's demo is really cool because going through that forgot password flow, that's what it looks like when you're falling for a scam. You're giving someone your forgot password flow.
00:15:28.630 - 00:15:59.590, Speaker D: And even besides the tes, just with TL's notary, I don't think we've even yet scratched the surface of surprising things you can do with that. Because, yeah, obviously you log into your bank while you aren't sharing that session with a backup drive. You're certainly not sharing it with other friends and family, but you can now create notarized, encrypted logs of the transcripts that you've had with secure sessions with web two apps. I think that's tremendously powerful, and I don't think we've yet seen all of the surprising things you can do with that.
00:16:00.730 - 00:17:02.416, Speaker A: Cool. So, now that we've talked about advanced cryptography, we've also talked about applications. One of kind of the, I think starting with the app chain version of the world, one of the promised futures of the promised land was the migration away from the Fat protocol thesis to the fat application thesis, where each chain would be its own sovereign nation, generate a bunch of user flow, generate a bunch of application volume flow. But if I look at the fat application thesis in 2024, the modular ecosystem didn't accrue the actual value from it. The monolithic world actually owns the number one consumer applications in crypto right now, which are meme coins. And if you think about things like, one thing about the fat application thesis, Washington, you run your own chain, you get all these fees. And those fees could be much more than the base chain if it was a roll up or other hub chains.
00:17:02.416 - 00:17:29.870, Speaker A: But arguably, the first network to really have an application earn more in fees per day, repeatedly, consistently, than the base protocol. Was Solana with pump fun, or continues to be nowadays? What do we kind of diagnose as the reasons for this? And where do we think the modular world goes from here to try to regain its superiority in the fat application thesis world?
00:17:31.810 - 00:18:09.346, Speaker B: Well, for one, if I were Toley, I would say Solana is a cosmos chain, which he has said, and on a scale of one to Toly, that's Toli. And the idea behind that is that it's a chain focused on a particular outcome, trying to optimize for being the fastest synchronous, composable platform in the world. And it seems like they're achieving that and they're proving out the use case of that. In Cosmos, we have Adam, which some have suggested is a meme coin for academics. I think that's you, right?
00:18:09.498 - 00:18:12.346, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely meme coin for nerds, which.
00:18:12.458 - 00:18:26.038, Speaker B: Was true in the past, maybe it's less true now. Now we're a serious platform launching blockchains. That's the Cosmos hub. We also. I mean, Cosmos does have a meme coin chain called Chihuahua. I don't think this has been a.
00:18:26.054 - 00:18:32.046, Speaker A: Success just from the fact that. Just look at the audience reaction to that already said.
00:18:32.198 - 00:18:38.534, Speaker B: Wawa. Yeah, I mean, it doesn't seem to be working, but I think bad kids.
00:18:38.582 - 00:18:41.422, Speaker A: Might be more successful than Chihuahua, to be honest.
00:18:41.526 - 00:19:14.130, Speaker B: Definitely, yeah. I mean, it's challenging to really understand. I think we're still early. We're only a few years into application based chains, and they are expensive and a big part of the roll up roadmap and Celestia's modular thesis that we can bring down the cost significantly. So maybe once we start to see a lot of rollups, we'll start to see the way that they accrue value. They have to build useful apps. Right now, it seems primarily what people want to do is they just want to gamble on, like, a fast synchronous platform.
00:19:14.130 - 00:19:20.386, Speaker B: And so Solana as app specific chain for doing that, might just win that.
00:19:20.418 - 00:19:23.034, Speaker A: So you're saying Solana is going to be pumped out. Fun chain soon?
00:19:23.202 - 00:19:24.350, Speaker B: It kind of is.
00:19:25.250 - 00:19:27.910, Speaker A: Okay, just make sure I have that one recorded.
00:19:28.810 - 00:19:30.750, Speaker B: I did not say that.
00:19:32.970 - 00:19:40.574, Speaker A: I mean, that is sort of the right. That is sort of the fat application thesis, though, right? Like, the application generating the fees takes over the chain.
00:19:40.642 - 00:19:41.290, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:19:42.110 - 00:19:44.090, Speaker A: Okay, mustafa.
00:19:44.470 - 00:19:47.998, Speaker C: I mean, you know, I love meme coins, but I guess, like, what's your.
00:19:48.014 - 00:19:48.910, Speaker A: Favorite meme coin first?
00:19:48.950 - 00:20:13.380, Speaker C: My favorite meme coin right now, pepe, just because I think it's the pepe that most is most likely to actually succeed. The most recent. The meme coin, that's the most recent meme coin that's likely to succeed. Because I don't like meme coins for the casino aspect of it. For me, I like beamcoin for, like, a very mid curve take or potentially low iq or even high iq take, which is that.
00:20:13.540 - 00:20:17.580, Speaker A: Why should high iq meme coin takes? I'm ready for it.
00:20:17.660 - 00:20:57.264, Speaker C: Yeah. Which is that, like, to me, I mean, like, since we got off the gold standard in 1971, like, why should only nation states compete in meme coinery, you know, like, so. But for me, I don't like the casino aspect of meme coins. I want to, like, I want to see, like, sustainable meme coins, you know, like, dutch coin. That's a meme coin that has existed for many years, you know, and I think that's. Pepe has a chance of doing that. But a lot of the Solana meme coins, as you said, has kind of been mostly motivated by, like, a casino style thing or, like, casino style activities.
00:20:57.264 - 00:21:07.660, Speaker C: And that's not what I'm interested in. Like, I'm. I didn't spend. I haven't been in the crypto space since 2011 to build a massive, speculative casino.
00:21:10.000 - 00:21:15.740, Speaker D: My favorite meme coin is still cryptokitties because it has a dutch auction okay, nice.
00:21:16.760 - 00:21:24.940, Speaker A: All right. Do you have any view on how modularity takes? I'm waiting for the te show. That's really what we're here for.
00:21:27.450 - 00:21:54.150, Speaker D: I don't really have many app chain thoughts in this app versus platform. What I would say is that I want to see more choice to users and more fine grained choices as float close down to the edge as possible. I like the idea of small apps having more control and optionality, including being able to migrate with all the users and tack to other platforms altogether. I don't know whether that's a feasible direction, but that's what I hope for.
00:21:55.490 - 00:22:29.322, Speaker A: Cool. As we talk about the rise of, I guess, the applications in Solana, one interesting thing is that the modular world, I would say, has been. I wouldn't say isolated, but certainly shielded in a lot of ways from Mev, in a way that Ethereum base, Ethereum and Solana have not. I think Solana Mev fees have touched $100 million a day in some days. So it's like, it's. I mean, it's one of the wildest markets a lot. I mean, the Solana Mev market is honestly crazier than Ethereum one nowadays.
00:22:29.322 - 00:23:08.560, Speaker A: So what do you think the modular world can do to kind of take its advantage where it is actually somewhat more. Quite a bit more complex for mev extraction to take place? Not that it won't happen, it's just that I think there's many more steps you have to jump through. And how do you build applications that take advantage of that? I think we saw a bunch of talks today that talked about that. I think Evan. I don't know where Evan is, but Evan used a picture of Max Resnick as a way to emphasize one of these. So, yeah. Where do you kind of view this kind of advantage, that expanding over time in which applications take advantage of it the most?
00:23:09.660 - 00:24:19.912, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I think applications are going to want to capture their own MeV and not really get to the base layer. And, yeah, it is early in terms of roll ups, having the tooling to capture that mev, but we are seeing some early products that allow that. For example, SCIP is doing some good work there. They have a Cosmos module that allows you to embed a sort of private mempool that allows you to capture mev. So I think in the future, when these tools become more and more mature, like deploying a dex directly on chain or on the l, one will become insane, especially as the barriers between these chains become more and more abstracted, such that liquidity is not going to be fragmented anymore as chains. Having a Dex or deploying, there will simply be no incentive to deploy Dex on an l one that leaks me b to the l one. And so I think, like, in some way, like, we're very similar mindset to Solana in the sense that I believe that all of the value or most of the value should accrue to the application and not the base layer.
00:24:19.912 - 00:24:44.120, Speaker C: But we kind of differ from Solana in the sense that we think that the order book or the trade does not need to be on a massive synchronous ledger on the l one. It can happen on the l two, and therefore the order flow can be captured by mev on the l two. And we can still, and that doesn't necessarily be fragmented if we have good abstraction across the chains.
00:24:45.780 - 00:25:46.000, Speaker B: Yeah, I gave a talk earlier today called defund the dealers about how we can work towards changing market macrostructure and microstructure to essentially reduce how much can be extracted from users by moving from a model of liquidity providing to liquidity saving. And a big part of that just involves incorporating privacy and batching into the regular execution environments. And so long as that stuff is not there, there's going to be tons of mev leaked. And I think, or I expect that we'll see a lot more development and adoption of those kinds of technologies, maybe starting in cosmos and celestial roll ups and so on, and then moving into the. I mean, of course, flashbots is already doing, trying to do this kind of stuff, but I think Penumbra just launched like a week ago or two weeks ago, and based around this kind of idea that we can reduce how much we leak using privacy and using batching. And so I think there's a lot of unexplored design space around that that I'm hoping we'll see more people develop on.
00:25:48.340 - 00:25:49.060, Speaker A: Andrew.
00:25:49.180 - 00:25:53.000, Speaker D: Yeah, I agree. Privacy and batching are the keys, I think.
00:25:54.030 - 00:25:59.886, Speaker A: Cool. All right, so we got one and a half minutes left, so I'll kind of go into.
00:25:59.918 - 00:26:05.290, Speaker B: Aren't you supposed to answer a question at some point? Wait, Sham Tolly.
00:26:05.750 - 00:26:16.462, Speaker A: Sham tolly. Okay, you want me to ask myself a question and look like an idiot? All right, let's figure out which question is best suited for this.
00:26:16.566 - 00:26:21.952, Speaker B: Pass it to Andrew. Let him ask whatever wanted. He wants to turn down number ten.
00:26:22.056 - 00:26:31.392, Speaker D: All right, so this question is for anatoly. Will Solana have anatoly, will Solana have a modular ecosystem? Given the recent interest in restaking on.
00:26:31.416 - 00:27:22.996, Speaker A: Solana, I think Solana will have some form of roll ups at some point. I think there's actually been a big shift for applications there to kind of control a lot more, especially in light of the high mev lately and the fact that certain applications have been crowding out other noisy neighbor problem type of stuff. I think the other thing is the restaking stuff in Solana actually seems to be kind of an interesting gambit, because initially it seems like, okay, well, what are the real applications? And ETH people want pre comps and all this stuff that's. Well, okay. Solana already has, in some ways, at lower latency, but I think there's starting to be some. Some interesting things, and we'll see. We'll see some weird applications in next year.
00:27:23.148 - 00:27:24.076, Speaker D: Great answer.
00:27:24.228 - 00:27:38.324, Speaker A: And my fake tolliness ends with the final question of Mustafa, which is, if that happens, do we. Do we do another modular versus monolithic panel, or is it all over if Solana becomes modular?
00:27:38.412 - 00:27:46.880, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, this is blockchain, you know, like, there's always tribes. So even if everyone's modular, there's going to be, like, a catholic version of modular.
00:27:47.580 - 00:28:02.660, Speaker A: Catholic modular. We talked about religion in the last panel about, like, praying to the destructive chips, and now we. Now we're having the catholic modular chain. You heard it here first. Everyone dressed as a nun for Halloween. All right, thanks, everyone.
