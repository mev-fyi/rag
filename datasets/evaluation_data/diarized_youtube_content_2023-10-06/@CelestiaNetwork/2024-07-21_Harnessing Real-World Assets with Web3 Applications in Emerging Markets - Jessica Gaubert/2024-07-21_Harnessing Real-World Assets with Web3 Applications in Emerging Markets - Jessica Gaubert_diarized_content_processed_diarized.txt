00:00:01.400 - 00:00:24.486, Speaker A: Okay. Hi, everyone. Thank you so much for joining. So, my name is Jessica. I'm the co founder of Araca. To give you a bit of background, I've been working in the websheet space for the past five years, especially focusing on financial inclusion in emerging markets. Prior to that, I was in the not for profit sector.
00:00:24.486 - 00:00:55.740, Speaker A: So nothing related to tech at all. But don't get me wrong, I've been definitely loving my Webster journey, not necessarily for the cool events like the one today of all the cool swag that we have, but really, because I do believe this technology has the potential to solve some of the toughest problem the world face. And so today I would like to share with you some insight. By the way, how do I. Sorry. Thank you. Sorry.
00:00:55.740 - 00:01:22.012, Speaker A: Okay. Okay, cool. We'll see. Okay. Yeah. So today I would like to share some insight with you about, you know, what I've learned within the past five years. Building financial services and especially web3 application to solve the need of real people and especially in emerging markets.
00:01:22.012 - 00:02:21.500, Speaker A: But before we get started, I would like to look back at the state of web3 today. So if you, you know, I've been in Brussels for the past four days, five days, same as you, not counting the days. And I've attended a lot of talks, event, presentation, and I think I've never heard the word adoption that many times in my life. And so everyone talk about how we can create products that drive adoption, or how we like to say it in web3, how to onboard the next billion of users, Rayd and myself included, I have the word adoption here. So I'm not kidding anybody. But however, I think there is a common mistake that we make in the space actually is we are talking about adoption really behind closed door. If you look at those, not that many today at the number, most of the people actually in web3, builder developers are based in us and Europe.
00:02:21.500 - 00:03:14.014, Speaker A: And to me that's kind of a problem and I will explain why after. But that's a problem because it feels like the community, it's kind of a small, tech centered and focused in developed country. And why is that a problem is because we see most of the crypto adoption actually happening in emerging markets. And this is no surprise because the needs between developed country and emerging market are totally different. So why there is high adoption in emerging market is because it doesn't come from a trend or trying a new technology. It really comes from a need. If you take example, like Nigeria or the country, there is still a lack of traditional financial system, very high inflation and so taking the case of Nigeria, which is top two in terms of crypto adoption, we have seen through the year an inflation that is absolutely insane.
00:03:14.014 - 00:03:55.966, Speaker A: So people had to kind of jump on using global stablecoin because they didn't have choice. If you look at remittances, this is the same case. There is a lot of people sending money across border, so from UK to Kenya and so on. And so the tools that they've been using for decades was western Union. It was the most useful to send money across border and without knowing most probably that western Union charge you probably a half of the amount that you're sending. So really adoption come really from a needs and something that is lacking in those markets. However, what we see happening is that people are still using western Union.
00:03:55.966 - 00:04:40.822, Speaker A: Why are people still using Western Union when we have a technology that allow you to transfer fund in an instant with little to no fees? And I think the problem is because there is such a big difference between those building and those leveraging the solution. And so that's to me one of the biggest roadblocks to adoption. Again attended a lot of talk. We talked a lot about infrastructure, about technological complexity. And I really struggle to understand how talking about tech complexity can drive adoption. We never talk about UBL user needs. What do these people need? What do they want? And so if you look, for example, just an example that I like sharing is about Gmail.
00:04:40.822 - 00:04:59.542, Speaker A: None of us know about Gmail infrastructure. We don't really care. We just want to send the email. We want to receive the email that has been sent in a second. We don't really care about the tech stack behind. That's how they convince us to use it. Right? And so to me this should be the same when talking about adoption.
00:04:59.542 - 00:05:47.504, Speaker A: We should think about a real user and we shouldn't think in their context. Taking the case of Nigeria again, which is very high in terms of crypto adoption, there is some solution that have been built within the ecosystem that are totally irrelevant because even if they have shown a lot of innovation in their market, there is so many people, even in urban area that rely on 2g network. Most of the people use an Android. Same with the design. If we don't want to talk about infrastructure, I saw so many applications with beautiful design, you can slide and do so many things. If you look at Kenya, where I do most of my user research, most of people have the first Android, they have broken screen. They put the luminosity down because to save some of the battery, some of their battery and they increase the text size.
00:05:47.504 - 00:06:21.240, Speaker A: Sorry. So when you look at this, it's like, okay, it destroyed totally the UX UI we tried to build for those people. And so to me, if we want to keep talking about adoption, we really need to shift our mindset and take a user centered approach. And so that's what we did. And sorry, it's a bit messy, this slide, but that's what we did at Aracast. So we actually build a community credit protocol. And everything that we are building from like feature, products, material, share with people on the ground come from real user insights.
00:06:21.240 - 00:07:24.140, Speaker A: So we build a community credit protocol that connects RWA investor in the tokenized private market space to micro entrepreneur in emerging markets in need of capital to grow their businesses. And here we leverage the technology, not because there was something cool, but because it really solved the problem that no other technology was able to solve before. And this problem is the global credit gap. So you might know there is still 2.5 billion people that are financially excluded, and those people do not have access to credit or even like banking system. And so there is a lot of fintech that have come into play in the past few years that have tried to provide credit to this borrower, but they could serve only such a small portion of the people, because it was just too hard to provide credit to people that either don't have credit history, financial transaction or anything. It's just too hard to understand who is a good from a bad boy when you don't have history.
00:07:24.140 - 00:07:58.980, Speaker A: And so what happened is there is a lot of people that came together to form what we call community finance saving cycle, so on, to provide financial services to each other. That's something that we see a lot in Africa, Latin America, but even in Europe. And so those people come together, pull their savings on a weekly basis, and then get credit from each other. So here we have the case of Daisy, which is a real person, one of our users. Daisy is 32. She lives in Nairobi, Kenya. She has run businesses over two years, just a convenience store in her community.
00:07:58.980 - 00:09:03.350, Speaker A: She has been part of this community finance for many years. So she has saved with those people, she has taken credit, she has repaid, she has very good reputation within our community because of that, because people knows that she is a good person, she has financial stability and so on. The problem with Daisy is because all her transaction happen in cash within a community. There is no way for traditional financial institution or even fintech to understand is Daisy a good or a bad boa? And so, in what we try to do with archives, what if we could actually leverage Daisy's reputation within our community to give her access to credit. What if community inside could tell us if Daisy is credit worthy or not? And so let me explain how that might work. So within oprotocol, we try to do something very simple. So Daisy's friend and neighbor are actually able to vote for Daisy's credit.
00:09:03.350 - 00:09:26.922, Speaker A: Daisy's reputation, sorry. So allowing her to improve her reputation and get access to a loan. If she repays back her loan, her reputation improves and so does the one that votes for her. So we really rely on the joint liability of the group. If you're acting, well, I'm rewarded and so on. So Dejiv voucher can actually save stake. Sorry.
00:09:26.922 - 00:09:54.760, Speaker A: Part of their saving as well. Again, we in a saving cycle to collateralize our loan. If daisies repay a loan, they will earn a portion of the interest. And so further incentivizing good behavior in terms of lending and borrowing. And so here is the infrastructure. That's what I've always asked within conferences and when I have to talk about Aracastle. What's the infrastructure behind? How do you actually do that? So we have built a protocol that is on Celo.
00:09:54.760 - 00:10:34.530, Speaker A: Not sure how familiar you are with Celo, but it's, they've been very big in emerging market. It's mobile first, and they have been focusing on payment. We have a settlement layer that is literally the flow of funds between the RWA space and micro entrepreneur on the ground here. The innovation is we are leveraging local stablecoin, very important not only for the borrower, but for lender side as well. Because in that case, lenders are able to follow from the moment they send the funds till the person receive the credit. And once they repay for the borrower, it's totally different case scenario as well. Leveraging local stablecoin, totally abstract the technology of the user.
00:10:34.530 - 00:11:07.852, Speaker A: People currently don't know they are dealing with blockchain technology or crypto. And that's something that we really want to push forward. Then the reputation layer, which is literally a crucial piece of stack within our infrastructure that enable us to a better target and ensure repayment. And then application layer, that is just a simple dab that enable people to request credit. But this is what I want to actually show you. It's not the infrastructure that is interesting here. This is what people see.
00:11:07.852 - 00:12:02.256, Speaker A: People don't care about infrastructure again, and especially not users. So when talking about adoption, this is what they need to see, and this is what they need to understand. What can I get from this? What this is going to give me and is it answering a need or not? And so at Araka we have always taken this type of insight, what the value added that the product can give, not the infrastructure. And so yeah, if I have, after working at archaeology, launching this type of product and focus on financial services in emerging markets for the past five years, I think we kind of found like the secret sauce that I call for mass adoption, at least in those markets. Won't talk about Europe or anything. It's we need to build applications that user love and actually feel loved by it. And that comes down to four principles, according to me.
00:12:02.256 - 00:12:44.146, Speaker A: Again, happy to hear all the thoughts, but first is understand your user deeply. I see too many projects, application projects being launched without any user in mind or without having done the user research before. How do you want to drive adoption if you don't have a user archetype? If you are not sure who you're targeting, you cannot build for everyone. So just focus on one users design with empathy. Again, this is very, very important that people feel value when they use your application. They cannot just feel that you have launched this to provide credit and whatever culture practice was not respected, focus on accessibility and usability. I think this is one of them.
00:12:44.146 - 00:13:23.984, Speaker A: The most important aspect we touched based a bit on that at the beginning of the presentation. But again, not everybody has the latest iPhone, not everybody has a 5G network. This is extremely important to understand that if we want to drive adoption and then build trust, this is very proper to emerging markets. I wouldn't talk about Europe or us. This is something that I'm not familiar with. But it's very important to build a sense of trust and transparency within community when you launching a product, because that will be the driver in adoption. And so, yeah, that's it for today.
00:13:23.984 - 00:13:39.420, Speaker A: If I have one hope from this presentation is that I was able to help anybody in building application for emerging market or at least get some interest in targeting those countries. Thank you.
00:13:42.240 - 00:14:26.484, Speaker B: Jessica, I have a question. Obviously you are relying on people that if I'm providing, I don't know who, like, I'm not part of the community and so there is a potential that they might collude or to say like, no, you know, Jessica, she is the best, we trust her, but they are also in agreement and sort of like fleece me for my money. And I was thinking, because like how we do this in crypto, no one needs to trust anyone because you have slashes. So I was thinking, if that's like, how would it work? You know, in your case, so that I cannot, like, there's no incentive.
00:14:26.572 - 00:14:51.760, Speaker A: Yeah, like to call it. That's a very good question. That's one of the biggest, you know, limiting factor to scale at the moment. So we take, we have different phase and different approach. So right now the approach that we've taken is partnering with already existing organization that have already verified those community. There is thousands of organization working with this community. So we know that they are existing, they trust each other, they in close proximity down the line.
00:14:51.760 - 00:15:11.464, Speaker A: We are currently building, you know, this credit model, reputation model that rely on different aspects which should avoid collusion as the system grow because if you call it the other one as well. So that's what we're working on. But yes, that's one of the main blocker, main risk, I would say of the program. Awesome.
00:15:11.512 - 00:15:12.260, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:15:15.320 - 00:15:34.570, Speaker C: Can you explain more, how does the reputation payer verify the credibility of the borrower? So like the borrower is not going to have any unchecked activity. There's not going to be any information about the borrower. But how are you going to break the borrower to give them more loans?
00:15:34.690 - 00:16:10.478, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a good question. So again, we're targeting community, that community group that are already providing finances. So we are bringing all the saving data on chain. So we have those data to create like a base credit score. So this is based on, you know, how frequently you saved, how many times you missed like a payment to your group and so on. So that gives you a base credit score and then the reputation layer is based on who vote for you, the weight of this vouching. So that means, for example, if you vote for me but you missed one payment, did not repay, my reputation goes down as well.
00:16:10.478 - 00:16:15.470, Speaker A: And so this is a set of data that comes together to form like the base credit score.
00:16:15.510 - 00:16:17.414, Speaker C: And that's from the community funds.
00:16:17.542 - 00:16:17.942, Speaker A: Yes.
00:16:18.006 - 00:16:18.454, Speaker C: Itself.
00:16:18.542 - 00:16:31.906, Speaker A: Yes. Community level. Yeah. But they can only vouch part of the community. Yes. So this community are usually run by a community leader. How that works? This community leader, add the people.
00:16:31.906 - 00:16:36.578, Speaker A: And so is the second layer of verification as well in the attestation system.
00:16:36.754 - 00:16:40.562, Speaker C: And how are you guys managing default in this case?
00:16:40.746 - 00:17:25.678, Speaker A: Yes, very good question. So right now we walking through like savings, as I was mentioning, we have like those community who have savings. So we have created this pool where, you know, they can draw down credit but they need to lock their saving to be able to access it is less than what they are getting in terms of capital. But in case of default, we are taking this to recover the loss as a second layer. We worked with a financial institution like foundation that provided a guarantee fund. So people who default could be, I mean the funds could be there in case of the individual. If the person actually defaults, what we are going to do is to try to get back the funds for like a different mean in terms of notification and so on.
00:17:25.678 - 00:17:33.210, Speaker A: And then is the guarantor who like recovered the cost. We take the joint liability of the group. So everyone is responsible for repaying the loan.
00:17:35.430 - 00:18:02.410, Speaker B: And then I had one last question. In terms of the people who are actually vouching for the other person, is there any downside other than a social risk? Do they have to stay? If someone is borrowing $100 that everyone who's sort of vouching for that person has to stay? Dollar two, for some reason that person goes into default or like misses more than six payments that they use their stake as well.
00:18:02.490 - 00:18:19.790, Speaker A: Yes, yes. We really rely on this is, I mean we didn't reinvent the wheel. Right. This is already how it works within the community at you know, traditionally. And so if everyone is taking part of their amount for your friend to get access to a loan, the money is taken away if they default. Yeah.
00:18:22.330 - 00:18:23.282, Speaker B: I have a question.
00:18:23.386 - 00:18:42.382, Speaker C: You just mentioned that this is already a model that is deployed in communities. I mean you're scaling this and digitalizing this model, making it better. Right? Is this like exclusive to african communities or do you guys anticipate any other ways expansion paths?
00:18:42.486 - 00:19:16.390, Speaker A: Yeah, so currently we launched in Kenya. So we're focusing on Kenya main market. We also launching in Ghana in October through the grime in foundation. I'm expecting this model to be able to be replicated in Europe for example. We know a lot of people are doing community finance already but I wouldn't say in the shorter term because you know through the presentation I explain how you need to have real insight into user behavior, culture and so on. So this is model that is scalable but will take time as we go.
