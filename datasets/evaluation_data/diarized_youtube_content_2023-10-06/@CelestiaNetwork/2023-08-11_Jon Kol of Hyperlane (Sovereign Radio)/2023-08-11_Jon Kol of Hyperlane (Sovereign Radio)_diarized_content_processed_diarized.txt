00:00:04.420 - 00:00:08.088, Speaker A: So we've got John here from Hyperlane. Welcome to the show.
00:00:08.174 - 00:00:09.160, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:09.230 - 00:00:17.316, Speaker A: Yeah. So you've been telling me about your background, but let's get it on record. How'd you get into crypto, and how'd you get started with Hyperlane?
00:00:17.508 - 00:00:56.324, Speaker B: Great question. So, as we were just talking about offline, I got into crypto stupidly as a miner, started mining zcash in early 2017. And the thing I found appealing about it is like, well, pretty much all of us had encountered bitcoin for some transactional use case, right? Like, buy something from some dude on Reddit a few years before. Why did we do that? We thought like, oh, this is anonymous currency. And then you started learning more, and you're like, actually, no, this is not anonymous currency. This is the most public thing that's ever fucking existed. Right? This is like, it's there forever, and someone will eventually figure out who it was.
00:00:56.324 - 00:01:31.808, Speaker B: And then, so I'm israeli, and then I hear about this group of israeli professors from a university close to where I grew up, and they have devised a private cryptocurrency, zcash. And Monero exists at the time, but I'm such a noob, I don't know anything about it. And I'm just like, this thing, it's going to go off. It's going to be huge. Who doesn't want private Internet money? So I got to get in on this, and I got to benefit from its rise. But at the time, I'm a bond trader at Morgan Stanley. Difficult family situation.
00:01:31.808 - 00:02:04.236, Speaker B: I can't be too risky with my cash. And mining felt kind of like a crypto bond. It's like, I'm going to buy, I'm going to put my principal down on the equipment, and then I get the returns back. It's kind of like these recurring cash flows, and it's going to be great. It's a low risk way to getting into crypto, and, boy, was that stupid. So now, not a fan of mining, but spent the entire of 2017 just getting more and more and more crypto pills. Was lucky to be in the Bay area, where a bunch of us were, and just like, it was probably the most vibrant crypto ecosystem in the world.
00:02:04.338 - 00:02:16.572, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, I was there. That was the epicenter of crypto at the time because blockstream was there, purse was there. All of the relevant crypto companies, bitcoin companies were there. Lightning labs.
00:02:16.716 - 00:02:21.016, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, the real was like, epicenter is the right word. It was buzzing.
00:02:21.068 - 00:02:40.344, Speaker A: That was where it was happening. I remember the digital garage that Tara Glue is would host the bitcoin meetups and ethereum meetups. And everything was happening there. All of the icos, I mean, not all of them, but, like 90% of the ICO, zero x, everything was there.
00:02:40.542 - 00:02:56.424, Speaker B: And just spent that year being mocked by everyone on my trading desk in Morganstown. Like, you're the crypto guy. You're the crypto guy. You're the crazy guy in suit. Yeah. It was just not a place for me. And by the end of the year, one of our clients was getting into crypto.
00:02:56.424 - 00:03:07.168, Speaker B: They're like, hey, John, there's a group there, and you might just be crazy enough for them. They're opening up a crypto fund. You should really talk to them. And two weeks later, I got started there.
00:03:07.254 - 00:03:08.064, Speaker A: What fund was that?
00:03:08.102 - 00:03:49.320, Speaker B: It's called Passport capital. It's still around. It's called passport. It's been a macro hedge fund for 20 something years. And I was their first hire for the crypto team, and that was, like, my first real break, first legitimate opportunity in crypto, and stayed there for a little while. And then late 2019, joined Galaxy Mike Novograph's firm and then co ran the investment business there for a few years before, in late 2021, the idea for hyperlain started to kind of come together in all this time. So, like I mentioned before, I grew up in Israel, and I got an Internet connection very early within my friend and family group, and only had one other friend than an Internet connection.
00:03:49.320 - 00:04:12.080, Speaker B: And we were on different isps, so not everything worked between us. And then when I learned about blockchains, someone said, hey, these things are not going to be able to talk to each other. I'm like, well, super cool Internet computers. I remember when I first got into my budy, who was on the different ISP, we couldn't really see the same websites all the time. We're on different portals, as they called them back then, but different servers.
00:04:12.160 - 00:04:13.652, Speaker A: Yeah. Within, like, a year and a half.
00:04:13.706 - 00:04:32.424, Speaker B: That got fixed, it felt like this is just going to be a problem that's solved very quickly. And then another year goes by, another year, and it really wasn't happening, especially outside, wasn't really happening for evms, very much right for the Ethereum ecosystem.
00:04:32.552 - 00:04:46.480, Speaker A: Wait, let me stop you there. Why do you think that this was so accelerated? In the web two world and in crypto, it seems to be like, the duration.
00:04:47.300 - 00:05:17.708, Speaker B: That's the best question anyone's ever asked me about this. If I really think about it, I think it's because, and this might not be something that a lot of people like to hear. But I think in the previous world, things were not. No one was religious about isps, right? There was no dogma when it came to ISP. People weren't tied to it. It was very strictly like, these are business operators. And it just made more sense to have a more open web.
00:05:17.708 - 00:05:52.980, Speaker B: And the moment that the business proposition was clear that portals are not it, and you should have just a much more open web, everyone converted. But I think in crypto, because we have these communities and we have assets tied to those communities and people. Beyond just the assets, they put their life into it. So first they put their life energy into something, but then they have an asset that's associated with it. And sometimes that asset, due to its appreciation or whatever, really changes their life. So there is a bond there that probably never existed in the other world. Just cables and servers.
00:05:52.980 - 00:05:56.024, Speaker B: This year it's cables, servers, and an.
00:05:56.142 - 00:06:04.216, Speaker A: Immense emotional identity, culture, even a religion tied to this currency.
00:06:04.328 - 00:06:19.100, Speaker B: Exactly right. Like, no one thinks like, well, AOL. My life is an AOL. No one felt that. But there is someone who's like, I'm an ethereum, and I don't want to leave ethereum leaving Ethereum as saxophone.
00:06:19.260 - 00:06:21.404, Speaker A: I have a Time Warner cable.
00:06:21.532 - 00:06:49.144, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. Think of you as saying that. Now you're saying, I'm, like, hearing it. I'm like, that sounds like a ridiculous thing to say, but no one would blink an eye if you said that in crypto about like, oh, well, I'm an eth, Maxi. Right? Everyone might not like it, but you would be surprised if someone said that. So I think that's it because I think the engineering problems are hard for sure. But I don't think that was it.
00:06:49.144 - 00:06:56.350, Speaker B: I think we had solutions, semi workable solutions and engineering problems as early as, like, 2060, right?
00:06:56.720 - 00:07:16.220, Speaker A: And yeah, similar to that, the closest analog we have to maximalism in the web two world is whether you have an iPhone or an Android. But even that kind of not totally like, okay, whatever, use an Android, I don't care. But here it's like, oh, you're bitcoin, Maxi.
00:07:16.300 - 00:07:16.832, Speaker B: Get out.
00:07:16.886 - 00:07:18.864, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't even want to talk.
00:07:19.062 - 00:07:37.336, Speaker B: So it very much feels like it's kind of like me trying to go to my cousin's house who was very religious person back in Israel and trying to bring something not kosher into the house. He wouldn't let me in. And like, I don't care. You're my cousin. Fuck you. So here's like, whoa, whoa, you're a bitcoin. Like, just.
00:07:37.336 - 00:07:38.020, Speaker B: Yuck.
00:07:38.100 - 00:07:39.704, Speaker A: Just know what you're like.
00:07:39.742 - 00:07:46.248, Speaker B: Yeah. So that's got to be it. But that was such a good question. I've never even thought about that before.
00:07:46.414 - 00:08:09.932, Speaker A: Yeah. Interesting conversation. Yeah. This is one of the first times I've articulated this phenomenon, too, so, yeah, that does make sense why these things are more protracted than other industries. Anyway, going back to hyperlane. Yeah, exactly. Before we even started this podcast, I was like, okay, you're a direct IBC competitor, aren't you? Idol? Why should I be interviewing?
00:08:10.076 - 00:08:20.036, Speaker B: Exactly. Right? Like, it's that same reaction. It's like, wait. It's almost like foreign organisms coming in. And, like, the antibody, they're like, what's this?
00:08:20.138 - 00:08:30.984, Speaker A: Yeah, right. And then you also like to appease me. You're like, well, we're not trying to replace the IBC connections amongst the cosmos apps, but for everything else that doesn't have it.
00:08:31.102 - 00:08:31.770, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:08:32.940 - 00:08:35.592, Speaker A: Meanwhile, it's just a protocol, right?
00:08:35.726 - 00:08:50.256, Speaker B: It's just software. But why do we feel the way that we feel? I've thought about this a lot just in other, like, why do people have these strong bonds? And I think a part of it is for a lot of people, myself included. Maybe it's the same for you. Like, crypto changed my entire life.
00:08:50.358 - 00:08:50.976, Speaker A: Oh, yeah?
00:08:51.078 - 00:09:09.700, Speaker B: I grew up broke. I wouldn't tell you that. We were running out of food, but we didn't really take vacations. Growing up, I was a big nerd, really into video games. I'd have to bust my ass off school. And then once a year, twice a year, they'd buy me a video game. And that was, like, the highlight.
00:09:10.120 - 00:09:11.332, Speaker A: Once a year.
00:09:11.466 - 00:09:12.470, Speaker B: Once. Yeah.
00:09:12.920 - 00:09:18.456, Speaker A: I got my first birthday gift from my parents when I was 15 years in. Yeah.
00:09:18.478 - 00:09:19.064, Speaker B: So there you go.
00:09:19.102 - 00:09:23.610, Speaker A: Yeah. I could beg my mom for the n 64 or maybe like 13 or whatever.
00:09:24.220 - 00:09:55.748, Speaker B: I remember getting it. It was, like, the best. My dad came back from a trip to the US, and he brought it, and it was like, oh, my God. The coolest thing now, really, since the last three, four years, is the first time in life that I'm not living, like, month to month, and it's thanks to crypto. Yeah, right? I was paying for my parents mortgage. I was doing stuff like that and still take care of my mom's house, but now I don't have to worry about that. It's all thanks to this industry that I chose to spend time in.
00:09:55.748 - 00:10:25.548, Speaker B: And so now, I personally might not be very dogmatic about specific ecosystems, but I am dogmatic about crypto. Like, if someone comes in and I go to some dinner and someone's just like, very anticrypto, I get the antibodies immediately. It's like, fuck do you know? So it's that same reaction because it changed our lives and how can we not have an emotional connection to it? So I'm very sympathetic when someone has emotional connection that's specific to one ecosystem. It just all makes sense.
00:10:25.634 - 00:11:09.548, Speaker A: Yeah. The last cycle, it benefited the millennials a lot, in my opinion. A lot of the Gen Z, like the new blood that came in post 2021, a lot of them blew up if they were short term speculative traders, especially if they just listen to all the YouTube podcast youtubers. Right, whatever. So Gen Z money really dried up. So, yeah, what if in the next one we got some boomer money in? Well, the boomers have all of everyone who is living. They have more than 4% of the wealth of everyone who is alive today.
00:11:09.548 - 00:11:12.472, Speaker A: So once that money gets into crypto.
00:11:12.536 - 00:11:29.940, Speaker B: Hey, if some of it can come in, and then that could create a more generational distribution, I'm all for it. Because like you said, I think anyone who's paying attention has seen those graphs where it's like wealth accumulation by generation, and it's like silence. Boomers, Gen X, millennials.
00:11:30.920 - 00:11:31.428, Speaker A: Huge.
00:11:31.514 - 00:11:38.384, Speaker B: Yeah. It's quite a chunk, right? They've lived through basically like the largest wealth accumulation period in history, especially if they were Americans.
00:11:38.432 - 00:11:42.304, Speaker A: Yeah, they're rich because they lived in that era.
00:11:42.352 - 00:11:42.950, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:11:43.320 - 00:11:47.656, Speaker A: If you even had some savings as a boomer, you're probably relatively well off.
00:11:47.678 - 00:11:59.868, Speaker B: Yeah. All you even had to do is just like buy a house in a semi metropolitan area and everyone knows someone who's like, oh, yeah, we bought that house in 1973 and it was $27, like 1000.
00:11:59.954 - 00:12:00.696, Speaker A: Next. Whoa.
00:12:00.728 - 00:12:01.228, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.
00:12:01.314 - 00:12:01.948, Speaker A: That happened.
00:12:02.034 - 00:12:07.804, Speaker B: And so you ever seen those memes where it's like, oh, my parents at 30 and they have the house, me.
00:12:07.842 - 00:12:10.860, Speaker A: At 30, and I'm like, living in a one apartment.
00:12:10.940 - 00:12:17.776, Speaker B: Yeah. Living in a closet of an apartment, betting on speculating on like, a hamster acquisition, like people were doing the other day.
00:12:17.878 - 00:12:37.768, Speaker A: Yeah. So now if you're trying to thrive in that world in a nine to five, you really aren't going to. And if you make an asymmetric bet in something like crypto, you're making make it place like Charlote Fang says from a lady, then you're going to make it.
00:12:37.854 - 00:13:04.140, Speaker B: Yeah. I think that's part of why the anger generation found this so appealing, because it's like, well, I need these asymmetric bets, because things outside don't feel like they're going in my favor. I think, as a movement, crypto is very subversive. And I think it's a lot of us who are kind of railing against this. Like, I used to work at a bank. I've hated the bank since I've been a fucking teenager, because I've been fucked by banks in multiple countries. I've been fucked by the banks in Israel.
00:13:04.140 - 00:13:19.812, Speaker B: Then I come to the US, and I really like the banks here. They treat me nice. And then I'm a Wells Fargo client in the LA area. So if you remember that scandal, I'm one of those accounts. They stole $900 from me, and they had to pay a fine. But guess who's running the saddest part. Guess who still has the wells Fargo account? Me.
00:13:19.812 - 00:13:39.548, Speaker B: Because it's so hard to get away from your bank account. And so when I came across crypto years ago, it's like, wait a second. We can build, like, a new financial substrate. Sign me up. Can we fuck the banks with this thing? I'm all in. There's no other thing in the world I want to work for, no other industry. How do I get into this thing?
00:13:39.634 - 00:13:40.172, Speaker A: Right?
00:13:40.306 - 00:14:20.516, Speaker B: And going back to the hyperlink right now, a couple of years ago, it felt like for the crypto economy to really expand, to kind of take that next step. The cosmos thesis was always the right one. Instead of, like, one big, massive computer, we're going to have a whole lot of small ones. And so if that's happening, how are we connecting them? And it was clear by 2021 that it was not going to be a single environment or a single ecosystem. So how do you create that connective tissue? And that's when we got together and sat with credible folks like Zucky and Nam and ASA are my co founders, and came with what is now hyperlink.
00:14:20.628 - 00:14:38.988, Speaker A: Okay, well, excellent. So, you know, we're going to close up real quickly. So the last one. The last question would be, okay, you are an IBC competitor. However, you are addressing interoperability similarly to layer zero in the EVM ecosystem.
00:14:39.084 - 00:15:02.804, Speaker B: That's right. Yeah. And the key insight with hyperlane is the same key principle of IBC. Why is IBC so unique? Because it's permissionless. Because anyone can connect it to any chain that's suitable. And that suitable part is, like, the main restriction, really the reason why we even felt compelled to make hyperlink. If IBC was easily extensible to any environment, we just go from that.
00:15:02.804 - 00:16:00.772, Speaker B: But we wanted to create something that has that same permissionless aspect, anyone can use it to connect any chain and again, be very extensible. So the any chain part was very important. And so whereas things like layer zero and others let you just, they have to deploy to your chain, they are kind of the arbiters of which chains get to talk to each other. Hyperlain brings that same concept from the spirit of IBC, of just, you should be able to decide that you should be able to bring it to your chain, because again, if we're going to see, and this is what I firmly believe, we're just going to see an explosion of these chains, the number is going to be gargantua, but it's going to be a lot of smaller chains. Again, less generalized and much more specific. And in that world, you need to be able to do it yourself, and you need to be able to have that sovereign connection. And so that's really what we're going after, and that's why we want to be able to support as many environments and let people connect between those environments.
00:16:00.772 - 00:16:33.728, Speaker B: So you spin up your app chain tomorrow, great. Like, you can put hyperlane on that app chain, the Cosmwaza module, the cosmic decay module, those will be done basically by the end of summer. Run those, and now you can connect with anywhere else where hyperlane is at. So the focus is certainly to go between environments and help people do that permissionlessly. So people could use it between cosmos chains. I don't know why they would when they have IBC, but I guess they could. But yeah, that's the spirit of what we're doing.
00:16:33.814 - 00:17:01.352, Speaker A: Okay, and we're going to have to bring you back on to interchange FM later on for a full interview, where we break all of that down to understand the technical idiosyncrasy between all of these different transport layers. This is just like a little teether. So you get the 20,000 foot view idea about what hyperlain is, and we'll see you next time. Thank you for coming on.
00:17:01.406 - 00:17:04.100, Speaker B: Thank you for having me. This is great. Bye.
