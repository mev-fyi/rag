00:00:00.330 - 00:01:11.730, Speaker A: Now, having listed all of the main components of a modular blockchain stack, like how do we define what a modular blockchain is? So I define a modular blockchain as a blockchain that outsources fully at least one of the four components I e. It does not handle that component. So, for example, like Solana, wouldn't a modular blockchain if you just added roll ups to Salana? Because Salana's l one still has a smart contract environment and its validators are doing data availability, consensus and execution and they're not specialized in a specific task and therefore it's not modular. So what is not a modular blockchain? So there's often some confusion on this. A blockchain that handles all the components but has a modular software design is not a modular blockchain. A modular software design can be helpful to build modular blockchains like we use Tendermint. The ABCI construction in Tendermint is very helpful to build modular blockchains.
00:01:11.730 - 00:01:41.290, Speaker A: But deploying a blockchain using this modular software library does not make that blockchain modular in itself. And secondly, a network of blockchains where each blockchain in the network handles all the components is also not a modular blockchain. For example, avalanche subnets are not modular blockchains because each chain in that subnet in the network handles all the components that I just described. Therefore, it's not modular.
