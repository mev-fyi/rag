00:00:01.520 - 00:00:28.495, Speaker A: All right, welcome everyone to celestia Core devs call 19 today I think will be a pretty quick one as we mostly need to discuss the V3 upgrade. Before we get to that, I like to just get a quick update from the ZK working group from column if you're available. Yeah, Yep.
00:00:29.635 - 00:01:19.425, Speaker B: Yeah, so we had a group call last week and then we've been sort of like working on it throughout the last couple of weeks. The the kind of like short term goal is to get a end to end test working with a ZKEVM. So that's using SP1 below like RSP repo and then have that with Celestia. And so we're working on this at the moment. So there's a bunch of us from different teams. The idea is to try to get this done by the end of the year and then as to like a mainnet ready production, it kind of is dependent on the release of IPC Eureka, which would be at the end of Q1. So we expect it to be out of mainnet sometime later, maybe April, May.
00:01:19.425 - 00:01:22.225, Speaker B: That's everything.
00:01:23.005 - 00:02:03.703, Speaker A: Cool, thank you. Does anyone have questions about that? I don't think so. Cool. I want to do a just quick check in case the DA working group or interface working group have updates. I don't think so. I'll take that as a no. And for updates on cips, I don't believe there's anything that needs a review right now or anything.
00:02:03.703 - 00:03:15.099, Speaker A: Everything for Ginger v3 upgrade is in final status and Arabica was successfully upgraded yesterday, so we're now seeing 5 second, a little bit under 5 seconds even blocks on Arabica, which is sweet. And with the V3 upgrade there's also the potential to upgrade to eight megabyte blocks through governance. So I guess on that note, I know some of the context here. Mocha is going to be upgraded soon. I think the release is already out for both DA nodes and consensus nodes and we'll be making an upgrade announcement tomorrow I believe about that. I'm curious for anyone, I think Evan or Column might know specifically what dates are planned for those upgrades for Mocha or for the upgrade for Mocha. And then if we're still looking at December 4th I think for Mainnet, ideally.
00:03:15.267 - 00:03:55.865, Speaker C: The announcement for the Mocha upgrade starts tomorrow morning and then we will ask validators on the Mocha network to send their signal transactions and do the migration for the V02 0.0 for node, celestial Node and then as far as December goes, everything else is still on track for upgrading mainnet. I think. Actually, I take that back. Wasn't mainnet pushed back a week? Let me check my document really quick. I think mainnet was pushback a week.
00:03:57.205 - 00:04:01.945, Speaker A: I can just go ahead and upgrade this agenda afterwards.
00:04:02.325 - 00:04:03.105, Speaker C: Okay.
00:04:03.885 - 00:04:05.629, Speaker A: Yeah, I think I'll let you continue.
00:04:05.677 - 00:04:09.145, Speaker C: I think mainnet was pushed back a week, if I recall correctly.
00:04:09.885 - 00:04:11.469, Speaker A: Is that the 11th then?
00:04:11.637 - 00:04:15.373, Speaker C: Yeah, week of the 11th, that's when the app version actually changes.
00:04:15.549 - 00:04:26.095, Speaker A: Yeah. And then from there there will be a week, I guess after 5, 6 have upgraded and signaled that.
00:04:28.715 - 00:04:44.975, Speaker C: No, no, the. The week of the. The week before is when they upgraded signal. You might have said that. Sorry, I might have misheard. And then the week of the 11th will be the time when the date when the app version actually changes and when the blocks decrease in time.
00:04:45.355 - 00:05:08.351, Speaker A: Okay, that makes sense. Cool. So I guess mocha. Yeah. For context there, if everyone upgrades tomorrow, the actual upgrade should happen. I mean, I guess around a week from then, but it depends on how quickly everyone upgrades.
00:05:08.543 - 00:05:09.715, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly.
00:05:12.185 - 00:05:33.365, Speaker A: I don't have anything else. Yeah, thank you, Evan. I don't have anything else on my end in terms of updates. I guess I can just do a quick check here. Yeah, I think this is all old or so whip. So I'd like to thank everyone for coming today. I know this was really quick.
00:05:33.365 - 00:06:03.487, Speaker A: I guess before I do that, does anyone have anything else to add? Cool. Congratulations on the Arabica upgrade and good luck everyone with the mocha upgrade and we'll see you in the next core devs call. I think sometime at the end of November. Thanks, Josh. Bye, everyone. Thanks, Josh. Bye.
00:06:03.487 - 00:06:04.083, Speaker A: Bye.
00:06:04.239 - 00:06:06.835, Speaker B: Thanks, Josh. Bye.
