00:00:03.400 - 00:00:26.314, Speaker A: Welcome everyone to another demo day for the infinite space bazaar. My name is Josh from celestial Labs and I'll be hosting you along with brian from dora hacks. Brian, thank you again for coming. My pleasure. Demo day was a blast, so I had to come back for the second day in a row. Yeah. And on that note, we have a pretty full schedule today, so we're going to go ahead and get started.
00:00:26.314 - 00:00:48.514, Speaker A: The first track we're going to do today is the community track, and then after that we'll do build whatever. The first project we have up is Block bazaar. So we're inviting sammy to present on Block Bazaar. Hello. Hello everyone. It's great to be here. Great to have you.
00:00:48.514 - 00:01:38.484, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah. My name is Sami and I am part of Cumulo team and we participating in Isbe representing the Lumtree house with blog Pasar, also in Cumulo. We are validators at celestia and community builders. That is the reason we know firsthand both needs of our community to acquire knowledge and the challenge Celestia faces in communicating very technical concepts. After this weeks of participating in the hackathon, we realized how valuable the workshops were and we wanted to make sure that this content was not lost. So we came up with a fun way to reintroduce the whole community to see the workshops to learn and connect with the project.
00:01:38.484 - 00:02:56.318, Speaker A: Yeah, essentially, Blogbazaar is a series of interactive comics that we will publish weekly. Each episode is an adaption of the hackathon workshops, transforming transforming the key ideas, explain it in them into futuristic fantastic fantasy narrative. In addition to the comics, we will launch a dedicated website where you can find all the episodes and we have also developing an interactive dashboard that will showcase projects that use the LST as that ability layer. We have observed in Celestia community a growing curiosity and need to assess specific information about these projects that are in some way related to Celestia. The official ecosystem is useful, but perhaps does not provide such a deep insight. So we collect all data to create an up to date registry. This is accessible to all and this log will be available through our interactive dashboard and has some file on GitHub.
00:02:56.318 - 00:03:52.404, Speaker A: To increase the community participation and engagement, we will implement weekly reference of PIA tokens among participants with comments or unpublished episodes. And in short, we want to create a function fun and engage me in a space where everyone can interact and grow in its knowledge. And thank you and we hope you enjoy the blog bazaar as much as we enjoy creating it. Thank you Sammy. I've already had some fun checking it out, so I hope everyone else does, too. And I guess it looks like there's an episode four in the works, so that's exciting. We plan make episodes for not every every workshops.
00:03:52.404 - 00:04:22.334, Speaker A: Maybe we will mix some workshops in one episode. Yeah, we will plan cover all the workshops. Yeah. The only question for you from the chat is when, Mustafa? Modularity arc. Ah. So I guess to keep the engagement, we need to. To keep the engagement of the community, we need to leave it for the final.
00:04:22.334 - 00:04:51.228, Speaker A: True. Yeah, you need to wait. Yeah, yeah. I think this is the hard one or the hardest one to cover. Yeah, it makes sense. Thank you again, sammy. Up next, we have the modular alpha whore model, and I'm excited to invite Brian to present.
00:04:51.228 - 00:05:06.344, Speaker A: Thank you. I'm sharing presentation now. Cool. So, Brian, whenever you're ready, you can get started. Perfect. Thank you for the space. I'm Brian from the alpajor model team from Argentina.
00:05:06.344 - 00:05:52.084, Speaker A: So in Argentina, the alphajor is a traditional suite that we love. In fact, we love it so much that we have a community crypto community called Alphajor Cito dao, where we have this cute little mascot. So we are using the alpha hor to reflect an analogy of the architecture of a modular blockchain. An alpha horror is just made up of two cookies with a dual selection filling. Might have heard this before. It also has topping, or that's usually chocolate. So to get started, the execution layer, it's the first part where a user will make the first interaction, and it's where the transactions get executed.
00:05:52.084 - 00:06:33.924, Speaker A: So this is the outer coding of the alpha horror. And it covers the entire alcohol, same as it covers the entire blockchain. Then the data availability layer makes sure that the information is available for the settlement layer to validate the transactions. This last one is the Dulce Leche, because it's that sweet moment when everything is validated. Right. But to finalize, the consensus layer is the base cookie, because it's where everyone agrees that the state of the blockchain is correct. And this is what holds up the integrity of the entire network, same as it holds up the entire alcohol.
00:06:33.924 - 00:07:20.334, Speaker A: Through this alpha core analogy, we can vividly explain the modular architecture, highlighting its brilliance, just as we do with our beloved alpha core in Argentina. Thank you very much. Thank you, Brian. I do not have any questions in the chat. I'm curious to know kind of what your roadmap looks like, what you're looking to do with the project in the future. Yeah. This is the first part of a series of infographics that we are starting with our company called Neo Power and a design company.
00:07:20.334 - 00:08:04.754, Speaker A: So we are excited to start explaining technical terms with analogies that we all love, such as tools LH and Alpha core. So I see some excitement for that. This usually helps on board technical people to concepts that they don't fully understand. And it happened to us in our local community in Argentina that we use this concept to explain this and this allows us to onboard builders. I'm a software engineer and same as many people here and this is great to onboard people. So we'll keep doing more of these infographics with the rest of the team. Yeah.
00:08:04.754 - 00:08:27.026, Speaker A: Thank you again, Brian. Next up we have Celestia club and I'm excited to welcome Vikash to present on Jclub. Yeah, I'm audible. There we go. Yep. I can hear you. Yeah.
00:08:27.026 - 00:08:56.062, Speaker A: So whenever you're ready. Yeah. So hey everyone, this is Celestia club. So basically it's DAP, which is based on the Dao, right? So it's a decentralized investment and treasury management as well, right. So basically there are various problem in which we are handling this by building, you know, this project. So first problem is, you know, centralized investment, right. For example, we have various, you know, a community or any type of the company which gives funds for the project, right.
00:08:56.062 - 00:09:15.440, Speaker A: And they are complete, you know, centralized, right. And there is much involvement of the politics as well, right. Means some user get the chance to vis the project. Some user can't get that chance to project, right. And the base project. Right. They usually didn't get noticed by the investment and all that, right.
00:09:15.440 - 00:09:42.858, Speaker A: So basically if I talk about the solution, so basically I just created means during the hackathon, I think about the idea, right. For, you know, that we can create a dao, right. For to solve this problem, right. Every member get a chance to showcase their project and items, right. And if I talk about the working flow, then anyone can create the investment, right. Uh, after creating the investment clubs, right, the user have the, you know, options to join or leave the clubs, right. They can create and vote on the proposal.
00:09:42.858 - 00:10:12.078, Speaker A: Voting part is important. That's why it's, uh, on the top of the dow, right. And after that, when a proposal, there is a time voting as well, right. Means, uh, if, you know, five minutes, the user or all the member have the chance to vote on that proposal, right. And after that the owner can cancel or execute that proposal, right. So if I talk about the, what next? So we are trying to deploy on the mainnet and we are trying to implement the, you know, some like chat options, right. For the.
00:10:12.078 - 00:10:39.116, Speaker A: Between participants and the organizer. Right. So if I talk about the demo. So this is the, you know, on the front page or the landing page of this last year cloud right here, I can see the clubs, right? So basically if I talk about this club, right, which I created, which is testing, right? So under testing I have the options to leave the club. I can, you know, contribute to the club. Right. I can create the proposal.
00:10:39.116 - 00:10:53.380, Speaker A: Right. This is the proposal page. Right. After getting proposal, we are going to see this. This proposal is being executed, right by the owner. Right. Then after the proposal I can see all the description, the creator, the who created and the destination.
00:10:53.380 - 00:11:04.024, Speaker A: Right. And the amount and the CID. CID is basically. Is the, you know, unique identity which is all these are being stored on the lighthouse. So. And the voting deadline as well. Right.
00:11:04.024 - 00:11:23.380, Speaker A: So after, you know, the voting deadline, the user have the option to, you know, execute or cancel the proposal. Right. The execution part is only done when the vote for is more than the against. Right. If it less, then the user can't execute. He or she can only cancel the proposal. Right.
00:11:23.380 - 00:12:00.218, Speaker A: So yeah, so this is quite, you know, our Celestia club, right. And. Yep. Thank you. Thank you for presenting. What are your plans for the project? So basically I thought to, you know, implement some chat option like between the participant and the organizer so that the one who, you know, the one who are voting on that project can ask some questions like whatever the funding they required and all that. And we are trying to deploy on the main.
00:12:00.218 - 00:12:21.314, Speaker A: Right. So basically I deployed this on the conduit roll up as well. So kind of focus on the roll upside as well. Awesome. I'm looking forward to seeing it. Thank you again for presenting. Next up we have the mascots of the infinite space bizarre houses and I would like to welcome Swarna to present.
00:12:22.494 - 00:12:35.446, Speaker B: Hello, I'm Swarna Nagwani. I'm a digital artist. Uiu Sutana. Also gamedev. I have done some mascots for all the houses. So I'll begin with the house whimsy fall. For whimsy fall.
00:12:35.446 - 00:13:06.958, Speaker B: I had a theme of like some fun while creating new things. Like it's kind of thing magic. That's what we say now to make things possible which are. Which we think that are not at all possible. That's why I created a mascot for in which the funny uncle has a magic wand and the values I took for it was joy, creativity and adaptability. Symbolism. Playfulness desire to experiment in web3.
00:13:06.958 - 00:13:33.862, Speaker B: Believe in humor and fun and innovation. Viewing challenges as opportunities for creative solutions. Then it house mindful. So for it mindfulness, house. We know it's a mystic. Like we have so many intelligent people around us. They are the one who thinks like they can find anything.
00:13:33.862 - 00:14:18.338, Speaker B: They are the thinkers and innovators who thinks they can achieve endless possibilities. So for mask, I took an owl. Owl sorry. For which eyes and the cosmic elements behind it shows the endless possibilities. So for its values, I choose wisdom, insight, exploration of the unknown, symbolism, intense gaze and cosmic elements, fascination with mysteries and endless possibilities. So the next is our house lemon tree, from which I am so for it, I know the lemon trees are the most creative ones out there. Like, we want everything to be creative.
00:14:18.338 - 00:14:59.036, Speaker B: We believe if things are beautiful, we believe if things are interesting, then the world's gonna be so easy. So for it, I took a brush. As I'm a digital artist, I like art. And its colorful wings show the vibrance of the web3 world and symbol for its values. I took, I used it as creativity and transformation, symbolism, color feathers, colorful feathers and artistic elements. Fashion, drive and resilience, viewing set beds and opportunities for growth. And for last, we have a house.
00:14:59.036 - 00:15:44.664, Speaker B: Puddle trail. Puddle trail is the most sweet house. I guess for sweetness, I use the mascot to be a otter. And the house Buddha tree uses innocence and simplicity to think about. To think that the innocence and the nature can bring the world to peace and we can go on a really long way with that. So for that symbolism, I use joyful expressions on our auto and natural select surrounding optimism and purity of heart, serine water and lush grape. So that was it for today's presentation.
00:15:44.664 - 00:15:45.644, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:15:46.984 - 00:16:01.204, Speaker A: Thank you so much, Sarna. There's no questions in the chat. I'm curious what your next evolution, I guess, of these mascots would be. What do you want to do next?
00:16:02.334 - 00:16:05.954, Speaker B: I want to create them as 3d assets and nfts.
00:16:06.374 - 00:16:06.974, Speaker A: Oh, awesome.
00:16:07.014 - 00:16:09.554, Speaker B: And like, and then want to add them in my game.
00:16:12.134 - 00:16:59.594, Speaker A: I'm looking forward to seeing more. That's, that's exciting. Thank you again, swarna, for presenting and looking forward to seeing more of your work. Next up, we have Celestia GPT and I'd like to welcome Asharib to present. Whenever you're ready. The floor is yours, except you're muted still. Hey, Ashrae, you're muted.
00:16:59.594 - 00:17:32.913, Speaker A: Yeah, so sorry, I was presenting. Sorry. Yeah, you're good to go. All right, so are you hearing me now? Yep, we got you clear. Are you hearing me now? Yeah, we can hear you. I think you might not be able to hear me though. All right, so it's hello guys, so sorry for inconvenience.
00:17:32.913 - 00:18:18.486, Speaker A: I'm Shari Bali and this is my project, Celestia GPT. I am from Pakistan. I have over three years of experience in the development side and so Celestia GPT, it's an cutting edge virtual assistant developed for the celestial community and developers. It provides rapid, accurate answers and deep insights, and it facilitates better understanding of the celestial platform and its developers. And mainly it's designed for developers to build on Celestia in a conversational way. So this is the problem statement, basically. Celestia community members, especially developers, struggle with accessing and understanding the detailed project information, and community may want updates on the TR token and its easy ecosystem and all of the things related to it.
00:18:18.486 - 00:19:22.784, Speaker A: And the improved resources are needed to support developers using celestial infrastructure. And if they use chat, chat GPT plus it cost $20 without any knowledge about we lost your audio, but I don't think you can hear us. So. So I have some of the benefits that may provide by sales GPT and this is the tech stack mainly. Everything is powered by the open AI's assistant APIs and behind the scene. I have been using a flow wise AI for visual nodes, workflow development and. Yeah, so future implement future improvements would be the expanded knowledge base and community analytics.
00:19:22.784 - 00:20:10.600, Speaker A: Thank you. You can try it out here without login and sign up stuff and without any fees. You may ask any type of questions like I'll simply ask what is Celestia modular blockchain network? And it will promptly answer answer me about the project. So I may write something technical like some coding stuff, and for sure it will answer me about that as well. So that's my project and if anybody have any questions, then they can ask me. Thank you. Ashweeb, can you hear us? Yes, sir, I'm hearing you.
00:20:10.600 - 00:20:57.228, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay, cool, cool. I don't have any questions from the chat. I'm curious to see what your next plans are. What's your roadmap look like? For this project, mainly I'll try to add more quality data to get the best results from the GPT that I have trained on. And for community, I may add something like they can do technical analysis on chain analysis and fundamental analysis within the interface about the tier token and all of the things related to the ecosystem and the projects that are building on the top of it. Looking forward to seeing more and our time's up, so we're going to have to get to the next project.
00:20:57.228 - 00:21:13.244, Speaker A: Thank you again, Ashreeb. Next we have how dare you. And I'm excited to welcome Nicholas up to the stage. Hey. Hey. When you're ready, you can go ahead and get started. Yeah, so, yeah.
00:21:13.244 - 00:21:49.504, Speaker A: And so I will start the job. And so what is. How dare you? How dare you? Is a project to assess and compensate Celestia's carbon footprint by using the community pool. So, first of all, what is the GHG protocol? A GHG protocol is the methodology used to calculate. Sorry. A carbon footprint is divided between three scopes in which you have quantities of CO2 emitted by, let's say, silicia, in our case. So scop one is about direct emissions.
00:21:49.504 - 00:22:22.544, Speaker A: So it's about factories and everything. So it doesn't matter regarding Celestia. Scop two is about the use of electricity and energy, so it's important regarding Silesia. And scop three is about indirect emissions. So it's more complicated to calculate, and some companies do it, don't do it. But in scop three, you would have the building of the hardware, for instance. So what I did is I did the scope two regarding celestia.
00:22:22.544 - 00:23:06.424, Speaker A: So why does it matter? Because we need to save our beloved pale blue dots. I think that a community pool should be used to finance public goods. And planet Earth is a public good. It's a good way to engage our community chains like Solana do it, for instance. And it's about adding a new KPI to Silistia because, well, it's like data throughput, for instance. And we'll see that light nodes are important because they divide Cilicia's carbon footprint by four. That's a fact, I would say.
00:23:06.424 - 00:24:07.586, Speaker A: And so we can see the total carbon footprint of Silesia is around 800 tons. And to give you an idea, it's like the same emissions as 80 us citizens. To give you an idea. And I would say that regarding the consensus part of Silicia, it's like a classical cosmos chain. So it's really by using the light notes that you see that there's a difference because gas enables you to have light node with strong security assumption, and so they consume less energy, but you have something not that different from using a full node. Next steps are having a better vision of the validator set. So maybe use a more recent snapshot, having a better crawler to see the DA nodes with more details.
00:24:07.586 - 00:25:21.170, Speaker A: Develop a Kapi because chains use CO2 per transaction. But it doesn't really make sense regarding Celestia and integrates scope three elements like the building of hardware. And so about the compensation, we can have a step by step approach, talk about it on the forum and compensate the validators and bridges first to have something qualitative to compensate, to define a better budget and finance a project like a regeneration of a mangrove forest, for instance, and the foundation would use the tokens to pay for it. And so, yeah, see you on Silicia forum and thank you for listening to me. Thank you, Nicholas. What was the most difficult part of building that project? It was about hypothesis, because as I said, we don't have a crawler for da nodes. And so, well, I had the mapping of all the full nodes.
00:25:21.170 - 00:26:03.618, Speaker A: So I said, okay, so if I have three full nodes in one country, that's a validator. And so I said okay, so if I have a validator, I have a bridge node. I say okay, let's say that we have the same amount of bridge nodes, validators, and so we have until the rest are light node, for instance. Well, and that's the hardest part, to have something that is not true. But you say okay, it's not that different from reality. Thank you for sharing more. I look forward to seeing the chatter about this on the forum.
00:26:03.618 - 00:26:40.474, Speaker A: I think there's also a few other teams that are working on similar things in the sense that they're network crawlers to kind of give you an overview of what the network actually looks like. So yeah, thank you again for sharing and thanks for having me more. Yeah, you're welcome. Next up we have Tsukiyomi. This is actually a project from the core track, but just due to timing it made more sense to present today. Zaref, welcome and thank you for sharing. There we go.
00:26:40.474 - 00:27:35.254, Speaker A: I see your screen now. Hello, my name is. I'm the core developer behind Tsukuyomi. So Tsukuyumi is sequencer roller for verify credential. So we have three main problem here because we have a cellular signature like we say album optimism and many other products. Second, we have minor extractable value problem. And the second 3rd problem is fragmented cross chain credibility.
00:27:35.254 - 00:28:22.912, Speaker A: So how secure you may cancel it. First we are sequencer rollup, we have fast block. Finally, as you can see here, only 2.5 seconds we can produce new block. And second, we have. Second we have public timestamp. So what does that mean? It amid a technical matter we use execution API from Austria that we can live by our topic timestamp for our run up.
00:28:22.912 - 00:29:43.814, Speaker A: This means we can set, we can have atomic settlement. So you can avoid minor, more minor extractable problem. So, and we have some that later compression because as we have absolutely grilles or Corolla we have the K identity tool like world adding. We handle the request for cross roll up using hyperlink and we will label reputation using our summer and we can monitoring other roll ups. First we observe the transaction from any other run of dash law on Aptria. We observe and we attach letters and we provide SDK to load URL that has the same Malo timestamp execution and we retreat to Qomi Malog data from selectia and check filter. And after all we use execution API to modify the conductor.
00:29:43.814 - 00:30:28.650, Speaker A: Okay, so we can drop a block it. Thank you. Thank you Zarath. There we go. Next up we have aggro token and I'd like to welcome Arthur to present. Hey Arthur, how's it going? I'm fine. How are you guys? And your slides? There you go.
00:30:28.650 - 00:30:53.824, Speaker A: Oh, nice. We're ready when you are. Thank you. Hey everyone, I'm Arthur from Padau trial trailhouse and this is my project agro token. It's a platform where farmers can tokenize their crops and livestock to attract investments. It's also a platform where free users can invest in yield bearing real world assets. So how it works.
00:30:53.824 - 00:31:56.804, Speaker A: For example, you are a farmer who raises a cattle and you want to expand your farm. For this you decided to attract investment using web3 opportunities and this application. First, you need to log in using your wallet or web two accounts. After that, go to your farm page and create token that will be linked to one of your calves defined category, a description of your product and for a calf identifier so that investor always knows exactly what asset they invested, the chain and address of the token you want to accept the amount of required investments, the number of tokens you expect to return and expected period for this. Okay. And once your token is created, any web free user will be able to open the app, go to the export page, find your offer and invest in your token. At this point, the farmer gets the money he needs and the user becomes investor of real world asset.
00:31:56.804 - 00:32:40.850, Speaker A: Next, you as a farmer do your job. You raise your livestock, weigh it regularly and make records of it. This way investor will see how the process is going and how much their assets is currently worth. And after some time, when your cattle are ready, you can sell them on the real market and return received investment. That's it. To build this project, I used Zillat and conduit as providers for launching and operating rops, Ethereum and mode networks as settlement layer and celestial data layer for all robs. And of course there are many ideas on how to improve this project.
00:32:40.850 - 00:33:31.196, Speaker A: It would be great to launch tests with real farms, integrate Oracle to display up to date prices of real world assets, and implement features of reputation and insurance. Thanks for your attention and let's make angular revolution together. Thank you. Arthur, I know you mentioned the things that you'd like to add, but what are the next plans that you have for this project? The biggest challenge for us is to find farmers who will agree to participate in this idea and this project. So for us, it's the next step for project. Yeah. So good luck and I look forward to seeing what you grow, not build, I guess.
00:33:31.196 - 00:33:46.580, Speaker A: Thank you. Thank you. You're welcome. Next up we have Garang and meme feed an alarm. Oh no, I skipped. Sorry, junk's up. We're doing first.
00:33:46.580 - 00:34:01.586, Speaker A: Yeah. And Jeremy. And could you say can you our screen. Can you see our screen? Yeah, I can hear you and your screen is now up. We got the whole screen shared. I will start. Hello, I'm Jiang Si from NFT import team.
00:34:01.586 - 00:34:35.990, Speaker A: Our project is about celestial DA based CDN service and we called NFT info. If you ever try to use ZDA for storing data, you would understand what we said. Currently, for storing data in a decentralized way, people mostly use ipfs. In this point, there are two problems we solved like that. And then using select a instead of ipfs, it will be a solution for users and builders. Users and builders. Right.
00:34:35.990 - 00:36:16.618, Speaker A: It's time to show our demo service digital service. You can see three pages collection create and point actually and then I will create a new collection NFD NFT by our using by our NFT info service new collection something simple to choose the NFT PI this images will be upload to select the DA click this button and after uploaded this data, you can see I generated some of metadata JSON and then clicking uploading metadata again. Finally you can see generated basic Uri. Actually we don't have enough time so I already prepared prepared this demo day NfT collection and actually I already deployed it just demo day this NfT collection by using our service and then this opensea button you can see this NfT collection this image and metadata actually already uploaded the celestia da as a blob. You can see okay this NFT and then actually I already deployed Celestia ga collections. It's very cute fragrance. And also you can see demo day this NFT collection, let's say here is by using the selenium service.
00:36:16.618 - 00:37:14.766, Speaker A: Okay. You can see the image URL is here and then I will assess to the image by our services and then also you can see this metadata or so like that. Finally, our service is also provide this swagger for users and builders. And then if in the future for our service, this is a point service, there is a point service for promotion to new builders and users and user aware builder mint or deploy our NFT. NFT or something data. And by using our service they will receive something token and collect something some changed by hyper rain bridge. That's all.
00:37:14.766 - 00:37:51.904, Speaker A: Thank you for listening. Thank you, Jungkook. Okay, I stopped my shit screen. It's okay. That's awesome. What was the most difficult thing about building your project? Actually in the select a is something encoded by Protobub. So is to encode the anticode by select the from the blob data to humanoid data to upper users or builders.
00:37:51.904 - 00:38:28.384, Speaker A: Makes sense. And also there is something because actually we use the NFT service. This part is one of ls of that namespace. But actually it's too hard to search in the selenium. Actually this is only alias again. And then we can, we cannot explore our name services collections by this alias. So it's.
00:38:28.384 - 00:38:52.744, Speaker A: Yeah, I feel like there's a long way to go to like standardizing all the different. Yeah, this and that. Different encoding schemes and stuff. Yeah, um, that. Awesome. Thank you for your presentation. Um, yeah, and now I'm actually welcoming Garun with meme feed, uh, to the stage.
00:38:52.744 - 00:39:16.698, Speaker A: And garn, whenever you're ready, you can go ahead and get started. Uh, unmute though. Thanks. Yeah. Hi, everyone. My name is Karong and I worked on memefeed, a software and app chain that enables live memes for any community. All right, so let's just hop straight into the demo.
00:39:16.698 - 00:39:42.310, Speaker A: You would, a user would connect their wallet, which is ethereum for now. This wallet address that I'm connecting to already has a user record. Oh, wow. Demo day. Okay, well, that's strange, but then that's why I have the video prepared. That was strange. So user reconnected wallet, which is ethereum for now.
00:39:42.310 - 00:40:10.754, Speaker A: This wallet address already has a user record. This one will create the user transaction. User creation transaction right now. And then the room name will be Lumen tree. The password is rise from the ashes. Yeah, there you go. Once a user logs in, an authentication token is granted to the client for session.
00:40:10.754 - 00:40:34.908, Speaker A: The user can see popular memes today, weekly, monthly, and they can also view live stream of memes. So if I just skip forward. So yeah, you can see that's where the live stream will be. And then you can post. And then I end up posting in this video. Unfortunate that the live one didn't work. That's so on that part.
00:40:34.908 - 00:41:12.484, Speaker A: Anyway, so let's get back to the slide. This all started when I was at Google and I discovered Memgen, an internal tool used by employees to create and distribute memes about everything Google. I remember sitting at all hands meetings and everyone had mem pulled up on their laptops and phones. Sergey or Larry would be on stage, say something ridiculous, and immediately the memes would proliferate. So when I was at Tinder, I recreated it with a few other colleagues. We put up a bunch of flyers in the bathroom stalls, but it was probably shut down the next day due to moderation concerns. So my hope is to revive meme feed once again here in crypto, and I think it's the perfect place for it.
00:41:12.484 - 00:42:00.184, Speaker A: Every community needs Uncle Tom's cabin to come together, discuss, disagree, and celebrate. That's what each room in meme feed represents, as well as aiming to be verifiable censorship, minimized and private by default. After a foundation is set, I hope to explore how we can reward contributors. So how does it work? I'll keep it brief, but basically meme feed post data directly to Celestia as a sovereign roll up with a single sequencer. It stores the data in postgres, including image hashes and actual images are stored in s three. All data is posted as listed, so everything's on chain, including users likes, memes and rooms, and recorded with the pending transaction status. This part is not implemented, but basically a DA worker would reconfirm blobs and updates the transaction status of final and to verify the strike transition function, a new node would sync by reading in all blobs and reconstructing the state to verify image data.
00:42:00.184 - 00:42:21.688, Speaker A: This is TBD, but maybe we could delegate to a data storage network or something. So what's next? The target is testnet. There's plenty more to do before that happens. For that, there will probably be rooms for each house, lumen tree, mineflux, puddle trail, and even one for whims of fall. So please reach out here if you're interested in any way or to provide feedback. All is welcome. If you want to stay connected, give me Ford feed.
00:42:21.688 - 00:42:33.024, Speaker A: I'll follow on Twitter. That's all. Thank you. Awesome. Thank you. We do have a question in the chat. How is it private by default? It's not.
00:42:33.024 - 00:43:00.302, Speaker A: Right now that would be a goal. Cool. Cool. What was the most difficult thing about building this? Well, it took a while to get clear on the tech stack. Like I knew what the product was. I knew that I wanted to go with the sovereign roll up, so it took me a while to get clear. And when Mustafa presented and said, just do a base roll up, I was like, wow, that's actually like, I don't need any of the fancy bells and whistles.
00:43:00.302 - 00:43:19.870, Speaker A: Let's just go with this and see what happens. And so to get clear on that part actually took me a while. So that's kind of like the build whatever. You can go any direction, but then it's like to have like a little bit of like, you got to make your choices at some point. Awesome. Yeah. I look forward to seeing what you do with this.
00:43:19.870 - 00:43:46.214, Speaker A: Yeah. Thank you. And thank you again for presenting. Next up, oh, we have me now. I'll be sharing a video from someone who wasn't able to make it today. And this is for sloth chain. Lazy morning, my name is.
00:43:46.214 - 00:44:44.144, Speaker A: This is a presentation for sloth chain. I have a friend with me who will do most of the presentation, but I will be back. Lazy morning, I'm here today. Tell you about sloth chain, my new home. So the whole point of the sloth chain used to be a Celeste sloth society meme chain, the popular NFT that was launched from Stargaze. The chain is a roll up built on rollkit and it consists of nfts, dao, dao, a good amount of emojis and a lot of laziness because that's needed. The whole point is basically to be able to send over nfts to slot chain and be able to use them in Dao or for other purposes, but basically being able to have a home for the slots.
00:44:44.144 - 00:45:31.344, Speaker A: This can be used for many things. If, for instance, part of the revenue from the slots were to go to this tao, then the slots could have additional utility, for instance, but it could also be other things. That's whatever basically the community wants to do. It will have a way to actually do it where the vaults would be their actual entities. And all of this software exists is basically just putting it together and put it on Celestia and on vault. So basically the setup looks sort of like this. Nfts are mostly, or I guess, all on Stargate today.
00:45:31.344 - 00:46:20.600, Speaker A: We can send them over to another chain via IBC using ICS 721, which is implemented and testing and working already. And then you can basically stake your nfts for governance in Dao Dao, which I called proof of laziness. And then basically you can do whatever you want. The communicant can, can have a coin related to this where proof of laziness gives you some sort of lazy coin over time or something like that. But you can also be be no coins involved at all, which is also something that the community has voiced concerned about. Oh, getting lazy here. I think those are enough slides for now.
00:46:20.600 - 00:46:50.194, Speaker A: That was a lot for my friend there. I can take over now. Indeed, too many slides since this recorded. I'll do the Q and A by myself. I just thought up some questions that I thought might be relevant. So why do this at all? I figured I'm obviously a slot builder and I figured it would be a good use case for the slots to have their own lazy home. We can sort of make it into a really mean chain.
00:46:50.194 - 00:47:49.088, Speaker A: So that's sort of what I've done as well. I put a lot into like for instance, it doesn't produce blocks unless there are transactions. So it's lazy aggregation on Rolekit and then emojis obviously in the logs, just silly stuff like that. But there can be a lot of fun meme things that you can only do with the sovereign roll up that I would love to explore further. So yeah, if the community is interested in that eventually, then there's a lot of potential to get silly and have fun and lazy. Celestia obviously brings the capabilities of the roll ups with the data availability layer. And basically it means that we could have this meme chain that doesn't have an aggressive meme that sort of causes a lot of grief and issues.
00:47:49.088 - 00:48:31.964, Speaker A: It can be just a nice fun place. We can sort of mostly get around without having, having to introduce new topics, which I think is a good possibility. And finally, thank you for attention and stay lazy. Thank you. Guillermond remotely. Next up we have minimal and we'll have Vikash again to present. Vikash, do you have your slides ready? Nice.
00:48:31.964 - 00:49:09.790, Speaker A: Hey, there we go. Yeah. So, hey, everyone, this is minimal, right? Basically it's in full stack process project which is used to, you know, interact directly with the buyer and maximize profit, right. It's kindlier type of the marketplace, right? So if I talk about the problems. So there are various problems, right. Which exists currently in the market. First one is the middleman interface, for example, like Amazon, right? It's, you know, a very, very, very big marketplace and there, there is a cut reduction, profit reduction from the buyer or the seller.
00:49:09.790 - 00:49:27.482, Speaker A: Right. So the second problem is the profit margin reduction, right. And the third problem is more gas fees. The user has pay more gas fees if that in decentralized. Right. To solve all this problem. So I thought to why not to, you know, just remove the middle band, right.
00:49:27.482 - 00:49:50.070, Speaker A: So why can I. And if I talk about the profit. So under means if the middle. If there. There isn't any involvement of the middle band, then of course the hundred percent profit which gonna, you know, get by the buyer as well as seller. Right. So if I talk about the higher gas fees, then this can, you know, removed by deploying this project on the.
00:49:50.070 - 00:50:20.138, Speaker A: And I deployed this project on the condit roll up, model three and use the data availability celestial for the data availability. Right. So let's go for the demo, right. So basically you had talked about, you know, okay, the children. Yeah. So this is basically a marketplace, right. And I can sell the item.
00:50:20.138 - 00:50:26.254, Speaker A: Right. For example, the name. Right. This is for the testing. Right. And this is the description. Right.
00:50:26.254 - 00:50:39.970, Speaker A: And I can set up the price as well. I can choose the file and image. The NFT will be created and also one token will be created which is going to incentivize the listing. Right. Who own the list. And I have to pay 0.0025 eth.
00:50:39.970 - 00:50:49.234, Speaker A: Right. For the listing. Yeah. So after that, this product come in the home page. Right. I can buy this product. Means anyone can buy this project.
00:50:49.234 - 00:51:03.706, Speaker A: Sorry, product. And. Yeah. So 100% profit is gonna get by the buyer. Right. And the one who are selling. So after that, after the transaction is confirmed, this will disappear from the marketplace.
00:51:03.706 - 00:51:15.174, Speaker A: Right. And it will go into the minor item section. So under my item section, I have the option to release this product. Right. For example, I want to release for this 0.1. Right. So I can release this again.
00:51:15.174 - 00:51:32.984, Speaker A: Yeah. So I have to again, you know, h. Take 0.025 for listing this product. So after, you know, listing this item will, you know, be on the marketplace. Right. As you can see that the update price is 0.18.
00:51:32.984 - 00:51:53.308, Speaker A: This is the dashboard, the all the item which I listed on the marketplace. And the third section, four section is item review. Anyone can give review for their product, what's their experience and what they like. Right? Yeah. So basically. And I usually, again, have to, you know, stick some more eth. Right, for this.
00:51:53.308 - 00:52:12.744, Speaker A: And this is currently the review section, right? Yeah. So this is about, you know. All right, Vikash, that's. That's time. Sir, thank you for the demo. Just want to make sure everyone else, the lifetime present as well. Thank you so much.
00:52:12.744 - 00:52:37.494, Speaker A: Thanks. Hey, Josh, I think you're on mute. Oh, hey, I can't hear you guys. Yeah, thank you. I was gonna say thank you, Vikash. We're a little bit behind on time. So we're gonna need to get to the next three presentations.
00:52:37.494 - 00:52:46.464, Speaker A: So next up, I'd like to welcome Djen builder for the real time betting game. Oh, an infinity mirror.
00:52:48.324 - 00:52:50.104, Speaker C: Oh, can you see my screen?
00:52:50.404 - 00:52:53.220, Speaker A: Yep, we got it. Yeah.
00:52:53.292 - 00:53:39.898, Speaker C: So, hello, everyone. Djen builder out here. I love to build for DJ's, and as you know, DJ's love to take risk. So I built a real time betting game on the l three roll up and which is deployed on the roll up using conduit, and it settles on mode and uses Celestia as the data availability layer. So it looks like this. And how do you play? You can place your bet, so the users can place their bet based on choosing a single number from zero to 36, or betting on whether the outcome would come even or odd, or black or red color, first or second half of the table, etcetera. So this is how this is, these are the options that the users can vet.
00:53:39.898 - 00:54:07.510, Speaker C: Now I will show the quick demo of how it looks like. I hope you can hear the sound. So here I choose the second third of the numbers and I try to spin up the. Okay, just a second. So here, here you can choose, if you want, the number of like the amount that you want to place the bid. The minimum that you can start with is 0.001, but you can choose to place like two times 0.002
00:54:07.510 - 00:54:44.698, Speaker C: or 0.003 based on your risk taking capacity and would be bidding. So here I choose the second third of the numbers and I try to spin up the wheel. So as I click on spin the wheel, transaction would be pop up, asking me to confirm the transaction. So here I confirm it. So as you can see that I'm passing 0.001 value and I am placing my bed and the spinning starts off and this wheel is spinning up as in real casino, it happens up.
00:54:44.698 - 00:55:25.480, Speaker C: And this actually, okay, so I got four as the outcome, which was not what, okay, so I lost in the game that I created, but that's what Degen is. So going behind now the architecture and how it works section. So this betting game is like, as I said, it's deployed using condit and rolekit on the layer three. And so the user places his bet on the front end and then as you saw, the user spins up the wheel. The real tech is behind this because on the roll up, currently we don't have any, any system which provides us with a random number. So even Redstone doesn't support. So I had to go through the gelato VRF way.
00:55:25.480 - 00:56:25.994, Speaker C: So gelato VRF generates a random number on the mode blockchain and then I use hyperlink or toss to get that random number bridged from that mode chain to this roll up chain, and that random number decides whether the bet was successful or not based on the smart contract. So here is the hyperlink deployment code and this is the contract. So I will show the contract real quick. So contract has various functions and it shows you how the betting is implemented and the different functions like the spin completion and other functions like check if the third table won or not. So it's all based upon the random number generated and whether the user's bet was successful or not. As you saw that, I chose the second third of these numbers and the four, so I lost my bet. But yeah, I can try again and it incentivizes the users to play again and again, just like how it should be in the casino.
00:56:25.994 - 00:56:32.274, Speaker C: So that was much about my project. It was a quick, short demo, but I love to present.
00:56:32.934 - 00:56:33.834, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:56:34.454 - 00:56:35.594, Speaker C: Any questions?
00:56:36.914 - 00:56:56.666, Speaker A: No? Thank you. DGM builder. Thank you for the presentation. In the effort of speeding through the last ones, we're going to have to do questions offline. Next up we have arcidium. I guess we need Rojo as well. Yeah, hi, I'll just start with the demo.
00:56:56.666 - 00:57:48.574, Speaker A: So this is like the aim of the project was to make a, you know, multi platform wallet for lean rest and different iOS and like wasm for like a browser plugin and a mobile OS, basically Android iOS. So currently this is connected to GrPC and from endpoint to fetch data and some transactions and few features are implemented right now. So let's go with them. So initially, like few of the basic features is like we can, you know, create a new wallet and, or we can import an existing one by adding the twelve word mnemonic. 24 word mnemonic can also be integrated. Right now it's in this demo, it's not there. And so I'll just go with the existing wallet, which is already stored in the system.
00:57:48.574 - 00:58:54.732, Speaker A: So yeah, so like right now we can get the balance of the wallet of the account as well as like all the accounts right now which are added in this wallet. So I can go to a different account and see the balance and as well as like have an option to add another account either by like just add, click clicking on ad will add a new account in the same derivation path or import it through a private key if you add it in hex form. And so let's try out the features which are there. One is first is like the send points. So this is the gas which I'm getting from the blockchain. So just it out. So this should be success.
00:58:54.732 - 00:59:20.272, Speaker A: And here I should see the transactions which are successful. It should show. And so this is connected to selenium endpoint. So which gives the transactions. So this is mostly like we can add a different indexer if you want. So this, if I click on this, it would go to a browser, but I'm not sharing the browser, so you can't see it. And the other feature is basically uploading a file as blob.
00:59:20.272 - 01:00:14.044, Speaker A: So this is just more of a test feature which has added. And like, I can click on image and try to upload it as a blob here. And so let me check, see if it's already uploaded. Now. I think this didn't work out, but yeah, this was uploaded, so let me check if it's in. No worries. It's the, it's the demo gods.
01:00:14.044 - 01:00:35.482, Speaker A: But it's super cool and. But unfortunately, the time is up for this demo. So appreciate it, Rahul. Okay, thank you. And thank you again, Rahul. Last up for the day, we have doad and he'll be presenting blessed. Are you ready? Hi.
01:00:35.482 - 01:01:03.660, Speaker A: Yes, I'm ready. You can see my screen, right? Yep, we can hear you. Okay. I'm down from blessed. And I want you to imagine that you're trying to book a ticket for event you're really keen on and what is happening. Then you get into your virtual queue and you end up just seeing that the event is being sold out. And then you panic because you really want to go to that event.
01:01:03.660 - 01:01:54.200, Speaker A: And you look on the secondary market and you see that prices are skyrocketing because people were front running ticket sales and put a leverage price on it. And that's a really bad user experience for a fan because it costs them way too much money. And that's what we are trying to solve with blast. And we're, we built an event ticketing platform to fix that. And what we're doing there, we have lotteries on one hand and we have auctions on the other hand to provide like, a fair distribution of these tickets. And we are helping not only the fans together and have that fair distribution, but we are also helping with the auctions, the organizers, to get more money. This would be an event page.
01:01:54.200 - 01:02:38.230, Speaker A: And down here we have a grayish area. When we go into this grayish area, we see our interactive window where the sales is happening. And this is the first lottery. In the first lottery, you have to think of we're using, you have to think of a traditional lottery where we using a VRF of gelato to just pick their the legit person who put in the minimal deposit amount of money. And in case there's a match, then you can mint, you also can set something that is around that. And then we have the second lottery. And in the second lottery we have the user that can trigger the VAF.
01:02:38.230 - 01:03:09.988, Speaker A: So you can create lucky numbers. If these lucky numbers match to the target number, then you win. Let's see, in this case, I didn't win. Now we're coming to the third phase. The third phase is an auction phase where you have different rounds, and in each round you can add a certain amount of tickets. And if the demand is higher than the amount of tickets, in the next phase, automatically the price raises. And if there's a higher demand, again, this the VAF selects.
01:03:09.988 - 01:03:56.524, Speaker A: So it's getting fair. And the last auction part is gonna be an auction part where we have a leaderboard. And this leaderboard for that demo, we just used two persons that are eligible to win. And if you put in the right bit, then you win the ticket. And important is also that the lottery tickets are sold on tokens, they can't be resold and for the lowest price. And the auction tickets can be resold on the secondary market. And we used Opstack for the execution, celestia for data availability and gelato for the middleware and VAF, and also third web to give the buyer a good user experience.
01:03:56.524 - 01:04:38.554, Speaker A: Do you have any questions for me? I do not have any questions. I guess I'm excited to see this product come to life more after the hackathon. So I'm curious what your roadmap is like. Yeah, our roadmap is very full of tasks that we didn't finish within the hackathon. And I like to say, like, after the hackathon is before the hackathon, we are right now. Like, the good thing about 45 days of online hackathon is we are right now all in hackathon mode. And I hope that stays for a while like that because it was really fun.
01:04:38.554 - 01:05:04.814, Speaker A: I'm glad to hear it. Thank you again for presenting. And I guess that brings us to the end of demos for today. So I want to thank everyone for joining. Thank you, Brian, for joining from door hacks. And the judging period begins today at the top of this hour. And we'll wrap up judging on the 31st.
01:05:04.814 - 01:05:32.214, Speaker A: On Monday the third, we'll be having a closing stream to go over the winners of the different tracks and we'll be sharing more with it about that with everyone shortly. Thank you everyone in the chat for coming. We hope everyone had a good time and take care. Awesome. Thanks everyone. Amazing second day of demos. Bye.
