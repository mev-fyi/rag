00:00:04.650 - 00:00:05.966, Speaker A: Yeah, so the way I see it.
00:00:05.988 - 00:00:08.062, Speaker B: And this is kind of echoing something.
00:00:08.116 - 00:00:48.860, Speaker A: Like Ethan Bachmann said, which is that the invention of personal computing allowed individuals to be sovereign. Sorry, individuals to be sovereign, but the invention of blockchains allowed communities to be sovereign in the sense that for the first time you can actually have a shared community space where you can have a group of shared people, kind of can get together and organize independently of the status quo. In a sense that you can have.
00:00:49.810 - 00:00:50.720, Speaker B: A community.
00:00:53.410 - 00:01:08.110, Speaker A: With self agreed rules that are completely voluntary, that are enforced without requiring a third party like a court system or the police to enforce those rules. And this only works in a limited.
00:01:08.190 - 00:02:10.840, Speaker B: Kind of setting, specifically with resource allocation in a financial setting. But I think that's very powerful, and in particular because it's very Internet native in the sense that it allows anyone with Internet connection to join a movement or community and decide how resources within that community is allocated. But at the moment that's just currently done using dows and smart contract. But I think it would be very powerful if you could actually create your own chain. Community could create its own chain that does not necessarily derive its authority from some higher chain in the sense if you deploy Ethereum, dao or roll up, your chain is bound by the social consensus of the Ethereum community. But maybe you want to diverge from the Ethereum community. You don't necessarily agree on the politics of the Ethereum community.
00:02:10.840 - 00:02:17.142, Speaker B: You don't really have many options to have your own effectively state machine with.
00:02:17.196 - 00:02:21.194, Speaker A: Rules, unless you just create your own.
00:02:21.232 - 00:03:13.986, Speaker B: Chain with a weak validator set, which isn't great. But Celestia actually allows you to create what's called sovereign roll ups so that you can create a roll up that does not settle to any other chain. For example, Ethereum roll ups are effectively baby chains. To Ethereum they derive the authority from the Ethereum main chain. But similar to you have a GitHub fork that's connected to the master git repo. But what if you actually disconnect that link? What if you connect in GitHub? You can disconnect that from the network. And so that's like with a sovereign roll up, you can actually have a roll up that does not necessarily post or have an enshrined bridge to some other master chain.
00:03:14.098 - 00:03:15.858, Speaker A: You can have a completely independent chain.
00:03:15.954 - 00:03:31.450, Speaker B: Independent roll up, and you can hard fork that roll up at your own own will. The community can hardflow its roll up if it decides to, without having to ask for permission from the chain as it enshrined Bridgewood.
