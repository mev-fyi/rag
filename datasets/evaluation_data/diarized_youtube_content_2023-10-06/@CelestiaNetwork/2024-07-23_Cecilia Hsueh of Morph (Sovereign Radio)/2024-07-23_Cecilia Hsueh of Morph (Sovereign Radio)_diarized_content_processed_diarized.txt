00:00:00.840 - 00:00:07.862, Speaker A: Hi, I'm Anna from the Zero Knowledge podcast and I'm here today with Cecilia from Morph. Welcome to Sovereign radio.
00:00:07.966 - 00:00:08.810, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:00:09.190 - 00:00:14.566, Speaker A: I want to jump in and learn a bit about Morph and I really want to know what's the problem that you're trying to solve?
00:00:14.678 - 00:00:19.598, Speaker B: Well, we already have like probably 200 L2 on the market at the moment.
00:00:19.654 - 00:00:20.030, Speaker A: Wow.
00:00:20.110 - 00:01:03.272, Speaker B: And yeah, Mwolf is a new one. So we must bring something different. Right? And the difference, the biggest difference we have is not from the technical perspective, it's more from users and builders perspective because we noticed that on the market everyone is trying to solve probably minor technical problems better than the other one. This is the, you know, the current situation of all these L2 markets. But no one really cares about where to get the users, whether users care about your ecosystem and where to get the builders and how to really build up your ecosystem. So no one is really care about that. So that's why movies here to solve this problem.
00:01:03.272 - 00:01:09.816, Speaker B: So for us, builders and users are always more important than the pure technology and the pure TVL story.
00:01:09.928 - 00:01:21.928, Speaker A: How do you define a user or a builder here? Like are these, I mean a builder, I'm assuming it's someone who's going to deploy an application on this l two. But like who are they and who are the users?
00:01:22.024 - 00:02:03.508, Speaker B: Separate from that, I mean like users is definitely these people who use the applications which builders build. Right. And for us, for example, Mov already from day one we have like 30 million users from our centralized exchange and from the wallet database. So from day one we already have a huge user base for our builders. But the thing is that these are like very normal retail users. They're not like djing people, they're not like web3 native people, they're more like normal crypto retail users who hold crypto and also who trade cryptos. So they have the basic concept of web3, but that's it.
00:02:03.508 - 00:02:43.764, Speaker B: And they are using trading platform, they're using wallet and that's it. But they're eagerly and actively looking for other web3 applications which can create real value to their daily life. It's not just for Defi or meme Coin or Gamefi, this kind of more like speculation applications, but more like entertainment, social, lifestyle, loyalty related. So this is pretty common in web two, but you can never find this in web3. I feel like we are making this industry smaller and smaller in terms of application. You know, we are focusing a lot on very niche verticals. But look at these real users on the market.
00:02:43.764 - 00:02:49.884, Speaker B: No one's taking care of them. So that's what movie is focusing on to build, which is like a consumer blockchain for us.
00:02:49.972 - 00:03:01.280, Speaker A: You just mentioned that there was an exchange or there's another project. You're saying like from day one you already had these users. I think it would be great to talk a little bit about where that comes from. And I guess this is what you were working on before.
00:03:01.860 - 00:03:22.432, Speaker B: Well, my personal background is also from crypto exchange. I stepped into crypto in 2019 and I, the first crypto project I had is a centralized exchange called Phoenix. So we have about like 500 employees and the daily training volume was like 5 billion at the peak time.
00:03:22.496 - 00:03:22.768, Speaker A: Wow.
00:03:22.824 - 00:03:53.848, Speaker B: So yeah, that's how exchange is because you are the closest to the users and closest to their money. So I pretty understand like where the users are and how to get these users. But if you look into the tech infrastructure, the layer one layer, the L2s right now, they actually, actually don't know how to acquire these users. So that's why at very first beginning we collaborate with Biggit, one of the biggest exchanges in the world. Crypto exchanges in the world.
00:03:53.854 - 00:03:54.284, Speaker A: What's it called?
00:03:54.332 - 00:03:54.860, Speaker B: Biggit.
00:03:54.940 - 00:03:55.572, Speaker A: Biget, yeah.
00:03:55.596 - 00:04:08.350, Speaker B: Okay. That's also because that they have this vision to bring technology to users and also better builders, better applications to these users. Yeah. So that's why we have this 30 million users.
00:04:08.460 - 00:04:11.386, Speaker A: So that's how you started. You kind of like partnered with an exchange.
00:04:11.498 - 00:04:14.170, Speaker B: Yeah, we're incubated by them. Yeah.
00:04:14.290 - 00:04:27.818, Speaker A: So what were the, I mean, you launched the network, you have these users, but how do you actually get the things that they need? Like how do you get the builders to build what, what you're describing as a very like user friendly daily use cases.
00:04:27.914 - 00:05:09.912, Speaker B: Yeah. I think when we talk to most of the projects on the market at the moment, 90% of them is building like what I said, defi, meme, like NFT, Gamefi and probably now AI projects, no one is really building like consumer related. So this is also one of our biggest difficulty at the moment because the market is relatively small. From the builder wise, from the user wise, it's huge, it's massive adoption market. Right. But for the builder wise, because no one take care of this ecosystem, everybody just want to build into Defi directly because it's the easiest to get successful. It looks like it's the easiest to get successful.
00:05:09.912 - 00:06:04.388, Speaker B: So I think one thing is that our approach will be more like we want to tell all these web3 builders the value we are here is actually to bring the real value to the real world, the blockchain is here to solve the problem of centralization world. We should leverage that value of blockchain to solve the real world problem. Not just focus on the DJN people and provide the products they like. So this is one thing, and the only thing is that the another thing is that we are actually building a ventral studio model in L2. Which means that we can offer them an end to end support from incubating them. For example, the builders are normally their product or technology background. They actually don't know how to really build up a company, how to get users, how to go market.
00:06:04.388 - 00:06:28.128, Speaker B: So for us it's more like at the first beginning, we can help you to incubate. We have accelerator ourselves. So we can help you to build up your team. We can help you to connect with the best resources. We can help you to find, to write the deck, even to the investors. And then we can connect you with the VC's. And then we can funnel the users I mentioned to your protocol.
00:06:28.128 - 00:06:55.388, Speaker B: And last but not least, we can help you to go listing on the top tier centralized exchanges. So for builders it's a very complete journey throughout the building process. And if you go to other L2s, basically it's just like technical integration and that's it. So yeah, I talked to a lot of builders and they all have the same pain points. How can I do this? How can I do that? The only support I get now is integrate with them and that's it. Or grants. And that's it.
00:06:55.444 - 00:07:09.420, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. Grants. That's exactly. What I was going to say is a lot of the l two s do have grant programs and that's a way to support the ecosystem. They might also do hackathons. We see them at some of our events and stuff like that. But yeah, you're actually doing a company builder in there.
00:07:09.420 - 00:07:27.248, Speaker A: I'm really curious about the kinds of use cases that come out of this. And do you actually prompt any of them? Do you have a wish list of types of projects that you want and then you find teams to do it? Or are there teams already coming up with great ideas and then you're getting them to build it?
00:07:27.384 - 00:07:57.964, Speaker B: I think both ways. We are working in both way. But as I mentioned that there are not so many so clear verticals for these builders. In consumer vertical of applications. They're also kind of lost. But we still see the trend that people are caring more about, like what kind of problems they are going to solve for people. So for example, we are talking to like music related entertainment related, education related applications, retail related applications.
00:07:57.964 - 00:08:10.942, Speaker B: They're trying to use decentralization solutions to solve the real problem, problems in the real world. So yeah, I guess this will be a trend in the future, but it takes time. It's not a short term thing.
00:08:11.006 - 00:08:13.090, Speaker A: Yeah. What kind of products are there now?
00:08:13.670 - 00:08:14.966, Speaker B: We are still on testnet.
00:08:15.038 - 00:08:15.462, Speaker A: Oh, I see.
00:08:15.486 - 00:08:22.918, Speaker B: Okay. Yeah. So we launched our testnet in May. No, actually earlier, but our v two of testnet launched in May.
00:08:22.974 - 00:08:25.982, Speaker A: So this is just a few months ago as of recording. Okay.
00:08:26.006 - 00:08:52.682, Speaker B: Yeah, but our manage will come pretty soon in August. But I'm also very proud that we already have almost like 100 projects deployed on morph. And also in terms of users we have more than 1.6 million wallet addresses already, more than 26 million transaction happening on our testnet. So yeah, we see a lot of things happening but yeah, what kinds?
00:08:52.826 - 00:09:05.726, Speaker A: I want to go even the types of products, the types of like you sort of mentioned games and daily. But I'd love to hear more if there's other you sort of mentioned loyalty. I'm kind of curious what an application like that even looks like.
00:09:05.798 - 00:09:42.906, Speaker B: Yeah. So for example, we helped a very, very big web two music company called KKbox. They are actually a very mainstream music streaming company in Asia. I would say they are even like maybe they start this product earlier than Spotify. So they are pretty dominant in Asia but they always have this problem with the IP problem. So they really want to leverage web3 to help to solve these problems since we have like 2022, all these NFT FTX scamming stuff. So people are just scary.
00:09:42.906 - 00:10:25.560, Speaker B: You know, the musicians, they're just scared about, if you talk with them about NFT ideas, they're so scared. So they are restarting it to do it again. Probably not raising NFT idea, but they really want to solve the music IP problem with the web3 solutions. So we are helping them. They are deployed on morph already. And also for example, for loyalty, you mentioned it's kind of like for example, we are talking to one of the biggest retail group in Hong Kong. So they are like very traditional retail groups, but they have department store, they have cinema, they have even restaurants, all these stuff in their group.
00:10:25.560 - 00:10:46.168, Speaker B: What we are helping them is to creating the loyalty pointing system so that all these users go into any of their stores to consume. They will get the points on chain. Wow. And then you can make it into NFT or whatever. So there will be a lot of solutions in the future for them.
00:10:46.304 - 00:10:54.328, Speaker A: Geographically. When I was looking at your website, you sort of show you mentioned like a focus on different regions. Yeah. Where is your focus today?
00:10:54.464 - 00:11:31.164, Speaker B: So I would say our focus is Asia Pacific, Europe, and all these global sales markets. If for example, base is Bayes, arbitrage, optimism, they are more focused in us. Very US centric. We are the rest of the world. Because first of all, our founding team is, most of them are in Asia. We know exactly, actually this is a market where the real users are, where the real transaction happens. Because me, I was running exchanges and also we are incubated by exchange.
00:11:31.164 - 00:12:20.232, Speaker B: We know that all these transactions of crypto trading happens in East Asia, Southeast Asia, Europe. These are huge markets, but no one is building stuff there or caring about these users. So I think on one hand we can help these, for example, us developers who are very sophisticated in building innovative products to connect them with Asia Pacific markets, to get users to them, because they have no idea about how to get these users. And on the other side, also this Asia Pacific area and also global south area, Africa, Latin, they're full of talented developers, but also no chain is taking care of them. They don't get any resources from them. So we are here to help them. Cool.
00:12:20.232 - 00:12:20.728, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:12:20.824 - 00:12:29.280, Speaker A: And we didn't talk much about the l two itself. But are you a ZK roll up or are you not? Because I felt like there were some. There's like two things being described.
00:12:29.320 - 00:12:53.060, Speaker B: It is a hybrid roll up. I think we are the first hybrid roll up on the market because we think the ZK roll up technology is not that mature enough. And also the cost is pretty high. So we find a middle point. So it's like op and zk hybrid roll up. So basically we're still using the feral proof. But once you are challenged, you need to use the ZK proof to prove yourself.
00:12:53.060 - 00:13:07.374, Speaker B: So the outcome is that we are much safer than the pure op roll up. And also we reduce the challenge window date from seven days to less than two days. And on the other hand, we are more cost efficient than the pure ZK roll up.
00:13:07.492 - 00:13:11.194, Speaker A: How are you thinking about the l three part of the stack?
00:13:11.322 - 00:14:03.080, Speaker B: Yeah, for mov, we are also building our layer three after our manage. The thing is that for our L2, we are strictly stick to the concept of blockchain, which is decentralization, safety and also scalability. That's why we are completely using for example, Ethereum DA layer to make sure it's secure enough. But when we talk to builders, they also care about the cost, the efficiency of the whole transaction experience. So that's why we want to have our layer three also on top of our L2, because our layer three, we can use external DA to reduce the cost a lot. Yeah. So for our layer three, it's more for builders who care about cost, and for our L2 is for builders who care about security.
00:14:03.240 - 00:14:10.020, Speaker A: Okay, so actually, that question about DA. So your l two is not using Celestia for the DA, it's just using the ethereum. L1.
00:14:10.120 - 00:14:10.492, Speaker B: Yes.
00:14:10.556 - 00:14:12.580, Speaker A: And then this l three would be.
00:14:12.660 - 00:14:13.644, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay. Yeah.
00:14:13.692 - 00:14:25.180, Speaker A: Interesting. Cool. Well, thanks so much for sharing with us all about Morph. So thank you for watching this episode of Sovereign Radio. And make sure to check out all of the other episodes.
