00:00:01.880 - 00:00:38.604, Speaker A: Hi, I am Alexander. I've been doing films, computer games. I came into Ethereum at some point and tried to fix the UX when nobody heard about ens, which was very hard. I tried to build stuff on top of Ethereum artworks. I tried to avoid a crazes. I've at some point tried to be part of like the NFT movement before it was there. And then I started building music for traders during the biggest NFT boom there was.
00:00:38.604 - 00:01:21.110, Speaker A: And then when everything crashed, we released what? Yeah, so I'm also known as R. Right now this talk is part of a song called Capybara and this is the Recipe. This all started at some point in South America. I joined Eve Global as a hacker in Peru. Somebody mentioned to me for the first time that something existed called Mud by lettuce. I was into computer games all my life. Tried to build games.
00:01:21.110 - 00:01:53.032, Speaker A: Modded half life, modded doom, modded Duke nukem. And then on Ethereum this was. It would have been fun to build something on Ethereum, but it's very hard. Mud kind of opened the door there because it uses ecs. So for the first time we have a system where we can easily store state on chain. Somebody in my team mentioned it, so we kind of got hacking around. We built something that was not exactly real time, but sort of felt like a real game.
00:01:53.032 - 00:02:32.130, Speaker A: You built something, blocks together, try to build like a little city. We didn't really know what to do yet, but everybody thought it looked really cool. So we won a bunch of prizes and that kind of funneled me for the next month, like a thousand years. I was South America, so. Well, I traveled to Colombia and I thought like, okay, you know, I can do this, maybe figure out what to do with it. And normally, like, as an indie game, Dev, you don't have like a thousand euros. You have like half a million for a three person team.
00:02:32.130 - 00:02:55.144, Speaker A: You spend two months figuring out whether your id is actually good at all. It's like completely batshita and you need to kill it. And you do two to six months for a vertical slice and hopefully within two years you're finished. Or you have twelve years of sweat and tears. And then maybe you get lucky. This is very different from two k in grants. Then you're building on chain.
00:02:55.144 - 00:03:24.026, Speaker A: Like, why are you building on chain? Because you get some affordances. Like your whole game logic can be used to determine whether you get an NFT or not. So it's not like selling like, I don't know, a loot pack or you can actually, you know, you can lose something. You can buy a sword, but you can lose it in. In the game because the rules. And then you build autonomous worlds, which are fucking idiotic. They are multiplayer by default, so you can't test it with, like, your friend.
00:03:24.026 - 00:03:50.370, Speaker A: You need like five to ten players. You have all this bullshit around on chain economics. We have no idea how this works. And if you have an example of games that do economics, like Eve online, they actually closed down their economics, so they gated by having, like, as. Wait. It's very technical. They sell like a player pass to avoid direct influence from gold sold into the game.
00:03:50.370 - 00:04:20.510, Speaker A: So really unexplored territory. So the difficulty level to even start doing all this stuff is bizarre. And then you get VC's and the first thing they ask you is like, why are you building on chain? And then I'm like, yeah, bro. I don't know. Like, honestly, I think it's fun. It's interesting. It's like cooking, you know, you don't know what the final result is unless you have a recipe.
00:04:20.510 - 00:04:39.312, Speaker A: I have no idea. But, like, it's a bit like this game getting over it. It's really hard. It's so fucking hard. You actually don't want to play it. And it has like 60,000 positive reviews. And if you do, like, an analysis on the reviews, we have a metric to figure out how much revenue we think that game made.
00:04:39.312 - 00:05:01.590, Speaker A: It is in the end, like 11 million, which is kind of funny. Like, this guy, this game nobody wants to play, still made. Well, think about it. I read this morning, friendtech actually only made 30 million. It's not that much bump dot fun, which is not that fun. Made 50 million. So, like, I mean, this is.
00:05:01.590 - 00:05:39.130, Speaker A: This is one guy who, who made this game. What? He says, like, he made this game to hurt people. Okay, well, so why just cooking? And what's the recipe? I don't have the recipe, but, like, some people invent their own formula for what it's like to be a Michelin freestyle. So I feel this to me a bit like you don't know what's going on. It's kind of like going to the market in a new country. You look around the shops, maybe there's a fruit you never tasted. Maybe, you know, like they have like 20 different potatoes in Peru.
00:05:39.130 - 00:06:10.064, Speaker A: And then you shop around block time delay. So building something on chain means you're waiting on a few minutes, 15 seconds. On L2, you wait 2 seconds. When you get really lucky, you build an arbitrum orbit, you get 250 milliseconds but you press a button, you still have to wait. So you got to figure out how to compensate for that. Not having players kind of a problem because like I said, it's multiplayer. You can't test your game.
00:06:10.064 - 00:07:04.000, Speaker A: You need to pay people. But then all these people are just here to get paid, which is okay, well, fuck it also. And then we wanted to figure out how to do this. So we built something, and then there's a video and we have 250 millisecond delay. So we bridge the gap, but just having a particle effect makes it feel like it's still happening in real time. Then some stuff doesn't actually need to be on chain. Like, for example, the other players talking to you.
00:07:04.000 - 00:07:39.624, Speaker A: It's real time communication, but it doesn't have to be on chain. We don't want people in crypto to come in and go like when token, so we didn't want to a chat. We do like this bubble that's kind of borrowed from the video game journey or like stolen. So people know the presence of the other players and they build stuff together. So this is the first tryout. This is where we are right now. And these plants grow.
00:07:39.624 - 00:08:27.754, Speaker A: This is what we're trying to figure out right now, how to do a game loop on chain. So at some point the jungle will grow, it will grow over the houses. We're trying to build an autonomous world. I mean, there's a lot of theory about it. We don't know what game will be in autonomous world, but I think it would be nice if it's alive, if there's plants growing animals, that's really like, they talk about digital physics, but what would it look like? And then also, like, somehow we have to make money or we can create maybe different affordances in crypto, which, like, I think ideas around hyper structures are really interesting. So we were like, okay, maybe we can. We also have, like, we can have like maybe a hundred players right now.
00:08:27.754 - 00:09:11.346, Speaker A: Pretty big problem. Maybe people can watch the game and pay for something to happen in the game so they don't do like 100 actions per minute, just like they influence the world. So we're trying this out by making people, giving people the capability to make stuff grow. And this could later be like a Sim city disaster and like a volcano or whatever, but we wanted to set this up to make it make sense. You make the plans grow, but maybe do something in real life as well. So you just connect in the game, you actually pay. And it goes straight to this organization that I know from being in Colombia sacred mangrove, Mangla Sagrado.
00:09:11.346 - 00:09:35.470, Speaker A: And they reforest there. So they have like a safe wallet now and other donations go straight to them. They're really cool, they've been. So they see the effects of tourism there. So I'm playing with this idea of virtual tourism. Well, so this is what we do. So it will change stuff in the world.
00:09:35.470 - 00:10:01.704, Speaker A: So that's like a spectator mode idea we're playing with because I'm trying to avoid sort of. Well, I'm not getting any choice. Design is a bit like a dance. Like, I don't know what the best idea is, but I also don't think it's copying Minecraft. Minecraft is designed around different constraints. So you have to play a little bit to create something nice and you can prepare. But it's like dancing.
00:10:01.704 - 00:10:35.410, Speaker A: You have to feel it out. You have to dance with your partner. And like I said, I'm trying to avoid some things that might push me in a very obvious direction. So the holy Mountain. What is the holy mountain? Well, probably not NSTs or another casino. I think people play games because they give a shit. So what is the real game? What is really important to people? And Albert Motherfucker Einstein said, plays the highest form of research.
00:10:35.410 - 00:11:17.570, Speaker A: I only use this quote because nobody else knows all the other cool thinkers in gaming and ludology, we have a genuine desire to engage with stuff we really want to in order to figure out how things work. We don't need to get paid. It's just like a nice added bonus. And we actually want to suspend ourselves in a story to experience what happens. We watch movies, not because we go into the cinema and we come out with five more euros and we actually pay for stuff because it's cool. You actually want to see a good movie. And we are not really fascinated by how things work.
00:11:17.570 - 00:11:49.630, Speaker A: We want to understand how other people experience things so we can create a lot of value that we're not doing right now. And we have like this really cool layer of crypto that we can build upon. And there's something weird about playing a game that you don't see very often is that you can actually choose to lose. Like, if I play tennis with, like, my girlfriend, sadly, she's not here. But, you know, if I get better at the game, I can choose to, like, suck at it. You know, I could go like. No.
00:11:49.630 - 00:12:17.958, Speaker A: Like, I can pretend I'm not that good because I maybe I just really want to play with it. So there. And there is something really interesting about games and something really interesting about the value we create. So I have this really weird hypothesis that I think everybody would probably disagree with, but for me, that's really important. Ownership is fucking boring. I don't want to have a cardinal, like an infinite car, or like a forever character. I want to be able to lose.
00:12:17.958 - 00:12:55.246, Speaker A: I want to lose stuff because that gives it value, or somebody else can lose something. And I think that people actually play for a really good reason. I don't know what that reason is. I think it's very individual, but they have a reason, and it's probably not money. And also, money is not what people see as value. And I think we now that we have a little bit more tooling, like mud, we have people thinking about this. We are going to explore, like, this whole area of crypto that is not about immediately about money, but it is about how do we actually create value for people.
00:12:55.246 - 00:13:25.834, Speaker A: And that could be people playing a game to donate, but also just having fun with friends. I think we can do that. I don't know why on chain, but it offers you a lot of new, you know, new ideas that don't exist. And you see, the game industry is really looking for ideas. Games are our agencies. So they allow us to go into a different world, experience something else. They allow us to be, like, a different person.
00:13:25.834 - 00:13:57.060, Speaker A: They allow us to figure things out that we can't do in the real world. And the real world is really fucked because you have to pretend you love your job. And actually, when you win at the game, it's not fake. Playing is real. Like, I've still won the game. So there's a really interesting overlap between these areas of, like, the virtual and the real world. I think the most important part, or, like, I know one of my teammates has a partner that she found in the game.
00:13:57.060 - 00:14:23.410, Speaker A: And I know this story is super common. Like, people can fall in love with each other while playing together. So I have four minutes left, and I have nothing to say. So you can think about all this stuff. And then my perfect slide is like, I want to turn excrement into gold. Or, like, that's what Alejandro Khodorovsky would do. So, yeah, that's it.
00:14:23.410 - 00:14:25.630, Speaker A: I'm really happy to answer questions.
