00:00:03.160 - 00:00:35.354, Speaker A: All right, we're live. I'm really excited about today. Today we're going to kick off this amazing CTF challenge with Node Guardian for the infinite Space Bazaar. Here I got Sam, Hector, Brian and Josh, the wonderful theme from no Guardian and my partner in crime, Josh. We're really excited about the challenges today. It's going to officially kick off the CTF challenges on the awesome node Guardian platform. And in order to kick it off, I'm going to hand it off to Sam.
00:00:37.294 - 00:01:11.158, Speaker B: Gnod, everyone. Thanks for having us. I'm super excited to be here with the team and yeah, more than happy to explain what Node Guardian does. So, no, Guardian is basically a tool to onboard developers on credible ecosystems. It kind of looks like a role playing game, but instead of hacking and slashing with your mouse and keyboard to kill the monsters, you need to write codes to beat the dragon or something like that. So you have to clear challenges on the platform that are like lore rich. There's a story that unfolds as you know.
00:01:11.158 - 00:01:48.254, Speaker B: You clear the different steps and you get credentials in return and skills along the way. That's the general concept. Our goal here is just to make the whole experience of onboarding developers, upskilling them as fun and better as possible. It is free to use no newsletter or anything that's intrusive to go through to use the platform. And it is very fantasy inspired, let's put it this way. And there are a lot of sublime that I can showcase here that you have on the platform. I can give a high level overview of how the platform does look like.
00:01:48.254 - 00:02:48.890, Speaker B: This is the main menu, you have an overview of the latest challenges, and you have a second tab called quests and campaigns, where everything is listed as on a Netflix main page or something like that. So these are the different campaigns. As you can see, each campaign and quests have different attributes. Their difficulty, the stack that they're covering, the nature of the challenges and the specific aspect of a given stack that they tackle. Is it about low level programming, data structures and algorithm? Just pure math, security, you name it. Going back on the different kinds of challenges that we have, I said that this build the theory and the CTF. So theory is basically an article that is going to break down specific concepts, mathematical, like a concept of cryptography, you name it, that you might need to understand before tackling a more complex practical challenge.
00:02:48.890 - 00:03:24.082, Speaker B: So if you want to deal with self addresses and solidity, you might want to go through some nifty curve cryptography basics. And we're just here to provide this in on the platform, so you don't need to basically run on multiple places across the web to find like that the relevant information that you need so it makes your life better. And that's pretty much what theory these are articles. And there's a cool quiz that you can do at the end to assess to verify that you understand the concept properly. Then there's build. Build is I'll start with CTF first to go, and go to build afterwards. CTF is capture the flag.
00:03:24.082 - 00:04:33.302, Speaker B: And that's what we're doing today with infinite space. Bazaar capture the flag is a fully on chain programming challenge where you deploy a contract and you need to trigger a specific event on chain so that we can detect that you've done this or that automatically. Have you manipulated the price? Oracle, have you stolen the money in the contract? Have you done an arbitrary thing on chain? If we can detect that you've won the CTF, so that's fully on chain, and then you have build challenges. So that's when we need to verify that your code satisfies more intricate criteria. And when we need to do that, you need to install a GitHub application and we need to run private tests on our side, basically to see that your code is really matching this specific constraint that we've defined and that allow us to broaden the scope of what can be verified via node guardians. Like you can have a fully gamified brain fog VM implementation in a domain specific language, and we'll just run specific tests to see that you're building it properly, basically. So that way the platform is a bit more exhaustive.
00:04:33.302 - 00:05:37.958, Speaker B: And finally, once you clear a challenge, you get access to credentials, but credentials are not issued in the forms of certificates or diplomas. You get achievements and soulbound gold that you can use to craft this. Hundreds, thousands of items that we have that represent your proficiency or your involvement with a specific stack. And so someone with a very elegant, let's say, coat of arms and mail chain is probably someone has been very much involved with, I don't know, like solidity CTF, I'm just giving a general example. And someone who has done a lot of, yeah, like a bunch of quests on the platform and has been performing pretty well. And then you have different components that you also find in your average role playing game, like a skill tree that is needed to craft specific pieces of item that you might prefer over another. And finally, you have a comprehensive interface called journal that lists your progress that you can share with friends and whatnot.
00:05:37.958 - 00:05:57.754, Speaker B: So that's the high level overview and I think that would be nice that we also showcase like the whole, the whole flow and I believe that Brian has something ready in that regard. So yeah. Happy to hand it over to Brian.
00:05:58.534 - 00:06:22.388, Speaker C: Yeah, I can show off how embarking on a quest looks like. Yeah. Cool. So yeah, this is the homepage. So typically you would log in using your GitHub account. You can look at, you can log in via this top right icon here. So it takes a while to load.
00:06:22.388 - 00:06:57.804, Speaker C: Oh no, this is my bed. Let me quickly sign in. Cool. Yeah, so you know you are logged in when the fire dragon becomes the space dragon. That's how you know you are like a if participant. You pick your house, your team. I mean, I'm going to pick the platypus ones.
00:06:57.804 - 00:07:30.730, Speaker C: Looks cute. Okay, here we go. So yeah, this is how it looks like. So to start you just click on this little button here, infinite space bazaar, and you're brought to the five quests that we are featuring for this event. This quest straddles across a range of difficulty. You have some easy ones like static call detection and bypassing ext code size, and you have more difficult ones including celestial blobstream. So yeah, they will cover a range of topics like using blobstream, basic solidity.
00:07:30.730 - 00:08:02.994, Speaker C: There's one for low level half programming and there's one for DeFi exploits. Yeah. So the one I'm going to demonstrate is the easier one, static call detection. So yep, you would start the quest. And typically quests start with a little storyline. So the storyline that for this quest is you are in this port town and the guard alarm isn't working and because of that they cannot successfully detect pirate ships. So this presents you a problem to solve as a mage.
00:08:02.994 - 00:08:41.144, Speaker C: So the problem is presented to you. You are to read a given contract. So CTF, generally there are contracts for you to hack and exploit. Yeah. So you just read the contract, study it, try to figure out where the vulnerability is at and to start solving, you deploy your CDF contract so you connect your wallet. We support all these wallets. I use metamask, so I'll quickly deploy my guard alarm contract and I'll give it a while.
00:08:54.463 - 00:08:59.483, Speaker B: So that's like the demo effect, there's always a little bit more latency whenever we showcase it.
00:09:00.583 - 00:09:35.092, Speaker C: That's the downside of being on chain, I guess it should be out anytime now. Let me see. Maybe if I refresh it. Okay, I think the front end is taking some time to pick this up, but let me see. No, it's perfect. It's fine. Yeah, so I think the front end is taking some time to pick it up, but I've already solved this quest so it's fine.
00:09:35.092 - 00:10:31.632, Speaker C: So typically once you're CTF contract is deployed, it appears beside the deployment button address appear and your job is to take this address, go on chain, analyze it and exploit it. So use whatever tools that is at your disposal, be it remix, be it hardhat foundry, whatever, exploit it. And once you think you've exploited it, there'll be a verify button beside the continue button. You click verify and if you're successful you pass the quest and once you're done you can click continue and you'll be brought to the post loop. So this is the ending of the quest. Congratulations, you're successfully solved and the story concludes. And yeah, so in this event, once you have completed the CTF quest and you happen to be the first one in your house to complete a quest, you will score points for your team and you'll find that, let me see.
00:10:31.632 - 00:10:37.800, Speaker C: Yeah, you will find your team's points in the quest leaderboard and yeah, we can see who will win.
00:10:37.912 - 00:10:38.604, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:10:42.984 - 00:11:18.494, Speaker B: Yeah, and yeah, speaking about the whole design and the whole experience, it's not an ide, an ide. It's not like in browser because we wanted the experience to be as close as possible from let's say like shipping production code. So you need to set up your own environment, work with your own tools and deploy your solution. So that's one design like special design aspect that we have on node guardians. And yeah, it's just to mimic, give like a more realistic experience to learners and hackers that do use the platform and we hope that you'll enjoy it as much as we enjoyed crafting it.
00:11:19.514 - 00:11:20.294, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:11:22.874 - 00:11:28.154, Speaker B: Thank you for the kind words, by the way. Thank you very much.
00:11:29.454 - 00:12:07.040, Speaker A: No, thank you guys for the presentation. This is super cool. I do have some questions. I just want to make sure with the audience if everyone followed along. Basically if you guys signed up for the infinite space bazaar with the type form, you're in the discord. You probably see this already. You go to node guardians IO if I'm not mistaken, and from there you can authenticate with your GitHub account and that would allow you to access the ise infinite space Bazaar five challenger and stuff.
00:12:07.040 - 00:12:23.654, Speaker A: And with that, I'm actually kind of curious about the blob stream CTF challenge. Like we don't have to talk about how to track it, but like what went Brian, what went into like the whole design? Because I heard that you CTF designer here.
00:12:25.954 - 00:13:24.296, Speaker C: I don't know how to share, but basically request covers. It introduces blobstream, which for those who don't know, is sort of like a bridge that relays Celestia data into any EVM chain. So maybe it could be the Ethereum chain, for instance. And this way, like, more modular roll ups can kind of use Celeste there for DA and then confirm DA activity within the, like, whatever roll up is sitting on for settlement, for instance. And this quest kind of introduces blobstream and how to use blobstream, and it does it in, I would say, accessible way where you don't have to spin up a whole roll up to use it. It's a fun little quest where you're supposed to publish a comet onto blobstream and save some town or help some majors with reading the star charts and whatnot. It's just a fun way to learn about blobstream.
00:13:24.296 - 00:13:25.884, Speaker C: Yeah, that's about it.
00:13:27.744 - 00:13:51.866, Speaker A: Super cool. Yeah. I mean, I was kind of surprised that you guys were actually cooking a blob stream CTF, given that we launched it not a long time ago and the fact that you're ready a CTF for end stuff is really cool to see. I do have a question from the audience. Yes. You are from Lumenkui, right? You can participate as our guardian. Ha ha.
00:13:51.866 - 00:14:10.562, Speaker A: I guess so. Although if you guys put all your hope on me, I don't know how far Lumen tree can go. So I think it's more like a team effort. You guys have to all, like, participate, you know, all the Lumen tree people, also all the puddle pillar people. Brian, you did pick puddle crew. You like the platypus, don't you?
00:14:10.738 - 00:14:11.814, Speaker C: I do agree.
00:14:13.114 - 00:14:18.934, Speaker A: The platypus is one of the most popular houses right now. People like a cute platypus. They can't help.
00:14:20.434 - 00:14:21.694, Speaker C: I see. Okay.
00:14:22.234 - 00:14:31.614, Speaker A: Yeah, we can wait for the audience if you have any more questions. Josh, do you have any questions? Actually, don't.
00:14:32.354 - 00:14:35.094, Speaker C: Maybe we want to comment on the scoring system.
00:14:36.194 - 00:14:38.054, Speaker A: Yeah, let's do that.
00:14:38.394 - 00:15:04.920, Speaker C: Yeah. So how the scoring works is that. Okay, so the basic rule is that the harder the quest is, the more points it's worth. Like a two sword difficulty. Quest will be worth 20 points, a five sword difficulty will be worth 50 points. And if your team solves any CTF quest, you get those points. So this means that it's one scoring instance per team.
00:15:04.920 - 00:15:32.684, Speaker C: So if you are the second person that scores for your team, it doesn't count yeah. And then we also have this rule to make things competitive, where if you are the first team to solve this quest, you get a 1.5 x bonus. So we call this the first blood bonus. And so the idea is that for your team to win, the idea is to score, I mean, to solve quests faster than other teams. Yep.
00:15:34.944 - 00:15:39.324, Speaker A: So basically, timing is of the essence here. All right.
00:15:41.424 - 00:15:42.444, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:15:43.664 - 00:16:07.216, Speaker A: All right. I'm also going to go over some of the stuff, and I think we can go over it together. So as a reminder for everyone, if you're participating in the infinite space bazaar, the bounty provided by Celestia is two five k USD. You can read more about, like, the special condition. It's from today, 04:00 p.m. UTC to May 2, 04:00 p.m.. UTC.
00:16:07.216 - 00:16:26.964, Speaker A: So that's about 48 hours to complete all five quests. Right. I think, Brian, you tackled the difficulty questions, but if there's more that you want to talk about, like first blood and 1.5 x multiplier, we can dive there a little bit. If not, I can move on.
00:16:27.384 - 00:16:39.900, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. I can quickly reiterate. Yeah. So if you are the first team that solves the quest, you get a 1.5 x bonus multiplied to that. Ten to 50 points.
00:16:40.012 - 00:16:40.744, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:16:42.724 - 00:16:47.544, Speaker A: Nice. I like that first plot. It kind of reminds me of a call of. Call of duty.
00:16:50.804 - 00:16:53.252, Speaker B: First blob. Actually. Not first blob.
00:16:53.348 - 00:17:05.116, Speaker A: First blob. First blob. That would be epic. So, guys. Yeah, I mean, some of the stuff. Let's talk about prizes. It's not just like, you know, the 2.5k
00:17:05.116 - 00:17:27.468, Speaker A: in prizes. Yeah, cool. You know, winning house gets some money. But here's the cool thing, there's a chance for the winning house, because if you guys remember, there's a modular summit. So the winning house will have a hacker house during the modular summit. It's actually going to be my personal base of operation as we, as I put out fire for the modular summit. And we're going to theme it with the winning house.
00:17:27.468 - 00:18:07.076, Speaker A: So there'll be a lot of, you know, the winning house will get a lot of theme, um, you know, swag and all the kind of design, whether you're lumen, cree mind, flux spuddle, prayer, or whimsical, you have a lot of it, you know, theme. So that's an opportunity to come visit the, you know, the hacker house. There will be nfts for the hackers for the winning house. So if you participate, representing your house, and you've done it in a group, we'll ask for everyone's names after, or like their Xerox address, and we will issue nfps for that. Will you offer beers and fries? Yeah, I mean, I heard a lot about the belgian beers and fries. I've been there multiple times. It's pretty good.
00:18:07.076 - 00:18:52.074, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, why not? We'll definitely offer beers and fries. And for specific hackers, does not apply to the entire winning house, but for specific hackers who actually contributed to the CTF, you get free tickets for the modulus summit. So there's a lot of interesting stuff for you, you know, like in terms of, I would like to call it incentive, but it's actually prizes, really cool prizes. So come represent your house and there'll be a lot of cool things, a few notes. You know, you should have been participating to register for the CTF challenge prior to the time now. So if you've done it in the last hour, you can't authenticate. Let us know on Discord or, and we'll take care of it.
00:18:52.074 - 00:19:30.446, Speaker A: You need a GitHub id. So when you sign up, like here, if you signed up to register now prior, you have to have provided a GitHub id because that's how you authenticate into nodeguardians IO. And if you already registered for the hackathon, like, you know, when it started a while ago, you're already eligible to participate. You have to represent your chosen house as it appears on Discord. So if you're on Discord, you're part of a specific house and you go to node guardian IO and you choose a different house. Unfortunately that will result in a disqualification. So please be accurate in how you represent your house.
00:19:30.446 - 00:20:01.440, Speaker A: You know, we're able to check because we're going to double check, you know, which winning house. We'll talk to the people under private, you know, common room on discord for that specific house. So please, you know, honor your house and the winning house. Like, you know, the people from the winning house, they will determine the distribution of the prices. So it's not going to be for everyone within the winning house because, you know, it'll be like a handful probably of people participating. They'll be able to determine the distribution of prices. That's it from overview.
00:20:01.440 - 00:20:34.614, Speaker A: Remember, if you want to kick off the challenge, go to node guardians IO. I'm already on it right now. I'm already authenticated. I have a really cool character having checked out my character. Let me see where my character, oh, look at that sexy little fella, right? And you're able to, you know, pick up a lot of the points for your quests. Now with that said, let's go to more questions. Let me go back here.
00:20:34.614 - 00:20:48.854, Speaker A: We got a little nice background while we answer questions. A question by Nicholas. What is the best CTF to understand Celestia, anyone?
00:20:52.184 - 00:21:07.324, Speaker C: Maybe I can answer this one. Right now, the only quest we have regarding Celestia is the Celestia blob stream CTF. We do have plans to make more, but as of right now, it will be the blob stream quest.
00:21:10.064 - 00:21:39.944, Speaker A: There you guys have it. The best one. Also the most difficult one, and the newest one is the blockstream one. I'm going to personally try to do it myself. Actually, this is a great segue for reminder for tomorrow. So tomorrow there'll be another live stream where me and a few select people, maybe Josh, I'm going to pull in Sam, maybe a few other people representing a few houses. We're going to attempt one of the CTF together and see how far we go.
00:21:39.944 - 00:22:11.724, Speaker A: Don't put your hopes on me, but I'm going to do my best, folks. So tomorrow is going to be a fun free for all. Very casual. You can tune in, you can see how we try to complete it. Not that I have all the answers in the world, but you know, we're doing our best here. Okay, so will you offer beers and fries? I think, Nicholas, we kind of answered that already. Get some clothes, Yaz.
00:22:11.724 - 00:22:37.694, Speaker A: I'm working on it for my character. We should definitely get some clothes for that character by completing challenger. Maybe tomorrow I'll get maybe some pants at least. Oh, Goreng, I didn't see the option to join a house when I joined Nord Guardian. Is that a problem? It depends on when you joined it. But if you joined it prior to the countdown, maybe try to log out from node guardians and log back in. I think that might fix the problem.
00:22:38.034 - 00:23:04.454, Speaker D: Also, if I may, it's possible that when you guys registered, you made a typo on your GitHub id or that some people just didn't put any GitHub id. If there's a problem and you feel like you should be eligible, you can contact us. We are available in the infinite space Bazaar discord. We are also on the not Gordon discord. Is there any issue and you feel like you should be eligible? Contact us. If you are too eligible, we fix it right away.
00:23:05.514 - 00:23:26.178, Speaker A: Yes, great, great point. So there is a channel on our discord. And Grant, I believe you're in our discord. I've seen you multiple times. It's called the CTF challenge, I believe. Let me just double check on discord. Where is it? Yeah, yeah.
00:23:26.178 - 00:24:08.304, Speaker A: So this channel on Discord, ping ping the team there, I think the team is under the like role node guardians. We can double check on that, but the team is aware they're there, so if you can't access it after doing that, the team is already on the discord. We're all here to help, so make sure that you're able to participate. Moving on, team. Oh, Didier, is team Belgium here? Nice. And Sammy, hope they can meet you all there. Yeah, I mean, you know, if everyone can come to the module summit, there will be a lot of crazy things happening there.
00:24:08.304 - 00:24:40.444, Speaker A: You know, we're talking to Node Guardians about maybe them having a small booth over there so they can show off their platform more for you guys IRL. So there's a lot of cool things planned with the team. Love the node guardians theme. If you guys have any more questions, feel free to ask, otherwise maybe. Okay, I have a question. Sam, Brian, Hector, what are things that hackers should be aware of participating as part of the CPF challenge? Like good tips and stuff like. I don't know.
00:24:44.344 - 00:25:02.960, Speaker D: I don't know. I would say like technical requirements. I mean, it's still a technical and programming challenge. So yeah, I would say it's not for complete beginners. You need to know a little bit about programming, you need to know a little bit of solidity. You need to have a wallet, a GitHub and everything like this. If you have all of that, you should be fine.
00:25:02.960 - 00:25:18.314, Speaker D: And you guys can work together within your house, you can exchange ids and, and try some stuff. Just if you have absolutely no experience. Yeah, might be a little bit complicated, but you can still help each other out. And if you have iDe, wallet and GitHub, you should be good to go.
00:25:20.054 - 00:25:36.056, Speaker A: Sweet. Also, I noticed that folks should also go on the block explorer in order to check their transaction or what they deployed a smart contract. Is that on Ethereum or a roll up or a testnet? Where is it on? Like they're deploying on.
00:25:36.240 - 00:25:45.360, Speaker D: Everything is done on the sepulchia testnet. So the five quests on Sepolia testnet, amazing.
00:25:45.552 - 00:25:50.504, Speaker A: There you go folks, sepolia testnet. If you're not aware, just one quick.
00:25:50.544 - 00:26:06.804, Speaker D: Thing, if they don't, if you guys don't have any sepolia ethereum, the moment you will link your wallet, the not go ahead info set will grant you some ethereum straight away. So you can start, so you can start with zero hit. We will give you some. Just don't lose any time with this. It's given by the platform.
00:26:09.064 - 00:26:26.664, Speaker A: Incredible. That's awesome also. Yeah, I'll give it a few more minutes if people want to ask any more questions, but if not, we can wrap it up. Yeah.
00:26:26.744 - 00:26:34.394, Speaker B: Pretty amazed by the reward, having a fully themed house branded after your team.
00:26:34.474 - 00:26:34.842, Speaker D: Basically.
00:26:34.898 - 00:26:38.174, Speaker B: I think that's a pretty crazy flex.
00:26:39.634 - 00:27:02.326, Speaker A: Yeah, it'll be a crazy flex if people can represent their house. I mean, the house is welcome for anyone from the infinite space bazaar. If you're in town, you can hit me up, you can join, but if you're part of the winners, you can come there. I'll be hanging out there. Base of operation. Because the modular summit this year is going to be a lot bigger than last year. I didn't know that was possible.
00:27:02.326 - 00:27:32.294, Speaker A: But you know, we're cooking a lot of things for that. And then, yeah, you can get to meet the team, talk to us and stuff. We'll have more information about that after. And I think like also what we're planning to do with a lot of swag. We're still specifying swag per house for the modular summit. So the, you know, stay tuned for that. And even after the hackathon is over, you know, we still want to build a whole community and stuff over time.
00:27:32.294 - 00:27:45.034, Speaker A: So expect a lot more things happening after the hackathon. Expect more thing, you know, from collaboration with no Guardian because, you know, this is not, it's not just 48 hours. It's like a much larger, longer term kind of partnership.

00:28:16.294 - 00:28:22.364, Speaker A: Oh, there's a comment by Nicholas Smart and I don't know, what does it mean?
00:28:23.904 - 00:28:58.866, Speaker B: It means we're fitting in the so Enrance Don format. In French means it's basically fitting the standard size. Like it's, you know, like the box is filled. It's not, I'm not sure like how to translate accurately, but it means like, yeah, it's fitting in there. It's a sentence I used to say on podcasts for years. Basically at the end when I, when I run out of inspiration or during a stream, I sometimes like say that, that very weird sentence which I'm struggling to translate to English.
