00:00:10.090 - 00:00:52.618, Speaker A: Well, guys, I will kick off the conversation here and there's just a lot to discuss. So if you're in the audience and you're tuning in, you're likely someone who has a sense of the underlying power behind blockchains. At their core, these things are social coordination tools. There's a famous book called sapiens. Sure you guys have read it, where the author Yuval Harari posits that what separates human beings from other species is their ability to organize in large numbers. To me, that's just so cool to think about like this question around how blockchains will impact organizational behavior in the next ten hundred thousand years. Now, there's a key topic at the center of all this.
00:00:52.618 - 00:01:25.282, Speaker A: That topic is sovereignty. My sense is that the look, feel and meaning of what it means to be sovereign is about to completely change. And I want to talk about this change. The two projects that I believe take the idea of sovereignty the most seriously are cosmos and celestia. And I also believe that our two guests here, Ethan and Mustafa, are two of the world's most foremost thinkers on this subject. Before we get into the conversation, a few things for the audience. There's two important reads you should note.
00:01:25.282 - 00:01:45.040, Speaker A: The first is written by Ethan, where in May he titled it the mind, body and soul of Cosmos. We'll get into that. And then the second. Mustafa recently just published this. It's a blog post titled roll ups to sovereign chains. That's why he went out to biddle, talked about it there. The recording will be out later in the next few weeks.
00:01:45.040 - 00:02:12.754, Speaker A: I'll structure this Twitter space for about an hour. We'll just dialogue and talk about it, but there will be A-Q-A. So please write down any questions that you want to ask. We'll go around and you'll have an opportunity to ask these guys some important cues. Now I'll turn to Ethan and Mustafa. This conversation, it's taking place at such an interesting time. The US sanctioned tornado cash, sparking a debate on whether the ban compromises users'ability to operate anonymously.
00:02:12.754 - 00:02:53.620, Speaker A: Biology has published a network state this idea of a highly aligned online community with a capacity for collective action. Modra blockchains are the new category, attracting the boldest and most creative developers who are building on entirely different set of values compared to monolithic counterparts. We're going to begin with the evolution of computing. Ismail DM'd me this video of a presentation that Ethan was giving at Hackadom and he was talking about the evolution of computing and he led up to this idea of the community computer. Ethan, we'll start off with you. Can you introduce this idea of community computing? And why did you call it a.
00:02:56.630 - 00:03:14.940, Speaker B: Sure, yeah. I mean, thanks a lot for the intro. I don't know if I'm actually a foremost thinker on sovereignty, though. I appreciate you saying that. It turns out the more I study the problem, the less it turns out. I think I know about it, but that's, I guess, a later conversation. The community computer idea.
00:03:14.940 - 00:04:07.770, Speaker B: I reason a lot by history, by analogy with history, and history doesn't repeat, but it does rhyme. And so I think it's important to understand history and understand where we're coming from. And it has always struck me that blockchains have a place in the history of computing. They're not some thing that came out of nowhere, even though people like to think about Satoshi like that, but in the same way that Christ was jewish, Satoshi also had a past in cryptography, in computing and so on. And so the way I reason about it and the talk I gave recently that you were referencing, I think Ishmael asked for those slides, so hopefully he's going out and pushing the community computer narrative, too. But the framing I was using was that sometime in the 20th century, we discovered a new substrate for computing. That's the silicon microchip.
00:04:07.770 - 00:04:39.782, Speaker B: And then the first thing we did with that was basically build these large mainframe computers to handle the world's computing needs. I mean, that was what they were for. Everyone was going to have these computers in these basements of IBM or Dell or wherever, and that would be that. And people who thought, oh, computers could be smaller or more people could have computers, or they could be more widespread, or they didn't all need to be in IBM's basement, those people were ridiculed. And it was thought that that didn't make any sense. They wouldn't have the security. It just wouldn't work right.
00:04:39.782 - 00:05:19.554, Speaker B: And of course, the mainframe isn't the type of computing that most of us are familiar with today. We had something that we call the personal computer revolution that transformed the relationship between the individual and technology, primarily by making the individual sovereign over their interactions, their interface, their ownership of the technology they use. And these personal computers completely have transformed civilization over the last couple of decades. Now we all have multiple of them. We have them in our pockets. I guess all of us here are on little baby ones mobile devices. And so these personal computing devices really made a big difference in our lives.
00:05:19.554 - 00:06:22.326, Speaker B: But it wasn't just about the personal computer. It was also about the technology that connected the different personal computers together, that's the Internet, essentially, right? And so, reasoning by analogy, I see very similar thing playing out in the world of blockchains, the new substrate for computing that we've developed, that's say, our equivalent of the microprocessor, is the consensus algorithm. In some sense, it's the blockchain consensus computing machinery, we could say. And the first thing we did with that new technology was we went out and built mainframes, and we called them things like bitcoin and ethereum and other global scale l one world computing type networks that posit themselves as being able to support all the world's computing needs. And in the same way that the mainframes of the past didn't actually serve us the way people might have thought, the mainframes of blockchains today probably also won't serve us in the way people thought. And what we need is the equivalent of the personal computing revolution. But whereas the microprocessor is like a singular thing that anyone can hold in.
00:06:22.348 - 00:06:24.502, Speaker C: Their hand and thereby have a personal.
00:06:24.556 - 00:07:30.560, Speaker B: Computer built out of it, the consensus processor is not such an isolatable thing. It's something that only comes together out of a group of people or a community, and thus gives rise to what we're calling the community computer. Right? And so, reasoning by analogy, the community computing revolution that stands before us, on which we're on the precipice of, let's say, stands to transform the relationship between communities and technology in the same way personal computers did between individuals and technology, by giving communities more sovereignty, ownership, control over their technology, and over the way that they interface with it. And so that's the future we're building towards giving every community, no matter how it's defined, whether it's the community of the entire globe or the community that comes together for a particular series of Twitter spaces, whatever it might be, sovereignty over their computing machinery. And that's what we call community computers, that it's a shared, community hosted device that represents the values of those communities and sort of gives them ownership over it.
00:07:31.410 - 00:07:44.020, Speaker A: Mustafa, over to you. In the context of all this change, this community computing revolution, what will it mean to be sovereign? How do you think about that and the evolution of that word?
00:07:45.350 - 00:08:47.110, Speaker D: Yeah, so the way I think about it is that sovereignty enables consenting groups of people or communities to enter into shared economic or contractual relationships with each other without the need for some third party or some institution to enforce the terms of those relationships. Now, if you think about it, throughout human history, society has been pushed forward by kind of groups of people with shared goals that have assembled. Whether it's the pursuit of the pursuit of grassroots activism or struggle, or some shared innovation or culture, society has been pushed forward by that. And as you said, it's what differentiates people from other species. The ability to kind of assemble in large groups. And even this freedom to peaceful assembly and association is a human right. It's article 20 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
00:08:47.110 - 00:09:42.790, Speaker D: But in order to fully realize that right of freedom of assembly and association, groups of people need to be able to kind of create and enforce social agreements and contracts with each other that codify and enforce the rules of those relationships within the community. And that's exactly what a community computer does. You have consensus over transactions, and the validity of those transactions are determined by some predetermined sets of rules that the community has agreed to, agreed to in a sovereign way, and that allows communities to kind of have relationships with each other, whether it's an economic relationship or a social relationship, without needing to rely on third parties like untrustworthy institutions or governments or corporations.
00:09:44.890 - 00:09:48.460, Speaker A: Ethan, do you see it the same way, or do you have a different take?
00:09:49.550 - 00:10:53.358, Speaker B: Yeah, I think I see it quite similarly. There's an element of sovereignty that is about continuity and about being able to constitute yourself and continue despite changes. Thinking about a sovereign individual is a little bit different. But as a community, the ability for the community to define what it is, and for that definition to persist over time despite internal changes, by virtue of some aspect of the community that is stable. And in this case, it could be the stable set of rules that define transaction, execution, validation, et cetera, that Mustafa was just referring to. But it's also about the community being able to control that and change that over time. I've seen a lot of the celestia writing these days, talking about how fundamentally blockchains are about social consensus and about the sovereignty of the society, essentially, that is deciding on the rules, that then decide on how they interact together.
00:10:53.358 - 00:11:07.700, Speaker B: Right? And that's really the key to sovereignty, that you have that kind of control and determination over your destiny as a group, rather than it being imposed on you from outside.
00:11:09.350 - 00:11:55.220, Speaker A: Mustafa has this saying. Groups of people with shared goals have an inalienable right to self organize, unburdened by the status quo. And I want to go deeper on this status quo and the current reality. I think for bitcoin, the original evil were banks, and that was the nucleus of the energy that was antagonist. And is that still the evil of today? And the question to both of you guys is what do you see as the most prominent evil that dominates the status quo? I'll start with Ethan on this one first.
00:11:55.830 - 00:11:56.242, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:11:56.296 - 00:11:59.010, Speaker B: Hell, yeah. The banks are still evil.
00:11:59.350 - 00:12:01.970, Speaker C: Hasn't changed. That's still important.
00:12:02.040 - 00:12:07.666, Speaker B: But I think we can go deeper to frame it really simply.
00:12:07.698 - 00:12:09.158, Speaker C: I think about the three factors of.
00:12:09.164 - 00:13:03.670, Speaker B: Production, land, labor and capital, or money, if you will. And I look at the institutions we have around those three factors, and there's evil throughout all of them. And in some sense, they all need to be reformed. And maybe, at least the way I've sort of thought about it, is we could start with money and work our way down through labor into land. But the way we've structured society around all three of those things, the institutions we use to manage these, what we could call fictitious commodities, none of these things are actually commodities, but we treat them like they are, and we empower certain institutions to govern them as if they were just commodities to be doled out on the market. I think that's a profoundly evil thing to do because it completely misrepresents what these things actually are. Right? Like land is not some commodity made for sale on the market.
00:13:03.670 - 00:13:42.370, Speaker B: It's like our inheritance of 15 billion years of evolution in the universe and what we've been granted to live off of on this planet together. And our labor, again, that's not a commodity for sale on the market. That's our human life force. And similarly with money, it's actually the networks that enable us to trade and exchange and produce and coordinate together. That's also not a commodity, but we treat it as such. And so I think even with bitcoin, it still has a quite, let's say, immature conception of money and the potential of money not to downplay its importance. I tend to be more bullish on bitcoin than most in the sort of proof of stake world.
00:13:42.370 - 00:14:29.554, Speaker B: But I think we do need to go deeper on the nature of money and also connect to these other issues in society. That's not just about the banks. So the banks are a huge evil that we still need to reckon with, but also our institutions around labor, which is, for instance, why our company, informal systems, is structured as a workers cooperative, right? And it's a simple way to start to rebalance the relationship between capital and labor and just re empower labor within your organizations, right. Rather than being shareholder based and only representing the interests of capital, sort of primarily in the structure of the company, you can actually represent very directly the interests of the labor force that actually makes whatever you're doing possible. And then from there, we also need to address these problems of land. I mean, in basically every case, private property on land is downstream of violence or genocide. Right.
00:14:29.554 - 00:14:55.994, Speaker B: And so to kind of ignore that and just pretend like, oh, yeah, we can just inherit this violent past and now just deal with everything on the market. I think there's a deep evil there. So I think we still have to start at money in the banks and kind of work our way down. I'm not really sure how to go at the other problems kind of more directly other than tweeting. Land value tax solves this everywhere I can on Twitter. But, yeah, I'll stop there.
00:14:56.192 - 00:15:12.752, Speaker A: Mustafa, over to you. The question is, who or what is the evil now? Looks like we lost him.
00:15:12.806 - 00:15:13.664, Speaker B: I think we lost him.
00:15:13.702 - 00:15:17.730, Speaker A: Yeah, I just added him back. Okay, Mustafa, are you with us?
00:15:19.240 - 00:15:19.990, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:15:22.360 - 00:15:23.876, Speaker A: Did you catch the question?
00:15:24.058 - 00:15:32.410, Speaker D: Yeah, I think I skipped some of it because my Internet was. Connection was lost. Sorry, go ahead.
00:15:33.580 - 00:15:40.890, Speaker A: The question is, or the context is that for bitcoin, the original evil were banks. Who or what is the evil now?
00:15:41.260 - 00:16:42.220, Speaker D: Yeah. So I would say this goal of sovereignty that cosmos and celestial envision and embody is a generalization of bitcoin's goal in the sense that I think the evil in this context, the evil versus community computing, is this idea of untrustworthy institutions, institutions that have traditionally been slow, bureaucratic, untrustworthy, corrupt, or prone to censorship. And a bank is an example of an untrustworthy institution. But this vision of sovereign blockchains and community computing kind of broadens that scope to other types of untrustworthy institutions, not just banks. So it's kind of extending bitcoin's philosophy to some extent.
00:16:47.200 - 00:17:04.950, Speaker A: Ethan, you've mentioned briefly in several tweets that the last couple of years about the Internet, and it's captured by web, two giants like Facebook. And then there's this term that you've brought up, digital colonialism. What is that? Give us examples of that and go just deep on that.
00:17:05.400 - 00:17:05.764, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:17:05.802 - 00:18:21.948, Speaker B: So this is the real evil, is Facebook. I have suspicions that 100 years from now, they're going to be teaching about history of corporations and they'll teach about Facebook the way we talk about the Dutch East India Company or any of these other early colonialist companies. This relates to the factors of production. We don't have to go into that whole analysis. But I think the digital colonialism, I mean, it's such a tragedy what's happened with the Internet, because something that emerged to enable sovereignty and to empower individuals and this new relationship with technology has just been completely transformed into this monster that has instead empowered a very small number of unaccountable megacorps that now basically govern the Internet and huge aspects of our lives. And Facebook is probably the worst among these in the sense that the whole company is designed in a way to hijack your nervous system and to basically, for lack of a better word, enslave your nervous system to their algorithms. And that's a very evil thing to do.
00:18:21.948 - 00:19:38.628, Speaker B: And Facebook is in some sense trying to colonializing digital spaces. It's doing it a bit more literally in certain geographic areas where they're providing Internet access, but the only thing you can access is Facebook related services. And so I see this as this monopolization or colonialization of digital space happening in a very aggressive, underhanded, in some cases even very directly evil way that they are trying to conquer and build basically an empire in our digital lands, the way that previous colonial empires tried to conquer physical lands and enslave people physically. It's difficult to make analogies with real human slavery because that's just the most tragic of all possible oppressions probably. But the Facebook colonialization is so insidious that you can't even necessarily detect it. It's happening at a different spatial, temporal scale, but people are already aware of the impact it's having on the minds of the younger generation. They're being brought up with a completely different relationship with technology.
00:19:38.628 - 00:20:32.790, Speaker B: It's something they're not really sovereign over. So something that was initially sovereignty, their relationship with the personal devices like hackers in the whatever has been morphed into this consumption based, advertising based economy, that really makes the individual a subject of the megacorp. And so there's lots more to say on that. I haven't really been studying the problem in detail recently, but it's a very scary, dangerous thing that Facebook is up to. I'm hoping Lena Khan is just going to blow them up. So that's what's it called, that organization, the department, FTC or something in the US that does like antitrust and stuff. So it seems like that we're on the verge of a new era of antitrust in the US, which is one of the only seemingly good regulatory things I think, that the US government might be up to, in contrast to some of the other stuff we'll probably talk about with tornado cash and so on.
00:20:32.790 - 00:21:00.848, Speaker B: I find it a bit weird to find myself aligned with the US government on certain things, but I hope to see Facebook broken up, and that's like the one thing. Facebook was the one thing I was afraid of for a long time. Then their impact on the world and on kids especially, and what that'll do to the next generation's ability to dialogue and discourse and maintain good relationships with one another. And I think we're already seeing the impact of that and huge negative impact of.
00:21:01.014 - 00:21:16.710, Speaker A: Yeah, my next question was, how can we alleviate ourselves from digital colonialism? I'll kick that question over to Mustafa. But also, Mustafa, if you want to build on top of what Ethan just said, go for it.
00:21:18.120 - 00:21:48.940, Speaker D: Yeah. So it's interesting because when the Internet first came about and started to kind of first gain traction in the meant to be decentralized, it was never meant to be decentralized. In the 90s, there wasn't these huge social media platforms. Of course. People were just interacting on these bulletin boards. There were lots of bulletin boards. And even in the early two thousand s, it was like people had their own blogs.
00:21:48.940 - 00:22:50.870, Speaker D: There was all these forums. Communities had all of these forums. If you remember back in the day, it was never like this. Kind of like you had these massive social media corporations where nowadays, instead of everyone having their own community websites or blogs or forums or even with chat rooms, you had Internet relay chats, which was like a distributed chat room system rather than just using things like Facebook messenger or MSN. And then in the mid 2000s, when there was like a whole spate of, there was quite a lot of vc funding for Web 2.0 type stuff, you had this pendulum swing from the decentralization of Internet services in the early 2000s, swang to a more centralized state with these massive corporations like Facebook and Twitter. But now we're having the pendulum swing back the other way, thanks to web three.
00:22:50.870 - 00:23:19.740, Speaker D: Of course, blockchains can help to solve this. And now you have more distributed social media platform blogging platforms like mirror and so on and so forth. So I think web three is kind of like a natural reaction to the centralization that has occurred in web two. And the pendulum is now swinging back in the other way to more decentralization and away from digital colonialism.
00:23:20.960 - 00:23:26.530, Speaker A: I want to shift topics, but before I do, Ethan, any comment on what Mustafa said?
00:23:27.060 - 00:23:28.752, Speaker C: Yeah, I fully agree.
00:23:28.806 - 00:23:33.488, Speaker B: I would just caution us to not take it for granted because we're going.
00:23:33.494 - 00:23:35.164, Speaker C: To see the same type of forces.
00:23:35.292 - 00:24:50.090, Speaker B: In Web three that are going to push for centralizing tendencies that we saw in the Internet. And in both cases, it's downstream of perverse venture capital incentives. So, not to poop on the vcs too much, but they're culpable for a lot of the issues here, just from the lack of foresight, I think in the sort of short term, I mean, it's funny because vcs are considered like long term thinkers, like disrupting industries, but I don't think they've really thought through the larger scale social consequences of those disruptions. And certainly web two has done a lot of damage and I think there's real risk of the same thing kind of happening. There's a bit of like a decentralization theater going on and we need to be careful that we don't get the same kinds of monopolistic winner take all kind of tendencies. And that's been a huge part of the drive behind Cosmos and the Cosmos mission and rejection of a singular rent seeking token that everyone has to use. Otherwise they can't access the value we're producing because we want to push back about that and we want to actually empower communities on their own terms.
00:24:50.090 - 00:25:00.396, Speaker B: That's a strange thing to sell as an investment thesis. But I'm not here to make people rich. We're here to change the.
00:25:00.578 - 00:25:08.640, Speaker A: Yeah, Mustafa, question for you. Why do you refer to blockchains as top level social contracts?
00:25:10.180 - 00:26:31.370, Speaker D: Yeah. So before blockchains, if you wanted to kind of have a shared contract or some kind of organization among a large group of people, let's say like hundreds or thousands of people, the only way you could really practically do that before blockchains is to start a company or organization or some kind of foundation or association under the law of a state or jurisdiction. Like for example, if you start a company in the US that's governed by corporate law and the state that you're incorporating it in, and then if you keep going up the stack, you have to ask, okay, what gives that organization authority? Who enforces the rules in that organization? Like every organization or company has a statues which govern the rules of that company or organization. And that company is given authority by the law. And where does the law get its authority from? It gets its authority from, for example, like parliament or congress. And where does parliament or Congress gets its authority from? Ultimately it gets authority. It's from the constitution or the people.
00:26:31.370 - 00:27:32.744, Speaker D: If people tomorrow, if everyone in the US or the UK or whatever country, for example, decided tomorrow that all of a sudden actually our elected officials no longer have authority and we're not going to follow the rules that they set, there's nothing you can do about that. That will happen. And that's happened before in the form of revolutions, for example. So in this case, in the context of a jurisdiction, a constitution of a country, or the social contract among its people are what I describe as a top level social contract. So, for example, you could say, like, in the context of a country, the top level social contract of a specific country is that Congress has authority or parliament has authority to set. People have to agree that people have to agree to that. Otherwise it doesn't mean anything.
00:27:32.744 - 00:28:54.436, Speaker D: Congress just creates pieces of paper. Those pieces of paper have meaning because people agree it has meaning. But blockchains, for the first time allow you to create decentralized, autonomous organizations or companies, organizations that for the first time can have rules enforced without relying on the social contracts of people in a nation state. Instead, because the rules on the blockchain are enforced by international computer network and enforced by cryptography and crypto economics, you can, for the first time in history, have a decentralized, autonomous organization and have some kind of economic or social contract with a large group of people without having that contract needing to be enforced by traditional law. What I mean by top level, these blockchains only have value because people agree it has value. The community of that blockchain has value. It's the same question as, like, what fork of Ethereum is the real fork? Which fork of ethereum gets the eth token ticker? If I fork Ethereum right now, if no one cares about my fork, then that's not the real Ethereum.
00:28:54.436 - 00:29:30.740, Speaker D: That's just my fork of Ethereum. So people agree that the current chain of ethereum or the current fork of Ethereum has value because people agree that the ETH token has value, or the transactions on that chain are the real transactions that have that value. And that is a top level social contract. The community of Ethereum agrees this is the correct chain. And this is what I mean by top level social contract. It's a social contract that does not derive its authority from any higher authority. It's a top level contract.
00:29:32.520 - 00:29:38.304, Speaker A: Ethan, any thoughts or reaction to this idea of blockchains being a top level social contract?
00:29:38.432 - 00:29:38.724, Speaker D: No.
00:29:38.762 - 00:29:57.292, Speaker C: I love it. I love this idea of an authority with no higher authority because it reeks of religious sentiment. And religion and higher authorities have played a huge role in organizing large groups of people.
00:29:57.346 - 00:30:12.480, Speaker B: This uniquely human thing we're talking about, it's a kind of binding agent. Religion, actually, the word religion comes from the word to bind. And blockchains are another kind of binding agent, right?
00:30:12.630 - 00:30:16.896, Speaker C: They bind us together in these kind of new ways that allow us to.
00:30:16.918 - 00:30:21.232, Speaker B: Collectively do things differently and to follow our own authority.
00:30:21.296 - 00:30:24.992, Speaker C: And that's the sort of heart of sovereignty.
00:30:25.056 - 00:30:28.288, Speaker B: Right. You're not bowing to any higher authority.
00:30:28.384 - 00:30:37.000, Speaker C: You're sovereign over yourself. You're bound together under your own terms. And the potential power of that is just incredible.
00:30:41.020 - 00:31:16.340, Speaker A: If I may, before we get a little into the technical part of the discussion, I want to get a bit. Sovereignty, why is it such a big deal for you guys personally? If you can go a little bit deeper and share, why it's like a personal matter. Ethan, we'll start with you. I know when I first talked to you some of the original stories of how you saw in high school, and that really stuck out to me. But the question is, why is sovereignty such a big deal for you personally? What's your response, Ethan?
00:31:17.960 - 00:31:59.972, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I don't have some personal story of oppression that I'm rallying back from. Therefore, sovereignty, it's a more, I guess, intellectual or emotional resonance with the concept, I think on a few fronts. One. So let's see, there's, let's say, a historical front for this, a current front for this, and then an intellectual front. So I'll cover all three. So the historical front, it looks to me like historically, humans have been sort of marching along this path of greater representation, which is another way of saying greater sovereignty for certain groups of people.
00:32:00.026 - 00:32:00.244, Speaker B: Right?
00:32:00.282 - 00:33:02.192, Speaker C: So moving from a world of empires towards a world of nation states was very much about groups of people being able to declare and satisfy their sovereignty as the nation of France or the nation of Germany, rather than being part of some larger empire or kingdom or so on. So I think there is a very real historical trajectory where at some point, the larger sovereign becomes. Fails to sufficiently represent the complexity of the underlying citizenry. And so the citizens demand some greater improved representation and more sovereignty over their own lives. It's not just coming down from on high. And I think we're on the cusp of another such transformation. The last one maybe started some 200 years ago when the sort of current nation states were really being formulated and the legal structures of national labor markets and corporations and all this stuff was sort of put down in the early mid, like, 19th century.
00:33:02.192 - 00:33:34.930, Speaker C: I think we're on the cusp of something similar. Except now, instead of defining the nation state, I think we're talking about defining network and city states. And I think the city state component of it is actually quite important because cities are where most people live, and we are local, biophysical human beings that need to get food delivered to our mouths. At least for now. You can't feed yourself in the metaverse yet. I can't tell if people are laughing at my stupid joke. So I feel a little bit awkward when I can't hear the audience, but I'll just laugh to myself and hope that covers for everyone.
00:33:34.930 - 00:34:13.512, Speaker C: I think that the city state, the sort of historical trajectory I think is really important. I see that as. As an evolution towards, you know, greater expression of sovereignty. So that's the sort of historical side, then, on the current side. You know, you just look around and you look at how little control people have over their lives and how little control communities have over their lives across the world. They're subject to all these unfair terms of pretty much dictated by large multinational corporations and governments that just plainly don't have their best interests at heart. And it just hurts to see that everywhere.
00:34:13.512 - 00:35:13.580, Speaker C: And so that I have this yearning desire to see communities be able to take more responsibility for themselves, and that means more sovereignty. And then lastly, there's an information theoretic, or you could call it a thermodynamic argument. This is sort of from my background in biophysics and trying to understand what does it mean to be a sustainable system in a universe that's always running down, right. So you have the second law of thermodynamics, your coffee cup cools, the glass breaks. Entropy is always increasing, so they say. And yet we have these emergent systems, human beings, life, organisms, ecosystems, forests that spring up and sustain themselves despite the fact that they're in this aggressive, destructive universe. And why is that? Why are they able to do that? And it has something to do with their ability to represent their environment locally and the signals that drive them in a local way and sort of encode within themselves, effectively, information about their world and about what's important to them, essentially.
00:35:13.580 - 00:35:47.260, Speaker C: Right. And so I sort of take that up to a more geopolitical kind of level, thinking about what does it mean or socioeconomic level, what does it mean for economies to be sustainable systems and to better represent the world and their social and biophysical reality internally in the economic structure. And that requires a greater degree of sovereignty so that you can have more local representation of the world. And so I actually see greater sovereignty as sort of key to the sustainability of the species and the planet.
00:35:49.120 - 00:35:53.390, Speaker A: Same question to Mustafa. Why is sovereignty such a personal matter?
00:35:55.280 - 00:37:16.330, Speaker D: Yeah, I wouldn't say I have some deep personal story of oppression either. Even though I was born in Iraq and I moved to the UK before the US invasion occurred. And when I was a teenager, 1516, I became involved with various hacking groups in hacktivism, and we hacked into various corporations and governmental organizations. And one of the organizations that we hacked, for example, was this us military contractor called HB Gray federal. And from the emails, we discovered that they had these contracts for the US government to do things like develop asterisk serving software to create lots of fake social media accounts and develop malware and stuff like that. So I kind of became aware very early stage of the lack of transparency and the power that these kind of large monolithic institutions have. Whether it's some large untransparent nation state or corporation, there's a lot of non transparent power that happens behind the scenes that can affect people, ordinary people, in a deep way.
00:37:16.330 - 00:38:30.560, Speaker D: And when we were hacking all these corporations and organizations, I was just a teenager and it's all public. I was arrested for it and stuff. And I was a teenager, but all I had, I was hacking into these organizations and all I had was a few hundred dollars laptop. So I kind of became aware that I was communicating to other hackers and people on these distributed online chat rooms. So then I kind of became aware of the power of grassroots movements or sovereign communities to be able to kind of organize against large institutions in a kind of like David versus Goliath way. They can kind of transcend the bell curve of power and kind of redistribute power back to themselves. And I think kind of crypto and blockchain very much embodies similar ideals because it allows people to transact and have relationships with each other without kind of being burdened by untrustworthy institutions or middlemen or third parties.
00:38:32.900 - 00:38:55.770, Speaker A: Shifting gears here, let's talk about tornado cash, recently sanctioned by the US government due to its privacy capabilities. The question that I want to ask is, where does the need for privacy with blockchains fit in, and how will it take place, given this precedent? And really, I just want to get your point of view on the whole situation. Ethan, we'll start with you.
00:38:57.420 - 00:39:23.456, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, this is a pretty dangerous situation here. They sanctioned a piece of code. There's a guy's in jail for writing open source code. I guess we still don't know all the details of that story, but it doesn't look good. Privacy is a human right. I mean, it's a pretty fundamental thing. And there's a free speech component of all of this that people are just.
00:39:23.456 - 00:40:10.384, Speaker C: You could print this code on a t shirt. You're going to arrest someone for making a t shirt with some letters on it? Our ancestors, so to speak, fought this war in the so called crypto war, and they won on the surface and the state sort of went behind everyone's back and went into the metadata and all this other surveillance technology, and it looks like we're going to have to fight this war again. But the privacy technology is absolutely critical, fundamental defense against just authoritarianism and oppression, and it's completely critical and it's a little bit of a shame that it's not more fundamentally built into our technology stack. I think with what's happening, there's going to be greater efforts to do that.
00:40:10.422 - 00:40:10.912, Speaker B: It's coming.
00:40:10.966 - 00:40:34.040, Speaker C: There's been huge evolution obviously, over the last few years in huge advancements in zero knowledge tech and there's much more mature libraries now and stuff. So I think we'll see it quite rapidly adopted into things. I think it is pretty critical that it does become sort of baseline default, privacy by default in all of these systems.
00:40:35.980 - 00:40:37.610, Speaker A: Mustafa, over to you.
00:40:38.940 - 00:41:14.630, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, it's definitely a shame that so far crypto has been kind of the opposite of privacy. It's a non private version of cash in a sense, and that's something that people need to take more seriously because it's definitely the case. Like privacy could limit sovereignty to some extent. If communities don't feel comfortable organized in a sovereign know, for example, a state could sanction them. For example.
00:41:21.680 - 00:41:32.048, Speaker A: Before I move on, any other thoughts on this, Ethan, as it relates to tornado cash, is there a message you want to get across around think the.
00:41:32.134 - 00:41:41.860, Speaker C: As far as I know, the coin center team is doing great work on actually going to bat for this one and challenging the sanctions on the address.
00:41:41.930 - 00:41:42.649, Speaker B: I don't know what they're going to.
00:41:42.649 - 00:41:45.792, Speaker C: Be able to do about arresting developers.
00:41:45.856 - 00:41:48.356, Speaker B: For open source code, but we do.
00:41:48.378 - 00:42:01.096, Speaker C: Need to push back against this. I don't exactly know how. I'm still sort of catching up on the state of this battle, but it's an important one and this is just.
00:42:01.118 - 00:42:02.810, Speaker B: The first shot fired, really.
00:42:04.300 - 00:42:06.652, Speaker C: This will be years, this fight.
00:42:06.706 - 00:42:07.548, Speaker B: So it's not just going to be.
00:42:07.554 - 00:42:42.424, Speaker C: About Tornado cash, but it's a much bigger challenge ahead. I mean, the IRS just hired, what, 87,000 enforcement agents and it's not like we're all here trying to evade taxes or something, but the state is going to throw everything they've got at this thing just to preserve their sovereignty in a sense, because they know it's being challenged from the bottom. I'd like to find ways to work with the existing states and gracefully deleverage them is the term I use so that we don't all have to go to war with each other.
00:42:42.462 - 00:42:42.900, Speaker B: Physically.
00:42:42.980 - 00:42:54.140, Speaker C: But, yeah, it's certainly dangerous, uncertain times. And so everyone needs to be extra careful and cautious, but we also need to defend these basic rights.
00:42:55.200 - 00:42:58.590, Speaker A: Mustafa, any final thoughts on tornado cash before we move on?
00:43:00.160 - 00:44:24.570, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, one other thing I would add is when people kind of learn about sovereignty, one kind of natural criticism of it is that, well, if anyone can create, any kind of group can self organize, then what if bad groups of people self organize? How do you deal with that? And I think my answer to that in general is, as I said, my kind of vision is groups of people should be able to self organize without being burdened by the status quo. Without the status quo part is important because it means that if people self organize, one group of people can't impose their status quo over someone else. So, like, for example, if a violent or terrorist group self organizes, for example, they should not be able to impose their status quo over someone else, because those people can also self organize or have their own sovereign community. My general philosophy is, the answer to oppression is not more oppression, but more liberty and technologies that liberate people.
00:44:26.620 - 00:44:39.100, Speaker A: Let's get a little technical for those folks that are just learning about sovereign blockchains. Ethan, can you tell us what the essence of a sovereign blockchain is and why it matters?
00:44:40.800 - 00:44:41.260, Speaker D: Sure.
00:44:41.330 - 00:45:03.952, Speaker C: I mean, it's the community computer, right? So it has the same relationship to Ethereum as your laptop does to the mainframe at the IBM headquarters. The crux of it is, the community that's building the application has end to end responsibility for the whole stack from the whole computing machinery.
00:45:04.016 - 00:45:04.244, Speaker B: Right?
00:45:04.282 - 00:45:36.636, Speaker C: So that means they assemble their own validator set, they run the consensus themselves. They have complete control end to end over the infrastructure and the application, and they're completely sovereign over it and over the terms on which they decide to interface and interconnect with all the other sovereign chains or other applications out there. So it's really just about complete control end to end of the stack and being able to customize it and use it to represent fully the values of that community without making any compromises that.
00:45:36.818 - 00:45:38.896, Speaker B: They don't actively want to make. Right?
00:45:38.918 - 00:45:42.096, Speaker C: So it's really about enabling a community.
00:45:42.198 - 00:45:43.936, Speaker B: To express their own values to the.
00:45:43.958 - 00:45:46.272, Speaker C: Fullest extent within both the infrastructure and.
00:45:46.326 - 00:45:48.230, Speaker B: Application that they're running.
00:45:49.400 - 00:45:54.900, Speaker A: Mustafa, what are sovereign roll ups? And how do they compare against sovereign l one chains?
00:45:56.840 - 00:46:46.180, Speaker D: Yeah. So a roll up is just a blockchain without its own valid asset. It's basically a roll up is just a blockchain that posts its blocks to a different blockchain and because it posts its block to a different blockchain, that other blockchain actually can order its blocks. And so that other blockchain gives it consensus over these blocks. And because of that, you can create your own chain without any validator set. Because instead of having to have a validator set to order the transactions, you just post the transactions or blocks to some data layer, like the Celestia. And that data layer will automatically order those blocks.
00:46:46.180 - 00:48:22.020, Speaker D: And it's sovereign because unlike Ethereum roll ups, where Ethereum roll ups are basically like baby chains or l two s to Ethereum, that kind of enshrine Ethereum as a settlement layer, there's a smart contract on Ethereum which defines what the roll up is. A sovereign roll up is not defined by the l one. Instead, a sovereign roll up is defined by the peer to peer network or the community of that roll up, not some smart contract on a layer one. It's just using the data layer as a data availability and consensus layer, not as an enshrined settlement layer. And so what this allows you to do is it allows you to create sovereign, independent blockchains without the overhead of having to bootstrap your own consensus network or validator set, as you would typically do if you were to deploy a cosmos. Now that does mean the main trade off there is you don't get sovereignty over the ordering of your transactions, necessarily, or blocks, depending if your roll up is a sequencer or not, but you still get full sovereignty over the actual rules of your roll up or community computer. And you also get this idea of shared security because your roll up is sharing or interrogating security from the celestial data layer.
00:48:24.600 - 00:48:42.040, Speaker A: Let's talk a bit about governance. So sovereign blockchains are about providing communities with autonomy to make decisions. Common forms of governance include token voting and off chain social consensus. What are the trade offs between them? And what are some of the other ways to set up governance around blockchains? Ethan, your thoughts?
00:48:43.040 - 00:48:50.780, Speaker C: Yeah, well, at the end of the day, off chain consensus always rules.
00:48:51.120 - 00:48:55.230, Speaker B: It is like we've been saying, the sort of highest authority in some sense.
00:48:57.360 - 00:49:03.948, Speaker C: And has a sort of power over the network that you can never really encode because at the end of the day, you know, you can pull cables.
00:49:03.964 - 00:49:05.776, Speaker B: Out of the wall and humans have.
00:49:05.798 - 00:49:28.536, Speaker C: To decide things for themselves. There is certainly within the blockchain space, a drive for some level of on chain governance minimization, which is positioned as a way to reduce the risk of capture, which is a very real, very concerning thing that we see in political systems all around us, where money can.
00:49:28.558 - 00:49:30.120, Speaker B: Just basically buy votes.
00:49:30.780 - 00:50:27.390, Speaker C: And that's a big concern, and that exists on chain as well. So obviously, bitcoin and ethereum have both resisted pretty heavily any kind of push to have on chain governance. They want to do it all completely off chain, which is very respectable and appropriate at certain levels. We've taken another approach, which is going back to these problems of sovereignty and representing stakeholders in the state machines that organize them, of giving more direct, say, representation within the state machine itself. So with on chain voting to the stakeholders in the base case, that's just the coin holders and what they have staked. And cosmos chains are somewhat famous in blockchain communities for having such active governance, turnout and participation, which is kind of amazing to see. So on the one hand, there are real risks of.
00:50:29.520 - 00:50:30.744, Speaker B: Being able to vote.
00:50:30.792 - 00:50:53.924, Speaker C: Just based on your stake. It doesn't necessarily make for the best form of governance. But on the other hand, there's a way for anyone in the community to really actively express and participate. And I think this is just sort of phase one of onchain governance. And there's a lot further to go in evolving, let's say, the stakeholder representation, because there are more stakeholders in the.
00:50:53.962 - 00:51:00.276, Speaker B: System than just represent by staked to.
00:51:00.298 - 00:51:20.248, Speaker C: A validator or whatever. And so I'm looking forward to seeing a lot more innovation in representation in the forms of voting used in setting up the houses or things like sort of optimism is doing. There's a lot of potential there, and obviously there's a long history of human societies exploring different governance procedures and voting.
00:51:20.264 - 00:51:21.164, Speaker B: Systems and so on.
00:51:21.202 - 00:51:26.430, Speaker C: And so I think we're sort of just beginning that in the blockchain space.
00:51:27.520 - 00:51:29.010, Speaker A: Mustasa your take?
00:51:30.180 - 00:52:42.484, Speaker D: Yeah, so I'll say this quote by David Clark, like an early Internet pioneer, which says we reject kings, presidents and voting, we believe in rough consensus and running code. And that's something that I very much kind of buy into. I think on chain governance by on chain voting is kind of okay from a practical perspective, for some technical parameters, things like maybe like the block size or block interval, but for kind of like more major architectural changes in the blockchain, it's better, to be fair to off chain governance. And we've seen this has worked relatively kind of well for ethereum. No one is opposing the Ethereum proof of stake upgrade, for example. And that's because since Ethereum was created almost less than ten years ago, it's always been part of the Ethereum roadmap that they will eventually drop proof of work and push to proof of stake. And so that's kind of always been part of the social consensus of Ethereum, that it was always going to switch to proof of stake.
00:52:42.484 - 00:52:54.860, Speaker D: And that's why now Ethereum is switching to proof of stake without any significant controversy or pushback. And it's a relatively non controversial hard fork.
00:52:57.040 - 00:53:20.100, Speaker A: One other technical question, and then we'll make our way towards the q and A. I got this question from John Charbo at Delphi. Can we compare and contrast sovereignty of a traditional l one, for example, a cosmo zone, to that of a sovereign roll up, including practical implications due to complexities around bridging introduced by sovereign roll ups? Ethan, your thoughts?
00:53:21.800 - 00:54:01.890, Speaker C: Yes, I haven't thought through in too much detail all the complexities of sovereign roll ups. I think Mustafa touched on a few of the trade offs. I think there's a lot of similarities. But essentially what a sovereign chain gives you is end to end integration of all of the pieces under one roof. Right. And with a sovereign roll up, you are outsourcing some aspects of it. In the case of celestia, you could say that data availability and consensus, and it may make sense to outsource that.
00:54:01.890 - 00:54:37.324, Speaker C: Maybe it's not clear today what the consequences of doing that might be. It's certainly going to be a lot easier to bootstrap and get your thing off the ground and potentially transition if you need it, to, let's say, end to end sovereignty of a chain. Further, I don't know what terminology to use to distinguish sovereign roll up from sovereign chain because I know people also like to say roll ups are just blockchains too. So we have to work on our terminology there. But maybe Mustafa has a more full answer here.
00:54:37.522 - 00:54:39.020, Speaker A: Go for Mustafa.
00:54:40.240 - 00:55:48.576, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, I think that there kind of like two sets of trade offs. The first of which, as we already said, a sovereign roll up does not have sovereignty over the transaction or block ordering. And so the implications of that, I think for most use cases, there's no implications because I think for most kind of sovereign chains, they're not really doing anything particular with sovereignty over their consensus. They rather need sovereignty over their state machine, which is what their actual community computer is. But for some use cases, which I think is not the norm, you might want to do something special in the consensus algorithm. For example, osmosis does this threshold encryption and decryption thing on a consensus level to prevent MeV. But I would say for most use cases, sovereignty over the state machine is kind of like the full sovereignty that they effectively need.
00:55:48.576 - 00:56:44.420, Speaker D: But the other trade off is with Selesia. It depends on how many validators you expect your chain to have. So the overall vision of celestia is to invade Internet of blockchains or cosmos with potentially millions of cosmos zones. If you have a world with millions of Cosmos zones, it's just not secure for all of those zones to have their own fragmented validator set. Imagine if a smaller community wanted to create a cosmos zone, and there's just like three or four validators. You can't really have secure IBC connections between chains because the validator sets are fragmented. If a customer zone has very few validators, that doesn't have much economic security, they can easily be taken over.
00:56:44.420 - 00:57:19.170, Speaker D: That doesn't give you much kind of economic security or secure bridging. But if those chains share a data availability layer like Celestia, then you can have shared security among those chains, because you don't need to rely on this committee or validator based assumption for bridging. Instead, you just need to rely on fraud proofs or ZK proofs to prove that the chain is correct, rather than assuming that a honest majority of that chain is correct, which might not be a sound assumption if that chain does not have a lot of economic value on it.
00:57:20.420 - 00:57:25.360, Speaker A: Before I ask my final question, Ethan, any final thoughts on this subject or this topic?
00:57:26.420 - 00:58:14.412, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that's all accurate. The only thing I'm starting to push for is reasoning more in terms of political economic security, rather than just economic security, which is probably a blasphemous thing to say somewhat. But I think it's important to the future that we think about these things not just entirely secured by pure economics, but there is a greater sort of human and political element of the security as well. That's very difficult to reason about, no doubt. I'm not sure how we would formalize it, but it's a direction I'd like to see the whole space move in a little bit. Especially when we're talking about. When we're talking about these smaller community computers, where there are these kinds of concerns.
00:58:14.412 - 00:58:43.000, Speaker C: And it could be that maybe it doesn't make sense, and the best thing for them is to use Celestia and a data availability layer. And that just sort of takes care of the problem in a kind of straightforward, kind of amazing way. But I would still push for people to expand just from pure economic reasoning to political reasoning, because it's there anyway, whether you like it or not, the politics of each chain actually matters to reasoning about the security in a way that's not just captured by the economics.
00:58:44.560 - 00:59:05.730, Speaker A: We are about to go into Q A, so if you're in the audience, please gather your questions. We will conclude with vision for the dialogue. Celestia and Cosmos, how are their visions similar? And then how are they dissimilar? Ethan, we'll start with.
00:59:07.060 - 01:00:05.392, Speaker C: I mean, I think they're extremely aligned projects. I mean, in some sense. So if you think about the core values of Cosmos were sovereignty and interoperability, and that basically boils down to app chains on the one hand and IBC on the other. And if you think about the end game for each of those two things, the end game for appchains is like, have billions of them and make it as easy as possible to launch them. And that's basically what Celestia is up to. And then the end game of IBC, at least one way I think about it, is be able to run tendermint itself over IBC, like IBC, be so powerful and generic and easy to use that you could actually implement a consensus protocol using IBC as the transport layer, which is something no one's really working on just yet, but we'd like to do in the future. So I think in some sense, Celestia is like a realization of the ultimate endgame of cosmos.
01:00:05.392 - 01:00:40.960, Speaker C: And actually, I don't know how well this is known, but one of the early iterations when we were iterating on Cosmos, we had this idea of what we were calling supertanker at the time, which is very similar to what Celestia is now, except we didn't have data availability proofs, so we didn't know how to solve that piece of the puzzle. And so we moved on to the Cosmos hub and spoke kind of architecture there. But certainly glad Celestia has come along and solved that big hole in the puzzle and is going to make app chains unbelievably easy to deploy.
01:00:41.540 - 01:00:48.550, Speaker A: Before we go to Mustafa, obviously, it seems like a lot of similarities, but any dissimilarities that come to mind?
01:00:49.320 - 01:01:43.524, Speaker C: Any dissimilarities? Well, I mean, there's obviously a difference in emphasis between the sovereign chain and the sovereign roll up, but the projects feel so aligned. I mean, Celestia is built using a lot of the cosmos stack and is really sort of pushing the cosmos vision to a new frontier. I think there's differences in roll ups and chains, but I think we very much acknowledge and respect both sort of sides of that. And Celestia itself, as a chain, is sort of a cosmos based chain. So I don't know if per se there are differences or if it's just like we're filling in together, we're filling in the spectrum of possibilities that neither team can sort of do alone, I guess, is maybe the way to frame it.
01:01:43.722 - 01:01:50.020, Speaker A: Mustafa, over to you. Finally, similarities and dissimilarities between the visions of cosmos and celestia.
01:01:50.680 - 01:02:46.360, Speaker D: Yeah, I think that's totally accurate. I don't really have much to add to that. I think the high level visions are similar. Yeah, I definitely see Sylvester as a kind of extension to fully realizing the cosmos vision rather than like, a juxtaposition to it. But as a result of extending that vision, there's some technical dissimilarities, and that mainly revolves around Celestia has less of a kind of reliance on trying to rely on committee based assumptions. For example, IBC relies on its majority of valley assets for secure bridging. At Celestia, we want to kind of try to eliminate as many committee based or honest majority assumptions as possible for the safety of the system, at minimum.
01:02:49.020 - 01:03:06.556, Speaker A: All right, we are now taking questions, so if you have a question, please raise your hand, and we'll go from there. So, our first question. Barton, I think you're connected. Go for it.
01:03:06.578 - 01:03:07.136, Speaker D: What's your.
01:03:07.238 - 01:03:39.290, Speaker E: I'm exploring the uses of IBC in critical infrastructure, specifically around smart grid and coordination in energy markets. And so there, too, is very sort of a political value pluralistic process. I was wondering, as one of the choices of communities, to have a private permission chain, let's say, under a threat model of sort of adversaries attacking your energy grid. Have you seen any applications of celestia or cosmos to where some chains are completely private and there are chains that sort of connect the public IBC to allow for exchange of value to take place?
01:03:45.260 - 01:04:27.316, Speaker C: Yeah, you can build a private chain. I believe in either case, on Celestia, you're just publishing the data, but you get the data availability. But maybe it's less relevant there than running a private sort of full chain. I think we've definitely seen a number of folks. I mean, we don't even know who's running them. We've heard a little bit about private chains for these kinds of applications, so it's certainly doable. The question, then, with IBC and connecting to the rest of the network is a little bit more hairy, depending on the assets and the kind of interactions.
01:04:27.348 - 01:04:28.456, Speaker B: You'Re expecting to have with the rest.
01:04:28.478 - 01:04:32.090, Speaker C: Of the network, but you'd really have to drill in on the use case.
01:04:33.900 - 01:04:43.564, Speaker D: By private here, do you mean privacy preserving or do you just mean like this essential sequencer permissioned and possibly having.
01:04:43.602 - 01:05:01.760, Speaker E: Sort of its own validator set that's specific to operation in the field, let's say sort of data availability happening close to renewable resources? Yeah, basically. The question also is there anything fundamental about permissionless or open chain for security purposes?
01:05:04.340 - 01:06:13.080, Speaker D: Yeah, I guess if it's a permission chain, it's kind of funny, right? Because I remember a few years ago there was this kind of big thing about IBM trying to do enterprise chains using hyperledger and for supply chain management and stuff like that. But in a lot of use cases, it's like, who are the validators? There's no natural choice of who these validators should be in a chain. So it's like you end up with like three validators or something run by three different people in those kind of use cases. Like a roll up with a centralized sequencer makes more sense, or a centralized set of sequences makes more sense if you're trying to do a permission chain where there's like some consortium or sequencer decides what gets included, but you still get the transparency and safety of a roll up because anyone can, because of the fact that the chain has database, anyone can audit it to see that the sequencer did its job correctly.
01:06:14.620 - 01:06:16.910, Speaker A: Thank you for that. A priori. Your turn.
01:06:18.000 - 01:07:04.730, Speaker F: Hey, thank you for having me on. Just curious how both Ethan and Mustafa think about incentivizing building applications that are not necessarily related to DeFi or NFTs. Just as we've seen with the general public, a lot of the shelling point for interest in cryptocurrencies is this financial component related to tokens. And there have been some restrictions with scalability into building social applications. But going forward, a lot of these scalability restrictions will be removed as bottlenecks. And so how do we think about incentivizing builders, creators, community members to start thinking about maybe social applications or other use cases for blockchains, aside from just deFi. And.
01:07:11.360 - 01:08:07.740, Speaker D: I mean, it's a difficult one because there's not that many successful non financial applications of blockchains yet. Like, like fundamentally, a lot of applications on blockchains are economic because that's what blockchains allow you to do. It allows you to create economic relationships to people because it doesn't allow you to kind of enforce physical kind of contracts yet. But I mean, I guess some use cases, I don't know if you would consider ens, for example, a defi application or not, but it's still financial to some extent because a domain name is an asset. So I could definitely see applications of blockchains that are based on assets, but not necessarily defi based. Domain names are an example of that. Or you could have reputation systems.
01:08:07.740 - 01:09:00.210, Speaker D: There's things like Gitcoin passport, for example, or proof of humanity, which are interesting systems that kind of allow you to do things like proof of personhood, kind of like alternative identity systems independent of the state. I guess those aren't financial. And more generally, I can definitely see blockchains being used for governance and not necessarily being financial. Like, if you have an association or organization, you could imagine the board meetings or the general meetings of the organization, the decisions being voted on transparently, on a verifiable ledger or a roll up chain, for example, rather than in an unverifiable way.
01:09:07.240 - 01:09:08.964, Speaker A: Actually. Go ahead, Ethan, go ahead.
01:09:09.082 - 01:09:44.396, Speaker C: Just go quickly. I mean, one way I think about blockchains is the sort of natural evolution of fault tolerant databases from the single stakeholder to the multi stakeholder domain. So going from a fault tolerant database run by a single entity to a fault tolerant database run by multiple entities. And then you're asking, what are the use cases of that? And ultimately they could be anything. Obviously, we're finding product market fit with finance. I believe that one of the pinnacles of multistakeholder applications is money itself. And that money is actually the killer app of blockchains.
01:09:44.396 - 01:10:26.190, Speaker C: But we haven't even begun to really do that. I mean, I think the monetary economics of blockchain people is still very repressed and the development has been arrested. So I think there's still a lot of work to do there. But I ultimately see it happening through working with cities. I mean, if we're serious about this sort of city state revolution and municipal sovereignty and things like that, I see cities adopt blockchains as sort of a major phase in its adoption curve in evolution, and using them to do more participatory budgeting with the citizens and governance related things, and ultimately issuing and managing their own currencies. So that's kind of the direction I'm pushing, at least.
01:10:27.120 - 01:10:28.510, Speaker A: Ron, your turn.
01:10:30.000 - 01:10:32.896, Speaker D: Well, guys, thank you for having me on. I just have a quick question.
01:10:32.998 - 01:10:34.028, Speaker F: I'm curious.
01:10:34.204 - 01:10:36.048, Speaker C: What kind of communities you believe are.
01:10:36.054 - 01:10:40.496, Speaker F: Going to be like the low hanging fruit for celestia that you think might.
01:10:40.518 - 01:12:26.624, Speaker D: Be the ideal targets? Yeah, so I think any kind of dao that's not necessarily a DeFi protocol could naturally use celestial. So, for example, there's various kind of like grassroots activism. Dows on Juicebox, there was like things like Constitution, Dow, or asalange Dow, for example, like Assange, Dow was a dow to kind of raise money for Julian Assange's legal campaign that raised 50 million. I think a lot of those dows could potentially be a better fit for celestia because it embodied this kind of grassroots, kind of sovereign activism ideals. But in the long term, it's kind of really hard to say what the mass adoption case or use cases could be because there's so many potential use cases even like, I also think things like gaming and nfts are a very natural fit for application specific roll ups, specifically solid roll ups, simply because gaming applications or gaming assets or nfts, they don't require a high frequency of compatibility with other smart contracts. Unlike DeFi, for example, you don't need like a single settlement layer to trade nfts, for example, unlike DeFi tokens, which have to interact with dexes and stuff like that. But in the long term, I just mentioned two potential use cases.
01:12:26.624 - 01:12:53.260, Speaker D: But in the long term, as I said, there's a variety of use cases. And in the long term, it could be the case that just like every kind of community or organization has its own slack server or discord server, it's possible that every community or organization has its own dao or roll up chain that kind of manages the members of the organization and tracks value and assets.
01:12:54.880 - 01:12:57.790, Speaker A: A few more questions and we'll wrap up. Steph, your turn.
01:12:58.880 - 01:13:51.484, Speaker G: Okay, I'll try to keep this quick because I have one question, and then it's kind of morphed as a conversation. I have a question, a statement. What do you see as the multiple? Or, I don't know, the easiest barriers to adoption? Or what is the friction? Right. Because cosmos isn't new, not that people don't use it, however, Celestia is new. And what I find a lot from the technical perspective, is that there's a lot of talk about what this unlocks. What are the possibilities? Right. However, the people as the end users and Facebook was one of the things that was talked about.
01:13:51.484 - 01:14:06.068, Speaker G: No one care. They know it's bad. Right. However, it's a lot easier to just sign in with Facebook. Sign in with Facebook. Give them all of my information. Now, do they own that then? Yeah.
01:14:06.068 - 01:15:01.520, Speaker G: However, it's still happening. Even you can sign in to Twitter with Facebook. Right. So what do you see from that side? And then I want to make a comment just on the colonialism and the land grab piece of it, which, yeah, that's a really touchy subject and probably why I don't get not able to talk in a lot of tech spaces because it's so uncomfortable to hear as the descendants of at least just slaves in America that it is a tough thing when we're talking about equating these two things as apples to apples, and it's really just not that, especially when we're talking about what are true evils. So that's my question in my statement.
01:15:01.600 - 01:15:04.948, Speaker D: So can you repeat your first question again if I don't sound.
01:15:05.034 - 01:15:32.480, Speaker G: Yeah, yes, it got lost in my statement. So the question is about the friction and the barriers to entry, because a lot of the, when the tech is presented, this is what it unlocks, right? Even the pictures are my chain, right. You can do this, it's modular blockchains. Right. However, once you say you grasp that concept, then people don't really care, they're still using Facebook.
01:15:33.380 - 01:16:47.800, Speaker D: Right? So I mean, from a purely kind of pragmatic perspective, you're right. The question is, why should I create my own chain? So far we've been kind of talking about the political or social political reasons why you might want to do that, but in the long term most developers might not care about that. So I kind of realized that you need a good practical reason for why that's useful. And in our case, we believe that if we make it as easy for people to deploy their own chain as it is to deploy a smart contract, then deploying your own chain will be a superior technical solution to creating a decentralized application, for subtle reasons, the biggest of which is scalability. When you have your own roll up, you're not sharing the same execution resources as other applications. So if you use Ethereum right now, you're sharing execution with every other application. And that's why gas fees are so high and that's why people have to move to roll ups.
01:16:47.800 - 01:17:50.350, Speaker D: Roll ups helped you to scale because you're basically sharding, you effectively have your own kind of chain with its own execution resources. The second thing is that the reason why sovereignty is interesting from a technical perspective is that it gives developers freedom over their own execution environment, and that fundamentally potentially allows them to create a better product, both from a developer user experience perspective and a scalability perspective. And it's just like most developers these days would rather create their own virtual machine on EC two rather than using some shared web hosting provider like Dreamhost for example. Because the EC two instance, you can install whatever you want on that, and sovereign roll up enables the same thing. So it's just a superior developer experience that allows you to create a better product.
01:17:52.000 - 01:17:54.428, Speaker A: Thanks. One final question.
01:17:54.514 - 01:17:55.150, Speaker D: Sorry.
01:17:57.120 - 01:17:58.636, Speaker C: Is that Mustafa or not?
01:17:58.738 - 01:18:00.270, Speaker D: Is that Mustafa? Yes.
01:18:02.000 - 01:18:03.212, Speaker A: Sorry, Ethan, go ahead.
01:18:03.266 - 01:18:06.432, Speaker C: Well, I just wanted to. I didn't catch the name of the previous question.
01:18:06.486 - 01:18:06.848, Speaker B: Ask her.
01:18:06.854 - 01:18:24.790, Speaker C: But there was a second part of the question, or there was a comment that. I just want to appreciate you sharing that because I know that it's difficult and I should be more careful with the language. So thanks for calling that out and not going to make any excuses. So I just want to thank you.
01:18:25.720 - 01:18:43.950, Speaker A: Okay, so we are near time here. We'll go to closing statements. Ethan, thank you so much for hopping on here and just giving us your point of view. Is there any parting wisdom message, anything that you want to share before we take off?
01:18:45.520 - 01:19:45.584, Speaker C: Yeah, just that this is the community computer revolution and what we do with it is on us. And let's not make the same mistakes that we made with personal computers and the Internet, especially where we ceded control to these megacorps that now dominate our lives. And so we have a chance to do this again and to re empower communities with technology, and we should be very cautious about that. It's very powerful stuff, and with great power comes great responsibility. So I think we need to be just careful about what we're doing and deliberate and not just rush ahead with things that sound fun or like they'll make us rich. But there's a lot at stake in this next generation of tech, and that's very exciting. But we need to think hard about it and just be careful and not move fast and break things, but maybe move slow and fix things kind of thing.
01:19:45.584 - 01:19:47.330, Speaker C: Yeah, so that's my message.
01:19:47.860 - 01:19:50.960, Speaker A: Mustafa, your closing remarks on the topic of sovereignty.
01:19:51.540 - 01:20:55.370, Speaker D: Yeah, I'll just end with the three values of modular blockchains, which is what we atst share building. The first value is that users are first class citizens of the network because they can run light clients, and these light clients, or nodes, they allow them to kind of participate in the network and help to directly contribute and validate the network and have a similar level of security to full nodes. And that kind of like shifts power away from the validators back to users. A second value is modularism and maximalism. This idea of these l one wars where every kind of like football clubs, where everyone is like a fan of specific l one, shilling the specific l one and saying it's better than the other one and being l one maxis, that's kind of like in the past. Modularism is better. People should just be able to choose what technology they want to use in their stack, and that's fine.
01:20:55.370 - 01:21:13.180, Speaker D: And finally, modular blockchains enable sovereign blockchains for sovereign communities by making it easier for the sovereign communities to create their own chains because they don't have to bootstrap their own consensus anymore.
01:21:14.480 - 01:21:19.500, Speaker A: There you have it. Ethan, thank you so much for joining. We'll see you offline, Mustafa, thanks for having me.
01:21:19.570 - 01:21:20.412, Speaker C: Thanks, guys.
01:21:20.546 - 01:21:20.890, Speaker A: Be well.
