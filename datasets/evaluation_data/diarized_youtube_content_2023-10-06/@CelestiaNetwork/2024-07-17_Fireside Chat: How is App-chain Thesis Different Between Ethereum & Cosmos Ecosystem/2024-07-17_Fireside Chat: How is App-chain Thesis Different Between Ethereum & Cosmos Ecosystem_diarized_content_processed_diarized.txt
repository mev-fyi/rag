00:00:01.880 - 00:00:25.050, Speaker A: So, yeah, so this panel, we're seeing application roll ups. You know, it's a Cambridge explosion of it on Ethereum. It sounds familiar, right? Wasn't there, like, an app chain thesis somewhere by some chain a while ago? So how's it going, though?
00:00:25.610 - 00:00:54.312, Speaker B: Well, we're hurting for liquidity, but it's going. But once we defund the dealers. Yeah, I mean, I think the. We're still seeing a lot of, like, the premier innovation happening on Cosmos chains. I mean, Celestia is built on Cosmos, penumbra, anoma. Got a lot of other, like, anywhere in DYDX, anywhere where you really need, like, you know, explosive power, and you want to enable application developers have as much control as possible over the consensus. The Cosmos stack enables.
00:00:54.312 - 00:01:05.940, Speaker B: That's still happening, but we'd love to see more integration and back and forth with the Ethereum community. I think we've both learned a lot from each other, and that's pushing the whole space forward.
00:01:09.080 - 00:01:42.974, Speaker C: Okay, I just. One more to go from here. I think the big difference in my head is what's being prioritized. I think at some state, this is all very convergent designs, but I think in Cosmos right now, one of our main focuses is, I was, like, decentralized consensus, or how you can get short term decentralized inclusion commitments or get your validators to do more to reduce reliability concerns. But lots of shared learnings, like, how do you get fast inclusion times with precomps and stuff? I don't know. Not sure where to go from. What's the prompt, Colton?
00:01:43.062 - 00:01:45.486, Speaker D: Yellow prompts again.
00:01:45.678 - 00:01:48.286, Speaker B: How's it going exactly?
00:01:48.358 - 00:02:03.306, Speaker D: I want to raise attention to the fact that we all have very appropriate names. I'm Vitalik, and, you know, like, I care about not dying. You're a dev. Name's Dev. You're an Ethereum adjacent person named Ethan, and you're. And you're Ken, next generation, and you have the, you know, there's the alternative thing. So.
00:02:03.306 - 00:02:05.710, Speaker D: Yeah. Okay, so what's the prompt again?
00:02:08.210 - 00:02:26.152, Speaker A: Well, the problem is that how can we learn from the app jing thesis, however it's going yesterday or, you know, right now? And what are some of the lessons? And what are some of the things that are distinct that we should.
00:02:26.336 - 00:03:26.462, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, I feel like there's, like, different use cases of, like, what a chain is, and, like, I think a lot of the time, like, not definitely far from all the time, but a significant fraction of the time, what people are looking for is, like, basically a branded shard. Right. And, like, a lot of, like, a like a lot of the time, you know, when I, when people tell me they want to, you know, like switch to doing their own, like, being on their own. L two, one of the, yet sometimes the reason is like, you know, they wants to have like some level of, like, you know, ethereum ecosystem wide neutrality. But a lot of the time the answer is just like, they don't want to be subjected to other people's gas spikes. And so, you know, they, yeah, like, they're fine with, like, having a, like, like, if ethereum did not have, like, that economic property or it did have some kind of like, fee market that was application by application, they would be totally fine. But that's a specific problem.
00:03:26.462 - 00:03:40.330, Speaker D: And so they're okay with just having a cookie cutter l two, that's exactly the same tech wise as 100 other l two s that are running the same software, they just want to have that guess independence.
00:03:43.630 - 00:03:58.386, Speaker C: I imagine at some scale for defi applications, they'll care about things like mev or decentralized inclusion. Like, I hope we dream of this world where it's not all centralized roll ups, where you have, like, one person gets rights over censoring people.
00:03:58.498 - 00:04:04.066, Speaker D: Do you prefer short term rights? Do you prefer l two decentralized sequencers or based roll ups?
00:04:04.258 - 00:04:33.030, Speaker C: L two decentralized sequencers. In my view, I think you want them to go faster. What's the minimum time you need for sharing data? One Internet global round trip for one person to one validator to tell everyone else something. So for your l one design, especially with ethereum, you don't want to prime price for that world, but you would like to give block data from many proposers that quickly, as quick as speed of light lets you.
00:04:38.850 - 00:04:39.590, Speaker B: Please.
00:04:40.370 - 00:05:13.456, Speaker E: Hello? Oh, my mic is dead. I can't talk. Oh, geez. Yeah, I guess for Uniswap, it's sort of just figuring out, or actually, sorry, let's walk back here. Uniswap is deployed on many l two s as well as Ethereum. There is no app chain Uniswap. But hypothetically, if we were to explore something, I think it's honestly just a battle of trade offs, right? Like, we love ethereum, obviously.
00:05:13.456 - 00:06:05.960, Speaker E: Like, you know, there's just so much lore behind Uniswap's just origin. Yeah, but there's like, the whole goal of making Uniswap, I guess, more useful is to make it easier on users and just, like, letting there be more composability. Obviously, security is top of mind. We want centers of resistance. We don't want anyone shut out from being able to use Uniswap and all facets of it. And we want to be able to have full modularity. We want people to be able to have interop, have composability, and all plug into what, I guess, north star of fully what Uniswap can accomplish unburdened by what has been.
00:06:07.500 - 00:06:08.108, Speaker D: Thank you.
00:06:08.164 - 00:06:09.240, Speaker E: Thank you for laughing.
00:06:12.700 - 00:06:28.802, Speaker C: So what's the concern of being your own app chain? I shouldn't follow this. What's the downside? You can get security via Ethereum, via restaking or. Yeah, so I actually didn't follow. What was the concern side?
00:06:28.946 - 00:07:14.160, Speaker E: Well, it's not really concerned. It's just like, I think everything that we, you know, if we were to explore this, right, everything would come with its own trade offs. Right. We're either breaking modularity, breaking sensor resistance, or I guess, hopefully not ever in terms of decentralization, but also, like, what are we actually doing for users, right. So, like, for us, it's really thinking about how we're creating the best surface area for access for all users. And I think that's a really tough thing to say because I'm using this magic wand of just, like, all users being, like, every person in the world. But realistically, that's not, you know, we're not actually, you know, we can't actually touch everyone in the world, but we can try, and it's really tough to do that when you do have these, like, sort of, like, pockets of, I guess, app chain choices.
00:07:14.160 - 00:07:27.200, Speaker E: Yeah, and I guess, like, we just, like, have not made a decision. We're thinking and we're exploring, but it's all like a research question of, like, how do we actually do it in the best way that's most meaningful and most impactful for our users?
00:07:28.300 - 00:07:34.132, Speaker B: But how do you feel that app chain fragmentation is distinct from l two? Fragmentation from the user's perspective?
00:07:34.316 - 00:08:11.144, Speaker E: Yeah. So I guess that's a really good question. There already exists so much static friction on how users are going to onboard to l two s that I guess we're. If we were to think about Cosmos, it would be kind of like, how do we now make a hard write and shift and do it? And you've seen this with Dydx and you've seen this with others. And again, no disrespect, love these guys, but it is way harder to recreate that mode to get the activation energy to move everyone over, to have these users and to have composability. Maybe Dydx doesn't need composability. The same way that Uniswap does.
00:08:11.144 - 00:08:28.850, Speaker E: But a lot of what makes Uniswap so special and so powerful is being able to tap into everything else, is being able to use the liquidity for everything else on Ethereum, and being able to leverage all of the assets, the users, and the order flow for order flow concerns.
00:08:28.890 - 00:09:14.410, Speaker C: If it's from the Uniswap UI, it seems like the end state is going to be. You place a intent on something on chain from wherever the user is, and then someone competes to fill it as quickly as possible, and more so than. And then you have some challenge period equipment times. Yeah, I don't see how an app change differs here. If you have somewhere to sequence all intents really quickly to make a decentralized competition to fill before whatever l two they're on confirms, or maybe, sorry, step back. I actually don't see how user fragmentation is changing. If there's an app train to coordinate versus, you want some coordination layer that's very fast and decentralized inclusion.
00:09:14.410 - 00:09:22.260, Speaker C: It doesn't matter if one roll up gives that to you if you weren't worried about block space. Otherwise you can have your app chain do this.
00:09:22.640 - 00:09:57.080, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I had an experience recently, which I think is worth plugging here, when I bought a NFT on stargaze using atoms that were on the Cosmos hub. And so with one transaction from the Stargaze front end, I signed one time, it took my atoms from the Cosmos hub, transferred them to osmosis, swapped them for stars, sent them over back to stargaze and bought the NFT. So that's like multiple chains, multiple actions, multiple applications, all in one transaction sign. So the user doesn't have to care. They happen to have assets somewhere. But it was just like, nice. I mean, if you haven't tried this, I really recommend you should.
00:09:57.080 - 00:10:13.290, Speaker B: This is what can be the user experience. So it feels like whether it's kind of l two or an app chain, we can solve that kind of problem with, like you were saying, like the right, you know, simple front end for the user, and then what's happening under the hood they shouldn't have to be exposed to.
00:10:16.310 - 00:10:17.262, Speaker D: No, no.
00:10:17.326 - 00:10:32.446, Speaker E: Okay, the mic is dead again, so I can't respond. Kidding. Okay, all right, here. All right, so, okay, so there's two different things here, right? You're talking about the user experience. You're talking about actually liquidity. Those are two different things.
00:10:32.478 - 00:10:32.598, Speaker D: Right?
00:10:32.614 - 00:10:49.380, Speaker E: Because you're saying that. You're saying that for the front end flow, everything is kind of moving off chain, which is kind of like the panel right before this is what I kind of poked Vitalik and Asgar about. Right? Liquidity moves off chain, which means that it's no longer, like on any chains. It's private market makers being able to fill that. That is a different fundamental issue.
00:10:51.600 - 00:10:53.024, Speaker C: Okay. Actually, do you think that's fundamental?
00:10:53.072 - 00:10:54.424, Speaker E: I actually would guess I do think so.
00:10:54.512 - 00:10:55.180, Speaker C: Hmm.
00:10:55.720 - 00:11:37.472, Speaker E: Because, like, right now, liquidity, there's a lot of liquidity that exists on chain. And what you're saying right now is like, if you're feeling intense, then you're letting people kind of fill orders from anywhere, right? It can be on chain, it can be off chain. And I will sort of caveat all of this by saying that Uniswap X is only like a very small subset of the giant market share that makes up defi and even uniswap transactions. But again, liquidity moving off chain is inherently sort of something that can be applicable for cosmos chains as well for app chains. And so it does kind of allow us to kind of plug back into this. And I guess I'm not saying that, like, you know, we're committed to one or the other. I think, like, I'm just saying that there are trade offs here.
00:11:37.472 - 00:11:47.860, Speaker E: And I, like, honestly shout out to, like, Barry from. From skip. Like, I've learned so much about, like, what's happening on osmosis. It's like lp back running stuff, decentralized block building. It's like, it's fucking sick.
00:11:48.280 - 00:12:20.482, Speaker C: Thanks, I guess. I don't. Do you want to talk about the liquidity? Is liquidity going off chain? Because this one actually feels surprising to me. I feel like you'd get similar to centralized exchanges. You have some order book already there. And why do you post early? Because you have a first in, first out mechanism of people who post things that the market can parameterize off of get to be executed first. So you get this advantage for revealing what your preference is earlier on, and so you want somewhere to coordinate that.
00:12:20.482 - 00:12:59.930, Speaker C: The reason I was saying, what I was mentioning with intents was more so that suppose you have one place for people to coordinate whatever they want to be publicly visible, then you can have intents that are param tries such that you will get at least as good of a price as, say, dex app chain. Or the intent gives you filler gives you a better price. But if it's not as if your price you get is worse, then it would fall back to you. Oracle into what is a Dex chain, and any intent filler has to Oracle into what the dex chain would give you, or they could just give you that price by doing the swap there.
00:13:00.390 - 00:13:18.200, Speaker E: But also. Or I could be on a base roll up and tap into aave some aave vaults and be able to leverage long my position on optimism, or, sorry, on a base roll up where I'm able to use my lp in a more capital efficient way. Like, these are all trade offs and I just kind of throw it out there.
00:13:18.240 - 00:13:33.940, Speaker C: Yeah, true, true. And the base roll ups, you had to. Yeah, the only downside to base roll up is just what is l one block time and b market for DA. Any. You have to coordinate on that. Or I guess, also, what is the inclusion trade off? Like, what's your inclusion guarantees you can give users?
00:13:35.920 - 00:14:15.890, Speaker A: Yeah, so I think we clearly immediately fell down the rabbit hole of like, you know, two dexs who kind of care about similar things, like intents and then how that's executed. But our Ethan and Vitalik seems bored. So, I mean, I think one of the main differences between the two ecosystem is the sovereignty aspect of application specific. Well, let's set aside whatever sovereignty means, but like, application specific kind of chains do have their benefit. But what's the downside?
00:14:20.910 - 00:15:07.670, Speaker D: I mean, I think a lot of it depends on what level of application specific this you go. Right? Cause if you have a branded shard, then basically the only downside is you lose synchronous composability. And in the short term, you also get a bunch of other UX annoyances that are basically temporary because the wallets still haven't implemented very basic stuff like making the chain ID part of the address. But that's just a UX problem that is going to get solved in the limit. Basically. Secret is composability, I think is the only thing that you give up the Async. I mean, it doesn't even need to be, it could even be faster than ethereum speed.
00:15:07.670 - 00:16:04.030, Speaker D: Async. It can be speed at the order of what happens within some of these sub ecosystems. If you try going more application specific in the sense of give up the evm and make application specific logic and so on, then you lose more because you lose access to things like, like ether scan and like a whole bunch of like, testing and like, understanding the chain infrastructure, you might have to like figure out a custom, like, line if you want people to trustlessly, like access to chain and so on and so forth. And then at some point, like, if you decide to like, change the cryptography, then you know, like, obviously, yeah, you lose eoas, though. Like, I'm all in favor of, like, you losing ways of accelerating the transition to smart contract wallets. Yeah. Like, I view it as a concentric circle thing.
00:16:04.030 - 00:16:21.490, Speaker D: Right. It's like, basically, how serious are you actually taking the be your own chain thing? Right. And, like, there's, like, an entire spectrum from, like, basically. Yeah. You know, like, being a branded chart. So, like, basically just, like, having a server that, like, publishes Merkel roots to ethereum and what's proofs once in a while.
00:16:23.960 - 00:16:55.306, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's right. I mean, the main downside of having application specific chains that they don't necessarily compose and they might have different tools and different infrastructure. In cosmos, we've tried to build a lot of the pieces so that you can use the same tools to access many different chains. Like Mintscan, for instance, can access pretty much all the chains, but some of them are building their own application specific state machines. And so that starts to get more challenging. You know, we make a big talk, big talk about, like, application specific chains, but then a lot of them start to add virtual machines to them. Right.
00:16:55.306 - 00:17:30.440, Speaker B: And so then the service area starts to increase again. But I think ultimately it comes down to that expression of sovereignty and having communities focus on specific cultures and building the network that makes the most sense for them. Vitalik wrote a post about this not that long ago about l two s as cultural extensions of Ethereum and allowing the sort of cultural innovation to happen on different l two s. That was sort of the thing cosmos was all about. Kind of from the beginning, is that expression of sovereignty, but also with interoperability baked in, whereas on the Ethereum side, you have this, like, kind of alignment baked in. You know, they're. They're cultural, you know, sub expressions of the Ethereum ethos.
00:17:30.440 - 00:18:21.150, Speaker B: And maybe arguably one of the downsides in the cosmos ecosystem is that that overemphasis on sovereignty can lead to, you know, fragmentation and sort of like, more infighting to some extent. And so that's something we're trying to address a little bit by bringing people back together around the Cosmos hub, making the hub the best place to launch a chain. But there's still a lot of very powerful ecosystems, independent ecosystems built that don't necessarily emphasize the cosmos branding. You've got Barachain and DyDX, and even Polygon actually has Cosmos tech under the hood, but you might not know it. Probably a lot of Ethereum roll ups would benefit tremendously from adopting the cosmos stack, from adopting Comet, BFT and IBC and so on. Sometimes I feel like a lot of the ecosystem's best ideas come from Cosmos, and all of our cryptography comes from Ethereum. So there's a good.
00:18:21.150 - 00:18:22.778, Speaker B: Yeah, good.
00:18:22.874 - 00:18:33.522, Speaker A: But I mean, that's a cross pollination. I mean, like, I think everyone, like a lot of everyone appreciates, I think, the great products and, you know, especially SDK, you know, everyone uses it.
00:18:33.546 - 00:18:33.754, Speaker C: Right.
00:18:33.802 - 00:18:44.422, Speaker A: But the thing is, like, do you not feel like you need to accrue something? Like, you know, is it not painful to kind of look at the hub or, like, you know, look at the Adam wanting to do more?
00:18:44.566 - 00:18:59.254, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, there's an irony here in that, like, the sovereignty, you know, so, you know, Vitalik mentioned, like, not having. Not being subject to other people's gas prices. Right. We kind of took it further. It's like, we don't want to enforce any political economic constraint on you. Right. It's just technology.
00:18:59.254 - 00:19:10.332, Speaker B: You'll be interoperable. You can build your own thing. Right. And so that attracted a lot of people because it sort of made it. Made it their own. They could, you know, brand, however. But it also has arguably led to these issues of fragmentation.
00:19:10.332 - 00:19:47.080, Speaker B: Part of how we're correcting that now is leading this reconvergence around the hubs and number of chains coming back to the hub and thinking about how to actually launch or adopt the hubs validator set. Part of the thing about the hub is it didn't really have a development team for five years. There's history that's important to this as well, that we don't really have to get into. But there's trade offs in sovereignty. I think sovereignty is expensive, and Cosmos chains have been reckoning with that as well. But we'll probably see similar. We'll see similar struggles emerge among l two s to some extent, but having the aligned base layer, having the aligned eth token has obviously been incredibly valuable for the ethereum ecosystem.
00:19:47.080 - 00:19:51.860, Speaker B: And, yeah, it's something maybe we wish we had more of in cosmos.
00:19:52.680 - 00:20:58.842, Speaker C: Something I think is interesting here, though, is I think l two s and app chains are roughly the same problem, but l two s are branded as ethereum focused. I think fast forward a few years, you'll start having in Cosmos, we're thinking about how do you make cross chain standards to have one chain's cultural policies benefit everyone else if one chain cares about censorship, resistance? Let's make a bridge standard on IBC to make both osmosis and the hub boost each other's sensor persistence by updating IPC. I think we'll start getting something similar in roll ups or the l two space. Eventually, once it's not roll ups mean da post to Ethereum, DA posted to maybe a couple layers and it's like a full node property of what they care about. But you can start getting more. Yeah, just more cross roll up properties for across l two properties for losing each other's guarantees. Mesh security is a thing in cosmos that's similar to eigen layer restaking, but not focused on just using ETH as a restaking token, but having each of these chains restake on each other but also make in protocol limits.
00:20:58.842 - 00:21:51.250, Speaker C: So like osmosis can have some bounded relation with the hub of where we want. Like maybe 20% security shared and independently have 20% of security come from up to 20% come from Ethereum restaking. And I think there's many posts on the topic of how restaking affects the base layer. But now by putting this in protocol in Cosmos stack, we can start not stacked just like how people think about it. We can start having protocols reason about to what extent they want to overlap with other chains or other ecosystems and get all the benefits. Or better explore the trade off space between how tied they are to any other one chain and also be tied to many other ones. Imagine optimism and arbitrary app chains being dependent on each other like two apps just share a lot of users and stuff.
00:21:53.830 - 00:21:54.862, Speaker B: You're being censored.
00:21:54.966 - 00:22:17.200, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. Okay. I think we're okay. Last question again, this is to the two of you. So when you launch a chain, when do you tell someone else to launch something on you, and when do you just tell them to use your actual application?
00:22:18.540 - 00:22:46.530, Speaker B: I usually tell people to start simple, like with a smart contract on Ethereum. And once they find product market fit, or if they need a more advanced control over the consensus or the MEV prevention or the gas or whatever, they can move off either to a roll up or to a cosmos chain. I think the path DydX took is maybe archetypal of how this should go. A smart contract, if you hit limits, you move onto a roll up. If you hit limits, you move onto your own software and app chain.
00:22:47.950 - 00:23:04.478, Speaker C: I agree with this. I think that start as a contract where it's easier to deploy and closest to the people you think would be your users, and then scale up to having more complex bridge protocols or async composability with other, maybe more specific.
00:23:04.534 - 00:23:13.720, Speaker A: The question is, do you try to lock them in through into your own ecosystem? As an app chain.
00:23:15.700 - 00:24:01.840, Speaker C: I think app chains try to offer protocols building on them something convenient, maybe dev UX things of osmosis offers you some compelling things as a base layer, like validators provide oracles for you in a very reliable manner or mev resistance or something thing. But I think the lock in, there's no intention of locking them in. I think everyone should feel like they can. Once you are big enough, you should become your own app chain I think is the ultimate. It depends what you're doing. But if your base layers can't scale for you or don't meet your own needs, then yeah, I think the eventuality is you become your own app chain. Or if your community grows big enough and you have some community values that you want to enforce, take a more sovereign stance.
00:24:01.840 - 00:24:10.560, Speaker C: If you care about geo distribution, make a chain that lets you enforce your geo distribution preferences.
00:24:11.380 - 00:24:15.692, Speaker D: Or sometimes make a thing that's not a chain. So like the forecast or CRDT.
00:24:15.796 - 00:24:19.920, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. We don't need blockchains for most of the very cool things, very cool impacts we want.
00:24:21.140 - 00:24:27.100, Speaker A: Well said. All right. On that note, thank you for a great panel. And Vitalik, you're up next.
