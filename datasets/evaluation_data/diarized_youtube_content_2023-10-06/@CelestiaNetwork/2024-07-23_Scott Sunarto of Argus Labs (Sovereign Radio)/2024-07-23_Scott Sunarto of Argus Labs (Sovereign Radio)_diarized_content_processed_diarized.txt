00:00:00.600 - 00:00:16.686, Speaker A: Welcome to the second annual sovereign radio show. I'm your host, Django Unchained. I'm here with Scott Sunarto, who is the founder of Argus Labs, and we're going to learn about his gaming project. Welcome to the show.
00:00:16.798 - 00:01:06.170, Speaker B: Thanks for having me. So, yeah, my name is Scott. I'm the founder and CEO of Argus Labs. We are a game publisher focusing on filian chin games, and we're also building a roll up framework called the World engine that allows you to create a sharded roll up that is specifically designed for fully on chain games, giving you ability to horizontally scale your fully on chain games to tens of thousands of players and also having low latencies for real time combat attractions and so on and so forth. We're building on top of the modular stack, we build our own execution layer, which is a game of charts. And we're also using Celestia as data availability layer to provide data availability for transaction data for all of our on chain game transactions.
00:01:06.550 - 00:01:21.062, Speaker A: Awesome. So we're here at modular Summit and you're going to give a talk about your world engine and as well as reveal your game. So tell us about that. Are you excited?
00:01:21.166 - 00:01:58.220, Speaker B: Yeah, a lot of things to kind of like talk about here. We've been like working on a world engine for the past year. On December 2023, we launched the first game built on the world engine called Dark Frontier, where it's the first fully on chain space mmorts game built on top of the world engine. We ran it for a week. We had 700,000 transactions within that short span of the week with players ranging from every continent and all across the globe. That was extremely exciting for us. Now we've continued building with the world engine and it's now available for every game developers to be building on.
00:01:58.220 - 00:02:13.400, Speaker B: And we're super excited to be unveiling all the innovations that we've been working hard at work at and also showcasing those new capabilities through our latest game called Block Survivor, that we'll be launching during modular Summit.
00:02:14.700 - 00:02:17.080, Speaker A: Is your background in gaming?
00:02:17.780 - 00:02:51.376, Speaker B: I got into games in a very interesting path, so I actually got into programming in general through video games. I used to be a big Minecraft player, and by playing Minecraft I ended up creating my own Minecraft mods and all of that, and basically using Java to add new features to game, et cetera. That's how I got into programming as a rabbit hole. I've never really taught that I would be in the game industry. I've always liked programming. I know I want to be a software engineer. But fast forward to 2020.
00:02:51.376 - 00:03:37.136, Speaker B: When I was in college, me and my friends co created a game called Dark Forest, which ended up becoming the first fully on chain game. And it become super popular and have many players like Dylan Field, who's the CEO of Figma, playing it. And that's how I got into this very weird rabbit hole of video game development. And from that experience, I actually learned a lot about the hurdles that exist if you want to build a fully on chain game. As you already know, blockchains were never really designed for fully onchained games. It's like started with bitcoin, which are really thought about as cryptocurrencies for payments, et cetera. When ethereum came about, gaming wasn't really thought about as a use case as much.
00:03:37.136 - 00:04:47.040, Speaker B: It's really thought about for maybe exchanges, Defi and so on and so forth. So the moment when we created Dark Forest, where it's fully on chain, a lot of people were like, hey, are you seriously trying to run the game fully on chain? Are you sure the blockchain are able to handle it and all of that? And what we learned from there is actually the blockchain struggles when you actually try to run a fully on chain game on top of it. From a lot of the learnings from building Dark Forest, I decided to build the world engine to build a blockchain that is designed from the ground up for running fully on chain games. Not for Defi, not to be this be all n all blockchain for everything, but only to focus on serving gaming applications. Gaming is actually a very interesting vertical because game applications doesn't generalize as well as the other applications that you might see in the market. This is why if you're trying to build a new game, let's say, not even a crypto game, you need a dedicated game engine. You don't need a dedicated engine for, let's say, an e commerce website.
00:04:47.040 - 00:05:31.600, Speaker B: You don't need a dedicated engine for, let's say, building B, two B SaaS app. But people use game engines to build games because it's such a different form of applications. And blockchains, for example, in this case, also isn't compatible for running games on top of it. And so we actually had to redesign a blockchain from the bottom up to service the performance intensive requirements of a fully on chain game. That's basically how I got into this very weird rabbit hole. A lot of experimentations. But yeah, I think that's like kind of like a very fun journey and like, you know, we're very excited, of course, to like, get more people like nerds knife and build fully onion games.
00:05:32.180 - 00:05:50.780, Speaker A: Excellent. Well, you're definitely nerd sniping me right now. So there's this. There were many tweets that have gone viral showcasing game an on chain game, purely on chain game gameplay, where. And the joke is that every time he tries to make a move, Metamask pops up. Metamask. Right.
00:05:50.780 - 00:05:58.538, Speaker A: And it's just like untenable. So tell me about the gameplay that you expect on Argus.
00:05:58.594 - 00:06:30.170, Speaker B: Yeah, like, funnily enough, when we were building fully on chain games back in 2020, that was unironically the user experience. You have Metamask pop ups at every, like, basically every time you make any moves in the game. And that's like what we had to deal with. Right. But of course, like, we learned from that experience. And like, now we could have like, you know, games that have real time combat, like you have people shooting each other. And again, these fast paced action games, you could do that seamlessly to the point that it's indistinguishable from a web two game.
00:06:30.170 - 00:07:43.938, Speaker B: That has been our goal from the very beginning with the world engine, is to make not only the user experience as seamless, as indistinguishable with web two games, but also to make the developer experience indistinguishable from web two games, too. And even we want to make it even easier than what people would have been able to do with these web two game server engine. I think we have been able to reach that point. When we were building these games internally that we're about to launch, we actually realized that we were able to implement that game faster using the world engine than if we were to use traditional game server framework that is available out there. Those game server framework would cost us a lot of money if we were to use that for world engine with the spirit of open source or blockchain, made it available for everyone to use. I think there's a lot of really great strides that have been made to actually make fully on chain games much more accessible, not only from the player's perspective, but also from the developer's perspective, which I think is kind of like somewhat of a chicken and egg problem.
00:07:44.074 - 00:08:24.370, Speaker A: Right. There's a bit of a conflicting interests there. And so just to provide a little bit of context for the audience, your on chain gaming worldview is sort of this maxi worldview of let's put everything on chain and let's. I want that to be the goal and let's figure out the design that's going to enable this. And that's very different from the worldview of many other web3 game developers where they say, okay, that's not tenable, we're just going to put, you know, like we're just going to use the blockchain for the NFT marketplace or like, you know, gaming artifacts.
00:08:24.410 - 00:08:24.794, Speaker B: Yep.
00:08:24.882 - 00:08:31.130, Speaker A: So how did you implement the world engine to enable fully on chain games?
00:08:31.250 - 00:09:11.650, Speaker B: Yeah, so that's a very great question. So the answer here is really to again build a blockchain from the bottom up that has optimizations that allows the level of performance that you would expect from game server. Existing blockchains have 1 second, two second block time. Ethereum have 15 2nd block times. If you play a game and then you make a move and response in 15 seconds, nobody would want to play that game. That's completely unplayable. So we had to build a really fast blockchain from scratch to be able to support sub 100 millisecond user interaction.
00:09:11.650 - 00:10:07.522, Speaker B: And that allows us to basically make all of this possible and scalable. And one non obvious insight that we have from building these blockchain is that building a blockchain for one single purpose or one specific category actually allows us to achieve optimizations that a general purpose blockchains are not able to do, which gives us superpowers and ability for us to be more performant than our general purpose alternatives. That is basically the key insights there. We are able to make data access optimizations that are specifically designed to rewards how a game would access their game state. That gives us a lot of performance boost. That again, a general purpose blockchain, a generic EVM chain wouldn't really be able to. And that is really one of the key secret sauce.
00:10:07.522 - 00:11:14.990, Speaker B: On top of that, we also have the sharding system which allows us to horizontally scale a chain to have multiple rooms, so to speak. So you're playing let's say a dota two or you play some sort of online game. It's very common for you to have the concept of rooms where you divide up the players into different servers, federated to fediverse. Yeah, different regions, and distribute the load essentially. That is extremely important for any consumer applications because you want to make sure when your game became very popular and people want to play with their friends, you don't refuse people because, oh sorry, the blockchain is full, we can't accept them because that would turn away all these players from playing these fully on chain games. That was basically the two things that we focus on in making that possible? The first one is just basically building a blockchain that is high performance, optimized specifically for games. And two, innovating on roll up architecture by implementing execution sharding, which is one of our key main research topics within the company.
00:11:14.990 - 00:11:16.010, Speaker B: That's interesting.
00:11:17.150 - 00:11:37.234, Speaker A: Am I visualizing it correctly? That you're able to seamlessly spin up sovereign roll ups, or shards, as you call it, as needed? And each roll up is basically a dedicated federated server, so to speak, for a dedicated instance of a game.
00:11:37.362 - 00:12:15.202, Speaker B: Yep. So the way that you can use shards are like, you know, again, like, it's like a tool in the toolbox, right? So there's like very, very many different ways that you can use it. One of the examples here is like, for example, if you're playing a game like, you know, let's say counter strike, you can have, like each match, have like ten players in the same room, and so you can use each shard to contain each of these ten player match. That's one way of doing it. Another way of using shards, which I think is very, very interesting, is when, let's say you have one really big giant world. So let's say you're playing a game like an MMORPG. Yeah, like an MMORPG, right? Yeah.
00:12:15.202 - 00:12:30.096, Speaker B: World of Warcraft, like Ultima Online and so on and so forth. With those kind of games, like what you can use, you can divide up the map into smaller chunks or smaller pieces and like, assign different chunks or different regions into different shards.
00:12:30.168 - 00:12:47.208, Speaker A: That's exactly how ultimate online was built. Right? That was how it was designed in that if you're in a certain part of the world, you're almost geographically isolated from another part of the world who is playing a completely different instance of the game. And that's their federated server model.
00:12:47.264 - 00:12:47.968, Speaker B: Yep, yep.
00:12:48.024 - 00:12:58.926, Speaker A: And interesting that you're using shards in the word shard in the exact way that the etymology started, right, which is sharding in ultra online.
00:12:58.998 - 00:13:24.702, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, that is correct. So, like, the term sharding is actually now used beyond gaming as well, right? It's like used like now with databases, even like Ethereum. Like, you know, it has the concept of sharding too, and all of that. But funnily enough, it actually started from Ultima online. So, like. So, yeah, like, a lot of our server architecture is. Our, like, blockchain architecture is inspired by some of the largest game server architecture out there.
00:13:24.702 - 00:14:42.620, Speaker B: So these massively multiplayer online games like Ultima, World of Warcraft. So what we do here is basically take the learnings that we have from these large scale game server architectures and bring that into a fully on chain context. This is one of those examples where basically the magic of blockchain really meets the, the bleeding edge of really distributed systems engineering. By doing that, I think we have these best of both worlds where you have all the powers of fully onchained games, composability, interoperability with smart contracts, but you also have the scalability and also these seamless user experience powered by the distributed systems research and engineering that the game industry have done for more than two decades now. All those collective learnings we bring over into blockchain so that we can finally, basically, we can finally bring this very niche blockchain and web tree game into a state where it's now professional. It's actually a real industry with really cool attempts and shots on goal for building novel games instead of just another NFT collectibles, which just getting pretty old.
00:14:43.520 - 00:15:18.080, Speaker A: I think what's really cool about your project is that if it succeeds and you go to market with this product and your vision is fulfilled, it is the market validation for this modular stack. And this is, you know, if it works, then we know that this is the architecture to go forward with, to scale to the next billions of users. Right. We're going mainstream now. So this is very interesting. I would love to hear about the application that you're building, the actual game that you're launching at modular Summit.
00:15:18.160 - 00:16:02.290, Speaker B: Yeah, I think one of our mantra within a company is that we don't want to be a pick and shovel company. A lot of people are doing infra for the sake of infra, but we see ourselves more as a gaming company. We're building the technology, we're building world engine as a means to an end for us to build better games as a part of our endeavor. Again, we're building a world engine right now. Like launching a new game built on top of the world engine. That showcases one of the key unique benefits that you got with a world engine, which is geolocalization. As you previously mentioned, with Ultima Online, you can have servers are closer to you, which gives you lower latencies, or you have a better user experience.
00:16:02.290 - 00:17:29.553, Speaker B: These are something that previously, this is not even a concept most classical blockchains. So if a block producer or roll up sequencer is based in the US and in Asia, your transactions are going to have to wait a long, long time before it gets processed. And that means that every single game moves that you make will feel sluggish, which is not acceptable if you're trying to build a game, because our mind has this state of flow that they expect when you're playing a game. And when those state of flows are disrupted because of these transaction weights, you lose the joy and these constant rush of energy that you can gain from playing a game. And so one of the things that we do is with sharding, you can have multiple sequencers, you can have multiple block producers anywhere in the world running on different regions across the world, and therefore you can have load latency for anyone from anywhere of the globe. This allows you to access markets, you access players that otherwise wouldn't have been able to play the game in a way that is interesting or I think that's one of the things that I think I was very frustrated by when I was. I come from Indonesia, born and raised, and if I want to play this new game that only has a us server, then the game would be close to unplayable for me and I would just leave the game very quickly.
00:17:29.553 - 00:18:23.678, Speaker B: And so I want to make sure that's not something that we have to be stuck with. With blockchain games, with fully launching games, that's one of the coolest thing that we are showcasing with this latest launch. That's a very exciting milestone for us and a large milestone for the fully intune games community in general too, because now there are more different kinds of games that we can do that previously we weren't able to do. Because without this geolocalization, then you can only do very slow paced games, card games, really moving very slowly. You can't really have anything that has real time combat, but now with geo localization, you can have them and then you can actually check it out today like blocksurvivor.com dot. And so with that game, you can be anywhere in the world and you will have a shard that is close to you, giving you low latency.
00:18:23.678 - 00:18:39.048, Speaker B: And we actually have one running in Germany right now, which the modular summit is going to be using, which gives you less than 50 millisecond latency. You're gonna be like, you know, very snappy as you play the game.
00:18:39.144 - 00:19:08.976, Speaker A: That's very exciting. Well, if you are as excited as I am about Scott's d project, then be sure to tune into his talk at modular summit and be sure to check out his game. I'm very excited to also test out your game. I'm a gamer myself, if you couldn't tell. And yeah, if you want to listen to a deeper dive about Argus labs that we haven't covered yet. Be sure to tune in at Interchain FM, where we have Scott back on in the future.
00:19:09.128 - 00:19:09.440, Speaker B: All right?
