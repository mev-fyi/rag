00:00:01.520 - 00:00:31.970, Speaker A: So, hi, everyone. I'm Arji, and I'm going to be talking about sovereign, skill free reputation systems. So we're starting with the assumption that reputation systems, the way they're built today, are broken. And so repo is the first sovereign reputation roll up on Celestia. And what we're building is a way for. A way to. A way to incentivize building reputation models in a verifiable and customizable manner at scale.
00:00:31.970 - 00:01:23.810, Speaker A: So let's. Before I dive into, you know, kind of how we do that, I want to talk about what do we mean by reputation systems. So, reputation systems are tools, applications, or products that, you know, that users use to mitigate risk or delegate trust. So in the world today, you know, in the last 20 years, we've seen Google Trustpilot, and, you know, yelp, and some of these reputation systems are quite popular. And then all these reputation systems actually have a reputation model underneath, which essentially you can look at that as an algorithm or a set of algorithms that interpret data. But they do have a human in the loop. So a human in the loop is kind of making those choices about how the reputation models are built and what the weights are to decide how the system is created.
00:01:23.810 - 00:02:21.700, Speaker A: And so this is the current state of reputation kind of models and systems. Their one reputation model maps to one reputation system, and you have, the way they're usually built, are black box prone to abuse? One of the Reddit articles I came across said that 44% of Amazon reviews are actually fake. People review forums in different parts of the world. And so it's quite a problem, especially knowing that people make a lot of spending decisions based on these rating and review systems. And finally, they're built in a centralized manner. And so the world that we imagine with repo is a world where you have plug and play reputation models that power reputation systems. So I'll talk about the architecture of the repo protocol, but essentially the way the repo models are built, they're verifiable on chain, they have co ownership primitives using things like the story protocol.
00:02:21.700 - 00:03:41.546, Speaker A: And there's also rev share with data owners, just the way we built repo data lake, in which the repo modelers are accessing the data and the data set needed to build the repo models. And so before I dive into the architecture as well, I think this slide is from the research day from last month in New York, where Chris goes from onoma presented this in the context of scale free money. But if taking this in the context of scale free reputation systems. We currently have a bunch of reputation systems that are generalized, and then we have very niche reputation systems that are based on word of mouth or second or third degree connections, and not everyone is privileged enough to have those reputation systems around them. And so a world that we are imagining with repo models and scale free risk and reputation systems is the one that looks closer to on your right hand side, where you have different Loci's serving relevance based on context. And so here's an overview of what the repo protocol looks like. We're building, as I mentioned, a sovereign roll up on Celestia, where you have the repo chain acts as the execution layer and the incentive layer.
00:03:41.546 - 00:04:36.370, Speaker A: And on top of that, you have the repo model repository, which, I mean, you can just look that as a model marketplace, and on top of that, people build what we call reputation apps, but just dapps or reputation systems. So here are some examples of reputation systems that have been built and that we are building currently. And so, just like repo models, the protocol itself is very modular. We use a bunch of interops built in a very distributed manner. But, yeah, and so this is not exhaustive. These are just like, you know, initial interrupts that we've explored, but we're still kind of open to seeing what else can we do? The most recent one, which is not mentioned here, actually, is we're looking at anoma to source intents to see what modelers can like. How do modelers know what to model? So that's kind of been quite interesting for us.
00:04:36.370 - 00:05:34.640, Speaker A: So, in terms of scope, repo is designed as an open infrastructure to build risk and reputation models. We're starting with deep ins. Deep ins have a very specific problem called deepen verification, where you're trying to match SLA's for the data clients or for clients in general. And so we're starting there, and then we'll be going at AI agents, looking at how AI agents understand real world context and kind of understand things that LLMs cannot do, because LLMs are mostly, you know, finding patterns in language. But we think that you need more than language to understand, to make AI system smart enough to understand context. And then, yeah, as I talked before, repo is also the repository layer and the collaboration layer. So for the last two, you can think of these as hugging face, but more incentivized in a web3 manner.
00:05:34.640 - 00:06:27.220, Speaker A: And as the reputation roll up, we're stakeholder specific and sector agnostic. So what I mean by that is the repo protocol itself allows customization for any stakeholder so let's say if you're an investor, you can customize the models for your needs, versus if you're a data client, you can customize the reputation models for your context and sector. Agnostic means that we're nothing, starting with a specific sector. So that means defi or dpins, like the way the architecture is designed. It can be used for many different applications within web3 and even web two. And so here are some examples of reputation systems that we have built for using the repo protocol. And so, once the repo protocol is up, we just launched our devnet.
00:06:27.220 - 00:07:21.566, Speaker A: The possibilities are really endless. I think one of the interesting things that we've seen is that you have these generalist reputation systems that take the average of the sum approach to give you outputs. But we think that with repo and repo models, you can create context specific and niche reputation models. So without further ado talking about what repo is, I would like to invite Ruben, who's the founder and founding GP for protocol Labs capital, who's one of our first users for the repo protocol, to give you a context of how architect systems has used repo and repo models to solve their use case. Hi, Ruben. Can I sit here? Yeah, of course.
00:07:21.718 - 00:07:22.646, Speaker B: Hey, guys.
00:07:22.838 - 00:07:54.400, Speaker A: So, just a bit more context, I have an intro for Ruben. Ruben has been involved in ecosystem building for many years. He's, as I mentioned, one of the founding GPS for protocol Labs capital. His work has contributed to deploying more than $10 billion in Portcos at protocol labs. So, yeah, super excited to have you here, Ruben. So let's start with, you know, the first question. What excites you about repo?
00:07:55.220 - 00:08:53.409, Speaker B: What excites me about repo? So, first of all, thank you for the intro. What excites me about repo. So what you guys do, you and your team are there, is you build those context specific models that we as users and as investors can use to then build reputation systems that cater to a very specific use case. And you can then use them to fit their. So what the investment process looks like is you want to evaluate an opportunity extremely quickly, and ideally, you want to tap into additional rigor and into additional models very quickly. What you guys can do is you accelerate our speed to decision making if you want to, as we can, with very little effort, tap into one of your models, make it into a reputation system for whatever deep end we want to invest into, and then we get to.
00:08:55.349 - 00:09:04.689, Speaker A: Yeah, that's super exciting. So, can you tell us a bit more about, let's say, in a world that repo does not exist, what would your process look like? You know?
00:09:04.989 - 00:09:17.058, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, there was a time when Repo didn't exist. I wouldn't describe it as a driven world, but you take a lot of load of us.
00:09:17.114 - 00:09:17.330, Speaker A: Right.
00:09:17.370 - 00:09:58.094, Speaker B: So while we use your reputation systems to make better decisions, we also use it to make faster decisions. What repo allows us to do in a world without repo, what we would need to do is we would need to engage, orchestrate, and likely also project manage the modelers ourselves. We would then not just need to adapt the model to fit for purpose, but we would actually need to orchestrate that community, and hence, that would divert resources away from what I think we do best, which is identifying investment opportunities and spending time with others.
00:09:58.262 - 00:10:22.272, Speaker A: Okay, that's really cool. And I remember we've talked about this a lot since we met in Berlin. And I think one of the things that Ruben asked me was, why are we building on Celestia? Yeah. Why are you building on select? Yeah. So, for us, I think when we were starting out, we considered many different options. We considered IPC. I was at Filecoin for many years, and we also considered, of course, Ethereum and Solana.
00:10:22.272 - 00:10:57.912, Speaker A: I think three reasons, I think Celestia. The first reason is Celestia allows us to not think about infrastructure on a day to day basis. We just want to be this incentive layer for risk and reputation modeling. And so not having, I think we were able to spin up a Devnet within a month and a half. And just the interoperability in terms of choosing our own settlement layer and whatnot, allows us to really focus on the tokenomics and crypto economics of what it would need to incentivize modelers to come on the repo network. I think the other one is. This one is interesting.
00:10:57.912 - 00:11:51.550, Speaker A: We look at repo as this very much like the Hindenburg research approach, where we think that modelers and Repo are incentivized to find a non obvious insights and actually call out networks that might be in DEFi or DPIN. We actually just posted a model for the demo network, which models carbon emissions. And so the question that we're asking is that, okay, a decentralized way to gather vehicle data is awesome, but does that come at a cost for carbon emissions? And this is an interesting question. So, because we talk about deep ins as this amazing thing that happens, but does it come at a cost? And so those are the kind of questions that we're interested in. So you actually go to repo XYZ. You can find that model, you can find the app, and you can also find the underlying model that allows you to play with the model. And so those are the kind of things.
00:11:51.550 - 00:12:35.720, Speaker A: And so with how that plays into Celestia is that we can be this. We don't have to be on Ethereum or Solana and be impacted by the price action of what might result from the information. We can just focus on still being this calling out network. I think from that perspective, really leveraging Celestia's lazy chain approach, where we can be this third party, and then finally, we think that the modular ecosystem really plays into how repo models are designed. They're plug and play, modular and approach. So those are the reasons why Celestia is the best chain for us. Cool.
00:12:35.840 - 00:12:47.380, Speaker B: And then I guess, like, in my double hat, as both an investor and as a user of repo, how will this get big?
00:12:48.000 - 00:13:49.330, Speaker A: Yeah, so this is a great question, right? I think a lot of times when I go talk to investors, talk to people, they're like, okay, reputation systems are cool. I think a lot of the times, people kind of, like, not confused, but, you know, they just put reputation systems and identities, like, you know, decentralized identity in the same bucket. But reputation systems are in, like, you know, for me, this is the way this gets big is because at the end of the day, there is nothing like trustlessness. I think we just confuse this notion of verifiability with trustlessness. If a system is verifiable, we try to call it trustless. Of course, we're all working towards progressive trustlessness, but the idea of trust has subjectivity and embedded into it. And so our notion is that as more and more protocols try to actually find users and try to find use cases, they will start to have to care about Sla's and some of these things that the boring things that web two has to care about.
00:13:49.330 - 00:14:35.220, Speaker A: And so to that extent, I look at this as a trilemma. I think there's the blockchain trilemma of scalability, decentralization, and then there's the. There's, like, another, like, I call it the dripping trilemma. But this is relevant to other networks as well, which is decentralization, scalability, and quality. And so I think when you start to think about quality, I think reputation, risk, and reputation systems start to become really important. And so then the question becomes, who is designing these risk and reputation systems? So there might be another protocol that's coming up with their own benchmarking mechanisms. But then eventually, the community will ask well, who's coming up with these benchmarking mechanisms? The REPA protocol allows you to actually include your community in the system design process.
00:14:35.220 - 00:15:18.944, Speaker A: And so that's really important. And finally, when you talk about governance right now, the way governance, the governance systems work is, it's mostly happening on GitHub. I mean, you have some protocols like Kleros and whatnot that are trying to make it a bit better. But at the end of the day, you don't have, like, you're still working with native incentives in the governance system. So we look at repo as kind of having, you know, a third party incentives layer that can, that you can, that other protocols can leverage to invite, you know, smart people in the governance process. So those are some of the reasons, and I think those three reasons, I think, is how reputation systems and like, repo gets big.
00:15:19.112 - 00:15:19.984, Speaker B: Fantastic.
00:15:20.112 - 00:15:21.312, Speaker C: All right, thank you, everyone.
00:15:21.416 - 00:15:22.180, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:15:25.560 - 00:15:42.860, Speaker C: One question and see, because you were describing that the traditional reputation systems in web two, people have their flags which they're running to basically boost reviews. How can I use rebel to sort of. You basically solve for that problem?
00:15:43.410 - 00:15:45.426, Speaker A: So can you repeat the first part?
00:15:45.538 - 00:15:59.450, Speaker C: So, like, obviously we have bot farms, and even in web3, we have simul people with a bunch of wallets simmering and reputation system. How can you with repo sort of like prevent that from that?
00:15:59.530 - 00:16:25.288, Speaker A: Right. So I think the idea of reputation systems right now is very reactive. I think the Repl protocol allows it to be proactive. So I'm not going to prevent that. It's like a cat and mouse problem. But if you are a protocol and you want to engage, first of all, the approach that repo is taking is we're not partnering with protocols. We're not the gauntlet of the world.
00:16:25.288 - 00:16:56.660, Speaker A: We are saying that, hey, modelers on the repo network have an incentive to find risk within other protocols. To that extent, if there's a protocol that is more prone to bot farms, then modelers in the repo network will have an incentive to build a repo model and then maybe publish a report or call it out. And that's kind of how we see it. It's not like I will be going, there is a world in which we can reach out to the foundations. So that's how we see it.
00:16:56.700 - 00:17:14.364, Speaker C: Okay. I don't know if you saw how players here was sort of identifying the civil wallets for the airdrop. Is that something that you can do through repo? Basically, you can spin up a model, basically ping all these wallets. So that's sort of like the goal.
00:17:14.532 - 00:17:43.430, Speaker A: Yes. So that was the goal. And the interesting thing here is that the easiest way to build that model would be actually like getting like, you know, historical data about layer zero wallets and all those things. I think the interesting thing about repo is how you combine on chain and off chain data. So in the demo case, what we did was we actually took on chain data about vehicles and then we took off chain data from the Environmental Protection Agency and we combined those two datasets because the demo network does not capture emissions data. Right. Because they have no incentive to.
00:17:43.430 - 00:18:04.176, Speaker A: And so similarly in this use case, I mean, I can't think of like what the off chain data would be right away, but I think you can come up with off chain mechanisms or like multiple on chain mechanisms that are non obvious. And so that's how we think about it. And at the end of the day, predictive in nature, which is, I think, better than like something absolute awesome.
00:18:04.208 - 00:18:05.500, Speaker C: Thank you so much for that.
00:18:06.320 - 00:18:07.320, Speaker B: Cool. Thank you.
