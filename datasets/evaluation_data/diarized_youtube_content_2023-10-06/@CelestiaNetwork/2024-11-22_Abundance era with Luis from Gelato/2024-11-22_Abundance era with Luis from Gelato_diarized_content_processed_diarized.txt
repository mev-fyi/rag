00:00:00.200 - 00:00:14.245, Speaker A: Tweet. There we go. I think we are live now. Good morning everyone. LM gm, whatever your M is G move.
00:00:14.585 - 00:00:20.565, Speaker B: Yeah me harba is what I'm seeing on my timeline now. Since I got a sloth I have to learn Turkish now I think.
00:00:21.225 - 00:01:13.433, Speaker A: Yeah, there's also G alt to all the alt VM enjoyers out there. Well, it's great to be on. We have Lewis who is founder of Gelato on today and the reason we're having them on. Well, for those who don't know, Gelato is one of the top roll up as a service providers in the space and one that works very closely in the Celestia ecosystem. And then earlier this week they announced Abundance or ABC Sovereign roll up stack which can achieve giga gas levels of throughput. Gas is the measurement of the throughput of an execution layer and most execution layers currently are in the mega gas range. And yeah, it's pretty astonishing that ABC is reaching gigas throughput.
00:01:13.433 - 00:01:42.415, Speaker A: So we wanted to dive into that. We wanted to understand why Gelato is betting so hard on sovereign roll ups. This is something that the Celestia vision has always emphasized, the potential for sovereign roll ups versus the standard smart contract settled roll ups that you see in Ethereum. So we're going to unpack all of that with Luis. So Luis, welcome. Feel free to give a quick intro and then let's dive in.
00:01:42.715 - 00:02:23.339, Speaker B: Thank you very much. So yeah, I'm Luis, I'm one of the two founders of Gelato and Abundance. And yeah, so Abundance is the newest project out of Gelato. It is essentially the essence of my journey in understanding what roll ups are. And interestingly I thought about this in my journey of understanding what roll ups are started many years ago. Many, many years ago, I think 2020 with a random podcast I listened to on ZKFM at the Zero Knowledge podcast and it was with John Adler and I think it was Lazy Ledger back then or something. But John must have been there from the start.
00:02:23.339 - 00:03:15.781, Speaker B: Right? And I remember like John explaining roll ups and even Lazy Ledger or like now Celestia back then and, and it's sort of like I remember this episode distinctly as very like, like I learned a lot but then it sort of disappeared a bit and then roll ups were like a big thing without tools and Ethereum and so on. Right. And then, yeah. So essentially I think Celestia has just been such an integral part in my, my journey of understanding everything in blockchains from the ground up. So super happy to be here today and talk about what we are doing there with Abundance, which is different to what rollup as a service providers normally do. Normally roll up as a service providers, they give you an Ethereum L2 or like L3 or something, usually op stack or arbitrum. Right, in which we have many chains of we working with both teams really well, and Abundance and ABC Stack, this is a different thing.
00:03:15.781 - 00:03:45.967, Speaker B: It is not an Ethereum thing at all. It is a Celestia native roll up stack. And this roll up itself is very different to a normal OP L2. For example, on Ethereum it is a sovereign roll up which Celestia has pioneered. And let me tell you, it took me like quite some time to understand the concept. Like I think everybody that hears this at first, like what the hell? Doesn't make any sense really. But like I always say, or really I stole this, I think from Sam Altman is like there's a saying that the best ideas sound stupid but aren't.
00:03:45.967 - 00:04:19.285, Speaker B: And this is for me what sovereign rollups are. It's like they sound stupid at first. It's like what you're an L1, you're not your own settlement layer. The whole point of a roll up is to settle somewhere, right? Well, I guess it isn't right. And yeah, so ABC Stack is the first sort of big EVM software roll up stack that is built by us and it is our way of also contributing to the stack space, not just in the hosting as a roll up as a service. And I think it's just like a major unlock for us. But yeah, let's unpack that a bit before I ramble on too long here.
00:04:19.985 - 00:05:36.085, Speaker A: No, that was a great intro and I really relate to you in the fact that when I first learned about Celestia or Lazy Ledger, it forced me to rethink so many concepts I took for granted about blockchains and rebuild my understanding from the ground up. And I think that the same is true not just for the layer one, but also for roll ups and what they are. And I think so many people in the space come from the Ethereum perspective of these roll ups need to have this like enshrined, you know, contract bridge. And when you break break out of that, it turns out there's a lot of things that open up for you. But at least when you, when you start off with your understanding of roll ups in that mental model, it's very confusing and strange and sounds stupid actually to build them in a different way. So I think it's really cool that you guys took that leap into this new frame of thinking and I think that the existing roll up space and modular ecosystem is very much probably like 95% these sort of like smart contracts roll ups. And now there's an increasing amount of sovereign roll up stacks.
00:05:36.085 - 00:06:07.581, Speaker A: Like we have Sovereign SDK, we have Rolekit and now ABC Stack. And I think this is a growing trend. We have on the one hand all these evm, almost everything is EVM settled roll ups. And now we're going to start to have sovereign roll ups. We're going to start to have Alt VM roll ups like Eclipse and Movement and Initia and things like that. And I'm just really excited for the modular future. And to me ABC Stack is one of those new frameworks that's going to open up a lot of potential for people to build.
00:06:07.581 - 00:06:19.945, Speaker A: So yeah, tell us more about what is ABC Stack. What does it enable for application developers that you couldn't do before? What are some of its features and also maybe a bit about how it works.
00:06:20.645 - 00:06:45.711, Speaker B: Yeah. So ABC Stack is for me the conclusion of the modular stack. And those are big words. Yes. I think like where I got re celestia pilled was this whole like modularism. Modularism, not maximalism. And I think this is also encoded in ABC Stack very well.
00:06:45.711 - 00:07:15.397, Speaker B: And like for me ABC Stack and sovereign rollups are the conclusion of the modular thesis. Because you and now really also modular modularized bridge. And in L2 construction you have an enshrined bridge, you have a modular settlement layer. In a sovereign rollup you don't have a modular settlement layer. You are the settlement layer. You're like more like an L1 I sometimes call sovereign roll ups. There are roll ups.
00:07:15.397 - 00:07:33.065, Speaker B: So here's, here's what, like what what people like. Why it's so hard to understand sovereign roll up is because usually people come with an understanding of L2s and they think L2s and roll ups are the same. They're not like I have this meme that L2s. There are no L2s, it's just chains and bridges. Right. Which I think I stole that from Zaki or someone. And that's the key.
00:07:33.065 - 00:08:22.411, Speaker B: That was another key unlock for me in my journey of understanding. All this is like is just chains and bridges. That really helps even in L2. Like L2s don't exist per se and L2 is just a roll up that uses an external settlement layer in a very weird like enshrined bridge that is very opinionated. And these are normally known as the optimistic fraud proof window bridge. The roller Bridge, right, Obviously famously used by Optimism and Arbitrum or like a ZK bridge, ZK roll up bridge, which I mean maybe makes a bit more sense in terms of the future proof proofing there because of latencies and so on, but, but still it's a very opinionated way of connecting a chain to a so called settlement layer. And in a way, like another unlock here is to understand that settlement itself is also just a meme.
00:08:22.411 - 00:09:15.865, Speaker B: It's like a very elusive concept, right? Like for example, Ethereum is called a settlement layer, but everybody knows that a huge chunk of the assets on Ethereum is like circle and circle is the issue of that asset. And Circle and Tether are the ultimate settlement layers, right? So like everybody knows that if Circle or Tether would jointly or even individually back up a certain version of Ethereum, they would have a very strong power to influence the network in following that version. So in a way, like circle is the real settlement layer and so on. Of course Ethereum is bigger than Circle. Like ETH asset is great, right? So it's more than that for sure. But settlement is a meme, right? And similarly like on sovereign roll ups, yeah, so you could say you lose some modularity because you're now as a roll up, not just doing execution anymore, you're doing both execution and settlement. But actually I think that's not true.
00:09:15.865 - 00:10:34.485, Speaker B: I think it's still more modular than an L2 because settlement is a meme and you can adjust up any bridge you like, right? Like you can use Layer 0, you can use USDC Circle Socket Hyperlane, lazy bridging, right? So anything you like and any foreign asset that you import in your roll up will be settled by that bridge on a anyways, right? So settlement is just a means. So ultimately sovereign roll ups are the epitome of the modular thesis and they give you one last missing piece of modularity which is like, hey, just bridge how you like, use whatever bridge you want. But also another key unlock is. Or maybe no bridge at all, right? And guess what? Most of our roll up as a service customers at Gelato, most of them, they don't really use the native L2 bridge or they don't. Or like normally the bridge should be used to get ETH first, but then they want a custom gas token, so they don't even want their users to pay with ETH and so on, right? So, so actually a lot of use cases don't want to connect to Ethereum. They don't care about ETH asset, they just want to put something and they don't need a bridge at all. Like if you have a single asset on your chain, your game asset and that's it, a servant roll up just like any other L1 natively issues that asset and that's the end of the story.
00:10:34.485 - 00:10:58.235, Speaker B: You don't need a bridge. Right, so that's another key unlock here. I think to like, you sometimes have to go to extremes to understand concepts. And for me a key unlock with this whole bridging and settlement meme and the sovereign roll up thesis is you can have a roll up without any bridge at all. So with an L2 you can't have that. Like we have users, literally many chains that have the L2 bridge but they're not using it. But you can't get rid of it.
00:10:58.235 - 00:11:03.335, Speaker B: The stack enshrines it. Right. It's just a huge inefficiency. So you get it whether you want it or not.
00:11:04.595 - 00:12:36.131, Speaker A: Yeah, I remember talking to you a while back and you were showing me sort of like L2 beat and like as you go down, like certain, certain L2s do have a significant amount of value actually bridged in the canonical bridge, like maybe over half of their TBL or something like that. But a lot of them have very minimal, if not almost zero assets bridged through their canonical bridge with, with the Ethereum L1. And so at that point it's like kind of, it's like, well, why, why are you making this trade off of enshrining all this like logic for the bridge in your roll up when you're not even using it and it causes all this overhead and then yeah, you inherit all these other, you know, I guess like downsides when if you just get rid of that and you can still have a, have the bridge. It just doesn't have to be sort of like a core assumption in the way that you, you build your roll up and all of a sudden like a whole bunch of new opportunities open up to you. And so I think that was a really interesting insight that you had. And I think again the settlement layer as a meme to me, I think the vision of settlement in Ethereum is all the assets should be issued and should be canonical on the Ethereum L1. Not like they always thought of it like, oh well, you have all assets on the L1 and then you bridge them up to the L2, you do things and then you can always bring them back and like the, you know, the L1 is like the ledger of record for all these assets.
00:12:36.131 - 00:13:22.605, Speaker A: But I think to me, and to Anyone from coming from more of like a cosmos angle, it's sort of like no, the assets should be issued on the roll ups and be native there. That's where like their canonical version, that's where the ledger of record should just be the chain where like the community who uses or has built those things lives. Right. And so it should be native to the roll up and at least that's anyway another reason why exactly the Ethereum L1 is just another chain, right? It's not like it doesn't, it shouldn't, shouldn't necessarily have like a, I don't know, be like the place where all the assets live and are issued. It's like the ledger record for ETH and any of the other assets there, but not for the L2 or roll up per se.
00:13:22.765 - 00:14:19.539, Speaker B: Yes. And the funny thing, what you alluded to here, like what I realized early on when I was trying to explain Sovereign roll ups to our team and so on, right. Like again, the first time I really took a look at it, we had internal research. That's like almost two years ago. Back then it was like, you know, we looked at, I think Sovereign SDK was one of the SDKs out already, at least in development and, and I didn't really get it the first time and then revisited it at the start of the year because then I was realizing, wait a second, we have all these users, we have this L2 bridge which is very important for a ROS provider because guess what, like you own the keys to that bridge, right? Like so you have all sorts of liability things. You have to make sure it's secure. There's a vendor lock in, as we've seen with the DJ and conduit drama, right, Where DJ wanted to move away from conduit and you can't just like there's huge vendor locking because you have to ask the raas, they have to transfer the ownership of the bridge and so on.
00:14:19.539 - 00:15:01.821, Speaker B: So like with an L2 design, the RAS provider is, becomes like the bridge operator, if you will. And you don't even have that with a sovereign roll up because like there's no bridge or like you use layer 0 or something and they are special. Like this is also about modularity, division of work and specialization, right? Like the cornerstones of a good working economy. And here again it's like, you know, and to be fair, like the whole L2 bridge thing also sucks. Like, right, everybody knows the seven day window. Like the only people who are using this bridge are like across relayers and so on, right? Everything Else is abstracted with the liquidity management. So users aren't using the bridge even on the chains where there is significant TBL in the bridge.
00:15:01.821 - 00:15:16.697, Speaker B: They're using liquidity management from across across then needs to use the bridge to rebalance their inventory. But they hate it. They hate the seven days. It's extremely capital inefficient. They have to inject fresh capital to fill all the time. The rebalancing is cooked. Right.
00:15:16.697 - 00:15:28.945, Speaker B: So. So like we don't even like. I don't call the optimistic L2 bridge. I don't even call it a bidirectional bridge. It's like a unidirectional bridge. The into the roll up is great, it's instant but withdrawing seven days. Come on.
00:15:28.945 - 00:15:45.633, Speaker B: Like this is a meme, right? Like this. This is not the future of France. Everybody knows that. ZK sure is an option there and I think OP already has ZK fraud proof of six signals on that. These are cool designs to get the latency down. Right? For sure. But yeah, so it's just a very.
00:15:45.633 - 00:16:10.065, Speaker B: Like this. We will look back on this period and we'll be like what the hell were we thinking then? Right. So this is I think pretty obvious to me. But yeah, so people aren't really using these bridges anyway. So what the hell. And they're not using them because they're using external providers already like Socket. We have a roll up like Raya huge TVL orbit rollup and I think 100% of the assets are issued on the roll up with Socket and not the bridge.
00:16:10.065 - 00:16:35.033, Speaker B: And yeah, but even more like you said, the native asset issuance. Right. Like if you look on base and so on, there's so many assets that don't even live on Ethereum. Right. So Ethereum, the whole point with this L2 bridge design is to have a trust minimized bridge to Ethereum, the asset issuance layer. But if your asset doesn't live on Ethereum, Ethereum can't bail you out. Right? So the whole or Ethereum is like the.
00:16:35.033 - 00:16:56.091, Speaker B: You inherit the security from Ethereum complete bs, right. Like it completely depends on your assets really for eth that you bridge in. If you put your eth into the Arbitrum 1 bridge and you, you have that on arbitrum. Yes. Now you're secured by Ethereum. That's true. But actually I think the question of how important that is is just a question of what are the assets.
00:16:56.091 - 00:17:20.415, Speaker B: And Ethereum is a great asset and you want to import that in the cleanest way possible probably. And There the roller bridges are great, but apart from Ethereum, unfortunately I think we haven't seen that many crypto native assets, like most of the stuff are real world assets. It's like dollars and so on. Right. And so and Bitcoin on Ethereum is not any crypto asset. It's like custody by someone like Bitwise or whoever. Right.
00:17:20.415 - 00:17:51.387, Speaker B: So actually funnily most of the crypto assets are meme coins. If you think about it there you don't have a real world entity that can sort of steal from you or confiscate or whatever. So actually I think the only crypto native assets are the assets that are issued by an L1 like TIA or ETH or meme coins that are like living on these L1s. Maybe you could argue project token coins and so on. Right. But there's usually an entity behind that as well. So.
00:17:51.387 - 00:18:11.375, Speaker B: So yeah, like I don't know, I'm not that bullish on, on Ethereum as this asset issuance layer anymore outside of Ethereum eth the asset itself and of course ETH is a, is a great asset for defi and so on. It's a decentralized asset. There's not that many of them and in that regard it's awesome. Right. But apart from this, I don't know.
00:18:13.115 - 00:18:59.265, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean it's just, I think it's a reality that the space will slowly kind of come to terms with is like, you know, sovereign, sovereign chains are kind of the way that like most applications I think are going to be, are going to be built and you guys are just, are just early to it. So one thing that I want to touch on is, I mean so the big headline of this whole announcement of ABC Stack and one of the, and it was called Abundance, right. Is this gigas throughput. Right. And I know, so I know you can't reveal all of your secret sauce for how you get to Gigagas apparently. I mean you have chains that are live on testnet where you've tested this. So it's not an unfound claim.
00:18:59.425 - 00:19:24.159, Speaker B: You can check it now on Giga guys Live actually. Yeah, sorry. So yeah, no mainnets yet, but it's coming really soon. We literally just need to, we just need to do some bd right. Like we're talking to a lot of folks that are super interested that need a giga gas and so on and yeah, so once, once the first application is ready for Mainnet, we're ready as well and that will be very soon, I think so.
00:19:24.207 - 00:20:21.727, Speaker A: So that's well, so that's something I want to touch on. Right. So first of all I'm just curious how did you get Gigas what, what you, what you can share. And as far as I understand there's a relationship to the fact that this is a sovereign roll of stack and some of the advantages you get by being also by being Celestia opinionated that allow you to achieve this level of throughput. And then the second thing is you're out in the market selling chains to teams and builders. And I'm curious, we talk a lot internally at Celestia about the fact that we're entering this abundance era of high throughput and what that means for you know, the kinds of things that you can build. And so I'm just curious to hear from you who's like so close to you know the people actually like choosing which roll ups stacks to build on which you know, data availability layers to choose.
00:20:21.727 - 00:20:33.755, Speaker A: What is this? What, what are the, some of the applications that people want to build and can take advantage of that you can't build on these traditional roll up frameworks that, that don't have this level of throughput.
00:20:34.565 - 00:20:55.465, Speaker B: Yeah. And actually now I will present quickly because I'm going to show you. Let me see here, see share screen. So yeah, can you see my screen as the question? Yeah, you can see it right?
00:20:55.925 - 00:20:57.445, Speaker A: So this is the dashboard.
00:20:57.605 - 00:21:22.447, Speaker B: Yeah. So you can go to Gigagast live. Yeah, it's live on the gig side. It's the funniest account on XF to say it popped up recently and there they added ABC yesterday. Right now it's not at 1 gigas but I've seen it do more than 1 gigas. I think the account posted yesterday about it. So right now it's at 0.46
00:21:22.447 - 00:21:42.937, Speaker B: gigas. This happens sometimes, right? Like you depends on the usage on the testnet. But I've seen it do, I've seen it do a Gigagas like if you, if you go to gigas live, if you, if you have no life yourself, just spend all day on it. And I promise you, I promise you you will see it, you will see it rip into the giga gas zone.
00:21:43.121 - 00:21:47.337, Speaker A: And this is on testnet. This is also on Celestia. Testnet.
00:21:47.521 - 00:22:18.627, Speaker B: Yes. This is like actually I think for our ABC test net where we have achieved the gig inter internally like already like months ago I think we had this joke where it's like giga gas doesn't know whether you're testing it or not. Right. So actually it might be that we use the real estate? I don't think so. But. But technically why not? Right? Because like giga gas doesn't care if you're a test net or not. Right? Like well it's just the same metric at the end of the day, totally testing.
00:22:18.627 - 00:22:30.515, Speaker B: The main is the only difference is is it real money or not? Right. But for the purpose performance, it doesn't really matter. So actually at some point we wanted to use the real celestial four hour test net. I'm not sure if they actually did it or not.
00:22:30.935 - 00:22:42.195, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm just curious what the data consumption is of a giga gas throughput roll up. What is running on that chain right now? Is it just like a bunch of transfers or are there like actual applications?
00:22:42.775 - 00:23:24.965, Speaker B: I think there's all sorts of scripts that the team runs to crank it up. But it's not the only one. We have some real users testing already. Actually it was funny when we announced this I think some of the first chains were all of our Ross competitors who were like what the fuck is going on? And they all like not all but like some of them created ABC chains to see if we are real or joking here. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That was fun to watch. But yeah, anyway so we have some real customers and essentially you were asking about like okay, what's happening here? Right.
00:23:24.965 - 00:24:24.965, Speaker B: So ultimately like I mentioned earlier like the L2 bridge that is enshrined by Ethereum, L2 stacks, it comes with a lot of overhead and like I said given that on a sovereign roll up you don't need a bridge and especially the bridge isn't part of the client. You remove that overhead completely and your. And it turns out these bridges introduce a lot of overhead which is like when I say settlement costs by the way nowadays I don't just mean the literal cost that you pay Ethereum for settling your roll up which is in like the hashes, the state routes you post to the bridge, right Like a. Usually you need to post the data to the DA layer right and then you need to post the state commitments as well to the bridge and that's what's called settlement. It's literally just posting hashes of your roll up blocks in sequence. And this is one actually expensive settlement cost. It's non negligible.
00:24:24.965 - 00:25:07.227, Speaker B: We actually realized this running some arbitrum any trust chains earlier where we thought oh the cost will be almost zero now because we're using AnyTrust SDA and it's like a centralized server. Turns out our chain still had significant costs just from posting the hashes to, to Ethereum or maybe arbitrary one. So that's one thing. But I think the real cost as well is the cost of running the bridge in the client because you constantly have to sync with it. And yeah, you're not just running a roll up, you're running a bridge now as well. Right. So and then as a software developer, like I always discovered that separation of concerns, decoupling, modularization is the way to get the unlocks.
00:25:07.227 - 00:25:19.415, Speaker B: And like I said early on in this podcast, like sovereign roll ups are the ultimate modular conclusion and they decouple bridging from roll ups and now it's just chains and bridges.
00:25:19.955 - 00:26:01.307, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think also the thing that people, you know, there have been a lot of debates on Twitter before and years, years by, gone by about like sovereign roll ups. And there's a lot of people who took the position that like oh, every roll up sovereign, like this is just kind of like a meme or a very technical jargon thing. But the reality is that no like these, when you building a smart contract like settled roll up, the bridge is like enshrined into the roll up client itself. It's not just like, you know, an additional thing that you can like remove or not pay attention to if you don't want to. Like it's literally the whole architecture of the roll up is like it assumes that and is like that. That is like an integral part of it.
00:26:01.307 - 00:26:03.035, Speaker A: Yes, Something, something else.
00:26:03.535 - 00:26:42.199, Speaker B: What's even more ugly about it is something that we discussed just before we even recorded here, reorgs. There was a topic today, right? Yes. So actually what's even more ugly than that is a bridge is one of these smart contract infrastructures that is extremely prone to reorg damages. And as like gelato started out with smart contract automation. Right. Like still is the best there. And like even in the early days of gelato when I was still coding this stuff, like the biggest headaches we always had for any piece of infrastructure that talked to the chain where it was reorg handling.
00:26:42.199 - 00:27:10.365, Speaker B: Right. Like especially on Polygon where you had 180 deep block reoccs or something sometimes. And a bridge is especially prone to that. Like a bridge is essentially. Sometimes I call them re Org risk managers. Because if you think about a bridge, it is handling asset transfers on two separate domains. So if one of them reorgs, they you have an inconsistency that you cannot fix anymore and you might be out of luck and you might have done a transfer and your counterparty has the money and they send you money and you don't have it anymore.
00:27:10.365 - 00:27:22.517, Speaker B: Right. Like this is a bridge problem and the whole purpose of a blockchain was to remove the double spend problem and with bridging your back to, to, to the double spend problem per se because.
00:27:22.541 - 00:27:32.037, Speaker A: You can especially on a, on a liveness favoring like forkful L1 like Ethereum. Right. Versus like a single slot finality layer one.
00:27:32.181 - 00:27:49.429, Speaker B: Yeah. Yes. I mean if you bridge between two single slot finalogy chains, your risk management job is very conservative. It's not that much risk anymore. Right. But chains like most chains like Ethereum, they are availability favoring, liveness favoring. Right.
00:27:49.429 - 00:28:46.251, Speaker B: So they are willingly accept reorgs and now you have to manage that risk and it's a nightmare. So this is why usually when you work with layer 0 and across and so on, these guys, they only want the best RPCs, they want multiple of them and when they give you really fast, like really fast like bridging, they're just saying okay, we are sure it won't reorg but they haven't eliminated all of the risk. Right? There's still some risk. And actually technically in an L2 if you really use the L2 bridge for your asset, technically you need to wait 7 days also for the challenge period. Actually that might be a bit unrelated now that I think of it. So the reorg problem is huge. And this is because in bridging with smart contracts especially, you need to make sure the smart contract state is still updated and so on.
00:28:46.251 - 00:29:06.135, Speaker B: There's a huge overhead you have in the L2 blockchain rollup clients because they essentially just have huge synchronization mechanisms to make sure that their roll up server is really seeing the correct version of Ethereum and that no reorgs have happened. And if there is a reorg you need to respond, right? So there's a bunch of code running that just handles that and that is ugly code.
00:29:07.195 - 00:29:12.027, Speaker A: I heard something like it's like 80% of the OP stack. Like the.
00:29:12.091 - 00:29:23.285, Speaker B: Yeah, like I haven't read the full stack so I'm not sure but I know from gelato that like from my gut feeling tells me 80% of our code is like reorgan. Makes sense.
00:29:23.905 - 00:30:07.121, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, yeah, this has been a super interesting conversation to kind of unpack settlement and we're, it's funny because we're like fighting settlement very hard. But actually today, earlier Mustafa published this blog, new blog post all about lazy bridging which is, I wouldn't necessarily call it settlement, but it adds bridging capabilities to the Celestia L1. But I think it's a very different philosophy to Ethereum in a lot of different ways. One is there's no state or execution that gets added to the Celestial one. It's just like use the ZK verification feature that is going to be shipped sometime next year. So you don't add any overhead to L1.
00:30:07.121 - 00:30:50.557, Speaker A: That's very important. We want to be as minimal as possible. Second of all, it's not for like issuing assets like, you know, you're not trying to, we're not trying to be like we discussed earlier, this like, you know, ledger of record for everything. It's more of a convenient way for you to prove your state to a bunch of other chains and connect to a whole ecosystem of, you know, other L1s that are connected to Sassy L1 as well as all the roll ups that are on top. So it's like this kind of like coordination mechanism. And furthermore it's not enshrined, it's totally optional, you don't have to use it if you don't want to. And we hope that stacks like ABC do support it.
00:30:50.557 - 00:31:08.205, Speaker A: But it's not necessarily something that everything is like. It's not forced on you in the same way that I think that settlement on Ethereum is currently kind of forced on you in a lot of these eccentric stacks. But anyway, I'm just curious to hear your thoughts on, on lazy bridging, given that like it was announced earlier today.
00:31:08.865 - 00:31:11.105, Speaker B: Love it. Yeah.
00:31:11.145 - 00:31:12.625, Speaker A: Why tell us more.
00:31:12.785 - 00:31:37.125, Speaker B: Yeah, so I mean first of all, like by the way, I'm not fighting settlement. Settlement is amazing. I'm just saying people get it wrong all the time. And settlement is an elusive concept. It's poorly defined and Ethereum, you can call it a settlement layer if you will. But you're clowning a bit because like it's not, that's not the full picture, right? Like if you talk about USDC on Ethereum, Circle has the last word, not Ethereum. Right.
00:31:37.125 - 00:32:15.697, Speaker B: So it really depends on your asset. So when you think settlement you need to think assets and then you need to ask who, who's issuing this asset and who's settling this asset ultimately? And there you want to cut out the middleman and ideally you go directly to the asset issuer Circle, right? Ccdp. So technically the best bridge for USDC is not the Ethereum roller bridge, it is Circle cdp. And that's why Arbitrum and Polygon and Optimism asked everyone to stop using the bridge used to see and start using the 7dB when it came. Right? Because everybody agrees that this is the best, best settlement layer is circle itself.
00:32:15.761 - 00:32:20.513, Speaker A: Because it's faster, it's like more secure because it's like them. Like they're the counterparts, they just have.
00:32:20.529 - 00:33:17.627, Speaker B: The last word anyways, right? Like if you know, like USDC means circle has an iou, like they technically owe you dollars, right? Somewhere and at the end of the day if they give you these dollars directly, that's the best, most secure way of doing it, right? So, so, so, so just to be clear on that like settlement exists, settlement is important, but it's very misunderstood in our space and ultimately is just chains and bridges. So. And bridges are closely related to settlement, even more so than chains. Chains as we know from sovereign roll ups can also do settlement. But like if you have a sovereign roll up, like I mentioned earlier in the podcast, that doesn't have a bridge which exists, it has a natively issued asset on the roll up. This asset only exists on this roll up. It's only issued by that roll up.
00:33:17.627 - 00:33:51.893, Speaker B: Like an Ethereum L1 ETH, right? Or like with ABC stack, if you have an in game asset or your own stablecoin, you can let the blockchain natively issue that. Now stablecoins may be a bad example because usually it's a real world asset. So again the real world issuer is the real settlement layer. But maybe it's like Luna USD, please don't but you know, an algorithmic one or something. So there. Your sovereign roll up now is a true settlement layer because it's natively issuing an asset that doesn't exist any anywhere else. And the blockchain is the ledger of record that we coalesce around.
00:33:51.893 - 00:34:38.881, Speaker B: Right? But as soon as you introduce bridges, settlement is the water gets muddied and yeah, so lazy bridging and why I think it's awesome. First of all, if you're threatened by your DA layer, you're weak. We build ABC in a way where like we want to be max aligned with the Celestia roadmap. Celestia is amazing at the sampling, at decentralization, proof of stake, whatnot. So like, you know, if Celestia also gives me a bridge, right then awesome, right? Like Celestia is ibc. I now get IBC for free without having to build it myself. That's great.
00:34:38.881 - 00:35:16.319, Speaker B: Sounds good to me, right? Because ultimately I'm not here to build redundant infrastructure like you know, that someone else can do better than me. I'm here to finally bring real apps on chain Right. Apps that only exist off chain today and abc, one of the slogans is build everything on chain, right? So I don't want to become a settlement layer here. I don't care about that. Like the apps can be the settlement layers if they want to. The apps can use lazy bridging for asset settlement if they want to. Whatever floats your boat, right? I'm here to facilitate that.
00:35:16.319 - 00:35:54.717, Speaker B: I'm not here to build new infrastructure that has already been like, you know, already existed 20 times. And I think Celestia actually is a unique value, has a much better position than I do to build a settlement layer because it is also a DA layer. Right. And that sort of vibes. Well if your rollup uses Celestia for DA and also as a bridge now, that's great, right? Like we know this from Ethereum. Ethereum always tells people, oh, you have to use ethereum both for DA and the product, otherwise you're not a real L2. Like we should even stop calling you an L2 or whatever, right? Like similarly, there's some truth to that, right? Like I think you do get some benefits from co locating your DA layup with ZK account.
00:35:54.717 - 00:36:19.435, Speaker B: Lazy bridging, I haven't fully studied that, but I like gut feeling says maybe there's something there. So. Yeah. But for me, the even better part is I don't want to, you know, rebuild IBC or like have a settlement layer that does like settle roll ups and IBC or like I don't want to do that. Not about that. Like Celestia does IBC perfectly. Celestia probably already has great connections and IBC to great chains.
00:36:19.435 - 00:36:46.127, Speaker B: So if Celestia now gives me a way to compose with it. Awesome, right? That's why I'm looking forward to lazy bridging and, and yeah, zk, the ZK part, I love zk, but it's. I just think it won't be ready anytime soon. I've. Every year people tell me it's ready. This time eventually it will be. I just don't think like, yeah, sure it's ready, but what do I mean, really mean with ready is like, okay, is it instant and does it, is it low cost? Right.
00:36:46.127 - 00:36:49.023, Speaker B: And there are no doubts. Yeah, but yeah.
00:36:49.159 - 00:37:47.329, Speaker A: So. Well, I think it's important to clarify something really quick, which is that like so the lazy bridging, you'll, you'll, you know, the settlement is through like a ZK proof to the L1. Now the thing is, I agree with you is the ZK endgame here, which is like we have real time proving and it's super cheap. And so it's literally when I create a block, I a few seconds later have the ZK proof that that block is valid. Then all of a sudden you can have this. The native bridging can be extremely quick. But the thing is that even when we're not there, just the ability to settle your roll up with an hour time window of finality is extremely useful because what can happen in the background are these like intense based solutions or other things that make it much faster and their cost is like the risk slash the inventory cost of market making these bridges.
00:37:47.329 - 00:38:16.689, Speaker A: So I think even without this real time proving, the fact that we have stacks like succinct SP1 or like rise that are now becoming cheap enough and like generalized enough to be able to prove something like abc. And as far as I understand you guys are built in rust, so it would be very easy to do that. You know, I think it provides like a massive amount of benefit. But we're kind of, we're. I feel like I could talk a lot longer but like we're, I have.
00:38:16.697 - 00:38:51.709, Speaker B: To respond to that though, like just quickly we can, we can finish up. So first of all, I agree ZK is a massive improvement for across and other market makers because now like they have currently on, on optimistic rollups, they have the seven day rebalance problem, which is, which sucks. Which is why they don't scale too many roll ups, right? ZK improves that what a thousand fold or so. Bring it down from seven days to maybe 30 minutes. It's probably a factor of 10,000x, maybe more. I don't know, I'm not good at math, right, but, but it's still not end user ready. It's still 30 minutes.
00:38:51.709 - 00:39:46.875, Speaker B: So you still need someone to abstract the latency for end users. And at Gelato we always thinking one click everything, right? Like we want to be the AWS of the future web, right? And I think until we have market makers that are one click ready to deploy on any chain, any test NET an abstract 30 minutes of latency, that's still going to be the issue. So for me, sure, your conversation in lazy bridging with 30 minute settlement with across will be easier than convincing them to support your roll up with seven day settlement for sure. But it's still a conversation that you need to have and I want to completely remove the human altogether at that point. That's the ZKN game where it's like hey, the technology does the bridging for you and there's no abstraction, right? Like there's no abstraction. I love you insert my late. Right.
00:39:46.875 - 00:39:49.363, Speaker B: So. Yeah, well, yeah.
00:39:49.419 - 00:40:33.889, Speaker A: And I think you know, that's always, has also always been the vision for like you know, IBC and Cosmos is like, you know, there shouldn't be a bridge provider that you need to negotiate with to support. It should all just be permissionless. Like you shouldn't have to do BD when you launch your chain at all. It should just literally be launch it and all the services that you need like work out of the box, including bridging. And you know, one of the challenges like if you're trying to do an intent based thing is like you have to actually kind of like bootstrap that market and like get, get the support of solvers and whatever other like you know, intermediaries need to facilitate that. And furthermore, if it's a long tail chain, you know, it just might not be profitable for these exactly things to.
00:40:33.937 - 00:40:57.137, Speaker B: Especially back to assets like they also probably just won't support any asset you have because they have to sum up put that on the books, right. So they want to, don't want to be exposed to that. So normally they do stable coins. There's no risk or high cap coins because they, they're long anyways. But if you come with your weird whatever chain, right. And, and now you also convince them to put asset on the book, they won't probably, you know, have to loan them assets. Right.
00:40:57.137 - 00:41:42.295, Speaker B: And now we have to sort of automate the loan agreement and whatnot. So so we, I thought about it, right. But, but like this is where like today I'm just like okay, people want instant bridging. Let's, let's, let's just get like layer zero or hyperlane, whatever like online and, and then if you want to go then to base or something, you probably still need some type of market maker for that flow. But like ultimately I'm extremely bullish on ZK accounts and lazy bridging because I just think like it's a road map, right. And a roadmap should also look into the future and it's just the first big step towards that absolute awesome end game with ZK and to up and you know, that alone makes me excited enough to just try it out whenever. Whenever it's out.
00:41:42.715 - 00:42:13.355, Speaker A: Yeah. Well Louise, this has been awesome to dive deep on ABC abundance, sovereign rollups, lazy bridging and ZK and stuff. But yeah, I think we're a little bit over time. So what is to wrap up here? What is like Next for Abundance, ABC Stack. When can we expect the first Giga Gas roll ups to be live? Can you share any hints on what kind of cool applications those are as we close up?
00:42:14.175 - 00:42:18.755, Speaker B: Yeah. So what's next? Obviously Terragas is the meme now.
00:42:19.735 - 00:42:21.359, Speaker A: That's insane dude.
00:42:21.527 - 00:42:31.685, Speaker B: Yeah, so Gigac was a meme for a while, we won that. But now it's Terragas time and we're the first ones to coin that. So Terry Gas is next.
00:42:34.065 - 00:42:35.553, Speaker A: That's crazy. I love it.
00:42:35.689 - 00:42:57.445, Speaker B: You should update the celestial roadmap to 1 terabyte blocks. Obviously not, but no, actually for real. I think 1 gigabyte blocks is like bandwidth wise. That's already so much. 1 gigahertz isn't that much. Actually it is pretty good, but I think some real big applications, they need way more than that. I heard that Mega Eth is already sort of memeing on Twitter.
00:42:57.445 - 00:43:31.511, Speaker B: 10Giga Gas. I don't know, like let's wait and see. That's going to be interesting. But yeah, and then what's next? I mean, you know, stay tuned, follow Ed Gelato Network and we will announce the customers that are, you know, that are launching test nets and mainnets on there and XYZ of course as well. And also let me just make clear that Abundance and Gelato are like basically the same thing. Gelato is the roll up as a service provider hosting many stacks or like three. Three of them.
00:43:31.511 - 00:44:05.305, Speaker B: Right. ABC Op and Orbit and, and Abundance is just the sovereign rollups Celestia native stack that we decided to build because a lot of our customers weren't well served by Ethereum scaling technologies. They didn't care about Ethereum, they didn't care about being L2. So at some point we just said okay, you know, why not give them something else that's, that's abc and it's really something else because it's just happens to have ripped through the 1 gigas barrier. So first in that giga zone.
00:44:05.805 - 00:44:42.705, Speaker A: Yeah. So it's so cool because I think of Roll up as a service teams as like the tip of the spear in terms of talking to the customers that are choosing to build a modular stack and the abundance. This ABC stack that you built, the sovereign roll up stack is a direct response to what your customers have actually been demanding. So it's like it's really cool that this is not like some. You're not doing it because oh, it's cool to be a sovereign roll up and we want to try to differentiate ourselves. It's literally like no, we Went to the drawing board based on what our customers were asking for and this is what they wanted. So we just.
00:44:42.705 - 00:44:47.373, Speaker A: And nothing really existed, so we built it ourselves. Which is pretty 100.
00:44:47.539 - 00:45:17.019, Speaker B: And just to be clear, the Henry Ford quote, right? Like if I had asked the customers, they would have said faster L2s or something, right? Or they literally did. Right. But so, so no one said I need a sovereign rule. I'm like, this is where why I'm so pilled now on Celestial and so on. Like I was following the law and. And suddenly it clicked, right? And Ira then realized, hey, actually what these customers that aren't happy with Ethereum scaling technologies, what they really need is a solvent roll up. And Celestia, by the way, kudos.
00:45:17.019 - 00:45:38.653, Speaker B: Celestia invented the concept, I think. Never heard of it anywhere else. And you guys have been talking about it for two years or longer, right? Like it didn't pick up. And that's because it sounds stupid, but it isn't. Right? And now ABC abundance gelato will make it happen. 2025 will be the years that, the year that solvent roll ups will be the massive. And we all make sure that amazing.
00:45:38.749 - 00:46:12.811, Speaker A: Well, yeah, 2025 is going to be the year of abundance. Got giga gas roll ups, we got huge upgrades to the Celestia DA throughput, hopefully shipping a lot of the mammoth improvements. And yeah, it's going to be exciting to see what people can build on chain now that we're slowly but surely knocking down all the barriers. Louise, thank you so much for coming on. Very stoked to follow the. The future progress of abc. Keep, keep doing all the hard work onboarding people.
00:46:12.811 - 00:46:15.667, Speaker A: The modular stack. Cheers.
00:46:15.731 - 00:46:27.027, Speaker B: Sure, sure. Sloth price, floor price. 1 million is my prediction for 2025 as well. Right. So undisturbed. And you can never have mine.
00:46:27.171 - 00:46:34.385, Speaker A: Okay. Not financial advice. The things that the guests say on this show are not. Sorry. No, just kidding.
00:46:35.645 - 00:46:43.045, Speaker B: A sloth JPEG with a, with a lunch bag for its head is obviously not financial advice. Awesome.
00:46:43.085 - 00:46:52.885, Speaker A: Well, to all the sloths out there listening. Love you guys. All right, cheers everyone. Thanks for tuning in. Louie, it's great to have you on. We'll. We'll see you again soon.
