00:00:02.280 - 00:00:14.130, Speaker A: Okay, so first I'll introduce myself. Nice to meet everyone. My name is Tracy. I'm the founder of Pluto. Oh, this is a very large timer. Wow. I'm the founder of Pluto.
00:00:14.130 - 00:00:45.768, Speaker A: And as I like to put it, Pluto's building tools for a better Internet. I used to work in consumer tech, and I started focusing on crypto a few years ago because I saw some of the challenges that we had introduced into the Internet in our work. And now I'm a bit more focused on defensive tech, anonymity and individual freedom online. So today I'm going to talk a bit about Pluto. The first thing is that we've been trying to think bigger than blockchains. We're tired of thinking about block space. I don't want to talk about Mev.
00:00:45.768 - 00:01:26.838, Speaker A: I don't want to talk about bridging or account abstraction. We're trying to think about how this microcosm that we created in crypto becomes the macrocosm. Like, how do we actually do something useful instead of meme coins? I think everyone's been a bit nihilistic this week just thinking about how all this infrastructure we've created has been used to propagate meme coins. It's hard to wake up and go to work with hype when that's the best thing that you have as a use case. So I just refuse to think about it and I'm trying to think about what's better. So let's have a look at some of the problems the Internet's facing today. We'll go through four big areas that I think are challenges.
00:01:26.838 - 00:02:10.130, Speaker A: That's user sovereignty and privacy, spam fraud and misinformation. And then I'll talk about our best ideas on how to fix them. All right, the challenge is real id, fake id. So today's KYC and identity solutions, things like stripe stripe identity, Jumio Persona, they're all built on the back of valid identities. And generative models have reached a point of quality that constructing such an id is possible, and fast. So is this a real id or is this a fake id? It's a fake id. So there remains some safeguards here.
00:02:10.130 - 00:02:33.154, Speaker A: And this is generated in like 2 seconds. So you can just spin up another one of these, like 2 seconds flat. There remains some safeguard, like safeguards. If you look at this thing, there's a number somewhere on here. It's like DL, the license id number. And actually there's this system called LexisNexis that the government works with that stores these numbers. And so you need a valid number to pass the check.
00:02:33.154 - 00:03:04.450, Speaker A: But it's not really hard to get that seven digit number these days because of so many data leaks. And once you do that, the only other block that Jumio has is that they expect you to physically hold up the thing and be able to move it around. But now that you can just make a fake one, those checks are no longer secure either. All right, number two, real person. Fake person. So, text generated from LLMs we already know is, at this point, indistinguishable from text written by a human. Soon the same will be true for voice and video.
00:03:04.450 - 00:03:34.650, Speaker A: The cost and sophistication required to make that type of material is rapidly declining. Real media. Fake media. Generative AI produces increasingly realistic video, audio, and images, so we can no longer trust our own humanity judgment to determine the correctness of this information. So imagine this scenario. You watch a video on Twitter, and you think to yourself, damn, that can't be real. Did Biden really do that? And then you attempt to investigate.
00:03:34.650 - 00:03:54.840, Speaker A: You're like, I'm a smart Internet user. Let me go to Google. Pop this in. What does CNBC say? Ultimately, you try quite hard, and you conclude that you do not know if it's real information or fake information. How many of you have actually had that experience? Okay, that's like 50%. Not quite 90. I was expecting 90.
00:03:54.840 - 00:04:37.800, Speaker A: This is a challenge. If our best Internet users, who are our most sophisticated users, literally can't figure out if the Internet's lying to them, it's a pretty tricky future. All right, my attention, your attention. Internet businesses are misaligned with their users. They are literally incentivized to produce harm to users so that they can earn the most revenue. This startling fact, youth suicide rates rose 62% from 2007 to 2021. An interesting correlation with that date range is the rise of Facebook and Instagram.
00:04:37.800 - 00:05:16.160, Speaker A: This is a pretty dystopian reality that we've constructed. The Internet was started as a utopian place of interoperability and user sovereignty, but now we've entered an era of kings and peasants on the Internet. The power to exit and interoperate is missing. So just a review of the landscape. We have surveillance and walled gardens that users cannot exit, and the systems actively exploit them. We have fraudental, we have spam, we have misinformation. So what are our best solutions today? I touched on these a little bit, but I'll go in a bit more detail.
00:05:16.160 - 00:05:55.328, Speaker A: So, for fraud, they employ many techniques. Today, they use deep neural nets based on videos of users to try and determine if it's a real person with a valid id. So you'll be asked to hold up your license in front of the camera. And there's literally a neural net like monitoring how you move it, the sheen on the license, your eyes where they're looking and trying to determine if you're a real person. And this is about as good as it gets in terms of what we can do with fraud and the computers of today without cryptography, spam and misinformation. So our best techniques for spam are account gating. Charge $8 to make an account that raises the floor.
00:05:55.328 - 00:06:17.450, Speaker A: But it's not the best solution. If you really want to spread misinformation and spam, you're willing to pay $8. We also have Captcha. Captcha is broken. We also have content moderation. This is a room full of, well, probably philippine people who are trying to moderate all of this content. And it's an infamously horrible job for misinformation.
00:06:17.450 - 00:06:38.322, Speaker A: We have community notes, which has been reasonably successful, Google fact check and a few other things. Cool. But I also don't want this to be all doom and gloom, so we'll get into some solutions. All right, let's talk surveillance and interoperability. So this is one of my favorite meme coins. Thanks, Jomi. We have some progress on this.
00:06:38.322 - 00:07:09.650, Speaker A: We have private messaging like signal and telegram, which have become prolific. And I think that's an underestimated awesome reality. It wasn't obvious ten years ago that we would have end to end encrypted messaging. We also have enclaves in our phones. You can attest to arbitrary code on your apple and Android device, and we have blockchains. This is a blockchain conference, after all. As we're well aware, blockchains have their challenges and limitations, but they have carved a path for user sovereignty, privacy, and the power to exit.
00:07:09.650 - 00:07:48.038, Speaker A: So is there a problem? Yes. User surveillance, rampant fraud prevention is robust, but the rate is increasing and spam and misinformation are difficult. Let's talk about emerging solutions. So what about fraud and spam? So we've seen some progress here. We have proof of humanity, right? This is built by Worldcoin. It's a first principles approach and it's really powerful technology. They built a hardware device that can scan your eyes and collect user identifying info.
00:07:48.038 - 00:08:22.722, Speaker A: It's a little bit scary because people do worry about the privacy concerns of scanning your retinas. But ultimately they have invested really heavily in making sure that that data cannot be leaked and is not of value without direct access to the hardware. There's also signed identity documents, right? So passports now have an NFC chip that have your signed data in it. And you can also compose attestations. You could take this data out of a signed identity document and other sources, compose it together and make some form of identity. That's promising. We also have some techniques for misinformation.
00:08:22.722 - 00:09:03.470, Speaker A: There's attested sensors, the idea of your voice being recorded or your picture being taken and having an attestation to it. There's verifiable modification of images. So you may have an image on one site, needs some edits imported to another site. You could imagine a green checkmark for content correctness around the Internet, or content authenticity and provenance. And there's this idea of perceptual hashing. So that's monitoring or like measuring content similarity between different images. All of these are useful for just tracking the provenance of information and propagating it forward and then emerging techniques for exit.
00:09:03.470 - 00:09:36.608, Speaker A: So this is what Pluto's been focused on. It's cryptography tools for users of web two systems. And if these tools are powerful enough, it gives users the ability to exit these walled gardens and evade surveillance. So how can the Internet thrive? We need the best part of blockchains to apply to the entire Internet, not just blockchains. That means we need to give users the power to exit systems, giving them sovereignty and privacy. We need to solve the Sybil problem with robust privacy preserving digital identity. We need to build a chain of trust for content providence.
00:09:36.608 - 00:10:01.080, Speaker A: This gives you authenticity and we need to create shared protocols for information and user quality. This gives you interoperability. These are the things we wanted out of the Internet before it started falling apart. So what is Pluto? Pluto is building web proofs. They're like a bridge. Not a blockchain bridge, but a tool for data portability between data sources on the Internet. They are privacy preserving and authenticated.
00:10:01.080 - 00:10:41.472, Speaker A: This screen keeps going out, so I'm like forced to go back here. They give users information sovereignty and the power to exit these systems. If you can prove a fact that's in a central database, you can extract it from that database and take it somewhere else. And they also give you the power to create new markets. If you can prove that valuable data and that database was transferred to a counterparty, you can use that proof to create a market on chain, or even with another web proof on the other side to create with standard financial rails in market. So one idea we're exploring is the ability to sell your Twitter account without trusting a counterparty. But that's just the start of you can have on and off ramps.
00:10:41.472 - 00:11:28.520, Speaker A: Without KYC, you can sell domains. Without a counterparty, you can sell a tweet, you can sell any valuable digital information in the web two world. So how does this work? Well, we hijack the tools of the existing Internet, specifically TL's. TL's is a protocol that powers 80% of Internet traffic, and we can't get rid of it without TL's and PKI, the Internet does not work. You can't input your credit card without PKI. It's fundamental. And if we mix that protocol with some novel cryptography, we can create a proof that you received some data from a server, and the client who received the data cannot lie about the exact data.
00:11:28.520 - 00:12:09.500, Speaker A: And you can use this proof to transport information from one Webdo system to another. It effectively transforms a web server into something like a blockchain. The only then trust remaining in that system is, did Google put the right data in the database? Did Twitter put the right data in the database? Now, there are some limitations there, but it's a start. So what does Pluto believe? We believe that cryptography tools chart the course to a thriving Internet. And we have a master plan. Our master plan is to nerd snipe people on web proofs, use a web proof, bring data on chain, create a new market, create a new application. That's what we're here for.
00:12:09.500 - 00:12:45.968, Speaker A: We can use that to break walled gardens in the Internet, and we can create novel markets for exiting those systems and monetize that capability. And using that money, we can R and D more cryptography and web proofs start to break Internet market structures and more cryptography will finish the job. MPC allows for collaboration, fhe for offline collaboration. And in doing so, you can change the Internet economics. And if you change the Internet's economics, you change the Internet. So thank you all for listening. I'm available for some questions.
