00:00:02.040 - 00:00:31.760, Speaker A: All right. Hello, everyone. I'm sorry, you have to bear with my chorus voice for a little bit. And today we have on stage a set of interesting contributors from different ecosystems, primarily focused on application ecosystem, as well as our base layer protocol, our researchers from the EFDE. I feel like maybe someone else moderates better.
00:00:32.380 - 00:00:53.222, Speaker B: You want me to moderate this? Hi. Welcome, everybody. I also have a coarse voice, but maybe it sounds better because it's deeper, whereas normally my voice is much higher, so it's kind of sensual. All right, welcome, everybody. Welcome to this panel. Thank you, Tina, for bringing us all together. We had some efers, we had some application layer people.
00:00:53.222 - 00:00:55.370, Speaker B: Why don't we go down the line and introduce ourselves?
00:00:55.670 - 00:01:21.890, Speaker C: Sure. Hey, I'm Anska. I'm a researcher at Ethereum foundation. I've been doing a bunch of different things, most recently looking both into the kind of staking economics and overall staking system for Ethereum, but then also worked on roll call, which is an attempt of basically trying to coordinate EVM based L2 s and give them help in moving beyond the base layer evm. Yeah.
00:01:21.930 - 00:01:27.870, Speaker D: I'm Vitalik, also at the Ethereum foundation, also researching a bunch of things.
00:01:29.450 - 00:01:44.116, Speaker E: Well, well, hi, my name is, and I'm from CTO of Math Network. We work on from, like, we're on social in general, from like, front end application to protocols to infrastructures.
00:01:44.188 - 00:01:44.372, Speaker F: So.
00:01:44.396 - 00:01:59.680, Speaker G: Yeah, yeah. Hi, everyone. I'm Matt, co founder of Caldera. We are rollups as a service platform. We help a lot of people launch customized l two s and l three s. Today I'm up here to represent some of the gaming projects that we work with, including ape chain.
00:02:00.300 - 00:02:19.280, Speaker F: Hi, my name is Mankoto. I'm from Ens name service. We have recently announced the plan for ENsP two, which is moving core parts into L2. So I'm excited to join here to learn and what's the best way.
00:02:19.900 - 00:02:33.880, Speaker B: Hi, I'm Ken. I do research at the Uniswap foundation. Uniswap swaps things. Cool, fun. Do we dive in?
00:02:34.740 - 00:03:02.500, Speaker A: Yeah. So maybe just to spice it up a little bit. So for all of the application ecosystem, or if you consider yourself part of that ecosystem, what is. What is, what's the usage of your ecosystem? You can choose your favorite metrics. Let's go. And who are your primary users?
00:03:04.080 - 00:03:45.606, Speaker B: Cool. Let's start backwards. Primary users. So Uniswap is cool, right? Because Uniswap technically can be for anyone. Uniswap is about access, and it's about access and sort of the ability for everyone around the world to be able to have liquidity, to swap with each other and to use any tokens, kind of do with it what you want. And so with Uniswap V four, I think like one thing that sort of shifts the framing here is like, instead of thinking about Uniswap as a product and thinking about how we swap with each other, how we make LP's more profitable, Uniswap thinks more about V four. You think more about order flow as the product.
00:03:45.606 - 00:04:30.100, Speaker B: Right. How do you actually use liquidity as a way to change the way you're thinking about order flow? What is the order flow that you're doing and how you're actually expanding the scope of what that is? So for us, I guess SV four sort of expands with more hooks and sort of more integrations. We're not really thinking of users as just like a retail user who's just swapping ETH USDC, but really thinking about everyone else who wants to do new things on uniswap. Right. It's more of what if your LP was like a margin call, right? What if you actually have KYC pools for real world assets? This is a fundamentally different net, new market we're bringing access to for anyone in the world.
00:04:32.120 - 00:04:49.620, Speaker F: Okay. Yeah. So EnS is probably one of the oldest running dapps. We launched in 2017, may the fourth. May 4 is the way to remember. And yeah, we. So the usage number.
00:04:49.620 - 00:05:30.008, Speaker F: One of the great thing about Dappsense smart contract is everything on chain. So I just look into geo analytics and currently we have over 2 million active names. The one point is, again, our name will expire if you don't renew. So in total we had more registrations, but for the active one is 2 million. And I think we have about 800,000 unique addresses which point to EnS name. That's on chain matrix. We also have some sort of things called chain resolver, which allows you to basically doing anything on layer one is very expensive nowadays.
00:05:30.008 - 00:06:04.220, Speaker F: So one of the kind of L2 strategies, we introduce something called off chain resolver, which allows you to store the data not just on chain, but anywhere. So it could be L2, it could be of chain. So perfect example. I think uni, uni have uni east, and then you issue sub names to, I think, hundreds, thousands of users and also CP, ID, Coinbase. I think they have like several million users, but they are currently storing on, I think, their database. So we don't have the on chain matrix, but over million is something we've had.
00:06:05.800 - 00:06:38.990, Speaker G: Yeah, because I'm kind of here representing the conglomerate of gaming projects in our ecosystem. I don't have a lot of the metrics offhand, but one of the things I will say is that when we work with gaming projects, they're often interested in all sorts of different types of users. There's the highly crypto native on chain users, but there's also a bunch. Maybe there are some users who interact on chain, but they're only really there to hold, buy and sell nfts. And there are a bunch of other users who, you know, may or may not even know that they're using, you know, a project that interfaces with the blockchain.
00:06:40.330 - 00:07:50.668, Speaker E: So we're doing social and then we consider everybody as our users if you're doing really like behaving in society. And then, so we started from a browser extension that allows users to send encryption messages on like major social platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Because like we thought, like these web two social players are just like using our data and about our privacy to want to make something to fight against them. So we started from a browser extension and then we brought in a lot of users onto this encrypted web or encrypted social. And then we just connect with Ethereum and then connect with the blockchain so that these users are also able to directly interact with smart contracts where any on chain assets directly within their timeline on Twitter and Facebook. So it's more like enhanced timeline for users to better behave on chain world. And our best estimation of total number of users is within 100k who have ever downloaded our extension.
00:07:50.668 - 00:08:46.430, Speaker E: But we are also doing a lot of web3 and web two identity aggregation. And we have like at least 500 to can't remember clearly, but bindings between like, you know, awe two identity, two non web3 identity, which is like a double store. I was like a double edge store because like on one hand you can get really great like information regarding some like, you know, web two and web3 user connections. But on the other hand, it's like a huge privacy issue here because like you can easily be, you know, social engineered through this information. So we are trying to find a way to fight against this or find the balance or find the trade off between convenience and a privacy or like secure social world. Okay, that would be all for my answer.
00:08:47.570 - 00:09:59.250, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, I guess, you know, users of Ethereum include, I mean, definitely still a lot of direct users, a lot of L2 protocols and some applications. So it probably ends up being a mix of all three. I mean, obviously originally Ethereum was kind of 100% just like people building applications directly on top of it and doing everything there. But then over time, more and more has been starting to happen through the layer, through the L2 ecosystem. But I think base layers definitely have a much more low level relationship to stuff that happens on the user layer. It's kind of like if you're c, it's hard to design c in ways that's opinionated on issues of privacy, for example. I mean, I don't think blockchains are quite as low level as c, but I think they're somewhat more in that direction relative to some of the closer to user stuff that other people are working on.
00:09:59.250 - 00:10:02.710, Speaker D: Though I do personally think about closer to user stuff as well.
00:10:04.450 - 00:10:35.680, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that's pretty much covering it, I think basically. Well, with the modular approach of Ethereum right now, basically you can think of Ethereum as the ecosystem, and then our users are hopefully a lot, basically all of the above, basically. Or then you can think of monarchy, of just the base chain, which basically, really just the root of the ecosystem. And then of course, yes, basically the users become in a way over time more boring because they're mostly just management operations for the higher level actual user activity.
00:10:38.580 - 00:10:59.520, Speaker A: Well said. Well, so I have a question for Vitalik again. So in 2013 to 14, Ethereum white paper characterized it as a next generation smart contract and decentralized application platform. So it seems to have changed, maybe.
00:11:00.300 - 00:11:05.720, Speaker D: Oh, I see. Because we're now a smart contract and decentralized application platform platform.
00:11:07.830 - 00:11:22.490, Speaker A: Something like that. So, and also during in the white paper, you laid out a few lovely examples. Why was storage an application?
00:11:23.270 - 00:12:14.420, Speaker D: Yeah. So the whole decentralized storage thing, I feel like that's like one of the under loved parts of the original vision, right? Basically, yeah. You know, a lot of people have needs to store stuff and I mean, there's different kinds of storage. There's like backup of your hard drive, there's like, you know, like hosting like static web pages, there's some of everything in between, but there was like, there's centralized providers for all of this stuff. But you know, it would be nice if we had decentralized providers. And the nice thing about crypto is that you could have these very direct incentive markets where you just directly pay people to store stuff for you. And this was something that I was very excited about as a use case back then.
00:12:14.420 - 00:13:39.262, Speaker D: I think it definitely does end up being pretty challenging to provide in practice, basically, because essentially for redundancy, you need data to be stored in multiple places, ideally you need some kind of assurance that the different places your data is being stored is like actually I'm kind of politically independent and not just like architecturally independent. And so there's like this big rabbit hole and then people like Filecoin ended up trying to solve the problem part way for at least some use cases. I do think that we should actually go back and try harder to solve some of that stuff basically because specifically I think for the use case of storing content for dapps, I think for personal files, realistically we literally have 1 tb USB keys. I actually saw these once. I was going to one of those crazy electronics stores in Taipei that just has some of everything on every floor and they got the drones and the cables and everything. I saw this thing for the first time. It's a USB key and it said 1 tb on it.
00:13:39.262 - 00:14:11.610, Speaker D: And I'm like whoa. That's basically the only thing I have that I need to store that can match that are basically exactly two things. One is AI models and the second is blockchain blockchains. And for blockchains we need to implement EIP 4444 yesterday. So big cheers to everyone who's still actually working on doing that. And then after that stateless clients and so on. But that's a bit of a digression.
00:14:11.610 - 00:15:15.106, Speaker D: But the point is I think the storing your own pictures use cases less necessary because I actually think it's getting easier and easier to just store all of your own pictures locally if that's what you want. But for dapps, I saw, I think what was that Dapp that got hacked? Whose website got hacked yesterday? I forget it was compound that was the one. Basically we have this trust chain that's much crappier than it needs to be on a whole bunch of ways. What we do need, I think is like it's time to bring back myst. Right? Like who here remembers mist? You know the, you know the ethereum web browser, right? Yeah. So you know we need to bring back mist, right? And then inside of mystic, you know, like you need to actually let people go to like, you know, like Dap name Dot Eth. And then like that dot eth on ens you actually have a hash and then the, you have an IPfs like record and you actually download the content.
00:15:15.106 - 00:16:04.976, Speaker D: You actually check the content against the hash. And then the ENS thing itself needs to be controlled by some kind of multisig or even some kind of DaO directly. And so you have this actual trust chain that you would have to follow. So there isn't this one single thing that you can hack and then just immediately and even undetectably start serving people a web page that just grabs all of their assets. But the point is for that to happen, one of the really valuable things to have is to have DAP content storage that is independent of specific servers and like having better infrastructure for that. I feel like I have to say the full word infrastructure because the word infra is like maximum cringe. So infrastructure to actually do that.
00:16:04.976 - 00:16:12.192, Speaker D: Right. And then that actually increases the security of the ecosystem.
00:16:12.256 - 00:16:39.008, Speaker A: Yeah, speaking of the security of the ecosystem, back in the days when uniswap first started, the immutability was super important and things seems to have changed quite a lot. So why has Dapps evolved? Like, what has changed over the years? This is a question for katief well.
00:16:39.024 - 00:17:19.480, Speaker B: This is really interesting and just a little bit of preface, I've cornered both of these guys about this, but it's this heavy financialization of where we are in Defi and Ethereum, and there's now a lot of liquidity. There's a lot of money that comes in and out. There's a lot of money that sits on Ethereum. And I think we're afraid to say the words mev. We don't want to talk about that. But it's such a big thing, right? We are like, we're so afraid of it being exploitative. And in many ways it is exploitative, but also it's natural market efficiency that exists with how blockchains are created or specifically for Ethereum.
00:17:19.480 - 00:18:20.742, Speaker B: And it's tough, I think when you think about Uniswap users, you think about the retail users who are using app, uniswap.org, who are using banana botanical or just telegram bots in general. And it's tough because when you, the people who are trading on telegram bots, which is not an insignificant amount of people, it's like twelve and a half, they're 15% of market share. They're giving their private keys to telegram bots, being like, yeah, let me buy insert coin. And just like, you know, it's really tough for uniswap to kind of like, see this happen, get picked off, and like, the degeneracy keeps going. So I think one of the things that I've been super anxious about is, okay, over the last couple days, we've been talking about how liquidity on amms is moving off of Ethereum. And I guess if liquidity moves off Ethereum because of mev, it sort of moves applications or defi applications off Ethereum.
00:18:20.742 - 00:19:06.750, Speaker B: And I think I know what some people would say. Maybe it's good that dapps move off Ethereum and we move it to l two, but it sort of does lose some of the economic security of what Ethereum kind of upholds it. Also, you kind of lose the sort of like the, I guess, the ability for people to freely kind of build on Ethereum the same way. Right? Because you lose the composability, you lose the interop, or at least you create more friction of actually letting users build on top and use these applications. Again, for Uniswap, we're looking to provide access to everyone. And if we move it off ethereum, move it onto l two s, it's creating more static friction. To be able to get started, the onboarding stuff needs to get created.
00:19:06.750 - 00:19:28.404, Speaker B: And then the dirty word, the infra, with negative incentives, please don't attack me after this. But the incentives are such so that the infra actually becomes even more fragmented so the users have even less of an ability to, able to transact on what I think should be freely accessible. But it's tough. I don't know. I'm curious to see how everyone else thinks about it.
00:19:28.532 - 00:19:35.660, Speaker A: I'm curious, what is the big picture? Guy Ensgar, think about liquidity moving off chain.
00:19:35.740 - 00:20:10.568, Speaker C: Wow. Well, I mean, moving off chain, we're saying just moving upwards. So that does make a difference. And I agree that if we have to be realistic, that today that does come with a hit to interoperability and even security and all these things. But of course, I think that is the bullet we have to bite to get to scalability at this point. Blockchain scalability, that's been a topic that's been around for ten years or something. I think we understand the design space pretty well, and you have to make some tough choices.
00:20:10.568 - 00:20:54.236, Speaker C: And I think basically we are right now in this process, l one is just not big enough for everyone to do all the things. Even if we try very hard, it's just not. And so we have to do the one time, go through the one time painful process of making l two feel basically like l one. And we can totally get there. Like, I think we are right now maybe halfway there in terms of both user friendliness and interoperability and everything, but then also, of course, security. But there is a clear path to that. And so if we just, if we basically, it's like a little bit of narrow path where on one end, of course, we can't ignore all the complaints because those are valid complaints, but at the same time, I think we still have to be to trust that that path is the right path.
00:20:54.236 - 00:21:02.812, Speaker C: And I think if we get that right, then the end outcome will be just the same as one, just much, much more scalable, basically.
00:21:02.996 - 00:22:00.746, Speaker B: But I guess it's nothing. I guess we're not really seeing that right. Like, a lot of research is really pushing us to kind of, like, get Ethereum to be more creative around how we're dealing with Mev. And so a lot of the research is focused on what I think is actually, like, more centralizing forces and creates more, I don't know, more surface area around, like, how we're capturing for validators, which is not a bad thing. But it also, like, doesn't stop, essentially the problem that we're trying to solve here, which is, like, if we think MeV is exploitative, we're creating new mechanisms to kind of move it around, shift in different places, but it still doesn't change the paradigm of where uniswap is, where the users are, and the negative externalities that we'd want to prevent and moving everyone off chain. I think we're not solving the problem here, and I think it's tough to reconcile with. Do you know what I mean?
00:22:00.898 - 00:22:38.086, Speaker C: I mean, yes and no, but I think basically we have to. The way I think about it is that just because we have this very modular approach in Ethereum and also this very actual decentralized approach, that basically there are all these different subproblems and they're different people that have different groups that have to solve different problems. I think with Mev, we're seeing this very encouraging trend now of more and more apps actually being smarter about preventing MeV or capturing that themselves or something, basically. So it never actually hits the protocol level. Right. But I personally, for example, like, in my own research, I don't think about MeV much at all.
00:22:38.118 - 00:22:38.238, Speaker B: Right?
00:22:38.254 - 00:22:56.110, Speaker C: So, like, I think we are pretty good at, like, having compartmentalized different research streams and everything. And I don't. I don't really, I don't think I agree with your criticism that basically there's no progress on, you know, like, I guess when you say off chain, like, I would not call, like, if someone.
00:22:56.150 - 00:22:57.502, Speaker D: Moves from elbows or not off chain.
00:22:57.526 - 00:22:58.486, Speaker C: It's not off chain.
00:22:58.598 - 00:23:11.470, Speaker B: Sorry. No, no. Well, so, so people are not moving. Well, I guess the thing is, like, they're not just moving to l two s. They're actually moving off chain with, like, private market makers with. With a lot of these things. It's not necessarily just.
00:23:11.470 - 00:23:24.370, Speaker B: Just l two s. And I know, again, like, please, no disrespect, I love you guys very deeply, but I definitely am not criticizing research in that direction. I guess my point is just like, why can't we have both?
00:23:24.750 - 00:24:01.438, Speaker C: But, okay, just last thing. And I don't want to, but I do think actually there's an important point here that blockchains, in a way, they're magical, but they also have a very, very powerful tool, and you don't always need the most powerful tool, basically. For example, in the very early days, what Dapps often did was just store everything they needed just into storage. And at some point, storage became nothing free anymore because actual adoption picked up and then you had to be a little bit smart. Wait, do I really have to put that into storage? Can I just have that be off chain, you know, indexed and then I can just like get it because I only need it in the interface anyway. It's not relevant for my trust assumptions. Right.
00:24:01.438 - 00:24:38.050, Speaker C: And so basically, I think we are in that process where basically we had this magical new tool, and in the beginning we used it in the simplest way possible. And now that we are getting more and more sophisticated, it really, I think it's in a way, like an art of like using this kind of trust anchor that the l one is in basically the most lightweight way possible without losing, without compromising your trust assumptions. And I think that's not a bad thing. I think that's actually in a way, like, it's a beautiful thing. And I think it is inevitable if you want to really make the most out of, you know, the technology. Vitalik to you, I have some.
00:24:40.630 - 00:24:42.570, Speaker D: Sorry, I just forgot what my point is.
00:24:43.640 - 00:25:13.144, Speaker A: Well, so we actually have quite a few presentations or conversations about this. Later on, I want to actually turn to the, our app and app roll up developers. What are your considerations? What goes through your mind? Like, when you choose what to do? There's so many choices today. Why do you launch a roll up and why do you design it?
00:25:13.192 - 00:26:04.424, Speaker F: Why do we launch a roll up chain or we just go to l two or both? Okay. Yeah. So in our case, we just had a ens on conference on Monday where we invited lots of players from like Rob, service provider to the end users. And currently we are still open minded. We could go just deploy to existing public L2 chain, or we could deploy our own and actually some teams, I think axiom even suggested we should have our own vm. So like custom rollout, not even EVM. So we have, we are kind of experimenting from the diverse range and in our specific use case, one thing you need, I guess Enos is slightly different from all the other l two use cases because still most people use it in a context of defi where liquidity matters.
00:26:04.424 - 00:26:53.284, Speaker F: And quite often when, for example, a fraud proof based roll up, even though there is a seven days challenge period, there's a ways to walk around because it's a fungible token. So whenever you can put the value and the stuff, someone commented, put a crowd draw, whereas NFT is inherently more difficult. So that and yeah, that's one thing. And also in our case, again, most DeFi or any change actually base model of the L2 is about most of the case. You just create a copy of what you are doing l one on l two and you just have an exact replica of the same thing everywhere. Whereas in our case, we basically need to cater for every chain like, you know, for the simple usage of name resolution. So in our case, just copy.
00:26:53.284 - 00:27:42.172, Speaker F: And making a copy doesn't really help in terms of name resolution. So we actually developed something, our own kind of interoperable protocol called EIP 3889, aka CCIP read almost like three, four years ago. And that actually uses ens, sorry, layer one as the entry point that most people, because pretty much all the Dapps have a connection if it's EVM compatible, you have a connection to layer one. And the current nightmare is like whatever, whichever usage you need to figure out which chain is and you have to change network. Our protocol, our framework abstract that. So you always use l one as entry point. But we have a ways to proxy to get the data from other chains.
00:27:42.172 - 00:28:48.390, Speaker F: And to do that we use storage proof of the Ethereum data storage. And also we design use waste mostly like hooking up the existing roll up mechanism that where all every roll up tend to store the state route of the entire l two on the l one. So we our framework use it to check that fits the storage proof and verify on chain. By that nature we actually need a finality to the l one. So most people if you have seven days gap window there's way to walk around. But in our case we directly hook into the roab score mechanism so that faster finite if it's seven days, if there's a seven days period, if you set the data on L2, you need to wait seven days, which is almost unusable. So we are really, I think we had a, people sometimes say like faster finite is important but there's a lot to work around like liquidity or like a pre conformation all that stuff.
00:28:48.390 - 00:29:59.470, Speaker F: But we are kind of our design constraints to really challenge L2 to have that fast fine id yeah, that's fasting. And another thing is decentralization and the censorship resistance that when ENS first launched, it was pre dao. So that came in 2021. So when it first came out in 2017, we had a seven multi seg, which had quite a lot of power of like, I think the biggest power was like, if seven people multi sig agreed they could override your name. But in the very beginning it was very important because we are not sure how stable our smart contract is. And as time progressed, we gradually actually killed these features to the point that we still have multi sig, but doesn't have much capability to do. But now when it goes to L2, there's still lots of area where it uses like, centralized sequences, or even if there are many players working on centralized sequences, then if it's the gauge and what happened to the provers can prove us be, you know, so that, so there is a.
00:29:59.470 - 00:30:20.110, Speaker F: We have a, we start seeing, I think the last part our founder, Nick Johnson mentioned. Our conference is, okay, we spend so much time to decentralize ourselves and then we don't want to give back to the square one. So that's security. And fast forward is our top priority when choosing to, whether we pick our own l two or just deploy to someone else's.
00:30:21.850 - 00:30:27.610, Speaker A: Thank you. That's super thorough. Anything to share? What about the apecoin community?
00:30:28.070 - 00:32:05.006, Speaker G: Yeah, so I think apecoin is very interesting where they're trying to do a lot of things to improve both the user and developer experience in kind of like somewhat sort of degen, very creative ways. They're working on native yield, which is, of course, an increasingly common conversation that we're having since blast, introduce that into the ecosystem. Another thing that we're looking at very closely is the idea of separate gas markets for different applications. One of the big issues that a lot of teams in the gaming ecosystems face is that they have to constantly hop from chain to chain to chain because one chain will get saturated, gas prices will explode, and then they need to move. And so we're investigating kind of two potential approaches here, one of which is, yeah, like dedicated gas markets, or allocating a specific proportion of like, the total throughput of the chain to specific applications to make sure that they at least always have kind of like a dedicated lane on the chain that they can use. And another one, which I think is going to be more impactful for long term scaling of the ecosystem, is this idea of launching multiple different chains within an ecosystem that are all highly interoperable with each other. Sort of like, I don't know, like a mini sort of super chain between all of these different chains with really, really strong interoperabilities, sorry, properties that allows assets to move across them really quickly.
00:32:05.006 - 00:33:12.520, Speaker G: And that'll allow new teams that enter this ecosystem to rapidly spin up new chains that still feel kind of part of this one community that don't feel like they're spinning up an entirely new thing. I think in general, when we see a lot of teams that are working on new roll ups, it's always a bit of a balance between highly. You can call it creative, you can call it Degen protocol development. I think one of the really cool things about l two is that it allows you to do permissionless protocol level innovation. The tricky thing there is making sure that those things are fundamentally sound, or at least everything won't go to shit immediately. And we work with all sorts of different teams, some of which aren't necessarily super web3 native, who come to us with pretty fundamental questions like why do we even need gas on the chain? And then that opens up all these other conversations around spam protection. What happens if a bunch of developers come on, a bunch of users come on? So it helps us challenge a lot of our initial assumptions.
00:33:12.520 - 00:33:25.160, Speaker G: We think generally we can get to a good spot where we're not too afraid of thing going up and failing on day one. But yeah, there's just a lot of very interesting innovations happening.
00:33:25.900 - 00:33:45.580, Speaker A: Just a follow up question for both Ens and maybe and other communities. What's the decision making like cycle? Like, how early do people start thinking about it? How long, how close do you think a decision is even made? Because it's a community.
00:33:46.920 - 00:34:34.210, Speaker F: Yeah, in our case, I think we start looking into L2 area back in 2020. I think when, I think Vitalik wrote a blog post called App is it roll up centric thing? And I think initially that dictates coming up with our current EIP 368 framework. That was about three months before we had a monthly call and we invited people from ZKC, arbitram, optimism. And Vitalik came a couple of times, and that was a pre dawg moment. So it was very, very small community. It was easy to make a decision now. So I'm from ENS Lab, which is a company responsible for launching the initial protocol and the DAO as well.
00:34:34.210 - 00:35:33.170, Speaker F: But last November, actually, community presented like, well, actually now DAo is there. You need to decentralize the development process as well. So we actually have a so called service providers that we, I think allocated like two or 3 million to seven different players and someone get grants of like one hundred k to seven hundred k. So something big and something small. So they also need to be involved in the decision making system. So I think around march when we have the ETH Global London, there's a lot of committee member came to talk to us and that kind of actually we were thinking about going to l two, but they had, they also really push the boundary of like, you know, we should really go for like a L2. So right after that we did a series like intense session to basically coming up with ENsP two which published I think back in May.
00:35:33.170 - 00:36:29.750, Speaker F: And again last Monday we just had a meeting and I made sure that I invite all the service provider. So final decision making will be probably become some sort of Dao governance voting because they are satisfying. You need to switch the contract. So that isn't, and most of the, I think, key thing, there are two things. First, it requires all these applications to switch to the new endpoint that doesn't require Dao governance port, but we just have to talk to all the wallets and services to go like kind of, it's not like governance, but then like there are certain contracts to change that required our governance. We don't have the timeline yet, but probably we don't want to spend like, you know, three to five years. So it should, some sort of, the decision will come in hopefully in a year time, I think.
00:36:32.250 - 00:37:28.930, Speaker G: Yeah, I think so. For us it's, it's honestly been quite similar, like dealing with very decentralized organizations. It's always like a very unique, interesting challenge opportunity. Yeah, I think for us we've seen the most important thing is to have people in the discussions that represent all the different interests, including the kind of fundamental interests in the technical soundness of the protocol. But for us it's really about making sure, you know, for organizations where like there is a strong token holder community, they feel very heard, they feel understood and they feel really excited about the direction the protocol is going. Then of course, users and developers in the community also need to feel very excited, feel like they're heard and also hopefully get that, you know, get their ideas in. And then we also found like it's definitely very, very important to have someone to kind of act as like the face of the idea to the community.
00:37:28.930 - 00:38:05.890, Speaker G: Communicating fundamental protocol upgrades is always very hard. The decision to move to your own l two or build an l two is probably often case, the most impactful, important architectural decision that any protocol will ever make. It's very, very important that someone who really understands the community can very easily strongly communicate the rationale for this and how it will benefit everybody in the community in order to get everybody on board. Because what you absolutely don't want is any sort of like fragmentation of the community or strong disagreements about the new direction.
00:38:06.950 - 00:38:16.198, Speaker A: Yeah, you see, you've been quiet. So mass has some of the coolest products in our decentralized world. Like, why not an l two already?
00:38:16.294 - 00:38:47.838, Speaker E: Yeah, we're building that now. Oh, thanks for imagining that. We haven't announced it, but we're actively researching and building our own l two ever soon. Yeah, I should have said that. But yeah, it's okay, it's okay. But yeah, I mean, like the reason why we build this like a new l two just for. So it's like more like optimizations for social is basically because like we thought it is time back in like the days like four to five years ago, we built like a mask.
00:38:47.838 - 00:39:27.758, Speaker E: We just want to build twelve users to have a better experience on the social media, on the major social networks. And then we build a lot of different toolkits for them so that they can just protect their privacy or have a better enhanced experience on these platforms. But now we just actively think for the users. So our design model is pretty easy. So we think we need to build something for the users from the user side, not from the developer side, not from the protocol issuer side. It's more like users. So we just want to bring, so the sole thing we want to do is bring more people to blockchain, especially in the social way.
00:39:27.758 - 00:40:34.150, Speaker E: So we want to build, for example, guestless transactions for sure. And then we also want to say, hey, I'm not sure if you guys know Keybase, but back in 2014, 2015 when they launched Keybase, you can actually send encrypted messages on everyone, every single person, as long as they have a Twitter handle or have an email address. Basically, just bringing these people into the game is one of the most important things to do. And also we want to allow people to send tokens to anyone, you know, maybe your mom, your grandparents. But it's seemingly like quite impossible right now because you cannot send tokens to some like a non existent address. So we are building something that we can just map all the identifier, unique identifier on some domain name and then send the token to that. And then if you can just bring a DKP to prove like you're the ownership, you're the owner of that account or at that domain address, you can just claim and then just transfer the token out.
00:40:34.150 - 00:41:10.594, Speaker E: So basically we just want to build something to allow people to use crypto more easily. And then I think we are running out of time. But I did have talk in ECC back, I can't remember, two days ago. I do have the sites for that. So if you guys are interested, I have a detailed design for that. But basically, yeah, our design model is pretty simple, just beautiful the users and make it easier for them to get on board.
00:41:10.762 - 00:41:21.110, Speaker A: That's cool. Well, you're right, we're almost out of time. But before we go out of time, very rapid round of response. Will you become bass roll up or not? Let's go.
00:41:22.130 - 00:41:23.110, Speaker B: No comment.
00:41:24.370 - 00:41:26.030, Speaker F: We're thinking about it.
00:41:26.790 - 00:41:28.410, Speaker G: Yeah, also thinking about it.
00:41:29.430 - 00:41:30.102, Speaker F: Okay.
00:41:30.206 - 00:41:36.370, Speaker D: DK, I mean, ethereum should become a based roll up on top of XRP.
00:41:39.070 - 00:41:40.130, Speaker C: Absolutely.
00:41:40.750 - 00:41:58.300, Speaker A: Well, okay, another round of. So I asked each of the, each of you to think about three most important as I'm gonna ask you to just think of one. So what is the one thing that the base layer can do for your project in the next three years?
00:42:00.640 - 00:42:01.168, Speaker C: Love.
00:42:01.264 - 00:42:05.560, Speaker B: Uniswap more deeply. Just give us a little appreciation.
00:42:05.600 - 00:42:06.144, Speaker E: A little love.
00:42:06.192 - 00:42:10.300, Speaker B: You know, that would be great because it helps all the users.
00:42:12.160 - 00:42:27.310, Speaker F: So what l one can denote lt. L1. L1. Not really. Well, just be secure, I guess. Don't get hacked.
00:42:28.290 - 00:42:33.670, Speaker G: Yeah, that was mine. I would also say let's try to keep da in settlement as cheap as possible.
00:42:34.970 - 00:42:40.550, Speaker E: Just store the most important information data on l one, please just don't span it.
00:42:41.570 - 00:42:51.250, Speaker D: Let's see, what should l one do to better accomplish, I guess my goals, I don't know, minimize the risk that it turns into a centralization dystopia.
00:42:52.990 - 00:43:02.490, Speaker C: Yeah, I think basically be the best possible settlement layer, facilitate basically a maximally secure and scalable layer. Two ecosystem as best as possible.
00:43:03.310 - 00:43:03.670, Speaker A: Cool.
00:43:03.710 - 00:43:06.290, Speaker C: While still being useful by being a swap directly.
00:43:07.750 - 00:43:11.470, Speaker A: All right, well, thank you so much for great panel.
