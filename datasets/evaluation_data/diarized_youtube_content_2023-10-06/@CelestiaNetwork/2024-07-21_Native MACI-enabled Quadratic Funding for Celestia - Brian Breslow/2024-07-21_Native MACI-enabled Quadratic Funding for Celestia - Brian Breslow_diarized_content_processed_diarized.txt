00:00:02.200 - 00:01:04.470, Speaker A: All right, well, welcome, guys. We'll leave the door open in case more people want to come in, but it won't take too much of your time. This will really be kind of like a combination of like a presentation and a demo of Macie voting. If you haven't heard of Macie voting before, it's something that stands for minimal anti collusion infrastructure. It's an acronym, MACI, and it's actually the idea of implementing this type of privacy voting has been around since 2018, where we actually originally were a research organization working alongside the Ethereum foundation to come up with this concept of Macy voting, how to bring minimal anti collusion infrastructure to crypto. And inspiration for this research you can actually find from one of the taliks original blog post. It's a very famous research article called on Collusion, where he talks about the issues with on chain voting and how privacy can, you know, increase the cost of collusion and increase voter participation in general.
00:01:04.470 - 00:01:56.236, Speaker A: So since 2018, we've been, like, researching this concept. Ethereum foundation has been very focused on like deploying this directly for the Ethereum community, and we've been very focused on figuring out how to implement this for the multi chain ecosystem. And originally, what we would do is when we finally productionize this and do a smart contract would, we would ad hoc deploy Macie smart contracts. We would ad hoc deploy Macie smart contracts on various ecosystems in their own, like native vm. So we did Macie voting rounds for EVM chains, we did Macie voting rounds for Solana, we did Macie voting rounds for cosmosm chains. But what we learned is that theres actually a number of pitfalls that come with standard Macy voting. Macy voting is very good in a few ways because it like, reduces collusion.
00:01:56.236 - 00:03:04.470, Speaker A: And on chain voting, because you don't actually know which way anyone voted. And whoever votes has no evidence that they can share with anyone of how they voted, right? So it's like, why would I pay zon to vote yes, right? I could buy zon's vote. Like, zon, here's $100 vote yes for me, right? But after you vote, you have nothing you can show me that verifies that you actually did indeed vote yes. So if I actually can never, like, be assured that you did what I paid you to do, like, I'm less likely to pay you to do it, right? Because you could have voted no and I would have no idea. And you still made a $100 no, you can't show me your wallet because, um, the votes are encrypted um, so that's basically the essence of Macie. Um, and what we wanted to do was like, find a way to make this a more modular, like, like a modular architecture to be, like, be able to bring it to the multi chain, um, and actually make it scalable. So despite Macie, like, having advantages in general, like related to on chain privacy voting, it does have a few pitfalls.
00:03:04.470 - 00:03:29.934, Speaker A: Namely that it requires an operator for the round. This macie operator needs to be technical because they actually need to be the ones to set up the round, to decrypt the votes once they get cast, to tally the votes and to re encrypt them and then post them back on chain. So not anyone can be a Macie operator. So not. Therefore, like, anyone that wants to spin up a Macy round has to first go, like, source this operator, right, which leads to friction. Yeah.
00:03:30.022 - 00:03:31.294, Speaker B: What if I want bribing?
00:03:31.422 - 00:03:32.046, Speaker A: You want what?
00:03:32.118 - 00:03:32.910, Speaker B: Bribing.
00:03:33.070 - 00:04:07.060, Speaker A: Bribing. Oh, well, I guess you can still have bribing, but I guess the bribes could be anonymous, for example. Yeah, yeah. And the other issue with Macie is that the operator actually can know the identities of the voters, right? Or at least their address identities, because they're actually the ones that are decrypting the votes, right? So while the voters can't collude, the operator can still collude. Or they could do something like just refuse to post the results of the vote. Like after they tally it, they could delay posting, or they could just refuse to post. And that's a form of collusion.
00:04:07.060 - 00:04:53.950, Speaker A: So what we did was actually figure out the best way to improve upon this and actually make this a modular architecture would be to deploy Macie as its own blockchain, which is what we did this year, which is what door Vota is, which is a cosmosmouse enabled, IBC enabled, Cosmos SDK L1. And when you have Macie deployed. And when I say Macie deployed as a blockchain, what I mean is all of our main net validators are running Macie operator sidecar software. And much in the same vein as a DyDX validator is also required to maintain the order book or through vote extensions. What's that? Through vote extensions? No, not through vote extensions. Just like as a sidecar process. Or just how a save validator, for example, has to maintain a price feeder, just like an extra piece of software.
00:04:53.950 - 00:05:33.740, Speaker A: That is one of the slashing conditions and hardware requirements of running a door vote and mainnet validator. So what this does is it creates something called operator as a service. So now someone that wants to run a Macie voting round doesn't actually have to source an operator. They can just launch it directly on our chain. And one of our mainnet validators will be the operator just through leadership selection. And then the other thing is, now that they're also, the operators of Macy rounds are the validators themselves. There's an economic incentive for them not to collude as well because they don't want to be slashed, they don't want to delay posting the results because if so, that's a slashing condition.
00:05:33.740 - 00:06:04.110, Speaker A: Okay, so that's the first thing we did right now, Macy is its own blockchain called doorboda. What we've done is we've created a basic front end for Doorvota. There's a Macie Explorer live right now. You can go on our website or you can go on the Doorvota block Explorer and see all of the active Macie voting rounds. There's also an operator ux. If you want to be your own operator, you still can. And you can just go and start up any round you want.
00:06:04.110 - 00:07:04.510, Speaker A: Long term, what we envision, like happening with the front end of Macie, right, of this voting infrastructure, is that there should be an expansion of possible front ends, right? Like, it would be great if existing governance platforms adopt Macie under the hood. There's plenty of existing governance platforms that have a lot of adoption, whether that's snapshot or Agora or Commonwealth, even something more cosmos native, like Dowdao. They could essentially all integrate, like deploy on door Vota, right? We could integrate Macie under the hood and they could like their really sexy front ends, right, that have. Existing users can essentially automatically have privacy voting by default. So that's the roadmap for expansion of our front end. And kind of, as I said, like, being an operator is a technical job. So the advent of door Vota as it's like, as a Macie blockchain is really like the zero to one innovation that makes Macie more scalable, because now anyone can run a Macie voting round without having to be technical themselves.
00:07:04.510 - 00:07:34.070, Speaker A: So that's like, this is just the point I'm trying to highlight here. We're starting to see a lot of adoption now that we have Dwarvota as its own l one, we're starting to see a lot of adoption, particularly from the Cosmos community. A lot of in person Cosmos hackathons are using Macie as judging to decide who's going to win the prize. So we recently did this for the awesome. Wasm Hackathon, which is the largest cosmosm hackathon globally. It took place in Berlin the last two years. So this is like the Macie track voting from that.
00:07:34.070 - 00:08:21.836, Speaker A: More Macie track voting from that. You can see we did a big collaboration with Compeo. And then the other really interesting, like, big adoption we've seen from the Cosmos community is via the AEZ QF program, which is actually the largest on chain privacy experiment ever in the history of web3. It's a million dollar program where over the next two years, we're going to be running ten Macie voting rounds for the Cosmos hub to fund early stage Cosmos public goods. There's a lot of public goods in Cosmos, and Cosmos doesn't have, like, a singular entity that's able to fund all of these important infrastructures. Kind of like how in Solana you would have the Solana foundation that can, like, basically bankroll a lot of the important underlying infrastructure. There's not really, like one place or one organization in Cosmos that does this.
00:08:21.836 - 00:08:58.128, Speaker A: So we said, why don't we throw it to the community? And now the community is actually voting via Macie on which important public goods in Cosmos should receive continuation funding or what early stage projects should get some startup funding. And that's what's happening here. So over a million addresses are eligible to vote in this round. And we're doing ten rounds. As I said, we just kicked off the second round, and these were the results from the first round. After one round, we already had over 18,000 unique votes. The round and over 2000 individual voters signed up that were Cosmos hub stakers to participate in this program.
00:08:58.128 - 00:09:57.426, Speaker A: So just in this first round, we distributed just over $100,000 worth of public goods funding to early stage Cosmos projects. Now, something really exciting, and why I am particularly giving this workshop here at Modular Summit is because we are actually bringing Macy voting natively to Celestia. We recently concluded the infinite Space Bazaar Hackathon with Celestia, which was the very first global virtual celestia hackathon. And all of those hackathon winners have now been shortlisted to participate in the very first community funding, like Macie Round. So basically, what happens now is all of these winners, right, from all the different tracks, the build whatever track, the UX track and the core track, they are actually the going to be eligible to receive continuation funding. An additional $10,000 worth of continuation funding to, like, help them finalize their mvp, help them reach full production. And the distribution of this funding is going to be decided via TIa stakers.
00:09:57.426 - 00:10:25.340, Speaker A: So all of all TIA stakers are allow listed to vote in this Macy voting round. Their voting power is decided upon their individual stake weight. It's people that stake more Celestia are able to have more of an impact. And this is all done via privacy voting. Macie on door Votas L1. And if you scan that QR code right there and you're a celestial staker, you'll be able to vote. And I'll also show you how to vote after this presentation's over.
00:10:25.340 - 00:10:45.778, Speaker A: So, yeah, so I just wanted to share that. And if you haven't voted in the AAZQF program I mentioned already, you can do that too. This is the largest program. Hopefully Celestia beats this record and becomes the largest. Maybe. But for now, this is still the largest and it's ongoing. As I said, I think you already saw that.
00:10:45.778 - 00:11:07.670, Speaker A: Now, the last thing I want to mention, because I think I covered two of the three issues I mentioned. If you remember the beginning of this presentation, I said there was basically three shortfalls with vanilla Macie. Right. First is that not everyone can be an operator. It's a technical job, so it's hard to spin up a Mac round. And I said, we solved that. We made it more scalable by actually having the validators themselves be the operators.
00:11:07.670 - 00:11:41.970, Speaker A: Therefore, anyone can spend a Macy round and we have this operator as a service infrastructure. The second issue I said is that operators can collude, meaning they can delay posting the results. And obviously, if the operators are validators, they're economically incentivized not to do that anymore because they would get slashed. The last thing I mentioned is that operators know the identities of the voters still like they're the one group where the votes aren't fully private from. And what we're solving and how we're solving that is something called anonymous Macie. Right, right there. Which is a macy for short.
00:11:41.970 - 00:12:31.276, Speaker A: That's right. So with a Macie, this is actually just a technical improvement of the like, tech, like of the base infrastructure itself, where now when people sign up to be a voter, because the way it works is you don't just vote directly in the round, it's two steps. You sign up, right? You connect your wallet and you sign up as a voter. And then once you're signed up, then you cast your vote. The way Amacy works is immediately after signing up, your address is immediately scrambled before the operator actually sees it. So it adds a layer of obfuscation in so that not even the operator knows the addresses of the voters. So it solves like those three main hurdles with vanilla, Macy and Amacy is what we're going to start sharing a lot more of if you follow door factory on Twitter, the way that technology works, we're starting to get more technical workshops on that, too.
00:12:31.276 - 00:13:09.742, Speaker A: But those are the three major things. How do you scramble it? Yeah, it's actually, hopefully can be more automated in the future, but the way it works now is still kind of like a user input. The user signs up and then the user actually has to manually deactivate their vote and then reactivate it. And when they reactivate it, it turns into a new address. So it still requires user input to scramble it. But hopefully in the future, what we're working on, shipping is just a system where it automatically is immediately scrambled without the user having to take that extra step. Yeah.
00:13:09.742 - 00:13:19.282, Speaker A: So that's kind of the end of Macie and Amacy and Doorvota context wise. And I just would love to take the opportunity to also just show you this in action. What's that?
00:13:19.386 - 00:13:22.350, Speaker B: Who came up with all of this? Oh, it wasn't Chris.
00:13:24.050 - 00:13:47.830, Speaker A: No, Chris is a smart guy. So this is like our existing front end right now. I already connected my wallet. It's a Kepler address. And this is kind of how the community will see it, right, when they come to vote in this community funding round. They come here, they can see all the options on the left hand side. These are all the winners of the Celestia infinite space.
00:13:47.830 - 00:14:01.610, Speaker A: Bizarre hackathon. Right. And obviously improvements can be made. This is just like a simple, portable front end. Like, improvements can be made to this quite easily. But we were more focused on the actual chain first. But this is what we have for now.
00:14:01.610 - 00:14:15.136, Speaker A: And this is basically what they'll see when they come to want to vote. So you'll come connect your wallet. And here's what I said. You'll sign up to vote. It's coring my wallet right now. It sees that based on the amount of slash I have staked, I have a voting power of 50. Right.
00:14:15.136 - 00:14:22.680, Speaker A: This is variable depending on how much Tia is staked by that person, because how much you have staked depends on your voting power. So I'll sign up.
00:14:22.800 - 00:14:26.552, Speaker B: Is voice credits one to one with staked tokens?
00:14:26.616 - 00:14:58.646, Speaker A: No, no, it's. Well, why are you asking how sludge I have staked? It can be. The voice credits can be like. It can be decided by the organization, basically, yeah. So you'll approve it? I'll wait for the transaction to go through, finish signing up. That's actually a question for our chief architect, Eric. Right now it's the one of the elliptic curves, but I think we can probably change it.
00:14:58.646 - 00:15:16.658, Speaker A: Yeah, so, as you can see now, my wallet is like, I'm signed up to the vote and I can click on what projects I want to vote for. On the left, as you saw, I had 50 votes available, so definitely sloth chain, obviously. Right? Anything else?
00:15:16.754 - 00:15:17.738, Speaker B: 50 to sloth chain.
00:15:17.794 - 00:15:43.418, Speaker A: 50 to sloth chain. How about Leshean? Leshean? I haven't seen much around here at this event, but they were a one click light node deployer that participated in the hackathon. And. Yeah, I was going to say Celestia Hubble team is here, too. That's the selenium team downstairs. They wondezenhe one of the first places for this really cool global Celestia blob explorer. So if you haven't checked out Celestia Hubble by selenium, it's actually really neat.
00:15:43.418 - 00:16:28.680, Speaker A: They're downstairs here. But this is, like, how it'll go when the user actually comes to vote. And you'll see something quite interesting right here, because I think we set this up to be a quadratic vote, which is a part of how Macie works. Macie is very interoperable with any type of existing voting mechanism. Whether you want to do, like, one token, one vote, or some type of quadratic system where, you know, even if I have 50 tokens staked, right, I can't actually vote 50 full power because of, like, there's, like, a quadratic system in place to prevent, like, whale stakers to just, like, sway the vote, unless they wanted to pay that much, so. Right. With Slos chain, like, if I want to allocate, like, four votes, you can see that takes 16 voice credits.
00:16:28.680 - 00:17:03.630, Speaker A: I only have 50. Right. So maybe I'll do ten. Could I do six to sloth chain? We said sloth chain is everyone's favorite. And if I do two for the remaining. How about two for the remaining? So I'll use 44 voice credits total, and then I'll submit, I'll approve. And this is all happening on door vota l one.
00:17:03.630 - 00:17:26.092, Speaker A: There's chain abstraction in place where there's a gas station. So even if someone doesn't have door token in their wallet, they can still vote because this module will cover the cost. No, it's nothing different. One gas station. Yeah, the door is gas station. Gas station. It's built by Dora.
00:17:26.092 - 00:17:56.252, Speaker A: Yeah, there you go. So, yeah, so I voted. Now you can see the amount of voice credits that have been allocated to each of these teams that were participating. And if you go to the details of the round, you should be able to see, see the vote transaction that just went through. So here it is. So these are the ones I just made right here. This vote right here, I signed up.
00:17:56.252 - 00:18:12.330, Speaker A: Right. And then if I go here, it cost me six Dora to cast the vote. And here's the transaction hash right here. That's basically it. Yeah. Any questions?
00:18:17.910 - 00:18:19.502, Speaker C: Share a little bit more about algorithm.
00:18:19.526 - 00:18:21.450, Speaker A: Service where.
00:18:23.430 - 00:18:24.570, Speaker C: How like.
00:18:26.510 - 00:18:27.102, Speaker A: It can go.
00:18:27.126 - 00:18:34.054, Speaker C: Back to the previous level. Yeah, this page. Okay, so the trust assumptions are removed.
00:18:34.102 - 00:18:35.850, Speaker A: With anonymous Macy.
00:18:37.640 - 00:18:48.064, Speaker C: And it basically solves the operational collude problem. Yeah, but how can you explain it a little bit more about operating service and how they remove the problems?
00:18:48.112 - 00:19:39.326, Speaker A: Operators don't like, publish the results, they'll get slashed. So there's an economic incentive for them to like not hold back the results of the vote because like all of the door, all of the door vote and mainnet validators obviously like need door or a token staked to them to remain in the active set that has value. There's an economic stake involved. So if they try to collude or they don't publish the results of the vote, that's a slashing condition of the chain. That's correct. Yeah. I think that's a common criticism of proof of stake in general on chains where self bond isn't required because it's like if you get slashed, it's not your money you're losing.
00:19:39.326 - 00:20:27.986, Speaker A: But obviously in cosmos in particular, a lot of the same validators validate many of the chains. So there's kind of a social slashing dichotomy where it's like if they are seen colluding on this chain, that could impact their reputation elsewhere. They're also usually professional companies. I'm sure Maven, Levin, you guys wouldn't be very happy if you found out nocturne was colluding. So yeah, I think that that's kind of the way it works. But yeah, I think via governance you can always change some of those conditions. Like if we want to require validators to have a door or self pawn in the future, like if the community wants that, you know, they can vote or that governance proposal can be put up.
00:20:27.986 - 00:20:56.350, Speaker A: Right? Like another thing is like right now we have twelve mainnet validators. That's, we only have twelve mainnet validator slots. Right? It's not a poa chain, it's a permissionless proof of stake chain. But we only have twelve slots and if they wanted to expand to more slots, that would also go through community governance. Right. So I think, like, lots of, you know, changes on the periphery of this can still happen. That could improve the protocol long term.
00:20:59.210 - 00:21:01.110, Speaker B: Can you teach me how to gas station?
00:21:02.050 - 00:21:04.190, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's a separate workshop, maybe.
00:21:06.810 - 00:21:38.580, Speaker D: I'm just wondering, like how. How do you integrate it? So, like, let's say you want to create like a private app, Dao, for example, to go through this. But like, is there a way to access Macie just. And then build your. I'm imagining you build your own blockchain, you hold your own operator, and because you're the one hosting, then you are assuming that it doesn't.
00:21:41.050 - 00:22:05.034, Speaker A: Yeah, I think, yeah, exactly. It's like, so Macie by itself and Amacy. Right. Which what we're working on now is this is like completely open source on the door, factory repo, it's open source module. Like anyone can use it. Right. But, yeah, what we feel is like the advent of connecting this to a blockchain itself is what leads to some of these operator as a service, like benefits.
00:22:05.034 - 00:22:54.210, Speaker A: Right. Like that actually was why anyone can like come to doorvota and launch a Macy round even if they don't have their own operator. If someone wanted to just host, if someone was technical and they wanted to be their own operator and they just wanted to fork the Macie smart contract and host their own Macie round, they could, but I think that would be for a specific purpose that they were doing. I don't know if that's something that is actually going to be able to service every single chain from a single underlying infrastructure, which is ultimately what this is trying to be. Yeah. Any other questions?
00:22:55.310 - 00:22:57.170, Speaker B: Can you put it on initiative?
00:22:57.550 - 00:23:11.192, Speaker A: We can put it on initiative today. Super easy. Yeah, yeah. It's like depending on the type of voting round, right. That you want to have. It's like it's either very easy or it's immediate. Right.
00:23:11.192 - 00:23:14.100, Speaker A: Because with select, we made a new.
00:23:14.440 - 00:23:28.780, Speaker B: Voting system on Cosmos because regular gage votes would crash a cosmos chain. Because if you have too many people voting on Cosmos chains, they'd like literally pass up each voter.
00:23:30.070 - 00:23:30.662, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:23:30.766 - 00:23:35.290, Speaker B: So adding a new type of voting standard.
00:23:37.030 - 00:23:58.286, Speaker A: Well, I think so. In terms of voting standard, are you talking about like different types of voting mechanisms in general? Like not. Not privacy, but things like, you know, is it a one token, one vote? Is it a gauge vote system? Yeah. Right. Oh, okay. Yes. Like, is it ranked choice? Is it single selection? Yeah, yeah.
00:23:58.286 - 00:24:27.216, Speaker A: So that's. I think that's like a pretty drawn out process, actually. But I know that binary and informal and aa, dow, Adam, accelerator, dao, they're all very focused on shipping that right now, actually, because I don't know if you followed like new types of voting modules, basically. Yeah, I think it could. I don't think once that's there. I think once that's there, we can do it immediately. Right.
00:24:27.216 - 00:24:44.464, Speaker A: Because that's what I'm kind of saying. Like with the Celestia Macy voting round, right. That is a QV voting round. Like, as I just showed you, right. It's based on stake weight, right. So for us, there's like not even really an engineering integration we need to make with Celestia. To do that, we just like query the state of the chain, right.
00:24:44.464 - 00:25:19.930, Speaker A: For other voting rounds, like the AZQF one that's a quadratic funding round where the cosmos community is actually donating their atom token to those projects. So for that, we set up an IBC channel between VOTA and Cosmos hub and the user, actually IBC, sends their atom token to Doorvota and then uses it to vote. So depending on what type of vote it is. That's what I'm saying, we can still satisfy all of those with Macie underlying it. Yeah, cool.
00:25:23.070 - 00:25:32.410, Speaker C: Stake of address for them to simply. So next up will be.
00:25:34.030 - 00:25:42.550, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. Cool. Any other questions? No, all good. Okay, cool. Thanks, everyone for joining.
