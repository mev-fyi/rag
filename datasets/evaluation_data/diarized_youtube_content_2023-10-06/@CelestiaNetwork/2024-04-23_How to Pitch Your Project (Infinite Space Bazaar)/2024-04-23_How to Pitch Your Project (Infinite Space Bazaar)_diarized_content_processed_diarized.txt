00:00:02.440 - 00:00:27.624, Speaker A: Welcome, everyone, to another workshop for the infinite space Bazaar. My name is Josh. I'll be your host from Celestial Labs. I work on the devril team here with everyone else at Celestial Labs, and I'm excited to introduce Matthias today from Maven Eleven. Matthias will be doing a workshop on how to pitch your project. Mathias, do you want to introduce yourself?
00:00:28.204 - 00:00:54.654, Speaker B: Yeah, of course. Thanks, Josh. So first, a little bit about myself and the fund. Maven, I'm Matthias, one of the three general partners here. The fund was founded back in 2017. We've been doing crypto venture investing ever since. I myself was actually the first hire and also responsible for our investment into Celestia and therefore the modular ecosystem back in 2020 or something.
00:00:54.654 - 00:01:26.344, Speaker B: I think I've seen over 5000 pitches or something since I got into the crypto venture space, so I hope that gives me some credibility to talk, at least from the venture funding side, about how to pitch what venture funds look for when they're getting pitched the project, and hopefully also give you some insight and tips and tricks on how to approach pitching your hackathon project if you think it's sort of ready to go to the next step after building it out.
00:01:27.724 - 00:01:32.052, Speaker A: Okay, so first you said 5000 pitches.
00:01:32.108 - 00:02:22.164, Speaker B: Yeah, give or take. We the very few years I was the only sort of analyst on our team, so we were quite a bit smaller and I looked at most of our pitches, if not everything that came away. So, yeah, let me just run through the very quickly, the content for today. The first question maybe do you need and want to raise? Then we'll go through the materials that you sort of need to have ready. When you go out to pitch your project, think of these things like a pitch deck, updating your resumes, maybe a notion writer provides you a building, etcetera, then getting to pitch right, you can have a very good pitch deck, you can be an amazing presenter and great pitching. You still need to get to VC's to pitch them for investors at large. Can also be angel investors.
00:02:22.164 - 00:03:14.846, Speaker B: Then I'll shortly cover the pitching itself, which will probably be the majority of the presentation. Then a very short section of fundraising. How do you put together a round? How does it typically work with a lead investor and all these type of things? And then just general tips that we have seen, things that go extremely well and also some sort of mistakes that we've seen a lot of founders make and that I would be like, hey, I can already take these away for you. Yeah, it's going to be it. So maybe the first question, do you need and want to raise. I assume you somewhat do, otherwise maybe you wouldn't be looking at this workshop at the same time. I think it's still quite important to highlight that it is quite different to start a project and become a founder than building a hackathon project first.
00:03:14.846 - 00:04:19.824, Speaker B: Some projects just aren't meant to be venture backable, right? You can build an amazing piece of tooling, but maybe you just don't want to sell it, do business development for it, and it just doesn't have the extremely large market that a venture mackerel idea needs. Or maybe you're just extremely happy to hack together a project on the weekends, but you're also pretty comfortable your day to day job somewhere else. You're like, no, I don't want to drop that. The reason I want to kick off of this, I think for us as a fund, and I think I speak for a lot of venture funds here, the conviction of a founder is the one thing we definitely look at, right? You have to be convicted enough to spend like five plus years of your life on this. That can be extremely rewarding on many sort of levels, right? Building something that you deeply care about, watching it grow, watching a team from around it, seeing your idea come to life. There's also a clear financial payoff for founders that do extremely well. But still, this worth considering before going out to race.
00:04:19.824 - 00:05:13.524, Speaker B: Like, okay, is this really what I want to do? Do I have the idea that can use venture capital to sort of bootstrap the next phase of growth? Okay, so after you've answered this question, you're going to have to put together some materials for basing. This is somewhat similar to the materials that you probably need for the hackathon presenting to judges. I don't know exactly what these are yet, but it's probably a brief description of what you're building, why it's useful, why you have decided to build these type of things. So in general, for materials. So if a given is a pitch deck, it can be a ten to 15 slides. Presentation can be way more or less, right? There's no golden rule there that covers what you're building, who you are, and why you're raising capital, and how much. I'm still leaving out some things here, but we'll get to that in the pitching part.
00:05:13.524 - 00:06:05.404, Speaker B: Then another maybe important part here is update your resumes, GitHub profiles, Twitter profiles, LinkedIn, which is maybe a bit boomer, but some people still use it. You can expect investors to start looking at these, right, as soon as somebody is about to pitch or has pitched us, we look at their online presence and start looking like, okay, what have they done before this? What have they shown up until now? Etcetera. So I think it's good to make these up to date. What we're currently seeing more and more is also a notion that covers a lot of things that your project is about. It's a little bit of a different version than I would maybe say, a pitch deck, and can also often be like a living document. Right. You don't need to have everything finalized before you go out to raise and pitch.
00:06:05.404 - 00:06:28.024, Speaker B: It's also, yeah, very fine to see, like, hey, I've now done five pitches. Three times. Investors asked about, let's say, the amount of money I needed and what I'm going to spend it on. I didn't have that before. Oh, I'll just incorporate it now and you can also send it over afterwards. Okay. I worked out some sort of financial plan, the cost of hiring, etcetera.
00:06:28.024 - 00:07:04.364, Speaker B: So none of these need to be finalized before you go out and talk to investors. But I think it is important that you have some of them ready to go and know what investors expect you to have in terms of materials. And then, well, obviously this may be easier said than done, but the hard part, getting to bids, right, getting in front of venture investors and getting them to listen to your story for 30, 45 minutes or an hour. I think the first one is obviously a network. And again, this is easier said than done. This is a little bit like people saying, oh, how to get rich. You just need a million dollars to get started.
00:07:04.364 - 00:07:56.634, Speaker B: But once you know people who are investing or work at a fund, it's easier to get connected to more. Some actual tips apart from just knowing the right people, maybe tap into the networks of the protocols that you're building on. So, for example, you're here at the hackathon, you're building on top of celestia using the op stack or arbitrary over chain. Well, all these protocols have backers evangel investors as investors, and no investors, whether they're investors or not, in the project. So you can just reach out to probably the Celestia team, the optimism arbitrary, or any other road up team, or even an application that you're using. And also like, hey, I'm building this. Can you maybe help me talk to a few investors that you would think are useful for me? Obviously, there are various other to do, so they also want people to build on top of what they've built.
00:07:56.634 - 00:08:43.634, Speaker B: So then I think that's a nice flywheel to get going and then if you're building something really cutting edge on the infrastructure side of things, it can also make sense to maybe post on Eve research or celestial research forums to get more visibility into what you're doing, get other people's their opinion, and also to validate your idea. Just get out there more. Then there are things like events. Well, hackathons like the one we're at right now are always good to get in front of VC's. I mean, you're listening to one now. Also, there are like pitch competitions. It's a little bit more of a web two vc thing, I would maybe say, where there's like an hour long filled with ten, five minute pictures, for instance.
00:08:43.634 - 00:09:52.826, Speaker B: I'm personally not too big a fan of those, but they definitely get you visibility, so you can also participate in these. And finally, there are just a boatload of crypto events happening in cities across the world, right? So I think it's definitely, if you're starting something in this space, and when I start a project and raise capital for it, just attend these and try to guide you. There's like somebody investing, whether professionally or personally, and they can always start making connections for you. Then the third point, word of mouth, it's already somewhat in the other two, right? But this mostly becomes relevant after a few pages. After you've managed to get in front of two to three investors, don't be afraid to ask them for introductions to others. Investors generally gossip quite a lot to talk about all the deals they look at, and they consistently share those. So even though you may have pitched investor a and they've said like, nah, this is too early stage for us, or we just don't have conviction in what you're building, you can always ask, hey, can you maybe look around to your network if you know somebody else? And this plays into the last point, right? Don't be too picky.
00:09:52.826 - 00:10:45.820, Speaker B: Obviously everybody wants to talk to like the sort of tier a well known investor brand names out there, but if you're just getting started, it also just makes sense to practice your pitch a few times on investors that you can get to listen to your story and what you have to tell from there on out. It typically sort of spreads out and you manage to get more people talking about you, more eyes looking at what you're doing. So these are, in my opinion, the best ways to get to funds. And then the pitching itself, of course, which is basically what we're here for. We typically see a pitch going is like a 30 to 45 minutes initial goal. I would definitely not try to make it as long as possible, keep it short, keep it somewhat high level. And here I'll just go over the things that we often see coming by.
00:10:45.820 - 00:11:34.464, Speaker B: It is important to note that it's very dependent on what you're building. If you need to cover everything, this is not a checklist that you need to run through and be like, oh, I didn't include the target market. It doesn't have to be included. It's more that you have an idea of what you generally look for, what investors generally look for before packing something. Also maybe worth to mention here is that investors in crypto are quite broad, right? You have the venture funds like ourselves, you also have somewhat semi liquid funds who also do some venture investing on the side. And obviously these all look for very different things. So even if the first three or four investors say, hey, it's not a fit for us, because XYZ doesn't necessarily mean that your pitch is horrendous or something.
00:11:34.464 - 00:12:39.978, Speaker B: It can just be in crypto, you have a very broad range of investors, can just be that this wasn't the right fit. So pitching, structure and content. The first thing to include, obviously the background, this for us, one of the most important things like who are the founders that are sitting in front of us? Why should we, why should we think that they are able to build what they want to build? And what sort of led them here? Which plays very nicely into the second point, why are you building this? We've seen this range quite broadly. It can be like, hey, I ran into a sort of scientific breakthrough and I wanted to commercialize that and I want to commercialize that. Or it can be like, hey, I was using a defi application. I was looking for, I don't know, maybe a compliance tool, God forbid, and nobody was building it, so I'm building it up myself. Whereas trading nfts, I want to hedge it.
00:12:39.978 - 00:13:27.834, Speaker B: We affect an NFT perpetual exchange, but it wasn't there, so I decided to build it up myself. Just the motivation. And this very much plays into, like, sure, you want to find something, right? The conviction element, like, hey, this is what's needed in the industry at this point, and that's why we're building it. And that obviously plays into what are you building? Is the application, is the piece of infrastructure, is the piece of tooling and so forth. I think these are the three most important points of a pitch. After that, it's often right, like a target market, there's a little bit more for web two vc thing, but especially for applications. It's pretty important still, they say like, oh, we are like a uniswap, right? The decentralized exchange.
00:13:27.834 - 00:14:14.786, Speaker B: They're basically chasing all the exchange trading portfolio in the world. And that can help give investors an idea like, okay, this is a fucking massive market. Even though there might be a slim chance of it captured, all being captured by Uniswap, it could still be so big that we're very keen to make that bet. Again, this doesn't apply to any protocol or crypto project, right? Some, especially in crypto, don't target a web two like market, but just enable a new one. Nfts don't target an existing market of trading like digital pictures necessarily. It was just not possible before. But it does help give investors somewhat of an idea of the market that you're chasing and then the go to market.
00:14:14.786 - 00:15:45.664, Speaker B: So you've established the market you're chasing and then you want to at a high level again explain how you're going to capture it. Is your product tailored to developers? Like you could argue Celestia is. Then you're going to have to invest more in developer relations, etcetera. Or are you very consumer focused? So something like a forecaster, how are you going to talk to them? Do you have the right experience to push out consumer focused product? Or are you way more targeted than Defi DJ's who like to leverage their restaking positions even more? Then you need to show that you're like, hey, I know how to get into these communities. I know what these type of users want, etcetera. So how do you reach your users? How are you going to convince them to use your product? And maybe a very rudimentary question, how will they find out about your project in the first place? Then the final points, the business model. Again, this is perhaps more if you're building an equity like business in crypto, it's often sort of a fee like model on the protocol, but have some sort of rough idea, like, hey, if we end up being successful in capturing a portion of that market via our go to market, how will we translate that into revenue and ultimately profit? In crypto, obviously you have this weird thing that there's also a token and an equity thing.
00:15:45.664 - 00:16:32.338, Speaker B: In a business, we are mostly token investors. But then you need to think about like, ok, how I'm going to move the value that I capture back to the token in some way. Then the third, the next three points are like partnerships and progress. This is maybe more for slightly later stage companies. However, you can already be like, hey, we are building a burp Dex with app specific roll up, and we are working with CK sync on doing so. And then an investor can be like, okay, we can maybe reach out to CKC. Do we believe in the tech stack, etcetera? Maybe you have native USDC you're in touch with circle already on that.
00:16:32.338 - 00:17:17.904, Speaker B: It's quite a big ask. Maybe so early on, but here you can sort of indicate like, okay, who are we working with? Typically for later stage companies here they show like, oh, we have these teams ready to deploy on us, et cetera. Then the next one is the roadmap. I think what we've often seen go wrong with roadmaps is that teams are either sort of using them as a holy grail and very hard trying to stick with it. I think a roadmap is more sort of an indication of the sequence of events with a rough timeline that you want to do that with. It's important to know that at least us as an investor, but I think more investors, nobody ever holds you to your roadmap. Like, hey, you promised me you would ship your mainnet within six months.
00:17:17.904 - 00:18:05.576, Speaker B: We've seen investments be delayed sort of their timelines by twelve months. We've also seen them be quicker to deliver, but at least that investors have an idea of, okay, these are the milestones I want to reach as a team and maybe also include like, and at this point we'll need follow up financing. So let's say you want to ship your product up until Testnet, and then you're like, okay, and then we need x amount of capital more to hire more people and push it over to Mainnet. That's perfectly fine to just put that in there. But then as an investor, we have an idea, like, okay, this is how far we're going to get with this Capital and what we need to do sort of the milestones. We need to be able to raise more capital after that. Then at the start, you obviously chatted about like the background of the founding team here.
00:18:05.576 - 00:19:06.034, Speaker B: You chat about maybe the most important part, the rest of the team. This can either be the team that's already somewhat formed or the team that you're planning to put together. Since we're at a hackathon, I think a lot of projects here are extremely early stage. So it'll all be like teams that formed for the hackathon, but maybe throughout building here you already noticed, like, hey, we're missing somebody who's extremely good at telling what we're doing. So really going out there and selling the product to users, or we're missing somebody who can write just a little bit of extra code that we need to ship the product fast enough to hit these milestones in the roadmap. So you can be like, hey, we're looking to hire XYZ, a senior protocol engineer, a marketer, or Devrel, and then, of course, also cover the rest of your team that you already have on board. Then the final part are the fundraising details.
00:19:06.034 - 00:20:20.230, Speaker B: This is obviously very open to the stage of fundraise that you're in, right? Are you doing your first pitch? You probably won't have a whole lot of fundraising details, apart from maybe like, hey, we expect to need $2 million to be able to build out for the next 24 months and make these hires. However, as you sort of progress throughout fundraising, you can already look at, like, what stage of the race are you in? So you can be like, hey, we plan to close within a month. You can name any lead commitments that you already have. You can already shed some light on what type of deal you're putting together. Are you doing an equity only investment? Are you doing a token investment? Or both? And then one very important thing is also you can just highlight what you're looking for in funds. It seems like you're pitching only to a fundamental, but often, especially in deals that become very attractive in the crypto market, it also works the other way around. Fancy to pitch like, hey, we think this is maybe a weakness for you as a team, right? We often use a mental model of, like, a team as sort of a core muscle, which they're extremely good at.
00:20:20.230 - 00:21:17.712, Speaker B: And we're here to alleviate all the other sort of points that are not that core strength. And you can just be like, okay, I'm looking for a crypto investor that has experience bringing projects from my pre seed up until Series A, at which point we can raise a larger sum of capital, and we can sort of mature the company. So these are things you can include here. And then again, also important, the timeline of the foundation round. Right? Then, assuming your pitch has gone well, and that can take quite a while, at some point, you sort of want to start putting together the fundraiser itself. Important to note here is that it's not so much a science, right? It's not like a mathematical formula. It's more an art where you think like, okay, gut feeling.
00:21:17.712 - 00:21:46.662, Speaker B: This is the right investor for me. I know I'm, as a venture fund, a little bit, talking my own book here. That's not always the highest price. And then how it typically works, you choose or get lead offers. So that means that an investor pushed forward. Let's again take the 2 million riders example. They said, okay, we're willing to invest 1 million of dollars out of the $2 million round and we will be your lead investor.
00:21:46.662 - 00:22:06.982, Speaker B: I highly recommend to take one lead investor as to make it way easier for you as a founder to work through things like legals. And also they'll be your first point of contact whenever something goes wrong, you just need some help or you just want some advice on things. Then after, yeah, go for it, Josh.
00:22:07.038 - 00:22:30.694, Speaker A: Yeah. The lead investor is someone that you're not only just looking for someone to be that lead, but you're also going to like, just as they're kind of evaluating your project, you're also going to want to do that same sort of like due diligence on the fund that is helping lead it so that you make sure that you're getting also what you want out of it, rather than just pure fundaries.
00:22:31.314 - 00:23:02.124, Speaker B: Yeah, I would say your lead is your most important investor and you better make sure that you sort of know them through and through. Right. Maybe very practical here. I think a lead investor, for instance, that commits after two goals is maybe not. You need some time to build that relation. So I think definitely take your time for that. And they are also probably just the one that everybody else is going to be looking at whenever you really need them.
00:23:02.124 - 00:23:33.894, Speaker B: So, yeah, do yeah, take a lot of time or do gentle that. And I think maybe worth noting here how you can do that. A few things just reach out to a few of their portfolio companies. You can either ask them directly, like, hey, can you give me a reference to somebody you've worked with? Although they will typically give you the best reference possible. Right. That's somewhat of a selection bias there. But you can also just call, reach out to a few and ask like, hey, what's your experience working with them? Then you can hear it firsthand.
00:23:33.894 - 00:24:21.164, Speaker B: And again, as said in last night, you can also just let them pitch themselves a little bit. Right. Hey, why are you the right partner for me to build out this project? And then once you've picked your lead investor, let's again assume this investor takes 1 billion out of your $2 million round. You get to sort of structure the rest of the round, this often done again together with your lead investor. So you can fill it in with some other smaller venture funds, some smaller tickets, angel investors, whatever you basically want and think is best for the project. Again, I highlight here, choose who you like to work with, bottom line is just, you're going to have to spend quite some time with these people and talk, talk to them, etcetera. So you better just enjoy it a little bit as well.
00:24:21.164 - 00:24:58.294, Speaker B: I would also recommend, don't take too much funds. I think we have all seen these fundraising announcements where there's like over 20 funds listed. It's just a lot of overhead managing all of that. Everybody has to do compliance checks, legal sign off, etcetera. The more investors, the more hassle, basically. So try to keep it somewhat limited. And I also think taking on some angel investors, maybe from like the protocol you use or just people that you met while building your project out at Ecaton, or people that you've been extremely helpful with advice or gave a workshop.
00:24:58.294 - 00:25:54.154, Speaker B: Adventure capital investing. It's just important to bring these on board, if you like that, again, do your reference checks if needed. I would do a lot more for a lead investor than for an angel ticket. And then there are also some like red flags for some VC's, right? What we've seen lately, a lot is like a rolling close where the sooner people commit to investing in your round, the cheaper the price is going to be. I'm personally not really a fan of that. And then there are also in crypto, a lot of like venture funds which claim to be there for the long run. But also the first question is going to be like, when's the TGE? And how much tokens am I getting unlocked? I think then you as a founder need to think like, okay, do they really have my best long term interest in mind or I just looking to make a quick buck here, flipping some tokens.
00:25:54.154 - 00:26:28.450, Speaker B: Well, there's some tips and learnings. Wait, I missed one point. The legals important disclaimer here. I'm not a lawyer, so I can't give you like legal advice. One thing I have definitely seen is the hardest part for first time founders is the whole legal game of raising for crypto project. I think, again, this is mostly up to your lead investor to help you navigate this. They often know a law firm or have worked with from before and can recommend you.
00:26:28.450 - 00:26:57.166, Speaker B: Like, hey, we really like to work with these people. It's very dependent on where you decide to incorporate. Right. But again, in general, you can lean on your investors for this. There's this sort of weird asymmetry in crypto, whereas an investor, we've seen over 100 fundraising rounds, if not way more. And for founders, they typically maybe only go to five or something, if not way less. So just lean into that experience and also be transparent and you just don't know something.
00:26:57.166 - 00:27:49.892, Speaker B: Nobody's gonna be surprised if a first time founder doesn't exactly know how to structure the legals of crypto fundraising seed round. Then some more general tips and learnings that we've seen go wrong or extremely right over the last years. Again, I highly recommend in the first week or two of pitching, just take every single goal. It's going to be extremely boring at some point because all investors ask some of the same questions, but through doing it, you just get better at it. So practice, and also it gets more eyes on you. Respond quickly to funds that reach out. I think it's sort of as we, as funds do dd we start asking asynchronous questions over telegram, and it is just an indication of a founder that's executing well.
00:27:49.892 - 00:28:36.494, Speaker B: If they at least, you don't need to write down the answers instantly and get them all back. If you at least be like, hey, I'll get back to this before end of week. And then you send over maybe some answers and also on the application side, as maybe a general learning state, like some hard facts, right? Investors like to build a mental model for an investment. So it just helps if you say like, hey, this is the market we're chasing. This is how many daily active users we're seeing. This is how much is being spent on this vertical, whether it's in web two or in web3. And then the fourth point, and this is after I spoke with a founder that's currently racing for an equity only investment.
00:28:36.494 - 00:29:18.504, Speaker B: So this may be a learning from him. He was right. Like, know which investment buckets you're in. Some venture investors just like to do only equity deals, and some like to only do like deals with a token component to it, then you can already, in your introduction part of a call, you can just ask a venture investor, that's right. Like, hey, do you also do equity only deals? And if they're like, no, we prefer not to, or if they're like, yes, we only do that. You already know, like, okay, does this make sense or not? And they're not going to adjust that for you. And I don't think you should also adjust it for that.
00:29:18.504 - 00:30:08.614, Speaker B: Right? You shouldn't talk to one investor who only does equity plus token deals, and you're suddenly like, oh, now I also have a token. In general, maybe stick to your guns, right? Funds are wrong often, and you're building this, you're building the project. So even if investors tell you like, oh, we think XYZ is not right. While you can obviously use that feedback and learn from it, I wouldn't shift your entire project based on some narrative shift in the industry or something. A project chasing every narrative and trying to fit into every investable bucket will never be a good investment. And this plays, it may be into the second one. And we've seen this happen, especially over the last couple of months.
00:30:08.614 - 00:31:03.984, Speaker B: Try to limit or use your buzzwords a little bit wisely. Obviously, everybody tries to categorize investments, right? You're either CK, you're modular, you're intent based, your AI, you're a monolithic or integrated chain. I can't come up with way more. And then it can maybe be tempting to be like, hey, we're the next AI GK roller project solving mev for the entire industry. I think especially the high quality investors will be like, yeah, that's just not really for us. Obviously you want to market what you're doing and you can tap into the right buzzwords or category or narrative here and there, but be a little bit careful on that end. Then the another point that we've seen do well with founders is become a little bit of a branch yourself.
00:31:03.984 - 00:31:49.184, Speaker B: A lot of large crypto projects have like these invalid just around it, right? They spread the word of the project. So go to events, show your face a little bit. Investors like to have a phase two project, and I think it helps if you as a founder engage with people, listen to your users, and then that makes us more comfortable to invest. Yeah, I think that's the more practical ones. We've seen this quite often. Turn on your camera or try to meet in person with investors. Again, want to highlight here, it's a very people's business.
00:31:49.184 - 00:32:29.374, Speaker B: We bet our founders, right, you can pivot the product, you can pivot the founders, his profile or character. So turn on your camera, try to meet in person at a crypto event, etcetera. Obviously, I do love the bearchain ecosystem and their bear suit, etcetera. But I do think in general pays off to be like, okay, this is just me and we're building this. And then maybe a final one. Also, it's also okay to acknowledge that you don't know everything, especially if you're pitching an introduction call. If somebody asks you like, okay, what's your token distribution going to be? You can just be like, I have no clue.
00:32:29.374 - 00:32:58.604, Speaker B: I've never issued a token yet. I would like some advice from my investors on this. I think that's a perfectly fine thing to say. And I don't know any investor who won't invest in your idea. So admit where you're like, okay, I need to figure this out a little bit more or I'm going to get back on this later, or I just don't know from the chat. Yeah, I think of most of it from my end.
00:33:00.824 - 00:33:22.264, Speaker A: Yeah, I have a few myself. And there's also one in the chat we were talking recently about maybe not having 20 funds on your announcement, like your series a or b announcement or whatever. Is there like a safe number that you'd recommend of funds and then maybe also like a kind of good range for angel investors?
00:33:24.524 - 00:33:48.144, Speaker B: Yeah, it depends very much on the stage. Right. I think seed, pre seed, one big lead and then two to three follow up investors is fine. And then agent investors can be very flexible. Really no fixed number. I think as you mature that obviously changes. And then also the overhead changes of having more investors.
00:33:48.144 - 00:34:12.164, Speaker B: You'll clearly get maybe an in house legal counsel or something, or a more experienced law firm on board. So then you can also more easily onboard more investors for let's say a series a or series b round. But in the early stages, it's just a lot of back and forth between you and your typically lead investor. I think then it pays off to not have too much investors around the table.
00:34:12.824 - 00:34:18.048, Speaker A: Just like a lot of sounds, literally also just a lot of communication overhead to keep.
00:34:18.096 - 00:34:33.755, Speaker B: Yeah, that's basically what it is. And then you maybe disagree on a certain term in a contract. And then if you have ten investors, you're going to have to reach out to all of them and be like, hey, we want to change this, and they all need to consent. It's just a whole lot of overhead.
00:34:33.939 - 00:34:34.635, Speaker A: Sounds like a lot.
00:34:34.659 - 00:35:00.664, Speaker B: So. Well, in the initial phase of pitching, since that's what the workshop was about. Right. You want to talk to as much as possible, do try to sort of funnel that down either to like, okay, what category do they invest in? Do I like engaging with them? Does it seem likely that they'll end up investing and then you end up with like a few which you're keen to work with and which they are probably also key to work with you, and then you can start putting together a round.
00:35:02.084 - 00:35:13.660, Speaker A: Awesome. Could you go actually a little bit into the different stages of raising because you mentioned like pre seed and seed and series A just to help everyone familiar with those.
00:35:13.852 - 00:36:09.488, Speaker B: Yeah, they're obviously a little bit like, what stage are we in now? You can be a pre seed or seed in general. Right. Pre sheet is like sub 1 million and then seed is sub $5 million. Again, this is very rudimentary, right? And then series A, maybe say up to 25, and everything after that, series B. Obviously they do happen in sort of a logical order, right? But especially on pre seed and seed, you can raise a seed round without having raised a pre seed round, not the other way around, of course, but it's no fixed thing in venture investment that you have to raise pre seed round and then a seed round. But these are like the rough numbers. Obviously in web two vc, where these terms came from, you had way more clear metrics, et cetera, right? Like, oh, you must have this level of ARR.
00:36:09.488 - 00:36:34.954, Speaker B: And then you're sort of a series A company in crypto. That's very different. It's more backing a protocol. So one other thing we mostly look at is like team size, how far are you in your development cycle, etcetera. Typically, teams that are, let's say, over ten people are like a series A, maybe company of 20 people, maybe more. And it's also very market driven. I think.
00:36:34.954 - 00:36:51.234, Speaker B: Let's say a year ago, a seed round was very often everything below maybe 3 million. And now that is already up to five, six, if not more. So as the market becomes more hot, the rounds become bigger in size, valuations go up, et cetera.
00:36:52.294 - 00:37:05.594, Speaker A: And I guess while we're on the topic of the actual financial side of it, could you explain equity versus token deals? You mentioned maybe going in with one plan and then changing things up isn't the best way to do it.
00:37:07.454 - 00:38:08.426, Speaker B: Yeah, that's obviously, I believe very much that crypto projects will always have a token down the line, or that sort of their token value accrual is inherent to a decentralized protocol, especially on the infrastructure side. But that's not to say that they can't be extremely good equity businesses. I think from a fundraising point of view, the larger, sort of the large differences, a lot of token deals are non dilutive, as they call it. This is maybe changing slightly, but. And that means that your valuation has to be a little bit higher in the very early stages, because you can't issue more tokens. You're essentially selling, let's say, 10% of your total token supply to raise the $3 million that you need at a $30 million network valuation. Once you sold the 10%, you can't issue like, oh, let's issue 2 million tokens more, and that 30% becomes 28%.
00:38:08.426 - 00:38:48.658, Speaker B: It's sort of a fixed percentage of your token supply. So that means you need to keep in the back of your mind like, hey, if I'm now selling 10% and I want to raise maybe more capital by selling another 15, I've already sold 25%, obviously. Again, this very market dependent, right. In a bear market like to run in 2018 to 2019 or after the FTX collapse, 22 23 people just had to sell more of their dogas fly to be able to raise capital. That's just a function of the venture market. And right now that's maybe slightly different. The equity side is clearly very different.
00:38:48.658 - 00:39:09.824, Speaker B: You can't just dilute equity. You do have rights in the legal agreements that prevent you from doing so to extreme amount. But that does mean that typically equity rounds go at a slightly lower valuation. But then investors know that they'll have to double down later on to prevent dilution down the line. Cool.
00:39:11.284 - 00:39:31.144, Speaker A: I'm going to get to some questions from the chat now. The first one is from garing Patel. What is the typical allocation of a 2 million seed or pre seed round over x months? In other words, a consumer app. How many months typically?
00:39:33.764 - 00:40:00.632, Speaker B: So how many months of Runway? I think the question is here. Yeah, that's. I'm trying to. Yeah, yeah, I think that really depends on your own growth plans. We typically like to see at least 24 months of Runway. This also because as a founder, you don't want to be consistently worried about like financing having to raise more capital or things like that. Yes, very good.
00:40:00.632 - 00:40:45.834, Speaker B: Thanks. So in general, 24 months, again, you can also up the raise amount if you think you can put the capital to good use. Right. That's ultimately what this is about, raising the right amount of capital that you can put to work to grow the business into something. So there's no given formula here. We, as a fund, like to see price from Runway, even though 24 months is not that extraordinary, mostly because raising capital is just quite some work, maybe in the current market a little bit less than, let's say, twelve months ago, but still. And you don't want somebody who's focused on building a protocol or a business or whatever to have to worry about capital again on this.
00:40:45.834 - 00:41:32.794, Speaker B: Maybe also, nice piece of advice, lean into your investors to sort of gauge the market a little bit and also indicate to them that you want to hear this. So we as investors see like ventures all the time, we hear valuations, how much is being raised, projects that are in a similar stage, like you, that could easily raise a full on funding route, et cetera. You as a founder or co founder or founding team, whatever. Ideally you don't hear that all the time. You're busy building out whatever it is you're building out. They're focusing on hiring the right people, advancing the product, etcetera. So we should just come to you and be like, hey, Josh, this is the right time to maybe go into the market to raise some more capital.
00:41:32.794 - 00:42:00.256, Speaker B: And that takes that off your plate so that we de risk that a little bit. So don't be afraid to reach out to your investors, like, hey, what's the market like right now? We're looking to raise some more capital. Do you think we can? Are we at the right stage? What do we need to do so? Because, again, they will see what's happening in the venture market, and they'll be way better at assessing that than user.
00:42:00.280 - 00:42:13.276, Speaker A: Finally, it sounds like that's a point where you really need, like, a mutually beneficial relationship with whoever your lead is so that they're able to help out with that. Yeah, yeah.
00:42:13.340 - 00:42:36.564, Speaker B: You can also, like, use them as a sounding board for like, hey, we want to hire five more people to do XYZ for us. Do you think that makes sense? And do you think we need to raise some more capital to do that? And then they'll be like, yes or no, right? Ultimately, you as a founder are in the driver's seat, so you decide. But just getting some more advice and go are from the market. So it's always helpful.
00:42:39.224 - 00:42:48.792, Speaker A: And another one from garring. What are you most passionate right now about right now in crypto?
00:42:48.968 - 00:43:32.472, Speaker B: A lot of people have asked this question recently. I don't know why that is. Yeah, like, passionate on like, a personal level. Still privacy tech from an investable side that is maybe a little bit rougher. Right. So maybe this goes into, like, do you want to raise your project or not? But we have quite a hard time underwriting some privacy tech right now because this is just regulatory, quite a minefield. So I think that, I also think some other great markets, like gambling, still make a lot of sense on chain, even though you can that a lot of crypto is gambling, but like poker, casino games, etcetera, I think these are huge markets.
00:43:32.472 - 00:43:59.314, Speaker B: Sports betting. This plays into, like, prediction markets very well. I continue to be very passionate about those. It's also how I sort of got into crypto. One of the first projects I fell in love with was Auger. And I still think especially an election year like this, these make a lot of sense. Apart from that, obviously, anything to do with customization of execution environments, right.
00:43:59.314 - 00:44:27.984, Speaker B: In my mind, that's what modular blockchains enable in addition to many other things. But just playing around with things that are not the standard EVM. I'm, like, a believer of choice for consumers and also for developers. Right. Capitalist. I don't think, like, oh, we should only have one product in the fucking grocery store. We should just offer as much as we can and then let developers choose, let the market decide.
00:44:27.984 - 00:44:36.664, Speaker B: So anything that gives flexibility there, I think is a good. Yeah, it's an interesting area.
00:44:38.604 - 00:44:53.444, Speaker A: Thank you. I have a few more that we'll go through here. Is there like a length of a pitch that's too short and is there a length that's too long based on all the pitches that you've seen?
00:44:55.304 - 00:45:37.354, Speaker B: Yeah. In general, we do a 30 minutes call sort of as an introduction. Right. And then there's like a pitch of 15 to 20 minutes and then questions. Maybe also important to note here, pitch doesn't need to be like a one way street right. At the very beginning, as a founder, I often say this as the fund, like, I'll just be very rude and interrupt you whenever I can when I have questions. And it can just be, and this has happened, that you just get stuck on slide number three around the product, and you spend the full 30 minutes or even longer debating that, and people ask very in depth questions, and you just have a back and forth that's perfectly fine.
00:45:37.354 - 00:46:00.626, Speaker B: Yes, that style. So, no, it's not. There's no fixed length. I think anything over 30 minutes as a first pitch for me is like, okay, this is quite long. Right. You just want to explain what you're doing at somewhat high level. And if people are interested, they will come back for more calls, which is the outworks.
00:46:00.626 - 00:46:11.334, Speaker B: Then you schedule a follow up call with more people from our team on it, everybody more prepared. You start digging into more specific things or concerns or open questions that you have, etcetera.
00:46:12.474 - 00:46:19.210, Speaker A: And it sounds like if you do get stuck on slide three, that's not necessarily a bad thing. And the next call.
00:46:19.282 - 00:46:38.414, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. In general, that's a good signal. Right. If people engage with you and have thought about the issues that you're also thinking about, or. Right. If you're building a Gan that's using PiRB Dex as somebody's like, you know, I've been looking at PiRB Dexs for the last three years. It generally means they think it's a category worth looking at.
00:46:38.414 - 00:46:43.024, Speaker B: So then if you just dig in extremely deep on the first call, that's only a good signal.
00:46:44.844 - 00:47:04.104, Speaker A: Might kind of build off one of the last questions, because you just mentioned categories. How would you classify the biggest. And maybe to narrow the question down more like what are the top three categories or markets in crypto that you think are important right now?
00:47:06.404 - 00:47:56.718, Speaker B: Good question. I think one that has sort of been important over the last, I would maybe say five years is just the infrastructure category. And there's obviously still very broad. You now have like rollups, which you can even split up into optimistic and CK rollups, etcetera. But just making this stack scalable enough to handle enough users was sort of a very big open question. And then the next question becomes like, okay, what's enough users? I think there have been change which can serve as by a lot of users, but still not enough for some use cases. Then take another perhaps more drat fi or like boomer category that has just been doing extremely well.
00:47:56.718 - 00:48:40.808, Speaker B: And I think these are the most profitable business in Korea. Crypto are just real world assets which include stable coins. I think tether Circle are amongst the more profitable businesses in crypto right now. So I think anything that brings like tangible the real economy, so outside our Internet money thing on chain or allows crypto use to interact with it, I think it's very interesting. They also generally just have a mode because circle, I can't fork away their bank accounts where all the assets that are backing the USDC are lying around. Right. So they have a quite easy mode, these two.
00:48:40.808 - 00:49:19.238, Speaker B: And then finally, just the consumer applications. There's a fund. We haven't been making too many investments in those yet, although that's definitely changing now, I would say over the last six to twelve months, because now we believe that the infrastructure is at a sufficient level that consumer facing applications can actually reach enough scale to be an interesting investment. And this can go as far as being able to trade, I don't know, in game items, which obviously a lot of consumers do, to a social media like thing like forecaster cooler.
00:49:19.306 - 00:49:49.216, Speaker A: I do have a few more questions, and also if anyone in the chat does, feel free to also add yours to the list. I was curious, as you were explaining pitch decks, if there has ever been a situation where you see a website or a product for whatever the pitch deck is about, that actually sways your opinion more than the pitch deck itself, or.
00:49:49.360 - 00:50:25.214, Speaker B: Yes, and also in we have, this is way back when I just started in 2018, and I won't name any names, we had one company which just word for word, copied. I think it was a white paper about the project that we were also looking at on their website. And that obviously persuaded my opinion in a negative way, in a positive way. Yeah, I don't really know. I think more pitches itself. Right? A pitch deck. You don't necessarily need to run through the page deck as you pitch.
00:50:25.214 - 00:51:11.194, Speaker B: It's more something to send around. Like, hey, this is what we're working on. And obviously I have had calls where I saw the pitch deck and was like, nah, I'm maybe not too convinced, but after having spoken with the founders, I was like, okay, they definitely changed my mind. I think one example of this in our portfolios may be swell, which is also nice that as a way to get in front of funds. This is one of the few investments that we did that just reached out, called to us via LinkedIn, I think even two times, because the first time I didn't get back the LSovc that I had, and he just reached out. And at first I was like, yeah, this is just probably not an interesting. And after spoken with the guys, I was like, okay, we definitely have to back to these founders.
00:51:11.194 - 00:51:14.914, Speaker B: So obviously that does happen.
00:51:15.654 - 00:51:35.754, Speaker A: I guess the next question here, kind of on the product side of things, because I know that a lot of projects might not actually have the thing that they're building fully built out. Is there a point where it's too early to start raising and too early to start contacting funds? Like, is there a chance that if you do that too early, you burn bridges?
00:51:38.874 - 00:52:10.024, Speaker B: No, not really. As long as you're a little bit candid about this. Right. You can also just, and of course, the likelihood of them maybe jumping on the call with you will decrease, but you can just reach out and say, okay, we're thinking about building this. Do you maybe have time to jump on a call to discuss it? At the same time, I think a lot of people be like, yeah, we just don't have time for that right now. Which is fair. What maybe increases your chances of success is if they have, for instance, written about that topic.
00:52:10.024 - 00:52:50.134, Speaker B: We also have quite an extensive research arm, and let's say we wrote about the warehousing of block space, which we did coincidentally. And then you're building on something that allows to do that. It obviously makes sense to reach out. Okay, I saw your piece on XYZ. I'm building in that domain. Would you maybe have time to spend 30 minutes discussing that? I think you'll have a way easier time getting in front of people and also naturally select to get in front of the right people instead of just reaching out to, let's say, ten random VC's which you saw on Twitter or in a funding announcement be like, hey, I'm building XYZ. Do you want to talk about it?
00:52:53.074 - 00:53:10.314, Speaker A: And we'll get to the last question from the chat from Garang again. Do you think it's do a decentralized VC fund on chain cult Dow public goods, given that most have failed due to lack of accountability?
00:53:11.654 - 00:53:43.894, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it, it is possible. At the same time, I'm not sure if public goods are like the most investable category. You could maybe argue with all the open source software we're funding. We are all doing that, but in general, that's more up to the foundations, etcetera. Yeah, the lack of accountability is obviously a thing. So I think maybe if, let's say you want to start something like this, you already have to look at investors who are willing to take on a little bit more risk. Right.
00:53:43.894 - 00:54:31.894, Speaker B: Some large investment funds have LP's, which comes with stricter accountability, and then they might just not be able to back this. Whereas for instance, angel investors, which is again, not a VC fund, they invest out of their own pocket and obviously can take away more risky things. So I think in that sense, there's also something you saw, maybe with investment daos. We are also a member of a few of these, but the initial groups were always formed by more individuals who are perhaps slightly more risk taking in that sense. And then later on, as the investment dies, became a little bit more institutional, had things like tax reporting and incorporation somewhere. So we have a counterparty VC started coming on board.
00:54:35.194 - 00:54:56.214, Speaker A: Well, thank you for everything you've taught us today, Matthias, and thank you everyone for joining. I think unless there are any last questions from any viewers or if you have any last words, we're going to go ahead and end the stream. So I'll give you the floor for.
00:54:59.554 - 00:55:25.534, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks for having me. And of course, after I said that you need to engage with investors and ask them for feedback, etcetera, if you think about going out for raise with whatever you're working on at the agathon, right. Don't be afraid to reach out to either me or somebody else at a fund. We're keen to help out and give candid feedback dutch style. As I read in the chat somewhere.
00:55:26.234 - 00:55:31.814, Speaker A: I guess without what's a good way to contact you or the team?
00:55:33.354 - 00:55:46.452, Speaker B: Yeah, I think you can ping me on my twitter. I'm not overly active there, but I'll make sure to check my messages and then I'll just hand to whoever that is my telegram handle, we can take it from there.
00:55:46.628 - 00:55:52.284, Speaker A: Cool. Thank you so much and have a good day, everyone. Thank you again, Matthias. Thanks.
