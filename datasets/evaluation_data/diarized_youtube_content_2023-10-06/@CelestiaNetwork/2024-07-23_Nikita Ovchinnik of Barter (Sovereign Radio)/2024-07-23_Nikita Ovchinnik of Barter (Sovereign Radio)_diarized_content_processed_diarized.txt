00:00:00.600 - 00:00:13.050, Speaker A: Welcome to the second annual sovereign radio. We're here at Modular Summit. I'm your host, Shango and chain. I'm here with Nikita, the co founder of Barter, and we're going to talk about his sovereign network that he's building.
00:00:13.350 - 00:00:40.470, Speaker B: Hi, thanks for having me. So my name is Nikita. I've been in crypto since 2017, worked on various different projects, and, you know, I was fascinated by Defi. Defi, in my personal opinion, is the most amazing use case a crypto ecosystem has. And I've personally worked at Tradefi before. Before. And the trade fi market is kind of like unfair and transparent, and Defi solves all those issues.
00:00:40.470 - 00:01:22.050, Speaker B: For two and a half years, I worked at one inch. I was chief business development officer and third employee after the co founders. And a few years ago, I moved to Chile and studied angel investing, was looking into new things that are evolving on chain. Super excited about at that time, not recently, about proposal builder separation solvers and tension, and started diving deeper into this rabbit hole. And we launched a cow swap solver. And within, like, few months, we went to number one spot in terms of transactions, volume and metrics. And we've already processed over $5 billion on chain, primarily on Ethereum mainnet.
00:01:22.050 - 00:01:24.638, Speaker B: So, yeah, this is my story.
00:01:24.774 - 00:01:26.710, Speaker A: Yeah. Very exciting. Congratulations.
00:01:26.790 - 00:01:27.502, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:01:27.646 - 00:01:32.180, Speaker A: For people who don't have the context, can you explain what a castle solver is?
00:01:32.340 - 00:02:21.848, Speaker B: We kind of abstract all the difficulties and logic and nuances of how you interact with blockchain networks so the user don't have to go through this difficult process. Whenever a user submits an order on cow swap, Dex solvers receive this order. And we compete in terms of pricing and efficiency with other parties like that, primarily market makers, because market makers have their own inventory, and they can every now and then, due to Dex, arbitrage provides superior pricing. So, yeah, solvers fight for the order. We can explain it that way. And whoever nets the best result and can give the user most money for his assets wins. So this is what we do.
00:02:21.848 - 00:02:38.420, Speaker B: Being a solver is like a mix between market maker aggregator and Mev Searcher, because we have to carefully evaluate in our state of on chain, and a lot of our transactions have a little bit of arbitrage them. So, yeah, very nice.
00:02:38.580 - 00:02:47.980, Speaker A: So barter then, is another layer on top of cowswap for this network of solvers, is that right?
00:02:48.100 - 00:03:09.212, Speaker B: That is correct. We are an invisible hand of the market, as we like to call ourselves. So we, as this parties that analyzes an order, processes them, and then gets some kind of fees and also token rewards. We also live on Uniswap X and Bebop. We have been recently expanding into different blockchains and systems.
00:03:09.316 - 00:03:11.868, Speaker A: Bebop is a new one and also Uniswap X.
00:03:11.924 - 00:04:03.020, Speaker B: Absolutely. So cowswap is an order flow auction system and there are different ways how you can do auctions. Cowswap is famous for the batching of orders. So what that means is that if cowswap system waits for a couple of orders that can be executed simultaneously and some of them can experience a coincidence of once. Meaning that if I want to sell two e's and you to buy to is we don't need to route to emms or market makers, we can just connect those two orders and save money on gas and fees that go to amms. So yeah, cowswap has this coincidence of ones feature and other systems have different things. Some are into dutch auctions, some have the other special parameters or features that others don't have.
00:04:03.020 - 00:04:50.816, Speaker B: Uniswap was launched one year ago and it's amazing. It kind of helped the whole ecosystem thrive because we see a lot more projects emerging with a similar concept that run on solvers and not just on Ethereum mainnet, but also on arbitram, optimism and other l two s. Bebop was incubated by Vintromut initially as an aggregator, but because order flow auction systems are kind of like a newer, more efficient and decentralized way, they evolved into a solver network. And yeah, we are live there. We are processing quite a lot of volume. Actually, I can probably brag a little bit. I believe bebop is connected to Lido UI and on staked ease.
00:04:50.816 - 00:04:56.580, Speaker B: We are processing almost like 100% of the order flow, at least in the past few years.
00:04:57.560 - 00:05:01.078, Speaker A: Wow, that's amazing. How did you manage to achieve that?
00:05:01.184 - 00:06:16.016, Speaker B: So again, every solver right now acts as a black box and no one knows exactly what kind of algorithms and systems that we use to analyze the state of Ethereum to predict gas prices and facilitate transactions. When do we decide when to tap in our own inventory, when to route on chain? But in the future we plan to evolve into a network and we sincerely believe that every decision we make in terms of like routing and user settlement should be transparent because otherwise it might be conflict of interest. Imagine if we have like special relationship with some kind of market maker and that market maker would provide maybe like slightly worse price than an available on chain. But I don't know, due to some efficiency tricks, we might be still providing the best price and the user would actually be worse off, because we routed to market maker who pays us for the order flow. So, yeah, we are evolving into the system. We cannot discuss many things that we have right now, which makes us special, but it's all about predicting volatility on the market, also analyzing liquidity in real time. We have a great partners.
00:06:16.016 - 00:06:28.480, Speaker B: We use alchemy and the quick note, and some of our own nodes. And together, those three different systems provide us very good update on the state of chains.
00:06:28.640 - 00:06:35.060, Speaker A: Okay, understood. And so, would this also be able to be applied to flashbots?
00:06:35.520 - 00:07:07.284, Speaker B: Well, we love flashbots team. They are amazing. Their researchers are some of the best in space. We've been actively looking and analyzing swath, and actually, majority of solvers do. I believe there were a couple of announcements. Not sure if I can mention them here, but during SSE, there are a lot of side events going on. And, yeah, some projects are building pools that run through solvers on top of suave, and we want to be a solver on suave as well.
00:07:07.284 - 00:07:18.800, Speaker B: So we'll be present there. We've already engaged in some conversations and actually even battle tested, simplified version of our systems that it can be working on SOA flawlessly.
00:07:19.580 - 00:07:21.360, Speaker A: And what is swath?
00:07:22.940 - 00:07:50.260, Speaker B: Excellent. Excellent question. Yeah, it's tricky. So, the way we understand this is that suave is an extra layer on. On top of EVM chains that helps to mitigate a lot of complexity issues and helps to settle intents more efficiently. But it's not just about intents. It's also related to decentralized block building, potentially pre conformations.
00:07:50.260 - 00:07:59.040, Speaker B: Yeah, we might need more of my teammates to tackle what is sort of discussion.
00:07:59.160 - 00:08:07.630, Speaker A: All right, understood. Here at modular summit, and you were giving a talk.
00:08:07.930 - 00:08:08.554, Speaker B: Right.
00:08:08.682 - 00:08:14.626, Speaker A: So, can you cover some of that and give people a highlight reel of that if they weren't able to make it in person.
00:08:14.818 - 00:08:15.170, Speaker B: Right.
00:08:15.210 - 00:08:19.650, Speaker A: So that they could follow up with listening to the talk after seeing this highlight reel.
00:08:19.770 - 00:09:18.442, Speaker B: Definitely. So, one of the issues that we've experienced early on. So, our solver is an algorithmic solver, meaning that we try to rely primarily on transparent and on chain liquidity sources, where potentially anyone can route to Dexs, staking protocols, liquidations, from lending protocols, etcetera. And one of the biggest issues we have is that market makers, they are very good in terms of pricing assets and pricing risks, and there is no need to compete with them. Like wintermute, SAP, and many others, they are involved in sex ex arbitrage, and every now and then, they can provide superior prices. And we don't want to engage in this war race. Moreover, that would generally lead to liquidity fragmentation, because everyone would tap into their own private pools that is not accessible to anyone else.
00:09:18.442 - 00:10:06.158, Speaker B: But the key problem is that blocks on Ethereum take a lot of time, 12 seconds. And even on roll ups, l two s, they're still pretty slow. But Celestia DA is helping to make this whole process faster. Nodes would be able to collaborate, collaborate and respond within faster times. And, you know, the blocks will be more efficient. And for us, it would mean that market makers and parties with their own inventory will have less time to decide whether they want to, you know, provide their liquidity or be part of a certain trade. And that would technically should leave to improving efficiency for on chain solving systems and on chain liquidity.
00:10:06.158 - 00:10:36.226, Speaker B: So, yeah, the talk was, it was a panel, a great panel. You should definitely watch it with hash flow and some other parties that are building in a similar space. But yeah, it's about migrating to Celestia Dea. And one of the vectors that we see where we might evolve is building our own up chain, and Celestia will be our prime partner for it.
00:10:36.378 - 00:11:08.320, Speaker A: You mentioned that one of the vectors for more efficient routing would be a faster blockchain like Celestia for Da. What about the economic layer, like the dex layer? So imagine if there's a true limit order book, rather than just landscape of all amms that are available as your liquidity pool, basically your global liquidity pool. Would that make things more efficient for your network?
00:11:08.660 - 00:11:14.516, Speaker B: Absolutely. I mean, we feel like there are more and more order books or close to order books.
00:11:14.548 - 00:11:16.572, Speaker A: Like, what about true order books on chain?
00:11:16.636 - 00:11:34.684, Speaker B: True order books on chain, like thorp. Okay, okay, so true order books are great. They have some advantages, I think, more than amms. Consider ambient finance, uniswap version four, Volantis labs. They are quite efficient. Have a lot of.
00:11:34.732 - 00:11:39.196, Speaker A: Those are hybrids. Right. Well, order books on top of it.
00:11:39.228 - 00:12:31.136, Speaker B: Amm, well, yes, they have some features of order books, but what I was trying to say is that they are extremely efficient. They do excellent job, and the improvement of real order book would not be that significant. And historically, it's very hard to gain initial traction, because when you establish in all, and, you know, dapps and you have, like, order flow coming from multiple sources, life is good. You know, like a simple comparison would be aggregators against amms. So aggregators, we're always providing a better price than any single amm, whether it's Uniswap, balancel and anyone else. But because Uniswap has a huge brand a lot of liquidity and trust from the users. Uniswap always had majority of order flow going through them.
00:12:31.136 - 00:12:58.520, Speaker B: So what I mean is that this new order books will have a hard time, you know, fighting for this order flow for users and for liquidity. And it will take a lot of time before they can mature. I'd rather see some Uniswap having an order book product and sophisticated parties. Market makers from Wall street would be using it on l two.
00:12:58.900 - 00:13:00.156, Speaker A: Okay, interesting.
00:13:00.268 - 00:13:39.334, Speaker B: Yeah. Plus, can I also add that there are RFQ systems, and RFQ is like an interesting mix between Amm and other books. For those who don't know, rfqs are request for quote. And it also acts as an off chain mechanism where market makers can provide price levels. And whenever a party like our solver, wants to interact with it, we can just commit to a quote and execute it. So rfqs are also really good. And you know, one example of this would be hash flow.
00:13:39.334 - 00:13:50.730, Speaker B: I think there are a lot of market makers that are active across like, different specs that are present there, and they provide very competitive pricing, too.
00:13:51.150 - 00:13:53.570, Speaker A: Interesting. Okay, that's fair.
00:13:54.070 - 00:14:01.550, Speaker B: Perfect. Thank you so much for having me. And yeah, amazing conference. Do come visit next year if you can.
00:14:01.710 - 00:14:17.508, Speaker A: Yes, absolutely. And if you weren't able to make it to his talk, please watch it in the rest of the modular summit thread or YouTube channel or what have you. Thank you for coming on, and this has been great.
