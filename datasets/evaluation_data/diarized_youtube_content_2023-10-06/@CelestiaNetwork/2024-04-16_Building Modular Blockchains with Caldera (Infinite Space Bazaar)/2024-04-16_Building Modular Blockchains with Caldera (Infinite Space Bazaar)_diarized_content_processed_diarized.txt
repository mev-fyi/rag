00:00:23.760 - 00:00:41.090, Speaker A: Welcome, everyone, to another workshop for the infinite space Bazaar. My name is Josh and I'm excited to introduce today Matt Katz from Caldera. Today we'll be learning about building modular blockchains with caldera. Matt, it's great to have you. How are you doing today?
00:00:41.282 - 00:00:44.054, Speaker B: Yeah, doing great. Thanks so much, Josh, for having me on.
00:00:45.154 - 00:00:48.574, Speaker A: You're welcome. And I guess we can get right into it.
00:00:48.954 - 00:01:16.448, Speaker B: Yeah, sounds good. So thanks, everyone for showing up. I'm Matt, co founder CEO of Caldera. Caldera is a role as a service company, so we help people launch customizable, dedicated L2 blockchains. Especially with modular blockchain technologies like Celestia. We're effectively an AWS platform. You can launch a roll up.
00:01:16.448 - 00:01:48.420, Speaker B: You can pick and choose what exactly you want the roll up to have at the stack level, at the DA level, at the sequencer level, et cetera, other customizations, and then you can use that roll up for whatever purpose you want. Folks. Some folks right now are building ecosystem chains that are somewhat competitive with the existing general purpose l two s. We also work with a lot of gaming social defi customers that are building app chains for their specific projects. So I accidentally shared the wrong tab. This is like our, oh, you're good.
00:01:48.492 - 00:02:06.424, Speaker A: I went into that way too quickly. Thank you for telling us what counter is. For those of you who didn't already know, I also wanted to call for anyone who has questions to please drop those in the chat on YouTube. And we'll get to them ad hoc, like during the workshop. And then also at the end.
00:02:12.564 - 00:02:30.884, Speaker B: Yeah, and then, Josh. Yeah, feel free. Since I'll be demoing, if any questions come up, just interrupt me. Happy to kind of answer them as we go along. We'll be kind of happy. So our product is live, it works. It's open for everyone to launch testnets with.
00:02:30.884 - 00:03:07.214, Speaker B: We've already had a lot of really cool interest from folks who are hacking in Space Bazaar, launching their own chains. So if anyone wants to feel free to follow along. The URL is dashboard Caldera XYZ. You can just go to our website, Caldera XYZ, and click. There's like a deploy a roll up button in the top navbar. Basically, when you enter the platform, you'll see something like this, except there won't be any roll ups. You can just press the new roll up button and that'll take you to our deployment form.
00:03:07.214 - 00:03:58.294, Speaker B: We offer several roll up stacks, basically all the top ones. Right now, our support for the ZK stacks, it exists, but it's not publicly exposed on the dashboard. So if you want a Zkstack roll up either the Polygon CDK or the Zksync hyperchain stack, feel free to contact us. But yeah, on the dashboard you can choose between the optimistic stacks, either nitro or optimism. A lot of folks we work with, this is a huge decision point for them, a lot of people. It's sort of like choosing an operating system for your personal computer. There are a lot of quirks and differences between the two.
00:03:58.294 - 00:04:24.634, Speaker B: Generally, people make a decision based off of which community they want to align themselves with, if they rely on specific features, features like arbitrum nitro that have custom gas tokens built in, for example, or if they need consistent block times, which the op stack provides. And. Yeah, but typically for most applications, it's kind of just like a vibes based decision, to be honest.
00:04:25.134 - 00:04:37.926, Speaker A: Is there any. Yeah, I was just going to ask, is there any sort, is it an even split? Are there like 80% doing optimism or do you really. I guess. Do you know?
00:04:38.110 - 00:05:13.094, Speaker B: Yeah, from my view it seems pretty even. I don't think. I think the biggest misconception I see when speaking to folks, the ecosystem, like typically VC's and not builders, is that VC's think that there's going to be one stack, I think that will dominate everything, or there is one stack that's dominating. I've generally found that to not be the case. Like, you know, vision of the world is kind of multipolar. It seems it's probably more correct than like any single stack dominating for sure. Cool.
00:05:13.094 - 00:05:56.426, Speaker B: So for this demo we'll just go with op because we've got the celestial support on optimism. Currently you can select whether it's a testnet or a. A mainnet chain. Mainnet, we gate behind contacting us for various reasons, combination of security and making sure that people aren't choosing parameters that don't really make sense for them. And also just, we like working very, very closely with our production teams. And so if you're looking for a mainnet, don't be afraid to contact us. I think this will just pull up calendly directly.
00:05:56.426 - 00:06:01.134, Speaker B: You can book time with our team. We'll go with Testnet.
00:06:01.874 - 00:06:03.098, Speaker A: Testnet's free.
00:06:03.266 - 00:06:35.744, Speaker B: Testnets are free. Yeah, for some users we do have some anti civil stuff going on. It's unfortunate, but I think in the crypto space because users are rewarded. Typically when we didn't have credit card verification, we were running at peak probably 250 roll ups simultaneously, which absolutely hammered our cloud and our financials. Yeah, but it is free. There's just like a verification step. Cool.
00:06:35.744 - 00:07:10.088, Speaker B: And then yeah, you can choose a custom native token for the chain as well. This actually is a proprietary feature we built in the bedrock stack, so on arbitrum you can do it as well, but off chain labs built that. But for op, this was done in house by our team to provide the same functionality. You can choose basically anything. We have a bunch of pre filled options. If you want to make it like a shiba inu token chain, you can. Maybe we'll actually go with that.
00:07:10.088 - 00:07:16.376, Speaker B: It's a little risky because I haven't tested that feature in a while, but we'll try to.
00:07:16.440 - 00:07:17.956, Speaker A: There's no better way to test it.
00:07:18.080 - 00:07:52.216, Speaker B: Exactly. Exactly. So yeah, then Da. Yeah, I mean, I'm sure everyone here is familiar with Da because they're participating in a Celestia event. But yeah, you could either choose ethereum da, aka just posting to the native Da layer, in this case ethereum sepolia or celestia. We will have support for the other Da layers, but especially on mainnet right now. Like, Celestia is kind of the only game in town for Ult Da, at least on the op side.
00:07:52.216 - 00:08:28.006, Speaker B: So we'll of course go with that. And then you can give your rope a name. The name and the subdomain slug. This just affects the URL's that the chain is deployed with for the bridge, the RPC, etcetera. And the chain id can be anything as well. We typically suggest that people don't duplicate chain ids. There's a website called chainless.org
00:08:28.006 - 00:08:54.457, Speaker B: comma you could go and look at. I think when we randomly generate a chain id, we make sure it doesn't duplicate for testnet. Doesn't matter too much. For main nets it matters a lot. And yeah, we just do our best to, to make sure that there aren't any conflicts. So yeah, we'll just. Actually, Josh, are there any like Celestia like numbers that we should use?
00:08:54.625 - 00:09:05.293, Speaker A: Yeah, so not for EVM chain ids. I was curious, like what would happen if I did put like chain id one or five or something that already exists.
00:09:06.124 - 00:09:27.540, Speaker B: Yeah. So it won't break anything with the, with the chain itself, but it'll mean that you can replay transactions from those chains. So chain id one is ethereum, for example, and it would mean you can take any ethereum transaction that was made and like replay that on.
00:09:27.612 - 00:10:04.104, Speaker A: Okay, yeah. And then I guess on the celestial specific side of things, the only way I could imagine someone customizing this would be to customize the namespace that they're posting to. But I think that's probably auto generated or randomized to avoid conflicts. But yeah, that's the only thing I could think of that someone would want to customize is maybe giving a namespace a pretty name that translates from base 64, from hex into something in plain text. But that's about all I can think of.
00:10:04.804 - 00:10:19.944, Speaker B: Yeah, we autofill it right now. We've done a cute thing, you'll see it. But they all are prefixed by ca one d e, two a. Like Caldera.
00:10:20.324 - 00:10:21.504, Speaker A: Yeah. Oh, nice.
00:10:22.164 - 00:10:30.494, Speaker B: But yeah, they're auto generated. Maybe in future we'll allow people to customize the namespace. That's something that a couple folks have asked for.
00:10:30.794 - 00:10:34.254, Speaker A: Nice. I didn't realize it was prefixed with that. That's pretty cool.
00:10:35.834 - 00:10:58.504, Speaker B: Yeah, it's fun. Although it does mean that everyone knows which chains we're running, which may or may not be, you know, great, depending on how people want to position themselves. So for main nets, of course, we let people config. Cool. So once we have all these params, we can just click deploy. We should get some nice confetti. There we go.
00:10:58.504 - 00:11:19.614, Speaker B: Feedback. Always good to get feedback. And then it'll show up in this list. You can, you'll see it. Everything will be grayed out. We're currently deploying it. This typically takes on the order of around ten minutes on the DA side.
00:11:19.614 - 00:11:34.254, Speaker B: Yeah, it's just completely null. So once it gets filled in, that'll link to the selenium page for the roll up.
00:11:37.194 - 00:12:22.000, Speaker A: Maybe in the meantime we could go through in the background what all is going on, because I know it's spinning up the actual roll ups infrastructure for the blockchain to run, but then it's also spinning up a bridge and a block explorer. And I think, yeah, status and help page. So there's a lot going on. And like, me as someone, for example, who wanted to go try to spin up an op stack on my own, this takes out, like, all of the headache. If we weren't talking about it for the past few minutes, you would have already been able. The chain would probably already be completely live with all of those things mentioned. Is there anything else I'm missing? I went through, I rattled off what was on the screen, but what's going on right now?
00:12:22.152 - 00:13:00.388, Speaker B: Yeah. So, yeah, in a sec, I'll go through everything and demo, but, yeah, I think you basically got it right. So there's a pretty strong on chain component, which is the. I guess. And this is a little bit from memory because I'm unfortunately not the engineer that got to work on all of this sort of stuff, but kind of in order. You first need to deploy all the roll up contracts on the settlement layer. So Sepolia, there are a bunch, I'm sure if you guys have seen, I guess we can just go to like l two b.
00:13:00.388 - 00:13:38.308, Speaker B: They give like a good example, like a good list of the smart contracts on the chain here. Right? So we're basically deploying. So these are basically all the addresses that an optimism chain would have. On the l one. You're basically deploying all of these, I guess, maybe not the multi six, but most of these first ones. So there's admins, there's proxy contracts for other contracts, a lot of system contracts, et cetera. And then after that we're deploying the actual cloud infrastructure.
00:13:38.308 - 00:14:45.984, Speaker B: So we're spinning up new resources in AWS or provisioning existing ones and then those. Then we're pulling a docker image, putting it onto a kubernetes cluster, spinning up a bunch of resources. There are a bunch of moving parts, as you mentioned, block scout, like an indexer, proxies that we use monitoring for security and reliability in addition to all the actual roll up stuff. So the sequencer node, RPC nodes for some stacks, like verifier nodes, for the ZK stacks, like prover nodes. So just a lot of new code being provisioned. And then we after that need to do a lot of things on the l two, which gets done as part of that process, which is mostly deploying some of these contracts onto the l two, and occasionally useful public utilities that people like to use, a deterministic deploy, proxy raft ETH, that sort of thing.
00:14:48.044 - 00:14:54.304, Speaker A: All those contracts are basically what defines the roll up and the implementation of that roll up.
00:14:55.424 - 00:15:42.694, Speaker B: Exactly. Yeah. So on the op side, a lot of the config, it's mixed between the genesis block of the chain and also some configuration set on the l one and then the l two smart contracts more dictate. There's some kind of bridging things. There's like, like an oracle, I guess this is probably on the l one you can see, but a lot of it has to do with cross roll up communication, basically. So, yeah, my guess is that this probably still isn't complete yet. Things are kind of humming in the background.
00:15:42.694 - 00:16:26.274, Speaker B: So in the meantime, I will show a roll up that we spun up last night. As you can see, pretty similar config, although I guess using Ethereum rather than Shib as the gas token. But this is what the portal will look like once the roll up is actually live. From the admin perspective, you'll be able to look at the, like the, some of the system addresses. Sequencer batcher proposer is showing up. Cool. Oh, that is not great.
00:16:26.274 - 00:17:07.744, Speaker B: I wonder. Okay, well, we'll come back to that, but yeah, this should be, you know, it's possible the address, but yeah, it should just show transactions of, you know, batches being hosted. Let me see if we have better look here. Ah, there we go. Okay. It's possible that other address wasn't working, but these, this is just the batcher. You know what this is doing under the hood is it's sending data to Ethereum, I think mostly pointers to celestia, like blocks that can then be referenced for data availability.
00:17:07.744 - 00:18:10.874, Speaker B: Proposer similar, except these are posting the state routes. So you can see the output root, the corresponding block number on the L two. So this is like the commitment to state at a certain time on the chain. You can also, of course, see RPC URL's both HTTP and websocket. But I think the kind of most interesting things that we have are the sort of public facing things. This is like a huge priority for us because generally we found, like, when you spin up a chain, it's great that you have a chain, but then you actually want to get users, devs, et cetera, onboarded. And like, oftentimes when we were starting out and we just provided basically just this, the RPC URL folks didn't really know what to do with it, or they realized they're then blocked by other things.
00:18:10.874 - 00:19:14.718, Speaker B: And so we try to make it as easy as possible for folks to hop on, get started really quickly. So to that point, we have this hub page. This can be, you know, copy pasted and sent to anyone, devs, users, friends, anyone you want to get on boarded onto your chain has displays all the relevant public chain details. Chain id, of course, RPC URL token also comes with a faucet here, so we can connect our wallet. Yeah, thanks for dropping in the chat. So, yeah, folks, folks can definitely follow along, connect your address to the page, get some testnet tokens requested successfully, and then we can take a look at the Explorer as well. And we can actually see blocks coming in.
00:19:14.718 - 00:19:31.858, Speaker B: This right here is that faucet transaction that we just called. So I got zero one Ethan chain. And I should also show, I'm not sure, is my metamask showing up?
00:19:32.026 - 00:19:32.634, Speaker A: Yeah, it is.
00:19:32.674 - 00:20:08.034, Speaker B: Yeah. Cool. Sometimes we have issues with that. So we're now on our space bazaar network with point one east. Can send it around and send it to myself, I guess. And we'll succeed shortly. There it is.
00:20:08.034 - 00:20:38.314, Speaker B: Weirdly, sometimes metamask takes a little while for it to show confirmation when the chain is fast. So it actually happened 15 seconds ago. But yeah, we've got that. And last thing I'll show here is the bridge. So every roll up we deploy comes with a dedicated bridge instance. This can also be shared with anybody. Bridge from the sediment layer to the roll up itself.
00:20:38.314 - 00:20:58.534, Speaker B: This is effectively like a UI wrapper over the native bridge that's built into the call to the chain. We can connect our wallet and you can send tokens back and forth from.
00:20:59.994 - 00:21:13.084, Speaker A: Settlement layer to, so I guess if I were maybe like building an application on a roll up, I'd need a little bit more than 0.01 to deploy a bunch of contracts. So I guess that, yeah, the use there is.
00:21:15.104 - 00:21:55.014, Speaker B: Exactly, yeah, so yeah, it's, you know, sepolia ETH, it's, it's a testnet, but it's a fairly scarce resource. So we found, you know, it's, it's tough to give more than like 0.01, maybe 0.05 ETH per, per faucet request. But they're like, you know, there are ways of getting supposed to, you can bridge it over one thing, you know, as mentioned before, like top priority is to give people the tools to like onboard folks onto the chain. One of the most common requests we found is customizing the bridge. And so you can actually do that from the like admin page.
00:21:55.014 - 00:22:17.234, Speaker B: Actually there's like a, what's the space bazaar website? We can also pull the logo bazaar. I wonder what's a good, maybe I'll just pull it from the celestial devs Twitter.
00:22:22.894 - 00:22:24.118, Speaker A: Okay, I see where you're going.
00:22:24.206 - 00:22:36.694, Speaker B: Yeah, we can, we can just grab, grab an image, might actually be the image address. Yeah. So we can actually throw this in there.
00:22:37.314 - 00:22:38.138, Speaker A: Oh, wow.
00:22:38.266 - 00:23:13.024, Speaker B: Hopefully this, there we go. That's cool. And we can also just pull colors, etcetera. So if we want to turn this into more of a celestia sort of purple. Yeah, we can do that. Save and oh wow, updates for that. Yeah, so yeah, that is pretty much it.
00:23:13.024 - 00:23:58.088, Speaker B: Faucet is also customizable. So if we wanted to increase the amount of heat we give, we can do that. We've got some DDoS protection features here as well. You can enable or disable, you can even add new ERc tokens that exist on the roll up, add them to the faucet, add them to the bridge, custom images, custom names, etcetera. And yeah, that is pretty much it. But let's see. Looks like this might take a little bit more, more time for the deployment, but yeah, that is pretty much the platform in a nutshell.
00:23:58.088 - 00:24:00.128, Speaker B: Happy to answer any questions.
00:24:00.296 - 00:24:24.744, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't see any questions right now. I did want to give a shout out. Nicholas, GM, what's up? Glad to have you here. Montrose, same thing. And Sammy and Didier, I wanted to say what's up? Actually did forget there is a question in the chat. Does Caldera from Leon, does Caldera automatically deploy a weth contract?
00:24:25.764 - 00:24:31.304, Speaker B: I'm fairly certain we do, at least on some stocks.
00:24:40.544 - 00:24:52.204, Speaker A: I guess the one question I had was about the status page. I know that it hasn't been online that long. It was created yesterday. But what does this show us?
00:24:53.024 - 00:25:36.630, Speaker B: Yeah, so it just shows the status of the chain for our main nets. We have a more in depth status page, like basically health checks for every node blocks go, indexing, et cetera. Helpful for teams, like some teams, and I get it, as someone who's worked in infrastructure before, they want to be updated when things go down. So they like to subscribe here. And then also for our mainnet customers as part of the service, they get a pager link so they can basically ping us anytime, wake us up in the middle of the night if things go wrong, which typically doesn't happen. But if it does happen, we're accessible.
00:25:36.822 - 00:25:48.874, Speaker A: I guess if it's in production, that's an important thing to have. Do you plan to support cosmos chains? Are you mostly focused on EVM?
00:25:49.654 - 00:26:19.058, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a good question. We try to go where the demand is. That being said, I think we're seeing a lot of interest in Rolekit. I think that if we make a foray into Cosmos, it'll probably be hosting Rolekit chains first and foremost. I think General Cosmos tendermint chains, it's a little harder to apply the Ras model, honestly. And so we probably won't do that unless we see a big shift towards Cosmos sometime in the future.
00:26:19.226 - 00:26:27.624, Speaker A: I guess I should clarify. I was more curious about Cosmos SDK roll ups that not Cosmos chains, but things that are built with Rolekit.
00:26:28.164 - 00:26:34.184, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, I got you. Yeah, I think. I think it's going to happen. I think it's just a question of when.
00:26:35.004 - 00:26:53.464, Speaker A: Cool. Are there any? I didn't. I've played around with Caldera a few times, but I didn't realize you could customize the bridge and like, honestly, like add different tokens to the faucet and stuff like that. Are there any other cool features that are in the works that you're excited about coming up?
00:26:54.124 - 00:27:43.212, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the biggest push for us is the Ck, like stocks. Obviously high demand people are interested in playing around with them. I think we're generally the crypto space. It always trends towards more choice and more multipolarity over time. And we're seeing a lot of just credible interest for, you know, a large number of stacks outside of that. Yeah, we are just generally working on like tools to help people onboard as quickly as possible. So the bigger thing we're pushing on here is less so like our own products, but also native integrations with top dev tools.
00:27:43.212 - 00:28:23.404, Speaker B: So for example, we're working with third Web to get third web tooling automatically deployed as part of our deployment process. So SDKs, but also hopefully even the account abstraction infrastructure and the kind of back end heavy things so that'll really allow people to hit the ground running, I guess as part of that implicitly is recognition that account abstraction is becoming a lot more important. And so it's like one of the more common requests we get nowadays of like, you know, people are like, great, I have this chain, but I need a bundler and I need a pay master and I need wallets that can hook into that. Making that as easy as possible is, you know, something that's actively being worked on.
00:28:23.944 - 00:28:37.344, Speaker A: That was fun. I'm a big third web fan, so I like to hear that. And is arbitrum nitro something that's in the works for the celestial integration?
00:28:38.324 - 00:28:47.428, Speaker B: Yeah, that will be available very, very, very soon. It's. Yeah, I mean, like one of. One of the most in demand features, I think.
00:28:47.516 - 00:28:58.664, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. And are there any teams that are in production so deploy domain that are posting to Celestia with caldera?
00:28:58.964 - 00:29:29.378, Speaker B: Yes. Yeah. In fact, we actually have the number one chain. So Manta is in production with us pulling up the selenium. They've got this cool roll up leaderboard. So here it is. But you know, Manta, I think now about a $1 billion TVL chain been running in production with caldera since I think, like sort of August of last year.
00:29:29.378 - 00:29:40.654, Speaker B: And then we were able to seamlessly upgrade them to Celestia November, December last year. And they were actually the first chain in production ever to use celestia. Da.
00:29:40.814 - 00:29:41.414, Speaker A: Nice.
00:29:41.534 - 00:29:42.234, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:29:45.934 - 00:30:03.664, Speaker A: I'm actually out of questions. Just double check the chat. I don't see any more. I'm curious about what the implications are of using Shiba inu or any other token rather for like on the user side of things.
00:30:04.644 - 00:31:20.924, Speaker B: Yeah, great question. I mean, in short, the implication is probably you should use alt da like celestia. The biggest question with custom native tokens is that the fees that are collected on chain are typically used up to pay some on chain settlement cost. And you really don't want that settlement and da cost to be too high because then suddenly you're adding a lot of sell pressure to your token, which may or may not be like super liquid. So generally what this means is like use celestia, lower those costs to the point where they're manageable, where maybe you don't even need to sell the native token. You can use like your existing treasury or investor funds to pay for that, and then you get some really nice properties like you're effectively doing a small kind of like token buyback whenever people are using the chain where the, you know, the treasury is paying USDC to settle, but they're, you know, they're gaining some tokens and you know, the economics tend to work out. So this is also one of those reasons why for mainnets we like to speak with the teams beforehand, because a lot of folks, you know, it just, you know, when you're new to the space, it's really, really hard to kind of understand the implications in the second and third order effects.
00:31:20.924 - 00:31:27.504, Speaker B: So helping folks kind of understand those decisions is a big part of our job and big part of our sales process.
00:31:30.164 - 00:31:48.946, Speaker A: I guess as a user, when I go to send a transaction, like the big difference, as an example, sending a transaction on the roll up with Shiba Inu is a gas token. Instead of paying ether ethereum for the transaction gas fee, I'm paying with Shiba inu.
00:31:49.140 - 00:31:52.034, Speaker B: Yeah, that's basically nice.
00:31:56.454 - 00:32:02.046, Speaker A: Before we go, I'm curious to check back in on that roll up. Is it still being spun up?
00:32:02.110 - 00:32:05.674, Speaker B: Yeah, it's unfortunately, I think still being spun up.
00:32:07.894 - 00:32:08.814, Speaker A: Oh, nice.
00:32:08.934 - 00:32:20.144, Speaker B: No, it's live. Okay. It's like Semi live. So the block explorer is still being spun up. We, of course, we try to do things in an order where like you can still access some things.
00:32:20.484 - 00:32:21.988, Speaker A: Things work when they're ready.
00:32:22.116 - 00:32:41.304, Speaker B: Exactly. So those are a little grayed out, but we can connect our wall to the chain. You can add it, you can see shib is the currency. Show up zero and then request.
00:32:46.744 - 00:32:55.724, Speaker A: That's cool. That's cool.
00:33:00.344 - 00:33:23.894, Speaker B: And yeah, of course custom native token changes the display and some things on the bridge like should show. I unfortunately don't have any of our testnet show, but it'll show up there, but it doesn't really affect most of the user facing things.
00:33:26.274 - 00:34:01.324, Speaker A: Awesome. This has been really cool. Thank you for showing us some of the, I don't know, more fun features, I guess, than just deploying the roll up. Play around with it myself. I want to do a last call for people in the audience for questions, and I'm curious, if I were a developer or someone hacking during the hackathon, where's the best place to get in touch with the Caldera team and. Yeah. Or should we look out for updates?
00:34:02.104 - 00:34:35.704, Speaker B: Yeah, so, yeah, I mean, easiest way to get started with the product is just, you know, going to the. To the website, trying it out. We are accessible on Discord, and I think in the discord we've also linked like a support telegram group you can. You can use to ping us directly. Also in the. In the dashboard, if you ever run into, like, one of the roadblocks, it'll actually just bring up my personal telegram. So I've already gotten a lot of hackers messaging me, which is always fun.
00:34:35.704 - 00:34:51.224, Speaker B: So if that happens to you, feel free to just ping me directly and, yeah, for general updates, X is always the best place to see our new feature announcements, et cetera. Our username is Caldera XYZ.
00:34:55.714 - 00:35:13.254, Speaker A: Nice. Put that in the chat. So we have Caldera XYZ is the website then on xaderaxyz. Are there any last things you want to share to the audience, to the hackers watching this later?
00:35:14.274 - 00:35:31.710, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, I'm trying to think. Yeah, I mean, of course, feel free to contact us anytime. We don't bite. You know, the reason why we. We founded the company was to. To work with really cool teams and hackers building blockchain. So it's always so interesting to see what folks are building.
00:35:31.710 - 00:36:15.796, Speaker B: Um, you know, just as an example, like, I recently got contacted by someone who's, like, building like, a layer three for Roblox games, which I think is like, a super interesting concept. So always, always, you know, love seeing new things. Um, and also, I encourage everyone, you know, in the, in the audience to go deep on modularity. Like, it's, you know, I think one of the coolest concepts in the blockchain space, Celestia, obviously, been the team that's kind of brought that into the forefront, but there's just, like, so many cool things being worked on this space. The design space for chains has opened up tremendously. So there's any sort of project that, you know, you wanted to build maybe two years ago, but you weren't sure if it was possible. You felt like you ran into a wall or hit some constraints.
00:36:15.796 - 00:36:21.184, Speaker B: Probably a good time to revisit that with the whole modular blockchain movement, because way, way, way more things are possible now.
00:36:22.084 - 00:36:35.564, Speaker A: I would say that they argue that they're also much easier than, like, a year ago or six months ago even. I actually think it's easier to deploy a chain or as easy to deploy a chain as it is to deploy something on third web.
00:36:35.724 - 00:36:36.204, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:36:36.244 - 00:36:51.554, Speaker A: And that's really I just think that's really special. Looking forward to seeing what people build during the infinite space bazaar. Thank you, Matt, for teaching us about Caldera and. Yeah. Looking forward to see what everyone builds.
00:36:52.214 - 00:36:54.014, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks a lot, Josh. Thanks for.
