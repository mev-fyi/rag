00:00:00.160 - 00:00:52.344, Speaker A: I'd like to welcome everybody to the opening ceremony for Celestia's infinite space bizarre hackathon. And this is probably one of the most exciting hackathons probably of the year opportunity wise. I know you've all been hearing a lot about Celestia, so here's your chance to kind of get engaged. We expect it to be pretty, pretty competitive, so we welcome all of our top builders to come and engage and see what you could really contribute to one of the leading ecosystems going forward. And it's my pleasure to be presenting this opportunity to all of our incredible individuals in our community at Dora Hacks. With that being said, I can hand it over to the incredible Celestia team. Yaz nap, do you want to go ahead and jump in here?
00:00:53.554 - 00:01:10.854, Speaker B: Thanks, Trevor, for the introduction. Natanai. We can start introducing ourselves. Hey, everyone. Thank you so much for attending infinite space bizarre opening ceremony. I'm Yaz, head of Devrel at Celestial Labs, and I'll hand it over to Nat to introduce yourself.
00:01:11.594 - 00:01:43.104, Speaker C: Hey, everyone. So my name is Natalie, and I am with Yaz and the Devrel team. I do events and programs together with Yas. You might have been to our game nights or modular summit, and this time we gonna be leading you to infinite Space Bazaar. I think we can start. So welcome to the infinite space Bazaar, our first Celestia and Modulus hackathon. And it's gonna take 45 days, so we're taking a little bit longer than the usual hackathons.
00:01:43.104 - 00:02:14.202, Speaker C: We just wanna make sure that everyone in every corner of the world can join. And also you guys have a lot of time to build some cool modular projects. You can go next. And there's a lot of things to cover today. We just want to make sure that you kind of understand our infinite space bazaar and also go over some of the processes that our modular hackathon involves next. Yes. Oh, sorry.
00:02:14.202 - 00:03:04.110, Speaker C: And I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna mention also what we're gonna go through before we start. So first of all, we're gonna talk about the origins, we're gonna talk about the houses. Then I'm gonna kind of explain how to form a team where, what is the best way to communicate it with us and with the partners. We're gonna go through the submission guidelines, the judging criteria, who is eligible for the prizes, and also where you can find our developer resources to make sure that you, well, you can get everything and also build with Celestia underneath. And then we're going to go through the tracks. And also we have a lot of workshops starting from tomorrow until the very end. And then we got to talk.
00:03:04.110 - 00:03:21.434, Speaker C: We're going to introduce our partners and their bounties. Some of the partners are here with us today, so they will introduce their bounties. If not, then me and ya is gonna do it. And then we're gonna hand it back to Dora hacks to talk about the submissions and I'm leaving up to Yas.
00:03:22.374 - 00:04:22.474, Speaker B: Sweet. Thanks for the overview, Nat. A lot of people asked us, what did the infinite space bazaar mean? What is the origin behind it? And Mustafa, the CEO of Celestialive and co founders Celestia said it best when you said a modular ecosystem with a marketplace of contribution is why you want to call it a bazaar. Because the central thesis in a famous book based on the book the Cathedral and the Bazaar, there's two models in how you build open source free software. The first model, the cathedral model, is where you release a source code, open source, every software release. But how you develop a software where is restricted to an exclusive group of software developers. However, the bizarre model is everything is done in public, which is made famous by Linus Torvalds, the founder of Linux.
00:04:22.474 - 00:05:03.774, Speaker B: And we as a culture from the modular ecosystem, we really love the Bazaar model and this is what we align on mostly. Hence why the infinite space bazaar as the name for the first hackathon on. Now you can think of Celestia as an infinite space bazaar with millions of merchants and shoppers swapping different modules to build their green project. Now, Celestia community, we keep saying build whatever and modularism, not maximalism, but where can we get started? And I'll hand it off to NATO.
00:05:04.124 - 00:05:43.582, Speaker C: So if you think of modulism, not maximalism, build whatever. And the infinite space bazaar, it's kind of like a broad spectrum with limitless space. And we kind of thought about where is the base for you to start to find your team and also to kind of like represent your beliefs. And we came up with this concept of four houses similarly to like Harry Potter. So we're not really choosing over your skillset, we're trying to figure it out like what are the values and what you stand for next? Yes. And over. Yeah.
00:05:43.718 - 00:05:44.474, Speaker D: Yes.
00:05:45.454 - 00:06:11.334, Speaker C: So you will have, or you might have already done. Through our application form we ask you to answer five questions. And then we suggested you the house that you're mostly suitable for. But at the end is your choice to choose which one you can call your home next. So all of these are, all of these four houses. They have different features, they differ from colors, their spirits, the house. And also.
00:06:11.334 - 00:06:54.634, Speaker C: So, for example, House of Lumen tree is for the creative minds. The ones that they always like have so many ideas and they come with the initial concept. And they're mostly very inspirational, daring, sometimes provocative. Then we have a house whimsy fall that has a yellow color feature, a monkey as their spirit. And these hackers, or these people, they love to laugh. They're very funny and loving and playful and spontaneous. Then we have a house that is called Mindflux, that has a purple color in their crest and a dragon.
00:06:54.634 - 00:07:25.238, Speaker C: And you can take, you can, you can imagine these people as like a visionary. They always go towards their vision, whether they're talking about small things or big things. They're very mystical and all of the time very ambitious. And the last one, I really like that one. Puddle trail. These people are very committed to their deep work. And all the time they're looking at the world optimistically.
00:07:25.238 - 00:07:51.542, Speaker C: They're very humble and honest. So how can you find. Can you go next? Thank you. And how can you find your team? Or actually, there's three ways to form a team. If you want to be a single player, that's totally fine. And you can just represent your house. If you want to find your team within the house, that's also totally fine.
00:07:51.542 - 00:08:38.894, Speaker C: Or you can promote the into house collaboration and you can form team, like, not depending on the house, but actually like, just find it. Your mates through the diverse houses, you can do it. And we suggest you to do it on discord because this is the main communication channel that we're going to use. Yes. Can you go next, please? So if you want to find a team, go to the find a team channel and just talk about yourself, talk about your skillset. What are you looking for? Or maybe you already have an idea of the projects you want to build and just share everything there. And once you're going to find your teammates, you can post it in the bazaar channel.
00:08:38.894 - 00:08:41.654, Speaker C: And I'm going to hand it off to Yas again.
00:08:45.974 - 00:09:12.746, Speaker B: Thanks, Nat, for the overview. Now let's talk a little bit about submission guidelines. Right. In order to be considered for judging, there's a three kind of factor that we look into. First is the project description. What is your project about? The name, the summary of the project, the name of each participant, and the house of each participant. Keep in mind, people can form a team within their own house.
00:09:12.746 - 00:10:36.426, Speaker B: You can be solo representing a house, like Matt said, or you can do an inter house theme where each member can be from different houses. That's totally fine, but for the submission part you have to list each member's house and also their contact information, how to best suite you as well as GitHub handle Twitter, handle Telegram, email and you have to also explain how this project uses Celestia with explicit link to where it's using Celestia in the code. The second thing is to link to publicly visible source code repository. In other words, we want to look at the code. This doesn't necessarily apply to the community track, but basically for other three tracks we definitely want to look at the source code where it has if you have a comprehensive readme so we can understand what the project is about and how it uses celestial under a section, you can create a section called technology use all these slides. If people have questions about these slides, we'll share them in the discord after. We also want to see a link to a working demo or test guide and finally showcase this is totally optional, but spend maybe two to three minute video describing the project and a demo of the project and showcasing how Celestia is used.
00:10:36.426 - 00:10:38.574, Speaker B: Totally optimum, but we'd love to see that.
00:10:40.084 - 00:10:40.396, Speaker A: Now.
00:10:40.420 - 00:11:36.376, Speaker B: The prize eligibility, you'll be required to pass a compliance screen before being paid any hackathon prices. Prizes will be paid 25% unlocked and 75% locked for four months. If you have any questions about this, check out the submission portal on door hacks, which the door hacks team will go over the submission portal later in the presentation. The judging criteria there's four judging criteria. There's the technicality. So how technical and complicated, like the complexity of the project and the level of scale required to implement that project, and how well the code is written and organized, and how did it integrate with celestial and other technology then also originality. How unique is that project and its approach? How does it address a specific problem in a creative way or a need within the web3 or modular ecosystem? And then the practicality.
00:11:36.376 - 00:12:08.110, Speaker B: How practical is the project and the potential for real world application and adoption and its way of addressing a genuine need. And then the thrill factor, its ability. It's a way, and the best way to describe it is its ability to evoke an emotional response or connection. So the project that inspire, excite or provoke thought have a strong wow factor. Let me go to the next slide. So there's some key dates. So the deadline applied March 18.
00:12:08.110 - 00:12:41.534, Speaker B: That's when we announced it two weeks ago till May 16. May 16 is the day before the project submission deadline. On May 17, which is the project submission deadline. Fun fact, May 17 is actually my birthday. I didn't do this on purpose with the team, but like we just wanted to. It's like, you know, high level. So please submit your project by May 17, not the 18th, so I can enjoy my birthday after workshops we have a lot of exciting workshops starting tomorrow all the way to the 26th.
00:12:41.534 - 00:13:14.416, Speaker B: There's about so far we have 24 workshops and we probably have two to three more planned out as well. So every day there'll be at least one workshop, most of the workshops in one workshop a day. But sometimes you'll find two workshops per day. You can check it out at bazaar dot celestia.org schedule for all the workshops. Yeah, we'll share the slide after so you can click on the link as well. So some of the upcoming workshop this week.
00:13:14.416 - 00:14:30.242, Speaker B: Tomorrow I'll give an ideation workshop. So to help everyone come up with different ideas is to look at existing kind of ideas that we have resources on to help you get started building your own project. We also have on Thursday the introduction to modularity workshop to help you understand like how modular blockchains are built, like why they address scalability and how then we have a product and go to market workshop this workshop is highly recommended for everyone to attend this workshop on Friday. This one will help you understand a lot of like, you know, how do you think about a product that you're building to go to market? Strategy and this is all being conducted by some of the top like most brilliant mind in the celestial ecosystem. There's a lot more hackathon workshop happening throughout the hackathon on Monday. We also have an op stack workshop and there'll be a lot more like that. So keep an eye out for the workshop and we'll have them also live streamed and recorded so you can also revisit them after.
00:14:30.242 - 00:14:57.670, Speaker B: And feel free to always ask questions. Now the tracks. There's the 100k in prizes for the main track. The first one is the build whatever track. So this one is about building application. We love seeing seeing applications. There will be any kind of application, whether it's general application, gaming, nfts, DeFi and anything on the ecosystem wishlist.
00:14:57.670 - 00:15:39.574, Speaker B: We will also link after. This one is about 50k in prices. You can look at the breakdown for the 50k on the prizes link on the website on bazaar dot celestia.org. Under prizes you'll find a breakdown for distraction for the core track, this is more protocol specific, includes bridging, roll ups, developer tooling, protocol and infrastructure. And that's one at 20k. There's UX track, which we really care about UX because with a modular ecosystem, the user experience is always going to be a top priority. So this one is any kind of infrastructure to minimize onboarding and on chain user experience to the number, interaction or web.
00:15:39.574 - 00:16:07.942, Speaker B: Two authentication, onboarding identity and pwas. Pwas are progressive web apps. So if you played around with front deck, you understand what pwas are and we'd love to see any kind of PWA application. Finally, community track. We want to include as many people as possible. So if you don't find yourself to be a hacker, but you want to contribute to the hackathon, the community track is definitely for you, where you can get involved in storytelling. About the infinite space Bazaar.
00:16:07.942 - 00:16:57.648, Speaker B: We created a lot of world building around the infinite space bazaar to different houses. And there's a lot of ways for you to, you know, contribute and you know, to the storytelling and after that is community growth. So any ways that you can, you know, support the community with Daos building a Dao design and illustration, any kind of things related to helping grow the lore of the infinite space bazaar in the houses, we would love to see that. So keep an eye out for that track. You can check all four of them. Break down on the prizes page. Now, in terms of developer resources for the main cracks, we'll have links for the developer portal, the prize detailed and submission guidelines.
00:16:57.648 - 00:17:52.824, Speaker B: There'd be a lot of resources like Celestia dog deploying a roll up, how to best, you know, the starting phase, how do you deploy a roll up, and how to build an application on Bub's testnet, which is an op stack testnet, and how to build an application on right vision testnet, which is a arbitrum orbit testnet. And then there'll be the Apollo developer tooling. We're going to add a workshop for Apollo, which is a really useful developer tooling and help you get started instantiating celestial testnet and use that to build with. And then there's a redneck light node resource and the node RPC endpoint. There's other resources like check our, you know, check our wish list and then we'll have the workshop public calendar. We're going to share all these, the slides going to be added to discord. So you'll be able to take a look at it after.
00:17:52.824 - 00:18:06.954, Speaker B: Now we'll cover the partners and bounties. I think first stop is abstract be adair. I don't know if I'm pronouncing your name right, but feel free to introduce yourself and go over your boundary Yep.
00:18:06.994 - 00:19:00.034, Speaker E: Yaz. Thanks for the introduction, and thanks for the introduction of the habkathon. Hello everyone, I'm Adair. I'm in Whimsical house, and I'm from abstract money, which is a chain agnostic dapp development platform. And we started abstract over two years ago to make it as easy as possible for devs to innovate more and build better cosmwasm apps. So, you know, as developers ourselves, we're obsessed with the developer experience, and we've built a vertically integrated platform for building dapps with a modular, smart contract framework, testing libraries, front end libraries, and data APIs. So for our bounty, we're really, really excited about the transition from the current era of DeFi, where we have where we use like decentralized but still custodial financial services, to MiFi, where the user always remains in control of their finances in a completely non custodial way.
00:19:00.034 - 00:19:56.508, Speaker E: Sovereign rollups are the first step to bringing MiFi to reality, which is why we're excited about Celestia and especially Rolekit, where users and businesses would be able to have their own, like their own personal app platforms and like run all the contracts themselves on their own sovereign roll ups. So we're collaborating with Rolekit to allow for Abstract's on chain infrastructure to be deployed in one click and giving you access to all the modules and apps in the abstract ecosystem. And I talk about non custodial and self custody. This is completely possible because every abstract app is an account, it's account based, and you can build apps that your users install and remain in full control. So we'd like developers to focus on building social fi applications using Rolekit and abstract, where the roll up would be used as the backend for this community platform. And so, yeah, thanks everyone, and good luck with the track.
00:19:56.636 - 00:20:10.732, Speaker B: Cheers. Thanks, Adair. For abstract money, there's a channel on discord for abstract where you can find more information. And feel free to ping Adair on Discord Channel. Thank you so much, Adair.
00:20:10.828 - 00:20:11.904, Speaker E: Yes, thank you.
00:20:12.324 - 00:21:00.060, Speaker B: All right, next up, we got Argus Labs. I don't think Scott is here, but I'll go over the Argus Labs bounty. So for the Argus labs for the world, you know, total price of $7,500. It's the best use of world engine where you can build an on chain game or consumer app utilizing world engine, a sharded roll up SDK that allows you to build a real time on chain game and application and over other over 24 hours and horizontally scale it to thousands while maintaining EVM compatibility. Wow. That's a mouthful. Extra points for creative use of cutting edge primitives such as DK, autonomous agent, et cetera.
00:21:00.060 - 00:21:06.584, Speaker B: All righty, that's Argus Labs. Next up is Asria, and I believe Josh is on a call. Hey, Josh.
00:21:07.324 - 00:21:34.342, Speaker F: Hey, everyone. I'm Josh. I'm one of the co founders over at Astria. So we've built a shared sequencer network on top of solar Celestia. And what we're interested in seeing from people out of this hackathon is people building a non EVM roll up. So right now we have, like, a pretty robust roll up ecosystem, some using Celestia, you know, a lot using, like, you know, normal Ethereum da. But the fundamental reality is, like, almost all of these are, you know, either like an op stack roll up, or, you know, an arbitrary, morbid roll up or polygon CDK roll up.
00:21:34.342 - 00:22:18.900, Speaker F: And from, like, a technical perspective, they're relatively undifferentiated. A lot of the teams launching this, they're not making significant changes to the node code. At Asteria, we come from a very API first design principle. And so when we set out to build Asteria, the shared sequencer, it was very important for us to define like a single, well defined, what we call our execution API, that essentially the way in which a roll up as essentially a client of a shared sequencer, which intentionally abstracts away a DA layer so all the data is written to celestial on your behalf to make that generic from any given roll up framework. So whether that's Cosmos or an EVM, we've provided this well defined execution API. It's a GRPC and protobuf API. We have several examples and documentation on this.
00:22:18.900 - 00:22:44.944, Speaker F: We'll have more docs coming up. We've also done a bunch of work to provide a relatively broad variety of local development tooling that allows you to spin up a sequencer running locally or to connect to your roll up that's running locally against a remote shared sequencer that's talking to, like, a remote da layer. So we're really excited to see kind of what people can do in, like, a broader design space, so that we can see kind of new possibilities and decentralized applications that aren't just, like, relatively minor modifications on top of an EVM.
00:22:46.844 - 00:23:35.670, Speaker B: All right, that's one of my favorite people in the world. Next up, let's go to Caldera. So I'll be presenting for Caldera on their behalf, but you feel free to check out both Caldera and Astria on the Discord channel if you have questions for Caldera, the total prize is one eight, which is the best use of caldera, awarded to the project that best executes on an original creative application of blockchain built on Caldera. The preference is given to application with a significant on chain smart contract component. So if you have questions, ping in the Caldera channel on Discord for the infinite space Bazaar. Will you find a lot of people from Caldera? There's. Next up is conduit, and we got Forrest in the house forest.
00:23:35.670 - 00:23:37.350, Speaker B: You want to kick it off?
00:23:37.502 - 00:24:00.662, Speaker A: Thanks so much, yaz. Yeah, hi guys. My name is Forrest. I'm the business development lead at Conduit. So we're sponsoring a $5,000 bounty for the best roll up deployed on conduit during the hackathon using Celestia for modular data availability. If you head to the conduit app, it's super simple. It takes 15 minutes to deploy a mainnet or testnet rollup using Celestia for dA.
00:24:00.662 - 00:24:25.754, Speaker A: So we'll be judging on creativity, unique use case, as well as the contracts you deploy on top of your roll up. Ping me in discord if you're launching anything. We do have free codes for free testnets for any hackathon user launching on Celestia Da, as well as free codes for the mode builders launching mode l three s as well. So thank you guys so much. Looking forward to see what you build on conduit.
00:24:27.154 - 00:24:45.738, Speaker B: Sweet. Thank you so much for us. You can also find conduit on the discord server under the conduit channel, so feel free to give them a shout out or ask them any question. Next up, we got Gelato, and I think Patrick is in the house. Hey, Patrick. Hey, everybody.
00:24:45.906 - 00:25:40.852, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm working with Gelato. Gelato is a roll up as a service platform which makes it very easy for companies to launch their own l two s or l three s. We recently launched a new Testnet called Op Celestia Raspberry. This testnet is built on Celestia, of course, and is free to use with a ton of different services available to you. First and foremost, this includes all the Gelato middleware services which enable you, for example, to have off chain computations in your apps, have gasless transactions using relayers, or also have verifiable randomness. However, the Testnet also includes other services like block explorers, oracles, indexers, basically whatever you need to get your application off the ground. For this hackathon, we're offering a bounty of $5,500 in shell tokens to qualify all you need to do is to deploy your application on the Raspberry testnet.
00:25:40.852 - 00:25:51.384, Speaker A: We, of course, encourage you to use the Gelada middleware services to get your application to the next level. If you have any questions, we're around on Discord and very excited to see where you're building.
00:25:53.164 - 00:26:04.300, Speaker B: Thank you, Patrick. Yeah. Check out Gelato on Discord, and check out the prizes page. Next up, we got Hyperlink. Hey, Ork.
00:26:04.332 - 00:26:07.984, Speaker D: Hey, guys, how's it going? Can you hear me okay?
00:26:08.924 - 00:26:09.704, Speaker B: Cool.
00:26:10.764 - 00:27:24.924, Speaker D: Yeah, so I'm an engineer over at Hyperlane. Hyperlane's an interoperability framework that has recently been expanding a lot in the Celestia ecosystem. We are vm agnostic, so we have a bunch of implementations across the popular vms, including the EVM, the sea level VM, Cosmosm, VM. We're working on MooVM, and there's some community work ongoing for expanding that even further fully open source, so you can hop into the code and make as deep modifications as you please. But for this hackathon, we're excited about people deploying hyperlane themselves to a celestia roll up and getting it connected to the broader hyperlane network, which includes now over. I mean, I've lost track of the number of chains at this point, but I think it's close to 50. And there is kind of a smart contract SDK as well as a peripheral SDK for you to interact with the protocol and relay messages between chains.
00:27:24.924 - 00:27:37.872, Speaker D: So, yeah, that's the bounty for this hackathon. It can be pretty flexible. So definitely reach out in our discord and we can talk about projects you.
00:27:37.888 - 00:27:39.084, Speaker A: Guys are thinking about.
00:27:42.394 - 00:28:00.802, Speaker B: Alrighty, thanks, York. I feel like there's background noise. Lazarus. I think it might be audio coming from you. You mind muting yourself for the time being? Thank you. Thanks a lot, Yorick. If you want to check out more from Hyperlane, check out the Discord prizes page and hang out with York is a great guy.
00:28:00.802 - 00:28:10.254, Speaker B: Next up, we got kurtosis. Teddy, I don't know if I'm pronouncing your name correctly, but Teddy from kurtosis, feel free to jump in.
00:28:11.094 - 00:28:14.262, Speaker G: Hey, thanks for the introduction. And, yeah, you got the name right.
00:28:14.438 - 00:28:14.982, Speaker B: Cool.
00:28:15.078 - 00:29:13.462, Speaker G: Nice to meet everybody here. Yeah. So Kurtosis is a platform for launching environments of containerized services. Most notably, we've been used by the Ethereum foundation to make it super easy to spin up a local Ethereum devnet. And then we've had orgs like flashbots and Nethermind build on that to make it easy to orchestrate other infrastructure locally we've also worked with hyperlink to make it easy to deploy relayers and validators. So really what kurtosis tries to do is make it so that if there's infrastructure that you need in order to build on top of what you're trying to build, we want to make it as easy as possible for you to get that infrastructure up and running, whether that's locally or in some type of cloud environment. And in order for the modular ecosystem to grow, we've got a lot of builders in the space and a lot of people building different pieces of our infrastructure that relies on each other.
00:29:13.462 - 00:30:06.468, Speaker G: So it needs to be very easy to get that infrastructure up and running where you need it. So in that vein, we are offering prizes to people who can develop packages that make it actually getting that infrastructure up and running locally, whether it's for development or in production, as easy as possible. So we're offering a prize for the best package, authorship. So that's just a new package, whether it's a package that spins up a faucet or a multisig wallet or an oracle. And then also we're offering a prize for the best interoperability application. So if you can build specifically, what we're looking for is if you can kind of build on top of the existing Ethereum l one package or the recently built Polygon L two package and add an oracle oracle to it so that the package bins up both an Ethereum devnet and l two, as well as an oracle. Yeah, that's kind of what we're looking for there.
00:30:06.468 - 00:30:28.680, Speaker G: We've got a lot of examples in our docs. We've got the Ethereum package. Polygon just developed a package. We've got package packages from flashbots and Nethermind, so tons of examples that you guys can go off of. But really, we're just looking for anybody who can build a package to make getting infrastructure where you need it as easy as possible. Very open to working with everyone in discord. Hit me up if you have any ideas.
00:30:28.680 - 00:30:35.124, Speaker G: We'll have all our engineers in there to support you as you write packages and go through the work. So excited to see what people come up with.
00:30:36.784 - 00:30:58.450, Speaker B: All right, thanks, Teddy. I played around with Kurtosis a long time ago, not a few months back. Quite a spin up. I believe it was a ref test net for EFL two, and that was really easy. So you guys should definitely check out kurtosis in their package. It's really straightforward to spin up whatever you're looking for. So thank you so much, Teddy.
00:30:58.450 - 00:31:05.330, Speaker B: Next up, we got mode and we got crypto fed. Feel free to introduce yourself.
00:31:05.522 - 00:31:31.320, Speaker D: Hey, everyone. Thanks, Jaz. I'm Fede, head of dev rel for mode. We're at DeFi L2 for the super chain of optimism built with the op stack. And here we're super excited to promote and see what you guys can build with the layer threes powered by conduit and Celestia. So three big teams working together to get great infrastructure. So I think we have three really, really big bounties here.
00:31:31.320 - 00:32:17.254, Speaker D: The best defi layer three, the best gamefi layer three, and the layer three with yield bearing assets. So for best defi layer three, that's pretty self explanatory. We want to see DeFi applications deployed on layer three s and exploring these new code concept deployed with conduit. Then the best gamefile layer three, just a cool game that has finance built into it and deFi elements. So we want to see if layer threes are, if Gamefi is a great use case for layer three, that would be great to see. And then we're funds and we really like yield varying assets. So any assets, maybe real world assets, LRT's, lsts, liquid restaking tokens, all of these.
00:32:17.254 - 00:32:52.724, Speaker D: If you can leverage layer threes and get this going, that would be great to see. And since we're asking for all of these layer threes, we have a few codes, thanks to conduit. So you guys can deploy it for free on l three testnet. So you guys can go ask for the code on our discord. And also you can go to the, the hackathon discord, and we have our mode channel there. I'm going to be hanging a row there asking, sorry, answering any questions. So if you want to code and you want to test out these layer threes that conduit and select your powers, just come to ask.
00:32:52.724 - 00:32:55.484, Speaker D: Yeah, that's it. Thanks for the space.
00:32:57.064 - 00:33:12.394, Speaker B: Thank you, crypto fed. And you can find out more information about mode on the prizes page and on Discord. Next up, and we've got modular cloud Lazarus. You want to give an overview?
00:33:14.334 - 00:33:31.714, Speaker F: Hey, thanks, guys. Yeah, nice to meet you all. My name is LZ Rs and I am the founder of Modular Cloud. Modular Cloud was one of the first goal, oh, sorry, did I cut out?
00:33:34.394 - 00:33:35.546, Speaker B: Can you hear me?
00:33:35.730 - 00:33:37.254, Speaker C: Yes, we can hear you.
00:33:37.794 - 00:33:38.370, Speaker A: Okay, cool.
00:33:38.402 - 00:33:41.254, Speaker F: Sorry about that, guys. Yeah, so let's see.
00:33:41.834 - 00:33:42.810, Speaker A: We were one of the first people.
00:33:42.842 - 00:34:06.894, Speaker F: To come into the celestia ecosystem with the goal of supporting the entire ecosystem. And so what we want to do here is we want to give a very nice prize of $10,000 for what we call the most useful app. And so we are not going to prescribe exactly how you build this app. You can use a roll up framework, like something like Rolekit. You can use roll ups as a service. You can use shared sequencers. You can mix and match all of these things.
00:34:06.894 - 00:34:37.618, Speaker F: These are all great technologies. And the requirement that we have is that this is something that can be verified and something that people want to use. So when we want. So we're looking for useful applications. I kind of jokingly said you could even do an on chain to do list for this. Now, maybe that's not a great idea, but the point is, is that you don't need to necessarily overthink the justification for putting it on chain. We just want something that people are going to like to use that is on chain and can be verified.
00:34:37.618 - 00:34:59.284, Speaker F: And so one other thing I wanted to say just before, just to wrap this up, is that we will also be having daily office hours that you can come and talk to us, and our engineers will also help you, because we have a lot of. We see a lot of projects building on Celestia. And so we'd love to help you out if you have any questions. And, yeah, so come find us in discord.
00:35:00.664 - 00:35:19.070, Speaker B: All right. Thank you so much for giving an overview of modular cloud. I'm actually really excited about this and about the workshop that LZrs is going to do. Next up, we got Polymer, and I believe Ken is on the call. Hey, Ken, want to give an overview? Hey. Yeah.
00:35:19.182 - 00:36:05.664, Speaker E: So, Polymer is Ethereum's interoperability hub, connecting l two s using IBC protocol. The challenge that we have for a ten k prize is developing a modular IBC client tailored for both the op stack and Celestia. And I think most people think about rollups moving to Celestia, but I think this is the first time where an interop protocol would be reading from Celestia DA. To improve the security and performance of these l two s, and you created this paradigm shift with modular blockchains, and we're inviting you to move this paradigm shift into the interoperability space. So, like many of the others said, definitely join our discord. Reach out. We're available and excited to see what everyone builds.
00:36:07.164 - 00:36:16.288, Speaker B: All right, thank you so much, Ken. Next up, we got Rokit and Manav in the house. Manav, you want to kick it off? Yeah.
00:36:16.376 - 00:37:05.208, Speaker H: Hey, thanks for the intro. Hey, everyone, I'm Manuf from the Rolekit team. So Rolekit is a sovereign roller framework that allows anyone to launch their own sovereign customizable chain as easily as smart contract. You don't need a set settlement layer necessarily. You get with the sovereign roll up, you get benefits of the sovereignty of an l one and the shared security of a DLA like Celestia. So think about like you don't need any upgrade keys or like a bridge contract you can fork easily. So we like to see use cases that are uniquely enabled by the modular stack and especially things that, things you can do with your own sovereign roll up and not a smart contract directly.
00:37:05.208 - 00:37:47.288, Speaker H: So like be creative, like think, look at things that we have a list of ideas that we put on. Check out the website for that on things that would be cool to see with sovereign roll ups. And we'd love to hear on the discord what ideas you have, chat about it. And we'd also hold weekly office hours for you guys to come in and chat with what you're building and how we can help. We have $10,000 in prizes. Two of them are grand prizes. These are exciting new roll ups that are uniquely enabled by the module stack, a prize pool.
00:37:47.288 - 00:38:37.150, Speaker H: We'll have a Rolekit testnet that we are standing up right now. It'll be a cosmos up testnet to start with. And later on, once we have a Polaris EVM integration that the Verizon team is working really hard on, we'll also have EVM Testnet. So for projects that deploy on that, there's a pool prize. And for all the amazing partners for the hackathon, we'd like to see integrations with Rolekit. For example, it's abstract that has a Rolekit specific prize, and you can look at all the ideas that we have as well for some integrations that we'd like to see. And lastly, for developer tooling we like to make right now, one of our main focuses is to make the developer experience on Rolekit really good.
00:38:37.150 - 00:39:06.264, Speaker H: And that starts with a Cli that we just came up with, Rokit Cli that is going to have. We want to see more unique things. For example, people what anyone who is launching a new roll up would want. So again, things like custom gas tokens or bridging out of the box oracle, things like that. You can refer those ideas, but yeah, excited to see what you guys will build with Rolekit.
00:39:07.644 - 00:39:29.848, Speaker B: All righty. Thank you for your overview of the Rolekit bounties. Next up, uh, we got our protocol. Uh, Leo, want to kick it off? Uh, you're muted. Oh, you're muted. You have to unmute yourself at the bottom below.
00:39:29.896 - 00:39:31.804, Speaker H: Okay, let's do that again.
00:39:32.264 - 00:39:36.688, Speaker E: All right, am I muted now? All right, let's do that again.
00:39:36.816 - 00:39:37.504, Speaker A: Hello everyone.
00:39:37.584 - 00:40:20.378, Speaker F: My name is Leo and I'm part of the Mindflux house. I'm also the founder of Owl Protocol. So Owl protocol is a full stack web 2.5, the wall pro platform that's EVM focused. So we have everything ranging from no code dashboard if you're not very technical, to pre configured smart contracts for token standards, to more low level APIs for account abstraction. So what we want to see is different use cases for token standards that are not just on chain but are also connected to Oracle. So you can enable various interesting use cases, such as maybe ticketing gaming financial products through our Zapier integration.
00:40:20.378 - 00:40:59.150, Speaker F: So that makes it very easy to integrate any data source. Furthermore, we want to see other more exotic web two use cases. Zapier has over 6000 plugins, so you can connect any data source. We also have a non technical prize for storytelling and design for our future, more public marketing outreach. So we want to see a plan for our community quest. So think about like what should be certain milestones that people should attain to get points. So whether it's like I'm a developer, maybe every contract I deploy I get certain points, or maybe a user, every time I do a transaction through our ERC 4337 bundler, I get some points.
00:40:59.150 - 00:41:51.294, Speaker F: A key thing to note is that our protocol is chain agnostic, not just for existing public chains, but we also support self deployment, which means that you can launch on any of the existing roll up as service providers that you've heard of earlier before. And all you have to do is input your RPC endpoint and it will auto deploy existing tech stacks. You'll be able to deploy on these raw service providers, but also enjoy kind of a low code interface when you're building your platform and also get ERC 4337 support. So out of the box you get a bundler and you can start doing like gasless transactions. So that's it for our bounty. And we look forward to seeing you on the discord and hear about the projects you want to build. Our team will be very active and we'll also provide office hours and our workshop will be on the 17 April.
00:41:51.714 - 00:41:52.586, Speaker B: That's that.
00:41:52.730 - 00:41:54.094, Speaker E: Go mindflux.
00:41:56.114 - 00:42:19.204, Speaker B: Yeah. Shout out to mindflux. I represent house Lumen tree, but I love all houses, you know, they're like our little babies. Thank you so much, Leo. This is the last of our partner bounty presentation, last but not least. And now we're going to go over the submission process by Dorahex. So, Trevor, I don't know if you want to kick it off.
00:42:20.304 - 00:42:26.164, Speaker A: Yeah, I'll go ahead and go ahead and share my screen here. Can everybody hear me okay?
00:42:29.424 - 00:42:30.484, Speaker B: Loud and clear.
00:42:30.864 - 00:42:35.760, Speaker A: Cool, cool. Can we see this?
00:42:35.792 - 00:42:38.616, Speaker B: Okay, yep, yep.
00:42:38.720 - 00:43:18.994, Speaker A: Okay, cool. So we're just going to go quickly through the submission process here. So you just go to Dorahacks IO and if you have a profile already, you can click login. You'll log in from up here. If you don't, you'll just be able to join up here as well once you're logged in here. And I'd also like to mention that when you log in, you should, considering you guys are hacking, you can use your GitHub to log in because you're going to need to link that anyways, so it may make sense to use that for login. You can also use a wallet or gmail, that kind of thing as well.
00:43:18.994 - 00:43:59.168, Speaker A: Once you're in here, you're going to navigate to the infinite spacebazaar hackathon page. It'll look like this. You can register as a hacker right here. Once you've registered, you can submit your build or your biddle right here. It'll look kind of like this, but seeing as how we haven't created one yet, you won't be able to select one from this dropdown. So click on create new biddle here and you can put the name of your project here, your logo right here, your vision of your project right here. So write down everything that makes sense for that field.
00:43:59.168 - 00:44:30.574, Speaker A: And then here comes your build description. This is where you're going to put in all of your features and details of your actual project that you're building. And also keep in mind you can update this profile as you continue to make progress on your project. It's not finalized. Select your category here. Cryptoweb3, pretty obvious for that one, and then category here. This will just make it the build more discoverable, but it's not really, you know, it doesn't really box you into anything.
00:44:30.574 - 00:45:18.264, Speaker A: So you can select which category your application or project fits into and also infrastructures where it's currently deployed. It'll obviously be going to Celestia, right? We'll keep going down here, the GitHub repo here. This is where you're going to link your GitHub repo project demo URL. This is where you're going to put information like a deck or a white paper, that thing. Then you're going to submit a demo video. This will be like a working front end, working features, anything that can demonstrate, like where the progress is at for your particular project. And down here, this open field for team information.
00:45:18.264 - 00:46:18.726, Speaker A: You want to put your individual team members here, maybe their backgrounds, any important information that you think, for example, judges might want to know or other people that may be looking to join your team. You can invite your team members here. For example, you can put their email here, and this will send the invite to your team member. Whoever's managing your profile will be handling this as well. Team recruiting, this is here in case you're looking for team members, you can put down, let's say you need a design, front end, back end, smart contract, whatever you can put down here what you're looking for. And it'll kind of let everybody know that you're looking for additional team members. Now, down here we have your Twitter, Facebook, if you're still on Facebook, Instagram if you got it.
00:46:18.726 - 00:46:44.574, Speaker A: So these are just all your socials. And you have your telegram here as well. And this will be used for contacting you when needed. Discord, WhatsApp, wechat. All additional information to kind of verify you are who you are. But at a bare minimum, I'd recommend putting your discord in here. And then we have the agree down here.
00:46:44.574 - 00:47:36.524, Speaker A: And then you submit the build the biddle right there. I guess I didn't. I didn't fill it out as I went. Let's quickly go back and I'm just going to put in placeholder information here. I'll put in my actual socials. That should let us go through if it'll let me. Sorry about that.
00:47:36.524 - 00:48:06.868, Speaker A: And it won't let me go through without the logo. We'll use a keynote from our upcoming event. Here we go. There we go. Okay. Sorry about that. And then we go down to submit the build here.
00:48:06.868 - 00:48:41.952, Speaker A: Select whichever profile is the one that you're submitting, and then you're going to select your track. So we have the core community. Build whatever UX tracks here. Make sure you select the right one because that's where you're going to be kind of judged under. And you heard all the incredible bounties that are going to be available. In addition to the prize pool for the individual tracks, you can also submit to the individual bounties to claim here. Last but not least, down here, what house are you? This is an open field.
00:48:41.952 - 00:49:12.014, Speaker A: This is an open text field. Put down which house you're in. House, pedal trail. All the way. Optimism. And then also include your EVM and Celestia addresses here. I won't tell you what that's for yet, unless Yaz wants to spill it, but also include that here as well, and then we'll submit it.
00:49:12.014 - 00:49:48.602, Speaker A: Track. There we go. And your build is officially in. It'll take 24 to 48 hours to get fully processed, and then it'll appear under this biddle section so everybody can view it. And that's kind of it for this, for the submissions. The rest of this is information that Yaz and Nat and everybody already went over. So an overview here.
00:49:48.602 - 00:50:09.168, Speaker A: Tracks. And this is the breakdown that Yaz was talking about. Developer resources, key dates. We're kicking it off today, so let's get going. And then submission deadline here. Let's get it in early so Yaz can enjoy his birthday. And then all the prize eligibility stuff.
00:50:09.168 - 00:50:35.104, Speaker A: Submission guidelines, judging criteria, pretty straightforward here. Submission guide. This is what we're going through right now. In case you don't want to rewatch this portion of the video, you can just go ahead and go through this process right here. Then we have the judges. It's an all star cast of judges. Everybody from Nick, from Celestia, to other members of their team, and even outside of the ecosystem as well.
00:50:35.104 - 00:51:01.594, Speaker A: Tons of people here that you should or you might have seen many, many times. So do get your builds in. And this is the kind of all star lineup that you're going to be dealing with here. So make them good prizes. This is further breakdown. These are the core prizes and then the additional prizes on top. And then this is a further breakdown here.
00:51:01.594 - 00:51:36.434, Speaker A: So just go through here, familiarize yourself with it. Figure out which tracks you're going to be jumping into and if there's any bounties that you want to go after, remember, it's not just the prize pool provided by the Celestia team. There's also a ton of different bounties available to you by their incredible partners here. So definitely take a look and see what makes sense for you. Workshop schedule. Let's take a look at that here. This will be a full list of all of the workshops that we're having right here.
00:51:36.434 - 00:52:25.214, Speaker A: There's tons like Yaz is doing one on the third, nick on the fourth. Lots of good workshops here that will either help you with your build or at least educate you on all these incredible pieces of technology and tooling for you here. So definitely check this out. It's a long list, so I won't go through each individual one, but definitely take a look at that, hackers. You can see who's registered here and then these are just, we have some ideas here, hackathon ideas and that's about it. I know that was a bit of stuff to go through, but. Oh, but that should cover it.
00:52:26.314 - 00:52:52.448, Speaker B: All right. Yeah. Thanks Trevor for going over this. We also have like a more fine like, you know, prizes breakdown on the website. Because the think one of the questions how, how the 50k pull prices split for the build whatever crack if you go to. But I'm not sure if I can share my screen again. Let me try to share some other screen.
00:52:52.616 - 00:52:53.408, Speaker C: Yeah, you can do it.
00:52:53.416 - 00:53:42.216, Speaker B: Now let me double check. All right, let me present share screen. Okay. I don't know if this is going to work. All right, so if you go to Bazaar dot celeste.org under prizes, if one of the questions was how do you break down the 50k prices? So we have first place, second place, third place price pool, and then we have special categories so you can still qualify for first place. And if you have something really exceptional like the best gaming autonomous world project, the best DeFi project, best NFT, etcetera, you can still try to hit some of these other price breakdown or to build whatever track.
00:53:42.216 - 00:54:12.708, Speaker B: Right? The same thing applies for core UX and community. Each one has a breakdown, specific breakdowns. Everything also applies for amazing partners. All their boundary information here and make sure for every track or prize to check out the developer resources. These are actually links so you can click on them. Somebody asked about the workshop and schedule, so they're definitely going to be on a door hack space. They're going to be here as well.
00:54:12.708 - 00:54:49.874, Speaker B: So you can look at all the schedules after each one we make. We're also going to be uploading the YouTube videos and the presentation, the PDF presentation here so people can check it out later. So that was one of the questions. I think I hit two questions in one, which is around the 50k full prize breakdown and where would the workshop links be? Which was also answered. Let me double check if there's more questions. So just to confirm, some people already wishing me a happy birthday. My birthday is actually at the end of the hackathon on May 17, not today, but thank you everyone for your wishes.
00:54:49.874 - 00:55:51.804, Speaker B: Let me double check if there's any questions. So, all right, one of the questions are we allowed to make a this is on Discord question, are we allowed to make a project for multiple tracks? Follow up what if we want to create two projects? Is that allowed? So the way which you have one project, you want to qualify for multiple tracks, you can only qualify for one of the main tracks. But if it also applies to a specific bounty by one of the partners, that's totally fine. Except the way it works is you'll present the main track. We have our own judging system. You can check out the judges on the website, but if you also like, let's say you built something with hyperlink polymer kertosis, conduit, Caldera, whichever one, for a project that was for the main track, you can go to these specific partners and we'll share more information later about the judging process. But they have their own judging processes that are separate from the main tracks, if that is helpful.
00:55:51.804 - 00:56:12.234, Speaker B: And the follow up, what if we want to create two projects? Is that allowed? You can totally create two different projects. I would love to see that. But you can do it for two projects. For one track, one project for one track, one for the other track. I would love to see that, if you can. I mean, it's 45 days. There should be plenty of time for that.
00:56:12.234 - 00:56:52.952, Speaker B: Let's see. Is there any other questions that come up? Let's see. Are we allowed to have solo? Absolutely allowed to hack solo. You know, there's a lot of solo builders out there and we respect that. One person asked, we haven't received any kind of confirmation that we successfully enrolled for the hackathon. So just to clarify, if you made it through the type form that is on the website and you get the discord link at the end to get you access to the discord server, you're in it. We got your application.
00:56:52.952 - 00:57:33.122, Speaker B: There's no email confirmation. However, just because you're confirmed into the hackathon, you still have to go through the project submission at the end of the hackathon to submit your project. Right. So that's where we consider project. We don't consider on the application side, we consider it on the submission side, which is what Trevor talked about with the submission portal for your biddle. Let's see if there are any more questions on YouTube. What does total prices on each project mean? So the total project is just like the.
00:57:33.122 - 00:58:01.064, Speaker B: You can think about it as a pool. So we already covered that. But like, if you want to take another look. So the total 50k. But if you add them all up, and I hope my math is correct, but I'm pretty sure my math is right, you should get 50k. Same thing applied for the UX and the core track. And let's see if there's any more questions.
00:58:01.064 - 00:58:06.778, Speaker B: All right. I don't think there's any more questions? But if.
00:58:06.866 - 00:58:15.774, Speaker A: Yes, we got, we got one more question. And it's about game apps. They're asking does it need to be a perfect game? I think I know the answer. But you want to take this?
00:58:16.834 - 00:58:33.962, Speaker B: That's a really great question. Does it need to be a perfect game? I don't know what perfect game is. Even AAA game always mess up their gaming when they release a game. Like I don't know if you're a gamer. I haven't yet seen, you know, AAA studio come up with a perfect game in a while. Right. But it gotta be like playable.
00:58:33.962 - 00:59:04.804, Speaker B: Like it doesn't have to be perfect, but it has to be like a game, right. That you can play. Right. So perfection, we don't like, you know, like try not to achieve total perfection, but we want to see something that we can interact with, we can play around with and stuff. So that's a great question, but yeah, it has to be at least playable. I'll give it a few more seconds. If anyone has any more questions.
00:59:04.804 - 00:59:26.234, Speaker B: Ten. I'll give it 10 seconds. Speak now forever hold your peace. Going once again. Going twice. All right, I think we could wrap it up here, Trevor.
00:59:27.974 - 00:59:42.634, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay. Well, I'd like to thank everybody for tuning in and, you know, being interested in this incredible opportunity here with, you know, the hackathon we got. We have more questions.
00:59:46.414 - 01:00:17.730, Speaker B: Developer support, like, he's on it. Developer support. Is it available on Discord or any telegram support group? Developer support. Ideally you have to go through Discord, and to get through Discord, you have to complete the type form. So if you're already in the discord, you're fine. Some teams might, you know, might have information about a specific developer telegram support group. So you can probably find them there, but you have to go through the channel for that specific team to find out information about their telegram.
01:00:17.730 - 01:00:29.254, Speaker B: So, but mostly everything, especially the community, everything is on Discord. So definitely hop on that discord after you complete your type form and, you know, get cracking.
01:00:34.034 - 01:00:43.728, Speaker A: Any last questions before we close it up again? They're good questions, though. They're good.
01:00:43.776 - 01:00:51.844, Speaker B: Yeah, they're very, they're very good. The one about game application have to be a perfect game. That's like a philosophical question, to be honest.
01:00:52.304 - 01:00:59.040, Speaker A: The pursuit of perfection, I suppose. Yeah. Playable though. It's otherwise, how do you know? Right.
01:00:59.232 - 01:01:01.884, Speaker B: How do you know it's the game if it's not playable? Right.
01:01:02.624 - 01:01:34.604, Speaker A: Yeah, I think we're all a bit kind of gamers here in this space, but yeah, let's go ahead and wrap it up. Then again, I'd like to thank everybody a second time for tuning in. Definitely. Go and check out all the information regarding Celestia through their links. Check out doorhacks IO for the submission portal. And yeah, let's see some really cool builds submitted. I think that's about it.
01:01:34.604 - 01:01:36.444, Speaker A: Any parting words? Yes.
01:01:38.704 - 01:01:58.808, Speaker B: Nat and I are very excited about this, you know, having you guys here. I'll let Nat say a few words after. But like, get started building. Pick a house, represent your house, you know, look into the community track. If you guys haven't, Nat can talk more about that. We're very excited. You know, we have a lot in programming and content up for you guys.
