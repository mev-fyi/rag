00:00:00.890 - 00:00:43.690, Speaker A: Hello everyone. In this video you will be shown how to set up our non custodial multi chain cosmostation extension wallet. Please make sure to use official links. Start by heading to the cosmostation homepage and clicking on the products tab where you will find the cosmostation wallet option. This will redirect you to the download page from where you need to click on download and then add to chrome. After successful install, you will need to choose to import an existing wallet or to create a new one. Here we will do the latter.
00:00:43.690 - 00:01:36.780, Speaker A: We then need an account name. The Cosmo station wallet is secured using a twelve word or a 24 word mnemonic seed phrase and you can decide which. Make sure to keep your seed phrase safe and private and do not share it with anyone. It is essentially your account master key. Anyone who has access to it has access to your entire account and if you lose your seed phrase, you may not be able to restore your account later on. Now we need to fill in some of the words from our seed phrase to verify we have saved it. We can then choose what networks we would like to see in our wallet dashboard.
00:01:36.780 - 00:02:02.400, Speaker A: You can always come back to this and add more of the listed networks later. If, as our final step, we are being prompted to create a wallet password which we will use in between sessions and that's about it.
