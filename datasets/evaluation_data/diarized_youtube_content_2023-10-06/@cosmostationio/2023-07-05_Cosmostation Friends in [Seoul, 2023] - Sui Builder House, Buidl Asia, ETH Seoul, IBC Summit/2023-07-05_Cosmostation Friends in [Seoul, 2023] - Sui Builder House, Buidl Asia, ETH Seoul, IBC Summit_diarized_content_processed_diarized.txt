00:00:00.090 - 00:00:04.430, Speaker A: What was the first coin that you bought and when did you buy it? Why did you buy it?
00:00:04.500 - 00:00:10.400, Speaker B: The first time I bought cryptocurrency was back in 2015.
00:00:10.770 - 00:00:17.130, Speaker C: I followed the web3 ecosystem in 2018 for peer to peer and cryptography.
00:00:17.290 - 00:00:20.362, Speaker D: Has said just before, like it was doshcoin.
00:00:20.426 - 00:00:23.226, Speaker E: I think my first coin was Ethereum.
00:00:23.418 - 00:00:25.670, Speaker F: Also, I started with ether.
00:00:27.530 - 00:00:32.738, Speaker G: 2016, probably bitcoin 2014.
00:00:32.834 - 00:00:40.330, Speaker H: I mean, I guess the backstory for the first coin I bought isn't necessarily. As an investor, I generally try to stay away from crypto investing.
00:00:42.110 - 00:00:45.434, Speaker A: Hi, who are you and can you introduce yourself?
00:00:45.552 - 00:00:51.126, Speaker B: Of course. So I'm bank. I work for Anoma and Nomada specifically.
00:00:51.238 - 00:00:54.754, Speaker C: Hello, I'm manifred to own VP Engineering at Gugnoland.
00:00:54.902 - 00:01:00.382, Speaker D: My name is Adrian, I guess like in crypto since like 2014, something like that.
00:01:00.516 - 00:01:02.490, Speaker E: My name is Brian Hennessy Shea.
00:01:02.570 - 00:01:12.718, Speaker F: Hi, I'm Thomas. Thomas from Nethermind Project. Or more like company because we work on a lot of things, mostly in Ethereum, starknet ecosystems.
00:01:12.894 - 00:01:15.598, Speaker G: My name is Co I head up growth at the Sweet foundation.
00:01:15.694 - 00:01:25.266, Speaker H: Hi guys, my name is Bo. I'm here representing polymer Labs. We're a tech company focused on bringing IBC to all chains via polymer hub.
00:01:25.378 - 00:01:31.706, Speaker A: What was the first coin that you bought and when did you buy it? Why did you buy it? Is there any behind story?
00:01:31.808 - 00:01:51.950, Speaker B: Sure. Don't tell my mom this, but the first time I bought cryptocurrency was back in 2015. I bought some bitcoin because I wanted to see how it worked, but my mom told me that I wasn't allowed to. So I bought it using cash from some guy I met at a cafe.
00:01:52.450 - 00:02:10.322, Speaker C: So I fall in the web3 ecosystem in 2018 for peer to peer and cryptography. And now I am all in blockchain smart contracts to push the humanity forward and compete with governments social networks, social coordination tools.
00:02:10.466 - 00:02:36.414, Speaker D: I said just before it was dogecoin. And mainly because I think the meme culture is something that helps to probably just share more. Well, technology, let's say you have bitcoin. There is like a complex technology behind, and you have Deutsche coin, which is basically kind of like a fork of bitcoin. Like making a proof of work chain. Like exactly the same way.
00:02:36.532 - 00:02:48.194, Speaker E: I think my first coin was Ethereum a few years ago because everyone was buying. Okay, let me try it out. Yeah, that was the main reason I.
00:02:48.232 - 00:03:07.382, Speaker F: Started with ether in 2016. No, I went to a meetup in London to ask about bitcoin and when I arrived there was this guy installing the elite version and I started talking about Ethereum and I got really excited. I went back home, tried to install.
00:03:07.436 - 00:03:11.130, Speaker G: It, probably bitcoin 2014.
00:03:12.190 - 00:03:37.678, Speaker H: I guess the backstory for the first coin I bought isn't necessarily. As an investor, I generally try to stay away from crypto investing. The backstory is I was developing on Ethereum DFI. I needed some gas to do some test out some contracts, to deploy some contracts. So I ended up buying some ETH to pay for those gas fees to test what I was building. Yeah, it wasn't for an investment purpose.
00:03:37.854 - 00:03:40.702, Speaker A: Can you describe your project in one sentence?
00:03:40.846 - 00:03:50.802, Speaker B: Nomada is an interchange privacy solution that is asset agnostic and focuses on public goods, period.
00:03:50.946 - 00:04:05.722, Speaker C: So we're creating a new smart contracting platform which is aimed to push the limits and make them away simpler so we can bring the mass developer people on web3.
00:04:05.856 - 00:04:23.102, Speaker D: I would say the product, if we talk about Ledger, it's pretty simple. The idea is having the access and the security to any digital asset in the stealth custody way. So this is pretty much it.
00:04:23.156 - 00:04:29.678, Speaker E: This is my passion actually. I think the blockchain that makes sense technology wise. It can really enable massive production.
00:04:29.774 - 00:04:41.320, Speaker F: Well, I think helping to build fantastic blockchain solutions for the future of maybe like borderless and safe world.
00:04:41.690 - 00:04:46.358, Speaker G: Well, we are a layer one, so layer one is probably the best way to think.
00:04:46.524 - 00:04:56.966, Speaker H: The one sentence that would be inclusive of the scope of what we're trying to do is polymer hub is bringing IBC to all chains.
00:04:57.078 - 00:05:01.498, Speaker A: What do you think of korean web3 community and what brings you here today?
00:05:01.664 - 00:05:39.994, Speaker B: That's a great question and I mean, it's a far flight, it takes us a while to get here, but it's always worth it because we meet some. Like our projects are not easy to understand and explain always. But what differs the korean web3 community from any of the other communities that I've met is that everyone's very keen to learn and very patient in understanding what we're trying to develop. And that is very rewarding for us because we spend a lot of time and effort trying to do this and we just think the korean community gives some of the best appreciation for that.
00:05:40.192 - 00:06:00.574, Speaker C: So that's my first interaction with korean web3 community. I think they are more concerned by web3 than many other places in the world. So that's pretty good for us because we can speak with people which are already knowledgeable. So yeah, it motivates me to come back with the team.
00:06:00.772 - 00:06:35.900, Speaker D: So yeah, I never went actually into Seoul. Yeah, it's my first time. I guess the first thing was probably just to get to know more, how is it marketed here, how is the community? And we don't know much more about the market. So it's nice to just come, get to say hi and see if, I guess, people just use a product and if we can improve. Probably trying to find the new good contact to work with.
00:06:36.350 - 00:07:00.450, Speaker E: It's way bigger than I thought. So last year I came here. It was my first time having this interaction with the korean community. We didn't do any promotion, any marketing, and then the room was packed and it was like, oh, wow, I didn't realize that besides gaming, fried chicken and it's also really big with big communities. Very impressive.
00:07:00.870 - 00:07:48.740, Speaker F: Well, I think that the community is amazing. I'm happily coming back here. First time I came to Korea last year for Korea blockchain week, I met the first people, like super energetic organizers like Erika Khan and all her team, and then was so much in love with the country, with the community here now, also, I'm learning there are so many fantastic Cosmos builders here, and infrastructure companies here are just amazing. Yeah, exactly. Cosmos stations, fantastic times together. Learning about Cosmos, learning about what you're building. So I think I'll be here much more and it's really a great time being here.
00:07:49.270 - 00:08:04.102, Speaker G: I've always been excited about the web3 community in Korea for a long time. I always think Korea is one of the probably more innovative markets I've seen, not only in terms of developers, but also in terms of just the broader ecosystem. So it's always good to be here.
00:08:04.236 - 00:08:04.486, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:08:04.508 - 00:08:39.406, Speaker H: So we're here today for IBC summit Seoul. It's the inaugural IBC summit in Seoul and in the Asia region to talk about IBC, the protocol and teach others about interoperability, different layers of the cosmos stack and so on. I would say that the korean community or the korean web3 community is really amazing. There's a lot more people than I thought there would be because Cosmos tech is generally less, I would say, adopted in the Asia region versus polka dot in a lot of regions. The reception has been great. There's a lot of people here. I feel like the energy is really high.
00:08:39.406 - 00:08:58.422, Speaker H: I think there's a lot of people that really believe in the technology, believe in what all the folks here are building and bought into the vision. We have folks, Cosmo station, who are here with us and they've been building for a long time and have been great partners to both teams building in the ecosystem and the operating validators and so on.
00:08:58.556 - 00:09:04.058, Speaker A: Is there anything you want to say to potential builders on anoma there's a.
00:09:04.064 - 00:09:34.466, Speaker B: Lot I want to say, because we're going to need all the help we can get once anoma is out. But you're going to have to rethink the way we think about blockchains. You can't take your uniswap forks and just make them work on anoma because we're not an EVM. Instead, you need to think critically about how you can use our architecture to its full potential. And if you're able to do that, then you will beat all the competition by miles, because we have the infrastructure that lets you do that.
00:09:34.568 - 00:09:35.220, Speaker A: Nice.
00:09:35.590 - 00:09:57.670, Speaker C: Let's try contribute. We're creating a new language which should be simpler. So if you come from the web, two, world, it's simpler. If you come from the web3, it's simple too. And we're creating a new fair system to reward contributors. So the earlier you start, the more points you will have. So just give a try, join us and experiment.
00:09:57.670 - 00:10:01.840, Speaker C: Push. We are here together to have fun and create amazing new stuff.
00:10:03.250 - 00:10:38.834, Speaker D: Well, use a product. Simple, but yeah, no, just use a product because you want to be secure. If it's speaking like for builders, you have to integrate the ledger. Connect. You have to integrate the ability for your users to interact with the ledger because you need a safe environment to have in a long term vision. Not some, just people that love their phone. If you look at how many people just lose their phone, it's pretty critic.
00:10:38.834 - 00:10:54.266, Speaker D: And if it happens just like in the white level or something, then your user is not going to use your app anymore because they want to have fun. So why would you just use it? And yeah, generally it's better in the long term.
00:10:54.298 - 00:11:37.802, Speaker F: I guess it's hard to say about nanomind as a product, because we have so many products and projects that we built together with other companies. So I think that Nanomide is a great invitation for lots of junior developers, people who start in the blockchain space to maybe come to us and start some internship with us, or simply start collaborating on the project and see that as a path to whatever career they imagine in blockchain. The invitation, I think this users of whatever netamine is building are the ones who will be building Ethereum, Sparknet, other.
00:11:37.856 - 00:11:39.002, Speaker E: Blockchains in the future.
00:11:39.136 - 00:11:39.530, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:11:39.600 - 00:12:01.774, Speaker H: So I wouldn't say there's a necessarily focus on our end to get folks to build directly on polymer. When we think about the Internet, we think about the Internet speaking the same language. So you have every single node or computer in the Internet. They speak TCP. It's the same language. We want to bring builders to build on top of that protocol. So this extends beyond just polymer even if they're not using polymer's infrastructure.
00:12:01.774 - 00:12:38.282, Speaker H: Just like if I'm a builder and I'm building on it in the web, whether or not I'm using Cisco's infrastructure doesn't necessarily matter. What matters is we're building on the same standard infra layer and we're pushing these protocols and we're trying to create these standards. So I would call on builders to focus on the protocols and layers and standardization, especially at the base layers of the web3 stack and to try to stay away from building on and focusing on products that are mimicking as protocols. Over the long term. We'll reap the benefit fits of this and also will suffer in the long term if we have a ton of fragmentation, especially at the infrastructure layer. So the focus is not on polymer, it's on IBC.
00:12:38.426 - 00:12:39.820, Speaker A: Thank you. That's it for today.
