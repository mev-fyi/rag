00:00:13.850 - 00:00:14.894, Speaker A: Hi, Kaushik, how are you?
00:00:14.932 - 00:00:17.614, Speaker B: I'm fine, I'm fine. Great. Flowy. Good.
00:00:17.732 - 00:00:20.378, Speaker A: Could you briefly introduce yourself to our viewers?
00:00:20.474 - 00:00:26.600, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. Hey, everyone, I'm Kaushik. I lead growth and marketing at Leap currently.
00:00:27.770 - 00:00:28.534, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:00:28.652 - 00:00:36.418, Speaker A: Could you give us an overview of lip wallet? I'm wondering what's the motivation behind developing it in cosmos ecosystem?
00:00:36.514 - 00:01:00.926, Speaker B: That's right, yeah, definitely. Sure. So basically, Leapwallet is a non custodial wallet for Cosmos blockchains. Our motivation wise, we started building first on terra. And whole thesis of building wallet is super wallet thesis where everything a user would want to do on a blockchain, we want that to happen right within. Inside our wallet itself. Right.
00:01:00.926 - 00:01:25.970, Speaker B: And that's why one of our key focus areas is mobile apps as well. Mobile wallets. And again, of course, we started building on terra. We were almost grew to 50K users right there during the peak of bull run, but that's when Terra crashed. So we started looking for other alternative chains to build on and that's when we found Cosmos. Started building for Cosmos Juno Osmosis. And then since then, been building and adding quite a lot of all the Cosmos SDK chains.
00:01:25.970 - 00:01:31.580, Speaker B: And as of today, we currently support 55 plus Cosmos chains. And the number just keeps going.
00:01:32.750 - 00:01:37.020, Speaker C: Thank you. You're doing good. Next question.
00:01:37.950 - 00:01:41.386, Speaker A: What makes lip so special for you to share?
00:01:41.488 - 00:02:05.102, Speaker B: Yeah. All right. I would say there are three things that make sleepwallet special. One is our focus on the community. So we are very close to the community, always looking out for feedback, what the community or the users want us to build. And that's what we kind of focus and try to build, specifically building for the community. Number two is our focus on mobile apps.
00:02:05.102 - 00:02:36.714, Speaker B: Right now, I think we have the most feature heavy mobile apps for Cosmos. From a wallet standpoint, quite a lot of mobile specific features that we have built, one being notifications. The moment you do any transaction, the first thing that you get is a notification on your mobile app. I think that's a really cool experience that we are able to build. And number two is DAP browser. Again, this is probably the most cloud feature from our users wherein any DAP on Cosmos you can permissionlessly access through our DAP browser. So that is another key feature that we have released.
00:02:36.714 - 00:02:51.170, Speaker B: And third is the number of chains that we support natively. Again, we integrate most of the new chains that are there on Cosmos and we keep integrating them at a very fast pace. And as of today, we have 55 plus Cosmos chains natively integrated.
00:02:51.510 - 00:02:52.500, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:02:53.430 - 00:03:03.270, Speaker A: How does leap enhance the user experience, especially for those who are not that, who are new to just entire cryptocurrency.
00:03:04.250 - 00:03:37.486, Speaker B: Sure, sure. So one of the things that we as a wallet builders focus is actually user experience. So at every touch point, what we try to do is simplify it and make it as easy as possible to do a certain transaction. Yeah, so IBC transfers is very fundamental to Cosmos chains. Everyone who are in the ecosystem know how important it is, but from someone who is completely new, they might not actually understand how to do an IBC transfer. So what we have done from our end is just simplified everything. You don't need to worry about channel IDs, you don't need to worry about what relay you are using, et cetera.
00:03:37.486 - 00:04:15.006, Speaker B: Just select the from wallet to wallet, from token and just send it across to that. And we automatically takes care of adding every other data that's required to do that transaction. That's one simple example. Second example is, like I mentioned, notifications. We think they're very important use cases where notifications can solve for, for example, if you stayed with the validator and a validator is chilled right, and whatever amount that you have stayed, there won't be any rewards anymore. And that's a notification we want to send you immediately so that you can restake it with some other validator. So there are quite a lot of very interesting use cases and very helpful things that notification could solve for, and we are very heavily focused on that.
00:04:15.006 - 00:04:39.970, Speaker B: And I think third thing is, in terms of our designs, I think they're pretty forward looking, very easy to use. And in fact, I think you have to use our wallet to understand how many smaller things that we have added sprinkled across our product experience. But again, most importantly, if you feel at any point in time the user experience isn't good enough, please reach out to us and share the feedback with us and we will fix that for you. That's our promise.
00:04:40.130 - 00:04:41.606, Speaker C: Good. Very nice.
00:04:41.788 - 00:04:46.870, Speaker A: Okay, could you tell us what's liberal's long term roadmap?
00:04:47.210 - 00:05:26.654, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, sure. So first thing, it's been roughly one year since we started building on Cosmos, and we are so glad of the progress that we could make in the last one year, but we are even more excited about what's coming in the next one year. Especially number one, is we are going to go completely open source, open sourcing our entire world. We already open source key management side of our code base, but our rest of the extension and mobile apps are completely going to be open source first. That's first one thing that we'll be closing. Second is we'll be focusing quite a lot on onboarding of users. For example, this is actually connected to users who are coming newly into cryptocurrency.
00:05:26.654 - 00:06:01.386, Speaker B: We are adding quite a lot of social login features, which is users can log in using their Google, Facebook, or any other social media that they currently use. And at the back end, a non custodial wallet will be created for them and they can just access it using their continue to access it through the social media account. So onboarding is one big piece that we are trying to solve for. The second thing that we are working on is probably metamask naps, essentially that there's 20 million base that is sitting in Ethereum. We want to introduce them to cosmos in the amazing ecosystem that's here. So metamas naps is second one that we are definitely going to focus on. Third one is festivally within the cosmos ecosystem.
00:06:01.386 - 00:06:34.042, Speaker B: Right now, the experience is disconnected. All 50 chains are looked at as separate 50 chains, but the underlying, that underlying tech is not like that. All the chains are in fact connected together. So we want a wallet user experience to reflect that. So we're trying to abstract out chains and show all the balances in one place so that users can play around. So quite a lot of us, simplification and easy movement of liquidity from one chain to other chain, those kind of things, is what we want to experiment with in the coming three months. I think we can do much more in one year, but this is next three months.
00:06:34.042 - 00:06:35.740, Speaker B: Plan for next three months. Wow.
00:06:36.110 - 00:06:38.154, Speaker C: Thank you so much. That was great.
00:06:38.272 - 00:06:44.640, Speaker A: Okay, this is the last question. Is there anything you want to say to korean web3 community?
00:06:45.570 - 00:07:20.326, Speaker B: Sure. So last one week, I caught up with quite a lot of builders from Korea and got to know that the amazing ecosystem in the community of korean web3 users, we would definitely love to hear from you. And first of all, try out our wallet. It supports most of the cost machines you would want to do and have quite a lot of features that's required for you to do your day to day funds management on Cosmos. So yeah, please do try it out and reach out to us on Twitter. We are leap underscore Cosmos and share your feedback and any other pain points that you have with respect to using wallet. And yeah, that's what you like.
00:07:20.326 - 00:07:26.554, Speaker B: And please continue to support amazing builders of Cosmos station in Korea. That's what I will ask for.
00:07:26.672 - 00:07:31.600, Speaker A: What was the first coin that you bought? When was it and why did you buy it? Do you remember?
00:07:32.290 - 00:07:57.218, Speaker B: Oh boy. I think mine actually would be very. What is that answer? Yeah, mine would be a very noob answer. Honestly. The first ecosystem I got introduced to was Terra, so it was Luna USD. That's where I started my crypto journey. I know, right? I think probably Uzalansa, bitcoin, Ethereum.
00:07:57.218 - 00:08:01.830, Speaker B: But yeah, mine's Luna, and I think I'll remember that for life, for obvious reasons.
00:08:03.290 - 00:08:07.138, Speaker A: Thank you for sharing. Thank you for the interview.
00:08:07.234 - 00:08:08.900, Speaker B: Thank you. Thanks for having me.
