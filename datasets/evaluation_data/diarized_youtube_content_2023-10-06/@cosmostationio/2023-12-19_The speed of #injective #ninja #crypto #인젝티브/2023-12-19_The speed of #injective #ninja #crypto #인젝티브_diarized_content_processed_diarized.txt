00:00:00.170 - 00:00:09.146, Speaker A: So injective is very well known for its fast speed. We would like to know how fast is it and what advantages does that bring to the users?
00:00:09.338 - 00:00:18.810, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a great question. Right. So injective, it's subsecond. Right. So right now, I think it's around 700 millisecond per block. So there's one of the fastest chain.
