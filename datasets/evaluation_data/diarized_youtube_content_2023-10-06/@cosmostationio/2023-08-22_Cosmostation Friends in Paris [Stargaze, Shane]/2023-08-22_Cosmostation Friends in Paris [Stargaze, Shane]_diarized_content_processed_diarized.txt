00:00:13.930 - 00:00:15.038, Speaker A: Hi, Shane, how are you?
00:00:15.124 - 00:00:15.998, Speaker B: Hi. How's it going?
00:00:16.084 - 00:00:19.790, Speaker A: Good. Could you briefly introduce yourself to our viewers?
00:00:20.130 - 00:00:26.550, Speaker B: Sure, yeah. I'm shane. I'm a co founder of Stargaze, which is NFT focused app in cosmos.
00:00:27.370 - 00:00:28.406, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:00:28.588 - 00:00:35.480, Speaker A: What made you start Stargaze? And is there a backstory or a motivation behind starting it?
00:00:36.170 - 00:01:13.986, Speaker B: Yeah, there's quite a backstory. So I started Stargaze. It wasn't just me initially, there was three other co founders, including myself. And we were building something that was more like a decentralized social network. And while we were building this, we realized that NFTs were the main content type and there was not much NFTs in cosmos besides Terra. So then we were like, okay, we need to build something that focuses on this. And we did a large airdrop and we got all this community from the airdrop and they were telling us what to build.
00:01:13.986 - 00:01:39.206, Speaker B: And then Stargaze just kind of evolved from that. Right. So then we built marketplace, and then while working on marketplace, we realized, oh, we need a way to launch collections. And then we built Launchpad. So now people can do the whole cycle. They can create NFT collections, they can launch them, they can mint them, and then they can trade in the marketplace.
00:01:39.398 - 00:01:40.314, Speaker A: Great. Awesome.
00:01:40.432 - 00:01:41.340, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:01:41.730 - 00:01:53.150, Speaker A: It's safe to say that Stargaze is the most successful team in the NFT space of interchange. So could you review on accomplishment that you guys have achieved since its launch?
00:01:54.130 - 00:02:24.602, Speaker B: Sure. Yeah. Stargaze has just been very lucky. It kind of really took off inside cosmos. I would say the most successful kind of thing that came out of it was probably bad kids, right. It has really good product market fit within cosmos and outside of cosmos is doing the majority of the volume. But there's plenty of other amazing collections as well.
00:02:24.602 - 00:02:55.300, Speaker B: Right. It's just that there's always this kind of like power law, right. Usually there's three or four or five collections that are always doing really good volume on druggase. Right. There's also pixel wizards, a whole bunch of other collections that are also doing really well and also really kind of proud of the protocols that we built. Marketplace especially.
00:02:55.930 - 00:02:56.406, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:02:56.428 - 00:03:06.230, Speaker A: I'm also holding bad kids. I'm wondering what differentiates stargaze from other NFT marketplaces.
00:03:07.450 - 00:03:31.280, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So the biggest difference. So if you compare stargaze with something like OpenSea, right. Opensea is a centralized Silicon Valley company, right. It is run in a very traditional manner, while Stargaze is community owned, right. Every single thing that happens in Stargaze has gone through the community, gone through community vote, even the airdrop. Right.
00:03:31.280 - 00:04:05.340, Speaker B: As the founding team, we're just kind of like guides for what the community wants. And it sounds cliche, but that's just kind of how everything works, right. If we're working on a new feature, we talk to community about it, get their feedback, and then it goes through governance, and then it gets implemented. So I think that's the real kind of big differentiator, and I think the app chain model is the kind of best model that's suited to build something like that.
00:04:06.830 - 00:04:07.386, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:04:07.408 - 00:04:14.160, Speaker A: That was good. What would be stargaze mission or a challenge that needs to be addressed down the road?
00:04:15.170 - 00:04:44.198, Speaker B: That's a really good question. So right now, onboarding is a challenge, right. Bringing in new people. We started with Cosmos natives, but now we want to expand and bring on people from other ecosystems as well. But even Cosmos natives, right. They have to get the token and everything before they do anything. So solving that is kind of the next kind of challenge that we're working on.
00:04:44.198 - 00:05:03.440, Speaker B: But it's going to happen very soon because we have protocols like skips working on API, the squid. This Cosmos swap great teams. Yeah, they're all great teams. And now the challenge is going to be like, which one of those do we use, or how do we aggregate between all of them?
00:05:04.450 - 00:05:05.440, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:05:05.970 - 00:05:10.270, Speaker A: So what's in Stargate's long term roadmap?
00:05:11.730 - 00:05:52.650, Speaker B: So I think I've shared most of the stuff that we're doing kind of on the roadmap, like, to keep a few things as, like, a little surprise. But I think there's no secret that we are kind of moving into more of kind of like NFT Defi protocol. That's because cosmos is very defi heavy, and Stargaze has always been a little bit of an outsider because it doesn't have any Defi right now. And we want to kind of bring the communities together. We want Defi people to play around with NFTs. We want NFT people to play around with Defi. So we're working on an NFT amm.
00:05:52.650 - 00:06:02.400, Speaker B: We're also working on NFT staking. Yeah. A whole bunch of other things like that. And there's a lot more coming there.
00:06:03.190 - 00:06:04.194, Speaker A: Looking forward to it.
00:06:04.232 - 00:06:05.106, Speaker B: Yeah. Thank you.
00:06:05.208 - 00:06:05.778, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:06:05.864 - 00:06:13.410, Speaker A: Is there anything you want to say to korean web3 community or stargaze aficionados?
00:06:14.630 - 00:06:43.520, Speaker B: Yeah. Let us come join our community. Come hang out in the discord and telegram. We also have language channels, and there's a korean language channel as well. So come and hang out. Tell us what you want what you want to be built. I know there's a lot of you guys who are also bad kids fans, so, yeah, come to a discord and hang out.
00:06:43.890 - 00:06:45.770, Speaker A: Thank you so much. Thank you for the interview.
00:06:45.850 - 00:06:48.060, Speaker B: Awesome. Thank you. Close.
