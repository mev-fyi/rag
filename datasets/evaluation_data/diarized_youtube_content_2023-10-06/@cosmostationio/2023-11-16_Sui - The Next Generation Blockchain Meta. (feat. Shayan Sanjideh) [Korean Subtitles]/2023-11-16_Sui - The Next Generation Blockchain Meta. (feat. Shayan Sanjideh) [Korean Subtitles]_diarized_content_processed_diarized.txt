00:00:12.090 - 00:00:18.670, Speaker A: What was the driving force behind creation of sui? And what prevailing problem was sui trying to solve?
00:00:20.290 - 00:01:03.550, Speaker B: So our founders now at Miston Labs, were working on the Libra or DM project at Facebook, right? Once that project came under regulatory scrutiny, that it was dissolved and Miston Labs suite was born. So one of the guiding lights, one of the biggest points of suite, why suite was created, was that we saw that the founders at least saw that there was a lot of problems in the blockchain space today. Ethereum, for example, is very expensive. It's very expensive to transact on Ethereum. It's relatively slow or pretty slow, depending on what metric you want to use. So it's slow, inefficient, bound to hacks. We've seen over nine figures USD getting hacked over the past few years.
00:01:03.550 - 00:01:26.520, Speaker B: And if we really do want to create the future of finance, then the infrastructure to do so needs to be equally as robust as well. So that's where suite comes in. And suite hopes to be this next new generation, next level performative blockchain that can really satisfy whatever use case, whatever blockchain use case, I should say, of anyone anywhere in the world.
00:01:28.410 - 00:01:43.600, Speaker A: So Sui is an object oriented blockchain. So I want to know, what does that mean and what advantages does it bring to the users compared to the conventional blockchains like Ethereum? You just mentioned some, but we would like to know more about it.
00:01:44.770 - 00:02:13.666, Speaker B: So one of the biggest things that we like to tout or advertise about Sui is its object or asset centricity. So existing blockchains, such as Ethereum use an account based model. And in my opinion, at least, it's very unintuitive how it works. Sui, however, takes. So anything important on Sui is an object. So this could be a token. NFT, any other in game asset, they're all represented as objects.
00:02:13.666 - 00:02:53.650, Speaker B: And I think this is very simply intuitive because that's how we humans intuit what money items, whatever money items or anything. So I think that this paradigm makes it very easy and intuitive to onboard. Next. However, many millions of developers, hopefully millions of users, billions of users one day. And this is reflected in the novel programming language that Sui utilizes, Sui move. That reflects that every unique instance of data on the blockchain is also represented as an object, which can be analogous to an asset.
00:02:55.690 - 00:03:02.520, Speaker A: So who is Sui network for? Is there any specific target user group that Sui is focusing on?
00:03:04.250 - 00:03:33.390, Speaker B: Well, I mean, I would say that beginning of every meeting that we have, we say, what are we doing this for? We want to be able to make Sui relevant to everyone in the world. So if we want to do that, it's a pretty lofty goal. But nevertheless, if we do want to do that, it's important that we cover all our bases. Right. So we're not saying that, oh, Sui is the gaming blockchain. Sui is the defi blockchain. No, we want Sui to be, like a public good for anyone to use.
00:03:33.460 - 00:03:33.742, Speaker A: Right.
00:03:33.796 - 00:03:44.734, Speaker B: So the way I like to see it is that blockchains in general, and I think Sui in particular, should be modeled as this public good that anyone can utilize.
00:03:44.782 - 00:03:44.994, Speaker A: Right.
00:03:45.032 - 00:04:25.726, Speaker B: So if you're a developer looking to build a game, if you're a business that wants to use Sui for a novel use case, we think that the Sui network, the swee blockchain, should be open for any and all use cases. So, yeah, to answer your question, there is no one target demographic we're targeting, but rather we want to make it such that anybody will be able to use SuI and not necessarily have to worry about how it works. So the same way we warm our food every day in the microwave or use a car without being electrical or mechanical engineers, I think it's also important that Sui should be relevant for people without people having to be. Have a PhD in computer science.
00:04:25.758 - 00:04:25.954, Speaker A: Right.
00:04:25.992 - 00:04:35.166, Speaker B: So the same way we can use a microwave, like a five year old could use a microwave. Ideally, that would be how blockchain works for the masses.
00:04:35.198 - 00:04:46.280, Speaker A: Yeah, that makes sense. So I'm wondering, what are some areas Sui is focusing on right now? Is there any new updates that are coming up soon?
00:04:47.530 - 00:05:12.058, Speaker B: So I guess it's like before that, it's important to go over that. There is like a million different l ones out there. Right. And we think that should swee see success in the next few years. There needs to be a moat. There needs to be something differentiating us. So currently, we were talking about this earlier, but one of the biggest things that suite brings to the table is, like, its sole object centricity or asset centricity.
00:05:12.058 - 00:05:51.946, Speaker B: That's one of the things that I believe makes programming assets and using assets just more intuitive. But there's a lot that suite does underneath the hood as well, such as computation, parallelization. So if there are several different transactions that are occurring, touching different space in the blockchain. So let's say there's some touching deFi, like a Dex, there's some interacting with an NFT, and there's some just simply transferring tokens. Those are unrelated to each other. And suite recognizes this and you're able to actually execute those transactions in parallel. This is what's available on suite today.
00:05:51.946 - 00:06:34.534, Speaker B: This is also relatively novel in regards to blockchain technology because legacy of blockchains such as Ethereum, for example, every single transaction needs to wait in the same line for the same block to actually go from when that transaction is first submitted to that block's finality. Right? So Sui says, hey, if there's different types of transactions occurring on a blockchain, why should they have to wait in the same line when they have nothing to do with each other? So this is like pre answering your question, what is suite working on? This is what Sui has out of the box right now. Some stuff that Sui is working on that one of the things that Sui is working on that I'm really excited for is what's called ZK Login. Zk Login?
00:06:34.582 - 00:06:34.890, Speaker A: Yes.
00:06:34.960 - 00:07:06.818, Speaker B: So ZK Login hopes to onboard the masses with simple one click wallet creation. So the same way, like today, you can sign up for a new website with your Google, Apple ID, Facebook, or whatever, you'd be able to do the same thing with creating a suite public private key. So a lot of the geniuses over at Miston Labs have been working on this cryptography to enable a one to one account, like web, two account, Google, Facebook, whatever, to generate a new public private key suite address.
00:07:06.904 - 00:07:07.298, Speaker A: Wow.
00:07:07.384 - 00:07:49.102, Speaker B: So that's one of the things. Another thing, yeah, I would say another thing that I'm also very excited for is the fact that suite, again, out of the box supports many different ways to sign transactions, supports many different elliptic curves out of the box. And one of them is using the same enclave that is found in iPhones and Androids today. So you would be able to essentially sign transactions with a public private key, a Sui public private key generated from the actual hardware in your smartphone. And I think that's something that totally doesn't exist with any other blockchain today. And I think that in of itself is like a new project or DAP.
00:07:49.166 - 00:07:49.490, Speaker A: Right?
00:07:49.560 - 00:08:07.080, Speaker B: So I think once the word is out there, once more people are aware that this technology exists, it'll be very interesting to see how swee and I guess blockchain technology in general can become more relevant to the average user, the average Joe. Right.
00:08:08.990 - 00:08:16.570, Speaker A: I would like to know what are some dynamic NFTs on SuI and how are the ecosystem projects utilizing.
00:08:19.790 - 00:09:17.146, Speaker B: Things that one of the biggest technologies that Sui also has out of the box right now are dynamic fields which can be used to power dynamic NFTs. So if the way suite works is that at least a way that dynamic NFTs on suite work are that let's say you have a particular in game asset with a set number of fields. Let's say you're creating a sword and the sword has one field that has sharpness, level, et cetera, right? On any traditional blockchain, once you have written programmed that field in, it's there, it's static, you can't change it. The biggest thing with dynamic fields is that you can actually add fields literally in the name. You can add fields to assets dynamically on the run, on the fly. So if you're programming a game and you decide, oh, hey, I want to add this one sticker to it. Let's say I have a store, that example probably don't add stickers to store, let's say a jewel.
00:09:17.146 - 00:10:30.434, Speaker B: So enchant it, right? You would be able to dynamically add such a field to that actual sword object. So what does that mean? It essentially creates hierarchical parent child objects within assets and suite. And one of the biggest things that this does is that it actually enables more web two like use cases. So in the web two world, where you're able to equip armor, decip armor, add customizations to objects, in the web two world, it's very easy, right? Because you can program whatever you want without having to worry about, oh, am I spending too much gas? Is this transaction going to take too long? Is it going to congest the network? You don't have to worry about stuff like that. And I think one of the biggest things that suite brings to the table is this web two like feel of being able to compose assets with each other, being able to create these hierarchical parent child objects with each other, all in an effort to really, like I said, go back to the beginning, make suite a more fluid blockchain, make it more relevant to people without having to worry about, oh, am I using a blockchain?
00:10:30.482 - 00:10:30.646, Speaker A: Right.
00:10:30.668 - 00:11:02.030, Speaker B: Because I think at the end of the day, the technology shouldn't actually matter. It should be about the user experience. So can we provide user with a seamless user experience? I think that's like the best question that we need to ask ourselves, and that's the end goal that we're going towards. So, long story short, but the biggest thing with dynamic NFPs is being able to provide more novel use cases that blockchain technology simply could not have fulfilled up until now because the technology was limited.
00:11:02.530 - 00:11:03.740, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you so much.
