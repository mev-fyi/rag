00:00:00.330 - 00:00:37.858, Speaker A: And what we really, really believe in is exchange of value. Right? So a lot of people think that say it's just like a Defi chain. So I get asked that a lot. But actually it's not true for us. We build a chain, so technically you could do like NFTs and all that kind of stuff. We're not really like DydX, which is just an application chain just for training. For us, it's more like we believe in exchange of value and how we build the chain with the central limit order book system with that front running MEP protection, it's all actually advantages for arbitrage opportunities and for traders to really come in and trade.
