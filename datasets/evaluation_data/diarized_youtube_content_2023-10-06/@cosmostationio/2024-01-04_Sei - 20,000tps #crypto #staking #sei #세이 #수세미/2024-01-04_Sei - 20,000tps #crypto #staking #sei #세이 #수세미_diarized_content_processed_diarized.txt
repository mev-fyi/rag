00:00:00.250 - 00:00:10.030, Speaker A: So say is very like well known for being super fast. So we would like to know how fast is it and what advantages does it bring to the users?
00:00:11.330 - 00:00:36.502, Speaker B: Don't quote me on this. I think it's about like 20,000 plus TPS. I think like, okay, like for blockchain when it's fast, right. I've been there in the previous buron. Right. And you, frankly speaking, when you have that many people actually using, for example, you only have like 200 GPS per second. That means technically a blockchain can only process 200 transactions per second.
00:00:36.502 - 00:00:40.820, Speaker B: Right. Is that really scalable for mean web two users? No. Right. Like.
