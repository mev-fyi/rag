00:00:00.250 - 00:00:54.970, Speaker A: So the motivation of celestia is to solve a few key problems in blockchain infrastructure. The first one is scalability. So Celestia is trying to make it possible for you to have a blockchain that doesn't have a fixed finite block space, but can actually expand the amount of transactions it can process with the number of nodes in the network. So that's a really big motivation. Another one is that Celestia wants to give more choice and power and flexibility to developers. So what Celestia does is it's modularized the blockchain stack in a way that enables developers to actually customize and have more choice over which sort of components and how they build their applications in a way that you can't get if you're building a smart tracked. So those are the two really big things that Celestia is trying to solve.
