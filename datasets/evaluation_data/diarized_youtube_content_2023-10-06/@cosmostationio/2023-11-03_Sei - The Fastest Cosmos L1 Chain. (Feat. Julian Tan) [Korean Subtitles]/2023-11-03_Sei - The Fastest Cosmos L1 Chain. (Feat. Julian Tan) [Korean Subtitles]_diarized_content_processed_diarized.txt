00:00:12.570 - 00:00:13.742, Speaker A: Hi Julian, how are you?
00:00:13.796 - 00:00:15.230, Speaker B: I'm good. Yourself?
00:00:15.380 - 00:00:19.582, Speaker A: Great, thank you. Could you briefly introduce yourself to our viewers please?
00:00:19.636 - 00:00:22.942, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. Hey, I'm julian. I'm with say now.
00:00:22.996 - 00:00:23.166, Speaker C: Right.
00:00:23.188 - 00:00:40.458, Speaker B: So at say right now I handle know all the infrastructure on say example. You can erpz archive and all that. Basically making sure that everyone or all the devs that's looking to build on say, they have the necessary tools to actually build the kind of stuff that they need on say.
00:00:40.544 - 00:00:40.890, Speaker C: Right.
00:00:40.960 - 00:01:00.378, Speaker B: Apart from that, I also help out in terms of building out the granted investment framework per se. So a lot of working very closely with other kind of BDs and all that kind of stuff on say to really make sure that we structure the deal right. That's comfortable for both the foundation as well as projects.
00:01:00.474 - 00:01:03.120, Speaker A: Great. Thank you so much. Where are you based?
00:01:03.650 - 00:01:09.106, Speaker B: I am from Singapore, but I'm currently living out in Korea right now, at least for a short time.
00:01:09.208 - 00:01:10.580, Speaker A: How do you like it?
00:01:11.430 - 00:01:17.442, Speaker B: The weather would have been a lot better, to be honest. But I guess I'm used to it because Singapore is pretty hot, humid.
00:01:17.506 - 00:01:17.734, Speaker C: Right.
00:01:17.772 - 00:01:27.000, Speaker B: So now Korea is like what, coming end of summer ish? So I'm pretty much looking forward to author Miso's winter to come.
00:01:28.510 - 00:01:37.846, Speaker A: Thank you. We would like to know what was the motivation behind the creation of say and what problem is say trying to solve.
00:01:38.038 - 00:02:38.590, Speaker B: Well, I think when you look at a lot of the l ones out there and all that kind of stuff, I think everyone can agree that liquidity is pretty much inefficient, right? And of course not to share any other chain or anything, but when you look at some of the chains that is mostly well used, like Ethereum and all that kind of stuff, they have gas limits and they're not as fast as people like it to be, right? So if you're talking about a lot of different kind of web, two narratives to move on into those, some of the infrastructure just pretty much unusable, right? And that's why you see a lot of l tools, a lot of zksync and all that kind of stuff coming on, because everyone's trying to solve the same problem, which is basically scalability, right? So for say, I guess when we look at all the liquidity, inefficiencies and all the other kind of stuff and the problems that they are currently solving, I think our mission statement is that we want to build and provide first class infrastructure for developers to come in.
00:02:38.660 - 00:02:39.902, Speaker C: To build on, right?
00:02:40.036 - 00:03:25.280, Speaker B: And what we really, really believe in is exchange of value, right? So a lot of people think that say it's just like a defi chain. So I get asked that a lot. But actually it's not true for us. We build a chain, so technically you could do NFTs and audit stuff. We're not really like DYDX, which is just an application chain just for trading. For us, it's more like we believe in exchange of value and how we build the chain with the central limit order book system with that front running MEP protection, it's all actually advantages for arbitrage opportunities and for traders to really come in and trade. Right? But first of all, developers need to build, right? So we design the chain in a way that is pretty fast.
00:03:25.280 - 00:04:19.182, Speaker B: We design the chain with all those kind of protections and all the kind of stuff that I mentioned because we want to really bring across that we are priding ourselves of being able to provide the infrastructure to facilitate efficient and high quality exchange of value. And this also then transcends above defi into NFT gameplay, whatever, right? Because even if you're looking to purchase NFTs or you're looking to buy games or play games on the blockchain, at some point you either need to buy the native token for gas fees you need to purchase NFTs, or you might even need to buy or sell your play to earn tokens or whatever, right? And all of those are actually exchangeable in terms of what's available on, say, right now we have Lavana, which is like a derivative trading protocol. You love the product.
00:04:19.236 - 00:04:19.710, Speaker C: Have you tried.
00:04:19.780 - 00:05:16.386, Speaker B: Okay, we have like a couple of Emms of Uzio and all that kind of soft fuzzy is also developing like a prediction market. We have two games right now that's live and we will have more to come. So far, I think the pipeline wise we have about 1020 that's going live in the next one, two months. Most of them are actually finishing the final stages of their audits and stuff. So I would say I'm pretty much excited on what's to come. No chain is perfect, right? Frankly speaking, I will be very impressed if a chain will launch on day one and have 100 apps, right? It's a journey, right? And we know where we want to go and we know what we want to bring to the webtoon. So for all the safe community people and all that, that's like following us and all that kind of stuff, it's going to be a wild ride, I hope.
00:05:16.488 - 00:05:30.470, Speaker A: Yeah. Thank you so much. I'm very excited. So say is very well known for being super fast. So we would like to know how fast is it and what advantages does it bring to the users.
00:05:31.770 - 00:05:57.262, Speaker B: Don't quote me on this. I think it's about 20,000 plus TPS. I think. Okay. For a blockchain when it's fast, I've been there in the previous Burun and frankly speaking, when you have that many people actually using, for example, you only have like 200 gps per second. That means technically a blockchain can only process 200 transactions per second. Right.
00:05:57.262 - 00:06:00.606, Speaker B: Is that really scalable for mean web two users? No.
00:06:00.708 - 00:06:01.310, Speaker C: Right.
00:06:01.460 - 00:06:11.474, Speaker B: If you're talking about at this point, we're probably at the tipping, just tip of the iceberg in terms of bringing the real world into web3.
00:06:11.592 - 00:06:12.066, Speaker C: Right?
00:06:12.168 - 00:06:22.582, Speaker B: And a lot of these during the bull run, ethereum can't keep up. Solana broke down so many freaking times, we're just not ready.
00:06:22.636 - 00:06:22.998, Speaker C: Right.
00:06:23.084 - 00:06:24.950, Speaker B: So we had to make it as fast as possible.
00:06:25.020 - 00:06:25.254, Speaker C: Right?
00:06:25.292 - 00:06:50.830, Speaker B: I mean, the faster it is, the higher the gas ceiling and all that kind of stuff. That means more transaction can be processed and I guess everyone's pretty much pampered like current markets, you wouldn't want to click a button and wait for a transaction to sign and be stuck there waiting for what? 512, 30 minutes, 60 minutes just for a minus to process or anything, right? You want it to be fast, you want it to be seamless.
00:06:53.410 - 00:07:04.242, Speaker A: So say just had mainnet launch event last month. So what is say focusing on at this early stage and what would be the next step for say, our focus.
00:07:04.296 - 00:07:11.430, Speaker B: Is definitely one, Devs, right? Number two, ensuring that the ecosystem has the necessary tools to actually really bring in.
00:07:11.500 - 00:07:11.782, Speaker C: Right.
00:07:11.836 - 00:07:32.138, Speaker B: And your previous question, I also mentioned that we are working on a couple of dev support kind of initiatives as well. So we're definitely doing all of those in terms of what's the next step. Well, hopefully the burund comes back soon or anyone. And I think everyone in the industry is pretty much having a tough time.
00:07:32.224 - 00:07:32.860, Speaker C: Right.
00:07:33.730 - 00:07:42.590, Speaker B: And I think the logical step is to make sure that we're ready to usher in, be it web two users or the next paradigm of whatever people be interested in.
00:07:42.660 - 00:07:51.138, Speaker A: Right. Thank you so much. And for those who want to learn more about say, as a beginner, how can they get started?
00:07:51.304 - 00:08:36.586, Speaker B: I think you can check out our socials, of course, socials, Twitter discord, one of them as think, you know, our co founder Jay has done a lot of interviews with CMDC in this case and all that kind of stuff and talking a lot about the technical stuff about say, what makes it different from other kind, you know, you can always search it up on YouTube. That's also another way. And of course for developers and all that kind of stuff, if you're coding in rust and cosmos and you're intending to deploy and say, and you don't know those languages, I would say check those out. Else, looking at our technical documentation on our website, right. That's the pretty much easiest way to learn about safe.
00:08:36.618 - 00:08:37.170, Speaker A: Yeah, of course.
00:08:37.240 - 00:09:03.226, Speaker B: And of course if you're crypto guys or communities like come to our events, we're doing a couple of events in the next couple of weeks in token 23 nine. And now that Mainet, Mainet is launched and a huge distraction is off our plate, we're also focusing a lot in terms of growing the ecosystem, growing the community. So we'll have a lot of every now and then events and community meetups and community events. So yeah, just join us.
00:09:03.408 - 00:09:04.634, Speaker A: That's great. Thank you so much.
00:09:04.672 - 00:09:05.420, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:09:06.670 - 00:09:14.698, Speaker A: Last question. Is there anything you want to say to the potential users or builders in Korea?
00:09:14.874 - 00:09:36.978, Speaker B: In Korea? Well, when we actually launched, I was actually pretty much, I would say shocked, but shocked is not the right word to use. I think impressed would be the right word to use. I think the korean users, korean developers are, I would say very unique.
00:09:37.074 - 00:09:37.720, Speaker C: Right.
00:09:39.290 - 00:09:53.030, Speaker B: If you look at the exchange trading volume, just looking across all exchanges, worldwide update doesn't even have derivatives market and all that kind of stuff, they're top ten. It's just insane. So korean people actually really crazy about crypto.
00:09:53.110 - 00:09:54.362, Speaker A: Crazy about crypto, yeah.
00:09:54.496 - 00:10:39.974, Speaker B: And that means the developers are as well. I would say the trading volume on update was three or five X, way higher than what it was on finance on launch day. So you can actually see that crane users and developers really love say. Sure, hopefully we can get more of those to actually be more active in our community, not just farming those airdrops but really deploying more dapps and all that kind of stuff. And yeah, I mean, right now it's KBW. We have a couple of events and we'll have more and more to come, definitely. Korea is a very strategic market for us.
00:10:40.092 - 00:10:40.614, Speaker C: Right.
00:10:40.732 - 00:10:50.286, Speaker B: So yeah, korean people and developers, they don't need to, I guess they wouldn't be forgotten. They're always around us.
00:10:50.428 - 00:10:52.222, Speaker A: You. Thank you so much.
00:10:52.276 - 00:10:52.574, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:10:52.612 - 00:10:56.490, Speaker A: So we cover all the questions. Thank you so much for interviewing.
