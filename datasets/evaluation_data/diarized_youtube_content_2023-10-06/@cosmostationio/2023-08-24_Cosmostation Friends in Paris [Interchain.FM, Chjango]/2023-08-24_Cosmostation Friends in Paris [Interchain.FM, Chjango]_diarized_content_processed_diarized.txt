00:00:13.370 - 00:00:14.734, Speaker A: Hi, Chango. How are you? Hi.
00:00:14.772 - 00:00:16.606, Speaker B: I'm good. Thanks for having me.
00:00:16.708 - 00:00:22.858, Speaker A: Thank you. Thanks for joining the interview. Could you briefly introduce yourself to our viewers?
00:00:23.034 - 00:00:23.422, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:00:23.476 - 00:00:50.926, Speaker B: I'm Chango Unchained. I host the Cosmos radio station interchange FM. I was part of building the cosmos ecosystem from the genesis. And I run a validator called Interchange FM. I'm an advisor to a few Cosmos projects, notably osmosis. And, yeah, I've just been working to grow Cosmos adoption for a very long time.
00:00:51.028 - 00:01:03.700, Speaker A: Wow. Okay. I watched your boxing match at Osmocon yesterday, and it was so intense. Actually, your match was my favorite one. So how did you feel?
00:01:04.470 - 00:01:04.930, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:01:05.000 - 00:01:46.494, Speaker B: So over the years, you just develop so much stress and tension in your body because you go through so much drama. There's, like, post traumatic stress disorder from working in a very close knit, high pressure team. Now, a lot of Cosmos community members can outwardly perceive the drama that happens in Cosmos. But imagine that for three and a half years, all internally, while trying to project an outward veneer of having everything together. And it's all cool. We're going to launch mainnet. But in reality, everyone was like.
00:01:46.494 - 00:02:02.766, Speaker B: And so to have that internal aggression let loose on another willing participant felt really good. And I'm sore today. It's been one day. We did it yesterday, and my body's really sore, but it's, like, a good kind of sore.
00:02:02.958 - 00:02:06.846, Speaker A: I can imagine. It was so intense and so entertaining.
00:02:06.878 - 00:02:07.330, Speaker C: Of course.
00:02:07.400 - 00:02:08.020, Speaker B: Yes.
00:02:08.630 - 00:02:13.042, Speaker A: Thank you. Could you introduce entertain FM to our viewers?
00:02:13.186 - 00:02:47.930, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. So entertain FM started in the end of 2019. So it was the first Cosmos podcast. The reason we had to do that was because this preceded people knowing about cosmos, understanding about cosmos, caring about cosmos. So we internally conceived, you know, why don't we do our own Cosmos podcast? And interchange FM was born. I had my co host. He's the IBC core developer, the person who designed the spec, Christopher Goats.
00:02:47.930 - 00:03:09.190, Speaker B: He was my original. But then, you know, ever since he started anoma, we kind of broke off and did our own things. So now I'm the singular single host. And that's the genesis of interchange mean. Oh, man. If you talk to a newbie about crypto, the learning curve is just so steep.
00:03:09.270 - 00:03:11.594, Speaker A: I know myself.
00:03:11.712 - 00:03:47.074, Speaker B: Right, exactly. And to you, it may feel it's not even, like, a steep incline. It's, like, inverted, and you're just like, come on, I just learned this thing, and now you can throw it. But I'm just trying to make it more easy to navigate. And that's what interchange goal is. Yeah, it's really a public good. We started off with it being a cosmos ecosystem specific podcast, but as the space evolves, it's all going to blend together, and ultimately the layer zeros and the layer ones are going to be abstracted away from the end user.
00:03:47.074 - 00:04:01.786, Speaker B: So the end goal of interchange FM is to have it be generalized to talk about blockchain scaling and extensibility, because that's ultimately what all of these different permutations of scaling architectures are going to end up being.
00:04:01.968 - 00:04:13.582, Speaker A: That's so amazing. Okay. You are one of the Cosmos oGs. So do you feel that interchange ecosystem has grown over the years? How do you feel?
00:04:13.636 - 00:04:53.942, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, absolutely analog of the ecosystem. It's like a kid, like a little baby. So at the beginning, before Mainet launch, you just had the baby, the baby's being incubated, and then mainet launch happens, and then the baby is born and you have a toddler, but you have to do everything. You have to wipe its butt, you have to feed it in order for it to survive. And so it's really handholding. You need to bootstrap everything. There's a lot of work goes into it, but now it's grown so much that there's a flywheel effect and the child is becoming independent.
00:04:53.942 - 00:05:35.830, Speaker B: So now there's people who use the technology, able to speak to the technology, like the protocols itself, so that it's not just the core, like as a podcaster, it's not just like the internal team podcasting about it, right? There's like a bunch of other people doing it. Shout out cryptocito. Shout out Liam Connor. Shout out Don Kryptonium. These guys are great, right? There's a whole bunch and you guys doing a podcast or whatever this is, whatever. There's a flywheel effect, and then the toddler becomes a child, and then the child becomes a teenager, and then it becomes a fully fledged adult, and then it's just not going anywhere. It's going to start totally independent.
00:05:37.130 - 00:05:50.880, Speaker A: Thank you so much. That was great. You're also an advisor to osmosis, and there are so many developments happening in the ecosystem. How are you envisioning the future of osmosis in coming few months?
00:05:51.570 - 00:06:38.394, Speaker B: In the next few months, if the time frame is a few months, it's like not too much to talk about. There's a lot of improvements on capital efficiency, so that's notable. However, the next few years, that's where users are going to see the real major difference. The ecosystem is consistently growing, and it's like a very intentional ecosystem growth in the direction of a vertically stacked suite of DFI protocols. So the most notable extension of the spot amm is going to be OMX. It's the GMX of Cosmos. OMX is going to allow you to leverage trade at 50 x.
00:06:38.394 - 00:07:05.434, Speaker B: It's going to get all the Dgens in here. Really? And it's going to be able to be built, it's built on top of the liquidity moat that osmosis already has. Osmosis is going to continue iterating in that direction of providing CFI quality user experience, but without the CFI setbacks.
00:07:05.502 - 00:07:13.254, Speaker A: Okay, thank you. Is there anything you want to say to korean web3 community in general?
00:07:13.452 - 00:07:15.590, Speaker B: Oh, Kansamida.
00:07:18.970 - 00:07:20.150, Speaker C: Chugele.
00:07:23.050 - 00:07:23.922, Speaker A: You want to die?
00:07:23.986 - 00:07:24.600, Speaker C: Yes.
00:07:24.910 - 00:07:46.100, Speaker B: I used to watch korean dramas back when I was in college. That was a long time ago. And Opa, is that in a sexual context? No, that's kind of like friendly, friendly way to call older brothers. Okay, older guys.
00:07:47.190 - 00:07:47.554, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:07:47.592 - 00:08:00.600, Speaker B: Those are all the words I know. I like that one better. Yes. Thank you. Yeah. Other than that, I love you, cosmostation. I use you guys to do a whole bunch of different things and keep doing great work.
00:08:01.050 - 00:08:07.480, Speaker A: Thank you so much. What was the first coin that you bought? When was it and why did you buy it? Do you remember?
00:08:07.870 - 00:08:39.486, Speaker B: The first coin I ever bought was bitcoin. So in 2014, I was looking for passive investment vehicles because I was thinking of leaving my job. I used to work at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, at the NASA laboratory. They specialized in sending the Mars rover, obviously, to Mars. And I hung out with one of my friends. He was a bitcoin miner, my college friend, and he told me about bitcoin as an investment vehicle. That same day, I bought some bitcoin.
00:08:39.486 - 00:08:46.850, Speaker B: And two months later, exactly two months later, I quit my job and went full, deep into bitcoin.
00:08:46.930 - 00:08:47.270, Speaker A: Wow.
00:08:47.340 - 00:09:27.342, Speaker B: But it wouldn't be for another year and a half to two years before I actually joined a reputable project and actually was being paid as part of the industry. So I was working for free, getting myself up the learning curve to figure out what this whole thing was about. My friend was a bitcoin miner, so he was very technical. He was like an engineer. So he told me about how Utxos work. He told me about how proof of work works, and then he explained the concept of decentralization. And so I was always drawn to the technical.
00:09:27.342 - 00:09:52.566, Speaker B: So from then I understood that this is the future of money. I don't know, it's like something instantly clicked, right when something clicks for you and then I'm someone who dives head first. All right, I'm going to quit my job and just do that. And I've never gotten out ever since and will never leave.
00:09:52.748 - 00:09:53.382, Speaker C: For real.
00:09:53.436 - 00:09:54.550, Speaker A: On Og.
00:09:55.050 - 00:09:55.800, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:09:57.130 - 00:10:19.070, Speaker B: That time coincided with when I was exploring what I was supposed to do with my life, so it matched up with my hero's journey. And then after a year and a half of introspection and traveling the world with a backpack, I figured out that it was crypto.
00:10:19.970 - 00:10:21.502, Speaker A: Okay. Thank you so much.
00:10:21.556 - 00:10:21.774, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:10:21.812 - 00:10:22.750, Speaker A: Thank you for your time.
00:10:22.820 - 00:10:23.340, Speaker B: Yeah, thank you.
