00:00:13.370 - 00:00:14.170, Speaker A: Hi, Zucky.
00:00:14.250 - 00:00:15.370, Speaker B: Hi, Chloe.
00:00:15.530 - 00:00:17.150, Speaker A: Can you introduce yourself?
00:00:17.300 - 00:00:25.910, Speaker B: Yeah, my name is Zucky. I've been a contributor to Cosmo since 2014. I'm co founder of a project called Similia Finance.
00:00:27.210 - 00:00:31.638, Speaker A: Very good. What was the first coin that you bought? When was it and why did you buy it?
00:00:31.724 - 00:00:43.770, Speaker B: I mean, the first coin I bought was bitcoin. I probably bought bitcoin in like 2013. I mean, at the time that was like all there was. Wow, 2013.
00:00:44.270 - 00:00:58.720, Speaker A: You've been contributing to the interchain ecosystem for a long time, ever since you were director at Penerman. So how do you feel about the growth of interchain ecosystem in general?
00:00:59.730 - 00:01:44.240, Speaker B: I think what's most exciting is all of the sort of new founders and new projects that are coming into the ecosystem. For the last few years, the ecosystem is dominated by people who were at AIB, right? Who were at Tendermint, and like the diaspora of people coming out of tendermint, founding all these projects. But now we have a whole new generation of people. Projects like, you know, that are completely coming, have none of this baggage who are just building on us. I'm also really excited about just everything that skip is doing. And then we have all these xterra teams like TFM and Lavana that are building really exciting things. TFM is one of the most.
00:01:44.240 - 00:01:53.546, Speaker B: It makes the experience of using Cosmos so much better and comes from a completely different team that has no connection to the original Cosmos.
00:01:53.658 - 00:02:00.782, Speaker A: Tendermint folks, the interchain ecosystem still got some room for improvement?
00:02:00.926 - 00:02:02.322, Speaker B: Oh, absolutely, yeah.
00:02:02.376 - 00:02:06.900, Speaker A: So what do you think is the main quest? Right.
00:02:10.390 - 00:03:42.878, Speaker B: Mean? I think one of the more interesting things is user numbers in Cosmos have been basically flat for the last year. We haven't really seen any growth in users, while Ethereum l two ecosystem has massively grown in terms of active wallets, et cetera. And so really what we need to do, I mean, the most important thing is to bring growth back to Cosmos and start onboarding new users. And I think one of the things that you're seeing, again with what DyDx is doing with their approach is they're building a cosmos chain that feels like an ethereum L two, where there's that mental friction of transitioning ecosystems is sort of not there. And I think that's probably one of the most important things that Cosmos has to do, is we have to, as much as we love Kepler and we have to make our ecosystem feel a lot less intimidating and foreign to other people from other chains, I also think that we're going to see a lot of changes to like, I think things like, one of the things that I'm excited about with celestial launching and roll kit is the ability for people to start building app chains without having to have a staking token right from the beginning. I think that will also make a big difference in just terms of really starting to build apps. Let them get users before they launch a token.
00:03:42.878 - 00:03:45.890, Speaker B: It's going to, I think, make a big difference to the ecosystem.
00:03:46.870 - 00:03:49.150, Speaker A: You are the founder of Somalier.
00:03:49.230 - 00:03:49.998, Speaker B: Co founder.
00:03:50.094 - 00:03:54.066, Speaker A: Co founder, yeah. You're the co founder of Somalier Sommelier Finance.
00:03:54.098 - 00:03:54.390, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:03:54.460 - 00:03:59.882, Speaker A: Which is one of the most valuable projects in the interchange ecosystem, I would say.
00:04:00.016 - 00:04:46.562, Speaker B: Well, I think we're like number seven in TVL of Cosmos chains. And of those chains that we're behind, it's like a bunch of them are exchange chains. We're very rapidly becoming like one. And I think we're going to start seeing our flagship. Okay. Again, sommelier is again trying to bridge this gap between sort of using Cosmos technology, but going after the large market of Ethereum users and Ethereum defi. So we're a Cosmos chain, but our apps are exposed to users through smart contracts on Ethereum.
00:04:46.562 - 00:05:26.558, Speaker B: And when you're using our app, you don't feel like you're using a Cosmos app, you feel like you're using an Ethereum app. And we're generating yields from the large volume of Ethereum D Five. But I do think opportunities to do more with similia products in Cosmos are starting to happen. One, the Osmosis V 16 upgrade does bring about the ability to do some of the things that we're doing and the need to do some of the things we do on Ethereum. Like similier manages a very large uniswap. Lp positions several million dollars using concentrated liquidity. We've built up all this expertise.
00:05:26.558 - 00:06:05.374, Speaker B: It's very exciting. Concentrated liquidity is now coming to osmosis. And then the other thing is real yield ETH could be start being used in more and more parts of cosmos. You could use it as collateral for IST. We can build pools on it with concentrated liquidity on osmosis. I think one of the big things that osmosis really needs to do to sort of get to the next level is actually build markets for liquid staking tokens. As a practical matter, the largest cash flows in crypto right now, and the largest opportunities are all around, both like Ethereum proof of stake and sort of the wider proof of stake space.
00:06:05.374 - 00:06:15.422, Speaker B: So, like the liquid staking module, which is another thing I've been working on coming to the Cosmos hub should enable very large growth of liquid staking in the IBC ecosystem.
00:06:15.566 - 00:06:19.682, Speaker A: What differentiates somewhere from other defi app chains?
00:06:19.826 - 00:07:03.282, Speaker B: Yeah. So, basically, what's happening is you are seeing DFI getting more and more complex, right? Like all these DFI protocols. So, DFI, summer 2020, the user experience was, you just walk up some capital, you get some farming tokens. That's it. But now all of these positions have to be managed and rebalanced on an ongoing basis. And so what we've done with sommelier is we've made products that know if you wanted to use Fraxalin, for instance, you would have to be constantly monitoring whether or not you're providing liquidity to the right pools. Our fraximal vault just does that for you.
00:07:03.282 - 00:08:09.420, Speaker B: And we really use the power of Cosmos technology, the power of having a validator set of the app chain concept, to provide a lot of safety for users, because that's the other thing. The biggest thing that we saw is large scale adoption of DEFi really came through CDFI, which were entities that were intermediating DeFi protocols for users and allowed them to not be exposed to the complexity of operating on chain. But all of those things like Celsius, Voyager, all of them rugged, their users, right, they all stole their money. There was fraud. So what we wanted to do with sommelier is build a system where that fraud was impossible, where there are multiple systems of checks and balances protecting users from all of the different things that could go wrong. So you have protection that's built into the smart contract layer, where the smart contracts are defining what DeFi protocols can be used. You're not going to wake up someone one morning, and real yield ETH will put all of the ETH in some DeFi protocol that no one's ever heard of before.
00:08:09.420 - 00:08:40.370, Speaker B: And so the chain enables a governance process if you want to add a new. But also one of the other big things is that whenever there's a trading action that happens. What's actually happening is the trade is being submitted to the validator set, and then the validator set is performing dynamic checks on those pateros trades before they get executed. So the validator set actually acts as, like, a very important guardian of the funds that are on Ethereum.
00:08:41.430 - 00:08:44.850, Speaker A: Thank you. What's the sommelier's long term goal?
00:08:45.510 - 00:09:47.480, Speaker B: What's sommelier's long term goal? Somalia fundamentally believes that DeFi is a thing that should be accessible to everyone and that people should be able to. DeFi will enable users to earn on their savings, get access to new financial opportunities that it is one of the most important things of blockchain and the goal of sommelier is to keep DeFi accessible to everyone, easy to use, accessible to everyone, so that DeFi doesn't repeat the conventional financial system where there's only a few sophisticated actors that are providing liquidity on Dexes and stuff like that. Really, we want to keep DFI accessible, democratic, open to everyone. And that's really the vision that Somalia is striving for.
00:09:48.350 - 00:09:59.142, Speaker A: Thank you. Is there anything you want to say to korean web3 community who's especially interested in somalier and interchange ecosystem?
00:09:59.206 - 00:10:36.840, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think that this is a great time to sort of rediscover the interchain ecosystem. There's a lot of new apps launching. This is a time to come in and explore again. Unfortunately, the ecosystem has been harmed a lot by things like the collapse of terra. But there's a new generation of safer, better, more exciting apps. New stablecoins, new dexes, new lending protocols, NFTs games, all of this stuff. It's really all starting to work.
00:10:37.370 - 00:10:39.250, Speaker A: Thank you so much for the interview.
