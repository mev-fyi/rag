00:00:14.090 - 00:00:14.922, Speaker A: Hi, Brian.
00:00:15.066 - 00:00:15.710, Speaker B: Hello.
00:00:15.860 - 00:00:18.830, Speaker A: Could you briefly introduce yourself to our viewers?
00:00:24.000 - 00:00:25.516, Speaker B: Shall they be over there?
00:00:25.698 - 00:00:26.710, Speaker A: Sure. Here?
00:00:28.440 - 00:01:07.824, Speaker B: Yeah. So my name is Baron Crane. I've been working in the crypto space for a long time, pretty much ten years at this point. And at the moment, I'm doing, like, four different things. So one is there's a company course, one that I started, and we are one of the main staking companies. So we run staking infrastructure on, I think, close to 50 different networks and have something over 1 billion of assets stick with us. I was part of the original Cosmos team.
00:01:07.824 - 00:01:51.870, Speaker B: I was COO of Tenement back in 2017. So still very involved in the Cosmos ecosystem, both through chorus one, where we run a lot of different blockchains. And I'm also the president of the Interchain foundation. So the Interchange foundation is basically foundation, that original Cosmos foundation that funds most of the Cosmos core development. And then I started a podcast called Epicenter a long time ago. It's the longest running crypto podcast now. So we just did our episode 500, like, a month ago or two months ago or something.
00:01:51.870 - 00:02:17.380, Speaker B: And then I guess, finally, I'm very interested in this project called Urbit, and I'm also part of the Urbit foundation, and we have a team at Corusone that's developing Red Horizon. So we launched a new kind of new product called Red Horizon, which does infrastructure for urbit and hosts urbit servers.
00:02:18.200 - 00:02:32.524, Speaker A: Oh, wow. You do a lot. Okay. Thank you so much. Our second question is, like an icebreaking question. So what was the first coin that you bought? When was it, and why did you buy it? Do you remember?
00:02:32.722 - 00:03:12.804, Speaker B: Yeah, I do remember. Yeah. The first coin I bought was bitcoin, and it was in maybe, like, May 2013 or something like that. So just a little bit over ten years ago. So this was in Berlin, and then at the time, there wasn't a lot of exchanges, but there was this guy who organized this meetup, and he wanted to have people who would physically trade. So it was like, oh, people come there, and then people could. Like, his idea was, oh, people would say, like, oh, I'm buying or selling for this amount, and you can go around sort of like some kind of medieval marketplace.
00:03:12.804 - 00:03:39.040, Speaker B: That was the idea. So that's where I bought my first bitcoins. I actually bought it from this guy who was the local bitcoins founder. I don't know, maybe some people remember that. But local bitcoins was this website where you could find people physically that were close to you who wanted to buy and sell bitcoin. So that's how I bought my first bitcoin.
00:03:39.540 - 00:03:48.416, Speaker A: Interesting. Thank you so much. Okay, could you introduce chorus one about chorus one? What is it about?
00:03:48.518 - 00:04:30.668, Speaker B: Yeah, so basically, chorus one came out of. So I was working at tenement in 2017, and back then we were working on proof of stake. We're launching cosmos. You'd have this white paper and the software, and then you were like, oh, there will be the network, and then there needs to be these validators who actually run the software, who vote in governance, who have this role, right, to kind of maintain it. And at the time, nobody was working on this, didn't exist, this industry. So we're kind of wondering who's going to do that. And at the same time, tendermint as an organization was a bit of a chaos, so it was hard to work there effectively.
00:04:30.668 - 00:05:05.790, Speaker B: So then I decided with my co founder, Meher, who I was also hosting the podcast with, we decided to start course one. And at the beginning, we just focused on Cosmos and later now do all kinds of networks. And, yeah, basically we focus on running, staking infrastructure. That's really the focus for course one. And there's a lot of different parts to that. So we have a lot of retail clients, but we also work with custodians and different institutions. Yeah.
00:05:07.120 - 00:05:25.570, Speaker A: Thank you. Crosswind is one of the cosmos OGs, and it's having a significant impact on the interchange ecosystem. So how is the ecosystem different than now? Do you feel that the ecosystem has grown over the years?
00:05:27.960 - 00:06:28.100, Speaker B: Yeah, of course, the cosmos ecosystem has grown a lot. I think one thing that's maybe a bit unique about the Cosmos ecosystem, too, is because of the design of the chain, where you have different chains that are sovereign and responsible for their own security, own validator set. So I think actually today, what is the cosmos ecosystem? In a way, you could say there's a lot of different communities that are kind of connected but also separate. So I think that's an interesting thing. But, yeah, I think obviously it's arriving right. I think right now we have something like 50 different chains that are live with some meaningful, maybe coin that's trading and traction. And then we're still seeing a lot of new chains that are coming to Cosmos, both new startup chains or even some really big projects switching to Cosmos, like DyDX, for example, that we're also working with very closely.
00:06:29.480 - 00:06:34.180, Speaker A: Thank you so much. We actually did an interview with Paul from DYDX yesterday.
00:06:34.340 - 00:06:35.050, Speaker B: Cool.
00:06:36.380 - 00:06:43.290, Speaker A: How has Kirsten's role been changing over time? I mean, what's the current focus of the team, could you?
00:06:49.360 - 00:07:26.890, Speaker B: I mean, from the sort of proof of stake network perspective, I think our role hasn't changed like that much. Right. Because you're on the software, you vote on governance, you do upgrades, all that kind of stuff. I think what has changed is that we focus a lot more on institutions at this point. So to work with venture funds but also work with custodians, you know, that's a big focus. There's other kinds of institutions that are holding a lot of crypto for different people, and we've made a lot of progress on that front. So that's definitely something that wasn't really a focus in the beginning and has become more of a focus.
00:07:26.890 - 00:08:09.560, Speaker B: And then there are some other areas. Like, for example, we're doing a lot of work around Mev and doing a lot of research there. For example, we're also working with DydX on Mev and how Mev should look like for the DyDX chain. And then maybe another thing that now is, like, over the last years has become kind of a focus for us is that we do venture investing as well. So we have kind of course, one ventures, and we've invested in probably around 40 different projects, quite a lot of them also in the cosmos ecosystem, probably. I would say about half of their investments have been cosmos related.
00:08:10.860 - 00:08:18.650, Speaker A: Thank you. You're one of the leaders who run ICF. So what could be your role in ICF future?
00:08:20.960 - 00:09:07.412, Speaker B: Yeah, so the ICF was established in 2017, and basically, when the Cosmos fundraiser happened, all of that money went into the ICF, and also 10% of the atoms went into the ICF. And then the ICF's ICF is a swiss foundation, and that means that it basically has a, sort of. Doesn't have owners. Right. But it has a description of what its mission is and how it has to spend the money. And that mission is basically to further decentralize technologies, but especially in the cosmos ecosystem. So the ICF funds basically, primarily, it funds the Cosmos SDK development.
00:09:07.412 - 00:09:35.708, Speaker B: It funds tendermint, or now call it BFT, the consensus engine. It funds IBC, and it also funds Cosmos hub. It funds a lot of different organizations because there's a lot of different organizations that are kind of working on that. I would say that the kind of biggest ones are. Well, there's an internal team at the ICF that's working on IBC. So that's one. Then there's informal.
00:09:35.708 - 00:09:56.344, Speaker B: The company that was started and is run by Ethan Buckman, one of the Cosmos co founders. There is Strangelove. Which is run by Jack Samplen, who's working on IBC. And then there is a company called Binary Builders, which is run by Marco and Onur. They're focused on Cosmos SDK. And I think that was it. Yeah.
00:09:56.344 - 00:10:23.840, Speaker B: So I think those are the kind of the four main companies. And then there are other companies, too, like, for example, confio working on cosmosm, that are getting funding. So there's a lot of different organizations. I think at some point it was like 50 different organizations getting funding at the same time. It's been a bit less now. And so I'm part of the foundation council. Foundation council is basically sort of the supervisory board of the foundation.
00:10:23.840 - 00:10:59.884, Speaker B: So it's me, Ethan Buckman, and Fernando Pedone. He's a computer science professor in Switzerland. And yeah, I'm part of that foundation council. And we're in the end responsible for the thing that means being involved in these funding decisions, organizational things. We're at the moment expanding the foundation council, too, so we're evaluating people to add to it. So we want to increase the foundation council. If anybody's interested, feel free to apply.
00:10:59.884 - 00:11:52.510, Speaker B: I think you can find some information about it on the interchain foundation blog. We are also trying to hire another person, which we are looking for people. We're looking for an ecosystem lead at the moment, so somebody who is really deep in the cosmos ecosystem and understands it technically and can kind of help coordinate with these different teams on the roadmap, technical decisions. So that's another thing we're looking for. And, yeah, on the foundation council at the moment, I've switched with Ethan to become the president for the moment, which there's not that much significance, I think, to that. It's just the foundation council kind of collectively has that supervisory function.
00:11:54.020 - 00:12:08.150, Speaker A: So the crypto markets in asian region is really expanding, and there's this growing attention toward the interchange ecosystem as well. So how do you feel about asian markets, asian crypto market in general?
00:12:11.480 - 00:12:59.956, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, of course, Asia has long played a big role in the crypto market, especially having some of the biggest exchanges in Asia, like Binance and Wobi and a bunch of others, and a lot of trading in Asia and projects as well. Right. Actually, one of the few places I've really been to in Asia sort of to see was South Korea. Right. I was there at Biddle in 2019 and really loved it. We did a company retreat there as well, and I was originally going to go back in June and then unfortunately had some issue and couldn't go. But I'm definitely looking forward to going to Korea again, and then I don't know that much about it.
00:12:59.956 - 00:13:39.440, Speaker B: Right. We do have, for example, one BD person that's based in Asia focusing on that. We have maybe a few more team members there. I think one thing that I've heard a lot, isn't it also there's a lot of differences between the different asian markets where India, Korea, Japan, China all have their own idiosyncrasies and differences. But I think it's obviously promising Asia, especially because the US is still a hostile environment from a regulatory perspective. And I think in Asia, countries are more embracing of the change that crypto brings.
00:13:40.900 - 00:13:49.140, Speaker A: Thank you. Could you share ICF's long term goal and plans for supporting interchain ecosystem?
00:13:51.880 - 00:15:37.300, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, the ICF's long term goal, I would say, is that you can look at it in different ways. Right. Sort of on a very high level. The ICF is dedicated to creating a vibrant interchange ecosystem where you can have a lot of different blockchains that are sovereign, they're vibrant. I think one of the core ideas here is also this idea of, like, localism, you know, so that there can be many different chains for different communities in different maybe geographic regions or interest communities, and they kind of give them this power that they can be responsible for their own destiny, their own future. So I think that's kind of on a high level, the vision maybe more concretely, I would say that the goal is definitely to get these core technologies that everything is based on, like Comet, BFT, SDK and IBC, especially to get those to really a point of technical maturity that they are just kind of these reliable protocols and standards that everyone can rely on. And then maybe with the Cosmos hub, of course, also the goal is to support kind of the journey the cosmos hub is on to become really useful and power chain in this interchange world and provide a lot of value and provide sort of useful services to the interchain ecosystem.
00:15:38.200 - 00:15:44.144, Speaker A: Thank you so much. Yeah, we covered all the questions we got. Thank you so much for interview.
00:15:44.272 - 00:15:45.200, Speaker B: Thanks so much, Chloe.
