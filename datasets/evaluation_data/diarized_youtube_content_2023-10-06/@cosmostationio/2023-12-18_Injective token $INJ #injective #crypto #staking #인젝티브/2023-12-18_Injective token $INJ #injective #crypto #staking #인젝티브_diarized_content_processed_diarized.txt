00:00:00.170 - 00:00:14.510, Speaker UNK: So injective has native token. That's called injective token Inj. So what can we do with injective token? And can you give us a brief explanation about injective tokenomics?
00:00:15.410 - 00:00:59.260, Speaker A: Sure. So Inj is the token, and obviously, like other cosmos chains, is the staking token of injective. So one of the things that you can do is for staking to secure the chain. But there are also other use cases for injective. One is that by staking enough InJ, you can get a discount in the trading fees on injective. The second one is actually called is for injective burn auctions. So actually, each week, each week, the, the trading fee on injective will be, will be sent to a pool where users, or the community users can use inj to bid for this.
