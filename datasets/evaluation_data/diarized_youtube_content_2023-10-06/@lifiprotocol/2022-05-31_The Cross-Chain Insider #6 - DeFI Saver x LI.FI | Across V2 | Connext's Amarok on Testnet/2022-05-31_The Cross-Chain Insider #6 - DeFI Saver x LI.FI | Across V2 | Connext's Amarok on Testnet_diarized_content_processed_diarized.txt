00:00:12.400 - 00:00:33.619, Speaker A: All right. Hey, everyone. Welcome to this week's episode of the Cross Chain Insider, a weekly roundup of all news traveling across chains, brought to you by lefi. I'm Mark, member of the Biz Dev team and a Metaverse believer. My Gigabyte Brain co host is R. June, the jack of all trades and master of everything here at lefi. What is up, Arjun?
00:00:33.747 - 00:00:36.015, Speaker B: Good morning. I'm just having my coffee.
00:00:36.515 - 00:00:40.419, Speaker A: Just having your coffee. And I'm about to go to sleep. That's. That's working the Metaverse for you.
00:00:40.467 - 00:00:40.811, Speaker B: For you.
00:00:40.843 - 00:00:57.085, Speaker A: Right there. All right, as usual, everyone, Arjun writes this newsletter. It's beautiful. It's on substack. He writes it every week. You should definitely go subscribe. But because we're super cool, we also do it in podcast form, which is what you're listening to right now.
00:00:57.085 - 00:01:07.993, Speaker A: And so, Arjun, as always, we start with the bridging updates from the week. So, Arjun, can you give us the rundown, the recap, the roundup?
00:01:08.169 - 00:01:54.991, Speaker B: Yeah, as always, let's start with one that involves lifi. And this is a big one. Right? So Defi Saver, the widely used Defi management platform, has integrated the LIFI SDK. So DeFi Saver, which was originally only available on Ethereum Mainnet, now supports Optimism and Arbitrum. And the LIFI SDK will help them enable users to bridge their assets to these networks without ever leaving the Defi Saver interface. So not only do the users get access to this slick new bridging UI on Defi Saver, they also get access to all the bridges, Dexes and Dex aggregators that we have integrated at Defi. So they can simply choose to bridge their funds to Optimism or Arbitrum, and Defi will do the rest of the work for the users.
00:01:54.991 - 00:02:23.535, Speaker B: And yeah, awesome start to the week for our site sale, and it's great to see another established player using the Leaf isdk. And trust me, this is just getting started. We gave a little teaser last week of what's to come with the poll, so watch out for more amazing integrations coming soon. And I think I should stop talking about that now before I spill something that I'm not supposed to. So best to move on to KNext.
00:02:23.955 - 00:02:28.455, Speaker A: Nicholas Flamel fans will be very excited. Can I say that?
00:02:32.075 - 00:03:14.745, Speaker B: Let's move on to cnx. So Amarok is now on public testnet. So their new network upgrade, which is called the Amarok Upgrade, is now open for testing. For builders and the community. This upgrade is something that the entire bridging community is looking forward to and including all of us at lifi. It enables fast and cheap fun click bridging across chains and building applications called X apps without ever compromising on security because KNX is one of the most trust minimized bridges out there. So we are definitely looking forward to having the America upgrade on Defi as well and all the different applications that will build on it.
00:03:14.745 - 00:03:52.915, Speaker B: And next we have across. So across V2 is now live. In V1 they focused on bridging from optimistic rollups to Ethereum mainnet and in V2 L2 to L2 transfers have been added. So it's great to see that they have more connectivity to their bridge now because earlier they were always like one of the most capital efficient bridges and always had like cheap routes. But the only limitation that I found was the connectivity because they only did roll ups to Mainnet and now they have like L2 to L2. And this also makes your deep dive kind of redundant.
00:03:53.335 - 00:03:55.515, Speaker A: I know. Do I need to go update it?
00:03:55.855 - 00:04:26.753, Speaker B: I mean in some time I guess because like no, no, Viven doesn't exist now. Bad timing, bad day. But it's okay. It's a good deep dive regardless. So let's move on to Quixotic. So they kind of gave a teaser about an optimism NFT bridge. So Quixotic is in Optimism Native NFT marketplace and they dropped some alpha tweeting about a bridge to Optimism.
00:04:26.753 - 00:04:36.989, Speaker B: And there's no official announcement yet, but it looks like we'll get we get an optimism NFT bridge in the near future. So all eyes are on exotic what.
00:04:37.037 - 00:04:40.789, Speaker A: NFT would you bridge to Optimism right now if you could?
00:04:40.917 - 00:04:44.505, Speaker B: I wouldn't bridge anything. I like my assets native.
00:04:46.445 - 00:04:49.509, Speaker A: Wow, that was such a lame answer. Okay, moving on.
00:04:49.557 - 00:05:12.045, Speaker B: But it's the truth. Like see if that bridge is another like wrap in mint. I'd rather buy a new NFT on Optimism. So that's the truth about me. But yeah, I'm sure many Ethereum users or any other network users want their nft. So it's a great addition. And let's move on to the Ronin Bridge.
00:05:12.045 - 00:05:57.365, Speaker B: So the Ronin Bridge successfully passed two audits. I think it's been two or two months or so since the hack and so yeah, it's great to see that they, that they had all these audits. So they had one internal audit and one external audit led by Verichain's Lab. And the recent blog says that the team is also conducting a second external audit led by Certik. And if the audit is successful, the Run Bridge will be reopened in mid June and if I remember correct correctly, they've added more validators to their validator set for more security and eventually they plan to have more than 100 validators. So let's see how that goes. But it's great to see them bouncing back and getting ready for a relaunch.
00:05:58.565 - 00:06:05.901, Speaker A: I will certainly be reading that audit when it's out. That will probably be a topic of this podcast out, I would think.
00:06:06.013 - 00:06:48.071, Speaker B: Yeah, probably. And yeah. So to wrap up this section with some quick news, we have Multichain with an update. So V Multi is now live on Phantom. V Multi is the governance scheme for Multi Dao, which is MultiChain's official dao and it has now been deployed on Phantom network. So it was previously available on the Ethereum mainnet and so users can now basically stake their Multi tokens and mint v multi NFTs. And this gives them the permission to take part in multichain governance and basically earn a share of its bridge fees which is, which is quite substantial because multichain does take huge amounts of volume and they have millions in bridge fees.
00:06:48.071 - 00:07:26.325, Speaker B: So it's a great opportunity for users to get involved in honor share of the bridge fees. Next we have another integration news. So Injective and Ethereum compatible native IBC blockchain announced an integration with Wormhole. So this integration brings 10 new chains that Wormhole connects to Injective and this will enable cross chain native assets from previously inaccessible networks like Solana and like Avalanche to enter the cosmos universe. So more assets, like more synthetic assets, but definitely like more connectivity amongst these chains.
00:07:27.385 - 00:07:41.661, Speaker A: I think that we're going to be seeing more and more IBC enabled Ethereum compatible chains. I think that's going to be pretty massive going forward. I just saw that EVMOS is Now a top 100 asset I think today.
00:07:41.813 - 00:08:29.085, Speaker B: Yeah, which I mean to be fair it's not that hard to break into the top hundred these days. So the lunar relaunch is already top twenty or something like that. But yeah, I mean, yeah, definitely in the future we'll have more compatibility between IBC and evm. Like right now IBC has their stuff sorted in the sense that they can communicate with each other, but how do you connect them to evm? That's the next big thing. And with that we've come to the end of this section and that was a lot of news as always. There's so much going on in the cross chain ecosystem, so it's definitely, it definitely feels like a build market that's basically showing no signs of slowing down.
00:08:30.185 - 00:08:34.481, Speaker A: Did you just say it's a build market instead of a bear market or a bull market?
00:08:34.633 - 00:08:36.845, Speaker B: I took that from the bank list.
00:08:37.625 - 00:08:41.329, Speaker A: Wow. I thought it was really good. I hadn't heard it before. I thought you just made it up.
00:08:41.457 - 00:08:42.645, Speaker B: I wish I could.
00:08:43.705 - 00:09:22.185, Speaker A: Okay, so the next part of this podcast is Arjun Big Brain. He goes deep into the bridges. I'm over here I go into the cross gen ecosystem at large. First big update for the week is that Brave, every Degen's favorite browser, is now launching Solana support essentially. And I found this to be very, very interesting because this is the first slide on Twitter, but the second slide is where the juicy bit is. Okay. You're now also announcing upcoming releases that will expand access to the Solana ecosystems from the Brave team.
00:09:22.185 - 00:09:56.691, Speaker A: Coming soon, you can buy and sell NFTs with bat on Magic Eden and Solana Dapp support for Brave Wallet. Those two things are massive for the cross chain space in my opinion because I think if you're in crypto you're using Brave like that's what you're doing. And the fact that they're going full bent on Solana, very interesting. And I can't wait to see like I could definitely see some of my normie friends like just going to Magic Eden and buying something with their free Bat tokens that they get because I told them to download the Brave browser. So I'm excited about this.
00:09:56.763 - 00:10:02.175, Speaker B: You also told me to download it. So I like you are one of the earliest users of Brave that I know.
00:10:04.445 - 00:10:55.245, Speaker A: You heard that here first guys early og. Okay, next section here is that Infura is announced a partnership with NEAR Protocol and so FIRA is kind of like a more of an infrastructure team than anything. You're probably not going to hear much about Inferior except that like it pretty much helps develop Ethereum and so now they're announcing support for nearly. This would be great for near. Should bring more developers there and it was just a good step into building out more infrastructure for the cross chain space. Next we have a starkware Times starknet, sorry, times Immutable X partnership here. So Immutable X, or actually Immutable is one of the biggest NFT platforms.
00:10:55.245 - 00:11:34.585, Speaker A: They do Gods Unchained and all that stuff. They're now going on Starknet, which is an L2 on Ethereum. Interestingly, they also Immutable launched a blog post today which not at recommended reads yet, but it's a recommended read and they're actually going to have a couple Issues with fee structures and stuff on starknet. So cool that they're having a partnership. But I thought it was interesting that this blog post I read today noted a few issues with the integration. Next we have as Arjun. Yeah, right.
00:11:34.585 - 00:11:51.505, Speaker A: Next we have Arjun, as Arjun mentioned before. Wow. I don't make my mind kind of spaced out there. Terra. The Terra blockchain launched again. I'm not going to go too deep into this. We've all been keeping track of the Terra saga.
00:11:51.505 - 00:11:56.205, Speaker A: The new chains out, the tokens are going crazy. It's hard to keep track.
00:11:56.325 - 00:11:56.845, Speaker B: Keeping track.
00:11:56.885 - 00:12:02.411, Speaker A: Do you have any. Yeah. Do you have any thoughts on this, Arjun? Or should we just move on today?
00:12:02.563 - 00:12:11.215, Speaker B: I don't know. So this was kind of my spicy take for this week, so I'll probably shed some more light on my thoughts there.
00:12:11.915 - 00:12:36.691, Speaker A: Oh, okay. So stay tuned. Probably in the last like three minutes, Arjun's gonna launch into a diatribe on Terra. Can't wait. Okay, we have. We have two more bullet points left in this section. We have Xerion launching a Web3 mobile wallet, which is awesome when you really think about how often you use the Internet, it's most likely going to be on your phone.
00:12:36.691 - 00:13:02.881, Speaker A: You're going to be texting, sending messages, reading on your phone, whatever. I think we need blockchain on mobile devices. We don't really have that right now. They're launching with support on 10 networks. You have Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, BNB, Finance Chain, Arbitrum, Optimism, Avalanche, Gnosis, Aurora and Lubring. So I think that's. That's gonna be pretty cool.
00:13:02.881 - 00:13:23.819, Speaker A: I'm gonna go try that out. I don't think Xerion has launched a token yet either. So it's always good to kind of test out stuff that hasn't launched a token. There's your alpha for the day. And last but not least, Trust Wallet launched on Phantom. Or launch support for Phantom, which is big. Trust Wallet already supports.
00:13:23.819 - 00:13:32.979, Speaker A: I looked at their website today. It said like a million plus tokens. I don't know how they got to a million tokens. I mean, are there a million tokens in crypto right now? Like, that's wild if that's true. No, no.
00:13:32.987 - 00:13:37.935, Speaker B: I've never checked beyond 500 on like a coin market cap.
00:13:39.275 - 00:13:45.255, Speaker A: Yeah, but I saw it. Maybe I misread it, but I'm pretty sure I saw a million plus. So good for Trust Wallet and, you.
00:13:45.255 - 00:13:50.555, Speaker B: Know, 5,000, 6,000 tokens. Or let's say thousands, millions.
00:13:52.015 - 00:13:55.263, Speaker A: Like, I don't know. I'm Just, I'm just relaying what I heard.
00:13:55.319 - 00:13:56.831, Speaker B: Minting their own token.
00:13:57.023 - 00:14:09.075, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay. So we talked about bridging, we talked about the cross chain space. And now our June. This is when you get to talk about what is poppin.
00:14:09.575 - 00:14:50.215, Speaker B: Yeah. And I really enjoyed like this week's thread because it was about hop and like it was something new in the ecosystem. Right. So, and it's airdrop season, and with airdrop news all around, there's always a buzz on Twitter. And the recent airdrops have been special, not only because they involve bridges and L tools, but because these airdrops have adopted like new and unique models for distributing tokens to the community. So one such airdrop is the hop drop, which is the hop protocols airdrop. And they've introduced a strategy to remove civil attackers from farming the token, basically.
00:14:50.215 - 00:15:12.175, Speaker B: So civil attackers are those who create like in on identities or addresses and use them to gain basically unfair influence over a product. So they'll come in and out of the of a product and just try to farm in airdrop rather than using it for actually bridging funds and then exploring other ecosystems like a real user.
00:15:12.675 - 00:16:00.047, Speaker A: Yeah. To just jump into there. Like an example of this would be someone buying 10,000 ETH on Binance, distributing that to 100,000 wallets and then bridging once like, you know, like 50 bucks through the Hop Bridge order to get their 100,000 wallets to get to airdrop. And we don't want that to happen in the crypto space because all these tokens we're dropping are governance tokens. So if one person ends up getting 100,000 drops, then they'll have an outsized reward via governance and then they can maybe control hop maliciously in the future, or they'll just sell tokens and the price will drop and then that's just no fun. So we don't like Sybils are kind of not liked in the space.
00:16:00.191 - 00:16:07.951, Speaker B: Yeah. And the hop team kind of felt the same. Like distributing tokens to such attackers would basically be unjust to genuine users.
00:16:07.983 - 00:16:08.151, Speaker A: Right.
00:16:08.183 - 00:17:00.217, Speaker B: With actually using the protocol. And so to remove these civil attackers, they spent like two months crunching data and they managed to identify 10,000 addresses out of the 45,000 eligible. And you know, so there's a great thread by Chris Winfrey, the founder of about their methodology to identify civil attackers, which is probably not the best way to go about it because you're kind of putting out knowledge for the attackers as well. Like this is how we removed you from the list. But I'm sure like there'll be different mechanisms adopted by different, you know, airdrops in the future. So this alone was interesting, but the hop team didn't stop there. So they got the community involved in the announced rewards for like community members who can identify civil attackers who had not been uncovered yet.
00:17:00.217 - 00:18:00.975, Speaker B: And successful reports were rewarded like 25% of the saved hop token while the rest was distributed among eligible community members. So if you had been allocated hop tokens, you basically got more tokens each time a SIBIL attacker is identified. And so to, so to sum up like all the good points about the HOB drop, so it weeds out all the civil attackers, it redistributes the tokens amongst like genuine users and it gets the whole Web3 community involved with a work to one kind of an opportunity because they can find the remaining attackers and get a portion of the saved funds. So this is something special and a token launch mechanism that will surely be adopted by other projects in the future. And we're already seeing this being adopted with optimism. Who they announced that they removed additional 17,000 addresses and recovered over 14 million op tokens. And all of this goes back to the community members.
00:18:00.975 - 00:18:19.985, Speaker B: So it's great to see that not only are we removing all these attacking wallets, but with rewarding the community even more, giving them more opportunities to like earn as well. Because you'll get rewards in OP tokens and opt token. So kudos to both the teams.
00:18:20.765 - 00:18:55.591, Speaker A: Yeah, I will say like as a bridge user and someone who wants to interact with bridge governance in the future, I like this. However, I'm a little bit of a code is law type type of guy and not really this is even really code's law because the airdrop rules weren't stated beforehand. But I do think it's tough to punish people who were using the HOT protocol by not giving them a reward for doing so because that does bootstrap bootstrap volume.
00:18:55.663 - 00:19:27.165, Speaker B: You kind of. So it's very difficult to say who is a user and who is not. So you kind of going into behavior analysis of addresses and when you're doing that you, you'll likely there'll be a smaller portion of users will be will miss out on it. Like me, I have five wallets and I bridged certain amount of volume that would qualify me, like definitely qualify me. But because I'm trying to like not use all of my funds in one wallet, I couldn't make sense of it. All right. So.
00:19:29.115 - 00:19:30.971, Speaker A: It'S just an interesting concept because.
00:19:31.003 - 00:19:42.227, Speaker B: Yeah, but, but I'M not sad about it because you have to do certain things to benefit the wider community. And of course there'll be like a few members who will be left out. But it's okay.
00:19:42.371 - 00:20:08.917, Speaker A: That's part of the game. I just like to me this might be the end of users seeing a platform that hasn't launched a token yet and just aping into it because they know that there's probably going to be a token in the future. And I don't know if that's a great thing for platforms in the future because kind of like the win token has been a great reason to go. Like I mentioned it with Xerion, like the reason why I might download the app to test it out.
00:20:09.061 - 00:20:28.235, Speaker B: I mean, so it'll be a greater reason to test out that properly. Right. So let's say someone used hop before. Now if someone had to farm the hop drop, they would go LP funds for longer. They would like put more, more energy into it. So I think it's better.
00:20:28.735 - 00:20:51.335, Speaker A: Okay, we're, we're, we're, we got off track there, but it was conversation. Okay, so next part of the podcast is when Arjun, Senor Big Brain, he gives his reading recommend. Wow, I can't even speak. And that's why you're the big brain, I'm the small brain. He gives his reading recommendations for the week. Arjun, what you that.
00:20:52.235 - 00:21:44.945, Speaker B: So the first one was a thread basically that I just organized all our resources into a thread. So I was just thinking about all the work that we had done over the past six to eight months and I went through a medium blog page basically and there were like 50 resources. I was like, maybe there's a way to organize this into bridge articles and ecosystem overviews. So this thread has bridge ecosystem over articles like Trust as a Spectrum in Bridges or Classifying Bridges. Then there's like deep dives on individual bridges based on the framework that we worked on. And there are also interviews with our integration partners, ecosystem overviews that we that talk about different applications users can go through by bridging all these bridging to all these chains. And I would definitely recommend checking out the resources in this thread.
00:21:44.945 - 00:21:55.055, Speaker B: Right. Because they the kind of 0 to 100 of bridges. Of course I'm kind of biased, but I think this is good work.
00:21:56.595 - 00:22:00.215, Speaker A: I'm also biased, but I think it is good work.
00:22:02.395 - 00:22:41.423, Speaker B: Thanks for adding on to that. So next is an article about bridge security. And this is an interesting one because we always talk about bridge security. But this analysis goes deeper into whether the message about certain Bridges being safer than the others is actually passing on to the users or not. So covalent Unified API has both the Avalanche Bridge and Nomad. So Avalanche is the native bridge of Avalanche which is kind of centralized and has more trust assumptions. And Nomad is an optimistic bridge with minimal trust trade offs in the early days.
00:22:41.423 - 00:23:02.695, Speaker B: So they covalent found based on their data that since the launch of Nomad, Nomad Stereo per user averaged higher than higher numbers than Avalanche Bridge and Nomad's user users are also growing rapidly. In the first week of May alone they saw 5,000 new addresses.
00:23:02.735 - 00:23:03.151, Speaker A: Right.
00:23:03.263 - 00:23:22.755, Speaker B: So it's great to see that all the education and all the efforts of the Nomad team into basically talking about bridge security bridge models, why their Bridges safer is resonating with the users who are considering security as an important factor in their choice of bridges now.
00:23:27.455 - 00:23:29.959, Speaker A: Yeah, pretty cool. Did you have one more?
00:23:30.127 - 00:24:13.707, Speaker B: Oh yeah. So the next one is from the continued series of Twitter threads by the gomol team educating the public about the about their product, which is always good. So this week they talk about X data which makes it easy for protocols to synchronize data between chain. So the X data is what allows wormhole to enable the cross chain use cases as it allows builders to move data cross chain by while keeping the data organized and accurate. So this is the data messaging layer of wormhole that's often less talked about, but this is what enables all the cool stuff. So it's an interesting thread and a great insight into how wormhole works. So that's it for me.
00:24:13.707 - 00:24:15.815, Speaker B: And what do you have for us? This.
00:24:16.395 - 00:24:35.195, Speaker A: Okay, I have, I think I have two recommended reads. They're both about synapse. The first was written by CMS holdings which is one of probably the best Twitter follows on crypto Twitter. So if you ever need a good shitposter. We allowed to cuss on this?
00:24:35.535 - 00:24:38.595, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean no, but I guess this is okay.
00:24:38.975 - 00:25:31.545, Speaker A: Sorry Philip, but CMS holdings, if you're new to crypto Twitter, definitely follow them. But if you're listening to Cross Chain podcast, you're probably not new to crypto Twitter. So I'll move on a substack about SYNAPSE and kind of went into just how their token works, how their different two bridging models work, and just kind of an overview of synapse. However, I won't bore you with all those details because those details are actually in the next recommended read too. But what I was wanting to point out from the article is I thought they did a great job explaining why cross chain bridges and why multiple solutions to cross chain bridging are necessary. So it's this little paragraph right here. In actuality, there are massive frictions when communicating between chains due to differences in infrastructure and messaging standards.
00:25:31.545 - 00:26:09.199, Speaker A: This means that different chains speak different languages and it's hard for those two chains to talk to each other. This leads to many issues with the current practices. Okay, so here are like the biggest issues with the cross chain space. They lay it out perfectly, right? First of all, bridges take too long, right? If you're wanting to move an asset from chain A to chain B, like we've been like, on the Internet, everything's instantaneous, Right. But in the bridging space it's still like, it takes minutes and minutes is forever for us Internet age kids. Number two, there's just not enough assets that can go cross chain. That's.
00:26:09.199 - 00:26:51.891, Speaker A: I mean, you're limited to what you can do on certain bridges. Number three, when you go from chain to chain, you usually don't have gas on the chain you're bridging to, which is really cumbersome. And then last of all, you have unusable wrapped assets, which this is kind of getting the nitty gritty of bridging. But essentially a lot of these bridges kind of just do an IOU on the next chain and then they can make another IOU of that IOU by bridging that to a new chain. And then you have a wrapped IOU and then there's no liquidity for that wrapped IOU and it's terrible. And so shout out to CMS holdings for making that really clear.
00:26:52.043 - 00:27:20.565, Speaker B: That's the main point, main issue about bridges. The first three are kind of surface level, right. Even an outsider can probably tell you that in one week. But the fourth point is something that you will actually only realize the problem when you use these wrapped versions of tokens. And then we just stuck on a new chain with no liquidity. So that's, I think, the main problem. And it's great that it's been pointed out, laid out in like clear words.
00:27:21.425 - 00:27:50.067, Speaker A: Yep. And then just Synapse then did another tweet thread that I won't go into too much detail on, but they kind of went over the two different ways that they bridge assets. And so the first way, which is in my opinion the preferred way as a bridger myself, is through a liquidity network. And then the second way is canonical token bridging, which is more of a lock and mint. And there's a lot of wrapping when you get to canonical token minting.
00:27:50.131 - 00:28:03.065, Speaker B: But that's, but that's very important as well. Like we, you're kind of putting a negative twist on it. But the negative twist is only the wrapped version of a wrapped version and the whole effect.
00:28:03.685 - 00:28:18.877, Speaker A: Very true. I did not mean to put a negative spin on it. It just, it's, it's harder to scale wrapped assets. Like it's in my opinion because you're going to have to keep wrapping them unless you kind of come up with a wormhole solution.
00:28:18.981 - 00:28:22.585, Speaker B: If an asset doesn't exist on a chain, you have to wrap it.
00:28:22.965 - 00:28:31.187, Speaker A: I know, I know, I know. Still, I still don't love it because then you have to build liquidity. Okay, whatever.
00:28:31.211 - 00:28:38.135, Speaker B: I'm good. I'm fine with like wrapping tokens. I'm not fine with wrapping NFTs. That's where I draw the line.
00:28:39.515 - 00:28:53.077, Speaker A: Also, like we've said wrapping so many times, I'm now just thinking about wrappers. Anyways, that was way off topic. Okay, last part of the pod. We have about five minutes left here. Arjun, what's on your cross chain mind this week?
00:28:53.221 - 00:29:43.835, Speaker B: Yeah, so as I said, I was thinking about the launch of Terra 2.0 this week and the new Luna token already has a market cap of around 9 billion. So I'm kind of trying to analyze if the Terra ecosystem without a stable coin like USD, like we can always question if it was even worth that much before the crash. After the crash, with the tainted image, trust issues like other developers still building with all these uncertainties and all the questions is it worth that much? And I think this is something that you can probably, you'll probably do better just by sitting outside and watching rather than, you know, getting your hands burnt trying to make a quick buck. Yeah, I'm kind of on the sidelines. What about.
00:29:45.535 - 00:29:55.471, Speaker A: I think there's a lot of development on Terra and I think there's a lot of developers and I think it has a chance to stick around a little bit.
00:29:55.503 - 00:30:27.195, Speaker B: Yeah. So the ecosystem, I think I use most of the applications and I really enjoyed using them. Right. But to recover from something like this, you have to not only recover financially, which is an important aspect, but then there's also that whole one period of one week where team started to deploy another chains like started considering different things. So it's very difficult but it's something that's been done in the past as well and if it can happen again, it'll be a great story.
00:30:28.615 - 00:30:31.087, Speaker A: I mean I'm rooting for them like all those developers.
00:30:31.231 - 00:30:39.997, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah, I'm rooting for them. But like, I'm. So this consideration is from, I would say, an investment perspective.
00:30:40.061 - 00:30:40.821, Speaker A: Yep.
00:30:41.013 - 00:30:47.545, Speaker B: Yeah. So I'm there for them, but should I be putting my money right now or not? That's my. That's my question.
00:30:48.085 - 00:31:15.405, Speaker A: Okay. And then my last. My last thought for the podcast is it's actually kind of an extra recommended read for you. But Vitalik published a research paper last week. It's about soulbound tokens, which, you know me, I'm a huge NFT guy. A soulbound token is essentially an NFT that cannot be traded from the wallet it is given to. However, it can be revoked.
00:31:15.405 - 00:31:54.145, Speaker A: Now, why is this interesting? Why do I mean this? Why. Why would anyone want a token that cannot be removed from their wallet? Well, because then you have immutable identity on blockchain. Right. And so at some point we're going to be hopefully having institutions like maybe a college issue something like a diploma as an nft. And instead of if you issue an nft, if you issue a diploma as an nft, what is someone going to do? Because this is crypto, right. They're just going to immediately sell that diploma and someone can buy the diploma and act like they graduated college.
00:31:54.655 - 00:31:56.915, Speaker B: They won't have the diploma in the first place.
00:31:59.135 - 00:32:30.785, Speaker A: It's just kind of a ridiculous concept. But a soulbound token means that an institution like a college can issue a diploma on the blockchain and it's stuck in that user's wallet address, and then it's there forever. And you don't have to attach your identity to that vault address. Correct. You could just tell your college to say, hey, issue to this address. Maybe the college knows who you are now, but no one else does. I think this just unlocks a ton of really cool.
00:32:30.865 - 00:32:34.325, Speaker B: Even optimism did this. Right? If I'm not wrong.
00:32:34.745 - 00:32:45.745, Speaker A: Yes. So optimism is using this for governance. I think this is going to unlock a lot of decentralized governance options. This podcast is too short to really dive into it, but essentially.
00:32:45.865 - 00:32:48.593, Speaker B: And our brains are also too small to dive into this right now.
00:32:48.649 - 00:33:10.155, Speaker A: Exactly. But Vitalik thinks that soulbound tokens are the key to creating a decentralized society. And this is a 37 page paper outlining that decentralized society which are fueled by soulbound tokens. So I'm certainly. I'm trying to chew through that right now. Figure out.
00:33:10.235 - 00:33:12.171, Speaker B: Have you read it already? I haven't read it.
00:33:12.243 - 00:33:13.695, Speaker A: I have read it. I have read it.
00:33:13.995 - 00:33:14.455, Speaker B: 37.
00:33:14.557 - 00:33:26.247, Speaker A: It kind of hurt after about page 28. I was like, gotta grind through. But it's so interesting. You got it. I would recommend anyone read it, especially because Vitalik wrote it.
00:33:26.271 - 00:33:33.415, Speaker B: And like, if you want your brain to be smaller, just look at Vitalik's tweets and papers.
00:33:33.495 - 00:33:39.275, Speaker A: That's it? Seriously? Seriously. Okay. Do you have anything else to add?
00:33:39.655 - 00:33:41.779, Speaker B: I think I'm done for the weekend.
00:33:41.977 - 00:34:09.295, Speaker A: Okay. Well, that is the latest episode of the Cross Chain Insider.
