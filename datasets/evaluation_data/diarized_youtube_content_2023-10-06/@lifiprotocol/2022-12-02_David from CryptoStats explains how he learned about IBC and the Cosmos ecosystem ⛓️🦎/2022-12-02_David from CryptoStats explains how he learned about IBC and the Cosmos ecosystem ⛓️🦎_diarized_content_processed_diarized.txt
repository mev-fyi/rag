00:00:09.160 - 00:00:51.895, Speaker A: I actually learned a lot about kind of IBC and Cosmos by trying to get this data because we had to understand. I had to kind of dig into some of these bridge messages to understand, like escrow addresses. Actually, one of the ways that I was finding data for IBC was just bridging assets myself. Like, I had to buy a. Buy a dollar worth of some coin on osmosis and then bridge it to another chain. And I could kind of look at the transaction and understand where that asset was, what address it was flowing to, and that helped build those adapters around it. So it's interesting to see all these different architectures, different type of tools, both of the chains as well as the bridges itself.
