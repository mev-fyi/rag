00:00:13.880 - 00:00:14.660, Speaker A: Recording.
00:00:16.265 - 00:00:37.889, Speaker B: Hey, everyone. Welcome to this week's episode of the Cross Chain Insider, a weekly roundup of all news traveling across chains, brought to you by lefi. I'm Mark, member of the Biz Dev team and a member of the Starbucks Times Polygon Rewards waitlist. My gigabrain co host is Arjun, Jack of all trades and master of everything here at Lei. What is up, Arjun?
00:00:38.057 - 00:00:47.045, Speaker A: You front ran me to that Starbucks Ex. Leify. Sorry. Starbucks Polygon program. It looks interesting, though.
00:00:48.065 - 00:01:00.883, Speaker B: Yeah, I did. I was laughing. Their name is Starbucks. And it's like, why aren't they calling every reward point in there something bucks? Like, it makes so much sense. But anyways, whatever.
00:01:00.939 - 00:01:02.803, Speaker A: I guess it's too obvious. That's why they're not.
00:01:02.859 - 00:01:18.443, Speaker B: It's too obvious and they probably don't want it. They probably don't want people to think it's money. So, anyways, we digress. We're already going down rabbit hole. So this is a Cross Chain Insider. We've been off for about two weeks, three weeks, because it's been summer break, but we're back.
00:01:18.499 - 00:01:24.905, Speaker A: No, but it's for. It's for a good reason. Like, it's not summer break. It's for a good reason. And that. That will be shown soon.
00:01:25.445 - 00:01:53.895, Speaker B: Right. We've been writing like crazy, and so we just haven't had time to record a podcast, but now we're recording. So as usual, Arjun writes the Cross Chain Insider, a weekly news recap of everything happening across chains. He publishes it as a newsletter on Substack, and we then go podcast about it later in the day because some people don't like reading and I don't like those some people. But that's okay. We still pot for them. Okay.
00:01:53.895 - 00:01:57.831, Speaker B: So, Arjun, Bridge updates. What you got for us this week?
00:01:57.943 - 00:02:29.983, Speaker A: Yeah, so first up, there were a lot of network upgrades, even in the chains and even for, like, arbitrary messaging bridges. So first up is Axelar. They completed their Mave upgrade. So it's their mainnet upgrade, code named Mave. So they've introduced a lot of new features, but the one that stands out the most is the implementation of quadratic voting. So this really bolsters the security and decentralization of Axelar's validator set. So a lot of they've, like, faced.
00:02:29.983 - 00:02:50.515, Speaker A: So sorry. Externally verified bridges. They have validators, and they face a lot of criticism for, like, not having decentralized validator sets. So coordinating voting is like, one step in that direction to, you know, kind of suppress all of those concerns and move. Move towards. In A decentralized direction. So it's, it's like a.
00:02:50.515 - 00:02:55.655, Speaker A: I think it's a great step and it's one of its kind. No one else has done it till now.
00:02:56.755 - 00:03:19.467, Speaker B: Yeah. And as usual, Arjun has the big brain take on this Quadratic voting actually. Very interesting. Um, if you're in, if you're like, want to go deeper into this topic. Vitalik has a fantastic blog post on quadratic voting which maybe we'll throw in the links to this episode. But I just wanted to add like Maeve right now. The name's kind of ruined me.
00:03:19.467 - 00:03:34.135, Speaker B: Ruined for me because I've been watching, I've been watching the Boys on Amazon prime and like Maeve is just like, it's just not as cool of a character like Westworld. Fantastic. The boys, man.
00:03:35.035 - 00:04:06.965, Speaker A: Anyways, that's my take, totally on topic. But let's move on to layer zero. So they introduced the Summer of 2022 update. So this was like so many new features that you can't even, you know, see if in the, in this, in a single Twitter thread that what all they've introduced. So I've basically mentioned four bullet points. So the entire bridging section could have been just Layer zero. But first is their Pre Crime feature which they introduced in a blog post in like May.
00:04:06.965 - 00:04:32.269, Speaker A: This is now live, so anyone can now. So any developer can now use this feature. This feature has been used by Stargate since launch. So this feature can basically allow developers to define custom security guarantees. And this is done by setting their own invariants for all messaging. So Stargate already uses this, but now it's available for everyone to use. The second one is Layer zero Scan.
00:04:32.269 - 00:05:08.245, Speaker A: So this is an Omnichain blockchain explorer for all Layer zero messages. So like how does one transaction goes from one chain to another chain through Layer zero's infrastructure? This basically shows that something similar to this was Axelar Scan. So that has been live for a long time. So people who are aware of that can basically relate. The third one is Ultralight Node Library. So this library is basically all the support, like the tech support that is required for all these new features and all the upcoming new chains that Layer zero will support. This library has it all.
00:05:08.245 - 00:05:39.115, Speaker A: And the fourth one is New chain. So Layer zero has added support for Moonbeam Harmony, which is not live right now, Swimmer and dfk. And they've also added support for eight other pre launch chains, testnets. So these chains like whenever their mainnet goes live, layerzero will add support for their main. Net and these Chains are mainly all the non EVMs such as Aptos, Sui and Solana. So a lot of updates from layer zero in just like one Twitter thread.
00:05:40.015 - 00:05:50.715, Speaker B: I can't wait to see if pre crime catches on. And if it does catch on, if it catches anything. That's like. I think pre crime is the highlight of this blog post.
00:05:51.015 - 00:05:55.013, Speaker A: That's the feature that has been like live since May.
00:05:55.069 - 00:05:59.501, Speaker B: So it's like it's been live but it's been constrained.
00:05:59.653 - 00:06:14.945, Speaker A: Yeah, it's been public knowledge. It's not been live, but it's been public knowledge. I think Layer zero has like a habit of kind of doing so much in the background and then just in one Twitter thread they'll just tell you, oh, we've done so much more than you.
00:06:15.365 - 00:06:18.333, Speaker B: Hey, speaking of something built on top of layer zero.
00:06:18.469 - 00:06:39.188, Speaker A: Yeah. So next up is Stargate and LIFI has added support for Stargate. So this is now the 11th bridge that we support, but the 10th bridge that is currently live in production, only 5. So yeah, if you like Stargate, if you like LE, just go try it out now on transfer tool XYZ.
00:06:39.265 - 00:06:47.515, Speaker B: Look at you. That was such a BD explanation. It's our 11th bridge, we only have 10 in production. That's awesome.
00:06:47.635 - 00:07:22.914, Speaker A: Love it. Yeah, see, because I wrote the Twitter announcements. I know. Up next we have a PSA from Ronin. So they've recovered 30 million from the bridge hack that happened six months ago, four months ago. So this is basically the US government and chain analysis, which is like a security firm, they work together and They've recovered nearly 30 million in stolen funds. And the team says that this, the 30 million accounts for 12% of the stolen funds as the current total value of the stolen funds is 250 million.
00:07:22.914 - 00:07:36.545, Speaker A: So the original value was 600 million, but the current value of those funds is 250 million. So 30 million is 12%. I mean that's correct math, but I don't know if it works like that.
00:07:37.325 - 00:07:53.791, Speaker B: Chain analysis is single handedly trying to disprove all the people out there saying the only people who use blockchain are criminals. Chainalysis is like, no, actually we're just going to catch every single criminal that is ever uses used a blockchain.
00:07:53.823 - 00:07:56.679, Speaker A: Actually everyone is a criminal, but on like different levels.
00:07:56.767 - 00:08:01.983, Speaker B: And we'll show you how chain houses, they, they'll find you.
00:08:02.079 - 00:08:39.211, Speaker A: Okay, so up next, like staying on the theme of funds recovery, nomad, they've recovered 37 million of the 186 million that they lost in the Bridge hack. In August, like 2nd of August. So I think they. They released a blog post titled Road to Recovery Roadmap. And when they released it, they were on phase one, which is the recovery phase. And now they say that they're in the phase two of the roadmap, which is basically the design mechanism for the fair distribution of recovered funds. They've completed that, the smart contract audits have kicked off.
00:08:39.211 - 00:08:48.295, Speaker A: And what all this means is that phase three, which is the restart of the Nomad Bridge, is likely going to start in early October, which is great news.
00:08:50.715 - 00:09:07.545, Speaker B: Yep. And if you look at their Twitter thread here, law enforcement is making. Where did they sit? Anyways, law enforcement is making headway. That was the big takeaway from that Twitter thread. I can't find the exact quote right now.
00:09:08.125 - 00:09:57.769, Speaker A: Last we have Rainbow Bridge. So they've paused Rainbow Bridge for the merge. You see like on Twitter you'll see a lot of announcements. Every project has a different take on this, but I think in general all bridges are kind of pausing operations for the time being, like the merge timeline and then they'll test everything if it's okay, and then they'll restart. So Rainbow Bridge, basically they've paused all the operations as of 1pm CET on September 11th. And the team basically says that during the merge there will be several technical risks and this step has been taken to mitigate them. So once the merge is completed, they will take everything and resume the bridge.
00:09:57.937 - 00:10:32.329, Speaker B: Yep. And they had a fantastic blog post on the Ethereum merge and what to expect on Aurora. The TLDR of this is. It kind of sounds like the aurora team isn't 100% sure what's going to happen, how many forks they're going to be and how long it's going to take post merge to go live again. So if you're bridging, they recommended, I mean, they shut down the bridge already, but they recommended finalizing everything ASAP and kind of just taking a break while the merge was going on, which I.
00:10:32.337 - 00:10:38.873, Speaker A: Think it's like crypto summer. One week off for everyone. Because Ethereum is under construction, Right?
00:10:39.009 - 00:11:00.989, Speaker B: Exactly. But not off. It's off for builders, but I'm sure there's some retail trades that will be very fun here with all the forks going on. I cannot wait to see. Okay, we're getting ahead of ourselves. All right, so that is it for bridge updates. Next is just what's going on in the multi chain world, which I will lead here.
00:11:00.989 - 00:11:27.445, Speaker B: And the biggest news, as Aurora just hinted at. Well, not Aurora, the Rainbow Bridge, but The Bellatrix update for Ethereum. It is live now. The merge is expected to happen this week. We'll talk about that more in the what's poppin section. I cannot believe this is actually coming to fruition. I'm a little nervous, but I'm also excited.
00:11:27.445 - 00:11:42.665, Speaker B: Next update is Cardano's Basel upgrade now has a date. They I guess they didn't want to let the merge have a full week of rest because Cardano set September 22 as the date for the Vassal upgrade.
00:11:42.785 - 00:11:49.205, Speaker A: I'm just waiting for all the bridge updates that they've paused operations because of the Cardano upgrade.
00:11:52.095 - 00:12:13.447, Speaker B: I. I'm gonna be totally honest, I am not a Cardano expert, but the Vassal has been something they've been looking forward to for a long time in that ecosystem. So that is good for them. I'm glad that they are moving on next. This is probably the most interesting headline I saw this week, but I almost.
00:12:13.511 - 00:12:19.577, Speaker A: Didn'T put it in because like it was not. It was not on topic, but it was not off topic.
00:12:19.721 - 00:13:06.385, Speaker B: Yeah, so we need like a trading expert to come onto the show for this. Maybe we'll bring on Fragile Shark or something like that from our BD team at a later date. But Binance introduced BUSD auto conversion starting on September 29th. This will see users existing balances in new deposits of usdc, USDP and TUSD automatically converted to BUSD at a one to one ratio. This will help Binance with liquidity. So if you can see like look at all of these pairs that they're getting rid of. And so all of these are now going to be trading directly against busd, which I'm sure is great for Binance seeing as they are very active in the creation of busd.
00:13:06.385 - 00:13:23.063, Speaker B: However, I don't know what the main issue is with other stable coins. Like I'd love to see read a thread from someone from a USDC perspective on if this even matters because you can still withdraw USDC to USD and USDP from Binance.
00:13:23.239 - 00:13:32.635, Speaker A: So I think maybe didn't have like enough demand for it because they've not stopped usdt. That's still live.
00:13:33.055 - 00:14:06.617, Speaker B: Yeah, well to me it's just, it's just a liquidity thing. It's just like hey, let's get rid of all these pairs traded against BSD and people want to withdraw one to one. Like okay, they can deposit USDC and then we can mint BSD against that and easy enough. Okay. Next up, the Liquid Staking wars on Cosmos. They're coming soon. So the LIDO community proposed a framework for deploying Lido as a custom implementation designed to serve the liquid staking needs of the entire IBC ecosystem.
00:14:06.617 - 00:15:06.449, Speaker B: Now what the heck does that mean? Pretty much Lido wants to launch on Neutron, which is a Cosmos chain, and then from there, once liquid staking is live on one IBC interchain account Cosm WASM chain, you have to have like four or five different things that you have to have on Cosmos to be able to make this work. But anyways, they're going to deploy on Neutron and then from there liquid assets will be able to be transferred across the Cosmos ecosystem. And this should be just like a huge boost for Cosmos Defi, because right now, because of how Cosmos chains work, a lot of the supply is illiquid and people are just staking and staking and staking because that's where all of the rewards are. But really there's not much. There's not really a huge stablecoin and there's not much actual Defi activity going on. Lido going to Cosmos would be absolutely massive. Do you have anything else to add there?
00:15:06.617 - 00:15:12.365, Speaker A: No, like I want you to move on to the next one because it's like the same week. There are two similar announcements.
00:15:12.745 - 00:15:20.005, Speaker B: Yeah. Oh, sorry. This is. And this is. This is the proposal for Lido going Interchain. Very good proposal. Should definitely read it.
00:15:20.385 - 00:15:28.005, Speaker A: It's actually by a core contributor of L. So it's like this guy works for both the teams.
00:15:29.245 - 00:15:42.765, Speaker B: And then it looks like I didn't open up the link for the next headline, but I'll read it out. Oh, here, now here's what we're going to do. Boom. We're going to just scroll. Look at this, look at this. Nice. But now people can see what's next too.
00:15:42.765 - 00:16:06.137, Speaker B: Anyways, Stride, a blockchain built using the Cosmos SDK, is now offering multi chain liquid staking services for the Cosmos ecosystem. So you've all seen, you've all used probably Staked Eth or Stef. Now Statum is going to exist Staked app thanks to Stride. And you're excited about Stride? Why are you excited about Stride?
00:16:06.281 - 00:16:37.937, Speaker A: I'm not excited about Stride in particular, but so it's like we're seeing a lot of announcements and then each protocol is like trying to front run the other one. So with Layer zero and Axelr, it was like main net upgrades and both of them kind of did it in the same week. This is something that we saw with Polygon and the ZK wars. And then again, suddenly liquid staking Two announcements in the same week. So it's becoming a trend. No one wants to let the other guys have attention for a long time.
00:16:38.081 - 00:17:11.755, Speaker B: Yeah. Speaking of some sort of war. Right. We just saw the liquid staking wars on Cosmos, the ZK war, where teams announced a ZK based chain months in advance of it actually coming out. BNB is now in the game. So BNB is introducing zkbnb, an industry leading zero knowledge proof based scaling solution. It went live to testnet on September 2nd and I think it will be coming soon.
00:17:11.755 - 00:17:13.403, Speaker B: I don't know if there's an exact.
00:17:13.459 - 00:17:18.387, Speaker A: Release date for it, so they've just said we'll release mainnet by the end of this year.
00:17:18.571 - 00:17:23.227, Speaker B: Yep. And I think there's a couple other ZKs coming out at that time.
00:17:23.331 - 00:17:23.963, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:17:24.059 - 00:18:01.261, Speaker B: It's raised to be first. I'm sure we'll talk about it at that time. Lastly, Algorand announced a major upgrade to its protocol which is now live on mainnet. The upgrade features state proofs which enable trustless cross chain communication. I need to do a deep dive to see if I believe if it's truly trustless. That's a big word for us here at Lei. But with the upgrade you get a 5x increase in performance from 1200 to 6000 transactions per second, which that is a mighty big upgrade.
00:18:01.261 - 00:18:04.563, Speaker B: This is. Did I say. I said 5x? Right.
00:18:04.644 - 00:18:04.967, Speaker A: Okay.
00:18:05.047 - 00:18:27.517, Speaker B: I think I said 5x. This is pretty big deal. Algorand still out here shipping. I find it funny that we actually getting like press releases from cryptoc companies this week. Like we had one for Axilar and we're going to have one for Algorand. I think maybe. Do we need to do a press release here at lei? Like no, I think it's just some.
00:18:27.581 - 00:18:33.653, Speaker A: Some of the projects is that style. I've seen a lot of press release from Algorand so I'm not surprised.
00:18:33.829 - 00:18:44.443, Speaker B: Okay. Yeah. I was just like, okay, interesting. All right, next up is what's poppin where Arjun scrolls Twitter for about an hour and thinks what did I just read?
00:18:44.539 - 00:19:33.195, Speaker A: I mean usually like whatever is in this section I don't need to scroll Twitter for because it's like right in your face. Yeah. So this is like the merge week and of course we can't talk about anything else other than the merge. So usually like everything in the news about crypto is like, like we don't make it to the mainstream news unless it's like a hack or something, some cryptocurrency exploding to zero. But this time even the real world, the Web2World, is also paying attention. So if you Google the merge right now, you'll see the countdown to the merge. And this section in our newsletter is basically some great threads that you can check out to prepare yourself for the merge, which is going to go live this week.
00:19:34.225 - 00:19:48.805, Speaker B: Dude, I'm just. I don't know if I'm gonna be able to sleep on Emerge night. It's just gonna be. I'm actually going to. This is the lamest thing I'm gonna say on this podcast ever. I'm gonna go to a merge party.
00:19:50.505 - 00:19:52.161, Speaker A: It's tough to find those people, but.
00:19:52.193 - 00:20:10.257, Speaker B: Okay, there's like a. There's a meetup wherever I live. Can't dox myself right where I'm going to a merge party. They're gonna. They're gonna have the green tea and wine thing that. Of course they're gonna have that there. Which sounds really gross, but should be fun.
00:20:10.401 - 00:20:16.045, Speaker A: There's a merge party in India as well. It's in. It's in Bangalore, but I can't go.
00:20:16.705 - 00:20:21.885, Speaker B: Dang. Okay, maybe you can, like, zoom into my merge party.
00:20:23.385 - 00:20:24.525, Speaker A: That slim.
00:20:28.345 - 00:20:29.165, Speaker B: Okay.
00:20:29.755 - 00:20:31.035, Speaker A: This meme is great.
00:20:31.195 - 00:20:39.815, Speaker B: It's so good. That is. That's me. Okay, so last section of the podcast is interesting reads. Arjun, what you got?
00:20:40.235 - 00:21:15.235, Speaker A: So, the first one is basically a SYNAPSE protocol risk analysis. So, as you know, L2B. L2B will basically publish a full bridge risk framework soon. And this is kind of an insight into what they're looking at in terms of, like, profiling each risk, profiling each bridge by their risk profile. So he's given a breakdown of how they go about looking at each contract and how people can do it themselves as well when they're bridging. But of course, we're lazy and we don't look at smart contracts when bridging. Right.
00:21:16.935 - 00:21:26.607, Speaker B: Look, we have too many bridges to aggregate. We actually. We do look at all that stuff, but no, in general, the.
00:21:26.671 - 00:21:36.495, Speaker A: The regular audience doesn' look at this. But it's like, it's great insight into how someone like Bartek looks at a bridge and the risks involved.
00:21:37.115 - 00:21:38.055, Speaker B: For sure.
00:21:39.075 - 00:22:19.025, Speaker A: Yeah. So the next one is by the Coinbase Threat Intelligence team. So they've done an incident analysis and security recommendation based on the Seabridge, I think, front end attack. So Seabridge front end was hijacked and there was a phishing attacked on the protocol. So this blog is basically they. They do an incident analysis and they give, like, recommend security recommendations for all crypto projects. So I think it's it's a good read for anyone involved in crypto and even users because we are the victims of these attacks.
00:22:19.025 - 00:22:22.315, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. Check it out.
00:22:22.485 - 00:22:32.875, Speaker B: Shout out to Coinbase for publishing informational blogs like this. More and more people should read these because it's just, I mean, they put some work into it.
00:22:33.655 - 00:22:35.275, Speaker A: Some is an understatement.
00:22:35.695 - 00:22:40.463, Speaker B: Okay. They put a lot of work into this, so you should definitely go read it.
00:22:40.639 - 00:23:09.695, Speaker A: Yeah. And the, the third one is notes on synapse and GMX's Twitter spaces. So, I mean, you should ideally check out the Twitter spaces, but the link is not available right now because I think they'll publish it later on. So these notes are kind of a good, good summary of what happened. They talk about, like, how SYNAPSE can be a good building ground for applications once the SYNAPSE change is like.
00:23:11.395 - 00:23:53.945, Speaker B: Beautiful. And on my side, it's kind of a short week for recommended reads, but since we've been off on the Cross Chain Insider for the last couple weeks, I thought I'd just shield my own bag. And we came out with a bridging survival guide. And so if you ever wanted to be like, hey, I want to read 10 articles to totally understand the bridge space. Where do I find those 10 articles? Well, this little news resource here, which is called lefi's Declassified Bridge Survival Guide. Check it out, has all these links and then a quick write up on some of our favorite bridge tools. That's about it.
00:23:53.945 - 00:23:55.457, Speaker B: Do you have anything else, Sergeant?
00:23:55.641 - 00:23:58.925, Speaker A: No, that's about it. Waiting for the merge now.
00:23:59.385 - 00:24:28.235, Speaker B: Waiting for. Yeah, all we're doing is waiting for the merge, of course. And with that, that's the latest episode of the Cross Chain Insider. For more info, please be sure to subscribe to the Cross Chain Insider, the newsletter that Arjun writes that we just went over. You can also check out lefi Li Fi. We're building the ultimate Cross chain money Lego. You can find Lefi on Twitter @lifrotocolifi protocol.
00:24:28.235 - 00:24:35.175, Speaker B: Or you can just come join us on Discord. We're good. Hang. And that is it for the week.
