00:00:07.640 - 00:00:17.925, Speaker A: Welcome to another episode of the Insider. Today I'm joined by Hart, who is the founder of across and honestly, one of the most respected builders in the space. So I'm really looking forward to this conversation.
00:00:19.305 - 00:00:26.491, Speaker B: What a compliment. Thanks, Arjun. I think you're one of the most respected researchers and sort of writers in the space, so trust me, the pleasure is mine.
00:00:26.673 - 00:00:58.115, Speaker A: I'm just like, learning from you guys. I feel like you guys have been around for so long and it's honestly, like a privilege to work alongside you. Before we move into this, like, I just want to congratulate across on, like, some of the recent success that you guys have had. I feel the last six months, you and your team have pushed the space into the right direction. Like, the bridge times have gone down, the user experience has improved. So in terms of, like, PR for the Interop space, Bridge space, I feel like there's a lot of good work that's coming out from your team. So thank you and congratulations on that.
00:00:59.095 - 00:01:37.981, Speaker B: Well, thanks, man. I mean, in all honesty, our success has really hinged and followed what you guys have been doing at LeFi too. And it's really been over the last year, 15 months or so, our own strategy has been try to be really performant within lefi, like within projector gators and just build a really good product that's really competitive. And we honestly, like, it's been. It was kind of our core KPI for a while. We're migrating from that a little bit and we'll get into this. But yeah, man, you guys have showcased the different bridging technologies just through your own product.
00:01:37.981 - 00:01:43.629, Speaker B: And it's been an opportunity for, honestly, for us to showcase what across can do. So, yeah, we appreciate it.
00:01:43.797 - 00:02:05.525, Speaker A: Awesome. So just a brief intro before we kind of get into the details of bridging. I know you've worked for Goldman Sachs on the trading floor, and people like me, we have no sense of what TRADFI actually feels like. And you've worked there, so maybe give us a sense of what it feels like to work for one of the Tradfi firms. How did you transition into crypto? And then what are you building right now?
00:02:06.585 - 00:02:48.049, Speaker B: Yeah, I'll try to keep this short, but there is some interesting story there that also has informed the ACROSS design and frankly, I think it does inform what I think Interop will look like too. So, yeah, my background is that I studied computer science in the States, but I'm Canadian, so I graduated in 2005, which is dating myself. Right. That's a while ago. I Still feel like I just graduated college, but that is still a while ago. And the crazy thing is that when I graduated I wanted to live in New York City. And there was no, there was no texting in New York at all at the time.
00:02:48.049 - 00:03:11.033, Speaker B: And I needed a visa to work there. And so if I wanted to stay in New York, I needed to work for a big company. And the only big companies in New York at the time were financial services companies. And that's how I ended up at Goldman. So it was not my intention. I always kind of thought I'd be in technology. But I worked at Goldman and ended up working in the front office on the trading side where I was a rate strainer.
00:03:11.033 - 00:03:30.095, Speaker B: So I traded primarily government bonds, but interest rate swaps and a bunch of other products from 2005 until about 2013, so through the financial crisis. And yeah, I really did learn a lot about how Tradfi works at the kind of institutional trading level there too. There's probably a whole conversation we can have around that.
00:03:30.255 - 00:03:35.955, Speaker A: What does the office feel like in a Tradfi company? And then how is that different from a crypto company? I'm just curious.
00:03:37.135 - 00:04:02.567, Speaker B: Okay, well we're a remote company, so it's incredibly different. Right. So I sat on a trading floor for a lot of my time at Goldman. I was the 10 year treasury trader. So you guys hear about US government bonds and the major bonds are 2 year, 3 year, 5 year, 10 year. They reintroduced the 7 year while I was there and 30 year bond. And the 10 year treasury bond is a very old school finance job.
00:04:02.567 - 00:05:05.387, Speaker B: So you're in the middle of trading floor and people are shouting at you all day asking you to bid 100 million 10s or offer 100 million 10s and I would literally be the guy. This is like very antiquated. That would voice quote a price and then like type in the trade to confirm it. It's like very old school and I was there. Well, the rates business was becoming electronified. So where more and more of that order flow was entering into electronic systems which actually end up looking a lot like across in like across is a much more sophisticated version and intent based systems are much more sophisticated version where you basically have like on my desk at one point you'd have these pop ups and the pop up was a customer. So like a central bank or hedge fund sending their quote, their request for quote to 5 dealers in competition and you type in a price and then they kick you if you were the best price or not and trade be done and you'd move on.
00:05:05.387 - 00:05:23.375, Speaker B: So it was like a market making setup. And maybe as we get into it, there's a lot of parallels to what Intent based Interop looks like compared to that setup, and how we're kind of building the modern, decentralized, permissionless and much, much more efficient kind of version of that.
00:05:23.675 - 00:05:35.925, Speaker A: Awesome. So like CloudFi invented the intense based design. That's something that we can get into later. But like a quick description of what is across and how did you start that project?
00:05:37.225 - 00:06:22.285, Speaker B: Yeah, okay, so across is Intent based Interrupt. Now, we started this before Intent was a word or really a concept. Again, we got a lot to get into, so I won't go too, too deep on the history, but the other protocol that I founded is called uma, which is an optimistic oracle. Honestly, we were looking for a use case for UMA two years ago when the very first L2s were kind of coming on the scene. So think like Optimism and Arbitrum and they had the first version of across actually very different from what it is now. But at the time there was this withdrawal problem where you could send your assets to Optimism arbitrum in like 20ish minutes. But it was going to take you seven days to get off those chains.
00:06:22.285 - 00:06:52.029, Speaker B: And so we were figuring out the first version of Cross only went in one direction. It only let you get assets off those chains. And we realized that sending a message between chains was something of an Oracle problem. So in this case, you needed Ethereum to know what was happening on a different chain. And that's kind of like an oracle. It's like, hey, I need to know something that is not inherently native to this chain. And frankly, across was like this internal hackathon project, this V1.
00:06:52.029 - 00:07:26.685, Speaker B: We just hacked it together. It was interesting, worked pretty well. And then we made the decision that actually there's a real opportunity here. And that's when we built across V2, which was the precursor to this Intent based model. The across V2 design, which would be more than two years old now, is pretty much unchanged from what we have today. We've just figured out a lot of ways to make it more competitive and more optimized. And to me, this Intent based design very much does depend on competition in like a market forces sense.
00:07:26.685 - 00:07:56.253, Speaker B: And so one of the things that's really interesting to kind of think about is like, well, across as a protocol has gotten a lot, a lot better over the last two years, but the architecture hasn't really changed. What's just changed is the competition within this, the structure has Made it a lot more performant. And if you play that forward, I think there's a lot more performance that still is going to be found in this intent based design. But yeah, maybe we go backwards and just talk about what intents are and what this intent based design is too.
00:07:56.309 - 00:08:22.205, Speaker A: Yeah. Just a side note, UMA was literally the first project that I saw in the crypto space. And my friend introduced me to Uma and I just remember following Clayton on some discord where he was giving some ama. So that was just a very interesting tidbit. Like, I didn't realize that you guys are the same team behind across for a very long time. But yeah, that was my first project that I found out about in crypto.
00:08:22.745 - 00:08:42.899, Speaker B: That's cool, man. I like that. Yeah. I mean, for the audience and for the viewers and listeners, like, what UMA is, is what we call an optimistic oracle. And so it's a different oracle than a price feed oracle, like Jane Linker, Pittsburgh. It's an oracle where you say, hey, I want to know if something is true. So it's arbitrary.
00:08:42.899 - 00:09:27.611, Speaker B: And our primary use case that most people know us for now is supporting Poly Market. So all these prediction markets, there's a question like, who won a presidential election? And it's not a price feed question, it's an arbitrary long tail question. And the core structure here is you propose something as being like, okay, this event is true, and if nobody disputes it, it gets taken as true after some challenge window. So it's kind of optimistic in that design. And then if there is a challenge, we have this cool crypto economic game that's roughly based off something Vitalik wrote in 2014. Actually, that's a shelling point based system which we won't get into because it's not the point of this podcast. But you can use this same design to say something, to be abstract for a second.
00:09:27.611 - 00:09:41.847, Speaker B: I can use the same concept to say, hey, was this batch of intents fulfilled or not? And that's kind of the parallel and the tie between the two projects. But yeah, let's go back to across and what we're working on there.
00:09:41.951 - 00:10:13.325, Speaker A: I mean, so you said you built across as an application or like a use case for Uma's Optimistic Oracle. Right. And intense. The definition got popularized sometime last year. So maybe just give us a sense of what our intents and why did you embrace this branding? Right. Because across was not known as the intent based bridge early on. But then suddenly there was this intense wave and then I saw like within a month, everything about across was intense, and now it's like, championing the design in the bridge ecosystem.
00:10:14.305 - 00:10:46.685, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, I'm almost tempted to ask you how you define intense because, like, you write about this a lot. Maybe I should. But there was a strategic decision here where we're like, hey, our design. So, okay, one of the problems with intents is the word is so generic. Like, it is a pretty generic word, but it did seem like something that was a growing narrative. And we did make a strategic decision where we're like, hey, this is literally how a cross works.
00:10:46.685 - 00:11:14.165, Speaker B: If this is how crypto Twitter is understanding this architecture, we should lean into it and own it. And so, yeah, beginning of the year, ish. We did make that call and lean into it. So, yeah, like, what are intents here? And again, lots of flavors and lots of nuance. So let's be specific about a cross chain intent. A cross chain intent. You, Arjun, say, I want.
00:11:14.165 - 00:11:32.849, Speaker B: I want to do this on that blockchain. Right? Let's be more specific. I want to move one eth from. We'll make it from A to B. I want to move 1 ETH from Arbitrum to base. That is my intent. You specify that you put your eth somewhere.
00:11:32.849 - 00:12:02.011, Speaker B: You put it into basically an escrow contract, and then you want somebody to fulfill you. And if they fulfill your intent, they will get your eth that you put in escrow. So the steps here are basically three steps, right? You escrow your 1 ETH with your intent. A third party fills your intent. In this case, they give you one eth on base, on the destination chain. You're happy, you move on with your day. You don't care what happens after that.
00:12:02.011 - 00:12:17.815, Speaker B: But then the person that filled you, which we call a relayer or solver person that filled you, they do care. They want to get paid back. So then we verify that the intent was in fact fulfilled, and we release your escrow eth on the origin chain to them.
00:12:18.515 - 00:12:39.655, Speaker A: Makes sense. I think that's a very simple definition and that's good for now. What I want to get into is how you've kind of modernized this stack. Right? Like, what you explained was three different processes in a way. And in V3, you've kind of broken it up and made it possible for anyone to tap into one specific layer. So maybe help us go through that one by one. Like, what are the three layers?
00:12:40.155 - 00:13:36.405, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. It's interesting too, because we've promoted this kind of three layer approach, but we're not the only team that has been Talking about it this way, the cake kind of the frontier research cake research group who are now making the one balance product. They also talk about this layers of the cake, Socket, who doesn't really talk about this as intense, but like socket talks about this kind of layered approach here too. So I actually think it's kind of cool that a bunch of smart teams have kind of aligned on this similar sort of modularization, which I think means we're kind of onto something collectively. So the approach here, first layer, what we'll call like the application layer, maybe you call it the RFQ layer. It's like, hey, an intent gets created. And in my example, your intent, Arjun, was I want to move 1 ETH from arbitrary base from A to B.
00:13:36.405 - 00:14:08.915, Speaker B: Okay, intense created second layer, solvers, we call them relayers, compete to fill your intent. So open competition layer. And I think it's really important for there to be a lot of competition there. And then bottom layer, third layer, what we call settlement. So I said in our example, your initial deposit on the origin chain is escrowed. So it's escrowed in the settlement layer. And after you get filled, we verify that the intent was filled and the settlement layer releases those funds back to the solver.
00:14:08.915 - 00:14:15.965, Speaker B: So kind of think about that three step process maps to these sort of three layers of this architecture.
00:14:16.095 - 00:14:54.379, Speaker A: Correct. So first is like the auction layer in a way where your intent goes into and then all of these relayers are bidding for that intent. And then the second one is kind of where like across stands out right now because maybe we can get into that as well. Right. Like, so in the intent space there's a lot of talk about like a lack of relayers or solvers and across today because it's one of the best bridges or like the bridge with the one of the most order flow is able to attract more solvers. Right. So you guys actually have 15 participating solvers at this moment, or like more than that, but like 15 active solvers.
00:14:54.379 - 00:14:59.495, Speaker A: So are other teams also tapping into this layer or is it just across right now?
00:15:01.395 - 00:15:48.451, Speaker B: I mean other teams are tapping into this and this is like, I think we'll talk about this more of this standard that we're putting forward with Uniswap, which we put forward as an ERC. So it's ERC 7683, a standard for cross chain intents. But actually maybe we go back to the TRADFI example. It's like if I'm a market maker on the ten year treasury and a client like hedge fund XYZ is asking me to offer 100 million ten year treasuries. Well, you could think about a market where there's only one market maker and then they just have to take my price. They're a price taker and I would set the price and they could choose to do it or not. But if there's an open competitive market, you could imagine that.
00:15:48.451 - 00:16:18.365, Speaker B: Okay, so I offer that price and JP Morgan offers this price and Deutsche bank offers that price and it's competitive. And that's exactly what's going on here. Right. So, and what's really cool is this solver layer is permissionless. Anyone can choose to be a solver. And so we literally just have a market structure. And what we have is the more order flow, the more volume, the more solvers want to participate because there's more activity, more for them to do, more money for them to make.
00:16:18.365 - 00:16:41.671, Speaker B: And therefore it gets more competitive and actually pricing gets better. And we literally have seen exactly this happen. And this is why across our core architecture hasn't really changed much at all in the last two years. But our performance is way, way, way, way better because we have so much more competition at this solver layer. Yeah. And it's only growing. Right.
00:16:41.671 - 00:17:06.903, Speaker B: So it's like order flow begets more solvers, which gets more competition, which makes the pricing better. And one of the really cool things here is like competition kind of capitalism. People here are going to compete down to the marginal cost of delivering the service. So it ends up becoming really, really, really competitive. And in theory, users are going to get the best possible price that they can for this service that's offered.
00:17:07.039 - 00:17:28.755, Speaker A: Yeah. So it's basically like a marketplace where all the relayers are kind of bidding for order flow. Right. And Then getting into ERC7683 now you're opening up this marketplace with this standard so that anyone can actually tap into this ecosystem. So maybe tell us about how did you come up with the standard and why did you come up with the standard? What's your incentive here?
00:17:29.615 - 00:18:14.085, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, okay, so very simply, it was a bit more than a year ago at ECC in Paris. So not this year, but in 2023, Uniswap X put forward their Uniswap acquired paper, which is an intent based system. Right now it's only a single chain intent based system. So it's only, it's like cow swap or 1 inch fusion where I'm going to have market makers compete for the best price to fill me on a swap on the Same chain. But they also talked about how this could work in a cross chain context. And so, I mean, I won't lie, I was like, oh, shit, SWAB is going to compete with us. And I know these guys and I know that team for a very, very long time.
00:18:14.085 - 00:19:14.705, Speaker B: And they reference us in their white paper and are pretty complimentary their design and talked about this. And we basically just realized and concluded that it is in the best interests of all of us to have the most competition possible at the solver layer. And it's the same. It's just like, if I'll try to. I actually haven't done this before, but if I try to make a bunch of examples back to TradFi, you're saying, okay, Goldman Sachs is going to have an OTC desk for tenured Treasuries and JP Morgan is too. Well, if we can define the way users ask us for quotes, our users are going to get better liquidity and our pricing is going to look better because they're going to be able to ask JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs and everybody else, they're going to be able to put them in competition and there's going to be more liquidity and more competition on that flow. And so the Uniswap team and our team are just like, yeah, this is obviously true.
00:19:14.705 - 00:19:38.627, Speaker B: We should try to standardize what this process looks like. Because if we can standardize it, it's easier for market makers or solvers, or relayers, whatever we want to call them, it's easier for them to participate in this system. And therefore we'll all get better liquidity and better fills. So it's positive sum that way. So that was kind of the origin of how we came up with this standardization kind of initiative.
00:19:38.771 - 00:19:49.435, Speaker A: But the marketplace that we're opening up now, wasn't that the edge for across? And why does Uniswap want to open it up? Why can't they bootstrap their own marketplace?
00:19:50.535 - 00:20:31.005, Speaker B: I don't know. I mean, like, I don't really think that is the edge. It's like, I look at this as just fundamentally, you've got to be user focused, right? How do you deliver the user the best possible experience? Right? And it's interesting. So one question is like, hey, you just had me walk through like the three layers of this stack. It's like the order layer, the solver layer, and the settlement layer. It's like, okay, well, which layer is across? And to be honest, we just care ultimately about the whole experience. Like, is the user able to do a cross Chain action cheaply and quickly.
00:20:31.005 - 00:20:55.939, Speaker B: And across cares about that end state and we should as a protocol be doing whatever we need to make that happen here. Right. And so early on, like we did run the solver that did almost all of the volume. Right. That was like our bootstrapping kind of initiative to make sure this system worked. But we don't do that anymore. Right.
00:20:55.939 - 00:21:14.995, Speaker B: And I don't think we should. I don't think it's actually the best thing for the protocol or for the architecture. So we just want there to be the most possible competition of that solver layer. And ultimately, if we get a lot of adoption, a lot of order flow through this system, I think it's good for a cross.
00:21:15.815 - 00:21:34.275, Speaker A: Okay, so in this type of setup, a user is just an intent based protocol user. Right? Like then it's not a Uniswap user or an across user. So where does across then fit into it? Right? Like is it at the settlement layer where you can now kind of build your moat?
00:21:35.615 - 00:22:05.489, Speaker B: I think it's at either above the solver layer or below it. I think, Arjun, this is where we're still early, so we'll see where this goes. Intense gets sourced from some source. Lefi, like literally what you guys do is a very big source of order flow for us. Uniswap's front end could be a source of order flow. Across his front end is also a source of order flow. Any source of order flow, we don't care.
00:22:05.489 - 00:22:33.931, Speaker B: We just ultimately we want to do the most order flow we can. Seems to make sense. I do think across, we write settlement layer contracts right now and we think that we're pretty good at that and we think we can get better. And we do think we have a bit of an advantage of understanding how to structure those well. But elsewhere we still lean on other teams to maybe they write their own selling contracts. We'll see. I don't know.
00:22:33.931 - 00:23:10.585, Speaker B: And I do think there are some, like, network effects, some like lightweight network effects around, you know, the other origin from Everclear talks about this too. But lightweight effects around netting and how you would settle things more efficiently, some of many of which across does today. But there's a lot more innovation in that space, which is what Arjun Forever Clear is, is pushing. So yeah, I think we can capture value there. But if you also go above it, we're like, okay, well how should we distribute these intents to what is. And I'm not even sure if it's an auction, right. And this is.
00:23:10.585 - 00:23:36.705, Speaker B: There's some work here. We're doing that. Maybe we're not quite ready to share either. But like, is there an auction? Do we auction off that intent? Is it like an open, free, competitive market? There's lots of different paths there of what that might. And so I think across can capture value in running different types of auctions there as well. So I think there's lots of opportunity both places.
00:23:37.405 - 00:23:59.847, Speaker A: Got it. Got it. So I think initially how I understood things, I felt like Across Edge was in the solver network because you guys had the order flow, you guys had the solvers and other bridges were kind of just catching up. Right. So they, they were at the position where across was a year ago. They would be running their own solver, they would have two solvers. So that was my initial thinking.
00:23:59.847 - 00:24:11.995, Speaker A: But how you are explaining it right now is basically that you care about collecting the order flow and then just settling the order flow and you want to open up the solver layer so that there are more bids going in for the orders.
00:24:12.495 - 00:24:44.365, Speaker B: Absolutely. It's fundamentally, in a sense, it's pretty simple. It's have the best possible product for the users, get the most usage for your product that way, have the best experience and, you know, have. I don't want to undersell this, but it's like, I think that's a very valuable place to be. Right. And I think, as you're well aware, right, the interop space is super competitive right now. Now's not the time to try to like charge fees, I don't think.
00:24:44.365 - 00:25:01.675, Speaker B: But I do think that if you have a position of being like the dominant architecture that works well, there is real value in both how we distribute those order flows and how we settle them and where we want to sit there.
00:25:02.175 - 00:25:17.715, Speaker A: Got it. Another question that I had on the standard was like, what are the incentives for other people to join into this? Wouldn't they just build their own thing, like other than the standard and then they would use their own protocol for settlement.
00:25:19.895 - 00:25:39.641, Speaker B: I mean, you could use your own protocol for settlement. Like part of the standard is to do that. Right. And this is just. You know, I listened to some of the other podcasts here too. It's like when you crypto is hyper competitive, right. We're in a space of open source software, ideas are publicly disseminated, which I think is amazing.
00:25:39.641 - 00:26:16.007, Speaker B: Right. But execution is hard. And so we're. All we're trying to do is be like, hey, we've got a solver network you can tap into. You guys giving more order flow to our solver network, even if it doesn't touch across in any way, shape or form. It's still going to make the solver network deeper if they're all following the same standard. And so that's going to give across users better fills because there's more competitive solver network and we're very confident that we are going to have competitive advantages in how we distribute those intents through auctions or RQ systems or whatever else.
00:26:16.007 - 00:26:30.835, Speaker B: And we're also pretty confident we're going to have advantages in how we settle them too just because we have a lot of order flow and there are some network effects and some efficiencies that come from netting and otherwise settling offsetting flows.
00:26:31.145 - 00:26:49.325, Speaker A: Got it. So let's say when we have more solvers in this layer, how do you see this benefiting across in terms of user experience? Is it better rates, is it faster fills or is it also chain abstraction? Not chain abstraction, chain expansion, just all of the above.
00:26:49.865 - 00:27:18.835, Speaker B: All the above. A lot of it still depends and this is where we can get pretty technical here too. Across right now today is primarily speed based competition. Like we're not actually having the solvers compete on price. And I actually, I think there's a lot for us to talk on about this focus on speed that we have and why we think that's important right now. I think like cross chain bridging is cheap enough that pricing isn't actually the differentiating factor. I think it's speed.
00:27:18.835 - 00:27:25.959, Speaker B: We can talk about views on that why we're making that bet where we could be wrong. There's I actually want to know.
00:27:26.047 - 00:27:34.875, Speaker A: That was one of my questions. So like across is known for its speed, right. But the rates are also good. So it's not like the rates are bad but why the bet on speed over rates?
00:27:36.015 - 00:28:23.187, Speaker B: Well, okay, let's go deeper on this because. Okay, first of all, just to finish your question, right, it's like I think the deeper, more competitive solver network means like it is all the above. It'll get faster, it'll get cheaper, it'll support more flow and more volume, frankly more reliable. We should also touch on some of the like the liveness concerns that we're sometimes critiqued of and why I think that's not really a reasonable critique. And it will also get to more chains too. Right. You can also think about this solver network as being really dynamic where I'll make tradviate examples of 10 year treasury bonds is one of the most liquid markets in the world.
00:28:23.187 - 00:29:02.663, Speaker B: Bid offer like the pricing of it is extremely tight. But if you go to emerging markets bid offers much wider, right? So maybe what you have is a solver network where if they're they're filling trades on less used chains, they charge a lot more. Right. And that's their expertise. Much in the same way that there are like em traders that focus on trading emerging market bonds and have the much lower, much smaller volumes but wider bid offer and that's their competitive advantage. And you just imagine this dynamic structure where this market force, you're going to have solvers find their niche and their specialty and like double down on that.
00:29:02.839 - 00:29:03.675, Speaker A: Got it.
00:29:04.655 - 00:29:50.663, Speaker B: But back to speed. So I think across is extremely cheap. I can make some spicy takes here. If you look at the marginal or the median transfer size of both across and like our competitors on the median transfer size, it's truly L2 to L2 depending on the time and bridge you look at, it's about a 50 buck transfer right now. I'd be curious for you guys to pull lei data and to look at this too. But I think if you look at L2 to L2 transfers, post Denkun and blobs, people really are moving fairly small amounts of money between chains. And so a 50 buck transfer is pretty tiny.
00:29:50.663 - 00:30:38.375, Speaker B: And at that size across people will like freak out at this. But go look at the data. I think at that size across is actually the cheapest for this. And there's a bunch of data sources including one Duke dashboard by a user called Sandman that supports this. So I think we are the cheapest or very, very close to the cheapest for most transactions when you think about them on a median basis. So that does matter, like costs matter. But speed, this is one of those things where every so often I kind of want to like shake crypto people and be like, do we you not look at what matters to like the rest of the world and to Web2 and all this kind of stuff.
00:30:38.375 - 00:31:29.595, Speaker B: Speed matters. Users like think of any conversion funnel where you're trying to sell something, right? You're like a checkout experience and you're trying to sell a user and anytime you have them to wait for minutes, your conversion on making a sale is way, way lower. And my personal opinion is like okay, if something takes two hours, there's a really big difference between two hours and two minutes. I think there's also a big difference between two minutes and 20 seconds. And then I think when you go from 20 seconds to two seconds you're now it's just, it's literally a different type of product. So I think that this world of us trying to onboard a billion users. I don't think you can ask the next billion users to wait 20 seconds for something to happen.
00:31:29.595 - 00:31:36.815, Speaker B: I think you got to tell them this thing happened in two seconds or less. And that's our focus and that's what we want to work on.
00:31:36.975 - 00:31:58.101, Speaker A: Makes sense. I feel like that's also pretty use case specific. If I'm rebalancing my portfolio, I would wait two minutes. I would take it because I'm doing it once every month or every three months. But let's say I'm on ramping or off ramping or buying something on chain. I would like it to be done as soon as possible. I don't care if I'm paying 10 cents more, 50 cents more or even a dollar more.
00:31:58.101 - 00:32:00.065, Speaker A: Right. So it depends on the use case.
00:32:00.925 - 00:32:43.045, Speaker B: Yeah, totally. I mean, I think that's exactly right. And I just think as you start expanding use cases and we start talking about really, really growing web3, I think the number of use cases where the two second experience matters is very large. Right. It's a little bit of the difference between like, I don't know, we'll keep making tradfi analogies. So if you're hedge fund XYZ and you're doing a huge trade and you care a lot about price, sure, you can wait a couple minutes to confirm your trade. A Robinhood user clicking on their trading app to do little trades, they don't want to wait, they want click done in that order.
00:32:43.045 - 00:33:08.633, Speaker B: And as you start thinking through all of the type of consumer use cases that I really, really hope web3 grows into, and this is like we're still talking about moving money here, but these consumer use cases are about moving small amounts of money. And for retail consumers, a very fast user experience is critical to like the product, the overall product experience. And so that's the area we're focused on.
00:33:08.809 - 00:33:26.565, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it definitely makes sense. Like your focus on speed is right. And you're also taking like you're doing stuff to improve the price as well. Right. So it's not like you're focusing on speed over price. It's just a thing of prioritization. Like speed first and then we'll work on prices, which you're doing right now.
00:33:27.345 - 00:33:28.657, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.
00:33:28.841 - 00:33:41.955, Speaker A: The next section, I kind of want to just do like an intense masterclass. So like what would be your pull case for Intense? Like what has to go right for intense to become the go to way of doing things in crypto dope.
00:33:43.575 - 00:34:03.755, Speaker B: Yeah. So I do Want to make this kind of conversational and get your takes on this too. Right. But the way I look at it is a user wants to do something on another chain right now that's moving money. But in the future and across does support this today, which we can talk about. It's like move money plus do action. Right.
00:34:03.755 - 00:34:36.415, Speaker B: And one mental model is to think about this like a remote control. I'm on my home chain and I want to remotely control this destination chain and I want it to make it so easy I don't even really realize it's happening. And so I'm going to call that the intent. So the users are specifying these intents. The bull case is we define a common standard for what this looks like, which makes it really easy for applications to utilize this. That standard that we're working on right now is the 7683 standard for cross channel intents. So we define that.
00:34:36.415 - 00:34:58.379, Speaker B: We then have this network of solvers that fill these intents. They fill them cheaply and quickly. It's pretty transparent to the user. It's super fast and really cheap. That seems like a really, really compelling world to live in. One that like almost seems obvious that that's like kind of what we need. But I think it defragments Ethereum.
00:34:58.379 - 00:35:12.265, Speaker B: It kind of like unifies this multi chain world. It's not just about Ethereum. It defragments, blockchains, period. And it creates this glue that sticks together all these chains that we know we're going to have and makes it be like one experience.
00:35:12.725 - 00:35:45.227, Speaker A: Yeah, I think I would agree with that bull case in the sense that this is the vision of intents. And that's why I feel it's so powerful. It's just like, okay, you come click a button and then we'll take care of the rest. It's the simplest pitch possible, something that even my parents could understand. You don't have to figure out what chains to work on or just click some buttons and we'll figure out the rest. So I feel like if we go back to the three layers again, just more competition on the solver layer and then how that unlocks better prices and better experiences. That's the bull case.
00:35:45.227 - 00:36:08.865, Speaker A: And how much can we expand this solver network without fragmentation, which is where the market forces come into the picture. So I'm not sure if it can actually happen because everyone will try to build their own thing. Right? Like you guys are taking this forward in your own way, but not everyone has to agree with you. So they would build their own solution and it's in there like they have the incentive to do it as well. So they will do it at some point.
00:36:09.765 - 00:36:44.917, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean this goes back to, there's lots of interesting questions here around like vendor lock in and like, you know, there's this tricky balance where. Yeah. Crosses the protocol and we, you know, want to make money for our token holders. We don't want to just. It's not a public good per se. Right. But also I do think that you need to define in crypto you've got to build things that like make sense here.
00:36:44.917 - 00:37:22.035, Speaker B: And so if this intent structure makes sense, and we agree that it does, then great, let's go and build intents, have them make sense, deliver the best possible experience to the users. We're not doing this in a vendor lock in way at all. We're defining common standards and we are going to compete to have the cheapest and best possible experience in a way that is very open and transparent. And I'm very confident we can capture value that way. And again, if competitors want to build their own solver network, like go for it. But we're literally saying, hey, here's a common solver network. We want feedback on the standard.
00:37:22.035 - 00:37:26.855, Speaker B: We think it works pretty well and we think it's positive some if other people utilize this too.
00:37:27.555 - 00:37:38.945, Speaker A: And maybe you want to comment on like how Vitalik is promoting it because I don't know what's going on there but like how did he get into ERC7683? Because I see him promoting in it in some tweets.
00:37:39.245 - 00:37:58.665, Speaker B: Yeah, well, I mean from Vitalik's perspective, I think it's also really interesting to step back and he's like, okay, Ethereum is his baby. The Super Chain isn't his baby. Arbitrum Orbit's not his baby. Right. Polygon CDK is not his baby. They kind of all are derivative babies because they're built on his thing. Right.
00:37:58.665 - 00:38:31.065, Speaker B: And so he loves them all. But what. And he writes about this about just the, the advantages, I'm forgetting the title of the blog post. But he celebrates the diversity that Ethereum allows and that this roll up centric framework allows. And I think that's really cool because you do have these different teams and these different L2 stacks competing in different dimensions, which is great. But then he goes back and it's like, okay, well the marginal user that comes and joins Ethereum, like they just want one experience, they want it to be unified. Right.
00:38:31.065 - 00:39:10.435, Speaker B: And this, like you said earlier, this is a pretty simple Concept that you can explain to your mom where you're just kind of like, okay, specify what you want to do on Ethereum or any other chain and this architecture is going to figure it out. Right. So I think Vitalik likes that as an open common standard to defragment Ethereum. I mean, we love to have his support, but I also, when I talk to him about this, you know, our intentions here are genuine. Like, we're like, hey, this is something that we think makes sense and we're going to put it forward as a common standard that we hope other people build on.
00:39:11.055 - 00:39:22.851, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, totally makes sense. So now I want to get into the bear case. Not exactly the bear case, but I just, I'm just going to put some statements in front of you that are common criticisms of the intent based design. Right.
00:39:22.923 - 00:39:23.735, Speaker B: I love it.
00:39:24.675 - 00:39:33.095, Speaker A: Like, I've also said it a few times. So this is going to be interesting. The first one is probably the most popular one. Right? Like intents are just limit orders.
00:39:34.035 - 00:40:06.575, Speaker B: I mean, sure, you could think about a limited version of Intent as limit order. Right. I've got two answers to that. First of all, I think that's not true. But even if it is true, like that's 95% of what people want to do today. One of the things that, and okay, I actually think your critique, we could make it more specific. I think you could say that the version of Intents that Across is pushing forward with Uniswap is just across, chain, limit order.
00:40:06.575 - 00:40:50.569, Speaker B: Other projects like Anoma and some very other really other smart teams push out like generalized intents where you can really specify anything. So first of all, the design philosophy we have is to solve for the most common use case today and start there and do a really good job of that and then add things over time. So the most common use case today is I want to move an asset from chain A to chain B. And I truly believe that that hasn't been enough focus of the space. We've made that our focus over the last year and I think it's been beneficial to across. If we go back like a year and a half ago, everybody was talking about their arbitrary messaging framework. And like we weren't.
00:40:50.569 - 00:41:04.601, Speaker B: We specifically were like, I don't see the value of arbitrary messaging here. I think the value is moving assets. And so we focused on that. Maybe a hot take we can go back into like arbitrary messaging and where we think value is a little bit later, but we'll see that.
00:41:04.753 - 00:41:15.385, Speaker A: But yeah, I don't agree with the intensity limit orders Critique anyway. Like maybe there are limit orders right now, but that's where the order flow is coming from, right? So like yeah, it's absolutely pointless.
00:41:15.885 - 00:41:47.745, Speaker B: Like what a cross supports today and what our standard supports too. But it's not like the standard is very fresh, it's in draft form and we need more feedback. But you can include arbitrary data you execute on the destination chain. And so that means that you could have an intent and across can do this today. My intent is bridge one eth from A to B and buy this NFT or deposit into this lending protocol. There are constraints about what we can do with that if the destination chain is not a smart contract wallet. Right.
00:41:47.745 - 00:42:07.021, Speaker B: We can't execute permission code like our because our the relayer is executing this code. So if it's permission code they need to execute on the destination chain, it will fail. But there's lots of examples where there's not permission code. It's like buying an NFT that we can do today. And so there you go. That's more than just a cross chain limit order. Right?
00:42:07.093 - 00:42:08.205, Speaker A: Okay, cool.
00:42:08.325 - 00:42:22.549, Speaker B: And play this forward to where things go. Once you have account abstraction and you very much don't have a cross chain limit order, what you have is a remote control for the destination chain. Okay, so there's my counterpoint to critique one. What else we got?
00:42:22.677 - 00:42:36.695, Speaker A: Got it. So the next one is that intents are centralized, right? Like maybe in your standard they're not so centralized, but there will be other teams who have one relayer doing all the work and it's just their own team run Relayer. Right. So like what do you have to see for that?
00:42:38.115 - 00:43:14.985, Speaker B: I mean like it's one of those things where when you have a permissionless system and people join, is it centralized if on day one there is only one team doing it? I don't know. Maybe. Right. But I think our story is very emblematic of what's actually happened here. So yeah, across was the team that ran this solver in the early days of Across. We still do run a solver, but we do not do the majority of transactions, like nowhere close. And so we have a competitive ecosystem that I think is very truly robustly decentralized.
00:43:14.985 - 00:43:49.137, Speaker B: And anybody can run a solver and many people do. There's also like there's another difference here of like, you can say something's decentralized, but if one entity only does it, then is it really. And like we'll be spicy for a second here too. So some of our major competitor like Stargate and Layer 0 talks about DVNs, their verification networks being decentralized. You can run your own, right? But nobody does. Right? They all use the layer 0 or nethermind, whatever. They'll know this better than I do.
00:43:49.137 - 00:44:03.725, Speaker B: There's just a very limited number of DVNs that are run. And so I think we're doing a pretty good job of allowing anybody to run these services and they actually do because there's an economic incentive to do so.
00:44:04.105 - 00:44:19.185, Speaker A: Makes sense. I feel like the approach towards both like devns with layer zero and you guys with solvers is kind of the same, right? Like allow anyone to build their own and participate, but if you, if people do it or not, it's up to them and how incentives are aligned.
00:44:19.565 - 00:45:01.813, Speaker B: There's one core difference though, which is economic incentives here, right? So like running, running a relayer and across is profitable, which is why we have third parties do it. Those third parties are not incentivized at all. This is a very cool aspect of our system that I think is underappreciated. We are. No one is incentivizing across nor anybody else is incentivizing these solvers to do their job. They're paid by the fees the user is paying and it's highly competitive even at low fees because this is a profitable thing to do. And so there's a sustainability aspect to this too, where you have to be sustainably, you have to have sustainable economics to have true decentralization.
00:45:01.813 - 00:45:09.145, Speaker B: And I think that's something that we actually figured out earlier, frankly earlier than I expected. And I'm actually pretty proud of it.
00:45:09.655 - 00:45:22.807, Speaker A: I mean, you should be, even with deviants. I just want to say that there's a possibility of adding a fee so you can technically build a business around it. But that's probably a different discussion. Let's not get into that again.
00:45:22.831 - 00:45:35.401, Speaker B: We go into theory versus reality. It's fair to say that you can do that. I think that's a fair thing to say. But at the same time you should say right now there really is an economic incentive to do so today. That's all.
00:45:35.553 - 00:45:59.285, Speaker A: Okay, and the next critique is kind of based around what we just talked about, right? Like how solvers make profits. So is it true, like you've been running intense in production for the last two years, right? So how much profit do the top solvers make and what's the distribution like once you start going down the leaderboard? Is there enough money to be made by all of them or is it just more top heavy?
00:46:01.995 - 00:46:40.643, Speaker B: So there's a lot of Nuance to that. Right. Like, first off, we don't know the exact economics of these solvers. We can estimate them, maybe it's quite a bit of work to do, but we don't know generally speaking. And again, we can go pretty deep on the technical aspect here. Solvers in our network, they get paid a fee by the user. They have to pay the destination gas fee, so they have to pay that and then they don't get paid back immediately.
00:46:40.643 - 00:47:31.999, Speaker B: Right. They fill the user and lend the user money and then they get paid back by the protocol after we verify the intent gets filled. Obviously the system is going to work better and better the faster we can pay them back. And so one of the things we want to do is pay relayers back faster. We'll make the system cheaper for them. But roughly speaking, if you were to charge, to give you some numbers to kind of estimate what solver profitability looks like, if you were to charge a user 2 basis points and you were to pay them back in two hours, which is a long time, and we pay them back faster than that, which. But if you were to pay them back in two hours, if you make a loan every two hours for two basis points, that would annualize to 180% annualized return.
00:47:31.999 - 00:47:54.495, Speaker B: So like a really profitable business, that of course is completely unfair because that assumes you're like immediately always using all your capital all the time. So that's not accurate. It's lower than that. But if you can figure out how to use your capital, know, 20% of the time. Right. That's a 36% annualized return. Right.
00:47:54.495 - 00:48:11.695, Speaker B: If you can figure out how to use your capital more efficiently than that, you can earn more. This is where like estimating solver profitability isn't the easiest thing to do. But it's profitable because these guys are competing and they, they keep showing up. Right.
00:48:12.635 - 00:48:25.115, Speaker A: And I feel like that's normal for any industry. Right. Like, the top guys will of course make more money. Like, you can't have it any other way. They're specialized, they're better at their job, so they will tend to make more profits.
00:48:25.495 - 00:48:50.719, Speaker B: Yeah. But again, the market's dynamic here too. Right. And so go back to your earlier questions. It's like, okay, so some new chains join the across network. They have less order flow, but maybe there's some solvers that specialize in them and that's where they have. And again, Cross doesn't do all of these things today, but you could imagine there being like more wider fees on those chains.
00:48:50.719 - 00:49:03.395, Speaker B: And so it's more profitable. Right. If we get the market mechanics right, you will just have a dynamic competitive marketplace that's sorting things out here.
00:49:03.735 - 00:49:19.225, Speaker A: Makes sense. So like, specialization can lead to more profits and then there's enough for everyone to do in a way. So the last one that I want to touch on is the scaling bit. Right. Like there's a criticism that intents won't be able to scale to a thousand chains. So any thoughts on that?
00:49:20.005 - 00:50:25.155, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, look, I think there's some aspects of this that are quite interesting to think about here too. To me, the answer is it's a marketplace. So like, if we design the marketplace correctly and there's demand to bridge to those chains at some price, then intense absolutely scales to support them. I think the question, the more nuanced question is really like, what is that price? Like, how much do we have to pay a solver to show up and support a chain that doesn't get much order flow or much volume? And that to me is a more interesting question where you're like, okay, what would it cost to support a chain that doesn't have much volume? And the answer is very nuanced. And it might not be that much because let's just say one of these chains is like a gaming chain where nobody's moving more than $5 there ever. You can go and support your solver could have a thousand bucks sitting on that chain and it supports all the volume that chain will ever need for fairly low cost. It seems totally plausible.
00:50:25.155 - 00:50:38.089, Speaker B: The scenarios that wouldn't work very well would be a chain that like very randomly has huge volume going to it and then long periods of no volume. Right?
00:50:38.217 - 00:50:38.521, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:50:38.553 - 00:51:02.205, Speaker B: So that's a chain where you like in that design be like, okay, well this is pretty. You know, you have to charge high fees to support the user at the times of high utilization. And then you sit there and make no money in the no utilization times. That's a more interesting use case. So I also think like this is a, this is the type of thing. Thing where I think you said it on your last podcast. You know, nuance gets lost on Twitter.
00:51:02.205 - 00:51:09.045, Speaker B: But I think that it can absolutely scale. It's just a question of price. Right.
00:51:09.705 - 00:51:13.457, Speaker A: So it's more like show me the incentives and I bring you the solver.
00:51:13.641 - 00:51:17.685, Speaker B: There you go. Totally though. I love that. I think that's exactly right.
00:51:18.025 - 00:51:32.047, Speaker A: Okay, awesome. So maybe we can touch upon the other design as well. Right. Like than intense. There's one model that kind of scales to all of these chains because they can just mint assets on the other side. And that's the multichain token frameworks. Right.
00:51:32.047 - 00:51:51.075, Speaker A: So like wormhole has entity layer 0 has of these and Stargate is using this for their design. I know you have concerns about this design, but do you think that's, do you actually fair that some of this new chain order flow will be dominated by these designs?
00:51:51.815 - 00:52:52.965, Speaker B: Okay, so I think it's really interesting. I don't like these lock and mint designs or burn and mint designs because as a user holding one of these tokens, you have perpetual risk to the security of the bridge. Right. And you know we'll take layer 0's of T because that's like my chief rival in the space and so oft design. Okay, I can. And you know it's interesting and Angus on your podcast a couple episodes ago, which I thought was quite good, was pretty transparent about this, like layer zero started and they were really against lock and mint or burn and mint assets because of this same concern that, that I still have, which is you have perpetual risk to the protocol. If anything goes wrong, a user who thinks they're holding this asset worth something, just poof, it's worthless.
00:52:52.965 - 00:53:33.155, Speaker B: And so I think that's a really scary security assumption to put on users where you're trusting this Bridgeport protocol in perpetuity to not have there be an unlimited mint event on your asset. And yes, these protocols are trying to put in like rate limiting and trying to limit this like contained damage. But like we don't know if the, in the worst case you don't know if the rate limiting works. You don't know all this stuff. It's just still kind of scary. So I don't like that as a security property for many of these tokens. I think that if you're doing it on a long tail token, maybe it's fine.
00:53:33.155 - 00:54:17.085, Speaker B: Like maybe the trade off is worthwhile. Right? Because you just want, you don't have the ability to incentivize inventory in an intent based system on your long tail token on every chain. And so maybe you have no other option and this is the best thing for your protocol. And if that's the case then like great, I think you should do that. That makes sense. But I have two, two other pushes on this. So I think doing this for major assets like Ethereum, Ethereum, so ETH is never going to agree to this for like canonical eth, but that doesn't mean another chain can't say, okay, we'll like let you create sort of synthetic ETH on our Chain, which we can talk about in a second with like maybe some of the hydro stuff.
00:54:17.085 - 00:54:59.905, Speaker B: But generally speaking, I think doing it for canonical assets is really scary because users are holding canonical assets on a chain and they're. They still have perpetual exposure to some other set of security assumptions. So it's fine. And then my other use case is of tease on long tail assets. Where are the use cases where this makes sense? If it's my gaming token that's going to be used on my gaming chain, in my personal opinion, I think the only real place that my gaming token needs to live is on my gaming chain. So I'm not sure I need it to be an OF T. Right.
00:54:59.905 - 00:55:28.507, Speaker B: If I am trying to create a new stable coin that goes everywhere, then yeah, I think having it have liquidity across all these chains like does make sense. And so, you know, Athena, using OF T's to move their token around the place, like that seems like a competitive advantage and a use case where they may want to. To take on the security assumptions, the security risks just for that advantage. So that's kind of my take. It's like, we'll see how it sorts out too.
00:55:28.571 - 00:55:53.645, Speaker A: Okay, so I think I have some thoughts on this. So first, no one can disagree with the risks, right? Like, there is an underlying risk attached to the messaging protocol here. But then like, we're also seeing adoption of these frameworks. Chains are adopting them, teams are adopting them. So it doesn't seem like it's stopping anyone from adopting these frameworks. So like, do you have thoughts on that?
00:55:55.025 - 00:56:22.755, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, the use cases where they're getting adopted, I think generally speaking are the ones that make sense to me. So I want to create a new stablecoin and I want to move it to different places. That makes sense. Some of the LRT use cases also make sense, right. Where I'm trying to have a token that I want to be able to source liquidity from any chain. So I want my LRT to kind of be everywhere. Right? Sure.
00:56:22.755 - 00:56:43.605, Speaker B: But like, I don't know, I still, this is just where I'm like, I play forward. Where are the use cases where having your chain be on many chains makes the most sense? Like the uni token as just an example. It doesn't need to be on every chain. There's no real point to it there.
00:56:44.625 - 00:57:13.693, Speaker A: I've been thinking about this because I'm writing a comparison framework piece. So what I came down to was basically letting anyone speculate on that asset on any chain. I feel like after a point a Token becomes big enough that there is a market for that token on any chain. So let's say with the Meme Coin is an ofd. Now, earlier it was on Solana. So if I wanted to speculate on vif, I would have to move my funds to Solana to actually buy it. Right.
00:57:13.693 - 00:57:21.613, Speaker A: But the fact that I can now do it on base, there is a use case, right. Like I can now buy it on any chain and then speculate on the price, maybe.
00:57:21.749 - 00:57:53.831, Speaker B: But then I look at this as if you play the world forward and you're like, okay, think about the remote control thing here. I have assets someplace. I've got assets on Solana or I've got assets on base, where it is. And I want to speculate on Whiff. Well, what do I actually want to do? I just want to buy Whiff. And so if there is a framework that lets me buy Whiff where I can pay for it from anywhere and buy it on the place that's most liquid, great. I own with like wif, you need to be able to buy it from anywhere.
00:57:53.831 - 00:58:44.745, Speaker B: I fully agree with that. But does Whiff need to exist everywhere? I mean, no, there's absolutely, like, particularly for a Meme Coin, there's absolutely no need for it to actually exist anywhere. So if you play forward, the intense centric framework and like Uniswap X is a great example of this. Right. And what 1 inch fusion is doing in Cow swap, like, if you think about the leading trading protocols, they'd just be like, okay, well, pay for it from anywhere and have the solvers compete to fill you at the best possible price and deliver it to you on the chain where it lives. And so I agree with your speculation kind of use case, but I'm not sure that the asset you're speculating on, I think it actually might be a real disadvantage to have it be across all these chains versus on the chain it's native to.
00:58:45.925 - 00:58:57.865, Speaker A: I think that's a beautiful part about this. Right. Like, you can do it both ways and it's just like there are pros and cons to both designs. But yeah, I personally like that there are different school of thought.
00:58:58.495 - 00:59:21.871, Speaker B: Exactly. And like, this is what the beautiful thing about our space is. We'll see what plays out. And just to sort of like summarize your view on that, it's like, okay, so Whiff takes on a pretty scary set of security risks around this like, unlimited mint thing. To be able to say again, rate limited. Rate limited. Yeah, exactly.
00:59:21.871 - 00:59:58.777, Speaker B: Like, we'll see, right? I Hope like you hope nothing goes wrong. And to be clear, over time all this stuff will get more and more robust. Like I completely do believe that. Right. But is that a better setup than having like an intent centric framework where I could speculate on whiff anywhere and I just own it on the chain that it's native to with no security assumptions on like the bridging protocol that WIF is like secured by. To me, I prefer the second world. Right.
00:59:58.777 - 00:59:59.953, Speaker B: We'll see where this goes. Right?
01:00:00.009 - 01:00:17.931, Speaker A: No, I think it makes sense. And it's also just like less thinking on the user's part. Right. Like in the other model we're still assuming that the user knows vif exists on 5, 10 chains. Right. But then in the intense model it's just like, okay, he wants to buy VIF will get you with on whatever chain it is. Right.
01:00:17.931 - 01:00:22.375, Speaker A: So that's still more powerful as a broader messaging theme.
01:00:22.795 - 01:00:27.179, Speaker B: Yeah, totally. And again, we'll see where that all goes. Right?
01:00:27.307 - 01:00:27.667, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:00:27.731 - 01:01:10.865, Speaker B: So, and again, I want to go back to like the speed thing here too. Right. So it's, it's like in any of the, of the kind of, of T type standards you still have to wait for a sense of finality when you're sending these messages. So you can't. And a lot of, there's, there's sort of assumptions being made here too. Like you're not even waiting for anywhere close to full finality at the protocol level. So you really still are going to have 30 second type delays on many of these like cross chain transactions.
01:01:10.865 - 01:01:35.265, Speaker B: And the intent model, we're going to get it down to two seconds. We're already basically there. We're like. Our median time is I think four seconds. So I don't know, I kind of think there's like a better user experience with less security trade offs. That's simpler to reason about it seems like, I mean I'm incredibly biased, this is what I do all day. But I think the architecture makes a lot of sense.
01:01:36.005 - 01:01:47.145, Speaker A: I think, I love the fact that there are different school of thoughts. So we'll leave it at that. Right. Because I feel like I can almost hear the other teams reply in my head and I don't want to say it from their side so we can have a different conversation later.
01:01:48.005 - 01:02:12.195, Speaker B: We'll get the other reply on Twitter and I think it'd be cool to us to actually have an honest reply, an honest conversation around the real trade offs here too because agree pros and cons here, but I do think we should try to look objectively at like what are the risks, what are the advantages? And not just market what our own approach is.
01:02:12.655 - 01:02:38.775, Speaker A: Okay, awesome. So like, I really appreciate the honesty. Like a lot of people would not even answer all of these questions, so thank you for taking the time to answer this. Just coming back to across now, I think you mentioned that the fill times are already some seconds, right? Like single digit seconds. How fast do you see this actually getting? Like, I know we had a conversation on Twitter as well where you were like, it has to be milliseconds or something. So is there a world where it's actually milliseconds?
01:02:39.075 - 01:03:34.785, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think the world we're in. So why is across faster than these message based approaches? Right, let's just for the audience go into that. When you want to do a cross chain action in a message based approach, you need to send a message from one chain to the other chain. The destination chain needs to make sure that message won't get reverted because otherwise really bad things happen, you lose LP funds, that kind of stuff. You need to wait for a sense of finality on the origin chain. Otherwise the protocol can't risk LP funds. Like Stargate as an example will use LP funds and they can't pay out LP funds if the origin transaction gets reverted and they just paid somebody money that they shouldn't have.
01:03:34.785 - 01:04:17.495, Speaker B: They gotta wait for a sense of finality Here in the intent based architecture, relayers or solvers actually take on that finality risk. So they are independent actors that are gonna pay users when they think that transaction on the origin chain is final. And if they think that transaction is final, like really, really quickly, they can pay users out basically immediately. Right? The chance of a reorg is very small. So like to sort of Stargate's approach, the chance of there being a reorg on the origin chain is very, very, very small, depending on where you're coming from. But it's not zero. So you can't risk LP funds for a non zero chance of reorg.
01:04:17.495 - 01:04:48.935, Speaker B: Right? Whereas a solver can be like, okay, I'm competing against this other solver. If I'm slow, I'm going to lose. I'm earning fees on this. My chance of A reorg is 99.99999%. Not going to happen. Right? So I can take a risk here knowing that there's a very small probability I might lose money on this, but in the long run I'm safe. And so the intent based architecture, by transferring the reorg risk to the solver, we're able to do things a lot faster.
01:04:48.935 - 01:05:24.221, Speaker B: So how fast can we go? I mean I think we can have next block fill times depending on the origin chain and the reorg risks. Right. So Arbitrum1 has never had a reorg in its existence from what I know. Which means that literally and their block times are 250 milliseconds. Which means that after 250 milliseconds a solvers and across could go and fill users on a destination chain. And it literally could be like a sub 400 millisecond fill type thing. Long winded answer.
01:05:24.221 - 01:05:28.149, Speaker B: But I think it's important to go through like why this is possible too.
01:05:28.197 - 01:05:50.835, Speaker A: Yeah, we have to nerd snipe everyone. Right? Like we can't just say milliseconds. Have to give them all the details. So this is better I think. So the next question I had was around across supporting non EVM chains like Solana and across Solana and Bitcoin. I feel like we kind of answered it, but explicitly. If we could kind of address that, that'd be good as well.
01:05:51.615 - 01:06:11.209, Speaker B: I'm not going to comment on Solana right now. It's definitely something we're looking at. Right. And like I like Solana. I've actually always been a fan. So you know, I started on Ethereum but I'm not like an eth maxi. I think Solana is super cool on the bitcoin stuff.
01:06:11.209 - 01:06:42.795, Speaker B: I'm really curious. I think it's really cool but frankly like I'm just waiting. I think it's in across his best interest to sort of see a little bit how it shakes out. Like get past the hype cycle a little bit and be like, okay, is there any usage here and what's the right kind of entry point? I think it'd be really cool, but we're not currently building anything there. If any of your users want to show me on here's how across should support Bitcoin L2s. Like I'm totally game. I'd love to hear people's thoughts.
01:06:43.095 - 01:06:50.515, Speaker A: Awesome. So just to wrap up this across specific section, how does across win the bridge wars or the interop wars?
01:06:50.815 - 01:07:08.095, Speaker B: Just best experience, man. That's all we do like and best experience. So to my in my opinion, it's fastest and pretty cheap. Right. And I think we can be cheapest too. There's a whole other conversation on that too, but best experience for the user.
01:07:08.835 - 01:07:24.259, Speaker A: Awesome. Thanks a lot for answering all of these questions and I really appreciate the honesty. Yeah. And just like getting into Some of the personal stuff now, because I also want to know you. You much better. So you. You recently did, like, a whole series on.
01:07:24.259 - 01:07:37.175, Speaker A: On the Bell Curve, Right? So how was that experience? Because, like, now you feel natural. You just feel like, okay, you're calm, you're composed. That could just be your experience as well. But, like, I want to know, how was your experience hosting a podcast?
01:07:38.235 - 01:08:02.579, Speaker B: Well, co hosting. I mean, Mike Appolito did. Did all the hard work, to be clear. And yeah, for your audience, like, go and listen to eat. Mike suggested to me doing this, like, this season on the multichain end game on Bell Curve, and I learned a lot. And Arjun, man, I like our space. I like just thinking through fun ideas with people.
01:08:02.579 - 01:08:17.483, Speaker B: This is just the most fun thing to do. And yeah, there's no disadvantage to being honest. It's like we're trying to. All our. Our space is so damn competitive. Right? Like, there's no. There's no alpha in, like, hiding thoughts.
01:08:17.483 - 01:08:26.387, Speaker B: Just, like, put it out there and be like, here's what I think. And smart people on Twitter are going to tell you when you're wrong, and then you can listen to them or not. Right. Learn more that way.
01:08:26.571 - 01:08:33.055, Speaker A: Yeah, I think I really enjoyed that, like, whole series. I felt like I learned a lot. So thank you for doing that as well.
01:08:33.475 - 01:08:58.561, Speaker B: Of course. Of course, man. We should do more. Like, I'm glad you're doing your podcast here. I think, like, you've gone feel like you've spent, you know, you're like early 20s just learning nerding out about Interop in, like, an extreme way. And, you know, we're moving forward. The design space, it is like a very organic, build it together type thing where ideas.
01:08:58.561 - 01:09:05.305, Speaker B: It's like a war of ideas and execution, and the best ideas are going to win. So I think it's super cool. Cool.
01:09:06.005 - 01:09:10.545, Speaker A: And like, outside of Crypto, how do you like to spend your weekends and, like, what are your hobbies?
01:09:11.245 - 01:09:12.985, Speaker B: I do a lot of outdoorsy stuff.
01:09:14.085 - 01:09:15.853, Speaker A: We see the pictures on Twitter.
01:09:15.989 - 01:09:46.032, Speaker B: Yeah, well, I have to do the whole dad joke with, like, the intense meme. I got pictures of me intense, and it's like, it's such a bad dad joke, but I love posting pictures of me sleeping int. Um, so, yeah, I. I like to do a lot of outdoorsy stuff. Backcountry skiing and do some. Done some ice climbing with David Hoffman, which still scares the shit of me, and backpacking and that kind of stuff. So I like that.
01:09:46.032 - 01:09:50.232, Speaker B: And then, you know, friends and family. Um, so it's the stuff I enjoy.
01:09:50.408 - 01:09:57.324, Speaker A: What's like your viewer dosed experience on one of those hikes, because those can get intense and pretty weird pretty quickly. Right.
01:09:58.885 - 01:10:16.677, Speaker B: Um, you know, all my. All my outdoor stuff has been pretty good. Um, like, we. I biked past some bears two years ago. It was kind of wild, actually. Was it last year? Yeah, that was. That was kind of fun.
01:10:16.677 - 01:10:34.095, Speaker B: Um, one hike where, like, it was September. It was literally like two year. Two years ago today, right around now, and should have been warm, but it started snowing and hailing and I wasn't exactly prepared for that. So. Yeah, I don't know. Fun stuff.
01:10:34.995 - 01:10:44.655, Speaker A: Awesome. So, like, other than running two crypto companies, you're also an investor with Robot Ventures. Right? So how is that? Like, how do you find time? Question number one.
01:10:45.635 - 01:11:21.493, Speaker B: Yeah. So the robot stuff, I should probably backpedal on a little bit. Like, I love those guys, but honestly, I'm not spending enough time doing that. So if anyone's listening, I'm not really a angel investor right now. The investing thing, I do think it's really interesting listening to seed stage pitches and what people are building in the space too, and just understanding directions of where the ecosystem is going. I remain super bullish. Super, super bullish on our industry.
01:11:21.493 - 01:11:44.655, Speaker B: Like, how it all shakes out, we don't know, but crypto is a big deal. It's a big deal concept. One of the things I like to say is the bear case for crypto is that we reinvent financial services, and the bull case is a lot more. Right. So I don't know. I like hearing about what people are building and what people are. Are thinking about.
01:11:45.395 - 01:12:03.255, Speaker A: I think that's the perfect note to just end this conversation on, like, we're all bullish, bullish on crypto. And I'm glad you're building an interop. Like I said earlier, across is one of the best teams. And I'm actually really glad that you guys are pushing the industry forward. Right. And it's a lot of fun just working alongside you in that way.
01:12:03.555 - 01:12:18.535, Speaker B: Likewise, man. We love working with you and your team and appreciate you guys hosting this podcast. Appreciate all the work you do on studying the space and for trying to champion fruitful conversation between the different approaches. I think that's super valuable.
01:12:18.955 - 01:12:19.243, Speaker A: So.
01:12:19.259 - 01:12:20.795, Speaker B: Yeah. Thanks, Arjun. Thanks for having me.
01:12:20.955 - 01:12:22.675, Speaker A: Awesome. Thanks a lot. Thanks for your time.
