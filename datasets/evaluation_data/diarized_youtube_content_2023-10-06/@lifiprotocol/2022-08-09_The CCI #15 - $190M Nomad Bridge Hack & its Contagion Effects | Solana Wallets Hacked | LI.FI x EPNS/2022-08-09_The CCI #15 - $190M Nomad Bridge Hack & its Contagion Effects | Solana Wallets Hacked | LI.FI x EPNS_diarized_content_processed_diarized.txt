00:00:12.240 - 00:00:31.045, Speaker A: Hey, everyone. Welcome to this week's episode of the Cross Chain Insider, a weekly roundup of all news traveling across chains, brought to you by le. I'm Mark, member of the Biz dev team at Lei and a hoodie enthusiast. My gigabrain co host is Arjun, the jack of all trades and master of everything here at lei. What is up, Arjun?
00:00:31.505 - 00:00:32.645, Speaker B: Not Nomad.
00:00:34.145 - 00:01:02.465, Speaker A: That was. Yep. Okay, so this is the August 8th recording of the Cross Chain Insider. As usual, Arjun published this all the news in this podcast via a newsletter, which you can see on the screen. We always come and podcast about the big news later in the day after he publishes it. But if you want this delivered directly to your email address, go to lifi.substack.com to subscribe.
00:01:02.465 - 00:01:09.825, Speaker A: And as usual, Arjun starts off with bridging updates. Arjun, what happened in the last week or so?
00:01:10.165 - 00:01:48.083, Speaker B: I have to say this was like a very bad week for crypto in general. Like, every morning I woke up and there was something bad. And by morning I mean like 4am so that's bad in another sense. But okay, so let's start with Nomad Bridge. So Nomad Bridge was hacked on August 2nd for 190 million, and this became like the fifth largest exploit in the history of Defi. So out of the top five hacks in DeFi, four are now bridges, and Nomad is now, I think, fourth or fifth on the list. So this exploit occurred because of an implementation error during a routine upgrade.
00:01:48.083 - 00:02:16.729, Speaker B: And during this upgrade, the nomad team marked 0hash as a valid root. And this allowed hackers to spoof messages on Nomad and drain all the funds. So basically any message that you put in it would give out like an error result. So people would go in, put in 0.01 wrapped BTC, and they would get 100 ETH in return. And a lot of people, like, did this. Thankfully, some of those were white hat hackers.
00:02:16.729 - 00:02:47.235, Speaker B: And the Nomad team has been able to recover 32 million of these lost funds from 86 different wallets. So at least there's some. Something good that came out was like some funds were recovered, but of course, 190 million is a lot. And there was just a lot of damage all across the board to Nomad, to the ecosystem. It connects to Connex as well, because it's like a very close partner. Not such a great start to the peak. Do you have anything to add in?
00:02:47.975 - 00:03:11.927, Speaker A: Nope. Oh, I'll add one thing. It's just that this is another one of those Bridge hacks where, like, the Actual bridge wasn't really affected like the actual design. Of course the bridge was affected because the funds were drained. But like, you know, Nomad uses an optimistic design to validate transactions. And that was not the issue here. It was a smart contract upgrade.
00:03:11.927 - 00:03:13.981, Speaker A: But we'll talk about that later on.
00:03:14.133 - 00:03:18.185, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, there's an entire blog post about it already.
00:03:18.925 - 00:03:19.213, Speaker A: So.
00:03:19.229 - 00:03:55.827, Speaker B: Yeah, so let's move on to seabridge. So seabridge, like I think every time we talk about seabridge, they've always added support for a new blockchain and it's this time that blockchain is Clayton. So users can now bridge usdt, USDC wrapped eth, wrapped Bitcoin and die between Ethereum and K by Seabridge. So good to see seabridge always connecting to all the ecosystems out there. Up next we have Ren. And Ren has integrated kava. So Ren now supports direct bridging to and from KAA for every asset that REN has in its support.
00:03:55.827 - 00:04:44.805, Speaker B: So assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum and USDC can now be bridged between REN supported blockchains and kaava. Next news is like, so this was kind of big, right? But this didn't really make the headlines because of the sort of week we had. So a white hat hacker and this guy has been doing this for like a while. I think he was, he, he, he, he had a major role to play in like another white hat bounty related to a bridge. So he found two critical bugs in the Intell BTC bridge and all. Thankfully all issues have been fixed and no funds were lost. So he conveyed the same to immunify all the issues were fixed and he received a handsome $200,000 payout for his work.
00:04:45.305 - 00:04:52.001, Speaker A: I'm gonna be honest, I did not see this last week. I was so caught up with Nomad stuff.
00:04:52.073 - 00:05:39.565, Speaker B: So yeah, this was, to be fair, this was like before the hack. But yeah, just the entire week felt so weird that this news was not, not even posted anywhere. Last we have LE channel is now available on epns so users can get mobile notifications for bridging with le. So this is a move from us to establish like better communications with communication with our users. So every time that you have a transaction, ongoing transaction on Transfer2XYZ, which is our B2C interface, you can now start receiving notifications on the status of these transactions. So to get these notifications you can go to the EPNS website, search for the LIFI channel and click opt in. It's that simple.
00:05:40.145 - 00:05:44.601, Speaker A: This is huge because sometimes when you bridge, it can take between Two.
00:05:44.793 - 00:05:45.721, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:05:45.913 - 00:06:07.799, Speaker A: Sometimes it's like an hour depending on the state of the chain. Right. And so being able to do the transaction and then maybe go hang out on other places on the Internet and just get a notification if it goes through or even if it like fails. Right. Like you can then go back and change it. So I think this is a huge user upgrade. User experience upgrade.
00:06:07.927 - 00:06:21.223, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. Because like most of the time I'm not on the same screen when I've bridged. Right. Like I bridge and then I move on to something else. Just wait for it and hope that everything works. This is great because this can just tell you, okay, it didn't work. Do it again.
00:06:21.223 - 00:06:23.205, Speaker B: Or like your funds are there.
00:06:23.745 - 00:06:40.073, Speaker A: But like I just remember the first like five times I bridged, I would just be staring at the screen just like waiting for it to go. Or like the first time you send a bitcoin transaction. Right. And you're waiting that 10 minute period and all you're doing is you're checking, you're checking your wallet like, oh my gosh, is it going to come through? Is it going to come through?
00:06:40.129 - 00:06:53.275, Speaker B: So every time, like in the beginning when I was bridging through Li, so they have, we have all these steps. Right. And like I always thought this was very fascinating. So I was just like, look at the clock running down.
00:06:53.895 - 00:07:04.815, Speaker A: Yep. But now you don't have to do that. Now you can just get a notification right on your desktop or I think I have a mobile app now too. And so anytime a transaction goes through, boom, sends it to you.
00:07:04.895 - 00:07:06.035, Speaker B: Super convenient.
00:07:06.455 - 00:07:19.485, Speaker A: Super convenient. Okay, so that is the bridging updates for the week, which, you know, it was kind of a, it was not a quiet week because of Nomad hack, but outside of that it was kind of a slower week from the news.
00:07:19.565 - 00:07:26.745, Speaker B: I mean, I think even if any bridge would have like a big announcement or big news, they would have held it back.
00:07:27.405 - 00:08:12.263, Speaker A: Yep. And so as always, the next section is about multi chain ecosystem. See if I can choose the correct tab here. Yep. So there was a vulnerability in a the slope Solana wallet that resulted in a mass release of private keys that affected over 8,000 wallets and led to $5 million in tokens being lost. You know, the moral of this story in my opinion is first of all, probably use an open source wallet if you can. Open source wallets make it much easier to, if there's next point going on, you can find out what's happening faster.
00:08:12.263 - 00:08:40.115, Speaker A: And then number two, what I learned from this is don't Believe everything you read on Twitter. When this hack was initially going down, people thought that every single person's wallet on Solana was being hacked and that Phantom and Metamask could be affected. In the end, it turned out, you know, $5 million is still a big loss. 8,000 wallets is a large number, but in the grand scheme of things, it's not a huge issue.
00:08:41.495 - 00:08:49.127, Speaker B: I mean, so the thing is, like, it's a trust issue now. So Solana has to regain the trust of its users.
00:08:49.311 - 00:09:15.601, Speaker A: Like, okay, I disagree with that because this was just, in my opinion, a third party wallet. Like, literally they were, they, they. I won't get too technical, but they pretty much just posted the private keys, like the 12 word freaking seed phrase onto their servers where anyone could just go and take it. So to me, Solana has nothing to do with this. I mean, what could that.
00:09:15.793 - 00:09:41.935, Speaker B: But that's something that you and I understand now after like two, three days of investigation for a regular user who is just told by his friend that, okay, don't put your assets on the exchange, just put it in your wallet. And then he was like woken up to a call by him to remove his assets of the address because 8,000 wallets have been drained. This is not great. Right. So he probably won't come back now.
00:09:43.635 - 00:09:47.699, Speaker A: You're right. But I just don't. I saw a lot of people putting this on Solana, right?
00:09:47.747 - 00:10:22.461, Speaker B: No, that's wrong. That's wrong. But like, it just, like, because of how everyone reacted initially, like, just remove your assets from any wallet that you have. It was a very weird experience for me as well, personally, because I was like, okay, what's happening? Like, how can a blockchain like Solana be attacked? But eventually you realize, okay, it's not on Solana. Like, I would still go back and use Solana, but normal users who don't really care that much, who were just like storing some assets on the wallet, like online wallet, they would probably not return.
00:10:22.653 - 00:10:34.385, Speaker A: Yeah, luckily for me, I had like, you know, $7 left on Stelana because I bought so many NFTs back in the day. And all the NFTs are illiquid as I'll get out. So I was, I wasn't too worried.
00:10:34.545 - 00:10:44.525, Speaker B: This was the first time I like, opened my Phantom wallet in three months and I checked my NFTs and I was like, not, not worth it.
00:10:45.265 - 00:11:18.143, Speaker A: I put half the hacker could have, like, the hacker could have drained them and been like, oh, gosh, no, I don't want these. Take them back. Take them Back. Take them back. Okay, next up, we have a proposal from aave's team. Not aave's team, but I think it's from Mark Zeller, who is the head of developer relations at AAVE. They want to freeze the phantom AAVE v3 market, citing risks involved with Bridges and the market's inability to generate sufficient revenue for AAVE Dao.
00:11:18.143 - 00:12:21.325, Speaker A: So this is really, really, really interesting proposal. Essentially the Phantom iteration of aave has about $9 million in TVL. It's generating between $30 and $300 a day for the, for the DAO, which is not that much money. And because the phantom iteration of AAVE is dependent on multichain, which the, the actual proposal comes out and says that it's not multichain's fault that like they, they're proposing to freeze the assets. What they're saying is that if there's even a slight risk, like, like the, like a 0.0000001% chance that multi chain could be exploited, it's not worth having $9 million of TVL on Phantom for $30 to $300 of revenue a day. So that's why they're proposing to freeze the market there.
00:12:21.325 - 00:12:25.137, Speaker A: I believe the voting period starts today.
00:12:25.281 - 00:12:41.569, Speaker B: So people, the question is like the other reason is because of the market not generating sufficient revenue. Right. So what if this was like 90 million in TVL and 30k profit a day or like 3k profit a day, Will it be worth it then?
00:12:41.697 - 00:13:14.943, Speaker A: I would love to see their like a risk reward metric there. Because the question then becomes, right, if you're saying, okay, the risk reward isn't there at $9 million in TVL, but okay, let's say it goes up to $900 million in TVL, the risk then gets way higher because there's a lot more money at stake. Right. So it's kind of an interesting proposal. Maybe this means that AAVE is thinking deployments on a lot of chains is too risky and we won't see them.
00:13:15.119 - 00:13:26.115, Speaker B: Expanding as much again. Cross chain versus multi chain debate. So they, they might expand to all the rollups and not all the EVM chains or like other chains.
00:13:26.535 - 00:13:27.271, Speaker A: Yep. So.
00:13:27.303 - 00:13:32.195, Speaker B: But yeah, I would be very excited to see the risk reward kind of.
00:13:32.495 - 00:13:46.117, Speaker A: This is fascinating. This is probably like the Nomad hack is like the biggest news of the week, but this is the most interesting piece of news. Like this could have fascinating ripple effects.
00:13:46.221 - 00:13:47.077, Speaker B: All of these.
00:13:47.221 - 00:13:49.905, Speaker A: I didn't mean to say ripple. That's not bad.
00:13:50.365 - 00:13:55.065, Speaker B: All of these updates don't really make it to the big time news.
00:13:55.845 - 00:13:58.545, Speaker A: Yeah, but this should, this is crazy.
00:13:58.845 - 00:14:14.285, Speaker B: It's interesting for both of us and whoever is like listening to this right now, but definitely not for the masses. Like the Nomad hack, I started seeing posts on LinkedIn and that's when you know it's like, it's bad LinkedIn.
00:14:15.345 - 00:14:37.507, Speaker A: Okay, next. Oh, this is, this is big news for me at least. Magic Eden, the premier NFT marketplace on Solana, announced that it will add and integrate Ethereum NFTs onto the platform. I am, I think we're both like magic Eden OGs. I think I was trading on there like the second day it launched. I love magic.
00:14:37.571 - 00:14:41.935, Speaker B: You're definitely an OG. I'm not. I was there. I was there.
00:14:43.755 - 00:15:08.355, Speaker A: So they're calling it Magic Ethan. This is like massive. Just because, like if you look at Magic Eden's numbers on Salana, it is like so obviously number one. So, so for them to add Ethereum support everyone who's been using Magic Eden just, just, just because it's the easiest place to buy an nft, in my opinion, which now gonna. We're gonna onboard people to Ethereum. I think it's awesome.
00:15:08.655 - 00:15:18.079, Speaker B: What's the state of like other NFT marketplaces and Solana? Because like personally, Magic Eden is the second platform I used. The first one was Solana Art.
00:15:18.207 - 00:15:22.155, Speaker A: Solana Art still going? I don't think Digital Eyes is going.
00:15:23.655 - 00:15:25.635, Speaker B: Are they also expanding to Ethereum?
00:15:26.335 - 00:15:27.235, Speaker A: They are.
00:15:27.855 - 00:15:29.023, Speaker B: I'm asking.
00:15:29.199 - 00:15:59.665, Speaker A: Oh, I don't think so. I think Magic Eden's the first one. So this is, I'm super excited about this and we'll see like opensea, when they expanded to Solana, there's still an Ethereum based, in my opinion, Ethereum and Polygon based NFT Marketplace. I'm kind of thinking it might be the same for Magic Eden where it's like they already have. All, all of these people are Solana native. I don't know how much demand the average Magic Eden.
00:16:00.525 - 00:16:13.625, Speaker B: It'll still be bigger than Ethereum on OpenC because Solana users are also somewhere Ethereum users. So they're both like, there's a bigger segment of like common people.
00:16:14.205 - 00:16:33.645, Speaker A: You're, you're right. I, I can't wait to. I think, I think Magic Eden's team is like awesome. Should definitely follow their Twitter account. They're degenerates. So I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm excited about this. Next we have Coinbase prime, an integrated solution for sophisticated investors and institutions.
00:16:33.645 - 00:17:05.209, Speaker A: Now offers ETH staking to institutions in the U.S. clients can now generate yield by staking ETH using the firm's cold storage vaults. Now that is big news. Arjun, you actually missed the biggest Coinbase news from last week, but I'll add it here. But blackrock is teaming up with Coinbase, so the partnership will help clients oversee bitcoin exposure. Now, BlackRock, massive. I'm pretty sure they're the biggest asset manager in the world.
00:17:05.209 - 00:17:18.054, Speaker A: They're now partnering up with Coinbase to allow institutions crypto exposure. They're starting with bitcoin. They said they might expand to other stuff. This is crazy. Like the blackrock stuff. Oh, my gosh.
00:17:19.474 - 00:17:20.534, Speaker B: Big numbers.
00:17:22.074 - 00:17:47.107, Speaker A: Big numbers. And we're recording this on Monday. Both Coinbase and Bitcoin are up on the news, so we'll see. I'll be looking forward to see what they expand to when they go to more offerings. I would assume Eth would be next, but what's after that? I don't know. Next we have Chainlink. It is now live on Metis.
00:17:47.107 - 00:18:05.459, Speaker A: Is it Metis or Metis? I think it's Metis. It's Metis, yeah. It's one of those words I've always read, but I've never had to say it out loud before this podcast. So Metis has integrated chainlink price feeds. This is big news. Chainlink just keeps shipping. Metis keeps shipping.
00:18:05.459 - 00:18:09.575, Speaker A: You see chainlink on almost every chain now. Metis is hot.
00:18:09.915 - 00:18:12.255, Speaker B: Chainlink is industry standard now.
00:18:12.635 - 00:18:33.475, Speaker A: Yeah, it is. And I think that our compadre Fragile Shark would say that Metis is hot right now. And so at least one of the lefi team members is a big fan of Metis. Big fan. Big fan. Next we have. Oh, as normal.
00:18:33.475 - 00:18:53.743, Speaker A: Like when we say people are shipping Brave, Always be shipping. Brave browser integrated Aurora into its wallet. Aurora is now a preloaded chain for Brave wallet users. Brave is just. They're there to make it an easy experience for users. And so Aurora being integrated, it's just another step towards that.
00:18:53.919 - 00:18:56.435, Speaker B: I haven't used Brave invite.
00:18:57.335 - 00:19:04.675, Speaker A: Really? Gosh, you're a fake fan. I'm using Brave right now.
00:19:05.345 - 00:19:06.369, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay.
00:19:06.537 - 00:19:12.165, Speaker A: Yeah, look at that right here. I'm on Brave. Okay. Next.
00:19:12.625 - 00:19:19.961, Speaker B: Even I can say I'm using Brave right now. I can say that. You can confirm it.
00:19:20.073 - 00:19:26.217, Speaker A: That's a good point. That's a good point. Okay, so, Arjun, what is poppin on Twitter?
00:19:26.401 - 00:20:30.479, Speaker B: Yeah, so say the Nomad story, but something that's not really covered in the Nomad story. So everyone is talking about the 190 million that was drained from Nomad, but I have basically written that whenever there's a bridge hack, it's much worse than just the hack because of the contagion effects that exist. This is because, just because of the nature of how bridges operate in general, they connect different ecosystems. Let's say, for example, EVMOS has Nomad as its go to bridge, right? So Nomad is basically responsible for minting all the assets that are not natively available on evmos. So if you have USDC that's bridged from Ethereum to evmos, it'll be Nomad's representation of USDC and not the actual asset. So this helps in bootstrapping liquidity, but this also creates a counterparty risk. And whenever there's like a bridge hack, this counterparty risk gets exposed.
00:20:30.479 - 00:21:11.500, Speaker B: And this is exactly what happened in Nomad's case. So this basically happens because the original asset on the source chain gets drained, right? So there's nothing backing the representation of the asset on the destination chain. And as a result people panic that assets are valued less now. So they start bridging away from all of these chains. And in Nomad's case, it was connecting to Moonbeam, Milkomeda and evmos. And these chains saw massive amounts of funds being bridged away on the day of the hack. Basically almost all of them were down 15 to 40% in TVL.
00:21:11.500 - 00:21:42.641, Speaker B: And since then the damage has worsened to 50% and 76.7%. In the case of EVMOS, I think Moonbeam was like really hard hit in terms of the absolute amount. So there was like 125.5 million in TVL that was bridged away in like five days. Can you imagine? In five days, 62.5% which accounted for 125.5 million in assets were bridged away from the chain.
00:21:42.641 - 00:22:37.465, Speaker B: So it's like the bridge hack was bad, but these chains, because of the counterparty risk, they had to suffer like massive, massive TVL being bridged away from their chain. And in a way they have to start again now, right from scratch, basically just like the Nomad team would have to. But yeah, I think when we talk about bridge security, contagion effects and counterparty risks are not something that are always talked about. But the trend these days for change is to have all these go to bridge providers and that just creates like massive reliance on one another. So I think it's this was, I wrote this in my closing thoughts as well. We need to reflect on all the bridge hacks and build secure bridges theoretically and also practically, which is like implementation based. So Theoretically, Nomad was like an optimistic bridge, which.
00:22:37.465 - 00:22:59.105, Speaker B: Which we considered one of the safer or, like, secure bridge designs. But practically on an implementation level, there were errors and they were exposed. And because of that, the Nomad team had to suffer. And all these chains also had to suffer. And all the applications on these chains. Imagine there are just so many layers of damage.
00:23:01.645 - 00:23:14.825, Speaker A: Yeah. And I just wanted to shout out the Nomad team, like, we're thinking of y'all. We don't. We're not. Like, we don't want. Don't take this as us bashing you guys. Like, we think y'all built an awesome bridge.
00:23:14.825 - 00:23:21.365, Speaker A: Like, the optimistic design that y'all have kind of pioneered. We're big fans of and we're thinking of Yalls team during this time.
00:23:21.705 - 00:23:35.515, Speaker B: I mean, if you think we're bashing on it, just check out our Friday blog, which was exactly the opposite. So, like, those were our first thoughts. But this is also important to, like, you have to cover the other side of the story, which is true.
00:23:35.675 - 00:23:45.963, Speaker A: Yep. For sure. The contagion is certainly something that needs to be discussed, which I haven't really seen anything on Twitter, so you should. I'll definitely retweet your thread once it gets posted.
00:23:46.099 - 00:23:46.975, Speaker B: I've already.
00:23:47.355 - 00:23:51.619, Speaker A: Oh, you already tweeted it. Sorry, I've been. I've been, like, working this morning. I haven't been on Twitter.
00:23:51.747 - 00:23:53.735, Speaker B: You've been sleeping. It's fine.
00:23:54.325 - 00:24:04.065, Speaker A: That's. That's a good point too. Our time. Time zones are a little off. Next, we have interesting reads. Arjun, kick us off.
00:24:05.325 - 00:24:26.707, Speaker B: Yeah. So we mentioned this earlier as well. We wrote a blog post about the future of bridging and how it might still be optimistic even. Even though there was a hack this week. But importantly, the hack had nothing to do with the design. It was an implementation error. So this blog basically talks about some of the design advantages of optimistic bridges.
00:24:26.707 - 00:24:58.481, Speaker B: And then it covers like, five different bridges that are using this design currently. And I've put Rainbow Bridge at the top because it's the only bridge right now which has managed to avoid an attack successfully. So definitely leading from the front. And I think it's an interesting read for anyone interested in optimistic design. Anyone interested in bridges. Actually, the next one, there's a. There's an article on crypto bridges.
00:24:58.481 - 00:25:16.537, Speaker B: So this one basically talks about the dilemma of on chain middlemen. And this one has, like, really. This one. This article actually has hot takes. Right. So if you see. If you go to the quick takeaway section, like, there are some things that stand out for me.
00:25:16.537 - 00:25:40.645, Speaker B: So one of it was the future might just be. Sorry. Vitalik's vision of a multi chain future instead of a cross chain one will most likely be right. And then he said institutional investors will most likely favor trusted rather than trustless crypto bridges. And I think that's, that's a very interesting point. You have any thoughts on that?
00:25:43.225 - 00:25:51.657, Speaker A: I thought the Vitalik stuff was really good in this thread. I don't really have anything to add. I think, I think you need to read the thread.
00:25:51.801 - 00:26:19.641, Speaker B: Yeah, but the, the one point like that stood out for me was institutional investors will most likely favor trusted rather than trustless crypto bridges because of the dilemma of on middleman. And I think that's a very interesting thought experiment because even though we're like building a decentralized future, but right now the tech isn't there. So institutions don't trust the tech, but they trust the people.
00:26:19.833 - 00:26:21.361, Speaker A: I think that's short term.
00:26:21.513 - 00:26:22.129, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:26:22.257 - 00:26:54.795, Speaker A: I think long term we'll see decentralized solutions win out. I mean, but for now, if we're being honest, like what is the most efficient bridge? Right. It's a centralized exchange. Yeah, right. I mean if you're like, if you're someone, if you're an institution who wants to move hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars, you're going to be doing that through a sex rather than a bridge in my opinion. I could be wrong. But anyways, yeah, one more.
00:26:54.875 - 00:27:17.967, Speaker B: The last one is a complete guide to roll ups. And this is just like a huge write up on rollups. So the tweet said Vitalik gave us an incomplete guide to roll ups. I present the complete guide to roll ups. And he didn't disappoint. So this is everything you can possibly know about roll ups. It's there in this article.
00:27:17.967 - 00:27:22.595, Speaker B: And the best part for me, this is publicly available, no fees for anyone to.
00:27:23.385 - 00:27:45.961, Speaker A: Yep. And before you read this one, you should probably read his deep dive on Ethereum and Celestia. Both of those are like the one on one coursework to be able to understand the roll up section. I'm still parsing through it. I haven't finished it quite yet. It's a long read, but I'm working on.
00:27:46.153 - 00:27:48.057, Speaker B: I think it's worth it.
00:27:48.201 - 00:28:25.425, Speaker A: Oh, it's so good. So many memes. So many memes. Okay, from my end, unrecommended reads or interesting reads. First we have a. The co founder of D Bridge gave the deets on a Lazarus group attack that hit D Bridge where they sent a new Salary adjustments file, which contains some really malicious code that could have absolutely messed up dbridge. And you kind of went through what happened.
00:28:25.425 - 00:28:37.509, Speaker A: Guys don't click links that you haven't from emails, that you have not looked at the full email and certified that, hey, this is actually the person it says it is.
00:28:37.637 - 00:28:48.629, Speaker B: I think the attackers have also hacked human behavior because the file never says, okay, new task. It's always about salary adjustment. Give them hope.
00:28:48.797 - 00:29:14.905, Speaker A: Yep. Yeah, like if I was a hacker, I'd definitely put like airdrop details. What? Click token allocation. Yeah, token allocations. Click and so, yep, that's a good thread. Lastly, we have a chainalysis blog post talking about the vulnerabilities in cross chain bridge protocols. As you can see.
00:29:14.905 - 00:29:37.653, Speaker A: See if this. I guess that doesn't zoom in there. Let me zoom in. Here we go. Bridge hacks are in orange. 2022 has been a brutal year for bridge hacks. Anyways, do you have anything else to add? That's kind of the end of, end of the pod hot take.
00:29:37.709 - 00:29:38.775, Speaker B: What's your hot take?
00:29:38.925 - 00:30:11.651, Speaker A: Oh, what's my hot take? You know, it's not really a hot take. I'm just working on a blog post right now that I'm going to Try to do 42.0 cross chain use cases. Just like, I feel like one of the, like, we talk about security and design all the time, which are like obviously like super, super, super, super, super important topics. But like, I don't think people understand like why you need to bridge assets in the first place. Right. Like, I think it's like, oh, why do I actually need to do this? I'm gonna write a really long article about that.
00:30:11.651 - 00:30:18.775, Speaker A: It's not gonna be that long. It's gonna be like a thousand words, but there's gonna be a lot of bullet points. So I'm excited about that. What do you got?
00:30:19.235 - 00:30:37.213, Speaker B: I'm actually excited about like diving deeper into practical security for bridges. So I think we've covered theoretical knowledge about bridges a lot, but practically even I don't know too much about like, what are the aspects you should look out for. So I think.
00:30:37.269 - 00:30:38.389, Speaker A: What do you mean practically?
00:30:38.517 - 00:31:22.945, Speaker B: Like implementation wise, what are the things that you need to take care of? So multichain. They published a blog post about their like security procedures. So I, I've read that and I'm kind of interested to dive deeper into what other things like, can help out. Like audits are of course there, but what else? Like, what are the security procedures that you can do? And like the other thing I was seeing a lot on Twitter by bridge builders. Was TVL as a metric was kind of very bad for bridges because it's like, it becomes more attractive for a hacker to drain. So that's. That's something that I'll look into deeper.
00:31:22.945 - 00:31:55.455, Speaker B: Do we actually see TVL as a good thing or a bad thing? Oh, but, yeah, I think the thing is, whenever a hack of this proportion happens, like, all the takes are the opposite side of the hack. So whatever Nomad did will be pointed out as bad. And then whatever bridge didn't get hacked, those practices. Practices will be, like, highlighted as, oh, we do this. We. We're better, but we, like, every day, something or the other changes.
00:31:55.495 - 00:31:58.915, Speaker A: And I can think of at least two tweet threads.
00:31:59.775 - 00:32:08.071, Speaker B: I think there were, like, at least 10 not even tweet threads. Like, even tweets. You could see the tone, or just like, oh, this was bad. You should have never done it.
00:32:08.103 - 00:32:10.799, Speaker A: Oh, this was so bad. You should use my bridge.
00:32:10.887 - 00:32:36.553, Speaker B: If you go down and see, like, audit reports or, like, vulnerabilities that were pointed out, you'll see those breaches as well there. Yeah, that's because you were not hacked. You talk so much right now, but then. Yeah, so it's like, I think one week should be, like, left out for anyone to say anything. And then once people start recovering, then you start pointing fingers.
00:32:36.689 - 00:32:42.855, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm with you on that. Okay. I think that's all we have. Do you have anything else to add?
00:32:45.115 - 00:32:47.131, Speaker B: I don't think so, no.
00:32:47.283 - 00:33:02.499, Speaker A: All right, well, that is the latest episode of the Cross Chain Insider.
