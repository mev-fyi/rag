00:00:07.240 - 00:00:24.205, Speaker A: Welcome to another episode of the Insider. Today I'm joined by Vishwa, who's the co founder of Anira Labs. And I'm really excited to have this conversation because he's one of the few rare breeds of like solvers in the ecosystem. So we get to finally ask all of the hot questions for solvers, right? Welcome, Vishwa.
00:00:24.705 - 00:00:40.207, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks for having me, Arjun. Good to collaborate again. I have a bone to pick from our last collaboration which I'll get into during this episode. But yeah, I'd like to introduce myself as probably the only solver with a face and an email id. And so that's like a cross chain one.
00:00:40.391 - 00:00:52.955, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely the only solver that I've talked to until now. So if anyone is looking for a solver, you can always reach out to Vishwa. So Vishwa, let's get started with your story. How did you get started in crypto and what are you building right now?
00:00:53.585 - 00:01:36.635, Speaker B: Yeah, I think this story can go pretty long because my story with like when I got started with crypto is a very old story and it's a very sort of accidental story. I first heard about it or I first called it a scam in 2014, after which I invested it. Invested in it a few months later in 2015 and then 2017, I think I was like a year and a half, two years into my tradfi job and I just saw on my Bloomberg terminal this bitcoin thing is just like exploded in value. And so I went to go and check like how much is it worth in whatever I bought. And it was worth a lot. And so I decided like, okay, I'm doing tradfi stuff, maybe I can do some tradfi things. Crypto as an asset.
00:01:36.635 - 00:02:04.621, Speaker B: And so my first thing was let me do a fund, a fund where I'll find the best funds to invest into and I'll raise capital and I'll invest it into those funds. And so sent out an email ID to all the crypto hedge funds that were featured in some Forbes article. There was 27 of them replied. I quit my job the next day. I took a flight to SF and I started taking meetings with all these guys. A few of them actually even offered me board positions back then. And these are now widely recognized crypto hedge funds in this space that we all know.
00:02:04.621 - 00:02:42.457, Speaker B: But out of interest of confidentiality, I won't really name any of them. I gave a TV interview in India where I thought this was going to be a great stepping stone because all the HNIs in India are going to watch this and they're going to invest because I'm the only one who can offer them this product. And a 40 minute interview became a 10 second headline which said, beware the scam that is Bitcoin and my face flashing on it. And for some context, I come from a family of legal professionals. So my great grandfather was a judge. My grandfather was a judge, my father's a senior counsel, his brother is a lawyer. And we were all watching it together in the living room because they were just like, oh, wow, he's like 22, 23, first TV interview.
00:02:42.457 - 00:02:48.685, Speaker B: And cut to them calling me a scammer. And that was an interesting first experience coming into crypto.
00:02:49.065 - 00:02:51.085, Speaker A: Why were you giving a TV interview?
00:02:51.825 - 00:03:32.931, Speaker B: So actually there was like a huge amount of investor interest at that point where it became clear that there were a few people that were working on crypto in India. A couple of them were setting up exchanges, a couple of them were trying to do like payments. So they were thinking, okay, point of sales for Bitcoin and the Lightning Network and stuff like that. And there was only so many people to speak to about this thing. And so because the price was like, you know, increasing so much, it became something that was being talked about widely in media. And I had a friend of mine who was actually starting a company and he was doing something on the enterprise blockchain side on top of Hyperledger, who recommended that I give this interview to explain the sort of investment thesis behind it. Because he's like, I have one friend in Tradfi who's trying to do something with crypto.
00:03:32.931 - 00:04:00.875, Speaker B: Let me give him this opportunity. And so he gave me this opportunity. And this person came, someone from Z Business came to my office and she spoke to me for 40 minutes, cameraman, everything. And I helped get her set up with Zeb Pay, I think was the wallet in exchange in India at that time. And I told her, I was like, only invest what you're willing to lose. Not more than 1, 2% of your net savings is what you should do right now. And then over time, just treat this as something that you would keep investing into rather than speculate on.
00:04:00.875 - 00:04:45.893, Speaker B: Funnily enough, I spoke about ETFs and all of that stuff back then. And then she just told me like, yeah, we're going to air prime time today, so, you know, just like 9:00. And I thought, this is going to be great because I can use this interview and then use this in my prospectus that I send to other HNIs so I can collect More capital. And then on the other side, I can let the hedge funds know that this is how much committed capital I have and I can start allocating it and become like an LP in all of your funds. And then that sort of got derailed massively. And then India had a massive crackdown and I ended up dropping the idea and becoming employee number one, basically at my friend's startup, which was the enterprise blockchain one where I spent a couple of years working. When you're on the enterprise side, it kind of felt more like a services company than a tech company at some points.
00:04:45.893 - 00:05:06.607, Speaker B: And so ultimately decided to leave. Went and did my masters in the uk. Kind of started my entrepreneurial journey after that. I built a company called Hasil. It was a micro lending company in India, which did really well, really proud of the work we did. Ended up exiting that and then came back to crypto in 2022, I think. Peak of all of the numbers and peak of the bull.
00:05:06.607 - 00:05:35.311, Speaker B: Everybody wanted to figure out what they should do with this asset class. Somehow I stumbled upon this niche of NFTs, Media Entertainment Web3, and a lot of people started coming to me and asking me for advice. And so I decided to do an experiment to see how many people are willing to pay me for their time. And in the first few months, everybody wanted to pay me for the times. So I started a consulting firm. And then after that, some of the consulting, they were just like, okay, we need this built out. And so I used my team that was working with me on the micro lending company to start building out some POCs for these clients.
00:05:35.311 - 00:06:27.337, Speaker B: And one thing led to another. We had a really cool client base in the media and entertainment space. I was giving a talk about NFTs and Web3 at the Cannes Film Festival and was just pretty much in the zeitgeist of that conversation until FTX happened, after which everybody's disposable income and marketing budgets went away and so nobody wanted to do this. The last thing we did do, which was kind of cool, was we did like an NFT activation at the, at the FIFA World cup in, in Qatar with the Qatar Museum Authority. And that's when I sort of like got a sense of where crypto UX is lacking because not a single person that bought those digital collectibles ever had a wallet or ever used any sort of crypto. Native Rails, like all use Crossman credit card Mint. And that's when I was like, okay, this, there's definitely some issues here in terms of the customers that I'm targeting and you know, this mercenary consulting business is not going to work out for too long.
00:06:27.337 - 00:07:23.615, Speaker B: And so I should take some time and figure out what was next. I'm a numbers guy inherently. So I was drawn back to Defi and started researching the UX layer, which is account abstraction is where I started. I think when you start doing account abstractions you kind of naturally end up on intents and when you still stick around with intents, you end up at mev. And one of the main things that Conrad, my co founder and I started to investigate was what is the on chain capital experience and liquidity experience look like in an intent centric world where you can basically enable any source of liquidity to fill any user intent? What does this mean for the market structure of existing liquidity? And we found that it would sort of like come at the cost of existing liquidity provision. And so we wanted to come together to put our minds and see how can we upgrade the liquidity primitive that exists in Defi which has historically been amms to suit this multi chain cross chain world and also to be competitive with increasingly sort of like more and more private liquidity and market maker driven liquidity. And that's kind of what Anira was born out of.
00:07:24.235 - 00:07:55.995, Speaker A: Got it. So like you went from being the scapegoat of India's crypto scam story to NFTs in 2022 and then you went deep into like the intense rabbit hole and that's kind of the cycle, right? Like you get into intense, you figure out, okay, there's this thing called mev, you get deeper into that. But then most people look at searchers, so why did you not become a searcher? And then how did you like figure out, okay, this is not something I want to do. I'm going to start looking at the intent based bridges ecosystem and then kind of build a company around this.
00:07:56.575 - 00:08:38.307, Speaker B: Yeah, great question. I think one of the things I've learned from like being a founder for, you know, the last four or five years across a few different ventures is that oftentimes our first instinct when we think we have a cool idea is that, oh my God, like nobody else is thinking about this. And then if you do enough research, like someone has definitely thought about it. And so that's kind of like the level of honesty that I started having with myself at some point last year where I'm just like, you're not a genius. Just be resilient and stick around for long enough and let that be your edge. And so that's why I kind of like did not get into searching was. I mean I kind of like figured out okay, I can write some stuff and I can put some stuff in, in terms of scripts in Python, I can figure out how to write.
00:08:38.307 - 00:09:03.859, Speaker B: You know, there's enough mav bots that I can, I don't even have to deploy my own. I can use somebody else's map bot to actually run this logic. But just seeing the nature of the competition and like looking at interviews of people that had been in searching that were no longer searching because of how competitive it got, led me to believe that I think there's going to be more value in understanding the market structure here and also where I think the market structure is going to be able to have some kind of edge in this kind of behavior.
00:09:04.027 - 00:09:12.335, Speaker A: Correct. So like you started this almost a year ago or if not longer. So what was the market structure back then and has it changed today?
00:09:13.515 - 00:10:02.115, Speaker B: Yeah, I think where we started off with was we wanted to really specific on cross chain. I think that that was the part that we, where we started, I think we knew eventually that we were going to be more general purpose because cross chain is something that allows you to be more competitive with even single chain. And I can get into that during the course of this podcast. But we saw that to be new. We saw that to have sort of like a cold start problem when it came to having more solvers. I think early days, when we started speaking earlier this year or late last year, we talked about how a lot of these intent based bridges don't really have any other solvers and most of the time it's the protocol owned solvers. I think in our initial piece that we worked on together, the sense that we had was that this is happening because the protocol owned solvers have some level of edge.
00:10:02.115 - 00:11:08.957, Speaker B: And I can say that after five, six months of, I would say four months of being in production and six months of really studying this, I don't think that's the case. I think protocol owned solvers are recognizing that it's in their best interest to allow more solvers to come in and to start seeing profit from order flow. And for the most part a lot of these teams have been extremely supportive in terms of having us integrate and having us succeed in terms of making a return. And so I would say the market structure has changed in that I think there are more and more players getting into this and I do think that some of the players that, you know, obviously we don't know who they are because they're just wallet Addresses are quite sophisticated and so I suspect that they might come from a searching background or they might come from a, from a quant background or at the very least come from some level of network optimization background because they're pretty strong and they understand latency optimizations, they understand rebalancing from a, from a market microstructure and inventory management way. And it's quite, it's getting quite professional. And yeah, I mean I've spoken to a couple of market makers. I actually had one market maker get into across so doing my bit to make sure that we have more solvers coming in despite me being one of them.
00:11:09.101 - 00:11:28.425, Speaker A: Got it. So like it seems like when you started the protocol owned solver thing was more common because there's a cold start problem. Right. Like there are not enough solvers in the ecosystem. Someone has to do the job. So protocols would do it themselves. But today, because people are realizing that there's enough profit to be made, there are more and more market makers, searchers coming into the ecosystem.
00:11:29.005 - 00:12:23.465, Speaker B: Absolutely. And then also like it's important to realize that it's often in the bear market that we realize that there's a local maximum to the, to a lot of the things that we're doing in crypto. And so if you're not a sort of like really one of the larger well financed market makers that's doing a lot of stuff on centralized exchanges, you need to find as much order flow as possible so you can make as much money as possible on your prop balance sheet. And so that's a lot of people taking an early bet where they think like there's a good amount of order flow every month on across. There's a decent amount of order flow every month on synapse and there's more implementations like Everclear going live Nitro and all of these guys is like, okay, good amount of order flow that we can sync some out of our inventory where we can't really sync elsewhere. But I will say that to a large extent for a large market maker I don't think it is as attractive a business as their balance sheets are way bigger than the balance sheet that you need for doing all cross chain solving today.
00:12:23.965 - 00:12:43.415, Speaker A: Got it. So I definitely want to get into ever cleared ERC 7683 and a lot of the details there. But just like just trying to make a fundamental understanding here. What does a solvers setup look like? Right. Like how many people do you have in your team? What sort of skill set is available to you right now?
00:12:44.035 - 00:13:14.607, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't think we're a representative sample of the largest set of solvers because we're actually not like solvers. We're building a protocol. And so this has very much been R and D for us. It's not really been that important for us to be the best possible cross chain solver. It's been more about understanding market structure here. And frankly speaking, we've not really been doing too much more on the cross chain side. We've actually started to now look in more closely to the single chain side and trying to understand what competitive edge look like over there.
00:13:14.607 - 00:13:57.265, Speaker B: And this is not because we're trying to be solvers, but I think we're realizing that on the liquidity provision side there's a significant opportunity here. And so we're trying to unlock what liquidity provision looks like in a world where all order flows auctioned out, whether it's through FCFS or whether it's through a cow swap style auction or whether it's through Dutch auction. These new auctions allow new liquidity sources to be integrated which come at the cost of existing liquidity sources not being utilized to fill those orders. I think us really working hard to figure out if AMM is with the liquidity primitive of DeFi 1.0, what is the liquidity primitive for DeFi 2.0 and how is it maximally capital efficient? And that's kind of where most of our time, energy and resources are spent. So we are a larger team.
00:13:57.265 - 00:14:46.005, Speaker B: We're about seven people, eight including an external research partner and we'll be 12 people by the end of this year. But that's primarily because of our focus and attention on the protocol design side. I think if you are just a solver and just across chain solver, you don't really need to be more than one person if you're cracked like opium capital is one person and that's like the number one car swap solver. And if you're a cross chain solver as well, I see no reason as to why you need to be more than one person because I don't think there's enough money for you to go about and like hire five, six people doing this cross chain solving thing at the moment. And so I don't expect the teams to be bigger than like one at max four depending on where in the world they are and if they're sharing profits or if they're paying salaries, like yeah, I would say one to four people is this. And the other question you asked was about setup. So I think Setup is a couple of things.
00:14:46.005 - 00:15:39.251, Speaker B: I think it feels very quant. It feels very like you are basically looking at how quickly can I see the order flow and ingest the order flow and how quickly can I submit my bid or my transaction to be the one that wins the auction? Because it's all primarily been FCFs. And so you will design your network stack to basically make sure that your RPC connections are continuously steady with all the chains that you want to solve for. And in some cases you will probably run your own nodes. As you start to reach that local maximum of what latency needs to look like, you will manage inventory. And so typically I think the basket of inventory that most solvers will have today is primarily USDC and wef because most of the money moves around in these assets. In some cases you'll see some that hold on to wbtc, but you're holding majors.
00:15:39.251 - 00:16:17.875, Speaker B: And so this starts to feel a lot like market maker as well, because inventory management is like an entire school of the market maker discipline. And so you make sure, like, sure, I'm filling, you know, wealth orders, but I need to make sure that I'm also hedging against the volatility of ETH, right? So when we started, ETH was worth 3800. It's about 2200 or 2400 today. And so if I was not hedging, then I've basically like not really made any money because 40% of the value of the asset has changed. And unless you're marking out to eth, which means that you are just someone that is like a ETH maxi or like by design, you can only hold eth. Then you see a markout asset. And so everything is fees on top of eth.
00:16:17.875 - 00:16:29.535, Speaker B: But this is typically the setup, right? Like I need to be able to manage my inventory, I need to be able to rebalance between chains where I see the most utilization and opportunity. And I need to manage latency. So this is why I say it's very like market makery.
00:16:29.675 - 00:16:44.635, Speaker A: Awesome. I have a bunch of questions. I'm like trying to pick up the right questions in my head. So like you said, a single person can actually just start solving. How much capital do you think would be ideal for them to start? Is it 10,000, 50,000, 100,000?
00:16:45.535 - 00:17:07.865, Speaker B: It really depends on what you're trying to do with this. I think if you're trying to make a living out of this, you'd want to be at least. I think we started to make decent money when we started with our initial balance sheet. Of 40k. So we're not doing terribly with 40k, certainly enough to pay one person on 40k.
00:17:09.245 - 00:17:10.117, Speaker A: So how much would you make?
00:17:10.141 - 00:18:17.985, Speaker B: I think, man, also the margins have changed quite a lot over the last six months or so. So yeah, I think if you caught the early wave of some of the solving, you were making way more than you're making now. But I think a good sort of heuristic is that if I had 40k, my goal would be to do at least 400k per day in volume, which is, you know, like conservative because like the only thing I can do is keep rebalancing because I will run out of that 40k with the order flow that exists. So if I'm doing 400k, that means I'm probably doing about like 12 million a month. And I can imagine on 12 million a month you make about like depending on how good you are with rebalancing, depending on how many profitable fee earning routes you've made, we're talking about anywhere between 3 to 5k in profit. And this is just like on today's margins, I think earlier this year it was double that. So you're making like 6,7k, doing 10 million in volume, sometimes even 10k depending on how profitable those routes were.
00:18:17.985 - 00:18:34.305, Speaker B: So yeah, I think you can make easily more than $4,000 a month with 40K, which is an incredible return. Right. It's like a, you know, that's like your capital is 40k, you're kind of making 10% per month annualizing. That is almost 200% when you compound it.
00:18:34.465 - 00:18:44.485, Speaker A: And then like, is this directly proportional? Like if I start with more money, do I end up making more money? And that's where like maybe market makers are better place to kind of capture some of the value.
00:18:45.015 - 00:19:19.539, Speaker B: I think it's certainly headed in that direction. Most of these systems are now starting to give you the ability to quote. And so this is where there's a big difference now in terms of where this market structure is heading. And so I think we spoke about this earlier where we said that we should be allowed to price and not really have the sort of like protocol quote the price on our behalf. And these things are like becoming more commonplace now. There's exclusive order flow windows for solvers that are willing to provide competitive quotes. And this very much trends towards the entity that has a larger balance sheet that is capable of taking a lower margin because they want consistent volumes.
00:19:19.539 - 00:19:46.271, Speaker B: And so yes, now we're definitely headed towards larger balance sheets. Now this doesn't necessarily mean that you have the same liquidity turnover ratio. Like if you had 40k, you should easily be doing 400k per day. But if you have like a $4 million balance sheet, it's going to be really hard for you to do 40 million per day in volume. You know, like there's just like that much order flow. To take all of it and to take all of it, assuming all of it has profit, that's going to be tricky. But where that extra money helps is with not running out of inventory on profitable routes.
00:19:46.271 - 00:20:01.263, Speaker B: And I think that's the biggest thing is like, you know, oftentimes when we were operating the 50k balance sheet, we look at the data and see, oh damn, if we would have rebalance on this route, we would have made this much more money. And that becomes, you know, an interesting segment to what Everclear is doing. But yeah, the extra money does help.
00:20:01.399 - 00:20:22.295, Speaker A: Okay. And then, but don't you think like. So let's say you have to continuously rebalance, right? And money does play a big part here. So let's say a 40k solver is of course at a disadvantage to a solver with $4 million. But then some of the bridges that are actually pool based, they have like tens of millions of dollars in liquidity, right? So how do you compete with that?
00:20:25.395 - 00:21:06.911, Speaker B: They have tens of millions of dollars of liquidity, but it's not free. They're sort of like, there's like a, there's like an incentive game that works with keeping that liquidity there. And to a large extent, I think where some of these liquidity network based bridges have not been able to compete is on the actual speed of transmitting that message so that you're able to do that. So I think that's been both a speed problem and a capital efficiency problem. And intent based design just ate their lunch. And that liquidity became even less utilized. Because when you guys sit at the top of this, right, like Leafi and socket, you guys aggregate most of this flow and oftentimes you sort of like want the users to prioritize between price and prioritize between speed and this intent based trade offset that we're going to give you amazing speed at pretty competitive prices.
00:21:06.911 - 00:21:28.903, Speaker B: Like, I mean, you know, the data is there. Like I think you and Hart did an episode recently. I think this, the value that users get from this still exists, which is why I believe they're using it. And there is that trade off of like speed versus price and users. Some users choose speed, some users choose price. And it really is like a Design space that's open for many people.
00:21:29.039 - 00:21:47.885, Speaker A: How Hart explained it was that the intent based bridges prioritize speed and that's why the auctions were first come, first serve. Right. But what you're talking about right now is that's changing and we're moving towards price optimization as well. So are you seeing this actively in bridges today or is this more for like single chain solving?
00:21:48.265 - 00:22:38.031, Speaker B: Yeah. So FCFS is now getting a new look which is it gets a, almost like an RFQ slash exclusivity window that comes before the FCFS auction. And so you're allowed to basically keep providing quotes to be the exclusive filler in some of these bridges. Like across is testing this out on a few routes and if the order is triggered on source chain, the first thing that they will do is look for the quote that has come from the exclusive filler for that. And assuming that the code is like either there's no code or either the code is good, then that order is going to be filled by the exclusive quote. It's not going to go through the FCFS auction. And the idea was to be like more gas efficient, reduce the gas overhead of this latency race that solvers are trying to pay.
00:22:38.031 - 00:23:04.233, Speaker B: Instead of them wasting money on gas to these L2s, why don't you just provide a code instead and so we'll try to match it. So I don't think it loses speed. It actually becomes more efficient for solvers and also forces them to potentially provide quotes, continuously update those. And assuming nobody provides that, then it goes through its regular route. And so I don't think speed gets reduced, but I do think there's some efficiency that's coming out of this kind of structure.
00:23:04.369 - 00:23:08.257, Speaker A: So speed only gets reduced in case the exclusive solver cannot fail.
00:23:08.361 - 00:23:27.015, Speaker B: Right. It's a pre stream, so they already know that their value for the exclusive code is null and so it automatically triggers the FCFS option. So the FCFS auction almost happens as usual. I would say like the difference is it's. You'd not be able to distinguish it with a stopwatch even if you tried.
00:23:28.315 - 00:23:37.215, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah. I mean heart was explaining it like, okay, we can have intents fulfilled in milliseconds, so definitely, at least my stopwatch is not going to help.
00:23:37.675 - 00:23:39.135, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure.
00:23:39.755 - 00:23:58.375, Speaker A: Okay, so like the next question that I have is around the rebalancing, right? Like that's always talked about. There's Everclear that's coming up with a entire new primitive just to solve this problem. So how big of a problem is that and how does that scale with like the number of chains the solver expand, expands to?
00:23:59.235 - 00:24:33.259, Speaker B: Yeah, this is a great question. Funnily enough, we spoke to Arjun earlier this year and you know, we had sort of like had a few things in our notes as like, damn, we need like some way to clear all of this stuff. We need some kind of clearinghouse mechanism. And yeah, when we first started speaking to him was they were kind of like really far into Everclear. And that was really cool because I'm like, okay, someone's doing this. And so this is going to be great to see because it was a big problem, especially if you're a smaller balance sheet. Like that's the big difference here is like with a small balance sheet this can be really efficient for you to be competitive.
00:24:33.259 - 00:25:20.789, Speaker B: And that's always been Arjun and connext his vision to make it such that the smaller solvers can be competitive so long as they can get some level of economies of scale from the netting out of each other's flows. And I think that's a really strong and powerful vision. I'm optimistic that it'll work really well for the smaller failures and solvers to be able to rebalance themselves. However, I think it is going to be interesting to see what happens as more and more of the cross chain systems like for example, Uniswap X go live. So Uniswap X is going to prioritize swaps, right? So they are going to actually ask you to price. Okay, what is the quote that you're providing me for usdc? If someone wants to swap eth to USDC between two chains? This to my mind is not something most of the existing fillers can do. This is something that market makers can do.
00:25:20.789 - 00:26:07.005, Speaker B: And market makers have large enough balance sheets that they'll probably know what they want to have cleared and so, and they also know when they want some of this stuff to be cleared. And so it's going to be interesting to see how these things play together. But I certainly think that it's a very valid problem that they're solving and they had a fantastic vantage point on it as well because they had connects routers for really long and they could kind of see that behavior in connects routers for really long. And so I definitely think that they're solving a problem that they face and certainly we faced. We're going to be both a maker and a taker inside Everclear when they go live. And so yeah, you have my telegram and you have my email ID and you know where to find me. For any feedback and further discussion on Everclear right now, I'll just say like, you know, we've been integrating, we're working with their team and excited to see how this helps us with capital efficiency on our primitive.
00:26:07.165 - 00:26:23.665, Speaker A: Makes sense. And I think you brought up an interesting point, right? Like how a lot of the filling works right now is just the same asset on different chains. But if a Uniswap X wants to do cross chain swaps, then the assets on the balance sheet also need to increase. So then the hobbyist solver actually cannot compete at the same level anymore.
00:26:24.205 - 00:27:19.569, Speaker B: So the assets on the balance sheet don't necessarily have to change too far. Which is not to say that someone's going to hold MOG on the destination chain because they think it's like, that's just not something you can hold. But certainly the skill gap is a little bit higher here because you do need to be able to figure out like, okay, assuming that I'm doing like the majors, you can just assume that the majors are going to be dominated by entities that already have big balance sheets of these assets, right? Like if you go to Occam, you can just go and find SCP Wallet, you can go and find Winter Mute Wallet, you can go and find Tokelabs Wallet, you can go and find Flow Traders Wallet. They just have a lot of these assets, right? And so if they have a lot of these assets, they're just like in a really good position to fill these orders if they want to. I think the biggest edge and arbitrage you have right now when you're doing some of this cross chain stuff is that these guys just don't think it's interesting and big enough for them for their aspirations. It's like tiny, it's minuscule. They want to move hundreds of millions, if not billions per day.
00:27:19.569 - 00:28:06.251, Speaker B: And the cross chain order flow landscape is just not suited to that. And that is edge in and of itself because you are grateful that you don't fall within their categorization of meaningful. But it will become harder for some of these fillers that are just doing single chain stuff because you're going to have to adjust yourself to become a bit of a maker with greater sophistication. I don't think you will be able to provide quotes on a swap without having integrations into centralized exchanges to figure out what price deviation is and what alphas are on the centralized exchange. Because centralized exchanges and Binance in particular is the price setter for all majors in our space. And so you're going to need to increase the integrations that you have. If there are many people with integrations, you're going to increase the sort of latency infrastructure you have and the speed with which you transmit that information.
00:28:06.251 - 00:28:19.659, Speaker B: You're going to start to be able to develop, like, predictive models of, like, okay, what is the correct portfolio construction for the next 3 minutes, 5 minutes, 15 minutes, hour, 3 hours, 5 hours. Because these are already things that market makers have out of the box. Like, this is just what your engine looks like.
00:28:19.827 - 00:28:44.545, Speaker A: So it seems like we're technically not really reducing the barrier to entry, right? Like, like you said one year ago, maybe a lot of the things could have just worked out without some of these sophisticated skills. But because market makers are coming into the picture, the order flow is increasing, competition is also increasing, the bar is also increasing. Right? So for. For someone to just set up a solver over the weekend and think that they're going to be competitive is probably not realistic.
00:28:45.845 - 00:29:40.049, Speaker B: I would say so. But I think sometimes our face, our space, has this incredible fascination with, like, reducing the barriers of entry and somehow conflating with that to reducing the standard of excellence. I think if you talk about early days of mev, you had anybody with an Internet connection could become a searcher. It was just new, right? Like, it was just a thing you could do because nobody else was doing it. And over time, that asymmetry goes away. If there's sufficient value, I think it's good for the space, if the space is valuable enough that sophisticated players are coming in. Because at the end of the day, like, if we zoom out and focus on the end user, the main thing is, is the end user getting what they want to do? Are they getting better execution quality? Are they getting this feeling of atomicity? Are they able to move value around seamlessly between chains? Are we abstracting away the chains in the background? Because is it then really important who's abstracting the chainsaway? Is it important that a market maker is doing it or a layer zero multisig is doing it? It's happening.
00:29:40.049 - 00:30:13.079, Speaker B: If it's happening, is this giving room for applications to design new stuff and onboard new users? I think yes, largely this is happening. If there's more value to be captured and it sort of suits the skill sets of sophisticated actors that can capture it, then I think it's hard for us to think that the smart thing to do is reduce the standard of excellence of the space, right? Like you'd want to increase the standard of excellence of the space. And have competition amongst a set of actors with an increased standard of excellence. Because there's also more equity creation through that. Right. Like hobbyists don't create equity. Our space needs long term equity to have like, you know, longevity.
00:30:13.079 - 00:30:23.535, Speaker B: And that's where equity value of our space increases as well. So I think this is all like good stuff. I think sometimes the narratives can get overblown about like barriers for entry and standard of excellence.
00:30:23.695 - 00:30:30.127, Speaker A: I mean, the barriers of entry are like coming down in the sense that if the order flow increases, the better players are going to come into the picture.
00:30:30.191 - 00:30:30.367, Speaker B: Right.
00:30:30.391 - 00:30:44.975, Speaker A: So we should be happy about that. Yes. And like, so just to wrap up this cross chain solving kind of section. So you did cross chain solving on a cross nitro and SYNAPSE for the last six months. What are your like three learnings from that experience?
00:30:46.755 - 00:31:25.659, Speaker B: Well, I think there's a few. So if you want me to stick to three, I will try my best. But if I go on for more than I apologize. First things first, the implementation solvers that they all have are not going to be competitive. You're probably not going to do well or win any order flow if you use the reference implementations reference to be fair, they come with plenty checks and balances in place to make sure that you don't get screwed over or lose money or take unnecessary risks to begin with. And there's certainly training wheels there. But we realized very quickly that we need to design everything from scratch.
00:31:25.659 - 00:31:52.389, Speaker B: And so that's going to be your first learning is that okay, you need to have your hub, you know, from scratch. Second thing that is a little bit intimidating sometimes is that when these protocols are pushing some kind of upgrades you don't necessarily know. And that is pretty scary because some of them can screw you over. Like some of the upgrades might actually switch the headers and the addresses for.
00:31:52.517 - 00:32:07.415, Speaker A: Beneficiary and depositor of an aggregator. By the way, we're just like realizing that we have to change everything in a week or so. So by now we've figured out a better flow for bridges to tell us in advance so that we can prepare for things. But we can totally relate to that.
00:32:07.795 - 00:32:33.225, Speaker B: Well, I hope you guys will remember us and just tell us when some of the bridges are doing stuff so that we know that we have to check and our circuit breakers have to kick in. I mean, to be fair, we also have that now in place. We have kill switches and circuit breakers whenever there's an update. We have a QA in house now. So we make sure that nothing goes into production without his say so. He's. He used to be at one inch, so it's like he's seen that sort of high standard of excellence before.
00:32:33.225 - 00:33:19.379, Speaker B: So there's definitely that which was like, kind of caught us off guard. And I don't know if I will tell the full story about what happened there, but probably off record, I'll tell you because it was pretty bad. The third thing is that a lot of these guys have like kinks when it comes to rebalancing. And you need to be able to account for that in your models of which order flow you prioritize. So if you have concurrent order flow and you have to pick between which one, assuming you have a finite amount of inventory on that particular route, the way you compute the rebalancing costs for each of these is kind of different. Synapse, for example, it requires you to make three calls. You also have to, basically, you have to prove that you filled it and then you have to also claim call the claim function before you can get rebalanced.
00:33:19.379 - 00:34:06.397, Speaker B: The router has its own state chain and accounting chain, which requires you to have its gas token root and across is optimistic. It uses UMA and has canonical bridge rebalancing. So there's differences here. And so when you actually, if you're reached, if you've reached that level of optimization where you're trying to figure time and cost of rebalancing, you might actually choose one order over the other, even if it has lower basis points because you think that it might come back to you a few minutes before or the rebalancing costs might actually be lower with that type of order flow. And so these are, I would say, like these are the top three things that we've certainly learned is that there's like nuance to how you pick these orders. And if you really get into the weeds about how you pick those orders, then you, then you start to, you know, then you start to like, cook a little bit.
00:34:06.541 - 00:34:13.105, Speaker A: Okay, so because of this nuance, would you say that we don't see solvers that are active on all of these platforms?
00:34:15.134 - 00:35:04.695, Speaker B: Honestly, I am a little bit surprised that there isn't greater cross pollination. I think there should be and I think there certainly will be. And I think Intent Markets was designed for that to encourage that. Right. Like, I mean, even though I might be shooting ourselves in the foot a little bit by increasing the competition that we have in the space, I do think it's kind of strange that you don't have more people doing this Also, however, recognize that like some people want to specialize, like hyper specialize before they start. And it has been clear that, you know, across has been clearly the market leader for a while with the most consistent organic order flow that you can basically spend that time integrating into. And so until you feel like you've reached that point of okay, I can do normal order flow in across, I need to start doing more order flow in other ecosystems.
00:35:04.695 - 00:35:24.217, Speaker B: The likelihood that if you perfect across, you'd be competitive in the other ecosystems is very high. And so maybe I think what we're seeing is people trying to compete for across and like do really well there before they start to get into filling in other ones. Because they're going to face less competition or a less sort of standard of excellence, should it be the other way around.
00:35:24.321 - 00:35:28.725, Speaker A: Like there's less competition so they'll be better off starting on the other platforms.
00:35:29.265 - 00:35:39.183, Speaker B: That is in terms of the asymmetry. But I think in terms of like, if you get your infrastructure and optimization such that you're winning order flown across, that's going to translate easily into the other ones.
00:35:39.319 - 00:35:50.955, Speaker A: Got it. Makes sense. And I think it's also just the order flow, right? Like we're Talking about why MMs are not coming into cross chain solving because of the lack of order flow. So why would a solver go beyond across if the order flow just like keeps decreasing?
00:35:51.255 - 00:36:22.915, Speaker B: Yeah, and it's also the balance sheets, right? Like they don't have like the average solver, I think has a balance sheet of anywhere from like 100 to 250k. There's a handful that have more than 500k, then the protocol owned ones have pretty large ones. If you only have 250k and if you're lights out on across, I don't really know if there's any further room for you to have your inventory utilize anywhere else. Because that is like you're probably turning over an incredible amount of volume at that size.
00:36:23.215 - 00:37:00.465, Speaker A: Got it. And I also want to get your thoughts on erc7683 and how do you see across this kind of change of positioning in a way? Because initially I used to think that the solver network is the edge because they have a lot of solvers, they can be more competitive faster and all the good stuff that comes with it. But my conversation with Heart, I learned through that that solving is not where everyone is optimizing. These guys are opening up the solving so that anyone can come into the picture. Then settlement or order flow generation is where people want to be placed at. Right, so what are your thoughts on that?
00:37:00.925 - 00:37:49.125, Speaker B: Yeah, I totally agree. I think value accrues at the edges, across and heart. He's really smart. He knows that the sort of longer term play for across to make here is reinforcing the brand and I think they've done a fantastic job of doing that because as you reinforce the brand I think there's like a flywheel of integrations that come through and they're able to continuously prove that this is super high quality. And the more of a step back their protocol owned solver takes, the more money others make and the more solvers come in. And we've kind of seen that, right? Like their reference implementations, they have two reference implementations that they continue to run within across. They have been designed in such a way that they don't get in your way saving except for like very large transactions which you don't want to fill any.
00:37:49.125 - 00:38:35.541, Speaker B: That's been smart on their part because that's increased the sort of like sticking stickiness of across in much the same way as Cowswap has this sort of stickiness. Right. Like Cow Swap has this very expressive set of solvers that have come in and you know, gnosis early implementations are no longer even competing for the flow. So I think this is smart. I don't think that solver networks per se are the edge and I don't think that gatekeeping solvers should be the edge. I think if you are looking at the order flow landscape, you want to encourage as many people as possible to solve as much as possible because you have a better global liveness for all of you rather than trying to hyper localize it. And I think that's when you start to play long term games versus short term games.
00:38:35.541 - 00:39:07.595, Speaker B: And I think like hard and across, they get that really well. Is that if we can extend the moneyness property of this middle layer, which is our solver layer, it actually allows us to increase the brand premium of across at the front end, front end of the order flow side. And it also allows us to kind of like position ourselves with that settlement layer, which is super interesting. I expect them to have a Solana implementation soon. I expect them to maybe remove UMA from the across implementation and perhaps bring in some level of ZK at some point to improve it. But I think they've done it really well.
00:39:08.135 - 00:39:13.265, Speaker A: The other question is how do you as a solver look at something like ERC 7683?
00:39:14.405 - 00:40:10.041, Speaker B: I think it's an interface, I don't think it solves some of the problems of like, that some of these intent based systems have different kinks when it comes to rebalancing. Like, it doesn't harmonize that there's a unified standard for expressing it, which is an interface that applications can use. But this doesn't actually change the solver problem of like, how do I rebalance and what are the things that I need to do to be able to rebalance. Like, nobody follows the same interface there and to a large extent nobody follows the same interface there because there's like business reasons to not follow the same interface there. Right? Like if you're like someone that's trying to create value for your state chain and you want some premium for your gas token and so you want solvers to hold it. If you're someone that wants to prove that you are like Oracle is the best oracle and secures the most value in defi, then you would use the Oracle to have that as like rebalancing and so on and so forth. I think different people will want to have some different sort of designs over there.
00:40:10.041 - 00:40:21.985, Speaker B: I think that's the part where it would be cool if there was a unified interface for that. That would be like an awesome erc.763 is like, interesting and I think it's a step forward, but ultimately I think there's a lot more pain on the other side of 763.
00:40:22.105 - 00:40:25.765, Speaker A: But does Everclear kind of position itself on the other side?
00:40:27.225 - 00:41:03.545, Speaker B: Potentially, yeah, it does. I think it absorbs that complexity from the ecosystems themselves. And so you don't have to, as a solver, worry about that complexity. I think the ultimate trade off for a solver is going to be how much does this cost for me to use Everclear and how long does it take? Because we know that flows can net out if you give it enough time. But I don't really want to wait six hours to see my flows netted out like I want. I would much rather pay a little bit extra to get my money back in minutes, then wait for my flows to net out in hours. And this is something that we have expressed to the teams as well.
00:41:03.545 - 00:41:13.465, Speaker B: And so while we're optimistic about Everclear, I think there's a few things that we'll only be able to tell with time and sort of like what the escape velocity is for an idea like that makes sense.
00:41:13.505 - 00:41:20.257, Speaker A: I mean like anyone can do it in a day, right? It's about every two hours. Can you rebalance across ten chains?
00:41:20.321 - 00:41:46.345, Speaker B: Right. Like that's the two hours is long. Like if you're like a solver with a small balance sheet, which is ever clearest target audience, you, we should be thinking about like minutes, not hours. Because if it's hours, then the small balance sheet is going to run out really quickly. Like how long does it take for 40k of value to get bridged? And you guys sit at the top of 10 seconds, right? So your money is gone in 10 seconds and you have to wait six hours for it to get rebalanced. That's probably not like the best way for you to do it.
00:41:46.505 - 00:41:55.015, Speaker A: Okay, awesome. That makes sense. Are there any other solver risks that we haven't talked about that are kind of potent problems?
00:41:56.395 - 00:42:31.663, Speaker B: Sometimes L2 RPCs can be a nightmare. And so you are often like not seeing consistent state. And so you definitely should be cycling your RPC providers before you get to a place of I'm going to run my own node. And so you should have a heartbeat for each of your RPC connections because if you don't, then you will waste a lot of money on filling orders that have already been filled. And in some cases it can be worse, right? Like maybe, you know, you assuming that the block has been confirmed, but it hasn't and you send the money and that money kind of goes away. So that's something that hasn't been covered that I think is a risk. I think we did cover sort of like the hedging aspect.
00:42:31.663 - 00:42:56.975, Speaker B: Like if your portfolio, how you hedge your portfolio is kind of important. And that's where there's also like network effects around what your portfolio composition is. If your portfolio is larger, you also have more of the ability to hold the volatile asset. Which is why I feel like market makers have an edge. Right? Like I have a $5 million balance sheet. I hold 80% USDC and 20% ETH. But my 20% ETH portfolio is larger than anybody else's 80% ETH portfolio.
00:42:56.975 - 00:43:09.111, Speaker B: And so it's just like that's kind of where these things get a little bit hard. And that's where I'm excited to announce some of the stuff that we've been doing at ANA is like, how are we changing this dynamic and how are we changing this market structure?
00:43:09.303 - 00:43:16.355, Speaker A: I definitely want to give you some time to talk about that as well. But before that, I have many more questions on the solid ecosystem.
00:43:16.895 - 00:43:26.719, Speaker B: Happy to answer all the questions on the solver side today. And then when we have an announcement coming out with our full white paper and stuff, then we can have another conversation about what we do.
00:43:26.887 - 00:43:42.785, Speaker A: Awesome. Another primitive is probably the solver, collaboration, solver specialization side of things. Do you think that makes sense? Will solvers be willing to collaborate and does that make business sense to do that?
00:43:46.365 - 00:44:27.175, Speaker B: Okay, let me preface this by saying that I primarily look at defi, right? I'm looking at defi and I'm looking at defi, where there's value. If we're trying to look at what market structure might look like, we should look at cow swap. It's the best representation of having an ecosystem with solvers and market makers. And there is a collaboration, but there's also a simultaneous competition. So let me explain. If you go to Carlsops order flow, your number one solver is Copium Capital, right? So Copium Capital is your solver in the traditional sense, taker only. Right? So like not a maker at all, which is they don't provide their private liquidity.
00:44:27.175 - 00:45:08.997, Speaker B: They look for the best routes, try to generate surplus, and this is where they find value for users and this is how they make money. The other two solvers that are really large in this space are PLM, which is SCP's solver, and Resolver, which is Wintermute's solver. Now if you look at the transactions that these large market makers do between their maker and their taker, there's that integration of like, they just use their private liquidity and so they're using their liquidity to win order flow. In Carswap, that's basically all they're willing to do. They're not necessarily willing to get into the routing. Like, let's find where surplus is. They're just like, no, let's just, let's just be a maker and let's not charge any maker fees to our taker and that's how we'll win order flow.
00:45:08.997 - 00:45:09.181, Speaker B: Right?
00:45:09.213 - 00:45:14.745, Speaker A: Can you like and explain the maker and taker difference? Because I don't know, a lot of people would know that lingo.
00:45:15.045 - 00:45:39.115, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. You have. This is basically the person that's willing to sell expresses the price at which they're willing to sell. So they kind of are the ones that place the orders in a limit order book. And generally speaking, whenever somebody wants to buy, they want to take the assets. They kind of will express the price at which they want to take assets. And the order book will typically match this.
00:45:39.115 - 00:46:05.541, Speaker B: Right? RFQ systems is basically, I'm asking a maker, hey, what is a quote that I can get for the assets? I want to take the assets from you. You have them tell me what the quote is. And then so the maker Gives the taker this. When you talk about fees, you have both a maker and a taker fee. So taker fees, like how much a swapper has to pay and a maker is how much a maker gets paid for the swap, basically. And then there's some nuance between how this is done with order books. There's like different prices, but that's the long and short of it.
00:46:05.541 - 00:46:47.265, Speaker B: So bid, ask, maker, taker, all of this stuff is kind of the same. There's clear advantage to an integration here. The clear advantage here is that if you're both maker and taker, you're able to internalize the fees as a taker, right? Like you're able to say, okay, you know what, I am the same entity, and so somewhere I don't have to pay this fee because I'm the same person. And this is where it gets tricky for someone like an exclusive solver that doesn't want to hold any assets, especially majors. 70% of all of Cowsop's volume is in majors, and 63% of that is filled using private liquidity. And so the more assets market makers are willing to hold, the less competitive solvers become. And this is the pitch for 0x or Bebop or Hashflow.
00:46:47.265 - 00:47:20.595, Speaker B: These are sources that integrate directly into these solvers or these takers. And so they're not actually using AMM liquidity here, they're using some level of private liquidity. And so there is a collaboration that exists. The question is, how long does that collaboration exist? Because one thing I'll tell you for sure, the top cost of solver today is figuring out how do I also get on the maker side. There's clear alpha and advantage for them to integrate. And so over time, I think people are going to realize that there's alpha and advantage for me to be on both sides and not just be a solver. And this is where my opinion kind of diverges from a lot of people in the space, that a solver can remain a solver that doesn't have to be a market maker.
00:47:20.595 - 00:47:50.489, Speaker B: And I think that if you want to be doing this long term with edge, you're going to have to find edge on the other side, because routing is commodity. You guys do aggregation a lot, right? And if you wanted to do routing, you could do routing tomorrow. And you're much closer to the user than a solver is. So I think you guys are in a position to maybe even commoditize the solver business from a routing perspective. The only thing that I would say aggregators don't have the skills for is how do we hold inventory to start to internalize the swap volume? Because I think that's where it starts to diverge from your core business. I think that becomes the edge long term.
00:47:50.657 - 00:48:17.755, Speaker A: So is that the moat then just integrating on all different levels of the stack? Like you can hold your own inventory. You have the best routing algorithm. So that's how solvers build modes. And frankly, like companies, right? Like right now it just seems like a solver can be a bot, but then a solver is not just a bot. Like you said, it has to become a company. And in a way you have to build beyond just like routing or just like filling in with liquidity.
00:48:18.855 - 00:48:57.331, Speaker B: Let's ask ourselves this question, right? Like what do we expect to or want to see happen five years from now in defi? And then we can work backwards. So if the first five or six years of our space was around free market AMM primitives that allowed price discovery for anything. So swap anything and let's launch 500 meme coins per day. And AMMs are an excellent way to do this because it allows me to provide liquidity on this and I can figure out how I want to rebalance my portfolio whether I want to have concentrated liquidity or constant product. That was an excellent primitive. But I think a lot of us have talked about having more RWAs on chain. We've talked a lot more about having assets that people have a demand for.
00:48:57.331 - 00:49:33.235, Speaker B: Stablecoins are the biggest asset class in crypto. And now we're starting to see multiple derivatives of stablecoins. The other assets that are really taken off are liquid staked and restaked assets. And we expect this to keep growing because you have new restaking primitives that are creating new assets that will have more liquidity. Now both stable assets and assets that are pegged in value to Ethereum or BTC or whatever is the restaking primitive are all assets that market makers are willing to hold. Anyway. There is not much of a difference of me holding eth versus staked ethnicity because the value is the same.
00:49:33.235 - 00:50:25.415, Speaker B: It's just that I feel that ethoweth is used more and so I choose to hold it right. And so if we think that the volume of these assets is going to increase more so than the long tail, which it almost always plays out like long tail makes a lot of noise because of the volume of like the number of tokens that come out. But the amount that is traded is always larger in majors. And so if we expect more and more majors to be traded, whether they're stable assets, whether they're RWAs, or whether they're restaked assets. We have to ask ourselves this question of is there any edge in just doing solving for a long enough time period? And at what point does the edge become me holding these assets to fill these orders? Because these systems, when it comes down to providing the best execution quality, you exhaust a much lower resource budget when you use private liquidity and have called the transfer function instead of calling a multi call on amm. And so if you're a solver, you're doing many of those things, and if you're a private liquidity.
