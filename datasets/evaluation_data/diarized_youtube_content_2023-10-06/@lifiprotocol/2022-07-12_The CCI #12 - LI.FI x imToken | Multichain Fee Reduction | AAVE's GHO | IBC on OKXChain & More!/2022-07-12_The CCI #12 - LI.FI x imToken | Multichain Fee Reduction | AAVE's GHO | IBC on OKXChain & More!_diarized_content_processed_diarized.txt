00:00:12.840 - 00:00:37.993, Speaker A: Everyone, welcome to this week's episode of the Cross Chain Insider, a weekly roundup of all news traveling across chains, brought to you by lifi. I'm Mark, member of the Biz dev team and a holder of airdrops. My Gigabrain co host is Arjun, the jack of all trades, master of everything here at lefi. He's the thread door extraordinaire, research or of protocols, and the occasional member of the sales team. What's up, Arjun?
00:00:38.129 - 00:00:42.685, Speaker B: That was a very subtle flex that you have. Airdrops by talking.
00:00:43.025 - 00:00:47.205, Speaker A: No, no, no. It's a reverse flex because I still hold them.
00:00:48.345 - 00:00:49.165, Speaker B: Okay.
00:00:50.665 - 00:01:24.829, Speaker A: All right, so this is the Cross Chain Insider, which Arjun, the gigabrain over there, he writes as a newsletter on Substack every single week and you can get this delivered directly to your mailbox. Usually Comes in for me at around 9am Central Time. Don't know what time it would come in in other time zones, but you should definitely go subscribe. It is lefi.substack.com however, you can also just listen to us talk about everything written in podcast form here on the cci. Ooh, what do you think about that? That's the first time I tried it out on the pod.
00:01:24.877 - 00:01:28.665, Speaker B: I mean, we've been calling it CCI internally for a long time now.
00:01:29.205 - 00:01:45.239, Speaker A: I know, but I didn't. I haven't tried it on the pod. Okay, if you. If you liked it, maybe comment on our YouTube page. We need some more comments, guys. Okay, Arjun, as usual, the newsletter starts with Bridge updates. What is going on in the bridging world?
00:01:45.397 - 00:02:09.555, Speaker B: Yeah, so let's start with Ren Bridge. So Ren Bridge has integrated Optimism and users can now bridge btc, USDC ETH between Optimism and Ren supported chains. Fun fact. Ren was actually the first interop project I learned about two years ago. I'm surprised they're not like more popular now. But I'm down bad on these tokens as well.
00:02:09.715 - 00:02:19.205, Speaker A: Hey, I had. I had some Ren back in the day too. You can also bridge over dogecoin. So that's pretty exciting. If anyone this big DOGE fanatic still.
00:02:19.245 - 00:02:48.305, Speaker B: Has dogecoin, please use Ren. Next one is LEFI now supports IAM token wallet. So we've integrated the wallet. It's a very popular wallet in like. It's been used by users in like 150 countries across the world. So IAM token users can now bridge and swap across 15 chains that LIFI supports on our B2C interface, which is transfer to XYZ. Next up we have Conex So Connects is listed on Token Terminal.
00:02:48.305 - 00:03:33.465, Speaker B: Token Terminal is a platform for blockchains and decentralized applications so you can get data on these applications there. So users can now access data on Connects. So there's data like annualized total revenue, transaction volume, total value log and all the good details so you can check them out there. C Bridge has added support for Ontology Network. So users can now bridge usdt, usdc, eth, BTC between Ethereum and Ontology Network via Seabridge. It's like if you see there's a common trend here, right? Like the always the blue chips are supported first, usdt, usdc, Eth, btc. By the way, did you know about Ontology Network?
00:03:35.765 - 00:03:40.097, Speaker A: I was reading about it a little bit today, but I have not checked it out yet myself.
00:03:40.261 - 00:04:40.055, Speaker B: Yeah, if you, if you check Seabridge and Multi Chain they're connecting to chains that we probably haven't heard of. So I think that's a really good thing in terms of connectivity because all of these projects get like exposure to the mainstream ecosystem, which is good. Next up we have Biconium. So Biconomy, they've, they've had a proposal on Optimism where they've requested OP tokens that can be distributed to DAPP users and DAPP builders. So they've requested 750,000 op tokens, 500 of which will be distributed as ecosystem grants plus gas grants and 250 OP tokens will be distributed as like liquidity mining on hyphen. So it's an interesting way of approaching like forum proposals where like my economy team is directly asking the OP team to grant tokens so that they can distribute and incentivize users. What do you think about this approach?
00:04:41.675 - 00:05:15.255, Speaker A: So I'm very interested in the gasless transaction portion of this governance request just because I think that's a great way to onboard people onto Optimism. However, I do have some questions on once that those 500,000 op tokens dissipate and will people just have to go back to paying gas fees and then won't users be mad? It feels like a short term, it feels like liquidity mining all over again.
00:05:16.275 - 00:05:24.295, Speaker B: It's a short term thing you onboard users and once they're hooked onto the network, they'll start paying for it. They'll have to pay for it.
00:05:24.715 - 00:05:46.403, Speaker A: Yeah, I thought it was really cool and I mean obviously gasless transactions is huge. So I think, I think it's cool. The one thing I did notice on the governance proposal was the L2 recipient address. I thought that was funny just because of the previous optimism snafu with their tokens. I'm quite sure that they got the L2 address correct on this one.
00:05:46.579 - 00:06:06.413, Speaker B: Yeah, I hope so. Up next, we have multi chain. So multichain has reduced USDC fees for EVM chains. And this started from the first of July, which is 10 days ago. So this is. They've done this to better serve their customers. So they've reduced fees by almost 50% on some routes.
00:06:06.413 - 00:06:32.953, Speaker B: So for example, if you're like bridging from Kronos or BSC or Polygon, the gas fees used to be 0.9 USDC and the discounted fees now is 0.5. So almost like a good 40, 45% reduction. That's great to see, I think. Next up we have Nomad. So Nomad has introduced Bridge direct links. So this is basically to make life easier for users.
00:06:32.953 - 00:06:50.785, Speaker B: So if they want like specific links or specific rules, Nomad has provided that with this feature. So for example, if you want to bridge USDC to edmos, they've provided a direct link that can let you do that instead of you going and finding where's the root, where's the token. So it's just easy.
00:06:53.645 - 00:07:06.269, Speaker A: I just, I can't type well enough to pull this off. It's a delightful idea. I just, I would try to spell evmos and somehow I. There'd be like a in there and it would just be terrible. Anyways.
00:07:06.317 - 00:07:08.625, Speaker B: Okay, so that's such a random piece of information.
00:07:09.205 - 00:07:34.275, Speaker A: Yeah, I can't. I can't spell. Okay, so that was the bridging portion of the newsletter. Next up, we have just the multi chain ecosystem updates and we're starting something small. With something small not in news. The news isn't small, but the actual device is small. Polygon is going mobile.
00:07:34.275 - 00:08:05.811, Speaker A: So Polygon announced its first major mobile integration with htc, which will be launching a Metaverse mobile device called the Desire 22 Pro, which will come with a digital asset wallet that will first support NFTs. This is of course pretty big news. Following Solana just came out with a recent announcement that was pretty similar. I cannot wait to see the mobile tech stack grow in Web three. Arjun, you look like you want to say something here.
00:08:05.963 - 00:08:20.517, Speaker B: Both the news are very different. So Solana, that was like they're making their own product, but Polygon is like, okay, we don't have any expertise on this. We'll just let the experts do their job while we provide the tech. Very different approaches.
00:08:20.701 - 00:08:39.573, Speaker A: Totally different approach. Yeah. So Polygon is not really involved in the making of this phone, from what I can tell, it's a third party doing it. Also a great name. It's called the nothing phone which like I'm in, like sign me up. Next. I think you put this one in just for me because you know, I love Flow.
00:08:39.709 - 00:08:46.425, Speaker B: No, I just put this into add some different flavor to the newsletter because we've not covered Flow before.
00:08:47.085 - 00:09:30.585, Speaker A: Okay, well, I'm an NBA top shot, guys, so this goes directly to my heart here. But permissionless smart contract deployment is now live on Flow, which is the gaming and NFT focused L1 blockchain. Now anyone can deploy a contract to the Flow main net without review. Previously this. It wasn't really open to the public to deploy smart contracts, but this is just another great step for Flow decentralizing. Flow is another one of those blockchains that kind of started small and they have their own programming language and now they're kind of expanding and they want to decentralize more as it expands. Next we have wufi, a multi chain Dex.
00:09:30.585 - 00:09:32.209, Speaker A: Do you think I said that correct? Wufi?
00:09:32.257 - 00:09:33.119, Speaker B: I think so.
00:09:33.297 - 00:10:02.197, Speaker A: Okay, I'm pretty certain it is now on Polygon. This is the fourth network it has been deployed on, including bnb, Chain, Avalanche and Phantom. As always, we love to see more expansion. This was made possible by their integration with Layer zero, a cross chain messaging protocol which is like a Layer zero for bridging. It's a good name, you have to admit. Layer zero, it's good.
00:10:02.301 - 00:10:07.973, Speaker B: Is it the Layer zero for blockchains? Like, it's a good name, but is.
00:10:07.989 - 00:10:14.785, Speaker A: It correct for bridging functionality? It's the Layer zero, right?
00:10:15.085 - 00:10:15.825, Speaker B: How.
00:10:16.605 - 00:10:18.189, Speaker A: Okay, I think it's a good name.
00:10:18.277 - 00:10:22.225, Speaker B: It's a good name. It's a very good name. But is it technically correct?
00:10:24.635 - 00:10:34.299, Speaker A: This feels. This feels like Arjun's hot take for the bottom of the pod. I don't think I can. I don't think I can argue with you right now or we'll run out of time.
00:10:34.347 - 00:10:38.219, Speaker B: You're the one who called it out. So I'm just like asking, but I.
00:10:38.227 - 00:11:18.307, Speaker A: Was just giving out a compliment, you know, and then you're over here really drilling down in the details. Okay, next update here is that Celestial Labs has kicked off a proposal on Optimism's government forum, governance forum for using Celestia for data availability. On Optimism. The team has proposed to create Celestium Testnet Testnet chain based on a fork of Optimism. This is just another one of those proposals on Optimism. Feels like it's the hottest thing right now on their Governance forums, like every single day I hop on there and there's something crazy going down. This is just another one of those really cool ideas.
00:11:18.307 - 00:11:22.875, Speaker A: I don't believe it's hit snapshot yet. So I think this is just a proposal for now.
00:11:22.955 - 00:11:29.535, Speaker B: But like I think there's been an increase in the number of proposals across forums in general.
00:11:29.835 - 00:12:02.885, Speaker A: Yep, we may talk about that later. Next we have the OKC chain. It is just announced that the IBC integration will go live on mainnet within a few months and I believe that it's now live on the testnet. So IBC coming to OKC chain, which is EVM compatible. So this is just another example of IBC and EVM coming together. What's up Arjun? You had something to say?
00:12:02.965 - 00:12:15.995, Speaker B: I think it's OKX Chain and they call it okc. So it's OKX Chain AKA okc. But I think they've recently rebranded since they kind of confuse it.
00:12:17.815 - 00:12:22.175, Speaker A: I tried my best, guys. Next.
00:12:22.295 - 00:12:26.359, Speaker B: I think it's my fault by the way, because I've written two different things in the newsletter.
00:12:26.527 - 00:12:59.937, Speaker A: I actually looked this up before we recorded and I couldn't. I just. It was. It was a fumble. Anyways, ave introduced a will propose to launch gho or go, a native decentralized collateral over collateral backed stablecoin peggedUSD. The team plans to use aave's v3 portal feature to scale go in the multichain world. This is pretty big news that AAVE is getting into the decentralized stablecoin game.
00:12:59.937 - 00:13:01.405, Speaker A: What do you think of the name?
00:13:03.195 - 00:13:08.655, Speaker B: I think they could have made life a bit easier. Like this name doesn't mean anything to me.
00:13:09.795 - 00:13:11.615, Speaker A: I like it. I like the ghosts.
00:13:12.955 - 00:13:26.055, Speaker B: Okay, the name is nice, but do you really get anything from the name? So if someone told you about there's a Ghost Token or like GO Token, what would you think?
00:13:27.155 - 00:13:27.811, Speaker A: Honestly?
00:13:27.923 - 00:13:29.455, Speaker B: Certainly not a stable coin.
00:13:30.215 - 00:13:53.399, Speaker A: That's true. But then like you think about make her down die. I mean if you told me die, like I don't know what die is but now like I know it dies. I mean, so I don't think the name really matters. I think people, I think go actually be pretty catchy over the years. I don't know why we're talking about names so much today, which seems to be like the main topic of the show. Okay, next.
00:13:53.399 - 00:13:56.015, Speaker A: Okay, this is my favorite story. Okay.
00:13:56.055 - 00:14:12.915, Speaker B: By the way, before you move on to the next one, like this proposal was by AAVE companies. So again it's like, of course it's Decentralized because anyone can post a proposal. But would anyone say no to AAVE company like the team actually working behind aave?
00:14:16.815 - 00:14:41.001, Speaker A: I hope the SEC is not watching this show. Okay, my favorite little news piece of the week is that Reddit. Yes, Reddit. Let me say that again. Reddit launched an NFT Marketplace on Polygon. There will be NFT based avatar. It's going to be an NFT based avatar marketplace.
00:14:41.001 - 00:15:02.427, Speaker A: Essentially. This is users that are also going to be able to buy the NFTs with their credit and debit cards. Look, this is just. This is. I can't even wrap my mind around this. If you told me two years ago that Reddit would just casually launch NFT Marketplace and no one would care, I would have been like, you're crazy. That would be the biggest news of the year.
00:15:02.427 - 00:15:21.441, Speaker A: And this story happened. And like I read maybe one, yeah, bear market. But like, this is, this is massive. This is what mass adoption looks like. It's. People are going to be going on Reddit and they're going to buy this avatar thing with a credit or debit card. They're not even going to realize that it's an nft.
00:15:21.441 - 00:15:34.281, Speaker A: And then a couple of months down the line they may be like, oh, what is this avatar thing I bought? And then that could send them down the rabbit hole just as easily as anything else in the crypto world could. So I'm just super, super excited about this.
00:15:34.393 - 00:15:46.125, Speaker B: I think there are a lot of common uses between crypto and Reddit. I think many crypto users would be Reddit users and vice versa. So it's like they would know what an NFT is.
00:15:46.785 - 00:16:14.699, Speaker A: Okay, yeah, but it goes both ways too. You know, Reddit's the home for like, both, like both sides of the spectrum. Right. I would assume that, like, a lot of people who really, really dislike NFTs are also on Reddit. So we'll be interested to see what the feedback is from the community. Last but not least, this is probably our June's favorite news. No, no, no, the Polygon one is my favorite.
00:16:14.699 - 00:16:49.779, Speaker A: This is, this is probably you Aztec Connect, a private ZK roll up that allows users to access Ethereum dapps while keeping activities private. It's now live on mainnet. For someone who, like, I personally love to keep my financial data under wraps, I don't necessarily love the open nature of blockchains at all times. Like, right, if you can connect my ENS domain to my address, you know, it's not that hard to do. You can then tell, you know, If I have a huge loan taken out, which it's a bear market. I don't right now.
00:16:49.827 - 00:16:54.915, Speaker B: I mean, it's certainly not hard because you have your Twitter profile as true.
00:16:54.955 - 00:17:10.338, Speaker A: But then like, let's say I had an Anon account and I accidentally had connect. I had accidentally, accidentally transacted with my account with the ens. You know, just. You don't love that tracing capability there. Aztec Connect, a good step to bringing privacy to mainnet.
00:17:10.466 - 00:17:23.414, Speaker B: The best part about this is it's not a different layer of blockchain, so you can actually connect it to already existing applications, which is what I think is like the best use case of this.
00:17:24.354 - 00:17:29.330, Speaker A: Yep, I'm super pumped about this. We may have to do like a deep dive on Aztec someday.
00:17:29.442 - 00:17:30.574, Speaker B: You may have to.
00:17:30.874 - 00:17:33.174, Speaker A: Okay, yeah, you have too many deep dives to write.
00:17:34.114 - 00:17:41.775, Speaker B: You're just like more interesting, more interested in all of this. Like you seem more interested. So I think you will do a better job.
00:17:43.275 - 00:17:57.355, Speaker A: Okay, I'll take the compliment. Okay, next. So we talked about bridging, we talked about the multichain ecosystem. Now let's just talk about Twitter. Arjun, what is poppin on Twitter this week?
00:17:57.515 - 00:18:50.175, Speaker B: Yeah, so in the multichain ecosystem there's like, there's Ethereum, there was Solana that was like really popping off earlier, but now it seems to be the Cosmos ecosystem. Like applications like DYDX migrating to Cosmos and there's just a lot of activity. And recently we've seen like an explosion in terms of IBC adoption. So IBC is like a core piece of Cosmos roadmap because of their vision of Internet of Blockchains. So it is considered the holy grail of interoperate because it is one of the safest implementations for cross chain activity. But the thing is, it is primarily used by blockchains in the Cosmos ecosystem. Right now what we're seeing now is there are blockchain ecosystems across the crypto industry that have begun either implementing IBC or they are exploring the possibilities.
00:18:50.175 - 00:19:31.755, Speaker B: So this section was basically a list of different ecosystems that are considering IBC or like, or have already taken steps towards it. So the first one is OkXchain. So IBC is now live on the OkC chain testnet. I think that's, that's where the confusion comes from. Like they've named OKC Chain testnet and it is confirmed to go live on mainnet within next few months. Then there was a post by the co founder of Near Protocol who signaled support for nep. So this got people talking that near is exploring ibc and IBC might come to near soon.
00:19:31.755 - 00:20:10.129, Speaker B: Then there was avalanche. So the founder and CEO of AY Labs, Amin, he was interviewed by Cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is like a big YouTuber in the cosmos ecosystem. And he talked about how they've thought quite a bit about exploring an IBC integration. Then there's composable finance that's like onboarding chains like Polkadot Cosmos Parachute Kusama parachains to the IBC economy. And then there have been rumors about polygon integration as well. So in general, like a lot of big ecosystems exploring ibc, integrating ibc.
00:20:10.129 - 00:20:23.605, Speaker B: And it seems like just all of this activity is going to come to come into production in the next six months or so and the ecosystem is just going to pop off.
00:20:26.265 - 00:20:36.605, Speaker A: Look, if IBC can get users get a stable coin and start bootstrapping some network effects, I'm just, I'm so bullish.
00:20:37.505 - 00:20:46.565, Speaker B: I think that's, that's what we are starting to see now. Like in earlier it was just like, okay, they have their own ecosystem, but now they're connecting to the other ecosystem.
00:20:47.075 - 00:21:08.043, Speaker A: We're still, at least from my, you know, small brain analysis, we're not seeing like the total users jump. Right. We're not seeing TVL just pop off at the moment. Right now it's a lot of infrastructure being built, but I'm waiting to see the real usage from, you know, retail users from. I mean when's the last time you used a Cosmos chain?
00:21:08.179 - 00:21:33.171, Speaker B: Yeah, so that's, that's why I think it's like earlier it was within their ecosystem. They were very safe, secure, like well connected. But outside of that, the EVM side, they were not properly connected to. But all of this information shows that work is being done in that direction. And as you said, like that's the time like when all of this goes live in production. That's the time we'll see TVL and users increasing.
00:21:33.363 - 00:21:39.399, Speaker A: They're going with the if you build it, they will come technique and I kind of love it.
00:21:39.467 - 00:21:45.555, Speaker B: I mean you have to build it, right? How? Like what's the other approach?
00:21:49.015 - 00:22:12.015, Speaker A: Like Solana. Yeah, form proposal. Right. But like Solana is just like, you know, launch the beta and just like get going. Just like get as many people on the chain as possible and if it breaks, it breaks. Cosmos is kind of going the other way where it's like they're going to build out this robust decentralized system and then, and then bring people on. So there's two different ways to do it.
00:22:12.015 - 00:22:33.815, Speaker A: Okay, so the next second to last portion of the podcast actually is where Arjun and I give out some content recommendations. Arjun will start because he has the real alpha. The first thing he's going to recommend is probably my favorite read of the week as well. It is the Tower of Babel. Good name.
00:22:33.855 - 00:23:13.445, Speaker B: Yeah. So it was just a great thread and an article from the Mizari team. So they explained different types of cross chain messaging protocols. That's something that we've been hearing a lot more of recently. Like cross chain messaging protocols. And this one covers IBC, Axel, Nomad, Layer 0, the usual names that you would expect to see in such a list. So cross chain messaging is like a very complex topic and this one is like a great write up which helps spread awareness about them and just educates people about more than just the name, but like the tech behind all of this.
00:23:13.445 - 00:23:14.865, Speaker B: So a great read.
00:23:15.725 - 00:23:51.925, Speaker A: Yeah, can I just, can I hop in here and just give two quotes from his little tweet thread that I thought were beautiful that I agree with. So first is bridges feel short sighted to me. Many problems like fractured liquidity and honeypots may be solved by leaving assets on their home chain. I totally believe that. Bridges, to me, not enough. You need whole systems. And then the next is, rather than exporting tokens, smart contract networks can import execution instructions to run on top of their secured assets.
00:23:51.925 - 00:24:19.607, Speaker A: This is a big deal. So what a lot of these generalized messaging protocols are doing is they're allowing actual smart contracts to be used on different chains. And that's how the whole interoperable defi thing actually gets built. Whereas with bridges, you can kind of just. It's just you're stuck with the ledger. Like with bridges, it feels like you're just dealing with Bitcoin. Right? You can move token A from chain A to chain B, not that phone, but then you get smart contracts.
00:24:19.607 - 00:24:27.965, Speaker A: And that's why Ethereum is so exciting. Right. When you look at Bitcoin versus Ethereum, that's what I see with bridges and these generalized messaging protocols.
00:24:28.005 - 00:25:00.065, Speaker B: I think the term bridges is like very misused and misrepresented everywhere. And that just shows. Right. So what you explained was kind of liquidity networks, but then we have to talk about wrapped versions of assets moving across chain, where you have to where they're the actual bridges. And then there's like a new influx of cross chain messaging protocols that are also termed bridges. So the term bridges is just thrown out everywhere. But then when you go into detail, you see that, okay, these are not really bridges.
00:25:00.065 - 00:25:03.585, Speaker B: And then we say things like, okay, bridges are short sighted.
00:25:05.925 - 00:25:14.905, Speaker A: I feel like we need to. We should have probably just done a full episode on the Tower of Babel. I think we could have. I think we could have just like done a full deep dive. Anyways, what's next?
00:25:15.525 - 00:25:50.279, Speaker B: Yeah, so there's another article about blockchain interop and the future of cross chain communication. And this one is by Stateless vc. So this one breaks down frameworks and again all these cross chain messaging protocols like ibc. Axel. What's different about this one is it also covers protocols for the future of interoperability. So it talks about projects like Nexus protocol, which I haven't checked out yet, but I will. And it talks about ZK Bridge tech, which is again like considered the holy grail of bridging.
00:25:50.279 - 00:26:38.601, Speaker B: I think we just like terming things as the holy grail of something. Like this is the third time I'm reading Holy Grail of bridging for like something completely different. So. But, but this is a good read. Up next, we have Axelized Learn AMA series. I think this is a great initiative, right? Like there can be nothing better than the founder just sitting down and talking about the project himself, right? So there's like so many, so many write ups, so many blogs, articles, threads, but you can just overdo all of that by sitting and talking to your community. And that's what Sergey Good Bono, founder of Axel, did in this session.
00:26:38.601 - 00:27:05.215, Speaker B: And I think it's a very, very informative session. Next, Arjun Group Rani, as always, has to be featured. So this one is this, this is a Twitter Spaces session hosted by Paloma, so it's called by Secure Bridging Matters and they talk about the importance of bridge security and they discuss different trade offs and bridge architectures in general.
00:27:06.675 - 00:27:14.215, Speaker A: Yeah, this was a good listen. And it's only 33 minutes, so you can listen to it on 2x speed. You're done in 15.
00:27:14.795 - 00:27:40.385, Speaker B: So. So like, I think this one is not for. This one is not one of those where you can listen to in 2x speed because like I've listened to things on 2x speed in general and those are ones that I know what they're talking about, right? So I can just listen and summarize things in my own head. But in general, I think if you're actually reading and learning, 1x is probably better.
00:27:40.965 - 00:27:45.693, Speaker A: Arjun just told me to stop listening to things on 2x speed. I do that too.
00:27:45.749 - 00:27:47.865, Speaker B: I do that too, but I do it selectively.
00:27:49.615 - 00:28:13.015, Speaker A: Okay, fine, I'll Go back and listen to it at 1.5. Okay. Yeah, there we go. Trade offs. So my content recommendations is first of all, everyone go follow 0x postman on Medium and on Twitter. The dude is just crushing it in the cross chain game. Like everything he puts out, I devour.
00:28:13.015 - 00:28:45.875, Speaker A: Big fan. His latest, I think it's his latest Medium post is about the hub and spoke method of validating transactions essentially. And like this just a great little diagram here, right? Like instead of, you know, everyone agreeing with each other, look at that messy network, right? If you just use a nice little hub with the spokes, everyone can agree easier. It's way, way cleaner. That's the whole article. You can. There's like a million different representations of what this looks like.
00:28:45.875 - 00:28:52.270, Speaker A: But I was a big fan, should give it a, give it a, give it a read. But most importantly you should go follow 0x.
00:28:52.433 - 00:28:55.538, Speaker B: 0X postman. 0x postman.
00:28:55.701 - 00:29:24.325, Speaker A: That's true. 0x postman. Next we have a guide, Cross chain Bridges. So if you were been listening to this whole podcast and you're like, actually I have no idea what a cross chain bridge is, this is probably the article for you. It's a great little beginner's resource. I believe it's a sushi swap based article. So love seeing sushi swap Powering the bridging community.
00:29:24.325 - 00:29:55.585, Speaker A: Lastly, we have consensus getting in on the bridging game. They've been pumping out bridging content recently, but they gave a little security guide on blockchain bridges. I thought it's pretty good. All right. And I think that is the almost end of the podcast. The last section is what we call the tldr. I still need a sound effect for this, but it's where Arjun and I kind of give a half baked thesis.
00:29:55.585 - 00:29:58.025, Speaker A: Arjun, what you got this week?
00:29:58.765 - 00:30:33.093, Speaker B: Yeah, so I also tweeted about this and I think like as I said earlier, we like terming things as the holy grail of something. And earlier like when I started reading about all of these things it was ibc. So everyone was just talking about IBC and how that should be the goal. But again that's a. That that only works for Cosmos ecosystem. And now I'm seeing articles, blog posts about roll ups as the best bridging solution that's possible out there. But I think both are correct.
00:30:33.093 - 00:31:00.455, Speaker B: So IBC is the best for the Cosmos ecosystem because it connects chains like natively there and roll ups are the best for Ethereum ecosystem because of how. Because of the relationship between L1s and L2s. So this like this goes into the debate of how multi chain is not the same as cross chain and for multi chain ecosystems we can have different bridging solutions that are more secure and compatible with that ecosystem.
00:31:01.515 - 00:31:41.765, Speaker A: So what you're saying is that you think the multi chain solution. Oh, I think our June might have had a power outage here. Oh okay. So I think I'm just going to power ON since we're 35 minutes into this recording. I'll go to my hot take I guess. But here we have my hot take this week. It's actually not a hot take, it's just a half baked thesis really is that you need to go check out your governance forums Aeon, because these governance forms are getting spicy.
00:31:41.765 - 00:32:43.695, Speaker A: Arjuna and I did a little deep dive last week and just kind of checked out some of our favorite governance forums to see what they're talking about and what we found is that pretty much everyone is talking about some sort of multi chain cross chain idea. We're going to publish a blog post later this week on it, but I'll give you a little bit of a sneak peek. But pretty much Compound Pool Together and Makerdao are all in various stages of cross chain or multi chain planning and we think that's pretty impactful because those are some of the biggest, most well known defi protocols in the space. And if they are looking to do something in the cross chain world then that just adds an emphasis on how important the cross chain world is going forward with that. I mean Arjun usually would come in and like say my idea was bad or something but I guess he's gone so we're just going to pretend like I nailed that. Came in with the landing. With that I think we're going to end it here.
00:32:43.695 - 00:33:16.645, Speaker A: That is the latest episode of the Cross Chain Insider. For more info, be sure to subscribe to the Crosschain Insider, the newsletter that arjun who just DMed me and said that his power went out. He writes this newsletter and covers pretty much every one of the topics found on this pod. You can also check out lefi that is LI fi. We're building the ultimate cross chain money Lego. You can check us out on Twitter at lefyprotocol and be sure to hop into our discord and say hello. And with that I'm out.
