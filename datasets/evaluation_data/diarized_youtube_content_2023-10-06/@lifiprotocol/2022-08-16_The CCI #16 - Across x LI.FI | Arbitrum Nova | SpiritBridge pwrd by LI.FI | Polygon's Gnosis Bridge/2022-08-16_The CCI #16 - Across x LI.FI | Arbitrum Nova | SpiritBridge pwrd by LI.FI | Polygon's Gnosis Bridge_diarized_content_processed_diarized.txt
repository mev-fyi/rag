00:00:12.240 - 00:00:31.815, Speaker A: Hey everyone. Welcome to this week's episode of the Cross Chain Insider, a weekly roundup of all news traveling across chains brought to you by lefi. I'm Mark, a member of the Biz dev team and a music NFT maxi. No matter what Kobe says, my Gigabrand co host is Arjun, the jack of all trades and master of everything here at lefi. What is up, Arjun?
00:00:32.595 - 00:00:38.975, Speaker B: Not too much in the Cross Chain space, but lefi had a pretty active week, so that's good.
00:00:39.635 - 00:01:00.941, Speaker A: Lots of lefi content coming at you here as usual, Arjun. Speaking of content, he writes this news recap as a newsletter on Substack. So you can go to lefi.substack.com and subscribe there or. Or you can just listen to the Cross Chain Insider Podcast on YouTube. As you are. If you're hearing my voice right now.
00:01:00.941 - 00:01:08.877, Speaker A: So Arjun, as usual, let's kick us off with the bridging updates of the week. What you got for us?
00:01:09.021 - 00:01:48.075, Speaker B: Yeah, so Spirit Swap, they launched their V2 beta finally. And in their V2 beta they have a lot of integration partners enabling a lot of different functionalities. And one of those partners is lifi. So LIFI is basically like they've integrated our SDK to power their Spirit bridge. So Spirit Bridge has now transitioned to a full bridge aggregator and this means Spiritual can now easily add any EVM compatible chain and they can also offer the Swap while bridging functionality. So just a much improved user experience for all spirits of users.
00:01:48.855 - 00:02:00.607, Speaker A: Yep, swapping into a native gas token is very helpful because you never have assets get stuck on one chain from the other. I might be speaking from personal experience here. Anyway.
00:02:00.751 - 00:02:17.485, Speaker B: Yeah. So up next we have Ren. So Ren announced their plans to launch REN 2.0 in September. And with 2.0 their main focus would be security efficiency and developer tooling. So it'll be interesting to see what sort of updates they'll have.
00:02:17.485 - 00:02:35.057, Speaker B: Up next we have across and Defi. So across is now live on Defi and users can now bridge with across fast and low cost routes on transfer tool xyz. This is, I think our ninth bridge integration. I'm not sure, something like that.
00:02:35.241 - 00:02:37.385, Speaker A: I think we might be double digits now.
00:02:37.545 - 00:02:40.765, Speaker B: Okay, that's something that we should probably check after this.
00:02:44.045 - 00:02:53.029, Speaker A: I can't remember what our production numbers and what our live numbers are right now. Close to double digits. We're around double digit.
00:02:53.117 - 00:03:21.041, Speaker B: Yeah, we're about close to double digits. So let's see. So up next we have Polygon POS Bridge for Gnosis Safe. So The Polygon team has introduced Polygon Bridge for Gnosis Safe. So this means all teams can now transfer their safe assets between Polygon and Ethereum with this new bridge. What do you think, Mark? This news didn't really get all the attention that it probably should have, but it's just big news, dude.
00:03:21.073 - 00:03:58.965, Speaker A: This is massive. To me, this is a total institutional play, but it's a crypto institutional play. So now any team that wants to move their treasury between Polygon and Ethereum, essentially they can do so, which I think is going to have a lot of long term ramifications. I think this is huge news. I think this is like the DeFi equivalent of BlackRock supporting Bitcoin. It's like NASA Safe and Polygon Bridge. That being a real road where funds can flow through, I think that's massive.
00:04:00.705 - 00:04:40.139, Speaker B: Polygon Bridge actually has a lot of TVL now and there's a lot of importance on it to be secure and just don't get hacked, please, please. So to complete this, we have two news related to lifi. So one of them is LIFI has joined the Cross Chain Coalition. So this partnership will basically enable both the organization's mission to support the Cross Chain Ecosystem and Cross Chain Coalition. Like they're a great team. Just join their telegram channel. They organize great IRL events at all conferences.
00:04:40.139 - 00:05:01.275, Speaker B: So you should probably attend one of those if you're around last. We have lifi. So we've released support for Super Tokens and this means users can now swap to and from Super Tokens and more importantly, they can upgrade to or downgrade from super tokens across all 16 chains on Transfer2XYZ.
00:05:03.695 - 00:05:05.435, Speaker A: I'm such a big fan of this.
00:05:06.455 - 00:05:15.195, Speaker B: Yeah, I think I really like Super Fluid. So I'm really glad that this partnership happened and yeah, super excited for this to go live.
00:05:15.575 - 00:05:17.995, Speaker A: Have you used Superfluid to get paid?
00:05:18.495 - 00:05:30.885, Speaker B: Yeah, I have, I have. But like not. I don't use it extensively. And I'm kind of like, I don't think people understand what Superfluid really is or like what Super Tokens really are. So we should probably do something about that.
00:05:31.225 - 00:05:34.745, Speaker A: Oh, maybe we should do spaces or something with the team.
00:05:34.865 - 00:05:35.525, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:05:37.185 - 00:06:12.457, Speaker A: Interesting, interesting. Okay, so that was the bridging portion of the newsletter. Now we're going to the Multi Chain Ecosystem updates. Let me see if I can choose the right tab here. No, that's one off. So biggest news of the week, I think in the multichain ecosystem land is that Arbitrum nova, the Arbitrum L2 that is optimized for gaming and social dapps is now live and open to the public. It is partnered with projects like SushiSwap maker, Reddit, FTX.
00:06:12.457 - 00:06:31.163, Speaker A: They're all. They're all supporting Nova Chain again. This is kind of another piece of news that I don't think got much hype in the regular circles, but arbitrum launching a L2 specifically for gaming and social dapps. Like, this is big. This is big, big news.
00:06:31.259 - 00:06:45.175, Speaker B: This is big. And at least I know at least two bridges who have already enabled support for Arbitrum Nova. So orbiter and multichain already added arbitrary Nova in like six days, which is great.
00:06:45.515 - 00:07:17.355, Speaker A: Yeah. And so this is like, I really like the idea of app specific chains or like use case specific chains. And I think it's a big deal that Arbitrum decided that, hey, we want to build our own separate network for games and social dapps, which are both going to probably take a whole lot of throughput to be useful. So I think this is big news. I can't believe it's already. I feel like this was like a stealth launch. It just, it went from ideation to going live so fast.
00:07:17.355 - 00:07:41.177, Speaker A: Next is, you know, everyone's favorite subject, the merge. The Gurley testnet successfully merged and POS was executed. I believe this means that the merge is actually coming in mid September. I think there's some weird POS pow stuff that could delay it.
00:07:41.321 - 00:07:52.279, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't understand that debate and I have, like, decided not to, you know, actually go through it. I'm just excited about the merge. I hope it happens.
00:07:52.407 - 00:08:12.565, Speaker A: I'm excited. I'm excited that the Girly test net went so well. You know, I don't, I don't think it's. If it gets delayed again, I don't think it's going to be because of a technical limitation. I think it might be, you know, just community pushback. But yeah, Girly testnet successfully merged. Uh, Cali it.
00:08:12.565 - 00:08:19.389, Speaker A: It. This is another thing that just kind of snuck up. Like we've been talking about the merge not happening and then like, boom, Girly successfully executed.
00:08:19.437 - 00:08:27.765, Speaker B: So, I mean, at least one or two days, my Twitter feed was just the merge happening. So I won't say this didn't get the hype it deserves.
00:08:27.885 - 00:08:53.244, Speaker A: Oh no, it did get the hype. I just. It was just crazy. I mean, eth hit 2k, which like, man feeling rich. Right? My half of an ethical. Okay, so next Paraswap launched limit orders for tokens and NFT trading across a lot of chains. I think this is available on Ethereum, Polygon, BNB Chain, Phantom Avalanche, and Arbitrum.
00:08:53.244 - 00:09:26.575, Speaker A: Paraswap is always out there pushing out new builds. Next. This is going to be a struggle for me to pronounce correctly. I apologize to the teams if I don't say it right, but Symbiosis Finance, which is a multi chain liquidity protocol, announced a partnership with Ben Key and on Chain Liquidity Staking and Liquidity Market Protocol on Avalanche. Users can now use any token on any chain for Ben Key with just one click, I believe. Yeah. Here's the image of this.
00:09:26.575 - 00:09:49.173, Speaker A: So this is. Look, we always talk about abstracting all the technical stuff, all the hard crypto stuff away from users. I think this is a great partnership between these two protocols to do just that. Next, we have some sad news. The Curve finance suffered a $570,000.
00:09:49.229 - 00:09:51.625, Speaker B: It's not that bad. I would say it's not that bad.
00:09:53.005 - 00:09:54.515, Speaker A: It could be much worse.
00:09:54.685 - 00:09:57.511, Speaker B: No, because Binance recovered 470k.
00:09:57.583 - 00:10:02.751, Speaker A: Dude, you ruined my spiel.
00:10:02.863 - 00:10:04.075, Speaker B: Okay, good.
00:10:05.455 - 00:10:34.167, Speaker A: So Curve Finance suffered a $570,000 exploit. DNS spoofing was used to hack the site's front end. However, Binance was able to recover $470,000 of the stolen funds, representing over 83% of the hack. Interestingly enough, this came on the same week of all this Tornado cache stuff. And so it appears the hacker didn't use Tornado cash to try to use maybe a centralized exchange, and they were like. Their funds were immediately frozen.
00:10:34.351 - 00:10:50.901, Speaker B: So I feel like Binance is always there just doing something for security, which is nice. Like, I remember there was something about Uniswap getting hacked as well. And like, Binance was already on it even before the Uniswap team was that.
00:10:50.973 - 00:10:52.861, Speaker A: That didn't end up being a hack, though. That was.
00:10:52.933 - 00:10:57.093, Speaker B: Yeah, I was just like. It was just the Binance team always being active.
00:10:57.229 - 00:10:57.709, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:10:57.797 - 00:10:58.821, Speaker B: Which is nice.
00:10:59.013 - 00:11:04.573, Speaker A: Yeah. But like, honestly though, now that Tornado Cash is, you know, down for most.
00:11:04.629 - 00:11:06.565, Speaker B: Are you even. Are you even allowed to say that.
00:11:06.605 - 00:11:30.875, Speaker A: Word in the US That's a good point. I don't know what I'm talking about, actually. Next. Okay, we have. Man, you almost got me in trouble with the FBI agent that watches this podcast. Next, we have the Acala exploit. Acala Polkadot's Defi hub suffered a major attack on its newly launched liquidity pool.
00:11:30.875 - 00:11:42.755, Speaker A: The exploit allowed the hacker to mint more than 1.2 billion AuSD. AuSD then depegged and at one point fell 70%.
00:11:43.235 - 00:11:47.735, Speaker B: I think it's it's still in that range right now. Like it's still.
00:11:48.035 - 00:12:02.775, Speaker A: Yeah, this is tough. We're thinking of the Acala team, but we hope they get this figured out. This is kind of a Debbie downer of a news item to end with.
00:12:03.795 - 00:12:10.675, Speaker B: See, there's no priority in this news list. Whatever comes. Yeah, I put it there.
00:12:11.535 - 00:12:24.239, Speaker A: Okay, so the next section of the podcast here, Arjun, we just went multi chain ecosystem updates. Next is what is popping on Twitter. Arjun, what is popping on Twitter?
00:12:24.367 - 00:13:13.249, Speaker B: So it was mostly Ethereum Merge or Tornado Cash, but that wasn't so exciting. Right? We've already talked about the merge so many times. Tornado Cash in general wasn't great news for the ecosystem. So I decided to go with something that's actually very good and something that we've been waiting for a long time and we finally have a tentative release, not date but like month for the interchange security. So I think ever since there was a document by Cosmos contributors which talked about enabling interchange security and after that we didn't really get too many updates. So the initial document said September or August or September, something like that. So that was clearly delayed.
00:13:13.249 - 00:14:03.869, Speaker B: But now finally they've launched a roadmap that plans to have interchange security in January 2023. And I think this is just great news for the entire Cosmos ecosystem because the ecosystem is expanding rapidly. Right. They have 250 application specific chains already and with Interchange Security, all of these app chains can basically leverage the Cosmos Hub validators. So it's like you don't have to set up your new validator set from scratch. And in general it's like one of the main security concerns for any app chains right now was because they had to, you know, just bootstrap their own liquid bootstrap their own valid data sets. There was always security concern.
00:14:03.869 - 00:14:17.870, Speaker B: So with Cosmos Hub. Sorry, with Interchange Security, this will be. These concerns will be kind of. Yeah, January 2023.
00:14:18.054 - 00:14:20.101, Speaker A: January 2023 is big.
00:14:20.133 - 00:14:40.095, Speaker B: We have a month and let's, let's hope. I think this, this announcement comes at a very good time because there's a lot of attention on app specific chains with DYDX announcing their plans. So it's like a good marketing push again because if Cosmos needed more attention, this is the news that would get it right.
00:14:40.595 - 00:15:08.737, Speaker A: Yep. And speaking of Cosmos, I believe David Phelps wrote a really fantastic article on Cosmos called the Case for Modular Maxis, which is one of the best titles for a blog post I've read in a while. The Case for Modular Maxis. It pretty much builds the case for Cosmos from the ground up. So it goes like here's why I have Bitcoin. And it's like here's why we have Ethereum. And then it goes, okay, now here's why we have Cosmos.
00:15:08.737 - 00:15:44.663, Speaker A: And then it talks about app specific chains from there and what they're doing with Atom Token going forward with allowing anyone to spin up a blockchain and abstracting away like the deep, deep, deep technical blockchain level infrastructure work away from the end user. And so we'll be getting a lot of retail chains. I'm very interested in what Cosmos is building. But of course I don't think just because Cosmos is hot does that mean that Ethereum will die. I don't think it's a battle. Phrased it like a battle, but completely.
00:15:44.719 - 00:15:50.755, Speaker B: Different architectures, completely different like ways of going about it. So yeah, definitely doesn't feel like a battle.
00:15:51.775 - 00:16:06.755, Speaker A: So speaking of recommended reads, I guess you already started. I know I already started. Wait, that's not recommended read this week, is it? No, it's not. That was just. That was on the top of my head. I read it yesterday. What do we have to speak on recommended reads? Arjun?
00:16:07.175 - 00:16:43.651, Speaker B: So the first one is by the lefi team. Mark and I co wrote this and he was kind enough to let me publish it basically. But the bridge stack, it gives you a snapshot of the entire bridging ecosystem and over the last one year the bridging ecosystem has gone through a lot of changes. So this is like an update on what's going on. So it talks about bridging dilemmas, types of bridges, their design trade offs, NFT bridges. And Mark also published an extended version on Substack. So there's a link in the newsletter and if you haven't just check it out.
00:16:43.651 - 00:16:54.811, Speaker B: I think it'll be with the extended version combined. I think 25 minutes is worth it for getting an understanding of the entire bridging ecosystem.
00:16:55.003 - 00:16:59.875, Speaker A: Yep, 100%, maybe 30 minutes if you're.
00:16:59.995 - 00:17:08.609, Speaker B: Yeah, I think if you actually read it it'll take you like one hour. But Medium said 18 minutes so I'm going with that.
00:17:08.737 - 00:17:09.445, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:17:10.025 - 00:17:37.835, Speaker B: Yeah. So another one is how to build a cross chain Dapp. So I've seen like Axelar is focusing a lot on creating content around actually how can developers use their infrastructure. And there's an article linked in the newsletter and this is a thread so it just talks about all the different approaches. Two cross chain that it. That an application can take and how they can build with axelab.
00:17:38.215 - 00:17:46.119, Speaker A: What do you have all right, so I guess I'm shielding my own bags here but I wrote an article, I.
00:17:46.127 - 00:17:47.367, Speaker B: Think you always do that.
00:17:47.511 - 00:18:18.243, Speaker A: Yeah, it's okay. But I always like to say that I'm shielding my bag. Right. No one likes the guy that like doesn't admit it. So I wrote an article called 10 Reasons to Move assets from here to there which I thought is just a hilarious article title. I don't know, I don't think anyone else has my bad sense of humor but so we spent a lot of time at lefi talking about like bridge design and trust trade offs and like really technical stuff. But like we've never actually written an article about, you know, why someone want to would want to bridge or wrap an asset in the first place.
00:18:18.243 - 00:19:19.759, Speaker A: And so I just took like kind of first principles look at like why someone would want to wrap a bitcoin in the first place. Right. And like the case is like okay, bitcoin natively does not have defi. You know you could maybe say that like stacks or some of the other stuff built on bitcoin is defi. But like you know there's like if you look at the tvl, it's not massive. And so if someone wants to get yield on their bitcoin, if they want to use it as collateral, they're probably going to want to move it to Ethereum which is like the first use case for bridge which is why you got wrapped btc and then from there I would made the case for okay, why else would you need a bridge? Well if you're a normal person and you don't have millions of millions of dollars and you're using Ethereum mainnet, $10 to $50 gas fees for normal defi transactions is just going to be too much and so you're going to be wanting to move to an L2 or an EVM compatible chain with lower costs and well how do you move from one chain to another Bridge of course. And so that was this article.
00:19:19.759 - 00:19:35.795, Speaker A: It was really fun to write. I hope it's fun to read. So you should definitely go check it out. Let us know if you like it. It was kind of written informally and so Arjun didn't like it as much. See, did you see him laugh? He didn't disagree. Yeah, that's.
00:19:35.795 - 00:19:42.983, Speaker A: I've also noticed that I need to use more memes. Way too much text, not enough images. Sorry guys, I apologize.
00:19:43.079 - 00:19:46.315, Speaker B: I think that's. That happens a lot by the way.
00:19:46.435 - 00:20:08.155, Speaker A: Yeah, no, no. Okay, we'll work on it and then last recommended read of this podcast is Jump Crypto. Wrote up a six, wrote up the security stackup, how bridges compare, which compares, I think five or six different bridges on, like, how much. How many validators are needed to con. Is it only four?
00:20:08.315 - 00:20:09.275, Speaker B: Yeah, I think so.
00:20:09.315 - 00:20:17.001, Speaker A: No, it's five. Five. Yeah. Five. Yeah. I read this. I read this, like, how many validators.
00:20:17.193 - 00:20:23.405, Speaker B: Are needed with the font, like, style? I can't read what's there right now.
00:20:24.065 - 00:20:31.445, Speaker A: This was. This chart right here is fantastic. I might get this tattooed on, like, my calf.
00:20:32.825 - 00:20:34.605, Speaker B: Wait, how big is your calf?
00:20:40.045 - 00:20:48.965, Speaker A: Well, like, here we go. Like, this should be front and center on, like, every white paper and every website. Like, number one. You won't find this for consensus.
00:20:49.085 - 00:20:54.745, Speaker B: I think I've read enough bridge white papers, and this is the information that you won't find anywhere.
00:20:55.405 - 00:21:32.905, Speaker A: It's very hard to find. We should maybe make our own chart here at LeFi with all the bridges that we support. The number of entities needed to censor a transaction is much different than the number of entities needed for consensus. I mean, look at Axelar 47 compared to 4. That's pretty crazy. And I think number of entities needed to censor a transaction on a blockchain is about to be a very, very big item because especially as Ethereum moves to proof of stake. I think I read.
00:21:32.905 - 00:21:56.485, Speaker A: I don't think I read. I did read that, like, you really only need, like, one third of proof stakers to censor a transaction, and that's. That's not a majority. So anyways, censorship is going to be a big deal. Moving forward with that, I think that's the end of the podcast, Arjun.
00:21:56.605 - 00:22:15.345, Speaker B: Yep, a lot of content in general. Just check out Lifi on Twitter. There's a lot of content in August, so that would give you a very good understanding of the bridging ecosystem, what's going on these days. And you should definitely check out our substack.
00:22:16.725 - 00:22:39.685, Speaker A: Definitely check out our substack. Man, I feel like we did a quick job today. We got through it all okay. And with that, that's the latest episode of the Cross Chain Insider. For more info, be sure to subscribe to the Cross Chain Insider, the newsletter that Arjun writes.
