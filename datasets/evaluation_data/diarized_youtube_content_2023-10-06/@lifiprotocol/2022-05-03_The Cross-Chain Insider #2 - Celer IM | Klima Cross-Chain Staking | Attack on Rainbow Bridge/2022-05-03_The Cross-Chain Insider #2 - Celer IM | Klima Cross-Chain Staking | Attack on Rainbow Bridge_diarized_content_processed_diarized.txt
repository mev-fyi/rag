00:00:12.680 - 00:00:40.285, Speaker A: Everyone, welcome to this week's episode of the Cross Chain Insider, a weekly roundup of all news traveling across chains, brought to you by lefi. I'm Mark, member of the biz dev team at lefi and the general top signal for the entire crypto market. My Gigabrain co host is Arjun, the jack of all trades and master of everything at lefi. He's the threador extraordinaire, research or of protocols, and the occasional member of the sales team. What's up, Arjun?
00:00:40.585 - 00:00:43.125, Speaker B: Hey. I'm so glad we get to do this again.
00:00:43.585 - 00:01:10.995, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right. So Arjun writes this as a newsletter that goes out every Monday and then we pod about it about 12 hours later in audio form. So you don't actually have to read it, we're just that helpful. So Arjun, can you give us the rundown, the recap, the roundup of what happened in the bridging space this week?
00:01:11.615 - 00:02:11.323, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, let's start with one of our integrated partners, Seller and their seabridge. So seller, they launched their interchange messaging on mainnet this week and this is the IM framework. So with this it's now much easier to build interchange applications. So developers can build applications with the seller IAM SDK and this allows them to have efficient liquidity, utilization, application logic and you know, everything that comes within SDK. So all the technical aspects, they've been broken down into the SDK and they're now available as the seller IM framework. So this basically it simplifies all the interchange interactions for users of, you know, seller enabled applications. And with the IM they also like there was a Dex that launched with the im, like that was built on the seller im, it's called chain hop.
00:02:11.323 - 00:02:59.909, Speaker B: And yeah, that's also live on mainnet. So additionally, Seller also launched their NFT solution package which went live on mainnet and this is also built with sellers IAM framework and it allows developers to issue NFTs with cross chain mobility. So these NFTs can be transferred easily between seller supported chains. Again, like a big week for Seller, one of our integration partners, and with lots of innovation coming from their team, as always, so great week for them. I think with that we can move on to EVMOS and the EVM hub on Cosmos. So they went live again last week, relaunching after their network halt on the original launch date. And users can now bridge to evmos using Nomad and Connex.
00:02:59.909 - 00:03:31.675, Speaker B: So Nomad is the official canonical bridge of evmos and it allows users to bridge stablecoins and wrapped eth, wrapped BTC to evmos. And additionally conext also added support for them last week. So what Connect allows them is any user from any EVM chain can basically bridge 12 months because we have these bridges integrated. I think in the future soon LEFI will also have support for evmos.
00:03:33.055 - 00:03:36.927, Speaker A: Did you get the rec drop in.
00:03:36.951 - 00:03:39.235, Speaker B: One of my wallets? I didn't, I didn't check the others.
00:03:40.385 - 00:03:44.205, Speaker A: Me too. It's my homework this week to go check if I actually got it.
00:03:45.065 - 00:04:25.739, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, moving on, let's move on to Hash Flow. So Hash Flow is a bridgeless cross chain swap protocol and they just went live last week. They've been built with layer zero, a cross chain messaging protocol. And so Hash Flow, they describe themselves as a decentralized exchange and I think this is becoming a common theme now. Like Dexes, they're adding functionality for bridging and they're becoming like cross chain Dexs. So this is great. And also something that LIFI Office from day one I would say because we have bridges, we have Dexs and we have Dex aggregators, all of them integrated into one product.
00:04:25.739 - 00:04:51.647, Speaker B: So we're able to offer such cross chain any to any swaps. So for Hash flow users, they can now swap assets on Ethereum, Avalanche, BNB Chain, Arbitrum and Polygon. And moving on to the last bit about the other partners. So Binance Bridge 2.0 is now live. So Binance centralized, highly trusted bridge controlled by the Binance team. They launched 2.0
00:04:51.647 - 00:05:15.825, Speaker B: this week which currently supports 9 token. So ultimately the goal is to support bridging of all the listed assets on Binance, the Exchange and select unlisted assets. And finally we can move on to something that lefi is specifically excited about and that's the Klima cross chain staking. So Mark, do you want to let us know what this is all about?
00:05:16.965 - 00:06:26.917, Speaker A: Yeah. So Leify is very excited about this little partnership we had with Etherspot where we essentially came up with a way that users can stake to Klima Dao from another chain. So let's say you have wrapped Ethereum on Gnosis and you want to stake that onto the Klima platform, which is on Polygon. That used to be a transaction we counted that would take about nine different clicks and maybe four different dapps. So right, you'd have to go to a decentralized exchange to swap, to swap your wrapped eth to whatever token and then you're going to have to bridge that token over to Polygon, then you're going to have to stake on Klima. And throughout this whole time you're having to go to your metamask and switch networks and it's just this mess of a user experience. We along with Etherspot have just kind of built out this product where everything is happening.
00:06:26.917 - 00:07:00.305, Speaker A: The swap, the bridge, the stake, all in one user interface. And it kind of looks just like this on the place. I mean, look how clean that is. I mean if you were a newbie to the crypto space, you'd be like, oh, I have an asset on Gnosis and I want to stake it on, you know, Polygon. This is super easy. I just click this button. Whereas for US OGs, this would have taken three hours of research and four failed transactions and a lot of frustration.
00:07:00.305 - 00:07:10.705, Speaker A: So I think this is the future of cross chain transactions where you don't even really realize where your assets are coming from, where they're going. All you want to do is do the cool stuff on chain.
00:07:11.495 - 00:07:46.455, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean this is great because it like drastically improves the onboarding experience, I would say. So the Klima doubt, especially for like non Polygon users, if even if they knew exactly what they want to do, which is kind of rare, like you don't know from the get go what you want to do. Even if they know all this, they have to perform nine interactions and that's very complex. Right. There's just so much scope for mistakes. So what this does is it like breaks it down into one product, one interface, five minutes and you can just take on Klima from basically any chain.
00:07:47.115 - 00:08:18.145, Speaker A: Yeah. And just to maybe go into it at a little bit more of a technical level, it's actually pretty cool. So Etherspot is an SDK which, for those of you who have a life, don't know what an SDK is, Software development kit. Um, and it kind of, it's just like a smart contract. So Etherspot allows you to essentially like batch transaction, cross chain transactions into a smart contract. Um, and it's really, really, really cool. Um, do you have anything to add there, Arjun?
00:08:18.645 - 00:08:44.705, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean again like it's all about abstraction, right. So like basically all the steps that were there, like there were two different SDKs, different products. Klimada is a separate thing on Polygon. And now it's like all into one SDK that can be deployed on basically any application. So it's, it's great for others as well because there are so many other use cases that open up with this. Right.
00:08:46.485 - 00:09:22.575, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm, I'm excited to see what we come up with next at lefi. I think there could be some cool use cases for stuff like this. Okay, moving on. So that was kind of like the bridging section of the newsletter. And we will now move on to the kind of cross chain overview. And the first point of news in the cross chain space is that Maple Finance is now live on Solana, which I think is going to be pretty big. Maple is kind of an institutional defi product and it has $75 million in TVL on Ethereum.
00:09:22.575 - 00:10:09.831, Speaker A: And on Ethereum that's not massive. But if you're coming over to Solana, I think $75 million in TBL is pretty big. So I'm excited to see what capabilities Solana unlocks for Maple, just because institutional Defi probably needs high throughput in lower transaction fees. So Maple Finance on Solana, that's just another kind of big time defi protocol that's moving across chains. And this is pretty interesting because usually you see something like Maple go from Ethereum to an EVM compatible, but we're going all the way over to Solana, so pretty, pretty cool.
00:10:09.983 - 00:10:15.189, Speaker B: It's nice to see the ticker change as well. On Twitter, like it says Maple, Solana and Ethereum now.
00:10:15.367 - 00:10:33.365, Speaker A: I don't look at that. I mean that's just. There's some synergy there. We don't all have to be maxis. We can just live in a great big cross chain world. Next piece of news is that stater on Phantom, their liquid staking solution. SFTMX just went live.
00:10:33.365 - 00:11:07.215, Speaker A: And a liquid staking solution essentially means that you can stake an asset, you get a derivative of that asset and then you can use that derivative defi protocol so you can pretty much leverage the asset that you're staking. Lido has been very famous at allowing people to stake their eth and then use their staked eth to do other defi things. This is pretty similar. I think people would be pretty excited about this though. Phantom did have a tough week. So sad for Phantom this week. Moving on.
00:11:07.215 - 00:11:44.945, Speaker A: Something I'm pretty excited about is optimism. The L2 for Ethereum launched a governance token called op, which I do believe Arjun might have been an airdrop recipient, maybe just because he used cross chain bridges. So if anyone's listening and they're like, oh my gosh, how do I get the next airdrop? Maybe you should go to Lei and just bridge places because it's pretty easy to get airdropped these days. Arjun, do you have any thoughts on the optimism?
00:11:45.565 - 00:12:33.135, Speaker B: I mean, first Thing is that it is easier to get airdrops because there are so many bridges out there. And like, the first thing is like you have to bridge to all these ecosystems. Right. So you, not only do you airdrop from a bridge first you can go and like check out all the different applications. And I think the key to getting any airdrop is not to plan for it, but it's to use applications on that ecosystem or that platform. So basically use whatever application you like, bridge you like, and just if there's a token, there's a high chance that you will get, get, get an airdrop. And on the optimism airdrop, it's like interesting to see their approach because they've divided into two houses and it's, it's not just one airdrop.
00:12:33.135 - 00:13:24.053, Speaker B: And you know, it's like it's going to be a recurring airdrop which rewards activity even after the airdrop is done. So that's an interesting way to incentivize user activity even after the airdrop is done. Industry, because usually you've seen that, okay, people airdrop farm and then they just abandon the ecosystem or the application. But in this case there's like enough incentive for everyone to keep using different applications. But I don't know about the different levels based on which they've distributed the tokens and like how if you qualified for three different levels, you get so many more tokens. So that's kind of like you can discuss that. But again, there's no right or wrong way to do this.
00:13:24.053 - 00:13:32.905, Speaker B: And it's like, it's good to see that they've taken a different approach and not just, you know, airdropped a token. They've taken, taken a thoughtful approach to this.
00:13:33.405 - 00:13:49.315, Speaker A: Yeah. So just some alpha out there for you guys. There's still 14% of their entire token supply reserved for future airdrops. So if you haven't bridged over to optimism, maybe you should do so. Arjun, what's the best way that they can bridge over to optimism?
00:13:49.775 - 00:13:55.927, Speaker B: I mean, just use leaf area. You'll get all the different bridge routes and just choose the best one.
00:13:56.071 - 00:14:27.163, Speaker A: Yeah, and the thing is, is you don't even have to like, know what bridge you need to use. You literally can just go to our website and be like, you can click optimism and like, we'll magically take you there. It's beautiful. Second thing about the optimism airdrop, then I'll move on because we've already talked about optimism for too long. Is that. So they split their governance of the optimistic collective. Whatever they're calling it into the Token governance by op, which is their token.
00:14:27.163 - 00:15:02.967, Speaker A: And then they're also having what they're calling the Citizens House which is going to be governed by soul bound NFT holders which are going to very active community members. And a soulbound NFT is an NFT that you get and you cannot trade. Like you can't get rid of it. Like it's stuck in your wallet forever. And I just find that a fascinating way to kind of split up the governance of Token because it allows like non whales or non ogs of a protocol to come in and be able to make actual decisions. So it's very interesting. Moving on is.
00:15:02.967 - 00:15:44.445, Speaker A: Oh yes, so the Uniswap, there's a proposal by the CELO team to port Uniswap over to their chain. I believe it now has 50 million votes. And I'm not sure if that's the final proposal because there's like three stacks of proposal levels on Uniswap, but I'm definitely keeping an eye out on this. Uniswap is now all over the place and is expanding like crazy. So I will definitely not be surprised if this ends up getting passed. And I think they got like 50 million votes to like a thousand saying no. So it seems like it's like, it seems like this is going to go through.
00:15:44.445 - 00:16:11.735, Speaker A: Moving on is. Oh, I think that might be the last portion of that section actually. I was getting ahead of myself. Let's stay on track then. Arjun is definitely the best thread or at lefi. And this week he threaded extensively about a reason to be optimistic. That's not the optimistic airdrop.
00:16:11.735 - 00:16:18.855, Speaker A: Arjun, this weekend was pretty terrible. How can you be so optimistic after this weekend?
00:16:19.195 - 00:16:40.449, Speaker B: I mean. Yeah, so it was a crazy weekend. We were talking about this. There were so much bad news basically from everywhere like the RARI and Saddle Finance exploits. There was Solana that was down for seven hours. Ethereum was congested because of uh, land drops. And overall I think it's fair to say that it was a pretty bad weekend.
00:16:40.449 - 00:17:46.160, Speaker B: But there was one very good thing that stood out. Uh, and it's, it's the failed Rainbow Bridge attack which makes me really optimistic by intended and I think that's the uh. And that just makes me optimistic about the future of bridges and security in general. And before we talk about like in detail about what happened exactly, we should know that the Rainbow Bridge like against the common notion that it's a light client based bridge on both ways from Ethereum to near, but in reality it's a light Client bridge going to near and an optimistic bridge going to Ethereum. So this is a common mistake that people make that, okay, the Rainbow Bridge is a light line bridge, but it's, it's different in different directions. So the optimistic bridge going to Ethereum is key here because the attack failed because of how optimistic bridges work in general. So in such bridges there are independent parties that watch over the network activities.
00:17:46.160 - 00:18:44.839, Speaker B: So these are responsible for monitoring the transactions and challenge challenging them in case they're wrong. And so when the attacker deployed a contract and tried to become a valid bridge, Rainbow Bridge relayer, so he, and then he tried to send light client blocks, one of the bridge watchdogs figured out that the transaction is fraudulent and he basically challenged it. And interestingly, because anyone can become a watchdog on, on the Rainbow Bridge because it's permissionless, an MEV bought that of course, doesn't care about security and only cares about profit. Saw this transaction and front running the watchdog basically to gain the 2.5 ETH in profit. And of course the bot transaction succeeded. But the main thing is that the attack failed and the attacker, instead of like gaining anything, he lost 2.5
00:18:44.839 - 00:19:34.625, Speaker B: ETH, which was paid to the MEV bot. And in the future, I think the Rainbow team will come with like stronger incentives for the watchdogs because otherwise every time the MOV bot could just, you know, front end them and take all the profits or this would make it less profitable for them to play the role of a watchdog in the, in the system. But this is a great example of how an optimistic bridge can prevent such attacks. And it's just nice to see bridge security measures working successfully in practice and not just in theory. Right. Like now we've been talking about, okay, optimistic bridge, they have these watchdogs that can look over the activity and then, you know, basically say that, oh, this is wrong. But now to actually see this in practice and actually succeed in stopping an attack, it's just great.
00:19:36.325 - 00:19:40.465, Speaker A: Yeah. And by my understanding, it really only takes one watcher.
00:19:40.805 - 00:19:41.637, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:19:41.821 - 00:19:50.141, Speaker A: To point out the fraudulent activity and you're good to go. Which is like kind of, kind of really cool when you think about it.
00:19:50.213 - 00:20:33.085, Speaker B: Like, so what, what stands out here is that like in general, bridges, they try to secure against attacks, right? So it's like you have all these security measures that stop the attack from happening at all. But optimistic bridges are different because they let the attack happen and then they like rugby attacker, basically. Then they're like, okay, we saw the attack, we saw that this is the Wrong transaction, so you can't go through. And it just takes one watcher in the system to make it all work. But there are again, there are some trust assumptions to the watcher, like at least one needs to be active at all times. But yeah, I think it's a good. Different security design.
00:20:34.025 - 00:20:43.363, Speaker A: Yep. Um, so, I mean, yeah, and it's decentralized because anyone can be, essentially be a watchdog, if I am correct. Right.
00:20:43.459 - 00:20:47.495, Speaker B: Yeah. So that's why the IMEV bot was able to become a watcher as well.
00:20:48.115 - 00:21:16.485, Speaker A: Gosh, the details of all this cross chain stuff, just so fascinating. Okay, so moving on, we're going to go to the next section of the podcast, which is when we do kind of recommended reads and recommended listens. This week is a little bit special for us because, you know, Arjun just posted his like, major research piece that he's been doing for like what, six weeks?
00:21:17.825 - 00:21:23.705, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, you've been editing for longer, but yeah, like, yeah, six weeks.
00:21:23.745 - 00:21:43.195, Speaker A: I've been. I was his editor. He was the gig of brain. It was wonderful. The topic of the essay, which I kind of hope we can talk about for, you know, maybe two or three minutes here, is that with Bridges, trust is a spectrum. So what does that mean to you, that title, Arjun?
00:21:43.735 - 00:22:23.969, Speaker B: I mean, it just means that you can't say that, okay, one solution is trusted and then the other side is trustless. Right. So everything kind of falls in between, like somewhere in between. It. It's the, it's like the same question, like, how decentralized is decentralized enough? So it's like, how many, like how much do I need to reduce the trust in the system to make it trustless, actually. And it's also like the blog provides a definition of what trustless means theoretically. So that's also kind of interesting because till now we had been using the term without actually knowing like where it came from or like how you can actually define it.
00:22:23.969 - 00:22:30.085, Speaker B: So it was a great piece to work on because it answered so many questions for us as well.
00:22:31.745 - 00:23:25.025, Speaker A: Yeah. And this research piece kind of came about because Arjuna and I were reading just so many, so many pieces of documentation that threw around the term trustless and trusted. And we were like, what is, what does this even mean? And the whole root of this idea is the fact that the root of cryptography and Bitcoin and everything we're doing here is that Alice needed to send Bob, let's say, a Bitcoin. And how do you do that without asking a bank to facilitate that transaction? And now Alice and Bob have grown up, right? Alice and Bob are now whole blockchains. Now we have blockchain A, blockchain B, trying to have tokens go between each other.
00:23:26.365 - 00:23:36.277, Speaker B: Alice and Bob have now grown up and they've started traveling to different blockchains. So that's the problem. How do you make them communicate even if they're on different blockchains?
00:23:36.461 - 00:23:54.579, Speaker A: Exactly. And so this article goes into all the different ways that people are building systems to have these blockchains communicate with each other. So, you know, we have validator set, we talk about validator sets, we talk about optimistic ways that you can bridge. I mean, what else do we talk about?
00:23:54.667 - 00:24:13.255, Speaker B: I mean you're, you're the liquidity network. There's light client based bridges, and there's also ZK bridges, which Arjun Bhopani pointed out that they don't exist. That was his hot take. So yeah, that's something I'll look into further and maybe this article will be readjusted.
00:24:13.755 - 00:24:38.031, Speaker A: Yep. And if you can, if you're watching this on YouTube, you can check out our little graphic right here. It's a great article. You should check it out. Okay, moving on with this section of the pod. Another recommended read that this is actually a watch is shout out to Arjun Pathani actually because he was on this podcast, Bridging and its benefits with no bad and connext. Great episode.
00:24:38.031 - 00:24:51.515, Speaker A: You should definitely watch our show first, then their show anyways. Yeah. And then lastly actually Arjun, it's your turn to talk. Sorry, I get so excited talking about everything.
00:24:51.975 - 00:25:27.961, Speaker B: I mean. Yeah. So there was a post mortem by the Ronin team about like back to building and the security beats postmortem. So they basically talk about like how the attack happened and what has happened since then. And more importantly, they talk about their security roadmap where they talk about audits and working with different top tier security experts. Interestingly, like we discussed, there's no change in their validated based bridge design. So instead of like going down a different bridge design, they've decided to increase the number of validators.
00:25:27.961 - 00:26:10.259, Speaker B: So initially before the attack it was nine. They've increased this to 11. And they're in the process of like onboarding three more validators. And basically they have a target of reaching a number of 21 validators by the end of three months. And in the long term they want to have 100 validators. So instead of like changing the bridge design itself, they've decided to add more validators to the system, which is an interesting approach because there are so many different designs out there right now that you can just, you know, play around, I would say. But yeah, it's, it's, it's, it's their decision and they've decided to go down this route.
00:26:10.259 - 00:26:25.395, Speaker B: And they also talk about the hackers and how the FBI has pointed out that the Lazarus group from North Korea is behind this. And I know, Mark, you have some strong opinions on nation states in blockchain. So what do you, what do you think about this?
00:26:26.935 - 00:27:10.125, Speaker A: So, first of all, I think this shows that crypto has a validator issue. The fact that Ronan can't just find 100 people to onboard onto their validator network quickly and in kind of a trusted manner. I don't want to use that word in this context, but I think you understand what I'm saying. Kind of makes me sad. It's like we're building these distributed systems, but we don't have enough validators to actually secure them properly. I mean, to me, having Bumping up from 9 to 11 is good, right? I'm glad that they're bumping it up, but like 11 is still a very small number.
00:27:11.225 - 00:27:15.825, Speaker B: I mean, I get into that question, like, how decentralized is decentralized enough?
00:27:18.325 - 00:28:15.055, Speaker A: Correct. So I'll stay away from that. You go read Arjun's article and then you can form your own opinions on what is trusted or trusted trustless. You know, as for the North Korea aspect of this story, I am just endlessly intrigued. Okay, on the one hand, it's like kind of crazy that a nation state is attacking crypto bridges. Does that mean that crypto is here to stay? Or does that mean that crypto is like this terribly built structure that these bad entities are going to attack and then it's going to go to zero? I don't know, but it fries my brain and I love it, love thinking about it. I also love the fact that the US government can be like, oh my gosh, look, we track these transactions on the public immutable ledger.
00:28:15.055 - 00:28:24.627, Speaker A: And look, that was North Korea that did this, guys. And they found that out in less than a month. So those are my thoughts.
00:28:24.731 - 00:28:52.695, Speaker B: I think for anyone who thought they could just do away with taxes by not showing it because they're on the blockchain and like on Dexes, this is a great example that you can't. So if the government comes after you, they can and like find whatever volatility, reason, whatever transactions you have. So it's, it's on the government too. If they want to, they can. But as a good Citizen, you should file your own taxes properly.
00:28:54.675 - 00:29:01.285, Speaker A: For sure. And I think with that, we're back to the last part of the podcast.
00:29:01.945 - 00:29:10.365, Speaker B: Yeah, so I mean there's another recommended read which is about the security assumptions and potential concerns with Stargate.
00:29:12.425 - 00:29:14.445, Speaker A: Sorry, I didn't click that one.
00:29:15.265 - 00:29:46.965, Speaker B: Yeah, so it's basically about obviously this is not to fight any project, but it is just good to see people talking openly about bridge security and also educating others on Twitter. And this is a good feedback for the team because if there are really any concerns, they can just go and fix the problem. So yeah, it's like a great insight into how to evaluate bridge security as well. So definitely it's kind of technical for anyone interested, but it's definitely worth it.
00:29:48.865 - 00:29:56.255, Speaker A: Okay, Arjun, we have like five minutes left. What's on your cross chain mind this week?
00:29:57.395 - 00:30:30.087, Speaker B: I mean, I can't look past the optimistic design actually working in practice. Right. So what's interesting for me is there are all these different bridges that are currently being developed. Like I think Philip, one of our founders, he tweeted that there are. He talked to 20 different bridges, 10 or 20. And what was more interesting was none of them were taking the like trust minimize approach to this. So there's so much space in the like design space to work around with.
00:30:30.087 - 00:30:51.585, Speaker B: It'll be interesting to see if the new bridges, they see this as an example and they order trusted solution that the purpose. That's also good. But it'll be interesting to see which side of the spectrum these bridges fall into.
00:30:53.845 - 00:31:25.871, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay, so my cross chain thoughts. You're always so sophisticated. I'm just a degenerate. But my eyes were all over the other deed NFT drop this week, which went down this week. I think over $150 million worth of Ethereum was burned during the Mint. And I saw Twitter was aghast at the drop.
00:31:25.871 - 00:32:17.485, Speaker A: And a lot of the reasons was there were rumors that the smart contract was not optimized. And then Yugo Labs came out and hinted that they were going to build their own chain to move over their Metaverse other side ecosystem too. And people are like, oh, they purposely didn't optimize the contract, yada yada yada. For those who are conspiracy theorists, I would say that Vitalik came out and kind of backed up Yuga Labs and said their smart contract looked okay. So look, anything Vitalik says, I usually tend to believe rather than just the random anon threadors who want to blame Yuga for not having an optimized contract. But I'm going to stay away from it because I have not looked down at the contract in like detail. I've just kind of glanced over it.
00:32:17.485 - 00:32:59.955, Speaker A: Anyways, what I'm super interested about is whether Yugo Labs, if they would have done this other deed drop on an L2, if an L2 would have been able to handle that type of intensity, um, cause I mean this would have been like the biggest stress test ever for optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon, anything. Um, and gosh, I just like, I'm fascinated by it and I really do hope that they build, either build their own chain or try to do their next drop on an L2 because I like, I don't think an L2 has been tested in a way where we know that it's ready to go. Um, and I think that board, Ape Yacht Club is like the first thing that could do that.
00:33:01.415 - 00:33:30.559, Speaker B: I think Polygon has still been like battle tested in that sense because there are so many games they were launching. There was a Sunflower game as well. So they've kind of had experience with this kind of launches. But yes, none of the L2s have been like battle tested as Ethereum has been. Right. So it'll be interesting to see which route they take. Like do they create their own chain? But then they have to take care of the security, they have to pay for all that.
00:33:30.559 - 00:33:37.615, Speaker B: And if they just create a roll up for like an L2, they can pay Ethereum for that security and use it.
00:33:38.155 - 00:34:12.265, Speaker A: I'm definitely rooting for a roll up if they do do so. I will say that apecoin is now live on Polygon. I believe that news came out after the newsletter dropped, which is pretty interesting. And then the last thing I'll say about this is that I think Ethereum did a pretty good job. I mean, yes, gas fees soared, but that's what's supposed to happen when there's crazy demand. The network did not break it bent. There was no rollback, there was no seven hour shutdown.
00:34:12.265 - 00:34:27.525, Speaker A: And so I think it was a pretty staunch showing by Ethereum. Those are my final thoughts. All right, I guess that's the end of the show. We did a good job. We kept it tight this week.
