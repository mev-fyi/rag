00:00:12.760 - 00:00:45.335, Speaker A: Everyone, welcome to this week's episode of the Cross Chain Insider, a weekly roundup of all news traveling across chains, brought to you by lifi, the ultimate metaverse money Lego. I'm Mark, a member of the Biz dev team and much poorer than I was last week. And my gigabrain co host is Arjun, the jack of all trades here at lefi, the master of everything. He's the thread or extraordinaire, the research or of protocols. And you know, I count him as one of my good friends. So what's up, Arjun?
00:00:45.835 - 00:00:50.655, Speaker B: I am also much poor than last week, but let's do this.
00:00:50.995 - 00:01:04.215, Speaker A: Let's do this. All right, so let's start with the rundown, the recap, the roundup of what happened in the bridging space this week. Arjun, take it away.
00:01:04.955 - 00:01:33.433, Speaker B: Yeah. Let's start with one of our integration partners. Multichain. So MultiChain has launched V multi on the Ethereum mainnet. So Vmulti is the governing scheme for Multi dao. And anyone who stakes the Multi token will receive a VMulti NFT. So these NFT holders basically have the power to initiate and vote on governance protocols related to governance proposals related to everything Multi chain.
00:01:33.433 - 00:02:10.273, Speaker B: So users can now stake their tokens and receive these NFTs and earn protocol revenue, which is the bridge fees, as rewards. So in quarter one of 2022, MultiChain accumulated over $3.9 million in bridge fees. So this will now be distributed to all the V Multi holders in the next nine weeks till July 14th. So I think this is a great opportunity for Multi Token holders to earn more by staking the token. It gives more utility to the entire system and the token specifically. Moving on to optimism.
00:02:10.273 - 00:02:40.487, Speaker B: So Optimism has added warp speed as a routing option. Warp speed is a custodial bridge that enables one of the cheap and fast transfer routes to Optimism. And more importantly, it enables users to bridge a small amount of ETH to Optimism. So small deposit amounts accounting for less than 0.5 eth have now become 5x cheaper and 15x faster. I'm not sure 0.58 is a small amount, but.
00:02:40.487 - 00:03:37.433, Speaker B: Okay, let's move on to Across. So across is changing to a hub and spoke model in their V2 update. They haven't yet provided more details on the model itself, but right now the point of focus here is that across needs its liquidity providers to migrate funds from v1 to v2, and this migration will begin on May 23rd. Well, the Medium post says 23rd, but the Twitter thread says 17th so I think this has been delayed by a week or so. So while this migration happens, users can still bridge with across V1. So V1 will remain live until the V2 pools have at least 50% of the total liquidity pools. And yeah, I am personally definitely looking forward for the new bridge design in V2, and I know that you are as well because you wrote the entire deep dive which will become redundant now.
00:03:37.433 - 00:03:38.513, Speaker B: But it's fine.
00:03:38.609 - 00:03:50.089, Speaker A: Yeah, I will. I will also add that if you're one of the first 20% of people to move the liquidity over, you earn 5x the rewards.
00:03:50.177 - 00:03:50.609, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:03:50.697 - 00:03:53.321, Speaker A: So that's your alpha for the week.
00:03:53.513 - 00:04:31.357, Speaker B: Yeah. So the early movers will get rewarded more so. And yeah, let's chat this section up with le. So we had a big week and there were two major announcements. So first, Apps Finance Across Chain Asset Aggregator Dashboard has integrated our SDK. So one of the main features of Apps Finance MVP is their cross chain Defi aggregator that brings together bridges, DEXs and EVM compatible chains into a single user interface. And this basically reduces the knowledge required to use the defi tools.
00:04:31.357 - 00:05:29.115, Speaker B: And this is where our SDK comes. So apps users can now basically enjoy any to any swaps across every chain supported by lefi with just a single click without having to ever leave the Apps Finance interface or application. And we're all about creating seamless experiences like cross chain experiences. And it's great to see the Dial Finance chose Defi as its cross chain aggregation solution and moving on to the audits. So the second big news this week was the two audits that we concluded this week. So I think these audits have been going on for like one or two months and now the changes have also been implemented, executed and everything is up and running. So lefi Smart contracts, they were audited by code for arena and the other one was by Constam.
00:05:29.115 - 00:06:07.865, Speaker B: So users can now basically rest assured that Glyphy takes security incredibly seriously, as emphasized by the two audits. And of course we're also considering building a framework around this cybersecurity measures going forward. So that will also help enhance our security further. And of course like if anyone has questions regarding the audits, they can always jump into our discord and that's where the entire team is almost always active because we never sleep like no one in crypto sleeps I think. But yeah, that's it for this week.
00:06:09.045 - 00:06:33.971, Speaker A: Yeah, that's, that's a lot of stuff going on. Shout out to LEFI for, for popping off this week. Got the Alps Finance and we have the two audits. And if you're paying close attention, we also just. Dataverse, which is a Web3 data curation app, essentially just added our widget to their platform. So, I mean, it's just wifi is everywhere.
00:06:34.123 - 00:06:36.195, Speaker B: I'll be there in the next week's name.
00:06:36.315 - 00:06:39.215, Speaker A: Oh, was that. Did I just ruin a section for next week?
00:06:39.605 - 00:06:40.909, Speaker B: It's an lcd.
00:06:41.037 - 00:07:13.105, Speaker A: Okay, okay, okay. So moving on. That was the bridging portion of the cross chain Insider. We'll now move on into like more of a just cross the cross chain outlook over the last week or so. Let's see if I can talk during this section. That would be nice. So first of all, something that I was very, very, very interested to read is that Interchange Security is coming to Cosmos.
00:07:13.105 - 00:08:23.363, Speaker A: So by my small brain, summary of the Cosmos ecosystem right here. Because Cosmos is way too complicated to be summarized in just a short little snippet of a podcast, what Cosmos just launched is that now anyone wanting to run a blockchain using Cosmos technology, the Cosmos SDK can now launch a chain and they can essentially use the Cosmos Hub validators to do so. And so you don't have to go out and find your own decentralized set of validators to run your chain. You can just sort of plug and play. So now running a blockchain on Cosmos is going to be as simple as deploying a smart contract, essentially, which is like if you're looking into the future and you're trying to figure out how this blockchain thing is going to work, it's going to work because people aren't going to realize they're even really using blockchains. Right? Because it's going to be so simple. And the fact that anyone can go, not anyone, but a technically savvy person can now go launch their own blockchain, not have to worry about finding a validator set.
00:08:23.363 - 00:08:28.867, Speaker A: It's really cool. Arjun, you're shaking your head a lot over there. Did I miss something or are you just excited?
00:08:29.051 - 00:08:50.859, Speaker B: No, I'm excited because this makes the security of new chains much better because the entire market cap of the Atom Token is kind of securing them right now. So currently the market cap is 6 billion, but hopefully when the prices are up, this will be much larger.
00:08:51.027 - 00:09:45.069, Speaker A: Yeah. And just to add a little bit more flavor to this, previously blockchains running on like blockchain Cosmos based blockchains had to have their blockchain secured by staking token. And you know, if it's a proof of stake system, if that staking Token isn't worth anything in the beginning. That chain is very insecure, right? Because it doesn't take much to attack the network for like 51% attacks and stuff Now. Now you can essentially launch with the full force of these Cosmos based validator sets and a $6 billion worth of Atom, which is the Cosmos Hub token backing a new blockchain so you don't have to worry about security from day one, which is like super, super, super cool. And if you hold Atom, this is great because it finally has a little utility. Anyways, I just talked way too much about this section, but we're moving on into the next portion here, which is.
00:09:45.069 - 00:10:22.615, Speaker A: We mentioned this on a previous pod, but now it's finalized. But Gnosis Chain is welcoming Uniswap V3, which is pretty cool. As you can tell, the vote was really close. It was 5,029,243, 4 and 0 against for the deployment of Uniswap V3 on Gnosis. Gnosis is slept on. It is the home of popes and everyone uses popes. Even if you don't realize that you've used popes, you probably have a pope to your name.
00:10:22.615 - 00:11:07.335, Speaker A: Moving on, we have Boba Network. Now this. There's so much cool stuff happening right now. Like this is a fun. This is a fun podcast. So Boba, which is an Ethereum L2 solution, okay? It is now allowing you to use the Boba token as gas instead of Ethereum, which is like we're all about at lefi, we're all about abstraction and aggregation, right? We want like the final retail user to never really know what chain they're on, what bridge they're using, what dex they're using, right? We just want it to be like one click, two click, whatever you're doing metaverse things. It's great.
00:11:07.335 - 00:11:48.609, Speaker A: BOBA just took a major step forward, in my opinion, into doing this by allowing you to pay for gas fees in two different types of token on a single network. And I think this is going to probably be the future of a lot of the L2s and a lot of the roll ups. I'll be interested to see if the OP token for optimism goes to this sort of model in the future. But reading Boba's technical documents here, it looks like they kind of had to work pretty hard to make this work, but it's exciting. And this is also really going to help the bridging experience to Boba, because now you only have to bridge over a single token rather than having to like worry about gas fees plus Boba. Yeah. Do you have anything to add there Arjun?
00:11:48.737 - 00:12:10.377, Speaker B: I mean so not only do users have another option, they will also get like a 25% discount on all transactions if they use the Boba token. So that's I think great utility added to the token as well. And I'm sure. So this was a vote passed by the community. Right. So that's, that's something that the community wants. It's great to see it in practice.
00:12:10.441 - 00:12:40.512, Speaker A: Now that's shocking that a community would vote to use a token. Anyways, anyways, moving on. We have Secrets Shockwave Alpha Main Net upgrade is complete. I dare you to say that three times fast. This is essentially going to allow. First of all it allows Secret Network. I believe the number is 500% to 600.
00:12:40.512 - 00:13:05.741, Speaker A: No, 500 to 600x. Yes. So 500 to 600 times what it previous was on speed boosts for certain network events like NFT Mints and Airdrops which they say the human brain is bad at scale. I can't really Even imagine what 500 or 600x is speed wise. That just seems like a ridiculous amount of improvement.
00:13:05.893 - 00:13:07.917, Speaker B: That's a totally new user experience.
00:13:07.981 - 00:14:07.395, Speaker A: I would say 100%. By the way, Secret is an IBC enabled blockchain. So it's on Cosmos. And so another part of this upgrade is, is that they are kind of laying the groundwork for interchain accounts which will in the future allow for Secret Network is like a privacy focused L1 and it's going to allow for contract calls on Cosmos to utilize the privacy based nature of Secret for certain for center certain cross chain interactions. And I just think that's gonna be really cool because I think a lot of blockchains are open and public and that's delightful. But there are going to be certain use cases where you don't necessarily want the whole world to know what you're doing in this certain smart contract interaction. So the privacy aspect of Secret through this upgrade is cool.
00:14:07.395 - 00:15:05.745, Speaker A: Moving on. Something that if you had listened to, I think one of our first recordings we talked about this as being a possibility and then a couple weeks later, guess what happened? Exactly what we spoke about occurred. This is my first big brain moment in the history of the world. So I guess I should just retire. I'm just done. Anyways, the price of staked ethnic has, I don't want to say really deep pegged because I don't think that the technically correct term for this because it's not necessarily pegged but the price of staked eth through Lido is now trading at a discount to just the normal ETH price. And I think this is kind of odd timing just because we just saw a de pegging of ust, this huge stablecoin from the dollar.
00:15:05.745 - 00:15:45.849, Speaker A: This isn't necessarily the same thing because staked eth is a derivative of ETH that allows you to have. It's like a. Having staked eth is having a promise of eth that is staked to Ethereum 2.0. And when Ethereum 2.0 launches, 1 staked ETH and 1 ETH will be redeemable for each other. However, right now staked eth is trading at a discount perhaps because people are worried about Lido being too centralized or too hacked or for a variety of different reasons to be panicking right now because the market is a little bit wild. Arjun, you're looking at me again like you want to.
00:15:45.897 - 00:16:21.801, Speaker B: I think it's just more panic. Right. So people have started to withdraw their funds from Curve and started unstaking their ETH on Lido. So it's like there will be unbalance between the original and the synthetic pair because people are panicking. People are withdrawing funds. And that's exactly what happened with UST as well. Like not the initial bit, but after The, I guess 10% deep, there was so much panic in the entire ecosystem that people started to withdraw and that resulted in like more imbalance.
00:16:21.801 - 00:16:24.245, Speaker B: And that's something similar that we're seeing right now.
00:16:24.705 - 00:16:43.617, Speaker A: True. But I do want to point to the distinction that staked ETH is very different. It's a derivative of Ethereum. Right. It is not this algorithmically pegged. Like there's no algorithm holding staked eth price to match east price. It's literally like you have the promise to have that ETH at a later date.
00:16:43.617 - 00:17:08.699, Speaker A: So it's, it's different. It's a totally different de pegging situation than what we saw with ust. It is just notable that they happened in the same week. I also, I think I read. I'm not actually, I'm not even going to talk about that. I thought I read that LIDO was going to try to keep the pair trading at a peg there, but I don't know if that's substantiated. So we'll just, we'll just move on.
00:17:08.699 - 00:17:58.785, Speaker A: We won't, we won't talk. Talk about rumors here on the cross chain Insider. The last piece of news, besides me actually getting a DM on Twitter, which you're going to See in my notifications there is that aurora launched a $90 million developer fund to boost defi on the near protocol. So, so aurora is an EVM compatible chain on near and $90 million is going to boost the defi development when you see these funds. In my experience, when we see these funds, we usually see developer inflows to that chain because that $90 million is ripe for the taking. So this just means, in my opinion, Aurora something to watch out for in the near future. Do you have anything to ask in the near future? I didn't even mean to do that.
00:17:58.785 - 00:18:23.345, Speaker A: Okay, next section is. So Arjun here is our chief thread or research or he's up to speed on the markets and every once in a while he throws out a thread. Arjun, what have you been threading about this week? What's on your mind? What is poppin in the crypto industry that you want to talk about?
00:18:24.365 - 00:19:33.761, Speaker B: So I, I don't think like any of us can look past the bear market kind of events last week. And so there was a kind of a theme flowing around on Twitter, right? Like everyone was not talking about making money or like taking profits, but everyone was talking about surviving the bear market to actually last till the bull run and just earn money in that, in that sense. So I wrote about how like irrespective of who you are and what your role is in the ecosystem, everyone and everything follows the same rules. That is to basically survive the bear market and reap the benefits during the bull. So whether it's like investing as an individual or like backing new projects as a VC or bootstrapping a new ecosystem as a chain, everyone's goal is to basically survive. And if we continue building towards the future we envision where crypto is mainstream, we will definitely be in a position to reap the benefits. But the point I wanted to focus on was that if we want to survive, we need to build sustainable systems.
00:19:33.761 - 00:20:59.985, Speaker B: This is specifically true for chains and ecosystems because they host hundreds of applications with teams building on them and they have billions of dollars in funds logged on the chain. So it's very crucial that the chain is secure and it is built to last. And because you know, the inability of a chain to like build a sustainable system can have really catastrophic impacts. Like we saw with the meltdown of USD and Luna last week and how it impacted the entire Terra ecosystem and how basically an entire ecosystem with over 30 billion in assets was wiped out within a few days. So as like builders ourselves with lefi. My key takeaway from the entire last week's events was that while experimenting is, you know, very important for unlocking innovation, it must be done with caution because poorly designed systems will break and the impact will be felt like industry wide and it will set us back years in development basically. So the point of focus here with respect to bridges was that we're in the nascent stages of development and there are so many hacks already and in a bear market and with so much volatility around, things tend to get even worse.
00:20:59.985 - 00:21:44.775, Speaker B: And because we're building such a critical infrastructure for the ecosystem, there's also a lot of, you know, attention of hackers and attackers on these systems and they are kind of like honeypots, like prime for attack I would say, because there's so much liquidity flowing through them. So basically our goal should be always to build anti fragile bridges and systems that can resist any type of attacks. And we should take this opportunity to kind of reflect and build for the long term or we can risk breaking the only rule of crypto, which is survival. So if we don't build lasting systems, I don't think we'll survive. That's it.
00:21:46.315 - 00:22:19.995, Speaker A: Yeah. I was laughing at the beginning, not because I found the crash of UST and Luna funny, but because it hurt. And the only way to, you know, deal with it as humor. Right. But it was very tough to watch. This was a great reminder for me that I hadn't, you know, in the bull market you don't really see this as much, but do your own research. It's a huge, huge, huge thing in this space.
00:22:19.995 - 00:23:02.171, Speaker A: I remember, you know, hindsight is 20 20, just looking at that 20% anchor yield for a really long time and really trying to understand it and never quite like being convinced that it was a sustainable model. But because everyone else was so bullish on Terra, you know, I was like, oh gosh, I must, I just must not be getting it. This has to be the future, right? Like if everyone's getting behind it, I see all these VCs getting investing in it. DOE is out on Twitter just being bullish. They buy bitcoin and I'm a bitcoin maxi. I love it, but it really comes back down to it. Do your own research.
00:23:02.171 - 00:23:27.127, Speaker A: If you don't feel good about where yield is coming from, if you don't feel good about the decentralized mechanisms protecting a system, don't use it. Crypto is not a safe place and sometimes you're best suited just maybe staying on the sidelines, um, and just quietly stacking whatever blue chips you are interested.
00:23:27.151 - 00:23:54.611, Speaker B: In, I mean the sad part, the sad part is so many of us started considering Luna as a blue chip because we felt that it was too big to fail right now. So that's another reminder that nothing is too big to fail. Right. Even though there are like VC's backing projects, it's not a guarantee that it won't fail or break. So yeah, have to do your own research. And there's no one else you can blame at the end of the days because you have to take the L, right?
00:23:54.723 - 00:24:24.885, Speaker A: Yep. And if you're not, if you can't understand where the yield's coming from, you're probably the yield. Anyways, just to add a couple extra ideas on this, just talking cross chain implications, the fallout of UST crashing. We saw this kind of ripple across. We'll call it the metaverse just a little bit. We threaded about this last week. Let me keep scrolling here.
00:24:24.885 - 00:24:55.445, Speaker A: So first of all, cross chain implications, we saw that Luna foundation card ended up selling like $2.8 billion worth of Bitcoin OTC. That's a cross chain event. This is a Terra based organization selling bitcoin to help restore a peg. Bitcoin price shockingly kind of held up. I think it dipped to 25k at its low. Other cross chain implications here is that UST was the largest stablecoin on Cosmos by far.
00:24:55.445 - 00:25:39.623, Speaker A: If you looked at the osmosis liquidity, you had $80 million in UST, I believe at its peak last week. And the next biggest stablecoin Liquidity pair had $5 million, which is just not enough to really back a booming ecosystem because stablecoins are very important for defi. Other than that, you had Anchor protocol was on Avalanche. And as we know, Anchor Protocol was the biggest DAPP native to Terra. And people have just been fleeing anchor like crazy as UST has collapsed. There's almost no TVL left. So we just saw that go over to Anchor to Avalanche as well.
00:25:39.623 - 00:25:51.343, Speaker A: But it was a much smaller protocol in Avalanche. So it wasn't like this terrible, terrible, terrible thing. And then. Sorry, Arjuna, I feel like I'm talking a lot. Do you want to talk about wormhole or do you want me to talk about wormhole?
00:25:51.399 - 00:25:53.743, Speaker B: No, go ahead. I mean, this is your thread, right?
00:25:53.839 - 00:26:33.049, Speaker A: This is, this is my thread. Can you tell? I'm just super excited about it. And then wormhole, the portal bridge. Check out the outbound volume from Terra this week. I mean, this chart is up only that is wild. So outbound volume from Terra also led to a bunch of TVL for wormhole decreasing, which is bad for wormhole, but it's also really cool that wormhole made it out alive and it was a robust enough system to kind of help some people get out of Terra, which I thought was really cool. And then that's kind of what was in the thread.
00:26:33.049 - 00:26:41.885, Speaker A: I'm sure there's like a million different other implications of ust spiraling, but those are just the main things that we talked about. Do you have anything else to add?
00:26:42.265 - 00:26:49.929, Speaker B: No, I think we've covered a lot of different angles to this story, so it's a good point to start with the next one.
00:26:50.017 - 00:27:08.165, Speaker A: Oh, we're going to the next section right now. Okay. The next section of the podcast, as Arjun hinted, is the content recommendations. Arjun's the big brain here, so I will let him go first. Arjun, what did you read and listen to this week that other people should check out?
00:27:09.025 - 00:28:08.447, Speaker B: So I have a thread recommendation by Bartek and it's about like it talks about. Is your bridge censorship censorship resistant or not? So the thread basically starts by explaining how bridges work, which is like most bridges functions by locking an asset on the source chain and minting a wrapped asset on the destination chain. So a good bridge should never mint a wrapped asset on the destination chain without actually locking the funds on the source chain. And similarly it should never lock an asset without minting the wrapped asset. There's a lot of similar terms there, so it would be best to read the thread. But yeah, so the second property is where censorship resistance comes in, right? Because you don't want to log the asset and then have the mint request for wrapped assets be censored. So this particular section requires censorship resistant bridges.
00:28:08.447 - 00:28:52.675, Speaker B: And so there are two ways this works. So either the blockchain you're connecting should be censorship resistant, or your bridge itself should be decentralized enough to let the messages pass. So let's say you're connecting to Solana. So recently we saw with Solana and the Candy Machine whole NFT scene that some validators decided to census some messages. So it is possible that your bridge messages will get censored. But this is different for roll up bridges. Like optimism arbitrary because Even if the L2 senses your message, you can always go and submit the message on an algorithm.
00:28:52.675 - 00:29:48.143, Speaker B: But since how it most bridges are not roll up native, they rely on the operators relaying messages between chains. And if these operators decide to censor the messages, there is nothing that can be done to avoid it. So Batec concludes by saying that the good bridges, they should have a Cheap and fast path and a slower and more expensive fallbacks in case operators sensor messages. So this kind of, this solution kind of provides best of both worlds and also disincentivizes bridge operators from censoring all the messages. I said censoring a lot. But like if you read the thread you'll get the entire picture and it's a great framework for determining if your bridges resistant to such attacks or not. So yeah, that's the big brain thread that I found this week and the other one is a podcast recommendation.
00:29:48.143 - 00:30:16.955, Speaker B: So this is a bit technical, but it's a really good one. As Arjun Guptani, one of the founders of Conex, he talks about bridge security consideration and the best practices. So it's a very like, it goes really in detail about the technical aspects of bridges. So if you're like a developer or like if you're looking at bridges from a security perspective, how to audit them. This is a great place to learn more, I would say.
00:30:17.815 - 00:30:49.871, Speaker A: Yep. And I watched the full hour of it. Totally great for maybe not a lunch break because you actually kind of need to be paying attention to it, but I'd say coffee break. This is a great podcast for any dev or someone interested in bridges. So as for my recommended reads, they're kind of like, they kind of go together here, these two articles. The first is a summary of Arjuna. How does it feel to get your article summarized in a thread? How does it feel? Did you feel proud? I should feel proud?
00:30:49.983 - 00:31:05.185, Speaker B: No, it's nice to see that the message was conveyed. Right. Like whatever we were trying to say, someone can actually summarize it within like 10 or 12 tweets. So that's great to see an entire 3,000 word article being summarized in such a short thread.
00:31:05.485 - 00:31:53.849, Speaker A: Yep. And so we've kind of talked about this article before, but a couple weeks ago Arjun published something about trust in bridges and it's called trust as a spectrum where in bridges you have external validators and federations being the most trusted bridge mechanisms. Then you have optimistic bridge bridges, liquidity networks and then light clients and relays being the most trustless, meaning there are no more trust assumptions added to the systems. So in my small brain I think about this, I think about it like this. External validators and federations, those are just bridges that act like banks. You send money to the bank and you trust that that bank is going to do the right thing and move the asset from chain A to chain B. Great, it's delightful.
00:31:53.849 - 00:32:24.965, Speaker A: And then essentially you get to light clients and relays and you essentially have blockchains natively communicating with each other and reading each other's blocks. And it's just like doing a transaction on a blockchain except you're going from, you're going cross chain. And so that's like the whole trust is a spectrum in like 30 seconds. Arjun's smiling because I finally explained something in a succinct way that sort of makes sense. Or because I'm totally wrong. Which one is it?
00:32:26.305 - 00:32:27.445, Speaker B: The first one.
00:32:29.345 - 00:33:22.495, Speaker A: So anyways, to go along with this trusted Spectrum article, Quant Stamp gave the dark side of defi cross chain bridge hacks and it laid out the different ways that you can attack bridges. And if you go read Arjun's article, you can read about, oh, these are the types of bridges. And then quantstamp goes ahead and it's like, okay, here's how you go break these types of bridges. And so there are four different ways that you can go take down cross chain bridges right now there's custodians that you can attack, communicators, debt issuers and interfaces. Go read the article, you will get so much smarter. And if you're going to be doing cross chain interactions, you need to know what you're signing up for because this is bleeding edge tech. So check out this quantstamp article and definitely, definitely, definitely go give Arjun's trusted spectrum article a read.
00:33:22.495 - 00:33:24.887, Speaker A: Arjun, we are running out of time here.
00:33:25.031 - 00:33:41.435, Speaker B: These two articles are great placed together because you can see the bridges attacks and then connected to what type of bridge it is and what kind of attacks it's exposed to. So the two really go well together.
00:33:42.655 - 00:33:52.635, Speaker A: Yep. Okay, and then the last part of the pod. Arjun, we got about four minutes left here. What is on your cross chain mind? What are you thinking about?
00:33:52.975 - 00:34:24.085, Speaker B: I mean, I'm just kind of thinking about all these like building sustainable bridges. Right. Like the recommended reads are also talking about the same thing. I the what's popping section also talks about the same thing. So I'm kind of sensing a theme here and I think that's exactly what's on my mind. Like how do you make this stuff sustainable so that we're here for the long term? Like we're here building bridges, using them in the next five years and not just the next five months. What about you?
00:34:25.505 - 00:34:32.325, Speaker A: So of course I was just showing a meme off because you know, bear market, I like a good XRP joke every once in a while.
00:34:33.225 - 00:34:35.033, Speaker B: I'm the XRP joke.
00:34:35.089 - 00:35:23.613, Speaker A: Yep. And then I also had this section, this meme just because I like the XRP joke. But also I own a JPEG. I've just been thinking about cross chain NFTs because I don't have much of a life and I'm going to be totally honest, I'm a little bit bearish on cross chain NFT use cases because, like, why are you going to need to move like the whole point of an NFT is that it's native to the chain that you meant it to. And like that's like the cool thing, right? And I'm not really sure why you're going to want to move these NFTs over until there's like a really, really cool game that allows you to sell that NFT on other marketplaces. But I'm just, I'm just not really, I don't really conceptualize the need for cross chain NFTs yet. I don't think there's a killer use case out there.
00:35:23.749 - 00:35:57.873, Speaker B: I mean, like, when you say cross chain NFTs, it can mean two different things, right? Like when you said it, I. My mind went to ghostly ghosts which were like multi chain NFTs. So it'll be interesting to see which use case is actually better. Right? Like, do we take the Defi Kingdom's route, which you have to take for like existing NFT collections. But then there's this another side of things where NFT projects are launching across all these chains. So definitely an interesting topic to dig deeper in the future.
00:35:57.969 - 00:36:09.405, Speaker A: Look, I'm totally interested on how we're going to make cross chain NFTs work, right? Because there's like, there's no like liquidity networks that are going to be. You can really use for NFTs, because.
00:36:09.485 - 00:36:12.893, Speaker B: You have to, you have to use like generalized message passing.
00:36:12.949 - 00:36:37.735, Speaker A: Yeah, it's going to be message passing and then it's like if you're message passing an nft, what's like, what's the real point? But I think I need to do more research. This is just my first take at Cross Chain NFTs. I'll come back maybe next week and I'll have like some positive things to say because I do know that Philip and Max, our CEO CTO, are pretty bullish on crushing NFTs. And I don't want to get fired, so, you know, I need to go do my research.
00:36:39.435 - 00:36:40.255, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:36:40.835 - 00:36:45.643, Speaker A: All right. And with that, I think that's. That's it. Do you have anything else to add?
00:36:45.819 - 00:36:47.427, Speaker B: Nope. Let's wrap it up.
00:36:47.531 - 00:37:12.667, Speaker A: We're wrapping it up. And that is the latest episode of the Cross Chain Insider.
