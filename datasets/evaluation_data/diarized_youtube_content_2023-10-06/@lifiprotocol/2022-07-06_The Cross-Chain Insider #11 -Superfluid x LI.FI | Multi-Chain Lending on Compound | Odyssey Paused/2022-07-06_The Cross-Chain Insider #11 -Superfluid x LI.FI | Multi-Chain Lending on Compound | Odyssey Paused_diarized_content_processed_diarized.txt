00:00:12.520 - 00:00:35.555, Speaker A: Everyone, welcome to this week's episode of the Cross Chain Insider, a weekly roundup of all news traveling across chains, brought to you by lefi. I'm Mark, member of the research and BD team here at lefi and a big believer in the metaverse. However ironic that that might be. My gigabrand, co host and master of all trades here at Lei is Arjun. What is up, Arjun?
00:00:35.715 - 00:00:39.455, Speaker B: Hey, Mark. A lot to go through this week, so let's get started.
00:00:39.955 - 00:01:07.581, Speaker A: Yeah, you did not hold back on the bullet points this week. So as usual, as you can see on the screen, Arjun writes this beautiful newsletter every week. If you subscribe to our substack, you can get it in your email. However, we also spend 30 minutes together every week and record as a podcast. And that's what you're listening to now. As usual, our June starts with the bridging updates from the week, so I'll let him take it away.
00:01:07.773 - 00:01:39.215, Speaker B: Yeah, let's start with some good news. So Ron and bridge reopened on June 28th last week basically, and they relaunched with like improved security after the 25 million exploit. So they now have more validators. They passed external and internal audits, they have insurance cover, they have circuit breakers. So they have a lot of new security features. But surprisingly or unsurprisingly, no new bridge design. So it's still a validator based bridge design.
00:01:39.215 - 00:01:41.251, Speaker B: Let's move on to Stargate.
00:01:41.283 - 00:01:48.047, Speaker A: So Stargate, we're just going to move on from that. We're just going to say there's still external validator sets. That's, that's cool.
00:01:48.231 - 00:02:05.007, Speaker B: So it's, it's not new news. It's like they, they announced their plans last month and apparently no one really had any problems with it. So they just added more validators security in terms of audits and I think that's if they're good with it, they're happy. It's fine.
00:02:05.151 - 00:02:06.215, Speaker A: I'm good with it.
00:02:06.335 - 00:02:43.535, Speaker B: Yeah. So let's move on to Stargate. So Stargate has added eth pools on Ethereum and L Tools, so users can now transfer lp, stake and farm eth on Stargate, on Ethereum, Optimism and Arbitrum. Next we have Superfluid, who partnered with LIFI as its bridging solution. So their users can now use their super token primitive from 17 chains across all the bridges that are supported by LIFI. Do you have anything to add about superfluid?
00:02:43.875 - 00:03:19.353, Speaker A: Dude, this is actually pretty cool. So a super token, by the way, on Superfluids, like design is say you're A company, you can deposit a token and kind of wrap it into what Superfood calls a super token. And then that super token can be Streamed by the second two employees. It's really cool. So like, if you deposited $100,000 worth of USDC on Super Fluid, that becomes a super token and then it can be streamed to employees. I'm super excited to see how cross chain streaming is going to work at some point. We're not ready for that yet.
00:03:19.353 - 00:03:34.365, Speaker A: Right now we're just allowing people to deposit into super tokens from different chains. But cross chain streaming is going to be really cool because we're going to have to have constant movements across bridges and that's going to be tough. But that's like, we need that.
00:03:34.825 - 00:04:02.689, Speaker B: At least we have our first step towards it. So that's, that's good to see. And it's good to see that they've chosen Defi to be part of this primitive. Moving on to hop. So last week was Arbitrum's RDC's Bridge Week and Hop came out on top. Throughout the week they processed over 60,000 eth by 4 lakh. 483,000 account.
00:04:02.689 - 00:04:17.225, Speaker B: So that's a lot of bridge volume. That's a lot of new users bridging to. Bridging to Arbitrum through hop. And maybe that's why they had to stop the event. More about that during the Twitter thread section.
00:04:17.645 - 00:04:22.525, Speaker A: Can you say hop on top a couple times fast? My favorite.
00:04:22.605 - 00:04:47.455, Speaker B: No, it's okay. Let's move on to multichain. So Multichain released V6 of any call. So any call is their cross chain message passing protocol. And in V6 they added new features like permissionless deployment, fee payments and just a, just a lot of new features. So it's like cross chain generalized message passing. Bridges are like the new thing in town.
00:04:47.455 - 00:05:03.835, Speaker B: So it's good to see development from one of the older bridges in the ecosystem and it's nice to see them shipping more updates. And I think you like that design as well or like something on Twitter that they posted?
00:05:04.655 - 00:05:16.439, Speaker A: Oh yeah, it's just where was. Oh, I guess I didn't. Oh yeah, here we go. It's just like a great graphic right here. Like that's. I would buy that NFT right there. I don't know why I would though.
00:05:16.527 - 00:05:17.875, Speaker B: Why would you buy that nft?
00:05:18.455 - 00:05:19.955, Speaker A: I don't know. It looks rare.
00:05:21.945 - 00:05:50.575, Speaker B: Okay, let's. Let's move on to the next news item. So rave names a Web3 username system on Phantom. They've integrated LEIS widget. So what this enables them is to basically onboard users quickly onto Phantom and then just buy a domain name on Rave Names. So yeah, just, just easier and better user onboarding experience all around. And it's, and it's great to see someone integrating Defi's bridge.
00:05:50.575 - 00:06:09.175, Speaker B: Next we have Seabridge. So Seabridge hit a new milestone last week. They've hit $9 billion in transaction volume. $9 billion in totally bridged transaction volume. That's a great milestone. And we congratulate Sebridge. They're one of our partners at lefi.
00:06:09.175 - 00:06:35.915, Speaker B: Yeah. So up next we have Arbitrums. Arbitrum pools, sorry, Hyphen. So Hyphen launched arbitrary pools and users can earn API on Hyphen by adding USDC and ETH liquidity to arbitrary pools. So if anyone's a liquidity provider here, they can go check out Hyphen, which is by economies liquidity layer and they can add liquidity to the arbitrary pools.
00:06:36.075 - 00:06:44.075, Speaker A: Isn't this such a cool tweet? It doesn't exist anymore. We got rugged.
00:06:45.055 - 00:06:46.355, Speaker B: It was there yesterday.
00:06:47.415 - 00:06:49.095, Speaker A: Sure, yeah.
00:06:49.135 - 00:07:07.345, Speaker B: So more news on Hyphen. So perpetual protocol has integrated Hyphen into their bridge into the Bridge ui. So Hyphen is now the second bridging solution on perpetual protocols interface. Right next to transfer to xyz which is powered by Defi.
00:07:09.565 - 00:07:10.109, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:07:10.197 - 00:07:29.845, Speaker B: And so up next we have Terra 2.0 which is now live on wormhole. So Terra becomes the twelfth chain connected to the wormhole network. Formula is just out there connecting everything to everything. That's, that's good to see. So they have good connectivity. Next we have an update on Horizon Bridge exploit.
00:07:29.845 - 00:08:12.585, Speaker B: So the team raised the bounty from $1 million to $10 million. But that wasn't enough for the hackers. So the hacker has started moving funds through Tornado cash and the Harmony team has begun a global manhunt for the criminals who stole 100 million from the Horizon bridge. So they've partnered up with like national level security organizations I think and they probably. So at this point I think it's like a national level security concern as well because they're saying one nation state attacking bridges to fund their operations in a way. And if it, if it goes down to North Korea again, us should be worried.
00:08:13.325 - 00:08:28.225, Speaker A: All I'm saying is that if chain analysis is on the hunt, like I would be worried. Chainalysis is good. So that's, I mean 10 mil for a white hack bounty.
00:08:28.555 - 00:08:34.415, Speaker B: I mean that's still considered. It's still only 10% of the entire amount.
00:08:35.875 - 00:08:36.695, Speaker A: Okay.
00:08:38.155 - 00:09:08.781, Speaker B: Yeah. Up next we have Rubik. So Rubik has integrated. Rubik plans to integrate lefi. So Rubik is kind of a competitor because they're also cross chain swap aggregator. But so they plan to add LIFI to their stack because they want access to our supported bridges and networks. And I think that's a strategic move to say the least because we've added so many bridges and networks and they can just by integrating us, they can basically integrate all the bridges and get access to all the networks.
00:09:08.781 - 00:09:11.629, Speaker B: So that's a good move, I think. But we'll see.
00:09:11.677 - 00:09:27.605, Speaker A: Yeah. And look, I don't really see anyone as like a competitor in this space. Right. Just like I don't think Uniswap sees other Dexes as competitors. I think we're all building something unique and fun and we got to give people different options.
00:09:28.225 - 00:09:36.845, Speaker B: So, yeah, always, always good to see, like, there's no competition in general. But like, as a product it makes sense for them to add something like.
00:09:37.545 - 00:09:46.025, Speaker A: Totally. Totally. Okay, so that is the bridging updates section. Our June really went hard this week. He went. Look at that. That was 12 updates.
00:09:46.025 - 00:10:00.683, Speaker A: That was a lot of updates. I feel so much smarter now. Okay, now we got it. We got to get moving because that was. That was a long section today. So I'll start us off here. We have Margin fi Alpha going live on Solana.
00:10:00.683 - 00:10:14.655, Speaker A: This is. They're kind of gonna. They're trying to be a single interface to trade across defi. That is their dream. You can check that out here. I really like their vibe because it's typed in all lowercase letters. I'm a big lowercase letters fan.
00:10:14.655 - 00:10:46.745, Speaker A: But. So right now they're launching on Solana and they have plans to go cross chain at a later date. Next we have Risk harbor vaults launching on four chains. We have Vaults will support a bunch of different apps. So AAVE compound, MakerDAO, urine finance, FRAX. And they will be live across Phantom, as you see here, near or Aurora, actually Avalanche and Ethereum, of course. Ethereum.
00:10:46.745 - 00:11:08.105, Speaker A: So that's big. Next we have Sandbox going live on Polygon. You can now bridge to Polygon using Polygon's native bridge. The sandbox. If you're listening to this, Leify would love to talk so we can give you more routes to move tokens over. What do you think about that idea, Arjun?
00:11:08.485 - 00:11:09.825, Speaker B: I love that idea.
00:11:10.125 - 00:11:32.121, Speaker A: Yeah, but here we go. Let's see. But yeah, they're using Polygon bridge, which we love the Polygon bridge. We have them integrated into our aggregation protocol so we could, you know, do some fun things with Sandbox, I think. Anyways, moving on. Okay, another. This is probably my favorite bit of news from the week.
00:11:32.121 - 00:12:00.261, Speaker A: It's really nerdy so you have to like. You had to like really be in the know to see this one. But Compound released a code repository for the Compound community that will enable a next generation borrowing protocol. All that can most importantly scale across blockchains. Here is the kind of announcement here. This is part of their multi chain strategy. Compound's actually been doing a lot in this space.
00:12:00.261 - 00:12:42.145, Speaker A: There might be a blog post coming out on this from us in the next week or so. Maybe two weeks, depending on how excited I get. Next we have the Arbitrum Odyssey. I think Arjun might have briefly mentioned this earlier, but the Arbitrum Odyssey has been paused. They are waiting for their Nitro upgrade to reopen the Odyssey. The Odyssey is an eight week program where they're incentivizing users to bridge over via like NFT giveaway campaigns. The first week was like a bridging week where bridges like Levi were used for people to go from Mainnet to Arbitrarium.
00:12:42.145 - 00:12:57.013, Speaker A: Of course, because there was so much traffic. This is good news for Arbitrum, right? There was a lot of traffic. Gas spiked and they decided to wait until their Nitro upgrade so the users could use the chain without high gas prices. I feel like you look like you.
00:12:57.029 - 00:13:03.065, Speaker B: Want to add something covered the what's popping is there. So maybe we can wrap it up here.
00:13:05.225 - 00:13:21.025, Speaker A: Oh no, no, no. We gotta wait. I love saying what's poppin later. Okay, next we have Chain Link going live on Phantom. I didn't realize Chain Link wasn't on Phantom. This was news to me. Like it wasn't news that they were on Phantom.
00:13:21.025 - 00:13:23.217, Speaker A: I was like, oh, they weren't already on Phantom.
00:13:23.281 - 00:13:28.085, Speaker B: Now we've probably taken it for granted that okay, Chain Link has to be everywhere.
00:13:29.075 - 00:13:43.611, Speaker A: Yeah. I actually read an interesting article this week. It might be one of the recommended reads. I can't remember everything Borders Together that was talking about chainlinks, cross chain plans, and how they're going to use data oracles to move funds across chains.
00:13:43.803 - 00:13:49.571, Speaker B: I think they have a whole new protocol for their cross chain plans.
00:13:49.763 - 00:13:52.307, Speaker A: Yeah. So we might need to cover that later.
00:13:52.451 - 00:14:01.761, Speaker B: But their whole community is very actively putting that out everywhere. But like right now I don't think it's in production or it's not live yet.
00:14:01.833 - 00:14:34.299, Speaker A: So it's, it's, it's not live yet. None of the details are public, but there's a few scraps that you can kind of get into details out there. Yeah, but I mean, I've been thinking about this ever since I wrote the Deep Dive on Across, which uses the optimistic oracle to move chains. I'm like, I mean, why isn't Chain link doing this is so obvious now. So there we go. There's your alpha for the week, I guess. Next, Polygon launched Avail, a modular blockchain built to scale other blockchains.
00:14:34.299 - 00:14:41.531, Speaker A: It's EVM compatible. Here's another graphic that looks rare. I would definitely buy that as an nft.
00:14:41.683 - 00:14:43.483, Speaker B: Why are you buying graphics?
00:14:43.659 - 00:15:12.269, Speaker A: I don't know, dude. Why am I buying silly JPEGs? Maybe graphics are the next big thing. Okay, so this is pretty much. I think I might mess this explanation up, but this helps with making settlement more gas efficient. I believe Avail, that's their big deal, so love to see it. Polygon, dude, Polygon just ships. They just keep shipping.
00:15:12.317 - 00:15:24.185, Speaker B: I think by this point they have like too many products to keep up with. So I just hope whatever products they're building they have the right market to, you know, address like people are using them.
00:15:24.485 - 00:15:31.789, Speaker A: I just love that Polygon, which is a blockchain, is launching another blockchain. Like, yeah, they have like, come on.
00:15:31.837 - 00:15:33.941, Speaker B: Three or four different architects.
00:15:33.973 - 00:15:37.437, Speaker A: I know, like they're taking multichain to the next level.
00:15:37.581 - 00:15:39.825, Speaker B: They're taking multi chain in house.
00:15:40.845 - 00:16:09.097, Speaker A: Exactly. Okay, last bit of ecosystem news is that cross chain smart contract on Quicksilver, which is an interchain liquid staking protocol on Cosmos launch cross chain smart contracts. And I think we're going to be seeing way, way more info on cross chain smart contracts in the coming months, just with the IBC interchange accounts getting closer and closer to getting into production.
00:16:09.281 - 00:16:17.525, Speaker B: In the last week itself, I've seen so much news around IBC Cosmos that I don't know if to take that as a signal or just Twitter.
00:16:19.355 - 00:16:25.147, Speaker A: Yeah, it could be a little Twitter noise, but I just. People are looking for the next big idea.
00:16:25.171 - 00:16:30.003, Speaker B: I see like news, like development news around Cosmos and ibc.
00:16:30.099 - 00:16:46.785, Speaker A: Dude, cross chain smart contract calls. That's, that's the good stuff. Like if we're talking about what's going to move the space forward, I think that could be a really bullish.
00:16:47.725 - 00:17:17.745, Speaker B: The Ethereum ecosystem in general is kind of sleeping on Interchange security. So it's like just like how Ethereum security is basically across the layers of Ethereum. So it'll be like Atom security will be across all the Cosmos ecosystem chains. But I Don't know, like, I haven't seen much content around it or like much noise around it in general. So I think it's kind of being slept on.
00:17:18.165 - 00:17:32.065, Speaker A: I saw a funny meme this week that was like, the year is 2052. The entire world of finance runs on cosmos. Atom is still 138, the largest cryptocurrency.
00:17:34.255 - 00:17:35.315, Speaker B: Yeah, probably.
00:17:36.815 - 00:17:49.743, Speaker A: Anyways, tokenomics, they matter sometimes. Okay, so we already kind of talked about the what's poppin this week because we mentioned the Arbitrum Odyssey a few times, but. Arjun, do you have anything left to add here?
00:17:49.799 - 00:18:10.701, Speaker B: Yeah, so it was basically like too much too soon for the Arbitrum blockchain, so they had to pause the Odyssey event until the launch of Nitro. So when Nitro is shipped. So Arbitrum will be basically equal to seven Ethereums. Right now it's like three Ethereums, but yeah.
00:18:10.733 - 00:18:15.333, Speaker A: So wait, wait, wait, what do you mean? What do you mean seven or three Ethereums?
00:18:15.389 - 00:18:18.545, Speaker B: So it's like seven times Ethereum scale.
00:18:19.405 - 00:18:20.949, Speaker A: Oh, so like throughput.
00:18:21.077 - 00:18:25.301, Speaker B: Talking through scale transactions. Yeah, throughput.
00:18:25.493 - 00:18:31.787, Speaker A: Okay, so if you're talking like, okay, Ethereum does 15 transactions per second now, right now you have to do 15.
00:18:31.847 - 00:18:32.989, Speaker B: To 7 very quickly.
00:18:33.049 - 00:18:37.805, Speaker A: Well, I can do 15 to 3. It was at 45 transactions per second, right?
00:18:37.925 - 00:18:38.693, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:18:38.869 - 00:18:42.485, Speaker A: And then so what, it'd be 105 sets times seven.
00:18:42.645 - 00:18:43.965, Speaker B: Are you sure about that?
00:18:44.085 - 00:18:49.225, Speaker A: Okay, I'm checking, I'm checking my math. It is, it is, it, it is, it is.
00:18:52.005 - 00:19:31.364, Speaker B: But yeah, so LB equal to seven times Ethereum's capacity, which will be much better suited to handle such high loads on the network. But I found like really interesting like stats around Bridge Week. So I was on Arbitrum Scan and I saw like, so they have like two graphs. One is for number of transactions, then the other is for number of addresses. So if you see arbitrary, arbitrary scans, you see like the, the transactions going up, addresses going up. And June 27th was like the most productive day in general. So Arbitrum saw the highest number of transactions on June 27th.
00:19:31.364 - 00:20:25.083, Speaker B: They had like 280k transactions on Monday, which is June 27th. And they, the number of transactions basically increased by almost 3x at peak, like during Bridge Week. So a lot of users bridging to Arbitrum and this effect of Bridge Week kind of went on in week two where they had like the DAP week where GMX and yield protocol were like highlighted and people had to use them. So arbitrarim could basically support like normal transactions. But when you use GMX in your yield protocol, you have to do like heavy computational stuff. So when you do that that the network could not support, and whenever the network like Arbitrarium network hits capacity, the gas price increases. Like that's the mechanism that they have.
00:20:25.083 - 00:20:45.505, Speaker B: And because of this it increased to like 1.$5. And the team was just like, it's probably just too much too soon for the, for the blockchain to handle. So they've decided to now delay it until they ship nitro, which I don't think there is a date on that yet.
00:20:47.685 - 00:21:10.675, Speaker A: I do not think there is either. The biggest thing I took away from this chart is that I need to go practice using Boba Network and I also need to list a few of my worthless JPEGs on mainnet that I've been wanting to list for a while, but didn't have the gas to do it because it's pretty cheap right now. Yeah.
00:21:10.835 - 00:21:20.575, Speaker B: So when you see arbitrarium's gas fees compared to like other L2s in that, in that graphic, you can see why they decided to probably stop it.
00:21:21.595 - 00:21:46.733, Speaker A: Just authors editor's note here. Did everyone see Arjun just like took my comment about my worthless NFTs, threw in the trash and then went back into like the actual important things like arbitrary fans. Okay. Okay. Moving on to the next sections, we have interesting reads. For some reason, I thought this section was called Recommended Reads. Has it always been Interesting Reads?
00:21:46.869 - 00:21:49.145, Speaker B: Yeah, interesting.
00:21:49.845 - 00:21:53.629, Speaker A: I've been calling it Recommended Reads for like a long time.
00:21:53.757 - 00:21:54.949, Speaker B: We find them interesting.
00:21:54.997 - 00:22:00.741, Speaker A: So it's, it's a recommended Read section for sure. What do we have on the Recommended Reads portion this week?
00:22:00.773 - 00:22:46.545, Speaker B: Archie talking about like, staying on topic with IBC and Cosmos. So the Cosmos team has basically decided to educate everyone about what IBC is and why it's the. Why it's like the holy grail of interop in the ecosystem. So they've, they've talked about how IBC works, the problems it solves, and it's like a really good blog post for anyone who wants to learn more about IBC from like a beginner point of view. So I found it very interesting. The next one I have was an Update on AAVE v3 after the Harmony Horizon bridge exploit. So this one is interesting because it gives you a perspective of an application during a bridge hack or like an exploit on the entire blockchain.
00:22:46.545 - 00:23:17.735, Speaker B: So what basically happened is during the exploit, the supply on Harmony and Ethereum, the dynamics change because the assets were no longer backed by assets on Ethereum. So some accounts on AAVE v3 took advantage of this opportunity because they thought the assets have to be restored on mainnet. So this gave them an arbitrage opportunity to basically temporarily benefit from the price divergence.
00:23:19.195 - 00:23:23.895, Speaker A: Look at that. 2.8k views is a lot for governance forum.
00:23:24.235 - 00:24:00.361, Speaker B: Yes, I think it's the fact that a protocol has come out during an exploit and basically given us a point of view of how it affects an application. Like any bridge hack. And this is like the contagion risk that we're talking about because assets are no longer backed by anything. So prices move accordingly. And I think something similar also happened during the wormhole hack as well. But yeah, so very interesting in my opinion. Next we have like a podcast by the Delphi Digital team.
00:24:00.361 - 00:24:32.935, Speaker B: So it's. The podcast is titled is the future of Blockchain interoperability Optimistic? So we have Arjun Guptani from Conex and Anna Carroll from Nomad. So they discuss the blockchain interrupt dilemma. Bridge architectures, Nomads, optimistic design and like, they really, really go into like details. So if you have time to listen to it properly, if you have like one and a half hours to listen to all the details about optimistic design design, bridges, do give this a listen.
00:24:33.515 - 00:24:55.249, Speaker A: Yeah. And I have to say, like, if you're in the bridging space, Arjun Bhattani is like, obviously you're like, you follow him on Twitter and you're like, wow, this guy has everything up, dude. Anna. Anna could hang with Arjun. Like, like this was a fantastic combo. Not many people can hang with Arjun. Like, I've heard him on a lot of podcast podcasts and this was, this was good.
00:24:55.377 - 00:24:58.085, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean I would expect that from a protocol.
00:24:59.105 - 00:25:09.601, Speaker A: Totally, totally. But like, I've, I've heard Arjun, you know, go on like other podcasts and he just like runs circles around everyone. Right. But like, I mean, obviously no band is like another OG in the space.
00:25:09.713 - 00:25:10.033, Speaker B: Right?
00:25:10.089 - 00:25:34.565, Speaker A: So like Anna was just fantastic. This is the first podcast I've heard her on. She did a delightful job with Arjun. Next we have Masari. They wrote a nice deep dive into router protocol. You should definitely give it a look. Router is focused on EVM cross chain bridging solutions.
00:25:34.565 - 00:25:42.743, Speaker A: Big fan. They did a great job. Masari also did another deep dive this week that I'm just about to finish reading.
00:25:42.799 - 00:25:48.995, Speaker B: I didn't put that in the interesting section because that's a. Like, you have to be a paid member to do that.
00:25:49.295 - 00:26:23.443, Speaker A: Yeah, you have to be a paid member. But I Just, I like that Masari's diving into the cross chain space. That's the most interesting part of this. Interesting read that they're, they're going deep, deep into the cross chain space. And then last, we have just a little thread here on app chains and their implications for bridges and cross chain messaging networks like Synapse. So great thread, big fan as always. You can go check these out at the bottom of the substack.
00:26:23.443 - 00:26:48.201, Speaker A: Arjun writes, he links to them all. It's very beautiful. And I think that is all we have on the newsletter front. Arjun, we're onto our last section, which you never put into the newsletter. So sad. But it's pretty much just like, Arjun, what's on your mind? So, Arjun, what's on your mind?
00:26:48.273 - 00:27:39.625, Speaker B: So it was the Iranian bridge that was like relaunched and Philip, kind of the founder of Defi, he put that into a tweet as well. So it's like even 625 million hacked does not make us think about bridge designs completely. Like, the solution was to add more validators into the, into the mix. Which, like, works if you have like 100 validators, but they increase from like 9 to 11, they plan to add three more. They'll have 21 by the end of like three months and at some point in the long term they'll have 100. But it's like the attack vectors, they still remain the same. So it's just the same attack can basically happen again on Ronin, but it'll just be harder because there are more validators and like a few more security measures that they've taken.
00:27:39.625 - 00:27:47.805, Speaker B: But I think, like, at some point we need to start thinking about changing the bridge design if something doesn't work rather than beefing it up.
00:27:51.235 - 00:28:20.465, Speaker A: I have very little to add to that. I'm with you. I do think we need to take like a first principles look at bridge design. And I'm super excited that Ronin is increasing the number of validators on their network. Like, that's obviously a fantastic step. But just from like, a first principle is like, what are we doing here in the first place? So we're trying to build systems with as few single points of failure as possible. And external validators.
00:28:22.805 - 00:28:50.031, Speaker B: There'S nothing wrong with having, like, there's nothing wrong with having validators. So when I first read this news that they've planned to add more validators, I was like, okay, that makes sense. But when I thought about it more, it was like, the attack vectors are still the same. So it's like, same thing can happen again. But it'll just be harder. So we don't know if they could have. If the hackers could have basically taken like six keys or eight keys, but they had four.
00:28:50.031 - 00:29:00.275, Speaker B: So they were just like, okay, fine, we're fine with four. So we don't know if they have, like, access to more keys or they can just dig deeper and get those.
00:29:03.055 - 00:29:23.345, Speaker A: And then usually I go again this week, like at the end, like, I talk about what's on my mind, but, like, really, it was. I was really thinking about Arbitrum this week and the Nitro upgrade. We already kind of talked about it, so I don't think I need to add anything to the conversation. Isn't that crazy? I'm deciding to not speak right now. Arjun. That's huge.
00:29:23.965 - 00:29:25.785, Speaker B: It's a new experience for me.
00:29:28.165 - 00:29:30.397, Speaker A: Do you have. Do you have anything else to add?
00:29:30.581 - 00:29:31.705, Speaker B: No, nothing.
00:29:32.205 - 00:29:56.535, Speaker A: Nothing else. Okay. Well, that is the latest episode of the Cross Chain Insider. For more info, be sure to subscribe to the Cross Chain insider on substack, that is lefi.substack.com you should also check out Lefi Li Fi. We are building the ultimate cross chain money Lego that helps power cross chain infrastructure for Dapps. It's delightful.
