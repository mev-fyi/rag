00:00:00.650 - 00:00:46.890, Speaker A: Welcome to Uncommon Core, where we explore the big ideas in crypto from first principles. This show is hosted by Su Zu, the CEO and Chief Investment Officer of 3 Hours Capital and Me hasu a crypto researcher and writer. In this episode, sue and I brought on legendary crypto trader Kobe, who is at cryptocurbane on Twitter to talk about the bullcase for Ethereum and its upcoming catalysts, whether ETH can flip in BTC, and what advisors help Kobe to survive several market cycles to date. Enjoy. Thanks so much for joining, sue.
00:00:47.230 - 00:00:48.714, Speaker B: Yeah, you too.
00:00:48.912 - 00:00:53.150, Speaker A: And our special guest today is Kobe. Welcome.
00:00:53.220 - 00:00:56.046, Speaker C: Hello, mate. Hello. How you doing? Thanks for having me.
00:00:56.148 - 00:01:25.494, Speaker A: I'm doing you know, you have a huge Twitter following and you have been forever basically in crypto. One could say you're a real dinosaur, but that considered it's just crazy to me that I didn't know you until like half a year ago. I only joined this space in 2018. So did you take a break or something or have you always been around all this?
00:01:25.612 - 00:02:01.860, Speaker C: No, I think what it is, is you're a serious person. Are you? You take this thing quite seriously. You write research and stuff and my account just tells jokes. And honestly, they're not even very good jokes. They're like low brow humor. So I think a lot of people see the account and ignore it, thinking like, this account is like, why would I follow that? It doesn't even make sense most of the time. And then after a while it ends up on their feed so often that they capitulate into the follow button.
00:02:02.950 - 00:02:46.850, Speaker A: I actually don't think that's it. But you're very good at the self degradating humor, I must say. No, it's just that for these accounts that have been around forever, there are so many accounts that have like a couple of hundred thousand followers if they have been around for in 2017. But it's almost like an anti signal because some of them are just way too rich to care. They have stopped following the space, stopped learning, they're just selling out. But when I sort of found your account, I thought that it's actually completely different from how you'd expect a large account from back in the day to be because your tweets are actually extremely intelligent.
00:02:47.670 - 00:02:48.926, Speaker C: Thank you very much, humor.
00:02:48.958 - 00:02:53.198, Speaker A: But I'm also taking a lot away from your commentary.
00:02:53.374 - 00:03:40.770, Speaker C: Yeah, I think a lot of the old accounts either changed hands or they truly lost interest and missed out on the run. And there isn't many people that were on Twitter the same time that I was on Twitter that made it through each cycle and capitalized on each of them. I think a lot of those people lost interest in the bear markets. They got wrecked over leveraging themselves in like a period of sideways and really missed out. So there's a few of them, like Angelo is a king and is still half around. Now, semi retired tweets every now and again. Currently 10 million underwater on dogecoin or something.
00:03:40.770 - 00:03:58.310, Speaker C: But I think the majority of those big early accounts, the account ownership has changed hands or they just lost interest in the space and now they're bitter because they sort of missed out on the greatest ball run of all time.
00:03:58.460 - 00:04:19.840, Speaker A: Yes. It's funny that you say this. So tell us a bit about sort of who you are, where you're coming from, but I'm especially interested in how did you manage to sort of rekindle the interest for crypto for so many cycles and for so many years. That's the most fascinating thing for me about you.
00:04:20.610 - 00:05:19.250, Speaker C: Yeah. So I had a bit of an unusual or strange life, to be honest, where I optimized for doing loads of stuff. I optimize for having as many experiences as possible because I believe that variety makes you younger in that every time you have a new memory, you do something new that doesn't blend into the ordinary. You experience it more profoundly and more presently. It extends your life in sort of like a way of multitude of experiences rather than just the same thing over and over and over again. But, yeah, I have a computer science background. Did computer science at Uni, dropped out of Uni to play in a band for a while, went back and finished my degree, did tech startups and in parallel did hobby crypto stuff all along.
00:05:19.250 - 00:06:11.854, Speaker C: And I guess the reason I stayed interested in crypto is, like, I I don't I don't want to be a dude that says I'm in it for the tech, but I find, like, the tech side pretty interesting. So I find that easy to slowly plod along and keep up to date with. And I find the cyclical nature of the market that we've had over the last ten years has been hugely favorable to anyone that was able to address the reality and say, this is sideways, this is a period of pain. During this time, all you have to do is sort of grit your teeth and wait, rather than over leveraging yourself and getting liquidated on a candle that if you look at the chart now, you can't even see anymore because it's just like noise.
00:06:11.982 - 00:06:32.874, Speaker A: Yeah. I strongly relate to what you said about sort of making new experiences. That's one of the things that really shows you how subjective we experience time. When we learn something new, then somehow the passage of time seems to slow down. I think that's one of the really beautiful things about life. Yeah.
00:06:32.912 - 00:06:38.700, Speaker C: I think this is the reason that the guy that started Airbnb said he started Airbnb, but maybe it just sounds pretty.
00:06:41.650 - 00:07:28.890, Speaker A: Yeah, we'll definitely get into sort of your experience through the different market cycles and so on later on and also pick your brain, like a lot of things in the crypto space. But first so I have a question for you, sue, because in October 2020 when we released our episode with Light Crypto. And that did very well, got a lot of attention and a lot of people are still listening it today. And we still get a lot of messages sort of about what we said about Ethereum in that episode. I think at that time we were basically peak bearish on Ethereum, especially you, and six months later you're now super bullish. So what happened in the meantime?
00:07:31.250 - 00:08:10.442, Speaker B: I think as traders we sometimes use hyperbole just for impact, but no, I think at that time there were a lot of inflows into BTC in the ODC market. Bitcoin USD, that was around the time of the sailor inflows it was well before the I think the price was probably around twelve k. Eleven k then. And FBDC was around 00:31. It proceeded to go to around 00:24 before starting to bounce. At that time it was just a backdrop of the institutions are coming for digital gold thesis. And this is something that I still believe.
00:08:10.442 - 00:08:56.040, Speaker B: If everyone comes together and says this is the digital gold, then wow, then yes, then bitcoin will definitely separate from the pack and Fbtc ratio would go down quite a bit. But I think to the contrary of that kind, you've you've also saw a lot of interest in what DeFi is actually doing to challenge the traditional financial rails. And also you're seeing Ethereum tokenomics improve and you're seeing Ethereum community improve as well. So I think in that backdrop, I mean, we can go into it more later in depth about the bullcase for Ether. The bullcase for Ethereum, but I do think the bullcase has been stronger than ever at this moment.
00:08:56.730 - 00:09:28.210, Speaker A: Yeah, I totally agree. And yeah, I think if we have sort of a high level topic for this episode, why not make let's make it unpacking sort of the bullcase for Ethereum. So let's jump into some of the different catalysts and why you think we are more bullish than ever. So maybe starting with ERP one five F nine. So to both of you, how does ERP one five F nine change the tokenomics of Ether and make it more attractive?
00:09:29.510 - 00:10:56.110, Speaker C: Yeah, I don't know the exact number if I'm honest, but I think it's something like if 1559 and the merge were active already, there would be something like 800 new ETH issued yesterday and like 15,000 ETH burned. And the validators receive like 6000 of those ethan transaction fees, which if you annualize works out as like a 60% to 70% Apr from Staking. But if you take a look at those numbers a little bit more closely, 15,000 E burned is gigantic compared to the daily issuance. Now, at the moment, I think it's about 70 million go to miners every day, and about half of that is from inflation like new ETH issued. If it's going down to like 800 issued with so much supply burned, the pure really basic supply demand equation just becomes incredibly favorable to Ethereum. Not to mention that the staking reward also incentivizes people. If it gets to 60 70%, I think it might get to like 50%.
00:10:56.110 - 00:11:40.186, Speaker C: And it incentivizes people that hold ETH to lock up their ETH for even longer, which compounds this supply demand issue even further. I think it's massive and people are not truly factoring it in. And I think they're not factoring it in because ETH two has become a bit of a meme like, ETH too soon, ETH too soon. The merge is going to happen soon and it's like 2021, I think, the current year, and we still haven't merged. I think people are just saying are going like, yeah, this is not real, this is not going to happen ever. But the truth is, EAP 1559 will happen in summer and the merge will probably happen later in the year, so they'll both be a reality by the end of the year, I think.
00:11:40.368 - 00:11:59.220, Speaker B: Yeah, I think philosophically, right, it gets back to the question of what did Satoshi invent? I saw this vitalik presentation at one of the DevCons where he said he invented crypto economics. That's what he invented. And I think that that idea.
00:12:01.830 - 00:12:02.146, Speaker A: Is.
00:12:02.168 - 00:13:28.190, Speaker B: I think, a startling one. Because what it would mean is that if there were a coin that managed to get its community together, to coalesce around its value proposition and also to transact and use it as the underlying chain that they work on, then that would be I mean, basically Bitcoin is also that. And so to sort of compare and contrast their valuations, you also have to compare and contrast how they function in their ecosystem and how they function not just as a store of value in the mythological sense or in the narrative sense, but in its ecosystem itself. And so from that point of view, it's quite easy to see why EIP one five nine is hyper bullish because it represents an assertion that ETH is the native collateral of Ethereum and that ETH will accrue value within this ecosystem and will try to be as sound as possible as something that people will hold. But I do think that there are also good arguments. I mean, there always have been good arguments on the Bitcoin side that ETH is changing too much all the time. But I think that if you look at the stewardess, or not the stewardess, but the stewarding of the Ethereum project, it has been done in such a way that it is generally protecting the rights of ETH holders.
00:13:28.190 - 00:13:33.300, Speaker B: And as long as that continues, this confidence has only been increasing over time by people.
00:13:34.790 - 00:14:36.582, Speaker A: Yeah, right. I mean, people love to point out that ETH's monetary policy has been changed a few times before, and then you have sort of the erratic seeming difficulty bump where Issuance tends to slow down, and then all of a sudden, the difficulty bump is reset, and then Issuance spikes up again, and it just makes for an incredibly ugly looking graph. And I actually thought that the e communities of breaking or if developers breaking this rule that they would never increase issuance for the beacon chain, where they generally added a second issuance. I thought that also back in October that this would be perceived as more sort of breaking this narrative, that you'd never increase issuance, only lower it, but it hasn't at all. So that was one of the things where I would say, yeah, I was wrong. I thought the market would pick up on this and it didn't at all. So I mean, personally, I'm okay with that.
00:14:36.582 - 00:14:37.430, Speaker A: Totally.
00:14:38.250 - 00:15:43.750, Speaker C: Yeah. I think it's interesting because a lot of the core bitcoin maxi camp often cite this as a thing that's bad about ETH and in many ways you can agree with them, right? Like if your goal is like a political or philosophical argument around removing sovereignty, about having sovereignty and removing state from money, then bitcoin is by far your best bet. It's by far the most decentralized and the most difficult to change. Like you saw with bitcoin cash that large, highly influential participants in the ecosystem tried to make a relatively big change to bitcoin and it was rejected. But I just don't think those things are investment. Theses. You can have that as your political belief or you can have that as your philosophical belief.
00:15:43.750 - 00:16:37.286, Speaker C: And you can also at the same time take an unbiased look at how the tokenomics of ethereum change and say that's probably favorable for the price of ethereum which is completely disconnected from unless you're entirely allocating capital based on philosophical or political reasons, which if you want to do that, go ahead. But I'm not someone that you should follow. In that case, I think if you separate those two things out, I think it makes a lot of sense. So I agree with a lot of the bitcoin maxi arguments. Like bitcoin is the most decentralized currency, not having a central financial planner, that's changing tokenomics makes for something that you don't have to rely on a certain group of people. It makes it something that you don't even have to trust because it's going to stay the same all the time. But I just don't think that's an investment argument.
00:16:37.286 - 00:16:39.980, Speaker C: I think it is something totally different.
00:16:42.290 - 00:16:53.798, Speaker A: Yeah, on some level you would think that the goal of every coin is to basically just maximize the value of that coin for its holders. And that's how it wins. That's how it wins.
00:16:53.914 - 00:16:55.570, Speaker C: So everything's safe moon?
00:16:56.070 - 00:16:58.238, Speaker A: You would think so, right, but everything's.
00:16:58.254 - 00:17:01.874, Speaker C: Safe moon with levels of sophistication on top of it.
00:17:02.072 - 00:17:41.374, Speaker A: I would say the other dimension is probably sustainability. Right? I mean, you can design we have learned a lot about basically tokenomics and pumpamentals, if you will, from the first DeFi summer. I would say books will be written about sort of the 101 of how to pump a coin based on that. But not everything is the higher your pumpamentals, the lower the sustainability of the pump tends to be. Right. And I think that's also something that on a very different timescale, bitcoin and Ethereum have to also look at and deal with. Right.
00:17:41.374 - 00:18:07.278, Speaker A: How can you really create the best economics as possible? Because the coin with the best economics for its holders will be and the most sustainable, right. Tokenomics will be the coin that wins ultimately, at least on a very long timescale. And I also think that, ERP, 1559 just dramatically improves the tokenomics of Eve and that's why I see it as a very positive catalyst.
00:18:07.474 - 00:19:17.038, Speaker C: Yeah. What I find more interesting than the pure tokenomics or the explicit changes to supply and demand or whatever, is the attitudes towards these things from both the communities, the holders, the developers and stuff, the attitudes towards how you should approach monetary policy attracts people that agree with the same thing. Right. So it's like these sort of self reinforcing communities where, if you believe that sort of theological satoshi at some point was a central planner and he wrote the tokenomics of Bitcoin and now they exist forever and they should never be unchanged, they should never be changed. It's like that's set in stone almost biblically, then. People that believe that flock to this community. And for people that take a lot more of the Facebook move fast, break things, change things when they feel necessary to be changed, they seem to flock to the Ethereum community.
00:19:17.038 - 00:19:58.090, Speaker C: So what I find more interesting is how over time, those individual attitudes will scale and will sort of grow as a network, because on one hand, as Ethereum ages, it may lose that sort of we can just change things type of approach and it might become a lot more boring and stable. But equally, it might just be something that's fostered into the developer community and just something that exists forever. And for the rest of time you have to read exactly what's happening on ETH week to week, because things might change from October to April.
00:19:59.550 - 00:20:44.262, Speaker A: I definitely hope that it will. I mean, it's good that they can sort of pivot into the better designs and that's what we're seeing right now still. But I would think that they have to tune it down at some point, sort of the iteration. Because already today, if you don't pay it, like if you build a large application on ethereum and you don't pay attention to sort of the governance, then it could just be that some of your competitors get a proposal into the next hard forks that sort of wrecks off your smart contracts. And this is something that should definitely not be the case. You should definitely strive for. I mean, I sort of like how Vitalik puts it with sort of a credible neutrality.
00:20:44.262 - 00:21:39.786, Speaker A: If you build on Ethereum, then you should have the guarantee that your application is good for at least a few years at the very minimal. But moving on, apart from ERP One Five Nine, we talked about the merge, right. And this was basically accelerated by the miners getting angry about, ERP One Five Nine threatening to stage, like, a demonstration of power on April 1. That then didn't happen, but still, it sort of showed the community, let's accelerate sort of the transition to proof of stake. And as I understand, you're probably following that closer than almost anybody, but because of your involvement with Lido, can we.
00:21:39.808 - 00:22:09.640, Speaker C: Talk about yeah, so I was part of the Lido team for the majority of last year and now I'm, like part of the independent member of Dao. No longer a member of the core team, but Vasily from the core team is one of the smartest crypto people I've ever met. Maybe just people. Maybe I don't need a prefix with crypto anymore. They've merged into the same thing and yeah, happy to chat about it.
00:22:10.410 - 00:22:27.510, Speaker A: Yeah. So Lido is a stacking service, basically, right, for e Two, currently on the beacon chain. But then for you, the merge is super relevant, right, because it basically expands your market by like, 100 x or something on Ethereum.
00:22:27.670 - 00:23:37.262, Speaker C: Yeah. The main goals behind Lido were initially to fix the Staking user experience issues for Ethereum. So they designed it in a slightly like a non user friendly way, which is maybe just how they do things. But you can't stake anything except multiples of 32 ETH problem. And when you stake ETH on e two, like, if you stake today, you spin up your invalidator and stake today, you're basically moving your ETH to ETH two, and you're earning rewards that you can't access until transactions are enabled on E two, which is like some point in the future, maybe whenever they've finished up their bits and bobs. So it's like a very big commitment. And 32 east now is a decent amount of money, so it disincentivizes or prices out retail.
00:23:37.262 - 00:24:39.474, Speaker C: That's Ethereum's motto for 2021, isn't it? Just pricing out retail. No matter what you do, you price out of retail on Ethereum. But it was initially to solve those two issues, to create a two way door for Staking ETH and allowing you stake smaller amounts of ETH. In the bigger picture, the primary goal is to solve the competitive equilibria between participating in DeFi, like participating in on chain lending, and securing the Ethereum network. Mostly, if you participate in DeFi today, you can get yields that are greater than the yield you'll get from staking your Ethereum. So any self interested, rational actor would take the higher yield available from DFI than securing the ETH network and getting your 12% or whatever you get today. Lido allows you to compound those yields so you can stake your Ethereum.
00:24:39.474 - 00:25:24.938, Speaker C: You get an on chain derivative of staked, an ERC 20 that represents your staked Ethereum, which you could then use in DFI. So if you follow this train of thought, you can imagine that some point in the future the new base currency on ethereum would be staked ethereum rather than ethereum because it can do everything that you can do everything that ethereum can do except you get the base yield. You get the sort of risk free yield. I did air quotations. No one can actually see me, can they? You get the base yield on your ETH and it's already like ERC, 20 wrapped for DFI and stuff. So that's the core purpose behind Lido for anyone that is listening that doesn't know what it is or why it was created.
00:25:25.054 - 00:25:33.190, Speaker A: And how is that going so far? How do you see adoption using the beacon chain and especially adoption of the staked ETH? Token?
00:25:33.610 - 00:27:06.778, Speaker C: Yeah, so I think about 7% of all ETH staked is staked with Lido at the moment and nearly all the other staked ETH is staked with either Kraken Binance, Swiss or like Steakfish. So a lot of the big exchanges have gigantic market share and it sort of makes sense, right, because the way Staking was designed with these huge lockups and lack of liquidity, the ability to unstake was a perfect set up for exchanges to launch a centralized Staking derivative like you can unstake within their own centralized market. So of course they can provide a superior experience to solo Staking or joining some pool. So I think Lido is the only or a Staking derivative on chain. Staking derivative is the only Staking option that can match and is probably superior to exchange Staking. So I think the adoption has been pretty good because of that. There's billions of dollars in Lido now, I think just like over a billion dollars staked in Lido.
00:27:06.778 - 00:28:07.902, Speaker C: And there's a gigantic curve pool of ETH to staked ETH so that if you want to unstake by selling your ERC 20 staked ETH, you can do that with relatively little slippage. I think at the moment you lose less than half a percent by doing so. But you've also seen a lot of on chain staking derivatives that have tried to do it not reached sufficient liquidity and their users just get wrecked. If you stake and then you try and unstake, you immediately lose 15%. So I think having the liquidity around the two way door is super important and I'm glad that Lido's been able to achieve that. And being the generally accepted Staking solution early is pretty helpful. After the merge happens, the product gets much more interesting because you no longer have price risk when unstaking.
00:28:07.902 - 00:29:10.170, Speaker C: You can stake, you can unstake after the merge transactions are enabled. At that point the product starts to come into its own, but it also loses the moat of competitors can now vampiretack you much more easily. Competitors can provide better products and the 1 billion in liquidity that's in Lido is no longer stuck there by the properties of the merge. But in the future I can definitely see a time where instead of you have your optimism and your arbitram or whatever, roll up takes market share, and in that roll up you use stake teeth as your base currency and you earn a yield on whatever you're doing in Ethereum, whether you're trading, whether you're providing liquidity somewhere. I can imagine that being the future. It brings a question on why didn't ETH build this native into the protocol.
00:29:11.310 - 00:29:15.840, Speaker A: So do you have any thoughts on the merge to ETH two?
00:29:16.210 - 00:30:18.402, Speaker B: Yeah, I think I definitely agree that with staking derivatives on ETH, it's going to be quite a lot of winner tick all effects. Because like you mentioned, with liquidity, everyone wants to stake where everyone else is staking that that's how you ensure the liquidity process. If you go into a pool that not that many people are going into, you're taking so much risk for zero gain. There's no upside and only downside. Right? So that I think people should consider. I think also with the merge itself, it's going to be really interesting to see what happens. There's some people who've been asking, is there going to be a proof of work fork of ethereum? Is there going to be our miners going to protest all this kind of stuff? And I really do think if there is a fork, it's not going to do very well at all because who would support it at this point and who would be incentivized to support it? It's very few people.
00:30:18.402 - 00:31:13.380, Speaker B: Right. So it's very hard to see how the merge will get stopped by forces that be that will say, I don't like the fact that POW is being turned off just because I think the general strength of the ethereum ecosystem now is so strong with the application layer and with the status of the Ethereum Foundation and I think with the certainty they have on the roadmap now and that the community is behind it. I think there was a time a year and a half ago, two years ago, where people would have said, just cancel ETH two, cancel ETH proof of stake, just do like 1.5 x or one point x and then do proof of work plus roll ups and that's done. Right. I think that there was a time where that was a popular view among very large ETH holders that that would be the right way to do things.
00:31:14.070 - 00:31:15.478, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree.
00:31:15.564 - 00:31:51.386, Speaker B: I think now that's definitely shifted where there's a resurgence of interest in this ultrasound money thesis and this idea that ETH sufficiently differentiates itself from bitcoin by being purely proof of stake. So I think that you'll hear that narrative a lot at that time where they can start extolling some of the benefits of being purely proof of stake. There are, of course, also downsides, but it opens up a whole narrative mind space, I guess. So it's going to be interesting to see how that develops.
00:31:51.498 - 00:31:56.740, Speaker A: How would you compare proof of work and proof of stake also in that sort of the eyes of the market, especially?
00:31:57.350 - 00:33:13.770, Speaker B: Yeah, I think if you ask people two, three, four or five years ago, there was a lot more respect for proof of work than there is now. It used to be that it's unforgivably scarce, it's creating this unforgettable quality from the physical world, it's bringing that cost into the system. But with the launch of a lot of these proof of stake networks like polkadot, cosmos and so on, solana, it just has moved the overton window so far to the direction of saying proof of stake is just one other consensus mechanism. And so that normalization of proof of stake, I think, has been actually. I mean, given the issues that EOS had with its proof of stake, with its delegated proof of stake network, there also was a time where it looked like proof of work. Would the proof of work maximalists seemed like they had a good argument. And it could also be that proof of stake hasn't even been around long enough that we've seen to test some of the edge cases.
00:33:13.770 - 00:34:01.770, Speaker B: But where it is now, the market is comfortable with proof of stake, put it that way. They're comfortable with high staking rates, they're comfortable with the governance around them, roughly. And so I think the market, in a way, views proof of work as a bit archaic. I think that's why you haven't seen new proof of work launches. The main ones that have launched during this bull bear market, Grin and the two member wibble coins, Grin and Beam, they've absolutely collapsed. You saw the FPGA based ones like Kadena, and those have also absolutely just not going anywhere. And so there's almost this idea now that if you launch a new proof of work coin, you're like wasting it's like an incredible waste.
00:34:01.770 - 00:34:05.034, Speaker B: So that's been interesting to see.
00:34:05.232 - 00:34:45.990, Speaker A: So the market definitely sees it as archaic. And so proof of work definitely has an increasing image problem, I would say also with the rising impact investing environmental narrative behind it. But there's also just sort of the mechanistic the supply and demand argument behind it, because in proof of work, you do actually leak value out of the system constantly, every year. Right. Because you pay sort of parties that are external to the system that are not your own holders, whereas proof of stake sort of completely eliminates that. Right. So there's just far less selling pressure.
00:34:45.990 - 00:35:09.520, Speaker A: So I would say that even I increasingly think even if proof of stake, like proof of stake can be less robust, but it probably still win unless it's far less robust, but there's some margin there where it can be less robust but still win just because it's so much more attractive for holders, basically.
00:35:09.970 - 00:35:48.650, Speaker C: Yeah, I do think it's a big dynamic shift of the majority of inflation to miners versus. The majority of inflation to large holders, it does make a difference, like who's holding the stuff and who's therefore going to be selling it. But honestly, I don't know enough about the economics of the miners business. I always just see it here on Twitter or on some on chain analytics Telegram group that the miners are dumping. That's all I ever hear. But I was surprised the other day someone said that after 1559 in the merge, ethereum will have lower issuance than Bitcoin. And I was like, Wait.
00:35:48.650 - 00:35:57.134, Speaker C: Ethereum has higher issuance than bitcoin. How is this possible? It's so much smaller. I was like, Wait, this is super bearish. That's crazy.
00:35:57.172 - 00:35:59.310, Speaker A: That only in percent, right?
00:35:59.460 - 00:36:31.706, Speaker C: Yeah, but it's still crazy that inflation is so high and that 50% of the reward per block is from fees. I think it's over 50% of the average reward per block is not from direct mining reward, it's instead from fees, which just seems enormous. 35 million a day or something.
00:36:31.808 - 00:36:54.818, Speaker A: Yeah, right. This is something that people didn't really see coming. Most people anyway, that nowadays miners earn revenue from three sources, the inflation then seller their transaction. I would call them like congestion fees. Just people wanting to get into the block. They just want to be included. Doesn't matter at what place in the block, they just want to get in.
00:36:54.818 - 00:37:46.160, Speaker A: And then you have the mev, right? So that the value from miners getting transactions in early in a block, making arbitrage in DeFi liquidations and so on, just getting to stuff early. And this has been grown at such an enormous pace. And this sort of hypercharges the whole proof of stake narrative. Right? Because proof of stake internalizes all the money that currently goes to miners. And miners just found this sort of unexpected but huge revenue source that's in itself bigger than the inflation and the fees combined on most days in the last six months. And all of this money would then also go to stakers. And that's just such a powerful thing.
00:37:46.950 - 00:38:45.234, Speaker C: Yeah. Mev after the merge is going to be pretty interesting because validators who can extract mev are going to be able to compound their stake and earn more yield compared to regular validators. You can imagine there's going to be an arms race, in a way, because exchanges are going to need to do this so that they can have a competitive offering on yield. Also, like the products like lido, anything where there's a pool is in a good spot because the ODS of proposing a block has a lot of variance. So pools extracting mev together are going to outperform, I think, and then in e two, you know, the slot proposal in advance, about 1015 minutes, twelve minutes in advance, I think. So it can be a literal arms race, like to parallelize who's coming up with the best ordering. Max mev extraction, unique strategies, pools of pools, services centered around all this.
00:38:45.234 - 00:39:25.218, Speaker C: It's going to be like, I don't think people have thought about that enough. Maybe people have and I haven't read a good piece on it yet, or I don't follow the right people, but I think there's an Mev arms race is on the way and I don't really know how to position properly for that yet. I think Lido has a pretty good position in that there's a Validator set of extremely high quality Validators working in a pool together. I just don't know how to position for that yet otherwise, but I think it's going to be super interesting over this year.
00:39:25.384 - 00:39:39.194, Speaker A: So the Validators that currently work with Lido, the largest ones, do you have any insights into if they are already preparing and thinking very hard about how to extract the most Mev after the merge?
00:39:39.342 - 00:40:41.274, Speaker C: Yeah, I don't know. I think it's also going to be interesting because I don't entirely understand how the roll up stuff is going to interact with it as well. I think we're going to see elimination of a lot of the unsavory mev pretty soon. But yeah, on the question about the Validators, I know some people in Lido have been thinking about it, some of the people at Paradigm have been thinking about it a lot and I think Lido and Flashbots are chatting to each other on a per validator basis. I'm not sure. I know Ptp.org has some special software in a bunch of their networks and that's why they offer a higher yield for a bunch of their protocols than a lot of the exchanges do.
00:40:41.274 - 00:40:53.440, Speaker C: So I think it's like if you stake polka dot with Ptp.org versus Kraken, you get like double@ptp.org or something. So I'm sure, yeah, individual Validators are working on it a bunch as well.
00:40:54.130 - 00:41:16.162, Speaker A: Okay, so we discussed ERP 1559 and the E Two merge as potential catalysts for ethereum in the next, like six to twelve months. Sue, do you think that the launch of any particular layer two solution, or even like several of them together does also represent a viable catalyst?
00:41:16.306 - 00:41:18.920, Speaker B: In what sense a catalyst can you explain?
00:41:19.770 - 00:41:44.126, Speaker A: Do you think that it will just allow ethereum and DeFi to do stuff that are currently not possible? To me, it seems like many people are actually priced out of using ethereum right now. And that also is what explains sort of the rise of Solana, the rise of ESC. Do you think that sort of those people will, quote, unquote, come home?
00:41:44.308 - 00:42:38.830, Speaker B: I think actually there will be a lot of use cases that can come back to ethereum once there's layer two scaling. I think with ETH two, it's too far to say. It's too far in the future to say what the UI UX impacts will be because they can create new problems easily just as quickly as they solve old ones as we know about ethereum. But I do think that it doesn't even matter if people come back because I think what BSc showed. I had that tweet that's saying like, BSc is the most bullish catalyst for Ethereum I've ever seen, is that it showed that actually the Ethereum ecosystem, it got it all right. Ether scan is great, MetaMask is great, everything is great, EVM is great. Developers can use it, they can audit it, they can deploy safely, relatively safely.
00:42:38.830 - 00:43:20.460, Speaker B: It kind of solved all those questions and especially given that Binance had tried to do it with Tendermint before and it didn't go anywhere at all. It really showed the network effects of Ethereum in a huge way and it showed that with, let's say, a ten x increase in throughput, you can get 100 x increase in usage. And so it just makes it that much more likely that the smart contract vision for the world comes into existence, I think, because it's proving to the market that there is this demand to act on chain, even if it's less decentralized for now.
00:43:23.330 - 00:44:15.050, Speaker C: Yeah, I completely agree with that. If you think about it from a product point of view, right, you are seeing product market fit of EVM with users. So I totally agree. I see the rise of BNB and BSc as hugely bullish for Ethereum in the long, long, long run. Also very bearish for tron. What were they doing? It was all available for them. The flip side of it is, one thing I think BSc is incredibly good at is this sort of like binance are also incredibly good at marketing, right? They're good at marketing.
00:44:15.050 - 00:45:31.542, Speaker C: They're good at saying outright, welcome to the greatest casino of all time. The stuff that's popular on BSc now does not even have the pretense of being legitimate a lot of the time. Some of it is like is simply, we designed the tokenomics in a hope that this will go up so we can all get rich together in some ways, honestly, kind of, I find that a little bit more honest than a lot of the 2017 participants. But BSE are also incredibly good at marketing. They're incredibly good at saying, come here, these things are going to go up and you're going to make some money. And if Ethereum I genuinely believe that BSE could be entirely centralized, sent back and forwards on like a Google Doc or something, and a lot of the coins on there would have performed basically the same. So as new things are built, I think Binance can just integrate whatever it's centralized in it, so they can just go if Solana does well, let's slap some Solana in there, they can do whatever.
00:45:31.542 - 00:46:43.226, Speaker C: So I think their strength is access to new market participants via directly marketing to them. Because if people are interacting with BSc and BNB, they're using Binance, they are acquiring a user for a company which is then like that user has a lifetime value for them and stuff. I do think that's a bit different from Ethereum. And while I see it in the long, long, long run as super bullish for Ethereum because it's clear product market fit between EVM. I don't think you can say if Ethereum had the scaling today, all those users would have onboarded onto Ethereum instead because Binance is still going to be doing their marketing, they're still going to be pulling people over and Binance is still hugely incentivized to pull people onto a chain that uses BNB as collateral. So I think it's interesting. I think it's interesting how that part of the ecosystem, how that narrative will be written over the next few years because so many things on BSc are just going to zero.
00:46:43.226 - 00:47:45.550, Speaker C: Like so many things, just like a ponzi or it's a meme or it's going to zero and a ton of those users will get burned and then are they going to blame Binance for that or are they going to just going to exit crypto entirely? And then how are the regulators going to approach something like this? Tons of basically illegal securities being launched on a relatively centralized chain where has like, what, ten to 20 validators or something? It's not super censorship resistant. Should finance have a fiduciary responsibility to be interfering or whatever? I don't know how any of that's going to play out. It's going to be very interesting, honestly. A lot of this space s. You just kind of got to sit back and be like, I don't know what's going to happen. I'm just trying to watch it all so that when they make the movie in ten years, I can be a consultant and I get to meet the new Leonardo DiCaprio and go, don't go on the red carpet and go, look at me. That's my primary motive.
00:47:49.090 - 00:47:59.640, Speaker A: Is there anything in DFI that you guys are waiting for in terms of that really gets you excited that's about to launch or in the next three to six months.
00:48:01.530 - 00:48:15.180, Speaker C: Loans that are not like incredibly over collateralized, but I don't know anyone that's doing them. I don't know if it's about to launch, but I think that'll be interesting because everything's so over collateralized. I think that'll be interesting.
00:48:16.350 - 00:48:23.146, Speaker A: Do you use recursive borrowing on Compound Ave and so on? Maker?
00:48:23.338 - 00:48:25.066, Speaker C: No, I'm too simpleton.
00:48:25.178 - 00:48:34.610, Speaker A: Okay, but you can do like three to four X leverage, right? Like today if you want. You just have to leave it in the protocol.
00:48:36.550 - 00:49:46.306, Speaker C: Yeah, other than that I'm not super sure. I think like a bunch of the upgrades are going to be interesting. I think uni V three is going to be interesting to see how it plays out with Curve and with Sushi and stuff. It's not DFI, but I'm excited about arbitrary more optimism or whoever comes around and launches because I don't think people are properly quantifying the scaling benefits that roll ups will provide. So I think roll ups is like 100 X increase in throughput and E two and Shardings are only like a 50, 60, I can't remember the exact number. I think it's like 65 or something increase in throughput, but those two things stack multiplicatively. So roll ups on top of Sharding is like 6500 x increase in throughput and the east two roadmap is like move to proof of stake sharding of data but not of computation.
00:49:46.306 - 00:50:42.540, Speaker C: And then eventually full Sharded transaction processing, which is like, that's going to happen in 2030 or something. I have no confidence. Full Sharded transaction processing is I think it's years away. So full on chain scaling, like sharded applications on e two is still years away. However, the roll ups on top of Sharding of data I think is going to be pretty soon, like next year, early. I don't know what the prediction from you two is, but it means you get that 6500 x increase in throughput pretty soon, comparatively. So I'm pretty excited for Arbitrum or optimism or whichever ZK one actually ends up beating them to market because they've taken so long.
00:50:42.540 - 00:50:52.240, Speaker C: Those are things I'm most looking forward to. But yeah. Sue, what about you? What are you looking forward to? If any of them are still fundraising, can you slip me an intro?
00:50:52.610 - 00:51:32.874, Speaker B: Of course. On the DeFi side, I think just DeFi, perpetual swaps, DeFi leverage trading, dYdX, obviously, with layer two on Darkware, I think that's definitely one to look out for. I think there's also a number of other ones that are good that people should just try out. A lot of them are in liquidity mining phases right now, so you're going to get paid to use them. And I think in general, those have all worked out very well for early users. So it's something for people to look at. I think on the roll ups point, I 100% agree.
00:51:32.874 - 00:52:41.098, Speaker B: I think people really don't get how much scaling can come from roll ups. I think that even if they didn't do e two Sharding, there would potentially be ways that you could do kind of a network of roll ups and that would already be enough scaling for Ethereum. And I think the other big point to add too, is that in 2017 and 2018, there were already talks about layer two, right, with Raiden and with Plasma and these kind of concepts. And a lot of those teams and those team members later on joined for profit commercialized layer two companies and solutions. And I think what was missing then was that the application demand and the application quality wasn't there yet and the users weren't there yet, so people didn't know exactly what they're optimizing for. What were the pain points, what was going on. It was all research, it was all more theoretical, whereas now there's so many different implementations and there's so many teams competing to be the first market to win applications, to win mandates.
00:52:41.098 - 00:53:14.060, Speaker B: So now you're in the very free market phase, you're in the very competitive phase of Ethereum layer two and that's incredibly bullish. For actual deployment, there's not a chance that roll ups don't get deployed in a big way in the next year, right? That there's zero chance. Whereas in 2018, despite all the hype about Casper, FFG, Plasma, all this kind of stuff, it's just all an idea. It's an idea in someone's head. Applications have driven the infrastructure. Now.
00:53:15.790 - 00:54:25.060, Speaker A: I agree that's what was missing back then, that you had actual application demand, and now Ethereum is sort of breaking at the seams because there's way too much application demand for the little infrastructure that we have. And that just creates this huge incentive to improve the infrastructure and then deploy it in sort of a rapid manner. So I'm really looking forward to that. Personally, I'm a bit more hesitant to call any of this, like, really scaling because I'm still not 100% sure how Ethereum will actually look and feel when we've transitioned to this sort of asynchronous execution model, where all of a sudden, yeah, stuff that you do on one roll up that's sort of atomic like you're used to today. But once there's something that touches the base layer and the roll up, that's no longer atomic. Once there's stuff between two roll ups, it's no longer atomic. So how do you think about sort of the move to the asynchronous execution model?
00:54:27.990 - 00:55:47.370, Speaker C: I think the problem is that it is now inevitable. Because since roll ups only use the chain only for data and not for computation, and they'll be able to use the sharding of data pretty soon and you get that 6500 X throughput quite soon because of a combination of those two things. By the time base layer scaling happens on ethereum, no one's going to care because it's going to be two or three years away and it's going to be a performance decrease versus the two things like that stack that we'll have this year or next year. So I just think it becomes inevitable. And I've read that even ETH core now is saying, okay, what does Ethereum look like if you build like a roll up centric roadmap for how you build Ethereum? To me, it just seems like it's an inevitability now. But beyond that, I don't have any strong opinions.
00:55:48.190 - 00:56:06.450, Speaker B: I have a question for you, actually a bit off topic, but do you think that if Ethereum were to flip in bitcoin, that bitcoin USD would still be able to sustain levels and people would still buy bitcoin as a store of value, or do you think that that would be challenged substantially?
00:56:08.310 - 00:57:04.420, Speaker C: I think the flipping is now inevitable, but I think it'll be incredibly temporary. So I think you'll have a massive blow off top. I think the ETH blow off top will be like either slightly before or slightly after the bitcoin blow off top, and at the east blow off top, it'll temporarily flip in. I've never felt more confident in a trade in my life. Not financial advice to your listeners. The reason is that the total addressable market of things for Ethereum is just gigantic. So even if Bitcoin gets the store of value, its digital gold narrative gold, the market cap of gold, the total addressable market of gold is still lower than the total addressable market of everything, like of all money.
00:57:04.420 - 00:58:30.286, Speaker C: And when the internet launched and people got the internet wrong, thinking it's like an additional channel now you've got TV, radio and internet, rather than realizing, like, no, the Internet is just a new medium for all channels. You have TV on the internet, you have radio on the internet, it creates new mediums. The macro vision for Ethereum is that for all of money, whereas the macro vision for Bitcoin is like now digital gold, star of value. When you talk about crypto equities or stable coins or whatever, people never go, oh, is that on? Like, you automatically assume this thing's built on Ethereum. Like Great Britain's doing a stable coin trial and Path messaged me and was like, do you think this is going to be on Ethereum? That's your default, that's what you default assume it's not going to be on finance smart chain, is it? But that is your default assumption. It's like, well, this is probably going to build on Ethereum because right now 90 OD percent of things that have usage in the crypto ecosystem are built on Ethereum. Maybe it's less than 90 now because finance is super popular at the moment.
00:58:30.286 - 00:59:39.240, Speaker C: But even finance smart chain in a way is built on Ethereum because it's just the same source code. So I think the flippening is inevitable. I think in bull markets, Ethereum hugely overperforms, and in bear markets, Ethereum goes to zero, while Bitcoin does pretty well, performs better on the downside. So I do think we'll see a very temporary flipping. I think Bitcoin will be able to sustain USD values because I think the narratives for the two things are very different. I do think you'll see a bunch of institutional adoption of Ethereum soon. I read a report the other day by a guy called Alexander who runs a fund that works with helping institutions get access to crypto and it was just all about Ethereum saying it's like a first class peer of Bitcoin in their eyes now.
00:59:39.240 - 01:00:38.122, Speaker C: But, yeah, I do think there's going to be a bit of a move from I think it was you that says me going to start see some cold wallets moving and taking allocations to Ethereum. And there's a lot of people that are underexposed to Ethereum. But also I think a lot of the people that have bought Bitcoin have not bought it to sell the next one that comes along. They took ten years to buy Bitcoin. They're not going to go, oh, wait, we bought the wrong one, let's quickly buy this other one and dump all our Bitcoin. I think a lot of the people that are holding bitcoin now are in the like, we'll never sell, never sell camp, and worst case scenario, they'll go, we should also allocate to ethereum, dig another 1% out of their treasury or something. But that's on a really short time frame, so it's like a flipping happens.
01:00:38.122 - 01:02:45.874, Speaker C: Bitcoin doesn't go immediately to zero, it probably sustains well and it deflips and everyone goes, ha ha, that was bitcoin's back, or whatever. On a longer time frame, I do think the bear case for bitcoin is ethereum and I struggle to see without it performing similarly or without the bear market safety, what the narrative sustains us because I think the majority of crypto markets is like, no one trades on reality, everyone just trades on what everyone thinks reality is. The post truth era has gone too far in the crypto market. It's just like everyone just trades on narrative now has become super important. So I do think on, like, if you have a flippening that sustains or ethereum largely gains on bitcoin, I think that becomes troubling. Temporary flipping no problem for bitcoin USD, but the average price of ETH to bitcoin over the last sort of five years has been what? Like, it's about what it is now, right? Probably if you average the price out over if that changes significantly, and if it goes to zero one instead of zero four and sustains over a longer period of time, I think stuff like that starts to damage the narrative of bitcoin a lot more than a temporary flipping does. Because a lot of people, I think, have they got scared out of buying bitcoin, these institutions, family offices and stuff.
01:02:45.874 - 01:03:58.310, Speaker C: They got told not to allocate to bitcoin by JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, either because they were dishonest or naive. And now come 2020, 2021, they're considering taking positions because they're seeing Elon doing it, and now all of the people that told them not to do it are saying, oh, actually, yeah, we've taken position in that now. But they see the price of Bitcoin as far too high or their bull case scenarios for it go well, maybe I can get a triple out of this. And if I'm getting AIII can go participate in some risky stocks where I don't need to do a bunch of additional Reg compliant stuff for it to be possible for me to get exposure. If I'm going to do, like, the funny money, if I'm going to do the weird internet money, I need more than a three X. And then they start looking down coin market cap or coin gecko or whatever. So in some ways, I think it's kind of funny that they got Fudded out of the greatest boron of all time and now they're digging through CoinGecko to find a shit.
01:03:58.310 - 01:04:23.514, Speaker C: I've missed my gains. I need to pick up some I don't know what's this cardano thing, but in the other sense, it makes it bullish for stuff that still has a ton of market cap upside. Again, I think it's going to be interesting how it plays out, but I do think the flipping is inevitable. But I think it'll be very short lived.
01:04:23.562 - 01:04:37.190, Speaker B: And the reason you think it will be temporary or short lived in this I guess this time is just because you think either we'll not be able to sustain that momentum. There will be too much selling back to BTC. There will be too much selling to USD.
01:04:38.330 - 01:06:02.926, Speaker C: Yeah, I think for the flipping to happen in this cycle, unless this cycle is the soup cycle sponsored by Suzu, if it's not just up for the next three or four years, and it takes three or four years for east to flip, then I'm like, yeah, cool, maybe you'll have a sustained flipping then. But in that case, the writing is going to be on the wall for three or four years during this uptrend that signals market share evaporating and moving to ETH. If you have a 2017 style, we're currently at like zero five or something, and then three candles later, you're at 00:15. You're just going to have too much selling pressure. Too many people that are at a decent profit, too many people saying it's not different this time, I'm taking profits here and then that selling pressure just turns into three candles back in the other direction. But in crypto, and maybe in all things, I don't know enough about other markets, to be honest, but in crypto, things grow in bubbles. So you have these huge parabolic bubble like run ups.
01:06:02.926 - 01:07:17.160, Speaker C: And what's important is where the price settles after that parabolic rise. Like if you have a parabolic rise and then you have the new floor settling like 100% 50% above the previous floor, I think that is way more important than did the peak flipping the market cap for seven minutes or did it like it was actually for two days or whatever. I just think that stuff's like vanity and it's stuff for people to argue about on Twitter, it makes a good talking point, but it's not that interesting because it's like data points that existed for a matter of hours. If the floor establishes significantly higher, that gets super interesting. It means like the demand for ETH versus bitcoin now versus several years ago has substantially changed. And if it can sustain that for a year or multiple years, I think that's way more interesting personally, because Dogecoin Dark Verge Coin or whatever, that went to like infinity, didn't it? Don't matter that it went to infinity once.
01:07:18.490 - 01:07:19.240, Speaker B: True.
01:07:21.770 - 01:07:28.726, Speaker A: I assume you're a bit more bearish on bitcoin after a potential flipping.
01:07:28.918 - 01:08:01.720, Speaker B: I'm undecided, actually. I think that there's kind of two ways to look at it from my point of view. I think one is that even if it Flippins, that bitcoin has its unique value proposition and it has a different set of potentially a different set of buyers who kind of more objectivist in nature. So they just view it as, okay, this is the Canon. This is the first chain, so I just collect it, and I don't think too hard about it. Orange coin, good kind of mentality. And I do think there are a lot of those people.
01:08:01.720 - 01:08:43.250, Speaker B: I mean, you saw how little of supply moved as we went from twenty k to three and a half and then back up to 60K. Like a shit ton of supply is not moving. These guys are just not like there literally exists no information. They're anti Bayesians, right? There's no new information that would make them sell it. And that is actually very powerful. And bitcoin kind of has that, that's I think the bullcase. And also I think then being the biggest proof of work chain, there will be proof of work advocates who countries with cheap energy costs.
01:08:43.250 - 01:11:01.230, Speaker B: That kind of game theory will be interesting. If bitcoin were to dip because of these people selling because ether flipping it, who's to say that some of these governments won't bid it up and then be like, okay, now we all love bitcoin, right? So that is kind of the big bullcase for it not to go down. I think on the other side of it is that the biggest advantages that bitcoin has right now are one, it's the most liquid way to trade crypto, and two is that it's dominance as a pricing pair, its dominance as something that as a treasury asset of crypto, right? So that does get seriously challenged if it's no longer the most liquid and the largest. Because then people will say, well, why don't I denominate an ether instead? Why don't I trade ether pairs as people do in uniswap? Or why don't people trade back to ether and hold ether as a store of value if it's more liquid anyways? Losing that liquidity advantage is very dangerous for Bitcoin in that sense, because I started to play with this kind of idea that ether is almost more antifragile than Bitcoin, because ether can exist and kind of hum along happily for years at 10% to 30% market cap of Bitcoin it doesn't matter, right? As long as it serves some purpose for itself and for its people. Whereas the question is, can bitcoin hum along at x percent of ether, like 50% of ether, 20% of ether? That gets harder because its value proposition, one of its biggest, is to be the biggest coin. Once it is not the biggest coin, you really do need that kind of very strong holders to say, and that may or may not happen at the prices that people think. So I'm of the view that if flip printing were to happen, it would actually, I think the last one was a very temporary one in the backdrop of big scaling debate, bitcoin cash going to 0.4.5
01:11:01.230 - 01:11:58.674, Speaker B: XRP BTC going to absurd levels. And I think that kind. Of in like the history doesn't repeat but it rhymes way. I almost feel like if it were to happen this cycle, obviously there's no cycle because it's super cycle, but just speaking in those terms, if it were to flip in then it will kind of be much stronger this time than last time just because of the way the history is. Just my intuition about history kind of makes me think that and because sort of the hype will have been validated in a way like the product and the narrative would have caught up with the hype. So I think that reflexivity is harder to break on that upside than last time where it's much more chaotic, I think.
01:11:58.872 - 01:12:52.850, Speaker A: Yeah, I'd say those are great points. I strongly agree. I would add on top of being just the biggest coin, like that being one of the reasons why people hold it, I would say a lot of people also hold it because they think it's like the lowest inflation asset that you can have. Right. It has zero inflation after all. But I feel like it's almost like a new paradigm where people didn't consider before that if a coin that the race to the bottom doesn't stop at zero, actually like you can go below 0% inflation. And why should a coin that has like 1% deflation not be preferred by the entire market over a coin that has 0% deflation, 0% inflation? And I personally think that a lot of people in Bitcoin are genuinely scared about this proposition.
01:12:53.510 - 01:14:18.494, Speaker C: Yeah, it's interesting. I often think with a lot of the people in Bitcoin, I think they organize into a bunch of different categories and some are just philosophically believe that you cannot have the active centralized planners that Ethereum has. Of the few teams that closely collaborate together into a monetary system that's going to provide the world that they want to live in. I think then you have a bunch of people that got like in that 2017 time, got completely wrecked by buying rubbish and now they only really follow Bitcoin. They think everything else is a scam and they don't really keep up with the information enough to know what's changing. Because people talk about the flipping as market cap, right? Is Ethereum going to be bigger than Bitcoin on market cap? But there's a bunch of other interesting metrics as well that probably don't have high correlation with price now but show adoption in other ways. And the two where Ethereum performs the worst is Google search interest which is like 15% of bitcoin and market cap which is about 30% of Bitcoin today.
01:14:18.494 - 01:14:56.266, Speaker C: And on everything else Ethereum does really well. And the most interesting one is if you think about the amount of USD settled every day on the ETH chain, it is like multiples, multiples larger than on Bitcoin partially because you have so much stuff built on top of ETH. So you have all the stable coins built on top of ETH. The majority of stablecoin activity happens on ETH. I know there is some on Bitcoin, but the majority of it happens on ETH. You have all the tokens and all the tokens have gigantic market caps and everyone's sending them around and stuff and.
01:14:56.288 - 01:15:00.380, Speaker A: The arbitrage between them, that's probably about like 30, 40%.
01:15:00.850 - 01:15:45.420, Speaker C: Yeah, just gigantic. And if you look at there's a site that has like a flippining metrics flipping index that maps all of these together and how they trend together. That has been steadily moving up for a long time, like a couple of years. And at some point it seems to me that market cap has to follow these user adoption metrics if they keep trending in that way. And it's probably not highly correlated, so it's probably not fast, but it would make sense to me. I hadn't really thought about what sue said, like the narrative for bitcoin as being the big store of value. It doesn't do much else.
01:15:45.420 - 01:16:12.130, Speaker C: If that's taken away by ETH, that is quite bad for bitcoin. I hadn't really thought about that too much. Like, if you go to Coin Gecko and bitcoin's number two, it feels like super, super bearish for bitcoin. So I hadn't thought about that too much. I also agree with sue that 2017 is regarded as like, yeah, we don't talk about that. That was just crazy chaos. That didn't really happen.
01:16:12.130 - 01:16:40.220, Speaker C: Everything was irrational then, whereas now it seems a lot more like it's frothy again now. But it's been less frothy as we've risen up and institutions are allocating and the trading volume isn't entirely like 95% retail like it was back then. I also believe that if the BNB frenzy was happening on ETH now, the flipping would have already happened.
01:16:41.170 - 01:17:18.838, Speaker A: There wasn't always like a link between stuff like trading volume and the settlement sort of that happens on ETH. All the arbitrage until basically ERP, 1559 and the merge which then internalizes all that revenue that is generated as a result, puts it into the ETH token. And I think that is, in my view, that is basically the catalyst that is needed to finally translate all the numbers where Ethereum is already performing better than bitcoin into actual price appreciation. That's my guess.
01:17:19.004 - 01:17:21.340, Speaker C: Yeah, that makes sense to me. That makes sense.
01:17:22.190 - 01:17:47.058, Speaker A: I have one last block of questions because I feel like we should more leverage the fact that you're such a large trader and you have survived through so many market cycles and lean a bit on your experience. So how would you describe what's your approach to trading? How do you survive for so long?
01:17:47.224 - 01:19:08.134, Speaker C: Yeah, so like, financially survived, but man, my health, my self respect, my friendships for me, I think it's a few things. Like my whole approach has been to survive. My thesis was always, if this thing is really going to be a big deal, if the last eight years is going to happen the way it happened. Sorry, one SEC. Then the best thing to do is to take it slow because the implied price to the future implied price is so gigantic. It's like the chasm of difference that just being exposed to this market will be enough, and outperforming the market by two X or three X will be a phenomenal increase in net worth. I didn't realize it would go like it did with such massive boom and bust cycles.
01:19:08.134 - 01:20:09.982, Speaker C: I was really shocked that the 2017 cycle went so high and then went so low again afterwards. I thought as the market cap got bigger, things would mature and it would become less volatile, and I still believe that. However, Sue's now telling me we're going to have a super cycle where it's going to go to a billion in a single daily candle. So maybe I'm naive still, but rather than taking a go from net worth of 100 quid, $100 for any Americans listening to $10 million in a year, it was always instead try and play it safe, accumulate as much bitcoin as possible and play the long game. And positioning that way, I think, was really helpful. I'm naturally quite bearish. So I struggle to believe in anything.
01:20:09.982 - 01:21:10.114, Speaker C: I can always find the flaws and why things won't work. That's naturally how my mind works. This sounds dumb, this sounds stupid, this is never going to work for these reasons. That's my natural disposition, which I think is quite helpful in crypto markets in some ways, as long as you're able to confront that and Outrade yourself and recognize that's your natural disposition and say, how do I modify this instinct within me in order to be profitable? A way better natural intuition in crypto is to be like, this is going to infinity. I'm going all in because the people who've done that over the years have done very well, but because I felt I'm naturally bearish, I'm naturally skeptical. It means I've tret altcoins a lot like musical chairs. Like, I know intellectually that they're going to go up because of market participants believing these things about them and the frost and people wanting exposure and everyone's kind of playing chicken with their money.
01:21:10.114 - 01:22:04.674, Speaker C: So I understand that, but I also inherently believe that it has no value and therefore I need to ride this and exit safely. And a lot of the time I'm Newton on that meme, where it says, like, Newton exits happy. Often that's me. But I just don't reenter because I'm like, you know what, if I get a three X or a four X or a five X and it goes like 100 X, I'm happy with my five X because I'm playing like a ten to 20 year, 20 year game. Like, you have some money, you still keep investing, you still keep doing stuff, and that's the game I'm playing. I'm not trying to participate in the casino of putting it all on a single horse and yeah, maybe making 100 million in a single trade and then exiting. While I'm sure that feels great, I don't think the people that do that even then walk away.
01:22:04.674 - 01:22:54.306, Speaker C: They just keep gambling. And my approach has always been take it steady, try and outperform the market, respectably a little bit, but don't try and 1020 X outperform the market every single year. A lot of the time it's not possible and you'll just like chop yourself up. In the bull run years, it's incredibly easy to outperform bitcoin by a factor of ten. Even just holding some of the altcoins alone, you would have been able to do that. But in the bear market, you just have to accept the reality of the world that right now it's much harder to make money. You're not going to get the revenue that you earned in the bull market the year after the bull market or the one after that.
01:22:54.306 - 01:24:01.820, Speaker C: And the mission is to survive through this whole thing. And I think the people that have done that have done really well. And I think it's also why you see so many of the biggest, most influential funds or investors in crypto got started in 20 18, 20, 17, 20 18, because surviving those, the down periods, they were pretty brutal. In 2019, I just said, you know what, I'm not going to do anything, I'm not going to trade at all. I'll keep watching the market, I'm going to go do some traveling and have a rest because when things like in 2017 I had very little sleep and when things go like that again, I want to not be burnt out. I don't want to have wasted a year margin trading myself to death to outperform by like 30% in a bear market. It's really not worth it.
01:24:01.820 - 01:25:08.106, Speaker C: So I always optimized for keeping myself occupied and having other things to do. After the 2017 run, I built a startup and built something that adds value to the world and tried to keep myself really busy and then the ball run comes around and I quit and focus on the ball run and try and outperform by a decent chunk. But I genuinely believe it's all about playing it safe, like keeping your leverage down, keeping keep your exits safe and sustainable and just play it safe. Like everything goes up a million percent. Like if you like you just, all you need is exposure to the market. That's that's literally all you need and you'll do fine. The people that don't make it are the people that try and outpace and they have like a sense of greed around it and they go, shit, I wasn't positioned properly for this bull run and if I had positioned properly, I'd have this amount of bitcoin or this amount of ethereum.
01:25:08.106 - 01:25:42.540, Speaker C: So to get back to that amount of bitcoin or ethereum, I'm going to have to up my leverage to five X and trade perfectly for the next four months, and they put a bunch of pressure on themselves, which makes it impossible for them to trade anyway. All those people get ruined. I haven't seen a single person make it in a scenario like that. Every single person I've seen make it has been, I'm doing all right, I'll keep doing all right. I'm going to keep it chill. And they've just done that over the course of like eight years or three years or five years or however long they've been in the game.
01:25:43.310 - 01:25:51.420, Speaker A: What do you say to people who only joined like half a year ago or something and now feel like they've missed the train?
01:25:51.950 - 01:26:53.138, Speaker C: Yeah, so, like, every single bubble, I always thought that might be the last one, that might be the last time we get to do this. Like in 2013, it went up so fast. I got into crypto in 2012, early 2013, so it went up so fast that I felt, oh wow, maybe I've missed out. And then bear market zoom out, think about long term thesis and stuff. So I think everyone always feels like they've missed out. But the level of crypto adoption now versus the level of crypto adoption, if this becomes a global consensus currency or a base money in the world, it's dramatically different. Right? Like at the moment you've got Ellen going on the Ellen show to make fun of NFTs and Saturday night live making fun of ethereum and stuff in little skits because it's new and it's weird and they don't really get it.
01:26:53.138 - 01:27:41.578, Speaker C: And you have relatively little adoption. Like, institutions are buying crypto for the first time over the last couple of years. It's only just really on their radar, and the big banks are only just going, yeah, maybe this thing is legitimate. By the way, sorry that we Fudded you out of it, for you could have been very rich if you'd ignored us. All that stuff is just starting to happen. And the realization of the most bullish cases for crypto, the upside is still really far away. Bitcoin wouldn't just be flipping gold, wouldn't just be taking the market cap away from gold.
01:27:41.578 - 01:29:10.734, Speaker C: It would be realizing what gold would have been had bitcoin never existed, which is multiples larger than gold is ethereum's. Most bullish possible case is like, ethereum is no longer speculative. It's just the utensil or utility that you need to interact on this consensus computer that everyone in the world uses in order to not trust each other, which is maybe a little bit dark, but whatever the upside for even the majors is still super high on a medium to long term timeline. In addition, I like to continually think that things can get better, and what we have today is not the best thing that we can ever have, and therefore I believe that new things will be built. If you were in crypto in 2012 or 2013, it is still possible that. You missed out on aave, you missed out on synthetics, you missed out on uniswap, you missed out on curve, you missed out on everything that were like chainlink, everything that was built over the last few years because you were early to crypto. But you need to continually pay attention to innovation and the way the space is moving in order to take advantage of those things.
01:29:10.734 - 01:30:09.950, Speaker C: And the amount of information asymmetry and the amount of new information daily that's generated by an open source community that has direct financial incentives is gigantic. And that gigantic amount of information makes a bunch of opportunity for people who are willing to dig in and are willing to become independent thinkers about what is going to be important over the next sort of five years or so. So if you're joining today, I have two main messages, I think. One is you're not going to go from one thousand dollars to five million dollars in this cycle. Some people might, some people will. There'll be a couple of people that do. We just saw someone on Safe Moon do like $200 into 42 million.
01:30:09.950 - 01:31:16.020, Speaker C: I don't think he sold, but some people will do that, but it won't be the average. Now, if you're willing to stay engaged over the next sort of five years or so, those sort of returns I think become a lot more reasonable if you play your cards right. So you're not going to become an instant overnight millionaire in this cycle. Please stop trying reduce your leverage. Genuinely don't margin trade at all if you just join crypto. The second message is I think it's going to be slightly harder than it was back then in some ways, because back then there wasn't an overload of information, there was like bitcoin and then there was a bunch of stuff that was crap that pretended to be good. And then 2017 came around, things got a bit more confusing, ethereum came around and things started to get like alternative projects started to get a bit more credible, whereas now there is so much stuff happening and the complexity of the products has increased a lot.
01:31:16.020 - 01:31:51.886, Speaker C: So I think it's harder to have exposure to the good stuff early because you need to do a lot of work to figure out what the good stuff is. But because that work is needed, there's a bunch of opportunity as well. So you're not going to become overnight rich, you need to stick in a space for a bit longer, try not to lose interest. And yeah, it won't be as easy as just riding like bitcoin upwards, but there will be things that are repriced much, much quicker than bitcoin repriced that if you're willing to do the work, you can get exposure to. Sorry, I said the same answer like four times now, I think.
01:31:51.908 - 01:32:15.862, Speaker A: No, that was very valuable advice. So before we wrap things up, I'd be curious. So based on the beliefs that we discussed today and sort of the strategies. How are you both positioned for the next three to six months? Our audience always loves it when I ask this question. So starting with, I mean, I think.
01:32:15.996 - 01:32:44.026, Speaker B: Kyle won on a recent podcast recently as well and just mentioned that we're quite overweight Ether. I mean, we are definitely very overweight Ether. I think we should be one of the largest holders in the world of ETH right now. The main debate that we have is just do we want to sell at 0.1, do we want to sell at zero point 15.2? Never sell. And obviously when I say never sell, I mean it as a trader.
01:32:44.026 - 01:33:31.120, Speaker B: So that doesn't actually mean we can be doing a podcast in two years and we'll be talking about why Ether is a scam. But no, we're very overweight ETH. I think application layer, we've done some investments into some salana based ones. Also BSc applications continue to be very bullish on. I think it's been a bear market a bit almost like in between all the froth, it's kind of been a bear market in ETH. DFI stuff like Ave is still 30% off the highs, stuff like Sushi is 50% off the highs. So I do think that with layer two, with resurgence of ETH, these projects will get the attention again.
01:33:31.120 - 01:34:31.374, Speaker B: I think on the Alt layer one side, I do think that there's quite interesting stuff happening there as well. Yeah, I generally see the next few months being a little bit bearish bitcoin dominance. I just see it as something where you've had the sailor narrative a few times and you've had the digital go narrative a few times and there's big sellers at three x all time high. So from all those things happening, the OGS have gotten comfortable and deployed out to Alts. The newcomers are coming in and they have not a bone of maximalism in their body, right? They come in and they just straight skip the first five coins and just go from there. So that's definitely the flow that is coming. I mean, some of the retail fiat on ramps that I speak with here, the flow is 75% ETH versus 25% bitcoin.
01:34:31.374 - 01:34:56.970, Speaker B: So the retail flow is strongly pro non BTC. I think institutions seeing this price action, they also want to participate in it and that kind of will just add fuel to the fire. So I think I see FBDC 0.5 as a key psychological level. I think when you break it, people are going to be like, okay, that kind of really gets people's attention. So that's generally my view and my positioning.
01:34:59.710 - 01:36:17.762, Speaker C: Yeah, very similar. Sue and I spoke about this on Twitter DM not long ago, maybe a couple of weeks ago. I don't even own any bitcoin anymore. Like, first time in my life since 2013 where I don't own any and I rebalance a lot, but I've never entirely rebalanced out and in around December of last year, I started entirely rebalancing out of bitcoin into ETH just for the merge and EIP 1559 stuff. I'm hugely overweight ETH as well, and exposure to the DFI stuff that I just think is sort of like a staple has underperformed a little bit recently. But I just feel comfortable sort of bag holding that kind of stuff. I try and position my portfolio in a way where it's not mentally taxing for me, where I can just kind of back hold it, and I can go get drunk, or I can go, like, if I'm away from the internet for a week.
01:36:17.762 - 01:36:55.646, Speaker C: Accidentally. All of a sudden, I know that I am not going to come back and be like, wait, I'm poor. Now what? It's just like, whatever, I can just hold it and I can feel fine about it. The only other thing that I've been doing a lot of is I'm taking a lot of exposure to seed rounds of things either where the vesting is relatively short and I'm like, it's a bull market, things are getting frothy. Short vesting, I will take that. I'll do the Alameda, accept your thing and sell it fine. So I've been taking that.
01:36:55.646 - 01:38:09.030, Speaker C: And also anything where I'm like, this is genuinely a good project, where it might have a four year vesting, but in four years I can still see this existing as a thing. So I've been doing a lot of that just because I'm a bit scared of heights on a bunch of things at the moment. So I've reduced allocation to stuff where I just can't tell myself I believe it, I believe this is a valuable thing or I can't get a thesis behind it working. I'm more than happy to miss out on profits, and I'm sure that I will, because I think the market is relatively detached from reality at the moment. There's been a disappearance of shared objective standards for truth, and instead the fact that Maps Me can be in a ball market when it literally doesn't even make sense, like it's an offline maps app with a DeFi wallet in like the majority of the users of Maps me use it because you can't use maps like that's. The primary use case is like, this is better than Google Maps for when you're offline. So they've added a DeFi wallet when you're offline in the middle of the forest and you need to quickly access your vault.
01:38:09.030 - 01:39:14.240, Speaker C: This doesn't make any sense to me and that's in a bull market. So I'm sure I'll miss out on profits when I can't figure out a thesis that makes sense. But at this stage, when everything's up 20 x, 30 x or whatever, I tend to transition. That the instinctive bear in me, tends to transition to a protect sort of scenario where I only hold stuff that I can in like a year or two. If I lose all my money, I can at least explain to you how I lost it? And I say, yeah, well, I held these things, I believe they were good for these reasons and that's how my investment didn't work out. Whereas if I'm holding maps me and I have to explain to someone how I lost all my money and I'm like, well this offline maps app didn't do very well in the DeFi market and it's like everyone's going to laugh at me. So I've moved a little bit into that sort of protect pattern now, except with seed rounds where no one else got in at a cheaper price and it seems like a fair bet in this sort of market.
01:39:15.090 - 01:39:17.450, Speaker A: Basically. Shame minimization strategy.
01:39:17.530 - 01:40:43.386, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. If you're married and you lost all your money, what would you tell your partner? And you don't want to say I lost it all because I believed that they were going to put this token that got made by anonymous developer on the Binance Smart chain, was going to get integrated and it was going to be the primary where you buy electricity in a Tesla. I don't want to say that because I don't believe that's true and my partner's then going to leave me, but if I say I thought the fees that were earned by this protocol were outsized versus the fees earned by this other protocol and the market caps meant that this one was a better bet. Plus I thought that the liquidity locks in this protocol would be more sticky through the market. I expect over the next twelve months at least I can take away something away from that and learn something from it and do something better next time. I think it's really important in a market full of irrationality and froth to remain an independent thinker and remain least true to your thesis and make moves that you can at least back and believe in and learn from if they go wrong. And sometimes you can't learn anything right.
01:40:43.386 - 01:41:33.402, Speaker C: It's like sometimes the learning is okay. So Hasu just messaged me to say he lost a little bit of the ending recording and none of us can really remember what the lesson I said was going to be. So I'm here recording a post podcast to announce that you kind of got rugged. You kind of got rugged. We didn't talk for too much longer anyway. And I mostly rambled about the simulation heuristic and its application to crypto markets, and how often the outcome we expect is the one we can most easily imagine. And that tricks us into not betting enough, or not betting all, or tricks the unit biased kids into thinking they'll be billionaires, or tricks people into selling early.
01:41:33.402 - 01:42:45.922, Speaker C: Whatever your natural sort of tendency and disposition or expectation imagination is, honestly I don't think it was very high quality rambling as you've just witnessed in this follow up ramble. If I'm going to make some closing remarks since I've got the opportunity to record my own closing of the podcast. I'd say that everyone I've seen do extremely well both in this space and in the non crypto world, too, have two sort of common traits they're exceptionally curious and they have high conviction in their own analysis or their own talent, or their own view of the reality of the world. These people are often resistant to being told how to think about the world or how to think about certain ideas. And they're meticulous about what's true and what's not true and what's real and what isn't. And that combination of endless curiosity and high conviction in your own sort of beliefs or analysis allows people to make bets, dig in, to follow through with their bet, recognize when they're right or wrong, and learn from why. It's much harder to learn from something if you don't really understand why you made the bet in the first place.
01:42:45.922 - 01:43:38.414, Speaker C: And it's impossible to hold high conviction in a bet when the analysis is somebody else's work and you're underwater and you're feeling stressed. So I think conviction and curiosity are both muscles that you can train over time by changing your circumstance and approach to problem solving on new information. Like if you're doing stuff with your time now that does not cultivate your curiosity, you should change that and figure out ways that you can force your curiosity to be more present in your day to day life. Some old trader or gambler or whatever said something like, you can't win if you don't bet, and you can't bet if you wipe out. So before I say goodbye, I'll remind you to reduce your leverage, play the long game, remain curious, keep learning, make small bets, learn from them, repeat, etc. Thanks to sue and Hasu for having me on. I'll be off.
01:43:38.414 - 01:43:48.580, Speaker C: I'm going to go back to Twitter to write some shit jokes up only. See you later, Our.
