00:00:00.650 - 00:00:37.854, Speaker A: Welcome to Uncommon Core, where we explore the big ideas in crypto from first principles. Today I'm sitting down with Su Zu, my friend and co host to talk about the state of the crypto market and what he's seeing on the horizon. Sue is the CEO as well as Chief Investment Officer at Three Arrows Capital, one of the largest trading firms in crypto. Just one thing before we dive in. We make no money from this podcast, but we do want to grow our audience. So please take the time to leave us a rating and review on Apple podcasts. It really helps a lot with discovery.
00:00:37.854 - 00:00:51.260, Speaker A: Thank you, and please enjoy the episode. Sue, welcome. I'm really excited to talk to you today.
00:00:51.710 - 00:00:53.360, Speaker B: Yeah, it should be a fun one.
00:00:54.290 - 00:01:19.986, Speaker A: I want to talk to you about the market. So much is going on right now. I have questions about things that have happened or that are currently playing out, but I also want to use these as a segue to dive deeper into the fundamentals and the theory behind some of these things. So I hope we can tie them together in a way that's both interesting and informative for our listeners.
00:01:20.098 - 00:01:20.566, Speaker C: Sure.
00:01:20.668 - 00:01:45.502, Speaker A: To start out, the big story right now is probably the decline of DFI. Across the board, many coins are down over 50%, some of them even down 70%, such as wifey, year and finance. Why do you think DFI crashed and did you see it coming?
00:01:45.636 - 00:02:11.910, Speaker B: I think the crash of DFI is in any kind of big explosion of interest and community, you'll have quite steep pullbacks. So I think that this is no different in that sense. You can't really have prices go up 1020 X without having 50% and 70% pullbacks. So I think part of that is just the internal logic of markets.
00:02:15.050 - 00:02:16.582, Speaker C: Cannot be fought against.
00:02:16.716 - 00:02:26.554, Speaker B: I think that for us, for me personally, I think there were some warning signs a few weeks ago where you.
00:02:26.592 - 00:02:30.662, Speaker C: Had a lot of sort of copycat.
00:02:30.726 - 00:02:59.282, Speaker B: Stuff popping up, a lot of forks thought they could just copy and then get rich from that. There was a lot of me too kind of behavior. So I think that that's usually symptomatic of blow off tops, and there's a few reasons for that. I think one is that the local tops are always defined by a misallocation of resources, whether that's in crypto or otherwise.
00:02:59.426 - 00:03:00.120, Speaker C: So.
00:03:02.170 - 00:03:27.360, Speaker B: During the boom, during the absolute tops, there were a lot of normal companies that were adding.com to their name and trying to refashion themselves as tech companies. And similarly, during the top of DFI here, you had random projects starting to say that they're DFI, that they can add an AMM or add swaps. I had at least three or four.
00:03:28.130 - 00:03:31.006, Speaker C: Discussions with top 200 coins where they.
00:03:31.028 - 00:03:50.230, Speaker B: Wanted to figure out how to get into DFI. So I think things like this are always good signs because they signal that the market is trying to the market is creating much more novelty than it is innovation.
00:03:50.970 - 00:04:02.662, Speaker C: And so we definitely had a big sort of correction now where people are realizing, wait, the yields are not forever.
00:04:02.726 - 00:04:13.166, Speaker B: Someone has to buy governance tokens for me to get that yield. Who's going to buy the governance token if there's no reason to own the governance token? Or because the fully diluted market cap.
00:04:13.348 - 00:04:16.890, Speaker C: Is extremely high even at these levels.
00:04:16.970 - 00:04:37.054, Speaker B: So I think that overall, people are just starting to ask the hard questions now, and nothing has really changed even that strongly, fundamentally. But I do think that for people who are overexposed to thinking that it's just the new paradigm, that it never goes down, I think they're kind of also having their own first taste of what markets are like.
00:04:37.112 - 00:04:37.718, Speaker C: Right.
00:04:37.884 - 00:04:40.120, Speaker B: So I think it's a mix of all those things.
00:04:41.530 - 00:04:41.894, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:04:41.932 - 00:04:54.374, Speaker A: And we touched on this in our episode on Yam, but you tweeted a few days before that picture of the Euthanasia roller coaster. Does this sum up what you just described?
00:04:54.422 - 00:05:14.450, Speaker B: Pretty much, absolutely. The euthanasia, I think. Euthanasia. I first came across this motif in 2018 when I'm speaking with another prominent trader in the markets, light Crypto, on Twitter, and he was discussing with me the idea of accumulation distribution.
00:05:14.790 - 00:05:17.522, Speaker C: And what he means by that is.
00:05:17.576 - 00:05:20.066, Speaker B: That when you have created a high.
00:05:20.248 - 00:05:24.162, Speaker C: In alt BTC pairs, once that high.
00:05:24.296 - 00:05:26.170, Speaker B: Has been created and then it nukes.
00:05:26.350 - 00:05:32.230, Speaker C: The next bounce up is always a percentage away from that top.
00:05:32.300 - 00:05:42.950, Speaker B: Because people have seen that top. And there will be x percent of people trying to sell to lock in some profits. And they know they have to sell at a lower price than the high that was printed.
00:05:43.110 - 00:05:43.770, Speaker C: Right?
00:05:43.920 - 00:05:47.418, Speaker B: And the incremental buyer is suddenly gone.
00:05:47.504 - 00:05:51.658, Speaker C: Because there's not, or the incremental buyer.
00:05:51.674 - 00:06:02.110, Speaker B: Is still there, possibly on the first bounce, but the overwhelming size of the sellers is too big for the buyers to absorb.
00:06:03.170 - 00:06:04.546, Speaker C: And as soon as you make a.
00:06:04.568 - 00:06:21.842, Speaker B: Second lower high in something like this, then you will have this thing go again and again toward this kind of a vortex, as we're seeing now in some of these markets. And I think that structure is very common in Alt BTC.
00:06:21.906 - 00:06:24.438, Speaker C: It's very common in a lot of.
00:06:24.444 - 00:06:41.994, Speaker B: These hype cycles, because fundamentally, it's a money game in a lot of these coins, right. You're betting that more money will go in than will flow out. But if we're making lower highs, then that's strong evidence to the contrary. So those who have unrealized profits, they thought they were up ten x, five.
00:06:42.032 - 00:06:44.986, Speaker C: X, eight x, whatever it is, they're.
00:06:45.018 - 00:06:47.886, Speaker B: Now suddenly saying, okay, I want to make sure to book some profits so.
00:06:47.908 - 00:06:50.654, Speaker C: That I'm not one of the losers of this game. Right.
00:06:50.692 - 00:07:06.918, Speaker B: Because suddenly it becomes very apparent that you need new money to come in and you cashing out, strictly takes away some of that liquidity. So I think that motif is a.
00:07:06.924 - 00:07:10.146, Speaker C: Very good way to understand crypto markets.
00:07:10.178 - 00:07:25.222, Speaker B: I think it's helped me a lot and I strongly recommend at least when you see signs of things happening that are very euphoric, you ask yourself, would it make sense for this to be the top of a euthanasia?
00:07:25.366 - 00:07:29.466, Speaker C: And that's in general a good way.
00:07:29.488 - 00:07:43.506, Speaker B: To think about it. And it'll also help you not buy shallow dips, right? It's very dangerous to buy a shallow dip at the beginning of the break because fundamentally for the value buyers, they may still not be biding even if it goes down 50%.
00:07:43.608 - 00:07:43.922, Speaker C: Right?
00:07:43.976 - 00:08:02.274, Speaker B: So if you bid on a shallow dip, let's say 10%, you're betting that it's not a euthanasia, that it's just another dip to be bought. So you just have to be aware that if you're wrong, you can be very wrong in that kind of a scenario.
00:08:02.402 - 00:09:23.680, Speaker A: That's a great point. We talk so much about scarcity in the context of cryptocurrency and each of these tokens is seen basically on their own, is scarce, has a limited supply of tokens. And we saw that with Wifey, right, it had this kind of scarcity premium in the beginning. But then what happens is that we see a massive supply side expansion for these kind of projects because of all the different copycats. So first there was just Wifey, right, just urine, and now you have at least 20 different yield farming projects and many of them, like some of the bigger ones, like Harvest Finance or Pickle Finance, attract over $200 million of AOM, right? So would you say this contributes to basically the coaster? So at first you have some projects that are generally innovative and that kind of lead on the way up, but then with some delay, you have all these different copycats coming online and basically leading to such a large supply side increase that there can't be enough buyers to keep it going for much longer.
00:09:24.130 - 00:09:39.958, Speaker B: Sure, I think that's definitely true. And what I would say is that it also depends on what part of the cycle we're in. In the beginning of the cycle, I think the forks or the copycats, the first copycats, they actually help a lot, like Yam you could say was kind.
00:09:39.964 - 00:09:43.366, Speaker C: Of a copycat, the ultimate copycat, right.
00:09:43.388 - 00:09:55.146, Speaker B: Because they copied Wi Fi elements, ample fourth elements, compound elements, and that was hugely popular at that time, even with its issues. And I think it led to the DeFi coins that you could stake for.
00:09:55.168 - 00:09:57.786, Speaker C: It going up like shit tons for.
00:09:57.808 - 00:10:02.050, Speaker B: A couple of days, for a few days. So I think copycats in the beginning.
00:10:02.070 - 00:10:05.246, Speaker C: Of the cycle are very good for.
00:10:05.268 - 00:10:19.940, Speaker B: The markets price wise. But I think that, like you said, as you get later in the cycle when people start asking questions about moats and what are the actual cash flows that are going to be achieved, what's going to actually happen?
00:10:20.550 - 00:10:22.766, Speaker C: I do think that at that stage.
00:10:22.878 - 00:10:42.102, Speaker B: You tend to have people saying, okay, if there's now harvest that's valued at this price, this market cap and you have WiFi valued at this other price, what's going to long term be the reason why people buy WiFi and not this? Or how are they going to capture those cash flows?
00:10:42.166 - 00:10:50.186, Speaker C: Right? And I think that forks are actually really good at pointing out these kind of things.
00:10:50.368 - 00:11:09.410, Speaker B: Same with Sushi and Uni, right? Like people might want to say uni is worth all this because it has the brand behind it and it has everything behind it, but at the end of the day, it's open source code. And Sushi really does the same thing. They arguably have a better coin distribution in some sense because they don't have a pre mine.
00:11:10.630 - 00:11:15.286, Speaker C: So there's no, like, I think in.
00:11:15.308 - 00:11:18.006, Speaker B: DeFi, the existence of those kinds of.
00:11:18.028 - 00:11:21.654, Speaker C: Forks does start to have people ask.
00:11:21.692 - 00:11:47.038, Speaker B: Question, okay, can we actually put in a fee? Can we actually make this token capture? So that, I think, is what's been really bearish for the market curve. Putting in fees, right? Putting in an admin fee of two basis points and then having that go toward a buy and burn and then having the price absolutely nuke right afterward. I think it was kind of the.
00:11:47.044 - 00:11:50.334, Speaker C: Market saying that, okay, maybe you have.
00:11:50.372 - 00:11:56.930, Speaker B: Some cash flows, but it's not a lot, and your inflation is still much higher than your cash flows, right?
00:11:57.000 - 00:11:57.620, Speaker C: So.
00:12:01.910 - 00:12:39.646, Speaker B: There'S ultimately not any easy way to say to new money that comes in and sees the space. Why are these good investments? If you can't articulate how this token has a moat, how this community has a moat, what exactly is the value accrual? And so that's why I do think that I'm not as dovish as some people are on Twitter. I mean, I'm a big long term believer in DeFi. I'm not as dovish as some people are. I do think it's going to be a fairly long rebuilding period, especially as we're in a backdrop of what I think is going to be a high bitcoin dominance regime in the next few.
00:12:39.668 - 00:12:44.500, Speaker C: Months, possibly a couple of years even. I think that.
00:12:46.550 - 00:12:49.394, Speaker B: The builders in DeFi are ready to build and they're ready.
00:12:49.432 - 00:13:00.034, Speaker C: To truly innovate and create stuff. I do think that the speculators need to be braced for more pain, especially.
00:13:00.072 - 00:13:07.558, Speaker B: If they're in their short term, because I think that there's still a lot of froth in the markets. There's still a lot of stuff that's not that rational that's happening.
00:13:07.644 - 00:13:13.658, Speaker C: And I think the max pain point, from my point of view, from what.
00:13:13.664 - 00:13:15.420, Speaker B: I can see, it's not really close yet.
00:13:16.350 - 00:13:39.458, Speaker A: I see we touched on this earlier, but does this crash invalidate any fundamental assumptions that you and other people have had about DeFi? And maybe also even more interestingly, does it validate any assumptions as well? Maybe things that continue to work. Even though we have seen such a.
00:13:39.464 - 00:13:49.400, Speaker B: Big drop, I think not a whole lot is invalidated per se. Aside from the idea of.
00:13:51.370 - 00:13:51.814, Speaker C: I think.
00:13:51.852 - 00:14:27.298, Speaker B: Governance tokens people have been a little bit too bullish on as a concept. Like you mentioned to me before, DeFi should be governance minimalized, not maximalized. Well, I think this whole wave of DeFi, especially the newcomers, you've had this big push into governance maximalization, right? The idea that this token can literally change anything at any point and therefore it's really valuable because you don't know what they're going to pump and dump next. They may decide to vote in some crazy pool and then those guys will want to pump that. Well, you know, this logic only really works in a bull market, right? As soon as you turn into a.
00:14:27.304 - 00:14:29.698, Speaker C: Bear market, all of a sudden it.
00:14:29.704 - 00:14:33.300, Speaker B: Doesn'T matter what you do, it's still going to new.
00:14:35.850 - 00:14:39.286, Speaker C: I have this general aristic that a.
00:14:39.308 - 00:14:58.682, Speaker B: Good sign that things will take a next leg down are when projects try to vote in tokenomics that try to pump the coin and it doesn't even pump for like 4 hours, it just pumps for half an hour and then it nukes, right? Or when people will try to do things like make the rewards vesting, right?
00:14:58.736 - 00:15:02.006, Speaker C: It's ultra bearish because it doesn't actually.
00:15:02.048 - 00:15:51.350, Speaker B: Accomplish anything and it's sort of like the last card that any of these can play. So once you play that TVL goes lower from the smaller players, but the bigger players can hedge anyway and they don't care, they're very mercenary about it. So you'll end up just having even less of a community if you do vesting. You'll just have whales basically farm the entire thing because they can handle the vesting and they can hedge it. So that's also a good sign that it's not going to go great. I think that these are some of the things that you'll tend to see where I think tokenomics people are putting a little bit too much focus on tokenomics. The ability of Tokenomics to ultimately fix adoption I think is a bit overstated.
00:15:51.350 - 00:15:54.846, Speaker B: I do think that that's a good thing, because that means that in this.
00:15:54.868 - 00:16:03.950, Speaker C: Bear market, people will go back and think about what innovation they're really bringing, as opposed to trying to take something.
00:16:04.020 - 00:16:11.218, Speaker B: That'S already worth a lot and then say, I've created something else that is a subset of this with one thing changed. Can I be worth that?
00:16:11.384 - 00:16:14.260, Speaker C: Right? So I think.
00:16:16.490 - 00:16:19.202, Speaker B: That'S going to be the direction that it goes toward.
00:16:19.266 - 00:16:23.686, Speaker C: I think in terms of validation, I.
00:16:23.708 - 00:16:25.494, Speaker B: Do think that AMMS have been quite.
00:16:25.532 - 00:16:29.302, Speaker C: Validated overall as a concept.
00:16:29.446 - 00:16:44.398, Speaker B: I think that you've seen a bunch of token sales happen on AMMS, you've seen a bunch of projects really bootstrap their liquidity through AMMS uniswap as well as balancer as well as others.
00:16:44.484 - 00:16:47.226, Speaker C: So I think that is very healthy.
00:16:47.258 - 00:16:54.178, Speaker B: To see and that's even happening now uniswap volumes are still decent, balancer volume is still okay.
00:16:54.264 - 00:17:00.526, Speaker C: So I think it kind of does show that even if people are losing.
00:17:00.558 - 00:17:03.634, Speaker B: Money, they still find it convenient to.
00:17:03.672 - 00:17:07.666, Speaker C: Trade on a Dex on a web wallet.
00:17:07.778 - 00:17:16.600, Speaker B: So I think those are good signs and those do validate the idea that something has been created here of lasting value and people can build on that.
00:17:18.510 - 00:17:18.826, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:17:18.848 - 00:18:10.154, Speaker A: So since you brought up AMMS, one project that basically marked, basically the top of the DeFi Hype cycle is uniswap. With the launch of its uni token. You can farm uni by being an LP in one of four uniswap trading pairs and then stake these LP shares in the uniswap dao. And by doing that, you earn uni rewards. So I am farming this and so it's very interesting to me, and I would like to use this as a segue basically to talk about market making in general. Last week you wrote an article that was very well received for derebit called Toxic Flow its Sources and Counter Strategies. Maybe let's start with that.
00:18:10.154 - 00:18:13.610, Speaker A: What are the main insights from that article?
00:18:15.150 - 00:18:35.330, Speaker B: So I think AMMS are revolutionary in the sense that anyone can now be a market maker 24/7, right? Their liquidity is posted on the Internet and anyone can buy or sell from it. So I think that's important to understand first and foremost.
00:18:36.070 - 00:18:41.186, Speaker C: Now with that, you have takers as.
00:18:41.208 - 00:18:57.346, Speaker B: Well who are trading a lot of volume. So when you see very high uniswap volumes, the questions might be, okay, well, those volumes are so high, but what are they doing? Right? Are all those people clicking on web wallets? Are all those people just fascinated by trading for MetaMask?
00:18:57.458 - 00:19:00.586, Speaker C: I think the answer, if you look.
00:19:00.608 - 00:19:11.066, Speaker B: On Chain, is definitely not right. What's actually happening is people are arbitraging between the price on the AMM and the price on a centralized exchange.
00:19:11.258 - 00:19:17.146, Speaker C: So for pairs like tokens, like smaller.
00:19:17.178 - 00:19:27.410, Speaker B: Tokens, you may actually find that the price discovery is mainly occurring on uniswap. But for a lot of other tokens, say, ether itself, that's definitely not occurring mainly on uniswap.
00:19:28.710 - 00:19:35.638, Speaker C: It's occurring on centralized exchanges, right? Like Coinbase, Bitfinex and others.
00:19:35.724 - 00:19:38.054, Speaker B: So what that means is that every.
00:19:38.092 - 00:19:42.374, Speaker C: Time the ETH price moves, people are.
00:19:42.412 - 00:19:54.294, Speaker B: Competing to do the trade on uniswap and then hedge it with the centralized exchange. So that whole process of arbing the.
00:19:54.332 - 00:19:57.418, Speaker C: DAX, as you can call it, is.
00:19:57.504 - 00:20:25.590, Speaker B: What'S really generating a ton of this volume. And so you might ask the question, okay, so these guys are obviously all making money because they obviously will only trade if they make money. But the AMMS all seem happy. They all have their money in there, so they seem to be making money. So who's losing money, right? Or have we just created an infinite money machine? And the answer is no, you have not created an infinite money machine. What you have created is two things.
00:20:25.660 - 00:20:28.834, Speaker C: One is a belief that the assets.
00:20:28.882 - 00:20:47.530, Speaker B: In this pool are correlated enough that the up and down movements are relatively safe to be indifferent between. So what that means is that one of the two assets in your uniswap pool is not going to go to zero, right?
00:20:47.680 - 00:20:50.586, Speaker C: If that goes to zero, that's what.
00:20:50.608 - 00:21:12.258, Speaker B: The kids call like a rug pull, right? It's when you have a token in a pool and ether in the pool, and then one day you wake up and the token is worth zero. So you ended up, by being in the pool, you ended up now owning zero, ether and a lot of token. So that's impermanence loss in a nutshell, where you basically get stuffed with the.
00:21:12.264 - 00:21:14.626, Speaker C: One that's worse and you don't have.
00:21:14.648 - 00:22:12.310, Speaker B: The one that's better. So I think that that price right now, people don't really I mean, it's already very and I mean, I think what essentially being AMLP is, is you're actually buying a unlicensed structured product is what you're doing. You're buying a what an unlicensed structure. Know, in, in Korea, a very common structure product is called the worst of put. And the worst of put. So a normal put is when you sell a put and that means that you agree to buy something at a lower price if it's out of the money. You agree to buy it if it gets there, right? So if the price blows through there, then you're losing money because you sold that put and you get assigned the person who bought the put from you, they say, okay, I'm going to sell it to you now at the put strike.
00:22:12.310 - 00:22:42.570, Speaker B: Here you go. So a worst of put was invented by investment bank sales, devious as they are. And they said, okay, well, why don't we put three assets into a basket and we say to the client, how about you're selling a put not on one stock, but on the worst of three stocks, right? And the guy's an idiot, so he doesn't really care. So he'll go and say, okay, well, what's the yield?
00:22:42.650 - 00:22:43.182, Speaker C: Right?
00:22:43.316 - 00:23:25.166, Speaker B: Because you're getting a premium when you sell a put and obviously the yield is much higher the more stocks you put into the basket, right, because given sufficiently many stocks in a basket, the certainty that one will go to zero is like 100%, right, even if it's large caps. So that whole process became a very fun game for investment banks for a few years and then regulators started saying, what's going on here? How do you do this? And so now it's generally capped like they only put three stocks in and they're very blue chip ones usually. But yeah, it's something where it's similar to that, right? You are going to get the asset that is the worst. And the question is, are you paid enough in the meantime that it was.
00:23:25.188 - 00:23:27.120, Speaker C: All worth it, right?
00:23:27.730 - 00:23:50.674, Speaker B: So no one is really doing that math that closely aside from the big sort of industrial scale farmers of Uni that are out there, and Sushi as well. We all know that there are quite a few industrial scale farmers of Sushi as well. And for those guys, what they'll be thinking about is, how do I hedge my risk?
00:23:50.722 - 00:23:51.030, Speaker C: Right?
00:23:51.100 - 00:24:36.350, Speaker B: How do I use options on derivate? Because those are the only place where that's liquid enough to buy huge size. You have to go there and basically buy out of the money calls, out of the money puts and hedge your risk. That indeed one of the assets. You wake up one day and one of the assets goes down to 50% or goes up 50%, right? And if you back test crypto, that happens all the time. So I think right now it's quite fascinating to me that DFI has generally gone up in a period of bitcoin, going very flat, right? It's basically been very range bound in ten k to twelve k range the past few weeks. And ETH itself has also been relatively range bound between 310, 320 and 480.
00:24:36.510 - 00:24:38.606, Speaker C: So I think that the D five.
00:24:38.648 - 00:24:42.150, Speaker B: Markets, a lot of these primitives have been generally.
00:24:44.010 - 00:24:45.074, Speaker C: In that kind of environment.
00:24:45.122 - 00:25:54.826, Speaker B: Where it hasn't really been tested how people will behave if you start to get some serious impermanence loss. So I think that if you're not hedging, it's probably going to go bad at some point as a guarantee, because you're basically selling volatility, and that's inescapable because you know that your hedge is to buy strangles, right? It's to buy straddles. To buy strangles. So if you don't buy them, then you're not flat, you're actually short. That's what's paying for everything, right? It's the fact that if one day people wake up and Donald Trump says he's buying all the bitcoin he can, and bitcoin doubles, that if you're in the ETH WBDC pool, you wake up and you see that you actually don't have much WBDC, you have all ETH, and then you think to yourself, that's unfortunate, right? So that hasn't happened yet because of the relatively low volatility environment that we're in. Historically low volatility environment. But I think it's a huge mistake to think that lasts forever.
00:25:55.018 - 00:26:07.700, Speaker A: So you mentioned buying strangles and straddles. What does it take to buy those? Are those individual products on derribit, for example?
00:26:08.550 - 00:26:23.686, Speaker B: Yeah, you just buy an out of the money call, out of the money put, and then at least if the prices go up, you're covered for that. And the uni rewards you're getting and the fees you're getting, it pays for the premium on your options.
00:26:23.868 - 00:26:24.262, Speaker C: Right?
00:26:24.316 - 00:26:56.578, Speaker B: So all the big industrial scale players are doing this because one is their size is big, right? If people are playing around with a few hundred k or tens of thousands, you're ultimately trying to save yourself from losing tens of thousands, which is not a lot of money, right? But if you're farming with like 50 mil, 100 mil then you start to say, okay, I don't want to do it as a game, right? I want to do it like ASIC farming itself. ASIC mining itself.
00:26:56.664 - 00:26:57.300, Speaker C: Right.
00:26:57.910 - 00:27:26.554, Speaker B: So there have been a lot of these products that have been launched in both China as well as in the US. I think CoinList has one and there's a few in China I can't name that have them as well. But many of those will be hedging in some intervals with different strategies, I felt, to buy some. I think that ultimately those guys will be fine because they understand the math very well and they'll even pull out.
00:27:26.592 - 00:27:28.010, Speaker C: If the math goes bad.
00:27:28.160 - 00:27:33.120, Speaker B: But I do think that the math is capable of going very bad.
00:27:35.250 - 00:27:35.662, Speaker C: For.
00:27:35.716 - 00:27:41.200, Speaker B: People that don't hedge because they won't have the gains on their hedge legs to offset when the markets start moving again.
00:27:41.570 - 00:27:51.310, Speaker A: Right? So you hedge your LP shares with Options and you mentioned you also hedge your reward tokens.
00:27:51.390 - 00:28:28.874, Speaker B: I suspect hedging reward token is an interesting question. I mean, I can't comment on what we do, but of course I will say that a lot of people do hedge rewards similar as they might hedge bitcoin mining rewards, right? If they think that they're going to farm this amount of bitcoin, they'll definitely overhedge it in a neutral environment because they want to lock in their profits. So you definitely see some of that going on in the farmable coins. And I think that's just prudent, right? Because if the price goes up, you just become richer, and if the price goes down, well, you're glad to have been hedged.
00:28:28.922 - 00:28:32.506, Speaker C: So I think that in a way.
00:28:32.548 - 00:28:33.540, Speaker B: That kind of shows.
00:28:35.430 - 00:28:36.478, Speaker C: The ultimate irony.
00:28:36.494 - 00:29:06.326, Speaker B: Of yield farming, right? Because the yield farming, or like generalized liquidity mining, the initial idea was that you were going to distribute the coins of your protocol to people that are using it the most, right? And that by this process, it would be the fairest distribution and it also achieve sort of the most motivated participants.
00:29:06.438 - 00:29:07.386, Speaker C: Like in it, right?
00:29:07.488 - 00:29:30.254, Speaker B: But in practice, what has happened is that the largest players in crypto itself just use it as a money market. They put capital in, they farm it, they hedge everything out, it's pure arbitrage, and they walk away with lots of money. In a way, it's similar to mining.
00:29:30.302 - 00:29:34.066, Speaker C: Right, where with GPU mining, let's say.
00:29:34.088 - 00:29:36.754, Speaker B: The GPU miner, he doesn't need to.
00:29:36.792 - 00:29:40.806, Speaker C: Care about any specific coin, he just.
00:29:40.828 - 00:30:05.118, Speaker B: Wants to mine the stuff that people want to buy. So if there are people buying some random GPU coin, then he'll absolutely mine it and dump on them and hedge it out. And when the coin dies, he'll move on to another coin. So money is sort of the ultimate GPU or CPU, right? Because you can use money in anything. There's no other machine needed, there's no.
00:30:05.124 - 00:30:08.094, Speaker C: Other proof of work needed, hence why.
00:30:08.132 - 00:30:23.490, Speaker B: You see a lot of heavy dumping because the participants who have the money, you've created a dollar auction whenever you create a yield farming scheme, right? You've created a dollar auction for people.
00:30:23.560 - 00:30:28.854, Speaker C: To come into your network and use.
00:30:28.892 - 00:30:45.530, Speaker B: Liquidity to bid for that dollar. And there's no promise that they will stay around and play house after they think the ROI is not high enough. Right. There's no such social contract and there's no such promise either.
00:30:45.600 - 00:30:48.582, Speaker C: So I think that in the beginning.
00:30:48.646 - 00:31:46.222, Speaker B: These projects probably got some hype out of it because the total value locks went up so much right on compound the TVL, first the strategy was USDT versus USDT, then it was Bat versus Bat. Now it's dai versus dai. And then they realized, okay, well, dye versus dai. Industrial farming is the least bad option because at least it makes dye supply pump, which then helps maker. And so there's that kind of logic to it where they've decided that that's the most allowable form of yield farming. But yeah, it's ultimately tied to that idea that you are distributing the token to people that are just going to sell it for dollars. But how do you do it in a way that people buying it actually make money in the end? You have to let the people that are buying it make money.
00:31:46.222 - 00:31:48.798, Speaker B: If you don't, then there's no real chance.
00:31:48.884 - 00:31:49.134, Speaker C: Right.
00:31:49.172 - 00:31:50.862, Speaker B: And so for uni, that would be the test.
00:31:50.916 - 00:31:51.422, Speaker C: Right.
00:31:51.556 - 00:32:02.782, Speaker B: If people are actually farming and holding uni, the question is what do they expect to achieve? What do they expect that they'll be able to get for their uni? Because they are very much paying for the people that are just farming.
00:32:02.846 - 00:32:03.810, Speaker C: Pure ARP.
00:32:05.930 - 00:32:29.770, Speaker A: So given that all these large firms, basically mine fully hedged, would you say that other market participants just underestimate or basically misvalue the combination of having, like a low return but with a very high sharp ratio? Because you can always use leverage, right, to increase the returns.
00:32:30.510 - 00:33:20.822, Speaker B: You can't really increase leverage, at least not yet. There's a project coming out that we recently invested in called Alpha Finance. They actually do allow you to leverage farm on uniswap. That's interesting. But you can't really use leverage in the traditional markets, I mean in the farming markets, because you need actual capital, right? Whether it's your capital or you're risking someone else's capital, it's still ultimately one unit of risk. It's atomic risk, basically. It's not like a derivative where you can go five x or ten x or 25 x, right? So I think that that generally gives a huge advantage to big players because they have the money, right? And as I alluded to in a Tweet, the main money in the space is not even from stablecoin whales or altcoin whales.
00:33:20.822 - 00:33:24.960, Speaker B: It's from bitcoiners, right? Bitcoiners have all the money because their coins are worth the most.
00:33:27.730 - 00:33:30.974, Speaker C: So what that means is that from.
00:33:31.012 - 00:33:32.994, Speaker B: What I know, bitcoiners make the most.
00:33:33.032 - 00:33:35.246, Speaker C: Money in DeFi yield.
00:33:35.278 - 00:33:48.438, Speaker B: Farming because they have the most money to begin that. That kind of has become a basic yield. It's ultimately a BDC denominated yield for.
00:33:48.444 - 00:33:49.430, Speaker C: A lot of folks.
00:33:50.970 - 00:34:23.794, Speaker B: That, I think, is the ultimate irony of DFI, where the populist narrative on Twitter is that bitcoiners don't understand DFI like tone vase. He doesn't even get that uniswap can't be stopped. But in reality, there's a lot of quiet bitcoiners with 50 to 100,000 bitcoin, like large scale. And if they deploy even 10% of this into DFI, that's what happens, right? Because ultimately, the base reserve of crypto is BTC, right?
00:34:23.832 - 00:34:36.514, Speaker C: It's got the market cap and it's got the liquidity. So I think that reality means that.
00:34:36.552 - 00:35:03.360, Speaker B: All yield farming ends up being done by people who view it as a money market. And that's not to say that they're naive either, right? I mean, these guys read the code, they read the solidity code. They hate solidity or they hate ethereum, but they read it. So it's this honey thing where they view it just like mining, right? Like, they may mine litecoin, they may mine Zcash, they may mine other coins, but ultimately they view it as a business.
00:35:03.810 - 00:35:07.406, Speaker C: So I think that that's ultimately the.
00:35:07.428 - 00:35:15.586, Speaker B: Reality in the space. So all yield farming projects today are being farmed in that way for a.
00:35:15.608 - 00:35:19.010, Speaker C: Very large percentage of their supply.
00:35:20.870 - 00:35:52.110, Speaker A: So, yeah, I mean, it's easy to forget that bitcoin is still 20 x larger than USDT even, right, which would be the second reserve currency of the space. So given that BTC denominated farmers capture most of the rewards of all of these tokens, is that part of why you think bitcoin dominance is going to increase over time? Especially these yields flow back into their base currency?
00:35:53.090 - 00:36:46.042, Speaker B: I think, yeah, that's one reason I see. The other reason I see is that WBDC ultimately is very bearish for think. You know, there are some arguments that because it hurts the ability of the bitcoin blockchain to receive fees for transactions, that it will therefore be more bullish for ether. But I think in the near to medium term, what it will mean is that if people come in and buy bitcoin up to can FOMO bitcoin from the ease of your decks, right, you can go from your ether straight to your WBDC. You can go from your stablecoin straight to WBDC. So I think that that effect in the near term will be much more pronounced than the theoretical effect, which is that bitcoin is on the ethereum chain.
00:36:46.106 - 00:36:49.600, Speaker C: I think that is something.
00:36:51.650 - 00:38:31.550, Speaker B: That is very bearish for ETH, because if you think about the uniswap pool, WBDC is one of the four pools that means that anyone can go from a lot of ETH to a lot of BTC very quickly. And because of the way that that market works, is that you probably don't have people sitting on a lot of WBDC to begin with as a natural user the natural users are all ETH holders on the Ethereum chain. So WBDC is not really held in that way. So in a sense the most likely flow is that ETH people sell that pool consistently for WBDC to diversify, right? So I think that that concept is something that people just need to be aware of as well. I think separate from that, I think there are going to be some headwinds for Ethereum over the next few months. I think as Vitalik has pushed toward a more roll up focused roadmap, I think ultimately it's more fundamentally sound. But I also think that it's going to be a wake up call for the community too because it does mean that a lot of the East Two research was probably wasted and also means that the TPS may not get to anywhere that allows mass scaling or anything resembling mass adoption anytime soon.
00:38:31.550 - 00:39:21.274, Speaker B: So I think that will be the challenge. I do think that all applications will still continue to use Ethereum and probably like other chains, if they make sense, they'll be very chain agnostic but they'll use Ethereum given that's where the users are now. But I think for ETH asset it'll be challenging environment for sure. Because ultimately that headwind of the long term roadmap being so ultimately not very scalable and also not very clear even at this stage. Several years later we're still at the same TPS and optimistic will only really get you to 200 TPS and it will force a lot of social coordination up the stack.
00:39:21.322 - 00:39:21.678, Speaker C: Right?
00:39:21.764 - 00:39:36.246, Speaker B: It just forces it into L2. You don't really solve that many issues and it creates centralization in terms of community in some sense too. So I think those are all things.
00:39:36.268 - 00:39:39.254, Speaker C: To be aware of, right?
00:39:39.292 - 00:40:08.046, Speaker A: And it's not just WBTC. Now, we also saw the recent launch of TBTC and at least in my little bitcoin bubble I'm seeing some people who would use TBTC but not WBTC because TBTC is trustless bridge, the first trustless bridge for any cryptocurrency. So that's interesting as that I get.
00:40:08.068 - 00:41:29.130, Speaker B: That I think the difference between TBDC and WBDC is very similar to the difference between Dai and USDT, right? Where I think keep is academically quite interesting that it can be done. But the thing that academics need to remember is that not everything that can be done should be done or not everything that can be done is more than an academic experiment, right? Because for players like us or for Alameda or for Grapefruit or any of the other big houses you want to get in and out fast, right? You want to get in and out of five K BDC, three K BDC to be able to do that you ultimately need that one to one peg somewhere. And I think that also has to be capital efficient. So that's very hard to do with a lot of the other more decentralized constructions. And then the question will be does the market care or not? Or do they trust BitGo, or do they trust the BitGo? Dow I think the answer is they trust the BitGo dao more than they trust the holders of whatever token has come up with to bootstrap, whatever new so called decentralized bitcoin is made up BitGo a dao. So WBDC is governed by a dao. Actually, this dao is quite powerful.
00:41:32.510 - 00:41:32.778, Speaker C: So.
00:41:32.784 - 00:41:39.610, Speaker B: If you send WBDC to the contract address, they can actually vote to retrieve it. So they have some interesting powers.
00:41:41.810 - 00:42:16.200, Speaker A: That's something that happens sometimes to people where they accidentally copy paste. One time I've seen this happen is when people try to add a token to a wallet at a custom token or to an exchange, then they accidentally copy paste the address into the contract address, into the address field. I want to send it. I was not aware that WBTC is governed by a dao. So interesting. I actually want to jump back.
00:42:18.190 - 00:42:18.554, Speaker C: To.
00:42:18.592 - 00:43:08.280, Speaker A: Uniswap for a moment, because there's one thing that has been on my mind for months, actually, and it's the question if so, in a central limit order book exchange, market makers tend to increase their spreads when volatility is high, basically to spread the inventory over larger level of prices. But AMM market makers don't do this at least yet. But you can do this, right? So my question is, even in uniswap, you can do this. So my question would be, do you actively manage inventory in IPS based on expected volatility? Is my logic here even sound that you should be doing this?
00:43:09.210 - 00:43:53.542, Speaker B: Yeah, if you're a market maker who needs to make money on trades, then yes, you should be doing this if you don't need to make money on trades. So people who LP in uniswap, they don't need to make money, right? They may prefer making money, but they don't need to. That's a key difference, I think. Tianjian at Amber. In the article he wrote with me, he made a very good point where he said that for a holder of an Ammlp token, he simply needs to personally be indifferent between these two coins somewhat. And he needs to believe that roughly over the long run, that these will outperform buying and holding the two of them. So as long as he believes this, then everything's fine.
00:43:53.542 - 00:44:40.770, Speaker B: And even if he loses money, it's the same as the Korean retail that buys social product, because he also thinks he's okay because most of the time he gets the coupon, but then once every four years you have a big crash, and then he ends up being long the worst of five stocks. I think that there's a lot of things that in theory shouldn't work because of efficient markets and because people are not dumb, but in practice they are working in DeFi because of the fact that even if it's dumb, it's still less dumb than other things that they may do right? And it still is some liquidity. For instance, that guy who puts it in the AMM pool, he may have been doing something even dumber with his money. He may have been trying to buy and sell levels. He may have been trying to get liquidated on BitMIx.
00:44:40.850 - 00:44:41.142, Speaker C: Right?
00:44:41.196 - 00:45:01.102, Speaker B: You have no idea what he was doing. There's no perfect solution. Not everyone can ARB everything all the time. Some people have to just own things. Some people have to just try to compete, not really with the market, but just with themselves. Just try to make a little bit more money every year.
00:45:01.156 - 00:45:01.470, Speaker C: Right?
00:45:01.540 - 00:45:41.142, Speaker B: So I think in that framework, then you quickly see why spreads probably aren't going to widen for announcements. Probably the simplest solutions will do okay better than people think. But yeah, there's definitely a lot of room for AMM innovation too. We backed a number of AMM competitors recently that have what we think are slightly smarter AMMS. But yeah, the market will decide because if there's an announcement and then price goes way up and then way down, uniswap LPs are happy. And if you were an LP in a smart pool where you widen, you wouldn't get that volume, right?
00:45:41.196 - 00:45:43.818, Speaker C: So then maybe your LPs would be.
00:45:43.824 - 00:45:54.974, Speaker B: Result oriented and then say, okay, I wish I was in the other pool. You never really know how people will think about it. If you try to always make money, you won't do any trades. That's also a good way to think about it.
00:45:55.012 - 00:45:55.600, Speaker C: Right?
00:45:57.090 - 00:46:05.280, Speaker B: If you always want to make money, then you should never be a maker, actually, because makers can by philosophy, never guarantee that they make money.
00:46:06.290 - 00:47:30.406, Speaker A: A lot of these AMA models get constructed on paper, right, in an academic context where you assume strong rationality, then they meet the real world where the market acts with bounded rationality and suddenly some model becomes dominant that kind of relies on people not being rational. Right. People have bounded rationality, such as uniswap, and becomes a new shedding point for liquidity. Important to keep in mind. One story that bubbled up yesterday was so on chain analysts found that someone borrowed a lot of WiFi on I don't know if it was cream or Aave, actually and then sent it to Binance, which makes it pretty. Likely that they were a short seller because for what other trade you would do that? Maybe market make the coin on Binance but the address was I guess associated with Alameda which mostly probably makes on their own exchange and not on Binance. So there was a bit of a shitstorm against them in response on social media and some telegram groups that I'm in.
00:47:30.406 - 00:47:33.040, Speaker A: So what do you think about that event?
00:47:34.530 - 00:47:45.566, Speaker B: I think it showed how early this whole space is, where people don't really understand trading and they also don't really understand what the goal of DeFi should be.
00:47:45.668 - 00:47:46.222, Speaker C: Right.
00:47:46.356 - 00:49:29.822, Speaker B: So I think, first of all, whether Alameda was short or not or they were short for a client or they were short for an inflow or they were hedging, it's completely irrelevant because for every trade that occurs in the market there needs to be a buyer and a seller. We can't all be bull tards and just like no one does any trades and it goes to infinity, it has to trade at every price up, someone has to sell for every buy even if it's going up, right? So to say that because he's short selling, it kind of just tells you the mood of the market, right, where it's kind of getting into an anger phase the market and they're looking for excuses or scapegoats. I think that what's very likely that they were doing, and also a lot of people do is that they're just arbing the centralized exchange against the decks, right? If you have most of Wi Fi sitting in terms of liquidity, if you have it sitting in the uniswap pool, in the Wi Fi ETH pool, well, if there's huge sellers on centralized exchanges, then you want to buy from those guys and then sell to the uniswap pool, right? But then you have to wait for your withdrawal from binance or wherever and that might take quite some time, might take half an hour. So you might want to borrow some Wi Fi and that way you have know in your account and as soon as the market nukes you can hit the uniswap pool, you can be the first to arbit basically. Obviously you can't do a flash loan because you can't close the loop, right? You can't buy Wi Fi USDT on binance using and then use that Wi Fi immediately to deliver to uniswap.
00:49:29.966 - 00:49:34.500, Speaker A: Centralized exchanges can never be part of exactly, exactly.
00:49:35.110 - 00:50:51.306, Speaker B: So you always need market makers to be borrowing lots of coins to be able to arbitrage centralized exchanges versus DEXes. That's actually what fuels a lot of the borrow and lending activity in the markets. It's not people short selling, it's not people doing crazy spoops or whatever, but it's really just market making. But I will say that even if they were short selling that there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. And like we saw with the Link short sell attempt on Ave, those guys got liquidated because the market was bullish and they realized they could push the price much higher than the liquidation price. So there's no risk free money in short selling, right? It takes quite a lot of conviction to short an asset because you can have an infinite loss on a short, right? You can lose your whole account on a short. So from that point of view, I think that the DeFi space in particular risks making themselves look a little bit silly if they go around trying to vilify short sellers because that's also the main point of Aave and Compound and Cream, right, which is that you have two sided liquidity, you have suppliers and borrowers.
00:50:51.306 - 00:51:18.246, Speaker B: If you now are mad because borrowers are selling your asset well, you're probably not cut out for DeFi, right? So I think that's kind of now become I think in the last few hours on Twitter, I do see people just saying, okay, yeah, he should be able to do whatever he wants. But you definitely have a few people that obviously are sitting on a lot of losses now and kind of trying.
00:51:18.268 - 00:51:19.570, Speaker C: To find things to blame.
00:51:19.730 - 00:51:24.326, Speaker A: Yeah, and I mean, also the borrower pays interest to the suppliers so the.
00:51:24.348 - 00:51:28.458, Speaker B: Supplier gets exactly, they get compensated exactly.
00:51:28.624 - 00:53:00.966, Speaker A: Whatever the borrower does with the money. And I mean, you have some people saying you can earn more interest by staking your wifey in a vault, in the governance vault, for example. But if everyone did that and nobody supplied cream and ave, then of course also basically whatever revenue people in the governance vault get would also be way lower. So I think basically it all balances out in the end. But this story was interesting to me not just because it shows kind of the irrationality that you described, but also because it kind of showcases a fundamental problem, something that really bothers me actually with Ethereum and DeFi lately, which is that it's getting easier and easier to track large accounts with software like Nansen. But I reckon that funds have even better proprietary data and tracking software. So in that sense, there's basically no on chain privacy and it's so much more deadly in DeFi chains and basically any kind of stateful chains than it would be in Bitcoin where basically transactions can't be frontrun or otherwise manipulated or against you in any way.
00:53:00.966 - 00:53:40.020, Speaker A: Right? So if I hold money in a Bitcoin account or send it to an exchange or send it to my whenever we kind of thing, you just hold it. There's nothing really malicious parties or other kind of market participants can do with your transaction. But when your transaction kind of interacts with the global state, then when they know what you're doing, they can mess up your whole transaction and future transactions as well. So how do you, as one of the largest firms in DeFi who is doing plenty of on chain trades, how does this lack of privacy affect you?
00:53:41.750 - 00:53:53.046, Speaker B: That's a very tough question because there's no solution right now in Ethereum, right? So most of the big players don't even bother trying to be private because they know that it's not worth the hassle of trying.
00:53:53.148 - 00:53:57.606, Speaker C: So especially if you own a large amount of supply, even if you try.
00:53:57.628 - 00:54:07.674, Speaker B: To deposit it to a centralized exchange and then withdraw it back, people can easily see it to you because who else would have done that, right? So there's absolutely no way to get.
00:54:07.712 - 00:54:10.474, Speaker C: Privacy and I think that that is.
00:54:10.512 - 00:54:20.926, Speaker B: A huge barrier to adoption as well because I don't think that companies want like imagine if everyone's bank account was just an Ether scan. Like you could go on Ether scan and I could just see how much.
00:54:20.948 - 00:54:22.278, Speaker C: Money you have in the bank.
00:54:22.474 - 00:54:24.242, Speaker B: You probably wouldn't like that too much.
00:54:24.376 - 00:54:28.946, Speaker C: So I kind of think that that.
00:54:28.968 - 00:54:37.670, Speaker B: Is a very understated problem in Ethereum. It mainly impacts whales, which is why I think it's not as talked about.
00:54:37.820 - 00:54:40.454, Speaker C: But I think that it's a huge.
00:54:40.492 - 00:55:01.434, Speaker B: Impediment for institutions to come in, huge impediment for privacy minded people to use DeFi. It's not unsolvable. I think people are working on it. But yeah, it's a huge issue, right, because one is what you mentioned, which is a minor front running, right, where you can actually have censorship very easily.
00:55:01.482 - 00:55:03.440, Speaker C: On chain through that.
00:55:04.050 - 00:55:05.760, Speaker B: But then two is that.
00:55:08.930 - 00:55:09.406, Speaker C: You could.
00:55:09.428 - 00:55:15.826, Speaker B: Have all your trades be seen. So basically you have to justify that.
00:55:15.848 - 00:55:20.660, Speaker C: You'Re buying or you're selling, right. Whereas in practice, in the stock market.
00:55:22.550 - 00:55:34.630, Speaker B: When Bill Ackerman buys stocks or he sells, he doesn't have to tell the world why he's doing it. He doesn't have to tell people, yeah, I'm bullish now, that's why I'm buying or I'm bearish now he doesn't have to give a speech about it, he can just do it.
00:55:34.780 - 00:55:35.286, Speaker C: Right?
00:55:35.388 - 00:55:37.240, Speaker B: But in Ethereum D Five.
00:55:39.530 - 00:55:40.166, Speaker C: There'S this.
00:55:40.188 - 00:55:56.686, Speaker B: Big meme around like, oh, you never sell, or oh, you never do this, you never do that. And so Blue Kirby had that issue, right, where he said, I'm selling from my ENS address and I'm going to buy back somewhere else because I don't want everyone to follow my 30 WiFi all day long.
00:55:56.788 - 00:55:57.440, Speaker C: Right.
00:55:58.130 - 00:55:59.200, Speaker B: So I think.
00:56:03.430 - 00:56:07.858, Speaker C: That kind of a community feel or that kind of a.
00:56:07.864 - 00:56:39.418, Speaker B: Mantra is definitely not healthy. It's definitely not the underpinnings of actual global finance. Right, and it's a very provincial kind of a mentality. So I do hope that people do build the needful tools there and get it to a level where it's actually usable by real firms, by real people that just want to do finance. They don't want to be in a community, they don't want to be on Twitter talking about coins all day, they.
00:56:39.424 - 00:56:46.046, Speaker C: Just want to use finance because that's real people. Right? And I think that Ethereum does run.
00:56:46.068 - 00:56:53.220, Speaker B: The risk of being a circle jerk in that respect, where it's mainly an elitist or.
00:56:55.030 - 00:56:56.866, Speaker C: A very niche kind of.
00:56:57.048 - 00:56:58.580, Speaker B: Subculture in the end.
00:56:59.670 - 00:57:47.742, Speaker A: Yeah, totally agree. And I think the wifey borrower story also shows that the game theory just changes completely between a paradigm with hidden information and one with open information. It's not necessarily unwinnable when basically all your information is private and maybe that all of that, the smaller players is hidden. But it requires some changes in strategy, right? If you're a whale, if the market is so fickle and people are paying so much attention that borrowing WiFi on Ave, that alone can basically make people dump, then basically firms should start doing that as a bluff.
00:57:47.806 - 00:57:49.650, Speaker C: Right? Yeah.
00:57:49.720 - 00:58:07.990, Speaker B: And then eventually it won't work and so it'll all be equilibrium. But the bigger danger is that these kinds of things become very normalized, that people just track whales all day and they enjoy the game.
00:58:08.060 - 00:58:08.534, Speaker C: Right?
00:58:08.652 - 00:58:44.954, Speaker B: Because if you're going to build a global financial system, you have to move beyond that. And if you're not able to move beyond that, then the big money won't come and play, right? They won't want to join these games. It has created some very interesting money games and there are definitely ways to exploit those games and exploit psychology. But it's a little bit sad for me to see, too, because I think that if Ethereum had better on chain privacy or had some ways to get at that, then I could see it being much more usable.
00:58:45.022 - 00:58:45.302, Speaker C: Right?
00:58:45.356 - 00:59:14.506, Speaker B: I mean, everyone knows the top 20 addresses pretty much who they are in terms of farming, in terms of trading. And I will say people are generally pretty good about non doxing, but at the end of the day, it's a very small community, and I don't see how newcomers will be that comfortable with having all their financial transactions seen globally.
00:59:14.618 - 00:59:15.134, Speaker C: Right.
00:59:15.252 - 00:59:43.650, Speaker B: I just don't think that to a newcomer seems strictly worse than how finance already works. Like way worse. Because you're telling the guy he can both lose all his money from a hack. And by the way, most custodians don't support these smart contracts yet, but also everyone can see your transactions, so they can see when you capitulate, they can see when you buy, they can see all these things. I just think it's not going to fly.
00:59:43.810 - 00:59:56.150, Speaker A: I think it's a bit of a sober way to end this episode. But thank you very much for the discussion was fascinating. I don't say this a lot, but think you leaked some real alpha.
00:59:57.050 - 00:59:59.398, Speaker B: All right, take care.
00:59:59.564 - 01:00:05.530, Speaker A: Take care. It's.
