00:00:00.730 - 00:01:11.700, Speaker A: Welcome to Uncommon Core, where we explore the big ideas in crypto from first principles. This show is hosted by Su Zu, CEO and chief investment officer of Three Arrows Capital, and Me Hazu, a crypto researcher and writer. This is part two of our conversation with Matti and Fiscantis of Z Prime capital. While the first half was more philosophical in nature, this time we talked exclusively about different blockchain projects and how they might connect to each other in the future. I believe that with gas fees in ethereum being as high as they are right now, the advent of sharding and layer, two solutions, and the first credible ethereum competitors like polka dot Cosmos and Solana coming to mainnet this topic has never been more relevant. In this episode, we covered why Z prime invests in polkadot and its ecosystem, different approaches to interoperability binance smart chain, and what role bitcoin and ethereum will play in a multi chain future.
00:01:13.990 - 00:02:04.782, Speaker B: I actually want to talk to you about polkadot, because polkadot, I think it's is it top five. I haven't checked for like a week or so, but it's a project that's very high in the rankings. It has a very large community, but nonetheless, it is quite difficult to find good information about the state of its ecosystem. And as we covered in the first part, these investments are actually all about narrative and the memes. So the community is always, like, a really important part of thesis for me when I want to invest in something. That's why I think it's great to have two people here who have a lot of experience with the polkadot ecosystem and can tell us something that we might not be able to learn on twitter necessarily. From what I know, you're one of the bigger investors in the polkadot ecosystem.
00:02:04.782 - 00:02:17.970, Speaker B: Can you quickly summarize how polkadot's architecture and vision differ from that of ethereum? Because we have a lot of listeners who are very intimately familiar with ethereum but may not be with polkadot.
00:02:18.050 - 00:03:03.382, Speaker C: Yeah, maybe just let me give you a brief kind of intro to POCA, like, how did we come across POCA? So for me, it's more of a personal thing. So I actually read the paper. I don't know, it was the first white paper. I think it was like December 2016. Like, crypto was a new thing for me back then, and actually the first crypto fund that I was involved with, gavin was an advisor. So throughout 2017 and 2018, I had the privilege of talking to him. And for me, it was very much also like a personal bed.
00:03:03.382 - 00:04:02.970, Speaker C: So I saw this person I know that Gavin, he's a bit of a controversial figure, but I saw this entrepreneur, and for me, the way he talked about the project, the way he talked about polkadot, was something that sort of instilled this conviction within me. So I was lucky to be there early and to kind of see the vision very early on. And Gavin saw it. I think he even discussed it publicly as kind of the original vision of ethereum. And that was something that stuck with me. And for me, it was a bet on the founder of the project from the get go. And then as things kind of progressed, I saw that these visions are materializing.
00:04:02.970 - 00:05:10.640, Speaker C: When substrate, the tooling for polkadot was released, it was clunky and all that. But when we had some of our friends have a look at it, they were was you could say that I was lucky to be there early on and to kind of had this bias instilled in me because I was around this founder. And then it kind of funny thing is that we actually zprime founders, co founders and partners, we have all first met at a polka event that actually I wasn't running well, I sort of created this event in Brett slava Slovakia. It was like mid to late 2018. It was before vet free was even doing polka dot meetups. It was polka dot, ocean protocol and hive one event. And we all met there.
00:05:10.640 - 00:05:44.874, Speaker C: I think Fiske, he thought that I'm some kind of polka shill, and he was very skeptical about me first. And it was actually Jacob that kind of connected us later on because we also met there. So chance played his role there. So I don't want to say that maybe if I was closer to a, I don't know, cardano founder, I would have a different bias or something like that. So it all started with a then, you know, the thesis was kind of confirmed. So I'll let maybe Fiskey to kind of elaborate on that.
00:05:44.912 - 00:06:16.360, Speaker D: No, I just add that I'm still probably the most skeptical guy when it comes to polka dot from our crew. So I still try to poke holes. I remember just reading the white paper during the ICO. Was it 2018 or 17? I don't even remember. But it was like a huge buzzword bingo. They made up a lot of terms like fishermen collaters, and I was really confused and I thought, it doesn't make any sense. So I passed on.
00:06:16.360 - 00:07:15.960, Speaker D: And when I met know it was interesting, but cardano seemed much more interesting to me technically. For some reason during that time. It was only like, what, one year ago when I really started to appreciate the tech and the vision behind it. I remember ed Berlin, 2019, when polkadot had its own conference and cardano held some sort of a small event somewhere with community. And the community were like three guys in a suit who looked really beaten down and tired. And polkadot was this lively ecosystem of really smart guys and developers even from ethereum and elsewhere, who were really eager to build something on polkadot. So this is where it first kind of clicked for me.
00:07:15.960 - 00:08:35.454, Speaker D: I'm also very interested in governance experiments. Like, I wrote an article about governance where I kind of dug deeper into DAOs and some sort of experiments on decentralized consensus layers and smart contracts. And I think one of my bigger criticisms around polkadot is that its governance seems a bit over engineered, especially so early when there is no real validation that it really works and they made it a bit more complicated. And I kind of feel that they may be focused more on this power structure and this governance side of things than some other aspects that are maybe more important. On the other hand, especially being close to guys from Hydra DX, I see a lot of unique features that substrate and polkadot offers that other layers or platforms really don't offer and are nowhere near offering. So I'm getting more bullish on it as time goes, with some reservations, of course. And yeah, being part of Zprime, you can't really be too bearish on polkadot because it wouldn't last too long.
00:08:35.454 - 00:08:40.226, Speaker D: I'm just so that's my personal experience.
00:08:40.328 - 00:09:45.862, Speaker C: With it so far maybe to kind of what people often I don't want to say don't get. But when starting to explain polka dot, I don't like being at frame as another L1 or being an ethereum killer. I always kind of try to explain it as like layer zero because it is a layer I don't know below or above, but ethereum could be a part of polka dot in theory. So you have this kind of relay chain that is kind of connecting the universe of polkadot and you have different sort of what they call parachain being on top of the relay, connected for relay, which kind of allows you to have this joint security or this kind of big, I think, fiske how did you put it? Like it's a NATO or something like this.
00:09:45.916 - 00:10:31.714, Speaker D: I mean, it's analogy and analogies are usually pretty weak arguments, but I like it because it kind of explains it pretty well. Ethereum, in my eyes, is like centralized empire with one loss, one consensus layer. And everybody tries to build businesses within that empire and maybe have some colonies like some side chains or L2s outside of it as well. Cosmos is another extreme where all these app specific chains called zones. In cosmos. They are independent. They need to bootstrap their own security, have their own validator set and they then connect freely via some sort of, let's call it, trade agreement.
00:10:31.714 - 00:11:55.380, Speaker D: So they are like independent nations within a free trade zone but they still need to figure out their own security and rules by themselves. And polkadot is somewhere in the middle where you have these semi independent entities called parachains where they can build their layer from ground up. But then if they want to be connected to the overall polkadot ecosystem, they need to be part of this security alliance, something like NATO where they pay some tax or some tribute to the ecosystem in forms of dots paying for parachain slots or like bonding dots in parachain slots. And for that they get shared security and better composability with the rest of the ecosystem. What some people don't understand about Polkadot is that you can have your own blockchain built on substrate, which can then communicate with maybe rest of Polkadot, maybe with Cosmos ecosystem or with ethereum. And you don't have to have parachain slot, so it's an option. So let's say HydraDX aims to be a parachain, of course, but if we didn't get it somehow, if Hydra wasn't a parachain, it still could serve as an independent substrate based chain with its own validators, with its own security, and it could still work quite well.
00:11:55.380 - 00:12:10.450, Speaker D: It doesn't have to be like this part of this inner circle if it doesn't want to, but it brings a lot of benefits. So obviously we and like almost everyone else in the Polkadot ecosystem, tries to be a parachain.
00:12:10.610 - 00:12:35.778, Speaker B: So the way I understand the parachains is that you don't just have one application per parachain, right? You might have one DeFi ecosystem that is one parachain. Yes. And you're saying that HydraDX is a project that you're incubating. It's a decentralized exchange. Correct me if I'm wrong. So what is the logic there to getting your own parachain instead of joining some pre existing DeFi parachain?
00:12:35.894 - 00:13:42.258, Speaker D: I really wish some more technical guys would be here from Hydra. But there are some parachains that are generalized, so they are like ethereum, they are smart, contract friendly, and you can build stuff on top of them, something like Moonbeam. And actually, I think SushiSwap is extending itself into Moonbeam to be part of Polkadot ecosystem this way, without needing to be a parachain or anything like it. But when you design something which is more complex, let's say, and which aims to be an integral part of the infrastructure, I think it's very beneficial to build it from the ground up, to design your own consensus and to kind of run your own chain. Because then you are able to tweak a lot of parameters which you wouldn't be able to tweak if you were built on some separate base layer where you inherit all the flaws and design choices of that base layer. Like Ethereum is a good example. You can't really mess with block time, right, if you are just building a smart contract project on top of it.
00:13:42.258 - 00:14:23.202, Speaker D: But when we are building Hydra, we don't think about it as just another dex like some uniswap clone. It's very different from it, the design is much different. And we think about it as a liquidity layer for Polkadot ecosystem and maybe the future of finance in the future. So for that reason, there are a lot of things you can really play with. One short example is that when you have an exchange, you can have multiple types of transactions. Some of them are just simple trades and others may be, let's say, liquidations. And when you are building it from the ground up.
00:14:23.202 - 00:14:43.542, Speaker D: You can actually differentiate between these type of transactions and you can, let's say, prioritize them in a different way. You are not forced to just accept them in a simple order. You can play with it more, you can maybe assign them different fees or different auction parameters or something like that.
00:14:43.596 - 00:15:30.118, Speaker C: I just wanted to add that basically this means you don't have to compromise the use case because of the underlying tech. You build the tech for specific use case. And if you're building this liquidity chain parachain, hopefully these critical issues, DeFi critical issues can be prioritized, say on a consensus level, so increasing chance of executing even in harsh condition, et cetera. So it allows you to custom build a technology for the specific applications that hopefully will emerge on top.
00:15:30.204 - 00:16:34.442, Speaker D: And yeah, there is this larger point, maybe you have read the article from Multicoin Capital which is basically their Solana investment thesis which says that the world computer should be architecturally centralized. Meaning that all the projects, all the DeFi or crypto financial projects should have common shared layer below them and it should be like super fast and scalable and all the jazz. But we are bullish on Solana, we are investors in Solana and we really think it's a great ecosystem and it will be a big player in the future. Even now it already becomes one. But I don't think that this is how the world will unfold or the world of crypto. I really believe that there are enough reasons for projects to build their own application specific chains. And they may connect to Cosmos, they may connect to Polkadot, they may choose some other way.
00:16:34.442 - 00:17:37.710, Speaker D: But eventually we will see this heterogeneous future of some big single specific use case chains or maybe some generalized chains like Ethereum that will be used for launchpad, as a launchpad for ideas and for quick bootstrapping of ideas. And then maybe these DeFi protocols which are built on Ethereum, they will span multiple ecosystems, they will try to bootstrap their own validator sudden become their own chain. And kind of basically what I'm saying is it won't be neat and elegant and unified one layer and then multiple apps on top of it, but it will be a huge mess of all these different kind of solutions for various reasons and even financial use cases. There are so many of them and they are so sometimes specific that being constrained to one layer and its rules. Even though the layer could be super fast, it's still very limiting and it doesn't unlock the full potential of what crypto offers.
00:17:38.850 - 00:18:24.414, Speaker B: So two things that I've become very skeptical about over the last years. One. The first thing that people get disillusioned about is scalability when they realize that scalability is actually distinct from throughput. And it's not actually scalability if you scale the throughput while also scaling the need to consume resources for example, making it harder for people to run nodes in the network and then you immediately realize that all these transactions per second numbers are actually completely meaningless. All the new projects quote that specialize in that. But the other one, and that's kind of where this hooks into our topic is interoperability. It was a very popular narrative for the last years that interoperability between blockchains will be possible.
00:18:24.414 - 00:19:02.140, Speaker B: It's always right around the corner. And I feel like your entire thesis around polkadot kind of hinges on this idea that parachute chains can communicate with each other in a seamless way and for example, it's not enough, right, that you can communicate with a 1 minute delay or whatever, right. That's already not great because it breaks the atomicity of transactions. So I'm kind of interested how that works and if you have actually seen any real proof that communication between parachains is actually as seamless as they say.
00:19:02.910 - 00:20:03.182, Speaker D: Yeah, I will start with the first point because it will be a quick one. We are seeing even now the generalized layers, even though they could be scaling to high TPS if you have too many DEXes on top of one layer, and Hayden Adams pointed it out recently on Twitter, there will always be arbitrage opportunities. And that means that the more DEXes you have, the more price differences you occur, the more trading activity happens. And on Ethereum right now, it seems like it looks like a cancer, a bit like there is growth in number of DEXes and number of trading pairs and trades, but the growth is killing the host. It's not healthy anymore. The marginal new dex that is launched on Ethereum is harming the space more than it's helping anything. So this is one of the reasons why even though you may have super high TPS, you will reach this limit sooner or later.
00:20:03.182 - 00:20:53.098, Speaker D: Like even Binance smart chain, it's basically Ethereum with much higher throughput because it's like centralized. But even there, if there will be too many DEXes and too much trading activity going on, it will consume all the block space nonetheless. And there is no easy redemption for it just to separate the various use cases on their own chains and validator sets and kind of make them talk to each other in some way. Maybe some of them won't even be fully composable with everything else. Maybe they will be partially composable and they will have delays in some cases, not just for scalability reasons, but also from the perspective of being secure because a lot of these things are less secure because of composability. And I will let Matty answer the second question about polkadot interrupt.
00:20:53.194 - 00:21:53.330, Speaker C: Yeah, so the XMP, the sort of the cross chain message passing is still not launched. So this is a critical component that will be released hopefully very soon. First probably on Kusama and then on Polkadot as well. So that is a feature that sort of enables relay to function natively and there's a difference, right, between having this relay, having this cross chain message passing, and having a bridge. Because bridge is something that you have to build again. Right? And still we have very few working trustless bridges in crypto. Interoperability, as you said, is always around the corner.
00:21:53.330 - 00:23:04.200, Speaker C: But I believe it is this year when we actually see this happening. Polkadot, in a way, is just another take on sharding, where you have these power chains being sort of their own shards and all of these are just different kind of framing of the same kind of solution and we don't know how it's going to look at the end. Right. And what I believe is the future is like very kind of flexible stack, so layered stack and very flexible. So I can imagine that there might be application that will be using different layers and you might not even know what layers you're actually using, what kind of middleware will be involved in that. And yeah, that is also part of our kind of middleware thesis. But interoperability is, I believe this year we'll see big things.
00:23:05.210 - 00:24:06.474, Speaker D: We also have IBC from Cosmos being rolled out finally with Stargate Update. I'm just starting to play with Cosmos ecosystem right now as well, to see how it works, what is the state of wallets and the ecosystem in general. And I think it will be maybe even less than a year, maybe six months, and we will be sure if it's working or if it needs another couple of years, and then we can go back to some shabby bridges. Bridges are hard to build. Everybody early in Polkadot ecosystem was like saying, yeah, someone will build a bridge and we will just bridge it and it will be fine. And now people realize like bridges are hard and there is probably only one really decentralized bridge between two smart contract ecosystems, and that's ethereum and near protocol. And the set thing, is that the Rainbow Bridge? Yeah, I think that one is ahead of anything else.
00:24:06.474 - 00:24:10.454, Speaker D: Everything else is much more reliant on some centralized parties.
00:24:10.502 - 00:24:12.094, Speaker B: How does it can you remind me how it works?
00:24:12.132 - 00:24:52.742, Speaker D: Again? Not really. Right now I would need to dug it up, but I remember reading it that it uses smart contracts on both ends that just lock assets and it kind of works well together. But the thing is that near doesn't have nearly as much traction and hype as other ecosystems. So we may not see it being too used very soon. I hope it will get used and tested in practice because that's always what matters. Everyone has this cool technology put in the paper and maybe even on some proof of concept production, but only under heavy load. You can see what really works and what doesn't.
00:24:52.886 - 00:26:34.170, Speaker C: Yeah, and there are also different concepts of building bridge. I think what they say is that Bridging two proof of stake system is easier than Bridging ethereum with nier or with polkadot. But I think that if we go back to cosmos, as fisky was mentioning, most teams that most I don't want to say capable teams, but the most capable teams that we saw, we invested in building on tendermint, have no allegiance to cosmos ecosystem. There is no cosmos ecosystem. I mean, maybe there is, but polka dot, with its first web free summit, you could already see that there's an actual kind of identity of polkadot. But do you even know that torchain took tendermint and completely changed it, or know these are very technically capable teams? And granted, I mean, tendermead was there much sooner than substrate, but then again, I don't know how much. I mean, I know that a lot of effort went into sort of changing the core tech that they took from tendermint, right? So that's the big difference, right? I think Cosmos is kind of trying to replicate what Polkadot has done right now because they realized that their approach probably wasn't I don't know whether there was an intent to create a community or not, but Polkadot started as this identity.
00:26:34.170 - 00:26:59.540, Speaker C: And now they're sort of trying to they're now technically bridging these different projects within the system, whereas Cosmos just didn't really have that. The tendermint and cosmos wasn't as much connected as substrate and polkadot. I mean, that's my perspective. So maybe I'm wrong, but this is how I see it.
00:27:00.150 - 00:28:14.362, Speaker D: One way to look at it is that cosmos is a bit less coordinated, but a bit more decentralized and grassroots because it doesn't have a shelling point asset like dot. It has atom, but you don't need atom to start being a part of even inner cosmos ecosystem, and it doesn't have such a big backing of entities such as webtree foundation and parity. So it's a bit more grassroots. It will take a bit more time. It will be much more messy, I would say, and let's not kid ourselves, even ethereum, which is right now the pinnacle of everything, it got pretty bootstrapped, pretty much bootstrapped by Joe lubin and consensus. And they poured a lot of money into the space to build developer tooling, which is one of my other strong opinions, that TPS and all the JS doesn't matter too much if you don't have really good developer tooling. So developers can build cool stuff very quickly, experiment and roll out new features very quickly on your chain, which ethereum is like light years ahead of everything else.
00:28:14.362 - 00:28:33.038, Speaker D: And that's why we have seen, like, binance chain being built on tendermint not getting too much traction. And then they built binance smart chain, which is basically clone of ethereum so they can copy all the devtooling and all the smart contracts from ethereum without too much oh, I didn't even know.
00:28:33.044 - 00:28:36.734, Speaker B: That binance pivoted from the tendermint chain. That makes a lot of sense.
00:28:36.772 - 00:29:02.726, Speaker D: I mean, it's kind of messy. They still have both, so they have like, binance chain and binance smart chain. For example, if you interact with Torchain, you can do it via BEP, which is like the Tendermint chain. But a lot of this new stuff like Pancake swap and all these clones of Uniswap and other projects which are popping on Binance chain now are popping on Binance smart chain. So they have two blockchains. One is Tendermint and one is Ethereum clone.
00:29:02.838 - 00:29:23.940, Speaker C: Yeah. And when we talk about Tendermint, that's also kind of unclear. Right? Because you wonder what the play is there. Because I think Paradigm is invested in tendermint. So you can say that Cosmos ecosystem has a major player backing them, but I don't know what the play is there. So it's pretty interesting to see it play out.
00:29:25.190 - 00:30:22.338, Speaker D: From what I understand, they realize that for any concrete chain to become a hub or this dominant player and to accrue value, they need to have a deep liquidity. That's why Atom or Cosmos, the chain, is also building B Harvest, which is like liquidity protocol for Cosmos and the Restore chain as well, which is part of Cosmos ecosystem, loosely set. So, yeah, liquidity, I think liquidity is the key for all of these projects. And it's cliche to build a Dex. Now, there are so many DEXes with so many flavors, and even with Hydra, we kind of feel that we are already in a pretty red ocean. However, we are proud to say that Hydra is very different from anything else. And we really believe that liquidity is one of the key properties of decentralized finance and that the best solution should accrue a lot of value.
00:30:22.338 - 00:30:30.706, Speaker D: And this is the backbone of DFI, like having deep and maybe even capitally inefficient and redundant liquidity.
00:30:30.818 - 00:31:23.640, Speaker C: I just wanted to add that it's very interesting how 2017 was kind of or even slightly before that. There was a lot of macro bullshitting like Fed protocols. I mean, for the time it was great. Interesting, right? But it was sort of replaced by this very kind of particular I don't want to say micro masturbation, but D, five very specific things, AMMS, et cetera. And it's almost as an overcompensation from these web free general pieces to very specific things. And now we're trying to maybe, perhaps correct and try to get into find a balance there. So it's very interesting how it evolves and even understanding AMMS and the very kind of nuances and the small differences between all of them.
00:31:23.640 - 00:31:31.530, Speaker C: It takes a lot of time, and you have to have some preexisting knowledge of financial markets and et cetera.
00:31:32.110 - 00:31:35.526, Speaker B: And the promise is something like Polkadot and Cosmos.
00:31:35.558 - 00:31:35.706, Speaker C: Right.
00:31:35.728 - 00:31:50.010, Speaker B: I think it's that if anyone launches a token, even if it's on a different power chain, then they can still natively access that token on your power chain. Right. So every token is available on every power chain.
00:31:50.170 - 00:32:42.334, Speaker D: Yeah, I think that's the end game. But there are some reservations to it. Like I said earlier, sometimes the composability is not desired in every case for 100% of what you can do with it. There may be parachains or cosmo zones that will for any reason, they may restrict composability. For example, they may just whitelist some assets that are already proven and that are not toxic. Or they may restrict the way how smart contracts from other chains operate within their own parachain or zone just because they think that maybe the security is higher priority than full composability. Right now on Ethereum, you don't really have the choice too much.
00:32:42.334 - 00:33:23.950, Speaker D: I mean, you can do some things, but sometimes being fully composable means that you are exposed to all the external risks you cannot really control. And then when something big fails, there is this cascading effect of shocks inside this system which you cannot really escape and that will affect you with fees growing, liquidations, some prices may lose back and stuff like that. I'm not saying that we should abandon composability. I think it's one of the biggest features of the space. But there will be trade offs and some of them won't be 100% skewed towards the most composability.
00:33:25.010 - 00:34:08.954, Speaker B: I would like to go back to what you said a bit earlier about the future or the end game of blockchains. Kind of being that there's like one relay chain and doesn't have to be like the relay chain of polka dot or of Ethereum Two or whatever. But the idea that you have a lot of depth chains around that right. Because the developers really want to control the experience. And as I understand it, Substrate is basically a blockchain builder. It's almost like plug and Play, right, where developers can select from different features and parameters and kind of build their own blockchain and control the experience of their users much more than they can today on Ethereum. And I increasingly think that Ethereum is going to go in that direction as well.
00:34:08.954 - 00:35:20.434, Speaker B: So we only mentioned polkadot and cosmos, but I think that Ethereum is going in the same direction due to roll ups. So there's still a very prevalent narrative that the roll up game is almost like winner take all, right? It's like there will be one big roll up and the projects that coordinate on that roll up, all the projects will be on there in order to maintain their composability with each other. But I think there's also this completely opposite view of how it could play out and that is that roll ups are Ethereum's version of app chains where many apps will have their own roll up and they will be able to customize it. And I actually after learning more about how roll ups work and what actually their kind of drawbacks are, especially with regards to the security model, I think that's actually the far more likely variant that it's going to play out that way. I'll be interested in hearing how you apply these views to Ethereum from my, let's say.
00:35:20.552 - 00:36:02.474, Speaker D: Business point of view. I'm not sure how to call it better. There is not really that big of a difference between side chains, alternative chains and L two S. All of them require some sort of bridging, some way how to interact with the chain you start off from. And then there are different technical trade offs and scalability features and all the things you can kind of develop on top of them. And it's probably more of a semantic debt. Like if the particular thing is sidechain or L two XDI chain works quite well.
00:36:02.474 - 00:36:50.574, Speaker D: It's pretty centralized, but it's good enough for some projects to kind of scale into. Some of them may even span multiple ecosystems, have optimistic roll up base and also be on Moonbeam or on Polkadot. I can see this developing further. Definitely some applications will span into multiple directions at once and then they will just see what sticks. But yeah, definitely ethereum. Even without Ethereum 2.0 vision, without this full sharding, which would be very close to polka dot, ethereum can remain a dominant player just thanks to roll ups, just thanks to sidechains and bridges to other networks as well.
00:36:50.574 - 00:37:49.454, Speaker D: And even if Polkadot or Cosmos, let's say, version of the future will be dominant, there is still a good possibility that major player will still be Ethereum. It will become, let's say, a major Cosmos hub with a lot of activity, lot of liquidity on top of it. And if it bridges into Cosmos ecosystem, it can suck out a lot of activity into it. And just it's already happening today. There are some projects which are already being used on Cosmos ecosystem, like Terra. And Terra is bridging into Ethereum and the stablecoins that Terra offers and some other synthetic assets are also being used on Ethereum, right? So from my understanding, it doesn't mean that when we say that this is the future, like polkadot is the future, it's bearish for ethereum. It will change the landscape.
00:37:49.454 - 00:38:08.534, Speaker D: But it can change it in a way that even helps Ethereum to take off the pressure from the gas fees a bit while maintaining the things Ethereum excels at, which is like quick experimentation with a lot of highly interoperable and composable projects.
00:38:08.662 - 00:39:15.520, Speaker C: I think that, as I said before, that all these, whether it's polka dot Cosmos or ETH 2.0, I think they're in essence sort of converging on a similar vision, right? And it's just to raise I don't know if you remember, but there was a controversy with Afri when he once tweeted like Serenity or E 2.0 or polka delivers what ETH 2.0 should deliver, right? So basically he was right in a way, right? These are very similar set of goals and in a way you could think of it as a race, right? Like who gets there first and who offers this interoperability, scalability, whatever you want to call it first. So it's going to be interesting. I don't know how it will end, obviously. I just think that these ecosystems are not like mutually exclusive, right? It's not like it's going to be one or the other.
00:39:15.520 - 00:40:09.310, Speaker C: I think that the problem with Ethereum is that in a way it is a victim of its early success because there's a ton of infrastructure apps value on it, locked in ethereum's, DeFi, et cetera. And I think that kind of not only adds pressure, but sort of do these upgrades break sort of composability or break existing kind of infra existing smart contracts, et cetera. So I think that for them, for Ethereum, it's very difficult to kind of experiment at this stage. Right? So polka dot cosmos, they probably sort of can take more liberty with experimenting rather than just being very careful.
00:40:09.890 - 00:41:13.140, Speaker D: With regards to L two S, there is one thing I forgot to mention and this is like zero knowledge proofs in general, I would say that they can change how all this works very drastically in a way that are very hard to foresee right now. But every opinion and thesis I personally have about application specific chains and layer ones, I think it can all be changed dramatically if zero knowledge proofs will be more developed and we will solve the computational intensity of them. So this is like, let's say, black horse of scalability and infrastructure topic of blockchains. Like if we somehow make some breakthrough in using zero knowledge proofs, maybe we can throw all the rest of the stuff we are talking about right now out of the window. So this will be interesting to see in maybe next three to five years. Yeah.
00:41:15.270 - 00:41:25.160, Speaker E: It'S going to be interesting to see because there's a lot of different things going on now in I guess what I would call like deep tech primitives in crypto, where.
00:41:28.250 - 00:41:28.806, Speaker D: We don't know.
00:41:28.828 - 00:42:13.480, Speaker E: How it's going to play out because it's a narrowband phase of DeFi. So everything is super narrowband. We're really feeling the narrow band of ethereum now and we can kind of all imagine how great it would be if it was just broadband. But we don't know what broadband will look like and we also don't know how value will accrue to the things that bring broadband. So the fees weren't really high and now all the layer ones are going up a ton because people are like, well, if these things can bring scaling, if these things can help solve, then that would be great. Right. So AVAX near Kusama Cosmos as well, the past few days have been doing extremely well off of that.
00:42:13.480 - 00:42:30.614, Speaker E: And I do agree with you guys too, which is that it's actually better for Ethereum in the long run if sort of many other smart contract chains are trying to solve the issue of scaling because they can, one, learn a lot from these approaches.
00:42:30.662 - 00:42:30.874, Speaker D: Right.
00:42:30.912 - 00:43:17.514, Speaker E: I think a lot of the E two roadmap has changed from seeing what has been explored on other chains. And I also think, too, that it just gives it a lot of vitality and it gives it a lot of robustness to the process. So right now it's really interesting to see on ETH L2, where you have optimistic roadmap and then you also have the ZK Sync roadmap. And the trade offs there are quite different. And I think a lot of teams are now looking at Polkadot, they're looking at Cosmos, but it's still very early days as well. So I kind of see it as like it's very difficult if you're trying to build on Ethereum right now. And the frustration is real.
00:43:17.514 - 00:43:28.046, Speaker E: Among a lot of the application teams, we've invested in app teams where they have to delay main net because there's just absolutely no way they can get users to kind of interact with it.
00:43:28.068 - 00:43:28.254, Speaker C: Right?
00:43:28.292 - 00:43:58.870, Speaker E: And there's this big dark horse, which is, I think the real dark horse has been BSc, right, where they've just come in and said, okay, even though it's basically a POA, it's basically a proof of authority. But they said, well, it's almost like Ethereum. It's almost like DeFi. And then a lot of people are going and playing with Pancake, swap, these kind of things. And I think Andre, he said during a clubhouse talk, he said, if you're a D Five builder today, just build on BSc. Don't wait for L2. Don't do this.
00:43:58.870 - 00:44:21.374, Speaker E: Just put it out on BSc. And then at least you'll have something that people actually use for now because it costs you like deploy smart contracts on Ethereum right now. And the parachain auctions, they're still ongoing. And in terms of the spirit of the grassroots experimentation, my fear is that Ethereum will lose that for a while, and so hopefully with L2, it'll come back.
00:44:21.412 - 00:44:22.000, Speaker D: But.
00:44:24.950 - 00:45:07.438, Speaker E: I do agree that I think ZK would be a very strong approach in the long term, but the tech is still very new. I do generally see the next few months as like kind of a very volatile period in the whole application layer. Layer one space. There's some people speak to that predicting dot flipping of ETH. There's others talking about Salana flipping of ETH and all these kind of things. I mean, I generally don't buy into this kind of stuff as much because I think Ethereum has a massive network effect from the ERC 20 network effect and just from the MetaMask and Usability and Composability and developer Mind Share. I think that's a massive network effect.
00:45:07.438 - 00:45:23.620, Speaker E: And I think Ethereum actually benefits Net from the idea that blockchains are actually useful and that people are actually using web3. It's actually the biggest beneficiary of it, I think, to even the detriment of bitcoin in that sense.
00:45:24.790 - 00:46:34.742, Speaker B: Yeah, right. I think Ethereum can maintain itself for a long time by being a place, a settlement layer and a layer for very high value use cases. But that shows very nicely how Ethereum benefits from all these other chains. Because if Ethereum is only for high value use cases, then where is the place where people actually use a blockchain for the first time? Or developers actually deploy a blockchain project for the first time? It can no longer be on Ethereum. Maybe it can be on a L2, but more likely it will be on something that uses is basically a copy of Ethereum but is more centralized, right? Something like BSc. So it seems like BSc is going the route that kind of tron tried to go and kind of failed at it almost a little bit, right? I mean, it feels like they are realizing this vision a lot better at the same time. I think we see now didn't we see a decentralized futures exchange launch straight to L2? I forgot which one that was, but that must have been a couple of months ago and they are actually posting pretty nice volume.
00:46:34.806 - 00:46:43.150, Speaker D: Yeah, I think you are talking about perpetual protocol which we are also an early investor. I think we are first money in actually.
00:46:43.220 - 00:46:50.462, Speaker B: Well, that's actually great. So can you walk us maybe through their thought process and the challenges of launching straight to L2?
00:46:50.516 - 00:47:14.200, Speaker D: Yeah, sure. They didn't launch straight to L2. They had a Mainet Ethereum contract as well. They did an LBP and then they wanted to launch straight away. And they realized the gas fees are especially for trading use case. They are untenable even. It was like last year, September or something, I guess.
00:47:14.200 - 00:47:43.326, Speaker D: And they realized that a lot of these DeFi use cases right now are more passive. You provide LP, maybe you trade some spot from time to time. You yield, farm a bit. But when you want to do some more active trading with leverage, which you are usually doing with leverage, you are more active. Then the fees will be pretty cannibalizing to your P l. So they were researching a couple of options optimistic rollups as well. And they were discussing with this with me.
00:47:43.326 - 00:48:22.330, Speaker D: And then they went to Xdaichain. And the reason is that Xi Chain is also a copy of Ethereum. It's something between proof of authority and proof of stake. Right now I think it's more leaning towards proof of stake. There are a couple of validators, it's not really too decentralized, but it's good enough for some proof of concept kind of bootstrapping of fast DeFi experience. It was working well even before Binance smart chain was working well. I remember experimenting with Binance smart chain like last year in Summer and the experience was so awful.
00:48:22.330 - 00:49:05.530, Speaker D: Three times I thought I lost all my money somehow, so I ran away from it. And maybe I have a negative bias towards it right now because of my past experience. Maybe I missed out on it in recent days, but Xdai chain was working quite well. There were some other projects, porting to it, some NFT projects that are using it right now. MetaCartel is also like proponent of Xdai chain for some low value use cases. So they just basically tried it and they made it pretty easy to kind of start trading there. And yeah, they are seeing pretty nice volume.
00:49:05.530 - 00:49:57.260, Speaker D: I think per protocol is actually now responsible for majority of xdai chain volume already and yeah, they want to attract more users so they will release some trading incentives. So the real stress test I think is still ahead of them. But I would say that they are one of the best experiments on how to breach native ethereum into some other side chain which is very similar. And I'm not sure, I don't think they will stay there forever. I think they also will move somewhere else in the future or maybe they will span multiple ecosystems as well. But yeah, I think they are early example of this being viable. They are doing between $30 million or something.
00:49:57.260 - 00:50:14.500, Speaker D: I'm not sure now if it's like 30 million or what a day, but I need to figure it out. But yeah, they are pretty successful in it. I mean the biggest challenge is to get users using it on the other chain. Right?
00:50:15.190 - 00:50:20.450, Speaker B: Where do you guys see the role of Bitcoin in a world of increasing interoperability?
00:50:21.110 - 00:51:26.418, Speaker C: I think that when people talk about Bitcoin and talk about DeFi, somehow it's still framed as sort of similar or adjacent. But I think it's a totally different thing. Like Bitcoin is a defensive technology, it's something completely else and the future probably something like Brand has shown or some other bridges probably that is the only way to connect it. And I think the DeFi is trying to do something else. Bitcoin, as I mentioned, is like a defensive technology. It's going back to sort of like the I don't want to say Austrian economic foundations, but it's revanchist in that respect. Whereas DeFi is trying to kind of ride the wave of the current kind of monetary environment and it's pushing the boundaries and it's going to get increasingly kind of disconnected.
00:51:26.418 - 00:51:35.610, Speaker C: So we still will see Bitcoin in DeFi but I do not think that it's related at its core.
00:51:36.110 - 00:52:51.346, Speaker D: I think it's more connected. I think the narrative is still kind of disrupting traditional finance and Bitcoin is, let's say, disrupting gold and monetary policy of central banks and maybe Fiat a bit DeFi is disrupting all the rest, like financial services, leveraged products, all that jazz. So I would say they are kind of connected in a way, but they have very different core values and I think it's good that they do because we need both. I would say we need to have some petrol. I would say something that doesn't change too often that is really super simple and super stable and it's here for you whenever you need to just park money somewhere and just, I don't know, be super sure they are there. Five years later, Bitcoin has some long term problems with subsidies and stuff. But other than that, bitcoin tribes for this value, for this being hard to change, being reliable for the long run, being simple, while all the other stuff is like it can change under your feet, it moves fast, you know, you don't know what the next big thing will be.
00:52:51.346 - 00:53:34.340, Speaker D: So you are trying to cover everything and and just diversify. Whereas Bitcoiners, they don't really need to diversify. They have this one simple truth, one big story that they believe in and I think it's important story to have and to be able to go back to if, let's say, everything else fails, it's like a backstop and yeah, we see tokenized bitcoin being used in DeFi quite heavily as well. So I don't think it's going to change too much. But I mean, it's clumsy, it's not something that is super elegant, but it's happening and market demands it. So market will provide.
00:53:34.950 - 00:54:51.354, Speaker C: I think that the fact that bitcoin can get accepted much sooner than DeFi is also kind of key because I have come to realization that bitcoin has become like a Pascal's wager for the finance industry in general. Whereas DeFi is something completely divorced from. It is almost a mockery of financial system in a way, even think about it, how long did it take to some of the more legitimate investors, like traditional investors, to accept bitcoin still? There are only few in but DeFi. And I still think that even when they're in bitcoin, they still don't understand bitcoin. So it's purely a Pascal's wager for them and then try to understand DeFi and try to explain DeFi to someone who doesn't even understand bitcoin. I think there's a huge leap. So that's why I think they're totally kind of I don't want to say divorced, but they're separate things.
00:54:51.354 - 00:55:09.920, Speaker C: But I definitely think that bitcoin will exist in DeFi the same way it exists in CFI. Right? But I wouldn't kind of think that DeFi on bitcoin and that sort of thing. I don't know. That's interesting.
00:55:11.170 - 00:56:16.622, Speaker D: One sad realization I had a couple of weeks ago was when I realized that bitcoin is actually very CFI friendly. It's something that needs centralized infrastructure to kind of work well and to get adopted. And now all these banks are realizing it as well. And instead of bashing it and calling it rat poison, they are actually onboarding bitcoin custodial services and some other investment services to kind of profit out of bitcoin even without needing to fully understand it, because it doesn't allow for independent you cannot build independent infrastructure on top of bitcoin right now. And everybody was super hopeful about Lightning Network and how there will be lapse like lightning applications that will be decentralized on top of lightning. And I don't see that happening anytime soon. No, there is like three years later and we still don't have any meaningful use case for Lightning network.
00:56:16.622 - 00:57:07.240, Speaker D: And partially that's problem of incentives, like you cannot really make too much money running Lightning node and farming on lightning like you would do on DeFi. But I would also say that the tech still has some challenges to overcome before it's really usable for the mainstream. So Bitcoin as it is right now, the product is pretty finished. It's digital store of value, it's simple to understand. Banks can offer it as a service to their customers and I don't think it's necessarily bad, but it's definitely not what we are here for. And to see full potential of crypto and decentralized consensus, we kind of need to also look elsewhere while being able to go back to Bitcoin when we need to, when there are hard times or something like that.
00:57:08.090 - 00:57:51.010, Speaker C: And maybe one thing that I didn't say is that we do see some kind of legacy players like market makers coming into DeFi, right? So there definitely are specific players that do understand the nuance of it. There are some sort of CFI players that do get DeFi, but I still think that this might be a Pascal's wager on this side as well, coming into DeFi and trying be on top of these AMM experiments, et cetera.
00:57:54.630 - 00:58:01.510, Speaker D: So do you think that bitcoin is already mainstream? I think I saw you tweeting something about it, or maybe it was our discussion.
00:58:02.570 - 00:58:44.820, Speaker E: Yeah, I think it's actually very close to, if not already mainstream in the sense that just a few weeks ago I saw something where more people thought bitcoin could double within a year than people thought Tesla could double within a year. So think it'd be hard for you to find someone who doesn't know what Bitcoin roughly is these days? Including the latest narrative as well for bitcoin, which is as a store of value, which has a fixed supply, I think pretty much everyone knows it. And I think that for that reason bitcoin has a relatively safe positioning over the next few years just because.
00:58:47.190 - 00:58:47.518, Speaker D: It.
00:58:47.544 - 00:59:51.334, Speaker E: Has that kind of inflow of people who say, okay, like you said, Pascal's wager where they think stocks are expensive, they think the things they see in the real world are expensive. So this as a piece of digital scarcity, it seems like it's fairly priced or it seems like it's accessible to them and they need to put some percentage in. But at the same time, I recently kind of thinking a lot about the idea of the Mise's regression of money, of how monies compete and thinking about how ether it is. Really trying to go at it from a very different angle at this point, right, where you see massive amounts of ether coming out of exchanges almost every day. The amount of ETH on centralized exchanges at all time lows. And kind of at the same time the transactions being paid on ether, on the ethereum network have gone to incredible levels. The value transacted on ether has recently flipped in bitcoin.
00:59:51.334 - 01:00:51.066, Speaker E: And so I kind of hold these two truths at the same time in my head. And I often debate with the Three Arrows partners about how is this really going to play out? Because also you see in the backdrop of this kind of bitcoin mainstreamness, you see ether outperforming relatively and you see people really get excited about using blockchains and transacting on blockchains. There is some part of me that wonders, is the mises regression not over, right, where we are still regressing? What is the base money and people still because ultimately it doesn't matter what OG zone, if a billion people come in the space and they all buy a different coin, that's going to be the money, right? And there is a demand for a digital store value. So I think that it'll be power law. It will definitely not be maximalist as it has been since 2017. But I think that that bitcoin ether kind of back and forth is definitely not over. If you just see how the two approaches are evolving, I think that was.
01:00:51.088 - 01:00:57.710, Speaker B: A great way to end it. Thank you guys so much. Fisky and Matty for the discussion and sue for joining us.
