00:00:04.800 - 00:00:29.454, Speaker A: Hello everyone. So 2024 1st, let's begin with a new product. Winston, Derek, do you want to, you know, let's discuss about the node cloud, right? It's a new product offering from the restaking cloud. Right. So how do I. Let me share the screen. So it's like, yeah, okay, cool.
00:00:29.454 - 00:00:33.634, Speaker A: Can you see it? Cool.
00:00:33.674 - 00:00:34.334, Speaker B: Yep.
00:00:35.274 - 00:01:40.550, Speaker A: So we got, we're going to talk a bunch of things about a specific feature that we're introducing that will allow node runners and Ethereum validators to run the node for other networks with the protection of flashable, you know, ETH from the k two. So it's pretty straightforward, nothing very fancy, but it just like it gets like super, super interesting because you're going to talk about many combinations and permutations. Are you going to expand this kind of Ethereum validator security for, you know, as a node running infrastructure for all kind of operations? So it's going to be like very interesting. So let's, let's get started just to give you some idea about the node cloud. Nodecloud is a standalone product on a rest taking cloud in conjunction with the k two. But there's a lot of overlapping as usually it's a network of products. We have k two already in Testnet.
00:01:40.550 - 00:02:21.202, Speaker A: People are just having fun with it. I think about $600 million worth of ETH is already there as a native delegation. That's super, super awesome because these are directly delegated from the consensus layer by the three validators. And it's in Gorley when then there's an LSD route, people putting LSD there. When it comes to the main net, this will bring in a very expanded market, readily available. But now we just bring in this kind of other side of the market. Like if your invalidator sticks out there, how about that machine infrastructure to be available for others, right? And the PNod, the nod operation.
00:02:21.202 - 00:02:52.268, Speaker A: So what is a node cloud is a permissionless marketplace for ETH protected, not operations, put it simply that one, right. Any node operator, any operations is protected by ETH. So that's a very, very specific and guarantee that you're giving. So what are the actors there is pretty interesting because we have ETH protection. So you need to have delegations. That's what the k two actually brought into scene is like. You can have like program delegation, program slashing.
00:02:52.268 - 00:03:34.134, Speaker A: Now we allowing liquid delegations, right? Which means it's liquid, you, you delegate, you can have a liquid delegation to earn liquid yield. That's, that's super interesting, right? So which means you can terminate at any time. You don't really give any, any persons that your money, but they can actually use your money and then they can do a work with that one to be secured. And there's a classic, you know, the proof of stake mechanism underlying liquid proof of stake was there. And there's a lot of proof of stake actually work life that way. The user is actually backing signaling and our operations and our operators actually getting more and more, you know, active role in operations like that. So that's, that's super interesting.
00:03:34.134 - 00:04:24.688, Speaker A: Liquid delegations, assisting e three stakers will be able to earn more rewards by delegating to any kind of node operators they would love to. Now anyone who want to access this node operations is called knetworks, right? So the knetworks are any Dapps or any mainstream networks or anyone who want to have a node running operation that is protected, register there. Good to go. And you can get this kind of a really awesome guys who are, you know, who knows nitty gritty details of how to do this in a decentralized fashion, very value aligned, they're ready to go. You don't really have to go and negotiate with hundred parties. You have this kind of curated set of node operators, parties that is from all around the world readily available to you. You can just focus on your business needs, your server user better.
00:04:24.688 - 00:05:09.072, Speaker A: And we take off the rest and the node operators could be from anywhere. So those are called the PNO. They get really interesting market that coming from L1, l two blockchain kind of services or oracles or bridge or decentralized operations. Any existing centralized services who want to decentralize their part, teeny tiny bit or 5%, 10%, very specific actions, they can subscribe to that. But what is good for this is like all the packages were actually being vetted. So they're not really getting into like an unknown territory, but they can actually get a very vast market access. We're going to walk you through this like the benefits of it, because one of the key strength of the crypto is bootstrapping a decentralized infrastructure.
00:05:09.072 - 00:05:22.624, Speaker A: And we have seen this more and more, but there's an investment cost at the beginning that you enter into the market. But what we want to do here is that you're already an Ethereum validator. We want to give you more and more cash flows that make sense.
00:05:23.524 - 00:05:45.954, Speaker B: Yeah, can I actually ask a question here, Matt? Yeah. This is great for people who need to run additional services on a node. But is that required of people? Do they, the people who need to access restaking cloud and need to access restake. Do they have to set up something with a preferred node operator to even use the platform?
00:05:47.414 - 00:05:54.718, Speaker A: What do you mean? Can you, can you, can you, can you just, can you repeat that 1 second?
00:05:54.886 - 00:06:06.514, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So if a middleware or some network wants to come in and use restaking cloud, are there, is it required that they also enlist some preferred node operators?
00:06:06.634 - 00:06:47.482, Speaker A: Okay, no, no. So if you like, we already have like a lot of people actually like been testing on the rest taking cloud and a lot of people don't really need a node operations, right. They want restrict security for there, you know, to offer much more resilience and then decentralized in a reporting, self reporting and also protecting their operations, operational integrity that we call, right. If the Oracles goes about 5%, 2%, then you can actually do reporters. So that's a network level coverage, the default tolerance and things like that. You can expand your TVL, you can, in a trustless manner, anyone can verify and audit how your network is running. And you have that record.
00:06:47.482 - 00:07:26.456, Speaker A: That's a basic structure of a distributor decentralized ledger operation. So k two gives you this kind of a distributor decentralized trustless ledger of your operations. How zero operation Health is there, that's massive, because you don't really have to put up any kind of money to do that. You just like click a button, pay, you know, you can get thousand ETH and you pay like only like in a 4% or 3% and you only pay for what you use for and you get a fixed cost. That's great. But this is like some people, I also want somebody to run a software because we are actually having a node operation. So this is like, you know, so more of a decent life physical infrastructure or you know, blockchains or anything like that.
00:07:26.456 - 00:08:17.660, Speaker A: Anyone who wants a decent license, infrastructure like as a machine infrastructure that's not operations. And where do I go? Do I go to aws? Do I go to somewhere like, you know, and then I need to find, you know, find out how these packages should be and tailor it? No, no, you just go to a very, you know, professional, not operators who are providing, you know, 15, $16 billion settlement a daily basis that that's, that's the guy that you want to hire. And where do I find this guy and who are they and how do you get there? We making this things, the coordination part is much more easier curating them who are securing the Eid that comes with signaling with the ETH delegators. So e three, take a signal, these are not operators. Really great. But the liquid delegation, they also protect their operations they're putting up now in return they share their rewards. That has been getting from the kennel.
00:08:17.660 - 00:08:25.854, Speaker A: We get into that. That makes sense. And node operations are very different sector from segment from what is the full tolerance and what is the network coverage.
00:08:26.014 - 00:08:35.518, Speaker B: Yeah, that definitely makes sense. So definitely starting to really see that picture between preferred node operators and the k two pool. It's different products within the same network.
00:08:35.646 - 00:09:00.860, Speaker A: Okay. Yes. And then, and of course we have this kind of slashing gadget and the reporters and the weakness reporter. And that's one of the key components for the re seeking cloud to operate at a very, at scale, I would say that you can have oracles. Yes, without oracles. So as usual, nanoparticle protocols use any kind of oracles or any kind of anything external. It's fully on smart contracts, but off chain can actually plug in.
00:09:00.860 - 00:09:18.704, Speaker A: We have an MEV plus module. So these things actually get more and more and more fluid interaction. You don't really have to worry about integration. It won't take more than 30 minutes in any way. Right. So we make that kind of very nice experience. It's built for developers, it built for integrations, it built for usability.
00:09:19.374 - 00:09:30.574, Speaker C: So is this how crypto is going to scale, like behind the scenes? There's many different, like problems to solve within crypto. Right. Obviously ux is one problem and the other problem is, you know, kind of infrastructure.
00:09:30.614 - 00:09:30.814, Speaker A: Right.
00:09:30.854 - 00:09:47.684, Speaker C: So that's the behind the scenes, the stuff that people don't see. Right. And if we want to scale the industry in a decentralized way, then you've got to have, you got to solve some coordination problems. And that's what you said. Rest taking cloud is helping.
00:09:48.544 - 00:10:38.820, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. So it's just like, you know, movers and followers are, you know, classically same moves and shakers, but just like, you know, leaders and followers in another way. So you actually want to have this kind of a tribal leaders or like a segment leaders where they've seen something and the rest of the guys want to, want to do it. But what do you want? What do you have? Is like at the crypto you have this kind of very convoluted narrative of like, oh, we got the bitcoin, we got the ETH. Where can I go and participate within this ecosystem? And you jump into centralized exchanges and you lose money. Right. Over and over and over that you get this kind of a coordination element is the biggest vulnerable, the Achilles heel that you have this kind of decentralized network, right? Manga, FTS, you name it, it's going to come over and over.
00:10:38.820 - 00:11:46.184, Speaker A: And when, when we have this kind of proof of stakeholder, decentralized proof of stakehold. Now you have this kind of a coordination element getting more and more palpable. I would say it's like more concerned with the, who's running my machines? If you're running a machine and is that a ZK validator is really ZK or they do they know my data? How do you, how do you give this information? Who is running bot? And is that a malicious actor? Or, you know, if I'm getting that guy into it, can I kick him out? Can I, can I have this kind of a system of record of the operations and someone can actually vouch for it or do I go, what is the cost base to have that in one place? Right? So anyone who want to do a decentralized operation, the massive cost base is there, right? And they need to bootstrap with the native tokens and things like that. So we just be abstracting away that requirement. The barrier of entry should be very low for anybody want to have this kind of universal level access in a quote unquote, I'm using air quotes here. When the Internet came, it was a permissionless leverage to informations, right? And this is like 20 years ago. And that's, we have seen this web one, web two.
00:11:46.184 - 00:12:21.970, Speaker A: So many, many things have been changed. How you send a greeting cards, how you send a post letters, have you watched the tv, the cable tv, the cable networks have been transformed into streaming networks. The DVD's has been paid way for things that's been known existent. But what is the blockchain has brought into is a permissions leverage. The smart contracts, permission leverage to do this kind of re executable the files. That's a huge invention, right? And with advent of bitcoin actually brought this kind of permissions leverage over financial. So there's a lot of innovations, comes in from time to time.
00:12:21.970 - 00:12:53.518, Speaker A: One is like the bitcoin and smart contracts and the DeFi comes to it. DeFi is like huge invention. It's because innovation is like permissions leverage to do all kind of financial applications. Now the restaking brings that kind of a trust layer, the permissions leverage to launch your decentralized operations on the go. You don't really have to worry about it once you deploy it and it's there and you can just focus on other stuff. And there's no jurisdictional limitations. You can actually, you can balance it for more your geographical needs, where you get into that.
00:12:53.518 - 00:13:19.934, Speaker A: But this is like a huge opening for how you want to interact with the world. And we're talking about a world with 8 billion population, with more 60% or 70% have them in a smartphone. So you want to make sure those people can access this kind of innovation that's like in a very exponential. And it's going to get better and better. I'm going to slow down that one. Just focus on what we're talking here. So let's talk about the PNL.
00:13:19.934 - 00:13:48.494, Speaker A: The PNL reporter will actually run a lightweight software. Anyone can run it in your mobile. Hopefully we will release that, the mobile, the module, sooner or later. So you can actually be a reporter from your mobile phone itself. Run it, and you just sync it with everything. It's a very classic way of saying that you're running a concurrent action. There's a concurrent network doing independent actions.
00:13:48.494 - 00:14:25.960, Speaker A: That's what the reporters does. You have a similar things in data da layers and things like they all do this kind of getting this kind of concurrent operations, but independent actions, like in a small, teeny tiny bit of data, it will be kept. But here it is like this same setup from the distributed computing. Any reporters can actually do a report at a given point of time, 100 reports or 1000 reports, but everybody is looking after that, the single one network. So once you're part of this, you don't really have to spin up your own reporter network. So all the reporters doesn't really have to worry about how many key networks. It's all been taken care of.
00:14:25.960 - 00:14:36.160, Speaker A: You've run a small, teeny, tiny little software and they're just like ping, ping, ping, ping, ping microservice. And it just gets you ETH. That's nice, right? Run a software on ETH.
00:14:36.312 - 00:14:37.604, Speaker C: Who doesn't like ETH?
00:14:38.304 - 00:15:01.760, Speaker A: Nobody. Everybody likes ETH. All right, cool. So before we getting into the nitty gritty details, a small recap. What is k two? Right, we talked about Nord cloud, but let's refresh your minds. What is K two? K two is an on demand restaking pool with a quantifiable cost, and it comes with a programmable slashing or any kind of decentralized operations. It is quantified.
00:15:01.760 - 00:15:28.062, Speaker A: Every single bit of its operations are auditable and verifiable. There is no nothing at stake. There is no double stake. So this is like a modular restaking, staking pool designed for redistributing the e security n number of operations at n number of layers. So we have slashing security now. But remember, the cloud is a separate protocol, so. But then we're going to get into the details, the payouts and things like that.
00:15:28.062 - 00:16:00.354, Speaker A: It's super fascinating because K two has multiple partitions, like in a school we call partition, like multiple markets. The first is a slashing. Now the payout and other kind of things are going to come in SBP applications, but at the core it has an SVP, which is a stake borrower position. How much e that has been given to you at a given point of time at fixed cost, and then who is actually given to you? That's a caterous, that's the ETH validators in LSD tokens. So everything is ETH now. That's K two. K two is the core engine for.
00:16:00.354 - 00:16:22.262, Speaker A: How do you get this kind of e three stick security on different, different layers, really Mozilla program away so you don't really have to worry about it. You know, go around and spending like 10,000 and token launch and things like that just to get a restaking. Come to the protocol, do whatever you want to do. You don't really have to bug about anything else. It's launching, guys. Just do it. Right.
00:16:22.262 - 00:16:39.170, Speaker A: Cool. So we're there at least. Been better. Now it's about, you know, more ether has been staked. It's a little bit, I think 72 billion is a number that's taken before. It's about close to about 100 billion. But this is ready right now if you want to do it.
00:16:39.170 - 00:17:06.774, Speaker A: As we said, native delegation, as we bought like 600 million is existing validator, any validator, any validator from the genesis of Ethereum proof of stake is allowed to upgrade for the restaking functionality. All it takes ten minutes and the module is there, people are doing it. Nothing stops you. No one can prohibit you to opting. It's a permissionless system. So all the ETH stakers, you're welcome.
00:17:08.034 - 00:17:13.138, Speaker C: Other stakers, right? Any protocol like, is there any restriction protocols?
00:17:13.226 - 00:17:13.618, Speaker A: Anyone?
00:17:13.666 - 00:17:13.970, Speaker C: Anyone?
00:17:14.002 - 00:17:32.205, Speaker A: So it's purely program. If you're running a DVT cluster, if you're liquid staking protocol, you want to make that decision of the Dow, that how the yields are displayed. That's good. Solo stakers, you're the best. You are welcome from the day one. You can just do it, don't worry about it. Now with the PNO, you can offer your servers for other people too.
00:17:32.205 - 00:18:18.930, Speaker A: So that's like additional cash flows, everything what we do, always solo sticker first, right? If you can serve the solo staker, you can serve everyone else down the stream, right? That's, that's how we operate it. Right. So, and plus the rest taking. So any kind of, any validators, you know, let it be your lido pool validator, your eigen layer, native speed stickers or you are like in rocket pool guys and you know, you are a solo sticker, you are any new LRt lsds rock. Right? So this is like a very positive market growth, right? Okay, so before getting to the structure poster of the piano, PNL, WTF, right? What is a PNO? Preferred, not operators. That's a jargon. That's the only thing that we're going to use it.
00:18:18.930 - 00:18:39.872, Speaker A: Preferred, not operators is like preferences for ETH. So if you're an 8th validator, that's your preference. Right. Preferred, not operators. Anyone who want to have an ETH protection, validators. And for the not operations, these are the, these are the guys who want to hire it and it will be available, readily available from the p and l not club. And they have slashable security from new delegation.
00:18:39.872 - 00:19:07.268, Speaker A: So if they don't do anything that you pre, you know, from a predefined parameters that you, when you hire them, XYZ, if you don't live up to your promise, I'm going to slash you. The coverage is provided by the k two, so that additional ETH coverage. So if you're a validator, if you're a pno, you get an ETH coverage. Very nice way to think about it. You have a travel insurance when you go on flight, if your baggage has been lost, get someone to Spain. Right. It's a very, very, very nai.
00:19:07.268 - 00:19:43.370, Speaker A: But it's like, you know, similarly the ETH, the node operations has been guaranteed or protected by ETH. So, you know, you can have absolute peace of mind if you're doing any kind of decentralized operation, go for the piano's, because they're the best of the best. And also, you know, if they don't live up to their expected operations, they get kicked out. But they also get like, you know, you will get e for the amount of time and the pain that you took it. So it's a really value of my network. All right, so cool. Do you want to, Winston, do you want to go on it, Sherrik, talk about it?
00:19:43.402 - 00:20:22.226, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's go into the, let's go into the more integrated details for sure. So obviously you've touched upon the preferred operators, but let's go into that more thoroughly. So node cloud just says, right, you need to have some kind of, you need to have some kind of proof that you already doing node operations on ethereum. So that's one active ethereum validator. How do you know, how do you represent that on chain? Well, that's the native delegation feature that Matt was talking about, so that takes care of that. But you just need to be running on active analytics.
00:20:22.226 - 00:20:39.198, Speaker C: If you're not running one, you're not eligible for piano in the first instance. There is full control over. Let me just write, let me share. That screen seems to have gone off. Okay. Right.
00:20:39.286 - 00:20:39.994, Speaker A: Let's.
00:20:42.054 - 00:20:42.814, Speaker C: Check that.
00:20:42.894 - 00:20:46.914, Speaker A: No problem. Right, okay, right, cool.
00:20:48.294 - 00:20:49.606, Speaker C: You can see that. Okay.
00:20:49.790 - 00:20:51.526, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, right.
00:20:51.590 - 00:21:18.774, Speaker C: Yeah. So this, that's where we were. So the one ethereum validator, we took that off. Now as a piano, you, you have full agency over being able to decide what services, what restacking applications, what restacking networks, etcetera. That inside of the restaking cloud that you're going to run, run services for. So that's fully there, unless the.
00:21:19.674 - 00:21:34.670, Speaker A: Can I ask a question there? So this is a really interesting point. So let's put something into perspective, right? So tell me a node runner name. He talked to all of these guys all the day, so we just want to give, get a name. Yeah.
00:21:34.702 - 00:21:37.434, Speaker B: Like, like Infinite Stones. Stakeley. Staken.
00:21:37.854 - 00:22:07.516, Speaker A: Yeah, Stakeley Infinite Stones. And say, you know, all these guys like cool guys, right? So if they want, if they, if they really like them and they have this kind of profile and just go back, they can make the informed decision. Who do they want to opt in for, which network. So the networks are already available. Like, you know, they, they signal, it's like a job board and say that, tick, tick, tick. I want to start the node operations for ABC networks. And these are the networks.
00:22:07.516 - 00:22:29.814, Speaker A: Some profile of that networks, what it does, things will be, I'm assuming this information will be available on a website or an ocean or somewhere, and they will just make that informed decision. And they also decide like what kind of operations they know what they need to do because they are the one who's running the machines. They're good at this one they're doing for long term. And they're making this kind of informative. Is that what you're saying?
00:22:30.434 - 00:22:57.158, Speaker C: Yeah, it's, I mean, it's not like, it's not too. Yeah, you can, if you, as node operator, you're very familiar with the, you know, opting into certain relayers for PBS, you know, so you have the GitHub, you go to the GitHub repos and you'll see all the, all the available options there and you know, you can, it's very easy to do something like that where services can kind of like, you know, place themselves on there, but.
00:22:57.326 - 00:23:07.374, Speaker A: It'S kind of like a democracy. You're basically giving a delegation to the leader that you trust as a nod operator that they trust and they're running that operations for you. Right. And that's the casting.
00:23:07.454 - 00:23:13.494, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. You know, not to, you know, not too different from who you're going to vote for.
00:23:13.534 - 00:23:13.758, Speaker B: Right.
00:23:13.806 - 00:23:39.274, Speaker C: In an election. Right. You kind of like have the best feeling and you can change that vote later. You know, you have, you have the option to switch. Right. So, but you know how the actual means by which you do that will be via MeV plus. So MV will be the software already on all the professional node operators they're all going to have already configured on the machine and they can just add the node cloud module onto the machine and.
00:23:39.274 - 00:23:57.176, Speaker C: Yeah, simply via mobile application or it could be whatever you just say, you just tick, dap node's got this nice UI, you just tick, tick tick and then you're part of those networks and you can automatically download the software and run it for those networks in line with their rules. Yeah.
00:23:57.280 - 00:24:18.768, Speaker A: So, but if I'm opting into one of these not operators like, you know, we're getting into the delegations in a moment, but just like the node operators also can do this kind of in a reverse order, the visibility of what are the operations, it's not going to happen like in every day by day basis can, like they will opt into once in a month like the new, new networks that we are onboarding this month.
00:24:18.816 - 00:24:35.816, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, it's not going to be, yeah, I think it is comparable to how often, you know, operator might configure their MeV relay like very infrequently. You know, most of the time you're just opting in, but you're not doing it very like frequently.
00:24:35.880 - 00:24:37.216, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah.
00:24:37.240 - 00:24:41.404, Speaker C: So it's not going to be like, I think the point is that it's not a big burden on the node operator.
00:24:42.024 - 00:24:44.960, Speaker A: Super, super easy. Okay, cool. Go ahead.
00:24:44.992 - 00:25:28.254, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. And they, they don't, yeah, they don't have to worry about what they just need to focus on is running the software and keeping the liquid delegates happy that the liquid delegations, they don't have to actively like, you know, on a, from like a management perspective, they're not like doing stuff on behalf of the liquid delegators, but liquid delegators come to them and the PNO sits in between. They sit in between the K network and the. And the liquid delegates. That's where the piano sits. So we can go on to that now. So that's basically a restaker inside the restaking cloud.
00:25:28.254 - 00:25:40.234, Speaker C: So they basically signal the pnos that they want to be aligned with. Of course there are awards in exchange for doing that.
00:25:40.614 - 00:25:42.474, Speaker A: Why is it called liquid delegations?
00:25:43.684 - 00:25:53.436, Speaker C: Yes, it's along the same lines of thinking of like liquid voting. And you can move it easily. This is the key points.
00:25:53.620 - 00:26:33.014, Speaker A: Remember, when I restake my ETH, so I natively delegate. I delegate all my ethereum validators. Right. I can have like one or hundred validator balances at a given point of time in the k two registry. Or maybe I have also put some LST tokens, like St re de rename it all the other kind of LST tokens also put aside in a restrict. So at a given point of time, different sources. Yeah, I just, like, if I have 10,000 ETH in k two restate, I can just say that I'm only going to test this out with 100 e, but I want to test out fine order operators 20 2020 and.
00:26:34.734 - 00:27:13.944, Speaker C: Yeah, well, yeah, so you have many different sources that can be used to restake and you get a unified liquid delegation balance. So, you know, if you, let's say, natively delegated to ethereum validators, then you're going to get 48 liquid delegation balance. Right. A unified balance that you can. Then you can distribute that out how you wish. So it could be all 48 on one Pno that you really want to back. And, you know, there are, you know, I really, I think it's good to emphasize something that you mentioned about, you know, you can create really valued aligned networks.
00:27:13.944 - 00:28:00.384, Speaker C: So a liquid delegator, let's say. Let's say you guys are the two, you know, pnos that I'm choosing to. I'm a liquid delegate. And Matt and Derek, you're a Pno. I'm trying to decide, okay, how do I. Who do I liquidly delegate to so I can decide what my, what my preferences are? And perhaps I say, okay, well, Derek is based in Africa, so I want to. For the geographical decentralization of a network, I'm going to delegate to Derek because I don't want another AWS node in Frankfurt configured so I can make that kind of informed decision.
00:28:01.074 - 00:29:10.794, Speaker A: This is a very important point that you're basically saying even if the decentralized redistributed network should have some sort of a Nakamoto coefficient like in a very high. So this is the biggest problem now is in Ethereum, like most of the node running services like, you know, located in Virginia or in somewhere in France, you know, in Germany. But now you're saying that if the node operators are, if you have some sort of vision, so that I want to provide my delegations to the services that is providing Africa or LATAM or in elsewhere like, you know, geolocations, you can make that informed decision because the delegations are fungible, right? It's just like not fungible in the sense that, you know, and an aggregate is fungible, but just like each delegations can be like teeny tiny or like any arbitrary amount, right? You're not going in all in Optim, you basically, you have this kind of optimal distribution, right? And you can just rebalance it from time to time if that's the service that you want to do it and you have your voice as registered through that action. It's just like how you make.
00:29:12.534 - 00:30:09.066, Speaker C: I do want to, I do want to say something about the Frankfurt point, like you can't really blame people, right? Because at the end of the day it's easy, right? You had a click of a button you can spin up, you can spin up a whole ethereum node, right? And so restaking cloud is saying, okay, well if you want to decentralize fast, there are node runners ready in all kinds of locations all over the world. So you just basically liquidity delegate to those. So you have that same level of convenience and speed, right, by this mechanism. So that's how we can decentralize. If we make and give people easier tools to use, then they will go for the easier option, right? We can't say that people who like, are only using crank or like some other kind of location in the United States, that they're bad people, right? They, you know, people have different goals. People have like only certain amount of.
00:30:09.090 - 00:30:42.544, Speaker A: Time it is required. Like sometimes it is required for relays and things. Like you just really need to be closer to the trading centers if you want to do it, right? So if you want to have like, if you're running an intent based infrastructure that you want to have some of these kind of relays are very close to work. Lots of actions are happening. So you just want to have like, you know, integrated builder or things like we're seeing all kind of infrastructure modularity here and how this transaction should be flow and where it need to go. And yeah, of course the centralizing vector is saying, don't let me speak up on that. I'm just going to slow down at that point.
00:30:42.544 - 00:30:47.228, Speaker A: But that's a different subject for P O N. So I'm not talking about that one here.
00:30:47.396 - 00:30:52.436, Speaker C: So with these liquid delegates, we'll get a reward for doing this. Right? Yeah.
00:30:52.500 - 00:31:29.858, Speaker A: Account abstractions. Account abstractions. Right. So if you want to have a bundler and you, if you want to serve certain kind of jurisdiction, you just basically, if you want to have more and more granular policies, and we are not going to be living Mars, we going to be hearing everybody lives in some sort of jurisdiction. So you still want some degree of decentralization. So you can have this kind of trust, be very fluid and can give this kind of services, and then your earnings will also reflect that. Your earnings, now you're making your bets or your values are aligned and it's clearly an alignment stack in that sense.
00:31:29.858 - 00:32:12.464, Speaker A: Like, you know, you can, if you want to get this kind of a permissionless finance, permissionless distributed network to be available for everyone, you can pay it forward. And this is the way that you can do it. A lot of those people who are ready to provide that infrastructure with your security so more services can expand to those markets with your delegations, you're not losing anything, you're just earning a piece of that. But they are readily available boots on the ground. You know, we have seen, you know, guys like Dacnode has taken a lot of effort to get to someone in Kenya and to spin up an Ethereum validator. And this is the, this is the core of Ethereum in a community. We want to be inclusive from the day one.
00:32:12.464 - 00:32:19.056, Speaker A: We want to help them, but on the contrary, ETH is a very high, valuable asset. Yeah.
00:32:19.120 - 00:32:33.204, Speaker C: How, I think the, how part has been the difficult part all along because I think we can all, like, we can all agree, like client diversity is really important. We can all agree, like geographical decentralization is really important, but how do you get there? That's the question.
00:32:33.504 - 00:32:50.680, Speaker A: Yeah. You need to have super programmable, you know, very fluid layer of coordinations that can move around. And because things will change very fast and very, very, very modular. Okay. I'm not going to stop you just go into other buckets.
00:32:50.792 - 00:33:07.968, Speaker C: Yeah. No, no, no. The only thing that. No, that's helpful. And I think obviously there's a cut for liquid delegates, right? So K networks, which we'll get into in a second, will reward for the. These are node runners for hire.
00:33:08.016 - 00:33:08.224, Speaker A: Right.
00:33:08.264 - 00:34:30.181, Speaker C: So there is of course like a cost involved with it and they will pay the rewards. Right. Pnos get a, the payouts and the slashing, that's actually one of the last things there. So, you know, you can see the 80 20 split over there. But let's go into the K networks, right? So essentially, like I say, they want pnos to run the software. This is an additional service that they want, right? So as we said at the start, some applications will only require restaked ETH for their purposes, and some will require restaked ETH and pnos backed by, you know, so the K networks, they're pretty straightforward from an on chain perspective, design space is very open on an off chain perspective, you know, on chain, we're just, we're just maintaining a registry of active pianos inside of a, inside of a K network, which means that if you're not part of, if as a PNO, if you're not part of a K network, you're not going to get slashed for anything you didn't do. But when you opt in to a K network, there are certain slashing rules that you'll be able to be aware of ahead of time of opting in, and you need to run the software in compliance with their system.
00:34:30.181 - 00:35:15.864, Speaker C: So any kind of PNO violations will allow knetwork to ETH earnings. PNO is very incentivized to, to run a good system and a good operation that there are good node operators out there that have been mentioned that will be able to do it, no problem. So of course, any good decentralized network has some level of fault tolerance. So there is always buffer. It's like nodes go offline. That happens, but there are certain red lines that cannot be crossed. K networks have the ability also for whatever reason, it may be that it might be regulatory, it might be some other reasons that require some kind of like real world agreements.
00:35:15.864 - 00:35:31.516, Speaker C: K networks can gate the pianos that are part of the network. So they can say, right, look, we're not going to be an open one where anyone can come in and run the software for us. They can simply say, I have a list of guys that I know we will select.
00:35:31.700 - 00:36:12.994, Speaker A: Wait a minute. So, you know, with this kind of a pop up cities like Zalu and this kind of network state theory that we have, can I ensure, like, can I have an application that is actually protecting in a real world asset like buildings like lease and things like getting paid out, and you have someone to report that the machine sitting there, like, you know, reporting that how many, you know, you want an IoT devices to starlink or something like that, and you want it spend it, but you funded that operations. And you just want to get the network to be monitored. It's possible because you basically run that machine. Then just like you know, if it goes down the reporters will report it or the lease agreements has to be done and someone just stab it and they just make you the CK certificate. What kind of things?
00:36:13.494 - 00:36:28.926, Speaker C: Yeah absolutely. It doesn't have to be. Yeah, yeah absolutely. You know we can, we can go well beyond kind of like the existing blockchain realm that you know, because we kind of like as an industry sometimes, you know, sort of like, you know, run a little bit of an echo.
00:36:28.950 - 00:36:54.016, Speaker A: Chamber, sometimes restrict operations like you bringing like an additional, you know, trustless actors coming into it and they can coordinate with the help of the smart contract logic you have capital deployed but you just want to have continuous monitoring on that one, continuous reporting on that one. That's how the business operates. And if you're not there you just hire machines or something that you can give the reporting and based on that one you just slash the balance or something like that. Ooh, that's, that's super cool.
00:36:54.190 - 00:37:04.504, Speaker C: Yeah, you're scaling, you're scaling infrastructure, you're scaling access to information and value. Yeah, that's a nice way to put it actually really nicely.
00:37:06.724 - 00:38:07.794, Speaker B: Yeah, I was just thinking, Vince, it sounds like between what you were saying and what Matt was saying earlier that what this piano does is it really opens up optionality for people who need services run and there really is just an incredible amount of optionality. Some need pianos, some don't. The ones who do need pianos, they can gatekeep it however they need to if it's jurisdictionally, if they want to get a certain type of decentralization or if they want people who specialize in certain services. It just kind of lets people coordinate however they think is best for their network and then be able to operate and have them operate. I know that restaking cloud and k two and this node, cloud in particular will make sure that everything operates as intended once people have chosen those rails that they want to operate within.
00:38:10.294 - 00:38:46.116, Speaker C: Yeah, I think so. I think that's a nice way to summarize it for sure. Obviously we have some kind of tolerances built into this and pianos that consistently misbehave, they'll just get ejected. So it kind of has this self healing mechanism. And yeah, we have some really interesting scaling of infrastructure, machines, humans and it's really interesting. But you have to be an active k network. So that means taking out slashable e in order to be able to slash pianos.
00:38:46.116 - 00:39:43.252, Speaker C: So that's important to note. So this is a nice good diagram, sort of reemphasizing the reward distribution. So pnos will, as we said, they've got full agency to opt into the networks that they want to be part of. There is always a subset working for a network, and they have attached to them liquid delegates. So a given PNo will be identified by an ETH address. That ETH address will have a liquid delegation balance from. You can either do a self liquid delegation, or it is from other users, and that the more users that are there, the more slashable ETH is there in the event that the PNO is not performing well.
00:39:43.252 - 00:40:38.766, Speaker C: So it is important as a liquid delegator that you keep an eye on, you can passively keep an eye on things and make sure the PNO does what they said they promised to do. Pnos need to make sure that they run software well, and k networks are protected, because anyone that's bad will just get simply ejected. So we talk about value flow here, then. What is the overall value flow? We've mentioned the pnos, we've briefly touched upon the reporters, and then we have the k networks, kind of everybody's responsibilities here. So k networks are going to be paying rewards for Pno services. Liquid delegates are getting a cut here. Anything that is, anything that deviates from expected behavior from the p and o, they, they will result in e flashing.
00:40:38.790 - 00:41:26.456, Speaker A: That gets paid in the value flow. You have this kind of a stakeholders, right? So the k network, who actually wants a preferred not operator service, and the preferred not operators, I think even, you know, as I call PnO, is a preferred not operators. There could be a set, a ledger, a knet work, as we said before, could be like 100 or one or ten or thousand, arbitrary number. And every PNO has a unique ledger of the delegations, right? So that's the mapping. So if you take the high level, the k networks are hiring a node runner, but the node runner is also protected with delegations. So that's the protection, actually gives the slashing capability. So that's the.
00:41:26.456 - 00:41:58.798, Speaker A: And if you look at this right and left of the PNL has this kind of protection, they share the rewards, but it gives you the, the eat slashing that is giving a reassurance for the K network. I'm just trying to give a value flow. Correct. Right. There are fours in circles or whatever you want to call, but then just like, what are those? The one is the revenue, one is the protection. But there are two key actors here, K network and the piano. Right.
00:41:58.798 - 00:42:01.034, Speaker A: And the other two are value flows.
00:42:01.814 - 00:42:11.374, Speaker C: Right, right, right. Yeah, that makes sense, actually. It's either. And it's all. Yes. It's either ETH or it's. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:42:11.454 - 00:42:38.434, Speaker A: K network is getting something in return. The protection that's come from that is an. Ethan and the pnos are going to provide services for the K networks. They may get the rewards from ERC 20 or ETH, but it is also shared between two parties. But K network is a continuous monitoring and protection of the. From the PNO. You know, if the PNO is not up to the mark of the operations, that is also shared between two parties.
00:42:38.434 - 00:42:55.034, Speaker A: Right. Reporters and the K net. We can just go one by one, but I just want to make sure the. This bucket and this bucket is a value flow of that. The PNO and the knitworks are the. The actor in the value flow stakeholder. These are the two actors at any given point of time, interacting.
00:42:55.114 - 00:43:22.052, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. And the continuous monitoring is from the Zk reporters. Yeah, yes, yes. Right. That's just keeping everything in check on behalf of the K network. And like you said, the value flow is either, you know, the ETH into the K network if there's a slashing of it, or the rewards into the PNO. And the PNO redelegations, they're just getting a cut of that.
00:43:22.052 - 00:43:22.692, Speaker C: They're getting the.
00:43:22.748 - 00:43:37.724, Speaker A: So the rewards is a smart contract. Right. Can you explain a little bit about the k networks? How the knitwers actually pay the fund splitter? Is that for each and every PMO at a k network level, or how this is actually going to get split? Can you give a little bit details about the technical stuff here?
00:43:37.884 - 00:43:38.268, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:43:38.316 - 00:43:41.024, Speaker A: So, not too much, because it's going to be complicated.
00:43:42.524 - 00:44:22.114, Speaker C: Yeah. But as we mentioned before with the k network, k networks will have a ledger of active pianos. So that's, again, at a smart contract level from the node cloud registries, correct? Yeah. Fully automated for them. In most cases, with open knotwork, the PNOs are going to be opting in via MeV to the k network. So the contract will keep the mapping of pnos, pnos, like I said before. So the pnos have the separation between.
00:44:22.114 - 00:44:41.462, Speaker C: The PNOS have the liquid delegation. Separation. So liquid delegators delegate to a PNO, but a liquid delegator never goes and delegates directly to a k network. They delegate to a PNO. And that P and O can work for n number of k networks, and.
00:44:41.598 - 00:44:46.834, Speaker A: That'S a unified balance across the board. All the keynote that happened. So it's a collective security.
00:44:47.654 - 00:44:48.334, Speaker C: Right, right.
00:44:48.374 - 00:44:48.910, Speaker A: It's collected.
00:44:48.942 - 00:45:06.030, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, exactly, exactly. They're just running additional software. And if they are, you know, if they misbehave, they'll get kicked from all of the K networks. Right. So there is no issue with them running and doing more than one operation at a time, but, yeah, that's a good point.
00:45:06.062 - 00:45:15.644, Speaker A: It's really opened the market, like, unbounded opportunity for the PNO to opt in. But they. The more delegation they receive, the better they become in this kind of reputation ladder.
00:45:16.264 - 00:45:24.524, Speaker C: Yeah, that's true. Yeah, that's true. Because each K network that PNR works for, liquid delegates, are getting a cut of that, of those rewards. Right.
00:45:26.384 - 00:45:33.624, Speaker A: The more you go up, like, the more you get better. Yeah, that's how it is. True capitalism. Yeah, yeah.
00:45:33.664 - 00:45:36.080, Speaker C: Which is. Yeah, yeah. And that's not a bad thing.
00:45:36.112 - 00:45:43.954, Speaker A: So that's a really american way of doing it, man. No matter who you are, you can come up to the top.
00:45:44.734 - 00:46:32.974, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, exactly. Argentina is going that way as well. So with the rewards now. So basically it's like you think of like you want to spin up a K network, you get a kit, right? You know, the node cloud is giving you a toolkit. And in that toolkit, like you're saying, the active pnos in your networks that's already tracked for you. And because you have all that information, plus all the liquid delegators, you can deploy your own fund splitter, and that will process the information. You just, from time to time, as a K network, will pay out the pay to the funds, Twitter, and that will take care of who's in your network, how many liquid delegates there are.
00:46:32.974 - 00:46:56.350, Speaker C: You don't have to worry about that. As a K network, you're just injecting the rewards that you agree, and you can coordinate all of that kind of thing. Snapshot votes. You can coordinate that how you want. Outside of the contracts, there is not a lot of contract complexity here, but it makes coordination really easy.
00:46:56.522 - 00:47:01.074, Speaker A: Cool. Any questions direct here?
00:47:03.694 - 00:47:05.434, Speaker B: No, no questions here.
00:47:06.334 - 00:47:13.874, Speaker A: Okay. Right, so there are two segments here.
00:47:14.454 - 00:47:16.114, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah.
00:47:16.734 - 00:47:46.834, Speaker A: So there's on your, on your screen, on your. On your left side is a piano, on the right side, and the right hand side is a k two. So this is two different, completely isolated environment working in tandem. But we have to take the PNO as the node cloud. Right. How the K networks hide a PNL with the slashing coverage, but just giving the k two as an abstract view of how the k two actually works another way, k two has its own operations.
00:47:47.494 - 00:47:52.580, Speaker B: So this is restaking clouds. First two protocols here.
00:47:52.692 - 00:47:53.052, Speaker C: Yes.
00:47:53.108 - 00:47:56.300, Speaker B: And how they, how they flow and work in tandem. Okay.
00:47:56.452 - 00:48:17.344, Speaker A: Yeah. So you can have your own, your own protocols and restaking cloud. That's the whole point. Like you know, k two bring this kind of a unified restaking. Now the PNL is docking in the node service. If you want to build your own protocols, come and talk to us. I mean once it is completely permissions, the dower, things like that, you can just actually like start docking in, you know, like a starship cloud.
00:48:20.124 - 00:48:32.504, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. So they're different offerings, right. And you know, it's not like mandatory to take the piano, but if you need them, that marketplace is there for the node operators.
00:48:34.764 - 00:48:57.460, Speaker A: So can we go through that screen a little bit? Maybe two minutes. Just go back to the early slide. This one, yeah, has this kind of a hierarchy, like in the k networks. The node club is connected to the node cloud and there's a PNO registry at any given point. That's the master registry of the older pnls registered in the node cloud. And there's a master registry for all the k networks in the node cloud. Right.
00:48:57.460 - 00:49:30.984, Speaker A: That's actually taking care of it. Right. That's the first degree of those things. And then you have all this kind of operations like liquid delegations, rewards, learning that we explained in the last slide. And you know, any system in the cloud 24/7 rich good is mandatory. Anyone can exit anytime, anyone can join anytime, correct. So that's something even the k two, you have this vp at CD at the top, and then it has this kind of other things, rsts and slashing logic and the usage fee on the k two level.
00:49:30.984 - 00:49:42.054, Speaker A: That's right. So you will see this kind of the master registry and you know, the determination of the fee management and things like that. Yeah, this is really nice. Cool, thank you.
00:49:44.754 - 00:50:32.500, Speaker C: So actually this, this goes a bit more into like, this gives like a bit of an overview of the open hardware distribution. That's true. So you completely as a k network, the payment, you know, the fund splitter will just take care of like however many node operators you have, how many redelegation shares they have, you have some inflows and you have some outflows. So you're not worried about that. On the other side, you have the slashing, which is tracking for a given PNO. You're tracking what is the aggregate slashing received by the PNO. And obviously if that exceeds 60% of the earnings, that node operator can get kicked.
00:50:32.500 - 00:51:02.518, Speaker C: So it's important to run a good service. It's important to run a good service. There's a financial incentive for doing so. That's pretty straightforward, really. So this goes into what you were saying, Matt, about building applications. There are these layers and you can build your own applications on top of that. So you have pianos with slashable courage and then the applications are middleware on top of that, right.
00:51:02.518 - 00:51:17.462, Speaker C: So there is a, you know, a nice composition of, you know, rules and middleware that you can inject on off chain that help you to manage the registries on chain.
00:51:17.638 - 00:51:45.734, Speaker A: So it says that everything stems from the Ethereum validators. And then you have this kind of, you know, this is just the value abstraction layers, right? How you serving the users, the Ethereum validators, the base and the PNO is derived from that. Ethereum being in Ethereum validator, if you're not serving Ethereum, you're not allowed here, period. So it's some sort of an exclusivity for Ethereum validators. Like in order to register for PNL, you need to have an active run.
00:51:48.044 - 00:51:50.704, Speaker C: You know, why can't you have bitcoin? Right?
00:51:51.404 - 00:52:03.104, Speaker A: I mean, security from perspective. Yeah, yeah. From a security perspective, if you want to lock in bitcoin, then you need to lock in bitcoin. We don't really have a registry for that now, but there's nothing stopping that. You want to add a bitcoin market.
00:52:04.284 - 00:52:05.148, Speaker C: Right? Right.
00:52:05.236 - 00:52:05.876, Speaker A: Do you want to do it?
00:52:05.900 - 00:52:12.132, Speaker C: But it's like, you know, outside of that, the second biggest, you know, you just have to look at the dollar value.
00:52:12.188 - 00:52:12.356, Speaker B: Right?
00:52:12.380 - 00:52:13.188, Speaker C: So that the.
00:52:13.236 - 00:52:14.148, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:52:14.196 - 00:52:15.784, Speaker C: The amount of ETH protecting.
00:52:16.524 - 00:52:16.860, Speaker A: Right.
00:52:16.892 - 00:52:19.516, Speaker C: If it's good enough for Ethereum, it's.
00:52:19.540 - 00:52:49.306, Speaker A: Good enough for everyone. It's 4.2 trillion. It's a 4.3 trillion, like, you know, in the early basis, but then you have this kind of, all these operations, it literally opened the floodgates of like, you can just run as many things. I'd love to get some thoughts from the piano hub that, Derek, that you have, like, you know, if you register for the PNO, is that, how do you want to, like, envision you're talking too many people that are doing it? Like, can you have like a dao as a registry, as a piano? And then you can have like, you know, a sub registry of a p. And I have that.
00:52:49.306 - 00:52:53.906, Speaker A: You had this kind of wishing, maybe you would love to hear about that one too. This is your turn.
00:52:53.970 - 00:53:39.788, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. Well, I think that, again, what's pretty interesting about the p and O and how it can be broken up is that people can start to create these buckets. And essentially what it is is people who want to work together. It's almost like the idea of a mesh smoothing pool, but for preferred node operators. And this can be broken down into, say, somebody has a liquid staking network and they want all of their node operators to work under the same piano logic that they want them to do. And by doing that, they can kind of can keep a little bit of control over the rewards. This can be watched over by the DAO, what applications they're actually willing to run.
00:53:39.788 - 00:54:53.064, Speaker B: But this can get a lot more granular as well, where maybe there's just groups of five or ten people who want to be able to run some additional, get these additional rewards and do it together and kind of get this sort of smoothening effect of rewards. And it's something that we see, you know, consistently across ETH staking, and it's something that we plan on adopting here, where people are already finding different ways to break it down between the smoothening pool and between like DVT, things like that. So thanks for, thanks for bringing us here, Vince. I kind of want to take a step back when we're looking towards earnings. And if we're talking about ETH restaking, I think it's really strong to also talk about it in the lens of ETH staking and kind of draw a few comparisons, because this will make things a little bit easier for people to understand when we're kind of transitioning between restaking and staking. And the first thing that people get access to, and we've seen this pre merge was this passive and consistent yield. And this was brought in through staking rewards from ETH staking.
00:54:53.064 - 00:56:03.720, Speaker B: And now that we get into restaking, this is what is through native delegation. Just by signing up for native delegation, you're getting paid ETH just by people who need access to the network but do not actually need any additional services ran. So you can get this consistent flow of ETH just by signing up now, where things start to get interesting and the yield can really start to compound and gets a lot more exponential, is once we get into, what is this active yield? And this is similar to what we've seen with meV, where people are actively pursuing strategies, some pay more than others and they're able to continually get more and more. And that's the same kind of idea here where preferred node operators can opt in and out of different strategies to get additional rewards. Now these rewards in K two, they can be additional ETH, if that's what's being offered by a service or on, by a network, or it could going be ERC 20 token. It could also be a combination of the two. But this is more active yield.
00:56:03.720 - 00:56:54.916, Speaker B: They have to be running additional services. It's more than just being online and being there and more than just natively delegating. And similar to ETH staking, it's more than just e staking. This is something that's actively being run. Now if we take this a step further and we take a look and say some people are going to not want to have to worry about even staking the validator or natively delegating, some people aren't going to want to have to worry about this active yield in particular, and they just want somebody else to do these operations for them. They don't want to have to make any decisions, they just want to sit back and collect rewards. And that actually opens up a lot more opportunities for the node operators, similar to where it was with eats taking.
00:56:54.916 - 00:57:03.428, Speaker B: We see so many liquid stakers, we see so many people choosing to have different services or institutions run the validators for them.
00:57:03.596 - 00:57:55.202, Speaker A: You're saying that, are you saying that you could have like some sort of a rest taking credits? Like, you know, you go to an azure somewhere that you get the credits and you can redeem it for using the resources in the AWS, they can use an EC two, you can easily lambda, you can use that. And this, like if you have an SVP, you can actually make that as a credit and give it to incubation, whatever it is. And then what you get it now is like you can actually go and inject the params in that SVP. So SVP is like a stake borrower position, right? So if you go to k two in the app, you come first, you get a better interest rate, right? So just like, you know, just like the utilization rate. But if also have a range bounding, you know, it will never escalate more than certain point, right? Let's say you have a 70% utilization, you will never get a 70% interest rate. That never happens. It's like very, very modular, very dynamic, it has an optimized utilization.
00:57:55.202 - 00:58:28.088, Speaker A: It also have like a leverage to change how this kind of parameters are there. So there's always a range, how much you will pay. But still in comparison, you come in early, you always get a better rate, right? And it's a fixed rate, it's not a floating rate. And just give you some tips about the floating rate is like, floating rate is extremely hard in the real estate that you will see that the floating rate even take at a peak. And then you have this kind of, the rate changes. Even if you have really a lot of people leasing out to your apartments, you will not be able to make the repayments right. The refinancing will be extremely hard.
00:58:28.088 - 00:59:02.424, Speaker A: The fixed rate is the core or the cornerstone of any kind of a very sustainable business. A floating rate is like very know, that's, that's a very speculative market. So we just want to have this kind of very sustainable growth, the fixed rate. But they can just roll on, they can top up and things like that. So let's, let's assume you open an SVP, you have a million dollars, you have a million ETH worth in SVP, you can split that SVP, you can sprinkle that with multiple projects. And this projects can actually inject their parents whatever they want to and the reporters will do it. And then you know, that's, that's, that's, that's more of like a defi market for resticking credits.
00:59:04.594 - 00:59:10.214, Speaker C: I'm thinking of all the financial services you can build on top of that. I don't want to say anything.
00:59:14.714 - 00:59:16.894, Speaker A: Cool, great.
00:59:17.354 - 00:59:34.704, Speaker B: Yeah, so yeah, that's for these management fees. Thanks for that, Matt. I think that was kind of a good color of how there can be different amounts of payouts from the K two pool to these node operators. From unlike this native delegation sort of side of thing.
00:59:35.644 - 01:00:07.994, Speaker A: A real accounting and a cost base always help you to get refinancing anything that you put it. So just helping that accounting and visibility for things, what you want to do, the p and l is always really good way. So if you are setting up a business and operations, you want to know how much you want to spend, right. That gives you a lot of grip on repricing your, the products and services for different jurisdiction, different users, different things. Pay as you go, pay as you grow. Very important.
01:00:09.454 - 01:01:25.998, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. And for these node operators that are receiving the payments, there's also these additional opportunities for them. Even outside of receiving, you know, delegations and collecting their management fees. They can actually run this reporter software and you know, it might seem a little bit like a double dip where they can run the software and, or they can run these sbps and get paid to run these networks, but at the same time they can also get paid since they have the hardware already. They can also run these lightweight clients and enforce any sort of slashing on the network. They can even enforce slashing upon themselves, but they could also enforce slashing on other people as well. But they can do both the same thing of running the validator and running the node, becoming a piano, receiving delegations and running this client, which is interesting, because if we want to take this a step further, some middleware and some k networks might already have access to eat to validators that might be a part of their business, where they could actually be the people who are running the, setting up whatever this network is.
01:01:25.998 - 01:01:39.542, Speaker B: They can be running validators for this network and being the reporters of this network, and they could be using K two to help regulate all of this as well. So there's a lot of different ways that people can build up these yield tiers.
01:01:39.718 - 01:01:40.298, Speaker A: Cool.
01:01:40.406 - 01:01:45.814, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, that makes a lot of sense. It does 100% make sense because most.
01:01:46.794 - 01:01:48.914, Speaker A: What are the yield tears? I want to see the yield tears.
01:01:48.994 - 01:01:50.894, Speaker B: Well, that's, that's the next slide. Yeah.
01:01:56.114 - 01:01:56.450, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:01:56.482 - 01:02:38.794, Speaker B: So I can, I can kind of jump into these yield tiers. Right. So this just, just to kind of preface this in the same way that we were looking at anything is possible, and people can build different opportunities within restaking cloud and med plus both the internal team who's building and external parties. This is really just the beginning. This is what it looks like. If somebody wants to become a preferred node operator and completely optimize their node, these are the yield possibilities available to them out of the box. With what we have now, and we kind of covered what this native delegation is, that's a consistent flow of ETH.
01:02:38.794 - 01:03:18.214, Speaker B: People can come in and they register. It takes about ten minutes. Sign up with MeV plus and they're able to do this native delegation. Their ETH becomes available and they can get this ETH inbound. Now they can take that step up and they can be approved as a preferred node operator. This starts off, you know, this is something where we'll be looking at getting the first few in, but after that, this can become more of a DAO operation. If a preferred node operator meets certain specifications, or if a node operator meets certain specifications, they can come in as a preferred node operator.
01:03:18.214 - 01:04:17.716, Speaker B: And again, these payouts, it depends on how these networks want to pay. Some will want to pay an ETH, some will be ERC, 20 will be these rsts, which we didn't touch much today. But that's another way to mint ETH back tokens out of these restaked positions, these stake borrower positions. Now this node delegations, that kind of goes down to this same idea again, that anybody can, once you're a preferred node operator, people can delegate their ETH to you and then you get to operate for them. This is all taken care of by the smart contracts and you just start to collect 20% of all the rewards you're making off of other people's delegations. Now I'm going to kind of lump these last two together a little bit, because this reporting, this running of this software can be broken down into two different tiers. And the payouts look a little bit different for both.
01:04:17.716 - 01:04:53.630, Speaker B: One is the k two reporting. This is for the basic stake borrower positions. This is when there is no preferred node operator involved. People just come in and they're able to just borrow and write some services and do this higher level sort of restaking security. And that gets paid out actually in ETH for them. And now what they can then do is do this preferred reporting, which enforces different logics on the preferred node operators. And these are two different things.
01:04:53.630 - 01:05:28.004, Speaker B: It's two different softwares, but they only have to download the software one time for each one of these, and then they can enforce these different networks and receive payouts for that. And similar to what I was talking about earlier and alluding to is this is really the beginning. As people start to get in and people start to build and we start to continue to build, more and more opportunities will come up for these node operators to earn additional rewards. ETH, ERc, 20s, rsts, a lot of different options.
01:05:31.744 - 01:05:56.700, Speaker A: Right. I mean, it's truly fascinating to think from, you know. Yeah, liquid delegations for liquid, either. I love it, but just like it's truly fascinating how much you can go. This is a lot of, you know. Oh yeah, that's graph. So something like how do you think like people joining a machine network like this, this graph, I love it because it just showing the file coin.
01:05:56.700 - 01:06:22.954, Speaker A: So if you can zoom in that part. This is the time that people are joined the network. You can see that's in a quote unquote in a classic startup world is custom acquisition. Like in a people joining and then people just leave them, leave the system. Right. But the infrastructure solutions are, they're very value aligned and they know what they're doing. And this, we in a crypto is very famous for bootstrapping very large networks of infrastructure.
01:06:22.954 - 01:06:48.496, Speaker A: Like, you know, you have this kind of filecoin has like, you know, a lot of EB, how much they have the storage, the next one. So this is like capacities being added on a daily, you know, on a weekly basis. Yeah, yeah, that's. Can you, can you, can you go there? Like you know, what's the, what's the number showing? The, the storage actually shows ebby bytes and things like. Oh that's a teby byte. Yeah, that's a Pebby byte. Oh my God, that's, that's huge.
01:06:48.496 - 01:07:17.788, Speaker A: Right. So that's, that's a pivot byte. That's like petabytes, whatever you want to call in the storage. Right. And you see that the capacity, this has been added on a weekly basis that the capacity is, it's, it's, it's there, it's, it's getting like you know, quite sticky. Yeah, yeah. And you have this kind of networks that offering so that a lot of people actually can provide services for you in a very, in a resilient fashion.
01:07:17.788 - 01:08:21.450, Speaker A: And if you can incentivize, these resources could be utilized for multiple applications with e security. That means you can, you know, you could use storage, you can store storage from file coin, you can even use FEMA FVum. Right? You know, filecoin, virtual machines, applications over there. Or you can, you can use any kind of, for the networks, RPC endpoints like you know, pockets or like you know, the, the new SVP protected RPC endpoints coming from the Ethereum node operators or any, anything like in a notary attestations for the compliance or any kind of availability. Right. Data availability, that's basically like, you know, much of the data availability functions is like reporter can actually provide a lot of, you know, da, kind of like, like concurrent independent actions is the ZK will do it. But the DA for l one's like, you know, you can actually integrate with Celestia or an Ethereum dank sharding or any kind of other BA layers that will actually help you to, to get the bridges and things like that.
01:08:21.450 - 01:08:46.202, Speaker A: Oracles and that. It's like the centralized operations. Like they can spin out their operations for decentralized, for dispute resolution pay to P two P. That's we already seeing, which is getting deployed. So it's massive from an SVP perspective. It's already opening a million operations. And now the P and L is really opening up this kind of a boots on ground.
01:08:46.202 - 01:09:33.324, Speaker A: That's what I say. Right. And literally like, you know, the pinging, you can have a good protocol but you know, also have like you know, this kind of a satellite and just the devices that is you know, pinging the satellites and I've seen this like you can actually talk to an ISS space with a radio signal. You can literally do that. You can make it in the international space Station and they. So, yeah, we got you. So just really like that, if you make it accessible universally and then now you're injecting crypto economics and to, for the continuity of operations and in return, liquid delegations, liquid yield, I mean there's always liquid, right? I mean it's massive.
01:09:33.324 - 01:09:44.894, Speaker A: I don't know where it goes. We're just opening up Pandora box here. Where's infrastructure on that?
01:09:45.234 - 01:10:24.230, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. That's one of my favorite things about, especially this p and o part of restaking cloud, you know, the k two part. So interesting. But then once we move into this idea of the PNL, really so many new opportunities open up and it'll be really interesting to see what people want to build. We already are hearing so many different ideas of what can be done with it. And I think that this is really just the tip of that iceberg, right? This is just the first wave. And in one, even six months or a year's time, there can be a lot of new things that can be built out of this.
01:10:24.422 - 01:11:04.928, Speaker A: SBP applications like the pouts and the services, specific services. You will have another registry for specific kind of applications like that, and AI and ML training kind of sets. Right. So we already, we're already pushing out those kind of gadgets too. So, you know, you get the SSL, you came with an online bank, and now the checkouts and everywhere, now that, that expand the business. And then it brought the eBay for the PayPal, but then now the Amazon, then you have like all kind of distribution networks or labs and you go to brick and mortar stores or you go to an online shopping in their own shopping, or you go to this kind of channel shopping. They're one of the marketplaces.
01:11:04.928 - 01:11:59.564, Speaker A: It's, it will only add more and more and more opportunities. You will get more and more, you know, services. It could be human services, it could be, it could be GPT oriented services. Like you can get these translations and you can actually have that kind of, to be restate, you get all kind of models are coming in. You can have, you know, genomics, like, you know, all this kind of things, you have you readily, you can readily available that any kind of resources from anywhere from the world, that's a permissionless leverage to think beyond what is possible without any restrictions, to dream and to bootstrap and to grow regardless who you are, where you are. And there's an access to Internet. And that Internet could also be decentralized as a mesh network.
01:12:00.954 - 01:12:32.954, Speaker B: Yeah, it gets so big and I think this is a great time to say if anybody wants to get involved. The testnet is live. We've already had about 8500 validators come in. It's a great time to join there, can start playing around with native delegation, can move into pnos, and if people want to start building, I know a lot of you have reached out already. You can continue to reach out. We're here to bounce ideas around and share different things, and there's a lot of different ways that you can get involved with free staking cloud.
01:12:33.254 - 01:13:01.878, Speaker A: Yeah. Anyone who is getting a little bit delay of like, you know, onboarding stuff like apologize, small team, a lot of inbound requests. We try to bring more people and just get boots on ground. So maybe we get a k too for growing like, you know, people in different parts of the world. That would be like, you know, speaking different languages. I expect if that kind of service can come, like, you know, it's massive. Yeah.
01:13:01.878 - 01:13:09.086, Speaker A: All right, that's a wrap. So thank you, guys. Let's get things going. All right?
01:13:09.270 - 01:13:11.230, Speaker B: Yeah, great. Thank you.
01:13:11.262 - 01:13:12.094, Speaker A: Cool, thank you.
