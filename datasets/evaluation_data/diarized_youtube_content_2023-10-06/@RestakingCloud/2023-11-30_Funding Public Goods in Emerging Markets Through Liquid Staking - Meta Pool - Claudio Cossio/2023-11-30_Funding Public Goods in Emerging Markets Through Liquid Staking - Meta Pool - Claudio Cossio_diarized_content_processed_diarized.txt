00:00:00.400 - 00:00:39.608, Speaker A: I'm here to talk about how liquid staking is helping scale impact in emerging markets. And so I believe that this is going to be the next step into how we onboard the next 1 billion users into crypto. So what is metapool with the first liquid staking solution on near and Aurora? We just recently launched on Ethereum through the partnership with SSB networks. So really happy about that. And one important aspect that we're doing is that we're distributing all protocol fees through the DAO, through Dao governance. So that's going to be, that's a first because all of that is on chain right now. It's on the New York protocol.
00:00:39.608 - 00:00:43.944, Speaker A: But we will eventually launch this on Ethereum. And why should we do this?
00:00:43.984 - 00:00:44.564, Speaker B: Right?
00:00:44.984 - 00:01:04.718, Speaker A: For us it's really important. So this is a full on latin american project. It was born and bred over in Mexico and Argentina. My co founder is from Buenos Aires, I'm from Mexico. And so we understand that there's an underlying opportunity in blockchain technology and crypto, which is how do we substitute this?
00:01:04.806 - 00:01:05.390, Speaker B: Right?
00:01:05.542 - 00:01:34.696, Speaker A: And I think I had a lot of made a smile on my face, Andres, talk from El Dorado, because this is the way that we hedge against inflation in emerging markets. There's no other way. There's, I don't know, maybe 1020, 2030 years of people hedging against inflation through having access to the dollar. Right now in Argentina, it's illegal. In Mexico it's also illegal to have a bank account in dollars. It's legal to own it. But then where do you store it?
00:01:34.720 - 00:01:35.144, Speaker B: Right.
00:01:35.264 - 00:01:43.680, Speaker A: And so we know that this is eventually will be not a good hedging tool for emerging markets. And this is where we come in.
00:01:43.712 - 00:01:44.284, Speaker B: Right.
00:01:44.984 - 00:02:24.218, Speaker A: So how does medical work? It's a non rebasing asset. So that means that if I sent you MPE, that asset is always accruing in value every second. This is very important because we're not accruing the rewards every 24 hours, 12 hours, every second, MPE is growing in value. And we do this through a great design that my co founder Lucio made, which is basically we have an internal swap pool that allows you to immediately do the fast unstaking option through that contract. Other than that, I'm not going to go too deep dive into this. Happy to have a conversation with you guys afterwards. So the great question here is, how do we onboard 1 billion folks?
00:02:24.266 - 00:02:24.810, Speaker B: Right?
00:02:24.962 - 00:02:37.634, Speaker A: For us, it's going to be emerging markets. Quick question here. How many of you has faced 100% inflation? One guy. Turkish. More so Russian. Okay. Belarus.
00:02:37.634 - 00:02:41.634, Speaker A: Yes, of course. Mexican. Right. Okay. Three years ago.
00:02:41.674 - 00:02:41.874, Speaker B: Right.
00:02:41.914 - 00:02:52.544, Speaker A: None here from Latin America for sure. Right. Turkish guys, gals? None from. Well, you think it's 120% inflation, right. And so how do we onboard those folks?
00:02:52.584 - 00:02:52.976, Speaker B: Right.
00:02:53.080 - 00:03:15.276, Speaker A: We believe liquid staking token is the right approach to this. Why? Because there's three important, four important factors around this. It's liquid. Right. You can trade it easily for crypto. Again, it allows you to support the ethereum network, which is kind of the underlying design of it. It's accessible either to decentralized exchanges or centralized exchanges or even fintech applications.
00:03:15.276 - 00:04:07.048, Speaker A: And here is the adoption part is something that we are doubling down on. Yes. It doesn't look pretty because it has to go to centralized channels like fintechs or centralized exchanges. That's why we're supporting custodial services such as fireblocks, Credo and Finoa over here in Europe, because we believe that that's the initial stepping stone for many emerging market users to come and get access to a liquid staking token. Some of our numbers, I'm not going to go through them, but we have around more so or less than 27 million TvL with ETH, Nir and Aurora as well. The most important part here is that it's very much Dao focused because our core principle here is how do we create a protocol that is run by a community and owned by the community. This is why many of us got into blockchain technology.
00:04:07.048 - 00:04:30.622, Speaker A: We didn't come here to create companies. We're trying to create the new way of creating value online. And for us, daos are a very important factor in this. So through the DAO, we're supporting more than 28 projects from Nier and Ethereum ecosystem. And more importantly, we're finding that governance on chain can be done. Right now. We've done it over on the near ecosystem side.
00:04:30.622 - 00:04:34.810, Speaker A: We want to do it on the Ethereum side. Yes, it is a challenge, but we're up for it.
00:04:34.842 - 00:04:35.082, Speaker B: Right.
00:04:35.138 - 00:05:01.582, Speaker A: And whoever has faced more than 100% inflation can morally survive any crypto winter. So impacting the region. Okay, so this is some of the things that we've done through our last voting of the Dow. We're spitting all protocol fees over on the near network, 50 50. 50% goes to people that are participating actively in the Dow. The other 50% to folks that are requesting funding from the DAO. On Ethereum, we're putting our staking where our mouth is.
00:05:01.582 - 00:05:45.474, Speaker A: All protocol fees up to a 2000 e will go directly to gitcoin grantees we're happy to discuss to other projects from emerging markets that would like to get some funding directly from this liquid staking pool. Glad to have SSB as a partner to doing this. But anyhow, so this is where we're trying to make a case for liquid staking for emerging markets. This is as easy, right? The more resources we have, the more we can distribute. So we think that this is a sustainable way for a liquid staking token to be at the core front of community growth for emerging markets. But more importantly for folks to have access to what many of us right now have done. Many of us have now gone bankless for Latin America.
00:05:45.474 - 00:06:15.438, Speaker A: This is not the case. They're bankless not by choice. They're bankless because that's the way it is. And so we believe that the liquid staking token can be this trojan horse to create an auto compounding savings account, right? Yes, it's crypto. Yes, it's the ups and downs, but we're already living off of shit coins from fiat. So anyhow, really excited to be participating with Gitcoin grants round grantees. We did Gitcoin round 18.
00:06:15.438 - 00:06:50.944, Speaker A: We distributed more than 25,000 dai to more than 14 projects all over Latin America. We're going to continue to double down on that through the dow and through the partnership with Gitcoin. We have more than 30 ambassadors all over the world. We have onboarded hundreds of stakers. So we believe that, yes, there are the high network individuals, the DJ's. Yes, you're doing your part in decentralization through staking and then leveraging, but we believe that onboarding hundreds and thousands of stakers will enable decentralization in Ethereum to really happen at the grassroots level. So we had distributed more than $100,000 for people to stake.
00:06:50.944 - 00:07:27.198, Speaker A: We want to become the first liquid staking solution running fully on chain. We don't have a forum where you can do and do your flame wars. We do want people to talk and really have a sensible proposal, put it all on chain and let the community do the talking and do the discussions there. And like I said, refi projects, education projects. We're working with the global chinese communities as well and helping them onboard common good projects from China as well. And so we're definitely here to help. We're definitely here to be at the forefront of how do you do a liquid staking through community driven initiatives.
00:07:27.198 - 00:07:49.906, Speaker A: So, lesson learned. In supporting emerging markets, you need to understand where the value creation process is. It's not the same as in western countries. People have different things, different needs. And more importantly, we have to be patient on how they learn, how you drive and deliver impact, keep the eye on the target and be also patient.
00:07:49.970 - 00:07:50.242, Speaker B: Right.
00:07:50.298 - 00:08:17.616, Speaker A: If in eight weeks something doesn't happen, most likely it's not going to happen. So just rinse and repeat. It takes an iterative process. Coming from Latin America, coming from Asia, we understand that sometimes language, barriers of language are given. The other important thing is select your projects and your partners closely, because those are going to be the ones that are going to be dry. Those are going to be the gateways into growth in emerging markets. Building those partnerships takes time.
00:08:17.616 - 00:08:38.408, Speaker A: It's not an overnight thing. It doesn't mean that you're giving money or giving resources to something that you're going to get immediately access to folks. It takes time, it takes a little bit of bonding, but anyhow. But eventually you will pull through. Sustainability is still a long, long way. I'm not stating right now that we crack it. We believe that this is a good experiment to happen in emerging markets.
00:08:38.408 - 00:09:19.574, Speaker A: And for us, this is how we're going to be onboarding the next 1 billion users. So how do we make it sustainable for us? Stable coins will play an important role in this. You need to understand that for many folks that are coming from emerging markets, the way that you start a conversation in crypto is stable coins. Right. We've seen this repeating many times, for example, in Argentina, where right now they're facing close to 300% inflation and normal people, taxi drivers are accepting stable coins. So we believe that that's going to be a Trojan horse. Decentralization will be a key part of it, but also through our partnership with SSV Network, we're offering incentives.
00:09:19.574 - 00:10:07.058, Speaker A: We know that this is not sustainable, but it will be the way how to drive people to come stake through liquid stake to a liquid staking derivative such as metapool. We have a 7% APR. We're going to try to sustain that as much as we can, but enabling decentralization as well to be at the core, stable coins backed by LSD is very experimental, but it's something we need to try. We need to rinse and repeat and find which are the areas of opportunities we're supporting tenet in this, in this sense, and so really happy about that and looking forward to it. The other big thing, how can communities also drive this growth? We partner with the global chinese community. They're going to be proactively funding through delegation. Now, last but not what are the big opportunities? And this is where Andres and I have a little bit of overlap.
00:10:07.106 - 00:10:07.650, Speaker B: Right.
00:10:07.802 - 00:10:11.914, Speaker A: We believe that, yes, stable coins are part of the equation.
00:10:11.994 - 00:10:12.354, Speaker B: Right.
00:10:12.434 - 00:10:21.746, Speaker A: Like I said, liquid staking tokens will be a simple auto compounding savings account for us. Supporting up and coming DeFi protocols from those regions is key.
00:10:21.810 - 00:10:22.202, Speaker B: Right.
00:10:22.298 - 00:10:46.492, Speaker A: They understand the market better than you. Right. And then partnering with them is going to be key part of this. And this is all, it should be all permissionless. It should be all enabled for decentralization to happen and censorship resistant to be at the core part of it. Sadly, first exposure is going to come to a centralized exchange and to fintech applications. Remember this and write it down somewhere.
00:10:46.492 - 00:11:16.328, Speaker A: You do not miss it because the largest crypto platforms in Latin America are centralized. Repeo, lemon, cash, BTSO, these are all up and coming crypto projects. Centralized, sadly. But at the core part of it, that's where people are getting exposure. Very important peer to peer transactions. They haven't gone anywhere, folks. Peer to peer transactions represent a lot of the volume in crypto in emerging markets.
00:11:16.328 - 00:11:53.882, Speaker A: Please be aware of that. We need to find a decentralized manner for any protocol to engage with them. El Dorado is a good example. But please, yes, sorry, if there's anybody here from binance, I don't want to throw you under the bus, but we need a better solution than binance for peer to peer transactions and to find liquidity. Last but not least, restaking. Is that an opportunity? Yes, it is still experimental. We do want to be aware that these are people that are putting 1020, 30, $40, and it takes them one, two or three months to make that kind of capital.
00:11:53.882 - 00:12:14.770, Speaker A: So we really want to be mindful that we're not putting those at risk. We're going to experiment, yes. But really be mindful on the next bounce of the ball regarding restaking. And thank you very much, the folks from restaking cloud, for putting up this great show. Thank you very much. Join us in allowing this onboarding for the next 1 billion users to a liquid staking token. This is our telegram, our discord.
00:12:14.770 - 00:12:19.154, Speaker A: Let's have a conversation and happy to talk about this talk. Thank you very much, everybody. Stay safe. Cheers.
