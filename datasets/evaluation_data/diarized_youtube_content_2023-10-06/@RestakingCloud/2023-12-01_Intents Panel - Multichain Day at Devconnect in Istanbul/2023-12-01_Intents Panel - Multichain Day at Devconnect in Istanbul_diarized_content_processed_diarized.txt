00:00:00.400 - 00:00:32.694, Speaker A: Okay, let's begin then. The last session is the panel. We got five top people and me here, I'm not the top one. So let's get to introduce ourselves. Myself, Matt. I'm the CEO of the blockchain labs and we work on a few things on the MeV and intents, mostly in the research side and ship the tools for solvers and builders to make things much more smoother and users to have some safer transactions. Right.
00:00:32.694 - 00:00:38.814, Speaker A: And it would be great to hear what you guys do in a very brief. And then we can get into other stuff.
00:00:39.914 - 00:00:40.290, Speaker B: Cool.
00:00:40.322 - 00:00:51.134, Speaker C: Hey everyone, my name is Murat. I'm the founder and CEO of Primev and we're building MeV commit, which is establishing a peer to peer network across all MeV actors to issue credible commitments.
00:00:54.394 - 00:01:14.534, Speaker D: Hi, I'm Simon. I'm a co founder and CTO of Essential. We're building various components of intent centric infrastructure. Those are an ethereum aligned account abstraction, intent based standard, a DSL for intent expression, and a little bit later on, an intent centric protocol.
00:01:18.254 - 00:01:40.954, Speaker B: Founder of propeller heads. And we are solvers, which means we spend much of our time building routing algorithms and implementing and interfacing with the likes of essential and all of the amms. And our job is to help all of these entities as well in their designs and in our day job, we solve orders.
00:01:42.494 - 00:02:09.794, Speaker E: Hi, I'm artem from one inch, like a few words. I guess one inch is the best aggregator here for intents. Besides aggregation, we also have the fusion, which is intent based protocol, also limit orders. And about myself, I was like a lead dapp UI developer, basically responsible for the front end. And like last few months I switched to the smart contracts and now, yeah, I'm like blockchain engineer from one inch. Thanks.
00:02:11.394 - 00:02:36.518, Speaker F: I'm Alex from Cowswap, the actual inventor of intents and the first intent based protocol in Ethereum, and one that forced the others to actually start talking about this topic. And we have a different idea of what intent is. And we basically base the aggregator, or metadex aggregator, on batch auctions, which if you don't know about, I recommend reading because they are awesome.
00:02:36.706 - 00:03:01.514, Speaker A: Right? So I'm gonna do this in a different order. We have two aggregators now, just becoming more intense people. And then we have problem solver. So for everyone properly, heads protocols gives them and you trying to make some consensus somewhere. Very hard thing to do. And he's trying to connect everyone through p two. P very hard.
00:03:01.514 - 00:03:16.254, Speaker A: Failed in the past, but let's see how it goes. But let's start with the cow swap, right? How did your invention come through? If that is an intent as an aggregator, and what is an intent now, then?
00:03:17.314 - 00:04:14.310, Speaker F: So I think nothing has changed. The idea was basically the realization that Ethereum is a very complex world, and the more the masses that we want to reach, the less of the technology they need to know. And the whole point was, if we have them sign a message, we could have these specialized parties root and create the transactions for the users so they can just simply, even though they're creating a market order, in the sense create a limit order, and from there have a more professional party add the other more complex parts of the transaction, such as what is the best grasp gas price for including the transaction in the next blog? What is the latest new mm where I'm going to get the best price, etcetera. And at the beginning it was tough because we were the only ones that were doing this. But with time it's rewarding to see that at least we made the right bet.
00:04:14.462 - 00:04:55.524, Speaker A: So we're talking about the intents are getting more than just a swap, right? We're getting like more expressibility and things like that. And we had a lot of questions from the community, like what? How to approach an intent. I have a protocol. Certain actions are there. We use some of existing solvers, but we want to go more about like, you know, more accessibility. Is there anything that we need to change? So I want to know from propeller heads, you guys do a lot of solutions always, right? Is this the intensity swap or from your part, do you see anything more complex things can be done?
00:04:56.784 - 00:04:57.656, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely.
00:04:57.720 - 00:05:00.724, Speaker A: Without much heavy lifting from the protocol developers.
00:05:02.384 - 00:05:59.106, Speaker B: So I think that there is already a lot of things being done and a lot of things are already possible that are not being used widely. So I think Kousub has so much more capability than what you see on the surface, right? You have the smart orders, you have the hooks, you have programmable orders that can take any condition so you can implement stop losses. You can limit bias so much more than what you might think you can do from the user interface. And a lot of these seemingly more complex execution models, they actually decompose in the background back into swaps. And that's the elegant things about swaps, is that many of the things that we think about in financial transactions then decompose into actually very few primitives. And the main one certainly now and for the next years will be swaps. Like if I dCa into a token, it decomposes into swaps.
00:05:59.106 - 00:06:44.764, Speaker B: If I leverage up on a yield position, on a lending position, it decomposes into lending and swaps. So swaps is not as limiting as it seems. And getting swaps, right, I think there's a lot of ground still to cover. So, for example, cowswap's feature of batching transactions is still far too little talked about. Like the benefits that you get from having a batch auction, the benefits that you get from peer to peer trading instead of going through an amm are massive. Like imagine you are a, you're holding an early investment in a token. This is a sad example, but you're trying to sell the tokens, okay? You want to liquidate, you have to pay your investors, or you want to buy a house, whatever.
00:06:44.764 - 00:07:27.226, Speaker B: So now you have a big stake in a protocol that's not extremely liquid. Now your sell of maybe 100k is going to push the price down by 5%. There's no reason necessarily why the price should change down by 5%. Because you're selling, you're not an insider, you're just liquidating. Why should that change the price, the expected price of that token? And it doesn't have to be the case. Like, if I am lucky enough that there is a counterparty who wants to buy these tokens, then we're both better off just matching peer to peer at market price. They would have paid 5% more because they would have put the price up.
00:07:27.226 - 00:07:34.334, Speaker B: I would have lost 5%, and now we're both gaining 5%. If you just trade peer to peer, that's essentially what batch auctions.
00:07:34.994 - 00:07:41.762, Speaker A: But that's social welfare within that group of people, or even you put that into the block, would that change?
00:07:41.938 - 00:07:57.582, Speaker B: No, you are putting it in the block, right? A batch auction is a subset of building blocks. You're building a partial block and that you then submitting to the block builder. But a batch auction, like a cow swap batch, is a partial block, and you can extend this model much further.
00:07:57.698 - 00:08:05.954, Speaker A: Yeah, that's what I'm asking. The social welfare is that subset, right. That's only care about if you want expanded to open space. Oh, yeah.
00:08:06.374 - 00:08:16.974, Speaker B: So this social welfare from peer to peer extends to many, many other things, right. But it is important that we get swaps right first. And we are still early on swaps.
00:08:17.134 - 00:08:26.984, Speaker A: I like that, getting the swaps right. It's the biggest problem now. So that's where we can start. Any takes, guys? Want to add anything, right?
00:08:27.924 - 00:08:55.834, Speaker D: I guess like I would add that. It's true that like the most important primitive right now is swaps. That's also kind of a reflection of the fact that like 95% of blockchain activity is like Defi or like Defi related. Like I think there are, we wish I think for a future where more things are done like blockchain is used for more things than it is being used for now. Like I think there are exciting use cases that can't be decomposed into swaps. That's what I'm trying to say.
00:08:56.654 - 00:09:11.674, Speaker A: Interesting, right. What about one inch fusion? You guys are always like the fastest one in the game and aggregator. What's the one inch fusion is bringing to the table now?
00:09:13.374 - 00:09:21.530, Speaker E: Yeah, I mean I think would I say the it's diversity of the space is always good. I just before want to add.
00:09:21.642 - 00:09:22.814, Speaker A: Yeah sure, go ahead.
00:09:23.234 - 00:10:26.590, Speaker E: It's like in my mind that yeah we actually have the same problem like with Coswap that we have a lot of tooling and features in our smart contracts with like batch auctions, transfer I don't know post interaction like these hooks and it's kind of. We need to expose this more maybe in medium articles maybe on UI as a. We don't know but yeah definitely if there is some developers like for now a lot of features just in place but need to be exposed through the I mean some explanation tutorials et cetera. Yeah just regarding the fusion we have slightly different model of let's say how solvers are organized, how we send traffic to the resolvers. So am I correct if I say that. Let's say you have more centralized things that like everything central data to the COSOP then you decide who is doing right here or do you want the.
00:10:26.742 - 00:10:50.646, Speaker F: Past answer or the current answer in the past? Yes right now. No right now actually the piece which was called the driver that was responsible for simulating the call data and then pushing the settlement on chain is actually being able to run by the servers now themselves. So they have full submission strategy to do whatever they want respecting the rules of the batch auction.
00:10:50.790 - 00:11:28.666, Speaker E: Yeah. So initially we had this difference that our resolvers compete on chain we have the slots, the whitelist also they like stake tokens to be be able to resolve traffics. Initially we bring this model of the ledger. Each resolver have time slot. Also after the DAO vote the model was changed. Now we have about ten resolvers, they compete and the model we have dutch auction inside and in this dutch auction you start with a price that's higher than the market. Then the price slowly decays.
00:11:28.666 - 00:12:14.974, Speaker E: For this we have like a how it's a curve with the points. Then we like, start higher than market, then try to, like, if we didn't feel higher than market, so market goes up, we try to slightly go through the market, like, follow the market, and then, okay, looks like market goes down. We need to, like, still hit the deal, has still to execute. And we have this ability to customize this, say, execution model for different chains, different gas prices, different volumes, definitely. So we again try to provide this best service. This is like, I think, kind of innovation here for the intense things that we introduced in the space. Thanks.
00:12:19.114 - 00:12:43.914, Speaker A: So I want to go to you about the commitment of the p two, p layer. Could you explain that? How can you do this kind of commitment games in the p two, p layer, what you're trying to do here? And it would be great to hear about the more standard that you want to bring, how that will go from step to step. And then we can get some sort of an alignment somewhere, at least not a consensus, but it's the first step as an alignment.
00:12:45.414 - 00:13:21.226, Speaker C: Yeah. Thank you. So there's two fundamental pieces that commitments really kind of address, and one is essentially the fact that you have this pipeline of meV, particularly on layer one, and depending on what actor you are in the pipeline, you have some advantages and disadvantages. Today, the block builders build the entire block. The relay doesn't do much, and the proposer has kind of a monopoly where they can propose whatever they want. And tomorrow, it's increasingly looking like the relay might have a different role, where the block is perhaps built by an entity. Maybe the bottom of the block is built by a block builder.
00:13:21.226 - 00:13:55.206, Speaker C: The top of the block is appended by the relay, and perhaps an inclusion list is added by the proposer so that you have this kind of amalgamation of a block, for lack of a better term, it's kind of a superblock. Now, from a decentralization perspective, this is the direction that Ethereum and people who are aligned, like us, want it to go. But it poses some challenges putting three slices. Yeah. So, you know, the benefits is decentralization. Right. The blockbuilder who's building the entire block today can censor your transaction, but if tomorrow it has to do with the relay appends, and then, you know, the inclusion list has to come in.
00:13:55.206 - 00:14:34.632, Speaker C: They don't have full control on the block, so they can't really censor your transaction. So you have better censorship resistance, and then, you know, better robustness for the security of the network. Well, they don't have the power anymore to censor it. Right. So they can only build such portion of the block and then the rest of the block is built by somebody else. And chances are if you have enough actors, you're not going to be censored by everyone, right? So that's kind of the motive there. So one you want, and then the second kind of disadvantage of the scheme today is that each of the actors has a lot of say and they can vertically integrate by becoming also some of the other actors to kind of monopolize things for themselves.
00:14:34.632 - 00:15:35.076, Speaker C: So you're an integrated searcher builder. You have some advantages that neutral builders don't, but really we want people that are more neutral to likely run some infrastructure such that they won't censor things or they won't skew things their way. So in order to kind of facilitate or get rid of some of these systemic inefficiencies, you need something where you can kind of connect people together. Like if a searcher can act as a builder through an intermediary software, such as if you, then that builder can also have searcher powers. By working with that searcher, you actually have a more robust, more decentralized, more censorship resistance system than having one searcher builder kind of dominate everybody else who does not have those capabilities. So you need these coordination layers in order to facilitate these in an increasingly decentralized and increasingly complex transaction lifecycle. And we believe intense platforms, we believe protocols like cowswap and one inch, we believe solvers like propeller heads will want to communicate with each other through such mediums.
00:15:35.076 - 00:15:46.956, Speaker C: We believe there will be other mediums than the one the peer to peer network MeV commit establishes. But these will be important pieces of the infrastructure for tomorrow's world from a.
00:15:46.980 - 00:16:14.754, Speaker A: Market take, you have this kind of now splitted agents, let's say you have builder, you have top of the block auction, and then you have proposers inclusion list, then you're giving everyone just like slots. What if a market like in the futures, that kind of a simple market oriented things, how much efficiency this has against that one?
00:16:16.134 - 00:16:56.078, Speaker C: So the goal ultimately, something centralized is just going to be more efficient. Right now, Coinbase will always give you the best trade execution because they will give you an API, you know, like response. As soon as you submit something, it'll get executed almost immediately, et cetera. So the goal is to get closer to that in decentralized systems such that we can have the positives of the decentralized systems of decentralization itself, censorship, resistance and all of these kinds of things, while having a similar to centralized user experience to some degree. Like if you're a high frequency trader. And you're submitting lots and lots of trades. You're able to get a pretty good sense about what's happening with those trades from the exchange that you're dealing with.
00:16:56.078 - 00:17:45.284, Speaker C: You're not able to get that sense from blockchains, particularly through these now emerging sealed bid auctions and sealed auctions or private auctions where you're just sending some stuff to a blockbuilder and hoping it lands on chain. So the goal is to get that experience closer to the tradfi world. The big kind of elephant in the room here is Tradfi has the CFI, has the three x, the liquidity of defi. Maybe they don't have as much activity or whatever it is, but they have three x liquidity, liquidity. So in order for that liquidity to come on chain and the experience to be better on chain for you to get better prices, for you to have a better ux, we need some of these things that c five provides. And we need these high frequency trading firms and other MEV firms that are actually bringing that liquidity on chain to feel more comfortable trading on chain and give them the tools they need. And some of those tools are coordination tools.
00:17:49.404 - 00:18:12.584, Speaker A: How do you think from your part essentials. The standards will improve the protocols going to interact with this very adversarial environment where you're going to include the c five guys giving a seat permanently somehow, in a good way. But how do you think all these kind of standards will play out?
00:18:13.124 - 00:18:35.704, Speaker D: I mean, I guess just briefly on the last point, I think when it comes to decentralization, you can lead a horse to water, but you, you can't make a drink. Like if people, if people care about decentralization, and I think we all think that they should care about decentralization, and that's why we're here, then they should also care about decentralization of liquidity and where their orders are going. But that's maybe a philosophical discussion.
00:18:38.564 - 00:18:38.876, Speaker C: End.
00:18:38.900 - 00:18:55.854, Speaker A: Of the day, as we're saying that it's all about that we are part of an ethos, right? Yes, the C five guys are here, but here we are for greater cause. So there should be some space for that one for every discussions.
00:18:56.394 - 00:19:20.108, Speaker D: Yeah, I think whether people should use a decentralized solution or a centralized solution, you can only really have that debate once you actually have a solution on both sides. And we're still at a point with at least intents in the general case, but we don't have that yet, which is sort of why we're building what we're building. So the question was about the intense standard that we're building.
00:19:20.156 - 00:19:28.744, Speaker A: Yeah, we're still in the intents of Google Slides. That's not the case. So just want to know how the standards actually can change it to more better definitions.
00:19:29.084 - 00:20:10.512, Speaker D: Yeah. So the intense standard that we're building, I guess it has three properties, I think make it stand out. Like I mentioned, is that it's like general purpose. You can't get away from the criticism of, oh, this is just limit orders. If it's just like limit orders, you have to go beyond that and be able to set up a general purpose solution for whatever use cases users may have today or in the future. And that is supported. The second property, I guess, of the standard is that it's designed in such a way that would be familiar to anybody who comes from the account abstraction community and is kind of onboarding into that space.
00:20:10.512 - 00:21:06.012, Speaker D: I think that too is a, it's a fantastic initiative, but it's another one that's kind of like slow on the uptake. We would like to kind of solve intense and the kind of abstraction like in one, in one go because I think that they both have, like, the combination of the two is probably more powerful than the sum of the parts. And then the third point is that it's a standard. So like today you have fusion and things are factored in a sense that you have applications, and then each one has an intent layer sitting on top of them. We would like to factor out the intent layer and have it be a standard that is adopted. So that in a sense, a user is already, when a user goes to uniswap X, they're kind of implicitly expressing a preference to deal only with the solvers that are active on USWX. And I don't know whether that introduces bias into the solver set that you're dealing with.
00:21:06.012 - 00:21:17.292, Speaker D: I don't know if that is a representative, a good representation of solvers in general, but to us, it just makes more sense to kind of refactor the architecture differently and just have general purpose intents with solvers.
00:21:17.348 - 00:21:24.424, Speaker A: So end of the day, most of these on chain dexs will be depends on attracting more solvers in the intent centric world.
00:21:25.044 - 00:21:30.844, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah. More solvers is always better. Maybe not for solvers, but for users.
00:21:31.904 - 00:21:34.044, Speaker A: What the solver says about this.
00:21:36.024 - 00:22:40.984, Speaker B: Yeah, I think focusing on solving the same intents and competing on a single parameter, which today is like price or quoted price is not execution, but it's quoted price is very limiting, and it's quite short term in thinking. I think that the space of solving is so diverse and will expand so much with more general standards that solvers will diversify not only in types of intents that they solve, but also in the types of services that they can offer around those intents. ANd that is a space that's completely open. Still today, almost all solvers, there Are some exceptions. They only do swaps and they only optimize for price. They don't optimize for actual settlement guarantees, for example. They don't optimize for speed, they don't optimize for quote to settlement ratio, because what really matters is the executed price, not the quota price.
00:22:40.984 - 00:23:20.774, Speaker B: And this is just within the swaps, but outside breaking out of the boundaries of a single block, breaking out of the boundaries of just one token that you swap into. There's an endless list of features that solvers can develop and offer independent of the layers or maybe independent of aggregators as well. And I think that is the really interesting question is like in which ways do solvers differentiate outside of just optimizing the quote? I think that's really just the starting point and focusing on the discussion like will that commoditize? Yeah, most likely yes, but the really interesting parts, they start from there.
00:23:21.634 - 00:23:26.174, Speaker A: Would we get to somewhere near future, like in a very generalized way.
00:23:27.994 - 00:23:28.330, Speaker E: Some.
00:23:28.362 - 00:24:02.814, Speaker A: Sort of refunds will come to a normal user using an aa then, because that money also could be useful for other trades and, you know, in later stages. Like you get some refunds from transferwise after doing some transfers, like in two, three weeks. Like, oh, we saved some money on the other side of it. Here it is sprinkling some 20 pounds or something like that. That was interesting. Are we going towards some user centric world where everyone has to provide some value back?
00:24:03.124 - 00:24:13.796, Speaker B: I think refunds are a program paradigm. I think that's you're trying to like fix the problem after you caused it. No, you should just, I'm not talking.
00:24:13.820 - 00:24:24.948, Speaker A: About the back running, I'm talking about like being in the long run you will have some sort of more customers comes to you as a solver because you will give some rebates and things like that.
00:24:24.956 - 00:24:35.208, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. I think that's going to happen. Like on centralized exchanges, you get lower fees if you trade more. That's definitely going to happen, actually.
00:24:35.256 - 00:24:59.318, Speaker C: Really? Your point actually makes a lot of sense that they took the cost with this question. If they gave a better price to begin with, then they would attract all of that order flow. So they don't actually do it. Need to do a refund. I would love to see more across the ecosystem around this ethos where we actually get them the efficient price and everything that we don't have to figure out who owes who money. At the end of the day, that's already happening today.
00:24:59.366 - 00:25:19.394, Speaker B: Like, if you use a solvent, for example, if you use propeller swap, there's no backgrounds. You can check it on chain. Like, there are no backgrounds because the intent was efficiently solved. And by definition, that doesn't leave a unequal market price enough for an arbitrage in the market.
00:25:19.774 - 00:25:35.658, Speaker C: That's great. I think we may need to kind of change the narrative to emphasize that a little more, because to the end user, it's like, oh, I got a rebate from here. Great. And they're not aware that the product over here is just more efficient. So you don't even need the rebate. So it might be an education problem.
00:25:35.786 - 00:25:38.174, Speaker B: You need to be screwed first before you can get a rebate.
00:25:38.834 - 00:25:52.994, Speaker C: There's an old Turkish saying, I was born in Istanbul, but I'll save it for another time. But it has to do with how your mustache forms after you've had to deal with a lot of things. Maybe some turkish people can understand.
00:25:54.014 - 00:26:48.494, Speaker F: But just to add a little bit, that's the whole point of Cal swap, in a sense, because instead of just giving you the rebate, we optimize, like Marco said, to give a better price. And that's kind of like your $20 that you get for transfers wise. And now, actually, after launching MeV blocker RPC, a lot of people are confused because it's kind of the temptation of, oh, but I get a rebate with MeV blocker. Why should I use cowswap? But the point is that what Marco said, right, in order to create the rebate means that you're not getting the best price. And within that rebate, you're still not getting 100% because the error has already been made. Someone just is trying to diminish the damage of your transaction versus with cow shop or with adapt. That works in the, you know, in the intent from the user point of view, then you can actually fix the issue before it actually hits the chain, before the transaction has been created.
00:26:49.114 - 00:26:53.734, Speaker A: Right. So what's the biggest takeaway so far from Defcon at Istanbul, each of you?
00:26:56.634 - 00:27:59.254, Speaker C: For me, it's the emergence of different approaches, and it really kind of shows the decentralized nature of the ecosystem. And I think there's a, you know, even there's overlapping areas between, you know, what all of us are doing here, right? But we're all here. We're all mostly around the same ethos, and we're trying to solve these things, no pun intended. And there's collaboration, even when seemingly there's, I wouldn't say adversity, but challenges and overlaps, and we're all kind of aligned to get all of this done. And we're figuring out insights from each other, even though we're experts in our own field. And those insights collaboratively add to a better overall system. And I see a lot of appetite for new types of solutions, and I see new appetite from existing and emerging solutions for different approaches that all of us are kind of promoting in different ways.
00:28:00.714 - 00:28:31.934, Speaker D: I was at etc. And virus only in July, I think, so, like four months ago. And the criticism of intents at the time, to the point of being a meme, was like, oh, I haven't seen a definition of intents. It's a word, and I haven't seen a definition. I think this week I've seen twelve different definitions, but they all share things in common, as you were saying. That's, I think, the reassuring thing. We're all thinking about the space subtly differently, but there's a lot in the overlap that I think nobody could possibly venture that there's no definition of intents anymore.
00:28:31.934 - 00:28:44.272, Speaker D: That's tremendously reassuring and making makes me optimistic. I think, about the space and just generally, the amount of stuff that I think has been built in the last four months is phenomenal. So that's my takeaway.
00:28:44.328 - 00:29:36.424, Speaker A: This is a great point, because in each cc the same, we had a panel talking about what's an intent and how it is going to help. We ran multiple feedback forms, put together a paper definition of intent, and just published it. And I took the security. We work with a lot of security people for verification. So we just took their feedbacks and everything, how a partial order will form and what is the state paths and how the intents will be satisfied, what are the desirable property things. Not from a philosophical standpoint, but how the state transition will work. Try to put some contribution to that, like definition of intent from how can we make this more mechanized? So, you know, we bring more efficiency to the market.
00:29:36.424 - 00:29:40.944, Speaker A: So that's really a key point. Thank you.
00:29:41.844 - 00:29:57.064, Speaker B: The question was, what's the takeaway from Defcon? Yeah, I think earlier, Stephane said earlier, now intents feel real. And I think many, many share that sentiment. And the intents do start to feel real.
00:29:57.104 - 00:29:58.724, Speaker A: Intents are intense now.
00:30:00.344 - 00:30:23.624, Speaker B: Not anymore. No. They are being executed. I also feel we're so early, like there's so many open questions and there's so much design space, like we're really so early still. I want to be second thing. Yeah, block ravers, they throw the best parties.
00:30:25.084 - 00:30:25.824, Speaker A: Great.
00:30:28.004 - 00:31:06.456, Speaker E: Yeah, I guess. Sorry about the takeaways related to intents count, abstraction. All this stuff like I see there is still cause problem, let's say for the main net, let's say for account obstructions here we like one issue always carry gas efficiency. Gas efficiency better price this stuff. So like I feel like see there is no for now the good answers for the gas overhead things. So and I see wow. Like it looks like we would see maybe first solutions for the side chains like where the gas problem is not so hard and whereas the gas is cheap.
00:31:06.456 - 00:31:59.038, Speaker E: So you can spend some gas for extra byte code for execution. So it might be nice to see this, I mean in the future that we have adoption not from the ethereum but for the side chains back to the ethereum. It's like quite interesting idea, I guess also related to as you said, like twelve different definitions, a lot of stuff. And for us also would it be like a protocol or like we thought maybe shouldn't be like a protocol or even like language like I mean the mind specifically describes DSL, not just you know, define all the eaps or whatever. It just maybe would need some selective compiler for intense stuff. So that's what we have in our mind here. So and I see there is no let's say consensus about how we're going to proceed.
00:31:59.038 - 00:32:04.070, Speaker E: A very exciting time to, you know, to bring the ideas and see how it looks.
00:32:04.142 - 00:32:07.414, Speaker A: Would something like that would help players like you.
00:32:08.754 - 00:32:11.346, Speaker E: You mean like destroy language or like.
00:32:11.450 - 00:32:19.254, Speaker A: Some, he said like something you can compile your expressions more generally communicatable for a large audience.
00:32:20.714 - 00:32:23.018, Speaker F: So you mean you said DSL, you.
00:32:23.026 - 00:32:31.174, Speaker A: Don'T really need an inventory new DSL, but you can actually have some sort of a standard to propagate your messages with intent so you can execute it much better.
00:32:32.014 - 00:33:05.074, Speaker E: Yes, yes. So like because there is so different how it should look like, right. So instead of place it as an EEP or standard like of account abstraction, there is a reason name of the methods here is a call data. Just to have this as a form of language, not just as a form of standard. So the language where you have like operator the user wants let's say token transfer, something like this. So express intent, what should be the state change or something like this. Maybe again we can get back to the EVM.
00:33:05.074 - 00:33:15.414, Speaker E: What I expect the world should look like after you execute these transactions. So, like, we have a place where even this direction might work that is like, quite also inciting for me.
00:33:16.634 - 00:33:17.574, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:33:18.554 - 00:34:10.346, Speaker F: So, for me, the biggest take for Istanbul is the bull. No, no. I feel like it's good that in general, everyone has agreed and caught up to the realization that in one way or another, with account abstraction, intents, whatever delegated model trading, execution, whatever we want to call it, the only way to reach the next set of billion users or whatever target we hit is really abstracting from all the complexities, because in the end, that's what you see in tradfi or in any web two application. It's like, I don't understand how any of the technology works. I just hit a button and it works. And you still have a lot of barriers in crypto. Like, the pop up from Metamask is still not clear where you're signing.
00:34:10.346 - 00:34:26.044, Speaker F: It's getting more and more clear, but it's still kind of complicated for someone that's outside of the space to understand it. So at least it's good to see, like, everyone working together, or together, but competing at the same time to simplify as much as possible, the experience.
00:34:27.104 - 00:34:48.423, Speaker A: Thank you. So, with that, we're going to wrap with one simple question. What do you think about credible neutrality in the current mev tooling? I'm not asking about the supply chain. It's broken. There's a lot of things are inside. So what do you think about the tooling side, the credible neutrality?
00:34:50.083 - 00:34:51.663, Speaker C: What tooling do you refer to?
00:34:52.003 - 00:34:53.023, Speaker A: Block building.
00:34:54.683 - 00:35:37.234, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I would say the big problem there is that the biggest blockbusters are not. Most of the biggest blockbillers are not committed to being incredibly neutral. There's one titan that's been pushing the envelope there, but also they're not incented to do that. So it's not just that, hey, we gave them this tool and they're acting in a way that is not aligned. It's that we didn't really combine their interests with what the protocol's interests are in the full sense. And that's partly because we didn't know at the time, the research was that it was all c five DeFi on top of block. That's going to create this latency advantage that is going to change the dynamism of block building.
00:35:37.234 - 00:36:14.642, Speaker C: So now we know this, now we can design systems and better tooling that can address these things. I would agree with Marcus in that we're very early, and I think the flashbots and the foundation did a great job making sure PBS was ready for the merge. And what we got out of that was that validators can now be decentralized without having this block building overhead. So we solved that problem, which was the key problem, that there's low barriers to entry for validators, which are ultimately what's decentralizing the consensus of the network. Okay, we got that piece done. Now we have this block building, credible neutrality, et cetera, problem. Now we're tackling that.
00:36:14.642 - 00:36:24.934, Speaker C: Some of the people on the stage are tackling that. We're going to get to a place where we'll probably discover other problems that we're going to work on. But I believe these things take some time.
00:36:26.754 - 00:37:02.944, Speaker D: Yeah, I would say pretty much the same in that, like you can build all the tooling that you like, but apart, like, so long as order flow remains private and behind closed doors, the best you can do is quantify it. That's the only thing you can say about it. That's how much of it there is. It's also kind of a little easy to label Mev, like, oh, this is toxic Mev. To me, that's kind of like the easy way out. Like it's not the responsibility of people in the transaction supply chain to behave in a way that's like ethical. Like, whatever your definition of ethical is, it's our responsibility to build systems and mechanisms that incentivize the behavior that we want to see.
00:37:05.924 - 00:38:07.818, Speaker B: I would add that I agree with Simon that many of the problems that we now see downstream centralization on the builder level come because this value is there to be extracted. Then that value becomes a force for the centralization. And it's, I think you're not thinking about it deeply enough, assuming that that force will always be there. And I think many of the solutions that we have discussed today, including essential and cowswap, are actually doing a lot to reduce this number significantly. And I think that's really the place to, to innovate more, is that if we have expressions of intents and if we have dsls and if we have uis where users simply don't make those mistakes anymore, then Mev will go down by like two orders of magnitude and so will the pressure on centralization. So that is not all of the solution. That's a big part of the solution.
00:38:07.818 - 00:38:32.614, Speaker B: And it's in the responsibilities of the DApps, of the UIs and of the intent layers to make sure that it's just safe to use blockchains. Safe meaning you don't expose any MEv, even if you don't know anything about the transaction supply chain, and today, it's just unrealistic. You need to know so much in order to not get screwed and in order to not produce these incentives for blockbuilders to centralize.
00:38:35.754 - 00:38:46.934, Speaker A: Is that goes to the open state problem. You need to know so much the route to get to somewhere like you want to bring it down. Is that what you're saying? That close to everything should be a swap?
00:38:47.874 - 00:39:09.474, Speaker B: No, I mean the user should need to know more than what he wants. That's the only thing the user should need to know. He shouldn't need to know about bonding curves, about the differences between their implementation, about the difference between aggregator and an amm. It should not matter. Like the user should only need to know what he wants and not more.
00:39:09.774 - 00:39:28.534, Speaker A: And what is incentive on the other side, the supply chain to cater them. They don't have to know. But if they don't know, if they say that I want x amount of token, the lifeliness problem, if the market is tanking, how do they get those tokens or selling?
00:39:28.574 - 00:40:01.636, Speaker B: Two questions. I think the first one is interesting. How do you get the user to care? And that is very interesting. I think a lot of it is also based on values. We are very aligned, not just the builders, but also the users of this ecosystem. And thankfully they do care. Someone new can come along, Kowsok can come along, and can get a lot of the important traits, because people care and they care about the tech behind the solutions.
00:40:01.636 - 00:40:12.184, Speaker B: But we don't have, we're not going to have this advantage for long. Eventually we're going to have users who don't want to put the effort in understanding. And until then, we need to have better systems.
00:40:13.164 - 00:40:21.148, Speaker A: And they have the secret weapon, right. When the trade executed, you get this move, a lot of people goes there. Yeah, I love it.
00:40:21.276 - 00:40:48.066, Speaker E: Thanks. I said no. It sounds like a short question. You know, again, like a lot of words to say. I'll just mention again that flashbots, I think, do a great job here. That there is a standard, let's say the user exposed, not the full transaction of the cold 80 exposed on the hash of the transaction, to build a block. Then they expose only transaction logs, like what the transit was, but I won't say actually where I did the transfers.
00:40:48.066 - 00:40:59.890, Speaker E: So there is a lot of things here from, again, like flashbots, things like characterization, like this. I mean, for me, positive move. Yeah, yeah, basically, that's it.
00:41:00.002 - 00:41:02.322, Speaker A: That's it for me, I think it's.
00:41:02.378 - 00:41:43.410, Speaker F: A little bit what Simon said, what is credible neutrality? Like, it all boils down to your opinion, which is subjective, so it's very hard to force. And you can see a little bit this with Lido. Like, everyone's whining on Twitter, on what? Lido. But yet no one's building competitor to Lidar. I mean there are, but it's like, you know, build something better. And I feel like with builders it's a little bit the same. You know, everyone cries and sure they're doing this and that and don't get me wrong, like, of course there needs to be this like social push or social movement around it, but at the same time, you know, why don't you, instead of crying, go make a builder and, you know, do it in the way you think and let the market decide everything.
00:41:43.410 - 00:41:47.134, Speaker F: Isn't that the whole point of decentralization that we get to choose?
00:41:48.194 - 00:41:48.874, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:41:48.954 - 00:42:14.038, Speaker E: I would just say also life is life, how it goes here. And let's say we are just trying to do the best price for user but not try to change what is right here, try to express this better. But it's a state of ecosystem and we just all together with this, we can change here, someone can come and build this builder or terrible, right?
00:42:14.086 - 00:42:22.862, Speaker A: So it's all sums up, get back to building and let's ship some cool shit. All right, guys, thank you for coming in.
00:42:22.918 - 00:42:23.654, Speaker F: Thank you for having us.
