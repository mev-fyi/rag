00:00:01.120 - 00:00:04.314, Speaker A: Welcome to Rehash, a web3 podcast.
00:00:06.934 - 00:00:38.034, Speaker B: Hey, everybody. Welcome back to another episode of Rehash a web3 podcast. I'm your host, Diana Chen. And in this episode, we are talking all about mental fitness, solving some of the world's biggest problems, investing in high impact businesses, regenerative crypto and so much more with Ale Borda. She is the web3 lead at 50 years and a contributor to many Daos, including Git, Bitcoindao, Prime Dao and two plus. Welcome, Ali. Thank you so much for being here today.
00:00:38.614 - 00:00:43.514, Speaker C: Well, that was such an awesome intro. Thank you for having me. So happy to be here.
00:00:44.174 - 00:00:56.394, Speaker B: Of course. So for anybody who's not familiar with you, can you start off just by talking a little bit about what your background is and how you initially found out about crypto and web3 and started working in this space?
00:00:57.254 - 00:01:44.084, Speaker C: Yes, definitely. So we'll go a little bit further down my background, but I'm originally from Peru. So in Peru I had, like, a lot of just, like, exposure to Rio, like, a lot of poverty, a lot of, like, hardship, like, in the world, and a lot of also, like, of, like, amazing nature, like nurturing ecosystems, biodiversity. So it's like this blend of both, like an amazing environment, but also a lot of problems, like, firsthand there and there. For me, the thing has always been like, how can I make the most impact, like, around me and how can I change lives, like, the most because of that always drive to change the life of those around me. Starting with volunteering. I think I volunteered for probably 30 different organizations in Peru before I started mine.
00:01:44.084 - 00:02:41.166, Speaker C: We started a volunteer where we went there every weekend. We build houses and staircases in limous that actually very similar to very fluidly. We had to change our strategy when COVID started because, of course, we could no longer go to these communities and build houses. And we had to shift to education because the public schools in Peru are closed and kids had no means to have actually access to any education. So we just started like a tutoring thing that also, like, that scaled, like, so quickly. Like, within the first three months, we already had, like, I think, 3000 kids in the platform, which meant like 3000 tutors also, because it was one on one tutoring. And for me it was always about, like, yes, like doing some change, improving lives, but it was mostly about inspiring on encouraging those young people in Peru that they didn't have to kind of wait for the government or anyone else to actually change lives.
00:02:41.166 - 00:03:02.818, Speaker C: And also, like, establishing those amazing relationships with the families we helped with the community there. So it was. Every time I went there, it was like, oh, hey, amiga ale. Like friend ale. So it was super nice. It was. We became part of their families as well, but also, at the same time, even though we had, like, a lot of fundraising, we build, like, 30 houses.
00:03:02.818 - 00:03:37.334, Speaker C: We had, like, 30,000 kids in the platform. It was, okay, we're improving lives, but this is not really, like, redefining them. We're just improving them a little bit. So my drive was always like, oh, what else can we do? There must be something out there. And that's why I came to the US. I came, funnily enough, to pen, but to study entrepreneurship and see how could technology be like this, blending technology with more speed and boldness to solve these problems. And I'm very lucky that I came across 50 years that I was exactly doing that.
00:03:37.334 - 00:04:24.201, Speaker C: I had first no idea what BC was, and 50 years precedent seed stage venture capital, investing in founders, solving growth problems. And for me, it was about, I literally read their thing that was like, we support founders. I was like, oh, I want to learn with them. I want to be with them, be one more of the team and learn and also support this entrepreneur aspect. I've always been a lot of this strategic advice, early business, every strategy, early ideation, implementation phase. So here I supported our founders, who was super amazing. And then I kind of stumbled across web3 late last year, actually, in, like October or stuff like that.
00:04:24.201 - 00:05:17.464, Speaker C: And I can go more in depth into this later. But for me, the main thing that was super interesting for me was we not only use web3 to create other products, services, or something like that, we're actually trying to redefine the railroads, that kind of like the mechanism through which we operate, what we value, how we reward value, what do we see? Like, something valuable to embed, to support, and to build. So it's like a lot of this incentive design towards directly impact instead of just like, internalizing externalities. And more than that, I'm also very involved in technology entrepreneurship stuff, but also very much into the realm of, like, physical health consciousness, spirituality, food cooking, and all that realm as well. So, yeah, that's a little bit about me.
00:05:18.634 - 00:06:02.934, Speaker B: Wow, what an intro. I think one thing I'm hearing is that you've always had just this super strong conviction towards what you want to do and how you want to contribute back to the world. And you've gone through such a journey, first starting in your local community in Peru, and then coming to the states, going to Penn, like one of the best schools in the US, and then finding 50 years, dropping out of Penn because you realize the impact you can have on the world is so much greater than that. And now here you are contributing to all these data, continuing to help out at 50 years. So I'm going to start out with a really big kind of broad question. And that is what, in your view, are some of the world's biggest problems?
00:06:04.474 - 00:07:36.666, Speaker C: Yeah, that is a big question. I think the main problem in general is that we're kind of not as tapped into our internal and external connection to the world. So, like, both within ourselves, people kind of like, tend to not be as aware of, like, the impact different activities have on their body or like food they eat or the emotions they have and how that affects, like, how they show up in the world and how they're able to contribute to the world and to themselves and to others. And in the same way, we're not as connected to nature and to other people around us. So it's this, like, we've been very much taken by our jobs and our day to day lives into being on the go go and not really internalizing and saying, oh, what do I really want to do? How do I really want to contribute? And what are the consequences of my actions, both at an internal level but also an external level. And I think being more aware and more aligned with that higher self or highest potential that we can contribute to the world will create naturally, like this drive that people like me and a lot of also, like, impact driven people have on, like, naturally gravitating towards positive actions that will create a positive repoing effects in the world. Of course, apart from that, there's like the lack of opportunities and lack of access to education and opportunities to thrive and to be better.
00:07:36.666 - 00:08:30.924, Speaker C: Kind of like how I've seen communities in Peru. But it's also a lot about, hey, we don't only need to wait, we don't need to give them like extra resources or money or just donations, but we actually need to show them that, or give them the tools and the skills and show them that they can also just start on their own to create a thriving life for themselves if they have the right access to opportunities and stuff like that. And of course, the nature aspect of climate change and stuff like that. But I think in general, the common pattern comes from the root cause of, like, okay, how do I be more connected with myself and with nature and the rippling effects that every action I do can have and also live a more thriving life? Sake if you're connected with what you love or what you can do for others. You're also energizing yourself much more.
00:08:31.964 - 00:08:46.464, Speaker B: So these are all very physical, real world problems that you've described. How do you see web3 solving some of these problems? And I guess more broadly, how do you see web3 being a platform for human potential in general?
00:08:48.164 - 00:10:17.248, Speaker C: I love how you call it a platform for human potential. I think one of the main things is that web3 allows us to realize that we have that power to go away from this extractive mindset or methods that society currently operates at. So we inherently, we can move away from lack control, money, currencies based on extractive oil, gas things, and even nine to five or different mental models that we operate through life, or that we are depend on technology to actually be full on ourselves. I think a lot of the people tapped into a lot of reading and internal search and exploration know that it's possible to go away from those models. But web3 kind of like with that technology enables us to actually realize that we do for everyone else to realize that we do have the potential to change things. What I mean with this is that we can create digital currencies where we can embed our values into the monetary systems. So for example, there's some, of course this is very early and this is very high level, but there are some experiments on how do we create currencies that are natural backed currencies, where the more the economy grows, the more currencies being transacted, the more our ability to grow nature and to care for the ecology grows because the currencies are backed by nature and natural capital assets.
00:10:17.248 - 00:11:33.956, Speaker C: So this ability to create digital currencies and embed our values into the, into the systems I think is super, super amazing and embed like tokenomics and different incentives that actually nudges and encourages us to make the right actions. So what I meant before on, when I was saying, oh, people are able to tap to themselves and be aligned with the positive, gravitate naturally to the positive actions. Of course, there's not everyone is at the stage right now, right, right at the stage where they can be super aware, but how can we create these economic incentives or these different incentives within the systems that we're creating towards that? Decisions that are cheaper, better, faster, easier for people are also the ones that are better for the world, better for the environment and stuff like that. And we can create that with these tokenomics designs and other things, which of course is like, it's a challenge. Like I've been talking to a lot of people designing these systems. And sometimes what's better for the protocols for, like the token to be more sustainable and go up. It's not what nature kind of like wants, like, if you talk about carbon tokens and all that jazz, but it's still, like, on the works.
00:11:33.956 - 00:11:54.714, Speaker C: And one final thing I would say is that it's all another mental model that allows us to break from is the winner, kind of like who is the winner, who has the best strategy, because it is less about competition, which is also always good, but it's more about cooperation and these connected network systems. So those are some ideas.
00:11:55.934 - 00:12:49.704, Speaker B: I love how you're able to tie in sort of like very cutting edge, innovative tech concepts like web3, what we're building now back into these real life applications, because I think what happens a lot of the times is people who work in web3 almost exist in this web3 bubble that's removed from the rest of the world and removed from real life. And it's almost easy to forget when you're completely surrounded in this web3 world, like, what other people are going through the day to day human problems that everybody is facing. I think that's super cool. Something else I've heard you talk about through this seminar series that you guys have at 50 years called technologies for humanity. Is this concept of using capitalism as a force for good, or another way I've heard it said by you guys is impact capitalism. What does this mean? Or what are you referring to when you talk about this?
00:12:50.924 - 00:13:42.806, Speaker C: Yeah, definitely. And we have this. I think there's many different threads to pull from there. First, I'm gonna pull on the freight a little bit, just on the connecting web3 to the real life. It's especially those kind of like examples where web3 allows farmers, or allows people, indigenous people in the rainforest, to actually also gain from caring for trees or stuff like that. But it's also connected to cutting edge things that you said, like allowing scientists to collaborate better and to share IP and to break away from the kind of monopolistic style or pharma companies and things like that. For example, we supported Molekule, which with their economic, with their models of IP NFts, they're redefining ownership and revenue in scientific discoveries and enabling more collaboration across scientists.
00:13:42.806 - 00:15:45.886, Speaker C: That's with 50 years. And then one thing that we did in Amsterdam, actually, on this series of technologies for humanity was bringing people together to have different experiences, away from the usual conference hassle into, like, we had different rooms, and some people could go there and have meditation or others could have these conversations of, okay, if we want to create a world with peace or with thriving or connection to nature, what are the current mental models that are incentivizing our decisions? And what are those that we need to let go of in order to be able to build from scratch, right. Or from what is actually aligned to us? And I think that's also part of the connection to real world things, because web3, yes, we have this ability to create these digital currencies and these smart contracts and automate things. But eventually, what is really interesting is how do we actually make collective decisions? How do we come into cohesion on what is valuable to us and what do we want to see more of in the world? So taking this concept of using money or finance to create more of what we want to see in the world, I think that's where impact catelysm comes from, or these concepts of technologies for humanity. I'm going to take one step back here and say that 50 years was born about five years ago, where Seth and Leila, who were the ones who started it, saw this lack of financing going towards entrepreneurs that were doing good things in the world. And kind of like, similar to how you imagine daos coming together as a group of people who care about the same problem, the same thing here, like, how can we support entrepreneurs more in order to bring these visions to reality? And in that point of time, it was about, okay, no one is actually supporting backing founders, solving impactful visions. Like, a lot of the things in venture capital were, like, not really meaningful.
00:15:45.886 - 00:16:30.794, Speaker C: Or there was this impact investing model that was like, oh, we don't really create much returns because, like, we're more of, like, philanthropy. But we try to make the case that we could actually support founders and create one unit of profit equals one or more units of good. And that's our entire model. Like, and not only that, like, for us, it is much more exciting actually build. We are all builders in 50 years. So it is much more exciting to just, like, build with them, be. Be there for hiring, sport, whenever they need help in the lab, whenever they need help in storytelling, creating videos, leadership, motivation, whatever the founders need to scale and achieve more and more impact, that's where we are.
00:16:30.794 - 00:17:52.174, Speaker C: So it started with this notion of how do we funnel all the other capitalist models of venture scalable business to achieve more impact in the world and give it to a lot of the founders and help them along the way, but also these kind of changes throughout the years, right? Because now with web3 and with other concepts coming around, there's like these concepts of, as I mentioned, money backed by nature or augmented bonding curves or regenerative icos and different ways to finance our actions and care for the commons. So different. There's a lot of public goods and a lot of like impactful visions that are maybe not venture scalable or maybe like right now don't have a business economic model and they suffer from this like free rider problem where no one cares for them, no one cares for clean air, no one cares for even like meditation or for food, health, or organic farmers or even like climate things. So it's like how do we create different ways and different economic incentives to reward either retroactively or to support impact during markets. So that's also like exploring different ways, whether that is through maybe impact certificates that we can create an economy based on nature or different mechanisms like money backed by nature.
00:17:53.034 - 00:18:47.054, Speaker B: That's super cool. I love the application of the sort of the way where you guys have found the connection between impact and making money as well. So you're investing in these businesses that are making a big impact, but it's not just philanthropy, it's, you know, you're actually doing vc investments in like a traditional vc setting. So I want to get deeper, sort of like shifting these impact businesses into web3. We're talking about impact daos, right? And you actually just co authored a book with Kevin, a walkie called Impact Daos. And you've already talked about this with Kevin, I think on Getcoin media you guys did like a rundown, like a summary of what this book is, and people can go and buy it and read it for themselves. But I'm just curious from your view, how and why are impact Daos different from other daos and what is it that makes them so exciting?
00:18:47.754 - 00:19:54.694, Speaker C: Yes, absolutely. I think my biggest motivation actually to write this book was because we were actually with 50 years and we were like, okay, we have three super exciting, like there's a lot of different things coming around, but we didn't really see like the, where was the positive impact being made? We see some, but we wanted to kind of highlight that and then continue to build that vision forward and inspire more people to create from that sense of like, oh, let's use this technology to actually create amazing positive things in the world. And that was the same thing with Kevin wanting to push more of the git. Congrats. And the entire ecosystem towards valuing things that are super important right now. Right. And I think it's super exciting and actually I was super happy to see how much it resonated like, I never expected this impact dao term to resonate so much with people, not only from the sense of, like, very technical and very, like, strategies to tackle problems, but more for the theoretical way of, like, how this operates has also been resonated in love with people.
00:19:54.694 - 00:21:00.558, Speaker C: And what I mean with this is, how do we create an ecosystem that is more like a mesh of networks where each impact dao kind of tailors to their own set of expertise and value they're bringing to the world, but they're really very connected with all other impact hours. So it's kind of as blockchain is very interoperable, very symbiotic, and very collaborative in nature. So some impact daos will be more on that infrastructure or applied research, where, for example, token engineering commons are creating tokenomic incentives, aligning individual with collective outcomes. Then you have others, exober in nature, doing a wallet for nature, literally trying to get the species to have a say, like in the monetary transactions. Then you have celo doing this economic inclusivity for people, right? And then allowing people to transact value that they did not have access to any financing before. No banks, no nothing. And then, for example, collectivo is building on top of celo in order to allow people to transact value between them.
00:21:00.558 - 00:22:19.126, Speaker C: But collectivo is also collaborating with Astro protocol in order to measure their positive impact in the positive change in the local environment made by farmers or different things. So you can see all this collaboration across this impact daos, which I think unlocks a lot of, like, abundance mindset, a lot of, like, okay, let's ideate, let's co create. If one strategy worked, let's fork it and implement it somewhere else. Or if someone already had a mistake, okay, let's show others that that's maybe not a path, or maybe let's try something else. So there's a lot of, like, collective knowledge building and collective giving each other a lot of, like, help, and then I can move. One more thing about collective knowledge sharing that just came to mind as well is this notion of trust and deep trust between the impact dows as well. Because when we measure impact, sometimes it's about numbers and metrics and stuff like that, and people might sometimes up those numbers or frame it in a way that it's like, okay, we're achieving all this value and stuff like that, for marketing, getting more donations, stuff like that, in the case of some nonprofits.
00:22:19.126 - 00:23:08.090, Speaker C: But here, what if we can just, like, enable everyone to just say what is actually happening, like, just sharing their own strategy, their own experience, because they know that other impacts will come, come here and be like, no, you can improve this or you can improve that. So it's like this shift in mindset. I think that also I brought it from my work here where we, whenever we work with founders is like, oh, we're not asking you to give us any numbers or going hours, stuff like that. We're asking you to give us whatever you're measuring already. If we need to measure something else in order to improve our study, let's do that. But also, we want to be the first, kind of like, as we never see more investors as part of the team, right. We want to be as helpful as possible.
00:23:08.090 - 00:23:38.954, Speaker C: So we want to be that first call whenever something good goes. Whenever something goes, right. But we also want to be the first goal whenever something is wrong and whenever we need help. So it's like our founders are like super, super trustful on, like, sharing everything that is not going well because they know that's the best way we can help and we can jump on. Okay, how do we like, solve this together? I think I want to bring the same kind of energy and trust and collaboration between for the impact of ecosystem in order to grow together.
00:23:40.304 - 00:24:23.994, Speaker B: I think that's super crucial because that actually is one of the biggest criticisms I hear about VC's is that VC's, all they care about is money. They don't really care about anything else. And you guys, it sounds like you're very hands on with the, with your portfolio companies and you actually contribute, you know, more than just capital, but also the talent and the skills and expertise that you all have, which I think is super cool. So I totally hear you on this point about metrics aren't everything, but I'm wondering, with these impact daos, what are some ways in which you measure success? Like what does success even look like with these impact daos and what are maybe traditional metrics isn't the right way to think about it, but what is the right way to think about that?
00:24:24.654 - 00:25:10.100, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. I think that metrics are definitely not the end goal, but it allows us to actually improve on our studies and improve on what we're achieving. I think definitely one of the things that might not be measurable now, but we're trying to come up with different measurements. It's kind of like the depth and leverage points that each impact DAo is achieving. So, like, I don't know if you're familiar with Donella Meadow's work, but there's like different nine levels of like leverage points that we can change in people. And the further, the more in depth you go, the more rippling effects it's going to have on the rest of the system. So, for example, take and one, I'm going to give one more analogy here.
00:25:10.100 - 00:26:23.012, Speaker C: Imagine kind of like acupuncture points whenever you have like this, a lot of different issues on like the arm or something else, and you're trying to wrap it on top and it doesn't really work. But if you just like, put one needle on the right point, like, literally the rest of the body can, like, oh, like, releases energy and like, you're kind of like, no longer feel that hurt or like that pain. So, like, in the same way, like, how do we actually measure the depth and leverage points of impact that each impact Dao is kind of achieving, which it goes more into? Like, okay, one layer would be like using nfts to give donations to, or give like, food to children or something. But how do we actually re engineer? Okay, let's help them redesign their economy, their value flows. How do farmers kind of like get finance from caring for biodiversity? How do we redesign their economies? How do we redesign what we value, how we value it? And that's like more like more in depth. There are points changing mindsets, changing the railroads and the mechanisms. Another layer would be, of course, their tokenomics design.
00:26:23.012 - 00:27:19.742, Speaker C: Like how robust is it and how much it kind of incentivizing these positive actions. And this like, individual and collective good. One good. One good concept is like the augmented bonding curves, for example, that will give like a pocket of the treasury to the back to the community so they can use it for positive things, no matter if people are selling or buying. So it's kind of like an automated market maker, then some more things are also the health of the community, right? Like how much as other doubts, like how much involvement there's in governance, in decision making, computer experience, like how healthy are the computers, stuff like that. And there's, of course, the metrics, like, specific. I would say that for impact house specifically, one reason why I don't go much into metrics usually is because I want to decentralize the innovation, decentralized knowledge.
00:27:19.742 - 00:28:22.086, Speaker C: So, for example, if we have one impact dao working on biology and science, like molecule Biladao Labdao, like their scientists themselves are the best at seeing what metrics want to achieve with the drugs and with the different things develop there. Like how healthy are the people involved? Stuff like that. If we have like the biodiversity, more like tree planting stuff like, okay, what type of carbon is it? How much carbon? What quality of. Is the carbon being sequestered? What is the biodiversity, natural, like the health of the biodiversity of the forest? We're children if it's education. So it varies across all industries. So I would say there's, like, some general guidelines on the metrics of the organizations themselves, like participation, like contribution, like tokenomics, design, the treasury leverage points, and then there's, like, specifics that will go to each specific industry or problem each impact dow is trying to tackle. Got it.
00:28:22.110 - 00:28:31.850, Speaker B: That makes a lot of sense. I think another thing that really, like, resonates with me, and what I'm hearing you say with impact Daos is that values, I'm guessing, are a really big part.
00:28:31.850 - 00:28:31.978, Speaker C: Part of.
00:28:31.978 - 00:28:53.434, Speaker B: Of impact DAos, and in my mind, should be a big part of any Dao. But especially with impact DAos. From your experience, what is the best way for impact DAos to set values? Like, how does the DAo go about deciding which values are the most important to them? And there's, like, the non negotiable values and which are maybe values that they can compromise on.
00:28:56.014 - 00:29:34.184, Speaker C: Oof. I have no idea which values they compromise on, actually. But I do think, like, starting from how dos are, like, the best way they can be created are, like, whenever, like, the group kind of jumps together around the third vision, and the first thing is, like, how do we work together? Like, how do we care for each other? Or how do we, like, what are the strict values that actually drive our work? I would give, like, because I'm very involved right now with my work years. Like, some of our values are okay. Yes. Founders first, high empathy. No trivial shit.
00:29:34.184 - 00:30:21.734, Speaker C: Yeah. Like, some of those are, like, the general values, and it's like. And that kind of, like, ties into how we work usually, right? So whenever we have a list of things to do, it's like, okay, if one of them is, like, helping a fund, supporting a founder in something, we can just touch, like, delete everything else in our list and, like, focus solely on that. So, like, that. I think that is super important because it's like, yeah. The actions that will drive, like, that company or organization, I think that's also super valuable for each different working group. I think, for me, whenever you mentioned that, I don't know why, but it comes to mind, like, orca and how they're structuring their things around pots and around people first and skill sets first.
00:30:21.734 - 00:31:02.984, Speaker C: I think values could trickle down at a Dow level. What are we caring about? What are the main things we want to solve in the world and how do we want to show up? And then it goes into specific values for different bots. Like for example, I'm working with gitcoin mutual grants. First things that I said we need to have this is like we care for a team and we care if whenever we're doing an impact grant, mutual grant before daos, we need to first look at the team and how values aligned. Are they on, like achieving positive work and achieving different things. So yeah, I had one more idea, but it just went away. So I'll stop there.
00:31:03.764 - 00:31:22.714, Speaker B: No, I think that's great. Another thing, I saw you, I think I saw you tweet or say somewhere is talking about this idea of proactively nurturing the values we set. So instead of just saying, let's set these values set and forget instead of that to actually proactively nurture them, what does that look like to you?
00:31:23.374 - 00:33:19.352, Speaker C: I think one of the things will be, we were talking about measuring impact before, right? So instead of reactively going to these different organizations or even to our own teams and be like, we did this or this and like give different scorings or different ratings and be like, oh, we don't really agree with this. It's like how do we create structures, mechanisms and different methods of how we collaborate and we cooperate with each other into that, nurture those kinds of values? So for example, instead of just like, I'll take the example we're having with climate change, like, instead of just having like some standards that we need to offset this amount of carbon, how do we make sure that within, as soon as, like, the company is like starting, they have positive nudges and mechanisms that are tailored to just creating a lot of positive externalities that any, for example, that monetary returns are not the only returns that we're going to value. We're also going to value like, experiential returns, biodiversity returns, educational returns, and different forms of capital that are not only financially driven. So I think if we can engineer like, new systems that can reward people for things beyond, what's the current growth like, growth driven, extractive driven society we're kind of in, if we can just say like, oh, whatever, if you're caring for these different forms of capital and creating a real world contribution on those, those are the things that are going to be kind of like measured and incentivized towards. So those are the things that we're going to build towards instead of like the other way around. And one final thing as well with that is that with this web3, landscape. Even with, like, the bear and stuff like that, there's so much opportunities and there's so many places you could continue with and so many things you can build.
00:33:19.352 - 00:34:31.733, Speaker C: And so, yeah, like, the space, the blank space is, like, huge. So it also acts as a forcing function of, okay, let's take a step back. Let's see. Like, okay, I'm usually like, I was in Penn, so there was a clear path for consulting and investment banking for everyone. So now that we have a lot of opportunities out there, it's like, okay, I'm going to step back. I'm going to see where do I want to grow? What values do I want to bring forward? How do I want to contribute in the world? What is the best way to do that? And where is my skills and particular resonance and particular, like, perspective of the world gonna bring the most change forward for those around me, for the environment, but also for myself? Like, how do I engineer an environment and a work that actually fills me with so much energy and so much passion that there's, like, overflowing creativity and overflowing energy to create value to those around us? So I think that's huge. And that's, like, an opportunity that comes out of having a lot of opportunities, but also having people around you that are like, okay, no, let's take a step back.
00:34:31.733 - 00:34:47.253, Speaker C: There's a $1,000 you can contribute to. Sometimes I even find myself contributing to 20 different dots, and they're like, no, no, take a step back. Where can I bring the most value and where do I want to grow and what people do I want to be surrounded at so that I can create the most positive change around me?
00:34:47.993 - 00:35:46.024, Speaker B: I think that last point you just talked about, about that personal reflection and personal development is something that I don't really hear talked about in the doubt landscape very much, but it's obviously something very important. Things like, you know, everybody talks about, like, dow tooling, governance, things like that, but things like mental fitness, which is what two plus is all about. And, you know, figuring out what your strengths are, what your contributor style is, developing these leadership skills so that you can become a leader in these daos. These are all really important things as well. What, from your experiences, have helped you to identify these as such important issues? Like, have you had any personal experiences where you struggled to find your place in a Dao, or you've seen others struggle with this? Why, from your perspective, are these things so important?
00:35:47.894 - 00:36:49.074, Speaker C: Yeah, I think there's two perspectives. One is, like, where I come from, like, for me, meditation, breath work. Journaling has always been huge. Like, I think that was what I said in the first few minutes of the podcast. Like, for me, it's always been around, like, where can I make the most change around me? And that has been very tied into, like, okay, a lot of journaling, a lot of, like, asking questions, a lot of, like, internal exploration of what that work means, like, and what, like, impact means. Like, there's also this case of, like, when I was having the volunteering organizations, like, of course I was giving a lot and I was doing a lot, but at some point it was like, kind of, like, at the expense of also a lot of my energy and was kind of, like, giving too much energy to those things. And that was so if in a way took me like, okay, let's take a step back and let's see how do we create from a place of more thriving within so that we can.
00:36:49.074 - 00:38:06.446, Speaker C: So I can give more and also give more within. So for me, it was a lot of, like, okay, let's take a step back, actually, like, see how can I create this environment for myself that is also nurturing for me? And I think that's also why I did, like, a trip to Costa Rica, like, two weeks ago, because I was at Penn during the last semester working with 50 years, working with four different projects, writing the book, doing the Amsterdam organizations, and then was like, okay, I'm not really feeling inspiration and creativity and energy coming through. I'm doing the job, but I'm just doing it and not kind of, like, feeling that, yeah, that insight and inspiration. And as soon as I dropped into Costa Rica and I was like, I I could not take a break. Like, I didn't fully take a break from work because too much things was going on, but only being there, like, in a different environment. That same thing when I go back to Peru and, like, being surrounded by nature and, like, being meditation breath work and, like, different things allowed me to actually come back much more inspired and like, and even when things like same things and resonated with people. So a lot of, like, my journey has been a lot of inspiration within of, like, where do I want to contribute and how do I want to do so.
00:38:06.446 - 00:39:19.526, Speaker C: And I think in the same way that translates into me being able to show at best to my work and also show at best to others around me. And then one other more technical aspect is, like, this concept of flow and this concept of, like, yeah, new connections, new ideas, new, new, like, yeah, new ideas you wanted to bring forward in the world and actually flow whenever, like, your internal voice shuts down and you're able to create much more, be more creative, you're able to actually put in. A lot of work comes when you're matching creativity with your passion in the world with a massive transformative purpose that you want to bring forward. And that's kind of like that flow recipe, but it's also accompanied by a lot of biological things you can do for it, which entails good nutrition, good sports, fitness. Like, for me, I'm a tennis player, so doing fitness and stuff like that has always been huge for me. And I always do go surfing, kettlebells, game, whatever. If you were with me at the office, you would see me take breaks and stuff like that.
00:39:19.526 - 00:39:48.772, Speaker C: And that's also hugely important. Being in this ecosystem, in this world like that. Twenty four seven. And that always on, not only carries, like, a burden on your own physical body, mental health as well, but also just, like, on your ability to show up best. So if you want to show up, do the most impact and the most change in the world, first you have to just feel yourself within and so that then you can just, like, oh, give the overflow.
00:39:48.868 - 00:40:12.944, Speaker B: Yeah, I love that so much. Is this sort of, like, what you're talking about with the purpose economy, that when people at the individual level find their flow by sort of following this recipe that you've outlined, that we'll be able to accomplish so many bigger things when people are driven by purpose and not by, you know, money or any other things in the world?
00:40:13.264 - 00:41:06.104, Speaker C: Yes, absolutely. I've had even, like, the reason why also you will see very much consistency on, like, the projects I've been involved in is because I've, like, kind of, like, for a few weeks tried different things that were, like, not really purposeful. And I'm literally not kidding you, I was super drained. Like, it was, like, for me, it's instantly so, like, I know that. No, everyone's, like, so instantly. But, like, as I think the purpose economy and that ability to just create value and sustain yourself by giving to these impactful visions and by working on region jobs and different things that bring forward a lot of value to the world, I think it also allows you to be better and achieve more things. So, as you mentioned, this recipe of, you could actually start.
00:41:06.104 - 00:42:06.226, Speaker C: So a very practical thing. You could start thinking about 25 things you're curious of. Like, just like this is from Stephen Kotler, like, you think of 25 things you're curious of, make a list, and then start playing around those curiosities, even if they seem, like, wildly not correlated. Like, oh, match tennis with, like, your passion for, like, surf or for your passion with, like, economy. Like, what does tennis and economy have in common? There's some commonality there. And you can start, like, finding this little, like, connection between ideas that they seem, like, really weird, and then you start playing around them, and then you kind of, like, see some dimensions opening up on some potential projects you want to do or some potential new perspectives you want to bring to the world, and then they start creating and just creating and writing and brainstorming there, and then tie that into. Okay, what is one big problem in the world that I could solve? So you can.
00:42:06.226 - 00:42:46.852, Speaker C: This is very not straightforward, but there's, like, this recipe of the 25 curiosities that you can start experimenting with. And then once you tie that into, like, a massive transformative purpose, then you have something outside of yourself to also reach and achieve that is going to create a lot of meaning and value for you. And I think that's the most energetic thing. Whenever I. I tend to, ideas start creating, like, a lot of positive change. Literally, my energy. Like, I could be sleeping bachelor's, where I could, like, literally, my energy and my creativity and this sense of, like, oh, like, energy, like, flowing through you.
00:42:46.852 - 00:43:13.334, Speaker C: I think that's, like, nothing. Like, there's nothing like that. And it's bringing a lot of happiness to you as well while you're achieving, like, more impact. So, yeah, definitely. That purpose economy and how, like, daos and web3 actually allow us for more of that purpose economy because of that potential of, like, we have, like, such blank space to create from. And, like, it's always so early. So we still have some experimentation, exploration space.
00:43:13.334 - 00:43:15.134, Speaker C: Yeah, definitely.
00:43:15.914 - 00:43:36.424, Speaker B: And I can feel that energy even just talking to you. Like, that energy radiates off you, that you're passionate about what you're talking about. And that's. You've just explained that's where that comes from. So I have one final question for you before we go. And this is going back to something that you mentioned earlier about incentive design. I did want to ask you, because I know this is something that you think about.
00:43:36.424 - 00:43:52.494, Speaker B: I think I saw a tweet reference to this as well. But the way you think about it, how do we design incentive mechanisms in daos that encourage these positive externalities and prevent extractive actions right from the get go?
00:43:55.914 - 00:45:08.488, Speaker C: I think. I would love to give you an answer there, but I think that's exactly what we are trying to figure out here. 50 years and with a lot of other organizations that I'm working with, how do we actually do that? It starts with values. First, a lot of what I mentioned before, like how do we encode or embed our values into the monetary systems, but then how do we make that regenerative and sustainable? How do we make that transformative, and how do we make that supporting human work, human, human time and everything we tend towards. So I think it goes how we design that is, by co creating and by collaborating on how each of us have their own approaches, for example, as we can bring our perspective. How is it to design, to bring value to founders? How is it to support or back founders for the long term and technologies that might take a lot of time to actually be created. But I could also bring on the perspective and knowledge from, for example, Prime Dao.
00:45:08.488 - 00:46:26.246, Speaker C: How do we actually create these different ways to swap to token swaps, to create these mutual grants and mutual ventures that ensure each other's stake in each other's growth? Or create these designs like they have this proposal inverter, or this like, share shared venture where people tend to share problem and can create replay effects for everyone, like, involved in it. Or we can go to doc engineering commons and their own knowledge on creating token design systems. So I think the answer there will be, we still don't know. But that's why we have different conferences like technology for humanity or the upcoming fund in the Commons, where we actually explore the different ways in which we can do so and creating from scratch. But I think one actual thing, it starts with values. So it starts with creating from that creator within and knowing that creating and creating with embedding your own values and your ideas is not only like when you are creating an artwork or a music or something creative, like an artist thing, like being an economic designer or being like entrepreneur or strategist or stuff like that. You're also a creator, and you're creator, a creator of the value you want to bring forward to the world.
00:46:26.246 - 00:46:32.274, Speaker C: So I think that mindset will lead a lot of positive rippling effects.
00:46:33.094 - 00:46:54.334, Speaker B: I love that. The value of values, they can't be overemphasized, you know, they're just so important. Values are so important to any organization. Well, thank you so much, ally. I really appreciate this conversation. It was super uplifting for me. I think this whole week Tuesday, we had an episode with Scott Moore from Gitcoin that was all about public good and super uplifting.
00:46:54.334 - 00:47:21.126, Speaker B: And then here now hearing from you, this has just been like a very regenerative week. I think for us, for me, and for our listeners as well. So really appreciate that. Before we let you go, at the end of every episode, we do like to play a game with all of our guests. It's just a quick little game called this or that, where I say two words, a or b, and you tell me which one you prefer. There's no explanation needed. So it's just super fast.
00:47:21.126 - 00:47:25.994, Speaker B: Lightning round. I've got ten pairs of words for you. Are you ready to go?
00:47:26.654 - 00:47:27.674, Speaker C: I'm ready.
00:47:28.174 - 00:47:31.782, Speaker B: Okay, first one. Bitcoin or ethereum?
00:47:31.958 - 00:47:32.954, Speaker C: Ethereum.
00:47:33.534 - 00:47:35.110, Speaker B: Crypto or web. Three.
00:47:35.262 - 00:47:36.194, Speaker C: Web. Three.
00:47:36.734 - 00:47:38.630, Speaker B: Daos or nfts?
00:47:38.822 - 00:47:39.634, Speaker C: Daos.
00:47:40.374 - 00:47:42.394, Speaker B: Bear. Market or bull? Market?
00:47:43.134 - 00:47:44.354, Speaker C: Build, market.
00:47:45.094 - 00:47:50.514, Speaker B: Build, market. Okay, so my next one actually was gonna be building or investing?
00:47:51.394 - 00:47:52.134, Speaker C: Building.
00:47:53.594 - 00:47:55.414, Speaker B: Books or podcasts?
00:47:57.674 - 00:47:58.654, Speaker C: Vodkas.
00:47:59.674 - 00:48:02.214, Speaker B: Okay. Appetizers or dessert?
00:48:04.194 - 00:48:05.494, Speaker C: Appetizers.
00:48:06.434 - 00:48:08.254, Speaker B: Beach or mountains?
00:48:12.074 - 00:48:14.642, Speaker C: Beach. Okay.
00:48:14.738 - 00:48:16.174, Speaker B: Past or future?
00:48:17.404 - 00:48:18.144, Speaker C: Future.
00:48:19.044 - 00:48:21.784, Speaker B: And then last one. Earth or space?
00:48:22.524 - 00:48:23.344, Speaker C: Earth.
00:48:24.244 - 00:48:25.156, Speaker B: Okay.
00:48:25.300 - 00:48:25.756, Speaker C: Woo.
00:48:25.820 - 00:48:40.384, Speaker B: Good job. Tell people before you go ally where they can find you if they want to follow you personally. And then also feel free to plug away to two plus or 50 years. Get coined out, primed out, anything you'd like.
00:48:40.764 - 00:49:07.114, Speaker C: Okay, perfect. Yeah, you can find me on Twitter aleborda 21. Yes, do find me. I'm one of those people who actually always reaches out to people to learn and to just jam on things. And it's so funny that I'm telling people that now they can find me. So definitely reach out and then plug in, I think. Yeah, just plug into building impact hours and building with values.
00:49:07.114 - 00:49:51.046, Speaker C: And if you ever need any help on anything regarding your idea, your vision building, strategizing, whiteboarding, brainstorming, I'm always here and I can plug in with, like, the 50 years perspective and also any connect you with any other impact Dao builder or things like that. So definitely, I really shout out for the upcoming series of technology for humanity. We'll probably host one in New York and then another one in Paris. So very much of, like, introspection and exploration of the values we want to create with. Yeah, thank you so much for having me. This was also, like, a super regenerative conversation for me. Like, the questions were, like, super.
00:49:51.046 - 00:49:53.874, Speaker C: Yeah, super insightful. So thank you so much.
00:49:54.294 - 00:50:07.164, Speaker B: Of course. Thank you so much, Ali. And we'll include all of those links in the show notes to make it easy for people to click through.
