00:00:01.120 - 00:00:04.314, Speaker A: Welcome to Rehash, a web3 podcast.
00:00:07.454 - 00:00:28.606, Speaker B: Welcome back to another episode of Rehash. I'm your host, Diana Chen, and in this episode, we'll be talking all about trust producing art, NFT culture, and a lot more with Carson Bailey, founder of NFT Affirmations and the creator and artist behind a crypto art project called 27 Times. Welcome, Carson. Thank you so much for being here today.
00:00:28.790 - 00:00:40.622, Speaker A: Thank you. I almost just said welcome. I haven't done a podcast in so long, so I'm like, I might be out of pocket today. Just tell me what my max cap of, like, swear words are and things like that.
00:00:40.798 - 00:00:46.834, Speaker B: No cap to anything. Be completely unfiltered. You've got your wine there, so I think you're fully ready for this.
00:00:48.094 - 00:00:50.718, Speaker A: To be fair, it's 06:00 p.m. Where I am right now.
00:00:50.846 - 00:01:10.948, Speaker B: Yes. Yeah, she's calling in from Man City, Manchester City. I know the briefs because I've been watching a lot of Ted Lasso. Two years late to the game, but better late than never. Carson still got to get on it. I'm so excited to chat with you about everything that you've been working on. I'm obsessed with your projects and I just want to know more about them.
00:01:10.948 - 00:01:27.924, Speaker B: Before we dive in, though, for people who don't know who you are. And guys, this is not to be confused with the guy you see on tv, Carson Daley. This is Carson with a k and Daley, like d a I l y, maybe. Do you wanna start with where you got your name from?
00:01:28.464 - 00:02:10.744, Speaker A: That's so funny, Mike. I was just doing a prep question round with my boyfriend as I was getting ready, and he asked me that question, but actually, the story, I wish it was better, but all of my screen names used to be mother of Pearl because Pearl's my dog. Who is Pearl? Aggressively scratching right now at the counter. She's obsessed with the food here in the UK. But I was during COVID during quarantine, I had one of those Bluetooth karaoke microphones, and I was doing karaoke every single day on my Instagram story, drinking wine. And one day I was just like, okay, you know what time it is? You are. We are doing karaoke with Carson daily during quarantine.
00:02:10.744 - 00:02:34.274, Speaker A: And the next day somebody was like, carson daily? That's sick. And I looked on, like, Instagram, Twitter, everything, and it was available, like the way that I wanted to spell it, like daily, as in days of the week. And the way that my name is spelled and I just jumped on it and rebranded and now I've built my entire personality around it, and I tell everybody that you can't go a week in crypto without Carson Daly.
00:02:35.974 - 00:02:43.034, Speaker B: I love that. We need some sound effects here. I know, that's awesome. And I can't believe it wasn't. I can't believe that handle wasn't taken.
00:02:43.444 - 00:02:44.300, Speaker A: I know.
00:02:44.452 - 00:02:50.220, Speaker B: I guess it's kind of a unique way of spelling your name, but it's not, like, that weird or like that.
00:02:50.292 - 00:03:11.398, Speaker A: I know it was like a big. Because that whole time, I was trying to go through, like, a rebrand. I was like, I can't go by mother of Pearl. It was like clubhouse days and quarantine. And I was newly into learning about web3. I was like, I kind of need something. I went by super plastic Carson a lot on a lot of other social channels and stuff.
00:03:11.398 - 00:03:18.414, Speaker A: I was like, I need something that feels, like, ownable. And that was it. And it's. Yeah, it's just stuck ever since.
00:03:18.754 - 00:03:30.378, Speaker B: I love it. And speaking of super plastic, tell people a little bit about your background, people who don't know you. What were you doing before web3, and then how did you initially learn about web3 and get so deep down the rabbit hole?
00:03:30.506 - 00:04:24.498, Speaker A: Yeah. I'll try to give the abridged version of this story, but when I was fresh out of college, I was hired by a company called Super Plastic, which at the time was a startup character based product company. So collectible toys, vinyl, think, like, cars, bear, brick, metacom, you know, Funko pop, all of those. And the founder of the company, Paul Budnitz, founded a company previously, about ten years earlier, called Kidrobot. And Kidrobot was really responsible, you know, really? Kidrobot is given a lot of credit for bringing collectible art toys to mainstream pop culture in the US, and he is just a super genius. And this company was based in Burlington, Vermont, where I'm from. And I was fresh out of college, and I was just really, like, I had no, like, I was like, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
00:04:24.498 - 00:05:05.118, Speaker A: Like, they were hiring for director of marketing. I was not qualified for that job, but I applied and, like, flexed a lot. Basically wrote this whole entire lie on my cover letter, but was. Was hired eventually and started as marketing assistant and copywriter. I used to write the toy descriptions and come up with these, like, character narratives, and I was employee number three there. So I really just got to sit side by side with Paul and learn all about, you know, collectibles and psychology of collecting and art toys. I learned a ton about street art and graffiti artists and just like sneakers, everything, all of these things around pop culture that I loved.
00:05:05.118 - 00:05:52.560, Speaker A: And I went on to have a lot of different titles at super plastic, but my last position there was director of brand development. So I was responsible for just finding new avenues for the super plastic animated character universe and the products and just the brand itself. And one of those avenues was a drop with Nifty Gateway, which I worked with the team to create this fully holistic community and marketing and sales strategy. And it was all brand new for us. But I think I took that, what is it, the red pill or whatever, and got like so deeply obsessed and just quit my job one day after almost three years there and went out on my own and here I am.
00:05:52.752 - 00:06:07.468, Speaker B: That is so cool. I actually didn't realize that you didn't have a background in art for some reason. I just thought that you, based on your projects and what you're working on, that that was what your background was in, but it was actually in marketing, which is pretty interesting.
00:06:07.516 - 00:07:30.824, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I've always been a writer and I think like so many, you know, one of the stories that we learn a lot about, or that we hear a lot about in crypto art and in web3 and blockchain art is that, you know, artists were getting these jobs as graphic designers or freelance designers or, you know, their art and their talent was really being commodified, you know, for this, these commercial industries and corporations. And, you know, it took me a long time to realize that, like, I actually think that that's the same for me when it comes to writing. Like, I've always loved writing. And like I said, I would write product copy and descriptions and captions and all of these, you know, stories that felt like art to me, but they had this, this goal to sell product or to sell the brand or the characters. And it just now that I finally realize, like, okay, there is a use case for self sovereignty and blockchain technology for all of these different art verticals and styles outside of graphic design, visual arts and 3d art as well. So, yeah, I'm excited to see how more people from more creative industries that are kind of facing that same challenge, how they, they break the mold and utilize this technology for their own kind of personal liberation.
00:07:31.764 - 00:07:52.268, Speaker B: Super cool. Yeah, I totally agree that writing and storytelling can absolutely be a form of art. There's no right or wrong way to do it. And there's so many different ways to be creative with it, to be an effective storyteller. It's really not straightforward at all. And it takes a lot of creativity. So tell me about 27 times.
00:07:52.268 - 00:08:06.012, Speaker B: This is your genesis drop, your first NFT collection you dropped earlier this year. It is such a cool concept. So for people who aren't familiar with it, tell them what 27 times is, what's the concept? And, like, how you got the idea for it.
00:08:06.148 - 00:08:37.758, Speaker A: Oh, my gosh. Again, I'll try to give the abridged version, but such a long story. I have a habit of, like, overcomplicating things, but for the sake of, like, philosophy. And what better place to do that than on the blockchain where we have, like, real technical provenance? But so, as I said, I've always been a writer. And, you know, during, like, in quarantine, during COVID I really got back into writing for myself. Like I said, you know, I was really. I spent a lot of my days writing for work and for super plastic.
00:08:37.758 - 00:09:04.914, Speaker A: And at the same time, I was going through a lot personally. Like, my. My dad had passed away. My best friend died in a car accident two months later. I ended a four year relationship where I was engaged. My grandfather passed away a couple months after that, like, and for the first time in my life, I was living by myself and seeing nobody, ever because we were all in lockdown. So I started writing poetry again.
00:09:04.914 - 00:10:02.994, Speaker A: And as I was getting into kind of web3 and nfts, I thought there must be a place for poetry on the blockchain. And I saw things that I saw digital art chick had done ether poems, which I thought was really cool, but I hadn't seen a lot of other kind of case studies or use cases. So I had really started marinating this idea of how I was going to release my poetry as nfts. And also it was getting to be at a time where I think a lot of my own kind of personal identity and a lot of people, like, the understanding or consumption of who I was within the space was kind of being. It was a little bit muddy. Like, I felt like I was being put into this, like, influencer category. And people were, you know, I was having a hard time just, like, having control over, like, what my own narrative was.
00:10:02.994 - 00:11:00.494, Speaker A: And also, I think I was leaning into that identity and that Persona a little bit too much that I was even losing sense of who I was. So I set myself this goal, deadline of my birthday, my 27th birthday, and I created this concept to mint 27 original poems. And I wanted it to also provide a commentary on the NFT space. And I thought there was a lot of conversation around floor and utility and just all of the PFP craze and just feeling like we were not staying true to the promise of web3 and of decentralization, which is self sovereignty. And sovereignty is, you know, denouncing any systems that have power over you. And I think collectors, in a lot of ways, are, you know, holding power over artists. And it's making it really.
00:11:00.494 - 00:11:46.744, Speaker A: I've seen that artists are having a really hard time creating for themselves and creating and being happy to create because they're just being. There's just so much pressure from their collectors. And I wanted to provide value to collectors, but I needed my own space and my own kind of flexibility to do that. So with 27 times the NFT themselves, the genesis nfts are non transferable, except on 27 days in the first year, which are also the days that title the poems. And the kind of trust producing art concept that I came up with is that because the blockchain is. This is a protocol that can't be broken. So nobody can, you know, sidestep or go around this.
00:11:46.744 - 00:12:30.564, Speaker A: They must hold these nfts and they can't sell or transfer them. The trust in, like, believing that I'm still going to continue to provide value to them despite that they can't, you know, move these around and kind of threaten my own security as an artist by doing that, is that I was going to promise them airdrops of new art on those same exact days. So if you hold it, then your reward is this new piece of artwork. And so far, yesterday was actually the third airdrop date. And so far, none of my collectors have sold. There's been no secondary market sales, and none of them have even sold their airdropped art pieces either, which are free to do anything that they want. So it's been awesome.
00:12:31.184 - 00:13:06.242, Speaker B: Wow. Wow. There's so much thought that went into that. And I think it's so cool that you've taken this, like, kind of like, you know, cold and unemotional concept of blockchain technology and really applied it in a very human way. I think that's like something that is really missing from the space. Is that like, that technology or robot to human connection? I really haven't seen too much of that. And I think it's so cool and beautiful the way that you were able to do it with 27 times.
00:13:06.242 - 00:13:06.706, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:13:06.730 - 00:14:12.150, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I think people tend to forget that, like, humans. Like, it's called machine learning and artificial intelligence because we teach the machines, because we provide, we are the intelligence that is then integrated into these tech structures. We talk about the blockchain being a trustless network, a trustless economy, and trustless is the distribution of trust. It removes the single actor media. I think that what we have to remember is that if we really want to truly leverage the technology and the values of having trustless economies and what the benefits are of that, we have to be trustworthy people. Also, the hygiene, the emotional hygiene and the emotional integrity of the people that are utilizing and teaching this technology, like, has to be there. And I really just feel like we're losing sight of it.
00:14:12.150 - 00:14:53.504, Speaker A: After my drop, a lot of people reached out to me to ask me about the non transferable kind of limit, like the transfer limitations and those non transfer protocols. And it made me really anxious and nervous because I could see how very quickly it's possible that that practice with the technology could be utilized to spin false narratives and to create a story about a PFP project or an NFT or a community. That's just not true. So I told everybody that as long as the philosophy is behind it, like, it has to be justified for the right reasons. But I still wouldn't be surprised if people start to, you know, misuse the technology because they already have been.
00:14:54.044 - 00:15:31.666, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, for sure. I think the, like, prevailing narrative out there in the NFT world is still one of trading and, you know, like, price go up and people, like, caring to make a quick buck off of it, instead of really understanding the philosophy behind it, which is so much more beautiful and I think, impactful long term, if we can really get out of our heads with just money and prices and think about other utilities for it. So just to sort of rehash the mechanics of 27 times, now that we understand the philosophy behind the project. So there are 27 poems or 27 poems?
00:15:31.690 - 00:15:36.674, Speaker A: 27. One of one. Yep. 27 poems that are one of one NFTs. Sorry. Yes.
00:15:36.754 - 00:15:40.538, Speaker B: And there's an artwork. So it's a poem attached to an artwork, right?
00:15:40.586 - 00:16:14.090, Speaker A: Yeah. So that's the other piece of it that I forgot to mention is that the other piece for me and that, like, kind of because this whole. This, like, exercise was so disarming. Like, these were, you know, like, my best friend Megan, who a lot of people know is metaverse Meg. Like, she and I met, like, early on into my embarking into the web3 and into my own world. And she is my best friend. I mean, she had never read these poems until they were minted.
00:16:14.090 - 00:17:33.243, Speaker A: That's how deeply personal they were to me. So the collaborative nature of it, I always knew I wanted to collaborate, because my own journey and expansion into web3 and into nfts has been rooted in community. Like, true community that cannot be, can never be recreated. Like, you know, even the people who supported me, like, early on into my journey, like, you know, blau and thank ux and like, lady Phoenix and like, Josie, people that I was, like, learning from, they didn't even know. Like, Josie Bellini, like, people didn't even know I was learning from them, but they were, they fostered this sense of true understanding of what the possibility is of this space. And I always wanted this to be an exercise that was rooted in community, because at that point, if I knew that 27 artists who were my friends, that's why they agreed to collaborate with me, because we were actually friends, if I was able to just share one, share a poem with each one of them and have them love it enough that they wanted to, they were inspired to create a piece of artwork from that poem, using it as a prompt. Like, that's such a win for me.
00:17:33.243 - 00:18:11.254, Speaker A: And just like, you know, it almost felt like, for every poem, like, I had somebody, like, holding my hand to then, like, deliver it into the world and put it on the blockchain. So the poems themselves have been stylized as, like, a beautiful, amazing piece of artwork. But then they were given to these artists to then create something inspired by it with no revisions or feedback or anything. And after the auction closed, there was a reveal mechanism and the metadata updated. So now the two pieces of artwork, the poem and the visual art, are intrinsically connected forever on chain.
00:18:11.874 - 00:18:13.402, Speaker B: That is so cool.
00:18:13.538 - 00:18:16.766, Speaker A: That's so cool. That's awesome.
00:18:16.930 - 00:18:42.046, Speaker B: That is so cool. So now that you've launched this project that you've been working on and thinking about for so long, reflecting back on the whole process, what are your overall feelings about it? Was there anything that was really surprising to you? And also, I'm curious to know, what was it like dropping something so personal and private in such a public manner?
00:18:42.230 - 00:19:38.034, Speaker A: Oh, my gosh. Well, I think the lesson that I'm the most, there's a couple things that I'm the most grateful for. One is, like, as always, with anything that I do, I'm just so grateful and so surprised that I am able to do these things. Like, somehow, for whatever reason, whatever wires exist in my brain, it's just do. There's no try, it's just figure it out. And Megan and I always joke, like, Megan went to Cal Poly, so she's heard this a lot, but our motto for our agency and in our friendship and in life is learn by doing. And if we want to do something, we want to edit this video or want to create this thing or we want to figure out how to utilize this technology in a real empathetic and intentional way, we just do it.
00:19:38.034 - 00:20:17.220, Speaker A: And I think it's really remarkable to see. See all those things come to life. Like, there wasn't a single thing that we had to, like, kind of, like, you know, crumble up and throw in the bin and be like, fuck it, we can't do that. Like, we just figured out how to do everything, which is amazing. And then, you know, the second piece was that one of the, one of the things, like, one of my real, like, KPI's and the things that I was really committed to disrupting with this drop is like, this idea or this, like, you know, classification that I was, like, an influencer because I was like this. Like, I want people to see that. Like, I'm an artist and I also am, like, a creative, and I have a real deep understanding of how this technology works.
00:20:17.220 - 00:21:00.210, Speaker A: And this is my way of proving this. And, like, I'm a human. And, like, here are all the pieces of, like, how to prove that. And, you know, I was, I realized that, like, once I saw, like, once the auctions actually ended, most of the people who collected my genesis collection, I had never spoken to. Like, I had no idea they were like, I think I had this idea that I was. I would know, like my friends would or like, people who I knew who I had been spending time with in this space that I knew as collectors would collect my work. Because it's me, like, which is a really, you know, I think, like, you know, kind of narcissistic way of thinking which, like, I'm taking ownership of.
00:21:00.210 - 00:21:45.514, Speaker A: But, like, the people who collected, I was like, you know, I reached out. I think at first I was kind of scared and, like, generally distrusting. And once I reached out and spoke to them, they were like, yeah, I've been following you for a while, and, like, I love this thing that you did and this thing that you did, but, like, this is so much different. Like, and just to see the side of you, like, I'm so grateful for it. And, like, that was amazing because without kind of that, you know, identity that I had created, these people wouldn't have been a part of that journey for whatever reason and then bringing us together. So I would say, you know, that that was, like, really a remarkable feeling and a remarkable experience that I'm super grateful for. And then, you know, how does it feel afterward, like, oh, my God, I was so fucking tired again? Like, I just.
00:21:45.514 - 00:22:30.406, Speaker A: The burnout is, like, so real and it's scary. But, you know, I'm. At this point, I just. I do feel, like, a sense of relief that, like, the only real people that, like, I have to truly, like, worry about or think about or create for are, like, my 27 collectors. And they seem to be happy, like, almost two months later now. So, yeah, it's like I'm just kind of figuring out, like, what can I do next? Like, how can I? And now I think I have more trust with them now that we've been through three airdrops and nobody's sold. Now I'm like, okay, I really want to start to create, like, some big things with this and, like, really invest a lot of, like, my time and creativity to, like, make this feel incredible because they're not going anywhere.
00:22:30.406 - 00:22:33.034, Speaker A: Like, I think at this point, like, they're in it.
00:22:33.934 - 00:23:15.034, Speaker B: It sounds like the whole experience was very personally validating for you, too, because you talk about, like, not wanting to be seen as this influencer, and we all sort of see influencers or even people. If you watch reality tv and you watch these people, you think you know who they are or, you know, whatever, but it's like you really only see one side to them. Like, people that are on tv or people who are influencers. Like, they put out this very, like, on side of them and a very, like, specific brand, however they've chosen to brand themselves. And you, I think, like, through this project, poured out your heart and soul, and people saw that and people really liked it. And that has to feel so validating.
00:23:15.334 - 00:23:40.114, Speaker A: It is good because it kind of feels like I, like, can just kind of do whatever now. It's like I poured, like, a bucket of, like, white paint over the canvas. Like, I was like, like, okay, I know I can go back to, like, I can shit post if I want to. I can post, like, emotional shit if I want to. I can post poems if I want to. Like, it's nice to, like, kind of be free and liberated. Like, again, it gets back to that.
00:23:40.114 - 00:24:17.696, Speaker A: It goes back to, like, self sovereignty and digital identity is, like, so much more than your PFP. Like, there's so. It's really scary. I think, like, the more I think about what happens when people get hacked, when people, if people have to choose between changing their life with the liquidity that they could get from this PFP to then, like, at what cost. The cost is their sense of self and sense of identity. And sense of value and worth to this larger community. Like, there's so many things, and, like, I have spoken about this for over a year at this point.
00:24:17.696 - 00:25:13.802, Speaker A: Like, what we learned in web two, you know, with the advent of front facing cameras and Snapchat filters and, you know, lifestyles of influencers and, like, that whole, like, sharing mentality in psychology. Like, we learned so much, and I hoped that we would be in a place where together we could remember how toxic and dangerous that was and we could heal through web3. And we haven't. And we're not. I think we're making it really worse. And so I think in my own way, this was like, 27 times was like, my, like, me proving, like, look, we can all take steps and we can use this technology to heal personally. And then when we are healed people, we show up in community to bring more healing and to promote healing together.
00:25:13.938 - 00:25:16.842, Speaker B: So I love that so much.
00:25:17.018 - 00:25:17.698, Speaker A: I want you.
00:25:17.746 - 00:25:26.334, Speaker B: I mean, I hope you're going out there and just telling this to everybody because we need so much more of this kind of thinking and more people like you in this space.
00:25:27.394 - 00:25:28.314, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:25:28.434 - 00:25:57.258, Speaker B: But moving on to a bit of a more lighthearted note, another project that you created and launched is called NFC affirmations. And this is kind of like a fun little project with all these. It's not so much about, like, the artwork itself as it is about the messaging on it. And there's, like, I don't know, like, I can't think of any examples off the top of my head, but, like, what are some examples of, like, the affirmations that are on.
00:25:57.306 - 00:26:28.880, Speaker A: There's so many. There's, like, there's some about, like, oh, first thing I do or, okay, one of my favorite, the floor means nothing when you're looking at the stars. As a favorite. I'm too hot to pay federal income taxes. The cockfosters invited me to Christmas. Like, all kinds of just, like, ridiculous things. A lot of them are things that, like, you know, really were, like, are actually, like, cherry picked, like, from Twitter feeds.
00:26:28.880 - 00:27:36.090, Speaker A: Like, I call it a crowdsourced project because, you know, it's just really meant to be. Like, it was meant to capture kind of the culture and the sentiment of the crypto space at the time. And, you know, I think, again, that's another one where I learned so much. And I think I was really, like, I kind of felt like I was, you know, I kind of, I got, like, axed from the knees up a little bit because it happened at, like, I released the project at a time where like, the PFP wave was really like, taking over. And I had never considered like, what it would feel like to, you know, when utility, when, when moon, like, floor all this shit and like, you know, people were going into discord and posting like, oh, I got this font, like, says ultra rare. And I was like, wait, what? Like, I thought that I was creating something that was like, truly non fungible where like, what the message was would mean something different depending on who saw it and who held it. And I think, again, it was like, I think it was definitely a project that was ahead of its time.
00:27:36.090 - 00:28:51.592, Speaker A: And at the same time, it was released with three other people. I'm going to grab Pearl because she's being, it was released with, here's Pearl with three other people who I think that we all, none of us people aren't prepared to become company founders overnight. When you launch a project and really when that project is launched out of passion and creativity, friendship, you know, you, you don't realize like, just how much of a burden that, that becomes, all of those things. And, you know, I'm really proud that we were able to recently, like, come together and make a decision to, you know, stop the mint. And we, we stopped the mint at 3000 affirmations and now we've all kind of mutually agreed to like, go our separate ways and to provide utility and real utility and access and benefits to affirmations holders in whatever capacity, individually that we want to without feeling like anybody is being taken advantage, taken advantage of or taking advantage of the others. But again, just meant to be fun. And I think when money gets involved, people stop having fun.
00:28:51.592 - 00:29:36.198, Speaker A: A lot of people were like, oh, you made x amount of ETH off of that. What are you doing with it? And I was like, I wrote 10,000 affirmations. I worked on this. This was my job. I've reinvested it, I've thrown parties, and I've paid to produce merch and stickers and these things and bought from artists within the community people. I think that was the thing that really made me open my eyes to what's really a lot of the issues that exist within, like, the NFT ecosystem and space is that, like, not everybody is here having fun. And if they're not having fun, they want to make sure that nobody else is having fun either.
00:29:36.198 - 00:29:40.902, Speaker A: So, yeah, yeah, I'm gonna drink, I'm gonna have a sip.
00:29:40.958 - 00:30:26.516, Speaker B: Drink to that. Have a sip of your wine. I think everyone just comes into this space with different motivations and I think a different sense of what this is all about, like, I think, like you were saying before, you were lucky to have really good mentors like Josie Bellini, who helped you understand what all of this is actually about. But I think a lot of people who might just find out about NFTs through, I don't know, like, popular web two media and everything, all the talk, like, everything that's written about is about the prices and how the price is, like, soaring through the sky. It's insane. Or now, like, the price has dipped so much and it's not worth anything, and crypto is dead and all of these things. And I think that gives people a different sort of mindset or motivation when they come in.
00:30:26.516 - 00:30:51.664, Speaker B: And, yeah, like, even recently, I met an artist who, like, I bought one of his art pieces, and it's sort of just this cool. I just thought the art was cool. I wasn't like, oh, I'm gonna, like, become a millionaire off of this or anything. So I bought one and I met him, and I was like, oh, my God, you're the guy that, like, did this art project. Like, I got one, and it's, like, so cool. And he was like, oh, thank you. And then he was like.
00:30:51.664 - 00:31:06.102, Speaker B: And then he, like, got kind of defensive and apologetic and was like, I swear there's something more coming here. Like, you know, it's not just this. Oh, my God. No. Like, I just thought the art was cool. I don't care. Like, I mean, great if something else is coming.
00:31:06.102 - 00:31:26.184, Speaker B: Like, I'm excited. Yeah. Like, I'm excited for you, and I'm excited to be part of that. But also, like, I have zero expectations. Like, don't feel like you have to build something just for the sake of building it or making people, like, not angry about it. Like, I just want. I want this no matter what, you know? Like, it doesn't matter.
00:31:26.184 - 00:31:57.826, Speaker B: And so that was exactly like, he had the same mindset that you were talking about. You know, where artists, I feel like they feel that they owe something to the community more than just the art itself. And while community is really a big part of why a lot of people come into this space, it's not the only reason. It's not sort of like. Like, there are so many ways you can create art and so many reasons you can create art. And artists should really, like, feel more comfortable with just creating art.
00:31:57.970 - 00:33:20.440, Speaker A: This is something that, like, my boyfriend and I have talked about a lot, is that when you build a community, like, when based around your art, around your brand, like, the experience that we both have had, you know, but you feel like you don't even want to enter that discord and you don't want to check the notifications for that, for that, for that page or whatever. Like when you're, when you are, like, stripped of the excitement and ambition to, like, continue on because, you know, of how just, like, aggressive and demanding and, you know, mean people are, like, people just, they don't get it. Like, it just feels, it feels worse than, like, you know, even just thinking about, like, when I worked at, when I worked at super plastic, like, there would be times when toy box would be damaged or maybe a toy, there was like a misprint on a product and maybe one janky had two left arms or their accessory was broken or whatever. Like, things happened and, you know, of course customers in the community would be upset and disappointed, but we were able to fix it. Like, you know, we'd be like, oh, shit, sorry. Or like, if there were delays, like, you know, they'd be bummed, but it wouldn't, like, somehow I just don't understand how we got to a point where, like, it just became such a demand. Like, where, where is, like, where is the autonomy, I think.
00:33:20.440 - 00:33:26.004, Speaker A: And, like, who is really in charge here? Like, that kind of, that has scared me off a lot.
00:33:26.904 - 00:33:54.018, Speaker B: Yeah. So I guess with that, like, I'm curious to hear your thoughts on, like, how we can sort of shift this mentality or this culture that's been created. Because there are, I feel like even in this conversation, we've talked about all sides of web3 culture. Like, there's the good, the bad, the ugly, but, like, what can we do differently to make this space, like, more positive vibes only and more like people who are in it for the right reasons.
00:33:54.186 - 00:34:56.194, Speaker A: Oh, my God, it's such a hard, it's such a hard question. Like, I don't know because I feel like I have tried in so many ways or I'm like, is not working. I think, like, we have to focus on micro approaches and, like, you know, my focus at this point is, like, even less, like, about onboarding people into, like, the NFT space, but, like, onboarding creatives. Like real professional positions, like graphic designers, web designers, like product designers. Like, I think focusing on product building. Like, this is what, you know, kind of what's next for me. I think a lot of people are going to realize that I'm going to kind of fall behind the scenes a little bit because I have now done a lot of work to build communities and it kind of is the same thing and it's exhausting and there's a lot of really incredible elements to building community, but there's a lot of bullshit and a lot that really just makes you want to run away and rug forever, truly.
00:34:56.194 - 00:36:32.762, Speaker A: But we need to start building product that speaks to people that are of a higher level of sophistication and understanding of culture and technology and bring them in that way. Like, this is, products are what make people understand processes, I think, and systems. Even in the web two and traditional product world, I think some young people might have entered into marketing or advertising roles in positions and tried to say, okay, we want to spend $10,000 to have this influencer promote our product. And an older boss or CEO or managing partner might have been like, that seems like a waste of money. We could do X, Y and Z with it, but then there would be tools like Grin or upfluence or Shopify or even Facebook ads manager that would show, like, here's the return of investment on that $10,000. Here's a tool that shows you, that shows you why a decision was justified and validated in how it promoted your brand or your product or got you closer to your goal. And then all of a sudden, those managing partners or CEO's or whatever that were in those positions that didn't quite understand with that younger, more entry level or mid level executive was talking about, all of a sudden they got it because they didn't have to understand why it worked, the psychology behind why it worked.
00:36:32.762 - 00:36:56.844, Speaker A: They just had to see that the money was well spent and that the effort was well put. So I think, like, that's kind of where my, my mind is now shifting to that. Like, we have to stop trying to, like, bring people in to be like, oh, my God, you can sell your art this way or you can, you know, make money this way and you can quit your job this way. Like, you can be part of a community this way. Like, all those things will already.
00:36:56.924 - 00:36:58.244, Speaker B: They will always exist.
00:36:58.324 - 00:37:20.634, Speaker A: That will always be true. Like, what we have to kind of what we have to do now is, like, build product to show, like, how this is, you know, part of improving their quality of life and, like, their, their, you know, security and safety and, and, you know, liberty and agency while using the Internet. I think that's kind of where we're headed right now.
00:37:20.974 - 00:37:25.574, Speaker B: Yeah, and that's probably a big part of marketing and storytelling and branding and web3, too.
00:37:25.694 - 00:37:26.070, Speaker A: Right?
00:37:26.142 - 00:37:37.750, Speaker B: Which, speaking of, actually, I would love to hear your thoughts on, like, what do you see as being some of the biggest differences between marketing in the web two world versus marketing. In the web3 world.
00:37:37.942 - 00:38:30.910, Speaker A: Oh, my gosh. I don't even know. I think, you know, people in the, like, web3 world kind of have this, like, data paralysis where there's, like, so much data, there's so much data available because it's all happening on the blockchain, where it's like a transparent ledger that people don't really know where to start and how to qualify and quantify and really analyze that data. So I think they're having a hard time making real informed decisions when it comes to marketing, you know, which I am the same at this. Like, people will either do too much or do too little when it comes to web3. And, you know, I think web two is very focused on, on data and kind of on analytics and insights. So this is a big difference in marketing.
00:38:30.910 - 00:39:42.250, Speaker A: And I also think that just, like, people in this, like, somehow collective consciousness is changing in the way where, like, in web two, like Gen Z and particularly Gen Z consumers, there was a study done where they would have to see a product, like, five times through five different verticals within their inner to most outer social circles. And usually three of those circles included some type of influential person or famous person that they did or didn't know. But I think in web3, I feel that people are being a lot more impulsive, and that really only takes kind of a person of like a certain kind of funnel or character Persona bucket. I don't whatever that is for them to make decisions. So, you know, I'm wondering kind of where that, when that starts to shift. I think that on both sides, that should be shifting. And it makes sense that, you know, Gen Z hasn't really entered this space yet because they haven't been hearing, there hasn't been enough repetition and kind of recognition from their kind of inner to most outer circles.
00:39:42.250 - 00:39:53.054, Speaker A: So I don't know, there's. I don't know if that was a very good answer. They're all just like, hypothesis, but I think data is a big piece of it. Just data.
00:39:53.474 - 00:40:29.572, Speaker B: That second, I mean, both points were really interesting, and I think definitely there's something there. That second piece is something that I've been thinking about where it's like, you only need to have one quote, unquote, influencer, just like somebody on crypto Twitter with a lot of followers that everybody knows one of those people to say something. And it's like, everyone takes that as the Bible and the ultimate truth seriously. It could be good. That's a marketer's dream. Or a company's dream. You just need one person to say something good about your company or your product.
00:40:29.572 - 00:40:56.612, Speaker B: There you go. So much money made. But on the flip side, it's super scary because what if this person says something that actually isn't right or isn't good or is toxic and harmful to people? And everybody takes that as the truth and runs with it. And I think we have seen this happen on crypto Twitter multiple times. I think anybody who's on Twitter a lot can think of at least a handful of examples of this.
00:40:56.668 - 00:41:17.536, Speaker A: So true. So true. I think there's such a loss of. Of ownership over, like, your brand's messaging and story and, like, it's just dangerous, too. Like, I've. I've had people tell me that they bought, they bought into a project because they saw that I followed it. Like, that's so, like, that amount of kind of, like, sheepish kind of herd mentality is.
00:41:17.536 - 00:41:39.544, Speaker A: Is really dangerous, I think, in any avenue, especially when it comes to money, especially when it comes to product and, and crypto even more so. So, hopefully, you know, we find a good balance and we can kind of start to understand more around behavioral patterns in this space. But we shall see. Until then, I will drink wine and mind my own business.
00:41:41.524 - 00:41:55.502, Speaker B: Totally. Yeah. I think diversity probably plays a big role in that, too. I think just by making the space more diverse, you bring in people with different thoughts and different perspectives, and that should help sort of, like, tone down the sheeps.
00:41:55.558 - 00:41:58.358, Speaker A: You can have a whole episode on that. I'm sure.
00:41:58.446 - 00:42:07.550, Speaker B: I know. I'm sure. All right, well, thank you so much, Carson, for coming on. Do you have any final thoughts to share that we didn't get to talk about yet?
00:42:07.702 - 00:42:40.272, Speaker A: No, I'm just like, it's exciting to be kind of, like, back and, like, having conversations with awesome people and, and, you know, love to see, see, obviously, women like, making trailblazing in the space. And I think content is a missing piece here as well. Like, having content that is truly, like, you know, that has passionate people and that has new ideas. Like, it just feels like the same shit over and over again. So I'm happy to be here. And hopefully I brought up something, at least one or two new ideas to anybody that's listening.
00:42:40.328 - 00:43:00.972, Speaker B: But so many things. So many things. This was just such an uplifting podcast, and I really hope that people hear this and really have, like, a good think about how do we humanize this new, awesome technology that we have and really, like, do good with it instead of making the same mistakes we made in the past and turning this into like real life black.
00:43:01.028 - 00:43:10.348, Speaker A: So much opportunity here. So much opportunity. Way more than financial. So we'll leave them with that. But thank you so much. I'd love to come back anytime.
00:43:10.436 - 00:43:23.900, Speaker B: Oh my God, please. And then before you go, tell people where they can find you if they don't already follow you.
