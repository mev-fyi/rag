00:00:00.240 - 00:00:47.494, Speaker A: I think the initial idea came from a combination of me wanting to start my own podcast with also wanting to create either a Dao or a community of sorts with media folks in web3. I was seeing that there weren't too many people involved in media in web3, and I wanted to bring everybody in that space together so we could learn from each other, work together, things like that. So I thought, why don't I combine these two ideas? And that's how the idea for a community owned podcast came came about. And that way we could kind of experiment with what that would look like. I really didn't know back then. We launched through Amir Crowdfund, and in that crowdfund article, really just laid out this broad idea that we were going to have a podcast now, and we laid out three of our core values, and that really was it. We didn't have a detailed roadmap.
00:00:47.494 - 00:00:58.334, Speaker A: We didn't really have a detailed plan about how it was going to play out. Other than that we would let the community decide which guests get to come on the podcast, maybe which topics we talk about and things of that nature.
