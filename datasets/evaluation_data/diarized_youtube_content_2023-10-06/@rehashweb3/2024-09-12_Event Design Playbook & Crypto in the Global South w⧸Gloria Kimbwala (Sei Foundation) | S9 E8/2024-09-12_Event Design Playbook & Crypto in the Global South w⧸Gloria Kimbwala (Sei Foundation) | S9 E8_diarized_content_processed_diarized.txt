00:00:06.320 - 00:00:50.785, Speaker A: Hey, everybody. Welcome back to another episode of Rehash, a Web3 podcast. I'm your host, Diana Chen, and today we're speaking with Gloria Kimballa, head of events at SEI foundation, about crypto events and crypto in the Global South. Gloria has been working in crypto since 2017, primarily within builder communities, and more recently as the events lead at SEI. Previously at Moorfield 2 and Gitcoin, she's attended and organized countless events both in crypto and outside of crypto. And she shares her knowledge and expertise with us in this episode on how to design a successful event and also from the attendee side, how to decide which events to go to when it feels like there's literally another crypto event. Every single week.
00:00:50.785 - 00:01:26.075, Speaker A: We spend the second half of this conversation talking about crypto in the Global south, what types of apps and use cases are being built out there, and more importantly, how to get funding into the hands of founders who are based in Africa and Latam regions. Gloria was nominated by Rachel Amy and voted onto the podcast by Gary Shang Hudson, Jameson Queen Wartooth, Rachel Amy, Irina Mironescu, and myself, Diana Chen. So, without further ado, here is my conversation with Gloria. Welcome, Gloria, to Rehash. I'm so excited to have you here.
00:01:26.225 - 00:01:28.839, Speaker B: Thank you. I'm so excited. Thank you for hosting too.
00:01:28.927 - 00:01:45.239, Speaker A: Of course. Yeah. And we'll have to give a shout out to the community for nominating you for the podcast and voting you on the community run process. So all of our guests on the podcast were actually nominated and voted on by our community instead of by me as the host, as like, how it normally works.
00:01:45.327 - 00:02:04.685, Speaker B: So I absolutely love that. I feel like community, like, driven content is always the best. So when the community voice what they want, like, they get. You're automatically, like, known to get, like, goodness, you know, what the community wants. And so I'm grateful to your community for deciding that they wanted me here. So thank you to you all and I'm excited to chat.
00:02:04.805 - 00:02:24.919, Speaker A: Yeah, honestly, I feel like I'm cheating the process a little bit. And I don't know why more podcast hosts don't do this, because I'm literally asking the community, who do you want to hear from? So I know already that the people I bring on are people that they want to hear from, that they're going to listen to the podcast and get more downloads. So I don't know why more podcast hosts don't do it. It kind of is like a little hack, beneficial to everybody.
00:02:25.117 - 00:02:53.611, Speaker B: Totally. I mean, in web3 in general. So we Used to do a lot of like quadratic voting on things and it's like, just let the community say what they want and I will facilitate the voting aspect of it. And I think it just means like, we would have much more quality events, we'd have much more quality rewards for hackathons. And when the community has say for an individual like me, I love it because it takes so much less pressure off of me to do the guesswork and it just puts the power back in the hands of the people. So I think that's awesome.
00:02:53.763 - 00:03:23.901, Speaker A: Exactly. Yeah. So I want to talk to you today about a couple of main things. The first is I want to talk to you about web3 events. You have been in this role of organizing events, being the head of events for different organizations for a number of years now. And from a more personal level like Rehash is actually trying to double down on our event strategy for the rest of the year, which we haven't done a ton of before. So selfishly too, I also just want to hear everything you have to say about that and any advice that you can give us.
00:03:23.901 - 00:04:00.999, Speaker A: And then the other thing I want to talk to you about too is just crypto and web 3 in the global south, what that looks like right now and how we can emphasize this more, how we can encourage the communities there to further develop, how we can help them by providing resources, not just encouragement, but actual resources and financing and things like that. So maybe we can just start with the events front. You are currently the head of events at SEI foundation, which I would be willing to bet that not many people are familiar with. So actually if you want to start with just telling us what briefly, like what is SEI Foundation?
00:04:01.167 - 00:04:35.450, Speaker B: Yeah, so SEI is a SEI network is a new layer one. And so it takes both like the dev tooling of like the EVM that's there and then the speed of Solana. So it has like a cosmos quasim, like speed aspect of it. It's new L1 and so it's kind of great that we've seen a lot of cool things being built with that. And I think from my perspective it has like the best of both worlds. And so we're seeing lots of projects from like social fi defi gaming kind of being built on that and taking advantage of both of that. So I love it because it's very community driven.
00:04:35.450 - 00:05:21.547, Speaker B: Like the people there not only at the foundation, but also like the users are very like big on our partners that have been building for them. And it's just Continuing to grow. So, yeah, you can watch out a lot for some of the events coming from SEI for the future. But we're really focused on amplifying, like our partners and amplifying the builders in their space. And I come from a very much a builder background, so I feel that with the speed and the dev tooling, again, it makes it very attractive for builders to build on it. We're using some of the traditional dev tools that were within the Ethereum ecosystem, metamasks and things like that, but they still have like the speed that was not there, the transaction speed that wasn't there with Ethereum. So I think that most builders are looking for something like that.
00:05:21.691 - 00:05:42.415, Speaker A: Yeah, it definitely sounds like exactly what builders are looking for. That's super cool. So as you are developing out the event strategy at SEI foundation, how do you kind of go about thinking about that? And I know you've done this previously at Moorefelt too, and at different places too. Like, when you join a new organization, how do you think about building out their event strategy? Where do you even start?
00:05:42.575 - 00:06:35.547, Speaker B: You know, I think a lot of it is like, what's our overall objectives in the long run? Like, if your objectives is to have like deep partnerships and relationships, you can go one way. You know, if your objectives is to have like very mass branding and be like very much known within the consumer audience, that's another strategy, different strategy that you use there. And then if your overall objectives is knowing builders, you have to like go through the builder route too. So there it's kind of like having a lot of the balance of a lot of that and then realizing that the more you focus on events, the more people will be attracted to you. So your whole ecosystem is getting build and then being prepared for that. So in reality, your first couple months is laying the ground work for the rush of people that will come from there on out. And a lot of the times you have to look at like having ambassadors, like, I can't.
00:06:35.547 - 00:07:45.241, Speaker B: I mean, there's in the web3 space. You could go to an event every week if you really wanted to and just be traveling all around the world and do that. As a mom of two, that's just not something that's in my reality. But we utilize amplifying partners and ambassadors and empowering them to host events or really partnering with us in the future to either sponsor different events around the world or whatnot. So a lot of it is just looking at what are your targets, what do you need built out, what's your community, where's your community in and really making sure that you're creating pathways for people to learn more about sei, maybe get more education about how to build on sei, or even like understanding different ways to have their projects funded and creating those pipelines ahead of time so that people really know that they don't get stuck when they do come to you. So I think, like, having a single event is maybe one layer of it, and then you have to build, like a wider funnel for people to be able to flow through. And in the end, you're just really empowering projects and people to build cool things and have them be showcased with people who want cool things built and being that bridge builder between the two.
00:07:45.241 - 00:08:31.609, Speaker B: So, yeah, that's usually what it is. And the Web3 space. Like, I've been in Web3 since 2017, and I learned about Web3 by local developers and then going to local meetups and maybe a couple ETH events. But when I was learning, I think the biggest event during the time was like, of course, DEFCON and ETH Denver, and we were only at like 1200 people at that time, so it was much smaller community to learn in, which was. Which was great. It's like, I miss some of those elements a little bit, but there's a lot happening on ground, but there's also a lot happening online. And so I think that when you're creating your event strategy, not to forget that there's people who will be equally as passionate about your project online.
00:08:31.609 - 00:09:01.927, Speaker B: And creating events for them to participate in is just as important as creating events for people to participate on the ground. And when you're dealing with your budget, you can almost do even more by having activities and activations online. But you have to think about how can you get those people to get swag or show that they participated and are members of your community. And that's something that, you know, are some of the challenges that I think about every day in my position.
00:09:02.111 - 00:09:53.499, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. So you make a really good point that there's a crypto event every week. If you wanted to go to every crypto event and, you know, for a lot of reasons, because you have two kids or, you know, for everybody, everybody has their own reasons why they can't go to every single crypto event. Even people who love to travel and don't have any responsibilities at home and have, you know, the ability to travel will get burnt out by going to crypto conferences because there are just so many of them. And one thing that we often hear talked about in this area is Like A, is it worth it to go to events at all? B, if so, which events are worth attending? So when people are considering this, how would you advise them to think about whether it's worth it at all for them to make the effort to go to these in person conferences? And if so, how do they go about choosing when there's so many?
00:09:53.587 - 00:10:42.677, Speaker B: It kind of depends on where you are during the time of your life. So if someone's a job seeker, it's going to be a lot different than someone who is trying to grow as a developer, you know. And so for someone who's a job seeker, I might be like, okay, depending on their background, go to like one of the more consumer events. But for someone who's a developer, we'll say like, you know, go to a devcon or like a, an ETH global type event or an eth, you know, Warsaw or you know, one of those type of events. Um, and so it kind of can be, it's a lot, you know, for people to try to navigate and I don't envy someone who's just trying to find their community usually I would probably tell people like, if this is your first time going to an ETH event, I would start with the smaller one. Like the smaller ones still feel very communal. You'll start to learn a lot of different projects.
00:10:42.677 - 00:11:37.719, Speaker B: I really enjoy going to hackathons when I was learning what the whole web3 space and hackathons you can get a lot more of like in the weeds, start to build something and even if you're not a dev by trade, you can start to still contribute to a project by like design or ideation or things of that nature. And you don't have to build, you don't have to win. You can just go and learn about these projects, which is great as you start to progress through your career in Web3. I personally love going to, you know, again, the smaller events, but like the side events which are more like, like the dinner side events, you know, like the more intimate type things. Because I feel that that's when you start to build actual connections with people within the industry and you can start to, you know, partner on projects. So you find out that, you know, this gaming company is looking to spread into a new community or things of that nature. So those are always really great.
00:11:37.719 - 00:12:06.787, Speaker B: And then there are always events that are like, not specifically like super side event stimulus type things. Like you know, there are the communities that do the cold plun or the communities that do the runs or whatnot. And I think that Puts a more humane perspective to people a little bit more and can make it a little bit more fun. I feel like the main events sometimes become very overstimulating for people. And, you know, you're. You'll always find me in a decompression room or whatnot. And it can be a lot.
00:12:06.787 - 00:12:53.627, Speaker B: You can feel like you have to go to talk, to talk, to talk. But I usually try to tell people that you don't have to find like the width of knowledge. Like you don't have to have a wide range of knowledge, but having a depth of knowledge is way more powerful within web3. So that same approach goes to events. It's like if I am going to go to a huge conference, let's say like, you know, tokens coming up or whatnot, I would try to find tracks that I align with. So if it was just, you know, deepen or whatnot that I wanted to go into, then I would really try to find those events and those talks and kind of integrate myself with them. Now I will have to say on the complete opposite side, I loved Zuzalu when I went to got to go to the first Zalu Montenegro.
00:12:53.627 - 00:13:29.703, Speaker B: And I loved it for a completely different reason. It was much more compact as far as the amount of people. So there was like, you know, a hundred, maybe 200 people there. And you had people from all different walks of life within the Web three space, all kind of living together. So you were able to go to, you know, do your work during that time or maybe hear that track of talks. But then afterwards you were really hearing perspectives from areas that you might not have conversations in. So, you know, even for me, who was at the time was in the public goods space, I would hear people from the longevity track, and I found that really interesting.
00:13:29.703 - 00:14:04.563, Speaker B: Or, you know, I would talk to people from the synthetic bio track, and I thought that was really interesting. So I love this whole concept of like communal events for a while where you're just having like a group of people talk for a little bit. And if ever you get invited to like, you know, the friends of type of houses that will also be on the side of some of these side events, spend some time in those because it's. It's fascinating if it's a community that you're aligned with, to hear what other projects are being built other than the projects that you are associated with.
00:14:04.699 - 00:14:40.087, Speaker A: Absolutely, yeah. So it sounds like your strategy is kind of a combination of being strategic and focused with attending the main conference, like figuring out which track you're most Interested in which talks you're most interested in and then spending the rest of your time inside events, these cozy dinner parties or, you know, friends of houses and things like that. I. Which I completely agree with. I think my strategy with conferences has always been very side event heavy and less main conference heavy. And I know that was a big complaint that people had about FCC that just took place in Brussels summer. Yeah.
00:14:40.087 - 00:15:22.259, Speaker A: Is that like essentially no one attended the main conference? And you know, for me it's, it's. I feel like it's hard for me to take a stance on this because I'm going to sound hypocritical if I do, because I am someone who like oftentimes will go to these conferences and not even get a ticket to the actual conference. Like, I'm just going because all my friends are going. That's my chance to see everybody. But at the same time, like, I've also been on the other side of it where I've been a speaker at East Denver. And it's like no one is there or the room is so loud because no one is there to hear the talks. And that feels pretty shitty too from the perspective of a speaker.
00:15:22.259 - 00:15:34.243, Speaker A: So I've experienced both sides of it and I don't really know what the solution to it is. But I'm curious to hear you respond to that criticism about ECC this year that essentially no one attended the main conference.
00:15:34.299 - 00:16:59.343, Speaker B: Yeah. I think there's an opportunity for us who are creating conferences to align more with our partners on that aspect of it and create probably fewer, you know, events or site events and more curated talks or more opportunities for people to connect. Like I think is more important, but the performer in me. So I went to theater arts schools and I always say, like, there is an audience. Like we have to go beyond the time that our talks are delivered and remember that there's an audience online and then there's an audience that rewatches a lot of the talks afterwards too. And so to just give us a little bit more longevity seeing if this is a successful event or not. But I think beyond that, there is a aspect that we really have to think about when we're trying to plan some of these events is like, how close are they to each other? Because, you know, sometimes that element of logistics starts to come into play, you know, what else is going on and then as organizers for these main events, like, how many side events are we going to let? Are we going to go ahead and cap it? Are we going to continue to have this, like, pay to play type of engagements that make it somewhat harder for some of the smaller up and coming ecosystems to join in the conversation or are we going to try to widen the funnel a little bit more and hear people from different backgrounds come in.
00:16:59.343 - 00:17:45.413, Speaker B: So I think there's that component of it and then there's this whole aspect of really a level of affordable affordability. Of affordability. Because I think sometimes there's a struggle to get into some of these different events that like people who may not be associated with sponsors or whatnot can't get tickets to have these big things, which is why they go to these side events. It's what drives the demand of it up. And these side events still are curated sometimes really well. So if you're like a senior event person, you can know like okay, you need to lock in certain events almost six months out if you're going to sponsor it. But sometimes people don't have an events lead until like four months out even.
00:17:45.413 - 00:19:32.889, Speaker B: And they're trying to put on events during these same times because we know that you know, people are going to be there. It's easier to get other speakers, things of that nature. And when we do that, those side events are much more accepting of people coming to the table. So I think there's an element of like just workability, you know, that needs to be considered when people are coming in and are we going to move to the side where you know, some of these other side events just become tracks within the main event and then you're keeping everybody in house or are we going to continue to let lend these big side events come in? And I think that's the main thing is it's, it's not that the speakers aren't great or whatnot, but it's more of like both these side events are so attractive to participate in where if you can't participate in let's say ECC or you know, token, but there is going to be, you know, a multi chain day or whatnot and it's still going to attract the same size of people or the same type of speakers, but one is economically accessible to people then like that needs to be taken into consideration to planning for the next year of like, well maybe instead of having us compete, we just join in. I know that when we were planning Schelling Point at getcoin we saw that there were always would be like funding the Commons with protocol labs and then was like, well why don't we just have stages at each other's events and then we'll just continue to co sponsor, you know, each other's events. And that just worked so much better for us in the communities that we were talking to. And I think that something like that, where you're just co sponsoring people's events back and forth and sharing stages, might be the way that we would need to go to in the future.
00:19:33.017 - 00:20:02.455, Speaker A: Yeah, that's really smart. So when you go about planning an event, whether it is a main conference event, so you're playing, you know, whether you're planning like a, say, network day or say network weekend conference, or you're just planning a side event for, say, like ECC, for example, what are the, I guess, like, ingredients that make a successful event or what. What does that playbook look like? Like, how do you. What's your process? How do you go about thinking about that?
00:20:02.535 - 00:20:43.461, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, so this my. In life, I'm always about like, you know, good food, good music, good vibes, good people. Like, so if I can have that synergy be around, it's something that I will always try to do. I always try to go the extra mile for our guests, our speakers and whatnot, and make sure that they're having as good as a time as possible and thinking about every angle I can. And so that doesn't just start with the event. It starts with everything leading up to the event and everything after the event as well, and just making sure that the underlying, I guess, theme for me is that people feel welcome in general in web3. So people need to feel welcome in web3.
00:20:43.461 - 00:21:24.515, Speaker B: They need to feel welcome at a, say, an event. They need to feel welcome when they're online and whatever we can do for people to feel welcome and have a good experience is really important to me and not only for the people who have been in my network for a while, but also people who are, like, new to web3. So I recognize, like, let's say Brussels, you know, when we were booking for things in Brussels, we were working with partners and Brussels has its own culture and whatnot. And they're like, all of a sudden, all these companies are calling us, you know, six weeks before this dates and thinking that we can magically p things together. And I was like, yes, that's very Web three. Like, we can magically pull things together in six weeks. But that's not very Brussels.
00:21:24.515 - 00:22:00.793, Speaker B: You know, that wasn't very Bogota. It wasn't, you know, so just having people understand that there is a community and a culture outside of us that we have to walk a line with and letting them come into the conversation of like, what is what? 3. Why can we move so fast? What, you know what, where's your. The biggest question people get all the time is like, where's your headquarters? Like, do you have to go back to headquarters? I was like, no. We all just kind of live in this amoeba type space and we can work within it. So I think that's very important. And then the logistics of events is very much similar.
00:22:00.793 - 00:22:39.767, Speaker B: It's like, okay, what's the budget? How many people? What's the ROI that we're looking for? What's our call to action? And then really trying to make that be aligned. And so, you know, first for where I am now, I'm always looking for builders. So we'll have a lot of builder activations. And before sometimes it was much more consumer focused and just really having those type of conversations. And sometimes it's my aspect of like, this is a cool project, we should highlight it, let's give them some space. And sometimes it's like, you know, people who are partners are saying, okay, we need to make sure that we keep our promise that we've had to our partners in the past. So.
00:22:39.767 - 00:22:40.175, Speaker B: Right.
00:22:40.255 - 00:23:06.185, Speaker A: How do you measure ROI for events? Because I feel like it's not always so straightforward, especially, I mean, you, you mentioned, you know, doing builder activations and things like that. I feel like with that, that's even a little more straightforward. You know, you can track how many builders you bring in, how many cool projects are built in your hackathon or whatever, but so many people throw just like, like raves or like parties. And like, how do you calculate ROI from that?
00:23:06.345 - 00:23:57.535, Speaker B: Oh my goodness. It's so, so difficult. You know, I think sometimes people do it on attendance, which I think is like very much a false number sometimes because you could have 20 people in attendance and four projects could come out of it, or you could have, you know, a thousand people in attendance and have no projects come out of it. And it's just kind of like, which one was the most successful? Yeah, right. So I think, I think, you know, there is an element of cost and there's an element of attendance and it's like, would we do this again versus not? But I always like to see like key things being if it's a builder one, like having something go to actually make it to mainnet when we launch or whatnot is huge. So I always like seeing something like that. But sometimes it is just again, the partnerships that coming out of it that you measure ROI with or your call to action, like how many people Actually did it.
00:23:57.535 - 00:24:32.619, Speaker B: Some people measure Twitter followers, some people measure, you know, tbl. So it's just kind of spikes in the networks. It's. It's all, like, different activations and that you can look at and think, like, okay, this could possibly be attributed to an event that we had. But I think what's interesting is also looking at, like, when you start to look at retroactive funding and people seeing, like, hyperserts or things that say, like, this event was impactful to me until now. I'm going to retroactively fund it or even show, like, no, this event was very impactful. We should have it again.
00:24:32.619 - 00:25:05.779, Speaker B: And I think those stories also have weight. So Web3 has, like, started to design these mechanisms where we could actually see things retroactively, how impactful they were for people, and then decide moving forward if we want to do it again. But we have to remember that this whole space is brand new. And so, you know, the more that we try to see if it's. If it had impact, it's like, we might not even know for, like, years later, you know, whether or not it had impact towards it. But it does. So I never think anything is done in a void.
00:25:05.779 - 00:25:53.629, Speaker B: And, you know, some of these partnerships that I've met two years ago finally are coming into fruition. It's like. Like the BD side of Web3 where you're like, okay, I've known this person. I've been massaging it for a while now. We can actually do some activations and go deeper. And that's something that we have to remember in the space too, is like, every time you connect with someone, it can be good or bad, and it might not lead you to the relationship that you thought you'd have immediately. But every interaction is important, and it can lead to something years down the line where you sponsored a bounty and you answered, you know, someone's question, and they went on to, you know, fund a company later that has no relation to your bounty, but now they want to partner with you for something else.
00:25:53.629 - 00:26:21.823, Speaker B: So I think it's important to me that you just maintain those type of relationships with people. So it might not be a partnership. It could be a job. It could be, you know, they want someone to come in and talk about something or whatnot, things like that. It's really important, as we continue to grow this space, that you realize that you have impact beyond just that one conversation that you have with people, you know, so just be kind to people as you interact with them.
00:26:21.939 - 00:26:59.207, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's a good Reminder for organizers as well, too, that when you're organizing an event or even just sponsoring an event, putting money towards an event, that you want to make sure you get your name out there, you get your branding out there, you get your people out there infiltrated into the event so that they can be speaking to as many people as possible. Because I've definitely been to plenty of events, like parties and things like that, where I have no idea who's sponsoring it. Like, I have a friend who's like, we're going to this. Come to this. And like, okay, great. I, like, I still couldn't tell you who sponsored it. Whereas I've been to other similarly sized events.
00:26:59.207 - 00:27:23.543, Speaker A: And like, the company's branding is everywhere. And maybe it's like, not a company that I was familiar with or like, you know, what have been would have like gone out of my way to go to, but because my friends brought me there and now I see their branding splattered everywhere and like, everyone's talking about it. Then all of a sudden I'm like, okay, now I'm kind of intrigued. Like, what, now I'm going to look into this, you know, or talk to somebody about this.
00:27:23.599 - 00:27:24.287, Speaker B: Totally.
00:27:24.431 - 00:27:49.023, Speaker A: I think that's a really good reminder too, for especially when you're sponsoring like a rave or a party or a really big event, like a kind of like, showy, just party type event, that there's still a lot you can do there to make your money worthwhile. And, you know, just make sure that you're actually doing that so that it doesn't feel like such a waste and you do get some ROI from it.
00:27:49.079 - 00:28:28.351, Speaker B: And I always think, like, you know, you're your best swag is your employee swag because they're walking billboards for the company, but they also have the knowledge that they can explain anything. So remember that when you're designing swag, like, make really cool employee swag so that they want to wear it. And then people can then ask or like, be like, oh, we saw you sponsored this. I want to ask you about xyz and just making the connection to the company very easy afterwards. So it's not just branding, but then it's like, how can people know more? So when a company has their, you know, at least Twitter handle or their website on their swag, I think that, like, makes it so much easier for people to connect with them.
00:28:28.463 - 00:28:54.643, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a really, really good point. I feel like most like companies swag when you join your company and they send you a box or whatever, it's like stuff that you're never going to wear. At least, like speaking from personal experience, you know, stuff you're never. You're like, this is nice. I guess it's making me feel, you know, welcome and like I'm part of the team, but like, am I going to wear this out in public? Like, probably not. Yeah, that's a really good reminder to companies like, don't make your swag so low effort. Put some effort into it.
00:28:54.643 - 00:29:13.929, Speaker A: And that can actually bring you dividends in the long run. Okay, I have one more question for you about events and this, this is actually a question from Hudson Jameson on Twitter. He said, what has been your favorite conference or top three that you've been to and why? I know you called out a few earlier, but if you had to like rank your top three, I'd be curious.
00:29:14.107 - 00:29:23.573, Speaker B: Yeah, so my top three, devcon Prague was. That was my first devcon. It was very small, intimate, and it was my first introduction to the 8th community.
00:29:23.629 - 00:29:25.989, Speaker A: So personally, which DEF CON was that, by the way?
00:29:26.037 - 00:29:47.643, Speaker B: DEFCON Prague was either 2018 or 2019. I can't remember on that one. I think it was 18. Yeah, that was cool because I thought it, like, I thought it was going to be like a convention, like traditional conventions where you go from nine to five and then like everybody does their thing. But it was, it blew my mind. So that was my favorite. And yeah, I met some great people there.
00:29:47.643 - 00:30:19.443, Speaker B: So Prague will always have one space in my heart. Suzali Montenegro will probably easily be my second just because again, it was my first time dealing with network space and we're all trying to figure it all kind of out from that perspective. So that would probably be my second favorite. And then my third favorite conference is actually not an ETH conference. It's. It's called Grace Hopper. It's where you get 30,000 women in tech altogether and we talk about all different spaces of technology and whatnot.
00:30:19.443 - 00:30:56.439, Speaker B: That's by far my, one of my favorite conferences because it's women in tech and we're talking about everything. And then I lead their open source day track. So I get to get women involved in open source and show them what's possible. And it's always a reminder for me when I see the women in the space that aren't in Web3 and then being like, oh, this whole, like, industry is basically built on open source and what's possible there. So I think that's like, yeah, easily my, my third one. And my whole dream would be if ever we could bring Web3 and, you know, Grace Hopper together and get more women into Web3, especially the technical women. I would absolutely love that because they're there.
00:30:56.439 - 00:31:15.359, Speaker B: They've just never been introducted to web3 and like that there's a opportunity there. And I think women are the most impacted by career changes through life where web3 would be a very easy solution for some of the problems that are faced once people start to advance their careers. So, yeah, I would love it.
00:31:15.407 - 00:31:20.063, Speaker A: That would be awesome. And I think she fi is doing really good work in that direction.
00:31:20.159 - 00:31:20.751, Speaker B: Love.
00:31:20.903 - 00:31:21.679, Speaker A: Yes. Yeah.
00:31:21.727 - 00:31:22.879, Speaker B: So love Maggie.
00:31:23.007 - 00:31:29.759, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. So I could totally see some sort of transition of Grace Hopper 2 through Shifai to the rest of crypto.
00:31:29.807 - 00:31:30.727, Speaker B: That would be totally.
00:31:30.831 - 00:31:51.703, Speaker A: Yeah, that would be awesome to see. I just have to quickly read off a comment in the chat from Grace. She said Gloria's eyeshadow and lip gloss are popping. And I cannot agree more. So just want to let you know that before we move on. So I want to move on and talk to you a little bit about Web3 and the global South. I believe your background is your Congolese.
00:31:51.759 - 00:31:59.455, Speaker B: Do I have that right? Yes. Yeah. So I'm the first one from my family, born in the United States. My whole family comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo.
00:31:59.575 - 00:32:07.233, Speaker A: Amazing. I'm sure you still have some ties there since, you know, your parents or grandparents, like all previous generations were from there.
00:32:07.369 - 00:32:07.753, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:32:07.809 - 00:32:27.851, Speaker A: I don't know how deeply involved you are in that ecosystem, like, from a crypto perspective, but can you speak to, like, what, you know of what the current state of Web3 and the global, like in Africa or just in the Global south, generally, wherever your knowledge expands to, like, what the current state looks like.
00:32:27.993 - 00:33:18.179, Speaker B: Yeah. You know, so when we start to think of, you know, when we start to think of crypto in general, like, we always think of crypto being strong when people are adopting it and having strong use cases for it. And I think that crypto in the Global south has probably one of the strongest use cases, because in the Global north, we see it as like a digital asset. You know, it's our fiat is pretty stable, but these, you know, cryptocurrencies are a little bit more risky or whatnot. And so people, you know, try to at least use it and hold onto it as an asset, where in the Global south, their fiat currency is much more volatile. And so the cryptocurrencies, even as, like, risky or unstable as they are, are much more stable than their fiat currencies are. And so there are more use cases for People to get, you know, paid in crypto or like accepting crypto and things like that.
00:33:18.179 - 00:34:13.359, Speaker B: So they might not be holding onto it, but they're like trading it much more at a high spot. And so I think that on the other side of it too, at least in like places in the Congo and Kenya and places like that, they're very much used to this concept of having a digital like currency, like using M Pesas or things like that for payments from different safety aspects of it. And so there's a very ripe ground in the Global south for innovations. You're seeing a lot of great projects come out of Nigeria, coming out of Ghana, coming out of Kenya, you know, and E Safari does a lot about pushing projects within the Africa content. You know, eFlatam deals with the Central America and South America very well. And so there's a lot of great projects that come out of that. And even in Web3's whole history, you know, there's great projects that have had some longevity within the Global South.
00:34:13.359 - 00:35:19.977, Speaker B: The one side of it that people don't realize is like impacts or impacts them is like the funding aspect of it. So people having access to like VCs or having access to different incubators that will allow some of these projects to go not really from 0 to 1, but from 1 to 10 or 100 to 10,000. Like that's the funding that people need. And I know that there's a lot of funding available through like grants rounds to get things started, which people have been utilizing a lot. But we need to as an ecosystem start to grow the larger funding opportunities to the Global south and even some of the hacker houses or the builder houses in the spaces and whatnot too. Because I think that's the, the last piece of the puzzle, like getting people to use the cryptos already, they're getting people to trade and cryptos already there. When you're talking about behaviors, it's just getting the funders for these ideas, the funds that they need to continue to build out their projects because they already have an audience that understands it.
00:35:19.977 - 00:36:17.693, Speaker B: And traditionally if the funders are only coming from a certain space and the Global south, funders have to explain the need or explain the cause or explain the culture or whatnot. They're really losing the opportunity to gain the funding. And it's not to, not because of any disservice to themselves. It's just really lack of education on all of us that are funding these projects. So the more that we can create pathways where they can have access to funding and we can let people understand that it's on us, the funders, to understand the project more and not have to let those projects to explain it. The better opportunities that you would come out with because the more diverse a project is, the more it's going to succeed. And especially in the crypto space, when you come with a built in community that's already understanding trading and it's already understanding, you know, the use case of it and see crypto being much stronger, there's.
00:36:17.693 - 00:36:21.989, Speaker B: It makes a case for us to, to really start to fund some more projects that are based down there.
00:36:22.117 - 00:36:23.005, Speaker A: Right? Yeah.
00:36:23.045 - 00:36:57.129, Speaker B: And we, we use it all the time. Like, I mean, and so I was part of like DRC and there's a part like refa, refund reform, drc. So we had talked to different opportunities within the DRC to use it for like within the region space or like environmental spaces, things like that. But it's much more stable. And the one thing I try to tell people is like, if ever you don't think there's a need for crypto in the global south, just try to send money to the global South. And then you start to realize like, wow, this is so difficult. Like, it's so much easier with crypto.
00:36:57.129 - 00:36:57.529, Speaker B: So.
00:36:57.617 - 00:37:29.605, Speaker A: I know, I think I was just talking to Grace actually, who's in the audience and she was also on the season in a previous episode. I think we were talking about how like, it's just wild that international remittances are still a problem in this day and age. Like, how has this problem not been solved? This is like the most basic problem, right? Like before we're building cool apps for like doing cool things. Like what did we think that the first thing to do is like, figure out this problem of like being able to pay each other and especially across borders.
00:37:29.765 - 00:37:52.325, Speaker B: Oh my gosh. My mom was trying to buy a house in the Congo. I think if the house was like 30K, you know. And so we were trying to move money from like her bank to the seller of the house's bank in the Congo. And the process with the bank took, I mean it took like 22 days. It was 15 emails back and forth with like official documents and whatnot. And I finally told my mom.
00:37:52.325 - 00:38:18.369, Speaker B: I was like, you know, at this point you could have like put me on a plane, sent me to my uncle's. I could have showed them how to accept crypto and we could just done it that way because it was just taking so long. And for me it's like always interested in how people have to move money. I was like, this is absurd. Because they wanted, they had to have official documents and my mom would like literally hand write a document and translate it. And they're like, yeah, that's official enough. This is crazy.
00:38:18.369 - 00:38:43.413, Speaker B: Like I can actually create like an actual like, you know, let's say a hyper sort or something that you needed, something that was official and then like move things back and forth. So it was just showed me like the areas where crypto had much more opportunities for legitimacy or like, you know, privacy or things like that than the traditional spaces. But yet people have to still use these traditional spaces because we haven't built those avenues in crypto just yet, so.
00:38:43.469 - 00:39:00.699, Speaker A: Right, that's so funny. It would have been faster for you to fly all the way over there, teach someone how to use crypto and then send it versus the way that you did it through banks. That's so funny. Can you give us some examples outside of payment app, some examples of use cases or apps that people are building in the global South?
00:39:00.787 - 00:39:27.005, Speaker B: Yeah, well, you know, like, so Open Zeppelin was Open Zeppelin that was built from Latam. I want to say it's Open Zeppelin that came from Argentina. So that's like much more security side of things. So there's that side of it. There's lots of infrastructure sides that people are coming up with. You know, there is payments, there's games. I mean there's some great games that are there too, and lots of play to learn aspects of it as well.
00:39:27.005 - 00:40:33.293, Speaker B: I think the other side of crypto that people start to think about is like the more that crypto is solely like in English, the less strong it becomes. But the crypto community, like the Latam crypto community is actually really strong, really passionate. They do a lot of stuff with, with crypto as a, like the regen community there, reforestation and utilizing things of that nature. So I think there's some avenues there that make a lot of sense to take the leads. And then just getting the people like involved in crypto as like careers, you know, you're getting a lot of very intelligent people from global south that choose careers in cryptos and they had come from like law or banking or things like that, traditional ones where they didn't have as many opportunities, but they had a lot of intelligence and then they're bringing it to the U.S. or sorry, to the crypto space, not necessarily the U.S. and then there's an opportunities that I've seen within like more government legislations and how like accepting and open they are to crypto.
00:40:33.293 - 00:41:44.813, Speaker B: And that I think it's going to be a lot of advantages where the Global south is going to start to take the lead a little bit more. So like watching places like Panama, watching places like Salvador, I know Panama for sure is doing a lot within like the banking space and the government space together and trying to fund things there. So I think in the next like three to five years it would be really interesting to watch some of those components come back. And then I always start to think about now this isn't Global south, it's much more Global north which is when Taiwan dealt with how they infrastructure Web3 and their government. So I think that the more governments start to become accepting of Web3, I think there's going to be opportunities for them to learn cross globally and people who are open to Web three are going to start to be creating much more infrastructure for their citizens. A lot more is my guess. But I also think that there'll be a movement of people away from places that aren't crypto friendly to places that are crypto friendly, where they can still have quality of life.
00:41:44.813 - 00:42:35.695, Speaker B: And I, I've seen people go to, you know, Colombia, have gone to Mexico City, have very strong crypto communities there as well as Portugal, Ghana, like. So I think that there's going to be a lot of movements like that where people are just going to migrate towards more crypto friendly places. And Global South I think is going to be equally as competitive as Global north just because they have more environmentally fun, temperate places to, to live around the equator where you can kind of enjoy the summer all year long if you want to, or you can kind of get to places a lot easier. So I think there's, yeah, I don't know if Global north will always be the powerhouse as far as crypto funding is going to be concerned. I think there's going to start to be a shift in seeing a lot more towards people who are using it every single day beyond just holding it and staking it.
00:42:35.815 - 00:43:11.925, Speaker A: I can totally see that. I mean I, we all know the world is becoming increasingly more international. You know, people travel is becoming easier and easier and so people are going places and more mobile and I could totally see people moving towards the countries that are more crypto friendly because they are mobile and why not? You know, so I, I could totally see that and hopefully that will happen because I, I don't think it's a good thing for all of the, you know, the funding and all of the resources to be concentrated in the, in one region, anywhere in the world. So I'd love to see that more spread out.
00:43:12.085 - 00:43:15.701, Speaker B: And I think the way people work is going to be a lot different too.
00:43:15.773 - 00:43:16.141, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:43:16.213 - 00:44:23.567, Speaker B: With the addition of crypto, it's like a lot about, you know, your tokens and, you know, how your, how your tokens create your voting power within different daos and like how you want to work within the dao. And so this whole aspect of working 40 hours and like kind of grinding in order just to have a payment for your home, I see a lot of people, people working, you know, when they want to work, whether it's 20 to 30 hours and having like a higher quality of life and whatnot and still getting paid while they travel all over. And so I've seen, you know, this group of kind of like people who just graduated college and are in Web3 and they're kind of living this very nomadic life. And then I think of my son who's 15, and thinking about, like, would he. Does. Will he go to college or will he do something where he starts to work within a crypto org or a dao or whatnot and kind of earn that as he's continuing to learn and continuing to build his portfolio. And I think there's going to be a lot of people who decide not to go to college per se, but learn from the spaces and get engaged with communities that are moving the needle forward with a lot of different topics a lot faster.
00:44:23.711 - 00:45:06.741, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. So, last thing on this topic, I just wanted to kind of circle back and wrap it up with how can we, as most of our listeners are listening from the global north, mostly like the U.S. how can we, like, what can we do to help encourage and help fund projects in the global South? And I know one thing you mentioned earlier is we need to take it upon ourselves to really better understand what people are building down there. What are the best ways for us to do that? Because, like, even, even when I think about people in the. If we're just thinking about the U.S. right? Like nowhere outside of the U.S. even within the U.S.
00:45:06.741 - 00:45:51.329, Speaker A: it is extremely difficult for minorities, for women to get VC funding as compared to white men who went to Ivy League colleges. So, like, even within the US we are seeing this problem. And then when we expand beyond that, it's like, wow, not only did you, like, do I not recognize what university you went to on your resume, Like, I don't even, you know, like, I don't even speak your language. Like, I don't even understand your culture. Like, so where do we start as people that live in Primarily the US or the Global North. What can we, what steps can we take proactively to push this forward and help the world get to, you know, this, this better internationally funded state that we want to see.
00:45:51.497 - 00:46:38.241, Speaker B: Yeah, well, I mean, I think to the point of women not getting funded like in the US I always think that's so absurd because they like statistics have shown that women led teams outperform male led teams like multiple times over. So, you know, I think there's just biases that we have to start to navigate on that aspect of it. But from a Web3 community side, there's a. We're traveling all over the globe all the time. And I think the main way for us to really be impactful is to what I call like, take the day forward. Like you can be at an event and an event all the time, but at some point in the event, you got to see the culture of the place where you're at and engage in that culture. And I think as event organizers, we can do more to include the local culture.
00:46:38.241 - 00:47:35.599, Speaker B: Make sure we're getting a lot of local speakers who are impactful, not only from a Web3 standpoint, but also people who are not in Web3 who are still leading things are impactful to it and maybe giving opportunity opportunities for them to discuss it. I think one of the most impactful conferences I had been to before was Sustainable Blockchain Summit in Paris where we had people who were leaders within the NGOs and the UNs and whatnot around the world. They're also talking to blockchain people and we were hearing each other's problems and seeing how blockchain could solve it. And I think that if we brought people to the table together and said, okay, let's all really hear what are problems you're facing and how we can have solutions, that would be good. But also, you know, these smaller events in the Global south also need funding for their events too. And to be able to continue the work. And a lot of times the leaders of these events are also working like, you know, other outside jobs.
00:47:35.599 - 00:48:26.501, Speaker B: And so being able to help continue to fund the work of the people who are doing the work on the grounds is extremely important. I think your easiest step up to do is look at the get coin grants from places around the world and just, you know, be able to donate a dollar at a time for the people who are doing the work there. And then if you don't understand a doc like, I mean, Google Translate works miracles to get you 75% of the way there But I always like thinking about, like, fund causes that you like. So if you're passionate about women in Web3, fund causes around the globe that get women into Web3. If you're passionate about, you know, DeFi, find things around the globe that get people into DeFi too. And then if you have like one community, like start either fund something within that community that's dealing with areas that need, you know, some amplification. And if anything, if you can't even fund it, just amplify it.
00:48:26.501 - 00:48:47.901, Speaker B: You know, there's tons of things happening on Twitter where just a simple retweet will just take it from one silo into a whole new community. And even that can be extremely empowerful. So sometimes my Twitter has things in Spanish and French and all of these other languages, mostly just trying to amplify things are going on so that other people can get involved. And that is still very impactful.
00:48:48.053 - 00:48:58.213, Speaker A: That's awesome. Those are really. Yeah, I love those. Those are very good and easy, tangible things that people listening can start doing immediately. So I love that immediately. Yeah.
00:48:58.309 - 00:49:05.749, Speaker B: Even if it's just one that you're passionate about, you don't have to do a whole bunch. You just could find one that you're passionate about and be like, this thing was awesome, you know?
00:49:05.837 - 00:49:14.953, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. So I've got one more question from Hudson Jameson from Twitter. He wants to know what needs the most improvement in crypt culture.
00:49:15.049 - 00:49:52.905, Speaker B: I think the thing that needs the most improvement in crypto culture is in general is, like, being okay to fail. Like, being totally okay to fail. Try something. We should all be experimenting right now. We're also new to this space, so we should all be experimenting and having a culture where failure is okay and to share that failure is okay so that we create an environment where people can try things and removing, like, the imposter syndrome. So, like, removing the stigma of not knowing something. There's so many acronyms and new projects and, you know, I'll go to sleep on Friday and wake up on Saturday and something totally new has happened.
00:49:52.905 - 00:50:16.259, Speaker B: So if we can just destigmatize, like, not knowing. I think that would be the best. Because I've been in this space seven years. I don't know everything that's happened in the space seven years. I can only imagine how difficult it would be for someone brand new to, like, jump into this space and try to figure out where to go. But really being accepting of people and. And letting people, like, being okay with asking questions that people would consider a dumb question.
00:50:16.259 - 00:51:00.511, Speaker B: Like, there is no, dumb question. And it's even more important for us who've been here for a while to ask the obvious question. Like, okay, so what does it mean to what is an nft? Maybe that's the question that needs to be asked in a room of people who just don't know and being okay with someone asking those questions. So a lot of times if I'm moderating a panel, I will start with very, you know, low level, like this is basic stuff, and then build up to a key question. Because I can't assume that everybody comes with the same breadth of knowledge and we should be okay with that, with understanding that people come from life experiences. That also is just as impactful as the knowledge I might have of what, three, you know.
00:51:00.623 - 00:51:39.507, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. I think everybody who's been in the space for a long ish time should ask themselves all of the basic questions and answer them from their own words. So like, ask yourself, like, what is blockchain? Like, what is crypto? What is an nft? And then answer it and see how far you can get. Because I think people would be surprised. Like a lot of people who've been in the space for a while and think they're really, you know, they're, they're like, like if somebody asked them, like, what is an nft? It's like, oh, roll my eyes. I can't believe you don't know what an NFT is. But it's like, then ask, then answer it and see, see how you answer it.
00:51:39.507 - 00:51:47.051, Speaker A: Because you might be surprised that it's, you know, it's harder to answer these really basic, quote unquote basic questions than you would think.
00:51:47.203 - 00:51:48.091, Speaker B: And totally.
00:51:48.163 - 00:52:11.919, Speaker A: Yeah. And I also think to your first point about like, failure. I think we need to redefine failure as well. Like, I think failure. Like people in this space, especially, like you said, there are a lot of high achievers. They're like ex lawyers, ex bankers who got interested in crypto, want to put their skills here. A lot of really smart and successful people have a very, I think, strict definition of failure.
00:52:11.919 - 00:52:52.745, Speaker A: And it's like anything that doesn't become a unicorn company, it's like a failure. And I think like, the fact of the matter is like, like you said, we are still so early in the space that we owe it to ourselves to be experimenting in this space. And what comes with experimenting is like, like things are not going to work out. Otherwise you wouldn't be experimenting. If you knew that things were going to work out for sure it wouldn't be an Experiment, Right. Like that's the purpose of experimenting is to test your hypothesis whether you're right or wrong. So in that, like when you frame it like that, I think if you experiment with something and it doesn't work out, I don't think that's a failure.
00:52:52.745 - 00:52:59.475, Speaker A: I think that's a success because you have now learned that this thing doesn't work, you know.
00:52:59.515 - 00:53:34.735, Speaker B: Yeah. And I always think of like developers when I think of failures like this passes. So you have something that will pass or fail. And sometimes you expect to fail and you expect to fail because of this thing. And so sometimes a failure can still teach you something and you may actually know what that failure is going to teach you or it's going to teach you something that you absolutely did not know. And in our spaces we should have a lot of things that we're like, oh, well now we, we learned that it did this, you know, and we won't do that again. Or maybe we will do it again and we'll give it another try.
00:53:34.735 - 00:54:08.261, Speaker B: Where when things are work and they pass, we're like, okay, it works, it passes, it's stable. Let's go and create more failures, you know, And I think that that's going to be the way that we advance in a way because we didn't get to the current systems that we've had, you know, currently without a lot of failures. You know, a lot of things made it. A lot of things don't make it. Like if I think of digital streaming services, so we have, you know, Spotify and you have YouTube music and whatnot. But there was a whole thing when I was growing up and it was Napster. And Napster like, doesn't exist.
00:54:08.261 - 00:54:43.305, Speaker B: I mean, it doesn't exist now, but I mean, it had to go to like court and it had to go through this whole thing of like all these boom busts, you know, that had happened in order to even survive to get us to where we are right now. And so we don't really look at it now and be like, you know, was Napster a complete failure or whatnot? You're like, no, it was a pioneer, you know, and so maybe some of our failures that we have were just pioneers to get us to some of these spots that we have to get to in the future. And you got to realize that you yourself are the pioneer. You're the one who's creating that trail. You know, there's not a trail for us right now to go through.
00:54:43.385 - 00:54:43.841, Speaker A: Right.
00:54:43.953 - 00:54:57.553, Speaker B: Understand it, it's hard and it like, if you Think this is difficult? It's like, yes, it is difficult. It is hard. Take a moment, pause, recollect yourself, and then if this is where you think it needs to go, go that route and tell us how it works, you know?
00:54:57.649 - 00:55:04.333, Speaker A: Yeah, no, it's like, Yeah, I agree 100%, Abster. So that YouTube and Spotify and all of these can run.
00:55:04.469 - 00:55:05.005, Speaker B: Can run.
00:55:05.085 - 00:55:15.253, Speaker A: Yeah. That's where we're at. And that's what we're doing. We're paving the trail. We're, like, out in the middle of the mountain, totally undeveloped area. We are building a trail for the first time. We don't know where it's going.
00:55:15.253 - 00:55:27.741, Speaker A: We could end up off the side of a cliff, or we could end up at the top of the mountain. But, like, once the trail is built, then future people will be able to trail run straight up the mountain instead of doing what we're doing now.
00:55:27.813 - 00:55:43.299, Speaker B: So it reminds me of, like, the Charlie Chaplin film where he has to, like, fix the train and the train's coming, but he has to lay the track while he's riding the train. Like, that is all Web three. We're all like, we're laying the track as the train is moving at the same time, hoping we're going in the right direction. So.
00:55:43.347 - 00:55:59.367, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, totally. So to wrap up this episode, we finish every episode with a Can you not. From our guest. So this is just kind of like a, you know. You know when people are like, can you not do this or say this or whatever? So do you have a Can you not for us today?
00:55:59.491 - 00:56:03.791, Speaker B: Yeah. Can we not look down on others just because they have a different experience than yourself?
00:56:03.943 - 00:56:15.847, Speaker A: Yes. Love it. I love that. I love that. And that wraps up our conversation so well. So we're just going to leave it at that. Tell people, Gloria, where they can find you if they want to follow you personally.
00:56:15.847 - 00:56:20.367, Speaker A: And then also feel free to plug away at anything else that you've got planned or that you'd like people to check out.
00:56:20.431 - 00:56:31.211, Speaker B: Yeah. So you can always find me on Twitter. So I'm at G Kamballa. K I M B W A L A. You can find me pretty much everywhere there. I'm pretty public, so you can always reach out. Out.
00:56:31.211 - 00:56:57.835, Speaker B: I'm more than happy to answer any questions that you might have or continue any conversations other than that. Let's see, I will be at Token in Singapore and I'll be at devcon in Bangkok. And so you can find me there. If not, you can always reach me on the interwebs. And if you have any other questions, you can always reach me@gloriaayfdn.org for the Save Foundation. Yeah, so I would probably say that's usually the best place to find me.
00:56:57.835 - 00:57:01.691, Speaker B: And. And yeah, that would be perfect all around.
