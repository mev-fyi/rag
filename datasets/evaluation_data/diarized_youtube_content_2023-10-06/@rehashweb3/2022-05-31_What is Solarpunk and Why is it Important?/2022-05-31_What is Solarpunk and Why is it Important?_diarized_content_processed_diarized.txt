00:00:03.240 - 00:00:08.870, Speaker A: Can you explain for anyone who is like, what does solarpunk mean? Like, what do you mean when you say solarpunk future?
00:00:09.022 - 00:01:49.512, Speaker B: I don't know if any one person can claim, like, ownership of that meme, but to me, it's a world where humans and nature are living in harmony, and technology is being used to support the ongoing, sustained flourishing of both humans and the natural world. One kind of aspect of a solar pump future to me, or a better future to me, is one where there are just more self sustaining communities, where a conflict, let's say hypothetically, in eastern Europe, does not totally disrupt the lives of everyone in the world. We live in a time where a shock in one part of the system affects every part of the system. Let's take the bright side of it, because we're so interconnected to not ruin things for other people, because it comes back to us. But at the same time, we should also be investing in technologies that allow us to grow crops locally and be also more reconnected with nature, to 3d print things that we need for our nutrition to be able to not be so overly reliant on landfills and just overall learn what it means to have like, a zero waste circular economy. I think we're pretty far away from that, practically speaking. But part of why it's important to talk about what our future can look like and what it almost needs to look like in order for us to not be constantly worried about, like a dictator, like having a bad day, or more than that, just having a vendetta against the world.
00:01:49.512 - 00:02:08.704, Speaker B: And that affecting the whole world is we need to just start building more resilience. We need to start building technologies and adopting practices that allow us to rely more on each other in a hyper local way, and at the same time, enable hyperlocal communities to share best practices and technologies that enable that resilience.
