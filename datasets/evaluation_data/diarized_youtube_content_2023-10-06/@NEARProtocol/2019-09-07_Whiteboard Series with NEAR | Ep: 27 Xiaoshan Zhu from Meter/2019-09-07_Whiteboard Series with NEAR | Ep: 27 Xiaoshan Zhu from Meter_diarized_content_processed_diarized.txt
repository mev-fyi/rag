00:00:04.650 - 00:00:16.718, Speaker A: Hey, everyone, welcome to a new whiteboard episode. Today we're with Xiao Hong from Meter. We'll discuss how their platform works. Do you want to start by introducing yourself and the project?
00:00:16.804 - 00:00:41.898, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So, hi, everyone. My name is Xiaohan Zhu. I actually have an engineering background, like, for a while, and then I moved to investment and finance. So I used to run a VC fund called ZMT Capital. We invest in cryptos and blockchains back in 2016. That's how I got into the space.
00:00:41.898 - 00:01:56.046, Speaker B: And then while we're investing in these projects, we've been just thinking, like, what's the valuation? How do we value these cryptocurrencies? What are the fundamental use cases? So that's where we realized that we need to create a different type of infrastructure to really empower decentralized businesses. So that's how we started meter. So basically, on a high level meter, the goal of the meter project is to create Alibaba on web three. What it means is we want to basically standardize interconnect values and then settle them on blockchains quickly. So fundamentally, we do three things. One is that we create a universal unit account that's native for crypto, not linked to any fiat currencies, but fundamentally, it's economically stable in value. Secondly, we basically redesign the consensus and the game inside the economic game inside cryptocurrencies to create a faster consensus approach.
00:01:56.046 - 00:02:12.690, Speaker B: And finally, we support intercommunication with existing cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum, and also, in the future, other blockchains, like Nier, for example, maybe. Yeah, sure. So, yeah, that's a high level overview.
00:02:12.770 - 00:02:16.726, Speaker A: All right, let's dive more how exactly it works.
00:02:16.828 - 00:03:34.158, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So maybe let's start with the stable unit of account. So basically, if you look at all the cryptocurrencies today, for example, like bitcoin, when bitcoin was designed, I think Satoshi, in one of his email threads, he comment on that, basically, he wasn't sure how to design the monetary policy to be basically uncheatable. So that's why he put in the 21 million hard cap in there, which made bitcoin an excellent vehicle for investment because of the limited supply, the rigid supply. But for any economy, when the system grows, you run into a deflationary issue, and in a deflationary economy, it actually discourages production and investment. So let's say if I'm like a baker today, I, for example, purchase a flour, purchase sugar with some currencies. I want to make a cake, several cakes, and sell them tomorrow to exchange for more currencies.
00:03:34.158 - 00:03:59.446, Speaker B: But in a deflationary economy, it is possible that the next day when you sell it, because it takes time for you to create the cake, the currency itself already rise in value. And the amount of currency you can exchange for is even less than the ingredients you paid, which make it doesn't make sense for people to do any long term investment or production.
00:03:59.478 - 00:04:02.086, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, you cannot take a loan to buy this ingredients.
00:04:02.118 - 00:05:07.102, Speaker B: If you cannot do better to just hold your currency. Just sleep huddleing. Yeah. And also, basically, if you look at any financial assets on ethereum, for example, because of this issue, over the long run, you will see your financial products, or like financial assets drop in value in term of ethereum. So when the buyers see these kind of issues, why would they hold your financial products? Right? I mean, why not just hold the platform currency? So in that case, you are essentially competing with your own ecosystem. So that's a thing we would like to change. But in order to create something like that, we need to basically create a model that fundamentally link the cryptocurrency creation with physical values in the physical world.
00:05:07.102 - 00:05:36.870, Speaker B: So basically you can imagine like, we have two world, right? So we have the physical world and we have the crypto world. So basically, physical world export, like computing and electricity to the crypto world. And the crypto world export financial products, basically cryptocurrencies.
00:05:39.610 - 00:05:41.398, Speaker A: Yeah. It doesn't export.
00:05:41.494 - 00:06:49.870, Speaker B: Crypto exchanges value interacting between two economies. And there's a famous theorem in international finance called impossible trinity. Basically, like, there's a fixed exchange rate, there's a free flow of capital, and there's independent monetary policy. These three things cannot coexist at the same time. So, for example, there are a couple of projects creating stable coins, right? The makers, yeah, basically meta stable. Like Haseeb, right? He had a pretty famous article that categorized the stable coins into three categories. Three categories.
00:06:49.870 - 00:07:36.810, Speaker B: There's a crypto back, there is a fiat back, and there's another one, you probably call it growth back. Basically, this is an algorithm based stable points. So basically, we feel there are centralization issues in all of these approaches. So, for example, first, for all the growth backed cryptocurrency, like stable coins, we don't feel any of them are valid so far. So we can ignore this case. And basically for the other two approaches.
00:07:36.970 - 00:07:41.130, Speaker A: Like fiat bank, somebody sits on the bank.
00:07:41.210 - 00:08:38.690, Speaker B: Someone had to sit on the bank. For the crypto backed, actually, although they seem to be like decentralized. But there is a centralized oracle in there, and the oracle is actually one of the single point of failure in the system. So there's a project called Synex, right? So just like last week, because one of the round data feeds in their oracle, they created like 37 million synthetic ethereum, which translates to $7 billion in paper value. So you can see if you build a financial system on top of certain data feed, there's a potential risk in the system. And although for example, even your oracle system is designed very strong, very robust, but still the data feed itself, there may be centralization issues and also maybe like failure issues as well.
00:08:38.840 - 00:08:47.350, Speaker A: Do you think it's possible to build for specifically price feeds to build a decentralized oracle or like game theoretically balanced oracle?
00:08:47.930 - 00:09:32.130, Speaker B: It's difficult because the incentive doesn't match. So for example, the asset running on a platform may be in hundreds of millions or billions, but the incentive typically provides in oracle system. Think about an oracle system's market cap, right? So it may be very disproportionate to the value it carries on the system and also because the data feed has to be on all the time in order for the system to function properly. So that's a very challenging problem because, for example, none of the software, we can guarantee 100% availability reliability. Right. Even the software is reliable. The hardware may have issues.
00:09:32.130 - 00:10:21.170, Speaker B: So if a public chain run into this issue, maybe it will just stop processing transactions for a couple of hours or something. But if a data feed is wrong, it could potentially collapse the entire system. So fundamentally, we feel these type of approach is more like enterprise software level security, not store value level security. But let's talk about store value level security, how this can be done, right? So basically, just now we mentioned the impossible trinity, basically based on this, in order to have a fixed exchange with fiat currency, there's only two ways to do it. One is you have the chinese approach. You do not allow free flow of capital, which no one likes. Right.
00:10:21.170 - 00:10:59.162, Speaker B: Or you have the Hong Kong approach. Basically they have 100% reserve in the fiat currency they pack to in a single pool managed by an organization. Yeah. And they give up their own monetary policy. So in that case they can keep the pack. But fundamentally these are all like centralized approach. Right? So how do we solve this in a decentralized environment? So the approach meter is taking is instead of trying to pack with any fiat currency, we give up on this edge and take the other two edges.
00:10:59.162 - 00:12:03.330, Speaker B: So basically we are trying to create basically, essentially a new currency that's native in the crypto world. But fundamentally it's impossible to cheat and economically it's stable. So how it works is basically just now we talk about this two worlds, right? If you look at the two roles, the only link between them is the computing and the electricity, which is in the proof of work world, means proof of work mining. So if you look at the economics from the miners, so basically they have the block reward, they have the transaction fees. So all of these are virtual. And on the cost side they have capex and opex. So in a highly competitive environment, like proof of work mining, at the end of day only opex matters.
00:12:03.330 - 00:12:48.290, Speaker B: So basically that's electricity costs, essentially. So for them, basically you can see all the bitcoin miners always chasing the lowest electricity price and lowest taxes. Yeah, obviously to lower their opecs, essentially. So what we do differently from bitcoin is bitcoin, because the supply is set fixed. So the only response bitcoin can have to the supply and demand is basically the price. Like basically the price changes based on supply and demand. So what we are doing is we have a fixed production cost in the system.
00:12:48.290 - 00:13:06.722, Speaker B: So in order to create 1 meter, so the cost of production for proof of work mining is always around ten kilowatt hour of electricity. So basically when we set like a fixed production cost, the response is essentially the quantity of the token.
00:13:06.786 - 00:13:09.686, Speaker A: So the higher the hash power, the more block.
00:13:09.798 - 00:14:06.250, Speaker B: Exactly. So basically from the miners perspective, they will only create the coin when it economically makes sense for them, which means there is enough margin for them to do the proof of work mining. And that profit chasing behavior will naturally create a feedback to the system, essentially creates a disciplined monetary policy in the system. So basically over the long run, it will settle at basically, essentially packed to the competitive price of electricity. And we actually have data like showing this. Basically, if you look at the competitive price of electricity, we have data like this. So this is from 1960s, let's say this, 2010.
00:14:06.250 - 00:14:21.630, Speaker B: So basically this is the measure by us dollar. And this line is basically the real price, which means adjusted for inflation.
00:14:22.050 - 00:14:26.174, Speaker A: So basically over this period, the price was relatively stable.
00:14:26.222 - 00:14:31.426, Speaker B: The purchasing power of electricity is actually more stable than any fiat currencies in the world.
00:14:31.608 - 00:14:33.490, Speaker A: This is stable across the world.
00:14:33.640 - 00:15:22.990, Speaker B: Basically this is a competitive price of electricity, like the global competition. And actually if you look at the electricity price across the globe, actually us is one of the lowest country in the world. So that's on a high level how we create that unit of account. But once you do this, that involves some changes in the consensus. Because when you design the economics and games like this, the hashing power in the system is no longer going to be stable. So you cannot protect the system just through the hashing power itself. So basically that's what we do in our consensus innovation.
00:15:23.070 - 00:15:30.662, Speaker A: Yeah. So before we go to consensus, just for me to understand. Right. So let's say you have, you said ten kilowatt, right?
00:15:30.716 - 00:15:31.030, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:15:31.100 - 00:15:32.390, Speaker A: Is 1 meter.
00:15:35.290 - 00:15:41.222, Speaker B: And we planning to use bitcoin's mining algorithm when we launch.
00:15:41.366 - 00:15:46.602, Speaker A: So it's like pretty clear known electricity to.
00:15:46.656 - 00:16:01.438, Speaker B: And there's always opportunity costs for the miners. So even you got free electricity, you always have to look at whether I should mine bitcoin or mine meter. You will only do it when it economically makes sense to you.
00:16:01.604 - 00:16:12.962, Speaker A: But let's just discuss an edge case. Right. Let's say the price of meter goes below competitive price of ten kilowatt, right?
00:16:13.016 - 00:16:13.186, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:16:13.208 - 00:16:15.220, Speaker A: So let's say this is right now.
00:16:16.010 - 00:16:48.142, Speaker B: So actually the way to look at it is because there need to be enough margin for the bitcoin miners. So the price where it settles at, we believe is going to be one to $2 range for this. Because even, for example, it's six cents for the competitive electricity price, which translates to. But for a normal operation, for there to be enough margins for the miners, you will see the price settles between.
00:16:48.196 - 00:16:51.550, Speaker A: One to $2 just because they want the margin.
00:16:51.890 - 00:16:54.430, Speaker B: Otherwise they won't be sustainable.
00:16:55.330 - 00:16:59.860, Speaker A: But, yeah, just for me to understand. So let's say price of meter goes below for whatever reason.
00:17:00.790 - 00:17:02.114, Speaker B: How does it recover? Right?
00:17:02.152 - 00:17:02.926, Speaker A: Yeah. How does it recover?
00:17:02.958 - 00:17:10.914, Speaker B: Because we have another economy design to basically consistently, like removing currency from circulation.
00:17:10.962 - 00:17:11.430, Speaker A: I see.
00:17:11.500 - 00:17:11.782, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:17:11.836 - 00:17:12.440, Speaker A: Okay.
00:17:12.970 - 00:17:16.150, Speaker B: Which are related to the consensus and token model.
00:17:16.220 - 00:17:17.910, Speaker A: Then let's go to consensus.
00:17:19.070 - 00:18:06.914, Speaker B: So basically, if you look at all the existing cryptocurrencies, you notice one interesting thing. People are mixing currency creation with record keeping, which is perfect when Satoshi designed this. Because when you first design a game like this, you need to make it simple and you need to have involved party as little as possible. But when the system got mature, you'll notice this is actually completely two different consensus. I mean, the record keeping and currency creation. Basically record keeping, what you're trying to provide prevent is the double spending part. So that is actually directly observable to all the participants in the network.
00:18:06.914 - 00:18:37.226, Speaker B: You just need to make sure the information are thoroughly propagated. So that doesn't require a lot of energy. But there's another consensus, which is the economic consensus. That's how much the newly created coins are worth, how much new value has been added to the system. That is implicit. And obviously that requires a lot more energy to reach that consensus. So basically in a proof of work system, it's the miners that reaching that consensus.
00:18:37.226 - 00:19:24.830, Speaker B: But in a proof of stake system, people only care about the first record keeping consensus. There's not much consensus on the economic part. So typically people just say we have certain inflation rate, and if you participate in staking, you will not be diluted. If you don't, then you will get diluted in the system, right? So that's a proof of stake. So in meter, basically we separate out the two consensus explicitly. So we use a proof of work for currency creation, for notion of time, and one of the source for randomness. And the record keeping is done by basically proof of stake.
00:19:24.830 - 00:20:07.890, Speaker B: And we have two tokens as well, the proof of stake token, we call it governance token. So basically you have to stake that to participate in the proof of stake record keeping process. So in our system we have a hybrid chain approach. So, so this is, let's say this is a proof of stake chain. So actually all the transaction records are kept here and then we have like a proof of work chain.
00:20:07.970 - 00:20:10.114, Speaker A: So you kind of checkpoint the proof of stake chain.
00:20:10.162 - 00:21:10.034, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. Basically here for example, on the proof of stake side, this is three to 5 seconds per block here, this is like 1 minute on average. So basically periodically these keyframes, this is one epoch, right? They will merge with each other and cross reference each other, put the merkel rows on each other. But basically all the proof of work chain, there's no transaction record down there, there's just basically solutions for the puzzle. And the difficulty. Basically you calculate a bunch of solutions to the puzzle and at the end of the epoch you submit it to the proof of stake site competitively, basically trying to claim the rewards for this chain. And basically proof of stake site will look at which chain is longer.
00:21:10.034 - 00:22:16.790, Speaker B: So basically we have a certain threshold. Let's say each epoch target is like 60 minutes, right? So let's say 60 minutes. And each proof of work block on average is 1 minute. So whenever it's greater than 60 here, the proof of stake side knows this epoch is finishing and we need to basically change to the next epoch. So at this stage, basically all the proof of stake validators will look at which chain is longer and vote for the longest chain and use the nouns on the longest chain as one of the seed for selecting the next validators. Yeah, so basically on the proof of stake side, we run hot stuff and we're targeting to have probably more than 50 to about 100 validators in the committee. And the pool can be much bigger because we can randomly pick from the pool for the committee.
00:22:18.090 - 00:22:20.280, Speaker A: But in theory you can have.
00:22:22.090 - 00:22:27.370, Speaker B: A lot of forks, for example. Yeah, but whoever is the longest will win the race.
00:22:28.190 - 00:22:35.814, Speaker A: But this is pretty fast. Right. So this may not propagate in time even if I have the longest fork.
00:22:35.942 - 00:23:10.450, Speaker B: Yeah. So whoever gets the approval on the proof of stake side, basically the proposer on the proof of stake side will just say, hey, this is the longest chain. I see. Do you guys agree? And if I got more than two third people voting on this is the longest chain they see, then basically this chain is chosen. And if you couldn't reach an agreement, we move to the next proof of stake proposal. We're actually changing the leader for every block to prevent.
00:23:10.610 - 00:23:14.460, Speaker A: Would you switch to next block or would you just do a view state change?
00:23:14.830 - 00:23:21.818, Speaker B: It's like, because Haslav view change is relatively cheap. So basically it's more like a view change.
00:23:21.904 - 00:23:22.202, Speaker A: Okay.
00:23:22.256 - 00:23:22.860, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:23:25.470 - 00:23:33.246, Speaker A: The obvious thing, as one of the miners, I should just dedo all the other miners so they not be able to send the.
00:23:33.428 - 00:24:32.670, Speaker B: So basically, actually the way we're looking at is in the future these will be mostly run by mining pools as well. So mining pools all have the DDoS mechanism, because mining pools recently have a lot of things they are looking for as well. For example, there's a hidden block attack that they are really concerned, but they couldn't solve the problem without protocol level support. We're going to support that to be more friendly to the mining pools. But you can also have your own pool mining as well. And also on the proof of stake side, all of the validator will be listening to the POW network as well. So basically they're running sort of like a full node on the PoW space.
00:24:32.820 - 00:24:50.966, Speaker A: Yeah, just my main point is, let's say there's a bunch of proof of stake validators. If some of them are inside one pool, this pool will be preferred just because they'll get the info faster, like they produce the block in the first place. So they'll just propagate. And this is, you said this is 3 seconds, right?
00:24:51.068 - 00:24:51.526, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:24:51.628 - 00:24:56.950, Speaker A: So how long is your, this is 1 minute. Yeah. So what is the propagation time for blocks?
00:24:57.110 - 00:24:59.046, Speaker B: Because everything is empty block.
00:24:59.158 - 00:25:00.058, Speaker A: It's pretty fast.
00:25:00.144 - 00:25:03.482, Speaker B: Yeah, it's very minimal, the propagation time.
00:25:03.536 - 00:25:06.460, Speaker A: How does proof of stake validators get rewarded then?
00:25:08.610 - 00:26:30.390, Speaker B: That's how the two token system works. Basically we have on chain auctions for the governance token. So basically, let's say today I have three governance token. The governance token is the proof of stake token, right? Like released. So basically, in order to compete for the three tokens, people have to bid with the currency token. Let's say I put in like five currency token for competing for this governance token, right? So after I win the reward, I mean after I win the governance token, this basically five currency token belongs to the system now, right? So basically what we do is a portion of them will be distributed into like a reserve. Let's say this too goes to a reserve pool and then goes back to all the proof of stake validators as a reward, as block reward, gradually release block by block basis, and then a portion of them will be, we have something called stability fund.
00:26:30.390 - 00:26:43.050, Speaker B: We put into that fund. It's also a reserve system and the rest will be burned. So basically the burning will create continuous effect on removing currency from circulation.
00:26:44.830 - 00:26:53.114, Speaker A: But why would they compete for this? Basically, why would they participate in auction?
00:26:53.242 - 00:27:23.030, Speaker B: Basically, that's the governance, right? And the record keeping right of the system. So think about like, this is the banking system of the entire financial system, right? This basically represents the governance rights in the banking system. And this token can actually extract values from the system, for example, from transaction fees, from state storage, and also from, for example, the daily auctions.
00:27:24.570 - 00:27:29.946, Speaker A: Okay, so this new tokens are generated per ebook. This is like an inflation of, this.
00:27:29.968 - 00:27:32.186, Speaker B: Is probably more like a day or.
00:27:32.208 - 00:27:35.642, Speaker A: Like a week, less frequent for some period of time.
00:27:35.696 - 00:27:35.962, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:27:36.016 - 00:27:42.878, Speaker A: So this is just inflates governance token. So all the stakers get inflated by this amount, right?
00:27:42.964 - 00:27:43.886, Speaker B: Yeah, that's right.
00:27:43.988 - 00:27:48.494, Speaker A: And then they are obligated to participate in auction?
00:27:48.542 - 00:28:13.260, Speaker B: No, you are not obligated to participate. Whoever wants the governance token. And this one is basically like a fixed supply curve. So you can imagine the governance token is the bitcoin and the currency token is the energy. It requires the energy that you burned when you mine the bitcoin. And we use that as a unit of measurement in the system.
00:28:16.120 - 00:28:27.936, Speaker A: All right. Yeah, I'm just trying to think what is the use cases as one of those validators, what is my goals here? So if I have more governance tokens.
00:28:27.968 - 00:28:30.292, Speaker B: Right, you will be earning more of these fees?
00:28:30.436 - 00:28:41.860, Speaker A: I will be earning more fees? Like I'll have more seats in the hot stuff consensus or how does it work, basically? So you have like 100, let's say, validators?
00:28:41.940 - 00:28:42.730, Speaker B: Let's say.
00:28:44.780 - 00:28:53.096, Speaker A: Yeah. So I am like one of those guys who has more staking. Will I get more reward from more transaction fees from this block?
00:28:53.208 - 00:28:56.896, Speaker B: No, if you are not in 100, you won't even get transaction fees but.
00:28:56.918 - 00:28:58.624, Speaker A: If I am in 100.
00:28:58.822 - 00:28:59.570, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:29:00.100 - 00:29:01.504, Speaker A: The more I stake, the more I get.
00:29:01.542 - 00:29:01.840, Speaker B: Right.
00:29:01.910 - 00:29:03.392, Speaker A: And it's proportional to the sum.
00:29:03.456 - 00:29:24.184, Speaker B: Basically what we do is because now we have a unit of account in the system, we actually know how much you need to have to cover your basis. For example, each validator, they need to spend probably like $10,000 per year to maintain their machines, things like that, right?
00:29:24.222 - 00:29:24.616, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:29:24.718 - 00:29:36.380, Speaker B: So basically we can say first you will get this 10,000 meters, and then anything above that will be distributed proportionally.
00:29:37.360 - 00:29:42.236, Speaker A: Okay. So you have some minimal.
00:29:42.348 - 00:29:46.332, Speaker B: Yeah. So basically to cover your basic expense.
00:29:46.396 - 00:29:48.690, Speaker A: So where is that meter coming from?
00:29:50.740 - 00:30:07.032, Speaker B: For example, initially, let's say there's very little transactions, right. So the transaction fee is sort of, let's say zero. Yeah. Then it's coming from the daily auction. I mean, not daily auction, but time interval of the auction, when I sell the governance token. Yeah.
00:30:07.086 - 00:30:11.432, Speaker A: So you sell, let's say sell x governance token, right?
00:30:11.486 - 00:30:12.090, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:30:12.940 - 00:30:18.812, Speaker A: People bid on it. I'm assuming that only top bid is being taken.
00:30:18.866 - 00:30:19.564, Speaker B: No.
00:30:19.762 - 00:30:21.788, Speaker A: Or is it just pretty much basically.
00:30:21.874 - 00:30:34.252, Speaker B: Like all the bids received on that day get the same price? Let's say, for example, you have like three governance tokens, right? Today you collected five meter tokens.
00:30:34.316 - 00:30:34.688, Speaker A: Okay.
00:30:34.774 - 00:30:38.290, Speaker B: So each one clears at three over five. Yeah.
00:30:40.020 - 00:30:41.772, Speaker A: This is like a dutch auction.
00:30:41.836 - 00:30:43.664, Speaker B: Yeah, single price auction.
00:30:43.792 - 00:31:00.170, Speaker A: Okay, so you collect this meter tokens out of it. So it's possible that you'll get less just because right now people also don't value governance tokens. Right.
00:31:00.780 - 00:31:18.028, Speaker B: But basically because the staking token also maintaining the records. Right. And also have a fixed supply. So this is more like a store of value token in the system.
00:31:18.194 - 00:31:23.072, Speaker A: Wait, when you're saying fixed supply. So the curve of governance token is like this. It'll be less and less.
00:31:23.126 - 00:31:27.532, Speaker B: Yeah, you can imagine it's more like the total reserve will be fixed.
00:31:27.596 - 00:31:27.872, Speaker A: Okay.
00:31:27.926 - 00:32:11.170, Speaker B: Yeah. Or you can think about it. This is a small country, right? Yeah. The country has its own basic currency. In order to encourage people to immigrate to this country, we auction out the parliament seats and to basically create the initial demand for user, for people to want to immigrate. And then as more and more people immigrate to the country, there will be more and more business running in the country, the economy will be growing, then the percentage of the auction of the parliament seats will become less and less and less important in the system.
00:32:12.420 - 00:32:16.476, Speaker A: Well, is there any other value of governance token except staking?
00:32:16.588 - 00:32:42.360, Speaker B: Yeah. So basically there is also state storage. For example, in any smart contract system, you need to have a storage space for the states. Right. So basically in order to basically, let's say create a smart contract, you actually need to have some governance token to basically secure that storage.
00:32:42.860 - 00:32:46.964, Speaker A: So do you use rent or do you lock some of the governance token?
00:32:47.092 - 00:32:51.710, Speaker B: Basically we're syncing to more user, like a rent type of model. Yeah.
00:32:52.480 - 00:32:57.020, Speaker A: So then you just need to have some current stock on account and it gets deducted over time.
00:32:57.090 - 00:32:57.710, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:33:00.000 - 00:33:05.680, Speaker A: And how would you value that? Because that sounds something that I should be paying in meter.
00:33:06.100 - 00:33:26.036, Speaker B: Yeah. So basically that is still being worked out. So we want to either, for example, you have to maintain enough governance token or you have to also sort of bidding on that for the rent. So it's more like the Ram in eos.
00:33:26.228 - 00:34:00.640, Speaker A: Yeah, I see the part I'm trying to figure out, which probably requires a little bit more involved, but how much? Because you actually have this pretty interesting connectivity between meter tokens, governance tokens, issuance. Like how much new meter tokens get issued presumably. Okay, let's say, let's work with this example. So meter price is under whatever is this ten kilowatt price.
00:34:00.710 - 00:34:06.710, Speaker B: Yeah. So because this burning effect continuously remove things from the system.
00:34:07.960 - 00:34:19.272, Speaker A: But the question I have is mostly around how much of this you burn, right. It actually depends on how much the price difference is. It should depend.
00:34:19.326 - 00:34:22.664, Speaker B: So basically like assuming for example, right now the price drops, right?
00:34:22.702 - 00:34:23.096, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:34:23.198 - 00:34:29.208, Speaker B: There is not many people mining, so the production is minimum or negligible.
00:34:29.304 - 00:34:29.708, Speaker A: Yes.
00:34:29.794 - 00:34:37.624, Speaker B: And then this thing will keep on removing currency from circulation. So you have certainty that the liquidity.
00:34:37.672 - 00:34:50.320, Speaker A: Goes down, but for that the people need to actually, because if everybody thinks that, right. Oh, liquidity goes down, meter token will go up. Why would they go bad on governance token instead of hodling meter token? Because the price will go up.
00:34:50.390 - 00:34:52.048, Speaker B: Another mechanism in the system.
00:34:52.134 - 00:34:52.480, Speaker A: Okay.
00:34:52.550 - 00:35:20.830, Speaker B: Yeah. So we have a stability fund. So this is more like the net asset of the Dao. So basically when price is high you can borrow from that stability fund and when the price is low you can basically buy it back and basically pay back the loan you borrowed from that fund.
00:35:21.920 - 00:35:23.260, Speaker A: Who are you in this case?
00:35:23.330 - 00:35:24.952, Speaker B: Basically the governance token holders.
00:35:25.016 - 00:35:28.872, Speaker A: Governance token holders. Do they use governance token as a collateral?
00:35:29.016 - 00:35:35.068, Speaker B: Yeah. So basically you have to lock your governance token in order to get that loan.
00:35:35.164 - 00:35:37.728, Speaker A: So what's the price for that? Or what's the.
00:35:37.814 - 00:35:40.352, Speaker B: Basically it's a parada base.
00:35:40.486 - 00:35:47.328, Speaker A: No. So let's say I have one governance token. There's a stability fee of 100 meters. How much can I borrow?
00:35:47.424 - 00:35:59.880, Speaker B: Let's say the system have 50 governance token in circulation in total. So each one will basically represents like two meter you can borrow from the system.
00:36:00.030 - 00:36:00.632, Speaker A: I see.
00:36:00.686 - 00:36:01.240, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:36:01.390 - 00:36:08.420, Speaker A: So the stability fee is pretty much like kind of a back reserve of the governance token.
00:36:08.500 - 00:36:20.480, Speaker B: Yeah. And also this is basically the net asset on the balance sheet. So the token actually have support in term of the lowest value channel.
00:36:20.550 - 00:36:29.392, Speaker A: Yeah, that's interesting. Over time goes down because overtime will.
00:36:29.446 - 00:36:37.590, Speaker B: Accumulate because this is just keep adding basically funds into the system.
00:36:40.840 - 00:37:02.904, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah. So this will add funds in the system if right now, people, because you're exchanging meter token for governance right here, you're exchanging governance token for meter. W thing is like, buy some governance token, take out some meter, buy more governance token.
00:37:02.952 - 00:37:14.930, Speaker B: Yeah. If you want to leverage, you can do that. But basically here you need to lock up your governance token and also you lose your opportunity to participate in the record keeping. Yeah.
00:37:15.620 - 00:37:17.984, Speaker A: All right. So then going back, you will only.
00:37:18.022 - 00:37:22.836, Speaker B: Do this when it will be profitable for you. So that means when the price is.
00:37:22.858 - 00:37:26.224, Speaker A: High, when the price of the meter.
00:37:26.272 - 00:37:28.710, Speaker B: You can sell it at the high price on the market.
00:37:31.240 - 00:37:43.450, Speaker A: Yes. All right. If the meter price is low now, you need to return.
00:37:43.980 - 00:37:51.884, Speaker B: Otherwise you will just lose your governance token. And the governance token will be permanent. I mean, just will be kept unlocked, removed from circulation. Right.
00:37:52.082 - 00:37:53.864, Speaker A: Well, why would you lose your governance token?
00:37:53.912 - 00:37:58.700, Speaker B: No, basically it will be locked until basically you pay back the loan.
00:37:59.360 - 00:38:04.770, Speaker A: Yeah. No, you said if meter token price is down, right.
00:38:05.940 - 00:38:11.360, Speaker B: This is a good opportunity for you to buy it back and pay back the loan, right?
00:38:11.510 - 00:38:28.264, Speaker A: Sure. Buy back. No, but if you think that the price will go up. Right. Why would you do that? Because shouldn't you hold two meter token? Because the whole point is that basically.
00:38:28.382 - 00:38:36.008, Speaker B: For example, you know, the stabilizing, there's certain stabilizing point, equilibrium point. Right.
00:38:36.094 - 00:38:38.072, Speaker A: So if you think you're below right now.
00:38:38.126 - 00:38:48.236, Speaker B: Yeah, if you're below right now, it's perfect time for you to buy because basically, you know, the system will eventually go back. Sure. Yeah. When it's high is for you.
00:38:48.418 - 00:39:07.190, Speaker A: But that's what I'm saying. So if everybody wants to buy meter token. So nobody wants to buy governance token right now. Nobody wants to get their loan back. Everybody just holds their meter. Like there's no meter being burned. Right?
00:39:08.120 - 00:39:08.948, Speaker B: Say it again.
00:39:09.034 - 00:39:15.860, Speaker A: So if meter price is down, it's down, right?
00:39:15.930 - 00:39:16.550, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:39:17.480 - 00:39:32.300, Speaker A: So let's assume we have, like, a bunch of people who have loans in this thing. So they have governance tokens, they have meter right now, they will think that price will go up, right?
00:39:32.450 - 00:39:44.908, Speaker B: Yeah. So basically because the meter you can borrow only represents a fraction of the value of the governance token, right. So unless you want to completely give up your governance token, which essentially. But you move it from circulation, you're.
00:39:44.924 - 00:39:47.952, Speaker A: Not giving up when you lock it.
00:39:48.086 - 00:39:51.088, Speaker B: That means it's removed from circulation. Sure.
00:39:51.174 - 00:39:54.176, Speaker A: Yeah, but you can always buy it back later, right?
00:39:54.198 - 00:39:57.076, Speaker B: Yeah. So that means eventually, I mean, really.
00:39:57.098 - 00:40:04.390, Speaker A: You'Re just selling it. That's what happens. You're selling it to the stability fund and you can buy it back at the same amount of.
00:40:06.140 - 00:40:10.680, Speaker B: Yeah, but you can only basically selling it up to the amount.
00:40:10.830 - 00:40:20.280, Speaker A: Yeah. So the price is like pretty much. You pretty much have the price set fixed between meter and governance.
00:40:20.440 - 00:40:21.880, Speaker B: No, it's not fixed.
00:40:22.040 - 00:40:27.004, Speaker A: Well, it's whatever. Like one over total supply. No.
00:40:27.202 - 00:40:28.984, Speaker B: What do you mean by one over total supply?
00:40:29.032 - 00:40:32.568, Speaker A: Sorry, the number of meter instability fee.
00:40:32.744 - 00:40:50.308, Speaker B: No, this is just a net asset value. Net asset. So let's think about like a company, right? Yeah. A company have cash on its balance sheet. Sure. But the value of the company is the net asset value plus the future cash flow, discounted cash flow of the company. Right.
00:40:50.308 - 00:40:56.330, Speaker B: So the governance token value is higher than net asset value.
00:40:57.100 - 00:41:12.510, Speaker A: Yeah, but here, I'm just saying this mechanics sets a price between governance and meter. Because I can sell my governance, get some meter, and I can pay meter and get back governance token. Right.
00:41:12.880 - 00:41:13.870, Speaker B: Say it again.
00:41:15.520 - 00:41:17.852, Speaker A: So you have the stability fund, right?
00:41:17.906 - 00:41:18.268, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:41:18.354 - 00:41:23.640, Speaker A: So I can take my one gov, right. Pay it and get some number of meter token.
00:41:23.720 - 00:41:27.056, Speaker B: Yeah, but this is just lock. This is not. You are selling it.
00:41:27.078 - 00:41:37.364, Speaker A: Yeah, but I need to return the same number of meter, right, and get back one governance. Yeah, I mean, we can consider that if nothing else happens with my, like, if I cannot lose it for any other reason.
00:41:37.402 - 00:42:01.420, Speaker B: So let's say, for example, right now on the auction, this one clears at, let's say, six meter. The amount you can borrow from the stability fund is, let's say like two meter. So why would you give up this value? It's not basically selling it, you're just collateralizing. And it's over collateralized.
00:42:02.160 - 00:42:08.492, Speaker A: But nobody else can get my one gov token out of it, right?
00:42:08.546 - 00:42:12.780, Speaker B: No, only you can claim it back. You cannot trade it, use it.
00:42:12.930 - 00:42:15.856, Speaker A: Yeah, you're collateralizing it and getting part of it.
00:42:15.878 - 00:42:16.770, Speaker B: Okay. Yeah.
00:42:18.580 - 00:42:25.684, Speaker A: Cool. Yeah, I'll need to think about more. I mean, two token systems are hard because there's like a lot of.
00:42:25.722 - 00:42:37.610, Speaker B: But basically if you think about this is like for example, if everyone wants to move out of the country, that's just like any countries, right?
00:42:38.780 - 00:42:46.728, Speaker A: Yeah. If nobody cares, the price goes down. That's kind of thing. I mean, the question is, you have some.
00:42:46.894 - 00:43:11.170, Speaker B: So basically what it does is this, create a Nash equilibrium in the system as long as, let's say, for example, if just you and me believe in the system, then just exchange between us will need to be created. If there are more people believe in the system, more will be created. But if just two of us, only the needed supply will be created. Yeah.
00:43:14.740 - 00:43:15.970, Speaker A: All right, cool.
00:43:17.940 - 00:43:22.464, Speaker B: Yeah. That's on a high level, how the system works. Yeah.
00:43:22.662 - 00:43:34.280, Speaker A: All right. Yeah, all cool. All right, cool. Thanks a lot for explaining. It's really interesting. I think two talking systems are always interesting just because there's a lot of more mechanics going on.
00:43:34.430 - 00:43:35.130, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:43:36.300 - 00:43:45.210, Speaker A: Thanks a lot. Check out the meter IO. Meter IO. Yeah. For more information. All right, thank you. Thanks a lot.
00:43:45.210 - 00:43:49.590, Speaker A: Close.
