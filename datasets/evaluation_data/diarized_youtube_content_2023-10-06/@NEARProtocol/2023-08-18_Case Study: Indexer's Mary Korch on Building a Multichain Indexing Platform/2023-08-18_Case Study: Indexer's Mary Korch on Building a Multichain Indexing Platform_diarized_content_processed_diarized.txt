00:00:01.530 - 00:00:36.070, Speaker A: Hi, my name's Mary. I work for Indexer XYZ and Tradeport XYZ. We decided to build in Nier because of the developer ecosystem and a lot of the infrastructure that's being built. We build infrastructure to support developers and the data that they need. And so there's so many people working on cool applications inside the ecosystem. What's great is that there are a number, number of profile picture projects and crypto native projects. But in addition to that, there's a lot of real companies who are solving what I call like real world problems inside of near.
00:00:36.070 - 00:01:07.390, Speaker A: So if you're a web two company looking to build in web3 and specifically on near, we have done a lot of the hard work for you. You're going to need data from the blockchain and also some off chain data like metadata or ipfs. We actually have that all at your disposal. That makes it a lot easier to build your application. You can get to market a lot quicker. Everyone that we've met in the near ecosystem has been very friendly, which is incredible. Community is a really big part of web3 and the community in near, it's great.
00:01:07.390 - 00:01:16.150, Speaker A: Near is committed to helping developers and making it as easy as possible for more people to build applications, them innovate.
