00:00:00.330 - 00:00:21.470, Speaker A: So our next speaker is going to be Robert Zaremba, coming to us from Switzerland. He's going to be talking about redefining online trust with soul bound tokens. And as always, fun fact about Robert. He owns six racing bikes, and he said he only thinks about work when he's riding them sometimes. So please welcome Robert Zaremba.
00:00:28.250 - 00:01:10.942, Speaker B: Hello, everyone. So, I'm going to talk about humanity, about souls, and about how we can construct, how we can create new foundations for creating new social constructs. So let's go. So, I already got a little bit of intro, but from a technical perspective, I'm an architect at the NDC tech workgroup. I'm part of the contract standards work group. Yeah, I created few major standards like the fungible token standard, recently, the SBT standard, and also working on the multi fungible token standard. I'm also a researcher and developer at Cosmos, lecturing at University of Geneva.
00:01:10.942 - 00:01:52.330, Speaker B: And, yeah, my interest is in general socioeconomical protocols. So, guys, I guess you know it, and it's boring, right? It looks bored, but a lot of people care about it, for better or worse, makes lot of money. And if you miss it, then you may look like the woman on the left. If you didn't miss it, you feel like a boss. Those were about NFTs. And many people can think that the solbon token can be represented as an NFT. And this is what I want to talk about.
00:01:52.330 - 00:02:33.914, Speaker B: So, an SBT is a token, is non fungible, is non transferable. But about the. But I will talk later. And there is a bound. So, as, like, picture, if you want to draw it, you can think about it that those tokens can represent something. So, let's say if you worked a reward, a fact of your life, something that is really bound to you and describes you. So, Nft, in my definition, if I think about NFt, I think about a subject.
00:02:33.914 - 00:03:08.266, Speaker B: So, Nft can be a car, Nft can be an image. Nft can be a bottle of a wine. SBT, on the other hand, will define a subject. So it can be a certificate about me. It can be my identity, a reputation. It can represent a social right for governance or a membership. And from this abstract perspective, you can think that they don't compete between each other.
00:03:08.266 - 00:03:29.790, Speaker B: So SBT can describe NFT. If you think that NFT is a subject, and SBTs define a subject, then we can link them together. Works, not, doesn't work. Okay. And in year, we like to innovate. Okay? Correct. We innovated with the fungible tokens.
00:03:29.790 - 00:04:05.510, Speaker B: We did again with events, metatransactions. So the account model and the delegation actions, those are very interesting things. So definitely the concept of SBT come from the Ethereum, but it doesn't mean that we need to copy it. And we didn't. We did better. So if you want to have your digital identity and you want to think about it, that it will be this non transferable. But if you think about it from the NFT category.
00:04:05.510 - 00:04:19.310, Speaker B: Yes. Then you may look like this soul. Right. So you have a human, you have a subject and a soul. Yes. Which will describe it. People, for example.
00:04:19.380 - 00:04:19.614, Speaker A: Yes.
00:04:19.652 - 00:04:54.220, Speaker B: Like in the mountain will tell you. Yes. Tell me, what did you climb in the winter? I will tell you. How good are you? So tell me, what did you do? Tell me, what are your certificates? This is how it describes you. So can you transfer it? Can you transfer your abilities? Well, not really. Can you put the abilities to something which doesn't have a soul? Again, depending how do we model it? So our model here is really different. We'll go talk about it later.
00:04:54.220 - 00:05:32.680, Speaker B: We really define a soul as a set of abilities. So talking about that non transferability. Transferability, in fact, is very important. Like if you come from the, let's say, original Ethereum idea about the account model and the near account model. Yes. We have a clear separation between authorization level or authentication level, and an address and an identity. So as an identity, I should be able to have many authentication ways.
00:05:32.680 - 00:06:06.930, Speaker B: I should plug authentication. Same thing is for the transferability for the soul. If in a blockchain, we think about an account that can represent me. Right? And it will build up that soul, I should be able to somehow merge, migrate or recover the soul. If the account itself requires to be merged, recovered or renewed for whatever reason. Yes. For example, because it was compromised, your key is lost, and so on.
00:06:06.930 - 00:06:30.854, Speaker B: If you lose your passport. Yes. It doesn't know. That doesn't mean that your identity is lost. You are still there. So building up this protocol, we need to think about these problems and we need to solve them. And on the other hand, there are problems that can kick us back and be used by an attacker.
00:06:30.854 - 00:07:20.410, Speaker B: So there is a whole vector of a Sibyl attacks when this transfer ability could be used against the principle. So we don't want that these abilities will be traded. So let's say if you have your character in a game that you don't want, that ability of a character will be traded to another character or duplicated. So in there was, there was this whole ERC and also model about I forgot the name. But you have an NFT, and the NFT can host other NFts. I think a better way to model it would be, again, with this SBTs here. But we need to have economic model to prevent different actions, and at the same time have the recoverability and the null transferability.
00:07:20.410 - 00:07:49.090, Speaker B: So we cannot duplicate, we cannot overwrite. Body without the soul is dead. So, once you transfer something, the source account is blocked. So those are the economics model. We built in the SBT standard. So whenever you move the soul to another account. Yes, the source account will be blacklisted, blocked forever.
00:07:49.090 - 00:08:27.422, Speaker B: When the source account and a destination account already has an SBT, and there is a conflict between them, then you cannot do a transfer. So you cannot overwrite, of course, because the protocol doesn't understand which one is the more accurate one. However, every person can burn any of his SBTs. There is also, like, economical motivation why someone should burn his SBT. Well, if you don't want it, for whatever reason, even though the trace on the blockchain will be there. Of course. But you have a right.
00:08:27.422 - 00:09:05.322, Speaker B: Yes. How you want to, let's say, get rid of maybe some abilities. So those economical requirements draw us to these design choices. So when you think, again, with NFT, you have, like, each NFT will be a contract, and each that contract will have its own balance book. This doesn't work with the requirements we have now because of the transferability. So you want to be really atomic. I didn't mention it before, but the clear solution here is that when you transfer a soul, you need to transfer it completely.
00:09:05.322 - 00:09:40.146, Speaker B: You cannot take a part of soul from the account and then transfer it to account a and another part to account B. That's not how it should work. So all the operations must be atomic. And in the world, like we have in the blockchain, when there is a block limit, transaction limit, and when you have many abilities, this can go out of the way. So we had to do some more critical decisions in how this works. So we separated the balance book. There is only one balance book for all SBTs.
00:09:40.146 - 00:10:17.346, Speaker B: This is what we call a registry. Registry is more like a public good. So today, the IM human registry is still permissioned, meaning that if you want to issue tokens in the IMF human registry, you have to be whitelisted. This is not what we want in general, but we still keep it so far. So we have more abilities to adapt quicker without creating breaks with other protocols. We don't know. So at least we know if you want to.
00:10:17.346 - 00:11:06.290, Speaker B: Let's say break an API, change something we know with who we want to talk and get the feedback. So that call that decision worked. We got few breaking changes for a better that also draw like new extensions. I will talk about them soon. So the principle is that you have contracts which will represent the SBT, but the tokens will be recorded in that common registry and then you have a user, and then the user can talk about the issuer, the metadata about the issuer and the class directly to the issuer contracts of the SBT. But if they want to query tokens, then they query registry. So the flow is rather simple here.
00:11:06.290 - 00:12:05.402, Speaker B: Like once you understand that there is this difference between issuer, issuer contract and the registry, then if Alice wants to get the token, she may request it from issuer. So think about it that this is a DAO or a congress or someone from a class, from a group. So that issuer will mint a token by calling the issuer contract. The issuer contract will do a call to the registry requesting the balance book update. Registry emits the event so indexers can pop up and the information is, I mean, we assure the integrity of the information between the whole ecosystems and tools. The registry will return the token ID and that token ID is returned back to Alice. Classes.
00:12:05.402 - 00:13:11.158, Speaker B: So normally you can think that you have a token and then you have a token ID and that's it, right? Why classes? So one issuer may have different categories, different kinds of the tokens they want to create. So let's say an issuer is your university. A class can represent a year and a diploma, right? So let's say if you're a major in computer science, graduating 2010, and will be class one, graduating 2011, class two, if you are a major in history, yes, there will be another class. So you don't need to create a new issuer for every category of SBTs. It's often better to do it with classes. In our use case, for example with fractal, is that we have one issuer, fractal, and there is a class for a face verification. There is a class for KYC verification.
00:13:11.158 - 00:13:58.258, Speaker B: There could be a class for other verifications. Okay, so I mentioned about few extensions. So I hope now the concept of SBT and registry works now, but I am human is special because it's really targeted to provide more description related to proof of humanity, proof of personhood. So for example, you want to mint your token to an account, let's say a membership account. The token will represent a membership in a group and you only want to mint to an account which is already validated as a human. And if you want to do it automatically, we provide a function to that. So you don't need to do a check between an indexer or with a registry.
00:13:58.258 - 00:14:48.520, Speaker B: There is a shortcut to do it, of course, burn, like I mentioned, burn all. So a user can burn all of his tokens if he wants is human call. So if you remember in fungible tokens, yes, we have transfer call. So this is something similar. If I am a human, if I'm calling the contract as a human, the contract will authorize me and let the downstream contract know that it's called by a human by me, right? So again, it's kind of a shortcut. So it's very useful for all the protocols, like for example easypool pooling. Then you want to assure that a transaction is originated by a human.
00:14:48.520 - 00:15:47.606, Speaker B: If human call lock, it's a new extension we added two weeks ago, it allows you to lock for transferability. So the perfect example is voting body and a governance. When you vote, if there is a period of time you want to vote, let's say a week, and a common attack vector would be that, okay, I vote with one account and then I do a soul transfer. So I move my soul to another account, and now there is a new account, and I want to vote with that new account. The original idea, how we wanted to prevent that, was recording the proof of humanity. So the tokens, right, the sole tokens, which represents the humanity that created a lot of opacity, lot of implementation details that was going to the user, to the developer, to the user of the protocol, which was not necessary and buggy prone. So that's why we increment, we created that lock.
00:15:47.606 - 00:16:31.702, Speaker B: It's a user who is like locking, agreeing to lock his account, lock his soul in the account, to do an action which has a span in a time. So a governance is the perfect example. And there is this log duration, so let's say a protocol who is requesting that should set the lock duration. Like the minimum that is necessary is to prevent double vote, double spend and so on. So let's say if we are in the voting, the voting is seven days, but we are already in the fifth day of voting, then the lock duration should be set as five days. If there is already an existing lock longer than the one we request, then we always take the maximum. So we don't overwrite, we always take the maximum.
00:16:31.702 - 00:17:09.826, Speaker B: So if there is another protocol which depends on the lock, there won't be an issue or a collision. Between the data they want to acquire and queries. So you can check if an account is a human flagging. Flagging is, I would say, a feature that, yes, many people may dub about. So against extension, it's not part of the core protocol. We are still thinking what will be the next version, how we want to evolve with this design. But it's meant for a governance.
00:17:09.826 - 00:17:54.850, Speaker B: So, for example, the council of I am human can flag some other account that, let's say it violated some policies. Yes, and let's say, prevent him from participating in elections, in certain elections. So in voting body. We released voting body for NDC a week ago, the beginning of this week. Yes, there is Gov ban. The gov ban only bans a user or asks the ban to the user to not be able to participate in elections. He can vote, he can execute his human rights, but he cannot be an active participant of the execution body.
00:17:54.850 - 00:18:28.830, Speaker B: Of course, this is up to the users to see if they want to use it or not. Right? So if the NDCV two decides, okay, we don't want to care about those flux. If they choice, the flags are there, the commission has to manage. Those flags can be managed, in fact, by the voting body itself. But I think it's a tool that other protocols can build on. I'm a little bit out of time. I want to quickly talk about the digital society.
00:18:28.830 - 00:19:01.420, Speaker B: So the digital society, or Daiso, is like the reacher movement for pluralistic ecosystem, right? So there is like no one environment like today. You think that there is an environment by your neighborhood, country culture. With digital society, you have circles. You can be in many, many different circles. It's like a little bit like in real life. Yes. You have your work circle, you have your, let's say, family circle, hobby and so on.
00:19:01.420 - 00:19:57.850, Speaker B: Those can determine different social levels, different social interactions, different abilities you may want to do. And representing it with the Solband tokens is really a good idea, because our society is really not about the digital life, but the real life, and how we can link it together, how we can assure that there are protocols, basically to provide all these different features. I think it's very important. So there is this idea called sociocracy you can think about as a democracy 3.0. Basically, the main issue with the democracy is that it's not very efficient, right? Because it's large. If you want to make a decision in a big group of people, good luck. It's already very hard to do a referendum.
00:19:57.850 - 00:20:19.838, Speaker B: And on the other hand, if you have hierarchical. Sorry, I'm finishing. So if you have like a hierarchical decision making, the hierarchical governance system. Yes. Then many people will disagree with that. Right. Because it's top down rather than egalitarian.
00:20:19.838 - 00:21:09.440, Speaker B: So socracy is like this again, circles idea that we have consensus and we go beyond the consensus with unity, discussions, organizations, double linking. So the circles are not disconnected. There is always a linkage to common people who are between the circles to assure that there is quality flow, information flow, and so on. Okay, so that's the last. And I think we can make a photo of it and then look at it later. But the idea is really that we want to assure efficient flows between decision making people and social movements. Thank you.
00:21:09.440 - 00:21:14.240, Speaker B: Sorry.
