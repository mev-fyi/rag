00:00:00.490 - 00:01:04.486, Speaker A: In the last year, the decentralized finance industry has exploded with innovation and interest, and there is now more than $100 billion worth of digital assets held by popular DFI protocols like Uniswap, Ave, compound, and curve. But there's a problem. Most of these protocols operate on the Ethereum blockchain, which currently suffers from extreme congestion and exorbitantly high fees, posing major roadblock to further adoption. Aurora is near's answer to this problem. As an ultra efficient Ethereum virtual machine deployed on Nier protocol, Aurora provides a platform developers and users can use to operate their applications in a fully Ethereum compatible environment without compromise. Thanks to the Aurora engine, EVM developers can deploy their code on Aurora with zero changes, allowing them to benefit from Nier's speed, security and scalability while maintaining the original functionality of their applications. Aurora leverages the same underlying technology as near's rainbow bridge to enable seamless Ethereum to near asset transfers.
00:01:04.486 - 00:01:47.820, Speaker A: For the user, it means a safe, simple and affordable route into DeFi. On Ethereum, users interact with Aurora based applications just as if they were transacting on Ethereum, and all transactions are paid and denominated. In Ethereum, users can simply open up a familiar wallet interface like metamask or IM token to start using the apps on Aurora. Compared to native Ethereum, Aurora features up to a thousand times lower fees, massively increased throughput, and two second transaction finality, providing a future proof platform that can scale without limits. With a growing range of popular Ethereum projects set to support Aurora, it's just a matter of time until your favorite applications are powered by Nier's technology.
