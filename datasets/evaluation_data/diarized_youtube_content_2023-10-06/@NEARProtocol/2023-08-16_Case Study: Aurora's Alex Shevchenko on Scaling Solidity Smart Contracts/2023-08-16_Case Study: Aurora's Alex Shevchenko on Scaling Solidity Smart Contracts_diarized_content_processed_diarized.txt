00:00:01.450 - 00:00:47.398, Speaker A: Everybody. My name is Alex, I'm from Aurora Labs, the CEO of the company. We're a developer studio who is responsible for the development of the Aurora protocol. Aurora is a solution that allows to launch your solidity smart contracts on top of Nier. We are also adding something new, a scalability features of the Nier protocol, something that can make EVM future safe and make a destination of Aurora plus near a final one for businesses to come. Besides that, we are focusing on the user experience and we have a whole set of products that are helping blockchain businesses to make the experience of their users much more convenient. Why I initially came to Nier is obviously the best in class technology that is available on the near protocol.
00:00:47.398 - 00:01:38.900, Speaker A: No other solution right now is capable of solving the scalability issue of the blockchains and sharding approach with asynchronous runtime is exactly the way how to do this. Aurora works as a smart contract on top of Nier, which means that we are fully exposed to the Nier ecosystem and all of the set of the tools that are available there. Aurora is all about preserving the compatibility for all of the different smart contracts and enabling all blockchain developers to work on top of the near protocol. I do believe that Boss is something that will allow us to achieve the actually interconnected multi chain world that is going to be powered by the front ends that are stored on Nier blockchain. It is crisp. It clicks after just 5 seconds of explaining it. I'm super, super excited for it.
