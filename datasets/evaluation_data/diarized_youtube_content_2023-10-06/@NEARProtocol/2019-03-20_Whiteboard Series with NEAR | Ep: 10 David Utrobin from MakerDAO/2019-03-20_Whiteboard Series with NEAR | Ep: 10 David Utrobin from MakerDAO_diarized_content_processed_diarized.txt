00:00:02.970 - 00:00:10.378, Speaker A: Hi Amelia from Nier and with me, David from Makerdao, who will tell us more about how to keep stable.
00:00:10.474 - 00:00:22.874, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So if you guys aren't familiar with Maker, Makerdao is a decentralized credit facility. So the main product it creates is the dai. Right, those little triangles.
00:00:22.922 - 00:00:25.382, Speaker A: Actually, maybe before that. Do you want to tell about yourself a little bit?
00:00:25.436 - 00:00:44.310, Speaker B: Oh, actually sure. That's a very good. And this is a bad dice of millennial. So I'm David Utroben. I do community development at Makerdao. I do a lot of educational resources that I make available to the community. I help with the grants program that we're running and basically I'm a huge maker nerd.
00:00:44.310 - 00:01:20.082, Speaker B: So hello. And please bear in mind that I am not extremely technical, but I do understand the granular details of the system and I'll do my best to ping pong back and forth and give you guys, hopefully a better understanding of how our system works. Cool. So I think the best place to start is to understand that the main product maker currently creates is the DAi stablecoin. So dai is a soft peg stablecoin to the US dollar. And it's great because it is created and destroyed in a very novel way. So the main smart contract that maker created is called a CDP.
00:01:20.082 - 00:02:04.690, Speaker B: So it's called a collateralized debt position. You could think of this as a bank account, right? Like you could think of this as just a balance of a couple things. So the way that you interact with the CDP is you basically can mortgage your eth. So if you have Ethereum lying around, you could use it as collateral in the system. So let's say this is one point fifty cents of Ethereum. I'm going to use very low numbers to explain a couple of things. So if you lock a dollar and 50 of Ethereum, the maximum amount you can borrow against it is $1.
00:02:04.690 - 00:02:39.514, Speaker B: And this dollar is the die stablecoin that you get. Right. Sorry for drawing a really shitty die symbol, but it's okay. So the idea behind this, this is the maximum amount that you can get because there is a loan to value ratio of one to 1.5 at a minimum. So if you're familiar with maker, we call it a collateralization ratio. So this is actually 150% over collateralized.
00:02:39.514 - 00:03:24.478, Speaker B: So what this means is for every dollar that you borrow, you have at least a dollar 50 of collateral backing it. And what happens when this dollar 50 turns into a dollar and 49 is the system does something very special, so it actually seizes your collateral. Right. Like it takes it and it will take your debt, your one dollars of debt, and it will add to it a 13% liquidation penalty. So if you get liquidated, if you fall below the loan to value ratio, the system actually will charge you 13% on your debt. So it'll charge you a dollar plus thirteen cents. Right.
00:03:24.478 - 00:04:02.570, Speaker B: So it'll take your collateral and it will give it to the liquidity providing contract, which basically takes the price feed for Ethereum. And it takes your collateral and it basically makes a calculation on how much it needs to sell for this 3% discount to cover your loan and to cover the penalty. So I'm trying to be neat with the diagram here, but here, let me do it like this. So the liquidity providing contract, it interacts with the oracles.
00:04:04.110 - 00:04:05.946, Speaker A: It's more like oracles pushing into it.
00:04:05.968 - 00:04:35.602, Speaker B: Right, well, exactly. Well, the liquidity providing contract, it takes the ether. Right? Like it takes that collateral actually. Not an s, a little ethereum logo. Right. So it takes the ethereum and it makes a calculation so that it can basically sell enough to cover your dollar and excess collateral is left over. Maybe like 20 CDP holder gets it back.
00:04:35.602 - 00:04:43.366, Speaker B: So they get to actually keep this dollar and they get to keep whatever little bit of leftover collateral there is.
00:04:43.468 - 00:04:46.182, Speaker A: Is it in Ethereum that they get it?
00:04:46.316 - 00:05:22.980, Speaker B: Exactly. So they get to keep the dollar. Whatever they did with the dollar, whether it was buying more ethereum or transferring it to us dollars through sendwire or whatever it might be, they don't have to pay back the loan after they've been liquidated because they already did pay back the loan with their collateral because the system seized the collateral and made sure that recourse happened so that their loan never ever actually went insolvent. Yeah. So that's the very most basic thing that makerdao creates. It creates the system where you can lock up collateral and borrow against.
00:05:25.190 - 00:05:26.558, Speaker A: Yeah. So a few questions.
00:05:26.664 - 00:05:27.174, Speaker B: Sure.
00:05:27.292 - 00:05:34.326, Speaker A: So this contract, right, how does it know when to pretty much start liquidation process? Sure. Also takes the oracle information.
00:05:34.428 - 00:05:47.900, Speaker B: Absolutely. So do you mind if I erase this? Yeah. Cool. All right, so let's talk about oracles. So oracles are a lot of fun because I just wrote nice faq on them. So oracles. Right.
00:05:47.900 - 00:06:22.214, Speaker B: So for those of you that don't know what oracles are, oracles make off chain data available as inputs for smart contracts on chain and Makerdao because it will actually tell you how much dai you can generate. And it has to actually know the price of Ethereum in order to give you a loan. It needs price feeds. Right. So it needs the US dollar value of eTh. It also needs the US dollar value of MKR. And for our system those are the only two we focus on.
00:06:22.214 - 00:07:13.474, Speaker B: But maker actually does provide oracles for, I think poly for auger's rep and etc. But Makerdao did something really cool with oracles and they tried to solve the issue of manipulating the actual reference price. So imagine you have the Ethereum price and somebody reports that it's zero. That means every single cdp on Makerdao is going to get liquidated, right, because everybody's loan to value ratio is like fucked up. Can I excuse my language? Right? And likewise, if somebody takes the Ethereum oracle and misreports the price as 10,000, that means they can issue as much dai as they want. And unfortunately the DAI is not actually going to be backed by crypto collateral or any collateral. It's going to be fraudulently issued.
00:07:13.474 - 00:07:53.726, Speaker B: And that's a huge issue because that compromises the integrity of the peg. So how do maker dow oracles work? Well, make this a little bit better. Well for east, there's actually 14 different. 123456, no, seven, 8910 just to give a visualization, right. 3678 910 1112, 1314. So there is 14 different individuals for single collateral die. They actually chose several people from the Maker Foundation, a bunch of people from old school bitchairs community and et cetera, et cetera.
00:07:53.726 - 00:09:07.418, Speaker B: But the identities of these people are not actually known by the public and they're known by a very small handful of people, but they're mostly people that are trusted and are looking forward to the security of Makerdao. So what do each of these guys do? So let me take a breath. So each of these guys run a program called Setzer. And Setzer is basically a program that plugs into several different exchange APIs and pulls a certain price feed that you ask it. So each one of these people are pulling from multiple exchanges, right? And each one of them, if you look at just one of them, this guy, he's going to have a set of prices, right? Like he's going to have 121-121-5122 et cetera, et cetera, right? Each one of these are going to have a bunch of these sets of numbers and what they're going to report to the medianizer. So what they're going to report to the medianizer. So the medianizer is the main oracle, the main smart contract that actually publishes the reference price in the makerdal system.
00:09:07.418 - 00:09:17.790, Speaker B: So what they're going to do is they're going to take the median. Every single one of these 14 are going to take the median and they're going to push it to the medianizer.
00:09:18.210 - 00:09:21.214, Speaker A: Do they do like outlier removal kind of thing?
00:09:21.252 - 00:10:03.438, Speaker B: That's why it's a median and not a meet. So if it's a median and there's an exchange that let's say is reporting the price of either 500 as 500 or on the other side. Right, like they're reporting it as $0.01, those things are not going to matter. So the only time you could actually influence any individual price feed provider is if you can basically mess with either all the API exchange data or hack them and basically implant a false set of numbers. But the beauty is even if you corrupt one of them, you actually have to do a lot more to corrupt the medianizer. So the medianizer, sure.
00:10:03.524 - 00:10:07.358, Speaker A: Ask the question, is the exchanges known that provide this information?
00:10:07.524 - 00:10:19.314, Speaker B: Yes. So they vary in between maker provided setzer on their public GitHub repo. So anybody could run it and change what APIs they plug into.
00:10:19.432 - 00:10:20.500, Speaker A: But I mean.
00:10:22.230 - 00:10:23.374, Speaker B: There'S a lot of overlap.
00:10:23.422 - 00:10:28.946, Speaker A: Yeah. So pretty much if somebody goes and hacks one exchange or like few exchanges.
00:10:28.978 - 00:11:01.710, Speaker B: Few exchanges, yeah, absolutely. They can mess with that number of course. But the other advantage of having multiple feed providers go to the same API is because if the API is not hacked but instead it's the feed provider that's being hacked, you know that they're being hacked because everybody else is reporting a correct and consistent price. Exactly. So as I said, all these guys take the median and the medianizer. Guess what it takes? It takes the median of all the medians. So exactly.
00:11:01.710 - 00:11:53.230, Speaker B: You have a set of numbers, right? 1212-1122 doesn't matter, right? 122, 50. And this list is obviously a lot longer. There's going to be 14 different numbers and it picks the middle. And the reason for that is again because if you took an average, the mean, that means that outliers can actually significantly influence the reference price. Now how often does the medianizer update? So the medianizer updates anytime the mean changes. So each of these feed providers, their setzer is configured to basically report a price if it changes by like half a percent or something like that. Don't quote me on that because each person can actually choose to change that variable.
00:11:53.230 - 00:12:34.814, Speaker B: But basically whenever they push an update to the medianizer or poke it, actually that's the actual call in the smart contract. They poke the medianizer and the medianizer updates its internal set of numbers. And when the middle number is different. It actually does a transaction and publishes this price as the reference price for Eth in the actual system. And this is the price that the CDP uses to calculate everything from the collateralization. Well, yeah, the collateralization ratio of 150%. Right.
00:12:34.814 - 00:12:43.502, Speaker B: Like it's based on that. There's also the, I guess the stability fee is not contingent on it. Debt ceiling is also not. But really it's the loan to value.
00:12:43.556 - 00:12:48.370, Speaker A: Ratio because not as a decision when you actually start.
00:12:48.520 - 00:13:10.620, Speaker B: Well, also. Yeah, exactly. And it's also like, how much dai can you actually draw? It's also when do you get liquidated? Right. Et cetera, et cetera. So it's a very important price to basically keep track of.
00:13:11.310 - 00:13:17.690, Speaker A: So the question here is, do you know how much this guy is spending on pretty much gas pushing these things?
00:13:17.760 - 00:13:40.350, Speaker B: Absolutely. So each one of these is a transaction fee. It depends on the day. Right. Like the network goes through seasons of congestion and seasons of no congestion. So this is actually a very heavy model and it doesn't scale because for one single price update, it requires 15 different transactions in multicolateral die. This whole system is completely changed.
00:13:40.350 - 00:13:54.214, Speaker B: Not completely, but all of these guys, they actually use secure scuttlebutt to sign messages and report to the medianizer off chain. And then the medianizer just has to publish a single reference price every time the same thing happens.
00:13:54.252 - 00:13:58.066, Speaker A: So you pretty much run a site like off chain through scuttlebut.
00:13:58.178 - 00:14:22.080, Speaker B: Do you know what scuttlebutt is? No. So Scuttlebutt is like an encrypted secure messaging protocol. It's a way to sign messages encryptographically, ensure that they're private, and send them around in a private network. But it's really, really great because it essentially functions almost the same way in a blockchain as a blockchain, but there's no transfer of value, it's just transferring messages. So. Yeah.
00:14:23.490 - 00:14:32.754, Speaker A: All right, cool. When I push a transaction, medianizer just puts it in the queue and then averages out later. Right. It's not exactly like updates it every.
00:14:32.792 - 00:14:49.638, Speaker B: Time somebody pushes it, updates it. If somebody pushes a price that changes the median. Yeah. Then the median gets updated. And I'm like 90% sure of that. So don't 100% quote me, but I'm pretty sure that's how it works.
00:14:49.644 - 00:14:59.986, Speaker A: I'm just interested what kind of front running things you can do on this where if somebody is pushing a price that is changing the Median and you actually pretty much kick them out of the block.
00:15:00.118 - 00:15:17.342, Speaker B: Absolutely. So all of these 14 guys are whitelisted. Right. If we go and analyze the price updates and we see somebody is intentionally misrepresenting a price or trying to manipulate something, we could work them out or remove their, remove them? Yeah.
00:15:17.396 - 00:15:40.250, Speaker A: I mean you can actually, like this guy is saying, oh, price changed. I'm pushing my update and somebody just like pretty much fills in the block with higher gas to postpone the update. Right. So you have period of time when this is not in effect and you have like an arbitrage mechanic like timing.
00:15:41.310 - 00:16:08.030, Speaker B: So I'm thinking if you're just blocking a transaction, you still need to rely on somebody to publish a fraudulent transaction because let's say three of the feed providers are down, their servers are just down and now we're relying on eleven instead of 14. It's kind of arbitrary because they're still all, now you don't have to manipulate seven, you just have to manipulate six of them to really change the median.
00:16:08.110 - 00:16:15.618, Speaker A: No, I mean, let's say you actually have everybody online and the price changed. Right. There's half a percent up.
00:16:15.704 - 00:16:16.146, Speaker B: Okay.
00:16:16.248 - 00:16:17.922, Speaker A: Right, so this guy's going to update.
00:16:17.986 - 00:16:18.310, Speaker B: Yes.
00:16:18.380 - 00:16:47.038, Speaker A: What you do is for a period of time you just fill in the blocks with your own transactions. Just with no operations, they just pay a fair bit of money to do that. So for a period of time, maker thinks the price is 120, when in reality Oracle maybe already 120 50 or something. Yeah, let's say it's changed dramatically. It's like 125, right? So this is real price.
00:16:47.124 - 00:16:47.760, Speaker B: Right.
00:16:48.930 - 00:17:05.318, Speaker A: I have a time period where I can collateralize some stuff, get in and then I unlock it. I stop doing this, the price changes. I didn't do math on how much you can make like this, but I.
00:17:05.324 - 00:17:49.182, Speaker B: Don'T think you can actually make much. And I'll tell you why. Because there is this thing called the OSM, which is, let me write this here. So there's the Oracle security module. So the Oracle security module actually creates a delay on only the maker price feed for now. But that's because there's reasons why it can delay the Ethereum price feed. The Oracle security module basically makes it so that maker holders can vote to change this number, but it's set to be a 1 hour delay on any price update.
00:17:49.182 - 00:18:21.546, Speaker B: So what that means is if you have basically somebody monitoring what the oracles are reporting to the medianizer, if you see some malicious attack or dosing or transaction block or whatever it is, you have the ability to either replace the feed provider and use a different server, get on the cloud do something or just work them out and rely on everybody else. If somebody's attacking all of them, then this 1 hour gives you a chance to basically do emergency shutdown.
00:18:21.738 - 00:18:25.200, Speaker A: Wait, so this is 1 hour? Always the price is delayed by one.
00:18:28.930 - 00:19:06.806, Speaker B: Reason. Oh, I remember why Ethereum is not delayed. So, because remember I mentioned the liquidity providing contract that seizes the collateral and sells it according to the oracle price, it actually needs a real time price. So on multilateral Dai, this mechanism is changed. It's replaced by the auction mechanism, which it doesn't rely on an oracle because it's actually its own price discovery mechanism. So the reason why there is no delay on Ethereum now and single collateral DAi is because of the way that collateral sales work through the liquidity providing contract. But eventually, in multilateral Dai, it will also have a 1 hour delay.
00:19:06.806 - 00:19:43.894, Speaker B: And what that basically does is it gives people a buffer, and there's actually no downside to it. There's only upside. So from the perspective of the CDP user, they have an hour to basically, if the price is dropping, they have an hour to add collateral to pay back. Right. And on the downside, like, if you try to think of a downside, what happens if Ethereum goes up? Technically nothing, because you're still dealing with the lower price. So you can't actually draw more die. I mean, you can in anticipation, but there's really no way to profit from it because you know where the Ethereum price is and you can't really know.
00:19:43.894 - 00:19:52.620, Speaker B: I think I'm explaining it incorrectly, but there's no real downside that I see that anybody has been able to really explain to me.
00:19:53.150 - 00:20:04.750, Speaker A: All right. Yeah, let's talk about the liquidation thing, because that's the interesting part, the auctions. Well, explain how it works right now. And then how it will work with.
00:20:04.900 - 00:20:06.990, Speaker B: Let's get rid of all of our oracles.
00:20:08.530 - 00:20:31.062, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, specifically, actually, starting from. I have a CDP, right, which is under, as of medianizer updated, it's under the coldization ratio, who is actually putting it into liquidation. Like, how does that work?
00:20:31.116 - 00:20:58.158, Speaker B: Sure. Okay, so let's take example of a CDP, right? CDP, since we're in Colorado, number 420, owned by Rick Berman. So you better retweet this, Rick. All right, so CDP 420 has, let's try to do an easy number, $150 worth of eth, right.
00:20:58.324 - 00:21:01.146, Speaker A: Maybe just write an ETH because it's.
00:21:01.178 - 00:21:03.130, Speaker B: Just make it neater.
00:21:03.210 - 00:21:05.810, Speaker A: Yeah, let's do this. 150 maybe.
00:21:05.960 - 00:21:12.130, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. Let's do this as one. Yeah, I like that better for conceptual.
00:21:12.550 - 00:21:14.206, Speaker A: And then you have, like, one eth.
00:21:14.238 - 00:21:51.534, Speaker B: Yeah. And then you have one ETH locked as collateral, and you borrowed against this one eth. 100 die. So, as you can see, your collateralization ratio. Right? So let's do debt. So your collateralization ratio is actually right at the precipice, because this is worth 150, and you're at 100 die. So your loan to value ratio is one to one and a half.
00:21:51.534 - 00:22:32.426, Speaker B: So you're at exactly 150%. Right. Did I just do that backwards? All right, collateralization ratio is 150. So what happens when the next oracle price is $148? Guess what your collateralization ratio becomes 148%. Right? So 148%. And what this means is, in the system that makes anybody able to call the byte function.
00:22:32.608 - 00:22:35.786, Speaker A: Hey, I have an off topic question. What's up with all the names?
00:22:35.898 - 00:23:09.850, Speaker B: It's a whole lexicon. You got to be part of the club, man. No, but flip, flop, flop, bite, poke. It's like short names that if you recognize what they mean, it actually all makes so much sense. It makes it a lot more simple if you're really looking at what it does. But a byte is a fancy, or maybe a simplified name for liquidation. But basically anybody can go and bite your CDP, right? Your CDP, right? They could bite it.
00:23:09.850 - 00:24:22.074, Speaker B: And what happens when they bite it is the collateral. Your one ethereum. It goes through a calculation. So if right now, the liquidity providing contract sees that you're unsafe and says, okay, you owe 100 die, and the liquidation penalty is 13%, so it says, okay, I see that you borrowed 100 die, but I need to sell your collateral to cover actually 113 die. And what it does is it queries or looks at the oracle price of Ethereum, says, okay, so it's $148 per ethereum, and I need to raise $113. So I don't want to do the math here, but let's say it takes like, zero, 80 to cover $113, right? Approximately. So it'll seize the 185 e, and it will offer it for sale through the liquidity providing contract.
00:24:22.074 - 00:25:00.474, Speaker B: So this ethereum will now be purchasable for a 3% discount. You know what I'm saying? Discount from the oracle price. So from this price. And that basically gives keepers or independent agents that are looking for quickbuck a very risk free profit, because you could actually do the byte and the purchase in a single atomic transaction, as we have been seeing in our system. So that's basically how it works. But the liquidity providing contract relies on this price real time.
00:25:00.592 - 00:25:07.200, Speaker A: So when they do byte, and the purchase pretty much you attach die to the byte or how do you buy it?
00:25:08.290 - 00:25:13.394, Speaker B: I'm not sure how to actually craft the transaction just because I've never done it myself.
00:25:13.512 - 00:25:21.380, Speaker A: How do you in two transactions, let's say it's a buy, it's in the liquidity provided contract. How do I buy this?
00:25:23.830 - 00:25:36.278, Speaker B: There's a contract call to buy it, but you can also buy it from, I guess, the die makerdow.com, like old front end. You could actually click and physically buy it yourself if you're not running like a script to do this.
00:25:36.364 - 00:25:38.680, Speaker A: No, but what are you buying this with?
00:25:40.270 - 00:25:53.260, Speaker B: Okay, so next part of this process. Right, so this zero point 85 in ETH, somebody is going to purchase this for 113 die. Right.
00:25:53.870 - 00:26:00.590, Speaker A: So discount, should it be 110 or whatever is -97% of 110?
00:26:00.740 - 00:26:07.274, Speaker B: I'm not sure if it factors it in before or after, but basically it's trying to raise 113 die.
00:26:07.322 - 00:26:07.614, Speaker A: I see.
00:26:07.652 - 00:26:22.200, Speaker B: Okay. Right. So it'll sell as much ethereum to get 113 die. I don't know if it always gets it. I'm actually a little bit muddy on the details here. But think about it as it does it good enough to raise 113. So what happens to this 113? Right.
00:26:22.200 - 00:26:59.380, Speaker B: Number 1100 of it gets erased from the supply. And the reason for that is because you actually created it here. Right. So the accounting, it basically closes out your bad loan. Now you have $13 left. And this $13 in single collateral die is actually used to purchase Pete. And that's a whole different mechanism that we could talk about and actually purchases it and burns it.
00:26:59.380 - 00:27:29.740, Speaker B: So no more peace. But yeah, so it purchases it and burns it. And the reason for that, in a succinct way, is actually Peeth holders. Anybody who's a CDP user has to convert their ethereum into peeth. And they actually have a larger claim now of the underlying collateral. So they actually profit from the liquidity penalty. But in multicolateral die, this is actually going to be profitable for maker holders instead.
00:27:30.930 - 00:27:33.070, Speaker A: Why was there a piece in the first place?
00:27:33.220 - 00:27:50.158, Speaker B: So I think it was to get the minimum viable product out for single collateral die. And it was basically like a shortcut. Maybe, but I'm not 100% sure. If Nick was here, he'd probably explain it better, but I don't have a good answer for that.
00:27:50.244 - 00:27:52.842, Speaker A: Yeah, it does feel like this should be buying maker.
00:27:52.906 - 00:28:07.320, Speaker B: Exactly. Yeah. But for this iteration of the system, it's buying and burning, Pete. So CDP users actually gets a profit. Yeah. So yeah, that's basically how it works right now.
00:28:08.010 - 00:28:15.126, Speaker A: So this is if you get liquidated. Right. How do you close it yourself? You just put back the 100 die?
00:28:15.318 - 00:28:35.874, Speaker B: Yeah. If you want to close it before it gets liquidated, you pay back the 100 die plus the stability fee. So whenever you get liquidated, the stability fee is actually not taken. So maker holders lose out. Non liquidations, actually, because the stability fee is not collected. But that's also something that's fixed in multilateral die. So 100 die plus.
00:28:35.874 - 00:29:02.490, Speaker B: Let's say you had this open for a year. At the moment, the stability fee is 1%, so you'd pay 101 die. The one dollars goes to purchasing MKR and burning it, which reduces the supply of MKR.
00:29:06.360 - 00:29:20.152, Speaker A: All right, so where is, in theory, this one? Let's say when this thing just started, right there was opened one CDP, and then I want to close it right away.
00:29:20.206 - 00:29:57.300, Speaker B: Sure. So actually, this $1, it's denominated. The stability fee is denominated in Dai, but originally, up until, like, two weeks ago, you can only pay it in MKR. So you actually didn't have to deal with the math behind keeping the accounting of the supply of DAi intact. So what you do is you purchase maker. Now, actually, in our CDP portal, you can do the same thing with dye. But the cool thing is, in the back end, what happens is it takes the dye and it actually swaps it for maker, and then it sends the maker to burn.
00:29:57.960 - 00:29:59.910, Speaker A: How does it swap? Is there, like.
00:30:00.920 - 00:30:13.160, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it uses either Kyber or Oasis, but there's some pair, and it just does a transaction, a market, like limit order. Market order, probably market order, yeah. Cool.
00:30:13.230 - 00:30:19.932, Speaker A: Yeah. So this is pretty much current model.
00:30:19.986 - 00:30:46.304, Speaker B: And then this is the current model. Yeah. So the couple of weaknesses are the fact that this $113, I'm not sure if it's guaranteed. Maybe sometimes it might raise, like, 112 if the value. If it calculates 85 eth to get 113. But in the time that somebody actually buys it, maybe the price of ETH falls another dollar. It might raise $111 instead, but that's okay because it's raising a surplus.
00:30:46.304 - 00:30:56.852, Speaker B: And the real thing that you actually have to worry about is this hundred. It has to raise the 100 so that it can cancel out your debt that's in danger. The 13%, that's extra. That's just an incentive.
00:30:56.996 - 00:31:10.110, Speaker A: So let's say calculate 113, put it in the market, but the price went down even more. Right. What's the probability of it going under 100?
00:31:10.480 - 00:31:38.084, Speaker B: Well, it depends on the velocity of the downward price action. But if this zero point 85 can't cover 100. What actually happens is piece is minted and it's used as the recapitalization source. So it'll be minted and sold for whatever leftover die it needs. Yeah. So in single collateral die, not a lot of people know, but Maker is never burned. Sorry.
00:31:38.084 - 00:32:04.220, Speaker B: Maker is never actually issued. So maker, as the lender of last resort, is actually only going to be in multilateral die. Right now, the lender of last resort is Peeth holders. And for some fun, what is peace again, Peeth is pooled ether. So let's explain peace. See, I told you. I know the granular details.
00:32:04.220 - 00:32:27.556, Speaker B: All right, first off, there's eth, right? Our favorite cryptocurrency. Then there's wiese wrapped ether. And the reason you do wiese is because it's your c 20. Right, exactly. And you can interact. Yes. You can interact with smart contracts with it.
00:32:27.556 - 00:32:59.996, Speaker B: Right. But in maker, you actually have to convert your with to Pete and the. This is inconsistent. Okay, cool. There we go. So originally at the inception of single collateral die, the ratio of weath to Peeth was one to one. And basically what this means is over time, the ratio changes because pith is burned.
00:32:59.996 - 00:33:23.464, Speaker B: So for every one wheat that you have, if peeth is being burned, then your one wheat, or. Sorry. Let's do this. This is the peth. This is the weth. So if the pest to west ratio changes. Right.
00:33:23.464 - 00:33:54.450, Speaker B: So one pest will earn you now 1.1. And then one to one point today, it's like four something. Right. So over time, the liquidation penalty actually creates. Because it's burning peeth, you actually have more of a claim on the wheat. Exactly. And then when Peeth is created, it's actually the other way down.
00:33:54.450 - 00:33:58.130, Speaker B: This ratio goes back down.
00:33:58.920 - 00:34:03.668, Speaker A: Everybody who is in CDP right now, they are in. They.
00:34:03.754 - 00:34:38.830, Speaker B: Since they are taking on the risk of dilution of peeth, they get to get the reward for successful liquidations. And that's how it functions right now. And right now, Peeth holders, there's not been a single dilution of peace because there's never been a single actual event of insolvency in the life of our system so far. So Peeth holders actually made a lot more than Maker holders. I think they made something like the last number I read was like 4 million or four and a half million spread across all peak holders. Yeah.
00:34:40.020 - 00:34:59.252, Speaker A: What is the ceiling for this? Like, how much can you earn? No, how much? Let's say so right now. Whatever. Ethereum. I mean, for simplicity, 10 billion. Right. Market cap, what is the die for the current model. Pretty much.
00:34:59.252 - 00:35:04.104, Speaker A: Sure multicolateral should just make it all great.
00:35:04.222 - 00:35:59.668, Speaker B: Well, the whole thing is there's a lot of things that you have to consider when you think about ETH as a collateral. So, number one, you have to consider liquidity risk. So liquidity risk means, let's say right now there's 2% of ETH blocked in our smart contracts, right? But let's say five years down the line, ten years down the line, it's something like something crazy. And maker holders completely screwed the pony. Two coworkers and they just were like, you know what, we're going to be super liberal. And they allowed like 80% of the Ethereum supply. Well, guess what? If 80% of the ethereum supply is locked up, then anytime somebody gets liquidated and ethereum needs to be sold, there's less liquidity on the market, which means that the sales are actually going to have more of an effect on the price of Ethan.
00:35:59.668 - 00:36:22.800, Speaker B: The slippage. So the more liquidity you have, the less slippage and the less risk of slippage during a collateral auction, right? So there's liquidity risk. You don't ever want to lock above a certain amount of supply of any given asset because that's going to kill your liquidity, and that's going to kill your recourse, right? So number two, so what is the current liquidity?
00:36:23.300 - 00:36:26.384, Speaker A: Yeah, what is the current limit or ceiling for this?
00:36:26.422 - 00:37:21.924, Speaker B: Well, it's really hard to quantify because volume data on exchanges is very unreliable. Right, unreliable. Okay, so this part, if you want to have a really good understanding of your liquidity risk and how much available liquidity there really is at the moment, which, by the way, can change, right? Like Ethereum, liquidity could definitely dry up, or it can become very ample. So the liquidity risk value in the equation of how do you define the risk of Ethereum as a collateral? It shifts with the dynamic market. Right? So let me just clean this up a little bit. So there's volume, right? And that is just related actually to liquidity. So let's do it like.
00:37:22.122 - 00:37:25.460, Speaker A: Yeah, liquidity. Yeah, pretty much volume defines liquidity.
00:37:27.880 - 00:38:07.170, Speaker B: This is actually going to be very interesting moving forward when people actually learn how to clean the data from the exchanges and differentiate wash trading from real things. And even there's just a lot of nuance with this. So there is liquidity risk. And so if you lock in some maximum amount of supply, that's really bad. And the way you actually deal with this is you set a debt ceiling. So every single collateral in the die credit system has a debt ceiling. Currently, Ethereum's debt ceiling is 100 million.
00:38:07.170 - 00:38:32.330, Speaker B: So basically, because we're being careful, we're limiting the amount of Dai that you can issue against Ethereum to 100 million. And if you consider the average collateralization of the entire system to be 300%. Let's do some math, right? That means that you can have up to $300 million worth of Ethereum, whatever that might be.
00:38:35.420 - 00:38:39.444, Speaker A: This is like a number that just somebody said governance.
00:38:39.492 - 00:38:52.576, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. This is what limits you from using 100% of the supply. Right. It's just you are basically. Because if you open this limit up, you're actually putting the ethereum in danger. Exactly.
00:38:52.678 - 00:38:57.984, Speaker A: So what if you hit this limit? Pretty much you cannot issue more die. Right?
00:38:58.022 - 00:39:43.404, Speaker B: So we did hit this limit before. So a little bit of a history lesson. The first debt ceiling was actually 50 million, and we hit that debt ceiling. And the cool thing is now it's like a good time to talk about short term stability mechanisms for the actual die peg. So for any die pair, there's market makers, there's people providing liquidity, and there's people arbitraging and maintaining the peg. So what happens when you hit 50 million? Right, let's say there's 50 million die. Let's say you hit it now, your supply is at its maximum, right? It's at its total maximum.
00:39:43.404 - 00:40:27.680, Speaker B: But the problem is that what if demand, demand is still running? So if the demand for Dai is more than 50 million, then guess what? Exactly. Dai is now trading at a premium, right? Premium, et cetera. It's trading at a premium. And this is a problem. But in the short term, if it hits the ceiling, you actually have some time because market makers will use this as profit opportunity to basically reap the benefits of this premium. And then once their die inventory goes like really low, right? Like they only have 1000 die, but they have 3000. Ethereum.
00:40:27.680 - 00:41:19.912, Speaker B: This is an issue for market makers, providing short term stability. So although if you hit it, it's not an immediate threat, it will reflect in the peg in some short amount of time, in the short to medium term, probably in the short term. So if 50 million hits, you have to raise it, which we did. We raised it to 100. And this has been sufficient for now because funny thing is, during a bear market, this is good. Actually. The supply of DAi suffered a few 10% downward spikes because there was actually like this guy, CDP, three, two, eight, everybody's famous, right? He had a $7 million.
00:41:19.912 - 00:41:48.312, Speaker B: CDP, when the total supply of Dai was 70 million. So he held 10% of the supply, effectively, and he got liquidated, which means that he actually paid what, like $900,000 in penalties that went straight to peeth holders. Right. So thanks, 3228. You made me a little bit more money, but yeah. So the debt ceiling is really not like in single collateral die. If you hit it, you have no choice but to move it up.
00:41:48.366 - 00:41:51.448, Speaker A: But then why do you have it if you start moving it up anyway?
00:41:51.534 - 00:42:23.696, Speaker B: Well, I'll tell you. Because in multicolateral Dai, if there's die demand, you can shift the supply to a different collateral. So if there is like, let's say eth and let's say the second collateral is digix, which it's probably. I have no idea if it is, but. No, but seriously, right, so let's say ether hits the 100 million mark and you cannot create any more dye. So the supply is like capped. Like it's caput.
00:42:23.696 - 00:42:53.528, Speaker B: Right. So now digits might have, let's give it a very liberal amount for now because it actually does not have a lot of liquidity and there's not a lot of digits around. But let's say there's 20 million of capacity here and there's only like, let's say like 3 million based of Dai debt. Right. Of Dai issued against it. So you still have another 17 million of Runway.
00:42:53.624 - 00:42:56.904, Speaker A: Yeah. So people will just start selling ether, getting digits.
00:42:56.952 - 00:42:57.260, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:42:57.330 - 00:42:58.124, Speaker A: Pushing price down.
00:42:58.162 - 00:43:43.768, Speaker B: Exactly. And when you no longer have the availability to use ETH as collateral, what you're going to do is, okay, what's the next thing that I could do to get myself some dai and to enter into a CDP and get that short term liquidity? Maybe you have ETH and you sell it for Digix. Or maybe you take your ETH and go to compound and borrow some digix or use dharma or somebody, but you get your hands on some digix and now the system is effectively managing its portfolio of underlying assets. And using the debt ceiling, you can actually allocate certain percentages of the underlying collateral portfolio to certain collaterals. So it's a way of control of not letting the liquidity risk overwhelm.
00:43:43.864 - 00:43:51.180, Speaker A: But should it be market controlling this? It's a portfolio. Right. You're pretty much setting a limit on portfolio.
00:43:51.260 - 00:43:51.792, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:43:51.926 - 00:43:54.370, Speaker A: In somewhat artificial way.
00:43:55.620 - 00:44:06.260, Speaker B: Absolutely. But you have to, because if you don't and you let this run wild, you can actually collapse the asset. If people misuse it. If people really do.
00:44:06.330 - 00:44:13.956, Speaker A: Yeah, because you only have the ETH up, you don't have eth down kind.
00:44:13.978 - 00:44:29.788, Speaker B: Of mechanics in this. And it's really the liquidity that suffers. And if the less liquidity, listen, if you have 80% of ETH and you have a market downturn, a bear market, everybody gets liquidated. And guess what? Once people start getting liquidated, that cascades because that's a sell order in the.
00:44:29.794 - 00:44:31.384, Speaker A: Market, people buying ether.
00:44:31.512 - 00:45:03.576, Speaker B: So it actually creates like a very slippery slope. And that's why you see these very sharp downward spikes at the end of bear markets or at the apex of bear markets, because you see all the shorts getting closed out and there's a liquidity squeeze and then it bounces back and whatever. But basically this is necessary not only for basically making sure that the collateral is not suffering, but it's also important for diversifying the underlying collateral portfolio. Yeah, cool.
00:45:03.678 - 00:45:09.892, Speaker A: So maybe we can get more into how it is a multicolateral.
00:45:09.956 - 00:46:05.800, Speaker B: So we talked about the liquidity providing contract and how collateral sales work in multicolateral dai, or in single collateral die today, but in multicolateral dye, there's going to be auctions. And auctions are great because no oracles. So now you can have a delayed Ethereum price and you can have the benefits of having that security delay because you don't need oracles for the new auction system. So the new auction system, I'm going to try to explain it as best as I can, but I read about it a couple of months ago and did my research on it a few months ago. So forgive me if I get some details wrong, but I'll do my best to explain it. So this is the part that I might get wrong, but there's flip, flap and flop.
00:46:05.960 - 00:46:09.756, Speaker A: Yeah, I read some of maker code and that was the first thing.
00:46:09.778 - 00:46:49.400, Speaker B: I'm like flip, flop and flop. Yeah. So flop auction is where maker is issued and sold. Last resort, right? Flip auction, no, sorry. A flap auction is something called a forward auction. I'm going to explain what that is. And a flip auction, if I'm not mistaken, is a reverse auction.
00:46:49.400 - 00:47:42.712, Speaker B: I'll explain what all these things are. So the only part I'm not sure about is if I'm mixing these two up because I get a bit dyslexic. But I'm pretty sure flip is reverse because it makes sense, right? And flap is just the first auction. So let's take the example that we used before, right? Let's say that you have one ether worth $149 and you have hundred die debt, right? Debt. So what happens when. Now you could. What happens when you bite this CDT right.
00:47:42.712 - 00:48:12.832, Speaker B: What happens to your one eth? So let's start from the Ford auction. So sorry that I drew this in the wrong order, but this happens first and then either this happens b or this happens one a. Maybe I should have wrote two b or two a. Yeah, that's probably better. Bear with me. So this is one, this is two a, best scenario, and two b, worst scenario. So the first thing that happens is a forward auction.
00:48:12.832 - 00:49:00.048, Speaker B: So the auction takes your full amount of eth, your entire collateral, and it puts it up in a contract, and it says, bid on me, I need to raise 100 die plus penalties. So one eth, I need to raise 113 die. So once everybody bids and it establishes 113 die worth of bids on one ethereum, the flap auction ends. Right, like it ends. And now the flip auction begins. So now it says, okay, I have your bids at 113 die for this one ethereum. How little ethereum are you willing to take for this 113 die? So now you're going to have bids like saying, okay, I'll take 1.998
00:49:00.048 - 00:49:04.628, Speaker B: and you're going to have zero point 990, right?
00:49:04.714 - 00:49:08.784, Speaker A: 0.8 pretty much, if you do price discovery from both sides.
00:49:08.832 - 00:49:15.796, Speaker B: Exactly. So number one, it establishes the minimum amount to raise to cover the die debt and the penalty.
00:49:15.908 - 00:49:18.264, Speaker A: So if this did not establish, then.
00:49:18.302 - 00:49:48.560, Speaker B: You go to two b. Yeah, there you go. Exactly. So basically at the end of the flip auction, you basically take the 100 die, burn it, and then the 13 die, you buy maker and burn it. So that's basically how that happens. Now, let's say something else happens, you get bitten and the flap auction occurs. Right.
00:49:48.560 - 00:50:18.984, Speaker B: And it says, we're going to give you one ETH and we need to raise 113 die. And unfortunately, you only got bids up until $100 or like not even $100. Let's say something even crazier. Let's say like $98, sorry, not ninety eight cents. Ninety eight dollars. Now, this is not enough to cover your die debt. So what happens is there's a certain time limit on each auction.
00:50:18.984 - 00:51:11.870, Speaker B: So if it does not raise enough die within the time limit, it actually. So this is where I need to kind of think for a second and get this exactly right because I've been messing it up in my explanation for people. But what happens is it takes, I think it cancels out. Jeez, maker issued and sold. Basically the thing that I can't remember is I can't remember if it honors these bids or if it completely cancels it and says, let's cover this maker. No, you know what happens? You know what happens? I think that the person that bids actually receives the east. Exactly.
00:51:11.870 - 00:51:45.450, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. Right. So then there's a balance of $15 that this thing has to raise, right? Yeah. So the Ford auction raised some of the die, but not all of the die. So there's $15 left. And basically what happens is it says, I'm not 100% certain on how it establishes the first issuance of maker, how much that is. But the flop auction will say, let's say I'm going to auction off.
00:51:45.450 - 00:51:47.732, Speaker B: Maybe it uses the oracle.
00:51:47.796 - 00:51:49.848, Speaker A: Yeah, it uses the oracle for the price and gets.
00:51:49.934 - 00:52:25.984, Speaker B: Yeah, so basically it'll do a forward auction on the maker. So it'll put up, let's say, one MKR and it'll try to raise the 15 die. And so basically what happens is it says, here's one MKR, how much are you willing to bid for it? And so people say, okay, like, I'm willing to bid five die, willing to bid ten die, willing to bid 14 die, and then eventually somebody bids 15 die. So I need to read up exactly how to flop.
00:52:26.032 - 00:52:29.270, Speaker A: But why don't you just do a reverse auction? You say, I need the 15.
00:52:30.840 - 00:52:34.660, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, I need 15 die.
00:52:34.740 - 00:52:39.748, Speaker A: How much maker do you want for it? And then just issue that maker?
00:52:39.924 - 00:53:13.700, Speaker B: Maybe that is how it works, actually. See, I did this like a couple of months ago, so I'm a little bit loose on my flop. But yeah, so maybe it is actually a reverse auction that says we need to raise 15 die. How much maker are you willing to take? Somebody says, I want half a maker, and somebody's like, nah. What? Half a maker? That's way too much. I'll take a quarter of a maker and then still like $15 a quarter of a maker. You're getting like, increase in Horowitz prices.
00:53:13.700 - 00:53:28.580, Speaker B: You are right. It is basically a reverse auction that people are trying to basically tell the system how much die to issue and they will give their 15 die that they're pledging.
00:53:28.660 - 00:53:38.004, Speaker A: So when this auctions run, do people actually bid with actual, like, the transaction is actual bid? That would be on blockchain or is it?
00:53:38.062 - 00:53:53.116, Speaker B: I'm not 100% sure if it's on the blockchain or if it can be just like a signed transaction and there's a single transaction that actually happens once each threshold is reached. So I'm not 100% certain about the details.
00:53:53.228 - 00:53:59.172, Speaker A: Do you run a separate, pretty much book order book or not?
00:53:59.226 - 00:54:02.550, Speaker B: Pretty much. Well, there's going to be.
00:54:04.360 - 00:54:06.470, Speaker A: Order book is on blockchain itself.
00:54:06.840 - 00:54:10.564, Speaker B: Well, the thing is that the auctions is not really an order book. Right.
00:54:10.602 - 00:54:14.824, Speaker A: It's just, well, yeah, it still can be like if people start, like.
00:54:14.942 - 00:54:36.728, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. It's sales through instances, right. So there's going to be all these different collaterals and each collateral is going to be going through liquidations. And every time there's a liquidation, it always starts here. It always starts with, I need to raise 113 die. Right. I'm going to offer all of your collateral, and if that doesn't work, I'm going to flop.
00:54:36.728 - 00:54:49.580, Speaker B: And if I do raise it, then I'm going to flip and it's going to be a reverse auction. So yeah, that's how auctions work in multicolateral Dai, and they serve to be actually their very own price discovery mechanism.
00:54:49.660 - 00:54:53.140, Speaker A: So why not use the spread discovery mechanism instead of oracles?
00:54:54.040 - 00:55:32.144, Speaker B: Or you could feed it into the oracles. So I think that, I don't know 100% how to answer it, but I'll give you my concern that comes to mind. What if there's a real consistent one to 2% discount on this price, right. Because people participating in auctions are trying to actually arbitrage. They want to get the collateral, sell it, and then pocket, like whatever, three die every time they do this small of a CDP. Right. So feeding it back into the oracle price, it's probably not going to ever be the median, but it will be an extra data point, I guess.
00:55:32.144 - 00:55:50.230, Speaker B: So. I don't know. I'm curious what Mariano Conti would say about this. He's actually at East Denver, so you should talk to him about that. But yeah, I think that's as far as I can go with flip flop and flop auctions. But as you can see, it solves the oracle delay problem.
00:55:51.260 - 00:55:53.530, Speaker A: Do you have anything else you want to talk about?
00:55:54.220 - 00:56:34.964, Speaker B: I do want to talk about actually one thing. The stability of the die peg. Right? So the die stability, what gives it stability? Right. So you have to look at the short term and the long term or the bigger, like the macro. Right. For short term, you have market makers, you have CDP users where if Dai is trading above a dollar, you're incentivized to actually create Dai because you get an extra percent or half, like 50 basis points of purchasing power. This is actually good.
00:56:34.964 - 00:57:10.480, Speaker B: When dai is trading below a dollar, you can pay off your debt for a discount of like 50 or basis points to a percentage point or whatever it might be. So this is short term stability. These main two incentives, there's the keepers, the market makers, who are trading on die pairs and trying to keep it at a dollar. And then there's CDP users who produce the supply or contract the supply, right. They can mess with the supply. And this is very short term, but long term, what happens when these keepers.
00:57:10.900 - 00:57:12.240, Speaker A: Try to drive the price?
00:57:12.310 - 00:58:04.156, Speaker B: Yeah, what happens if there's an imbalance in the macro supply demand function, right. Of Dai. So the demand of Dai can go up in such a way that these two are not enough. Right. So if demand goes up, then you need supply to basically compensate for that premium that you're going to see in the spot market. And basically how this is solved on a macro level is there's policy tools and if you participate in maker governance, this is going to be a good word for you to understand. So a policy tool is a parameter that maker holders can change to basically manipulate the supply and then also manipulate the demand.
00:58:04.156 - 00:59:03.216, Speaker B: So the policy tool for supply, like this supply, is actually the stability fee, right? So the stability fee, if you raise it, you are contracting the supply or preventing the supply from growing at such a rate. And if you lower it, you're incentivizing cheap capital costs. So you're actually helping people to increase the supply of DAi. So the stability fee gives you the ability to adjust the macro supply demand imbalance. Now in multicolateral dai, there's also a tool for demand, which is the dai savings rate. So the dai savings rate is really interesting because it is a risk free rate of return for anybody who wants to lock their dai into this thing called savings mode. It's a smart contract that's going to be part of multilateral Dai.
00:59:03.216 - 00:59:43.196, Speaker B: And if you do that, you get some small percentage. It's basically like a decentralized savings account and it incentivizes you to hold dai. So it's producing demand. So if you adjust this up or down, if it's zero, there is no net loss in demand. But if you tune it anywhere up, you're actually producing artificial demand for Dai. So let's say that there's a lot of supply and a lot of collaterals and there's just like dai is trading way below the peg. You can do something like the dai savings rate and that'll fix the long term imbalance.
00:59:43.228 - 00:59:46.956, Speaker A: Wait, so this is like it just mints new Dai there in the banks.
00:59:47.068 - 00:59:51.216, Speaker B: So the stability fee, it takes out a portion from the stability fees and.
00:59:51.238 - 00:59:52.616, Speaker A: Feeds it into that contract.
00:59:52.668 - 01:00:04.908, Speaker B: Exactly. So the stability fee is charged on all Dai in circulation, but the dai savings rate takes a portion of the stability fee and pays it to whatever dai is locked in the savings mode.
01:00:04.944 - 01:00:07.908, Speaker A: Smart contract and everything else is used to burn.
01:00:08.004 - 01:00:53.952, Speaker B: Everything else is used to burn maker and then eventually also it could be used for operational costs like paying oracles or paying risk teams. Yeah. So these are the two policy tools that maker holders vote on. Over the last couple of months there has been a few votes on the stability fee because we're in single collateral dai and this doesn't exist yet. And mainly, actually the biggest challenge is in the last few weeks dai has been trading slightly below the peg, which signifies an oversupply. So we raised it from half a percent to a percent and we're seeing kind of by 50 basis points at a time what that effect is on the peg. And that's kind of some of the data that the governance side of maker, the community is trying to gather and use for future decision.
01:00:53.952 - 01:01:07.230, Speaker B: Exactly. Because this is brand new and we only changed the stability field like three times so far. So yeah, short term stability, long term stability. This is something that I think everybody who is curious about makers should really understand.
01:01:07.840 - 01:01:14.280, Speaker A: And how does this feeds back? Let's say I am the maker holder.
01:01:14.360 - 01:01:14.990, Speaker B: Sure.
01:01:16.240 - 01:01:24.304, Speaker A: For me, getting it to a dollar, how does that benefits me versus pushing the price up or down?
01:01:24.502 - 01:01:51.988, Speaker B: So from the perspective of a maker token holder, if the peg is consistently trading below a dollar, you know that your market makers are actually in danger. You know that in general your peg is suffering some sort of imbalance in the macro supply and demand. So you have to adjust for that if you want to keep your peg healthy. Because you know what, the market makers have to go the other way too. They have to have more opportunities to actually sell die at above a dollar.
01:01:52.084 - 01:02:00.040, Speaker A: No, but as a maker token holder, how am I incentivized for peg to be $1?
01:02:00.120 - 01:02:26.340, Speaker B: Sure. I mean, if the peg is not healthy, then your product, your main product loses its integrity and value. So if USDC performs way better in terms of stability on its peg than dai, then you're basically losing your market share and you're losing your confidence in what the product is. So you actually do need to actively manage the supply and demand of the.
01:02:26.490 - 01:02:30.292, Speaker A: So if I increase stability fee, right, this actually benefits me as a maker hold.
01:02:30.346 - 01:02:31.076, Speaker B: Yes it does.
01:02:31.178 - 01:02:33.908, Speaker A: So why don't I just start slowly driving it up?
01:02:33.994 - 01:02:50.168, Speaker B: Well, because if you keep driving it up, then the supply is going to contract and the demand is going to keep growing because you can't actually control demand at the moment and you're going to make the peg imbalanced so too high of a stability fee is going to create too much of a block on supply.
01:02:50.344 - 01:02:58.944, Speaker A: But like short term as a way to make money, as a maker holder, I can actually like, if it's a rage quit strategy. Right. You just increase this.
01:02:59.142 - 01:03:03.920, Speaker B: Well, thank God no one maker holder can make this decision. The whole community has to agree.
01:03:04.070 - 01:03:08.920, Speaker A: What's a voting procedure on this governance structure?
01:03:09.020 - 01:03:29.130, Speaker B: So the voting procedure for this, at the moment, there's two types of votes. There's governance polls and executive votes. And executive votes doesn't mean like executives. It means like execute a change to the state of the platform. Right.
01:03:30.060 - 01:03:30.888, Speaker A: Collects data.
01:03:30.974 - 01:03:37.956, Speaker B: Yes. Well, no governance poll is more like soft consensus. So it's meant to start off the conversation. Yeah.
01:03:37.998 - 01:03:39.516, Speaker A: Like collect data about what people think.
01:03:39.538 - 01:04:24.312, Speaker B: Yeah, soft consensus. Do we want to raise the stability fee? Let's start talking about it. But then in the executive vote, there's just a lot more rigorous data backing up any proposal that's put forth. So you can imagine that the maker Dow risk team that has been putting forth a proposal says, I'm going to put forth a proposal for like last week, a raise of 50 basis points in the stability fee. And our reasons are because we have communications and we know the largest DAi market makers and they're basically about to be in a very bad situation in short term if we don't do something. And we also know that Dai is actually consistently trading. I'm not going to write that down.
01:04:24.312 - 01:05:03.144, Speaker B: Dai is consistently trading below the peg for the last few weeks since we lowered it from two and a half percent to half a percent because recently it was at half a percent. So the executive vote is going to say, okay, we want to have a healthy peg. Also, an increase in half a percent and doing it in 50 basis point increments is really great for data analysis moving forward. We think this is the best decision for the short term, it passes and the stability fee increases. And then we observe over the next week or two what happens to the peg. And this is the process right now for the stability fee. And it's going to work very similar to the DAI savings rate.
01:05:03.144 - 01:05:14.888, Speaker B: And it's going to work a little bit different for adding collateral, removing collateral, and deciding on the risk parameters for all these different collaterals. So. Yeah, cool.
01:05:14.974 - 01:05:15.784, Speaker A: Yeah, that's great.
01:05:15.822 - 01:05:17.736, Speaker B: That sums it up, right? Yeah, cool.
01:05:17.758 - 01:05:19.932, Speaker A: It's pretty good. All right. Thanks a lot.
01:05:20.066 - 01:05:21.676, Speaker B: Thank you guys for listening to me.
