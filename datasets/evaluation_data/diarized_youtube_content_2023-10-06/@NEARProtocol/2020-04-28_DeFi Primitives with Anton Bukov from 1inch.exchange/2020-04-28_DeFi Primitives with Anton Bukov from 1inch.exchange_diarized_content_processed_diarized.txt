00:00:00.570 - 00:00:06.320, Speaker A: Raising tone I'm here. Okay.
00:00:24.040 - 00:00:25.110, Speaker B: It'S fine.
00:00:30.680 - 00:00:33.372, Speaker C: It maybe I am giving this talk.
00:00:33.546 - 00:01:06.460, Speaker A: It so we can start. Yeah. Okay cool. So I'm going to share my screen. Okay. Can you see it? Yes. Did we start the recording? I did.
00:01:06.460 - 00:02:09.470, Speaker A: Okay, so I'm colorblind so my slides will be like black and white. So this talk is about Defi primitives and about composability of Defi and how everything works. So I did some work by extracting primitives from existing DeFi projects. And for now I found three main categories of them. First one is tokenization. Second one is exchanges and third one is lending. There are a few ones which are out of these three types like insurance, but they are not really composable too much to include them into primitives which are composable.
00:02:09.470 - 00:03:25.382, Speaker A: So tokenization primitives, for example these stable coins like portfolios, which are also tokenized. And when multiple people own portfolio, they own subtokens of this portfolio. Also derivatives, this is like having options or futures on some tokens, but they are still tokenized and you can trade them. Also payment streams is one of primitive, which is not currently implemented in final stage. But some teams are working on this. They are producing some wrapper tokens, which also includes continuous payments inside. So we can for example wrap our Dai token into payment dai and then set up a streams between people where someone want to pay like ten die per week like this.
00:03:25.382 - 00:04:10.946, Speaker A: And balances will be computable and they will work with formulas. So whenever you will check your balance, it will just add everything that should be added since your last transaction. And subtract everything that should be extracted since your last transaction. So exchanges are usually, I see three types. This is order book based exchanges, where supply meets demand. And you can discover different orders of different prices. And when you see orders you wish to fill, you can fill them.
00:04:10.946 - 00:04:59.054, Speaker A: And also liquidity automated market makers. This is smart contracts, which are usually driven by some formula. And they can establish a reliable price that anyone will trade with this smart contract. So smart contract will be like a limit order, but not fixed price. It price usually change and it depends on the volume. And it works usually automatic, but sometimes they use also oracles, but this is not necessary. And aggregators, this is new kind of exchanges, which tries to aggregate all the different liquidity.
00:04:59.054 - 00:05:55.258, Speaker A: So the more you swap on single decks, the worse will be the rate. So if you could imagine all these dexes would be unified into single huge decks, you can get a better rate. So the reason aggregators appeared is that liquidity on Dexes is really too fragmented and aggregators are solving this problem and lending primitive. I found three use what? Okay, someone forgot to turn off mike. Okay, so lending. I see three different applications of lending. And first one is borrowing.
00:05:55.258 - 00:06:57.286, Speaker A: When you really need to borrow something, this could happen. For example, if you have like ever and don't want to sell it because you think that price is too low, you can put this ether into lending platform, then borrowed, some die and extract it into your bank account, waste it, spend it, and whenever you will decide that other price is high enough, you will be able to return your debt and extract your collateral. Ever. Also, leverage application is also based on lending. And one interesting thing also is lottery. I know single lottery on lending protocols, but maybe other will appear. So in this presentation I'm going to cover two topics, tokenization and lending.
00:06:57.286 - 00:07:48.998, Speaker A: And I'm not going to say about exchanges, because about exchanges I have a separate presentation. It's also quite big. Okay, so let's start from stable tokens. So I listed some of them. Some of them works in a centralized manner, some of them are decentralized, and some of them are aggregators. Here I showed how centralized stablecoins works. Some custodian holder locks, for example, USD on its bank account, and he's an owner and administrator of stable token.
00:07:48.998 - 00:08:43.610, Speaker A: And he can mint when someone brings him money. And when someone want to extract money, he can burn these tokens and do transfer from his bank account. Some of these custodian providers, they do have like audits that they have all the money they're talking about, all the tokens they issued are baked. Some they don't have audience. So it's something like this. Also there are some stable tokens which are like decentralized, they work in different manner. So for example, Dai is decentralized, stable token to USD.
00:08:43.610 - 00:09:27.694, Speaker A: And simply how it works. There is some system of smart contracts which works same way to have stabilize the price of this token. And anyone can issue this dai. You can print this dai by putting some collateral in different assets. For example, maker Dow die supports two collaterals for now, or even three. It's ether, USDC and bet. So you can put two hundred k bucks of ether and print for example, one hundred k of die.
00:09:27.694 - 00:10:28.634, Speaker A: So it sounds like decentralized lending protocol. Yes, and it behaves the same. And if your collateral will drop in price, your position could be liquidated. So your position is usually called that you have some collateral and some debt, and collateral is somehow locked in the system. And even sometimes collateral could be on different blockchain there are a few projects who are trying to achieve this, and they compete for the best implementation, for best idea of how to implement this. They have like for example bitcoin collateral, and they issue bitcoin token on Ethereum blockchain. And also want to mention one interesting project that have a lot of different stable tokens.
00:10:28.634 - 00:11:15.238, Speaker A: It is synthetics project. They even have ether token which called Seth, which is stable token to ether. And of course they have like SUSD, SEO and many, many other. Okay, so the next is portfolios. So there is a classification of portfolios. If you put multiple tokens into smart contracts, they can behave differently. Like there are instant rebalancing portfolios, which tries to keep your portfolio always in sync.
00:11:15.238 - 00:12:12.270, Speaker A: It's always balanced in some special proportions. So you can have like for example, the basic example is Uniswap. You can have half of your deposit in ever and half of your deposit in any other token. And when price changes, it will automatically rebalance by creating opportunity for arbitrage to swap on it to sell token, which became which price changed. Or buy this token and arbitrage see opportunity, they trade to profit and they rebalance your portfolio. So the oldest one of these projects is banker, next one was Uniswap, then curve. And the latest one is balancer.
00:12:12.270 - 00:12:57.578, Speaker A: And there is also projects where rebalancing strategy or swap strategy is quite difficult to understand. Not really understand. It is not like common strategy. They have different configurable strategies, you can configure your own. This is project stocking sets melon. So I have slide about instant rebalancing portfolios. I have similar slide in my Dex presentation, because instant rebalancing portfolios usually work as dexes on their own.
00:12:57.578 - 00:14:01.810, Speaker A: They are like automatic market makers. And yeah, you can look at them on portfolio tokens, which somehow manages your portfolio. And you can look at them like on dexes, because they allows people to swap any asset to any with some internal formulas. So here we can see that Uniswap, for example, have smart contracts where every smart contract is pair of any token and other, and they are always balanced. So balancer is like multi token, Uniswap with different proportions. Banker is similar to Uniswap, but appeared earlier, and they have different formulas to have different proportions. And also they even started to have multiple tokens in single pool.
00:14:01.810 - 00:15:31.710, Speaker A: And curve is a recent project which appears like a few weeks ago, maybe one month ago or two months ago. It works on different formula which allows to swap stable coins between each other for better rate than uniswap and other projects. And it is still like rebalancing and creating opportunities for the treasures. Yeah, so this is how your position should look like in complex rebalancing projects. So proportions could be changed, some internal rules could be based on some chart primitives like RSI, SMR and other. So these smart contracts could analyze price, how it changes and decide if they want to sell some token or buy some token. And then they could create some kind of auction to allow arbitrage to do all these swaps because they usually do not allow to swap immediately because they're trying to keep it decentralized.
00:15:31.710 - 00:17:05.706, Speaker A: So even those one who some of these tokens also have managers or admins who can change these proportions and they should not affect on user funds. So the next big chapter is lending. So I see here three different types, as I said, borrowing, leverage and lottery, and how usually lending behaves. There are some order book based lending protocols, but I don't include them since they're not quite useful. Because if you have all these different options for lendings and borrowings based on orders, you can't make this liquidity fungible among all the users. But decentralized lending protocols which are pool based like compound, fulcrum, Ave and deforce and maybe some others, they works in the similar manner and they have wrapper tokens. So if you want to put your die into these protocols, you can convert this die into CDI without any slippage for some fixed price which is actual for this smart contract right now.
00:17:05.706 - 00:18:04.170, Speaker A: And yeah, you can put your wrap your tokens into for example for compound it's CDI for avid Adai. So you can wrap your die into CDI and you will start earning immediately. Because those people who put tokens wrap their tokens, they are providing liquidity for those who want to borrow. So those who borrow pays to those who provided this liquidity. And the cool thing is how these payments occur. They are not like happens in some moments when you for example, borrow. For example, you can put $100 of ether into collateral and you will get some amount of sea ether which is like equivalent to your ether and growing.
00:18:04.170 - 00:19:12.290, Speaker A: And you can borrow some dies from CDI pool and you will be able to borrow less than you compounded, less than you collateralized. So sure you can borrow more than $1,000 if you have $1,000 collateral, but when you get some amount of die, for example, you borrowed 100 of die, the amount you should return is continuously growing based on yearly APR and yearly APR is dependent on how many funds inside this pool are provided and how many funds of this provided liquidity is already borrowed. The more borrowed, the higher will be interest rate. The more people will try to put liquidity to earn this high APR. The less borrowed, the less will be APR. And the more people will try to borrow because APR is really low like few persons. Yeah.
00:19:12.290 - 00:19:58.514, Speaker A: So your debt is always increasing and you can never pay it out, but you will not be able also extract your collateral. And your collateral should be always higher than your debt. If your debt will reach like 90% of collateral, you will be liquidated. So your collateral will be swapped onto die and return it to the pool and you will have nothing. Yeah. So that's how works borrowing. You have some funds, you can put it into collateral, you can get some debt and you will get these tokens from debt on your hands.
00:19:58.514 - 00:20:45.090, Speaker A: So if you put ether, you will have tokenize it as collateral fee ever. And you will have also borrowed die on YOur hands. And you will not be able to move this c ether from your wallet. Because every time you try to move collateral, it checks. If you have depth and you will not be able to move your collateral out to YOuR Wallet, maybe you will be able to move some part of your collateral. So that's how it works. And one more interesting idea is based on these lending protocols is leverage.
00:20:45.090 - 00:22:00.074, Speaker A: How we can create like a leveraged position. It is that if we for example, have one thousand dollars k of for example, ether, and we want to create long on ether to die, we can churn our position, our one thousand k of bucks, we can churn it to ether of collateral and 2000 of k of die debt. So, difference of Your collateral ANd YOur debt is Your funds. If we will compare with the previous image, you will see that you have some borrowed amount on your hand. And the reason you open this position is that you need these assets. But when you are creating leverage, you don't need some assets on hand, you need to have a lot of other, for example, collateralized, compounded, okay? And if price of other will grow for 5%, you will earn 15% because this ether is yours. But if price will drop 5%, you will lose 15%.
00:22:00.074 - 00:22:26.260, Speaker A: So leverage, this is three x leverage showed on the picture. And it increases your opportunities and also your loses. Yeah. So some people use leverage when they are very sure what will happen to price. They can create long on ever to die or they can long die to ever. This will be like shorting ever to die. It's the same.
00:22:26.260 - 00:23:38.330, Speaker A: And lending protocols works for this. So how you can create this position? You can put your assets into collateral, get some depth, then convert this debt into either again and put it as collateral, then extract, get more depth and convert it again. You can repeat this, or you can even achieve the same with some tools like we built on hackathon one xag. It allows you to do the same with a single short transaction with single conversion inside it. It works with flash loans. You could imagine if you have 1000, we can have flash loan for two additional thousand of die, convert it, put it as collateral, get some debt, get borrowing, then swap this borrowing to ever and return flash loan so the same could be achieved like with flash borrowed funds. So this needs just one iteration? In this case, yeah.
00:23:38.330 - 00:24:22.434, Speaker A: And next thing is lottery based it on lending. Since your collateralized assets are growing always. So price of c ever to ever is always growing. Price of c die to die is always growing. So if you for example borrowed something, your debt is growing continuously. And if you collateralize something, converted your Dai into CDI, you also earning on this. Because those people who borrowed Dai pays APR to those who put this liquidity collateralized their DAi.
00:24:22.434 - 00:25:14.850, Speaker A: So lottery is the thing where funds of users are stored in compound and all the persons of overall users is like a price for random person. So I don't really know the numbers, but it looks like you can win like few hundred dollars in a week, or maybe $1,000 in a week. You should check it's pull together project. Yeah, so it seems my presentation is completed. So if you have any questions. Welcome.
00:25:15.220 - 00:25:46.110, Speaker C: Yeah, so I have one question about your opinion on stablecoins being locked collateral, something like an actual dollar or a foreign currency in a bank was on your presentation versus something that we've seen, which is more of a native stable currency, something with a reverse Dutch option on an inflationary deflationary currency to provide stability to some stable, maybe a little more, maybe circleish, what's your opinion on that?
00:25:48.640 - 00:27:39.136, Speaker A: As I see the centralized stable tokens, they works better. I mean their price is usually close to original, but most of the stable tokens which are centralized also have some cons. You should check each of these tokens if they have blacklisting functionality, because those people who bring these assets into blockchain and those who are going to extract it from blockchain, interacting with this bank account. This is one category of users, but another category of users who will just use this token and will never interact with this bank account and will never have this in mind, they will just use this token in blockchain and benefit from having stable token. They could achieve this with different defi instruments. If someone cares about its assets, like if he have huge enough to become like a target for some KYC, IML or any other procedures, he should possibly check if token source code have blacklisting because I heard of it like a few weeks ago someone stable coins were blacklisted and someone is not able to move his funds to a different wallet just because stable token centralized administrator locked his wallet. We can't know when this could happen or not.
00:27:39.136 - 00:28:30.370, Speaker A: But if stable token for example don't have blacklisting functionality, this is safer for the users. And I really like the stable tokens which are decentralized like makerdao or any other. It seems like a good idea to have this. And I also like that we have everything. I mean we have to choose so you can use one or another. So recently die price pumped a lot because everyone tried to buy die to liquidate some positions and price is not yet returned to one dollars. It's 1% higher now.
00:28:30.370 - 00:29:00.730, Speaker A: So it's quite difficult to say which is better. So it depends. Sometimes you would like to use decentralized stable token, but its price will not be stable and you will not like to buy it. For example, I would not suggest you to buy die when it's priced 3% higher than one dollars because it can be stabilized and you will just lose 3%.
00:29:01.580 - 00:29:03.256, Speaker C: Yeah, no, that makes sense. Thanks.
00:29:03.358 - 00:29:04.188, Speaker A: By the way, you have a couple.
00:29:04.194 - 00:29:05.352, Speaker C: Of questions in chat.
00:29:05.416 - 00:29:14.190, Speaker A: I don't want to mess still knows either as much.
00:29:18.400 - 00:29:23.810, Speaker C: It's a Zoom call bomber. You need to mute them.
00:29:24.500 - 00:29:31.190, Speaker A: Quick question. My background image works very fine for this case. Yeah.
00:29:32.520 - 00:29:35.910, Speaker B: Anton, can you remove the daddy because he's just.
00:29:36.600 - 00:29:48.244, Speaker A: I'm not. Dustin is the host. Dustin? Yeah, Dustin. Yeah, I'm working on it. I just am trying to find him. Thank you. Quick question, Anton.
00:29:48.292 - 00:29:57.070, Speaker D: I was wondering about what do you think about the future of Dexs and how they will involve with sharded systems coming live right now.
00:29:58.400 - 00:31:23.320, Speaker A: So when I had talks about future of Dexes with some investors, for example, some of them see that fragmentation of Dexes will grow. Some of them think that some leading Dexes will just became more popular and most of the liquidity will be concentrated on them. But as far as I see that new automated market makers appears like Curve happened a few weeks ago. It seems like it's cool idea because before blockchain no one had fully autonomous trading system which is like providing liquidity for everyone. So I believe that fragmentation will grow and we will see the more cool projects like pools and different dexes because they fit for different needs. For example, curve works better than any other for stable tokens and it's like separate kind. Maybe we will see more separate kind of pools.
00:31:23.320 - 00:32:33.672, Speaker A: But also you asked it about sharding. I believe we will move to sharded systems in few years. So it will took maybe one two years to have stable charged systems which will be capable to handle users and have enough projects. And yeah, I see that non charged systems could not grow for real users capacity. So for now we see when Ethereum gas price explode on few hundred thousand users simultaneously trying to sell their shitcoins. I believe that sharding is matter for wide adoption. And we will see that some tokens will have bridges to new blockchains and then some projects will be just copied.
00:32:33.672 - 00:33:38.080, Speaker A: And I believe we will see new kind of dexes which will be like sharded Dexes and will actually benefit from sharding. Because if we will put like curve smart contract or uniswap smart contract into sharded system, you will not actually benefit from sharding because transaction capacity of this smart contract will be strictly limited to single shard. It's like still being in Ethereum mainet which is like boosted by using Wasm. Maybe it sounds like it could have hundreds transactions per second, but it's not enough. For example, if you will just put die smart contract to sharded blockchain, having few hundred transactions per second is not enough. Sure. So we will see new smart contracts which will benefit from sharded ecosystems like sharded smart contract architecture.
00:33:38.080 - 00:35:03.006, Speaker A: There are some questions in the chat, so question from Alex. So if my debt exceeds the collateral, the collateral gets liquidated. How is this implemented on the technical level? Does collateral just become unlockable or it is actually getting liquidated? If later it's liquidated. Next time I tell the contract, no system could not track who should be liquidated at this exact moment. So any other user could check this and tell system when someone need to be liquidated. System will check if it's true. This means since your other collateral, for example, and you have diaphragt and you have other collateral, since your actual ether is locked into c ether, you have c ether on balance and this means that you have some ever locked in this cetera smart contract.
00:35:03.006 - 00:36:17.830, Speaker A: This means that they can just change your balance of c ether, get this ether, swap it to die and return this die to the pool and also pay some person to those person who provided this information in time and also put some other part into insurance fund for possible negative liquidations. Because it's also possible when price moves really fast. Your liquidation could be like negative, your debt amount could be higher than collateral amount, and we can use like insurance debt, put extra fees into it and then extract when we need it. Are there any tools to detect cycles of depth that have been collateralized? Cycles? I'm not sure what you mean because you can always have several collaterals and several depths. No one really remembers when you put your collateral, get debt, convert it to collateral asset and put it as collateral. Again, no one remembers this. A system only remembers your debt.
00:36:17.830 - 00:37:38.530, Speaker A: Total debt in each asset and total collateral in each asset is just your balance of c either CDI. We also can have depth assets which like tokenization of the debt. No one did it before for some reason, but it's quite simple. You should just deny transfer of this token to anyone because transferring debt to random person is not good idea, but having transfer from should be allowed. You can grab someone debts someone's debt if you have enough collateral to cover it. And we can have reverse ERC 20 for this to allow people to transfer debt if they have approves and transfer from to self without approves. What are the major security and structural problems in DeFi? Maybe this is a problem that some smart contracts could have some problems with logic or have some bugs and some funds could be stolen.
00:37:38.530 - 00:38:48.454, Speaker A: And the problem is not in single project, but since all these projects are involved in hold the DeFi and utilize each other, this could be a problem for several projects. Bug in one project and losing funds or locking funds could produce a lot of projects to many other systems. So that's why it matter to have security audits. What other decentralized stable coins without blacklist function? You know, actually we have just to check source code of few ones. This would take up to ten minutes to check five stable coins, I believe. I don't really remember which have and don't want to tell you incorrect information for now. Okay, other questions I'm Anup.
00:38:48.454 - 00:39:02.120, Speaker A: What is the way to break into this field? Not really understand what you mean break into. Are you going to use it? Are you going to develop it for DeFi or any other?
00:39:06.510 - 00:39:12.090, Speaker B: I think you skip the question like do you know any other decentralized stable coins without blacklisting?
00:39:14.910 - 00:39:20.254, Speaker A: No, I just answered that I don't really remember.
00:39:20.452 - 00:39:21.600, Speaker B: Okay, sorry.
00:39:22.290 - 00:40:01.210, Speaker A: It's decentralized. Okay. I heard it was centralized decentralized. For now I can remember decentralized stable tokens like Dai like synthetics synthetics platform have stablecoin to USD it's SUSD and I don't really remember much of them but we can find them. About also breaking into. You can start with website like DeFi prime. It has enough information to read and to know about different projects.
00:40:01.210 - 00:41:43.650, Speaker A: Okay, is it possible to get a record of this webinar? I believe we are making record recording to share it later. It has some categorized listing of DeFi projects. I did my own categorization based on primitives, internal primitives because for me borrowing and leverage is just the same. What do you think are currently missing in DeFi space projects ideas? I believe that we will see a lot of new DeFi projects which never existed before and maybe we will see this in these categories or they will introduce any own. And I see some of the projects could benefit by joining two different ideas. Like if you try to join payment streams with leverage, maybe you could achieve something. You should think of it first and decide maybe you can get new DeFi stories which will be interesting to users, maybe not.
00:41:43.650 - 00:42:09.240, Speaker A: So if you combine stable coins with leverage, we recently discussed this opportunity to create leverage. Like if die price pump it by 3%, you could just short it to USDC with some leverage like five x and you could earn 15% when die price will be stabilized.
00:42:13.490 - 00:42:30.930, Speaker D: Anton maybe you can share a little bit from your one inch experience on overall entrepreneurship journey. And if some people want to start projects in defi space but don't know where to start or how to find co founder or anything else, maybe you can share a little bit about your personal journey and learnings.
00:42:32.070 - 00:43:30.646, Speaker A: I personally think that project could not appear like to became a working project in Defi without having an idea and having in mind how it should exactly work. Because if you have just few ideas that you're trying to achieve something strange. I actually saw this few times. I saw a few white papers of few people who sent me these white papers and asked it to read it. Sashim, we still can see you. So I was in a situation when someone sent me white paper and I'm trying to read it and I can't even understand what happens. Why I can see such buzwords like some pools, leverage lending something else.
00:43:30.646 - 00:44:25.430, Speaker A: I can get the main idea and asking how are you going to achieve this? What is the core idea? You mentioned a lot of buzwords but they all makes no sense, which is each other. It's like dark pool with leverage. Something else. I don't even know what is dark pool, how it should work I asked him and he don't know. He told me, maybe you can develop it. I just wrote a white paper and I think this whole idea. I also got some responses from few other projects that they like the idea, but I can't get the idea until you have technical detail how exactly it should solve some problems, because you always see some problems which stops you from doing this.
00:44:25.430 - 00:44:42.400, Speaker A: And you should know exact solution for these problems. Else you can't run a project or you can just even get funds from someone. Find co founder, find team and start building something. I'm not sure you will be able to build it.
00:44:49.010 - 00:44:54.500, Speaker D: What's the plan for one inch also going forward fund?
00:44:55.510 - 00:44:56.930, Speaker A: Can you repeat?
00:44:57.830 - 00:45:01.860, Speaker D: What's the plan for one inch overall going forward for the rest of this year?
00:45:03.110 - 00:46:02.278, Speaker A: For one inch? We have a couple of projects in mind. We're working on them internally and we're going to release as much features and projects as we could because there is so small amount of projects implemented in DeFi and we see opportunities. And we started with hackathons on the previous year and on each hackathon we tried to deliver like a fully working mvp of something. It's like the app with some smart contracts and front end. And I believe that most of the projects which we build are working now. No one uses them because they are not like popular, but they should work. If I'll open the browser I will find them working.
00:46:02.278 - 00:46:29.680, Speaker A: And this makes sense for me that building cool small projects is working and we should find which projects could have a good traction. So we will try different projects and those projects which will give us good traction, we will work on them.
00:46:30.450 - 00:46:47.560, Speaker B: And just one of the examples, that one inch actually was born at the ETH New York hackathon. And the judges, none of the judges was able to recognize the potential of such a cool idea. So it just gives us an example that the current hackathon space.
00:46:49.770 - 00:46:50.434, Speaker A: They cannot.
00:46:50.482 - 00:46:55.880, Speaker B: See all the projects and recognize the value that they can bring to the market.
00:46:57.310 - 00:47:51.690, Speaker A: Yeah, this happens time to time. But if you believe, and you could see some traction that users start using your project, then I believe you could spend few months on it and you will see how new users appears even without having a marketing budget. Because we build one inch without spending even a bucks for marketing. We just posted a lot of tweets for each feature. We just built the community behind the one inch and delivered the product. About the New York hackathon, I guess it's my bad. I guess it was my bad that I really explained very bad and presented in a bad manner.
00:47:51.690 - 00:48:05.040, Speaker A: So no one really understood what I present there, except a few guys like Liam from I guess. My.
00:48:14.840 - 00:48:22.970, Speaker B: There is a question in the chat. Like Anton, could you point us to a few of your defi projects that you think we should look at?
00:48:24.140 - 00:49:08.216, Speaker A: Okay, first of all, you should try any lending platform. If you did not tried it before, like compound fulcrum, you should just try to better understand how exactly it works. Maybe you should look also on synthetics platform to see why it differs and what's special with it. I can point you give you a clue about this. You can swap any synth to any synth with zero slippage, but with a fixed fee. I don't remember, maybe 0.3% or 0.2,
00:49:08.216 - 00:50:16.000, Speaker A: but you will have a zero slippage on any amount because they will burn your source synth asset and mint your destination synth asset by the current price from Oracle. Yeah. Also maybe token sets. It's quite interesting. It is mentioned here they do have some different strategies, and they have like USDC Etherdai token, which flips on some RSI values and it earns more than holding, so it sometimes behaves like this. This is not financial advice, but I mean, you have to check it to see how exactly it works. Maybe you like it.
00:50:16.000 - 00:51:58.150, Speaker A: Which of these can be built on near, improved or better if built on near? As I said, near is a sharded blockchain of next generation of blockchains and any of existing projects. Not any, but most of the existing projects could be like moved copied on near. But we still need to learn how to actually benefit from sharding on sharded blockchains. Because as I said, having die token on near, which will have several hundred transactions per second, is not enough to have like a global payment currency, because every teapot will send die in next ten years. And it's like we have to build sharded token and sharded dexes and sharded projects. We have a couple of ideas about this, and maybe we will show it in the upcoming events. Are there any other questions? If not, I guess we can start wrapping it up.
00:51:58.150 - 00:52:10.530, Speaker A: I have no questions. Go for it. Yeah, it.
