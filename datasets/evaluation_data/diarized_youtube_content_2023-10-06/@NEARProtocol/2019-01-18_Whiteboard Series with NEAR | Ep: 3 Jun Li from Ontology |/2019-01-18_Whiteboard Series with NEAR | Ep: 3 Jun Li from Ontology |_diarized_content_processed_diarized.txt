00:00:04.010 - 00:00:18.890, Speaker A: Hi everybody, it's Alex and Ilya from Nier. And we are continuing our whiteboarding series today with us Jun Li from. Do you want to talk a little bit about yourself and then ontology?
00:00:19.050 - 00:00:32.834, Speaker B: Yeah. Everyone, I'm Liu Jung actually is my family name. It's maybe in United States. You can call me Jung Li as well. And I'm founder of Ontology. Also is co founder of Onchain. On chain is the earliest technical company in China.
00:00:32.834 - 00:01:02.922, Speaker B: Blockchain technical company on China. Yeah, I actually work for the IT and the fintech fields before the ontology and on Chin. I'm working for the CFEX China Financial Future Exchange, China's largest traditional financial exchange. Design the exchange system and something. And five years ago, I guess I case leading blockchain, some investigation team and I think, okay, it's a huge things in that time. It's not huge things. No one knows blockchain, only know bitcoin.
00:01:02.922 - 00:01:17.650, Speaker B: So I built on chain. On chain is another co founder is Dungfei, is the founder of Neo. So we build on chain to private technical service in China, globally. And also we private public chain service like ontology.
00:01:18.410 - 00:01:33.018, Speaker A: All right, great. So let's start super high level. Do you want to describe how pretty much ontology model works from perspective of what's a civil attack resistance consensus algorithm. And we can expand from there?
00:01:33.104 - 00:01:54.190, Speaker B: Yeah, I can do a very brief. The architecture, very brief introduction. First, ontology is kind of multiple chain. It's not only one chance, it's multiple chains. It means they have different. We have the public chain here, right? Public chain is there. In this chain, we are using consensus model called VBFT.
00:01:54.190 - 00:02:17.158, Speaker B: VBFT. This one is depose plus Vif. Vif is verifiable. The random functionality and the BFT. Okay, but it's chain network. We call them business chain or subchain. It's just fine.
00:02:17.158 - 00:02:44.026, Speaker B: And different chain is here. It's chain network. And the chain network, they can use different consensus models. We private the modalized consensus models, for example, they can use. Okay, I can use just very simple depose all those kind of things. Or just use BFT base like the DBFT or other dedicated DBFT, those kind of things. And they have protocols to intact each other.
00:02:44.026 - 00:03:13.706, Speaker B: The protocols, currently they can exchange the assets, of course. And next protocols is data. And in the future, we want to also do the transaction. The transaction is not only like bitcoin is transaction assets. Transaction means if you have a business process, this one can do the step one. This one can do the step two this kind of things. Yeah.
00:03:13.706 - 00:04:21.630, Speaker B: This is basic architecture. And for the infrastructure parts, this is our, we can call them blockchain infrastructure in this part, but ontology is actually two platform. Can I use it? This platform is above the infrastructure. We call them is trust collaboration platform. They include a lot of modules. Meaning modules include did decentralized identity modules, DDXF is disputed, data exchange framework and this is reputation system and also on sign. Currently have more module coming onto sign is electronic contract and the signature service.
00:04:21.630 - 00:04:28.226, Speaker B: All those things which we do. This platform is for do real business. Real business.
00:04:28.328 - 00:04:33.022, Speaker A: Yeah. So this is all like smart contracts pretty much on top of the smart contract.
00:04:33.086 - 00:04:44.054, Speaker B: And it both is best on smart contract. But have it be modularized and be the flexible functionality. And to do that, those two parts platform is on torch platform to do that.
00:04:44.172 - 00:04:55.514, Speaker A: So is this modules in any way part of the runtime for the actual, what runs on a blockchain or this is just a code that you can change? Kind of.
00:04:55.712 - 00:05:09.454, Speaker B: Currently all those module is runtime. But of course you can use as a framework build your owner in some private environment or some enterprise level environment. I see.
00:05:09.572 - 00:05:12.698, Speaker A: All right, let's go deeper in this public chain circle.
00:05:12.874 - 00:05:36.034, Speaker B: Okay. Yeah. One more highlight. One thing is for the scalability for public blockchain, we are doing two things. One is shutting. We just released our shutdown design. The shutdown can support in this part here support networking, network shutting and transaction shutting.
00:05:36.034 - 00:05:56.574, Speaker B: And more important, state charging, state shutting. They can support smart contract. This part, this is shutting. And now behind that we have the dispute storage storage service. Dispute storage service and the state channel. This is if the layer one have a layer two. Currently have one.
00:05:56.574 - 00:06:11.870, Speaker B: Layer two is station. Station. It's a little bit like the plasma, but I have another design. And of course we are working for another stage two China protocol. We're released in next quarter.
00:06:11.950 - 00:06:12.354, Speaker A: I see.
00:06:12.392 - 00:06:12.834, Speaker B: Okay.
00:06:12.952 - 00:06:13.314, Speaker A: All right.
00:06:13.352 - 00:06:15.038, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a specific architecture.
00:06:15.134 - 00:06:16.050, Speaker A: Yeah, that's pretty good.
00:06:16.120 - 00:06:32.726, Speaker C: So when you say smart contract, state sharding. So let's say I have cryptokitties, smart contract. Will the cryptokitties. So let's say I have cryptokitties and I have some distributed exchange. So they can live on two different shards. Right. But cryptokitty as a contract will always live on a single shard.
00:06:32.726 - 00:06:36.134, Speaker C: Or the contract itself can be living on multiple shards.
00:06:36.182 - 00:07:03.780, Speaker B: Yeah, actually they have a message between the shards. Right. We have a message between the shards. Can quickly share the message. Another, they have the Merck based verification survey verification protocol. They can use every shard to verify the status of the.
00:07:04.230 - 00:07:17.058, Speaker C: So that's how they would communicate. Yeah, communicate, but each of them would live on a single shard. Yeah, it's not like the crypto kit is. The contract itself can be sharded into multiple shards.
00:07:17.154 - 00:07:19.142, Speaker B: You mean content can be sharded for.
00:07:19.276 - 00:07:21.490, Speaker A: The data of the single contract.
00:07:21.570 - 00:07:37.310, Speaker B: Single contract, yeah. Currently contract in different short, your country design and welcome to sorry hypercheck. You can choose onto the tile and the shutting. You can check the paper and the design for that. Okay.
00:07:37.380 - 00:08:09.194, Speaker A: Yeah, I actually briefly checked it out before. Actually I'm really interested to start with this because there's a lot of kind of conversations on how to use vrfs for the consensus and would really love to kind of dive in into that. Can you describe in a way, let's say from one node perspective, one of the validator node perspectives, how's the process of pretty much coming up with a consensus in the next block happening?
00:08:09.312 - 00:08:29.866, Speaker B: Okay, first of course have a depose. Right. And depose. You can be a note or to validate note. And one is of course your suppose mechanism, another is reputation. And you can select. They have a lot of candidates.
00:08:29.866 - 00:08:30.906, Speaker B: Candidate.
00:08:31.018 - 00:08:32.638, Speaker A: So candidates say, hey, I want to.
00:08:32.644 - 00:09:03.242, Speaker B: Be a. Yeah, you have to be the nose join and the candidate post can be from yourself or the community, other members contribute for you and this one. And also you involve some contribution. Contribution is based on how stable your service private in history or those countries. And then UF becomes a shortlist, maybe currently it's around 40. Yeah, 40 nodes around. Finally this is consensus node group.
00:09:03.242 - 00:09:31.170, Speaker B: And then they have to the VRF process. They can use random, verifiable random functionality to select the nodes from the candidate. Maybe five to meeting. They can select 210 nodes every round and based on the use of ViF and then they can use BFT to got finalized, confirm the transaction.
00:09:31.750 - 00:09:33.938, Speaker A: So which VRF are you using?
00:09:34.104 - 00:09:40.886, Speaker B: It's similar like definity but yeah, it's similar extension. We have an implementation based on that.
00:09:40.908 - 00:09:46.850, Speaker A: I see, so you're using bls like threshold signature.
00:09:46.930 - 00:09:47.560, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:09:48.250 - 00:09:56.330, Speaker A: So for threshold signatures these guys need to exchange, generate separate set of keys for this group, right?
00:09:56.400 - 00:09:56.970, Speaker B: Yes.
00:09:57.120 - 00:10:09.760, Speaker A: And when is that done? On a timeline. Let's say this selection happened and then the previous nodes working and then these guys are generating. How long does it take?
00:10:12.130 - 00:10:26.850, Speaker B: Is every notes we have 5 seconds. They have runs for selection and for the book check that candy is based on this period.
00:10:27.990 - 00:10:32.270, Speaker A: So you switch nodes, you regenerate every 5 seconds.
00:10:32.350 - 00:10:53.514, Speaker B: No, the generate broke can be and we can select nodes from that. But for the candidate pool and they will operate maybe 120k is a brox and we will have a change around based on the selection.
00:10:53.562 - 00:10:54.014, Speaker A: I see.
00:10:54.052 - 00:10:58.158, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe around less than one month, I guess. Two weeks, I guess.
00:10:58.244 - 00:11:06.818, Speaker A: Okay, so it's two weeks period. The next group has time to regenerate the keys prepare. All right. Awesome.
00:11:06.904 - 00:11:18.278, Speaker B: This is a need for that, but shutting. Have another shutting. Consensus is called PVBFT. And yes, you can check the paper. Yes, maybe. Okay, interesting.
00:11:18.364 - 00:11:28.310, Speaker A: And then. So let's say we have this ten nodes, right? How does everybody on the network know which these ten nodes or transactions are flooded across everybody.
00:11:28.460 - 00:11:36.778, Speaker B: Yes, it currently is across everybody. And they have a candidate on order know who is less wrong. They will got information from that.
00:11:36.864 - 00:11:37.322, Speaker A: I see.
00:11:37.376 - 00:11:40.620, Speaker B: Yeah. Interesting.
00:11:41.250 - 00:11:55.330, Speaker A: Okay. I would love to go deeper into sharding paper. Yeah, I saw you guys doing exponential sharding, right? Yeah, pretty much. You have hierarchy of shards.
00:11:55.750 - 00:11:57.166, Speaker B: Hierarchy shards.
00:11:57.358 - 00:12:02.354, Speaker A: You have pretty much shards that have parent shards and they.
00:12:02.472 - 00:12:19.430, Speaker B: Yeah, it's just like a mock tree. And you can give a status check. And also you have the message between sharding can easily got the information basically the tree route and the status and to do a verification, et cetera.
00:12:20.570 - 00:12:41.360, Speaker A: Can you explain maybe more, how is that exactly happening? Because the main problem with sharding is that if one shard is malicious. Right. The validators are malicious. They can tell everybody else that hey, here's a state. All of us have billion dollars now, trust us. So how does everybody else verify that.
00:12:41.890 - 00:13:03.400, Speaker B: They have a route? Actually, to be honest, I am not very involved for the Shadow Avenue research team. But they have verified validator process to all the messages. The message can be verified by other shots to do that. Okay, yeah, you can check detail for paper. Cool.
00:13:04.490 - 00:13:22.238, Speaker A: All right. Other interesting parts that. What is the smart contract platform are you using? How does runtime integrate and things like that?
00:13:22.324 - 00:13:55.202, Speaker B: Actually we can to say multiple smart contract platform. One is called NVM. NVM is. We have joined the team, group technique team with Neo. And we build VM together. We call them MVM, but they have a different implementation. The NVM is like UVM, but more light and more functionality and more codes, more operation codes.
00:13:55.202 - 00:14:25.810, Speaker B: We implemented go level and NVM. NVM. We have a lot of computers. They can do the passing, right. We can convert the code to be the memo code by code. And they can support. Can't support the passenger and go js java.
00:14:25.810 - 00:14:59.974, Speaker B: You can use all those language to build the smart contract based on the MVM another is called ontology. Currently it's in our testnet. Wasam can support C and C and rust. Yeah, this is standards, but we use go to country working. Another VM is called risk v structure. It's also based on this structure. Have a new vm.
00:14:59.974 - 00:15:13.760, Speaker B: We are doing that. And finally all those kind of vm we can do integrated in one platform. That means you can use different mechanism, deploy your smart contract in different vm to do that. Interesting.
00:15:14.470 - 00:15:19.006, Speaker A: I'm really interested how you guys doing Python conversion into a vm?
00:15:19.118 - 00:15:30.230, Speaker B: Yeah, we have a program you have finished a passing code and the code will be compared with to convert become bytecode.
00:15:30.810 - 00:15:36.978, Speaker A: Usually for bytecode you need like types. For optimal bytecode.
00:15:37.074 - 00:15:41.962, Speaker B: We've done it by myself. We have a passing. Yes, we can convert this.
00:15:42.016 - 00:15:46.346, Speaker A: So not all of the Python will go through. Right, because reflection doesn't work.
00:15:46.448 - 00:15:52.746, Speaker B: Yeah, they have a specific, can be.
00:15:52.768 - 00:15:55.434, Speaker A: A subset of subset of Python because.
00:15:55.552 - 00:15:57.950, Speaker B: We need to keep some security and something.
00:15:58.020 - 00:15:59.998, Speaker A: Yeah. And same for JavaScript. Yeah.
00:16:00.084 - 00:16:06.414, Speaker B: We all have the convert for this language and become the backcode and we can deploy for that.
00:16:06.532 - 00:16:07.458, Speaker A: That's really interesting.
00:16:07.544 - 00:16:07.890, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:16:07.960 - 00:16:16.530, Speaker A: And what's the performance like from perspective of if I write the same program in Python and go how fast will it run on the view the different.
00:16:16.600 - 00:17:00.734, Speaker B: Language is actually nosome because the converter is not doing online or runtime. Before you deploy the smart contract, the converter have been done. So the running performance for different languages similar. This VM currently is implemented by Go and the whole TPS in ten nodes. We're testing is currently in the normal environment and the country is ten key, eleven key. But if the networking condition is not good, maybe we are lower down to the seven k around this TPS.
00:17:00.862 - 00:17:05.890, Speaker C: Is it payment transactions? Yeah, and that's a single shirt.
00:17:06.310 - 00:17:07.486, Speaker B: What do you mean single shot?
00:17:07.518 - 00:17:08.002, Speaker C: Single short.
00:17:08.056 - 00:17:30.166, Speaker B: One short in one shot county is 1 minute. Your ten note is one shot. Yeah. If you use different shots plots together. It's not a real TPS. TPS in the single network for BFT based. If you're not a BFT based, the consensus will be more quick because you can easily know lots of communication between nodes.
00:17:30.166 - 00:17:44.206, Speaker B: You can easily do to increase, for example, I only have deposits and we can very higher performance for that. But normally PF base that is quite good performance right now if we can reach this one.
00:17:44.308 - 00:17:56.370, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean this is pretty interesting because this is if all the nodes in the same subnetwork I'm assuming was a good connection. Right. Because if you put them kind of in different places in the world. Just the latency.
00:17:58.490 - 00:18:08.690, Speaker B: Because for consensus process the networking cost is important cost actually if the cost they will be lowered down to even lower more.
00:18:08.860 - 00:18:29.034, Speaker A: How many round trips does your consensus take between. So you have, let's say ten nodes, right. When they elect it through VRF till the block is published and broadcasted. How many communications between nodes happening round.
00:18:29.082 - 00:18:35.070, Speaker B: Right round is kind of forerunt for round foreign.
00:18:36.230 - 00:18:41.794, Speaker A: So this involves like this is at this moment whatever transactions they had, they pretty much exchange information.
00:18:41.992 - 00:18:49.370, Speaker B: Actually the transaction. You mean the round transaction is not networking transaction is higher cost for the TPS.
00:18:49.470 - 00:18:49.830, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:18:49.900 - 00:18:52.854, Speaker B: That is things nowhere in this one.
00:18:52.892 - 00:18:57.798, Speaker A: Yeah, because your transaction is probably like what 120 bytes or something. So that's already like.
00:18:57.884 - 00:19:14.014, Speaker B: So the consensus may be not so decentralized like bitcoin or ethereum, but our strategy is want to find some balance between performance and decentralized level. There's no magic. If you want high performance then you.
00:19:14.052 - 00:19:18.270, Speaker A: Have to centralize something, reduce the number of nodes, talk.
00:19:18.340 - 00:19:19.760, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure.
00:19:20.370 - 00:19:28.930, Speaker A: All right. Yeah that's super interesting. So you also mentioned you have like dispute storage as part of your public.
00:19:29.080 - 00:20:10.510, Speaker B: Yeah, we were launching this quarter the dispute storage. Of course we integrated the IPFS protocol as well and added many functionality browsers and it's like we can dispute storage can link together with public chain if you have for example we do the disputed data exchange and for the public chain they only record the transaction, become a connector. But the real data, they can be stored to the it's kind of option. But distributed storage is just option. We also have a centralized storage with the security make sure okay, I have the crypto mechanism help you to control the data and protect data.
00:20:10.580 - 00:20:13.200, Speaker A: So it's like encrypted storage? Pretty much, yeah.
00:20:15.570 - 00:20:51.610, Speaker B: Another thing just I mentioned we have a trust collaboration platform. They have disputed data identity framework and dispute. Even if you manage your own personal data, a lot of data maybe is in different source in government bank or in your university. You needn't manage that. You only can control that or link to that, that is enough. Plus some personal data is quite by yourself. We have a functionality called the okay called the verifiable climb.
00:20:51.610 - 00:21:48.160, Speaker B: That means for example you can list send a message in blockchain. I'm a blockchain technical expert and this client can manage by yourself and your friends also can prove. Okay, I agree with you. That means those kind of data package you can store by yourself, contribute by yourself, you can use decentralized storage. Okay, I have lots of verifiable client about me personal information I store in the distributed storage, but in blockchain you have some linkage address. Okay, if you wanted to know my technical skills, you can link this link to invoke, yeah, just hash and linkage or address data address in blockchain, but all those data managed by yourself. Since individuals they needed a distributed storage as one of option to manage that data.
00:21:48.930 - 00:21:54.030, Speaker A: So distributed storage is not decentralized, right? You're saying it's not centralized, you run it.
00:21:54.100 - 00:22:23.282, Speaker B: We have two storage service, okay. One is centralized, one is centralized cloud based. But we add a lot of security mechanism, you can protect the data and the crypto functionality be there. Another is decentralized storage, everyone node control just like ipfs and can manage that. And all nodes can got benefits. For example, they can use Ong token to buy some storage space. And all the nodes also have a reputation on Toledge.
00:22:23.282 - 00:22:36.302, Speaker B: If you can be long term and stable service private, you can charge more and you can reward more, something like that. And people can use different option to manage their owner data.
00:22:36.436 - 00:22:45.330, Speaker A: So if one of those providers goes like does something wrong, do they lose just reputation or they lose also part of their stake.
00:22:45.670 - 00:23:06.760, Speaker B: We have a part of stake, bizarre. But also you can private service without states, but when people want to use distributed storage, they can choose, okay, this is high risk, but low price is stable, but maybe it's dependent on them. We can give options to users and.
00:23:07.690 - 00:23:16.214, Speaker A: Pretty much all of this functionality is on one platform, right. So it's available through all of the same APIs and the same from user.
00:23:16.262 - 00:23:26.958, Speaker B: That'S just one platform of course in the behind maybe several platform, many modules, but the user can use in one platform, one process. Interesting.
00:23:27.044 - 00:23:28.800, Speaker A: Yeah, cool.
00:23:34.230 - 00:23:36.638, Speaker C: So shall we talk about validator selection?
00:23:36.734 - 00:23:37.380, Speaker A: Sure.
00:23:39.190 - 00:23:47.794, Speaker C: So the VRF chooses like 1015 people from a large set of validators. How is that large set of validators constructed?
00:23:47.922 - 00:23:56.040, Speaker B: You mean how to select nodes? The validated nodes from that it's most just mentioned is ViF, right.
00:23:56.730 - 00:23:59.990, Speaker C: The question is how the large set of nodes is selected.
00:24:01.690 - 00:24:26.530, Speaker B: It have a mechanism, use pos, they need a put stick. Bizarre. That's one thing. Another is reputation. Reputation is just mentioned, it's ontology score, right? The node can have their score, it's best. One is stable service, they can provide a stable service in history, no mistake or no shutdown or those kind of thing. Another is their contribution.
00:24:26.530 - 00:24:57.366, Speaker B: For example, the nodes have a link to a lot of. Yeah, this week we can link to another mechanism called the Dapp store. The DAP store is a real mechanism. It's not only just a name marketing, not a marketing name, it's more like the App Store. Every Dapps can link to some specific anti id. The anti id maybe belong to the nodes, maybe belong to the individual. That is kind of your contribution for the whole ecosystem.
00:24:57.366 - 00:25:23.170, Speaker B: If the nodes or individual, you have more contribution. For example, you link to ten d apps linked to you. Linked to you means some Dapps is developed by you. Or you introduce Dapps to the ontology and based on their transaction and you can got a reputation score. And even your stake is less than the other nodes, you see a higher rank. So that is balance between reputation and the stake.
00:25:23.910 - 00:25:38.278, Speaker C: So a couple of questions. One is, what would prevent me from uploading a lot of bogus distributed applications and having my other accounts transact with them, build up my reputation and then use that?
00:25:38.364 - 00:25:52.574, Speaker B: Good question. Why you have this question? Because like us or some chuang, they actually no gas fee. Everyone can think, okay, I can quickly make a lot of transaction by myself at a lot account, but we still.
00:25:52.612 - 00:25:56.430, Speaker C: Have a gas fee. I see, so it is possible, it just would be expensive.
00:25:58.210 - 00:26:10.580, Speaker B: Yes. If you do that, your cost will higher than your benefits. It's not economically reasonable. So you're needed not necessary to do that.
00:26:11.110 - 00:26:25.814, Speaker C: And so now let's say I was selected through the VRF and someone submits a transaction. So I need to submit a transaction to become, to get into the pool of validators, right? The staking is a transaction, right?
00:26:25.852 - 00:26:26.440, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:26:27.450 - 00:26:46.000, Speaker C: Why as a validator who was selected through the RF, don't I have an incentive to censor your transaction? Because if I don't censor your transaction, you get to the pool, you reduce my chance of becoming a validator in the future, right? Like why I as a validator, not just censor your transaction out and not.
00:26:50.210 - 00:27:22.780, Speaker B: Those kind of mechanism, just select validating the nodes, right? The nodes, every round the vi for we are involving for everyone to select different nodes to work together. But they have already in a short list in this part. So they have two stage to become everyone final validating group. And you actually difficult to control in this part, but you can try to the final group for that.
00:27:24.030 - 00:27:47.154, Speaker C: But my question is. So let's say I was already selected through the DRF, right? So I'm one of the ten people creating a block. And so there's nine others with me. Actually first question is, so let's say I staked and so I'm in this large pool of validators from whom VRF is selecting, right?
00:27:47.192 - 00:27:47.780, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:27:48.790 - 00:27:52.770, Speaker C: The bigger this large pool, the less likely I am to be selected.
00:27:55.110 - 00:27:59.460, Speaker B: You mean if the pool is very large, you're difficult to be.
00:27:59.830 - 00:28:04.870, Speaker C: What I'm saying is that it is in my interest not to make the pool larger, right?
00:28:04.940 - 00:28:05.318, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:28:05.404 - 00:28:11.320, Speaker C: So if someone is submitting a staking transaction, it is in my best interest to pretend they don't see it.
00:28:12.490 - 00:28:49.286, Speaker B: Okay, you mean the pool too large, you're difficult to be select by yourself, right. This kind of mechanism is for example the shortlist, right. They will got benefits from, for example, the gas fee will return to the nodes even less round. You are not showing for the validation and you not be selected for the validating. Of course you can do some signature and some things, but you are not in the final validating nodes. You also can got reward from guests, become maybe your standby. You are ready for that.
00:28:49.286 - 00:28:55.320, Speaker B: You also got the benefit for that. So this is not owning for the. They have a balance between that.
00:28:57.930 - 00:29:06.634, Speaker C: Do you like random models? Is it the case that my benefit from including someone is strictly bigger than the benefit of not including them?
00:29:06.832 - 00:29:11.098, Speaker B: You mean our team to including you include someone?
00:29:11.264 - 00:29:18.346, Speaker C: Is it the case that for me as the validator chosen by the VRF, it is more beneficial to include the staking transaction than to ignore the staking?
00:29:18.378 - 00:29:27.920, Speaker B: Yes, we're a little bit higher, but not means other guys not got credit. Okay, cool.
00:29:29.650 - 00:29:49.952, Speaker C: And when people are dating. So let's say I was chosen by the VRF, what will be considered, in which case will it be slashed? So if I do double signing, that's a slashable behavior, right?
00:29:50.006 - 00:29:50.704, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:29:50.902 - 00:29:54.960, Speaker C: What if I'm just offline? Do you slash for being offline?
00:29:56.200 - 00:30:27.180, Speaker B: We have some monitor. The process is like the Fishman in port car. If you do those kind of double sling the things, we'll impact your stake as well. Because we show evidence and your stakes will be checked at. And for the process, of course you find some double signed transaction. This round will be skipped, they will not be finalized. We'll kick off another round maybe.
00:30:27.250 - 00:30:38.800, Speaker C: Yes. Double signing makes sense. Let's say I'm not double signing, I'm just completely offline. So I was chosen by the VRF, it's my turn to be a validator and I'm completely offline. Will it be slashed for being offline?
00:30:40.980 - 00:30:47.110, Speaker B: Currently notes we have just a monitor for that, but not automatically in the runtime to do. Yeah.
00:30:50.920 - 00:31:04.680, Speaker A: So you don't update the reputation if somebody's offline today you mean. So right now if, let's say one of the validators who was supposed to be validating didn't show up. Did you update their reputation?
00:31:05.660 - 00:31:24.370, Speaker B: Yes, this thing reputation also included. Just you mentioned you do some wrong things, reputation will be down, but they do some stable things and the reputation will be higher. So this is reputation where they have an onto score. Beside that have the formula to calculate that.
00:31:26.580 - 00:31:29.504, Speaker A: Is reputation like updated every block? Pretty much.
00:31:29.542 - 00:31:31.212, Speaker B: Or almost every block?
00:31:31.276 - 00:31:35.430, Speaker A: Almost every, almost every block. Just for validators, right. Or for everybody.
00:31:35.800 - 00:31:44.150, Speaker B: Actually this can be calculated for every ant id I see antid there can be a node, also can be an individual.
00:31:45.160 - 00:31:49.408, Speaker A: But you're saying it gets updated every one or two blocks?
00:31:49.504 - 00:32:18.096, Speaker B: Yeah, there will update. But the thing is the repetition of score is kind of logic. The logic needed to be calculation every time and stored through the blockchain. Blockchain have the data, we can do data, right. And once you want to know which ids reputation, you can query the node data and the calculation maybe off chain or this way. I see, yeah.
00:32:18.278 - 00:32:22.048, Speaker A: So like a node wouldn't do this calculation problem.
00:32:22.214 - 00:32:36.630, Speaker B: Yeah, some nodes do, some nodes don't do some nodes. Okay. I private some reputation query service quickly and they will do the logic calculation in their nodes, private service to others. But that's not must have to do.
00:32:37.240 - 00:32:40.680, Speaker A: But you do need to do it when you're doing selection of the validators. Right.
00:32:40.750 - 00:33:00.440, Speaker B: That needed to do, but that's wrong. Just a minute, maybe two weeks we will do the calculation and we have service to do calculation and send. And every two weeks other nodes also check the calculation is correct or not and finalize selection for that. Yeah, I see.
00:33:00.530 - 00:33:06.528, Speaker A: So pretty much you have a service that gives the answer but then everybody else can like fisherman it and check.
00:33:06.614 - 00:33:31.130, Speaker B: Yeah, fisherman can check because you got people just results calculated by yourself. They can use the same data calculator and basic roles. The calculator again, everyone can check and even other people, not in that, just an individual, our community member. They also can do the calculator by myself. Okay, this one is wrong. Who is not so higher. They can figure out that.
00:33:32.540 - 00:33:37.628, Speaker A: Is there a way to punish pretty much the service that provided the wrong data?
00:33:37.714 - 00:33:43.404, Speaker B: Yeah, if wrong data and they can figure it out and they have improvement evidence, they got some.
00:33:43.602 - 00:33:46.750, Speaker A: How does that pretty much dispute would work.
00:33:47.840 - 00:33:48.796, Speaker B: You mean the.
00:33:48.898 - 00:33:58.316, Speaker A: Yeah, so let's say the service, you say it posted here is a list, right. Of the preselected nodes.
00:33:58.348 - 00:33:58.784, Speaker B: Right.
00:33:58.902 - 00:34:15.110, Speaker A: And let's say a signature of the service. Now I'm just an individual, I calculated it. I'm saying, hey, this is different. So I have my different list. So how does this dispute will work?
00:34:15.880 - 00:34:50.652, Speaker B: You mean if they have a different. Because for example, formula or the calculation way is open and all the data, input data is in blockchain. They have a consensus confirmed. Everyone can use the formula easily to calculation the result. Even our official team also can open announce the calculation. And it's more like the community based activity. If someone run and people are confirmed easily.
00:34:50.652 - 00:34:51.890, Speaker B: Calculation again.
00:34:52.520 - 00:35:08.804, Speaker A: Yeah. So I understand that they can do calculation, but after, let's say community confirmed this was wrong. Do you send a transaction saying this is wrong? Who signs that? Who punishes the county?
00:35:08.852 - 00:35:10.360, Speaker B: We have an off chain process.
00:35:10.430 - 00:35:11.880, Speaker A: I see. Off chain, yeah, to do that.
00:35:11.950 - 00:35:21.310, Speaker B: But we are announced finally. But the selection will be a transaction to all the current tv concerned nodes. People know, okay. They will verify the calculation result.
00:35:21.680 - 00:35:25.256, Speaker A: Let's say, okay, this was wrong. Everybody agreed.
00:35:25.368 - 00:35:26.030, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:35:26.480 - 00:35:32.540, Speaker A: People need to change something in their node then to punish it. How do you input it back into blockchain?
00:35:32.620 - 00:36:01.290, Speaker B: Yeah. Currently if the formula or some calculation approach be upgraded, people may be upgraded to the nodes and otherwise currently concern nodes. They will recognize the list and double check confirm that they will have a consensus model for this one. So once they get their transaction, have a concerns model for the new selection for that. But of course you still can challenge for that. But that way county use off chain process to do that.
00:36:01.900 - 00:36:02.648, Speaker A: Okay.
00:36:02.814 - 00:36:08.812, Speaker B: It's more like country. Yes. Foundation will be the proposal and okay, who is wrong?
00:36:08.866 - 00:36:09.324, Speaker A: Who is wrong?
00:36:09.362 - 00:36:16.856, Speaker B: Do you agree and know anyone can be voted and most yes. Financial currency is more power than soft chain.
00:36:16.968 - 00:36:20.076, Speaker A: Has this happened before? You needed to.
00:36:20.258 - 00:36:26.288, Speaker B: Still not okay. Because all the data in blockchain, all the input in blockchain, it's easily to check.
00:36:26.374 - 00:36:33.876, Speaker A: Well, if there is enough lag between people, you can vote in, but can't you?
00:36:33.898 - 00:36:36.630, Speaker B: Not everyone involved, they will check that.
00:36:37.160 - 00:36:44.672, Speaker A: Because pretty much the easiest path to double spend is like fake this, put myself here, create a blog.
00:36:44.736 - 00:36:59.150, Speaker B: That is, it's quite a challenge actually. This blockchain in those kind of decentralized governance process cannot do everything just controlled by technology. You have to involve some incentive and even inform some, sometimes cases off chain process.
00:37:01.760 - 00:37:18.332, Speaker A: All right, cool. Yeah. So one more thing I wanted to discuss was you mentioned that pretty much you have a public chain and you have, I'll call them private.
00:37:18.476 - 00:37:19.170, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:37:20.100 - 00:37:33.510, Speaker A: And you have right now at least a way to exchange assets. But you also want to add data and you want to have transactions that fly through. So how does this work right now and how you envision it working?
00:37:34.460 - 00:38:02.160, Speaker B: You can build your cannot say blockchain. It's like business blockchain network and use ontology framework. I mentioned there are several things we can modularize. When you build your own public blockchain. Modularized means for consensus, no consensus process. You can use different consensus process for that. Another is storage.
00:38:02.160 - 00:38:36.496, Speaker B: You can use different database. For example, currently we are using the level DB or stock DB. They can choose different db for their storage as well. And they can build their own governance model. Governance model also included a token design. They can design their own token design and mechanism. You can do that and build your owner the finished blockchain.
00:38:36.496 - 00:38:49.080, Speaker B: And we have a protocol to exchange assets in your blockchain and ontology. For example Ong. You can also use the protocol to using the different sub blockchains.
00:38:49.160 - 00:38:55.600, Speaker A: So how does protocol work? Because let's know, I say, hey, I moved Ong here and then I made more.
00:38:55.670 - 00:39:16.996, Speaker B: The first version protocol. It's a lot of details. The basic is based on the hashlock. The hashlock you have a put stake in the main net for Ong. And you can issue another token on your mapping to the ong and in the main net ong and a little bit like the state china.
00:39:17.188 - 00:39:18.696, Speaker A: So it's a bridge pretty much, yeah.
00:39:18.718 - 00:39:19.540, Speaker B: It'S kind of a bridge.
00:39:19.620 - 00:39:24.920, Speaker A: Like you lock here ong and you issue here like Ong.
00:39:25.980 - 00:39:54.068, Speaker B: And this is one way. Another way is harsh look. But this is slow way harsh look is okay. They can transfer this one, this one want to change the ong. They have the harsh look protocol. They not issue a new token, but they can directly exchange Ong or to their owner token. For example some BCG this way and use the hashlock to do that.
00:39:54.068 - 00:40:11.272, Speaker B: But this protocol is a slow one. This is high speed. We are using the two protocols and following we are designing other more protocols. Change the data even just mentioned step by step collaboration. Yeah.
00:40:11.326 - 00:40:56.472, Speaker A: So even right now let's say because this is operated by me, right. Let's say I can just go start it up. My consensus is Ilyss and I lock in one ong and then I want to pretty much like public Blockchain will not allow me to exit with more. But what about if it's like, let's say it's some type of asset that is native with my blockchain, right? So let's say I made a thing, I created cryptokitties on it, right? It's on contract and I now created them here, right. There is nothing that's locked here. So there's nothing to validate, how would this work?
00:40:56.606 - 00:40:58.804, Speaker B: You mean you just issue your owner token?
00:40:58.932 - 00:41:02.040, Speaker A: Yeah, so I issue my own, let's say NFT, right?
00:41:02.110 - 00:41:02.730, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:41:03.420 - 00:41:12.350, Speaker A: How does this blockchain will validate some properties of it? Let's say there's a DAX here, right? Like I want to list it on.
00:41:12.720 - 00:41:37.472, Speaker B: The NFT is just based on your reputation. You issue that they actually know the stake for the ong. It depends on your user is trust your token or not. And another thing is of course we have a Dex, they can easily do check. Another is the transaction. Currently they can share the validator, the group. Some validator can support multiple blockchain.
00:41:37.472 - 00:41:51.284, Speaker B: They also can okay your leisure also in some validator process as well. And some transaction or log records. They also can log to the public chain periodically.
00:41:51.412 - 00:41:53.460, Speaker A: I see, that's like more like plasma.
00:41:53.540 - 00:42:00.970, Speaker B: Yeah, like plasma. But the protocol is a little bit different. But the basic idea will be similar. I see.
00:42:02.800 - 00:42:08.124, Speaker A: But the part of plasma, right. Is that you actually start from here and then you check out and check here.
00:42:08.162 - 00:42:38.010, Speaker B: You actually can create, you have to do this here. We want to be more flexible, don't want to control too closely. Yes. To do that because we have another important identity is all those account based or address based is based on the onto id that is important. We want to control more account, not for the SS actually we want to. Okay, you can open for your, you can issue your own SS for the subwoofer chain, but the account always best on the antid you can check together.
00:42:38.700 - 00:42:49.710, Speaker A: So on the storage level, how do you enforce that? Account id here and account id here, like it's the same space.
00:42:50.960 - 00:42:53.452, Speaker B: You mean storage, save that, right?
00:42:53.506 - 00:43:01.410, Speaker A: Yeah. So let's say, I mean there's a storage here which is like Ont is not a public key, right?
00:43:02.660 - 00:43:03.660, Speaker B: You mean antid?
00:43:03.740 - 00:43:06.544, Speaker A: Yeah, antid is public, is a public key.
00:43:06.742 - 00:43:10.700, Speaker B: Not public key, not public key. They have to have some convert.
00:43:10.860 - 00:43:21.110, Speaker A: Yeah. So this is some type of string. And then I have storage here as well on my chain. You said you pretty much want to control that here.
00:43:21.880 - 00:44:02.370, Speaker B: That is just want to do a link. It's kind of a mapping. For example, we have antid, that is not a public key. It's for example some uniqlo id and you can link different count one count, maybe the ont or ong count another, maybe your NFT account. I see they work mapping together, but for the ont this is since they are our sub chain, when they generate account, they're automatically mapping together. That means even in the future you can add, okay, my bank account, my Facebook account, you can prove, okay, all those things belong to me. But the control is by yourself.
00:44:02.370 - 00:44:14.308, Speaker B: People don't know who link who. But you can prove, okay, all those accounts belong to me. I can send my evidence to you use untidy to manage all those kind of link.
00:44:14.474 - 00:44:18.984, Speaker A: And this is done. So like there's one key or set of keys attached to this.
00:44:19.182 - 00:44:31.876, Speaker B: You can have multiple keys. And for example, you have an antid key. One, it's all linked to your different kind of digital assets account. Another key is bank account. But also you can merge.
00:44:31.988 - 00:44:33.836, Speaker A: Merge of antids. Yeah.
00:44:33.858 - 00:44:48.720, Speaker B: For example, you to bank to apply some financial service. Okay, you need to shoe your assets. Okay, I have assets as a bitcoin. I have assets in bank. I also have my degree in university. All those links to my anti id, I can prove all those things.
00:44:48.870 - 00:44:50.610, Speaker A: So how's approving that?
00:44:51.060 - 00:45:20.396, Speaker B: For example, you can link to bitcoin. Or another is for example Twitter, right? Yeah, Twitter. Currently you can link your Twitter account to help prove your Twitter. You can issue a Twitter bizarre. So you can my untidy a link with your signature in your Twitter account and you put the account link to there people to verify can easily, okay, this Twitter have your tweeted and with your untidy, with your signature. Okay, I agree. Okay.
00:45:20.396 - 00:45:22.908, Speaker B: You are the owner for this account.
00:45:22.994 - 00:45:23.244, Speaker A: Okay.
00:45:23.282 - 00:45:38.930, Speaker B: Yeah, that's this way. Another way is for example bitcoin. You can use a private key to sign your antid and filter evidence to blockchain. Everyone can involve, okay, this account belongs to you. They can use public key address, public key to check. Yeah, you can link to all the things.
00:45:40.420 - 00:45:48.804, Speaker A: But what's the relationship between antid and actual cryptographic keys? Is it like one to one or one to many?
00:45:48.922 - 00:45:49.572, Speaker B: One too many.
00:45:49.626 - 00:45:50.372, Speaker A: One too many.
00:45:50.506 - 00:45:53.796, Speaker B: Yeah. Antid is more like business level.
00:45:53.898 - 00:45:55.370, Speaker A: It's like an account. Right.
00:45:57.660 - 00:46:05.610, Speaker B: Your assets address, digital assets address. Just one kind of address. Makes sense. Cool.
00:46:06.220 - 00:46:10.044, Speaker A: Is there any other parts of ontology that we didn't cover?
00:46:10.242 - 00:46:39.072, Speaker B: Yeah, just want to highlight, we have a lot of economic mechanism design. One is due token. Due token is quite important. I want to double check this one. Why we think public chain token mechanism design mechanism is quite important because currently for public blockchain people almost focus on utility token. You use gas to use transaction fee. But one thing is why we need due token, ont and Ong.
00:46:39.072 - 00:47:11.296, Speaker B: This one is gas, right. But Ong is for governance or things. The token design means, okay, we can use Ong for the utility to use that but people want to support you, the holders ont what benefits they can get. For example in the hype the Ethereum have a million dollars one day the transaction fee. But all those fees is benefit for manner right things. Yeah. Not other holders actually the holder is supporting you or funding you or something.
00:47:11.296 - 00:47:41.704, Speaker B: The holder talk and not only to involve you or use something also kind of benefits. So we are designed that is all the gas be used in the ontology platform. Ontology platform will return to the Ont holders. But one thing we add is the holder need to involve the governance process. They need to put a stake or do some contribution for that they will go to return and the supply will.
00:47:41.742 - 00:47:44.372, Speaker A: Be fixed of the Ont.
00:47:44.436 - 00:48:29.304, Speaker B: Yeah. The US or the Ethereum will have a 5% supply every year they will be fixed but Ong will be also this fixed number. But they can be recycled, recycling use used and to return to that. That means if you have more and more application and transaction every day you will get more and more ong again and again and again. Maybe the several that means we can keep. Okay. We don't need to increase the supply to incentive the people because they were impacted the investor before they hold that.
00:48:29.422 - 00:48:29.704, Speaker C: Okay.
00:48:29.742 - 00:48:44.044, Speaker B: You have more supply impact the price. It's not fair actually fair service. We fix the month and this can be circling and time and time. All right, so that is designed for that.
00:48:44.082 - 00:49:01.744, Speaker A: So yeah, let's actually maybe a little bit discuss this. So you have pretty much few different roles, right. You have people who stake and who actually run nodes because they were selected as stakers, right?
00:49:01.782 - 00:49:02.092, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:49:02.166 - 00:49:07.636, Speaker A: And then you have just holders. So the stakers stake ont, right?
00:49:07.738 - 00:49:08.852, Speaker B: Stake ont, yeah.
00:49:08.906 - 00:49:17.192, Speaker A: So the stake ont, they run nodes. So when you run node and you produce a block. Right. You get the reward in ont as well.
00:49:17.246 - 00:49:24.632, Speaker B: Yeah. Not got a reward for Ont, they got reward for Ong. You mean run node, right?
00:49:24.686 - 00:49:24.904, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:49:24.942 - 00:49:40.464, Speaker B: You got a reward from Ong because all the smart contract transaction is just ong. The ong, we are back to a pool and reward to the stake and holder and running. They got reward from Ong. Yeah.
00:49:40.582 - 00:49:43.020, Speaker A: Okay, so they receive Ong.
00:49:43.180 - 00:49:43.890, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:49:44.660 - 00:49:46.930, Speaker A: And it automatically gets sold, right?
00:49:47.780 - 00:49:48.464, Speaker B: What do you mean?
00:49:48.502 - 00:49:54.740, Speaker A: You said it's recycled so it gets sold pretty much to get Ong out of it. Or how does it get recycled?
00:49:55.080 - 00:50:05.968, Speaker B: The second means for example they have 1 billion ong won't be used, they will not be destroyed, they will be returned to the older they can use again.
00:50:05.994 - 00:50:06.820, Speaker A: But it's not destroyed.
00:50:06.900 - 00:50:07.800, Speaker B: You can sold.
00:50:09.340 - 00:50:13.316, Speaker A: Let's say I'm one of the node runners. I received it. It's not destroyed, it's mine.
00:50:13.348 - 00:50:13.736, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:50:13.838 - 00:50:15.476, Speaker A: How it gets recycled.
00:50:15.508 - 00:50:22.764, Speaker B: Now you can sold to exchange, okay. You can. They have price in secondary market.
00:50:22.802 - 00:50:25.390, Speaker A: Gets sold on a secondary market.
00:50:26.080 - 00:50:29.984, Speaker B: Yeah, secondary market. Or you can OTC directly to send it to others.
00:50:30.182 - 00:50:33.264, Speaker C: But you're saying it gets recycled automatically, right?
00:50:33.462 - 00:50:34.156, Speaker B: Pardon?
00:50:34.268 - 00:50:41.372, Speaker C: So let's say I'm issuing a transaction and I'm paying 100 ong. He's a validator node.
00:50:41.436 - 00:50:42.050, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:50:43.060 - 00:50:45.216, Speaker C: And you are an on T holder.
00:50:45.328 - 00:50:46.356, Speaker B: I'm on t holder, yeah.
00:50:46.378 - 00:50:55.368, Speaker C: Okay, so I'm running a transaction, he's a validator, he's staked. You are on T holder. I'm paying 100 ong. Who gets the 100 ong? Him.
00:50:55.454 - 00:51:08.876, Speaker B: Yeah. He do the vatin note. They also put a staker be here. If you're owning ont holder without involving consensus process, governance process, you are not got benefits. Otherwise become security.
00:51:08.978 - 00:51:09.532, Speaker A: Right.
00:51:09.666 - 00:51:39.092, Speaker B: It's not security. You have to do a contribution for that. But currently for the inacia, the first page of the ong, right. They need a dispute mechanism to send out and they can do the recycling again, there's a dispute. That's for ont holder. Every ont holder, no matter you're joining the console node or not, you will got ong released for the first page. Yeah.
00:51:39.092 - 00:51:47.160, Speaker B: If you have a ten key and you will got four ong every day. Right now they will learn to 20 years.
00:51:47.310 - 00:51:57.724, Speaker C: But let's say that he's a staking validator. I issued a transaction and I spent 100 ong. And let's say he doesn't want to sell it, he wants to keep it.
00:51:57.842 - 00:51:58.172, Speaker B: Yes.
00:51:58.226 - 00:52:00.110, Speaker C: Then it cannot get recycled, right.
00:52:00.640 - 00:52:17.036, Speaker B: They have enough the supply, for example, pool, you say. Yeah, in nature have 1 billion on t is fixed price and 1 billion ong. The first 1 billion will release every day to ont holder.
00:52:17.068 - 00:52:17.616, Speaker C: Makes sense.
00:52:17.718 - 00:52:21.968, Speaker B: So every day have a supply coming. You can hold her, you can hold her.
00:52:22.134 - 00:52:32.788, Speaker A: Well, let's say, I mean, at the end people just hold their ong and don't sell, right. Because presumably if it's a fixed price, the ong price will go up. Maybe on the market, maybe.
00:52:32.874 - 00:52:34.820, Speaker B: But every day have a new supply coming.
00:52:34.890 - 00:52:36.644, Speaker A: But this is like only for a fixed time.
00:52:36.682 - 00:52:45.844, Speaker B: Yeah, but every day new supply coming. And if. Okay, everyone hold ong. But every day still have a release. Every day you have a new ong.
00:52:45.892 - 00:52:47.150, Speaker C: But for how long?
00:52:47.520 - 00:52:51.900, Speaker B: It's 20 years will release 1 billion, totally released.
00:52:52.480 - 00:52:56.108, Speaker A: So in 20 years, presumably if people like.
00:52:56.274 - 00:52:58.220, Speaker B: Yeah, yes, it depends.
00:52:58.800 - 00:53:05.884, Speaker C: But how is it different from ethereum inflating 5% every year? You're also effectively inflating.
00:53:06.012 - 00:53:15.520, Speaker B: That means if you are actually most for investment part, normally you are invest ont. Ong is utility token, that's part Ong.
00:53:15.600 - 00:53:18.772, Speaker C: Is fixed and that is distributed on day one.
00:53:18.826 - 00:53:39.980, Speaker B: Yeah. You hold the ont, not only get the 1 billion release from Ong every day, you can do nothing. Got the release every day. And if ontology ecosystem be very large, a lot of transaction every day. The used Ong will return to you if you're joining. But one thing you needed to do is join consensus process.
00:53:40.050 - 00:53:50.464, Speaker C: But what is it called to be used? Like when I as a transaction issuer use my Ong, it is not really used, it goes to the staker, right?
00:53:50.582 - 00:54:00.240, Speaker B: Yeah. They be used in the system and return to a pool.
00:54:00.580 - 00:54:05.376, Speaker C: How does it return to the pool? Why would he get, why would I sell?
00:54:05.478 - 00:54:12.060, Speaker A: If I'm one of the validators, I'll just keep it for now because its price will not go down. So it only will go up presumably.
00:54:12.220 - 00:54:22.264, Speaker B: Yeah. For example, currently you have a node validated nodes process and once a gas fee coming one orange be used, right?
00:54:22.302 - 00:54:22.648, Speaker A: Yes.
00:54:22.734 - 00:54:28.424, Speaker B: That will automatically send it to all the stake nodes.
00:54:28.472 - 00:54:31.352, Speaker A: So I'm not receiving one, I'm receiving.
00:54:31.416 - 00:54:48.204, Speaker B: Like 1000 for example, one. And they have a kind of disputed mechanism for all the stake nodes. They will have a formula to dispute.
00:54:48.252 - 00:54:52.768, Speaker A: Okay, one for everybody in the list, right. Or even the candidates that are not.
00:54:52.854 - 00:55:06.192, Speaker B: For you, not only for you. Maybe you got 0.1, he also got 0.1. But maybe if he's ranked higher than you, there will be a 0.2. So everyone shares one Ong.
00:55:06.256 - 00:55:17.796, Speaker C: But what's the benefit of signing blocks at all? Signing blocks, because if I'm signing a block, but I'm getting as much reward as everybody else who was not selected by the RF. Why would they bother?
00:55:17.828 - 00:55:30.636, Speaker B: Even for example, you put the stake, you be the candidate put, candidate put can be no limitation, can be solid, right. They also will get benefits, right.
00:55:30.658 - 00:55:34.480, Speaker C: But let's say I got into the candidate pool and then the RF selected me.
00:55:34.630 - 00:55:35.184, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:55:35.302 - 00:55:40.690, Speaker C: What is my motivation to actually show up online and create blocks? Why would I not just wait out?
00:55:41.480 - 00:56:10.684, Speaker B: Great question for candidate pool. Maybe sorens, right? Sorence candidate books be there, they will get 50%, guess. Right. Another pool is be selected. Maybe for example, county is 50, they will also get another 50%. In this pool you have got more. So, okay, you want to stake more and build a high reputation and interact your community member vote for me.
00:56:10.684 - 00:56:14.060, Speaker B: I'm enjoying that sort of thing. But that is flexible.
00:56:14.480 - 00:56:21.776, Speaker A: The best one is like if you're. And then from here, right. For every block, you said ten is selected, right?
00:56:21.878 - 00:56:22.530, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:56:22.900 - 00:56:33.596, Speaker A: So here there is no difference, right. Either if you produce the block or didn't produce a block. So pretty much it's efficient to optimize for not being selected.
00:56:33.628 - 00:56:45.110, Speaker B: Yeah. If you're being the select, yes. One thing, if you're being the top 1050, yes. You can got more benefits, but you also have a higher cost. You need to find a balance. For example, you need to stake more.
00:56:46.120 - 00:56:49.352, Speaker A: Like staking is not the cost. Cost is actually running hardware stake also.
00:56:49.406 - 00:57:18.450, Speaker B: Cost stake have locked your liquidity, right? That's just one thing. Another thing is you need to build a reputation. You need to run the node very stable and without the mistake, without shutting and lots of things. Even you let a community member voting for you also cost. You need to maintain your community and involve more dapps, et cetera. So you find a balance, got benefits. So this is why the mechanism design, the economic mechanism is so important.
00:57:18.450 - 00:57:48.124, Speaker B: Actually before I'm an ETH holder, but the price is not about the ecosystem for that. If some days they have a million dollars transaction fee in ETH, all holders should get a benefit. But no, that's a stranger things. I like the fixed price, the fixed amount, fixed supply. I don't think every year have 5%. It's not make sense. Who have power to generate another 5%.
00:57:48.124 - 00:57:59.148, Speaker B: And also it's not fair for the earlier investor. I hold a token every year us eph. Every year 5% supply coming. It's not fair to me.
00:57:59.234 - 00:58:09.136, Speaker A: Well, the point should be that people are mining, right? If you're just holding and not participating, I mean it's the same like you're just saying. If they need to be participating, right.
00:58:09.238 - 00:58:24.884, Speaker B: If they're holding, not participate, you only got the initial release. They will not got other benefits. Yeah, but one thing is why we think decentralized. The participation is very easily. Even you're not wrong. Notes. You can select a note, I vote for you.
00:58:24.884 - 00:58:39.268, Speaker B: I can share profits for you. I even only have a ten on t. I can put my stake to you and you do the round the nose. You got benefits share to me. This is increasing.
00:58:39.364 - 00:58:39.624, Speaker A: So.
00:58:39.662 - 00:58:39.888, Speaker B: Indeed.
00:58:39.924 - 00:58:51.760, Speaker A: So if we have the same reputation, for example, or sorry, we have the same stake, but different reputation. Is this split non equally, right. So having higher reputation, you have a higher rank.
00:58:52.580 - 00:58:56.880, Speaker B: When you dispute the gas, higher rank will get more.
00:58:57.030 - 00:58:57.730, Speaker A: Okay.
00:58:58.420 - 00:59:01.232, Speaker C: And so ten people is who signs the block, right?
00:59:01.366 - 00:59:04.288, Speaker B: Yeah. Every round is terrible. It's run them.
00:59:04.374 - 00:59:06.580, Speaker C: And BFT is run amongst ten people.
00:59:06.730 - 00:59:07.430, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:59:09.800 - 00:59:14.596, Speaker C: But isn't the probability of more than three people being malicious among ten is.
00:59:14.618 - 00:59:42.652, Speaker B: Pretty high no matter since it's random select the 50 is the nodes is be select by their stake, by their reputation if they want to do run things. The cost is very high and it's difficult sometimes. And also once if you have the off chain fishman mechanism, your stake will be impact all the two the 50 at least there's millions on tb be staked.
00:59:42.716 - 00:59:42.992, Speaker C: Right.
00:59:43.046 - 00:59:47.730, Speaker B: If they do something wrong and maybe they will impact their owner benefits as well.
00:59:48.580 - 00:59:52.140, Speaker C: They're not random. Those are top 50 ranked by stake.
00:59:52.300 - 00:59:54.268, Speaker B: Yeah, stake and reputation.
00:59:54.364 - 00:59:54.960, Speaker C: I see.
00:59:55.030 - 00:59:56.324, Speaker A: And they're preselected for two.
00:59:56.362 - 01:00:02.212, Speaker B: Reputation means some nodes link a lot of D apps to that. They also have benefits for them.
01:00:02.266 - 01:00:08.456, Speaker C: So those 50 will not change very often. Right. Presumably like the top ten whales are always going to be in top 50.
01:00:08.558 - 01:00:18.908, Speaker B: Yeah, but still have a change. Not whole change, but some. For example, the last ten will be changing quickly. Every week, every two weeks. Exactly.
01:00:19.074 - 01:00:41.976, Speaker C: But then isn't there a risk that. So those 50 people, presumably a large percentage of them will know each other? That's sort of expected, right? Like rich people in the same ecosystem, they happen to know each other. Can they do some weird monopoly stuff like trying to hold on to ong?
01:00:42.108 - 01:01:19.468, Speaker B: I understand those we have country we use the repetition also include really KYC who is backend is a. Don't you need people know for example the secre capital or the ontology team or some team. You need to show your background. We will not see in our website as well. Yes, of course those people work together or try to manipulate or something. All the KYC will be open and a lot of is noticed by the community voting people. Okay, I don't trust you can vote again.
01:01:19.554 - 01:01:31.612, Speaker A: So if these people decide to let's know they agree on authorized double spend or censor somebody. It's only the foundation that can actually recover.
01:01:31.676 - 01:01:37.012, Speaker B: Currently foundation can do some monitor or some regulator to do that.
01:01:37.066 - 01:01:40.150, Speaker A: But community cannot actually do much because.
01:01:41.400 - 01:01:46.848, Speaker B: Community can private the evidence for that.
01:01:46.954 - 01:01:49.272, Speaker A: I'm saying on chain there's not much you can do, right?
01:01:49.326 - 01:01:50.696, Speaker C: Yeah, using all the blocks, they can.
01:01:50.718 - 01:01:56.536, Speaker A: Just sensor for example, some subset of users, they can do it.
01:01:56.558 - 01:02:06.990, Speaker B: Yeah, that's possible. That's why we involve the reputation. Let this information back end. Information more and more open. Everyone can monitor that.
01:02:07.680 - 01:02:13.650, Speaker C: But isn't it an unnecessary implication. Why not run BFT on 50 people every single time?
01:02:15.540 - 01:02:28.710, Speaker B: Maybe one is performance is a consideration. Is 15 nodes. BFT will be very slow. It's definitely very slow. So we try to find some balance for that.
01:02:30.040 - 01:02:46.320, Speaker C: It feels to me that tendermint, even if you don't use any gossip network, even if they just communicate to each other directly, it's 50 peers, right. And tendermint is two round trips. Effectively like that should be 0.6 seconds.
01:02:46.500 - 01:03:09.616, Speaker B: Tournament is not purely BFT. They cut some wrong. If we want to finish the whole BFT process, we try to use 50 will be a little bit slow than country. So we want to use ViF to select and find a balance between.
01:03:09.718 - 01:03:11.680, Speaker C: Why do you think tendermint is not BFT?
01:03:12.760 - 01:03:17.812, Speaker B: Not. You mean that the 50 period is more higher than that, right?
01:03:17.866 - 01:03:22.176, Speaker C: Oh, I'm saying that tendermint algorithm. Tendermint is a BFT algorithm.
01:03:22.368 - 01:03:23.204, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:03:23.402 - 01:03:24.580, Speaker A: Two round trips.
01:03:25.240 - 01:03:31.688, Speaker C: Well, technically PBFT also just takes two round trips. Unless you have you change. And hopefully with 50 whales, you would.
01:03:31.694 - 01:03:50.892, Speaker B: Not need 50 involved. Currently, for instance, we have a lot of high frequency use case. But if we run to that, for example, they need some high frequency to do that. And we want to keep select ten and keep more easily support more high frequency. Next phase.
01:03:50.956 - 01:03:53.010, Speaker C: And how often do you produce blocks today?
01:03:54.420 - 01:04:05.472, Speaker B: It's flexible means. For example, if no ending transaction, there may be 5 seconds. If transaction coming every second will generate. Yeah.
01:04:05.526 - 01:04:08.656, Speaker A: So you can do instead you have four or five round trips.
01:04:08.768 - 01:04:24.376, Speaker B: No, they mean the block generation time is if no ending transaction during this period is five second block generate. If some transaction coming one or two second is generated, you're saying you're just.
01:04:24.398 - 01:04:28.536, Speaker C: Not producing blocks of transactions, you're delaying blocks if there's no transactions.
01:04:28.648 - 01:04:33.276, Speaker B: Yeah. So it's dynamically, it sounds to me.
01:04:33.298 - 01:04:37.180, Speaker C: Like PBFT among 50 people should definitely finish in 2 seconds.
01:04:38.480 - 01:04:57.968, Speaker B: Yes, it's possible that period is being set by you, not limited by the performance. Not means performance cannot reach. Actually you can do every second. You can generate a broker as well. Yes, it's workable. Just we want to keep a period.
01:04:58.064 - 01:05:03.110, Speaker A: So if you're generating every second, it will be by the same people, right? They're not switching every second.
01:05:03.560 - 01:05:15.320, Speaker B: Not switch every second, but in some period for 5 seconds, they will do it wrong. Another wrong. Yeah, not every time, maybe several wronged and will be reselect.
01:05:16.380 - 01:05:23.260, Speaker A: So there's 50 people, all of them pretty much draw a VRF and then they need to communicate to each other. Right?
01:05:23.330 - 01:05:23.804, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:05:23.922 - 01:05:26.316, Speaker A: To select the ten, like whoever has.
01:05:26.338 - 01:05:49.428, Speaker B: The highest select is the process is not direct. They need communicate each other, but they use VRF. The communication round is a simple round. It's not so complex and it's one round. Now that we have a paper for the VBFT, if you're interesting, you can check that as well. Okay.
01:05:49.594 - 01:05:50.564, Speaker C: Yeah, I think.
01:05:50.682 - 01:05:51.348, Speaker B: Thanks.
01:05:51.514 - 01:05:53.952, Speaker A: That was a lot of good questions. Good deep diving.
01:05:54.016 - 01:06:09.000, Speaker B: Yeah. To be honest, I not know all details about it because we have a big team there. I'm trying my best to share my understanding.
